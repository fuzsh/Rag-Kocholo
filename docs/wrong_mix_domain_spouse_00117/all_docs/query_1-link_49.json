        "text": "Humorous Wikipedia project page\n\nFor a non-humorous list of edit wars on mainspace Wikipedia, see List of edit wars on Wikipedia.\n\n“ What mighty contests rise from trivial things. ” — Alexander Pope, The Rape of the Lock\n\nOccasionally, even experienced Wikipedians lose their heads and devote every waking moment to edit warring over the most trivial things, wasting time debating topics of no practical value, or wrestling over questions whose answers hold no practical consequence. This page documents our lamest examples. It isn't comprehensive or authoritative, but it serves as a showcase of situations where people lose sight of the big picture and obsessively expend huge amounts of energy fighting over something that, in the end, isn't really so important.\n\nEdit warring is believed by some to be important, possibly due to the historical regularity and frequency of the occurrence of these wars. A careful and scholarly study of available archeological evidence has even suggested that edit wars may have recurred on a regular basis going back all the way to the beginning of recorded history, even before the advent of proper writing circa 2001 C.E. (see Wikipedia). In some earlier instances of edit warring, dating back from before the good old days, participants would simply brandish their swords and fight a battle, or later, their guns and fight a duel.\n\nIn modern times, physical combat has been outlawed and replaced by the careful citing of personal attacks, strategic 3RR templating and canvassing, timely notices on WP:AN/I, accusations of incompetence, and (in some cases) marking the changes as a minor edit. Truly, the revolutionary Wikipedia outlook has changed the way things get done. It has changed them from actually getting done to never getting done. On the other hand, nobody gets dispatched (so far!).\n\nSome discussions are born lame; some achieve lameness; some have lameness thrust upon them. Upon coming across a discussion that is borderline lame, some Wikipedians may be tempted to go do something useful. This is a big mistake. Left to its own devices, the discussion might inadvertently become useful. What's the fun in that? It is essential that as many editors as possible chime in, not adding to the discussion at hand but pointing, LOL, and lamely commenting about how lame it is and how it's a big waste of time (See Self-fulfilling prophecy, Positive feedback, and Exponential growth). Merely stating the discussion is lame is frequently not sufficient; every opposing statement must be denied with increasingly vehement assertions of the lameness. While at first blush, wasting time whining about what a waste of time something is may seem illogical, the inherent irony just magnifies the lameness. An additional step to increase lameness is to include repeated links to this essay, which is WP:LAME. Administrators have a special role to play; proposing and implementing topic bans on lame participants is doubly effective: it not only increases the present-day lameness, but, by quashing debate, helps ensure the lame issue remains unsolved for future generations of Wikipedians to go on about. Lamely.\n\nThe best way to begin a lame edit war is to change a large number of articles based on your interpretation of minutiae in the manual of style. If this does not work, try changing the MOS itself; that always works.\n\nIf you want to add a \"lame edit war\" to this page, keep the following in mind:\n\nIt must have been an actual edit war. Discussions on talk pages, even over trivially lame details, are not \"edit wars\" and are, therefore, NOT suitable for this page: we want to encourage such rational debates between users/viewpoints (as opposed to actual edit warring). Note that pithy quotes on talk pages may be suitable for Wikipedia:Talk page highlights.\n\nIt should truly be amongst the lamest edit wars. Not just garden-variety lame.\n\nUnless a participant is banned for their part in the edit war, do not give the names of participants or link to their userpages. People have lapses in judgment, and some end up edit warring; they shouldn't, however, be stuck with that for the rest of their on-wiki careers for no reason. This is absolutely not the place for harping over someone's past editing.\n\nBe careful to avoid even the semblance of taking sides in the war. If one version was more or less accepted afterwards, it's OK to note that, but the fact that an edit war occurred means that neither side was \"in the right all along\".\n\nBe bold! If you feel that an edit war was truly lame, add it! You don't need to ask on the talk page. The lameness of it should speak for itself. Of course, editors with a more experienced eye for lameness may disagree with your claim to the \"lamest\", which may just result in yet another lame edit war!\n\nNote that the no original research and verifiability policies are meant to apply to the article namespace, not necessarily on pages like this in the Wikipedia (project) namespace. This is intended for the community rather than your average readers. Humorous, insightful commentary is encouraged here.\n\nPeople\n\nWas Chopin French, French–Polish, Polish, or Polish–French? For years, there has been a low-level (and at times high-intensity) conflict about which country can claim Chopin as its son. Or was it Szopen? The observer learns a lot about the Napoleonic code, about the nuances of \"citizenship\", \"nationality\", and \"ethnicity\". Students of law can argue the finer points of jus sanguinis and jus soli. The use of \"Polish-born\" is branded as a racist slur. There is spirited debate about whether the citing of a passage of law is considered original research, tantamount to \"dropping Mentos into a bottle of Pepsi to see if it will explode\". Can you emigrate from a country of which you are not a citizen? Can you receive citizenship if you already have it? The possibilities for intensive study are endless. Celebrity witnesses such as Obama, Churchill, Sean Taro Ono Lennon, and Dr. Seuss are pressed into making appearances. Collateral damage even reaches right here, where the because of an alleged lack of lameness. And then there are the trolls. Even Chopin's remains are divided: the body rests in Paris, the heart in Warsaw.\n\nHe is considered both by Hungarians and by Slovaks to be the unsung father of the dynamo and electric motor. But what was his true ethnicity, Hungarian or Slovak? At one point, the score in this heated battle was 16 citations to 4 in favour of the Hungarian side, with the Slovak side being handed both {{Dubious}} and {{Verify source}} tags. It appears that the dust has settled and the Hungarian side won, but at the cost of nine citation numbers immediately after \"Hungarian\".\n\nAre they a British or an Australian group? How about Manx? Tempers flared to the point of an RfC to settle the disruptive behaviour in 2017. Artefacts resulting from years of edit-warring have resulted in this helpful comment in the \"origin\" section of the infobox: PLEASE, DO NOT ADD ANYTHING IN THIS FIELD TO AVOID EDIT WARS. The most recent revision side-steps the issue and simply says \"The Bee Gees were a musical group\". (Or is that \"was a musical group\")?\n\nThere was a feud that was going on for a long time on this one concerning Freddie Mercury's true ancestry. Is he the most famous Iranian rock star? Indian? Parsi? Azeri? You'd be surprised how many people get this annoyed, to the point that it is still a hotly contested item over there. Just one example can be seen here. Oh, and this one, like all the others, had its share of random vandals, people leaving unmarked anonymous insults, and gnashing of teeth. Let's just say for now he's a Parsi whose parents originated from India! Just don't even think of suggesting he's \"left\" Queen or is an \"ex-member\" of the band, though, or you'll really get people's hackles up...\n\n...in 2018, a new edit war cropped up on Freddie Mercury's song \"Love of My Life\" - who is the song about? Mary Austin? A gay lover? Somebody else? It still flares up again, again and again. Jeez, why can't we just all sing along?\n\nBut whence came this great beauty? Is she a \"Bosnian actress of Croatian descent/ethnicity\" or a \"Croatian actress\"? Should she be called American without sourcing because she's resided in America for nearly 30 years? Is she \"Bosnian\" because she was born in Sarajevo or \"Bosnian-born\" because Bosnia did not exist as a nation when she was born there? Go ahead and edit the article and see how long your version lasts before someone reverts you!\n\nIs she American or American-born? Is she Greek-American? Is she English-American? Is she Greek-and-English-American? Does she need all-those-prefixes-in-front-of-her-nationality-American? Did Kiriakis mastermind the entire affair?\n\nBorn in what was then Hungary but is now part of Austria to ethnic German parents whose families had lived in Hungary for a long time, and we had all thought it was common knowledge that Liszt claimed Hungary as his homeland and Hungarian as his nationality. Er, didn't he? Cue the largest and most acrimonious war in recent memory! It was mercifully confined to the talk page, but what a talk page it was. What was Liszt's real name, Franz or Ferenc? (It was actually Franciscus.) If he was such a Hungarian patriot, why didn't he fight in the war of independence in 1848? If he was really Hungarian, why is his \"Hungarian\"-style music actually based on Romani music? If he really thought he was Hungarian, why did he spend so much time in France? Why couldn't he write better lyrics for the Krönungslied (which was actually Ungarisches Königslied)? What is the significance of the Chopinesque left hand octaves in Funerailles, Octobre 1849? What event of October 1849 was he referring to, the crushing of the Hungarian rebellion or the death of Chopin? Or was it the publication of Heinrich Heine's rude poem about him? Why couldn't he learn to speak Hungarian better? Did he like goulash? Could he dance the csárdás? The farce was compounded by the occasional appearance of anonymous trolls who insisted that Liszt was, in fact, a Slovak.\n\nThis Liszt is incomplete; you can help Wikipedia by trying not to expand it further.\n\nIs he American or American-born? Is he Chinese-American? Is he Taiwanese-American? With Chinese and Taiwanese Chinese-Taiwanese and Americans Mainland Chinese and Taiwan Chinese Real Chinese and Chinese who had forgotten their ancestors Freedom fighters and threat to humanity Mao Zedong worshippers and modern Chinese \"Unionists\" and \"Independencrats\" reviving arguments that once almost sabotaged zh.wiki, this article has the (mis)fortune to have a lengthy FAQ which uses statements like \"Chinese can also be Taiwanese just like Chinese can also be Beijingers\" and \"Jeremy Lin's maternal grandma lives in Zhejiang and thus he has undisputed Chinese descent\" to satisfy both sides.\n\nWas he Polish, German, or Prussian? Or did he have no nationality at all that bears mentioning? If Copernicus were around today, he might have suggested that he would be satisfied to be remembered as an astronomer, but we will never know. Was he ever married? What is his middle name? No one knows exactly. Whether this edit war will spread to the page on his memorial on the periodic table is unknown.\n\nBorn of Serbian parents in a part of the Austrian Empire, which a short time later became a part of the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary and is now in Croatia. He eventually became a naturalized citizen of the US. So was he Serbian? Croatian? Austrian? Austro-Hungarian? Istro-Romanian? Jewish? American? There's even a specific sub-talk page just for this! You decide! But don't forget to leave saying how pathetic it is to choose any other version.\n\nWho said the English-speaking world was immune to inane ethnological disputes? This debate, over a single word in the article, consumed most of the month of September 2007. The key question is: is he an English writer or is he a British writer of English origin? Can we add \"American\" in there somewhere because he moved to America at age 74? Well over half the talk page is dedicated to this one issue. The two editors warring over it filed simultaneous 3RR reports against each other and a RFC. Accusations of weasel wording appear in the talk page. Fine points of policy debated: does reverting to prevent a revert war constitute a real revert? Does it count as a revert if you call it vandalism, even if it is a content dispute? Is it bad faith to remove HTML comments from the page if only editors will see them, or do such invisible comments constitute a vandalism of their own? Is it a bad thing to use the \"minor\" tag to \"conceal\" changes?\n\nIs this porn star Italian? Native American? Puerto Rican? Cypriot? Does she have Indian blood? Who cares? But make sure that, when you change it, you don't even think about citing any source; please feel free to insult whoever put in the previous ethnicity. IP editors: be sure to insert multitudes of her different \"real names\", with no sourcing whatsoever.\n\nBorn in Germany, supposedly of a German mother and a Yugoslav father, and raised in Bavaria, Germany. Does that make Herzog: a) Croatian or b) Serbian? How about the fact that his relatives live in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Use edit summaries to publish interviews that you conducted – or heard rumors about. Mirrors and forks are great sources too. After consulting a printed source, it turns out that it was the mother who was from Croatia. Ouch.\n\nBiographers who knew him said his family was Kurdish. But was he a Kurd, Arab, Turk, Persian, Armenian, some combination of these, or something else? Were his father and uncle Kurds, or Arabs, or Kurdicized Arabs, or Turks, or Kurdicized Turks? Does it depend on the ethnicity of his mother, about whom we know literally nothing? He definitely spoke Arabic, but did he speak Kurdish too? Or Turkish? He was born in Tikrit, so does that make him Iraqi? Syrian? Mesopotamian? Kurdistani? If he is ethnically Kurdish, is the Ayyubid dynasty that followed him a Kurdish dynasty? Does modern Kurdish nationalism have anything to do with the Kurds of the 12th century? (This spills over into various articles about the Ayyubid dynasty too.)\n\nIs Милица Наташа Богдановна Јововић/Milica Jovović Serbian/Montenegrin or only Serbian? Montenegrin became the official language of Montenegro in 2007 and received a new standard on 10 July 2009, but it has been promoted by the Montenegrin community since 2004. Montenegro legally seceded from Serbia and Montenegro in 2006, but Milla was born in Ukraine in the Soviet Union in 1975 to a Russian/Ukrainian mother and father of Serbian (Serbian/Montenegrin?) extraction when Serbia (Serbia and Montenegro?) was still in Yugoslavia. Where do you stand?\n\nIs U2 an \"Irish band\" or simply a band that happens to be from Ireland, since two of their members were born in the UK? Many discussions have taken place over the course of several years as whether \"U2 are an Irish rock band\" or simply \"U2 are a rock band\" should be included in the text. Edit wars continued back and forth, and at one point the article even read \"U2 are an Irish and British rock band\" (which didn't last very long). A similar compromise could have been \"an Irish rock band with two British members\". And this was in addition to a debate on whether \"is\" or \"are\" should be used! Casey Kasem may have foreshadowed this edit war decades ago when he offered his first impression of U2 early in their career: \"This is bullshit. Nobody cares. These guys are from England and who gives a shit!\" Eventually, a heated discussion took place for over two-and-a-half weeks that resulted in at least one editor getting blocked and many more getting warnings, to eventually come to the conclusion that U2 are, in fact, an Irish band. (At least for now.) And why did nobody even edit war over to use \"is\" or \"are\"? What is life?\n\nIs she Canadian or Portuguese-Canadian? Editors ruthlessly argue over the formalities of citizenship and nationality. Which country's laws of citizenship should be used? Apparently, she was born to Portuguese parents and has released albums in Portuguese, but \"she was born, lives, and works in Canada.\" Accusations of xenophobia are made. Much like reality television, this could get nasty. Confusingly, she has a star on Canada's Walk of Fame (for Canada) and was awarded Commander of the Order of Prince Henry (for Portugal), extending the edit war well into real life.\n\nIs this Grand Slam-winning tennis player from Scotland, (or Great Scotland) the UK, or Great Britain? Despite the compromise in the lead of calling him both Scottish and British, users and IPs don't realize that they are talking about the same place, so every year, when Wimbledon comes around, you can always see an edit war or talk page arguments about the subject, and like tennis, the final result of this edit war will never be known. Mainly going down the line of Murray called himself Scottish. Murray is anti-English and British after the media misinterpreted a joke with Des Kelly and Tim Henman in 2006 so therefore he must be Scottish. We can't have \"Scottish\" in the lead; he doesn't represent Scotland, he has to play for Great Britain. Any of which gets shouted down by the other argument and goes round and round all summer until a regular editor reverts it back to the \"consensus compromise\". Of course, consumers of the British press will be aware that, to those south of the border, Murray is British until he loses a match, at which point he reverts to Scottishness. But the truly lame thing on this page is that's not the only regular edit war. The page also sees an argument of whether Murray was born in Dunblane or Glasgow.\n\nWas his nationality Scottish or British or both? Should the infobox in the article list him as (1) British nationality or (2) Scottish nationality and British citizenship, or (3) Scottish & British nationality (no citizenship) or (4) no nationality and citizenship? Users and IPs relentlessly argue over the formalities of nationality & citizenship in more than 27,000 words of discussion. Editors then adopt a strategy to argue over which of the versions should be in place until the discussion resolves the questions, but it remains a mystery as to whether they did so expecting that the questions will never be resolved.\n\nWas he Jewish through his maternal grandmother or never at all? People who claim his grandmother was Jewish quote an L.A. Times article wherein George Michael himself claims that \"His maternal grandmother was Jewish but married a Gentile and raised her children with no knowledge of their Semitic heritage. This was during World War II, and 'she thought if they didn't know that their mother was Jewish, they wouldn't be at risk,' Michael said.\" They also claim that it should stay in the article because being Jewish (ethnicity) and practicing Judaism (religion) are two different things. The opposition claims that George Michael was simply confused with the name of his grandmother, Daisy Angold Young, and mistook Angold for a Jewish surname. One of the opposition found genealogy for George Michael's grandmother leading back to 1828 in London. The same person linked an article talking about Christmas songs written by Jewish people on an interfaith support website that claims Michael being Jewish is an internet myth. All this arguing led to mass edit warring, accusations of Jews and non-Jews trying to white-wash history, and anti-semitism. The dates on the talk pages span from 2/10/07-12/20/08, 6/25/11-1/11/13, 12/30/16-1/5/17, and 10/19/17-11/14/17. Three of the many examples of 3RR are here:[1], [2], [3].\n\nHow many nationalities does he have? A lot. Born to Haitian-Dominican parents in the UK, but raised in Atlanta, Georgia from 7 years old, the citizenship status of 21 Savage has been disputed since his arrest in February 2019. Is he English? British? American? British-American? Or, according to Sir Savage the 21st himself, African-American? Discussion on the talk page included debating his rights to being a British national, noting the nationality laws between the UK and the US differ. As of now, he is described as a rapper who was born in England and based in Georgia. Due to his debated status, should his date be listed as \"22 October\" or \"October 22\"? Does he even qualify for DACA protection? Why does he have a 12 car garage? Pronunciation rules on \"garage\" need not apply.\n\nThere was a dispute on the order and necessity of transliteration of the famous actor Rajni Kanth's names into languages like Marathi, Hindi, and Kannada. The people for the inclusion and giving a higher priority believed that the actor has significant history in that state of India, as well as sufficient fan-following to merit a transliteration, while the editors from Tamil origin were of the opinion that they would be surrendering their most prized possession. The talk page had been bubbling with so many threads on this singular issue. In 2011–2012, a consensus was reached after an RfC: All the Indic language scripts would be replaced with the IPA for such articles.\n\nPlaces and other things\n\nDokdo → Liancourt Rocks → Takeshima → Dokdo → Dokdo → Liancourt Rocks → ?\n\nNo, this is not the title of an album by the band Liancourt, but a group of sinking volcanic rocks that has been claimed by both Japan and Korea since really, really long ago. [4] Evidence of ownership for either side rests on hard-to-read decaying pieces of old paper. This is not a silly dispute as the rocks have important economic and military value, yada yada yada. Serious Japanese or Korean Wikipedians may even choose to make these rocks their place of residence (living there not required!) to bolster their case. This article extensively documents every little factoid that could possibly indicate ownership by one country, with each, of course, having a countering statement. Newspapers and internet forums like 2channel are part of the discussion, yet everyone claims their POV is NPOV. As properly befitting this major political issue, most edit summaries begin with \"rv ...\" Luckily, at least the title of the article has been settled on ... or has it? See also: Liancourt Rocks dispute.\n\nYou'd have thought Counties of the United Kingdom would be a fairly uncontroversial subject, but no – this insider outsider pressure group involving ninety-two eighty-six UK counties (that doesn't involve Government policy) is guaranteed to bring out the red mist every once in a while. One thing's for sure, the edit warring on this article is far from over ...\n\nThe \"British Isles\"\n\nIs this phrasing acceptable? Does it geographically include the entire Northern European archipelago; or is the term inherently anti-Irish? Should it always be \"the UK and Ireland\" instead? Campaign-like warring removals and reversions on nearly any article containing the words 'British Isles' have resulted in topic bans, grueling skirmishes replete with sock warriors, and general misery over the thing. No consensus has truly emerged as to an ideal term; or even if the existing one is really a problem or not.\n\nWas this marinated raw fish delicacy invented in Peru, or in Ecuador? Or maybe Mexico, Polynesia, Spain, Chile, Granada, Argentina...\n\nShould the article on this city in Northern Ireland be called Derry or should it be called Londonderry? With loyalists and republicans (and even nationalists) on both sides, don't expect an answer soon. *cough*WP:DERRY/WP:LONDONDERRY*cough*\n\nAn image on this featured article shows the tiny moon of Saturn superimposed on a map of the British Isles, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands Great Britain and Ireland, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. Cue edit warring, accusations of vandalism, and full protection of the article.\n\nExport House, that internationally renowned tower block in Woking\n\nMultiple back and forth about whether the local nickname for the building is the bat building or the B.A.T building (from British American Tobacco). For a while this was resolved by quoting both, but then further edit warring ensued as to whether it should be followed by '(more commonly known as bat)' or B.A.T. Looking for citations showed that it is mostly referred to as BAT, which led to the absurdity of three versions of the nickname in the lead for this barely notable tower block in a small provincial town. Costumed climbing of said tower now seems inevitable, presumably dressed as an alternative superhero from usual.\n\nFlorina and other towns in Macedonia (Greece)\n\nEdit war about whether the alternative name Lerin is Macedonian, Bulgarian or South Slavic (which covers both Macedonian and Bulgarian).\n\nWho first donned a frilly skirt and threatened to kill anyone who questioned his manhood over it? Was he Albanian or Greek? If Albanian, Gheg or Tosk? Thankfully, none of the modern day warriors on this topic have access to real weapons (we hope!)\n\nWas this tasty salad invented in Mexico in 1924, or in ancient Rome? Is it named after Caesar Cardini or Julius Caesar? Is it spelled Caesar, Cesar, César, or Cesare? If you add tomatoes is it still a Caesar or is it something called a \"Letchworth salad\"? A slow-motion edit war stretching out over one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven years is surely the best way to find out.\n\nIs Niko Bellic (the main character) Serbian, Slovak, Bosnian, Croatian, Russian, or from some unnamed Eastern European country? Normally reliable sources do not agree on the matter (with those written pre-launch suggesting the character is Russian, and post-launch Serbian or Croatian), and the actual game itself is just ambiguous enough about the subject to create dissent (and of course this is a part of the world where nationalist feelings run high, see Balkanization – even the order that Croatia and Serbia are listed also offends some.). At one point, the article contained five consecutive citations, repeated each of the three times the character's nationality is mentioned, totalling a whopping fifteen citation numbers throughout the article to justify the purported nationality of a fictional video game character. The article reached eventual consensus on the nationality issue (unknown) and the name of the war (an unknown war in Eastern Europe) based on the author(s) having not revealed the information about the character. Despite it being over a decade and a half since the game's release, and despite edit notices and warning text in the article body and an FAQ on the talk page, the subject still receives many edits a year, and the subject is repeatedly raised on the article talk page.\n\nAre these beautiful waterfalls on the Kaveri River located in Tamil Nadu – or on the border between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka – or in Tamil Nadu on its border with Karnataka? Or is it really the Cauvery river, and Hogenakal Falls? Do a dispute over water usage, and a separate dispute over access to an island below the Falls, have no bearing on this, or do they prove that the location of the Falls must be on the border? Whatever you believe, be sure to bring a (Google) map to the debate, and point out that your opponent's sources are not RS or NPOV!\n\nHummus and friends\n\nHummus: they love it in Israel, so shouldn't it be in Category:Israeli cuisine? Or is it a purely Arab food that the Zionists have illegally occupied?[5] After a related skirmish on Za'atar, the ingredients were listed in alphabetical order, but was this all part of a shrewd Zionist plot? Don't be silly, came the response: and anybody who removes the Hebrew name from the first sentence is a racist vandal.[6] Meanwhile, back at Hummus, an attempt is made to replace a mention that the Oxford English Dictionary says that the word entered English via Turkish with a reference to the Greek name for the dish. Finally, Tabbouleh saw action, this time mercifully free of Arab-Israeli connotations; instead, the question was: can we call this dish a part of Levantine cuisine, or is the very term \"Levantine\" a European colonial plot to divide the great Arab nation?[7]\n\nIn the meantime, another attempt is made to expunge the Turks from description of the traditional Greek (or maybe Arab) dish of pita (or is it pitta?), while controversy bubbles as to whether a photo of an Israeli falafel house constitutes \"Zionism\".\n\nConclusion: Tasty snacks in the Middle East are hilariously politicized. As of September 2022 , the talk page for Hummus states: \"The article Hummus, along with other articles relating to the Arab–Israeli conflict, is currently subject to active arbitration remedies.\"\n\nIs it a lake or is it just a name? Or is it a system? And if it is a system, how is it distinct from the Great Lakes system? And if it is just a name how can it be the largest lake? [8] If it's not a lake, then is it one body of water? [9] Or is it a lake just hydrologically? Should it be called a lacustrine entity instead? Is this a category error or definitional attribute? Or is there simply no such entity? [10] And is notifying any WikiProjects forum shopping? [11] And, most importantly, who should be topic banned?\n\nWhy lay bricks when you can edit bits? The headquarters of this British organisation are located in Buckinghamshire. But should it be called \"Buckinghamshire, England\" or \"Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom\"? In April 2008, this crucial issue became the focus of an edit war involving no fewer than eight users and one anonymous editor over a period of a week. (This is particularly inexplicable since England is, of course, part of the United Kingdom.) On April 23, the participants finally settled on \"England\" and the edit war ended – perhaps in recognition of St. George's Day?\n\nNot the dancer, but rather the tasty antipodean dessert, which was invented in Australia, New Zealand, Australia, New Zealand, Rabbit Season, Duck Season, fire!\n\nBut surely this is just Western propaganda. The great Russian physiologist, Ivan Pavlov, invented this dessert to make dogs salivate, as we all know, The Truth™.\n\nDoes the Šarplaninac (Yugoslav/Illyrian shepherd dog) originate from Kosovo, Albania, Serbia and/or Macedonia? Nobody can agree, but even flags are being hoisted at this point in the infobox.\n\nShould it be called the Sea of Japan, the East Sea, or even the East Sea of Korea? Are both names valid, and if so, should the article be named Sea of Japan (East Sea) or Sea of Japan / East Sea? Or should it be the actual most common English and international name Sea of Japan (East Sea), parentheses and all? Should the dispute page be called the Sea of Japan naming dispute, or the Naming dispute over the body of water between Japan and Korea and the Russian Far East? Given the existence of other names meaning \"East Sea\" in other languages, should East Sea redirect to the disambiguation page or to the \"body of water bordered by Japan, Russia and Korea\"?\n\nWhich unincorporated (and thus unbounded) hamlet of the town of Colonie north of Albany, New York, is this small Catholic liberal arts college in: Loudonville or Newtonville? The college's website says Loudonville, but how can we trust it when the Colonie Town Hall just across US 9 uses Newtonville for its address? Discussion reaches 30,000 words, reverts spill across all three articles, two get protected, an informal RFC is opened and one editor briefly retires.\n\nNo one believes the Hata clan of Asia are in any way Jewish. Yet an edit war still erupted over how to say that, with the book ref from respected author Jon Entine stating the fact that all sides (and sane people) would agree on, right there at the bottom of page 117.\n\nSnakes from the Middle East are hilariously politicized too! This one is found in Syria, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, and either \"Palestine\" or \"the Palestinian territories\". Users have been edit-warring for six years now over how to describe it. The opinions of the snake itself on the political status of Palestine are unknown.\n\nCan the Khmelnytsky uprising be described as an \"anti-Polish\" revolt? Or was it just a revolt that happened to be against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth? Moreover, why is any of this in the lead section of a largely unrelated article about a class of Polish gentry? One editor quits Wikipedia, and another spends multiple days making more arguments on the talk page long after anyone else has presumably stopped paying attention. Hop on over to the talk page to witness some truly remarkable feats of formatting and a case study in how not to use quotes to prove a point.\n\nEnglish names\n\nThe Final Fantasy VII character was introduced to English audiences in 1997 as Aeris, but her name changed to Aerith in later appearances. Was the first name a misspelling? A mistranslation from the original Japanese pronunciation? That's how it was when it was first released in English, so that makes it her official name. But the later appearances are official too, right? She was known and referred to as Aeris for years, so that makes it the common name, but she's been going by Aerith since 2002...\n\nWith every title in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII (2003) using Aerith, the warring seems to have ended. The lengthy discussions are archived at Talk:Aerith Gainsborough/Name debate archive (page size 113kb).\n\nShould there be a separate page for New Avengers (comics)? Is the name of the team now the New Avengers or is it just a new Avengers? Is it a new comic entirely or just a continuation of the old one? Following a positive merge vote, a series of reverts occurs when an editor \"merges\" the two by simply pasting the merged information into the article, creating two articles in one. The slow nature of the revert war means that, technically, nobody violates WP:3RR, and requests for help from other admins go unheeded because, well, it's lame. After a series of exchanges on the talk page questioning people's command of English as well as their sanity, the issue appears to have been settled with the creation of New Avengers (comic book) (note the oh-so-subtle distinction) based on the WikiProject Comics guidelines.\n\nThe double-feature portmanteau of Barbie and Oppenheimer became notable in its own right in 2023, but what name should we use for the two protagonists in the image caption under their photos? Edit wars, several talk page discussions, and an 18,000-word RfC asked whether they should be called \"Barbara Millicent 'Barbie' Roberts and Julius Robert 'Oppie' Oppenheimer\" or just \"Barbie and J. Robert Oppenheimer\". Is providing full names with nicknames useful, precise, confusing, or just trivial \"fancruft\"? In the end, there was consensus for using the most familiar names, but the photo of Barbie had already been deleted as a copyright violation anyway.\n\nIn the name of the programming language C#, is that # thing (octothorpe) after the C a number sign or the musical sharp symbol? What should the wrongname template say? Some argue that a Microsoft FAQ supports the sharp symbol, while others argue that the ECMA standard promotes the # symbol and that it has better browser support. Some propose using # as a superscript (C#), which few editors like. Editors repeatedly reverted between each other, some refusing to discuss the issue on the talk page. The issue was resolved with an e-mail exchange with Microsoft stating that in their view it's an octothorpe symbol representing the sharp symbol, similar to how \"<=\" represents the less than or equal symbol, and that thus Microsoft does not disagree with ECMA. Written \"Netscape\" but pronounced \"Mozilla\", eh? Anyone?\n\nIt looks like you're trying to argue on Wikipedia. Would you like some help? You know that paper clip from Microsoft Office in 1997? Of course you do. But what was his name? Extremely obscure Microsoft publications, and extremely obscurantist Wikipedia editors, provide ammunition to both sides. The wrong name is obviously a result of citogenesis: but which was the true name and which was the false one being citogenesized? Forty thousand bytes of debate took place throughout August 2023. Ultimately, consensus was found to include both names, meaning everyone was right (or everyone was wrong, depending on how you look at it).\n\nThe creature from the movie Cloverfield was never explicitly named in the movie, or was it? Is \"Cloverfield\" the name of the military casefile, or the monster, or both? Some reporter referred to the creature itself as \"Cloverfield\" so let's go with \"Cloverfield (creature)\" Wait, shouldn't we follow suit with Frankenstein and call it \"The Cloverfield creature\"? Or wait, maybe it should just be \"Cloverfield creature\", maybe it should be \"Cloverfield (monster)\"? No, we can't do that, it shows bias and isn't NPOV. Rumor has it that the production staff just called it \"Clover\", but that's just a nickname, it doesn't count, does it? No matter, we can't use that until we find a source confirming that they call it Clover ... OK, now we have one. How's about we skirt all naming conventions and call it \"The Monster/Clover (creature)\" to make everyone happy. Nah, that's no good, back to \"Clover (creature)\". But wait, that's still not the true name of the creature, so we shouldn't use that. Followed by and interspersed with a cavalcade of \"Alright how about we just compromise and set it back to <editor's favorite name>.\" It's extremely important that an article on a fictional topic which only narrowly escaped AfD be properly named. Rather amusingly, considering how much edit warring there was/is on the page, it's been awarded \"Good Article\" status! [12] Wait, never mind! It's not anymore! It's now B-class. No, C-class according to WikiProject Horror!\n\nCompact Disc is a tradename, and therefore is capitalised. But the logo says \"Compact disc\", and the term is now used as a generic term for compact disks or compact discs, depending on where in the world they are. Everyone calls them CDs (or maybe CD's). So, where to put the article? Passions have been raised on this compelling topic on the article's talk page sporadically since 2004, boiling over briefly in 2007 and 2009. Everyone calm down – relax, have a cup of coffee, and listen to your favourite... erm... shiny music circle.\n\nShockingly, there are multiple locations in the United States with the name \"Devils Lake\" with and without apostrophes. A very heated war broke out here regarding which one should be featured, whether a disambiguation page was needed, even over the usage of the apostrophe – eventually literally degenerating into \"my lake is better than yours!\" Solution: RENAME THE FREAKIN' LAKES!!!\n\nDoes the name of this band include the definite article? Is it \"Eagles\" or \"the Eagles\"? The band's name is \"Eagles\", yet all former and current band members talk about their tenure with \"the Eagles\" in published interviews and on the official website. From the very first sentences of the band's biographies on Allmusic, Rolling Stone, and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, we can see how the world outside WP writes about them. Despite these facts, every \"tequila sunrise\" there appears an odd and concerted effort ( ) to erase the... \"the\" from all instances in the article, (even spilling into a band member's article [23]), leading to awkward \"bizarro-speak\" that even the band members themselves would surely laugh at. Someone needs to tell Don Felder to change the title of his book, because apparently he was wrong.\n\nWas Eris named after the Greek goddess Eris or the Greek and Discordian goddess Eris? Does it matter that the IAU and discoverer Michael E. Brown referenced only the Greek aspect, even though the referenced mythological event was identical with The Original Snub? Is mentioning Discordianism POV because it gives the religion undue weight? Edit war results in loss of good article status and temporary article locking (but it's now a featured article, hurrah!). Hail Discordia! The edit war was resolved by not actually mentioning what type of goddess Eris is. As of 22 August 2023, the article refers to the Greek goddess as the source of the name, but mentions Discordianism as the source of the planetary symbol. See also: Pluto and Ceres (dwarf planet).\n\nA heated debate took place on whether English Robin was an alternate common name for the European Robin, often simply called Robin. One editor persisted[24] [25] [26] [27] in adding this essential piece of information despite opposition [28] [29] [30] until there was a concession of sorts ... Or not. Or does persistence pay off? Maybe not. Is this the last word on the matter? Who knows ... Can it suspend a coconut from its husk? [31]\n\nShould second-season winner \"Deelishis\" be credited as her birth name, Chandra Davis, or her stage name, London Charles? Months of IP additions and months of \"IF YOU REVERT WITHOUT DISCUSSION, YOU'RE GONNA BE BLOCKED!\" ensue. In the end, nobody got blocked and the dispute died down on its own, probably because both sides realized they were battling over a woman who willingly went on a reality television show to \"fall in love with\" Flavor Flav. Yeah, boyeeeeeee!\n\nDoes the name of a Canadian TV channel, originally an offshoot of namesake American one, contain the word \"Canada\" in its official title, ergo it should be parenthesized in the title? It's a terribly important matter, as witnessed by an intense move war and circular discussion on the talk page.\n\nShould this substance be called 'gasoline' or 'petrol'? See the talk page for a debate about the total number of English speakers in the world (and whether Americans should be considered an important part of it); the relative utility of search engines, closely followed by the unleashing of various pie charts and tables; claims that UK-wikipedians are set to re-establish the British Empire by moving pages to British spellings, counter-claims that Americans who want \"gasoline\" are being their usual nationalistic/culturally-imperialistic selves; RFC nominations, page-move warring and deletion debates, failed attempts to achieve compromise via some truly freaky article names (far beyond the suggested \"Gasoline (petrol)\" and \"Petrol (gasoline)\") and even the creation of templates to separate the article into sections individually tailored for both Commonwealth and American English tastes. Gasoline has been settled on for now, in part because that was the article's title originally, but the fallout has yet to settle.\n\nFinally, while not trying to pour fuel over the fire, it should be noted that in Arab countries (its birthplace, after all), and a lot of Europe, people call it \"benzine\".\n\nOr is it \"Gender of god\"? How about \"Gender of Gods\", gotta remember those damn pagans. Or is that \"Gender of gods\"? Is \"sex\" more appropriate than \"gender\"? Is god/God/gods/Gods appropriate at all? How about (d/D)ivine entit(ies/y) ... or (s/S)upreme (b/B)eing(s) ... or some mix of all the above? Meanwhile, this doesn't account for religions with no explicit sex (or is that explicit gender?). We haven't quite decided yet, but rest assured, whilst some silly people are trying in vain to reach consensus, those with the power are proving their point with reverts. There have even been threats of ArbCom.\n\nAlessa was captured, but just how captured do you have to be to be considered \"captured\"? That \"forced medical attention\" makes all the difference in the world, so why would we need the word \"captured\"? While playing the game, a user might get the idea that a character implies something, so does a subtle wink at the camera mean something entirely different; something that could affect the whole plot and our own pride, for going with sourced material? It mattered for some, obviously, as a massive edit war broke out about a few words here and there and the war would be still going on, had it not been for the fact that administrators did some shallow digging and discovered that the instigator of the edit war was a famed blocked user who has been discovered to create no fewer than 23 sockpuppet accounts.\n\nThe protagonist from Konami's survival horror video game Silent Hill 3 is known to those who have played the game as \"Heather\". But what is her last name? Is it Morris after the actress who portrayed her? Is it Mason? Does anyone care? Many sources disagree. A 'my source is more valid than yours' edit war broke out in an unlikely place. It wasn't on the page for the character in question. Certainly not on the page for the game itself. It actually broke out on the Silent Hill 3 blurb on the series overview page and its talk page.\n\nShould there be disambiguation notices on the respective articles of the Halo video games to the band Nine Inch Nails's personal Halo numbers for their albums? Do the numbers' acceptance by Trent Reznor mean anything? Are the Halo numbers notable enough to be disambiguated? Are any people going to search for Halo 2 or 3, not expecting information about a video game? Is the form of the Halo number Halo 3 or halo_03 or HALO 3?\n\nThankfully it seems like that this debate did not flare up again with the release of Halo 4.\n\nShould it say Hillary Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton in the infobox? This long-running edit war since 6 June 2015 has led to two full protections, which at the same time led to the loss of an indefinite semi protection after one expired. This also led to a RFC which stopped the warring. Wait, it's Hillary Diane Rodham now?!\n\nIs the southern terminus of Interstate 75 in Hialeah, Florida, or would it serve the typical Wikipedia reader better if the infobox said \"near Miami, Florida\", a better-known city with twice the population 10 miles (16 km) away? A discussion followed by a straw vote indicated that the majority of the participants preferred the latter wording, but there was no consensus. The debate (and the edit war) settled down for a few months until someone associated with Miami Dade College, whose Hialeah Campus is, er, near Miami, rekindled the reversions with an insistence that the phrase should be cited with an online reference and that \"near Miami\" violates WP:NPOV. Since then, the dispute – mainly through edit comments – has spread to a question as to whether a cited \"in Hialeah\" should be trumped by an uncited \"near Miami\". The dispute has pitted students and faculty of MDC against a handful of Wikipedians who believe that a precedent should prevail. As the standoff persists, the rest of the world rolls by ... until finally, it seems \"in Hialeah, FL near Miami\", with cite! gets the nod.\n\nWas she really a Queen of England? Should her page be at Jane of England or Lady Jane Grey? Should she be referred to as Her Majesty Queen Jane? Does her husband merit inclusion in The List of royal consorts of the United Kingdom? (Notice that, until recently, Royal Consorts of the United Kingdom was a red link, unlike The weather in Liverpool.) Resulted in many cut-and-paste page moves, edit warring across multiple pages and flaming on those talk pages. Warriors did not come to their senses even when it was pointed out how long Jane herself had been dead, though mercifully none of them met the same fate as their subject by having their heads lopped off. Though that would reduce the chatter!\n\nVarious supporters of the US Libertarian party (founded in 1971) argue that they own the meaning of the word \"libertarian\", that placing it next to \"socialism\" is a contradiction in terms, and hence that libertarian socialism (described circa 1850) cannot possibly have existed. An edit war and request-for-deletion war ensues.\n\nIs her name pronounced like \"rolling\" or to rhyme with \"howling\"? Rowling is on record claiming she pronounces her name like \"rolling\". An irate editor argues that this is a \"British\" pronunciation and the \"American\" pronunciation of her name should also be noted. This is slightly ridiculous as she is English, and therefore of course will pronounce it in an English manner. Cue endless spats on talk pages over whose arguments are \"more cogent\", and multiple reversions. Issue finally resolved (sort of) by very, very, very obliquely implying that she pronounces her name \"rolling\", rather than stating that that is how her name is pronounced. Edit war was brief, but, astoundingly, other people have since logged on and made the same complaint. Perhaps it rhymes with \"Trolling\"?\n\nThen again, rhymes themselves are dangerously POV.\n\nShould this article (and other articles and templates that mention this award) use the common name of the award, the official name, Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, the even more official name, Sveriges Riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne, or perhaps a compromise name, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics? The ignoble debate has involved endless discussions, requested moves, revert wars, blocks, and strangely, two (N/n)obel Prizes.[citation needed]\n\nAn unseemly brawl over whether the article should name him \"Richard Kyanka\" or \"Richard Charles Kyanka\". At least the IP editors insisting on the insertion of the middle name provided good verifiable sources.\n\nIs it a collection of myths or a motif? Should \"Sun\" be capitalized or not? What about \"underworld\"? Edit warring here over these and other weighty issues have involved four editors and most of the article's history.\n\nThe Pope's title\n\nIs he the Supreme Pontiff or just the Bishop of Rome? Portal:Pope/Intro says the latter for a year and a half after its creation; then in December 2008 the reverts to \"Supreme Pontiff\" start, along with deletions of the \"Roman\" in \"Roman Catholic Church\", and continue in bursts from a number of different anons for several months until it's protected. Proof of lameness: a screenshot of the page's history is now the lead image at the edit warring page.\n\nTwo months of edit war on whether the page should say \"[[Harry S Truman|President Truman]]\" or \"President [[Harry S Truman]]\" (plus the same with several other presidents).\n\nShould the name of this Bollywood gangster film be Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Again, Once Upon a Time In Mumbaai Dobara, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobara, Once Upon a Time in Mumbai 2, Once Upon a Time in Mumbai Again, Once Upon a Time in Mumbai Dobaara!, Once Upon ay Time in Mumbaai Dobaara!, Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara!, Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!, or Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!? Not even the filmmakers seem to know. This hasn't stopped Wikipedians from moving the page 14 times between May and August 2013.\n\nIs this nearly extinct leopard subspecies \"tulliana\"? Or is it \"saxicolor\"? One editor apparently thinks the old name of \"saxicolor\" is the only valid one. Threatens to \"hack the page\", sic their \"IT team\" on it, and \"continue the edit war forever\" abound. Also refers to everyone who disagrees as \"racist\". Had 91 revisions to the article in three days, until finally semiprotected.\n\nFor decades regarded as a planet, it became a dwarf planet (as defined by the IAU) in 2006. Shortly after, it was duly assigned a minor planet number of 134340. Much contention ensued at the talk page about whether the article should be at 134340 Pluto or whether the disgraced planet should retain its simpler name (or, for that matter, whether to consider it a planet or not).\n\nThe Potrero Hills are \"a range of low hills on the western edge of Richmond, California\". They're pretty unremarkable; there happens to be a Chevron oil refinery there. But is it the \"Chevron Richmond refinery\" or the \"Chevron Richmond Refinery\"? An on-and-off edit war over this detail roils for months. After an exasperated (if excitable) administrator goes to the length of fully protecting the page, the war spills over onto Potrero Hill, San Francisco, where it is now being \"debated\" whether the disambiguation tag at the top should say \"For the Potrero Hills in Richmond, California, see Potrero Hills\" or \"For the bluffs in Richmond, California, see ...\" or \"For the minor mountain range ...\".\n\nIs Sega's 16-bit console the Genesis or the Mega Drive? Which one is the proper name for the article? Or should it be called the Sega Fourth Generation console? The article has been moved from one name to the other multiple times, there is an FAQ and a \"Falsehoods in the FAQ\" discussion on the issue, and the war has spilled over into Wikipedia talk:Article titles. The article currently sits at Sega Genesis, and reached featured article status in December 2013, so it looks like the debate is finally over ... at least until Megatron Mega Drive (which is obviously the correct article title), rises again ...\n\nIs Scotland a Constituent country (linking to constituent country), or a Country within a country (linking to constituent country), or a Country (linking to constituent country), or Country (linking to country), or a Semi autonomous subdivision of the United Kingdom, or a Semi autonomous constituent subdivision of the United Kingdom, or a Semi autonomous subdivision of the United Kingdom, or a Home Nation, or a Nation, or a Kingdom, or a Part, or a Province, or a Region, or a combination of any of the above, or none of the above?\n\nThere have also been similar edit wars on pages about England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Following in the fine tradition of truly Lame edit wars, the conflict has spilt over into unlikely places – for example, cities twinned with Scottish cities have had flag icons repeatedly switched between the Union Jack and that of Scotland, with collateral damage seen on Colin McRae and Chris Hoy (whose page during the 2008 Olympics saw both the Union Jack being removed/added from nationality and switching between being British and Scottish).\n\nWhat name should Wikipedia give to the article about the railway station in London from which direct international passenger trains depart? Should it be primarily given the historic, shorter, simpler and everyday \"St Pancras\" or the (mostly) official, longer, more formal and more descriptive \"St Pancras International\"? Should the UK convention of calling a railway station \"X railway station\" be overturned in favour of \"X station\"? For that matter, as \"St\" is an abbreviation, should it have a full stop (I'm not joking)? All rather lame as they all redirect to the article and the two most popular variations are bolded in the lead anyway. Multiple moves and a stupidly long, long, long talk page court case (complete with \"exhibit A\" and various chums) ensued. As of 2011, the feud seems to have quelled for the time being.\n\nIs it \"Into\" or \"into\"? A simple capitalized letter led to, as xkcd neatly summed up, \"Forty thousand words of debate\", before suggesting the \"compromise\" solution of \"~*~ StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNeSs ~*~\". Here's what the horrifying talk page looked like when the xkcd comic was published. A summary of the results was necessary to keep things sane. And that's over three months before the film's opening. Starfleet representatives have neglected to comment.\n\nShould articles for U.S. state routes use the format \"State Route xx\" or \"Route xx (State)\" or something else (where xx is the route number)? There were numerous edit battles and huge debates over official terms versus common vernacular and over uniformity versus state individuality. Some advocated for the pipe tricked version while others preferred full string method of disambiguation. This skirmish raged on for about a full year between roadfans, members of the U.S. Roads WikiProject, regular editors, and administrators, resulting in a few probations and even a song. The debate was finally settled with a poll after three previous naming convention \"conventions\" (#1, #2, #3) failed to resolve the conflict. In the end, the \"State Route xx\" format prevailed by a small margin. All the state route articles in the United States have been grandfathered into this format. Apparently the fourth try's the charm! An account of the entire war and eventual peace agreement is found here.\n\nFor this CD by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, a dispute about whether \"outta\" should be capitalized spawned lengthy threads on the admin noticeboard, as well as accusations of abuse, and page protection. Arguments focus on whether \"Outta\" is a preposition, whether it's relevant that it's not shorter than five letters, and whether the way the title is spelled on the actual CD is more important than our manual of style. Until a naming convention change, Straight Outta Lynwood may be SOL (or SoL).\n\nWhen a vandal struck and a good user reverted all but one of their edits, an edit war ensued over whether Cornelius was nicknamed \"The Ass\" or not. Another good user stopped the short edit war by adding a comment about the missed vandalism.\n\nThat odd little reptile from New Zealand, no wait, it's a diapsid, no it's a reptile, no it's a higher animal, reptile again, higher animal again, reptile once more... an amniote (??) The drama unfolds ... but the tuatara itself just doesn't care. Oh yes I do!\n\nMust a queen deceased for over a century still be styled here \"Her Majesty\", an epithet conventionally reserved for the current monarch? This weighty dispute (pale reflection of warring here), filling talk pages and edit histories, has spilled over into other British monarchs, other royals and titleholders, several countries having or having had a monarchy, claimants and other royal pretensions, and even hundreds of holders of the papacy, where popes centuries dead are endorsed as \"His Holiness\" here, losing and regaining the endorsement with blinks of eyes. Ongoing debates deal with the format of dates, and the used or unused, existing or non-existent surnames family names house names former fiefs (some inherited names, but very few are sure what they precisely are) of monarchs and relatively unfamiliar variants of those (as well as the putative name of the horse of her late majesty's husband's family), with most edits being extremely trivial. Involved parties vouch for only aiming at accuracy, and certainly some argumentation goes deeper than believed humanly possible. This even created an edit war over whether it could be mentioned here. A truce, seemingly imposed by a Royal intervention that dragged in innocent bystander Prince Michael of Kent, Scottish accents and snail slime, appears to be holding, though occasionally some new fallout is being generated.\n\nPet views on royalty again, mostly the same parties warring – but this time, aligned contrariwise. Could an American woman who made an ex-king her catch keep the title she was bestowed by the marriage … or is the \"she stole our king\" attitude a sufficient reason to revert her (posthumously) back to her second husband's surname, Wallis Simpson? See how contrary POVs enter the debate: persons who had wanted “majesties” and “highnesses” used in each minor royal's articles arguing to strip an American girl of her only nobility title, and chivalrous Americans fighting to the metaphorical death in defense of a countrywoman's entitlement. An interesting point has been whether it is fatal or not that she married her Duke after his abdication, and this relates to various and sundry Austrian, Russian, and Romanian monarchies lost, as well as to her sisters-in-law and also to Fergie (no, not that Fergie or the other Fergie).\n\nIs this article about \"Wii\" or \"Nintendo Wii\"? If it's \"Wii\", should it be called just \"Wii\" or \"the Wii\"? Or maybe \"Nintendo's Wii\"? Does it rhyme with \"We\" or \"Wee\"? Should \"Wee\" link to urine? Is \"Wee\" slang or a euphemism for urine? Is it a British or International word for urine? Is it even worth mentioning in the article at all? (not to mention \"wee\" as a synonym for \"small\", or \"diminutive\") Just some of the hard-hitting issues that provoked in excess of 1500 edits in the space of two weeks – long before the console was even released, and shortly before a massive war breaks out over \"non-official external links\" that leads to a huge strawpoll to end the issue, and continuing debates over whether the official or unofficial names of the console (according to official Nintendo policy, the console is called the \"Wii\", not \"Nintendo Wii\") and its accessories (for example, the \"Wii Remote\" aka \"Wii-mote\" aka \"Wiimote\") are more commonly used and which ones should be mentioned in which articles.\n\nWas this the name of one King of England and also of some totally obscure minor characters in the mists of history – or was it actually the name of two important and well-known Protestant Heads of State, etc? That became the object of a dispute over a redirect. This vital question divided a bunch of eminent readers of history and led to a revert war that alternated the redirect almost every hour. Casual viewers were holding their breath when coming to check what was the current position of that weathervane. As the name's usage in English-speaking cultures was perceived to be the determining factor, there were attempts to almost hand-count English-speakers in New Zealand, South Africa, etc. – all apparently using the hallowed name in a certain way. Extensive and in-depth arguments in several talk pages and usertalk pages included claims of original primary authorship of a redirect as well as accusations of nationalistic POV, filibustering and \"using all the tricks in the box\". This teaches us some things about disambiguation pages and potential problems surrounding even such tools. A formal poll resulted in votes 9–5 in favor of renaming the disambiguation page as simply William of Orange, and most fallout is being settled.\n\nThere was an animal that was also referred to as William of Orange, but fortunately it is a pigeon, an animal that generally symbolizes peace, so the edit war and participants did not harm this unlucky pigeon (and also the fact that it was the only non-human called William of Orange on Wikipedia as of this edit war).\n\nMany post offices in the United States are known as \"U.S. Post Office, Podunk Branch\" – unless of course that should really be \"United States\" and not \"U.S.\" Which one is better? More accurate? More respectful? (Respectful?) Resolving this involved an edit war that dragged in sources ranging from the National Park Service to the U.S. United States Congress. Whoa nelly Nellie.\n\nInvolving other languages\n\nBolzano-Bozen or Bozen-Bolzano\n\nThis city in North Italy has two official names, Bolzano and Bozen, which are used together on street signs and the like. Should the article be under Bolzano, Bozen, Bolzano-Bozen, Bolzano (Bozen), or Bozen-Bolzano? Surely one of these Italian-German German-Italian names is English usage; or should we try Botzen? Or Bolzano-Bozen-Bulsan-Bocen-Boceno-Bolzan-Bauzanum-Bocenas-Bulsaun-Bolzanu-Buzzanu? This has spread to several talk pages; highlights so far include the two separate move requests from Bozen-Bolzano to Bolzano-Bozen (or was it the other way around?).\n\nDanzig? Gdańsk? Gdanzig? Dańsk? Dgadnazńisgk? Gdanzsikg? Edit wars have been occurring for most of Wikipedia's history with regards to the exact name of this Polish German Prussian Eastern Central Northern European Baltic city. The edit war is so notorious that it is mentioned in the April Fools 2006 \"Wikipedia's first IRC chat\" log. The edit war was detailed in a chapter of a book. Perhaps ironically, the city hosted Wikimania 2010.\n\nIs it important to know that Korea has been preparing to officially register the name \"Ulleung Basin\"? The ocean feature is known both under the Japanese name Tsushima basin and under the Korean name Ulleung basin. There is also lots of disagreement which name is the more commonly used name in English for a place that pretty much nobody knows. (Also see the related lame edit war for the Land making up Tsushima subprefecture below and the related edit war concerning the Liancourt Rocks above.)\n\nDoes this university have a Latin name, Universitas Sidneiensis, and should it appear in the infobox? Is checking old book stamps in the university library's store rooms \"original research\" or even \"research\"? Is the evidence for the name from a primary source or a secondary source? The battle eventually fizzled when everyone stopped caring.\n\nIn Swiss Standard German, \"ss\" is used in place of the ligature \"ß\". So should the German name use \"Fußball\" or \"Fussball\"? Despite the fact that even the German version of the page wasn't consistent, many editors were convinced that they knew best, and the edit war still lives on. See also Voßstraße below.\n\nEdit war over which name to use: Voßstrasse, Vossstrasse, or even Voss strasse or Voss-strasse. The lengthy, unproductive discussions involve legibility, respect of original spelling, a wide variety of silly name callings, an ANI thread, a call to arms, two separate AfD debates, a short move war and Der Spiegel ranking it among the five most absurd Wikipedia debates. See also 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nShould a tropical cyclone that formed on December 30, 2005 and lasted until January 6, 2006 (Tropical Storm Zeta) be placed in the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season article? This has happened only one known time before, so there obviously isn't any already-existing consensus. The debate eventually explores the terms of hurricane season, how long it lasts, why hurricane followers are so tied to the concept of a hurricane season, and even whether a stapler moved from one desk to another is considered to be on the other desk. It was a truly stunning debate that spanned seven months, drew comparisons to civil unions and gay marriage, and could restart at any moment. (January 2006 edit history) Also, why isn't the section title named 2005 Atlantic hurricane season or Tropical Storm Zeta?\n\nDoes a storm forming before June 1 mean the whole season becomes considered as having begun, when the official warning centre (National Hurricane Center) says otherwise and that it \"begins June 1st\"?\n\nEdit war over whether she was born in 1961 or 1963, settled at 1961 after some damning evidence was found.\n\nWas it released in 1988, or '89? Was it released straight to video before hitting the theaters? If so, does that count?\n\nWas this watch released in 1989, or 1991 as the name suggests?\n\nWas this band officially formed in 1996 or 1998?\n\nShould we or should we not list the birth of Jesus of Nazareth under \"births\"? If so, should his birth date be 1 BC or 1 AD? Or 1 BCE or 1 CE? Or even year zero? And should it be listed as Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus Christ, just Jesus, etc.?\n\nWas she born in 1991 or 1992? After years of being born in 1991, her publicist slips up and accidentally mentions she is 13 years old (in 2005), and all hell breaks loose.\n\nBorn in 1969 or 1970? Even after a detailed explanation in the age fabrication article for 1969 was provided, many were still sure it was 1970.\n\nEarly in Wikipedia history, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth (or pecked seed from the bottom of their cages), Jimbo recorded his own birthdate in the annals of the Wikimedia Foundation as well as the article talk page. Then, in 2007, he changed his mind and used oversight tools to \"unsign\" his original edits. An edit war ensued over original research and whether Jimbo should be allowed to revoke his announcement of his own birthday, resulting in not one, but four secondary sources being tacked on to the date.\n\nOngoing arguments and edit wars over whether to include the word \"Friday\" in the date of the event.\n\nWas she born in 1921? Or 1923? (This also came about as a result of age fabrication) After days of editing, does anyone really care THAT much?[32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]\n\nWas their independent EP The Ingredients released in 1989 or 1990?\n\nDid they release their independent EP Wildcard in 1988, 1989 or 1992? A user claims that it was recorded in 1989, but hadn't been released until 1992. Is there any evidence whether it was officially released before or after the other EP A Word from the Wise? The band has a compilation named Wildcard/A Word from the Wise, which contains both of the EPs, so does that mean that Wildcard was actually released before A Word from the Wise?\n\nDid the band form in 1981 or 1982? Some sources (like Metal-Archives.com) list 1981 as the date, but the booklet of the box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse says they formed in 1982.\n\nWas this Bad Religion album officially recorded and released in 1987 or 1988? The details on their official website claims 1987 as the date, but the CD release actually printed 1988 as the release date and the liner notes on the album also reads April 1988 as the recording date.\n\nWas he born in 1951 or 1952? The problem comes from the fact that a single biography says 1952 while hundreds of fans from a fan site say 1951. One expert vs. hundreds of amateurs. Who's right, David or Goliath?\n\nShould a year appear as 2009 or 2009? Six months of edit warring goes through three requests for comment and culminates in a full arbitration case. The Arbitration Committee even finds it necessary to enact a temporary injunction. The 6-month arbitration case ends with 19 principles, 47 findings of fact, and 32 remedies.\n\nWas he 7'1\" (216 cm)? 7'4\" (224 cm)? 6'10\" (208 cm)? Was his height even consistent during his entire career? Is this in reference to his actual height or the height which promoters billed him at? Did his actual height decrease in his final years due to the effects of acromegaly or due to back surgery? He was tall, just leave it at that.\n\nIs the city's climate subtropical or continental? Are there a couple snowstorms a year, or several? Do some winters bring less than an inch of snow, or only a trace? How often does it get below 10 °F (−12 °C) or, for that matter, 5 °F (−15 °C), or even 0 °F (−18 °C)? Is January's average low 29 or 23 °F (−2 or −5 °C)? And just which weather station most accurately describes Baltimore's climate? These seemingly easily verifiable facts have been the subject of a slow-motion edit war for many months, with occasional language-parsing jockeying for position (for example, \"However, winter warm fronts can bring brief periods of springlike weather, while Arctic fronts drop temperatures into the teens\" vs. \"However, winter warm fronts can bring periods of springlike weather, while Arctic fronts can briefly drop temperatures into the teens\") continuing to this day.\n\nNever mind what the airport's web site says, our nationalist pride is more important! Let's crank up those numbers! (Also seen on Toronto Pearson International Airport, Kochi, and many others.)\n\nLet's inflate the earnings of our films, and deflate the earnings of everyone else's. But wait, they're doing the same thing. Can anyone tell the real story? (See the histories for individual films, such as Paglu, Shotru, Khokababu, etc.)\n\nListed at 5'3\" (160 cm), admits to being taller. Is he really 5'5\" (165 cm)? Or 5'6\" (168 cm)? Is an uncited claim valid for the latter? Sockpuppeting follows over a matter of one inch.\n\nEvery so often, tempers flare up over the bot-created \"demographic statistics\" added to the encyclopedia back in the Dark Ages (2002, to be exact) and the \"Wikipedia = The Story of Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody\" stance adopted by many editors towards actually fixing these entries when the information is not exactly useful to readers. For instance, do we need to know the median income in this town has been $66,250? Is it original research to write \"3\" instead of \"50% of 6\"? In response to the sentence \"For every 100 females there were 88.9 males\", one editor's eloquent statement says it all: \"there are SEVENTEEN PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE, for fuck's sake\"! And that's based on the 2000 Census; imagine how much more anachronistic and awkward these \"statistics\" would be were they to be based on Chicken's 2010 Census population of seven! Speaking of which, see also Prudhoe Bay, Alaska: while nowhere near as lame, edit warring dragged on in that article for years for pretty much the exact same reason. Ironically, settling the issue in that case resulted in effective abandonment of the article prior to the 2010 Census, in which the community's population mysteriously soared from just five in the year 2000, to 2,174. And if all this didn't drive home the point enough, here's what one editor had to say about Port Clarence, Alaska back in 2005: \"What's the point of saying there are 2000 males for every 100 females, if there's only 21 people in all? Why not just tell the truth – there is one woman, 20 men?\" Sadly, no known edit wars ensued from that statement. We have learned two things, however: Alaska has a number of underpopulated communities, and the manner in which many underpopulated communities are portrayed on Wikipedia is truly lame. But can they be called underpopulated if Alaska as a whole is sparsely populated?\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that Larry was a Category 5 storm on the Australian tropical cyclone scale (the one that matters with respect to Larry) ... but what about the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale? Was it a Category 3? Category 4? Category 5 perhaps? Soon after Larry made landfall in Queensland, Australia, edit warring broke out and the talk page became filled with personal attacks and egos.\n\nIs it 120 km (75 mi) or 160 km (99 mi) in diameter? Even 900 km (560 mi)? How shall they word that? Is the hyperdrive class three or four? Who really cares? George Lucas apparently doesn't. Sure, HE's not the one stuck with the life-or-death decision of picking the right caliber torpedo to blow it up. But to a Rebel pilot, it's very important! This is war, after all.\n\nBefore it became a featured article in July 2014, for four and a half years tempers flared over this article. Not surprising, considering all the controversial topics in play: their disputed status between the UK and Argentina, their naming as Falkland or Malvinas, coastal, fishing, and mineral rights, a reasonably recent war, et cetera, et cetera. But who would have guessed that the most controversial issue would be whether to list distances with miles first and kilometres second, or vice versa?\n\nAugust 2005 edit war asking: who finished third in the 1930 FIFA World Cup? The United States? Yugoslavia? For a year before the Football World Cup 2006, and persisting after, this subject gives involved users something to pass the time.\n\nThe infobox lists the four top scorers with five goals each: Forlán, Müller, Sneijder, Villa. Or was it Müller, Villa, Sneijder, Forlán? List in alphabetical order, or in order of FIFA's Golden Boot award where assists and playing time are tie-breakers? The fight continues more than a year after the players went home. Couldn't one of them just have scored another goal and saved us the trouble?\n\nHow big is that hard disk drive, exactly? Discussion on this point took over 160,000 bytes (or over 156 kibibytes), with the page being locked for days at a time [38] [39] while this was resolved. Not that you can now figure out how a hard drive works from this article, in spite of all the editorial effort expended.\n\nIs the 45th POTUS Donald Trump, 6'3\" (191 cm) or 6'2\" (188 cm)? Should it be noted that his height is disputed? A long-running dispute that has been occurring since the 2016 election has involved several registered users and IPs. Unfortunately, it seems that this debate over one inch is not going to be settled soon, and only his hairdresser knows for sure. In December 2019 it received the crowning glory of edit war lameness: media attention, as Gizmodo pronounced it \"The Dumbest Wikipedia Edit War of The Dumbest Decade\".\n\nShould 4G be included when referring to LTE even though it technically does not meet 4G requirements?\n\nHere's a penny for your thoughts: should our given retail price for this video game console, US$399.99, be rounded to the nearest dollar and listed as $400, despite being technically incorrect and sources stating otherwise? A smaller dispute also erupted over which prices should be displayed, at all.\n\nIs he 5'2\" (157 cm)? 5'3\" (160 cm)? 5'5\" (165 cm)? Did he debut at 5'4\" (163 cm) and later grow to be 5'5\" (165 cm)? Is he actually 5'6\" (168 cm)? Should the official WWE website be taken as accurate despite its common practice of increasing heights and weights for entertainment purposes? What about heights as they appear in video games? This edit war, which was strongly contested due to the many conflicting sources, led to the bizarre compromise of listing his height at 5'4½\" (163.8 cm) with the text \"We have come to a compromise between 5'2\" [157 cm] and 5'5\" [165 cm].\" thus throwing out all sources and making a claim based on middle ground rather than accuracy ... which, as of 9 February 2008, has been supplanted by 5'6\" (168 cm) again.\n\nAre they 8–12 years old? 9–12? 10–12? 8–13? Even 17 years old? Webster says something different from Oxford. American Dictionary says otherwise. And what is the deal with people typing in all caps?\n\nIs the Bee Gees recording 120 beats per minute, 103, 104 or something else? Should we also mention the Queen song \"Another One Bites the Dust\" for the same reason? Don't rely on Wikipedia to do CPR properly.\n\nDrawn-out revert wars over the correct heights and weights of fictional characters such as Ken Masters and Balrog are ultimately solved by leaving the statistics off entirely. Should the full names of characters be used, or the abbreviations? Let's not get into the Vega/M. Bison/Balrog naming mess.\n\nIs Kurt Angle the first champion, or is Christian Cage? When the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was withdrawn from TNA by the NWA, did TNA recognize the physical title as the TNA World Title, or did Angle win nothing when he took the belt from Cage? Is Angle in his first, or second title reign? And a discussion on various wrestling writers and webmasters and whose opinion is better than the other's there, too.\n\n7500. Four simple numbers that got an add/remove/add/remove/consensus-add/remove-anyway/ADD edit war ongoing, in slow-motion and, perhaps, still ongoing on this page. What caused all the \"squawk\"ing? The fact that 7500 is the emergency code you put in a transponder when your aircraft has been hijacked. Although the code is public information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration and available in any student pilot's manual to be grabbed off the shelf, IP editors keep removing it from the article. Because, apparently, would-be hijackers use Wikipedia as their only source of information on aircraft, and would recognise the code when the pilot entered it, whereas it could be entered without recognition otherwise, or so the IPs claim. One even left an edit summary saying \"Deleted reference to hijack code for secutity [sic] reasons. (Yes – I know it's available other places ...)\". Consensus keeps the code on the page, joined (after yet another well-meaning IP removed the code) by an admin admonishment in an editnotice.\n\nWas the attendance of the event in question 78,000 or 93,178 – or is it really 75,500? Is Dave Meltzer an unreliable source because he is personally anti-McMahon? Is McMahon an unreliable source because he is pro-McMahon? Should Meltzer be considered a reporter because he freelances for the LA Times and Sports Illustrated, or as a self-published hack who runs a tabloid? Either way, this has led to a lot of tears and an eight-month-long edit war.\n\nAnd because all wrestling feuds deserve a disappointing rematch, a nearly identical dispute erupted regarding the true attendance for this WWE event, which may or may not have set the all-time record for a particular sports arena that had existed for four years. The debate included insults, blocks, and an editor arguing that Dave Meltzer is not a reliable source for Dave Meltzer. Also included was the question of whether a statistic ending in 7 can be trusted. It ended with the WWE's claim being left alone for now, until the next exciting installment of Editmaaaaania!\n\nJust how tall is this famous Chinese basketball player?\n\nSpelling\n\nResearchers and producers of element 13 have variously called the stuff \"alumine\", \"alumium\", \"aluminium\", and \"aluminum\". Speakers and writers of American and Canadian English spell it \"aluminum\" (as does the ACS). The non-American English-speaking world spells it \"aluminium\" (as does the IUPAC), which is where the article typically stands – with two letters i. There are occasional attempts to put the word back to aluminum. See here and here for the gory historical details. As a gauge of the scale of this territorial feud, the talk page specifically devoted to this debate is over 40,000 words of um/ium debate.\n\nWas her radio hit from her debut album, Let Go, spelled \"I'm With You\", or was it spelled \"I'm with You\"? Intense edit warring ensued, and continues, over this contentious matter. Many personal attacks and a request for page protection were also included.\n\nEditors constantly change spellings of the country name to Brasil, because this is the local name of the country. But since both pronunciations have the same sounding as z, but the correct spelling in Portuguese is s, Brazilians/Brasilians consider the z spelling an error. There have been heated debates about the spelling, saying it is American imperialism. Example of wild discussions of this topic here.\n\nIs it \"jerkwad\" or \"jerk wad\"? Made it to AN3 [40].\n\nColor or Colour\n\nMany editors have made corrections to this word, even though both versions are technically correct. Much like honor/honour, program vs programme. Toe-may-toe, toe-MAH-toe.\n\nCougar and Cheetah\n\nShould \"Cougar\" be capitalized? What better time to revert-war over this all-important issue than on June 11, 2007, when it is Today's Featured Article? The war over capitalization erupts again a few months later, this time simultaneously in Cougar and Cheetah, and leads to full protection of both articles.\n\nShe writes it as danah boyd. Some say that the official style guidelines say it should be written Danah Boyd; others say they allow for exceptions for the subject's personal preferences. Are the extant references using all-lowercase sufficient and sufficiently independent to allow the style guide exemption? Or are scientific publications by her and her colleagues biased and not admissable references? Cue extensive edit (and rename) warring ...\n\nThis Soviet Ukrainian film director is an example of wars over whether the first name of Ukrainians should be Olexandr instead of Russian Aleksandr or international Alexander.\n\nIn addition to the debate over whether or not it is \"actually\" a number, the page has seen a pagemove controversy between whether the article's title begins with the letter \"E\" or the symbol \"℮\" (which resembles the letter \"e\") due to technical limitations on article names versus a desire to avoid having to tag the article as {{wrongtitle}} or {{lowercase}}.\n\nNative species in North America where the dominant spelling is gray. Invasive species in the United Kingdom where they call it grey. Nationalistic tempers simmer for two years in slow and remorseless edit war after a content request for comment supposedly settles the issue in favour of the Americans. Dissatisfied Brits continually tiptoe back, changing a to e, without ever actually proposing a title change for the article. The British are coming! The British are coming! To arms!\n\nOne \"n\" or two letters \"n\"? Filling up many talk pages and much time. In the discussion, an editor gripes that \"it REALLY DOESN'T MATTER what the actual name of the article is\".\n\nIt was Constantinople, but is it now Istanbul or İstanbul? A few editors make nuclear war over a small speck above the I, bringing new meaning to the word iota. (Let's just hope this doesn't get the Christians and Muslims fighting all over again.)\n\nMetre or Meter\n\nThrough out the article's life there have been a total of three official move discussions to move the article from its current spelling Metre to Meter. These arguments have also often been made by misinterpreting guidelines or making up ones that don't exist . For example an unofficial move discussion in 2017 was made because using British English was apparently against WP:NPOV and made Wikipedia look unprofessional.\n\nA cut-and-paste move to the American spelling \"color\". A move back, and statements that Canada, Australia, and the rest of the colour-spelling world didn't matter because the United States spelled it color. Other attempts follow, with one attempt to move it to simply Orange to end the war. Similar wars over the correct spelling of the word \"colo[u]r\" have happened far more times than anybody cares to count.\n\nAccording to the article on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, \"Pittsburgh is one of the few American cities to be spelled with an h at the end of a burg suffix. From 1890 to 1911 the city's h was removed but, after a public campaign, it was officially restored by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\" In the course of describing an event, namely Merkle's Boner, dated 1908, an author used the \"Pittsburg\" spelling when mentioning the Pirates' baseball team. A subsequent editor decided that this was a mistake, and changed it back to \"Pittsburgh\". Thus is created a cycle in which someone notes the edit history and reinserts the contemporary spelling, and the next editor assumes simple stupidity of the last and adds back the h. This new version of Merkle's Boner makes Pittsburg(h) the ping-pong capital of Wikipedia, and we will likely never get the \"h\" out of here.\n\nShould a short shwa sound that almost nobody actually pronounces anymore in the plural form of this word be represented in the transliteration by an \"e\"? What about the one in the abstract \"psak/pesak din\" that people will naturally say whether the \"e\" is there or not? More than a dozen reverts both ways, two page protections later, and over ten pages of debate on the talk page, this question of immense import remains without consensus. At one point, The Great Apostrophe Compromise (\"pos'kim\" and \"p'sak din\") was proposed, but following its rejection as \"[the] most rificulous idea\", the \"e\"less status quo remains.\n\nShould potato chips be flavored or flavoured? What is the provenance of the potato chip, America or Ireland? Four-user revert war on these important issues results in the page getting protected and listed on RfC. As a compromise, the chips became seasoned. And are they not talking about crisps, anyway?\n\nMuch time has been spent on if the name of the wolf deity in the series should be spelled Holo or Horo. Beginning in January 2008, the war still continues eight years later into 2016. Sources have been provided for the spelling as Holo, but this continuously gets changed back to Horo due to popularity of the spelling in the anime fandom community. A lengthy discussion has occurred on the issue which would even make your Engrish teacher faint.\n\nSulfur or Sulphur\n\nShould it be spelled the American or the British way? While the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has ruled in favor of the American spelling, both variants make appearances in IUPAC's literature. It's still occasionally possible to find alternating spellings of Sulphur and Sulfur throughout the text of the Wikipedia article.\n\nA Japanese author with a habit of inventing \"foreign\" names whose spellings harken more to H. P. Lovecraft than anything in English creates a group of characters called the vaizādo. The term is supposed to be some word in English, but nobody's quite sure what. Should Wikipedia refer to them by the archaic and wrongly pronounced but fan-favorite vizard, or by the grammatically awful but officially supported visoreds? Editors take the official line; thousands of IPs disagree! The article is eventually semi-protected, but it doesn't stop edit wars over the spelling on the dozen-odd other pages in which it appears.\n\nYoghurt or Yogurt\n\nDoes it need the 'h'? Is \"Yoghurt\" the \"traditional\" spelling, and is it American cultural imperialism to not have it as such?[41] Apparently, the \"correct\" spelling is worth fighting for – again and again and again. And again. Et cetera. For over eight years, before an RFC restored Truth and Justice to dairy products; for more news, see Strained yoghurt (or is that strained yogurt)?\n\nThe first time around, this controversy spawned a thread on ANI and led to a wheel war over a block placed due to a move of the page. Later occurrences involved arguments over the meaning of \"stable\" in the context of WP:ENGVAR, competing interpretations of WP:MOS, suggestions that editors should really not care so much about spelling variations, and LOTS of Google page counts. This active cultural war re-fermented in November 2003, June 2004, November 2004, May 2005, February 2006, October 2006, April–May 2007, June 2009, July 2009 (which spilled over into this ANI report), and again in November–December 2011, which then produced yet another ANI report and an edit war (with added full page protection and unprotection) over whether or not to close another requested move so soon after the last one. [42] [43] Fortunately, Wikipedians realised that after wars get boring on one page, you can continue it on another page, leading to discussions on whether the requested moves process should be changed to allow a rename to Yoghurt. Or maybe to change WP:CREEP to allow a change to the requested move policy to allow the article to be moved. There was even a heated debate and edit war about the article's entry on this page. Apparently, some people don't know when to get the \"H\" out of there... or not.\n\nPunctuation\n\nA slow-moving edit war that centred over the use of ... an exclamation mark. As User:C12H22O11 exclaimed on the talkpage talk page, \"Come on guys, you can't actually be having an edit war over one tiny exclamation point!\" (Which of course would have been better punctuated as \"Come on, guys: you can't actually be having an edit war over one tiny exclamation point!\") There is also the matter that the \"of course\" in \"Which of course\" should be set off by commas, making it: \"(Which, of course, would have been better punctuated as ...)\" And we haven't even touched the unnecessity of the colon after \"making it\", as well (aswell?) as the missing period after the sentence. While we are at it, should it be punctuated as ...).\", or punctuated as ...)\".? And is \"unnecessity\" even a word? The possibilities are endless infinite endless (infinite) infinite (endless) endless-infinite Endless Infinite NEVER MIND.\n\nFrequent edit wars over whether there are spaces around the en dash when writing a person's date of birth and death.\n\nExample: (January 24, 1943 – August 9, 1969) or (January 24, 1943–August 9, 1969)? Related edit war over whether the month or the date comes first, e.g. 1 July or July 1, despite the fact that display preferences can be set to provide for either regardless of the wikicode placing. (The title of this section is not a hyperlink because this is a very general lame edit war which actually happened on several different articles!)\n\nAn edit war over spacing, which led to the article being protected.\n\nShould the ellipsis have three dots, or four? An edit war was not totally resolved when the article was renamed from the three-dot version to the four-dot version.\n\nNot quite punctuation, but the question nevertheless remains: should the discussion of Ms. Storm's arrest for DUI and subsequent no contest pleading be put in one paragraph or spread over two?\n\nHUUUGE edit war over line breaks vs commas in a list of genres. Leads to a WP:ANI case despite total irrelevance to anyone.\n\nAn edit war involving three sysops over whether there should be commas in \"10,000\" and \"1,000\" led to a blocking and liberal use of the rollback button. During Christmas, yet.\n\nThree-way edit war (or \"three way\" edit war depending on interpretation) over whether the phrase \"Fatal Four Way/Fatal Four-Way\" contains a hyphen. This riveting debate, so important that violations of WP:3RR occurred, resulted in the page being fully protected for a month with the protector declaring it the lamest edit war they had ever seen.\n\nOr should that be Russell T. Davies? Over the years, it's been moved three times to lose the dot, and then moved back three times due to \"article naming conventions\". An administrator moved it to regain that all-important(?) dot, and then immediately move protected it. Doctor Who fans are not to be trifled with, so two separate complaints against admin abuse were duly lodged. As it currently stands, the article has been moved back to the form without a dot.\n\nHow many students does the school have, 1,019 or 1019, and does \"(With all one's might)\" belong in the school's motto?\n\nIs the usage of dash and hyphen between \"Mexican\" and \"American\" more important than the disagreements which led to this historic struggle? Some people would think so. This led to a long thread on WP:AN and a topic ban proposal for no fewer than six editors, as well as the essay Wikipedia:Short horizontal line. The action at WP:AN may be seen as the lamest part of the whole affair so far, since it involved an attempt to swat every editor within the perimeter (peacemakers and seekers-after-order included) with a topic ban! That thread is now closed, as an elaborate joke that got out of hand. But fans need not fret: Jarndyce and Jarndyce II continues at WT:MOS, with clowns for the amusement of all. Merchandise is available in the foyer. One recent suggestion was to change the name to \"Mexican War\" and be done with it. A move request for Battles of the Mexican–/—American War ran for six weeks, opening with the fatal words \"I hope this will be an uncontroversial request\".\n\nThe band is/are a collective noun\n\nOne difference between British and American English that seems to especially enrage editors is the treatment of collective nouns in articles about musical bands:\n\nAngels & Airwaves: Forty-six reverts in one hour by two editors. The point of contention? Whether \"Angels & Airwaves\" is a band or \"Angels & Airwaves\" are a band. (British English requires \"are\", as the band comprises multiple people, while American English requires \"is\", as the band is a singular entity.) ALL-CAPS edit summaries laced with profanity and death threats liberally employed by one side. Stopped only after admin intervention, but resumed again two minutes after the 3RR block expired. Both get blocked for seven days, and one of them gets his block extended to eight days after stating he doesn't care as long as the other side gets a block of the same length. The other side keeps his seven-day block. (Feb. 2006) A similar debate occurred at The Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers: A multi-day revert war over the proper conjugation of the verb \"to be\" in the first line of the lead. See [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. By the time we get to the next day, it has spread to the use of the definite article \"the\" in the same sentence: [49], [50]. Everyone talks with the authority of a grammarian. No one has any clue, quite obviously though. For non-English speakers this is particularly lame since the verb to be can be conjugated eight ways (am, is, are, was, were, be, been, being) – not fifty-plus as in most other Indo-European languages.\n\nU2: Is it \"U2 are\" or \"U2 is\"? Should the article be written in British English or changed to American English? A full page protection and several combined discussions later (including one on the Royal Family), the dispute over a single word still rages on.\n\nQuestions have arisen concerning the name of Lita's moves. Is it DDT, or Lita DDT? Hurricanrana or Litacanrana? Moonsault or Litasault? Powerbomb or Lita Bomb? Is the powerbomb even a finishing move, considering it's not used that often? Do you go by the games, by the announcers, or by WWE.com? After several arguments and many people exclaiming they will continue to change it back, a Fan Name section is created, listing the names fans have given her moves.\n\nNot so much an edit war as an editing armed standoff. Ask yourself: should this song be declared \"written one pluvious night\" or \"one rainy night\"? Ironically, \"one\" night was declared superior to the previous version, \"in a\" night. Pluvious actually won in a voting showdown, but when it was later changed back to rainy, nobody really cared.\n\nShould psychology or philosophy be the first link in the lede? An editor's fondness for the Philosophy Effect may influence their answer.\n\nJazz pianist had a career spanning decades and was father to two adopted sons. Wikipedians battle for years because at the end of the musician's life the coroner reported that he she Tipton he[unbalanced opinion?] was biologically female. A decade later, the edit war flared up again, this time around whether inclusion of his birth name would be considered deadnaming.\n\nEditors can't decide whether this venue is for-profit, or non-profit. Edit warring ensues.\n\nAn edit war surrounded the sentence \"Theological disputes about the correct interpretation of Christian teaching led to internal conflicts and Church authorities condemned some theologians as heretics, defining orthodoxy in contrast to heresy, the most notable being Christian Gnosticism.\" The questionable wording was the switching of the words \"orthodoxy\" and \"heresy\". The user preferring heresy before orthodoxy claimed grammatical accuracy and no meaning change. The user preferring orthodoxy before heresy claimed it completely changed the meaning of the sentence. This discussion can be found here.\n\nCleo was Kenny Everett's sidekick throughout the 1980s. But was she best known for this? Cue increasingly aggressive back and forth ([51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60]), semi-protection amid accusations of sockpuppetry, and the obligatory ANI thread. Perhaps she's now best known for edit warring. (See also David Gilmour for a similar theme – [61])\n\nDoes the Conch Republic, the name assumed by Key West when it \"seceded\" from the U.S. in 1982, qualify as a \"micronation\"? For months, an edit war has progressed over this burning question. Supporters say the name is still used in tourist promotions, while detractors say the \"Republic\" was a joke protest, and the \"Prime Minister\" surrendered one minute later. Others say micronationalism is an incredibly silly concept anyway.\n\nWas Cranky Kong the original Donkey Kong? Could it be the character in Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 games is actually his son? Or perhaps his grandson? Should we trust offhand comments made by a video-game character? Does being licensed by Nintendo make Rareware publications \"official\"? How official is the \"Nintendo Seal of Quality\"? To some people, these questions are a matter of life and death. (For the record, the Nintendo Seal of Quality was, as the name implies, a means of quality control related to the company's internal policy regarding third-party software. But it's still a lame edit war.)\n\nThere was a kerfuffle over several sentences on this page. Is a Danish pastry a \"variant of puff pastry\" or merely similar to it? Should you describe a picture of one as \"A typical Danish of Spandauer type with apple filling and glazing\" or \"A typical Spandauer-type Danish with apple filling and glazing\"? Whatever the case, tempers got so frayed the article and the talk page needed to be protected, until everyone calmed down and settled for a nice cup of tea and a ... oh, hang on ...\n\nOr daylight savings time. Or Daylight Saving(s) Time. Or Daylight-Saving(s) Time. You've never heard \"saving\" in the singular in your entire life? Send in the dualling (or is it duelling?) dictionaries. Either way, it's still dark at 7:00 AM and I'm tired.\n\nIs this comic produced by Curtis Magazines or by Marvel Comics? Should Marvel, which may or may not appear in the comic book (this can't be confirmed, for some reason) appear in the infobox, even though it already appears in the text of the article? People might not see it in the article, and will not read the article. Extensive coverage of this on the talk page.\n\nDerren was shown convincing former unbelievers to believe in god, or should that be \"God\", or "
