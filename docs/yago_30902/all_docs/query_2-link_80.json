        "text": "Our beloved mother, Theresa (Terri) Rose Halle, 91, of Indianapolis left to be with our Lord surrounded by family on July 29, 2024. Born February 2, 1933, in Manchester, New Hampshire to the late Lorenzo and Lillian (Bourque) Gauthier.\n\nAn avid learner, Terri graduated Valedictorian from St. Marie High School in 1951. She received her Bachelor of Science degree, Medical Technology in 1955 from Notre Dame College and had a successful career for over 28 years in the field of Hematology and Medical Technology at Community Hospital East – her long-term family in health care. She was a Hematologist and Blood Banker, taught hematology, urinalysis, coagulation at the Medical Technology School and for 8 years, was the Director the Hematology and Microbiology over 3 hospitals before she retired in 1995.\n\nAs she began her career, she counted red blood cells with a microscope - a skill set that faded with technology advancement. But Terri evolved with technology while making sure the staff was proficient and independent of automation – just in case the power went out! She helped implement the first robot that roamed the hallways picking up specimens to deliver to the lab. To ensure a sterile environment and protect her staff, she researched and implemented individual foot pedal operated hand washing units at each station. She was quite the innovator as she cared for each staff member’s career individually. She was respected greatly.\n\nIn her 91 years, she lived through the depression, food lines and helped care for her younger siblings. She experienced the retirement of radio waves and telephone operators, to rotary wall phones, handheld digital phones to mobile / cell phones. She navigated her way from TV antennae with black and white screens and manual controls across 4 stations, to video tape recorders to the internet / streaming. Always making sure she saved “that movie” to watch with child or grandchild. She walked to work, carpooled out of necessity, took the bus, and then learned to drive a car on her own making sure she taught other friends. Always a voracious learner, she mastered technology decade by decade\n\nTerri re-modeled a home inside out with her husband, John and created a swimming pool, playground home oasis for children, grandchildren and family / friends to gather. And she designed and oversaw, the building of her patio home on Willis Drive.\n\nShe saw change as good and was a continual learner. She was progressive and loved sharing her joy of learning with her family.\n\nThe foundation of her love grew with her childhood family. The oldest of 8 siblings, their influence in her life should all be mentioned. As time grew, we learned the imprint she had on each other’s lives was priceless, regardless of the age gap. Her love of her family was infectious and generous. She never missed an event or celebration, she’d send funnies from the funny papers, letters of love and encouragement along with the occasional surprise visit with presents galore. She loved everyone freely and unconditionally. She never judged and always encouraged growth through life experiences.\n\nOut of all the change and growth in this world, the most important to her was walking in love with family and friends. Known for the “stars in her eyes”, her cheerfulness was contagious. Her love of life, family and friends was evident for anyone graced with her presence. She was exceptionally creative (gardening, crocheting, crafting, cooking), and because of her passion for sports of all sorts (bowling, tennis, cheerleading, dancing), card games and casino’s, you could easily find her at many venues cheering or laughing loudly. She loved to share music as well and never missed an opportunity to dance, dance, dance and sing!\n\nTerri was married on May 18, 1957, to John T Halle for 53 years who preceded her in death. She is survived by her son, James (Karen) Halle, Cynthia (Scott) Rauch and Kathy Priest who shared a love that grew her family (her Tonys, Emmys and Oscars); grandchildren, Jessie, James, Amanda, Alex, Nick, Zach and Sara (her “fuzzies”); great-grandchildren Aiden, Korin, Joe, Lilly, Lauren, Charlie, and Brooks (her “2nd generation fuzzies”); niece, Patti (Mike) Kilgore, who was loved like a daughter; brother Paul (Mary) Gauthier, sisters Lillian (Robert) St. Germaine and Jackie (Norman) Chaput.\n\nMom’s mantra was “Thy will be done”; but, made it clear, she “had a lot of questions” for God when she saw Him. We smile as we remember her unique Faith, Love and Hope that she spread graciously.\n\nMemorial Gathering will be held from 4pm until 7pm, Thursday, August 15, 2024, at Flanner Buchanan – Oaklawn Memorial Gardens (9700 Allisonville Rd. Fishers, IN). A Memorial Service will be held at 11am, Friday, August 16, 2024, at Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church (9900 E. 191 Street Noblesville, IN 46060). Placement will follow the memorial service at Oaklawn Memorial Gardens Cemetery.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in Terri’s name to Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church, 9900 E 191st Street, Noblesville IN 46060 or to a charity of your choice."
