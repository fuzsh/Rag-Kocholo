        "text": "This is from a cemetery near my house‚Ä¶I keep it on my phone to remind myself and others that horrible people (d*cks) die. It is something I have been sending to friends, students, and mentees when times get tough and - in particular - someone has it out for you or is causing harm. I also look at it as a reminder. As we witness horrors in the world spread across every continent, it is worth mentioning that the worst of humanity makes up less than 1% of the total global population - yes many more people follow or support those people‚Äôs actions out of ignorance, arrogance, forgetfulness, and fear - with the exception of these horrible people ruining it for the rest of us, humankind is exactly that Human (with all our flaws and glory) and Kind (altruistic and caring) - after all Compassion is the underlying fabric of this reality. A key aspect of compassion that is overlooked is justice‚Ä¶and sometimes this alludes us in life - which makes compassion for ‚Äúthe other‚Äù challenging at best. There are many horrible people walking around, living a luxurious life, seemingly without consequences. But no one cheats death. Kissinger left a legacy‚Ä¶we can all agree on that. Even if you liked the man, I think we can agree this is a fitting description (no one will accuse him of being a great humanitarian). For the rest of us on this side of the dirt, a) I hope you remember this when you see wrong being done in the world and b) do right, advocate for justice, help your fellow human, stand up for good and against hate, no one wants to be remembered like this. Note: to the family that this belongs to, thank you for letting me use this to make a point. I hope your loved ones rest in peace. While they are Dicks by name, no one should accuse them of being actual üçÜ‚Äôs.\n\nWonderful story of the compassion shown to an injured eagle by helping it fly again... which makes me think about how much compassion is shown to an injured worker after a workplace incident. While getting the incident investigation done, dealing with the compensation claim, and dealing with the consequences of the incident, it's easy to lose sight of the losses the worker has experienced (or is experiencing)... lost wages, disengagement from their work environment, physical and psychological trauma caused by the incident, confusion & uncertainty of their recovery, and (in some workplaces) dealing with the blame placed on them for the incident. Although there are lessons to be learned (by all parties: employer, supervisors and workers) that lead to corrective measures and return-to-work planning, it's important not to forget the compassion that led many of us into this profession to begin with. The compassion that drives us to protect workers, assist injured workers, share stories of human loss to inspire others to support OHS, and continue \"fighting\" the good fight. In my humble opinion, compassion should always remain at the heart of OHS ‚ù§Ô∏è We can rewrite the narrative, transforming tragedy into triumph, despair into hope.\n\nThis conveys a deep message with lessons that are fit for the marble for all generations. The circumstances and inhuman narratives surrounding his life and now, his death are enough lessons for a Lavida-Loca and Ameno generation that is obsessed with mindless affluence and pleasure modelled on \"the end justifies the means\" philosophy. Such a demonic ideology! But sadly, our society and rather unfortunately, the world is given to pseudo philanthropy which comes handy for a disguise mechanism by unceremonious achievers. We celebrate strange achievements and are carefree about sources. Even when red flags are raised, do we even care to probe? All we care about is the lavishing demeanor. Lessons have continued to present for our learning even as the days get darker. Big question - Are we even learning?"
