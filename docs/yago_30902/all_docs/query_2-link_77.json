        "text": "Winter 2012 Joe, a senior at Trinity College, was just a few months away from entering the “real world” and enjoying his remaining moments of freedom. On just another Saturday, he was seeking a date to join him for a night of libations and revelry. After hearing through a mutual friend about a cute freshman, he decided to take a flyer and sent a poorly written text to a 203-number asking to join him for the party. Had he known at the time the recipient of that poorly written text would be his future wife, he probably would have crafted it more carefully. Said cute freshman, Charlotte, was still learning left from right about what it meant to be in college. She had established her core group of friends, the ones she remains closest with today, seemingly within minutes of arriving on Trinity’s campus. Never one to shy away from social interaction, Charlotte always knew how to play it cool, so when she received a text from a random 781-number inviting her to a frat party, she calmly accepted the senior boy's invitation. Spring 2019 Fast forward 7 years, and many things had changed since Joe and Charlotte shared that first evening together. Their lives had brought them to different places (Hartford, Boston, Paris, London, New York, and Hanover, to name a few), with Charlotte starting a career and settling down in New York City, and Joe never really settling down anywhere. Ever since that first night, they’ve been at each other’s sides, sharing good times and bad times together, growing up together, and falling in love together. The rest of their lives was built on a random text sent on a whim to a stranger asking her out. The too-cool-for-school senior and the cute freshman. It wasn’t supposed to turn into marriage, but it did, and they couldn’t be happier about it."
