Itty-Bitty Giant Steps will provide a venue for brain-injury survivors and caregivers to shout out their accomplishments of the week.\n\nIf you have an Itty-Bitty Giant Step and you would like to share it, just send an email to me at donnaodonnellfigurski@gmail.com.\n\nIf you are on Facebook, you can simply send a Private Message to me. It need only be a sentence or two. I’ll gather the accomplishments and post them with your name on my blog approximately once a week. (If you do not want your last name to be posted, please tell me in your email or Private Message.)\n\nI hope we have millions of Itty-Bitty Giant Steps.\n\nHere are this week’s Itty-Bitty Giant Steps.\n\nBeckie (caregiver) and Jerry…An Itty-Bitty Giant Step from a spouse’s viewpoint:\n\nI’m learning to ease off. He is still a man. He can do and think for himself – just differently. And when I do NOT micromanage, we both are better. (P.S. TBI still sucks.)\n\nJoyce Benavidez (survivor)…Today was the anniversary of my twin birth/death. Thanks to the wonderful support and encouragement I have on Facebook, I made it through my first year without a seizure.\n\nSara Catherine Birch (caregiver)…My husband managed several days last week without a daytime nap. Yesterday our daughter kept him from sleeping after a shopping trip, but he still managed to make it to bedtime without shouting at any of us. Very happy.\n\nJoey Buchanan (survivor)…I’m getting the leaves out of the pool.\n\nJoy Cameron (survivor)…I survived (LOL). It was a hell of a week, and I am still here, fighting and putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nNatalie Elliott (survivor)…Here’s my Itty-Bitty Giant Step: I survived Thanksgiving with family. I put the tree up, but I had to put it together four times because following a sequence is taxing and very difficult.\n\nDebbie Madison (survivor)…I survived Thanksgiving without killing my brother! And I had a great time!\n\nGena Marie (survivor)…I flew on an airplane for the first time and did OK. I never thought I would make it safely, but I did.\n\nJoshua Puckett (survivor)…Despite being engulfed by a lot of the flooding feelings this week, I was able to maintain calm throughout. I never went St. Helens. So progress. That’s my Itty-Bitty Giant Step.\n\nKimberly June West (survivor)…I went on a trip and didn’t have a panic-attack!!\n\nSandra Williams (survivor/caregiver)…I had a successful IEP (Individualized Education Program) meeting. I fought back so many flashbacks and tears. When it was over, the staff said they couldn’t even tell if I was nervous. I still battle negative thoughts, but I ate two meals today – so huge for me since I wasn’t eating but a few times a week!\n\nYOU did it!\n\nCongratulations to all contributors!\n\n(Clip Art compliments of Bing.)\n\nSurvivors SPEAK OUT! Joey Buchanan\n\nSPEAK OUT! – Joey Buchanan\n\nby\n\nDonna O’Donnell Figurski\n\n1. What is your name? (last name optional)\n\nJoey Buchanan\n\n2. Where do you live? (city and/or state and/or country) Email (optional)\n\nFlovilla, Georgia, USA Dekalbfd19@yahoo.com\n\n3. When did you have your TBI? At what age?\n\nDate of accident – July 18, 2012 Age at the time – 46\n\n4. How did your TBI occur?\n\nWe were overhauling at a house fire (which means searching for hidden fire). I was standing against a wall, when a full sheet of sheetrock (4 ft. x 8 ft.) fell from a vaulted ceiling, striking me on top of the head.\n\n5. When did you (or someone) first realize you had a problem?\n\nImmediately. I was told that I fell into the wall, then onto the floor. I was asked twice if I was okay. I don’t remember any of that. It broke and cut my nose, and I could feel the blood running down my face.\n\n6. What kind of emergency treatment, if any, did you have?\n\nNothing major – just a routine X-ray and a cat (CT) scan\n\n7. Were you in a coma? If so, how long?\n\nNo\n\n8. Did you do rehab? What kind of rehab (i.e., inpatient or outpatient and occupational and/or physical and/or speech and/or other)? How long were you in rehab?\n\nYes – cognitive therapy, emotional therapy, physical therapy, and vestibular therapy. I am waiting on a driving exam and endocrinology testing. I am currently in therapy.\n\n9. What problems or disabilities, if any, resulted from your TBI (e.g., balance, perception, personality, etc.)?\n\nI have difficulties with balance, decision-making, and reading and comprehension. I’m more emotional (crying and anxiety). I have headaches, dizziness, and tinnitus. My sorting skills and my ability to multitask (very important for a firefighter) have been affected. I experience depression, fatigue, and pains in my neck, hands, and feet. My motivation is a problem.\n\n10. How has your life changed? Is it better? Is it worse?\n\nThe mental and physical issues have been difficult. I went from working two fire-department jobs, homeschooling our daughter, and building a pool house to spending most of my time in bed, due to fatigue, depression, pain, and lack of motivation. My wife and daughter both say that I am much more easy-going. I tell them, “Well, yes. I am not working 120-plus hours per week.” (LOL)\n\n11. What do you miss the most from your pre-TBI life?\n\nMy other family at the fire department\n\n12. What do you enjoy most in your post-TBI life?\n\nTo be able (when I am able) to be home with my daughter, and the chance of starting a new chapter of my life\n\n13. What do you like least about your TBI?\n\nThe fatigue, the lack of motivation, and the pain\n\n14. Has anything helped you to accept your TBI?\n\nMy faith in God and the support of family and friends\n\n15. Has your injury affected your home life and relationships and, if so, how?\n\nIt has been a mixed bag in my home life. Although I am home, the majority of my time is spent in bed.\n\n16. Has your social life been altered or changed and, if so, how?\n\nYes. We don’t go to concerts, and we don’t go out to eat. I try to avoid crowds. This is all due to overstimulation and anxiety.\n\n17. Who is your main caregiver? Do you understand what it takes to be a caregiver?\n\nMy wife is my main caregiver. In some respects, I became her caregiver when she became ill in 2005.\n\n18. What are your future plans? What do you expect/hope to be doing ten years from now?\n\nI hope to recover as much as possible and to start a group that goes out and assists other first responders when they are injured and have to be home. In 10 years, I would like to be able to travel.\n\n19. Are you able to provide a helpful hint that may have taken you a long time to learn, but which you wished you had known earlier? If so, please state what it is to potentially help other TBI survivors with your specific kind of TBI.\n\nI want people to know that this injury will take much longer to recover from than they could ever imagine.\n\n20. What advice would you offer to other TBI survivors? Do you have any other comments that you would like to add?\n\nTry to keep emotions and stimulation to a minimum in the beginning – it will help in the long run. Find a support group – they have valuable knowledge. Doctors are not always as educated on TBI as they need to be. The sooner you can accept the “new normal,” the easier it will be. Don’t ever give up or stop trying. Find an advocate who will help you in your journey.\n\nThank you, Joey, for taking part in this interview. I hope that your experience will offer some hope, comfort, and inspiration to my readers.\n\n(Disclaimer: The views or opinions in this post are solely that of the interviewee.)\n\n(Photos compliments of Joey.)\n\nIf you would like to be a part of the SPEAK OUT! project, please go to TBI Survivor Interview Questionnaire for a copy of the questions and the release form."
