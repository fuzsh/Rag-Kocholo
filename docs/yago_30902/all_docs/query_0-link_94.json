Cathy had lost touch with reality after the death of her and Joe's own daughter Megan, who had been killed in an accident for which Cathy blamed Viki. When delusional Cathy was found, she had no memory of taking the infant Kevin or where she had left him. By 1977, the loss of their son had taken its toll on Joe and Viki's marriage; but when Cathy finally remembered enough for Kevin to be found, Joe and Viki reconciled.\n\nJoe died of a brain tumor right before Kevin's brother, Joseph Lord Riley Jr., was born. When Viki later married Clint Buchanan in 1982, Clint adopted Kevin and Joey.\n\nLove and loss\n\nIn 1991, as a teenager, Kevin's first real love was Stephanie Hobart, the niece of the hated Carlo Hesser. Because of Carlo's hatred for the Buchanans, he ended the relationship. Right after that, Kevin started a love affair with LeeAnn Demerest. They stayed together even though Max Holden had a passion for LeeAnn. Once LeeAnn thought Max had fallen for Luna Moody, LeeAnn and Kevin made love. When Kevin found out that Lee Ann was pregnant in 1992, they eloped. Kevin and LeeAnn's marriage just wasn't to be. LeeAnn had grown very close to Jason Webb. Kevin got a divorce, and LeeAnn went to Texas and took Kevin's baby Duke with her.\n\nKevin started to grow very close to Rachel Gannon. Rachel's father Hank didn't like their friendship at all. While studying at Llanview University, Kevin was charged with raping Marty Saybrooke. She also went to the college. They soon found out he didn't do it when their main suspects were Todd Manning and his frat brothers admitted that Kevin had nothing to do with it. Later in 1994, Rachel and Kevin were going to move in together, but when Kevin went to Texas to go visit Duke, Rachel and Dr. Ben Price started their own little romance. Kevin ended the friendship between him and Rachel.\n\nKevin wanted to do what his parents had done and become a reporter. While starting his new job, Kevin dated Andy Harrison, half-sister of both Max Holden and Jake Harrison. They dated until Kevin went to London in 1995, on assignment. That fall, Kevin ended their relationship in a letter.\n\nThe Cramer women\n\nCassie\n\nKevin came back to Llanview in 1996, and became an investigative reporter. That's where he met his rival reporter Cassie Carpenter. Cassie was married, but that really didn't matter to Kevin, he wanted a romance with her from the start. Cassie kept resisting him, and told him to get someone else. He soon did, Téa Delgado. That made Cassie very jealous seeing Téa with Kevin. Finally in 1997, Cassie couldn't resist anymore and they made love. Cassie left her husband Rev. Andrew Carpenter and married Kevin.\n\nLater in 1998, Kevin and Cassie hired a nurse named Barbara Graham. She was supposed to take care of Cassie's father, David, who was very sick. She soon fell in love with Kevin. Kevin and Barbara were trapped together in a cellar when Todd was holding everyone hostage at the Buchanan lodge. They couldn't resist each other and they made love. Kevin regretted it so much. Cassie soon found out about it, and she was mad! One night Barbara tried to kill Cassie for interfering with her and Kevin. She tried to shoot Cassie, but accidentally shot and killed Kevin's cousin, Drew. Cassie was shot, too and she was paralyzed. Cassie started to go insane after that. She held Barbara hostage. Kevin soon found her. Cassie was shipped off to Switzerland and their marriage was annulled.\n\nIn 1999, a woman named Grace Monroe arrived in town. Now they call her Grace Davidson, it had to do with her being abducted as a child by the mob. She charmed her way into Kevin's life and they had a romance going, but then Gretel Rae Cummings came to town. Rae was looking for her husband, who had cheated on her with a younger woman. That woman was Grace. Rae wanted to ruin Grace's life for having an affair with Rae's husband, Daniel. Rae tried to talk to Kevin and convince him to stop seeing Grace, but had no success. Kevin and Grace grew closer covering the Lindsay Rappaport trial and eventually got engaged.\n\nKelly\n\nIn October 1999, Kevin was a royal mess when Grace drowned at Asa's summer house. Unable to cope, Kevin began heavily drinking. Joey and his girlfriend Kelly Cramer moved in with Kevin for a while to him cope with Grace's death. On New Year's Eve, Kevin and Kelly were drinking and nearly ended up making love. They both agreed to keep it a secret from Joey. When Kevin learned of Viki's breast cancer, he blew Kelly off when she suggested that they should work out their feelings for one another.\n\nJoey found out about Kevin and Kelly when Kelly confessed her true love for Kevin. Unable to cope, Joey nearly strangled Kevin to death with a pool cue. When Kelly was in danger because she could identify the hit man who shot Ben Davidson, Kevin and Joey both moved in to protect her. Kevin was upset when he found out that Joey had been stalling his divorce from Kelly. After Kevin and Joey saved Kelly from the hitman, Joey moved away to London, leaving Kevin and Kelly to enjoy their relationship together. In March 2001, Kevin left town to go to Texas to care for his son, Duke and got a job for a local newspaper. Kelly moved down to Texas to live with Kevin a few months later.\n\nBlair\n\nIn June 2003, Kevin returned to Llanview to launch a political career. Though now married to Kelly, Kevin's eye started roaming in the direction of her cousin, Blair. Later, Kevin confessed to Blair the reason behind the distance between him and Kelly &mdash; she'd had an affair in Texas. As the months went on, Kevin got closer to Blair and finally asked Kelly for a divorce. However, Kelly was desperate to hold on to her marriage when she got pregnant, Kevin decided to give the marriage another try, despite his one night stand with Blair. Months later, Kevin was overjoyed when Kelly presented him with their son.\n\nAnd Kelly again\n\nUnfortunately, their happiness couldn't last. Kelly and Kevin soon became involved in a messy divorce and an even messier custody battle, made all the messier because Kevin's newly arrived son Duke sided with Kelly. Kevin won custody, but when Kelly decided to return the baby to his birth mother, who had thought he died at birth, Kevin remained determined to get his son no matter what. But he couldn't stop the pull Kelly had on him, and the two began getting closer again. Kelly managed to convince Kevin to let his birth mother have him, and the two began a tentative relationship, made all the sweeter because of all the things that had happened between them. Kevin was also pleased when he and Duke finally began a father/son relationship with each other. Kevin and Kelly were looking forward to planning their future together when Kevin took ill. Kevin learned he was sterile just as Kelly, who had surgery to correct her own fertility problems, was looking forward to having a family.\n\nKevin and Kelly found themselves getting into more and more arguments, and inevitably broke up. On the day of Michael and Marcie's wedding, Kevin and Kelly had a vicious argument at St. Jude's rectory and Kevin walked out on Kelly, leaving her crying. Later Kevin learned that Duke had come upon Kelly in the rectory, and the two had made love before being buried in debris from a sudden tornado that swept through Llanview. When both Kelly and Duke were wheeled in for surgery, Kevin was forced to choose which one would get operated on first. Since Kelly was in worse shape he chose her, then was devastated when Duke died before he was operated on. Kevin initially blamed Kelly for Duke's death, and felt like his life was being ripped apart when he learned that Duke had left Kelly with the one thing he could never give her -- a child. Kevin finally came around later in Kelly's pregnancy, and was there for her after she went into early labor. After the birth of her son, Zane, Kevin asked her to come to London with him and raise the baby along with him.\n\nThe return\n\nKevin returned on August 16 and August 17 2007 to attend the funeral of his adopted grandfather, Asa Buchanan. He was joined by brothers Joey Buchanan and Cord Roberts, as well as Max Holden and Alex Olanov.\n\nExternal links"
