        "text": "Our past, our upbringing, and our experiences in life don’t stay in the past. They are carried into our marriages and affect how we operate in our relationships. This is a topic that Mark and I cover a lot in our book No More Perfect Marriages and in our coaching with other couples. The good news is that you are not powerless to stay stuck in the past! You can move beyond it and experience true intimacy in your marriage and relationships.\n\nIn this episode, I’m joined by my husband, Mark, and our friends, Joe & Tara Buchanan. They are the hosts of the Behind Our Smiles podcast, in which they talk openly about their marriage journey and how their past has affected their marriage.\n\nIn this episode, you’ll hear:\n\nJoe & Tara’s marriage journey\n\nThe importance of loving your spouse where they are at right now\n\nHow to surrender the work of restoring your marriage to God\n\nWhy we have to watch for pride in our own hearts\n\nMark and I really appreciated Joe and Tara’s openness in this episode. Listen in!\n\nResources mentioned in this episode:\n\nBehind Our Smiles Website + Podcast\n\nOur No More Perfect Marriages Resources (Here are direct links to the book and seminars)\n\nRe|engage Marriage Group\n\nNo More Perfect Marriages Getaway Weekend September 30-Oct 1, 2022\n\nAs a thank you for listening, get your 3 free eBooks.\n\nMy Key Takeaways:\n\n1) The healing process is ongoing. If you have sought healing and walked through a healing journey of your own, you know that it is a long one! Even when you experience a victory in your journey, it isn’t over. We are constantly growing and learning and healing throughout our lives. We need to be ready to walk through the process of life together, hand-in-hand and on the same team.\n\n2) Where is pride showing up in your marriage? Where are you believing that you are “better” than your spouse? Where are you believing that you aren’t the one with issues to deal with? Pride can so easily creep into our hearts, and it’s important that we address this issue in our heart as early as we can.\n\n3) It’s not our job to change our spouse; it is our job to love our spouse. You can’t change your spouse or bring healing in their life. That isn’t your job! Your job is to accept them as an imperfect person and recognize that you are also an imperfect person. God has to do the work of transforming each of us, so we need to be ready to love our spouses (this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t set boundaries), even when they are on a journey towards healing.\n\n4) Normalize struggle and maximize hope. Our culture has a tendency to idealize marriage as easy, but the truth is that it is often a struggle. We should normalize the struggle and seek to understand that true growth comes when we are vulnerable with our spouse and can share our stories honestly. Sharing our stories also maximizes the hope for those that are on the other side of this process. God is and HAS done great things in stories of broken people. Don’t give up; your story isn’t over yet.\n\nAbout Joe and Tara:"
