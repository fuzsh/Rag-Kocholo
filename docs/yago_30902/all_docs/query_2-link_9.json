        "text": "Host Meridith Foster invites you to listen to The Unfolding podcast where she hears incredible stories about God’s love, mercy, faithfulness in the lives of others.\n\nKeith Stevens shared the first time he met We The Kingdom as they played their songs acapella in the back of a small restaurant.\n\nMeet Pam Lundell, host of A Widow’s Heart podcast, as she shares her story through widowhood to starting A Widow’s Heart.\n\nNicole Phillips, host of The Kindness Podcast, experienced God’s kindness firsthand when she appeared on the show The Price is Right.\n\n“When God works in our lives, He is writing incredible stories,” Meridith Foster, host of The Unfolding, said.\n\n“It’s just a blip in my story,” Gary Miracle shared on episode 81 of The Unfolding as he told Meridith Foster about the events of his life that led him to lose both his hands and feet.\n\nMeridith Foster has a rich personal history with stories, and that background gave her the desire to transform that personal passion for stories into a professional career as host of The Unfolding podcast.\n\nAll too often those who are mentally ill are brushed off and told to toughen up.\n\nMental Health with Dr. Mork is designed to take away the stigma that mental illness can be given—particularly within the church.\n\nKeith Steven’s shares the story of his conversation with Ryan Stevenson and the common loss that they shared in the loss of Ryan’s mother and Keith’s wife, Sue.\n\nOnce voted one of the top happiness podcasts by Oprah Winfrey, The Kindness Podcast is so much more than tips and cute stories.\n\nPam Lundell has been a friend to many across the radio waves, but widowhood sometimes bridges the gap.\n\nPam Lundell shares the story of Lori Larson Heller in episode 6 of A Widow’s Heart.\n\nMarried couple Joe and Tara Buchanan from the Behind Our Smiles podcast share a strategy they’ve learned that helps them appreciate each other’s ideas, even if the other person doesn’t necessarily agree.\n\nCommunication is the lifeblood of any relationship, and it’s especially important in marriage.\n\nJoe and Tara Buchanan share the journeys they’ve traveled individually and as a couple that led them to create Behind Our Smiles, an honest, heartfelt podcast about the challenges and delights of marriage."
