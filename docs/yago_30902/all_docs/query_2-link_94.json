        "text": "Everyone that knows me, and a few who don’t, can tell you I’ve never suffered for a loss of words. But how do you appropriately thank someone who’s driven dozens, if not hundreds of miles to save your town/district? It’s been a harrowing couple of days, but things have improved enough in the last 24 hrs that I have time to reflect. On my way in this morning, after my first night’s sleep at home since Monday, and after a 39-hour shift, I watched a fire engine from Pueblo West turn in front of me, headed to the morning briefing. I realized, in the rapid spin up of this event and resources coming in that very quickly seeing all these rigs and firefighters coming and going started to feel routine. But this morning, after a good night’s rest, the magnitude hit me, and seeing that rig go by gave me chills. That Engine, and its crew, drove 162 miles, not in a sweet leather interior Lexus SUV but in a fire truck…3 hrs+…to help us. And they arent the furthest away by a stretch. Hoehne Fire is here from near Trinidad.\n\nManitou Springs, Foothills, Cimarron, I could go on and on. We have a crew here from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Now as I understand it, they were already working in Wyoming when the request to assist us came in, but to see resources from the eastern U.S. fighting fire in Lyons is nothing short of remarkable. I cannot adequately explain the feeling of indebtedness and gratitude I have for all of these men and women who have worked what has now been 5 days straight of some of the toughest work you can imagine in the harshest of conditions. Fire Management Officers Dustin Blair, Dave Buchanan, Seth Mckinney and personnel from Boulder County Sheriff’s Office were instrumental in the initial attack of this fire, and they, along with the engine crews on the ground and the air assets above are the reason that many homes were spared. I will never be able to repay them for their work. The initial resources from our auto and mutual aid partners in the county, especially Lefthand Canyon’s David Lindquist and Hygiene Fire’s Alex Frank and units from Boulder Emergency Squad, City of Boulder, Allenspark, Pinewood, Longmont, Mountain View, Boulder Rural, Four Mile, Boulder Mountain, Lafayette, Louisville, and Big Elk Fire allowed for the rapid deployment of engines and crews whose efforts cannot be overstated. To be able to build a command structure with this many assets in that short period of time made all the difference.\n\nThe resources deployed on Eagle Ridge stood between the fire and its spread down the mountain and into town. I have been the Fire Chief in Lyons for only a short period of time, and I can tell you that it was particularly unnerving during the first minutes to hours of the fire to not be able to see or even hear what the crew from Lyons 4031 was encountering up on top of the ridge. Only at dinner with the crew on Friday night did I start to understand what they were faced with when they deployed up Eagle Ridge as the first and for a time the ONLY resource at the fire’s point of origin. Their initial efforts limited the loss of homes on the ridge to only 2, one of which was where the fire started. Firefighters shy away from using the word heroic, because this is simply what we do, but I can think of no other way to describe their actions. I take the responsibility and care of the firefighters under my charge very seriously…and have been accused at times of taking an almost fatherly approach to my dealings with them. It was incredibly unsettling to be down on Stone Canyon, when I knew my crews were up on the ridge where I could neither see nor hear, much less provide for their safety. It was not that different than waiting for your own kids to come home late at night, with the exception that while as a dad I sometimes worry if my kids are in harms way, on Tuesday afternoon and evening I knew for CERTAIN that my crews were in danger. I don’t imagine I will ever forget that feeling, or the relief I felt once I heard them on the radio again.\n\nWe are a small department by all measures, but I am so proud to know that of the wildland qualified members of Lyons Fire we had 80% of our entire roster here within hours of the fires start. Chief Pischke, Captains O’neil, Boccolucci, Herman & Hart, Lt. Vasel, Acting Officer Hickey, Firefighters Cullen, Carvajal, Chilton, Davis, Herrara, Legan, Murphy, Preskenis, Palestro, Stack, Strabala, Brunson, Vogel, Cope, Williams, Nagy, Gilchrist, Medina-Rivera, Serrano-Tellez, Vadeboncoeur, Paramedics Malone, Doig, Zettlemoyer, Winkler, Huff, Bielecki- THANK YOU…thank you for your hard work, the risks you exposed yourself to, and for keeping yourselves and each other safe and uninjured (mostly). By week’s end, every single member of this department that was in town/state had been in to assist in the firefight and protection of this community. I’ve never been so proud, or so motivated to do right by this group as I am today.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the Boulder County Sheriff and his staff. BCSO, and law enforcement in general receive few accolades during a wildfire event, as they are the ones tasked with enforcement of evacuation zones and road closures and other duties that put them on the receiving end of some people’s frustrations. But I can tell you they also are the ones driving up the smoke-filled canyons with fire advancing, without any water or firefighting equipment or protection to see that we get as many homes cleared of residents as possible. These men and women save(d) lives. Their sometimes-thankless role is no less significant than a crew on a hoseline or a tanker in the sky.\n\nThe staff of the Town of Lyons has been in the firehouse from the fire’s inception, asking and assisting the District and the Incident Management Team in every way that they can. Victoria, Hollie, Aaron, and Dave have helped organize donations and resources, accommodations for sleepy firefighters, and providing consistent messaging and information to all affected. How great it is to have the kind of relationship where we can lean on them for assistance.\n\nWe have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love from the community of Lyons, and Longmont, Boulder, and the Front Range. Countless calls and emails and visits from so many bringing food, money, drinks, and supplies. Residents have been offering space in their homes to rest our crews. I’ve never seen such an effort in 27 years on the job. Zach Tucker from Planet Bluegrass, Neil Sullivan from St. Vrain Market, any and all of you who’ve bought sunscreen or brought sandwiches or refrigerators or coffee or cookies or Gatorade….thank you for keeping us healthy, fed, hydrated and maybe a little spoiled. Up to now, I’ve been left to marvel over stories on the NBC nightly news about communities that rally around firefighters saving towns in California or elsewhere…now I and the firefighters in Lyons know that it is not the stuff of legend, but a real truth; this community has our backs….and knows no limit to the support they will offer. It is simply heartwarming.\n\nThe Incident Command Post has been in the training room (and part of the living room and apparatus bays) of the firehouse in town since day one, and we’ve played host to dozens of staff from Boulder and Larimer counties, the Front Range, and the State. The Incident Management Team that stood up here to defend the Town of Lyons and the District is an impressive bunch of selfless souls who have been on the shorter end of adequate rest/sleep for 5 days. Nate, our IC, as far as I can tell, simply doesn’t sleep. Kip and the crew in logistics kept the station in order and the crews resupplied and Jamie in Public Information has been juggling messaging from forty different agencies and dignitaries and media like a pro. It has been a privilege to host this team, and fascinating to watch. Comms, Finance, Plans…all of them working to support the fire…keeping it staffed day and night, keeping us talking to each other and getting things paid for. They’ve been running a city inside of a town inside of a fire like it was nothin.\n\nGovernor Polis and his staff were here early, and he and Congressman Joe Neguse lent the full strength of the State of Colorado to our little town/fire district. Joe’s been back, without fanfare, feeding the troops and socializing with the staff.\n\nI know there are people I’ve left out and I can only ask for forgiveness if I overlooked someone’s contribution. There’s been so many moving parts, and I haven’t been able to keep a handle on all of it. As of this writing, and as best as I can recollect, I want to publicly acknowledge the debt owed to, and thank as earnestly as I am able:\n\nLyons Fire Protection District\n\nHygiene Fire Protection District\n\nLefthand Canyon Fire Protection District\n\nBoulder County Sheriffs Office\n\nBoulder County Sheriff Fire Management Office\n\nBoulder County Sheriff Emergency Services\n\nBoulder County Sheriff Communications\n\nAllenspark Fire Protection District\n\nLongmont Public Safety Department\n\nBoulder Rural Fire\n\nBoulder Fire Department\n\nBoulder Emergency Squad\n\nBerthoud Fire Protection District\n\nMountainview Fire Protection District\n\nBoulder Mountain Fire Protection District\n\nFour Mile Fire Protection District\n\nColorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control\n\nCongressman Joe Neguse\n\nGovernor Jared Polis\n\nSquad 1-1 USFS\n\nBig Elk Fire Protection District\n\nJamestown Fire\n\nSugarloaf Fire\n\nSunshine Fire\n\nLafayette Fire\n\nLouisville Fire\n\nFrederick Firestone Fire Protection District\n\nWestminster Fire\n\nAurora Fire\n\nArvada Fire\n\nManitou Springs Fire\n\nBrush Volunteer Fire\n\nJackson 105 Fire\n\nLarimer County Sheriff\n\nLarimer County Sheriffs Emergency Services\n\nSable Altura Fire\n\nEaton Fire Department\n\nSouth Adams County Fire\n\nPueblo West Fire\n\nFoothills Fire Protection District\n\nHoehne Fire Protection District\n\nPennsylvania Wildland Team\n\nCrook Fire Protection\n\nEl Paso Fire\n\nNederland Fire Protection District\n\nCimarron Fire\n\nColorado River Fire\n\nNate, Jamie, John, Shannon, Joe, Kerry, Sarah, Fritz, Hank, Scott, Butch, Danny, Brian, Rod, Matt, Chad, Sue, Paul, Mark, Bud, Sloane\n\nHollie, Victoria, Aaron, Dave and Town of Lyons staff\n\nI will close with someone else’s words that I have cited time and again to new fire recruits, that I think is relevant here. Thoreau said “the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation”….and in 1986 President Ronald Reagan while addressing the anniversary of the United States Marine Corp said “some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world”. I can tell you that the men and women who’ve lent their time, their hearts and minds to Lyons and the Stone Canyon Fire don’t have that problem. This has been a career defining event for me, not because of anything I did, but because of the people listed here, and the herculean effort put forth to assist and protect all of us.\n\n……………………Rob Stumpf, Fire Chief, LFPD\n\nTo donate to Lyons Fire Fund, click HERE"
