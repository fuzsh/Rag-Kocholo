        "text": "How I Met Nathan Fillion\n\n‚ÄúThe part of Joey Buchanan is now being played by Nathan Fillion.‚Äù\n\nI remember that moment so clearly, sitting there watching One Life To Live with my mom. Being diehard soap fans, we were more than familiar with recasts ‚Äì they happened about as often as hummingbirds flap their wings (i.e., constantly). And unless you kept up with Soap Opera Digest or one of the other magazines, you could really be caught off guard. Sometimes it hurt ‚Äì a beloved favorite suddenly gone, and a new face thrust in front of us with the expectation that viewers should simply accept the change and adjust. Other times, a role had been recast so many times, or the character just wasn‚Äôt that memorable to begin with, so a new actor meant nothing aside from a brief eye roll (Another recast? Oy.).\n\nOLTL‚Äôs Joey Buchanan fell into the second category. As viewers, we didn‚Äôt really care about the character‚Ä¶until that fateful day mentioned above. Right from the first scene, Nathan had his hooks in us. Joey‚Äôs playful interactions with his family members felt funny and warm and natural. Mom and I looked at one another and decided, ‚ÄúWe like him.‚Äù\n\nOf course, little did we know that Nathan Fillion would go on to become the very definition of a megastar, ruling genre television and police procedurals alike with starring roles in Firefly, Castle, Dr. Horrible‚Äôs Sing-Along Blog, The Rookie, and many more. He also voices the character of Octopus on my current favorite series, Resident Alien (if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, go stream it on Peacock right away!). Nathan is the perfect example of how a talented actor can make a previously bland character into one audiences can‚Äôt get enough of.\n\nWatch Nathan‚Äôs first scene as Joey, courtesy of Jasmine on YouTube:\n\nLois & Clark (& Jimmy 2.0)\n\nMom and I had a much stronger ‚Äì and more negative ‚Äì reaction when we heard that same cheesy voiceover announcing that the character of Jimmy Olsen on Lois & Clark would now be played by Justin Whalin. While recasts are a dime a dozen on daytime television, they are far less frequent when you enter the realm of prime time and movies. So, no eye rolls this time. We were attached to Michael Landes‚Äô portrayal of Jimmy and didn‚Äôt understand the change. My mom theorized that Michael looked a little too similar to Dean Cain, who was playing Clark Kent. A brief internet search indicates she may have been right (go, Mom!), but it does raise the question: if he looked too much like Clark‚Äôs little bro, why cast him in the first place? It‚Äôs not like Michael suddenly started resembling Dean. Maybe there were other reasons we‚Äôll never hear about.\n\nIn any case, the Jimmy Olsen recast was a rough one. All recasts take the viewer out of the reality of the fictional world, reminding us that we are just watching a show or movie. And since this was my favorite show ‚Äì the marvelous escape that helped me cope with the real stuff going on in my life ‚Äì I definitely didn‚Äôt appreciate the interruption. Justin (AKA Jimmy 2.0) acknowledged on the special features portion of one of the L&C DVD sets that he didn‚Äôt get the warmest welcome from fans, receiving a lot of negative letters in the first part of his initial season. However, by about halfway through, the tides were turning and he was getting about a 50-50 mix of good and bad fan mail.\n\nPersonally, I think I started to warm up to him around episode seven, ‚ÄúThat Old Gang of Mine.‚Äù Jimmy‚Äôs heartbroken grief after Clark Kent is ‚Äúmurdered‚Äù in that ep really tugged on my teenage heartstrings. If he was that devastated after losing a friend, my young mind reasoned, then he must be a pretty good guy. üôÇ\n\nIron Man and Rhodey: The Missing Bond\n\nUnlike my initial dismay over the new Jimmy on L&C, the recast of James Rhodes in Iron Man 2 was just plain confusing for me. Admittedly, I am not great with names, so it took me a beat (and a rewatch of the first film) to realize that this newcomer, Don Cheadle, was supposed to be playing the same character that had previously been portrayed by Terrence Howard. Another rocky transition for me, since I thought Terrence was great in Iron Man. The writers really took the time to show the bond between Rhodey and Tony in that initial movie, and with a new actor, the relationship between the two characters just didn‚Äôt feel the same. Of course, Don Cheadle ROCKS as War Machine, so he eventually won me over, but if I were a writer working on that franchise (I wish, LOL!), I think I would have added a bonding scene between Tony and Rhodey 2.0 early in Iron Man 2 to help audiences get over the hump and begin to form that connection to the new actor.\n\nA Tale of Three Carlys\n\nWhen it comes to recasts, it‚Äôs cool to acknowledge the different strengths each actor brings to the role, rather than just trying to forget any previous incarnations of the character ever existed. Michael Landes was charming and hilarious as Jimmy, while Justin Whalin was sweet, sincere, and boyishly innocent. Terrence Howard‚Äôs Rhodey had a memorable bond with Tony Stark, while Don Cheadle‚Äôs version kicked all kinds of butt fighting side-by-side with Iron Man against Whiplash (and added some great humor when his suit‚Äôs tech malfunctioned).\n\nGeneral Hospital did something really interesting a few years back, where they paid homage to all of the actresses to ever play the role of Carly through the years, bringing back each performer for a single, memorable scene alongside costar Maurice Benard. It was a little bit weird, but also a really nice touch to see a show so boldly acknowledge (rather than shy away from) the uncomfortable but sometimes necessary issue of recasts.\n\nIn Loving Memory\n\nRecasts can happen due to a variety of circumstances ‚Äì financial disagreements, personal issues, an actor no longer being available ‚Äì but the very worst reason is, of course, that the actor has passed away in real life. Such was the case with Michael Gambon replacing Richard Harris as Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movies. I loved Harris‚Äôs Dumbledore for the sweet, grandfatherly affection he showed Harry, and the sparkle in his eye. Gambon brought more quirkiness and mystery to the role. Together, they made the perfect wise old wizard.\n\nWhile Dumbledore had to be recast for the pre-written storyline to work, there are other times when replacing a deceased actor just wouldn‚Äôt feel right. After Christopher Reeve passed away, Smallville decided to have his memorable and magnetic character, Dr. Swann, also perish. The grief on the show mirrored our grief in real life. The same goes for the character of Dr. Kroger on Monk. After the loss of actor Stanley Kamel, Monk paid tribute to its fallen cast member in the best way possible ‚Äì by showing Adrian Monk grapple, and eventually make peace, with the death of his beloved psychiatrist, Dr. Kroger.\n\nSuperman and Lois (and Jon Kent 2.0)\n\nOver the summer, while searching for the premiere date of my other current favorite show, Superman and Lois, I stumbled across the news that Jon Kent would no longer be played by Jordan Elsass. The news was upsetting, but at least I had ample time to adjust before the show actually began airing its third season. Still, I was nervous as I sat down to watch the premiere. Elsass was memorable, and I could tell from the amount of fanfiction written about his version of the character that he really made an impact on viewers.\n\nSo far, despite my reservations, I am happy with how Superman and Lois has handled the difficult situation of replacing one of their main actors. They didn‚Äôt shove the change in our faces, but they didn‚Äôt sweep it under the rug either (and very thankfully, they did not make that super cheesy voiceover announcement!). Over the course of S3‚Äôs first several episodes, we are gradually getting to know Michael Bishop‚Äôs version of Jon. I feel like he has the right vibe for the character. He‚Äôs sweet and earnest, funny yet serious when he needs to be. As Nathan Fillion showed us almost twenty-nine years ago, recasts do not have to be horrible. As Justin Whalin, Michael Gambon, and others have demonstrated through the years, a new actor can make a role special in their own way, without taking away from what came before. I‚Äôll always look back fondly on what Elsass brought to the character of Jon Kent, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how Bishop grows into his own version of the fair-haired Kent brother."
