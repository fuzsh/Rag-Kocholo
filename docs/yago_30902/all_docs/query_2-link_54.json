Actor Donnie Jeffcoat will be visiting The Locher Room on Thursday, Aug. 5 at 3 p.m. ET for a live chat with host Alan Locher and fans like you!\n\nSoap viewers remember Jeffcoat taking over for Nathan Fillion as Joey Buchanan on OLTL back in 1997, and he played the role until 2001 when the character was written off the show. He’ll have plenty of fond memories of Llanview to share as well as talking about his current role as father to eight-month-old Willow and chief instructor and owner of Shaolin American Self Defense Academy. Jeffcoat actually started his martial arts training back in 1985 and is a fifth-degree black belt! So you won’t want to miss this unique chat!"
