        "text": "Good gravy, y’all! I am fired up and ready to sing my tail off to bring some good music and good times to you. We’re heading back into the studio in May to record the follow up to 2015’s “Unbroken” and I can’t wait for you to join us.\n\nYou and your support made the last album possible. I never could have expected the response that “Unbroken” would have. In the time since it’s release, I’ve spent sacred time with people from all manner of Jewish communities, heard the stories of those who have joined the tribe, and prayed with folks from every branch of Judaism and every walk of life. It has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life and to everyone who supported the last crowdfunding campaign or invited me out, thank you.\n\nThe journey home to Judaism was just the beginning and so many new songs have been written since our family started down this road. Songs about struggle, community, and this life that we’re all experiencing together. It’s going to absolutely rock and I am so proud to be working with producer, Saul Kaye, to bring this new collection of Jewish Americana to life.\n\nIndependent music can be expensive and this album will be a huge undertaking. We’re putting out a full-length collection of songs – 14 tracks of original Jewish Americana. Most will feature the full band and be recorded “off the floor” in Berkeley, CA. You’ll have access not only to the perk you select, but also behind the scenes pics and videos, exclusive recordings, and what amounts to a backstage pass for the whole endeavor.\n\nWe want you with us and can’t wait to get this music from the studio to your ears.\n\nThanks for the consideration! Feel free to pick a perk and let’s get rolling."
