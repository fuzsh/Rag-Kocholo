Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the 1980s. It is characterized by fast tempos, melodic guitar riffs, high-pitched vocals, and fantasy-themed lyrics. The genre’s roots can be traced back to bands like Helloween, who released the influential double album “Keeper of the Seven Keys” in 1987-1988, setting the standard for power metal.

Power metal gained significant popularity in Europe, particularly in countries like Germany, Italy, and Finland, where many well-known bands such as Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, and Nightwish emerged. These bands often incorporated symphonic elements and epic storytelling into their music, drawing inspiration from mythology, science fiction, and fantasy literature.

In the United States, power metal developed differently, with bands like Iced Earth and Nevermore leading the charge. However, the American scene was somewhat overshadowed by the more popular thrash metal genre. Despite this, some American bands, such as Kamelot and Cellador, gained recognition for their European-influenced sound.

The European power metal scene can be further divided into various regional “schools,” each with its distinct characteristics. The Italian school, pioneered by Rhapsody, is known for its grandiose, orchestral approach, while the German school, led by Helloween, focuses on speed and melodic precision. The Finnish school, represented by bands like Stratovarius, combines elements of both styles.

Power metal vocals are generally clean and high-pitched, with singers like Hansi Kürsch of Blind Guardian known for their use of multi-layered harmonies. Guitarists and bassists often play fast, melodic passages with intricate solos, while drummers frequently employ double bass drumming to maintain high speeds.
