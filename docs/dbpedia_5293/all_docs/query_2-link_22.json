        "text": "So I am not a big Black Metal listener and not true kvlt. I do however like some songs when they cross paths with me and I end up liking them. I would like to apply some of the uniqe charasterics though Black Metal has and especially want to emulate some of it since I created a gloomy riff.\n\nI know they down tune their guits, but is it possible to do some of these things in E standard? One of the things that I am trying to emulate (Please provide examples since I do not know what the fuck this is called so sorry if I sound like an idiot) is when they start chugging and then they hit notes that sound like they are clashing and have a lot of dissonance and is usually used to build up the tension (how I feel about it) in the BM songs I have heard.\n\nIf you guys could provide some examples of it and also how to emulate that on the guitar I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nAlso if you guys could keep it in laimen terms since I am not the wise in music theory, but I am trying to learn and I would like to know how this sound in Black Metal is accomplished.\n\nThanks guys\n\nI don't think down-tuning is a characteristic of black metal, many black metal bands use standard tuning. I think it's only a minority who use lower tunings. Also what BM songs have you heard? Chugging is not a BM technique, although it can be used in BM songs, but you wouldn't see that in traditional black I believe.\n\nThe things that sound black to me is the extensive and prolongated use of blast beats on drums, and tremolo picking on guitars. Tremolo picking meaning that you pick high-pitched notes very fast. The chords and chord progressions don't usually vary too much from regular metal although they can have a lot more influence from romanticism and classical music. But if you mention chords clashing together maybe you've listened to some recent dissonant black metal. I like this style a lot, too. Basically they use chords that are dissonant, like chords with a flat-2, flat-5, minor-6, but you can get creative.\n\nBM is not necessarily a vocal genre, but if you go for a vocalist, try to find someone whose shrieks are high-pitched, it seems to be more standard in BM than low-pitched grunts and growls of death metal.\n\nI don't think down-tuning is a characteristic of black metal, many black metal bands use standard tuning.

The two genres are related to each other, but the part you are pointing toward is definitely one of the characteristic sounds of death metal.\n\nTune your guitar down, chug your open power chord two times with plenty of palm muting, then play the first fret power chord with the same palm muting one time, then play another muted open power chord, and repeat three total times, then play some screechy notes four times way up on the first and second strings, a few frets apart with the lower fret on the first string. While you do this, whoever is doing vocals should go a false chord growl for as long as the breakdown goes, or as long as possible if the breakdown is too long. Have your drummer follow your chugging on his kick drum with quarter notes stuck on a crash or maybe china cymbal. Snare on two and on four. Bonus points to your drummer if he or she switches to triplets on the kick drum halfway through the breakdown.\n\nThat's the basic formula for probably 80-90% of slow DM breakdowns in the 21st century. Fast breakdowns, on the other hand, is more where DM and BM overlap a bit, but in my mind, Death Metal singers either sound like \"GRWOOOOAAAAAARRRR!!1!1!1!!!1one!!!11!!e!even!!!!1!!!\" or \"BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!\", where black metal singers sound more like \"SKREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!\". It's like the difference between a minotaur or pig monster and a serpent or lizard monster.\n\nEven though it seems mostly formulaic, it's still cool as hell, and to be fair, 99.6% of the music that's out there is just as predictably formulaic, if not moreso.\n\nYeah, that's a death metal riff.

I know how to do the breakdown part as I have implicated that into my song, but I think the icing on the cake is the screechy notes. How do I do those? I know it is on the b and e string. I tried to do that with a chord by adding a note up on the b string and I kinda got the vibe there, but not entirely\n\nBands like: Bathory, Emperor, Immortal, Burzum, Mayhem etc...lo-fi recording, depressing/suicidal lyrical themes, hyper fast barre-chord style rhythm guitar over extended blast beat drums, lots of gain and chorus for the “frozen moon” sound lol, choppy mess lead work...some bands like Behemoth are “churching up” black metal and making it hi-fi and more technical, but classic Black Metal follows the same theme. You can spot the people at Wal-mart and Hot Topic at the mall looking for good sales on Halloween makeup and usually shopping in the children’s section because most of them all weigh under 90 lbs...Old stuff from Mayhem is a good example of straight up Black Metal\n\nI like some of Venom, Is that a bad example of a BM band?\n\nAlso I hear people making jokes about black metal being recorded on a 2006 flip phone and such and I assume that has to correlate with lo-fi. What exactly is lo-fi?\n\nHm seems like I would prefer death metal better. Though I don't like the cannibal corpse stuff where I cannot comprehend what they are saying.\n\nHaha! Well, extreme metal of whichever sort might not be your bag, then, if you actually want to be able to understand the lyrics.\n\nLo-fi, or low fidelity is just a really low quality recording. A lot of Black Metal from the 1990's and 2000's was recorded on extremely low budget, so the sound quality just isn't any good, usually sounding tinny and harsh.\n\nThose two notes shouldn't be difficult to find. I don't have a guitar with me, or I'd try to help you, but honestly, you should be able to find it through trial and error in 2-3 minutes. It's a mainstay of modern metal to play two notes a half step or sometimes a whole step apart, up high, to affect the same sort of clashing dissonance.\n\nI like some of Venom, Is that a bad example of a BM band?\n\nAlso I hear people making jokes about black metal being recorded on a 2006 flip phone and such and I assume that has to correlate with lo-fi. What exactly is lo-fi?\n\nVenom and mayhem are the perfect examples of early black metal.\n\nlo-fi = low fidelity (ie sounds like shit). It's a product of the time and equipment available to black metal groups at the time of its creation and basically became a signature part of the black metal sound, just like the boss hm2 is a staple of the swedish death metal sound or how fuzz is a big part of the stoner/doom sound."
