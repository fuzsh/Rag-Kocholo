        "text": "The period from around 1997 to 2002 may be my favorite time for this style of music as far as depth of bands. Hammerfall's debut and the Visions album from Stratovarius were the albums that I really recall inspiring a lot of new bands and bringing in a lot of new listeners. As a teen during that time I'd heard nothing else really like it. Still think Blind Guardian's \"A Night at the Opera\" is one of the pinnacles of the genre and was around the tail end of when I was regularly following this kind of music.\n\n\"A Night at the Opera\" abruptly ended my Blind Guardian fandom. Too overstuffed and over-the-top even for them. I hated it so much I could never listen to their previous albums again. And that cover art is aggressively hideous."
