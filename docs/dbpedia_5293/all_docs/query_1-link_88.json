What do you like about it? Any band suggestions? I had a huge realization that Power Metal is where its at for me, I love all sorts of music and I love metal but power metal gives me the feels! One of the few genres of music that I get pumped and seriously all sorts of emotions pour out of me whenever I here some avantasia or rhapsody. Anyways does anyone else get like that? Or is it just me?\n\nThis site may earn a commission from merchant links like Ebay, Amazon, and others.\n\nFenceclimber\n\nPlays guitar, reads SSO\n\nJoined\n\nJul 16, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n225\n\nReaction score\n\n84\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#2\n\nTad Morose are great, check out their albums ''Undead'',''Matters of the dark'' and ''Modus Vivendi''.\n\nRuski\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nJan 8, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n8\n\nReaction score\n\n1\n\nLocation\n\nSt louis, MO\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#3\n\nThanks, ill check that out. I really wanna discover more power metal bands. I really love Blind Guardian, rhapsody of fire, Avantasia, Edguy. A lot of just big name bands, I know there are a lot of sweet gems out there. My friend went to Wales and he got me a copy of a Steel Wing album and those guys are great, they are a perfect mix of Judas priest and iron maiden.\n\nIkiharmaa\n\nIt's all white.\n\nJoined\n\nDec 26, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n422\n\nReaction score\n\n10\n\nLocation\n\nFinland\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#4\n\nI like the first two Masterplan albums, love the second one to be exact <3\n\nTIMEwaveXERO\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 16, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n346\n\nReaction score\n\n23\n\nLocation\n\nWeipa, QLD, Australia\n\nRuski\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nJan 8, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n8\n\nReaction score\n\n1\n\nLocation\n\nSt louis, MO\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#6\n\nSonata Arctica!

That opera/choir style in power metal is probably one of my favorite aspects of the genre.\n\nJoined\n\nApr 4, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n448\n\nReaction score\n\n52\n\nLocation\n\nSpringfield, IL\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#9\n\nThe whole genre has gone downhill.\n\nLost Horizon being my favorite.\n\nOld Heavenly still kicks my ass.\n\nChrisRushing\n\nFretboard Acrobat\n\nJoined\n\nJun 7, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n605\n\nReaction score\n\n72\n\nLocation\n\nAtlanta, Ga\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#10\n\nNot really into that many bands in this genre but I'll throw in a second vote for Lost horizon and also add Blind Guardian (Nightfall in Middle Earth, A night at the opera and Imaginations from the other side are all fantastic albums from their discography).\n\nAlso, Kamelot's \"The black halo\" is pretty awesome. Though I never got into any of their other material.\n\nDXL\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nSep 8, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n868\n\nReaction score\n\n51\n\nLocation\n\nNew York\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#11\n\nIced Earth for some good American power metal \\m/\n\nredstone\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,480\n\nReaction score\n\n75\n\nLocation\n\nFrance\n\ntroyguitar\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 7, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n9,009\n\nReaction score\n\n797\n\nLocation\n\nSt Petersburg, FL\n\nDon Vito\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nSep 14, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n5,314\n\nReaction score\n\n225\n\nLocation\n\nL O N D O N\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#14\n\nSonata Arctica!

Prior to that, he released an acoustic album with Timo from Stratovarius. Additionally, he helped out with the latest Stratovarius album Nemesis.\n\nHe also hinted at a new Cain's Offering(short lived power metal supergroup from a few years ago) album, but not set in stone or anytime soon.\n\nRuski\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nJan 8, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n8\n\nReaction score\n\n1\n\nLocation\n\nSt louis, MO\n\nAug 7, 2013\n\n#15\n\nI've seen on a lot of websites about power metal mention children of bodom as a power metal band.

They are not. Those bands are both technical progressive metal bands. Totally different in terms of composition and atmosphere. These are legit good bands.\n\nI used to be able to listen to power metal when I was a teenager, but not so much nowadays.\n\nI always like Helloween and Rhapsody. From Helloween I'd recommend Keeper Of The Seven Keys pt II for their old style, and Rabbit Don't Come Easy for their newer style.\n\nFor Rhapsody I'd recommend Dawn Of Victory.\n\nOf course there's good ol' Dragonforce as well. I only ever liked their 2nd album.\n\nAlso the band Time Requiem is alright, but half the time it's just ridiculously way too fast noodle solos.\n\nRuski\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nJan 8, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n8\n\nReaction score\n\n1\n\nLocation\n\nSt louis, MO\n\nAug 8, 2013\n\n#18\n\nAh, I know there early work is more symphonic and classical but that's about it.\n\nvibrantgermancities\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 29, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n188\n\nReaction score\n\n225\n\nLocation\n\nManchester, UK\n\nAug 8, 2013\n\n#19\n\nFalconer.
