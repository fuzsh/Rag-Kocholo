        "meta_description": "This is a list of power metal bands including notable bands that have at some point in their careers played power metal or heavily contributed to the genre's development. Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound.",

You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nPower metal has two distinct early styles, which developed in parallel. US Power Metal was developed in the mid/late 80s, pioneered by bands such as Omen and characterized by harsh thrashy sound and a focus on speed and soaring operatic vocals. It was directly influenced by speed metal and NWOBHM, and had a drop in popularity in the 90s. A more widespread and popular style, European Power Metal, was developed in the late 80s by key bands such as Helloween, and was more melodic, employing keyboards, synths and anthem-like songs."
