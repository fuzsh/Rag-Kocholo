        "text": "HE IS RISEN! HE IS RISEN INDEED, FROM THE PITS OF HELL IT’S ME, APOTHEOSIS GUY! Happy Easter to those of you who celebrate, happy giving Satan a lap dance day to those of you who don’t. This week we’ve got a lot of great stuff for y’all, including a metal album that literally saved this edition of the newsletter, an absolutely loaded week of non-metal selections, and, BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL!!!! We’ve got POWER METAL!\n\nIf you’ve got a friend who needs to know what power metal is, or who really just needs some additional music recommendations in their life, smash that share button so that I can watch number go up, which makes endorphins go whee.\n\nShare\n\nALBUM OF THE WEEK\n\nGrorr - Ddulen’s Last Flight\n\nGrorr really came in and saved me at the buzzer this week. By and large, much of the metal that dropped last Friday didn’t capture my imagination, and the things that did were too derivative to put on a pedestal. Grorr, however, are anything but derivative. While most prog bands are still busy trying to recapture the magic of ‘90s-’00s era Tool, Grorr is looking forward by expanding their instrumental palette to include traditional sounds from across the globe. Somehow, they manage to avoid all the traditional fetishistic pitfalls of introducing these instruments. Each sonic choice feels fully considered, and the blend of traditional prog metal structure with non-traditional metal instruments makes for a thrilling journey unlike anything else in the style.\n\nhttps://vicisolumrecords.com/album/ddulden-s-last-flight\n\nGreat Metal from this Week\n\nThis week wasn’t too impressive from the metal angle, but each of these albums certainly gave me something to chew on. Paladine is an excellent piece of power metal that nails the fantasy elements without becoming too cringey. Genghis Tron and Wheel brought some sick prog metal to our headphones, the former is more ambitious and less abrasive while the latter is very akin to Tool. Closing out the pack is Aara, who uses melodic black metal to retell the tales of a book that’s more than 200 years old.\n\nPaladine - Entering the Abyss\n\nGenghis Tron - Dream Weapon\n\nWheel - Resident Human\n\nAara - Triade I: Eos\n\nYou can catch all the best tracks from these albums, and some albums that didn’t quite make the cut, on our Fresh Kills playlist. It’s updated live as I listen to music, so keep an eye out for new tracks every day.\n\nFresh Kills Playlist\n\nSongs for the Enamel (Pin) Queen\n\nIt’s been awhile since some merch has come across my inbox that I thought was worth sharing with y’all, but this one inspired me to keep this section in the newsletter. Black Sheep Wall, the current holder of “2021’s Best Metal Album,” has released a pin depicting the album cover of their latest record, Songs for the Enamel Queen. The album absolutely rips, and so does it’s cover art. It’s also not lost on me that an enamel pin of an album titled Songs for the Enamel Queen is hilarious. I love when a metal band knows that they don’t need to take themselves too seriously.\n\nI’m not sure how many of these pins are available for sale, but I already grabbed mine because it was too cool to pass up. If you’re a metalhead and a pin collector, I suggest you do the same.\n\nBuy This Merch\n\nSubgenre Guide - Power Metal\n\nOh power metal. One of the most derided and mocked genres in metal (though not THE most, hello there prog metal) and not entirely without reason. This genre pulls a majority of its influence from original heavy metal, and as a consequence is lighter and less abrasive than other genres. Power metal is also known for its bold, assertive choruses that border on power pop. The instruments tend to follow similar structures to traditional heavy metal, meaning solos abound, the drums are stable, tight and clear, and the bass (sadly) is lower in the mix and holds the songs together instead of standing out. The most common genre fusions for power metal are speed power metal, which is played at a faster tempo and contains the same general characteristics as speed metal. The other common fusion is power prog, which sees the simpler instrumentation of heavy metal shed in favor of more complex, knotted song structures and time signatures.\n\nFor all the instrumental and sonic signifiers of power metal, and as you’ve seen, there are many, nothing is quite so indicative of power metal as the subject matter. Most power metal tends to lean hard on western fantasy literature (and more specifically, Lord of the Rings) as a key influence on their lyrical content. In this regard they stand out as the most notable band to incorporate such imagery and themes into their songs was Led Zeppelin rather than Black Sabbath, who are the key influence on a majority of metal genres (though Sabbath themselves did also incorporate fantasy elements into their songs, Zeppelin did it more frequently and more obviously). Put in the simplest terms, power metal is what happens when a kid listens to Led Zeppelin and decides that the songs about orcs are way cooler than the songs about sex. It’s the “while you were out gettin’ laid I was at home, studying the blade.” meme of metal genres.\n\nBut for all the mockery levied against it, power metal has a lot to offer, both in its historical and present states. While the subject matter is at times silly, when power metal is well executed, few metal genres offer the same levels of emotional potency and forcefulness. And how could it not be emotionally impactful and uplifting when it was pioneered by none other than Dio themselves. Metal anthropologists (still love that this is a thing) have keyed in on the lyrics that Dio originally wrote for the band Rainbow as the key to unlocking the future of European power metal (in North America power metal briefly referred to something more akin to a bigger, louder, faster speed metal variant. That genre is far smaller and less widespread than the power metal we’re discussing). While Rainbow itself is a heavy metal band, they have a few tracks that are considered to be proto-power metal, such as “Stargazer” and “A Light in the Black.”\n\nSonically, Iron Maiden would prove to be another important influencer of what would become power metal. They added a more “epic” sensibility to heavy metal, resulting in songs that could rock a stadium rather than just a biker bar, this is also what would lead to glam metal but we don’t need to go that deep into hell just yet. This draw towards the anthemic would melt with speed metal groups like Accept, who added a faster, more intentional style of play into the lexicon of metal music. Yngwie Malmsteen, who remains active to this day as one of metal’s guitar titans, was also an important influence point for early power metal bands.\n\nThe first true power metal bands are widely considered to be German, as that is where speed metal was most influential in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. Two of the most notable bands from this era of power metal were Helloween and Blind Guardian. Both of the canonical “first power metal” albums came from Helloween with their Keeper of the Seven Keys series of records. These bands utilized clean, high-pitched vocals and changes in tone and tempo of the instruments to create soaring choruses and forceful verses that kept audiences hooked and made it easier to implement effective lyrical storytelling, which was difficult in genres that demanded harsher, more difficult to understand vocals. Helloween and Blind Guardian were vastly different though, the former leaned more toward the speed metal influence points, while the latter utilized overdubbing, which helped the band create choir-like arrangements and would eventually pave the way for symphonic metal bands like Nightwish.\n\nToday, power metal maintains a dedicated, somewhat small fanbase. While it is more of a tertiary genre when compared to pillars like black metal, death metal, doom metal and heavy metal, it still thrives within its communities. One of our metal highlights from this week, Paladine, is a power metal band, as is Judicator, who produced one of 2020’s best metal albums Let There Be Nothing. Other notable power metal bands from the modern era include Kamelot, Circle II Circle, Pharaoh, and Borealis. Personally, I have to be in the mood to want to listen to this genre, but when it hits, it absolutely knocks your jaw out of place.\n\nTo send us off, we’ll have Blind Guardian serenade us with the sweet sounds of their most popular track, “”The Bard’s Song - In the Forest.” Just make sure you aren’t actually in the forest when you listen, as there could be dangerous orcs, or even a troll lurking nearby.\n\nNon-Metal AOTW\n\nFor Those I Love - For Those I Love\n\nIn a week full of magnificent, and I mean truly magnificent music, from artists that I know and love, nothing captured my attention like For Those I Love. On the surface, this is a UK Rap (or spoken word? Rhyme isn’t really much a factor in the lyrical content) album with a strong emphasis on atmospherics and off-the-wall production choices. Digging a bit deeper, it’s a powerful rumination on the idea of love, friendship and camaraderie between young friends in the face of all obstacles. While this is by no means a new theme in music, the level of detail poured into it across this record makes it one of the most powerful pieces of music I’ve heard this year. I implore you to check this one out, even though it is sadly not on Bandcamp for the time being.\n\nRunners-up\n\nNormally I don’t write anything for this section but this week was so stacked that it demands at least some dissection. Xiu Xiu takes a break from being one of the strangest bands on the planet and instead chooses to be one of the stranger bands on the planet. The toned down approach works well and results in the most cohesive Xiu Xiu album in recent memory. Made Out of Sound tells me not to call it jazz, so I’ll call it the most compelling free-form exploration of sonic landscapes from 2021. Promises, however, is jazz in some regard, and is a tremendously compelling piece of instrumental work that demands at least a few rotations. Noga Erez channels her inner Gorillaz fan with Kids, landing on an extremely “me” set of sounds in the process. And finally, serpentwithfeet once again brings the house down with DEACON, a glistening, unashamed tribute to the beauty of his love.\n\nXiu Xiu - Oh No\n\nChris Cosano & Bill Orcutt - Made Out of Sound\n\nFloating Points, Pharoah Sanders, & The London Symphony Orchestra - Promises\n\nNoga Erez - Kids\n\nserpentwithfeet - DEACON\n\nWhat The Eye of Sauron Sees\n\nLots of great non-metal stuff on the horizon yet again. Not too much of the metal strikes me as familiar, but the weeks without anticipation are often some of the best as I get to enter into records with no preconceptions of what they should sound like.\n\nIf you enjoy my writing enough to seek it out, head to my author page for Mxdwn a few times next week, I’ll be posting a review of the new Godspeed You! Black Emperor album, that, given my adoration for that group, is sure to be a deeper dive than necessary.\n\nMetal Albums\n\nDead Neanderthals - Rat Licker\n\nFuoco Fatuo - Obsidian Katabasis\n\nGnod - Easy to Build, Hard to Destroy\n\nRorcal & Earthflesh - Witch Coven\n\nNon-Metal Albums\n\nGodspeed You! Black Emperor - G_d’s Pee AT STATE’S END!\n\nIglooghost - Lei Line Eon\n\nFlock of Dimes - Head of Roses\n\nBryce Dessner, Australian String Quartet & Sydney Dance Company - Impermanence/Disintegration\n\nHit the comments with anything that I missed, metal or not. I always need more stuff to check out so that this newsletter becomes more valuable to all of you.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nShrinekeeping\n\nAs always, please pass this letter along to any metalheads in your life, or anyone who could simply use a laugh as they watch me try to navigate my way through fifty or so albums per week.\n\nShare Apotheosis\n\nIf my flailing was hilarious, or strangely insightful, stick around by clicking the subscribe button below.\n\nThat’s all for this week.
