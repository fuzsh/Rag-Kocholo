        "text": "Power metal isn’t usually the kind of genre of music that I am interested in seeing live, as I don’t listen to that much of it, but a friend dragged me along to a Stratovarius concert, and I was absolutely mesmerised. To start with, the Finnish band are all extremely talented musicians, who are real masters of their respective instruments.\n\nThe band have had several line up changes over their career, but the set up that they had when I saw them perform live was awesome, and all of the musicians seemed really tight in their performance. There were some absolutely incredible instrumental solos throughout the performance, and the more the audience cheered, the longer they would continue for, which was epic and something you really can’t experience from a recording.\n\nThey mainly played from their newest album Nemesis, as well as revisiting some of the older hits, as there were some long time fans at the concert, and the band seemed conscious of pleasing everyone, which was great. They were wonderful at getting the audience to join in, and cut off their vocals occasionally in their choruses to allow the crowd to fill it in. They will definitely convert you into a fan if you’re not already.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nOne of the best concerts in my life!! An unforgettable experience at meet&greet! Every one of the band members was so kind and friendly and very openhearted! It was my pleasure to see them performing live! The best part of the show was the last song \"Hunting High and Low\", were they sung with the crowd! Stratovarius is one of the greatest bands on the planet and it would be a shame not to see them if they are in your country.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThe band was awesome, as always. But the place they choose to play ... oh boy .... it is like an abandoned building, not comfortable whatsoever.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken they came to Poland, 5 years ago, and the vocalist commented that it was 15, for sure they don't remember when the place is that bad ...\n\nHope to see the in Warsaw again, but in a better concert hall.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
