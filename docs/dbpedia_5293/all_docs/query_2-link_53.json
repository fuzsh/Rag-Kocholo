        "text": "Ok, this has been bothering me for a while. I get crap from the prisoners, from strangers, hell even from our own Caid. WHY THE HATE ON POWER METAL?!?!?!? Seriously, I don’t understand it. Is it because they sing about dragons? Is it cause they sing about fighting in medieval Europe alongside King Arthur? What, what is it? People say power metal is not “brutal” enough, or is “pansy” metal. Why? Is it because they can actually sing and play their instruments with good skill? I enjoy listening to death and black metal as much as the next guy, but sometimes I actually want to be able to understand what my vocalist is singing about, not Cookie Monster vocals with maximum distortion on them. I want to be able to hear a guitar solo that actually uses all six strings on the guitar, not just the one. Is that too much to ask? And I can guarantee you that power metal has been around longer than these other genres and will continue to exist even after those have gone.\n\nLet me give you a brief history of the great genre of dragons. Power metal is a style of heavy metal music combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed or thrash metal, often within symphonic context. The term refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe and Japan with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.\n\nPower metal is today associated with an epic sound tempered by characteristics of speed metal, power metal’s musical forerunner. Power metal’s lyrical themes, though as varied as metal itself, typically focus on fantasy, mythology, camaraderie, hope, personal struggles, emotions, war, and death.\n\nPower metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with “clean” vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals. The majority of the genre’s vocalists sing in the tenor range, capable of hitting very high notes. There are however many exceptions such as Pyramaze / Iced Earth frontman Matt Barlow, Falconer frontman Mathais Blad, and Sabaton frontman Joakim Broden; they sing in either baritone or bass range, though in certain songs like Creator Failure, Barlow hits very high notes reminiscent of Rob Halford. Power metal vocalists Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, andHansi Kurch of Blind Guardian record multi-layered vocals reminiscent of Queen, creating a choral effect.\n\nPower metal guitarists and bassists generally play rapid streams of notes, but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower. Fast and demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed.\n\nA number of power metal drummers generally play with two bass drums for added speed, utilizing them to play a constant stream of sixteenth notes with snare drum accents on the beat. This style is fairly common in power metal as in other heavy metal subgenres, though it is by no means universal. Power metal though has become the most prevalent in the use of this technique.\n\nPower metal bands often incorporate keyboards into their musical arrangements, something popularized by Jens Johansson of Stratovarius, though their usage varies from subtle accents to a full-blown melody line. Some symphonic power metal bands such as Rhapsody of Fire, Fairyland and Nightwish have also been known to record with more symphonic elements, and as such, they utilize a full orchestra to fill the role a keyboard plays in other power metal bands.\n\nNotable Power Metal Bands:\n\n3 Inches of Blood\n\nAvantasia\n\nBattlelore\n\nBlack Majesty\n\nBlind Guardian\n\nChinchilla\n\nCircle II Circle\n\nDemons & Wizards\n\nDragonforce\n\nDream Evil\n\nEdguy\n\nElvenking\n\nExcalion\n\nFairyland\n\nFalconer\n\nFirewind\n\nFreedom Call\n\nGalneryus\n\nGamma Ray\n\nGrave Digger\n\nHammerFall\n\nHelloween\n\nIced Earth\n\nIron Fire\n\nInto Eternity\n\nJacob’s Dream\n\nJag Panzer\n\nKamelot\n\nLabyrinth\n\nLost Horizon\n\nManowar\n\nMetalium\n\nMystic Prophecy\n\nNarnia\n\nNightwish\n\nNocturnal Rites\n\nPagan’s Mind\n\nPyramaze\n\nRaintime\n\nRhapsody of Fire\n\nSabaton\n\nSaxon\n\nSonata Arctica\n\nSteel Attack\n\nStratovarius\n\nSymphony X\n\nTwilightning\n\nVision Divine\n\nWizard\n\nFor More See Here\n\nAid for History Came From Wikipedia"
