        "text": "Anyway, here are some power metal albums I enjoy, with favorites in yellow. Of course, some of these are not really bona fide power metal, rather a bit more overdriven heavy metal albums, but the sound is close enough.\n\nGerman speed and power metal:\n\nHelloween - Walls of Jericho\n\nHelloween - Keeper of the Seven Keys, parts 1 & 2\n\nRunning Wild - Under Jolly Roger\n\nRunning Wild - Port Royal\n\nRunning Wild - Death or Glory\n\nRunning Wild - Blazon Stone\n\nRage - Execution Guaranteed\n\nRage - Perfect Man\n\nParadox - Heresy\n\nGamma Ray - Heading for Tomorrow\n\nBlind Guardian - everything up to and including A Night at the Opera\n\nUS power and progressive metal:\n\nQueensryche - Queensryche EP\n\nQueensryche - The Warning\n\nSavatage - Sirens\n\nSavatage - The Dungeons are Calling EP\n\nSavatage - Hall of the Mountain King\n\nSavatage - Gutter Ballet\n\nJag Panzer - Ample Destruction\n\nHelstar - Burning Star\n\nHelstar - Remnants of War\n\nHelstar - A Distant Thunder\n\nHelstar - Nosferatu\n\nFates Warning - Night on Brocken\n\nFates Warning - The Spectre Within\n\nFates Warning - Awaken the Guardian\n\nHeir Apparent - Graceful Inheritance\n\nCrimson Glory - Crimson Glory\n\nCrimson Glory - Transcendence\n\nIced Earth - Night of the Stormrider\n\nIced Earth - Burnt Offerings\n\nAn anomaly from UK :\n\nElixir - The Son of Odin\n\n\"Modern\" power & progressive metal:\n\nAngra - Angels Cry\n\nConception - The Last Sunset\n\nConception - Parallel Minds\n\nConception - In Your Multitude\n\nKamelot - The Fourth Legacy\n\nKamelot - Karma\n\nSymphony X - The Damnation Game\n\nSymphony X - The Divine Wings of Tragedy\n\nSymphony X - Twilight in Olympus\n\nHammerfall - Glory to the Brave\n\nLabyrinth - Return to Heaven Denied\n\nLabyrinth - Sons of Thunder\n\nRhapsody - Legendary Tales\n\nStratovarius - Episode\n\nStratovarius - Visions\n\nWolf - Wolf\n\nYou beat me!\n\nSeriously, anyone who doesn't know Into The Mirror Black, really do give it a go. Try the title track and Communion.\n\nSome of Sanctuary formed Nevermore by the way, after their first breakup. But The Mirror Black is far better than anything Nevermore ever did.\n\nI went to a festival recently because Sanctuary were on the bill, recently reformed after 20 or so years. I was creaming with excitement but I was amazed at how unbothered most of the crowd were. At the signing room thing, there was hardly anyone queuing up for them, whereas Testament had a massive queue of hundreds of people that took forever to get through....\n\n*bump*\n\nHelloween's Keeper of the Seven Keys, Pt. 1 is rather widely considered to be one of the blueprints for this particular genre.\n\nI'd like to add Sabaton to this thread, since I think they qualify as power metal.\n\nQuestion: I've always regarded Manowar as a power metal-act, but I'd like to know what people here think? They're hardly overlooked, I know, but since people here have mentioned Iced Earth and Blind Guardian, bands who are scarcely perceived as obscure representatives of this genre, I might as well add these guys to the discussion.\n\nSome of it is power metal, especially later stuff like Louder Than Hell, while the 80s albums are mostly just plain old heavy metal. In my opinion. Of course, it's not like there are clear demarcation lines between these subgenres, so it's hard to tell sometimes. Personally, I file Manowar along with Priest, Maiden and Ozzy, rather than with Helloween, BG, or Iced Earth. But that doesn't mean their sound isn't close to power metal, and they were without a doubt massively influential on that subgenre.\n\nI don't like stringent definitions beyond Heavy Rock or Metal because during a band's career/album's length, you can often encounter multiple styles of music that are redolent of so much more than some strait jacketed categorization might suggest and perhaps, demand.\n\nEarly Manowar is a flavour of Metal more generally akin in attitude to Mercyful Fate, certainly to these ears, in parts and then something like Fighting The World sounds almost dreadfully commercial because of the (huge leap [I'm not so sure?] in) super clean sound quality.\n\nLouder Than Hell is a tremendously heavy sound although a tad too banal of content, even given the latitude I'll always grant Joey & Co. but overall, their total (studio) catalogue is something very dear to my (Metal) heart.\n\nWhat about Accept, upto and including Balls To The Wall? Restless And Wild is their Screaming For Vengeance and a definite contender for access to Metal's baronetcy.\n\nAl, I don't consider any of these bands Power Metal, just Heavy Metal.\n\nOK, there's no denying characteristic, generic traits between bands, perhaps in recent years where they consciously cite influences and then explicitly replicate that style but when we're looking at some of the grand daddies of Metal, I don't think these restrictive guidelines apply.\n\nI was thinking about those old Rolling Stone reviews of Sabbath and whilst my initial reaction was dismissive (putting it politely,) I then imagined the situation these guys were in at the start of the 70's and in that context, perhaps, you could empathize with some of their cynicism?\n\nOnly from the perspective that as a (rock) music fan during that epoch, you were experiencing a time when the eureka moments of 50's and early 60's developments were still relatively fresh in the memory whilst the likes of 'old slow hand' Clapton, Hendrix, Beck, et al plus outfits like Cream, etc. must have been like cultural dynamite: it's a generation just before Yours Truly but in their position, would I so happily cede creative primacy to people you might feel derivative?\n\nAfter all, my personal guitar doyen, Blackmore, would probably be first among his equals to declare a more overt plagiaristic tendency - not that such analysis dims my worship of this generation whom I still revere as pioneers.\n\nSorry, went a bit off topic, there!"
