        "text": "Long gone are times when we split everything between Hard Rock and its younger sibling Heavy Metal. Being a metalhead really meant you went to a Heavy Metal concert and bought comfortable vinyl in a music store. Straightforward bands like Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Krokus, Metallica, or Black Sabbath played, and you knew them all.\n\nSince then, people developed this inbred and somewhat insane need to give a new name to every friggin’ undercurrent of the metal universe. This annoying temptation to put everything into little boxes is called Divide Et Impera (divide and conquer). Or in other words: If you can’t convince them, confuse them. Much ink has already been spilled to explain all this stuff in elaborate detail to folks – even books were written about that subject. Forsooth!\n\nSo, I have given in to the temptation to go down the thorny route of Metal Silo Management. But I will try to be a bit more concise and not too wordy in the description below. After all, this is to provide a reference, but don’t quote me on that later.\n\n#1 – Heavy Metal\n\nThis style emerged from Hard Rock (or simply Rock) way back in the late ’60s to early ’70s. Probably with the aforementioned Black Sabbath as the first band to explore this cold and hard road.\n\nHowever, the style back then does not much resemble today’s metal anymore. And only a few bands still long for the old and initial style. Heavy Metal originated from Blues Rock and the more psychedelic rock versions. At that time, it was an antidote to the flowery pop-rock crowd – the ‘make love, not war’ movement – that was so overpoweringly present.\n\nLater, Heavy Metal (and Hard Rock) somehow got onto the backburner with other flashy music directions emerging on top. Some teeth-grinding flappy stuff that better remains unnamed. But by the early ’80s, there was a massive comeback of this genre and it remained popular ever since. It is amazing to see how Heavy Metal bands can still fill whole arenas without much effort in advertising – old geezers included.\n\nOr should I say, especially the seasoned old guys? They’re not getting younger, for sure. But their fare is still as much in demand as it was decades ago. With fans of all ages filling their venues. Heavy Metal is indeed at the source of many of the advertised sub-genres. You can even invent your own if that takes your fancy. Nothing holds you back. At the end of the day, all that you folks like to decorate yourself with is Heavy Metal, the Mother of Metal.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nUsually lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass, drums\n\nGuitars distorted, heavy massive sound, relatively little to no use of keyboards.\n\nGuitar riffs are often employed.\n\nVery loud, somewhat repetitive drum work, usually pretty simple in pattern.\n\nUsually, high-pitched vocals delivered in clear voice, and lyrics are often difficult to understand.\n\nHeavy Metal often tries to create an aggressive pseudo-occult atmosphere overall in demeanor, songwriting, and delivery, whereas never as menacing as some of the Black Metal sub-culture try to be.\n\nThe genre’s early offerings also often used daemonic antics for added spice . And whilst the early bands were often decried as satanists or the famed devil’s children, none of them were anywhere near the depravity some of Death and Black Metal’s best displayed.\n\nTypical bands on this blog are Black Sabbath, Dio, AC/DC, Iron Maiden.\n\n#2 – Gothic Metal\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Gothic Metal is that it originates mainly from Northern Europe back in the ’90s. With some exceptions (Moonspell, for example), there seem to be lots of doom and gloom starting from The Netherlands northwards. It appears this also impacts other genres – like Black Metal. Interestingly, the Gothic Metal movement somehow syncs with Symphonic Metal or morphed into said genre.\n\nAt the outset, Gothic Metal was an offshoot of sorts from Death and Doom Metal styles with origins in Gothic Rock, usually with a growler in the band. Very soon this was abandoned by most bands and they shifted over into the Symphonic Metal arena with operatic/bombastic interludes.\n\nInterestingly, no band can these days really be labeled Gothic Metal in the proper sense, whereas we could argue that the original Gothic-Rock-turned-Metal bands could be the ones. Also, many a band had their ‘gothic spell’ until they didn’t. One also finds a special brand of Gothic Metal featuring female fronts as main actors with a somewhat monotonous vocal delivery in some sort of story format (the now-defunct Lenore S. Fingers or Lindsay Schoolcraft for instance).\n\nIn reality, many outfits wear the Gothic Metal badge, ranging from Symphonic Metal over Cinematic Metal to Doom Metal. The genre is said to support the Goth subculture, which in itself is more mellow than the harsher sounds other metal styles revel in. And consequently, GM is shunned by many of the harsher genres.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nOften female-fronted but there is no hard rule to that.\n\nSome female-fronted bands may have male growlers on their crew. This is on the decline, though.\n\nOne or several guitars, heavy use of keyboards, pretty elaborate drum patterns often using double blast beats.\n\nSofter and more melodic than your usual Heavy Metal. Often interspersed by airy passages and peppered with guitar riffs and solos.\n\nThe music should project a dark atmosphere – whatever that may mean.\n\nLyrics often deal with doom and gloom without displaying the characteristics of a Doom Metal band. Not the slow-motion funeral pace the latter genre excels in.\n\nTypical bands on this blog are Moonspell, Nightwish – usually active in Symphonic Metal, but nonetheless , Evanescence, Inno, Deathless Legacy, and many more.\n\n#3 – Symphonic Metal\n\nThis metal subgenre is very difficult to disengage from Gothic Metal, as both often form one symbiotic existence. Symphonic Metal originated from the cold North of Europe as well but developed into a more bombastic genre than Gothic Metal ever was.\n\nSome bands ‘specialize’ in a more cinematic approach, letting their music sound like some sort of movie without being one (Illuminata, for instance). Or some forget that they’re not a computer game. Others have moved to an operatic/bombastic style, and not always to their advantage. Others still don’t quite know where to draw the line between Power Metal and their symphonic urges. An ongoing existential crisis in the making, like.\n\nAnd that led some of the most successful outfits out there to lose their marbles and go off the deep end. But then, it’s a bitch to constantly reinvent yourselves when regurgitating the same old shit with a slightly different flavor is that much easier. Ain’t it, Within Temptation? Now, with Symphonic Metal’s heyday over, a fucking army of copycats and make-believes gleefully filled the mighty empty space that opened in the wake of the big bands out there. Meaning, after 2010 or so, quality crumbled to miserable levels in one of the once most promising genres of metal history.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nUsually female-fronted, often by classically trained vocalists.\n\nSometimes they have a male growler in the band, but this has become rarer.\n\nBands with a male growler are often using the ‘Beauty and the Beast’ concept, creating some sort of dialogue between the beauty (the female vocalist) and the beast (the growler) exchanging lines of lyrics. Check Epica for more.\n\nUse of electric and acoustic guitars, abundant use of keyboards, and sometimes archaic instruments.\n\nPretty elaborate use of drum work, often using blast beats to emphasize the tune.\n\nMore or less heavy use of classical orchestras (or the synthesized equivalent of it). Some bands have taken to using full classical orchestras.\n\nTypical bands on this webzine are Epica , Illuminata , Within Temptation, Nightwish, Stream of Passion, Diabulus in Musica, and many more.\n\n#4 – Death Metal\n\nAh, yes – Death Metal. The holdall of many sins committed in the metal multiverse. DM feels like the vile sibling of many other metal genres out there. The genre emerged during the mid-80s in the US and Europe through bands like Celtic Frost, Venom, or – again – Slayer. It is a bit unclear where this genre emerged from. Some say it found its existence out of Black Metal, others state that it emerged as a derivative of Thrash and Heavy Metal. The development of the genre then intensified with DM from Scandinavian origins making its appearance (Swedeath, for example).\n\nOften used for unpleasant themes such as violence, emotion, gore, horror, death, religious or demonic subjects to state just a few, this genre is always linked to brutality or violent events of sorts. Some bands like Cannibal Corpse – for instance – outdo themselves with often sexually-oriented, overly gory, and plainly unacceptable album covers. Unacceptable by the public at large but – apparently – entirely in line with the large fanbase these bands still generate. Any way to generate some fucking clickbait goes, right? Well, it seems there is a certain Neanderthal urge with many of the Death Metal fanbase. Y’know, the times when brutes – supposedly – dragged their female companions around the fire by their hair after consuming too much animal flesh.\n\nOver the years, the use of Death Metal grew in popularity and spawned a number of important sub-genres that frequently make an appearance on RMR as well. After all, anything goes with Death Metal – there are no major restrictions as with Black Metal. Sub-genres like Melodic Death Metal, Technical Death Metal, Slam, Brutal Death Metal, and their weird brethren like Deathgrind, Goregrind, or Pornogrind or any other ‘core variations that may spring to mind. The genre also blatantly reaches into blackened realms through abundant use of tremolo picking, for example.\n\nTrve Death Metal adepts won’t allow for the use of clear voice vocals, whereas some of the sub-genres like Melodic Death Metal definitely sport an often juicy mix of growls and clears. Others like Brutal Death Metal use typical deep-throated growls or any other selection of squeals, grunts, or snarls. And some bands truly overdo it to the point that this sounds like pigs in a barn.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nMale or female-fronted, no hard rules.\n\nTypical, full-throated growls, gurgles, and squeals.\n\nClear voice or shouted vocals are sometimes heard for some of the more accessible sub-genres.\n\nOne or two downturned lead guitars, rhythm guitar, bass, and some use of keyboards depending on the style direction. On rare occasions, one can find some symphonic elements added to the wall of sound.\n\nAbrupt changes in tempi, atonality, palm muting, abundant use of tremolo for some bands, highly complex drum patterns, and double-blast bass kicks.\n\nSub-genres like Technical Death Metal will take the point above to the next level by adding unusual time signatures, atypical rhythms, and often weird harmonies and melodies coupled with undue speed. It however remains one of the sturdiest and most interesting segments of Death Metal proper.\n\nTypical bands on this blog are Arch Enemy, Insomnium, Cattle Decapitation, Fallujah, Raider, and many more.\n\n#5 – Doom Metal\n\nThis genre – by its name – tries to create an atmosphere of impending doom, desperation, and despair. To do that, it often employs a slow-paced, very heavy sound. Originating directly from Heavy Metal (and sometimes intricately interlinked), the genre traditionally often uses sequences like the triton, also called the Devil Tone.\n\nThe vocals usually lurch forward in clear vocals in a way to convey sadness and tribulation. Others borrow from the aforementioned Death Metal realm by adding its heavy beat and abundant growls. After all, the use of growls is by far the best way to express doom and despair. And in truth, many bands nowadays solely use growls (Death Doom Metal) or a combination of clear and unclear vocals.\n\nIn other words, the genre genuinely tries to depict negative emotions in musical form. And if that sounds difficult, it bloody well is. Thus, many a doom band out there goes through the motions but miserably fails.\n\nThe now seriously split Black Sabbath are often accused of being at the outset of this style. Poor guys, they seem to be guilty of everything. The very heavy sound sometimes gives you the impression of pounding you into the dust, often almost hypnotic in style.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nOften male-fronted. There are exceptions, Draconian being one of them, with a female vocalist sharing the space with a male growler.\n\nVocals can come in clear voice or growls, as the band style demands.\n\nThe lyrics deal with – surprise – depression, doom, and despair.\n\nTraditional Heavy Metal lineup, highly distorted guitars, bass, rhythm guitar, typical drum-work.\n\nPowerful guitar riffs with solos matching the pace.\n\nSome symphonic elements and limited use of keyboards sometimes make their appearance.\n\nTypical bands on this webzine: Paradise Lost, Crypt Sermon, My Silent Wake (more Death Doom Metal), Draconian, My Dying Bride, Isole, and Elderseer.\n\n#6 – Progressive Metal\n\nWhenever we have no clue what to call it, we name it progressive! Right? Well, there is some truth in that. But this kind of opinion is a tad simplistic, too. Progressive Metal has been with us since the early 70s or so. Just think Uriah Heep or Jethro Tull, both of whom spearheaded today’s genre with Progressive Rock. Records that still resonate to this day.\n\nProgressive Metal is one of the most difficult genres in rock and metal. And there is a reason why specialists say that only seasoned musicians will be able to play this kind of tune to any degree of quality. This is a genre where anything goes, short of going full speed into psychedelic or alternative realms. And in truth, those three genres often overlap. That leads to truly unusual and often genial compositions not often employed by ‘normal’ metal bands.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nEither female or male-fronted, no specific rule or preference to that.\n\nVocals usually come in clear voice. Some bands like Haken like or liked to inject A Capella-style performances into their records. One can find growls in prog, too, in some of the sub-genres.\n\nVocals and instrumental work are more melodious and varied than the rest of their metal brethren.\n\nOften a typical line-up is established – lead and rhythm guitars, bass, and drums as a base. Then added to that are keyboards, sometimes extensively so, and any type of acoustic instrument.\n\nProgressive Metal is usually not that heavy, very often focused on djent-influenced stretches of music. However, more modern prog pieces are much less dependent on djentology. Instead, some of them now employ a style that gets a tad too near to Technical Metal than is good for it.\n\nChanges in tempi, styles, and – to an extent – experimentation with the instruments, speed, and blatantly stealing from other genres give this genre a very special flavor.\n\nOften a sturdy theme is used and lyrics warranting your attention. This is contrary to some of the more restricted genres such as Black Metal.\n\nTypical bands on RMR are earlier Steven Wilson, Guilt Machine, Haken, Need, or Caligula’s Horse.\n\n#7 Black Metal\n\nYeah, you heard that one right. They crept up on me, the unholy Satanists. The opposition party to the geezer, the undead, and the other one. And they come with a ton of unsavory minions, bad breath or not. So, funk that, BM is just about satanic cults and enjoying the writhing altar, right? Jobs done, like. Nothing more to see here.\n\nNope, it is – of course – not as simple as that. You will certainly remember the section about Heavy Metal, right? Back in the ’70s and ’80s, when this metal thing all started, the old folks in charge openly called for a ban on those satanic messages.\n\nLittle did they know that soon thereafter a wave of vile metal would merge. Churchburners with the mark of the devil in full swing. But is this really so?\n\nSome bands openly declare Satanism to be their goal, but others will turn towards paganism as their credo. Others again constructed musical fantasy worlds based on the Black Metal style (Summoning, Caladan Brood). This renders this genre one of the most interesting and versatile ones, even if many of the mainstream metal genres seriously frown on them. Be this as it will, though. The powerful metal these folks bring to the table is often amazing. Putting the spiked fist division aside, there are Black Metal acts out there that will blow you away.\n\nThe style initially emerged in Europe back in the ’80s and really took off with a Scandinavian drive (no kidding…) in the ’90s. As we said before, casual listeners may not necessarily like this. But some of that stuff is really technically advanced. But be careful when meeting them in a dark alley on your own anyway. You never know! There are true psychopaths amongst them.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nHigh-pitch rasps for most acts, however clean singing or Death Metal style growls have also been observed.\n\nMostly male-fronted, yet there are exceptions and very good ones.\n\nUse of tremolo picking for guitars. Heavily downturned, burly riffing.\n\nOften heavy double-blast beats on drum bass. Heavy, pounding drum patterns.\n\nPretty abundant use of keyboards for some.\n\nUse of dissonance with disrupted, unconventional song structures.\n\nProjection of a dark, heavy, and often daemonic atmosphere.\n\nBand members perform live with heavy corpse paint or in disguise. Abundant use of nicknames.\n\nMany bands don’t perform live and wish to remain totally anonymous. Some of them see their performances as a black mass, not destined for the grand public. Or perform rituals outright.\n\nBlack Metal on RMR: Myrkur, Batushka, Caladan Brood, Balfor, Seth, Corpus Diavolis, and many more.\n\n#8 Power Metal\n\nHaha, it finally grew on us. Overwhelmed by a deluge of fondue and shiny metal objects, the RMR crew gave in and enjoyed some of those terrible cheesy-sugary delights Power Metal has on offer. Many of the grouchier metalheads disapprove of this Metal of the Light thing. Too clear-voice, too much energy, and – besides – you can’t have positives or abject silliness. But, bottom line is, there’s a lot of good to great PM out there that the RMR reviewers would be remiss not to cover.\n\nMuch of the Power Metal community navigates somewhere in fantasy or science-fiction waters. Whereas others try to use it for a vector to rock about some scientific theme or other. Yet, many bands take it to the next level and try to outsmart all others with undue bombast – and sometimes outright stupidity. Which led the RMR review desk to issue a ban on some of them for any and all future records that these specific bands might still release.\n\nPower Metal emerged as a speedy version of Heavy Metal and is very close to what the Symphonic Metal folks usually produce. The idea is to produce metal with an uplifting, harmonious, lighter sound full of catchy songs with sing-along refrains. In short, it’s everything no Doom Metal adept will ever want to hear. Furthermore, it appears that the first traces of this style were detected back in the ’70s (yet again).\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nMale or female-fronted, whatever takes the band’s fancy. Some bands even opted for up to three vocalists, just to add to the confusion (Temperance, for example).\n\nUsually high-pitched clear voice vocals. Some of them use typical Heavy Metal screams in their offerings (Unleash the Archers, for instance).\n\nBombastic, dramatic, high-speed, and soaring sound. Power Metal tries to project a positive, even happy sound (no dissonance here).\n\nA penchant for theatrical, even cinematic performances.\n\nAbundant use of fast shredding with elaborate, high-pitched solos.\n\nSuperfast and elaborate drum patterns, some with double blast beats.\n\nAlbums often come with a solid theme based on fantasy, medieval lore, history in general, or contemporary issues. Often a storyline is used to guide the record.\n\nTypical Power Metal bands at RMR: Evermore, Kamelot, Blind Guardian, Frozen Crown, Fellowship, and many more.\n\nEd’s note: This edition replaces the version of March 2016.\n\nThe Olde Footnote!"
