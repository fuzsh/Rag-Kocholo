        "text": "World-renowned power metal legends Stratovarius have returned with a brand new single entitled \"Survive\" which features as the title track for their first album in almost a decade. To coincide with the announcement, the band has released a music video which can be seen below.\n\nThe band's first full-length release since 2015's Eternal, Survive marks a continuation of two major themes that have been consistent with their music since the beginning: humanity's future and the environment. With the current global situation surrounding climate change and the growing popularity of new forms of energy, this record and Stradivarius's music is as relevant as ever.\n\nAccording to the band, Survive's core message is one of struggle, defiance, hope, and victory. Keyboardist Jens Johansson described the writing process for the title track as one that seemed to work itself out perfectly, cementing the song as an important moment in the band's history.\n\n\"We spent five or six days solid, trying to come up with the lyrics for that song,\" said Johansson. \"When we finally settled on that punchline for the chorus, it was a good song about survival, and it all just seemed to fit. It fits with the history of the band, too, because we managed to survive as long as we have.\"\n\n\"This band has been through some strange days! The original lineup formed in 1984, so it's been a long story,\" he continued, \"It was the middle of the summer, there were forest fires everywhere, there was a global pandemic, and all kinds of crazy shit was going on. Some of the lyrics are perhaps less uplifting than they could have been, but that reflects our mood at the time. There's a lot of positive stuff on there, as well!\"\n\nListen to \"Survive\" below and view the album art and track listing for the new Stratovarius record further down the page. Look for the album to drop on Sept. 23 through earMUSIC and pre-order your copy here.\n\nStratovarius, \"Survive\" Lyrics (via AZ Lyrics)\n\nI have seen the truth, I've seen it in my dream\n\nI have found my voice, but don't know what to say\n\nFor I have lost my way and no-one's here to find me\n\nI loathe my loneliness, I hate the emptiness\n\nI'm hanging on a wire\n\nAblaze and set on fire\n\nWaiting for the crack to come\n\nI snap and let it go\n\nI fall\n\nThrough the darkness\n\nAbout to lose it all\n\nI fall\n\nAgainst the odds I played and lost it all\n\nSaw the future, now it's gone\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nI will try to find the strength inside\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nI will not give up, as long as I'm alive\n\nI will not give in, as long as I'm alive\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nAn eternal road where demons go to die\n\nRuns through this barren land where my madness lies\n\nHave I now lost my mind\n\nAm I mute, deaf and blind\n\nI scream without a sound\n\nI just can't let it out\n\nI fall\n\nThrough the darkness\n\nAbout to lose it all\n\nI fall\n\nAgainst the odds I played and lost it all\n\nSaw the future, now it's gone\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nI will try to find the strength inside\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nI will not give up, as long as I'm alive\n\nI will not give in, as long as I'm alive\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nThe future's not bright but it's mine\n\nI won't lie, there's no hope in sight but I'll survive\n\nI will try to find the strength...\n\nI will try to find the strength inside\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nI will not give up, as long as I'm alive\n\nI will not give in, as long as I'm alive\n\nI will not give up, as long as I'm alive\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nOnly the strong will survive\n\nStratovarius, \"Survive\"\n\nStratovarius, Survive Album Art + Track Listing\n\n01. \"Survive\"\n\n02. \"Demand\"\n\n03. \"Broken\"\n\n04. \"Firefly\"\n\n05. \"We Are Not Alone\"\n\n06. \"Frozen in Time\"\n\n07. \"World on Fire\"\n\n08. \"Glory Days\"\n\n09. \"Breakaway\"\n\n10. \"Before the Fall\"\n\n11. \"Voice of Thunder\""
