        "text": "Finland’s Finest Fires On All Cylinders\n\nThe long wait is over as Finland’s Power Metal legends Stratovarius have released the follow up to 2015’s Eternal, titled Survive out on earMUSIC records. This reviewer is happy to announce that the almost 7 year wait is more than worth it as the new album has everything any Stratovarius fan could ever hope for, and more. The lineup has stayed constant with founder Timo Kotipelto leading the band with his signature vocal melodies, anthemic qualities and beautiful harmonies.\n\nGlory Days Still Ahead\n\nSurvive is the Stratovarius spirit in musical form, full of dynamics, drama, and emotion. The album’s core message is one of struggle, defiance, hope and victory. Epitomized by its rousing title track. few bands have the longevity and ability to continually better their output of music, especially when they are known for being one of the founders of their genre, but like Helloween, Stratovarius is one of those bands.\n\nFinal Notes\n\nStratovarius – Survive has the top notch production you’ve come to expect. It has the stunning performances by every band member you’ve come to appreciate, and the anthemic, sing along melodies that you’ve come to know and love. Every track on this record is 100% Stratovarius, and done to perfection. The long wait is over, so show your love and buy this album. A diamond on the crown of a this groups career that defines their genre over and over. Stratovarius – Survive equals Power Metal personified.\n\nLineup\n\nTimo Kotipelto – vocals\n\nJens Johansson – keyboard\n\nLauri Porra – bass, backing vocals\n\nMatias Kupiainen – guitars, backing vocals\n\nRolf Pilve – drums\n\nSurvive – Tracklist"
