        "text": "Over the last few years, I’ve been writing articles, giving speeches, and designing projects based on language use in the Japanese (extreme) metal scene. As a result, I have also been listening to a large number of Japanese bands. It’s getting to the point where I can’t remember them all, and this is a problem for me as a lot are really good… so I have decided to make a little online database here where I can write them down, talk about them, and provide some recommendations. I hope this list isn’t just of use for me though, and can provide fans of metal with a good introduction to the diversity of really great music that makes up the current Japanese scene.\n\nThe list below is simply alphabetical, and I’ll keep updating it over the next few years as I find new bands. Originally, I thought I’d write this as neutral as possible, but I found that was impossible. Even trying to keep things unbiased, I noted that it was clear which bands I liked more just through how I wrote explanations of their styles. So while I’m still going to try to avoid critiquing or singing a band’s praises too blatantly, do keep in mind that this guide is very colored by my personal tastes. Still, there are no bands here that I do not enjoy to at least some extent. All these groups – at worst – do a good job, and weave novel and sometime Japanese-influenced musical approaches into metal in ways that can be blunt, subtle, great, and mediocre, but are minimally never boring. All in all, my goal here is to help people access some of the great music that’s coming out of Japan, with an emphasis on promoting the diversity of styles and ideas (including those I don’t actually vibe with that much) that exist throughout the scene.\n\nThe list starts right below, with the letter “A”. But if you just want to jump in, I’ve also build a Spotify playlist of my recommended tracks for each band. You can check it out via this player or the attached link:\n\nAldious\n\nAldious is one of the most well-known bands in what’s called the “Girls’ Metal (ガールズメタル)” boom. The band broadly fits into the “power metal” genre, but I kind of think they sound like a slower, less angry Megadeth. Don’t take that as a positive or a negative! The band just have a very classic thrashy/power style, but with a melodic and modern approach that doesn’t hesitate to include slower songs as well, and is built around clean vocals rather than a dirty growl. They are also happy to have verses just let the guitar hold some chords open while the bass and drums pull the rhythm forward, which reduces the overall “heaviness” of some tracks but does open them up to breathe. The vocals definitely also draw on Japanese styles and rhythms a bit, which might be hit or miss if you aren’t used to it… but I’d say is worth getting used to as you’ll find that almost every band on this list is drawing on the history of music in Japan pre-metal in at least some way.\n\nThat said, Aldious has been around for quite a while, releasing their first album in 2010, and has gone through three singers in that time, so it’s tricky to really nail their sound down at times. Personally, I prefer their older releases, but their newer stuff definitely shows the band growing and has a constant increase in production values. I think District Zero (2013), which has their first singer, is probably the strongest album as a whole. However, none of the tracks I added to the playlist are from that CD, so, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\nAs I’m not usually the biggest fan of power metal or slower songs with clean vocals, Aldious doesn’t regularly make my playlist. But if you want to hear some really solid guitar playing backed up by an insanely tight drum and bass, they are definitely a group worth checking out.\n\nAllegiance Reign\n\nAllegiance Reign are a samurai/sengoku-jidai themed battle metal band. Unlike a number of other samurai-themed bands on this list, the group combines both English and Japanese lyrics, but their focus is nevertheless on themes of warfare and battle in pre-modern Japan.\n\nThe band’s songs are all upbeat, with some great energy and general composition skills. Sassa, the singer, has a strong, high shout that really works with the band’s overall style, and the group as a whole does a good job of adding some Japanese instruments (usually via a keyboard) into the mix. The group only has one album out so far, but songs like the single Ei Ei O (above), March of Warriors, and Heaps of Bodies and Streams of Blood (one song) are all great examples of what they can do. What really elevates this group is their quality of riffing, with each track featuring some really catchy passages that cover a diverse range of tempos and sounds, and the overall passion they bring to each track. In addition to just being good music, the band’s first album is just a positive experience, and I find myself hard to listen to it without smiling.\n\nAmiliyah\n\nOut of all the bands on this list, Amiliyah is probably the most interesting in terms of their overall image. The band started in 2014, and is built around a rather complex “lore” that makes all their albums concept albums in a way. Basically, the singer of the band is a princess from a “country of light” that was otherwise destroyed, but was saved by monsters and now travels looking for a magical wish amulet to save her fantasy kingdom. You can read the overview here. So, of course, the band members are all dressed as monsters, elves, and other fantasy creatures besides the singer, who is the princess. You can see this in the video below, which is set in the high-fantasy setting of a… high school?\n\nAnyway, Amiliyah’s sound is sort of a mix of symphonic metal, industrial-tinged goth rock, and nu-metal, and – thanks to the quality of the musicianship throughout the band – they do a really good job mixing these styles together. To be blunt though, their first few albums suffer from pretty mediocre production values. There’s a lot of potential – the vocals are good and the bass, guitar, drums, and keyboards are all doing interesting things – but everything sounds incredibly washed out and flat. The 2018 album Departure was the first one where the potential of the band’s sound actually comes through fully, but they really upped their game in 2019 when they released Beyond the Sea and added two violinists to their lineup. The increase in the variety of sounds, as well as just general increase in the band’s skills as songwriters, has really paid off, and resulted in by far their tightest, most daring, and most interesting release. Indeed, it seems like the band itself has realized how much better they sound now, as in 2021 they released the album Best Your Selection Adding Violins, which re-recorded earlier tracks but with better production and their two violinists.\n\nWhile I certainly don’t think the prior albums are bad, Departure and Best Your Selection are definitely the places to start. Together, the albums serve as strong examples of what the band is trying to do with their sound and style currently, the diversity of ideas they’ve had so far, and the interesting directions they are growing in.\n\nAncient Myth\n\nAncient Myth is a band Encylopaedia Metallum describes as “symphonic power metal“, which I guess isn’t the worst take. The group certainly is symphonic, and has an approach to metal which relies a lot on violins and keys to create its atmosphere. The term “power metal” though seems a bit inappropriate, and, as you’ll find, I’m going to complain about Encyclopaedia Metallum lazily chucking Japanese bands under this bus throughout this article. Ancient Myth’s singer’s style is certainly operatic and they definitely have some power-metal-influenced riffs, but the band doesn’t go for the type of solos or overall approach to metal you might expect from, say, Dragonforce. The group has a definite influence from metal inspired by gothic and symphonic black metal bands as well, and this is clearly evident even in the way they stylize and present themselves in their videos and promotion.\n\nAncient Myth have been around since 2004, but besides the singer the longest active member of their lineup joined in 2016. So you probably won’t be surprised to find that their albums often sound a bit different. That said, the band’s singer clearly serves as a major source of their creative direction, as there is definitely a stylistic force uniting all the work to date. The band’s newest release, which the single above is from, isn’t available publicly online, so I’m not sure what the full thing sounds like, but I quite like the sound the band had on the album Aberration: Au. Their most popular album though seems to be 2010’s Astrolabe in Your Heart, so I’d start with one of these two, although tracks like “Shade in the Dusk” from Akashic are standouts in their collection as well. Abberation: Ag is just Abberation: Au recorded in English, and can be, honestly, skipped.\n\nBlacklab\n\nIf you like doomy, blues, Black Sabbath style riffing in your metal, BlackLab is a band you have to check out. BlackLab have a slow, grinding, atmospheric approach to a classic metal/rock sound, and somehow with only two members end up creating some of the heaviest and fullest sounds of any band on this list – hell, of any band out there today. The group specializes in creating soundscapes that manage to be aggressive, stripped down, and meditative all at once. Their longer songs, like the one below, are especially something that needs to be experienced with the right mood and atmosphere. The band isn’t something that grabs with a 15 second clips though, so I wouldn’t listen unless you’ve got time for a full album’s experience. Both of their major full-length releases to date have a grimy, sinking quality where you find yourself getting further mired in the album’s themes, concepts, and sound as you listen, with the group producing some great tracks that are made even better by listening to them as part of a conceptual whole.\n\nBlackLab are currently working on a third album, and I have to say I’m personally quite excited. The group’s hazy, minimalist approach to metal is something that I don’t seen much in contemporary music right now – in Japan or elsewhere – so I can’t wait to see what they do next. I will say that there’s a bit of grainy sound that covers their records, and this can take a second to get used to, but I’ve really come around to it as part of the style. If you like metal that has some of that old Sabbath influence to it but modern stylings and vocal approaches, and with a good splash of doom metal feel worked in, you shouldn’t pass up BlackLab.\n\nBloody Cumshot/Zemeth\n\nOkay, so, yeah, the name. It’s bad. But let’s look past that for now, because both of these bands – solo projects of a musician named Junya – do an amazing job at a frantic, modern take on melodeath incorporating neoclassical elements and influences. Yes, Bloody Cumshot is a terrible name for a band, and song titles like “Vomiting the Brain” or “Hate Fuck” make the band sound like they are going to be a garbage-tier grindcore act that you might hear at the worst dive bar you’ve ever been to. But in reality, Bloody Cumshot’s first album is an incredibly forward-thinking and relentless take on melodeath that makes the genre feel fresh… and that’s something I don’t think I’ve been able to say about it for decades. If you like metal that gives you some room to breath, Bloody Cumshot isn’t going to be for you, but if you’re looking for something with drive, energy, and an insane amount of production quality and originality (especially for a one-man project), you have to check them out.\n\nZemeth is then basically… the same thing? Like I honestly am not sure why Junya felt the need to separate his projects under two different names. The only key distinction I can hear is that Zemeth involves a bit more keyboard work then Bloody Cumshot, and doesn’t um… use the same song naming conventions. It’s certainly easier to recommend someone check out a song called “Black and White Wolves” than “Shoot Your Ugliness”, but both bands are certainly built around similar takes on Junya’s pulsing, relentless neo-classical style of melodeth.\n\nSo long story short, if you can get past the name, Bloody Cumshot and Zemeth are both really exciting projects that are made even more impressive when you realize one person’s behind the whole thing. If you like one, you’ll definitely like the other, and I highly recommend any of the records if you’re looking for something to give you enough energy to get through the day or blast out a workout at the gym.\n\nBroken By the Scream\n\nSo, I’ve gotta talk about kawaii metal at least once on this list. One of the really cool aspects of the Japanese metal scene is that they aren’t scared of mixing genres that, do not fit – at least in the traditional “zombies and devils and darkness” metal sense – together on paper. One of these mixes is metal and J-Pop. Obviously, Baby Metal is the big name in this mixture, but I’m not going to talk about them because my goal here is to cover bands people don’t know. But Baby Metal is only the tip of the iceberg. Japan has goth-metal/pop, industrial-metal/pop, and extreme-metal/pop hybrids abound, and they are all doing things that are quite unique… even if I honestly don’t enjoy listening to most of them that much.\n\nThat said, for some reason I really like Broken by the Scream. I’ll be blunt, the first time I heard them, via the video below, I was not enthralled. I even messaged some of my metal friends the song as a joke in the “lol what is this” sense. But then I found myself coming back to the track over and over. And then I found myself listening to their full albums. And then all of a sudden they made it into my top 5 Spotify listens for 2021. So, yeah, I guess I have to admit it: I’m a gigantic fan of this band.\n\nCompared to the other J-pop/metal hybrids out there, BBTS definitely leans more heavily on the brutal death metal sound. There are entire tracks, like Do・Do・N・Pa!!, that barely have any clean vocals at all, and the backing music goes way harder than you’ll find on bands like Baby Metal. Obviously, if you don’t like anything about electro-influenced J-pop, suddenly throwing it into your brutal death metal isn’t going do to much for you. But if you’ve been a fan of bands like iwrestledabearonce, or are even slightly intrigued by the way they worked 80s style synthcore into metal, BBTS might grab you.\n\nAlso, one of their singers made a death metal song for a cup-noodle company, so that’s a fun little side note in the history of metal media around the world.\n\nCoffins\n\nCoffins are signed to Relapse Records, so I might not be introducing anything new to anyone here, but they are a long-running death/doom band in the Japanese scene. The group’s been publishing music since 2000, and have five full length records out, although only the vocalist has been with the band that entire length (the lineup has been stable since 2015). That the vocalist, unlike some of the bands in this list, is the constant presence does give them a bit of cohesion throughout the releases though. That said, there is a huge difference between their earlier and later work. The group consistently has a slow, trudging, and heavy as hell death/doom style, but the earlier albums are a bit more stripped down and fuzzy than what has come recently. There are even some stoner-rock style riffs on albums like Mortuary in Darkness that you don’t hear on their newer stuff.\n\nSince their 2013 album The Fleshland though, the band has adopted a bit more of a modern sound that feels a bit cleaner but certainly not less heavy or punishing. The track “The Colossal Hole” for example is, appropriately, probably one of the heaviest songs of any band on this list. The newest release, 2019’s Beyond the Circular Demise, is even slower, with the band creating a crushingly overwhelming atmosphere that moves, well, slowly, but does this amazing job of just enveloping you as the album trudges brutally along. The band also knows when they need to bring in some bursts of energy into their soundscapes though, and in mixing these senses together have certainly carved out their own special niche of death/doom that deserves to be heard.\n\nDefiled\n\nDefiled are another band that’s part of the “old guard” of Japanese death metal. They have been around since the early 90’s, releasing their first album in 1999, with the band centered around the guitarist and lyricist Yusuke Sumita. Defiled have stayed true to their core sound throughout, and even today have a frantic approach to a old-school death metal sound. The band have stuck to their guns for decades now, increasing the quality of their production but continuing to maintain their chaotic and riff-based approach to classic death metal.\n\nWhether you like Defiled then really hinges on how much you like the trends of the 80s and early 90s death metal scene, and how much you can deal with a band subverting some of these expectations while mastering others. The band has a sound that I’ve seen compared to bands like Cryptopsy, Origin, and Suffocation, and their approach can often be a bit out there, with all instruments firing off in multiple directions in a way that I personally find exciting but can be jarring on first listen. There’s a lot of experimentation and creativity here that is used within the traditional death metal sound, which is exciting and fresh but does mean the band isn’t exactly “background music”. This is a group that requires active listening for sure.\n\nFinally, one interesting note about Defiled is that their lineup has been somewhat fluid, so some releases do have interesting sonic differences. The 2011 album In Crisis, for instance, has some really cool slap bass worked into it since they recorded with Gotsu Totsu Kotsu’s Haruhisa Takahata, and their 2020 release Infinite Regress has a bit more breathing room than prior albums due to a few longer tracks. All in all, Defiled are an important band in the scene deserve a lot of admiration for forging their own riff-filled path from an early date, and they’ve got a lot of albums to date to check out that are full of really creative approaches to a classic style. If you like what they’ve done, you should get hyped: a new album looks to be coming soon.\n\nDesecravity\n\nDesecravity are not for the faint of heart. Do you like technical death metal bands like Beyond Creation, Archspire, and Inferi, but you wish they had a bit more in common with bands like Origin? Well then you’re going to love what Desecravity do. The band basically takes technical death metal and brutal death metal and slaps them together into an abomination that, well, is just great as long as you don’t want to relax.\n\nThis is going to be a short entry, but don’t take that as a non-recommendation. I just don’t have a lot to say because the band’s style makes itself clear immediately. Desecravity have three albums, and they are all really impressive, technical, and punishing. If you like the video above, you really need to sit down and check out their discography. If you don’t like the video, then you probably won’t like what Desecravity do. It’s certainly some of the most confronting music on this list sonically, but goddamn is this band bringing an insane level of musical talent to the table, and so even if technical and brutal death metal styles aren’t your thing I’d certainly recommend powering through and checking them out.\n\nDesolate Sphere\n\nDesolate Sphere are just starting out, but they do a great job of producing hard-hitting metal in the style of bands like The Black Dahlia Murder. To be honest, if you like BDM, I can’t see any reason why Desolate Sphere wouldn’t be up your alley. In the track below, for instance, you can clearly see they’ve got the aggressive metalcore/melodeath combination down pat, including the dual “high/low” vocal contrast.\n\nAs it stands, the band hasn’t released that much music, so it’s difficult to say exactly what their specific “style” or approach that sets them apart from the pack will be. They’ve got the fundamentals down, but there’s definitely room to innovate and really make their mark and design their own sound. Certainly a space to watch, and a good listen while they develop.\n\nEthereal Sin\n\nIt’s quite odd: I have a lot of trouble finding Japanese black metal bands that are still kicking around. I’m sure there are a bunch, but for some reason (maybe just black metal’s love of being kvlt and undergrvnd) I haven’t found a bunch yet, other than Sigh, who… well I don’t think people need me to introduce Sigh. Anyway, if you know some I should check out, let me know (no NSBM, thanks!).\n\nOut of what Japanese black metal I do know though, one of the big players in the scene is without a doubt is Ethereal Sin. Their singer, Yama, is a large presence in Japanese metal on his own too, as he runs a local record label and plays in other bands like Rakshasa. Ethereal Sin calls themselves “Elegiac Black Metal”, and their style is a really, really classic black metal shell with bits of folk, melodic, and symphonic metal mixed in. On some records, especially the 2013 album Millendium (not a typo), they also mix in operatic female vocals in a manner reminiscent of Cradle of Filth. Indeed, I don’t think it would be a stretch to say the CoF is a large influence on the bands sound, especially Ethereal Sin’s earliest album (2009’s …the Abyss Will Also Gaze into Thee), although they’ve never been just a carbon copy of CoF and made grade strides in developing their own sound over the years.\n\nIf you listen to any individual Ethereal Sin songs, the band’s style might seem straightforward. Even on their earliest releases though, listening to a full album really shows the range of experimentation the band is able to subtly weave in. This is especially true on their newer albums, as with the passage of time the band seems more and more willing to explore new soundscapes (albeit while still clinging strongly to a classic black metal core). Personally, not to throw off my trve kvlt credentials or anything, I think their newest album is the most dynamic, but each of their records has some really cool takes on black metal that make them worth checking out.\n\nFate Gear\n\nFate Gear is basically the brain child of one person: Mina, or better known as Mina-taicho (Captain Mina). Mina was one of the members of Destrose, an important band in the Girl’s Metal (ガールズメタル) movement. Destrose fell apart after going through a bunch of members and releasing one full length album, and while some members joined/formed Mary’s Blood (below) and Aldious (above) Mina went off on her own path to create Fate Gear, a steampunk-themed metal band that continues the Girl’s Metal style but with a more varied sound than found in most groups in the scene.\n\nBeyond just the particular visual stylings, Fate Gear has a lot more variety and diversity of sound than you see in many of their contemporaries. Part of this is due to Mina’s range as a composer. She clearly listens to a large range of music, and is willing to draw on a huge number of metal styles across a single album. Between two distinct albums? You’ll get even further jumps. For instance, the single above is a fun, rocky song with some nice violin accompaniment. In contrast, the track Battle Against Justice from the same album (below) starts with black metal influenced riffing and even works in some industrial metal themes and noise. Furthermore, Mina clearly keeps challenging herself as a composer, which is always a great thing to see even if it creates some massive jumps in style across songs and albums.\n\nHowever, another reason for the diversity of sound that some listeners may struggle with is that the band doesn’t really have a consistent singer – some albums even use multiple singers across different tracks. There are even songs, like Skykiller, which were re-recorded across albums with different lineups. Fortunately for Skykiller, both takes end up really good in their own way. But as a result, if you really dig the sound of one album, or even a few songs of one album, another album/song might not be your style. Fate Gear is undoubtedly a really high-concept band with albums full of interesting takes and approaches, but while I find myself coming back to all their albums, there are tracks I skip on each one, which is always the risk with such a diverse style. Without a doubt though, I’d rather see a band trying new things and mixing styles like this than just doing the same thing over and over, and I don’t think it’s possible to check out Fate Gear without coming away incredibly impressed by the range of musicianship and style that Mina has tackled successfully throughout the band’s career.\n\nFlagitious Idiosyncrasy in the Dilapidation\n\nBesides having the best name on this list, Flagitious is just a great grindcore band. Unfortunately, they only have one album currently (called Wallow), but you can see the absolute intensity of the band pretty well in their live recordings.\n\nUnfortunately, while Flagitious seem to have an active Facebook page, I can’t find any information on if they are going to release a new album anytime soon. It’s coming up on a decade since Wallow, so it would be great to see where they have grown as a band, but until now if you dig their style you’ll have to make do with Wallow. Fortunately, it’s great. Furthermore, the singer has released an album with a side project called Monnier that can also scratch the itch for their style of grindcore. Between the two bands, Flatigious probably has the more interesting instrumentation, especially in terms of what they do with the bass guitar. But as I talk about below, Monnier’s 2021 release was one of my favorites of that year, so I guess I’m a big fan of everything Makiko Suda has put out.\n\n兀突骨 (Gotsu Totsu Kotsu)\n\n兀突骨 is a long-running Japanese band that combines trash and death metal with guttural vocals and, most interestingly, some really aggressive slap bass. The band is centered around a “samurai metal” theme, with the lyrics generally discussing the horrors of life and warfare in medieval Japan. The group has released five albums to date, with the only consistent member being the founder, vocalist, and bassist Takahata Haruhisa. That said, their line-up has been stable since their third album, 2015’s 因果応報 (ingaōhō, called “Retributive Justice” in English).\n\nThis band is one I have a large soft spot for, as they were the first band that got me into Japanese metal and the first band I used for research. Their first two albums are pretty classic, plodding, thrash-inspired death metal in the vein of early Death or Suffocation, but once their current line-up got together they really started to produce a unique and exciting sound. This isn’t to say that the early albums are bad! They have a lot of charm and some great riffs. But there is a definitely a major difference between how the band approaches music after 2015, and their song writing has gotten more challenging and unique over the years. Gotsu-Totsu-Kotsu’s current lineup feels like a tight, collaborative unit in a way that is missing a bit on the early albums, and they clearly are growing with each other as musicians as over the years as they continue to move as a stable band.\n\nOut of Gotsu-Totsu-Kotsu’s albums to date, 因果応報 is probably my favorite overall, which is unfortunate since its not on Spotify anymore now. Tracks like Urbs Diaboli and Loftiness of a Master Fencer from the two albums after 因果応報 are stellar though, and to be honest I think none of my favorite songs are on 因果応報 despite that I like the overall sound the most. If you want to check out their older stuff, the song 203 is probably my recommendation for a sample of their more classic style that shows how the band had a unique approach to death metal even before they solidified their current sound.\n\nHellhound\n\nLook, Hellhound are a straight-forward band. They play a style of classic heavy/speed metal with high-pitched vocals that wouldn’t sound out of place in the 1980s, and do so with a smile on their face and not even the slightest sense of shame. Track names like Speed Metal Hell, Heavy Metal Magic, Heavy Metal Dies, and The Oath of Allegiance to the Kings of Heavy Metal should make it clear: Hellhound loves metal, and they are going to play metal music that is about metal, and they’re going to have a blast doing it.\n\nSo, is their music good? Well, yes. The rhythm section is stellar, the guitars are always energetic and fun, and the vocals are wonderfully over the top. Is their music cheesy? Also, yes. Hellhound clearly is playing their music with at least a good chunk of irony and self-awareness. But most importantly, is their music fun? Absolutely. I cannot listen to Hellhound without a gigantic grin across on my face. So if you’re just in the mood to listen to people who love metal making metal about metal and have a good time while doing it, I cannot think of a better group.\n\nJurassic Jade\n\nJurassic Jade are a band that are way too underground for how great they are, and for how long they’ve been just kicking absolute ass at what they do. The group is an old-school Japanese trash band with some elements of classic death metal mixed in. So if you like early Slayer, Megadeth, Metallica, etc., or especially if you like them but think they could have been a bit grungier, Jurassic Jade is a band you have to check out.\n\nImportantly, Jurassic Jade was also one of the earliest Japanese groups to have a female vocalist. As you can see from this list, Japanese metal now has a rather diverse scene in terms of gender, but when Jurassic Jade came out were one of the few bands in the extreme side of the scene that broke this barrier down. Indeed, the mere idea that a band from this era could even have a female singer has lead to some hilariously uninformed reviews of Jurassic Jade’s music online.\n\nThe band’s output is, unfortunately, a bit hard to access now. Spotify has a decent collection of songs, but only three actually albums. Everything else is compilation records. This isn’t the end of the world, of course, but it does mean that its tricky to get the “album feel” that the tracks the compilations contain presumably had. Personally I find “The Howling Bull Years 2000-2004” the most compelling, but if you like the older thrash sound on that album I’d certainly give everything Jurassic Jade have put out a shot.\n\nKandarivas (神田川)\n\nKandarivas (from Kanda + Rivers) is a band from Kanda with probably one of the most interesting takes on grindcore out there. If you like grindcore at all, you are really doing yourself a disservice if you don’t check them out. With album titles like Blood Surgical Death and Grind Surgical Shrine, you’re probably not surprised to find that their 30 second to 2 minute long tracks (I told you they were grindcore) are centered around discussions of death, surgery, and bodily harm/gore. What makes Kandarivas stand out from the gorey grindcore pack though, is their lineup: a guitarist/screamer, and two drummers that often use traditional Japanese drums (e.g., taiko). This creates a truly special take on grindcore that has all the trademarks of the genre, but with flourishes of Japanese instrumentation that really make their music stand out from the pack.\n\nIn the end, of course, whether you like Kandarivas or not depends on if you listen to grindcore. If you do, you really have to check them out. The Japanese grindcore scene itself is pretty amazing, and Kandarivas is one of the many reasons why. Each of their albums is full of fast, energetic, and really unique grindcore tracks, but without feeling repetitive or gimmicky at all. There are even tracks which break down the grindcore mold, such as the song Kobudo which punctuates screams of KOBUDO with drum riffs that sound like they would fit in an early pop-punk before ending on a gang-vocal chant that sounds – dare I say it – catchy? Which is not something you usually find in a grindcore release.\n\nKokeshi\n\nThe only bad thing I have to say about Kokeshi is that they only have one album. This is one of the most exciting blackgaze projects I’ve heard, and the fact that they are able to combine so many interesting ideas into their FIRST record is absolutely incredible. Each song is filled with multiple riffs, breakdowns, and sudden shift changes that – while often unexpected – never feel jarring or out of place and are extremely clever and fresh. The singer’s incredible range of growls, screams, and whispers then elevate everything to an even higher level, and work with the music to make their first album feel like something truly special.\n\nI have no idea when Kokeshi is going to put out more music, but it can’t come soon enough. This is one of the coolest takes on black metal in years in my opinion, and songs like Takaishinsoukairo and Doukdei will be on my heavy rotation for years to come.\n\nKruelty\n\nCompared to all the other bands on this list, Kruelty are a bit on the more plodding, doomy side. The band play an intriguing combination of death, doom, and hardcore, that kind of sounds like a darker, angrier, more guttural, and much, much more down-tuned Hatebreed.\n\nThe band doesn’t have a lot of releases yet, so this is a short entry, but even in going through their first EPs compared to their first album you can hear them undergoing a lot of changes in their style that show promise for everything to come. Their earlier work had a much stronger doom influence, and they’ve gradually gotten a bit faster and more aggressive as they’ve gone along. Still, out of the all the bands on this list, they are probably the only one that incorporates slow, crushing breakdowns into their music, and they are definitely doing something that stands out from the pack. In my opinion, the direction they are going is definitely uphill, and I’m excited to see what they come out with on their sophomore release.\n\nMary’s Blood\n\nLike Aldious, Mary’s Blood is a key band in the power-metal inspired areas of the “Girls’ Metal” scene, and also contains musicians who played in Destrose. If you were to sit down and compare the two, Mary’s Blood is certainly on the heavier and more symphonic side. The band has less (although not no) ballads than Aldious, and tends to play at a faster higher tempo. On the other hand, their sound is also a bit less thrash inspired and more poppy in some ways. All in all, I’d say its quite possible to be a fan of one of the two bands while disliking the other even though they are often lumped into a similar category.\n\nPersonally, both Aldious and Mary’s Blood are a bit slow for my tastes, but I certainly do find moods where I want to listen to both. I think Mary’s Blood’s earlier albums, such as Countdown to Evolution, are a little more interesting than their more recent output though unfortunately. The earlier work has a bit more of an open and raw production, and you can really hear all the instruments doing their thing, while the newer stuff kind of limits access to the bass and drum sound on some tracks. That said, the new stuff isn’t bad at all, and they have certainly improved as musicians over the years. So if you like what Mary’s Blood do in the song above, or the Japanese take on a combined power/thrash/classic metal style that stereotypes early “Girls’ Metal”, all their albums should be up your alley (except maybe Re>Animator, an anime theme cover album, which is going to have its own audience).\n\nMonnier\n\nMonnier is a grindcore side project of the singer of Flagitious Idiosyncrasy in the Dilapidation. They currently only have one full album out, but it is absolutely incredible. I wouldn’t hesitate to call it my favorite grindcore album of 2021. Like all grindcore, we are dealing with really short songs here, so the video below can only give you a hint of the style. The experience of sitting down and listening to a full Monnier album, which will take you less than a half hour, is something else entirely.\n\nThere’s not a lot to say about Monnier yet, as they are just starting out and, to be honest, who knows if or when they’ll release a second album. But I really, really hope they do. This is an exciting band, and they show more way more promise than should be possible on a freshman release.\n\nNeuroticos\n\nNeuroticos play one of the most straight-forward classic takes on death metal on this list, and it absolutely rules. The band is international in a sense, including members with backgrounds in both Brazilian and Japanese (and Japanese/Brazilian) scenes, and actively promote themselves via English, Japanese, and Portuguese. So what do they sound like? Well, to put it simply they sound like they make classic death metal, and like they make classic death metal well.\n\nTo give a bit more detail, the band have a take on the death metal genre that wouldn’t have felt out of place decades ago, but doesn’t feel old or out of place now. They’ve got the old-school approach to bass and drums, the anti-religion lyrics (the 2019 album is called “Kill for God”), and the thrash-influenced style of death vocals that has lost favor in the scene a bit, but it all comes together in a nice modern package that shows the band innovating rather than just copying. The group clearly has a lot of love for classic sounds though, and its really cool to see how they don’t mind wearing their influences on their sleeve while also paving their own style. My understanding is they have a new album coming out soon, so hopefully we’ll have even more from them in the next year.\n\nOde to the End\n\nOde to the End are another band that’s just kind of starting out in terms of number of releases: they only have two EPs so far and no full albums. But they’ve got a really great take on the classic deathcore sound that has me pretty excited for their first full release.\n\nThere’s not a lot else to say at this point, because the band is still kind of new to the scene. But if you like deathcore, you should definitely give them a listen. They do a good job working in moments to breathe throughout otherwise pounding songs, so while they are definitely still developing their sound, they aren’t simply treading paths that have already been walked.\n\nOn-Myoza\n\nOkay, before you yell at me, yes, On-Myoza isn’t exactly “extreme metal”. Nor are they some underground act that really needs introduction. The band is a huge influence on metal in Japan, and has been around 1999. But maybe some people reading this don’t know about them, so I still feel its important to give them a mention.\n\nStarting off as a kind of folk-heavy metal act with clear influences from older forms of Japanese singing and rock, On-Myoza has been (somewhat incorrectly imo) described as part of or adjacent to the visual-kei scene. And certainly, there are not ZERO overlaps between their style and the work of some visual-kei. But On-Myoza has kept evolving over time in a more extreme-metal influenced direction, and never really rested on a single style or genre. While their earliest works had entirely clean vocals, using a great interplay of two vocalists, their most recent album (2018) shows them incorporating death growls pretty prominently. When this record is placed in their overall discography, you get an incredibly impressive and flexible band whose works straddle more genres across individual records than many groups play with across their entire careers.\n\nOf course, the negative side of this is that it’s very likely that only some albums will appeal to listeners. If you aren’t too adjusted to what metal sounds like when combined with local Japanese influences, the 2018 album is definitely the place to start as it has the most “modern” sound overall in the sense of what metal is doing in terms of broad global trends. But if you find yourself enjoying the way the band approaches music, their back catalogue is absolutely worth a listen, as this is one of those acts that has an incredible influence on the history and evolution of harder metal sounds in Japan and is a must-know if you want to fully grasp the scene.\n\nParasitario\n\nParasitario have been making music since 2018, but unfortunately it’s really hard to access what’s out there. The band has a sizable number of EPs and demos out, but Spotify currently only has one three-song EP so… bummer if you like what they do. The band has a crunchy, aggressive take on an old-school death metal sound with some thrash influence. Think early Death or maybe even Cannibal Corpse, but with a bit of the kind of melody you saw on later Death (or maybe even early-mid career Carcass) records.\n\nSo yeah, this is another short entry unfortunately, as the band doesn’t have a lot out there you can get easily from outside of Japan. Like, the track above is my favorite of theirs I’ve heard, but it’s not even available on the one album you can listen to on Spotify, so, yeah… bummer. But what they’ve done so far is quite cool and promising, and I imagine they’ll have a full album out soon. When it drops, I’m really excited to see what they go with as their first “official” declaration of their sound.\n\nRakshasa\n\nRakshasa, named after a type of demon, play what they call “Japanesque Metal”. What does this mean? Well, they basically have an interesting take on symphonic/gothic/power metal. Their style combines clean vocals with fresh and experimental song structures, all the while working in some Japanese instrumentation here and there. The biggest “Japanesque” part of the band is probably in how the vocals are performed, as Yuri, their singer, shows strong influence from older Japanese metal acts like On-Myoza. Their lyrics also detail the history and mythology of Japan, covering everything from samurai warfare to the nation’s creation myths in a way that is often poetic, arresting, and just really beautifully crafted. The single below is a good example of their slower songs, but I would recommend given other tracks a listen even if it doesn’t grasp your ear, as Rakshasa’s music covers a wide variety of tempos and influences (including the bassist’s background in black metal).\n\nThe band currently has two albums out but, frustratingly, they are listed as separate artists on Spotify. See the picture below? That’s the same band, featuring covers of each album. Between the two, the one on the right (the first) is my personal recommendation. It’s a bit faster tempo, and has some of my favorite Rakshasa tracks like Shingun no Koku (進軍の刻) and Yomotsuhirasaka (黄泉比良坂) – the song I apparently listened to more than any other in 2021. The second album is fine, but they leaned a bit harder on the ballads, and that’s not my favorite thing that they do.\n\nRakshasa is a band that I definitely recommend giving a few listens, as they really grow on you. Their music has a lot going on, and the diversity of styles is praiseworthy. I hope they go a bit heavier on their third release, but either way, they are no doubt carving out a unique sound within the Japanese scene.\n\nSaisega/Zettai Club (絶対倶楽部)\n\nSo this is kind of a two-parter. Despite the massive difference in these bands’ distinct styles I’m linking them here because they have the same singer, and she unites the two in significant ways. Saisega is the closest thing on this list to a nu-metal band, although I worry that description does the band a disservice. Without question, Saisega is a rock-metal hybrid that doesn’t hesitate to incorporate hip-hop sections. But the band have a kind of quirky, Mr. Bungle energy thrown in there, and are willing to try a lot more ideas in a single song than most nu metal bands tried out across entire albums or even careers (I particularly recommend the track empty666 as an example of the band’s madcap energy). They’ve only released a few songs so far – one EP and a single – but I give them major props for writing manic, energetic rock/metal that allows every single band member’s instrument to shine. Their singer (who currently goes by Regan) also has a pretty incredible range of shouts, growls, clean vocals, and occasionally even rap that does a lot to keep the songs fresh and exciting. If you’re a hardcore death metal fan reading this list, Saisega probably won’t do much for you. And they certainly are still figuring out elements of their style, as some quirky combinations fall a bit flat (at least for me). But if you’re a fan of energetic rock with a bit of edge and creativity, what they’ve put out so far should scratch a few itches.\n\nSaiseiga isn’t this singer’s first band though, as for a while they were the lead vocalist for the more symphonic band Zettai Club. This group shares similarities with a few bands on this list, as Encyclopaedia Metallica lazily describes them as “power metal“, and for whatever reason their albums are divided by two distinct entries on Spotify. They’ve broken up, so I guess no one cares enough to fix it, but it’s odd that this keeps happening.\n\nAnyway, Zettai Club played a tight, busy version of the kind of epic/symphonic metal we’ve seen a number of Japanese bands interested in right now. Just like with Saisega though, the singer’s vocal range does a lot to make the group stand out from the pack. Zettai Club aren’t afraid of incorporating screamed/growled vocals, and overall they have a bit more of a pop sound than some of the other bands I’ve described as symphonic here, while also just being far more willing to experiment and jam a lot of sounds together in a way that – when it works – is quite incredible. For instance, the track Aoi Honno from Mugendai Thriller sounds like it could easily be three distinct songs, yet some how it all comes together quite nicely as one artistic statement.\n\nAs mentioned though, Zettai Club is no more, but I want to give them a shoutout for standing as an interesting – if at times stumbling – note in the history of Japanese metal. It seems like all the members are also still active in the Japanese scene too (the drummer went to Saisega), which is great as there’s a lot of talented musicianship and clever ideas in these releases that I hope we’ll see continue to grow and contribute to the scene.\n\nSchönberg\n\nIn some ways, Schönberg is a band I really shouldn’t enjoy. The band’s take on metal is sort of a classical/baroque style mixed with thrashy elements, and they aren’t afraid to go slow and add a lot of melody to their music. When you combine this with clean vocals that move between breathy, poppy, and operatic styles, and then cover the entire product with a sense of pomp, you get something that isn’t what I usually look for in metal. But… I really like Schönberg. For whatever reason, the way the band incorporates these elements that I don’t usually find enjoyable works really well, and the overall sense of “epicness” that comes out from their albums can’t be denied. Sometimes it does go over the top, but it all comes together much better you might expect on first glance.\n\nUnfortunately, like a lot of the bands on this list, Schönberg’s first release (Splendid Rosa Birth) suffers from poor production that makes everything sound flat and unmixed. This is a doubly depressing as the first album is otherwise rather mature for a freshman album. There are some good ideas on this album that the band doesn’t really go back to on other releases, and personally I would have liked to hear fleshed out or further explored (or at least at a higher audio quality). The newest album, Baroque Gravity, is a really strong performance though, and Another Veiled Story, the prior work, is also quite good. I do admit that I have to be in a particular mood for Schönberg, but they scratch an itch for a particular sound that I didn’t know I had until I gave them a listen.\n\nSomnium de Lycoris\n\nFor some reason, there’s not a lot of progressive tech-death out there in the Japanese scene (that I can find, at least), but thankfully SDL here is rising to fill that gap. The band plays a style of music that any fan of bands like Cynic or Beyond Creation can easily appreciate, and their most recent single shows off how they approach the genre with aplomb.\n\nCurrently the group only has an EP and a single under their belt, so hopefully there will be a bit more coming soon. Fortunately, their first EP is not as rough as some of the other first EPs I’ve mentioned in this article, and you can hear a lot of exciting and unique ideas in the composition (done by the keyboardist) right away. Their earliest release isn’t as conceptually refined as the single above, but its still really good. I especially appreciate how the band is willing to incorporate jazzy bass and piano lines, and take their tracks in unexpected ways to explore soundscapes you might not expect the song could reach based on its initial riffs. Combined, these two releases show a band that is going in a really exciting direction. SDL’s sound is especially cool given that it seems rather rare in the Japanese scene, so while they are doing something that definitely has referents and influences we can name, they are nevertheless forging out their own space in the prog/tech realm.\n\nUnited\n\nLike Defiled and Jurassic Jade, United are a long-running old school Japanese act that have been making music since the 1980s. The band has released 11 albums, and even broke up once, so there’s a lot to check out if you dig what they do. And what do they do? Well, thrash. The band is Japan’s answer to groups like Megadeth and Anthrax, although they’ve got a bit more of a groove-based sound in their more recent work.\n\nRecommending a specific album is tricky though. I’d say that 2018’s Absurdity is probably going to have the broadest appeal, as it has the most modern sound overall (think bands like Harlott). If you like a dirtier, older thrash sound though, 2001’s Infectious Hazard might be more up your alley. The band’s 1990 album Bloody but Unbowed and 1992 album Human Zoo are also interesting in their own rights, however. The singer is different than the current one, and the band is still thrash but… they aren’t doing anything I’ve heard thrash bands do in that era. Bloody but Unbowed, for instance, has a bunch of 6-7 minute songs, and incorporates some nifty slap bass and (on tracks like WELCOME TO AMAZING WORLD) brief interludes that wouldn’t feel out of place on a folk metal record. It’s certainly a cool note in the history of thrash, but might be less straightforward and accessible than their more recent output for many listeners.\n\nUnlucky Morpheus\n\nUnlucky Morpheus does a great job incorporating Japanese-rock/metal inspired singing styles with a symphonic/death mix. Encyclopaedia Metallum lists them as a “power metal” band, and that influence is definitely there, but I have to say I again disagree with the categorization almost entirely. I’m not sure how I would describe them, but perhaps it would make sense to say they are like Dimmu Borgir might sound if they had some visual kei influence in their style, worked in Japanese rhythms, employed a female vocalist with a staggering range of styles, and emphasized their strings more. Which, of course, ends up implying a sound that probably doesn’t make any sense, so it’s best I just show you what they sound like directly:\n\nTo be honest, the first time I heard Unlucky Morpheus (who also go by Ankimo) was via the track below, and… I didn’t like it much. And now that I’ve become a fan and showed them to other friends, I’ve definitely had people that I thought would dig it tell me it wasn’t for them. So for people who haven’t listened to much Japanese music this might be a tricky recommend, although I don’t exactly know why. Personally, I can’t say I had a single moment where a switch “flipped”. Basically after listening to Japanese metal for a few years I happened to come back to Unlucky Morpheus and just found that I now really liked it. I’ve written elsewhere in this review that there’s a strand of influence in Japanese metal that draws on older styles of rhythm and singing that existed in Japan before metal arrived, and I really think adjusting to that is the key. Once you start to vibe with this sound, whatever it is or however you define it (I am NOT a musician), the epic, flowery take on metal that Unlucky Morpheus has is something I’d highly recommend.\n\nOut of the albums they have so far, Unfinished and Change of Generation (the most recent two) are my personal favorites. The pair of tracks CADAVER and REVADAC are especially cool in my opinion. REVADAC has this part in the chorus where the singer inverts words, which creates a poetic rhythm that I hadn’t really seen before and I think sounds just fantastic. For instance, check out the sound play in these lines from the song (including my terrible translation):\n\n其の感傷を 召還せよ (sono kanshou o shoukan se yo)\n\nSummon that wound\n\n此の暴走を 想望せよ (kono bousou o soubou se yo)\n\nYearn for this rampage\n\n其の後悔と 邂逅せよ (sono koukai to kaikou se yo)\n\nMeet with that regret by chance\n\n彼の星彩よ 再生せよ (kano seisai yo saisei se yo)\n\nRevive that vitality\n\nWhile the lyrics themselves in terms of meaning aren’t, like, the most interesting thing I’ve ever heard, the way that the singer plays with sound and repetition and rhyme on this track never fails to perk my ears. If you really like the singer, you might want to check out her other projects Light Bringer and DOLL$BOXX, although the bands’ sounds are quite distinct so enjoyment of one may not lead to enjoyment of another. Unlucky Morpheus is the only one I find myself listening to regularly, but shoutout to DOLL$BOXX’s bass player.\n\nVomit Remnants\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia Metallium, Vomit Remnants have been around since 1997. They have only one original member remaining (the drummer), and have released a huge number of demos and EPs. Unfortunately, the only albums that are really easy to get your hands on are a compellation album called Collecting the Remnants, which contains tracks released by the band before their breakup in 2001, and their 2017 release Hyper Groove Brutality. That said, it looks like they have new music coming out soon, as they released a new song+video in 2020.\n\nBasically, the only question to ask yourself before listening to Vomit Remnants is “do I like groovy brutal death metal?” If you do, then you’ll like them. If you don’t well, then, you won’t. I personally do, so I’m quite a fan of the 2017 release. The compellation album mentioned earlier is fine, but, not to mention this issue again, suffers from mediocre production values, so I can only recommend it if you really like older styles with all their low-tech vibes and sounds.\n\nWirbelwind\n\nWirbelwind describes themselves as combination of speed metal and melodic death metal. This is certainly apt in terms of the band’s general instrument style, but the vocals have a bit of a hardcore punch to them. You wouldn’t ever mix up Wirbelwind and, say, Arch Enemy. They also have a bit of theming that might be considered “folk” or “viking metal”, as in the songs Ragnarok I through IV on their album Nobel Catastrophe. That said, they don’t sound like Amon Amarth either, so it’s tricky to give a direct referent to what they sound like that also also correctly nails down the band’s themes (or vice versa).\n\nWhile the band has only released two EPs and one full album, their style is evolving between them, which is really nice to see. The latest EP, Time to Realize, stresses the melodeath elements a bit more than in the past, and lets the songs breathe a bit more than on the first album. Overall, I think these changes are both a plus. However, they’ve also reduced some of the “viking folk” elements that made their first album an interesting release in terms of what’s going around in the Japanese metal scene right now. So I guess wouldn’t particularly recommend one release over another, and I think listeners will be split between them. If one album doesn’t catch your attention, you therefore might just want to try the other.\n\nUltimately, Wirbelwind are clearly still figuring out exactly what they want to do, but they’ve released some really solid melodeath on their way to do it. If you like bands like Amon Amarth, Arch Enemy, or even Chthonic you will probably find a lot to like about what Wirbelwind are doing, and looking forward to what happens when they codify what they want to do with their particular style.\n\n妖精帝國 (Yousei Teikoku)\n\nI’m not quite sure how to classify Yousei Teikoku. Wikipedia says “their music mixes elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, electronic and classical music”, which is I guess true but doesn’t really describe anything specific to me. Their albums all also have quite distinct feels to them, which makes categorization even harder. Gothic Lolita Propaganda (2007), for instance, is clearly within the same range of artistic ideas that produced the 2020 album Age of Villains, but it’s not unlikely that a fan of one record might find the other nearly unlistenable. Personally, I lean more towards their recent output like the song below, but there are absolutely songs on each album that I enjoy and would recommend.\n\nAs a whole, I’d describe the band as having a Japanesque take (i.e., influenced by “traditional” Japanese sounds, including bands like On-Myoza) on an aggressive and slightly jumpy symphonic metal style that doesn’t hesitate to include poppy elements. They also have a lot more “style”, if you will, than many other bands, putting a lot of time into their image. Really though, one of the things that makes the band stand out is their vocalist Yui Itsuki. Listening to a few Yousei Teikoku tracks, you probably won’t be surprised to find out that she works as a voice actor, as the range of sounds and styles she’s able to produce is incredible. Yousei Teikoku tracks include everything from deep death-metal growls to high pitched anime-intro style bubblegum pops, which some how is perfectly integrated into the band’s epic and affected (in a positive sense!) symphonic style.\n\n…and that’s it for now. This is a living list, so I’ll keep updating it as time goes on, but I hope what I have here at the moment gives you some good directions to explore. Happy listening!"
