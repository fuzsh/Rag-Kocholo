        "text": "Heavy metal is a loud, aggressive genre of rock music. That developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. The genre’s lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. The bands that play heavy-metal music usually have one or two guitars, a bass guitar, and drums. In some bands, electronic keyboards, organs, or other instruments are used. Heavy metal songs are loud and powerful-sounding and have strong rhythms that are repeated. There are many different types of heavy metal (thrash, black, death, hair, etc..)\n\nCommon features of heavy metal include slackened (downtuned) instruments and unusual key changes and time signatures (metre).\n\nHeavy metal bands sometimes dress in jeans, leather jackets, and leather boots, and have long hair. Heavy metal bands sometimes behave in a dramatic way when they play their instruments or sing. However, many heavy metal bands do not like to do this.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nHeavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals.\n\nThe typical band lineup: 1- drummer, 2- bassist, 3- rhythm guitarist, 4- lead guitarist, 5- singer (may or may not be an instrumentalist).\n\nKeyboard instruments: they are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound. by the 1990s, almost every subgenre of heavy metal synthesizers (Keyboard instruments) were used.\n\nThe electric guitar: the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal. The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion. For classic heavy metal guitar tones, guitarists maintain gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the characteristic “punch and grind”.\n\nPalm muting: With rhythm guitar parts, the heavy crunch sound in heavy metal is created by palm muting (which is placing the side of the picking hand below the little finger across the strings to be plucked, very close to the bridge, and then plucking the strings while the damping is in effect. This produces a muted sound). which creates a tighter, more precise sound and emphasizes the low end.\n\nThrash metal guitar: its tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with lots of bass frequencies.\n\nGuitar solos: they are an essential element of heavy metal. Most heavy metal songs feature at least one guitar solo, in which the heavy metal performer can express his virtuosity. Some exceptions are nu-metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos.\n\nThe voice: Heavy metal demands the subordination of the voice to the overall sound of the band. an explicit display of emotion is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity. Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer’s “tone of voice” is more important than the lyrics.\n\nThe bass: The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music heavy. The bass plays a more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock. Metal bass lines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars.\n\nSome bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica’s Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass guitar solos and the use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s.\n\nThe drums: create a loud, constant beat for the band using the trifecta of speed, power, and precision. Heavy metal drumming requires an exceptional amount of endurance, and drummers have to develop considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity to play the intricate patterns used in heavy metal.\n\nThe metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. Black metal, death metal, and some mainstream metal bands all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats.\n\nPowerful loud sound: In the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. The loudness is designed to sweep the listener into the sound and to provide a shot of youthful vitality.\n\nGender: Heavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male until the mid-1980s apart from exceptions such as Girlschool. However, by the 2010s women were making more of an impact, and PopMatters’ Craig Hayes argues that metal clearly empowers women. there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers; bands such as Nightwish, Delain, and Within Temptation have featured women as lead singers with men playing instruments.\n\nMusical language\n\nRhythm and tempo\n\nThe rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency. In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note, or three-note rhythmic figures — generally made up of 8th or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.\n\nBrief, abrupt, and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be “slow, even ponderous”. By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).\n\nHarmonic structures\n\nOne of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord. In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low-frequency sounds are created, which add to the “weight of the sound” and create an effect of “overwhelming power”. Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord, power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth, or minor sixth. Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.\n\nHeavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes. this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions. In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses “pentatonic and blues-derived features”.\n\nThe tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones — such as C to F# — was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it diabolus in musica — “the devil in music”.\n\nHeavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal points as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign ( dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts. According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are “often quite complex” and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is “often very sophisticated”. In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that “heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated” than other music researchers had realized.\n\nLyrical themes\n\nBlack Sabbath, and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired, have concentrated lyrically “on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent unprecedented in any form of pop music. As an example Sabbath’s second album Paranoid (1970), which included songs dealing with personal trauma ‘Paranoid’ and ‘Fairies Wear Boots’ (which described the unsavory side effects of drug-taking) as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory ‘War Pigs’ and ‘Hand of Doom’. Deriving from the genre’s roots in blues music, sex is another important topic — a thread running from Led Zeppelin’s suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references to glam metal and nu-metal bands.\n\nHeavy metal’s main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans, and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates a party without limits. Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics immature and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are clearly misguided as these critics have overlooked the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise.\n\nHeavy metal musicians and fans came under severe criticism in the 1980s. Political and academic groups sprang up to blame the genre and its fans for causing everything from crime and violence to despondency and suicide. But defenders of the music pointed out that there was no evidence that heavy metal’s exploration of madness and horror caused, rather than articulated, these social ills. The genre’s lyrics and imagery have long addressed a wide range of topics, and its music has always been more varied and virtuosic than critics like to admit. Heavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked to defend his song “Under the Blade” at a U.S. Senate hearing. At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate’s throat surgery. In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song “Suicide Solution”. A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne’s song. Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen’s death. In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in an American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement “do it” in the song Better by You, Better than Me, it was featured on the album Stained Class (1978), the song was also a Spooky Tooth cover. While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed. In 1991, UK police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an “unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity”.\n\nIn some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values. In countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated. In 1997, the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans and they were accused of “devil worship” and blasphemy after police found metal recordings during searches of their homes. In 2013, Malaysia banned Lamb of God from performing in their country, on the grounds that the “band’s lyrics could be interpreted as being religiously insensitive” and blasphemous. Some people considered heavy metal music to be a leading factor for mental health disorders and thought that heavy metal fans were more likely to suffer from a poor mental health, but study has proven that this is not true and the fans of this music have a lower or similar percentage of people suffering from poor mental health.\n\nImage and fashion\n\nFor many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band’s image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments, and music videos.\n\nDown-the-back long hair is the most distinguishing feature of metal fashion. Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair symbolized the hate, angst, and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home. Long hair gave members of the metal community the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general.\n\nThe classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light-colored, ripped frayed, or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots, and black leather or denim jackets. T-shirts are generally emblazoned with logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands. In the 1980s, a range of sources, from punk and goth music to horror films, influenced metal fashion. Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance.\n\nFashion and personal style were especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname, “hair metal”); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry. Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei — which includes many nonmetal groups — emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup.\n\nPhysical gestures\n\nThe image shows a band onstage with fans visible in the front of the picture. Some fans are raising their fists and others are raising their hands with the index finger and pinky extended.\n\nFans raise their fists and make the “devil horns” gesture at a Metsatöll concert.\n\nMany metal musicians when performing live engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair. The il cornuto, or devil horns, hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio with Black Sabbath and Dio. Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture on the 1977 Love Gun album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.\n\nAttendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense. It has been argued that this is due to the music’s largely male audience and “extreme heterosexualist ideology”. Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust which is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture. The performance of the air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home. According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage diving, which “were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture”. Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the “pit” near the stage. Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump “back into the audience”.\n\nThe Name Origin\n\nThe origin of the term “heavy metal” in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs. His 1962 novel The Soft Machine includes a character known as “Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid”. Burroughs’ next novel, Nova Express (1964), develops the theme, using heavy metal as a metaphor for addictive drugs: “With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms — Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes — And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music”. Inspired by Burroughs’ novels, the term was used in the title of the 1967 album Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music. The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe The Byrds for their supposed “aluminum style of context and effect”, particularly on their album The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968).\n\nMetal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in “hippie speak”: “heavy” is roughly synonymous with “potent” or “profound,” and “metal” designates a certain type of mood, grinding, and weighted as with metal. The word “heavy” in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to “heavy music” — typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare — were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to Vanilla Fudge. Iron Butterfly’s debut album, released in early 1968, was titled Heavy. The first use of “heavy metal” in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song “Born to Be Wild”, also released that year: “I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin’ with the wind/And the feelin’ that I’m under.”\n\nCoined by Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, “downer rock” was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to acts such as Sabbath and Bloodrock. Classic Rock magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of Quaaludes and the drinking of wine. Later the term would be replaced by “heavy metal”.\n\nEarlier on, as “heavy metal” emerged partially from heavy psychedelic rock, also known as acid rock, “acid rock” was often used interchangeably with “heavy metal” and “hard rock”. “Acid rock” generally describes heavy, hard, or raw psychedelic rock.\n\nApart from “acid rock”, the terms “heavy metal” and “hard rock” have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, when the terms were largely synonymous. For example, the 1983 Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll includes this passage: “Known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, Aerosmith was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies”.\n\nHistory\n\nHeavy Metal took a slightly longer bath before making its grand entrance onto the world stage. We begin our journey in the 1960s. The early half of the decade witnessed an unparalleled explosion of popular music. Vanguard acts, such as The Beatles (I Wanna Hold Your Hand), The Rolling Stones (Paint It Black), The Who (My Generation), and The Kinks (You Really Got Me), emerged as the “third generation” of rock and roll (behind the blues originators and the Elvis Presley/Little Richard generation). Each of these groups contributed to the creation of the “rock band” archetype: loud, unpredictable, rebellious, and even dangerous. By the latter half of the 1960s, the next generation of “rock stars” began to sow the first seeds of prototypical Heavy Metal. Drawing inspiration from their blues and rock and roll forebearers, “hard rock” acts, like Cream (Tales of Brave Ulysses), Led Zeppelin (Communication Breakdown), and The Jimi Hendrix Experience (Voodoo Child), provided the soundtrack for a generation increasing disaffected by social injustice and the escalating war in Vietnam. What differentiated these acts from their predecessors was technological advances that enabled new heights in sonic disruption (Blue Cheer — Summertime Blues). These acts were markedly louder not only in volume but in weaving brutally blunt social commentary into their lyrics.\n\nIn the very late 1960s and 1970s, rock and roll turned into a harder, louder form of music called rock. In the 1970s, rock music bands played huge, loud concerts in outdoor stadiums. In the early 1970s, many rock bands played psychedelic rock, a type of rock music with lyrics and sounds that were intended to give the listener some idea of what it felt like to be on so-called “mind-expanding” (and usually illegal) drugs, and which some believe even enhanced the experience of being on the drugs themselves. Many bands from Britain played blues music mixed with rock music, such as The Animals, The Kinks, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, and the Jeff Beck Group.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a harder form of rock music called “heavy metal” was invented. In 1968, three of the genre’s most famous pioneers, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple founded heavy metal. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. The first use of the term was in a 1968 song by Steppenwolf, “Born to be Wild”, and other early heavy metal bands appeared in the same year. Black Sabbath was the band that invented metal music in the late 1960s beginning with their first studio album Black Sabbath, following Paranoid which talked about the generation that was raised in an economically depressed industrial town during an era of lost innocence. The quartet forged a sound that recalled the clamor of the steel mills (Iron Man) that dominated the landscape of their hometown. In the process, they unleashed a sonic revolution. Black Sabbath succeeded in synthesizing early rock ‘n roll, hard-edged blues (Fairies Wear Boots), and the “Devil’s Interval” with a nightmare and a long line of patrons at a movie theater to see a horror film starring Boris Karloff (incidentally titled Black Sabbath). Black Sabbath forged an entirely new and unique musical path, marked by Tony Iommi’s brooding guitar riffs, Geezer Butler’s intelligent lyrics and thundering bass, Bill Ward’s pounding drums, and Ozzy Osbourne’s, well, Ozzy. Sonically, the music was starkly dark and ominous, standing in stark juxtaposition to the “flower power” pop music of contemporary acts. Lyrically, Sabbath openly addressed socially taboo subjects ranging from political corruption (War Pigs) to recreational drug use (Sweet Leaf) to social ostracization (Children of the Grave). Compared to the hard rock acts of the late 1960s, Sabbath’s compositions and performances were minimalistic in form and execution. Yet, what they lacked in complexity, Black Sabbath compensated for in terms of power and intensity. Nevertheless, Black Sabbath set the standard as the first proper heavy metal band.\n\nBlack Sabbath played loud, hard rock music based on blues music. Heavy metal music was mostly based on the sounds of the electric guitar. The electric guitar in heavy metal is always amplified through powerful amplifiers so that it has a loud, distorted, angry sound. Other bands such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Eric Burdon, and Alice Cooper played even louder, harder forms of heavy metal rock music.\n\nFollowing the blueprint laid down by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and outrageous stage shows of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and wild party rock of Van Halen. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre’s evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Def Leppard followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as “metalheads” or “headbangers”.\n\nIn the 1980s more sub-genres of Heavy Metal bands were created, one of which was “Hair/glam Metal” with Bands such as Mötley Crüe, W.A.S.P., Ratt and Bon Jovi became popular. Heavy Metal rock bands had long hair and the men wore makeup (lipstick and eyeshadow) and tight leather pants and boots. Many metal songs were about love, sex, partying, having a good time, illegal drug use, and drinking alcohol. Rarely, but sometimes, metal songs were also politically and socially critical. In the late 1980s, groups such as Poison and Warrant were very successful, smashing the field with songs like “Talk Dirty to Me,” and “Cherry Pie.”\n\nAnother type of heavy metal in the 1980s was called “thrash metal” or “thrash.” Thrash metal bands played a faster, more aggressive type of heavy metal rock. Thrash metal bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer broke into the mainstream and had many fans.\n\nIn the 1990s, a new form of heavy metal developed, called alternative metal. Alternative Metal combined thrash metal and grunge rock with hip-hop music and industrial music. Also in the 1990s was nu metal, a shortening of “new metal”. Nu metal mixed rap and hip hop style singing with metal music. Nu-metal bands also often include DJ decks, synthesizers, and other electronic instruments. Nu Metal was very successful and made a lot of money, especially bands such as Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, and Disturbed.\n\nTwo other styles of heavy metal music, “death metal” and “black metal” are very angry, fast music. A person who does not like heavy metal at all will have a much harder time listening to death metal or black metal because it is much faster, louder, and more aggressive than other types of music. The singers usually do not sing, but instead, they growl or roar to make the songs more intense. This makes it harder to hear the lyrics (words) and most people are not used to singers who use their voices in this way. The lyrics often tell stories from the view of people who are suffering and dying, or people who are hurting others. The guitars are usually distorted. The drums also use very fast beats with double bass pedals (AKA two kick pedals, double peds, etc.)\n\nOther important styles of metal are power metal, a style whose music often is about fiction and epics like The Lord of the Rings, and gothic metal, which has melancholy songs about abstract subjects like pain, life, death, faith, and religion.\n\nResources\n\nhttps://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_lyrics\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_fashion\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_subculture\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_rock\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rock\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_metal\n\nhttps://metal.mit.edu/brief-history-metal\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/art/heavy-metal-music\n\nhttps://vocal.media/beat/what-is-metal-music\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_(album)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_mute\n\nhttps://www.metalrulesmagazine.com/characteristics-of-heavy-metal.html\n\nhttps://www.liveabout.com/what-is-heavy-metal-p2-2456255\n\nhttp://mmusic-zone.blogspot.com/2013/02/characteristics-of-heavy-metal.html"
