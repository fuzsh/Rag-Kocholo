Superb stuff.\n\nReally liking Nightwish lately - the Wishmaster album.\n\nDoes Division count?\n\nProg metal:\n\nDream Theater - Especially Images And Words and Awake, but I love basically all of their stuff.\n\nSymphony X - Anything at all.\n\nPain Of Salvation - Nothing specific, but Gildenlow is crazy. In a good way.\n\nFates Warning - It's all good stuff. Jim Matheos is an awesome riff writer.\n\nFreak Kitchen - Don't know if I could classify them as anything, but I think some of their stuff counts as prog metal - especially the Move album.\n\nIf I can even come close to remembering them all...\n\nManticora - Hyperion\n\nNocturnal Rites - Shadowland\n\nInto Eternity - Buried In Oblivion\n\nIced Earth - Something Wicked This Way Comes\n\nPrimal Fear - Nuclear Fire\n\nSinergy - To Hell And Back\n\nBlind Guardian - Nightfall In Middle Earth\n\nDemons & Wizards - Self Titled\n\nTherion - Vovin\n\nLabyrinth - Return To Heaven Denied\n\nHammerFall - Legacy of Kings\n\nDream Evil - The Book Of Heavy Metal\n\nSymphorce - Godspeed\n\nBiomechanical - The Empires of the Worlds\n\nand I can't remember any more... my head hurts.\n\nOh dear god, long list....\n\nArwen - Illusions\n\nBlind Guardian - Nightfall In Middle Earth\n\nCommunic - Conspiracy In Mind\n\nCrystal Eyes - Confessions Of The Maker\n\nDemons & Wizards - Demons & Wizards\n\nDragonforce - Valley Of The Damned\n\nDream Theater - Images And Words\n\nEvergrey - Solitude-Dominance-Tragedy\n\nFates Warning - Parallels\n\nFirewind - Burning Earth\n\nIced Earth - Something Wicked This Way Comes\n\nIon Vein - Reigning Memories\n\nKamelot - The Fourth Legacy\n\nLost Horizon - A Flame To The Ground Beneath\n\nMystic Prophecy - Never Ending\n\nNevermore - The Politics Of Ecstacy\n\nNocturnal Rites - Grand Illusion\n\nOratory - Beyond Earth\n\nO.S.I. - O.S.I.\n\nPharaoh - After The Fire\n\nQueensryche - Operation Mindcrime\n\nSanctuary - Into The Mirror Black\n\nSavatage - Edge Of Thorns\n\nShadow Keep - A Chaos Theory\n\nSinergy - Suicide by My Side\n\nSonata Arctica - Winterheart's Guild\n\nStratovarius - Destiny\n\nSun Caged - Sun Caged\n\nSymphony X - V: The New Mythology Suite\n\nHmm, that's all I can think of at the moment, hard to pick one CD from some of these bands....\n\nJerich said:\n\nADAGIO...........................\n\nStephan Forte' interview for www.sevenstring.org comming in a few days...........\n\ncheck out the new cd \"Dominate\"\n\nalso guys check out SYMPHORCE stellar...7 string power metal...\n\nI'm desperate to hear the new album, as I love that band, but I still have to pay horrible import prices to get it here in the UK...grrrr!\n\nCan't wait for that interview though!\n\nAkrin said:\n\nDoes Division count?\n\nI don't know if we do, but thanks for listening!\n\nDream Theater - Images and Words, Awake\n\nRush - everything before Power Windows, and then a few after that.\n\nKing's X - everything before Ear Candy, and Please Come Home Mr. Bulbous\n\nKing Crimson - just about everything, they're constantly brilliant\n\nQueensryche - Operation Mindcrime, Empire\n\nInto Eternity - Buried In Oblivion (thanks, Mike)\n\nZero Hour - Towers of Avarice (double thanks, Mike)\n\nNevermore - whatever you're willing to count, I love it all\n\nMawdyson said:\n\nNothing came up, I'll try again.\n\nI dont see any samples online for them, they are easily the best power metal band IMO, best singer, best guitars, best keyboards, best songs.\n\nIts like if you take stratovarious, and gamma ray and mix them together you get some super band\n\nanother amazing power metal band not many people know about\n\nLost Horizon, star trek metal. LOL this band has the best singer ever\n\nhttp://www.oncelosthorizon.com/\n\nhere is a link to them\n\nSamer said:\n\nI dont see any samples online for them, they are easily the best power metal band IMO, best singer, best guitars, best keyboards, best songs.\n\nIts like if you take stratovarious, and gamma ray and mix them together you get some super band\n\nanother amazing power metal band not many people know about\n\nLost Horizon, star trek metal. LOL this band has the best singer ever\n\nhttp://www.oncelosthorizon.com/\n\nhere is a link to them\n\nErr... Used to have the best singer ever... Daniel left LH, joined Crystal Eyes long enough to do 1 album(which I listed above) and now he and the 2nd guitarist from LH have started a band called Heed. Heed sounds like Creed, Disturbed, and Stratovarius had a mutant love child. The only thing I like about Heed are the vocals. I wish he'd stayed with Lost Horizon or at the least Crystal Eyes.\n\nThey're more \"HIghlander\" metal than Star Trek though. Hell, the mention The Quickening and have a song called The One(Highlander). Definitely need to lose the face-paint and costumes."
