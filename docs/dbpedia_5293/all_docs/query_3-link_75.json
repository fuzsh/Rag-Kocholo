        "text": "Hmm... interesting. I've been away from Bionicle for a while, but I'd love to take a crack at what Tahu might like.\n\nTahu strikes me as the sort of guy who wouldn't listen to music much. At least in his younger days. Post-Journey's End Tahu is a whole different ballgame.\n\nHis passion, volatility, and drive may point to a lack of enthusiasm for any kind of entertainment that involved sitting still and listening. But he's also evidently a fan of an action-driven sport like Kohlii, so he might be into something that reminds him of drama, theatricality, and action. (See Mask of Light.)\n\n(If he could be persuaded to listen to music, it would probably be while working out or engaging in hard, physical, outdoor labor. Perhaps Nuparu teamed up with the Nynrah Ghosts to invent stereos and MP3 players.)\n\nHe might also be inclined to tune in to something which reminds him of what drives him: His duty to his people and to Mata Nui. That means something like spiritual or meditative music, something which stirs the softer part of his soul, appealing to his passion for justice (that is, playing fair, keeping your word, and defending the innocent) and his respect for courage and cunning.\n\nI can therefore imagine an older, wiser Toa Tahu, still in fighting shape, practicing his new powers that he got at the end of Journey's End while listening to something from Survivor, Kanye West, or Imagine Dragons. (Maybe humans from the year 3000 figured out a way to import music files to Spherus Magna, and have sent a sleeper ship to make first contact with that planet's residents, due to arrive in about 106,000 years post-Shattering.)\n\nBut after he's done with the day's work, maybe he picks up one of those newfangled paper and cloth books (He likes them much better than stone tablets), perhaps a biography of Toa Lhikan written by Turaga Vakama. So he sits down a flips through it, and then turns on a recording of a choir of Ga-Matoran and Le-Matoran singing a hymn to the mysterious Papa and Ranga (see here: https://drop-a-brick.blogspot.com/2019/09/mnog-chronicle-chapter-iii-sky-father.html), composed by Turaga Nokama, Nuju, and Artakha in the days of peace post-Journey's End. Maybe Tahu, looking up at an old group painting of his old team, smiles in a rare moment of sentimentality, and says to himself, \"Great Beings... Greater Beings... wherever you are... thank you.\"\n\nThat's a former fan-fic writer's take on the subject. I charge five dollars per-Toa for anything after this.\n\nCheers,\n\nX-Ray"
