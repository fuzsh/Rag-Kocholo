        "text": "Music theory is largely regarded as a complex field of study. In fact, the mere instance of the word “theory” harkens to scientific discovery, as though we as musicians must learn the “rocket science” of its language. As a professor of music and audio technology, I’m fascinated by this stuff and I hope that by the end of this post you will feel the same (or at least open up your curiosity to this stuff)!\n\nThe idea that music is a science is partially true: there is definitely a science, but music in and of itself is not the science. We use the science as a tool, as it should be, in order to create the best art we can possibly conjure.\n\nMetal music has been a staple of music theory for some time now, and it’s truly because of its complexity. Many passages in metal music have enormous influence from the likes of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven – even the famous Rob Halford of Judas Priest has noted how he drew upon Renaissance music for inspiration.\n\nOur goal is to decipher a bit of this, and to open the door to understanding music theory. It isn’t something you should be afraid of. Think of it like learning the mechanisms of an engine. Except, we don’t need to be an engineer to do this!\n\nHistorical Context\n\nLet’s dive into the realms of heavy metal, the ultimate sonic force that emerged from the depths of the late 60s and early 70s, mainly birthed in the UK and the US. Drawing its essence from the raw energy of blues-rock and the mind-bending psychedelia of the era, the pioneers of heavy metal sculpted a behemoth sound, characterized by thunderous amplification, blistering guitar solos, relentless rhythms, and an unapologetic wall of sound.\n\nIn the crucible of creation, heavy metal lyrics and stage presence became synonymous with unbridled masculinity and sheer power.\n\nBack in the late 60s, heavy metal and hard rock were like blood brothers, sharing the same DNA of amplified rebellion. But as time unfurled, heavy metal took on a life of its own, cranking up the volume and intensity to spine-shattering levels. While hard rock grooved with a bluesy swagger, heavy metal forged its path with riffs that soared as standalone anthems, devoid of any swing, delivering raw, unadulterated power straight to the soul of the listener.\n\nSome of the great powerhouses that pioneered this genre were heavily influenced by the likes of Led Zeppelin and Queen, with roaring guitars, big drums, and harrowing vocals. From this emerged the likes of Black Sabbath and Judas Priest, amongst many that came during and after. From this, artists began to divulge their own take on the genre.\n\nFrom its roots in the late 60s and early 70s, heavy metal has spawned countless subgenres, each with its own unique sound and identity. Whether it’s the raw aggression of thrash metal, the haunting melodies of black metal, or the technical virtuosity of progressive metal, the metal scene has continually pushed boundaries and expanded its sonic horizons. From the underground cult classics to the mainstream juggernauts, metal subgenres have carved out their niche, catering to a diverse audience of headbangers worldwide.\n\nUnderstanding Music Theory in Metal\n\nMusic theory is the backbone of all musical creation, providing a framework for understanding and composing melodies, harmonies, and rhythms. At its core, music theory explores the fundamental elements of music, including:\n\nNotes and Scales: These are the building blocks of melody. Notes are the individual sounds we hear, while scales are sequences of notes arranged in ascending or descending order, forming the basis for melodies and harmonies.\n\nChords and Harmony: Chords are groups of notes played together, creating rich harmonic textures. Understanding chord progressions and harmony is crucial for composing and arranging music.\n\nRhythm: Rhythm dictates the timing and duration of musical sounds. It encompasses elements like beat, tempo, meter, and rhythmic patterns, providing the backbone for any piece of music.\n\nForm and Structure: This refers to the organization of musical elements over time. Musical forms like verse-chorus, sonata-allegro, or AABA shape the overall structure of a composition.\n\nDynamics and Expression: Dynamics refer to the variations in volume and intensity within a piece of music, while expression encompasses the emotional and stylistic nuances conveyed through performance.\n\nUnderstanding these components of music theory allows musicians to communicate and express themselves effectively, transcending genres and creating music that resonates with listeners on a profound level. So whether you’re shredding on guitar, blasting on drums, or belting out vocals, a solid grasp of music theory will elevate your musical journey to new heights.\n\nMetal’s mastery of music theory is what sets it apart as a genre of unparalleled intensity and complexity.\n\nCommonly employed scales like the natural minor scale (also known as the Aeolian mode) and its darker counterpart, the harmonic minor scale, infuse metal with that signature sense of foreboding and tension. These scales serve as the foundation for crafting haunting melodies and blistering guitar solos that send shivers down your spine.\n\nMetal doesn’t stop at conventional scales – it delves into the depths of musical modes, like the menacing Phrygian mode or the majestic Mixolydian mode, adding layers of color and emotion to its sonic palette. Whether it’s conjuring images of ancient battlegrounds or traversing cosmic realms, metal’s use of modes adds depth and dimension to its sonic tapestry.\n\nAnd let’s not forget about the mighty power of chords! Metal revels in the raw power of dissonance, harnessing the might of crushing power chords and spine-tingling diminished chords to create a sonic assault like no other. These chords, combined with thunderous rhythms and earth-shattering basslines, lay the foundation for metal’s relentless sonic onslaught.\n\nMetal songs often follow a basic structure: verses tell the story with intense energy, while choruses soar with epic hooks. But what really sets metal apart is the mind-blowing guitar solos that showcase the artist’s skill and creativity.\n\nThen there are the breakdowns – those moments where the tempo slows and the heaviness hits hard. These provide a breather before diving back into the chaos.\n\nWhat makes metal unique is its embrace of intensity and unpredictability. While other genres stick to the rules, metal thrives on breaking them.\n\nMetal music owes a significant debt to classical music theory, drawing inspiration from its rich harmonic language, complex compositions, and emotive storytelling. Let’s explore how classical music theory has influenced metal, with examples from iconic bands:\n\nHarmonic Complexity: Classical composers like Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven pioneered intricate harmonic progressions and counterpoint, which metal bands have adapted into their own compositions. For example, the progressive metal band Dream Theater incorporates elements of classical harmony and counterpoint in their elaborate compositions, such as in songs like “The Dance of Eternity,” which features rapid harmonic changes and contrapuntal sections reminiscent of classical music.\n\nOrchestration and Arrangement: Classical music often utilizes orchestral instruments to create dynamic and textured arrangements. Metal bands like Metallica and Opeth have incorporated orchestral elements into their music, using strings, brass, and woodwinds to enhance their soundscapes. Metallica’s “S&M” album, recorded with the San Francisco Symphony, showcases this fusion of metal and classical orchestration, with songs like “The Call of Ktulu” and “No Leaf Clover” reimagined with symphonic accompaniment.\n\nStructural Complexity: Classical music is known for its multi-movement compositions and intricate song structures. Bands like Symphony X and Queensrÿche have drawn from this tradition, crafting concept albums with elaborate narratives and thematic development. Symphony X’s “The Odyssey” is a prime example of this influence, with its sprawling composition divided into multiple sections, each reflecting a different aspect of the epic poem.\n\nMelodic Development: Classical music emphasizes melodic development and thematic variation, principles that metal bands have embraced in their songwriting. Iron Maiden, for instance, incorporates classical-inspired melodies and motifs into their songs, creating memorable hooks and themes. The guitar harmonies in tracks like “Hallowed Be Thy Name” and “Fear of the Dark” showcase this melodic sensibility, evoking the grandeur of classical compositions.\n\nIn essence, classical music theory serves as a rich source of inspiration for metal bands, providing them with a framework for crafting intricate compositions, dynamic arrangements, and emotive storytelling. By incorporating elements of classical music into their own sound, metal bands pay homage to a venerable tradition while pushing the boundaries of the genre.\n\nMusical Characteristics\n\nLet’s begin with riffs. Riffs are like the building blocks of metal, laying down the foundation for the entire song. These badass musical motifs are repeated throughout the track, driving the energy forward and hooking listeners in with their infectious groove.\n\nThese riffs are usually in combination with chords. Many times, power chords are the backbone of metal riffs, providing a lot of structural foundation to the music. These consist of the root, fifth, and octave. Why power chord, you ask? Just listen to one and tell me it doesn’t add a satisfying sense of strength to the music…\n\nBut let’s not overlook the diads, two note “chords” that add a touch of complexity to the riffing arsenal. Take “Peace Sells” by Megadeth, for example – that iconic intro riff is fueled by razor-sharp diads! Diads are useful, because they can versatility to your bass lines. If the guitar is playing only two notes, the bass can flush out the chordal structure in other interesting ways that they wouldn’t be able to if they were tied to only three notes.\n\nFull chords, like the ones found in the interlude of “Master of Puppets” by Metallica are beefy, full-bodied additions that add depth and richness to the music, creating a moment of respite amidst the chaos before unleashing hell once again. They consist of the root, third and fifth.\n\nWhen it comes to scales, there’s an entire arsenal that fuel the fiery fretwork of metal guitarists everywhere! Here are some of the most common:\n\nNatural Minor Scale (Aeolian Mode):\n\nExample: The main riff in Iron Maiden’s “The Trooper” is based on the natural minor scale. This scale’s dark and haunting tones are perfect for crafting brooding melodies and intense solos.\n\nHarmonic Minor Scale:\n\nExample: Yngwie Malmsteen’s “Black Star” showcases the harmonic minor scale with its distinctive raised seventh degree, adding a touch of exoticism and tension to the solo sections.\n\nPhrygian Mode:\n\nExample: Metallica’s “Disposable Heroes” features sections in the Phrygian mode, known for its sinister and aggressive sound. This scale is often used to evoke a sense of impending doom and chaos.\n\nDiminished Scale:\n\nExample: Dream Theater’s “The Dance of Eternity” explores the diminished scale in its mind-bending solo sections. This scale’s symmetrical pattern creates a sense of tension and dissonance, perfect for adding complexity to metal compositions.\n\nPentatonic Scale:\n\nExample: The iconic solo in Ozzy Osbourne’s “Crazy Train” is based on the pentatonic scale. This scale’s simplicity and versatility make it a favorite among metal guitarists for crafting catchy and memorable solos.\n\nPhrygian Dominant Scale:\n\nExample: Slayer’s “Raining Blood” features sections in the Phrygian dominant scale, known for its aggressive and exotic sound. This scale adds a sense of urgency and intensity to the music, driving the energy to new heights.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the diverse array of scales used in metal music. Whether it’s the dark and brooding tones of the natural minor scale or the fiery intensity of the Phrygian dominant scale, metal guitarists draw upon a rich tapestry of scales to create the blistering solos and crushing riffs that define the genre.\n\nIn regards to rhythm, metal music is renowned for its fearless exploration of time signatures that defy the constraints of conventional rhythm. From blast beats to polyrhythmic grooves, metal drummers are the architects of chaos, weaving intricate patterns that challenge both the mind and body. I can attest to this as a metal drummer myself, in which I have encountered great struggle trying to create something such as Homerik, which has a ton of rhythmic changes and orchestration.\n\nOne classic example of complex time signatures in metal is Meshuggah’s “Bleed.” This relentless onslaught of rhythmic madness features a mind-bending 29/16 time signature, creating a dizzying whirlwind of syncopation and aggression. Tomas Haake uses the herta rhythmic pattern predominantly to give this intricate sense of change. I always point folks to my colleague, Jonathan Pieslak, about his report on Meshuggah.\n\nBut Meshuggah isn’t the only band pushing the boundaries of rhythmic complexity. Gojira’s “The Art of Dying” showcases the band’s mastery of odd time signatures, seamlessly transitioning between 5/4, 7/4, and 11/8 with effortless precision. This rhythmic tapestry adds layers of tension and intrigue to the music, drawing listeners deeper into the sonic abyss. I had the pleasure of drum teching Mario Duplantier once at Gojira’s Silvercord Studios. His passion for drumming is quite literally unmatched.\n\nAnd let’s not forget about the polyrhythmic wizardry of bands like Tool. In tracks like “Lateralus,” Tool effortlessly blends complex time signatures like 9/8 and 7/8, creating a hypnotic groove that defies explanation. This rhythmic experimentation adds depth and texture to the music, elevating it to what feels like a transcendent realm of sonic exploration.\n\nIn songs such as “Cemetery Gates” by Pantera and numerous tracks by Iron Maiden, the vocal performances exemplify a captivating fusion of metal and classical singing techniques. Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden both demonstrate remarkable operatic range and emotional depth in their delivery. Anselmo’s vocals in “Cemetery Gates” seamlessly transition between haunting melodies and intense screams, showcasing precise breath control and dynamic expression reminiscent of operatic tenors. Similarly, Dickinson’s performances in Iron Maiden’s iconic tracks like “Hallowed Be Thy Name” exhibit soaring highs and dramatic lows, resonating with the grandeur of classical operatic performances. Another fabulous performer, Warrel Dane, during the days of Nevermore showcased how opera technique elevated the sound of metal music to be more than just a screaming fit.\n\nThese vocalists employ techniques such as vowel modification and proper breath support to achieve a powerful and resonant sound that cuts through the dense instrumentation of metal music. Their ability to convey intense emotion through their vocal delivery draws listeners into the narrative of the songs, creating a profound connection between the music and the audience. By embracing elements of classical singing within the metal genre, Dane, Anselmo and Dickinson elevate their vocal performances to a level of artistry that transcends traditional boundaries, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of heavy metal music.\n\nIn Their Own Words\n\nYngwie Malmsteen had a discussion with Ultimate Guitar about whether the importance of music theory played a role in his development:\n\n“Absolutely. Abso-fucking-lutely, man. Listen, if you want to write a book that will make people feel engaged and you want to paint a picture with words, if you don’t know the grammar and you haven’t mastered the language, it’s pointless. So it’s rubbish, it’s fucking bullshit when people say, ‘I play with feeling.’ That’s OK, I play with feeling too. But if you don’t have the technique and the knowledge to covey this feeling so that other people can understand it… When I play, I put my whole soul into what I play, but what I play is also very, very, very correct. It’s one of those things where you can be a classical musician and play by sight reading or you can be extremely well educated in theory and improvise with the knowledge that you have. So you will improvise something and people will say, ‘That’s amazing, when did you write that?’, and you’ll say, ‘I wrote it now.’ Improvisation is the genesis of composition. All great compositions were improvised. But that improvisation cannot be formed unless you have the capability to do it and the knowledge of theory. Otherwise, you’re just taking a guess. If you want to really express a note and you don’t have the perfect vibrato and intonation, then you don’t have the ability to take that note and bring it somewhere. Like Paganini said, ‘One must feel strongly to make others feel strongly’ – so it’s like somebody is writing the most amazing solo but it’s in Greek and you don’t understand Greek. You need to converse this thing and give it to people in a way they understand. Music is a universal language. If you want to play free-form jazz where there are no rules, but in Western style, music has certain rules that are pleasing to the ear. They’re very simple, it’s all mathematics, you know, that all it is. You know that – I’m sure.”\n\n– Yngiwe Malmsteen\n\nSimone Simons of Epica had a conversation with Blabbermouth on her experience as the frontwoman of the symphonic metal goliath:\n\n“I sing in many different styles. In the past, it was mainly just classical and that evolved also through the years. I’ve worked with different teachers and I’m pretty happy where I’m at at this moment, but you can always learn. There’s some band members that have musical history. They’ve studied music. I’ve taken singing lessons. The thing I could work on more is the musical theory stuff in order to understand more songwriting. I don’t write songs myself. I can’t. I write lyrics and vocal lines. That’s something I would like to work on. My husband [Kamelot keyboardist Oliver Palotai] is a piano player and he’s already offered me free lessons, so I should accept in order to understand harmonies and all that stuff a little more. I have a feeling for it, but if you have knowledge of musical theory, that will come easier and you understand music language because that’s also a thing. I know some basic stuff.”\n\n– Simone Simons\n\nGuitar virtuoso Jeff Loomis discusses his challenges with music theory with Music Theory for Guitar:\n\n“Well, I mean, coming from a guy that’s talking right now, obviously I don’t know much music theory as I express in my guitar clinics. I really rely on what I think sounds good to my natural ear, and I think whatever sounds good is good as far as when you are recording stuff. I do know a little bit of music theory and I do know my way around the fret board pretty decently as far as the way that scales are connected and such but really I rely on just my ear and what sounds good. And I try to write very dark heavy stuff, very minor sounding stuff. But my definite answer to other kids out there that want to play the way I do is really to come up with your own style and technique and just try to be yourself. Try to be an innovator and try to come up with something that’s original. It’s very important that you do that. A lot of kids out there that love metal just listen to metal music. I think that’s cool and all, but I think you really can open your mind much more by listening to different styles of music such as jazz and classical music as well. So try to keep an open mind with what you listen to. It can really steer you in another direction musically as well. So keep an open mind. It’s a good thing to do.”\n\n– Jeff Loomis\n\nResources for Further Learning\n\nMap of Metal\n\nJonathan Pieslak (Meshuggah article)\n\nUltimate Guitar (Interview with Malmsteen)\n\nBlabbermouth (Interview with Simons)\n\nMusic Theory for Guitar (Interview with Loomis)\n\nGetting Started with Metal Music Theory\n\nIt’s easy to say, “I’ll just use my ear.” While that is true, music theory is the knowledge behind using your ear. It’s much harder to undergo the study of the languange of music. But, think about how much more you could do because you have a true understanding of the “science”. It’s a trait that will stick with you for a lifetime, and you’ll be able to decipher things in the music you love versus the music you create, opening doors to new ideas and complexities unavailable to you prior.\n\nLearning and applying music theory to metal music starts here, with Metal Music Theory. It’s my course that is designed to be a guide for beginners on learning music theory with a focus on metal, including resources for instrumentalists and vocalists. It’s broken down into several modules where you can learn at your own pace to maximize your efforts. Don’t be intimidated by music theory. It’s just a tool that can help you elevate your musical compositions to the next level. With Metal Mastermind®, you’ve got that tool right in your back pocket."
