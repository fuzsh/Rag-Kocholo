        "text": "Disclaimer... The posting of this article is not intended to incite or provoke anybody or their understanding of what Power Metal may be. In my opinion, there is no right or wrong here, just various views and interpretations. In short, I am posting this with the hopes of generating intelligent conversation and perhaps even a debate. I will ignore any personal attacks or confrontational criticism and hope other serious participants of this forum will do the same.\n\nSomebody asked me today WTF is Power Metal? I am no authority on the subject & my appreciation of the genre has developed from information which may or may not be correct. In other words - I don't really know. I rely a lot on the Rockdector book 'A to Z of Power Metal' and Metal-Archives for a lot of information although I don't think either of these sources is completely accurate. According to Rock Detector - 'Power Metal is heavy metal taken to the surgically precise limit...' I like to think they are correct. Included in their book are all the more commonly acknowledged PM acts like Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, Rhapsody, Helloween, Hammerfall & Manowar. In addition to all the obvious, the book includes Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Iced Earth, Nevermore, Paragon, Jag Panzer, Symphorce, Rage, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Manilla Road, Savatage, Rainbow, Mercyful Fate, Cirith Ungol, Omen, Fates Warning, Accept, Angel Dust, Manticora, and many more that are unlikely to actually be considered PM by some.\n\nOn a personal level - If its in the book, I consider it Power Metal & I enjoy many bands in all of its sub-genres. From the emotion & solemnity of Savatage, to the exhilarating Gaia Epicus, to the epic power of Domine and intense complexity of Wuthering Heights. It surprises me that Ive heard some say it isnt even metal. Ive also heard it referred to it as Flower Metal(I dont even know what that is- But it doesnt sound good). Some folks think its all about LOTR & dragon worship. Others Ive spoke with believe power metal is the reincarnation of hair metal & even more people seem to think PM is limited to the speedy, happy Euro metal with high-pitched vocals.\n\nSo what is the popular belief in this forum? Who can answer the age old question - WTF is Power Metal?\n\nbesides the personal view, it has also changed over the years. The first time I heard the term \"power metal\" was in the 80's to describe the style of Overkill! So originally I think it was for bands within the general (old school) heavy metal spectrum that had a bit more power (and aggression) than average.\n\nWith bands like Helloween and their followers a sort of new genre evolved that also got named power metal, though I don't really know why. The typical style of melody with fast drums and usually fairly high vocals, I personally don't like at all and call it happy metal. To me it generally lacks heaviness and aggression and I'm one of those people that finds some of these bands hardly metal, because the music is so \"light\". But of course it's hard (if not impossible) to draw a specific line between rock, hardrock and metal. Many bands that play general heavy metal without going into any specific subgenre get called power metal now, maybe by lack of a better word, as the term 'heavy metal' on itself is too wide.\n\nThese days I kind of divide power metal into the light euro version (that I call happy metal) and bands like Iced Earth that are more like general heavy metal that I would call aggressive power metal - simply to let people know that with this style (that is my favorite style in metal together with thrash) I don't mean the lighter kind that I don't like at all.\n\nAbout Rockdetector, they do include some bands that I wouldn't call power metal, like e.g. Rainbow (hardrock) or Dream Theater (progressive metal). They also have quite a few mistakes here and there in the descriptions, but I guess it's hard to double check every bit of info when compiling stuff for a book like this. One of the reasons I would never make a book like that (and that it would always be outdated already even by the time it comes out). On another note.. 3 books (I believe the power metal one too) contain a lot of pics of my hubby (Nico Wobben)\n\nGreat post and great reply:\n\nI don't consider myself an expert at anything, much less the guy who can determine what is and what is not powermetal.\n\nI can give you what I believe are three views of powermetal...... the view of the industry, the common view (of non-powermetal fans) and my view.\n\nThe view from the industry:\n\nIf the music doesn't fit the other sub-genres of metal...... it is powermetal.\n\nThe view of fans who do not know the genre as a whole....\n\nMuch like Marlies stated..... super fast double bass drums, keyboard softened guitars, and high clean vocals.\n\nThe view by me.......\n\nI think Powermetal goes back to bands like Accept and Iron Maiden. Though they had totally different styles, they achieved a similar goal in their music. I personally think a true powermetal band can blend the right amount of aggression and melody into music along with strong hooks that keep them in your head. Some of my favorite bands of all-time \"I\" consider powermetal..... Accept, Grim reaper, Metal Church, Tesla, Armored Saint, Queensryche, Angel Dust, Tad Morose..... the list could continue for a long while.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer to this question. The problem is that it is an unfortunate necessity that metal music needs to be put under sub-genres and the sub-genre labeled \"powermetal\" actually covers a pretty large variety of styles. A good bit of it I don't care for, but some of it is among my all-time faves.\n\nBryant\n\nSomebody asked me today WTF is Power Metal? I am no authority on the subject & my appreciation of the genre has developed from information which may or may not be correct. In other words - I don't really know.\n\nNeither do I but for me is a kind of metal offspring of classic metal driven by Judas Priest and Iron Maiden sound. Usually fast, melodic, with clean vocals, catchy choruses, speed drumming and may or may not have keyboards.\n\nStratovarius, Sonata Arctica, Rhapsody, Helloween, Hammerfall & Manowar. In addition to all the obvious, the book includes Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Iced Earth, Nevermore, Paragon, Jag Panzer, Symphorce, Rage, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Manilla Road, Savatage, Rainbow, Mercyful Fate, Cirith Ungol, Omen, Fates Warning, Accept, Angel Dust, Manticora\n\nFrom your list there are bands I consider power metal, but others are either classic, NWOBHM, prog-power, prog or crap\n\nPower metal for me: Helloween, Hammerfall, Heavens Gate, Blind Guardian, Angra, Azeroth, (early) Avalanch, Azrael, Freedom Call, Forgotten Tales, Wonderland, Sabaton, Wolf, Astral Doors, Imperio, Crescent Shield, Onward, Steel Prophet, etc and in there you have from the ballsy to the sugary\n\nSo like all the tag system in metal it's always relative.\n\nNP: Ironsword - 'War Hymn'\n\nI can see how it can be argued that perhaps PM stemmed from Maiden. I dont see how bands like Accept or Grave Digger can be called that without the operatic vocals of Dickinson. Also Maiden are kinda the epitome of metal, they've influenced so many metal bands and not simply just PM acts.\n\nI am of the ilk that PM was born officialy with Helloween as speedy metal riffs and high vocals. I like Helloween and Gamma Ray but I'm not mad about them and never considered myself a PM fan because the buck stops there. I dont know if I've helped answer your question or rather inadvertently asked \"is the Priest of Evil really a PM fan?\" After all, I really like Maiden,Accept, Grave Digger, Omen etc.\n\nI don't agree with the modern-day description of \"power metal\". I'm a metalhead of the 80s and that title was reserved for albums like Accept - Restless and Wild and Overkill - Feel The Fire. They went above and beyond what we considered \"metal\", like Maiden, Priest and Saxon.\n\nThey were metal albums, but with more POWER!\n\nSomewhere along the line, the \"power\" adjective got assigned to the New Wave of European Helloween Clones, and I'd still like to beat the idiot who got that started. In 1987 I thought of Helloween as speed metal and still do to this day. When your tempo is dominated by repetive double-bass drums, you're speed metal.\n\nBut, times have changed, and I've had to change with them. Power metal to me is exactly how the masses percieve it; a very broad section of the heavy metal scene as a whole. Everything from Dragonforce to Nevermore.\n\nBring on the sub-genres!\n\nI consider power metal to be mid to fast tempo metal with a strong melodic singer. Songs usually don't go past the 7 minute mark, unlike a lot of Prog Metal. There is also less emphasis on musicianship for the sake of the song.\n\nOh yeah, and Dragons are a must!\n\nThat is just how anyone who's not familiar with the genre views it. Most of the greatest Power Metal songs are over 7-10 mins. And Power Metal is all about musicmanship. The band members are usually musically proficient.\n\nNow, I am not a musician, so please excuse me if I make mistakes over the musical description of the genre. I am only telling it like I see it.\n\nPower Metal is a diverse genre. It has been derived primarily from Iron Maiden's sound, and of course, Speed Metal. It is primarily distinguished by:\n\n1) Uplifting Music. Exceptions to this are bands like Adagio and Iced Earth, and some technical Progressive Power Metal bands.\n\n2) Lack of Heaviness, that is present in Thrash, Death and Black Metal.\n\n3) Clean Vocals. Again, exceptions are seen in Folky bands like Battlelore, or Extreme bands like Children of Bodom.\n\n4) Relying on Melody. Finnish Power Metal especially, most of it is keyboard driven. German Power Metal may be somewhere between melodic and traditional metal.\n\n5) Sizzling Solos. Also, use of Choirs and other symphonic elements to create 'epicness' in their music.\n\n6) Lyrics vary. Contrary to popular belief, few bands sing about dragons. I can name only just 3 or 4 bands that actually play 'cheese metal'. Other themes include Sci-Fi, Horror, Life issues (Prog Power bands), Historical events, etc.\n\nSub-Genres of Power Metal\n\nSymphonic Power Metal - The 'Cheesy' genre. Blind Guardian, Rhapsody, Heavenly, etc.\n\nThrashy Power Metal - Iced Earth, Brainstorm, etc.\n\nMelodic Power Metal - Most Finnish bands like Sonata Arctica, Stratovarius, Children of Bodom, etc.\n\nProgressive Power Metal - Adagio, Angra, Kamelot, Evergrey, Symphony X, Lost Horizon, etc.\n\nHeavy/Speed/Power Metal - Most German bands like Helloween, Gamma Ray, Grave Digger, Primal Fear, etc. And the old school American bands belong here too.\n\nExtreme Power Metal - Children of Bodom, Dragonforce.\n\nMost Power Metal bands create atleast 1-2 'Epic' songs per album clocking over 10 mins, occasionally touching 20 mins.\n\n---\n\nWell, that's how I understand Power Metal to be. Whether I am right or wrong.\n\nI don't agree with the modern-day description of \"power metal\". I'm a metalhead of the 80s and that title was reserved for albums like Accept - Restless and Wild and Overkill - Feel The Fire. They went above and beyond what we considered \"metal\", like Maiden, Priest and Saxon.\n\nThey were metal albums, but with more POWER!\n\nBut, times have changed, and I've had to change with them. Power metal to me is exactly how the masses percieve it; a very broad section of the heavy metal scene as a whole. Everything from Dragonforce to Nevermore.\n\nBring on the sub-genres!\n\nYeah Trans, this is true. Alot of genre names were thrown around in the 80's I could never tell what was speed or thrash or power. Now -days we can look back and put everything in its box but was the box ever really there or did we just need to validate everything that badly?\n\nyeah what the fuck is that¿?? is like the worst shit i ever heard, all song of that crap talks about dragons and flames and stuffs like that..\n\nThat's a very narrow minded attitude. Lots of good power metal has nothing to do with that. That's is like saying all black/death metal has to do with satan and anti-christianism.\n\nGo and check Sabaton, Wolf, Azrael, Heavens Gate, Steel Prophet, Highland Glory and Angra (since they're playing here next week). The power metal world is not about Rhapsody, Sonata Arctica, Freedom Call, Blind Guardian, Cryonic Temple or Dream Evil only.\n\nAnd if people like to sing about swords, elves, dragons, so what? Thrash is full of bands singing about war, destruction, oppression, corruption etc, so then what I should stop listen to thrash and save by watching CNN or the news headlines to remind the REAL WORLD ?\n\nThe bottomline is if you DON'T like it, then DON'T listen to it and leave the rest be, to each its own.\n\nOur country is in the turmoil it is exactly because people emit judgements without information. I expected more from a metalhead, not the rethoric of Jose Miguel Corrales :Smug:\n\nNP: Walter Giardino - 'Astróloga'"
