Hello, I'm writing in regard to the distutils package for python. I regularly repackage installers for silent/automated distribution on numerous Windows PCs throughout an enterprise. Sites such as AppDeploy (http://www.appdeploy.com) and tools such as WISE all suggest that this is a pretty common task.

We are in the process of upgrading part of a large system to .NET, whilst the majority will remain ASP. Sharing session state information will not be a problem at the moment as it is trivial and will be passed in using QueryString. More pressing is the synchronisation of session timeouts between the two environments. Is the only way to do this to have URL references from one environment to another. For example on the ASP pages have...

Currently the core component is a Windows forms application and it uses .net remoting to communicate with slaves that are windows services. I'd like to add a web ui to the core component to allow a user to do a very small subset of what they can do through the windows forms gui. My understanding that the asp stuff will be...

Hello folks, I am unable to find appropriate documentation on the type promotion of bit-fields when using the generalised comparison operator "<=>".

Here is my compilation command: g++-12 -std=c++20 -Wnarrowing bit_field.cpp Here is the code in...
