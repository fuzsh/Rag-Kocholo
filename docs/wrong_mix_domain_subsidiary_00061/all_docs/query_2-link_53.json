        "text": "If you are new to Java, I'd suggest going through the Java tutorials. They are pretty good, and once you've mastered the basics you can do Creating a GUI with Swing.\n\nYour life will probably be easier if you use an IDE with good GUI-building capabilities (similar to Visual Studio assuming that is where you are coming from). I'd recommend either Eclipse (the latest version has a decent GUI builder) or Netbeans.\n\nThe good news is that writing a cross-platform Swing GUI is fairly simple. A minimal \"Hello World\" Swing app is something like this:\n\npackage testswing; import javax.swing.JFrame; public class Basic { public static void main(String[] args) { JFrame f=new JFrame(\"Hello World\"); f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); f.setVisible(true); } }\n\nYou have a few options available for deployment:\n\nPackage your application using Java Web Start. This is fully cross-platform and allows for single-click deployment over the web.\n\nPackage everything into a runnable .jar file. Simple and effective, although it requires Java to be installed on the users computer and the correct file associations to be set up so that .jar is associated with the appropriate JRE.\n\nCreate native application installers. See SO question: Java Application Installers\n\nUse Java Web Start.\n\nJava Web Start (JWS) is the Oracle Corporation technology used to launch rich client (Swing, AWT, SWT) desktop applications directly from a network or internet link. It offers 'one click' installation for platforms that support Java.\n\nJWS provides many appealing features including, but not limited to, splash screens, desktop integration, file associations, automatic update ..\n\nTo ensure the user has the right version of Java (or later) needed to run the app., use the deployJava.js script. It is mentioned amongst the links at the bottom of that page."
