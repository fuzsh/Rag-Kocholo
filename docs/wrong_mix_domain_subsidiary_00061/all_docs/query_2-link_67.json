        "text": "User Management\n\nApplications Manager permits five different roles to work with the product apart from the default admin role. The different roles are Normal Admin, Delegated Admin, User, Operator and Manager.\n\nDefault / Super Admin : The system Super Administrators are allowed to perform all admin activities. The Super Administrator role also has the privilege to configure user management. The Super Admin role is the default admin user and it cannot be deleted or renamed.\n\nNormal Admin : Normal Administrators are allowed to perform all default admin activities except the following :\n\nAccess query tool and DB status from Support under Tools in Settings tab.\n\nShut down the Applications Manager service from within the product.\n\nAccess Account Policy tab in User Management under Product Settings in Settings tab.\n\nAccess all Admin permissions in Permissions tab in User Management under Product Settings in Settings tab.\n\nDelegated Admin : The delegated administration role is used to assign limited administrative privileges to users in your organization who aren't default administrators. More information on Delegated Admin role and how to enable Delegated Admin Preferences can be viewed here.\n\nUser : A system user will have read-only access to all components of the product. Users will not have the privilege to access, configure or edit the different components of the product.\n\nOperator: The system operators have read-only access to only those components of the product that the default administrator assigns to the operator. The operator role does not have the privilege to access, configure or edit the different components of the product. If an operator is part of a Monitor Group, then the restrictions will be in effect only for the operator and not others.\n\nManager: The Manager has an integrated high-level view of the Business Infrastructure. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) can be created and associated with various business applications and servers. More information on Manager role can be viewed here.\n\nIn the Settings page, click User Management under Global Configurations to browse through the following tabs:\n\nProfiles\n\nUser Groups\n\nDomains\n\nPermissions\n\nViews\n\nAccount Policy\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication (TFA)\n\nSAML Authentication\n\nNote: User management is not supported for the Applications Manager plugin build over OpManager. At present, there are only two types of roles available for plugin users - Administrator and Read-Only User. Operator, Delegated Admin and Manager role is not supported. Applications Manager Plugin users cannot assign monitors to the any specific users in the Apps tab. They can view all the default monitors only.\n\nProfiles\n\nApplications Manager provides you with the ability to manage users and roles for your enterprise, with roles assigned to users and different permissions associated to each role. This is achieved by first adding users and associating the users with the roles.\n\nYou can also import users from Active Directory or LDAP. This functionality is implemented as a more convenient method to add a large number of users and to ease the user management in Applications Manager.

By default, Applications Manager allows admin user(s) to execute IBM i operations but the option can be disabled.\n\nViews\n\nThis is for Operator only. Using View option, you can define how to represent your subgroup in the webclient.You can either show the associated subgroups directly in the home tab itself or from the corresponding top level Monitor Group.\n\nAccount Policy\n\nYou can configure Account Policies in Applications Manager to enhance web client security. Following is the list of options that are available under the Account Policy tab:\n\nEnforce account lockout: Allows you to enforce account lockout in case of configured number of continuous failed logins and account lock timeout (in minutes) where the user account is locked due to incorrect credentials. By default, this option is enabled.\n\nEnforce single user session: Allows you to enforce single-user sessions to user accounts by restricting concurrent sessions by a single-user account. Choose the login mode from either of the following options:\n\nRestrict latest login: Restricts the later login requests if the user has already logged in.\n\nAllow only latest login: Upon a successful login request, it allows the successful login alone and logs out of all the existing sessions.\n\nEnforce strong password rules for users: Allows you to enforce strong password rules for the enhanced security of users. By default, the following are the password rules that are implemented in Applications Manager:\n\nPassword cannot be the same/part of your login name.\n\nPassword length should not be less than 8 characters.\n\nPassword length should not be greater than 255 characters.\n\nPassword should contain at least 1 numeric character.\n\nPassword should contain at least 1 special character.\n\nPassword should contain both uppercase and lowercase characters.\n\nPassword should not be same as your last 4 password(s). (Applicable only when the option Enforce strong password rules for users is enabled)\n\nEnforce password change for users during first login: Allows you to enforce password change for users that are logging in for the first time and for users that update the password manually under Settings → User Management → Profiles. By default, this option is enabled.\n\nEnforce password expiry for user accounts: Allows you to enforce password expiry by specifying the number of days after which the password is to be expired for the user accounts. By default, this option is enabled. You can choose to avoid enforcing password expiry by disabling this option for the user accounts.\n\nRestrict user management operations for administrator accounts: Allows you to restrict user management operations (such as create, update or delete) to user profiles, user groups, and domains for all administrator accounts.\n\nEnable business hour preferences for user accounts: Allows you to enable business hours preferences for the user accounts to login. By default, this option is enabled.\n\nEnable Reset Password option for user accounts: Allows you to enable the Reset Password option for user accounts in the login page. By default, this option is enabled.\n\nMinimum password length: Allows you to configure the minimum password length required for creating a user profile and logging into Applications Manager console. By default, minimum password length is 8 characters and should not exceed 255 characters.\n\nNote: Upon configuring the minimum password length, all newly-created users profiles as well as existing user profiles performing password update would be made to add passwords that meet the configured minimum length requirement.\n\nConfiguring Active Directory / LDAP with the configuration file\n\nYou can import users and perform role configuration for LDAP users and groups in Applications Manager. Users and groups are fetched into Applications Manager from different domains, based on the entry in the authentication.conf file found in the following location. For LDAP configuration, you can edit the ldapConfiguration.conf file found under <Applications Manager Home>/conf directory.\n\nLDAP Configuration\n\nldap.group.commonNameAttribute=cn\n\nldap.group.primaryAttribute=cn\n\nldap.group.displayNameAttribute=cn\n\nldap.group.objectCategory=group\n\nldap.group.objectClass=posixGroup;groupOfNames\n\nldap.group.memberAttribute=member;memberUid\n\nldap.group.memberofAttribute=\n\nldap.group.groupTokenAttribute=gidNumber\n\nldap.user.commonNameAttribute=cn\n\nldap.user.primaryAttribute=uid\n\nldap.user.displayNameAttribute=cn\n\nldap.user.objectCategory=person\n\nldap.user.objectClass=person;posixAccount\n\nldap.user.memberofAttribute=\n\nldap.user.emailAttribute=mail\n\nldap.user.groupidAttribute=gidNumber\n\nActive Directory Configuration\n\nad.group.commonNameAttribute=cn\n\nad.group.primaryAttribute=sAMAccountName\n\nad.group.displayNameAttribute=cn\n\nad.group.objectCategory=group\n\nad.group.objectClass=group\n\nad.group.memberAttribute=member\n\nad.group.memberofAttribute=memberOf\n\nad.group.groupTokenAttribute=primaryGroupToken\n\nad.user.commonNameAttribute=cn\n\nad.user.primaryAttribute=sAMAccountName\n\nad.user.displayNameAttribute=displayname\n\nad.user.objectCategory=person\n\nad.user.objectClass=\n\nad.user.memberofAttribute=memberOf\n\nad.user.emailAttribute=mail\n\nad.user.groupidAttribute=primaryGroupID\n\nNote: If you have changes in LdapConfiguration.conf and later want to retain the initial configuration, simply rename the file (for example, rename it to LdapConfiguration_old.conf) or move the file to different location and restart Applications Manager.\n\nDelegated Admin Preferences\n\nThe delegated administration role is used to assign limited administrative privileges to users in your organization who aren't administrators. By delegating administration, you can assign a range of administrative tasks to the appropriate users and let operators take more control of their local network resources.\n\nEnabling Delegated Admin Preferences:\n\nIn the Settings page, click User Management under Applications Manager Server Settings\n\nNavigate to the Permissions tab.\n\nIn the Admin Permissions table, check the Enable Delegated Admin Preferences. Once this checkbox is checked, when an administrator adds a new user to Applications Manager, he is asked to specify by a checkbox if he wishes to add the new user as a Delegated Admin.\n\nYou can also perform the enable the following actions from the Admin Permissions table:\n\nAllow Delegated Admin to view/use thresholds and anomaly profiles created by administrators (non-delegated administrators) and other delegated administrators in the same user group.\n\nAllow Delegated Admin to view/use all actions created by administrators (non-delegated administrators) and other delegated administrators in the same user group.\n\nDelegated Administrator Privileges\n\nThe following table lists the User Privileges of the Delegated Admin role in various scenarios:"
