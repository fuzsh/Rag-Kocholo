It communicates with the Wazuh server, sending data in near real-time through an encrypted and authenticated channel.\n\nThe agent was developed considering the need to monitor a wide variety of different endpoints without impacting their performance. It is supported on the most popular operating systems, and it requires 35 MB of RAM on average.\n\nThe Wazuh agent provides key features to enhance your systemâs security.\n\nLog collector\n\nCommand execution\n\nFile integrity monitoring (FIM)\n\nSecurity configuration assessment (SCA)\n\nSystem inventory\n\nMalware detection\n\nActive response\n\nContainer security\n\nCloud security\n\nTo install a Wazuh agent, select your operating system and follow the instructions.\n\nIf you are deploying Wazuh in a large environment, with a high number of servers or endpoints, keep in mind that this deployment might be easier using automation tools such as Puppet, Chef, SCCM, or Ansible.\n\nNote\n\nCompatibility between the Wazuh agent and the Wazuh manager is guaranteed when the Wazuh manager version is later than or equal to that of the Wazuh agent.\n\nYou can also deploy a new agent following the instructions in the Wazuh dashboard. Go to Endpoints Summary, and click on Deploy new agent.\n\nThen the Wazuh dashboard will show you the steps to deploy a new agent."
