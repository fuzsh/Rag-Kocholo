        "text": "Topic 1: Determining Products with Multiple Supported Versions\n\nPatch My PC supports a wide variety of applications and updates, some of the applications in the Patch My PC catalog support multiple major versions or tracks at the same time. Patch My PC attempts to support these multiple versions where possible.\n\nTo determine Patch My PC products with multiple supported versions, look for a version number specified at the end of the product name in the Patch My PC Publisher. If using SCUP or the ConfigMgr built-in 3rd party updates feature, the category usually will specify the version number as well.\n\nFor Patch My PC Updates (WSUS and Intune Updates) where the version is specified in the Publisher, the following applies:\n\nPatch My PC will not upgrade an older version of the software if it is older than the version specified in the Publisher\n\nPatch My PC will attempt to provide the latest available release of the version specified in the Publisher\n\nTopic 3: “Latest” Version Designation for Patch My PC Products\n\nApplications and Updates in Patch My PC with the word “Latest” in the product name will always install the latest version of the specified application on devices where any older version of the specified application is found. These Applications and Updates will also usually include a Pre-Script that will remove any older version of the software if found.\n\nTips for “Latest” Version Designation Products:\n\nPatch My PC Products with the “Latest” version designation will never be auto-enabled via the database scan features. They must be manually selected in order to be published.\n\nTarget updates with the “Latest” designation to a specific group of devices where the major version upgrade is to be performed\n\nFilter updates with a title containing the word “Latest” from ADRs for Patch my PC Updates, this will ensure that “Latest” version designated products are not accidentally deployed to all systems and can prevent unwanted upgrades."
