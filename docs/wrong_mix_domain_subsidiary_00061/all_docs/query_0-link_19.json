        "text": "I am already self hosting it (though having problem logging in with it after having created a user).\n\nThe point is, whether it’s self hosted or not, such a security sensitive product should have people behind become a bit more open to who they’re.\n\nThe installation is through their script that I need to download at a certain time and while it’s open source, I don’t really check every part of the code that gets downloaded at that moment and it would make people feel more comfortable to know that people behind is willing to put their names on it.\n\nI have much less concern having my Skype chat leaked than my entire database of every account on the web leaked.\n\nSecurity audit is not for a single person to venture. I’m more concerned why ‘8bit Solutions’ is almost non existent except being linked to this product as a name. While the dedication of the author to the project does make me somewhat comfortable into trusting it, visibility could certainly be better when this has gone to be a commercial product.\n\nI don’t want to talk about extreme cases neither want to accuse the bitwarden author but if a scam company pays someone $500k a year to develop a password manager that actually works great but inject a backdoor on random downloads every now and then that’s never published on github, maybe someone would continue to develop it but would likely keep a low profile for their real identity.\n\nThe size of the project is certainly different from others but for example, LastPass’ company has this.\n\nI’ve been testing various password managers lately, and concluded that Bitwarden does it best for my needs. I’m currently self-hosting it, though I’ve not really taken the final decision whether to continue self-hosting vs. keeping it on the BW cloud.\n\nYou’re right in that 8bit Solutions is much smaller and less exposed than, say, LogMeIn who own Lastpass. On the other hand, if you search a bit more, you’ll find that Kyle, the lead developer of BW, is very very active on various forums answering the myriad questions that people ask, from posts like “thinking of switching to Bitwarden” to specific feature requests and of course bug reports or queries. He is certainly not invisible. He answers support queries very quickly and helpfully.\n\nFrom the experience I’ve had so far, it appears to me that BW is Kyle’s main (if not only) project and he seems to put in a lot of effort and energy to it. I do my bit to support by buying the family and premium plans, I hope others do too.\n\nAt the same time, of course he wouldn’t want to be an “open book”, he will have a personal life that he wants to keep private!\n\nWith regards to open source, as you say you (nor I) don’t check every bit of code we download. I wouldn’t be able to make sense of most of it anyway. But being open source, we can trust there’s hundreds of people out there who have and still are looking through the code and if they find anything worrying they will follow the standard disclosure procedures. This is impossible with the likes of Lastpass as their code is closed-source - we only ever find out about breaches months or years after they’ve happened!\n\nHaving also looked at Lastpass extensively, I would say that it is indeed more visually refined and it has a few more options that I would perhaps like to see in BW. It also has some others that I wouldn’t (e.g. the OTP for account recovery). Overall, I think I trust my passwords more with an open-source program that is being reviewed by tons of people and whose developer seems to be putting a lot of energy into, rather than a closed-source program that belongs to a billion-dollar corporation that has been compromised repeatedly.\n\nI may be a bit paranoid but doesn’t sound wrong when it comes to a security product.\n\nbillion-dollar corporation that has been compromised repeatedly\n\nwe can trust there’s hundreds of people out there who have and still are looking through the code and if they find anything worrying they will follow the standard disclosure procedures\n\nThis is just wishful thinking. Who are those hundreds of “nice” people? There may be hundreds who look at code for fun but are they going to spot corner case vulnerabilities?\n\nGlad Bitwarden took security audit but random people aren’t really fit for that role and corporation with serious money with more staff seems to have more eyes on securities than a product with 1 man behind it who’s usually focusing on the features and not the “boring” security part.\n\nI’m not dismissing Bitwarden but all I want to see is a clear display of what 8 bit solutions is and I think that’s the best Kyle can do.\n\nWorst case scenario, Kyle is hired by a large scam group and funded well and he’s tasked to make a trustworthy product for the first 5 years and then asked to plant backdoor later on to steal millions of password combinations and might blame for getting “hacked” if it gets spotted. That’s why having no good visibility on the company presence doesn’t look good (to me at least), so one can hide away easily when things don’t look good.\n\nI think the risk analysis needed here is:\n\nLikelihood you are using the same weak password on every site with the same email as your username.\n\nLikelihood that Kyle is a secret agent spy with plans to steal all our secrets with malware someday once we’re all lulled into a sense of security.\n\nI personally think 1 for me is fairly high if I couldn’t use a password manager… though I’d hope the passwords weren’t weak and I’d at least try to salt the password with some deterministic info from the website… but yeah, it’d prolly be weak sauce.\n\nI personally think 2 is a fairly low probability. In general, I think that single devs who live eat and breath security software tend to be better at opsec than “bob that was hired at logmein to man up the mobile app deploy division of LastPass. Fresh out of coding boot camp.”\n\nBut hey, that’s just my assessment… I think 1 is 99.9999999% for most normal people, which is why I recommend Bitwarden even if there’s a 0.0000001% chance for 2 in my eyes."
