The actual company / product is irrelevant. Sounds to me like you'll get no help from them.\n\nYou have to go it on your own, and see how it goes. Use whatever package development product you have and see how far you get. If you hit a roadblock, post what package development product you're using and the details of your roadblock (error, what doesn't work, funky occurances, etc). Someone here will probably be able to help you out.\n\nFinally, when you get it working, help everyone out by posting the details of your experience in the AppDeploy Package Knowledgebase."
