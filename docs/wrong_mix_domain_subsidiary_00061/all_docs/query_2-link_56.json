        "text": "Open the \"Run\" Command on the Start Menu, type \"msconfig\" (w/o the quotes), and go to the \"Startup\" tab. Check for any Java related programs starting when the computer boots. Then uncheck it, click OK, and reboot the computer...\n\nIf that doesn't work, open the \"Run\" command again, type services.msc, and look for any Java related services, especially a Java Service with the word 'update' or 'automatic' in it...Then right-click it, select properties, and disable the service...click OK, and you're done...Hope this helps!\n\nworst case scenario, but this is not recommended: Disable UAC...\n\nRefer to the following answer at Server Fault - Can’t seem to disable Java Automatic Update:\n\nActually this problem is due to the control panel requiring Admin Privileges to allow the java control panel to save your settings (hasn't been fixed for ages, thanks to sun micro).\n\nBasically find the java control panel javacpl.exe here:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\javacpl.exe\n\n...right click > run with admin privileges.\n\nUncheck java update, save and then reopen it to check that the setting is sticking.\n\nMy added tip: Windows Vista x64 or Windows 7 x64 users should instead look for:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\javacpl.exe\n\nUpdate: For Java 7 (32-bit), look instead for:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7\\bin\\javacpl.exe .. and yes, Java 7 still has this problem – after all these years they didn't fix it to work properly, so this workaround is still required.\n\nJUCheck was designed for computers with a single user who is an administrator. For those of us with computers that have multiple users where not all of them are administrators, then your simplest option is to rename jucheck.exe\n\nYou could also stop JUCheck from running on start up by using msconfig, following the solution provided by studiohack. To do this on Windows 8, log on as a user with admin rights and press CTRL-ALT-DEL and click on Task Manager. Select the Startup tab and right click Java(TM) Update Scheduler and click Disable.\n\nMy preferred solution is not to install the JUCheck component in the first place. It also makes the Update tab of the Java Control Panel disappear cleanly. This is a good approach if you manage hundreds or thousands of computers. Rather than have each computer downloading the update you can download it just once and then distribute it in a controlled manner after testing it with your line of business apps.\n\nDownload the offline installer (http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)\n\nLog on as an administrator and run the offline installer and make a copy the jre1.X.X_XX.msi and Data1.cab files from the AppData folder\n\nfor Windows 8 the path is C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Sun\\Java\n\nCancel the offline installer and instead start the install with the command\n\nmsiexec /i jre1.X.X_XX.msi JAVAUPDATE=0\n\nIf you don't check for updates you may miss out on security updates which would be a bad thing. In my opinion, advice to disable the feature is highly irresponsible. I would personally recommend switching it to check more often. – Tom Hawtin - tackline Jun 12 '10 at 14:24\n\nIt may come as no surprise that Tom is an engineer in Java SE security for Oracle Corporation UK. Any software that requires all users of a computer to have admin rights is \"in my opinion\" highly irresponsible.\n\nJust delete jucheck.exe and jusched.exe. Have you thought of this?\n\nOn Java Runtime Environment 1.6 versions newer than or equal to 1.6.0.21, go to %PROGRAMFILES%\\Common Files\\Java\\Java Update\\ or %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\Common Files\\Java\\Java Update\\, then delete/rename jucheck.exe and jusched.exe. The current 1.6.0.21 version changed the update executable locations, according to http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html?threadID=401634.\n\nOn Java Runtime Environment 1.6 versions older than 1.6.0.21, go to %PROGRAMFILES%\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\ and %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\, then delete/rename jucheck.exe and jusched.exe.\n\nIf you have any Adobe products installed, you might want to check for more JRE locations. For example, when Adobe Creative Suite 5 is installed, it automatically installs old versions of JRE into these locations:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Adobe Dreamweaver CS5\\JVM\\bin\\\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\CS5\\jre\\bin\\\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Adobe Flash Builder 4\\jre\\bin\\\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Adobe Flash Catalyst CS5\\jre\\bin\\\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Acrobat 9.0\\Designer 8.2\\jre\\bin\\\n\nFor each location above, delete/rename jucheck.exe and jusched.exe.\n\nAdditionally, do a search for jucheck.exe and jusched.exe to find even more JRE locations!\n\nNext, in both %PROGRAMFILES%\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\ and %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\, right click on javacpl.exe and select \"Run as administrator\". Select the Update tab, and disable \"Check for Updates Automatically\", and select \"Never Check\" for the update interval. Then, go to the Advanced tab, under JRE Auto-Download, select \"Never Auto-Download\". Click apply and OK.\n\nStart > Run > msconfig, or use a different startup manager tool, then find and delete all instances of jucheck.exe and jusched.exe for each startup entry type.\n\nNext, create a registry file, Disable Java automatic updates.reg, with this inside:\n\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Java Update\\Policy] \"EnableJavaUpdate\"=dword:00000000 \"EnableAutoUpdateCheck\"=dword:00000000 \"NotifyDownload\"=dword:00000001 \"NotifyInstall\"=dword:00000001 \"PromptAutoUpdateCheck\"=- [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\JavaSoft\\Java Update\\Policy] \"EnableJavaUpdate\"=dword:00000000 \"EnableAutoUpdateCheck\"=dword:00000000 \"NotifyDownload\"=dword:00000001 \"NotifyInstall\"=dword:00000001 \"PromptAutoUpdateCheck\"=- [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Java Update\\Policy] \"EnableJavaUpdate\"=dword:00000000 \"EnableAutoUpdateCheck\"=dword:00000000 \"NotifyDownload\"=dword:00000001 \"NotifyInstall\"=dword:00000001 \"PromptAutoUpdateCheck\"=- [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\JavaSoft\\Java Update\\Policy] \"EnableJavaUpdate\"=dword:00000000 \"EnableAutoUpdateCheck\"=dword:00000000 \"NotifyDownload\"=dword:00000001 \"NotifyInstall\"=dword:00000001 \"PromptAutoUpdateCheck\"=-\n\nApply the registry file for all users, and constantly re-apply it every user logon for good measure.\n\nFinally, create a deployment settings file, and place it in %WINDIR%\\Sun\\Java\\Deployment\\, %PROGRAMFILES%\\Java\\jre6\\lib\\, and %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\Java\\jre6\\lib\\. Check out:\n\nhttp://www.appdeploy.com/messageboards/tm.asp?m=33488\n\nhttp://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/properties.html\n\nhttp://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/deployment/deployment-guide/properties.html.\n\nThat seems much more complex than earlier versions which just remembered!\n\nTo answer an earlier question - the reason that I want to disable it is because earlier versions weren't very good at uninstalling the previous version before installing the new one. That caused problems with some of the Java software we use at work - also, because work machines have a set version on, I want to ensure that my home pc has the same version - so if I develop stuff for students, it will work. (Some of the elearning software we use doesn't work with newer versions of Java).\n\nI'd rather manually check when I want to, then I can uninstall, download & reinstall.\n\nWere Java to say (as other software does) 'you've already got Java - shall I uninstall it, or do you want two versions' - then I'd let the autoupdate run. (I'd also quite like it if it remembered to ask me before downloading, rather than after. It used to remember these things.)\n\nIt seems as if Java is ignoring the settings on purpose (in javacpl.exe), but sometimes this is happening because there are more then one version of Java installed on the PC, so one must change the settings for every version separately.\n\nFor me the best way is to download Autoruns from Sysinternls and run it as Administrator. From there uncheck Java Updater. I would not do it through msconfig."
