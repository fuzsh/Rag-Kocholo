        "text": "Oracle Endeca Commerce 2.1.2\n\nIntroduction\n\nEndeca was founded on the simple idea that users want to explore data interactively in real time relying on a friendly, intuitive interface, regardless of the scale and complexity of the underlying data. Users need to search, navigate, and analyse all of their data, often in large and multiple data sources, “slicing and dicing” across any dimension, and drilling down to the finest grain of detail or zooming out to an aggregate view. At the same time, users need an application that responds intelligently to their current navigation state, guiding them along valid paths and eliminating invalid choices, or “dead ends.” Users should experience simple, intuitive navigation even as they perform the equivalent of extremely complex, multi-dimensional database intersection queries.\n\nOracle Endeca Commerce, based on the Endeca MDEX Engine, is a powerful technology designed to help you build intuitive Guided Navigation applications. Guided Navigation not only tells users the results of their query, it also tells them all the valid “next-step questions” they can ask to refine and explore further, while eliminating the frustrating reply of “No Results Found”. These next-steps are re-ranked and re-organized with each click, creating a much more productive and satisfying navigation experience for your users.\n\nOracle Endeca Commerce is comprised of three major components.\n\n• Endeca Information Transformation Layer (ITL)\n\n• Endeca MDEX Engine\n\n• Endeca Application Tier\n\nThe components interact with your data sources and application as shown in the figure:\n\nThe Endeca Information Transformation Layer (ITL) reads your raw source data and manipulates it into a set of Oracle Endeca MDEX Engine indices. The ITL consists of the Content Acquisition System (which includes the Endeca CAS Server and Console, the CAS API and the Endeca Web Crawler), and the Data Foundry (which includes data-manipulation programs such as Forge).The Endeca ITL components are run offline at intervals that are appropriate for your business requirements.\n\nThe Oracle Endeca MDEX Engine is the query engine that is the core of Oracle Endeca Commerce. The MDEX Engine consists of the Indexer (Dgidx), the Dgraph, and the Agraph. The MDEX Engine loads the indices generated by the indexing component of the Endeca Information Transformation Layer. Although the Indexer (also known as Dgidx) is installed as part of the MDEX Engine package, in effect it is part of the ITL process. After the indices are loaded, the MDEX Engine receives queries from the Endeca Application Tier, executes them against the loaded indices, and returns the results to the client application. The Application Tier provides an interface to the MDEX Engine via the Endeca Assembler. The Assembler acts as a language-agnostic interface for aggregating and sending queries to the MDEX Engine, and executing any necessary post-processing on the results. The Endeca MDEX Engine and Endeca Application Tier are both online processes, meaning they must remain running as long as you want clients to have access to your data set.\n\nInstalling Oracle Endeca Commerce and Deploying the WineApp Reference Application\n\nThis install is aimed at installing the Oracle endeca Commerce with all the required componnets and Deploying the WineApp Reference Application to examine a test data set in a full-featured application. We also aim at launching the mobile application for Endeca.\n\nInstallation packages for Endeca Web Commerce\n\nOracle Endeca Commerce Version 2.1.2 is made up of the installation packages listed below.\n\n• MDEX Engine 6.2.2.\n\n• Platform Services 6.1.3.\n\n• Experience Managaer 2.1.2.\n\n• Endeca Presentation API 6.2.2.\n\n• Contnet Assembler APIs for java 2.1.2.\n\n• Content Acquisition System (CAS) 3.0.2.\n\n• Deployment Template 3.2.2\n\n• Endeca for Mobile 1.2.2.\n\n• Endeca for Social 1.2.2.\n\n• Developer Studio 6.1.3. (Optional.)\n\nMDEX Engine overview\n\nThe Endeca MDEX Engine is the indexing and query engine that provides the backbone for all Endeca solutions.\n\nThe MDEX Engine uses proprietary data structures and algorithms that allow it to provide real-time\n\nresponses to client requests. The MDEX Engine stores the indices that were created by the Endeca\n\nInformation Transformation Layer (ITL). After the indices are stored, the MDEX Engine receives client requests via the application tier, queries the indices, and then returns the results.\n\nThe MDEX Engine is designed to be stateless. This design requires that a complete query be sent to\n\nthe MDEX Engine for each request. The stateless design of the MDEX Engine facilitates the addition\n\nof MDEX Engine servers for load balancing and redundancy. Because the MDEX Engine is stateless, any replica of an MDEX Engine on one server can reply to queries independently of a replica on other MDEX Engine servers.\n\nPlatform Services overview\n\nThe Endeca Platform Services package consists of a number of components that are used to build\n\nEndeca applications in support of the Endeca MDEX Engine.\n\nTwo of the major components of the Endeca Platform Services package are the Endeca Information\n\nTransformation Layer (which includes Forge and other Data Foundry components) and the Endeca\n\nApplication Controller (EAC).\n\nPresentation API overview\n\nThe Endeca Presentation API provides interfaces to the Endeca MDEX Engine and Log Server. The\n\nEndeca Presentation API must be installed on the machine that hosts the Web application server.\n\nThe Presentation API package includes the Java version of the API only (JAR files, Javadoc,\n\nand Installation and Release Notes file.)\n\nEndeca Workbench overview\n\nEndeca Workbench is a suite of tools that brings together best-in-class Web-site management\n\ncapabilities including merchandising, Content Spotlighting, search configuration, and usage reporting.\n\nIn addition to these powerful tools for business users, Endeca Workbench provides features for system administrators to configure the resources used by an Endeca implementation, monitor its status, start and stop system processes, and download an implementation’s instance configuration for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.\n\nThe Endeca Workbench package contains the following components:\n\n• Endeca Tools Service\n\n• The appropriate edition of Endeca Workbench for the product you purchased.\n\nIn addition, the installation includes a version of the Endeca JSP reference application, which serves\n\nas the default preview application in Endeca Workbench.\n\nAbout the Deployment Template\n\nThe Deployment Template provides a collection of operational components that serve as a starting\n\npoint for development and application deployment.\n\nThe template includes the complete directory structure required for deployment, including Endeca\n\nApplication Controller (EAC) scripts, configuration files, and batch files or shell scripts that wrap common script functionality.\n\nThe Deployment Template is the recommended method for building your application deployment\n\nenvironment.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nFor simplicity and ease of testing, the implementation is done on a single node.\n\nHost Name: atg.ibizsoft.com\n\nMachine: 192.455.23.61\n\nOS: Oracle Enterprise Linux 5.5 x86_64\n\nInstalling the MDEX Engine 6.2.2\n\nThe MDEX Engine software is distributed as a self-extracting TAR file and install script.\n\nOur Endeca Installation will be done under the installation target directory /d03/endeca.\n\n1.

By default, the 6.2 MDEX Engine will only accept queries sent using the 6.2.x version of the Presentation API.\n\nBut in our case, we are getting the error even though we are using Endeca Presentation API 6.2.2 and even after copying the required jar files from the PresentationAPI into the front-end application’s WEB-INF/lib sub-directory on the web application server (to avoid Navigation Errors in Workbench)\n\nSo, according to Metalink Doc ID 1399513.1, we opted to allow the dgraph to accept queries sent using older Presentation API versions by specifying the –back_compat flag in your MDEX Engine 6.2 dgraph flags.\n\nEnable –back_compat flag in dgraph options\n\nTo use the –back_compat flag, find the irversion value used by your current queries (e.g., 601,614) and add the flag with this value in your dgraph command-line arguments. The new setting will take effect the next time the dgraph is restarted.\n\nFor the example above, adding this flag and value…\n\n–back_compat 601\n\n…and then restarting the dgraph should resolve the ENEException issue in the above example.\n\nIf using the Deployment Template framework, add the –back_compat flag and its value as two separate <arg> elements (in order) within the <args> element for the <dgraph-defaults> component in the application’s config/script/AppConfig.xml file, along these lines:\n\n<args>\n\n[...]\n\n<arg>–back_compat</arg>\n\n<arg>601</arg>\n\n</args>\n\n? $ vi apps/ContentAssemblerRefApp/config/script/AppConfig.xml\n\n<arg>–back_compat</arg>\n\n<arg>614</arg>\n\n</dgraph-defaults>\n\n<args>\n\n<arg>–back_compat</arg>\n\n<arg>614</arg>\n\n</args>\n\n$\n\nOptionally edited these files also.\n\nContentAssemblerAPIs/Java/2.1.2/reference/pagebuilder_wine_app/script/AppConfig.xml\n\nEndeca/Solutions/deploymentTemplate-3.2.2/data/eac-java/dgraph/config/script/AppConfig.xml\n\nAgain, this change should take effect when the dgraph component is next restarted. You can also use the runcommand.sh (UNIX) or runcommand.bat (Windows) utility from the application’s control sub-directory to propagate the configuration change immediately (entailing an immediate restart in baseline-update order for all affected dgraphs) as follows…\n\n./runcommand.sh –update-definition\n\nThis should prevent the error.\n\n? $ cd /d03/endeca/apps/ContentAssemblerRefApp/control/\n\n$ ./runcommand.sh –update-definition\n\n[07.18.12 07:35:34] INFO: Checking definition from AppConfig.xml against existing EAC provisioning.\n\n[07.18.12 07:35:35] INFO: Updating definitions for dgraphs in restart group ‘A’.\n\n[07.18.12 07:35:35] INFO: Stopping component ‘Dgraph1′.\n\n[07.18.12 07:35:35] INFO: Updating definition for component ‘Dgraph1′.\n\n[07.18.12 07:35:36] INFO: [MDEXHost] Starting component ‘Dgraph1′.\n\n[07.18.12 07:35:42] INFO: Definition updated.\n\n$\n\n?
