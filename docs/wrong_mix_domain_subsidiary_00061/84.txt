Review Patch Documentation

When you install the application for the first time, you install either a base release (for example, 14.1) or a later patch release (for example, 14.1.1). If you are installing the base release or additional patch releases, read the documentation for all releases that have occurred since the base release before you begin installation. Documentation for patch releases can contain critical information related to the base release, as well as information about code changes since the base release.

Improved Process for Oracle Retail Documentation Corrections

To more quickly address critical corrections to Oracle Retail documentation content, Oracle Retail documentation may be republished whenever a critical correction is needed. For critical corrections, the republication of an Oracle Retail document may at times not be attached to a numbered software release; instead, the Oracle Retail document will simply be replaced on the Oracle Technology Network Web site, or, in the case of Data Models, to the applicable My Oracle Support Documentation container where they reside.

This process will prevent delays in making critical corrections available to customers. For the customer, it means that before you begin installation, you must verify that you have the most recent version of the Oracle Retail documentation set. Oracle Retail documentation is available on the Oracle Technology Network at the following URL:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/documentation/oracle-retail-100266.html

An updated version of the applicable Oracle Retail document is indicated by Oracle part number, as well as print date (month and year). An updated version uses the same part number, with a higher-numbered suffix. For example, part number E123456-02 is an updated version of a document with part number E123456-01.

If a more recent version of a document is available, that version supersedes all previous versions.

Oracle Retail Documentation on the Oracle Technology Network

Oracle Retail product documentation is available on the following web site:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/documentation/oracle-retail-100266.html

(Data Model documents are not available through Oracle Technology Network. You can obtain them through My Oracle Support.)

Preinstallation Tasks

This chapter includes steps to complete before installation.

Requesting Infrastructure Software

If you are unable to find the necessary version of the required Oracle infrastructure software (database server, application server, WebLogic, etc.) on the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud, you should file a non-technical Contact Us Service Request (SR) and request access to the media. For instructions on filing a non-technical SR, see My Oracle Support Note 1071023.1  Requesting Physical Shipment or Download URL for Software Media.

Installation Terminology

STAGING_DIR  It is the directory where the rwms14installer.zip is copied and extracted locally.

RETAIL_HOME  It is the directory where Database Files are stored, and Forms are installed. This will contain the orpatch directory as well.

Note: In previous 14.0.x releases, this directory was referred to as MMHOME.

§ Database RETAIL_HOME - The location where RWMS Database Files are stored. This location will be used during the subsequent patching of the RWMS.

§ Forms RETAIL_HOME - This is the Forms installation directory, the location where RWMS Forms are installed.

Note: A separate RETAIL_HOME is required for DB and Forms installations.

Check Supported Database Server Requirements

General Requirements for a database server running RWMS include the following.

Note: A working X-Server must be defined even when working with the text versions of the installer. It must be configured to accept XClients from the installation server in its access control list. Refer to XServer documentation for more information on using the xhost or equivalent commands.

Note: By default, JDK is at 1.6. After installing the 12.1.0.2 binary, apply patch 19623450. Then follow the instructions on Oracle Database Java Developers Guide 12c Release 1 to upgrade JDK to 1.7. The Guide is available here:

http://docs.oracle.com/database/121/JJDEV/chone.htm#JJDEV01000

Check Supported Application Server Requirements

General requirements for an application server capable of running RWMS include the following.

Check Supported Web Browser and Client Requirements

General requirements for client running RWMS include the following.

Supported Radio Frequency Device Requirements

Minimum requirements for radio frequency devices in order to run the RWMS application are:

§ Minimum RF Screen Sizes

§ Hand held: 240w x 320h pixels

§ Wrist mount: 320w x 240h pixels

§ Truck mount - half screen: 800w x 320h pixels

Software Required on Handhelds

§ Remote Desktop Client (aka Microsoft Terminal Services Client)

§ DataWedge (software provided by and maintained by Motorola for use with the barcode scanners)

Note: The requirements above are based on the testing that was done using the following:

§ RF devices running on Windows CE 5.0

o Motorola VC5090  (Truck Mount)

o Motorola WT4090  (Wrist mount)

o Symbol MC9090  (Hand Held)

o Motorola WT4070  (Wrist mount)

§ RF devices running on Windows CE 6.0:

o Honeywell Thor VM1D  (Truck Mount)

o Honeywell MX7T  (Hand Held)

UNIX User Account Privileges to Install the Software

A UNIX user account is needed to install the software. The UNIX user that is used to install the software should have write access to the WebLogic server installation files.

For example, oretail.

Note: Installation steps will fail when trying to modify files under the WebLogic installation, unless the user has write access.

The Oracle Retail Warehouse Management System has been validated to run in two configurations on Linux:

§ Standalone WLS and Database installations

§ Real Application Cluster Database and WebLogic Server Clustering

The Oracle Retail products have been validated against a 12.1.0.2 RAC database. When using a RAC database, all JDBC connections should be configured to use THIN connections rather than OCI connections. Forms connections will continue to use OCI connections.

Clustering for WebLogic Server 10.3.6 is managed as an Active-Active cluster accessed through a Load Balancer. Validation has been completed utilizing a RAC 12.1.0.2 Oracle Internet Directory database with the WebLogic 10.3.6 cluster. It is suggested that a Web Tier 11.1.1.7 installation be configured to reflect all application server installations if SSO will be utilized.

Database Installation Tasks  Full

This chapter describes the tasks required for a full database installation.

Note: If RWMS 14.1 software is already installed, please see Database Installation Tasks  Patch for information on Patching to RWMS 14.1.1.

If a database has been created for Oracle Retail Merchandising System (RMS) 14.1.1 and you would like the Retail Warehouse Management System (RWMS) to be in the same database, you can skip this step and advance to the Create the Schema Owner for RWMS section of this guide. However, if you want RWMS to reside in a dedicated database, follow the steps below to create a new one.

Create Staging Directory for RWMS Installer

To create the staging directory for RWMS installer, complete the following steps.

Note: The same installer can be used to install multiple RWMS components. If you are installing any of the RWMS components (Database, Application, Enhanced Dashboards and Navigation) on the same server, they can use the same installer and this step does not need to be repeated.

1. Log into the database server as a user that can connect to the RWMS database.

2.Create a staging directory for the RWMS installation software.

3.Copy the rwms14installer.zip file from the RWMS 14.1.1 release to the staging directory. This is referred to as STAGING_DIR when installing database software.

4.Change directories to STAGING_DIR and extract the rwms14installer.zip file. This creates an rwms/installer/ subdirectory under STAGING_DIR.

Create the RWMS Database

It is assumed that Oracle Enterprise Edition 12c Release 1, with all appropriate patches, has already been installed. If not, see Check Supported Database Server Requirements in Chapter 1 before proceeding. Additionally, STAGING_DIR in this section refers to the directory created in the steps for Create Staging Directory for RWMS Installer in Chapter 1.

If a database has already been created, it is necessary to review the contents of this section to determine if all database components have been installed and configured properly. See also Appendix A: Oracle Database 12cR1 Parameter File.

If a database instance has not been created, create one using database creation templates via DBCA in silent mode.

Create the Database Instance Using the Oracle Generic Template

Prerequisites

§ The 12.1.0.2 binary must have already been installed. Refer to the Database Server Preinstallation section for all the required oneoff patches.

Background

As of 14.1.1, Oracle Retail no longer delivers custom database template files. Instead, databases can be created using the generic, Oracle-delivered templates located in the $ORACLE_HOME/assistants/dbca/templates directory.

$ /<ORACLE_HOME>/assistants/dbca/templates>

--> ls -l General_Purpose.dbc

-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle rgbudba 4908 May 24 2013 General_Purpose.dbc

Instance Creation Using the Generic Template via DBCA

1.Ensure ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_BASE is in the path:

$export ORACLE_HOME=<Oracle Home Location

$export ORACLE_BASE=<ORACLE BASE LOCATION>

$export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH

$ cd into $ORACLE_HOME/assistants/dbca/templates

2.Execute the following command to create an instance:

$ORACLE_HOME/bin/dbca -silent -createDatabase -templateName General_Purpose.dbc -gdbName DB_NAME -sid DB_SID -createAsContainerDatabase true -SysPassword oracle1 -SystemPassword oracle1 -emConfiguration NONE -datafileDestination /u02/oradata -characterSet AL32UTF8 -nationalCharacterSet AL16UTF16 -redoLogFileSize 100 -initParams nls_date_format=DD-MON-RR,nls_language=AMERICAN,nls_calendar=GREGORIAN,fast_start_mttr_target=900

The above will create a container database using all the default parameters set by dbca. Please replace the pfile by taking a copy from Appendix A but customize the values according to the need of your environment.

If you wish to create a non-container database, replace [-createAsContainerDatabase true] to [-createAsContainerDatabase false].

3.Execute the following commands to create a pluggable database if this is a container environment.

CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB_NAME ADMIN USER PDBADMIN

IDENTIFIED BY pdbadmin_pwd ROLES=(CONNECT) file_name_convert=('/u02/oradata/cdb_name/pdbseed','/u02/oradata/pdb_name');

alter pluggable database pdb_name open;

alter system register;

4.Post Database Creation Setup

The above commands create a database with all files in one directory, ie, /u02. Please multiplex the redo logs and the controlfiles following the OFA architecture.

5.Configure the listener and the tnsnames entry.

6.Log into the pluggable database to create the required tablespaces accordingly. For non-container databases, log into the database as normal to create the tablespaces.

Create the required RWMS Tablespaces

Release 14.1.1 uses table spaces RETAIL_DATA, RETAIL_INDEX, ENCRYPTED_RETAIL_DATA and ENCRYPTED_RETAIL_INDEX.

Note: If you have created tablespaces during the implementation or upgrade of the Retail Merchandising System 14.1.1, you are no longer required to create another set of tablespaces for the Warehouse Management System as they use the same ones.

The ENCRYPTED_RETAIL_DATA and ENCRYPTED_RETAIL_INDEX tablespaces hold data which may include Personally Identifiable Information data (PII Data). If you hold an Advanced Security Option license, you can choose to create these two tablespaces with TDE tablespace encryption to protect the PII data at rest. If you do not hold an Advanced Security Option license, you can create the tablespaces as normal tablespaces. The tablespace names must always be ENCRYPTED_RETAIL_DATA and ENCRYPTED_RETAIL_INDEX regardless of whether TDE encryption is used, because the table and index creation scripts look for these specific names.

1.Modify STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer/create_db/create_wms_tablespaces.sql. The table below shows the default initial sizes.

2.Once this script has been modified, execute it in SQL*Plus as sys.

3.Review create_wms_tablespaces.log for errors and correct as needed.

4.If you do not wish to use TDE tablespace encryption:

a.Modify STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer/create_db/create_encrypted_tablespaces_no_TDE.sql.

b.Run the script using SQL*Plus as sys.

c.Review Create_encrypted_retail_tablespaces_no_TDE.log for errors and correct as needed.

5.If you hold an Advanced Security Option license and wish to use TDE tablespace encryption:

a.Modify STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer/create_db/create_encrypted_tablespaces_TDE.sql.

b.Run the script using SQL*Plus as sys.

c.Review Create_encrypted_retail_tablespaces_TDE.log for errors and correct as needed.

d.Refer to Appendix: Tablespace Creation Scripts for details about how to create tablespaces in an encrypted format.

The standard tablespace scripts contain the DDL for creating the required tablespaces which can extend up to the following sizes:

TABLESPACE_NAME

SIZE

ENCRYPTED_RETAIL_INDEX

12G

ENCRYPTED_RETAIL_DATA

10G

RETAIL_INDEX

10G

RETAIL_DATA

8G

LOB_DATA

2G

USERS

2G

These sizes are sufficient for the initial installation of RWMS database objects. Although using the initial values is not recommended for a production environment, it is possible to use them for the purpose of creating a small test environment. For additional assistance with production database sizing, contact Oracle Retail Services.

Create the Schema Owner for RWMS

Create an Oracle schema that will own the RWMS application. Also, create RWMS ADF and RUNTIME users. Refer to the section below.

Note: The RWMS schema owner and rwms_adf_user must be created prior to running the RWMS database schema installation. The installer will validate theses users before proceeding with installation.

1. Change directories to STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer/create_db.

2.The create_user script relies on an empty role, developer, being created. Log into sqlplus as sysdba,connect to the respective PDB and run the following command to create that role:

SQL> create role developer;

3.Enter the following command to create the schema owner:

SQL> @create_user.sql

The following prompts will appear:

§ Schema Owner  the Oracle user that will own all RWMS objects. Referred to in this document as RWMS14DEV.

§ Password  the password associate with RWMS14DEV.

§ Temp Tablespace  the temporary tablespace for RWMS14DEV.

4.Check the log file create_<Schema_Owner>.lst for any errors. This log file should be removed to prevent the password from being compromised.

5.Create rwms_adf_user. Use the below script to create rwms_adf_user

SQL> @create_rwms_adf_user.sql

§ Password  enter the password for the user rwms_adf_user

§ Temp Tablespace  the temporary tablespace for the user

6.Create runtime user and role. Use the below script to create runtime user and the role.

SQL >@create_runtime_user_role.sql

§ runtime_user  enter the database user name for running RWMS application

§ runtime_password  enter the password for the user

§ Temp Tablespace  the temporary tablespace for the user

Run the RWMS Database Schema Installation

To run the RWMS database schema installation, complete the following steps.

Note: See Appendix: RWMS Database Schema Installation Screens for details on the RWMS Database Schema installation screens and fields in the installer.

1. Change directories to STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer.

2.Source the oraenv script to set up the Oracle environment variables (ORACLE_HOME, ORACLE_SID, PATH, etc)

Example: prompt$ . oraenv

ORACLE_SID = [] ? mydb

prompt$

Verify the ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_SID variables after running this script.

Example: prompt$ echo $ORACLE_HOME

/u00/oracle/product/mydbversion

prompt$ echo $ORACLE_SID

mydb

3.Set and export the following environment variables. These variables are needed in addition to the environment variables set by the oraenv script above.

4.If you are going to run the installer in GUI mode using an X server, you need to have the XTEST extension enabled. This setting is not always enabled by default in your X server. See Appendix: Common Installation Errors for more details.

5.If the installer has already been run in this location you may wish to back up the ant.install.properties file.

6.Run the install.sh script to start the installer.

Note: Below are the usage details for install.sh. The typical usage for GUI mode is no arguments.

./install.sh [text | silent]

7.Verify that the installer reports SUCCESS for the Database Preinstall Check. If it reports FAILED, verify that your environment variables are set properly.

8.Check the Install Database Objects checkbox and continue with installer.

9.After the installer is complete, you can check its log file: STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer/logs/rwms-install.<timestamp>.log.

Note: The installer leaves behind the ant.install.properties file for future reference and repeat installations. This file contains inputs you provided. As a security precaution, make sure that the file has restrictive permissions.

chmod 600 ant.install.properties

10.After the database installation is completed, run the base_dms_user.sql script to create the super user required to log in to the RWMS application.

§ Change directories to STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer/rwms14/Install_Data/Source

§ Log in to the database as the RWMS schema owner

§ SQL> @base_dms_user.sql

Example:

*************************************************************************************

If User Already Exists in the Facility, New Password Entered below will be updated

*************************************************************************************

Please enter the Superuser name for RWMS: PAR3214

Please enter the Superuser User Id for RWMS: PAR3214

Please enter the Superuser password: <retail>

Database Installation Tasks  Patch

The RWMS 14.1.1 installer may be used to apply the RWMS patch. Before you apply the RWMS 14.1.1 patch:

§ Make a backup of all your objects and database schema.

§ Review the RWMS 14.1.1 Release Notes.

§ Review each of the enclosed defect documents.

§ Check if RWMS is installed at 14.1 level

§ Check Supported Database Server Requirements in Chapter 1, Preinstallation Tasks

Create Staging Directory for RWMS Installer

To create the staging directory for RWMS installer, complete the following steps.

Note: The same installer can be used to patch multiple RWMS components. If you are installing any of the RWMS components (Database, Application, and Enhanced Navigation and Dashboards) on the same server as the same user, they can use the same installer and this step does not need to be repeated.

1. Log into the database server as a user that can connect to the RWMS database.

2.Create a staging directory for the RWMS installation software.

3.Copy the rwms14installer.zip file from the RWMS 14.1.1 release to the staging directory. This is referred to as STAGING_DIR when installing database software.

4.Change directories to STAGING_DIR and extract the rwms14installer.zip file. This creates an rwms/installer/ subdirectory under STAGING_DIR.

(Optional) Analyze Changes in the Patch

Note: See Appendix: RWMS Analyze Tool for details and instructions to run the RWMS Analyze Tool. This appendix also contains screens and fields in the tool.

Run the RWMS Database Schema Installation

To run the RWMS database schema installation, complete the following steps.

Note: See Appendix: RWMS Database Schema Installation Screens for details on the RWMS Database Schema installation screens and fields in the installer.

1. Change directories to STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer.

2.Source the oraenv script to set up the Oracle environment variables (ORACLE_HOME, ORACLE_SID, PATH, etc).

Example: prompt$ . oraenv

ORACLE_SID = [] ? mydb

prompt$

Verify the ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_SID variables after running this script.

Example: prompt$ echo $ORACLE_HOME

/u00/oracle/product/mydbversion

prompt$ echo $ORACLE_SID

mydb

3.Set and export the following environment variables. These variables are needed in addition to the environment variables set by the oraenv script above.

4.If you are going to run the installer in GUI mode using an X server, you need to have the XTEST extension enabled. This setting is not always enabled by default in your X server. See Appendix: Common Installation Errors for more details.

5.If the installer has already been run in this location you may wish to back up the ant.install.properties file.

6.Run the install.sh script to start the installer.

Note: Below are the usage details for install.sh. The typical usage for GUI mode is no arguments.

./install.sh [text | silent]

Note: For upgrade, ensure the schema names are entered same as that in the previous installations since wallet alias is case sensitive.

For the wallet alias used during previous installation, refer the wallet location in $RETAIL_HOME/orpatch/rwms_wallet

7.Verify that the installer reports SUCCESS for the Database Preinstall Check. If it reports FAILED, verify that your environment variables are set properly.

8.Check the Install Database Objects checkbox and continue with installer.

9.On the RETAIL_HOME screen, select the RETAIL_HOME of your previous installation.

10.On the Wallet password screen, enter the wallet password you used in the previous installation.

11.After the installer is complete, you can check its log file: STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer/logs/rwms-install.<timestamp>.log.

Note: The installer leaves behind the ant.install.properties file for future reference and repeat installations. This file contains inputs you provided. As a security precaution, make sure that the file has restrictive permissions.

chmod 600 ant.install.properties

It is assumed that WebLogic 11g version 10.3.6 (WLS) with Forms 11.1.2.2 has already been installed. If not, refer to Check Application Server Requirements in Chapter 1, Preinstallation Tasks before proceeding.

The application installer will install and compile the various Forms dependencies and validate them against the RWMS Database Schema installation performed in the previous chapter. Installation of BI Publisher server components are covered in Chapter 6.

Note: The guide does not make recommendations about the clustering or high availability configurations for WebLogic as these will largely be dependent on your fault-tolerance and scalability requirements.

Note: $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora file must be configured in this WebLogic installation. Forms and reports use this information for connectivity.

A copy tnsnames.ora file must be created for the $ORACLE_INSTANCE/config location. If the file is not copied to this location, forms will not compile correctly. See Appendix: Tablespace Creation Script B for an example setup of the tnsnames.ora file.

Note: It is necessary to create Domain directory under WEBLOGIC_HOME/user_projects/domains/. If this is not where it is located, the installer will not be able to copy the files from the post directory over to the WebLogic Domain and this should be done manually.

Create Staging Directory for RWMS Installer

To create the staging directory for the RWMS Installer, complete the following steps.

Note: The same installer can be used to install multiple RWMS components. If you are installing any of the RWMS components (Database, Application, Enhanced Dashboards and Navigation) on the same server, they can use the same installer and this step does not need to be repeated.

1. Log into the application server as a user with read and write access to the WebLogic files.

2.Create a staging directory for the RWMS installation software.

3.Copy the file rwms14installer.zip from the RWMS 14.1.1 release to the staging directory. This will be referred to as STAGING_DIR when installing application software and reports.

4.Change directories to STAGING_DIR and extract the file rwms14installer.zip. This will create an rwms/installer subdirectory under STAGING_DIR.

Prepare Application Server for RWMS

To prepare the application server for RWMS, complete the following steps.

Note: ORACLE_HOME is the location where Oracle Forms 11gR2 has been installed.

ORACLE_INSTANCE is the instance that is created during installation of Oracle Forms 11gR2 and contains the executables to compile forms.

1.The T2kMotif.rgb file that is sent out with WebLogic (10.3.6) must be modified. It is located at the following location:

<ORACLE_INSTANCE>/config/FRComponent/frcommon/guicommon/tk/admin

2.Make a copy of the file Tk2Motif.rgb, and name it Tk2Motif.rgb_ORIG (for example) as a backup.

3.Modify the file Tk2Motif.rgb file so that it contains the following line:

Tk2Motif*fontMapCs: iso8859-2=AL32UTF8

4.Copy <ORACLE_INSTANCE>/config/FRComponent/frcommon/guicommon/tk/admin/Tk2Motif.rgb to <ORACLE_HOME>/guicommon/tk/admin/Tk2Motif.rgb.

Install RWMS Oracle Forms

To install RWMS Oracle forms, complete the following steps:

Note: See Appendix: RWMS Application (forms) Installation Screens for details about the RWMS Forms application screens and fields in the installer.

1. Log on to your application server as the user that has write access to WebLogic.

2.Change directories to STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer. Set and export the following environment variables.

3.Run the install.sh script to start the installer.

Note: Below are the usage details for install.sh. The typical usage for GUI mode is no arguments.

./install.sh

Depending on system resources, a typical installation takes anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours.

The installer asks for an installation directory. This is the destination directory for the RWMS files. This directory will be referred to as RETAIL_HOME for the remainder of this chapter. Do not provide a RETAIL_HOME that is located at or underneath STAGING_DIR.

4.After the installation is complete, you can check its log file: STAGING_DIR/rwms/installer/logs/rwms-install.<timestamp>.log. The directory RETAIL_HOME/orpatch/logs/detail_logs/oraforms_rwms/ will contain log files for specific forms, with information about possible failed compilations.

5.The installer leaves behind the ant.install.properties file for future reference and repeat installations. This file contains inputs you provided. As a security precaution, make sure that the file has restrictive permissions.

Example:

chmod 600 ant.install.properties

6.If during the screens you chose not to have the installer automatically configure WebLogic, after the installation is complete the files that would have been updated by the installer will be located in a directory and will have to manually be moved to correct directories as specified by the installer output like the example below.

Example:

#######################################################################

Weblogic Configuration Tasks

#######################################################################

Contact your Weblogic administrator and have them make backups of the following files:

/u00/webadmin/product/wls_retail/user_projects/domains/ClassicDomain/config/fmwconfig/servers/WLS_FORMS/applications/formsapp_11.1.2/config/forms/registry/oracle/forms/registry/Registry.dat

/u00/webadmin/product/wls_retail/user_projects/domains/ClassicDomain/config/fmwconfig/servers/WLS_FORMS/applications/formsapp_11.1.2/config/formsweb.cfg

Have the Weblogic administrator stop WLS_FORMS,

copy everything in /u00/oretail/rwms14.1.1/tst/post

to /u00/webadmin/product/wls_retail to update the files

and then start WLS_FORMS

for the changes to take effect.

example: cp -R * /u00/webadmin/product/wls_retail

The Enhanced Navigation and Dashboard of RWMS provides a more modern web application GUI to the product that runs the RWMS Oracle forms. Along with a rich web design, the Enhanced Navigation and Dashboard brings with it new navigation features, search mechanisms, easy-to-use favorites.

Before proceeding, you must install Oracle WebLogic Server 11g Release 1 (10.3.6). The Enhanced Navigation and Dashboards application is deployed to a WebLogic Managed server within the WebLogic installation. It is assumed Oracle Database has already been configured and loaded with the appropriate Oracle Retail Warehouse Management System schemas for your installation. ADF 11.1.1.7 should also be installed on the WebLogic installation. Additionally, STAGING_DIR in this section refers to the directory created in Create Staging Directory for RWMS Application Files in Chapter 1.

Installing a separate domain is recommended. It can be called RWMSDomain (or something similar) and will be used to install the managed server. The ADF libraries should be extended to this domain and the Enterprise Manager should be deployed.

You can create a new WebLogic server and install ADF libraries on it or create a WebLogic domain on the WebLogic server that has the ClassicDomain deployed

Installing the RWMS BI Publisher Templates

In this section we have outlined how the RWMS report templates are installed into the appropriate BI server repositories. RWMS requires two sub directories to be created within the path indicated by <BI_REPOSITORY>.

Report files are placed by the installer in the directory, RETAIL_HOME/reports, and must be copied into the newly created BI server repository directory.

1.Change directory to the <RETAIL_HOME>/reports used for the application install. This directory contains a RWMS directory with RWMS REPOSITORY and RWMS SYSTEM REPOSITORY subdirectories. These two directories contain reports directories whose names reflect the names of report templates provided with RWMS.

2.Copy the RWMS directory and all of its subdirectories to <BI_REPOSITORY>/Reports/Guest. This will copy over the RWMS REPOSITORY and RWMS SYSTEM REPOSITORY directories according to the following table paths.

Example:

cp -R RWMS " /u00/webadmin/product/fmw/wls_obiee/user_projects/domains/bifoundation_domain/config/bipublisher/repository/Guest/ "

Configuring Forms to use BI Publisher

This section provides information about how to configure forms for BI.

Check the Configuration of formsweb.cfg

The formsweb.cfg file is modified by the application installer to add the appropriate entries for the RWMS Forms configurations. Please validate the file to ensure that the following items have been updated accordingly by the installer. In italics and highlighted are post installation configuration changes.

The file is typically found within the WebLogic domain configuration folder in the subdirectory <DOMAIN_HOME>/config/fmwconfig/servers/WLS_FORMS/applications/formsapp_11.1.2 /config directory and is named from the <INSTALLATION_NAME> value.

For example:

/u00/webadmin/product/wls_forms/user_projects/domains/ClassicDomain/config/fmwconfig/servers/WLS_FORMS/applications/formsapp_11.1.2/config/

The following is a sample of URL definitions that were created by the installer from the formsweb.cfg file.

Note: The installer inserts a splashScreen= line at three locations in the formsweb.cfg file. Having these lines in the formsweb.cfg file may sometimes cause issues and should be commented out (#splashScreen=false).

Configuring the Forms Installation Environment Files

This section outlines the entries that need to be updated in the <INSTALLATION_NAME>.env file. Please validate the file to ensure that the following items have been updated accordingly. The file is typically found within the WebLogic domain configuration folder in the subdirectory <DOMAIN_HOME>/config/fmwconfig/servers/WLS_FORMS/applications/formsapp_11.1.2 /config directory and is named from the <INSTALLATION_NAME> value. For example:

/u00/webadmin/product/wls_forms/user_projects/domains/ClassicDomain/config/fmwconfig/servers/WLS_FORMS/applications/formsapp_11.1.2/config/

The following are an explanation of some variables that will be added to the <rwms_instalation_name>.env (Example: rwms14inst.env) file by the rwms installer.

The following is an example of the entries used for a working <INSTALLATION_NAME>.env file:

RWMS Wallet Configurations

The RWMS application is comprised of several entities that require logon credentials to be passed back and forth. These credentials are kept secure by the use of several different types of wallets. The reason that multiple wallets are required is that the some of the RWMS entities are from different tech stacks. The RWMS application needs to allow ADF, Oracle Forms, BIPublisher, and batch script interfaces to be able to communicate. Below is a summary of each type of wallet that is utilized and how it works in the application.

Application (Java) Wallet

Note: This wallet must be created manually. The installer does not create it.

§ Its purpose is to provide credentials for the RWMS application to be able to print reports via web service connections to in BI Publisher.

§ This wallet is not setup by RWMS installer.

§ See Setting up Application (Java) Wallet for RWMS .env File for instructions on how to set this up.

§ Used to store values for the variables setup in the RWMS forms .env file.

 RWMS_WALLET_PATH:

 By default the RWMS installer creates this entry in the .env file, but does not actually create the wallet.

 The path here should be set to the location where the wallet will reside once it is created. The location is a suggested location, but can actually reside anywhere on the file system that the RWMS application has access to.

 RWMS_WALLET_PARTITION:

 By default the RWMS installer creates this entry in the .env file, but does not actually create the wallet entry.

 This value is the partition of the wallet that is used to look up the credentials.

 RWMS_WALLET_LOGON:

 By default the RWMS installer creates this entry in the .env file as TRUE.

 This value tells the RWMS application whether or not to consider the variables

 Setting this to FALSE, commenting it out, or deleting the entry will be accepted as a FALSE value by the application and will result in RWMS application considering credential variables as clear text.

 RWMS_BI_USER:

 No alias for this variable is stored in the wallet. The application uses the RWMS_BI_PWD for this purpose.

 Used to store a BI Publisher username credential for RWMS application to access BI Publisher reports via web services.

 Only used in when RWMS_WALLET _LOGON is set to FALSE and will be in clear text.

 RWMS_BI_PWD:

 By default the RWMS installer creates this entry in the .env file, but does not actually create the wallet entry.

 The variable value is an alias that access the credentials used to log into BI Publisher in order to print reports from the application.

 When RWMS_WALLET _LOGON is set to FALSE  this value should be clear text in the .env file.

 RWMS_DB_CONNECT:

 By default the RWMS installer creates this entry in the .env file, but does not actually create the wallet entry.

 The variable value is an alias that access the credentials used to create a connection to the database by the purge_cont_labels_to_print_b.sh batch script. It is used to clean up the cont_labels_to_print table after labels are printed from the RWMS application.

 When RWMS_WALLET _LOGON is set to FALSE  this value should be clear text in the .env file.

Oracle Wallet

§ Its purpose is to provide a secure connection string for RWMS in the formsweb.cfg file for automatic forms launching, and executing batch programs via command line or daemon processes.

§ This wallet is setup by RWMS installer.

§ See Appendix: Setting Up an Oracle Wallet for instructions on how to set this up.

WLS Database Credential Store

§ Its purpose is to provide secure credentials to the file system so that the RWMS application can access and write log files.

§ This wallet is setup by RWMS installer.

§ See Setting Up WLS Database Credential Store for instructions on how to set this up or maintain it outside the RWMS installer.

§ It is used by the Manual Script Launch Editor which uses the application.properties to acquire credentials for a
