Maxis was acquired by Electronic Arts in a US $125 million dollar stock transaction. The company is considered a fully-owned subsidiary of EA.

EA appointed 35-year-old French engineer Luc Barthelet as General Manager of Maxis.

The company moved from its Orinda, California, offices into the sixth floor of a corporate office-tower in Walnut Creek, California. In June, Maxis "went public" on the stock exchange.
