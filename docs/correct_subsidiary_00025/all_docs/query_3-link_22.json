CordenPharma is a CDMO partner supporting biotech and pharma innovators of complex modalities in advancing their drug development lifecycle. Supported by Astorg since its acquisition in 2022, CordenPharma has strongly accelerated its transformation and is committed to pursuing its ambitious growth plans aiming to reach ~€1bn sales mark for its pioneering Peptide Platform, and ~€1.8bn total group revenue by 2028. This expansion will meet the pharmaceutical industry’s most stringent quality and technical standards for short and long peptide manufacturing, including BLA requirements, and will help to strengthen CordenPharma's market leadership position. 🎙 Judith Charpentier, Co-Head of Astorg's Flagship Fund & Head of Healthcare: “CordenPharma has a unique opportunity to reinforce its leadership position in peptides with unmatched capacity and performance in large scale manufacturing. With the company’s proven track record and our investor experience in pharmaceutical services, we feel confident that our latest commitment will help the company seize this opportunity.” Congratulations to Michael Quirmbach and the entire CordenParma’s team! 👇 Read more about CordenPharma’s transformational peptide platform expansion by clicking the link below. #PrivateEquity #Growth #Healthcare #CDMO #Peptides #Pharmaceutical #Innovation Dr. Signe Michel Antoine Thomas Olivier Gourgue Michael Quirmbach Brian McCudden\n\n📣 𝗔𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗴 𝗣𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗼 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗡𝗲𝘄𝘀 Astorg is pleased to announce the 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 Normec 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 €𝟭.𝟰𝗯𝗻 in partnership with CVC Capital Partners, Pantheon, Lexington Partners and Eurazeo alongside a diverse group of additional investors, including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, asset managers, and family offices.
