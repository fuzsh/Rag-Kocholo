EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Maxis is Malaysia's leading telecommunications company and market leader with a total mobile phone subscriber base of more than seven million , as at 31 December 2005. Maxis continues to enhance how people communicate and live with an impressive array of innovative products and services. Surpassing the seventh million mark has become a milestone in our list of achievements. Maxis ’ expansion into Indonesia and India is another milestone in our aspiration to be a regional communications operator. The acquisition of a 51% stake in PT Natrindo Telepon Seluler (NTS), Indonesia and a 74% equity interest in Aircel, India will provide tremendous growth opportunities for Maxis . These acquisitions give Maxis a strong foothold in two of the world’s most attractive high-growth, low-penetration markets , while diversifying our market base. Apart from that, Maxis was the first to launch 3G Connect Card, PC Webmail, Video Mail and 3G prepaid . They are having significantly increased the 3G service coverage since its launch in July 2005, catering to more than 740 sites across Malaysia. Their growing high-performance 3G network offers mobile telephony at broadband speeds enabling Internet access throughout Malaysia. Both mobile phone and laptop users can now enjoy enhanced communication combined with extensive entertainment and information on the go, such as video calls, live mobile TV, games and wireless broadband Internet with transfer speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second.

ABOUT THE COMPANY Maxis mobile service is offered on a postpaid basis under the Maxis brand and via a prepaid format under the Hotlink brand.

Culture – Corporate Social Responsibility Market share (2009) * Maxis -40% * Celcom – 34% * Digi -25% * U Mobile - 0.7%. Customer Analysis\n\n8. Collaborators Acquisition of a : 51% stake in PT Natrindo Telepon Seluler (NTS), Indonesia 74% equity interest in Aircel, India Competitor Analysis DIGI, high coverage of EDGE and more stable. Slow but stable at 384 Kbps or 48KBps. Cheap calls plan but bad coverage. CELCOM, best coverage in town with good speed but very expensive of RM98 per month of 3.6Mbps. Good for surfing but not download. Not worth for 5GB/month limitation. IZZI, network with stable and fast connection at least times of 1 Mbps (no heavy traffic during certain times). Only at selected network coverage area and sometimes do not get internet even at best coverage zone.\n\n9. DIGI vs MAXIS vs Celcom Postpaid Plan\n\n10. IV. MACRO-ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS (PEST) P olitical E conomy in 2008, the government announced all Telco users compulsory to register their SIM CARDS because there is a lot of crime happening through phone calls, text messages, and MMS. During economic downturn, a lot of employees were retrenched. Since unemployment rate is high , crime level in the country tend to increase. Due to this, the government started to recruit staff to work in the public sector . Mobile and internet is misuse to deliver political views . They also use mobile and internet to plan demonstration In 2009, the whole world was facing economic downturn . Malaysia was badly affected by this, but the way consumers behave showed that there is no effect on them. Internet and mobile technology has widely used in business to follow the economic situation\n\n11. S ocial T echnology Consumer’s tastes changes as they pay high price for quality product in terms of acquiring the latest technology plus good customer services. The latest social trend is people like to SMS more nowadays. With SMS consumers could convey their message in the cheapest way. The family structures in the recent day are couple like to have only 2-4 children’s only. Compare to the olden days couples would have 4-7 children’s. This would influence the pattern of mobile usage/users. Handphones and internet technology has became a trend in the new millennium Consumers tend to change just to use the latest mobile plans Nowadays top up for prepaid phones can be done through internet transaction. Payment could be done using kiosk machine which is situated at hot spots Improvement in communication technology. By using hand phone, users can call their friend and look at what they are doing via 3G . 3G enable users to view users from different places . If users were to use internet, they can do video calls . Users can surf internet to check mail, facebook, twitter , map (GPS). They even could check their account, bills and latest packages and plans online E-learning, nowadays studies is not necessary done at class room only. New improvement in technology has enable users to learn virtually . As long as the users can surf the internet user can study anywhere and anytime in the world.\n\n12. V. SWOT ANALYSIS S trengths W eaknesses Good network coverage around Malaysia Have strong brand image and as merge as the market leader in Malaysia Good deals and special offers for different age groups and also target groups The oldest and biggest in terms of size and technology . Provides reasonable plans and packages for all users Always the first to introduce new mobile plans All type of telecommunication and internet technology services. Interruption of the line at certain areas Bad customer services Deals and offers are limited to certain time and area only Users tend to switch to other telco with the existing number remains with no extra cost. Lack of MAXIS centers to enquire information or to pay bills. For broadband , speed is good during the first 7 days after activation , then the speed goes slower later on.\n\n13. O pportunities T hreats New technology is developing like mushrooms, so when there are new telecommunication gadgets, there will be opportunities to explore in. Growth of people using hand phones and internet services provides more market opportunities. Expanding their business to overseas Building more MAXIS centers especially suburban areas New events and occasions to be sponsored Growing market where many exiting telco company plus new emerging telco company are competing with MAXIS . Maxis customer switch to different telco in terms to enjoy the service and benefits by their competitor New rules stating that all the hand phone users must register their number to their own respected telco centre Financial crisis, economical issues or natural disaster\n\n14. ] VI.

And the limitation is that student cannot exceed 25 years old Percentage of sales Edge Financial Daily: Net profit - RM552 million first quarter ended March 31, 2010. Hotlink prepaid profit has decrease due to new low rate plan. The market share for maxis in the industry is 40.9 %. What they want Youngsters, prefer products cheaper price, once students register, the phone is activated for 4 years. If they don’t reload for a couple of months, the line won’t be barred unlike normal plans. Better Speed, Better Value\n\n15. MAXIS How they use product For prepaid users, they need to reload manually by getting it from the shop or online For postpaid users, they need to pay monthly where bills will be send to them Packages and Plans , depends on which package they choose and benefits they entitled too Maxis broadband , there are few packages with different Internet benefits Hotlink Youth Club , where student use them by showing student ID card How to reach them Advertisement on TV stations Facebook, twitter and youtube Phone, e-mail and snail mail Online advertisement MAXIS centers Price sensitivity Competition Based Pricing : For instance, Celcom first launch its SMS rate which was RM0.10. Thus maxis starts to reduce their SMS price rate to more cheaper RM0.05 Now lately RM0.01 per SMS. Another example if maxis come out with a new plan, immediately digi and celcom will launch a new plan of theirs.\n\n16. P RODUCT / P RICE VII. MARKETING MIX (4 P’S)\n\n18.
