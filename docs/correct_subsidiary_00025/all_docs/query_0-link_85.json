        "text": "Well my birthday rolled around and the in-laws decided to buy me a giftcard for EB Games. But I buy all of my games digitally. So I had to go down there and low and behold I had every game on their shelf…. except Sim City.\n\nSo it’s one of the most hotly anticipated games and one of the highest selling, so why not give it a try?\n\nThis is my review, of Sim City.\n\nBefore going into any depth I’d like to point out that I purchased the “Limited Edition.”\n\nThe Limited Edition offered this:\n\nIt is however limited in that it didn’t offer these:\n\nIn my days Limited Edition meant you gained limited benefits… not half of the game. But whatever we’re playing a $60 without the other $30 in optional micro transactions.\n\nThe Brief: SimCity\n\nIn 1989 simulation was all the buzz. It was felt that making reality playable on a computer in all of it’s annoyances with the highest amount of accuracy was\n\nSo everything in the gaming world was simulators.\n\nMicrosoft to this day is trying to build a flight simulator feeling that people just want to feel like what it is to fly a plane.\n\nSo when Maxis created their first simulator it should be no surprise how massive of a success it was.\n\nIt was called SimAnt. SimAnt was a game in which you uniquely would live the life of an ant and help manage a colony to victory. Since it was based on actual knowledge of ants it also happened to be an educational game.\n\nIt was here that Maxis first copyrighted the word “Sim” in front of an object as part of their official branding. Because of this no company would ever dare try to milk their fame and created a Sim based game.\n\nSo with the success of this small project Maxis rapidly grew and got to work on their next project, SimCity.\n\nThere were other city builders at the time. The magic of Maxis’ SimCity was that it was fully graphical… the standard at the time was to have a text only city. This innovation lead them to be the top city builder game on the market.\n\nMaxis’ approach to city building has been copied over and over and over.\n\nIt goes like this. You plant down building zones and contractors freely build there. The contractors upgrade the zones over time and business owners buy and use them. Natural disasters mean you stay glued to your screen because if you do not deal with them effectively your game can be over in a heart beat.\n\nThe formula is still the standard for successful city builders.\n\nSimCity hit hard times however. The release of SimCity2000 would be the last successful SimCity.\n\nIt was around this time that Electronic Arts acquired Maxis out right and started pumping out SimCity 3000 and SimCity 4. Both of these were considered to be ill-conceived flops.\n\nMaxis’ next franchise “The Sims” would be the top selling game between it’s launch in 2000 to 2012. It was a massive success and a very innovative game. The game showed the market that interaction will now be an important part of gaming. The waves that Maxis created with The Sims is continued to be felt today in all genres.\n\nSo when Maxis announced a 2013 launch of SimCity (no numbers) people were not all that excited. However leading up to launch day Maxis was showing more and more that this isn’t SimCity 4… it’s something much better.\n\nSynopsis\n\nHaving never played SimCity 3000, SimCity 4, or many other modern city builder games, there is not much for me to compare this to. I played SimCity and SimCity 2000.\n\nThis game however is like nothing I have ever seen.\n\nSo right off the bat having purchased a hard copy of the game I installed it and found I had to download a one hour patch for the game to be playable. On top of that it was pretty upsetting to see that EA decided to nickle and dime consumers by including three texture packages at $10 a pop.\n\nThe heroes and villains I received from buying a physical copy from EBGames got me two unique buildings, a heroes lair and a villain’s den which would deploy heroes who save lives and villain’s who cause disaster. It creates a scenario in which an evil professor is destroying the city and Maxisman has to stop them.\n\nMaxisman greatly plays up on the Superman stereotypes including your first objective of becoming a city… because Superman never goes to small towns and saves lives there.\n\nUpon opening the game you are forced into a tutorial of how things work. I was a little disappointed because I wanted to join on with a friend’s community. But having gone through the tutorial I could see how much the game evolved.\n\nWhat you’ll notice with SimCity is just how much information there is available to you. You can make decisions on services to add and cut entirely based on the information panels. It is all brilliantly laid out and most importantly, in places that make sense.\n\nYou’re first introduced to the utilities, garbage collection, power generation, and water. If any of these fall below desirable levels people will start to move out.\n\nYou’re introduced to the world view and how you can make deals for products between towns and cities.\n\nYou’re introduced to zoning. With zones if you lay zones on great roads you get expensive peoples move in, crappy roads and you get low income people move in. In my first play through I made the mistake of laying down a dirt road. I found out after two hours I would have to demolish this road in order to lay down the foundations of a vibrant city center…. full of strip clubs and pawn shops.\n\nThe game evolves over time adding in the ability to build new buildings slowly with real budgetary concerns.\n\nOne of the most important aspects to this game is missions. Civilians will randomly ask for things and missions will appear with money or building based rewards.\n\nStrengths\n\nSmooth Graphics\n\nEasy Interface\n\nDiverse World\n\nFrom the outside everything is present and obvious looking. However when you zoom in you can check out what sort of stores and shops have been setup. Maxis went at great depth to make sure that commercial and industrial zones offer great variety because after my third city with 75,000+ people… I have not seen a single copycat commercial shop name.\n\nThe interface is very easy to get and very reliable. This game makes most simulators seem silly considering how much info you get. You get a breakdown of all sources of revenue and all costs. This allows you to cut unnecessary costs or raise new capital through taxers. As well you get that option of issuing bonds…. or fun with longterm debt as I like to call it. The various options tracking quality of service were excellent with tones of people telling me it stunk when I needed to fix sewage.\n\nThe game presents 8 different types of randomized worlds. This means that after you feel like you are done with one type of world you can create another one. Each city will essentially take a different shape and size with the general rule being maintained that “a city expands away from industry.”\n\nWeaknesses\n\nBugs\n\nOrigin\n\nOn launch day the game was not operational for 3 days. After that a lot of features like leaderboards and always Online were also disabled. The game still has quite a few bugs and still needs some fine tuning. I will say even with all of the bugs it’s still the best simulator I’ve played since Anno 2070, however if you decide to purchase this game you just might have to deal with some early bugs. They are however fixing it faster than most developers do.\n\nAnother major problem with the title is that no matter what you have to install the Origin DRM-ware. I bought a physical copy and that changed nothing, I was still required to add it to an Origin account and spend about 3 hours downloading large chunks of the game. It’s as if the hard copy case I purchased was just a copy of Origin with a SimCity key in it.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nThe game has many strengths and few faults. Most of the faults of this game are related to it’s launch. For this reason I wouldn’t pick this game up until we’re into the April season.\n\nIt will keep you entertained for far longer than most games and if you have friends who play these simulators you will enjoy the multiplayer.\n\nIn its current state it is a pitiful game full of online related bugs.\n\nTroublmaker recommends: Worth Waiting For"
