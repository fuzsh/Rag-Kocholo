        "text": "Maxis Berhad has accumulated 6.29 B in total debt with debt to equity ratio (D/E) of 1.5, which is about average as compared to similar companies. Maxis Berhad has a current ratio of 0.51, indicating that it has a negative working capital and may not be able to pay financial obligations in time and when they become due. Debt can assist Maxis Berhad until it has trouble settling it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. So, Maxis Berhad's shareholders could walk away with nothing if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt. However, a more frequent occurrence is when companies like Maxis Berhad sell additional shares at bargain prices, diluting existing shareholders. Debt, in this case, can be an excellent and much better tool for Maxis to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about Maxis Berhad's use of debt, we should always consider it together with cash and equity."
