INTRODUCTION  Maxis was established and first launched their service in the year 1995. The founder of Maxis is Dato Ananda Krishnan.  The main or the core service is the communication itself.  The communication process is through voice calls service, messaging, mobile internet, wired and wireless broadband.\n\n4. 1) INTANGIBILITY The problems:  The difficulty to show/display the services (communication process).  The difficulty in pricing the services.  The solutions:  Use of tangible items to support the service Eg: broadband (emphasized on coverage & speed), manual for simcard  Create strong image of the company  Create loyal customers (word of mouth advertising)\n\n5. 2) HETEROGENEITY  The problems:  Low standardization of service ( At the counter service, different employees treat the customers differently)  Sometime the service is low in quality.  The solutions:  Give training to the employees  Use of technology (payment of bills through online and machine)  Always upgrade the telephone & internet line\n\n6. 3) PERISHABILITY  The problems:  High demand from the customers during festive seasons.
