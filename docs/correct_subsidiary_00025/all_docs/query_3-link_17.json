When The Sims production was moved into EA, he continued to operate a studio in Emeryville (known as Electronic Arts Emeryville and later Maxis Emeryville), California where he developed the Spore franchise. This studio was largely considered the successor to the original Maxis studio. The Maxis Emeryville studio was closed around March 2015.\n\nIn 2023, Maxis was composed of three offices:"
