Lastly, Maxis is creative not only the way they run the business, but those are how they answer the phone, the way they serve the customers and how they deal with the challenges. Creative is in whatever they do.\n\n3.0 Analysis of marketing environment\n\nThere are a lot of uncertainties that may influence the organization’s performance. Marketing environment is one of the important factors that able impacts on the organization. Besides that, the marketing environment has several forces that able to influence the Maxis Bhd Company which is social forces, economical forces, competitor forces, technological forces, and regulatory forces.\n\n3.1 Social forces\n\nThe social forces of the environment include the demographic characteristics of the population and its values. Changes in these forces can have dramatic impact on marketing strategy. The demographics of Malaysia are represented by multiple ethnic groups that exist in the country. The population on 2009 is more than 28million, and 5.72 million Malaysian live in East Malaysia and 22.5 million live in Peninsular Malaysia. If there are any changes of these demographic it will affect the marketing strategy by Maxis Bhd. A population can also be described using characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, income and occupation. How these characteristic affect the marketing strategy? Maxis Bhd is a company that selling mobile communication services in Malaysia. Thus, the characteristic such as age, ethnicity, income and also occupation are important to use to determine the targeted group of customer. For example, Maxis Bhd will basically base on the different group of customer to selling the different plan of mobile communication services to the customer. In addition, 18 to 25 ages, normally the persons who under this ranges of ages is a students. So, Maxis Bhd forms a student’s packages in order to attract the customers. In case, there are business man who more than 25 ages and above, company will form a different plan in order to suit the needs of the customers. Normally, the student’s package will more cheap than the others plan such as business man packages. The current student packages is free sending messages, have a great discount and low-cost calling charges which is 5-7 cents per minutes. But, for the non-student packages, it will not have such welfare. Basically, for non-student packages will more focus on the higher rate of charges.\n\n3.2 Economy Forces\n\nMalaysia is the rapidly development economy country in the South-east Asian, it has be category as the middle-income country. Malaysia is the third largest economy country in the south-east Asia, the geographic of Malaysia has separately into two parts which is the Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. In Malaysia, the land is rich in the natural resource and raw material. In early ear, the major of Malaysia economy are developing in the agriculture, mining and forestry sector. In year 1970, Malaysia has developed into a multi-sector economy from the producer of raw material. The economy has contributed by other sector such like medical, technology industry and service sector. Besides, the Strait of Malacca which is the international ship route increase the volume of international trade and manufacturing sector still remain the most influence the entire of Malaysia economy growth.\n\nAccording to service statistics information and communication technology in year 2008, the value added generated by the telecommunication service is amounted to Rm21.2 billion .Comparing with the Computer and other related activities, the value added generated is amounted to Rm6.5 billion. This shows that the telecommunication service sectors are more contributed to the Malaysia economy; there has potential market in the telecommunication service sector.\n\nBeside that, Malaysia financial year 2008 state that the agriculture sector has contributed 9.7 percentages to Malaysia GDP, industrial sector stand for 44.6 percentages and the rest is service sector was 45.7 percentages. However, Malaysian economy was growth slow in the year 2008. It is because of the gross investment was fixed; it is one of the element that influence the GDP.\n\nAccording to the Malaysia mobile cellular telephone data graphs in year 2000, there are 2,170,000 population of mobile cellular telephone subscriber. In year 2009, there are 23,347,000 population of mobile cellular telephone in Malaysia .Comparing the year 2000 and year 2009, there is increase 21,177,000 population of mobile cellular telephone subscriber. There are more Malaysian using the mobile cellular telephone in their life and it become a necessary tools for communication, the telecommunication companies play an important role to provide the quality service to the every customer in the market.\n\n3.3 Competitors\n\nMalaysia has come out with a competition law which this act was passed by Parliament in May 2010 and publicly announces in June 2010. It will be enforced on 1st January 2012. Besides, this Act is to provide a comprehensive competition law at the national level which cuts across all economic sectors and it apply to all commercial activities in Malaysia and outside Malaysia that will influence competition in Malaysia Market. Main provision of Competition Act 2010 is section 4 and section 10. Section 4 is to prohibition against anti competitive agreement which prohibition against any horizontal or vertical agreement which has the object or effect of significantly preventing, restricting or distorting competition in Malaysia. Besides, Section 10 is prohibition against abuse of dominant position which dominant position means a situation in where one or more\n\nEnterprises possess such significant power in a market to adjust prices or outputs or trading terms, without effective constraint from competitors or potential competitors. For section 4 prohibitions normally is for price fixing, market allocation, Bid ringing agreement, Exclusive dealing, and tie-in arrangement. However, for section 10 it is to prohibition abuse toward price discrimination, excessive pricing, and predatory pricing.\n\n3.3.1 Intertype competition\n\nIntertype competitions define as competitions among firms in different type of businesses but which both firms selling the same product.\n\nAs we know that, Maxis Berhad offered the iPhone4 subscription plans to consumers and the company sells its iPhone4 to the customers with its own package.(Refer Appendices 1) Furthermore, the Apple Company is the manufacturer for the iPhone4. Apple Company also offers its iPhone4 to mobile shops. Thus, mobile shops are directly competed with Maxis Berhad and both of them are from different industry. It means that, the relationship between the Maxis Bhd and mobile shop are intertype competition. Basically, the customers will buy for Maxis Bhd Company rather than the other mobile shop. The reason is because of the successful for the promotion package that setting by the Maxis Berhad Company\n\n3.3.2 Intratype competition\n\nIntratype competition defines as competition among firms in the same type of business. Example Competition between Maxis and Digi which both of them is from the same business field that selling the same product which is mobile communication.\n\nMaxis and Digi operating in the same business field which provide mobile communication services to customers. Digi targeted on teenagers by providing a entertainment service for this group consumers such as provide free internet connection with no cost for Digi consumers to view Facebook everyday by using stated link. Besides, Maxis doesn’t provide this kind of opportunity for their consumers because most properly they target on those working populations. Maxis promoting family plans package that charges low cost for family member who using the same network to encourage family member sign up the package to save their cost.(Refer Appendices 15) Otherwise, Digi has come out with a package that is once we have send message more than RM 2 each day the continue cost will be free as consumers message to the same network .It only charge RM 2 each day if consumers fulfil the package condition.\n\n3.4 Technological Forces\n\nMaxis Berhad internet communication should improve their Maxis broadband by upgrade their internet connection speed. Even though Maxis broadband is convenience because we can online and bring to anywhere, but during peak season the internet connection will down and it cause a lot consumers complain about this matter. Thus, if Maxis Berhad can improve their internet connection it will bring a lot opportunity for their firm. Before Maxis Berhad provide 3G function customers just can use mobile phone to communicate with each others. But today Maxis Berhad has provide 3G function that allow consumers to communicate and look at each other by using mobile phone and it also can use as videoconferencing for companies meeting. Maxis Berhad also pronounce that their company is going to launch 4G function soon to keep improving their technologies to meet with modern times.\n\n3.5 Regulatory forces\n\nMaxis marketing practices and business decisions are significantly influenced by the regulatory forces in Malaysia. So, Maxis has some restriction in conducting its business. In order to adapt to this regulatory environment, Maxis has followed all the laws that are stated and adjusted its activities in conducting business.\n\nMaxis Bhd is not a dominating company in the telecommunication industry in Malaysia. Malaysian’s competition act 2010 has contained forbiddance of anti-competitive behaviour and prohibition of the misuse of a dominated market position in order to protect competition. So, the business competition is fair and encouraged in Malaysia. However, it also has been shaped a heavily competition environment. Thus, Maxis is always striving to be efficient and innovative in its practices. Besides that, it also always improves its research and development of new services and techniques in order to compete with its competitors and create the best value to the customers.\n\nIn addition, Maxis is also governed by the product-related legislation which attempts to protect both company and consumer. The patent law and the copyright law provides maxis the right to keep out other from producing, using or selling that violate the patented creation and the exclusive right of its own work. Example, the slogans and the advertisements of Maxis are the copyright of the Maxis, so only Maxis can use it and customers are easily to identify Maxis when they see the particular advertisements and slogans. Maxis is not allowed to infringe others rights as well. Due to the Consumer labelling and consumerism act in Malaysia, Maxis is required to list out all the terms and conditions of all its products and services when it promotes to the customers. Maxis and its customers are also protected by the trademarks act that ensure the consumers are purchasing the true product and guarantees the company has the exclusive right to the word, name and symbol. So, the word ‘maxis’ and its symbol will appear on its every product, in order to make customers to recognize and identify it from other company, no others can use the word ‘maxis’ in their products.\n\nTo boot, there is no fixing price allowed in Malaysia. In fact, whatever price of talking rate, SMS charge, and even the monthly charge of broadband provided by maxis are different with other same industry company. This situation proves that there is no anti-competitive behaviour in this field. The competition is very fair and healthy among the several companies. So, price discount is used by Maxis in order to compete with other, for example you will get cheaper talking charge if you talk more.\n\nMaxis Bhd has made many exclusive dealings as its marketing practices, this distribution action is allowed in Malaysia. For example the maxis shops only sell the maxis packages, broadband and related products and services.\n\nAlso, Maxis is not engaging in the deceptive or misleading advertising which is illegal. Maxis advertisement is always correspond to the true of what it intended to let customers know. Maxis also attempt to police itself by participating in the MCMC (The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission) Designates Access Forum.\n\n4.0 Segmentation\n\nMaxis Berhad Company is using multiple products and multiple markets segments to segments the markets. Thus, Maxis Berhad Company tries to design the several different packages of product in order to satisfy the different type of user’s need and wants. Basically, it has numbers of variables that can be used to segment consumer markets, Such as, demographic, psychographic, and Behavior.\n\n4.1.1 Demographic\n\nSeveral segmentation variables which are age, gender, ethnicity, income, and occupation is used by Maxis Berhad in implementing its market segmentation.\n\nAge\n\nIn fact, Maxis Berhad tries to segment the market based on the age of the people below 25, and above 25. The potential customer is below 25 ages, normally is student. On the other hand, the consumer who is older than 25 ages basically is the working adult. The working adults basically have a greater usage in the mobile services. Thus, normally the package for 25 ages and above will enjoy more welfare compare to the others package.\n\nGender\n\nBoth female and male in the Malaysia are the Maxis Berhad potential customers, businessman need to make the call to do business, connect with clients and make order. Women like to use phone to have a long chat with friends.\n\nGeneration\n\nDifferent generations have the different needs and wants. Baby boomers desire more stable and reliable products and services, but it’s not all of them have a hand phone. Generation X are more concerning about the quality, for example the coverage of the Maxis Berhad services.

Other than that, Maxis bhd found that the usage rate ratio will different in some specific period. Especially in festival period such like Valentine’s Day, Happy New Year and Christmas Day. The usage rage will extreme higher than non-festival day.\n\n4.1 Targeting\n\nBecause of the Maxis Berhad’s telecommunication services are offered all around the country, so, the services are being targeted all the potential customers wherever in Malaysia, no matter with rural and urban areas.\n\nMaxis Berhad uses product differentiation to target different group of the customers. Different group of customers may have different needs and wants. Different plans and services are offered to reach the different group of customers. From the age segments which are below 25 and above 25, Maxis Berhad is using different plans to target these 2 groups of potential customers, both male and female, have the different intention to use the telecommunication services.\n\nFor the customers age below 25, Maxis Berhad targets this group by offering the prepaid plan to them, this group of customers usually use phone to have entertainment, communicate with friends, and enjoy the social life, they are usually not necessary to make the call in whatever situation, they just use the telecommunication service to have entertainment and lack dealing with important case, but they use it constantly. Hence, this kind of target customers are usually student, they required the cheaper and entertained services. They usually will make the call or sms when their prepaid account still have credit, and when all amount in their prepaid account has been spent, they will either top up the account or just left it zero, because it is not very important to them for whether can make the call, so the prepaid plan which is cheaper and convenient is suited o target this group.\n\nThe potential customers whose age above 25 are probably working adults, and willing to pay more expensive amount to receive a better service because of Maxis Berhad charges a higher price but provides good quality services to the customers. This group of customers usually emphasise the quality of telecommunication service because it is so important in their career. They need to use the phone to stay connection with their client, make order, and discuss the important issues.
