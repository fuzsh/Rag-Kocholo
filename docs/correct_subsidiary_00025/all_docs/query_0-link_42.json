        "text": "In 1987, game developers Will Wright and Jeff Braun founded Maxis Software, largely to assist in marketing Wright's SimCity. Successful sales led Maxis to publish similar titles, such as SimAnt (1991), A-Train (1992), and SimTower (1994), and the company soon became synonymous with innovative simulation games. Electronic Arts acquired the company in 1997, but its biggest hit was yet to come. In 2000, Maxis released The Sims, Wright's most successful title and the best-selling PC video game of all time. This digital dollhouse became so popular, the company released seven expansion packs, along with three direct sequels. In 2008, Maxis released Spore, which sold over one million units in the first month."
