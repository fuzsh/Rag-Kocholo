For more information about Maxis 5G Alliance and to become a member, visit https://lnkd.in/e49CY3uj.\n\nThanks to the Women at Maxis community, we celebrated International Women’s Day last month with a bang! With a lineup of events carefully curated by the team, each one aimed to encourage our women to have open conversations about a range of topics and inspire them to get ahead in their careers and beyond. The celebration kicked off with a fun virtual trivia game centred around women, followed by 3 virtual “Coffee Chat” sessions discussing different insightful topics such as managing career and personal life and taking charge of your career. We also had guest speakers from Microsoft and Grab joining us to discuss about women leadership in the tech space. We hope that we can inspire the women at Maxis to continue to learn and grow as much as they have inspired us to provide equal opportunities for everyone at Maxis to get ahead in their career journey. #lifeatmaxis #IWD2022 #breakthebias\n\nLet us show you how easy it is to safeguard your organisation's Office 365 and endpoint data with Maxis Backup as a Service.
