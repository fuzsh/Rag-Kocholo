Prior to the purchase, Maxis offered prefix number beginning with 012, and TimeCel 017.[citation needed]\n\nOn 27 April 2007, an offer was made to buy out Maxis and privatise the company in preparation for expansions into the Indonesian, Indian and Qatari markets.[citation needed] The deal was offered by Ananda Krishnan, who pledged Maxis RM17.46 billion (US$5.1 billion) in exchange for all remaining shares of the company. The offer is to be formally made by Usaha Tegas Sdn Bhd, a company owned by Krishnan, on 3 May 2007, while the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange suspends trading of the company's shares until 3 May.[14][15][16][17][18]\n\nUnder the urging of the former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, Maxis announce that it will re-list the company in Bursa Malaysia on 11 November 2009.[citation needed] The initial public offering, which constitute 30% of the company and involve its Malaysian operations, will raise at least MYR 11.7 billion.[19]\n\nIn September 2013, Maxis prepaid, Hotlink launched its #Hotlink plan, which is claimed to be the first telecommunications company to offer free internet services on cellular networks, Hotlink calling it \"Free Basic Internet\" which offers download speeds up to 64 kbit/s and which the management says is enough for checking Facebook, Twitter and Wikipedia on mobile optimised sites and also essentially eliminating data overage charges which as previously implemented at MYR 0.10/10 KB.[20]\n\nMaxis introduced a new brand identity in 2014 that maintains essentially the same logo, but with the squiggle on the letter \"i\" in a brighter shade of green.

The squiggle has been removed from the letter \"i\" and placed beside the wordmark. According to the telco, the new brand purpose signifies the intertwining of Maxis’ and Malaysia's past, present and future journeys together in this rapidly evolving digital age.

As such, it is also rolling out a series of initiatives to help offer assistance and fundamental skills for digital adoption and acceleration in communities across the country.[22]\n\nMajority stakeholders\n\n[edit]\n\nMaxis Communications is controlled by Malaysian tycoon Ananda Krishnan.

Launched in 1999, Hotlink offers prepaid plans and calls at first followed by their Hotlink postpaid plans and services to the people of Malaysia. Both Hotlink prepaid and postpaid depend on the 4G and LTE networks of wireless mobile telecommunications technology that provides much faster speeds compared to the 3G network. In Malaysia, 4G and LTE are used in the same manner thus calling it as 4G LTE but different devices will display it differently.[23] Apart from that, they also offer the IDD 132 (International Direct Dialing) service which offers the lowest discounted calls & rates to landlines in selected countries only at a rate of 20 cents per minute and which at certain times are much cheaper for most customers than local calls. Maxis is currently embroiled in a price war with its competitors namely Unifi, Yes, U Mobile and CelcomDigi in the prepaid SIM market which has caused their Hotlink starter pack sales to plummet.[24]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMaxis Tower\n\nAircel\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
