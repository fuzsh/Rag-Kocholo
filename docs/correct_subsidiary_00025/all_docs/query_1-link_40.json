        "text": "Simmers are among the most diverse groups in the industry, reflecting the diversity of our global population. A 2022 Maxis survey of over 18,000 players concluded that more than 38-percent of our audience comprises individuals who identify as people of color, which is higher than the U.S. national average of 27-percent. The survey also found that 43-percent of players are members of the LGBTQIA+, community compared to the U.S. national average of 9-percent. In turn, we’ve deliberately built a creative team and a network of partners that reflects our diverse community of players in every creative discussion.\n\nGames are an incredibly unique medium for self-expression and The Sims is no exception. As a studio made up of diverse creatives, we strive for everyone to feel represented in playing The Sims. As we imagine, develop, and implement new experiences we bring to players, we want to continue building a team that understands the stories told by players in-game and create an immersive experience for Simmers from underrepresented communities with authenticity at its core.\n\nOpen communication and collaboration are key to achieving inclusivity. We seek out every opportunity to acknowledge the implications of the features in The Sims and involve every part of our team and partners in these conversations. We actively invite creators who are already making diverse content for the game to contribute to these conversations and involve them in the development process. Candid discussions with our players, the It Gets Better Project, and GLAAD were integral to the integration of pronouns into our character customizations, an important in-game feature allowing non-binary Simmers to capture their identities meaningfully. Our skin tone update that included swatches and value sliders, unlocking thousands of customization options, were the result of very informative conversations with creators. We make these efforts because we’re committed to creating features ALL Simmers will love and getting them right.\n\nWe know there’s still work to be done and we know we can’t do it alone. At Maxis, we believe that a diverse and inclusive team leads to better games, and we are committed to creating an environment where all voices are heard and valued. We’re proud of having a global team, allowing us to grow our perspective and improve the way we develop The Sims. As the world and our understanding of DEI continue to evolve, we are eager to learn and grow. Even though we might not always get it right, we will keep trying to offer Simmers experiences they can be proud of and that authentically reflect their lived experiences.\n\nLearn more about our mission, culture, and opportunities on our website – we can’t wait to build with you!"
