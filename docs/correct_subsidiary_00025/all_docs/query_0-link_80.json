        "text": "Strategy\n\nHistorically, EA has derived the majority of sales through disk-based content; however, the fastest growing part of the business is delivering games directly to the consumers through online and wireless networks. Delivering games in this method is achieved by allowing players to access online delivered material and services as add-ons through console and PC, consumers can now download games directly through the Origin online platform, as well as through third-party online download stores and services, including through Sony’s PlayStation Network and Microsoft’s Xbox LIVE Marketplace, EA provide games for mobile devices and Internet-only games such as our free-to-play offerings that are available only through online and wireless delivery, and EA offers large-scale, massively multi-player online games and game services on a free-to-play and subscription basis. Although online games have become popular, it hasn't stopped EA from producing disk-based content. In the SEC 10-K the company writes, \"At the same time, we have aggressively reduced the number of significant titles releases that we launch each year. In fiscal year 2009, we published over 60 packaged goods products, each of which was primarily a stand-alone game with few or no online features, and in each fiscal year since, we have launched fewer titles on consoles, while building additional online features, content and services around each one of our titles. In fiscal year 2013, we published 13 titles on video game consoles and PCs (each with additional online features, content and/or services) and we offered more than 22 titles for mobile and Internet platforms to take advantage of the growth opportunities on those platforms. \"\n\n_\n\nGlobal Operations\n\nEA executive offices are located in Redwood City, California; however, EA operates development studios across the globe. Development studios are located in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Internationally, EA conducts business through their international headquarters in Switzerland and have wholly-owned subsidiaries throughout the world, including offices in Europe, Australia, Asia and Latin America. Having multiple offices and development studios across the globe shows that EA has engaged in the concept of globalization. EA Locations\n\nOperating Structure\n\nEA operates through multiple subsidiaries and releases content through these subsidiaries. The ownership of these multiple companies is an example of conglomeratization. By also owning/working with these other companies EA also uses the effect of vertical integration. Through the ownership of Origin, EA shows that it also has horizontal integration, this is because EA owns the distribution and produces the games that are released through Origin.\n\nBusiness\n\nEA produces and distributes game software content and services that can be played by consumers on many different what EA calls, \"platforms.\" These platforms include, SONY PLAYSTATION 3, Microsoft XBOX 360, Nintendo WiiU, Personal Computers (PC), mobile devices (Apple iPhone and Google Android), tablets and electronic readers (Apple iPad and Amazon Kindle), and the internet (Origin) also including social networking sites such as Facebook.\n\nplatforms\n\nElectronic Art's ability to publish games across several platforms, through multiple distribution channels, and directly to consumers is the main focus of the EA business strategy. Technology advances continue to create new platforms and distribution opportunities for interactive entertainment and these technologies impact the way consumers play video games. Since the announcement of the next generation consoles (PLAYSTATION 4 and XBOX ONE) EA plans to publish to the new platforms along with the PS3 and XBOX 360. EA has also invested significantly in their online platform, Origin. EA also develops games for the tablet and mobile devices, such as Plants vs. Zombies.\n\nBrands\n\nElectronic Art's portfolio of brands includes wholly-owned brands such as Battlefield, Mass Effect, Need for Speed, The Sims, Bejeweled, and Plants v. Zombies. Our portfolio also includes brands based on licensed intellectual property including sports-based brands such as Madden NFL and FIFA.\n\nCompetition\n\nEA faces competition in games for console devices for production of software development. EA competes directly with SONY, Microsoft and Nintendo for the software development. They also compete with other companies that develop and publish video games that operate on these consoles and on PCs. These companies include but are not limited to, Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive, and Ubisoft. Due to the publication of games across multiple platforms EA also faces competition in games for mobile devices and online gaming services. EA competes with Capcom Mobile, DeNA, Gameloft, Glu Mobile, Gree, Rovio, and Zynga, and hundreds of smaller companies in games for mobile devices. For onlie gaming services, EA competes with companies such as Activision Blizzard, Big Fish, King.com, Nexon, Tencent and Zynga and other providers of games on social networking platforms such as Facebook."
