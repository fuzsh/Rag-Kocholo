        "text": "Southwire Co., Carrollton, Ga., completed its acquisition of the assets of Phoenix, Ariz.-based Maxis LLC.\n\nFounded nearly eight years ago by electrical contractors who had a knack for developing products based on their own job-site experience, Maxis has added to its tool offering over the past few years with an acquisition and a marketing arrangement. In 2008, the company acquired Elder Designs Inc., Arapaho, Okla., the maker of the Wire Wagon wire and service cart line. Maxis is also jointly marketing its Pull-It series of wire pullers with Brian Ray, president, Ray Tools, Tempe, Ariz., and developer of the Pull-It product line.\n\n“Being a part of Southwire will allow us to expand our sales force, operating as one team with the same dedication to quality, service and solutions-based product development,” said James Jarvis, president of Maxis.\n\n“This acquisition demonstrates our continued commitment to providing innovative solutions for contractors. Additionally, it provides yet another research and development arm for Southwire,” said Jack Carlson, Southwire's Electrical Division president. “Maxis realizes great ideas come from the jobsite, and this is where they have concentrated their efforts. This focus has made Maxis one of the most innovative companies in the industry, centered exclusively on contractor solutions.”"
