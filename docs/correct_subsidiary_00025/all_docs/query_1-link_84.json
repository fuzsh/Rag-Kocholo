        "text": "Maxis is the much loved developer behind hit titles such as The Sims, Simcity, and Spore, and have been an EA Subsidiary since 1997. They have recieved a lot of acclaim and attention for their titles, with most of it having been positive, but came under a lot of fire with their recent SimCity 2013 videogame. It featured an always-online requirement which has been done and hated before by Ubisoft on PC and Blizzard with Diablo 3, and it received the same disdain as ever, especially with server troubles which rendered the game unplayable for days by many. Despite this, SimCity managed to sell solidly and was well received on a gameplay standpoint by critics. Despite the negative press, the game can be considered a success.\n\nWhether the problems with SimCity was the reason or not, 3 leading game developers of SimCity have left Maxis in order to form a new Indie studio, called Jellygrade. The developers in question are Creative Director Ocean Quigley, Simulation Architect Andrew Willmott, and Lead Gameplay Engineer Dan Moskowitz, people who were likely very integral to the experience of each game they've developed for and will undoubtedly be missed by Maxis.\n\nOcean Quigley took to Twitter to, in a round of tweets, announce this news.\n\n@oceanquigley said:\n\nBig news - I'm starting a new studio with @andrewwillmott & @moskow23 to make simulation games. We're calling it @jellygrade.\n\nWe were lead developers on SimCity, SimCity 4, Spore and The Sims2. We love making simulations\n\nWe're making a simulation about the dawn of life on earth; about lava, water, rock and the emergence of the first primordial creatures.\n\nWe're starting off on the iPad with a fundamentally new simulation engine - I can't wait to start showing it off.\n\nWe're building the new simulation engine now. Get updates at http://jellygrade.tumblr.com and follow us on twitter: @jellygrade\n\n@oceanquigley, via CVG\n\nTo those without an iPad, among the many questions he gave fans, he did mention they are looking at other platforms, particularly PC, but as a small starting Indie studio they are concentrating on the single platform for now, with a game concept which sounds quite intruiging. Concept art can be soon on the Jellygrade website with Quigley linked to, and which you can also reach be clicking here: Click!\n\nI wish Jellygrade the best of luck! Is anyone excited to see what these guys are doing to produce? Is that concept an interesting one? Do you think the negative press surrounding Maxis and EA for SimCity could have been a factor for this occuring? Drop a comment!"
