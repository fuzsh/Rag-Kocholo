        "text": "SimCity is one of the most beloved video games of all time, but development studio Maxis will be shut down after 30 years by gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA).\n\nAs well as the hugely popular SimCity titles, Maxis was also responsible for the successful Sims franchise and Spore.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped EA deciding to close the Maxis Emeryville studio in order to \"consolidate Maxis IP (intellectual property) development to our studios.\"\n\nThe company has said it plans to move forward with more Sims titles, as well as continued support for current SimCity and The Sims players.\n\n\"Players will continue to see rich new experiences in The Sims 4, with our first expansion pack coming soon along with a full slate of additional updates and content in the pipeline,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"All employees impacted by the changes today will be given opportunities to explore other positions within the Maxis studios and throughout EA. For those that are leaving the company, we are working to ensure the best possible transition with separation packages and career assistance.\"\n\nThe reaction online has been sympathetic to the closing of the games studio that was originally founded in 1987.\n\nElectronic Arts previously faced a backlash in 2013 when it released an online-only reboot of SimCity that suffered connection and saving problems.\n\nThe criticism was so bad it forced EA to hand out free copies of the game to affected users."
