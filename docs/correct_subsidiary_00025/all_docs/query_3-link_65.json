        "text": "Heres to another year of EA being voted the most hated company then. Again.\n\nI dont think i have ever seen a company that is so consistently bad at treating its customers. Its like they do it on purpose.\n\nAs pointed out by others, Maxis has been going downhill for years already. Sim City was a critical (after the initial, not long enough played and in a controlled online environment reviews) and public relations disaster.\n\nPretty much. EA bought Maxis in 1997. It isn't as if EA bought Maxis a few years ago, pushed out SimCity, then decided to strangle it in the crib. The studio's gone downhill, clearly couldn't meet the demands of its parent company, and got shut down. It sucks, but better companies and studios have disappeared for less.\n\nYeah Maxis was apparently in a bad financial position when EA bought it and it was fine until Spore. Meddling from EA and a faction within Maxis itself ruined Spore, Will Wright's dream game and was probably a major reason why he left the company. I don't know how many people left at that time as well, and studios do have lots of people come and go over the years, but it obviously was a loss of talent and direction they never recovered from.\n\nIt is partly due to EA's meddling why these studios they bought lost many of their lead people and floundered after that, but EA has also had changes in leadership too.\n\nDoes anyone know how many copies sim city 5 sold vs sim city 4? And relative profit? 5 might have costs a lot more to develop.\n\nI don't recall any numbers released, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was somewhere around breaking even at least, but I doubt it made much of a profit.\n\nOh c'mon. Sim city was an unmitigated disaster. If EA pushed the Always Online on them, then they might very well be to blame. Because that was the no 1 reason why it bombed.\n\nThe Always Online wasn't even a main reason, it was a major one, but the game had so many other short comings it was screwed regardless of the BS always online (which was for saving games in the cloud only, all the other \"calculations running in the cloud\" was total BS and lies) or not.\n\nA dev from Maxis posted this comment on /r/simcity:\n\nMoney. It all comes down to money. EA as a corporation doesn't share our sense of obligation out of sentimentality. Hence today's announcement.\n\nThe long gap is probably caused by several factors. First was that the expansion for SC4 didn't print cash like The Sims was at the time. Sure it made money, but The Sims had a HUGE (I remember reading 16x) return on the investment. So it got deprioritized to make The Sims 2. Which again made huge returns.\n\nEA has adopted a greenlight gating process. Where by with little or no capital invested they have a few highly talented senior designers/creative types come up with the framework of a game. They develop what they can as proof of concept, usually simple gameplay prototypes and concept art, which is then presented to EA. This sets up a series of gates and reviews whereby they get more money and manpower as it seems necessary and the time to work on the gameplay, engine, and artistic style. This whole period is called preproduction, and can last from a few months to a few years. At some point you go into production, which means you know what you are making, how you are going to do it, how they are going to sell it and hard numbers to back all of that up. Some time after that, when marketing thinks it is right, they will announce the game to the public. From that point on nothing changes from the public facing. Once locked into 'online-only' there was no way of changing it. People complained that the cities were too small but there was no way to address that without compromising the numbers and forecasts when the game was sold to EA's corporate overseers. EA can't be negotiated with at this level, you can't change their mind, you REALLY have to fight to get dates changed etc.\n\nSo, during that 10 year wait there was almost 9 years of silence. 3 or 4 of those years had active development of the game that shipped, with another year or more of a small group of creatives. There were other attempts that never made the light of day, and products (Simcity Societies comes to mind) that didn't deliver that 'SimCity' experience.\n\nI offer all of this with the caveat that they don't even tell us (read 'the devs') all of this and some of it is conjecture.\n\nI also don't fault EA with this process. It is meant to minimize risk and it does pretty well at that. EA is a very large ship, it takes a lot of energy and time to get it to change direction. That long process steers the ship and adds predictability. Smaller companies are able to pivot much faster but lack EA's resources and ability to 'play the long game'. All of this stuff happens out of necessity, and all of it comes down to money.\n\nEA is actually a great place to work these days. In the past there were difficulties (I was part of the EA Spouse/class action) but a lot of that has turned around. They really do want to retain talent and minimize layoffs. Not everyone shares this experience, but I haven't worked back-to-back weekends in almost a decade. EA has a really good benefits package, competitive pay, and a strong sense of progressive public responsibility. Maxis, in particular, the Sims side has what is probably the highest level of gender equality in the industry.\n\nI'm sad to see that studio close, it's been my home for a very long time.\n\ntl;dr Design and scope of the game has to be mostly planned out before it is in production, can't really be allowed to change anything despite massive negative feedback after it is announced publicly. Maxis still messed up as much as EA did."
