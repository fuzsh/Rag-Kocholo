(c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Electronic Arts shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the \"Certificates\"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Maxis Common Stock whose shares were converted into shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.8(d), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Electronic Arts may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.8(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Electronic Arts, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock into which their shares of Maxis Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time, payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.8(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Electronic Arts Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to such holder until the holder of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates.

(e) Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Electronic Arts or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Electronic Arts or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

On the demand of Electronic Arts, any Electronic Arts Common Stock issuable or cash payable in accordance with this Agreement that is made available to the Exchange Agent, if not distributed to the stockholders of Maxis for one year after the Effective Time, shall no longer be made available to the Exchange Agent, and any former stockholders of Maxis who have not theretofore complied with this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to Electronic Arts for payment of their claim for Electronic Arts Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Electronic Arts Common Stock. 1.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Maxis Common Stock. All shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and 1.8(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Maxis Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Maxis Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock into which the shares of Maxis Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.6, -5- <PAGE> cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.8(d); provided, however, that Electronic Arts may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Electronic Arts Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Electronic Arts, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 1.11 Tax and Accounting Consequences.

A vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Maxis Common Stock is required for Maxis' stockholders to approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Maxis and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Electronic Arts and, if applicable, Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Maxis, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy and other similar laws and general principles of equity.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Maxis, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will neither cause Maxis to be in violation or default under any such license, sublicense or other agreement, nor entitle any other party to any such license, sublicense or agreement to terminate or modify such license, sublicense or agreement, except for such violations, defaults, terminations or modifications which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Maxis. (c) Neither the manufacture, marketing, license, sale or intended use of any product or technology currently licensed or sold or under development by Maxis violates in any material respect any license or agreement between Maxis and any third party or, to the -12- <PAGE> knowledge of Maxis, infringes in any material respect any intellectual property right of any other party; and there is no pending or, to the knowledge of Maxis, threatened claim or litigation contesting the validity, ownership or right to use, sell, license or dispose of any Maxis IP Rights, nor, to the knowledge of Maxis, is there any basis for any such claim that is likely to be successful, nor has Maxis received any notice asserting that any Maxis IP Rights or the proposed use, sale, license or disposition thereof conflicts or will conflict with the rights of any other party, nor, to the knowledge of Maxis, is there any basis for any such assertion that is likely to be successful.

Each Maxis Employee Plan has been operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of applicable law. Neither Maxis nor any Maxis Affiliate has incurred or is reasonably expected to incur any material liability under Title IV of ERISA in connection with any Maxis Employee Plan. All contributions due from Maxis or any Maxis Affiliate with respect to any Maxis Employee Plan have been made or -14- <PAGE> accrued on Maxis' financial statements, and no further contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of the Effective Date, except contributions that are consistent with the Employee Plans and past practices of Maxis.
