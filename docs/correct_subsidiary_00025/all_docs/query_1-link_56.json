        "text": "Last week, while the world faced a global outage where #tech disruptions grounded airplanes, hit banks, businesses, schools and more, outdoor brand Decathlon International and Nestlé's chocolate brand #KitKat took the opportunity to generate sales and build their brand. In reaction to the global outage, Decathlon purchased a digital out of home (#DOOH) ad space to encourage consumers to head outdoors and shop. Joyce Gan and Shouvik Prasanna Mukherjee weighed in on how #Decathlon and #KitKat's global outage reactive #campaign hit the mark so perfectly. #advertising\n\nSportswear company HOKA has launched the latest evolution of its \"Fly Human Fly\" globally integrated marketing campaign with an anthem #film entitled \"Bird’s Eye\". Bringing the brand’s origin story to life, the film celebrates joyful performance, while inspiring movers everywhere to take flight. The brand anthem film was done in collaboration with creative agency Anomaly, further building on the “Murmuration” campaign released in June of last year (2023). #collaboration #campaign\n\nCOATS® - Colloidal Oatmeal Coated Gloves is keeping hands moisturised and protected in its latest campaign, \"Care with every wear.\" \"Care with every wear\" aims to promote, educate and generate samplings of COATS Gloves that are designed to moisturise, protect and soothe the skin of users. The campaign was done in #collaboration with FCB SHOUT. The agency was appointed to handle both #creative and #media duties in 2023 following a #pitch involving multiple agencies. #campaign\n\nConversations online regarding German insurer #Allianz’s ongoing discussions to potentially buy #IncomeInsurance are currently 67.6% neutral, 3.8% positive and 28.6% negative, according to media intelligence firm CARMA. The sentiments reflect that the news has sparked some #controversy on #SocialMedia, with users expressing concerns about the impact on policyholders and the company's financial position, it said. “Large corporations often find themselves under scrutiny on social media for how consumers perceive their actions. Having a good reputation is the key to reassuring that stakeholder interests will be safeguarded. This is especially important during significant movements like mergers or acquisitions,” said Divika Jethmal, head of marketing at #CARMA. #SocialSentiments #acquisition\n\nSystemic barriers exist in the #PublicRelations industry across the Asia Pacific region and to address these issues are seven guiding principles to uphold. With an increasing need to ensure that #diversity, #equality, and #inclusion (DE&I) are at the forefront of all PR professionals’ work, the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) APAC has launched a seven-point charter with inputs from PR and communications practitioners in the region. #PRindustry #guidelines\n\n#Nike’s latest #Olympics campaign has caused a fair bit of chatter online, after one of its shots featuring a #ChineseAthlete licking her table tennis paddle ignited widespread outrage across China. Media intelligence firm CARMA observed over 3,000 mentions on social media since Nike’s advert came out on 19 July, with the majority of mentions coming from #Weibo. Of these mentions, 62% were negative, and 18% were positive. Most #netizens found the advert disgusting, particularly due to the angle at which it was shot. Many noted that while they have seen athletes kissing the paddle as a form of self-encouragement before a match, they were puzzled by the focus on an athlete licking the edge of the paddle, as they had never seen such an act in any past table tennis tournament, said Charles Cheung, HK GM, CARMA. What led to the PR debacle around Nike's Olympics campaign? Let's hear from David Ko, Brian Yeung, Ambrish Chaudhry, Desmond So and Leung Chung. #advertising #controversy\n\nHealth soap brand #Lifebuoy is bringing hand hygiene and handwashing into schools with its new \"H for handwashing: little hands, bright future\" campaign. Supported by the #MinistryOfEducation (MOE), ministry of health and guardian Malaysia, the campaign aims to improve #PersonalHygiene among the youth and is part of a broader initiative to educate children on the importance of handwashing with soap. \"#HandHygiene is a simple yet powerful tool to prevent illness. We are proud to be working closely with MOE and the ministry of health towards a common goal of teaching children alike about the importance of good handwashing habits and protecting them from harmful germs, so they do not miss a single day of school and life's important moments,\" said Lenny Chuah, head of country, Unilever Malaysia and country business unit lead of personal care in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. \"At #Guardian, we believe in the power of community and the importance of nurturing good health habits from a young age. That’s why we are running the 'Purchase with purpose' campaign with Lifebuoy in our stores to support hygiene education for students in Malaysia,\" said Chan Shu Chien (Sue), category senior manager (personal care), Guardian Malaysia. #campaign #education\n\n#CoronaCero is celebrating every golden moment in life with a new activation called \"Golden Venues\". The campaign comes shortly after the beer brand was named the first-ever beer sponsor of the #OlympicGames. The activation brings the same seats as from the Olympic Games venues in Paris to iconic travel destinations across four continents. “From Greece, Brazil, Japan, South Africa and Argentina, Corona Cero is offering this gift to fans as an opportunity to experience the Olympic golden moment feeling through Golden Venues,” said Clarissa Pantoja, vice president of Corona global. “As the world anticipates the start of the Olympics, we are proud to see Corona Cero bring a touch of the Games to these global iconic locations for more fans to connect to their golden moments,” said Anne-Sophie Voumard, managing director IOC Television and Marketing Services. \"We wanted to not only say, but show the world, that golden moments can happen everywhere. The Olympic feeling goes way beyond the games, and we’d like to give the world the ability to feel that same feeling every day,\" said Gabriel Schmitt, Grey's global chief creative officer. #partnership #campaign\n\nCathay Pacific has partnered with five Olympic champions to support the upcoming Olympics games, riding on the theme of its latest #campaign featuring Hong Kong swimmer #SiobhanHaughey. The idea of the #partnership came from the belief that there are no shortcuts to reaching the world stage, only through constant struggle and effort can one achieve greatness - \"Every move counts\". Developed with Publicis Groupe Hong Kong, Cathay used hyper realistic #CGI to feature the athletes on iconic Hong Kong landmarks. In a conversation with MARKETING-INTERACTIVE, Edward Bell, general manager of brand, insights and marketing communications of Cathay, said, “As the long-standing partner of the SF&OC and the flagship carrier in Hong Kong, we wanted to build a sense of unity among Hongkongers and channel their cheers to support our home team athletes at the upcoming Olympics.\" #airlines #2024Olympics\n\nIn celebration of its 120th anniversary, Hong Kong Tramways has teamed up with local character #McDull (#麥兜) to launch a pop-up at #CentralMarket from 31 July to 8 September. The Grade III historical building is transformed into a celebratory destination, featuring McDull and the Hong Kong Tramways ambassador \"Ding Ding Cat\" through an array of initiatives with the theme of “Moved by our every journey”. #partnership #PopUp"
