What we want is to add to our culture.\n\nWe want to hear what you’ve built, even if it’s not a game! Tell us about your database, art, or online community.\n\nHaving a team with diverse viewpoints helps us create games that speak to more lived experiences.\n\nWe’re obsessed with “how”—tell us how you work, how you put your values into action, how you collaborate."
