Non-GAAP shares used for computing diluted earnings per share includes potentially dilutive equity instruments and the anti-dilutive effect of the Convertible Bond Hedge.\n\n· Expected non-GAAP net income excludes the impact of the following items (estimate in millions) from expected GAAP net income:\n\nAcquisition-related expenses\n\n$ 14\n\nAmortization of debt discount\n\n10\n\nChange in deferred net revenue (online-enabled games)\n\n260\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n45\n\nIncome tax adjustments\n\n(17)\n\nExpected Impact on Non-GAAP Net Income (net)\n\n$ 312\n\nConference Call and Supporting Documents\n\nElectronic Arts will host a conference call on July 30, 2015 at 2:00 pm PT (5:00 pm ET) to review its results for the first quarter ended June 30, 2015 and its outlook for the future.

An audio webcast replay of the conference call will be available for one year at http://ir.ea.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Electronic Arts uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by Electronic Arts include: non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share and non-GAAP diluted shares. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items (other than Shares from Convertible Bond Hedge, which are included), as applicable in a given reporting period, from the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations:\n\nAcquisition-related expenses\n\nAmortization of debt discount\n\nChange in deferred net revenue (online-enabled games)\n\nCollege football settlement expenses\n\nIncome tax adjustments\n\nLoss on licensed intellectual property commitment (COGS)\n\nRestructuring and other\n\nShares from Convertible Bond Hedge\n\nStock-based compensation\n\nElectronic Arts may consider whether other significant non-recurring items that arise in the future should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures it uses.\n\nElectronic Arts believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core business, operating results or future outlook. Electronic Arts’ management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s operating results both as a consolidated entity and at the business unit level, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. The Company’s management team is evaluated on the basis of non-GAAP financial measures and these measures also facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance to prior periods.\n\nIn addition to the reasons stated above, which are generally applicable to each of the items Electronic Arts excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude certain items for the following reasons:\n\nAcquisition-Related Expenses. GAAP requires expenses to be recognized for various types of events associated with a business acquisition. These events include expensing acquired intangible assets, including acquired in-process technology, post-closing adjustments associated with changes in the estimated amount of contingent consideration to be paid in an acquisition, and the impairment of accounting goodwill created as a result of an acquisition when future events indicate there has been a decline in its value. When analyzing the operating performance of an acquired entity, Electronic Arts’ management focuses on the total return provided by the investment (i.e., operating profit generated from the acquired entity as compared to the purchase price paid including the final amounts paid for contingent consideration) without taking into consideration any allocations made for accounting purposes. When analyzing the operating performance of an acquisition in subsequent periods, the Company’s management excludes the GAAP impact of any adjustments to the fair value of these acquisition-related balances to its financial results.\n\nAmortization of Debt Discount on the Convertible Senior Notes. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes, we are required to amortize as a debt discount an amount equal to the fair value of the conversion option as interest expense on the Company’s $632.5 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in July 2011 over the term of the notes. Electronic Arts’ management excludes the effect of this amortization in its non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nChange in Deferred Net Revenue (Online-enabled Games). The majority of our software games can be connected to the Internet whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a when-and-if-available basis (“unspecified updates”) for use with the original game software. In addition, we may also offer an online matchmaking service that permits consumers to play against each other via the Internet. GAAP requires us to account for the consumer’s right to receive unspecified updates or the matchmaking service for no additional fee as a “bundled” sale, or multiple-element arrangement. Electronic Arts is not able to objectively determine the fair value of these unspecified updates or online service included in certain of its online-enabled games. As a result, the Company recognizes the revenue from the sale of these online-enabled games on a straight-line basis over the estimated offering period. Electronic Arts’ management excludes the impact of the change in deferred net revenue related to online-enabled games in its non-GAAP financial measures for the reasons stated above and also to facilitate an understanding of our operations because all related costs of revenue are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably.\n\nCollege Football Settlement Expenses. During fiscal 2014, Electronic Arts recognized a $48 million charge for expected litigation settlement and license expenses related to our college football business. This expense is excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nIncome Tax Adjustments. The Company uses a fixed, long-term projected tax rate internally to evaluate its operating performance, to forecast, plan and analyze future periods, and to assess the performance of its management team. Accordingly, the Company applies the same tax rate to its non-GAAP financial results. During fiscal year 2016 the Company is applying a tax rate of 22 percent to its non-GAAP financial results. For fiscal years 2014 and 2015, a 25 percent tax rate was applied, and through fiscal year 2013 the Company applied a 28 percent tax rate.\n\nLoss on Licensed Intellectual Property Commitment (COGS). During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, Electronic Arts terminated its right to utilize certain intellectual property that the Company had previously licensed and we incurred a loss of $122 million on the corresponding license commitment. This expense is excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nRestructuring and Other. Although Electronic Arts has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Each of these restructurings has been unlike its predecessors in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from its non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nShares from Convertible Bond Hedge. In July 2011, the Company issued convertible senior notes that mature in July 2016 (the “Notes”) with an initial conversion price of approximately $31.74 per share. When the quarterly average trading price of EA’s common stock is above $31.74 per share, the potential conversion of the Notes has a dilutive impact on the Company’s earnings per share. At the time the Notes were issued, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Convertible Bond Hedge”) to offset the dilutive effect of the Notes. The Company includes the anti-dilutive effect of the Convertible Bond Hedge in determining its non-GAAP dilutive shares.\n\nStock-Based Compensation. When evaluating the performance of its individual business units, the Company does not consider stock-based compensation charges. Likewise, the Company’s management teams exclude stock-based compensation expense from their short and long-term operating plans. In contrast, the Company’s management teams are held accountable for cash-based compensation and such amounts are included in their operating plans. Further, when considering the impact of equity award grants, Electronic Arts places a greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants.\n\nIn the financial tables below, Electronic Arts has provided a reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nSome statements set forth in this release, including the information relating to EA’s fiscal 2016 guidance information under the heading “Business Outlook,” contain forward-looking statements that are subject to change. Statements including words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate” or “expect” and statements in the future tense are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are preliminary estimates and expectations based on current information and are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or actual future results to differ materially from the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements.\n\nSome of the factors which could cause the Company’s results to differ materially from its expectations include the following: sales of the Company’s titles; the Company’s ability to manage expenses; the competition in the interactive entertainment industry; the effectiveness of the Company’s sales and marketing programs; timely development and release of Electronic Arts’ products; the Company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions; the consumer demand for, and the availability of an adequate supply of console hardware units; the Company’s ability to predict consumer preferences among competing platforms; the Company’s ability to service and support digital product offerings, including managing online security; general economic conditions; and other factors described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are current as of July 30, 2015. Electronic Arts assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements. In addition, the preliminary financial results set forth in this release are estimates based on information currently available to Electronic Arts.\n\nWhile Electronic Arts believes these estimates are meaningful, they could differ from the actual amounts that Electronic Arts ultimately reports in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015. Electronic Arts assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these estimates prior to filing its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015.\n\nAbout Electronic Arts\n\nElectronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) is a global leader in digital interactive entertainment.
