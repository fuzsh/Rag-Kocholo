        "text": "Established in 1995, Maxis was one of the first mobile communications providers in Malaysia.\n\nThe company is constantly revamping its business model and was one of the first operators to introduce 4G services in 2013. Its 4G service reaches 15% of the Malaysian population, making Maxis a market leader in this area.\n\nMaxis also offers cloud computing to small and medium businesses. The company's 2G and 3G networks cover 95% and 83% of the Malaysian population respectively.\n\nMaxis' CEO is Norwegian Morten Lundal, former CEO of DiGi.Com, another Malaysian telecommunications company. He was also a top executive at Vodafone, the U.K.'s leading mobile phone company.\n\nMaxis is more than 60% controlled by Usaha Tegas, a private investment arm of Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan."
