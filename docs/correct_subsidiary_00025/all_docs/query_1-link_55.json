Following the move, AWT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maxis.\n\nAWT, in turn, wholly-owns UMTS Malaysia Sdn Bhd, the holder of a 2100MHz spectrum assignment from Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) for 15 years, which is due on April 1, 2018.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to accelerate Maxis’ decision-making on matters surrounding the 2100MHz spectrum assignment, which is used for third generation (3G) wirless Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network.\n\nShares of Maxis slipped 4 sen or 0.67% to RM5.91 today, valuing the group at RM44.39 billion."
