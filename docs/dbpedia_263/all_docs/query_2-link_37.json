        "text": "Before Nebraska (Buford HS)\n\nDylan Raiola joined Nebraska as the top quarterback recruit in the country. He began his prep career in Texas and Arizona before playing his senior season for Buford High School in Georgia. In his prep career, Raiola passed for nearly 8,500 career yards with 88 touchdowns and only 11 interceptions, according to MaxPreps.\n\nAs a senior at Buford, Raiola helped the Wolves to an 11-2 record and the quarterfinals of the state playoffs. He completed 63 percent of his passes, throwing for 2,666 yards. Raiola threw 34 touchdowns and had just one interception. Raiola played his junior season at Chandler High School in Arizona, where he led the Wolves to the semifinals of the open division state playoffs. He threw for 2,435 yards and 22 touchdowns at Chandler, completing 64 percent of his passes. As a sophomore at Burleson High School in Texas, Raiola completed 65 percent of his passes and threw for 3,341 with 32 touchdowns, and he added nine rushing touchdowns. Raiola was the county and district player of the year.\n\nRaiola was rated as the top quarterback prospect in the country by 247Sports, ESPN and Rivals. Each organization also had him ranked among the top 10 overall recruits nationally, including 247Sports and Rivals which each tabbed him as the No. 2 overall recruit in the 2024 class.\n\nDylan is the son of Dominic Raiola, who was a center at Nebraska from 1997 to 2000. Dominic was a redshirt on the Huskers' 1997 national championship team and in 2000, he was a first-team All-American and the Rimington Trophy winner as the nation's top center. Dominic's No. 54 jersey is retired at Nebraska. He went on to play 14 seasons in the National Football League with more than 200 career starts, becoming the second player in Detroit Lions history to play in 200 games and the first non-kicker.\n\nDylan's uncle, Donovan, is Nebraska's offensive line coach."
