        "text": "The 2024 EMX125 season is set to start another season, this time at the sandy track of Riola Sardo, the first of ten championship stops. With Mathis Valin, Janis and Martins Reisulis, and other top names moving to the EMX250 class, this season will be wide open with plenty of young talents ready to fight for their first win, as none involved in this class haven´t won an overall yet. This means that we are at a whole new generation of riders. With that in mind, it´s hard no pick the favorites. So, this is a list with some names to keep an eye on during the season.\n\nYAMAHA MJC:\n\nDani Hetink, Jarne Bervoets and Mano Faure will be the ones defending the MJC colors on the YZ125 GYTR kitted for 2024.\n\nDani Hetink is the defending 2023 FIM Junior World Championship 85cc class, recognized as one of the youngest Dutch talents has now the great chance to prove it in the challenging EMX125 Presented by FMF Racing class. Dani is approaching his first full season in the 125cc class (after a few appearance last year) and will be able to get used to it with a structure like MJC behind him.\n\nJarne Bervoets 2nd place finisher at the FIM Motocross Junior World Championship 85cc class in Bucharest last season. The young Belgian had already the chance to show everybody his talent and speed in the past season and now inside a Factory structure will have the best possibility to improve.\n\nMano Faure is the French rider of the three, 15 years old former Motocross of European Nations Champion in 2022 with Team France (together with Quentin Marc Prugniers, Mathys Valin and Amaury Maindru) is at his second season in the EMX125 Presented by FMF Racing class. Inside a French team Mano, will have the chance to push himself and get comfortable on the YZ125 GYTR kitted ang get some good results.\n\nFantic Factory:\n\nThe Italian brand has won two titles in the last three seasons, this year they hope to regain the crown that currently belongs to the Yamaha MJC team. They have chosen three riders to carry out this task: Belgian Douwe Van Mechgelen, Italian Simone Mancini and Hungarian Noel Zanocz. This last one is possibly the strongest of the three, as last year he finished 7th in the championship after showing good flashes of speed on several occasions and this year he closed his pre-season with a third place in the International D´Italia. Mancini, meanwhile, was 2nd last year at the final round in Matterley Basin, finishing outside the Top 10 in the EMX125 standings.\n\nSpain RFME Team:\n\nThe Spanish national team arrives with more experience and motivation to face a new EMX125 season. This year team selector Paco Rico has chosen Salvador Perez, Carlos Prat, and Carlos Salvador, who currently sit 1st, 2nd, and 4th in the Spanish Motocross Championship. Perez has won all the races so far: 6, and last season he had the opportunity to join the official Yamaha team as a replacement rider, finishing 17th in the final standings with 100 points.\n\nRaceStore KTM:\n\nThe Italian team has taken on the new role of the official KTM team within the EMX125 category. Its riders will be Italian Nicoló Alvisi and Dutchman Gyan Doensen. Both have won major titles in the 85cc category; Alvisi won the EMX85 European Championship and Doensen the 85cc Junior World Championship and more recently was crowned champion in the International D´Italia, and last weekend won the second round of the Dutch Masters to take the lead in the championship. He will be one of the favourites in Riola.\n\nNOTICEABLES:\n\nThese are some riders to keep an eye on:\n\nKassimir Hindersson #480 | KTM Motivation: Last year he took 2nd overall at the sand of Lommel after winning the second moto. Start the season in Riola will be a great deal for him!\n\nCole McCullough #555 | Fantic: For 2024, Ireland´s McCullough will once again focus on the EMX125 championship and has made the switch to Fantic machinery with the experienced Corrado Maddii building his bikes.\n\nAlessandro Gaspari #18 | Dreams Racing KTM: Another Italian to count on. Gaspari raced some MX2 races on his 125cc in order to prepeare for the EMX125.\n\nEMX125 – 2024 CALENDAR\n\nEMX125 Riola Sardo Entry list:"
