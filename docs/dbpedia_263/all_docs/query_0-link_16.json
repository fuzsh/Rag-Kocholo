        "text": "The Karl Engeland Prize was endowed by the Honorary Senator of the Bremen University of Applied Sciences and building contractor Mr Dipl.-Ing. Karl Engeland, who passed away on 18 April 2016 at the age of 93.\n\nThe Karl Engeland Award at Bremen University of Applied Sciences supports education in the degree programmes of the departments of Architecture and Construction and Environment of the Faculty of Architecture, Construction and Environment. Since 2002, the Karl Engeland Prize has recognised outstanding final theses from the Faculty's degree programmes. Bachelor's and Master's theses as well as scientific papers dealing with architectural, engineering, construction, traffic or environmental topics can be submitted.\n\nThe central theme of the Karl Engelland Prize is dedicated to theses that are outstanding in terms of design and construction, and expressly promotes a good combination of design and construction aspects.\n\nThe Karl Engeland Prize is awarded annually in the winter semester at the beginning of the semester in a festive setting, e.g. at the freshman welcome ceremony. The deadline for applications depends on the date of the award ceremony and is announced in good time by the Dean of Studies.\n\nThe jury consists of at least one representative each from the Chamber of Engineers and the Chamber of Architects as well as one professor each from the Department of Architecture and the Department of Construction and Environment of the Bremen University of Applied Sciences.\n\nThe Peter Wefing Award was donated to Bremen University of Applied Sciences by Peter Wefing, a businessman, who passed away on 2 February 2016 at the age of 88.\n\nThe Peter Wefing Sponsorship Award is intended to honour outstanding final theses from the degree programmes of the Civil Engineering and Environmental Engineering departments of Faculty 2 at Bremen University of Applied Sciences.\n\nThe Peter Wefing Prize is awarded annually.\n\nA jury consisting of Eva Maria Boehme as representative of the Peter Wefing Foundation, a representative of the Bremen Chamber of Engineers, the Dean of the Faculty of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering as well as a representative from each of the two degree programmes decides on the awarding of the prize.\n\nThe prize will be awarded during a small ceremony with members of the degree programmes and guests at the university.\n\nSince 2011, the VBI regional association (Association of Consulting Engineers) has been awarding the prize in cooperation with Bremen University of Applied Sciences to teams from the faculties of architecture and civil engineering. In 2020, the task of the \"Interdisciplinary Design\" module was to develop solutions for the future of Bremen's \"Neue Vahr\" district in a time horizon up to 2035. The student teams submitted a draft and design plan for a place in the \"Vahr\" where the residents of the neighbourhood can meet, exchange ideas and \"do\" things for their daily needs digitally. This place should have a lasting positive influence on the identification with the \"Neue Vahr\" district and also be visible beyond the district boundaries."
