At this time no comments, testimony or evidence from the public will be accepted.\n\nThe Board may also call its own witnesses and present its own evidence with respect to any application.\n\nOnce the applicant has concluded their presentation and the Board opens the public comment portion of the application, the public is welcomed to comment, present evidence and testimony regarding the application. Each person must be sworn in under oath, and is limited to five minutes. If desired, the applicant or his/her attorney may cross examine you based upon your comments or testimony.\n\nIf more than one hearing is needed to complete an application, it will be carried to a future date.\n\nNo new application will start after 9:30 PM unless the Board and applicant agree it can be concluded in a timely manner, otherwise it will be carried. The Board reserves the final decision.\n\nThe Board will adjourn at a reasonable hour, and no witness testimony will be provided after 10:00 pm unless agreed to by the Board.\n\nMEMBERS\n\nPursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-25(c)(2), the Borough of Bradley Beach has created a nine-member Planning Board (also known as the Land Use Board), which Planning Board shall have the right to exercise, to the same extent and subject to the same restrictions, all the powers of a Zoning Board of Adjustment.\n\nBoard Members"
