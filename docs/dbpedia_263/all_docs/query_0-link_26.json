        "text": "Public policies for health: perspectives from economics and health care\n\nFrom 26th to 28th June 2024, San Cristóbal de La Laguna (Tenerife) will have the honour of hosting the XLIII Health Economics Conference (AES). The theme chosen for this conference is \"Public policies for health: perspectives from economics and health care\".\n\nPublic policies for health are a basic tool for achieving the objectives of efficient allocation of available resources and equal access to health services for citizens. They therefore play a fundamental role in improving the general population's health and in a fairer distribution of health profits among the different social groups. They are also crucial for disease prevention and the promotion of healthy lifestyles through public education programmes. Another example would be public programmes combating social exclusion or unemployment, which also have a role to play, given the social determinants of health. Public policies for health have been proven to be essential for the effective management of health crises and emergencies such as that recently experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis can be done through a variety of instruments, such as public-private provision and production of services, the combination of health and health-related taxes and subsidies, the validation of co-payments as an instrument of complementary public financing, the institutionalisation of prioritisation processes, regulation in the field of medicines and health technologies, or the appropriate provision of information to users on the quality of care.\n\nEconomics, and in particular the evaluation of public health policies, is of fundamental importance as the main analytical tool for informed decision-making. Recently, Law 27/2022 has established a normative framework for such evaluation: \"all public policies with a significant budgetary, economic or social impact should be subject to an ex-ante and an ex-post evaluation\". Impact evaluation and economic evaluation play a key role alongside economic models. Significant advances in methodology and data availability in recent years facilitate this task. All of this contributes to legitimising public policies themselves, while - if done systematically - it becomes a useful instrument of accountability for the actions (or non-actions) of the authorities responsible for citizens' health.\n\nActions within the health sector and, in particular, strategies for collaboration between different health professionals at different levels of care (and between these and social services) or organisational, governance and information management improvements in the health sector, can also be considered as an integral part of public health policies, as they are essential to optimising the use of public resources. In this regard, it is worth noting, among other actions, the revision of the status of health professionals or the achievement - with appropriate regulation - of the appropriate balance between public and private health services, thus aligning with the achievement of social objectives.\n\nThe theme for the conference \"Public policies for health: perspectives from economics and health care\", in a mutually reinforcing interface, will serve as a common theme for the conference in which, like every year, we will have the opportunity to present and debate the main cutting-edge issues in the field of health economics. The Scientific Committee and the Organising Committee are working together to design an attractive programme, at least on a par with previous conferences, which, like every year, will unite economists, managers, health professionals and other experts in the field of economics and public health, in short, all those interested in gaining further knowledge of health economics and management.\n\nThis year for the first time, the island of Tenerife is preparing to host our Conference in the sunshine of the Fortunate Islands and under the shadow of Mount Teide. The University of La Laguna, located in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, a World Heritage Site, offers an exceptional setting to enjoy and make the most of the Conference's scientific and social programme. But none of the above will be possible without your participation. That is why we would be delighted if you attended and actively participated in the 43rd Health Economics Conference (AES) by sending your proposals for papers and round tables. And keep up to date with the latest news from the conference by visiting the website.

It is a unique example of an unwalled colonial city with emblematic buildings surrounded by pedestrian areas with lots of cultural, commercial and restaurant activity.\n\nIn the historic quarter, highlights include the neoclassical cathedral (16th century), El Cristo church (16th century) -the headquarters of the city's patron saint-, the palaces of Nava (16th century) and Salazar (17th century), the convents of Santa Catalina (17th century) and Santa Clara (16th century), and the headquarters of the University of La Laguna -the first higher education institution in the Canary Islands with over two centuries of history-.\n\nTenerife has other urban areas of interest such as Santa Cruz de Tenerife -the island's capital-, towns representative of the history of the Canary Islands such as La Orotava, Icod de los Vinos or Garachico (a municipality included in the list of the most beautiful towns in Spain) and internationally recognised tourist destinations such as El Puerto de la Cruz or Adeje, among others.\n\nTenerife has an immeasurably rich natural heritage where you can enjoy hiking. The Teide National Park -the highest peak in Spain, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO-, the Anaga massif -the Rural Park with the highest number of endemic species in Europe, declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO-, the Los Gigantes cliffs, the Masca Valley and Teno Rural Park are just a few examples.\n\nTenerife, the number one tourist destination in the Canary Islands, is home to exclusive black sand beaches in the north and white sand beaches in the south. Likewise, its seabed treasures a great variety of species and geological formations that make the island a tourist attraction for diving enthusiasts too.\n\nFor further information, please visit the following link: https://www.holaislascanarias.com/tenerife/\n\nTransport\n\nBelow, we explain how to get to Tenerife and the best way to get around.\n\nHow to get to Tenerife\n\nTenerife has two international airports: Tenerife Norte-Ciudad de La Laguna (formerly Los Rodeos airport) and Tenerife Sur-Reina Sofía.

In oral sessions, authors will have about 15 minutes to present their work, followed by a general discussion.\n\nThe author responsible for the communication will be the one who presents the communication during the conference. This should be indicated in the submission form.\n\nOne person cannot be responsible for more than TWO papers.\n\nAuthors who have not registered before April 21th will have their abstracts removed from the programme.\n\nAuthors must choose a maximum of two key words between two different lists, the first being more general and the second more detailed.\n\nThe AES Conference will have 4 stakeholder sessions (EEconAES, EvaluAES, GestionAES and AESEC).\n\nIn the EEconAES and EvaluAES sessions the author will present his/her paper and then there will be a discussion by a commentator who will have read the paper beforehand. The session will be followed by a brief discussion with all participants.\n\nThe GestionAES session will open with an invited presentation by a health manager. Then, the rest of the authors will present their communication. The session will be followed by a brief discussion with all participants.\n\nFor the AES Early Careers (AESEC) session, i.e. recent, pre-doctoral or post-doctoral researchers having completed their PhD in the last 5 years, the author will not present his/her work, because a senior reference in his/her field will make the presentation-discussion and will be followed by a brief discussion with all participants.\n\nIf you wish your paper to be considered for these sessions, you must indicate this in the corresponding place on the paper submission form. For those sessions that include a discussant (EvaluAES, EEconAES and AESEC sessions), authors commit to submit their full manuscript/draft by June 5, 2024. If your paper is not selected for one of these sessions, it will be evaluated in the general group of papers. In the form you will find more information for each interest group.\n\nAccepted abstracts will be published in the digital edition of the abstract book with ISBN.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nAuthors may describe any financial or personal relationship which can cause a conflict of interest regarding this article.\n\nPROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS AND ANIMALS IN RESEARCH\n\nWhen experiments which have been carried out on human beings are described, it is essential to indicate whether the procedures followed comply with the ethical standards of the human experimentation committee responsible (institutional or regional), and in accordance with the World Medical Association and the Declaration of Helsinki.
