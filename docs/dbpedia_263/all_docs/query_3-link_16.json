        "text": "The Autumn Journey of Red Drum\n\nCool mornings this week reminded everyone fall is just around the corner. This subtle change in temperature inspires many of us to behave differently. It’s actually enjoyable to be outside again. Now, it’s easier to relax and drink a morning cup of pumpkin spice coffee on the porch or maybe take a brisk evening walk. These slightly cooler days not only announce the end of the dog days of summer but cue the natural world.\n\nOne of the most fascinating stories in nature unfolds this time of year. Red Drum or Redfish (Sciaenops ocellatus) are some of the most well-known and easily identified predators of the bay flats and marshes – But did you know these prized game fish can tell time? They don’t have calendars or watches but sense changes in water temperature and to the length of daylight : night time hours. Our calendar says September while their calendar says time to feed, migrate, and reproduce.\n\nIn the fish world, reproduction is known as spawning. It takes about three to four growing seasons for a red drum to mature and spawn. A mature four-year-old fish is about 28-inches in total length from head to tip of the tail. This size fish is critical to the continuation of the red drum population. This is one of the main reasons why fisheries managers regulate the number of 27 or 28-inch red drum caught. Limiting the number of this size redfish supports sustainable recruitment so there will be fish for years to come. Learn more about red drum fishing regulations by visiting Florida Fish and Wildlife at http://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/recreational/red-drum\n\nWhen mature, red drum leave the nursery grounds of back bays and bayous and move to inlets and passes. This time of year, groups of spawning red drum may occur in entrances of the bay.\n\nNotable members of Sciaenid or drum fish family include red drum, black drum, Atlantic croaker, and seatrout. Males have muscle fibers they vibrate against their swim bladder. The swim bladder is a hollow air filled sac fish use for buoyancy or depth control. When the muscle “strikes” the hollow sac a drum or drumming noise is created. The larger the fish the greater potential for noise. Male red drum often drum while spawning which generally occurs from sunset to sunrise.\n\nIn red drum hatcheries, light and temperature mimic the outside world and control spawning to support stock enhancement programs. In the hatchery, the drumming noise is loud and sounds like a bass drum being struck in rapid succession for about 10 seconds and then repeated. In the natural environment, Sciaenid drumming is so distinctive that researchers use hydrophones to locate and study fish species like seatrout and red drum.\n\nWhile some fish species take care of their young and produce a few nurtured offspring, red drum overwhelm the odds of survival through shear numbers. During the two month spawning season, red drum spawning aggregations can produce millions of eggs each night. According to Louisiana Sea Grant, one female red drum can produce 1.5 million eggs in one night or 20-40 million per female each spawning season!\n\nSpawning also occurs at the height of tropical storm season. Red drum eggs float on a tiny droplet of biologically produced oil that can be carried long distances by wind, waves, and water. In successful recruitment years, eggs and hatching red drum larvae make a journey into the most protected and productive portions of the bay or estuary in less than a week. Seagrass and submerged shoreline grass provide cover and protection. After rain and storms, adjacent land provides nutrients that naturally fertilize the bay waters. In response, algae and zooplankton bloom just in time to create the perfect first fish food for hatching red drum. The timing of red drum reproduction and survival is precise and elegant!\n\nJuvenile red drum spend their next three to four-years growing to spawning adults, before migrating and starting the reproduction cycle over again.\n\nQuick Facts: According to Texas Parks and Wildlife the oldest red drum ever recorded is 37 years old. The state record in Florida for red drum landed is just over 52 pounds and was caught near Cocoa in Brevard County, FL. A red drum caught in 1984 off the North Carolina coast holds the world record for largest red drum ever caught, 94 pounds!\n\nAn Equal Opportunity Institution.

This is about ten degrees cooler than in normal years. Fish have a tolerance to temperature but when air and water temperatures decrease rapidly, fish kills may occur.\n\nFish kills due to cold weather are naturally occurring phenomena. In some cases there may be an ecological benefit. Exotic fish species that have adapted to Florida’s subtropical climate may not be able to withstand these colder temperatures and large numbers of the populations may be eliminated. The decrease in the population of exotic species may allow for an increase in native populations.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s (FWC) Fish Kill Hotline provides maps of fish kills throughout the state on a monthly basis. If you see a fish kill you can report it by phone: 1-800-636-0511 or online.\n\nThe FWC Fish Kill Website also allows the user to report fish kills and search the current database for fish kills by dates, county and possible causes of fish kills.

Estimate how many 10’ x 10’ areas would fit into the total area, and multiply that number by the number of fish in the original 10’ x 10’ area. This will give you an estimate of the total number of fish.\n\nMake a note of the weather conditions the past few days, air temperature, rainfall, cloud cover, wind strength and directions. Talk to your neighbors to determine if they have noticed anything unusual about the waterbody in the last few days.\n\nFor more information on understanding and reporting fish kills check out this publication from the University of Florida IFAS Extension:\n\n“Sea”sons Greetings!\n\nMany marine species have festive holiday names. Jingle Shells, Pinecone Fish, Red Drum, Marine Snow, and Christmas Tree Worms are just a few.\n\nPinecone Fish get their name as result of their armored plates called scutes. The scutes have ridges which cause the fish to resemble a pinecone. Pinecone fish are native to warm waters of the Indoneasion and Western Pacific Oceans.\n\nPinecone fish feed on zooplankton which they attract using bioluminescent organs that are found on each side of their lower jaw. The organs form a symbiotic relationship with phosphorescent bacteria that live with the fish. The bioluminescence can be turned on and off by movement of the jaw.\n\nPinecone fish can be found in areas that have caves, ledges and rocky bottoms.\n\nChristmas Tree Worms are Christmas tree shaped worms that form burrows corals. The tentacles, which form the tree-like structures are used for feeding on plankton and to breathe. These plumed creatures are a type of polychaete worm.\n\nChristmas tree worms come in many colors and can be found all over the world. They feed by using their feathery appendages, called radioles to capture phytoplankton that floats by the “feathers.”\n\nChristmas tree worms are easily disturbed and will quickly vanish into their burrows as shadows or larger marine life pass by. They return quickly and continue with their sedentary lifestyles in the coral.\n\nOne of our local favorites, the Red Drum is named as result of the drumming sound with speciliazed muscels that rub against their air bladder. Click here now to hear the sound.\n\nRed drum feed on crabs, shrimp and small fish. They are bottom feeders, and sometime expose their tails to the surface of the water while they feed. This is known as “tailing”.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=780x9s9SrRY\n\nRed drum or redfish can be found in shallow waters of bays and bayous. They have characteristic black spots on the tail fin; the number varies on each fish. They are a delicious fish when cooked and put up a good fight when caught.\n\nMarine Snow gets its name as a result of the fluffy materials that resemble snow falling from the sky. Marine snow is decaying material from plants and animals that have died in the oceans. Marine snow may also include sand, fecal matter and inorganic dust.\n\nJust like snowflakes, marine snow grows as it floats to the ocean depths. Marine snow is consumed by scavengers that live along the deep sea floor bottom. Check out the video below showing the beauty of marine snow.\n\nJingle Shells get their name as a result of their shells that when shaken together make a jingle like sound. Jingle shells can be found along the beaches of NW Florida. The shiny iridescent shell is strong and very attractive. Many shell collectors use the shells to make jewelry and wind chimes.\n\nJingle shells are bivalves and live attached to hard surfaces, just like oysters.\n\nJingle shells are filter feeders, meaning water is filtered through their gills for plankton.\n\nReferences and More Information:\n\nhttp://www.edc.uri.edu/restoration/html/gallery/invert/jingle.htm\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocentridae\n\nhttp://www.edc.uri.edu/restoration/html/gallery/invert/jingle.htm\n\nhttp://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/marinesnow.html\n\nhttp://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=543#.UNDa6uT7K8A"
