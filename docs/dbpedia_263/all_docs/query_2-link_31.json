        "text": "ST. CLOUD, Minn. – (RV) St. Cloud State Baseball begins their 2023 campaign with a trip to Joplin, Missouri this weekend to square off with Southwest Baptist and Missouri Southern State. The Huskies celebrate Opening Day on Friday with a noon start against Southwest Baptist followed by a 3:00 p.m. CT tilt against Missouri Southern State, meeting the Bearcats again on Saturday at 3:00 p.m. then closing out the weekend with a 11:00 a.m. start against the Lions. All four games will be played at Missouri Southern's Warren Turner Field, providing SCSU with two neutral-site games and a pair of true road matchups.\n\nBROADCAST INFORMATION\n\nAll four games will be broadcast on the MIAA Network with live stats provided by Missouri Southern State. Fans can find links to each coverage option online on the SCSU Baseball schedule page as well as following the Huskies on social media.\n\nLOOKING BACK\n\nSt. Cloud State went 37-13 in 2022, finishing second in the Northern Sun and just missing the NCAA Tournament. The Huskies' pitching staff fired nine complete games, logged six shutouts and threw a pair of no-hitters including a perfect game thrown by Luke Tupy on April 21 – just the 28th perfect game in NCAA DII history. Transfer second baseman Sam Riola earned NSIC and Central Region Player of the Year honors after slashing .429/.533/.890 for a 1.423 OPS, setting a new program record with 22 home runs while driving in 66 and stealing 30 bases – becoming one of just two DII players to homer 20-plus times with 30-plus stolen bases in 2022. Tate Wallat earned an ABCA/Rawlings National Gold Glove at third base while hitting .368 and scoring 50 runs. Centerfielder John Nett hit .359 with 17 doubles, 15 steals and a .975 OPS to anchor the top of the lineup. Tupy went 6-1 with a 1.37 ERA, striking out 76 over 46.0 innings to earn NSIC Freshman of the Year and All-American honors alongside Riola. Ethan Lanthier added an All-Region nod in his true freshman season, going 5-0 with a 2.43 ERA and 48 strikeouts in 33.1 innings out of the bullpen. Ryan Duffy signed a professional contract with the Fargo-Moorhead Redhawks after the season to become the 28th Husky under Dolan to play professional baseball.\n\nBIG RIG GETS THE ROCK\n\nGraduate student and captain Riley Ahern will get the ball on Opening Day against Southwest Baptist, making his first career Opening Day start. Ahern is the fourth different hurler to start game one for St. Cloud State since Dominic Austing made back-to-back Opening Day starts in 2018 and 2019, following Matt Osterberg (2020), Mack Larson (2021) and Trevor Koenig (2022). Entering his sixth season with the program, Ahern served as the Huskies' No. 2 starter last season behind phenom Luke Tupy and led the staff in wins (6), innings pitched (59.2) and games started (10). Ahern hasn't faced Missouri Southern in his career but has made a start at Warren Turner Field - dealing 5.0 scoreless against Missouri Western in his first start of the 2020 season, striking out seven while earning NSIC Pitcher of the Week honors for his efforts.\n\nSTARTING OFF RIGHT\n\nThe Huskies are seeking a return to early season success after back-to-back disappointing openings, beginning 2022 just 1-4 after dropping their first three contests of 2021. Both sluggish starts featured key regional losses that ultimately played significant factors in the team missing the NCAA Tournament. Historically, SCSU has had great success opening seasons under the direction of Pat Dolan. Fans will remember the Huskies opening both 2015 and 2016 with 23 consecutive wins, followed by 9-3 and 4-1 starts to 2017 and 2018. The 2019 Huskies opened 12-1 then the 2020 edition enjoyed a 6-1 start to their pandemic-shortened season.\n\nDOLAN'S DUGOUT – QUOTING HEAD COACH PAT DOLAN\n\n\"With this unbelievably good weather we have in the Husky Dome and the Huskies playing good baseball these first four weeks, I'm just really looking forward to getting the heck out of the dome. We've had some really great experiences and great trips down to Joplin, they've always taken care of us, and it looks like Mother Nature is going to work well for us with weather in the 50's. The guys have been practicing well and it's time to start playing baseball.\"\n\n\"Everybody's 0-0. Everybody wants to win the first game, everybody wants to win every game. It starts with our seniors and our captains - we have really good senior leadership and really good captains. They bring the energy. When you have good leadership with your captains and seniors, it really makes coaching a lot easier.\"\n\n\"It's two years in a row now that we didn't start the season by winning the majority of our games, and it's really hurt us in the regional side of things - these are big regional games that we're playing the first two weekends with Missouri Southern and Arkansas Monticello, and I think this group of seniors and captains know the importance of starting out and not just playing well, but winning. We've done it for 15 years where we've started off winning a lot of games and playing well, and it sets our teams up pretty well. With that said, we dug ourselves in a hole and came back to win almost 20 games in a row - it says a lot about the commitment of this team. They're hungry and they're humble, and I think we're going to come out and have a really good season. Hopefully it starts off well this weekend.\"\n\n\"It's not rocket science - if we pitch well and pound the zone, make plays defensively which we traditionally have, you're going to be in most games. You do that, and you get some timely hitting. Again, it's not rocket science, but teams who do that usually win games. You always want to win series. Hopefully we can start out and come back 3-1 and not 1-3 like we have the last couple of years.\"\n\nSERIES HISTORY\n\nSCSU's first two opponents of 2023 are Southwest Baptist and Missouri Southern State. The Huskies have never met the Bearcats and own a 4-3 edge in the all-time series against MSSU with their last win coming in memorable fashion at the 2019 Warrensburg Regional. Down 9-3 after five innings in the elimination bracket against Missouri Southern, St. Cloud State scored seven unanswered punctuaded by a game-tying Toran Shahidi home run before Aaron Hammann scored the go-ahead run on a wild pitch as Najee Gaskins took ball four in the eighth inning. Legendary two-time All-American southpaw Sheldon Miks earned his final win as a Husky in the comeback victory, grinding through 8.0 innings of relief while striking out six and scattering 11 hits. The two sides met the following season in Joplin with Missouri Southern earning a 13-1 win over SCSU, holding the Huskies to just three hits while blasting four home runs.\n\nNATIONAL NOTICE\n\nSt. Cloud State received votes in the 2023 National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Preseason Top-25 poll, entering the season in the polls for the first time since they began 2019 recieving votes.\n\nREGIONAL RECOGNITION\n\nThe Huskies were also tabbed sixth the 2023 NCBWA Preseason Central Region Poll, becoming one of three NSIC programs to be featured in the preseason rankings. Southern Arkansas tops the poll with 12 of 15 first place votes, earning 145 points. Central Missouri earned two first place votes and placed second with 128 points while Augustana added the final top vote to take third with 120 points. Minnesota State-Mankato is fourth with 104 points while Henderson State is fifth with 87 and St. Cloud State places sixth with 60. Northeastern State's 58 points place them seventh with Pittsburg State (50), Oklahoma Baptist (34) and Washburn (13) occupying the final three spots.\n\nOH CAPTAINS, OUR CAPTAINS\n\nHuskies Baseball is captained by four program veterans in graduate student Riley Ahern, redshirt senior Sam Riola and a pair of juniors in John Nett and Jack Habeck. The four share 12 combined years of experience at St. Cloud State as Ahern enters his sixth season, Nett and Habeck each start their fourth and Riola begins his second with the program.\n\nFor all the latest on St. Cloud State Baseball, stay tuned to SCSUHuskies.com and follow the team on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram."
