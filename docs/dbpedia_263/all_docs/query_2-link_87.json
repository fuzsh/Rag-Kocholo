        "text": "Why does this one make me giggle? 15\n\nChikage is trying to reduce our pile of old photos. For some reason she doesn’t think we need umpteen dozen photos of random landscapes with no people, or twenty-three poorly framed shots of the same individual in one location. I don’t remember owning any clothing resembling these shown below. Nor do I remember ever being so skinny. I do remember the ‘stache, but it’s Riola that made me laugh out loud: I even came across some slides (no projector, so forgive the poor quality from just holding them up in my back yard): Who is that in the middle with the light blue sweater? And where do you suppose that was shot?! Hope all are well. — Rex\n\nStarted by Rex Walters @ · Most recent @\n\nRod's Celebration-of-Life 4\n\nDear Friends, The MacLellans hosted a wonderful celebration-of-life for Rod last night. I felt the presence of Rod in the love and warmth that was shared! As Christine had planned, they had friends sharing stories inside and outside and moving between both, a fire pit going on the back deck, and food and drinks. Without previous rehearsal, son Derek read a beautiful eulogy previously composed by Christine and some long-time friends of Rod from New Hampshire. That Derek had to periodically hold back tears illustrated how wonderfully that eulogy resonated and added a special poignancy that helped me tap into my still confused emotions. Many of us then had a shot each of bourbon to toast Rod. The entire event could not have been more in touch with Rod - I know he was pleased. It was wonderful to see Christine, Derek, Ian, and Taylor, Christine’s sister Caron, so many long-time friends and meet some new ones. Several had travelled from great distances to attend. That individuals from around the world have expressed condolences and shared stories of love for Rod illustrates how universally loved he was and still an eternal part of everyone that knows him. Love, Mike Note: Amy Little was so kind to take many photos; I hope to share as she shares them.\n\nStarted by Michael Tjebben @ · Most recent @\n\nRod MacLellan passed away of a heart attack on January 3rd.... 8\n\nDear Friends, From some FaceBook posts I made: Dear Friends of Rod, I spoke to Christine MacLellan this evening (2022_01_07). She appears to be doing well given her close family and many nearby friends rallying around her at this time. Her sons are with her now - helping with logistics, processing things and sorting. She even joked that she found enough gum that Rod would chew while working that it could fill a 2’x3’ box! As for some sort of memorial service, she is thinking about doing something unconventional - like Rod would have liked. She mentioned sitting around a campfire, sipping some bourbon and shooting off some rockets that Rod had. This does sound very “Rod-like” to me. She isn’t sure about timing - if people are considering traveling, she’d plan it to accommodate such. Their oldest son, Derek, will be there for 3 weeks, hence, my guess is that sometime within the next 3 weeks would be helpful. I told her I’d reach out to everyone to understand what might work for those that would like to travel for such an event. Please let me know in a private message what “range” of times might work, if you’d like to come, and I will feed that information back to her and the boys. It is very sad that Rod died of a heart attack at such a young age; such ran in his family. We are fortunate that we knew such a wonderful man for the time we had with him. Kind regards, Mike Michael@... Michael O. Tjebben Author Christine called and spoke to Karen while I was outside working. The MacLellans are homing in on sometime during the weekend of January 21st, 2023.\n\nStarted by Michael Tjebben @ · Most recent @\n\nRemember when the ATMs opened in Itami?\n\nI just saw someone complaining about banking in Japan. Anyone remember how much of a PITA it was to get money out of the bank when we were over there? Noplace took checks or credit cards back then, everything was cash only, but the bank was only open 9-4 (and even closed for lunch IIRC). Literally had to sneak away from work and take the bus round trip to Itami just to get cash. Then we saw the construction as they started installing ATMs in the front lobby. Hooray! When the construction was finally finished, the ATM hours were 15:00 to 17:00 M-F!! They gave us one more hour of access but still only during working hours. All you could do was laugh.

Time to actually schedule a zoom call to see how much everyone has aged. Except me, of course, I haven't changed at all in <mumble> years. I could still fit into my old Mitsubishi jacket if I wasn't allergic to polyester, I'm sure of it. Preferences for timing? I suspect we've got people in most US timezones, European timezones, and maybe one or two in Japan. I think most of us would prefer weekends, so I'd suggest scheduling the first of two calls on Saturday 9/10 at noon California time (3PM east coast US, 8PM-ish in the UK and Germany). Anyone working in Japan will be used to going to bed around 4a.m. so it should work for everyone. Please at least reply with your current location/timezone, and whether 9/10 works. We'll schedule another for those that can make the first (inevitable that not everyone will be able to join no matter what day/time we pick). I thought the list would be quiet, but not THIS quiet! You can just reply to this message or send to kmelco-eighties@groups.io if you'd like to send a note to the group. I think I might need to approve any messages the first time you send them, so be patient (subsequent ones should just go through). You can also read all unread and past messages on the groups.io website at https://groups.io/g/kmelco-eighties/messages I'm very much looking forward to seeing all of you!
