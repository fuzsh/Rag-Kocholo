This grain is typical to Sardinia and best serves with a delicious clam sauce.\n\nFlights from Rome to Sardinia\n\nDoes anyone know if RyanAir is the only airline that flies from Rome to Sardinia, direct.\n\nHi, I am starting the process of building a simple minimalist studio space in Sardegna (no interiors walls, no bathroom and just a small kitchen) and I am looking for a good and trustworthy Geometra. I was wondering if anyone here had a good experience and could recommend one."
