        "text": "The 2024 season of TM moto – Steels Dr Jack also kicked off with the Internazionali d’Italia MX. The Riola Sardo track was certainly an excellent testing ground, the track with its sandy surface is one of the most selective in Europe.\n\nYago Martinez engaged in MX2, and Brando Rispoli in 125 faced the time trials on Sunday morning with a great desire to start the year well.\n\nAt the end of the round, a 15th place for Yago and a 9th for Brando, very close to those ahead of them on times.\n\nYago started well at the start of race one of the MX2 and in the early stages was close to the top ten. It’s a shame that a crash on the second lap caused him to lose ground and forced him to remain at the back until the checkered flag, finishing in 18th position. The second heat never started for him due to the crash he suffered in race one. In agreement with the team it was decided not to take risk of further injury so as not to compromise his preparation for the next commitments. In the general classification he now occupies 22nd position.\n\nBrando started the first heat of the 125 with an excellent start but at the first corner in the melee he was hit and fell, then having to start from the back of the group. After a couple of laps he had to retire because he had damaged the bike in contact with the ground and his competitors and it was not possible to continue. In the second heat he repeated his good start, he was in the top five after the first corner, but this time everything went well and he was able to set his pace even if he had to manage until the finish line due to a small technical problem. For him at the finish line an excellent sixth place and the awareness of being able to be among the protagonists on future occasions. In the standings after this test he occupies 14th position overall.\n\nNext and last appointment for these Internazionali d’Italia MX next weekend in Mantua.\n\nYAGO MARTINEZ: “After the first race of the year is over, let’s collect all the positive information and see you in Mantua to do even better! We are ready, we just have to put all the pieces of the puzzle together and good results will surely come!”\n\nBRANDO RISPOLI: “The first round of the Internazionali d’Italia MX was unlucky. Qualifying started well, despite not being in the top five the feeling with the track was very good to face the heats. Unfortunately both were ruined by technical problems In race one I had to retire after the fall while in the second heat I did half the heat with a spark plug breaking down, despite the problem I managed to finish in sixth position. I am satisfied with the work done on the bike, we are at a good point both in terms of both suspension and engine, physically I’m responding very well. I would like to thank TM racing, Ivano Zanatta, Simone Lorenzoni and above all Mario Resti, see you in Mantua.”"
