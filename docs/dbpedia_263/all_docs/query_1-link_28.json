        "text": "#live4bethany On May 11, 2019, I lost my life at the age of 23-years-old because two young men decided to engage in an illegal street racing contest. My daughter Layla was only 6-years-old at the time, she was my pride and joy. She was my best friends and we did everything together, my little girl will ever understand why I am never coming home.\n\nI was a mother, sister, daughter, niece and good friend to many. I was adventurous, enjoyed trying new things, visiting new places and traveling. I enjoyed museums, hiking, taking long drives or listening to music all day long. I loved dying my hair unique colors which gave me the nick name ‚ÄúUnicorn‚Äù. I never cared about what others thought, I did what made me happy! My life was my journey and I lived it my way. I now fly with my own wings and guard my family night and day.\n\nMy Aunt ‚ÄúLori Argumedo‚Äù is the Outreach & Community Relations Director for Street Racing Kills, she joined the organization after my passing. When she laid me to rest she promised me she would keep my memory alive and that my death would not be in vain. She is passionate about preventing and creating awareness regarding the dangers of illegal street racing and traffic safety among the youth.\n\n#Live4Tony My youngest brother Tony Santillan was tragically taken from us at the young age of 19 in December 2002 because the person who was driving the car he was in decided to race another car! There were a total of 5 people in the car and my brother was killed! Our lives changed forever on December 28, 2002 due to the irresponsibility of one person who decided that it was okay to race another car. My brother Tony had just turned 19 on December 2nd, he had his whole life ahead of him. Tony was full of life and laughter, he was kind, loving, funny and very handsome ü•∞ his favorite foods were pizza, KFC and our mom‚Äôs spaghetti. He loved riding his bike and spending time with his friends. He would be the life of the party and always can make you laugh. We miss my brother so much and will forever keep his memory alive. ‚ô•\n\n#Live4Cerain Cerain and 2 of his friends was tragically taken from us way to soon from 2 street racers on August 3, 2021. Cerain and his friends were in a car making a left turn when 1 out of the 2 cars that were racing against each other, hit them. The car was racing down a 35 mph speed zone at an unimaginable speed. The speed of the cars that were racing was the major factor that took the lives of our babies. This careless act has left us devastated.!!!\n\nCerain we miss you like crazy. The world will never be the same because you are not here but I know you live on!!! We miss and love you so much. Fly high, my son.\n\nLove Mom\n\n#Live4Timmy Timothy Timmy I called him was a kind forgiving soul who never took a side in an argument and if he did you never knew it .. when it came to family at least. He was always trying to help everyone.. He was kind caring compassionate and a very sincere child and that is what he always was to me .. My first baby .. I was the older sister and his mom was only 14 when she had him .. so my mom and i had him most of the time till he was 10.. He had my heart from the day he was born ‚Ä¶ He loved learning.. loved art and music .. and culture.. I dont think Tim ever made an enemy on this earth‚Ä¶ The morning I found out he was gone it was like someone reached in me and ripped my heart from my chest.. there is a big gaping hole there now..I dont know how to go on .. but I need to tell his story i know he would want me to ‚Ä¶. An illegal street racing event took his life from me from us‚Ä¶ he was 34 starting a family and getting married to his high school sweetheart this year.. now the worst feeling is the emptiness‚Ä¶. not knowing hes on this earth anymore is killing me inside‚Ä¶ He is my Angel always was always will be ‚Ä¶.\n\n#Live4Raymond As a child I always strived to be a positive contribution to society. Despite being born and raised in south central where the odds of being successful are rare. I was an honors student in grade school and through college. I attended CAL-STATE LA where I studied Civil Engineering. I became a student Engineer juggling a work-life balance to be able to pay for my studies and not add another burden to my parents. My dream of becoming an engineer was more so to make my immigrant parents proud in hopes that I could someday own a construction company to provide well-paid jobs to those seeking the American dream. My biggest passion was cooking as a kid I always dreamed of being a culinary chef but my parent‚Äôs dreams came before mines. so I would still follow my passion by cooking for fun and for my family. One day I decided that I wanted the rest of the world to try my delicious creations so in my spare time I launched a small business named ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do Breakfast‚Äù which operated on my off days weekends and we would get preorders and sold out time after time. I was so motivated to one day open up a restaurant to the point that I came up with my logo‚Ä¶ a cartoon version of me. I enjoyed traveling so much and tasting foods from all the places I was given the opportunity to visit alongside of my high school sweetheart of 11 years Maria. Maria was my first and only love, the love of my life. For our tenth anniversary, I proposed to her in the most romantic way possible with the help of my family. We bought our first home and became fur parents. our wedding was scheduled for our 12th anniversary on 12/16/23 . 2023 was going to be the year we pursued our dream of parenthood, and that was our last goal on the list but unfortunately a reckless driver robbed me from my dream of being a husband and dad. My story must be heard because no one should be stripped away from their accomplishments. I had so many people depending on me like my parents, sisters, only brother which is autistic, my niece and 2 nephews that needed a role model like myself to guide them through life. As life can be challenging and full of bad influences. I am saddened that I lived life by the book with principles and morals consider myself a fair person that always stood by what was right but was stripped from all of my hard work and sacrifices by someone who was careless, self-centered, and had no regard to human life.\n\n#Live4Dalton&Tayler Dalton Lee Ford and Tayler Nicole Garza both 22 years old lost their lives on April 4, 2021 Easter Sunday Morning to siblings that were drag racing each other down a county road in Burnsville MN. The speed limit on that county road is 55 mph. 5 seconds before impact the vehicles with the 19 year old sister was going 107 mph in a chevy malibu and the other vehicle a white chrysler 200 which was driven by her brother and his twin sister were going 114 mph. At the time of impact, which was a T-Bone, splitting Dalton‚Äôs Honda CRV in half the white chrysler was going 100 mph. Dalton and Tayler were making a left hand turn to go through a Caribou Coffee. It was Easter Sunday Morning. They were then planning on coming back home to Prescott WI to visit with family that were still in town. You see, the last day we spent with Dalton and Tayler was my Dad‚Äôs funeral. Dalton‚Äôs Grandpa. He passed away on March 26th at the age of 83. I lost my father, son and future daughter in law in 9 days. My Dad had been in poor health. He lived a great life. Dalton and Tayler had just started theirs. The siblings were arrested that day. The 19 year old sister was tried as an adult. Went to a jury trial. Was found guilty. She was sentenced to 15 years. The prosecuting attorneys wanted 25. Should have been 25 for Dalton and 25 for Tayler. Her brother at the time was 80 shy of 18 years of age. On probation (3rd time) for assault and theft. He was certified as a juvenile. He spent 241 days in a juvenile facility in MN. He is currently out on probation until his 21st birthday which is June 2024. If he keeps his nose clean come that birthday it will be like it never happened. We are fighting for change. I will continue to fight for Dalton and Tayler."
