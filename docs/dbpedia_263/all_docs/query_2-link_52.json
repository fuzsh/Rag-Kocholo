        "text": "ST. CLOUD, Minn. – St. Cloud State Baseball (22-14, 14-7 NSIC) hits the road this week for a pair of key late-season series with a midweek tilt at Bemidji State (2-39, 1-25 NSIC) on Thursday followed by a Satuday/Sunday weekend set at Minnesota Duluth (15-22, 8-16 NSIC). The Huskies and Beavers open their Thursday doubleheader at 1:30 p.m. CT in Bemidji with Saturday's series-opening doubleheader in Duluth set to begin at 1:30 p.m. CT followed by a noon Sunday finale.\n\nBROADCAST INFORMATION\n\nBoth series will be broadcast on the NSIC Network with live stats provided by the host institution. Links to each coverage option can be found on the SCSU Baseball schedule page.\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\nGraduate righthander Riley Ahern struck out nine over 6.0 scoreless innings while redshirt junior Noah Dehne (1-for-2, R, HR, 3 RBI) blasted a three-run homer to lead St. Cloud State to a 5-0 shutout win over Mary on Monday afternoon at Joe Faber Field, closing out the home-opening weekend with a sweep. Ahern scattered five hits and three walks over 6.0 scoreless innings while matching his season-high with nine punchouts, earning his fifth win of the year. The captain threw a first-pitch strike to 22 of the 27 batters he faced (81.5%) and threw 71 of his 103 pitches for strikes, pounding the zone with his fastball. After Ahern fired scoreless frames in the first and second, Dehne clobbered a two-out three-run homer deep out to left in the home half to make it 3-0 SCSU. Two runs in the fifth – courtesy of a Drew Bulson (2-for-4, RBI) run-scoring single and a Drew Beier (1-for-2, BB, R, RBI SF) sacrifice fly – extended the Huskies lead to 5-0. David Van Ort worked around a walk to record a scoreless seventh, then Cooper Avery struck out a pair while retiring three of four in the eighth. Ethan Lanthier closed out the Huskies' fifth shutout of the season, fanning two in a scoreless ninth. Sam Riola (1-for-2, 2 BB, R, SB) reached base three times in the win while Sawyer Smith (0-for-2, BB, HBP, R) walked and was hit by a pitch to extend his on-base streak to 18 games.\n\nSTANDINGS & SUCH\n\nThe Huskies enter the week fourth in the NSIC standings, two and a half games behind Minnesota Crookston. Each of SCSU's next three series are against opponents residing among the bottom four spots in the conference standings with the regular season finale featuring current No. 8 seed Wayne State - providing the Huskies with a prime opportunity to continue climbing the standings.\n\nSCOUTING THE BEAVERS\n\nBemidji State stumbles into the series having lost 20 straight games and owning a 2-39 record, 1-25 in conference play. The Beavers own a -323 run differential this season and are averaging just 3.76 runs per game while pitching to a 12.17 ERA. First baseman Jack Munson has been the bright spot in the lineup, slashing .324/.360/.583 for a .943 with nine doubles, three triples, seven homers and 27 RBI while catcher Derek Dolezal is reaching base at a .453 clip.\n\nSCOUTING THE BULLDOGS\n\nMinnesota Duluth stands at No. 12 in the NSIC standings entering the week, going 15-22 this spring with an 8-16 conference record. Second baseman Ethan Cole slashes .353/.432/.605 for a 1.037 OPS with eight doubles, six homers and 27 RBI to highlight the order alongside three-bagger Gabe Richardson (.321 BA, .903 OPS, 5 HR, 26 RBI). Lefthander Brayden Buttweiler is 3-2 with a 3.31 ERA across seven starts, striking out 40 and walking just nine over 32.2 innings of work and has formed a strong top of the rotation alongside righthander Zach Kuseke (2-2, 3.77 ERA, 31.0 IP, 21:10 K:BB).\n\nREADY SET RIOLA\n\nRedshirt senior second baseman and righthanded pitcher Sam Riola was named the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference Player of the Week on Tuesday following his incredible performance in St. Cloud State's weekend sweep of Mary. Riola went 7-for-10 (.700) at the plate with five runs scored, a double, two home runs and five RBI while slashing .700/.750/1.400 for a ridiculous 2.150 OPS in the three game set. The All-American opened the series with back-to-back three-hit contests while homering twice in the opener. He started game two on the mound and exited in line for the win before ultimately taking a no-decision, striking out nine over 6.0 innings of four-hit ball. In the month of April, Riola is hitting .519 (28-for-54) with six doubles, a triple, seven home runs and 18 RBI while going six-for-seven on steals. The SCSU standout is slashing .519/.594/1.056 this month for a whopping 1.650 OPS.\n\nTHE TABLE IS SET\n\nJunior centerfielder John Nett is enjoying a phenomenal campaign leading off a potent Huskies lineup that leads the NSIC in runs per game, batting average and on-base percentage while ranking top-four in nearly every major category. Nett is slashing .430/.512/.634 for a 1.146 OPS with 40 runs scored, 16 doubles, two triples, three home runs and 37 RBI. Entering the weekend, Nett leads the NSIC in batting average, hits and doubles while ranking second in on-base percentage and fifth in stolen bases.\n\nAN APRIL FOR THE AGES\n\nRedshirt senior Sam Riola has settled into an incredible hot streak over the month of April, slashing .519/.594/1.056 through 14 games for a 1.650 OPS. Riola has scored 22 runs and driven in 18 while bashing six doubles, a triple and seven home runs this month in addition to going six-for-seven on stolen bases. The second baseman has struck out just twice in 64 plate appearances for a 3.1% K rate while drawing nine walks at a 14.1% clip. On the mound this month, Riola is 1-1 with a 3.79 ERA and a 26:5 K:BB ratio over 19.0 innings of work.\n\nA MODERN-DAY WARRIOR\n\nSophomore shortstop Sawyer Smith owns a team-best 18 game on-base streak entering the week, slashing .355/.474/.468 for a .942 OPS over that stretch. Smith has scored 21 runs over his last 18 games while smashing four doubles and a home run, owning a 6:9 K:BB ratio in that span.\n\nPUT THE BALL IN PLAY, GOOD THINGS HAPPEN\n\nSt. Cloud State's lineup has been at the forefront of their success this season, currently leading the NSIC in runs per game, batting average and on-base percentage. A major factor has been the additional stat the club leads the league in - strikeout rate. SCSU has punched out in just 13.3% of their trips to the plate this season, a full 4.0% better than the next-lowest club. As expected with such a strong approach, four Huskies currently rank within the league's top seven in on-base percentage.\n\nCUE THE FIREMAN\n\nSophomore righthander Ethan Lanthier has been a key piece since his move back to the bullpen, logging a 3.12 ERA over five appearances with two hold. The flamethrower has struck out 12 while walking three across 8.2 innings of work, holding opponents to a .556 OPS with just one extra-base hit.\n\nPRO HUSKIES CHECK-IN\n\nHuskies alumni Nick Anderson and Matt Osterberg have each opened their professional seasons. As of April 21, Anderson has made 10 appearances out of the Atlanta Braves bullpen with a 4.22 ERA, three holds and a save. The righthander has fanned 14 across 10.2 innings while allowing just nine hits and walking one. Matt Osterberg has made three starts with High-A Jersey Shore, boasting a 3.38 ERA with 10 strikeouts in 13.1 innings of work.\n\nFor all the latest on St. Cloud State Baseball, stay tuned to SCSUHuskies.com and follow the team on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram."
