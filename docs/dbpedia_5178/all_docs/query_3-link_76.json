        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — Father John Patrick Boyle, OCSO died on Aug. 13. He was 94.\n\nFr. Pat, as he was known, was one of the Trappist monks who lived for years at the Abbey of Our Lady of the Holy Trinity just outside Huntsville. When the abbey was founded, it had 32 monks; in its heyday it held 84 monks and novices, but that number dwindled over the years until the abbey closed its doors in 2017.\n\nWith the closure of the abbey, Fr. Pat and the few other remaining monks moved to the senior apartments at St. Joseph Villa in Salt Lake City.\n\nJohn Patrick Boyle was born in St. Louis on April 8, 1928 to Ed and Mary Delahunty Boyle, both from Ireland. Fr. Pat felt a call to the priesthood at age 11. He completed a philosophy degree at Kendrick Seminary College, and in 1950 he entered the monastery in Huntsville. There he served as community sacristan and also was sometimes assigned to the summer farm work, handling hay bales with the other monks. He was ordained a priest in 1967 and over the years became a popular counselor and confessor.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial was celebrated Aug. 18 at St. Ann Catholic Church in Salt Lake City. Bishop Oscar A. Solis presided at the Mass; concelebrants included several priests of the Diocese of Salt Lake City as well as Father David Altman, OCSO, a former abbot at the abbey.\n\nThe church was filled to capacity with all the friends Fr. Pat had met through his more than 70 years as a monk.\n\n“I loved this very special and loving man with all my heart. I’m sure he is happy where he is now. God broke the mold with him,” said Leslie McKenzie in a tribute to Fr. Pat.\n\nBishop Solis recalled Fr. Pat as a true shepherd of God, “especially here in the diocese of Salt Lake City. … He was a light for other people … that lived with and in the simplicity of Christ.”\n\nIn his homily, Fr. David compared Fr. Pat’s life to that of a saint.\n\n“Many people have told me that Fr. Pat was a saint, and after having lived with Fr. Pat for 50 years, I know that is true,” Fr. David said, and proceeded to reflect on some of Fr. Pat’s characteristics.\n\n“He gave us an exemplary model, he was an extraordinary teacher, a wonder worker or source of benevolent power, an intercessor. He had a life often refusing material attachments or comforts,” Fr. David said.\n\nRecalling the life of the monks in the monastery, Fr. David said that Fr. Pat was able to create extraordinary relationships.\n\n“The most remarkable one is the one that he taught us to have the relationship with ourselves,” Fr. David said, adding that Fr. Pat was a holy man because “he persevered with patience in prayer.”\n\nThanking Fr. Pat for a life of companionship, friendship, love, wisdom and his support, Fr. David said that it was time to give back to the other monk what he gave for all: “A life of prayers; now we can pray for him.”\n\nIn conclusion, he said, “Christ is not limited by time or space, so now Fr. Pat is not limited either.”\n\nAfter the Mass a funeral procession accompanied Fr. Pat to his eternal resting place on the Huntsville monastery grounds."
