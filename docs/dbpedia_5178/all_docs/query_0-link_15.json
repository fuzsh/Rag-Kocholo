Much has been omitted for the sake of brevity from the account of the older generations, which might, if inserted, have elucidated the evidence for the genealogical deduction ; and it has not been thought necessary to cite authority for statements referring to recent times. It now seems probable that it niaj' be found necessaiy still further to abridge the article before insertion. I therefore print it as it stands, in order that a record may be preserved of all the facts which I have been able to verify, with the references to the authorities that prove them ; and I think it well to use the type and form adopted in the Scots Peerage. IJ. E. B. November 1904. .u .;i .11 .um THE BOYLES OF KELBURNE, EARLS OF GLASGOW There seems to be no doubt tliat the lands of Kelburne in OunningViam were lield by aucestoi'S of the Earls of Glasgow for many years before 1292, when tlie great flefs of Largs and Cunningham, whieh came to John Baliol from Devorgilla his motlier, l)eeame merged in tlie Crown of Scotland; but tlie records of their tenure have tiisappeared : and for long afterwards the succession to the lands can only bo inferred from the occasional occurrence, in records and charters, of the name and designation of Eoyle of Kelburne. Sir George Mackenzie, who died in 1692, mentions as extant in liis time a 'sasine of the lands of Kelburne given to ]?ichard Boil, eldest son to Boil of Kelburn and Marjory Cumin his wyfe, daugliter to ■ Cumin of Ilowallen, and this was in the reign of K. Al. 3,' (i.e. between 1249 and 1285-8G).' Sir William Mure of Kowallan, who wrote in or before 1057, mentions a charter of certain lands in tlie fee of Kowallan granted by Gilclirist Mor in favour of Avi(;ia his (luugiiter and the heirs of her body,'' wliicli was confirmed between 1358 and 1370, by Robert, Steward of Scotland, Earl of Stratherne. The original dates from before tlie year 1300. A transumpt of the charter of conlirmation was made on 21 January 1519 by decreet of the Lords of Council, at the instance of John Boyle of Kelburne.^ Under the same decreet was transumed another ciiarter of confirmation by Robert the Steward, of a charter conveying an annualrent to be uplifted from the lands of Malderland, lying in the tenandry of Roualeyn, granted by Walter Cumin, Dominus de Roualeyn, in favour of Richard de Boill, Dominus del Calburne, from which it appears that the granter and his predecessors had been accustomed to receive the rent from the grantee and his predecessors (anteccssores).* This charter by Walter Cumin, which has been assigned to the reign of King David II. (i.e. 1329-1370-71),' but which, it is now thought, may date from the end of that of Robert i., has been engraved in foe simile from the Kelburne Charter-chest.\" Sir William Mure says that the grantee 'is supposed (& not vnprobably) to have obtained in mariage the forsaid Anicia, and with her the lands forsaids disponed to her by Sir Gilchrist, being certaiulie the lands of I'olruskane as is evident frojn the bounding marches designed in the cliartcr, whicli lands were biuiked by the successors of the said Riteliard for payment of ane pound of Comine Seed in name of Blenscli ferme yearlie from these times.' ' But it would seem more probable that Richard de Boill the grantee and Richard Boil the husband of Marjory Cumin, who appears in the sasine noted by Sir George Mackenzie,' were one and the same.

Possibly he married Avice Mure and thus brought Polruskane into liis family, witli wliom it remained, as tlid also Maldersland, mentioned in Walter Cumin's charter, until the year KJLi^.' Tliis Ilobert is identified by Crawfurd^ as the Robert de Boyville del Oounte de Are, who swore fealty to Edward i. of England at Berwick-on-Tweed 28 August 1290,* and who served on an inquisition p. m. held the same day rogardijig the succession to lands la Ayrshire/ His seal, ' S. Robti do Boy villa,' is still attaclied to the fragment of a homage, and bears a bull's head cahossed.' He is probably identical with the Kobert de Bowill who witnessed a charter of the thirteenth century granted by Hew Francis, Lord of Blair, to James Francis his son, which was transumed iu the year 1542 at tlie instance of David Blair of Adamton.' Richard de Boyvile of the same county ° is identified in Remarks on the Ragman Roll' and elsewhere as the ancestor of the Boyles of Rysholni, Par. Dairy. He is probably identical witli the Ricardus de Boyville who is nic;ntit)ned as a tenant under Fergus de Ardrossan, Knigiit, in a charter erecting certain lands pertaining to tlie latter into a free barony, temp. King Robert i. (1300-1320).'° The Boyles of Rysholm are said by Crawfurd to have been the fii-Kt cadets of Kelburne;\" but the precise connection cannot be traced. Hugo Boyl, Dominus de Kj'sliolm, made a grant in free alms to the Abbey of Paisley, 7 February 139'J.'- The superiority of Kysholm afterwards became vested in tlie Lords Boyd, as proprietors of tlie barony of Dairy. '■* After the forfeiture of that family in 1 Hit) the lands were held in chief of the Crown by the Boyles,\" w ho also held in chief the barony of Wamphray in Annandale.'^ The family failed in the person of John liu) le of Wamphray and Rysholm, whose daughter and heir, Kathcrine Boyle, was married, last, willi- out issue, to John Johnstone, a cadet of the Johnstones of that Ilk,\"' and secondly, to Itolicrt .Scot,\" by whom she had a son and successor, also named Robert, who was infeft in the lands of Rysholm as heir to her, 10 November 1541.'\" He died before 10 January 15-1'J, when bis brother Adam, with his father's consent, sold Wamphray.''-' Katharine Boyle had died in 1'yJ.l.-\" Rysholm had, many years before, been granted in fen-farm to a kinsman or cadet of the tenant-in-chief, or possibly of the family of Kelburne. His succession also failed in the person of Archibald Boyle of liysholm, whose sister and heir, Kathcrine Boyle, parted in the year 1355 with all her lands to her well-beloveil kinsman and friend John Boyle, then of Rysholm,-' i.e. of Kelliuine.-- Ou 21 July 1117, John Boyle of Oaleburne sat at Irvine on an assize composed of the best and most trusty men of the country, to adjudicate, in presence ot Robert, iJiike of Albany, tiie (fovernor, on opposing claims to certain lauds.\" On 20 July 1133, Patrick (or Bir Patrick) Boil of Kelburne, witnessed a charter granted by Janet of Cairns, and dated at the Church of Largs.\" On 11 October 1110, Robert Boyle of Oalburn was witness to a sasine of the lands of Rysholm given by Robert Boyd, L(ird of Kilmarnock and Baron of Dairy, superior, to the noble man John Boyle of Wamphraj.\" This Robert was possibly succeeded by a son of the same Christian name, seeing that I.

Again, there is a tradition that a Laird of Kelburne was Icilleci 11 June 1488 at Saueliieburn, ligliting on the side of King James in. Orawfnnl, wlm is said to have liad access to the Kelburne Muniments, states this as a fact. He gives the Laird's name as John, and adds that the family estates were forfeited, and afterwards restored to his son.\" Hut no contemporaiy documents to this cileet are now at Kelburne ; and the books of Resijon.sions from 1 181 to 11!)-, whicli would douljtiess have demonstrated the truth or falsehood of the story, are mi.ssing fruin the Records, as are also their Indexes. It seems possible that the William who had sasine of Kelburne in or before 1177 may liave jierished at Sauchieburn, leaving a son of the same name, who may have beeji reinstated in the lands, and afterwards had the sasine of i;i July M!);i ; and that the second William may have dieil soon afterwards, and been succeeded by a brother or son (iv.) named John : or that the John killed at Saucliieburn(as staled by (Irawfurd) may have been the elder brother of the second William, and not Laird, but Younger of Kelburne. IV.

They were doubtles^s called as witnesses to the charter in question in their capacity as the next heirs after their nephew the grantee and his issue-male; and the notary inobably styled them 'sons natural' to empliasise the fact that they were 'sons of the body' of the granter. Their attestation implied, as was usual in such cases, consent to, and acknowledgment of, the succession setdcd by the charter. Their names occur very fieiiuently in the records, and in writs at Kelburne; but neither is ever designate 'son natural ' save in this one instance. Joha Boyle married Katherine Wallace before 8 April 1536.' C'rawfiiiil states tliat tliis lady (the wife of John Boyle, lirst of Bellikewin, 'lineal ancestor of Bellikewin the heir-male of the old house of Kelburne') was daugliter of Wallace of Cairnhill, aud widow of Pearstoun.' She was probably the Katharine Wallis wlio, with Bobert Barclay of Pearstoun her spouse, was grantee in a charter dated 15 September 1518.^ They had issue :— (1) John Boyle, designate as 'Younger of Ballikewin' 2'J September 1572' to 18 September 1583.* He succeeded his father, and died 20 August ISUD.\" He married, tirst, Jonet Cunningham, daughter of Alexander Cunningham of Toir, by Margaret Barclay,' by whom he had : — i.
