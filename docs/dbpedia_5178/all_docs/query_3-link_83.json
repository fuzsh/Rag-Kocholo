        "text": "“It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of our Chairman of the Board and friend, V. Richard (Dick) Miller.\n\nDick was a pioneer, a visionary, and a leader in the Long Term Care arena. He and the rest of the Miller family had the courage to follow their dreams and ignore those who said health care facilities wouldn’t survive in rural communities. Our great company stands stronger than ever today, and the facilities in large and small towns all around Indiana are a testament to the family’s willingness to go against the odds.\n\nDick will be greatly missed by all of us at Miller’s Health Systems. But we will continue to be inspired by his unwavering commitment to our patients, and to the employees who make such a difference in their lives. It is our hope that each day, the work we do will honor his legacy of service.”"
