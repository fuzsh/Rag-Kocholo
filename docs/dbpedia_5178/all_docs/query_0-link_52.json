Some quotations have been given punctuation to replace spaces in the manuscript text. The citation of sources uses a short title with a full title given in the bibliography. Notes give the pages of the article cited and are often followed by a ‘, p –’. giving the particular pages of interest. Not all individual items in larger collections have been separately noticed with a title in the bibliography; neither have some single manuscripts which are given headings and titles in the notes. They are simply too numerous but all the manuscript numbers have been given in the text and bibliography. All the dates begin the year at 1 January, as the Scots had done since 1600, and otherwise conform to the calendars in use in Britain – the Julian to 1752 and the Gregorian thereafter.\n\nM1143 EMERSON PRELIMS.qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:26\n\nPage xii\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nAPS ATCA AUL DAB DSB DSCHT EUL GUA GUL HMC LRCPE LRCP&SG LRCSE NAS NLS ODNB PCS RCSL RSE SAUL SCJ USA USL\n\nActs of the Parliament of Scotland Aberdeen Town Council Archive Aberdeen University Library Dictionary of American Biography Dictionary of Scientific Biography Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology Edinburgh University Library Glasgow University Archives Glasgow University Library Historical Manuscripts Commission Library of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh Library of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, Glasgow Library of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh National Archives of Scotland National Library of Scotland Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Principal Clerk of Session Royal College of Surgeons, London Royal Society of Edinburgh St Andrews University Library Senator of the College of Justice University of Strathclyde Archives University of Strathclyde Library\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPart I Preliminaries\n\nPage 1\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 2\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 3\n\n1 INTRODUCTION 1\n\n1. PATRONAGE AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT Accounts of enlightenments deal too much with ideas while ignoring improvements and those who made them. We read about thinkers and artists who are said to have made or contributed to enlightenments but our accounts exclude too much of the social context and too many of those who shaped it. We particularly lack accounts of the patrons who made successful careers possible and who found it in their interests to further the work of improvers and the enlightened. One can read classic studies of the European Enlightenment, such as Ernst Cassirer’s The Philosophy of the Enlightenment (1932), and find little context and no patrons at all. One would have thought the situation might have changed but mentions of patrons are almost equally absent from recent, trendy textbooks by Dorinda Outram and Roy Porter and not only because these are slight publications.1 Outram’s book covers fashionable topics – salons and the public sphere – but patronage is not on her list. Porter’s larger book on the British Enlightenment is so lacking in a concern for context that it does not even see the need to treat Scotland as a separate place or the Scottish Enlightenment as a development with a character of its own. Even studies of the Scottish Enlightenment such as Nicholas Phillipson’s now dated but still much quoted essay, ‘Culture and Society in the 18th Century’, pay little attention to academic patronage.2 Few would today see the Scottish Enlightenment as almost wholly an Edinburgh creation and fewer should agree with Phillipson’s view of it as the ideological creation of a local aristocracy and a dependent literati eager to find a way of asserting their importance in a kingdom becoming a province. He seldom asks who helped either group to make the changes it considered good or asks about the origins of ideas and practices in the period preceding the one which concerns him. Surely, when dealing with any set of intellectuals, and especially those working in an aristocratically structured society, one ought to\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n4\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 4\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nask who put in their places the men and women who had expressed and institutionalised novel ideas in that society. Why were they patronised? Who made it possible for their ideas to be acted upon? This monograph tries to answer some of those questions with respect to Scotland during the period 1690 to 1806, from the settlement of the country in the aftermath of the 1688 revolution to the end of the reign of ‘Harry IX’ – Henry Dundas (1742–1811). Dundas lost power when he was impeached in 1806. It offers an account of the political context in which the Scottish Enlightenment developed, flourished and then began to wind down. Scottish politics in the period revolved around the management of Scottish society through patronage. This study focuses on patronage in one set of institutions essential to the articulation of the Scottish Enlightenment – the universities. 2. THE DATA AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY There were 388 men appointed to teaching positions in the Scottish universities, of whom 108 held places in the Aberdeen universities. In an earlier book, I discussed those men.3 Here I consider the 280 men who held university teaching positions in the three southern Scottish universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews after the purge of 1690.4 Aberdeen had two universities: King’s College and University and Marischal College and University, in the Old and New Towns respectively. The appointees of the five universities collectively held at least 494 places. Competing for university places were at least 212 other men – of whom the names of 130, often only surnames, are known. One should not think that 212 is the total number of other contenders. One commentator on a contest for an Edinburgh professorship noted there were ‘numberless others’ who also sought the job he wanted. That was particularly so after c. 1740 at Edinburgh and Glasgow but less often the case at other colleges. It is not clear how many would-be academics there were. Perhaps there were enough to make three contenders for every post which paid well and at least two for most others. Ultimately only 98 men, who are known to have sought places, were disappointed. Some of the latter may in the end have found teaching posts in other institutions.5 By looking in detail at placements and patrons, this study seeks to show how politics worked to shape the universities during this period. Politics pervaded life. In general, the patrons who filled university chairs filled most of the other livings in Scotland’s public offices and semi-public corporations. Looking at the universities is a way of\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\nIntroduction\n\n08:24\n\nPage 5\n\n5\n\nseeing who counted in the politics of Scotland and at what they sought to promote during a period in which the kingdom became one of the centres of European thought. The data for this study have been assembled over many years in a somewhat random fashion with no comprehensive book-length study in mind. I was initially interested in the universities more for what individuals taught than for how they came to teach it. One result of that is that much of what follows was unsystematically researched and is, unfortunately, often incomplete. I have not worked systematically in the archives of the burgh of Edinburgh. That would certainly yield more materials useful for this account.6 I have not worked in English archives. What I have done, for almost thirty years, is to note down items which concerned the Scottish professors, including the ways in which they came to hold their jobs. Unfortunately, many negotiations for positions were not put on paper but were the stuff of conversations and face-to-face meetings in Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews, Aberdeen or London. Those dealings left little record but were a large part of the story, a part not now recoverable. Other things have been lost or exist in manuscripts deposited in places I have not visited. To list their likely locations is to point to other shortcomings of this study. Some libraries in Scotland, such as The Mitchell Library in Glasgow, have not been much consulted. Access to the archive of the Campbells of Argyll, which might possibly have added something to this study and to every other topic in Scottish history during the period covered here, was denied. That archive has too long been closed to scholars; no one knows what it may contain – much, or nothing more than what has been published from it.7 Some conclusions from my researches have been previously published but in those publications there has been little attention given to the patronage of all the chairs during the period surveyed.8 Here I have tried to do that for the three universities I have not previously discussed in print. Part of my intention is to show how different the three were and how their professoriates differed as a consequence. I hope others will find this work relevant to the study of enlightenments not only in Scotland but elsewhere. 3. POLITICS AND UNIVERSITY PATRONAGE University patronage reflected the politics of parliamentary representation and the struggles among factions for control of government influence and power in Scotland. It consequently followed the shifts\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n6\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 6\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nin parliamentary representation in Scotland and offers sure signs of who mattered when and who did not. University appointments can be used to chart the politics of eighteenth-century Scotland. Men in all the Scottish political factions, in both the state and Kirk, had interests in keeping the universities ideologically sound. For that reason alone, the colleges were intently watched by politicians in both Scotland and London. Scots managed the colleges partly through visitations, grants and favours but mostly through appointments. Since those appointments were for life and constituted a sort of property, they keenly interested politicians eager not to make choices which would impair their ability to control the corporations and some of the local patronage the masters exercised. The patronage of the universities almost always served particular local patrons connected with politicians who mattered nationally. The only exceptions were at the arts colleges at St Andrews and King’s College which were sometimes controlled by academic families. Those places were also often not worth the bother of an important politician.9 The major political patrons exercised the Crown’s legal rights to fill regius chairs but their recommendations to the legal patrons of all chairs carried so much weight that, in effect, they negotiated over most appointments and helped to fill a majority of the college chairs during this period. One can follow the fortunes of the Scottish political factions by looking at the chief dispensers of university patronage and in that activity one can see the methods and goals they tended to pursue more generally. Throughout the early part of this period, those seeking to control the country were organised into loose and changing political factions led initially by great magnates such as the Dukes of Queensberry, Hamilton, Argyll and Montrose. Religious and political principles mattered to those men but factional concerns probably counted for more. By the end of the century, a lawyer like Henry Dundas, who lacked the fortune and social standing of those whom he succeeded but who controlled a ‘machine’, came to dominate the processes of appointment in a period when religious and political orthodoxy had again become of urgent importance. In the period 1690–1715, there was no dominant party but a shifting set of coalitions which led to many men being active in seeking and getting chairs for their friends and dependents. Between 1705 and 1714, John Erskine, 11th Earl of Mar (1675–1732), was for some of those years one of the Secretaries of State and served as the front man and broker for shifting coalitions. Mar counted for much from the accession of Anne in 1702 until her death in 1714, when he was\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\nIntroduction\n\n08:24\n\nPage 7\n\n7\n\nousted from power by George I. After that he headed a Jacobite Party which was always active but whose members had little chance of obtaining jobs for themselves or their followers.10 From c. 1705 to 1755, the most important of the competing factional groups were the Squadrone and the Argathelians.11 After a sharp struggle in 1715–16, the Squadrone party was entrusted with the disposal of most government patronage in Scotland until c. 1723. That was reflected in the distribution of university chairs at Glasgow and St Andrews, and at the Aberdeen colleges which were purged after the ’15. The principal rivals of the Squadrone were led by John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (1680–1743), and his brother, Archibald, Earl of Ilay, who in 1743 became the 3rd Duke of Argyll (1682–6 April 1761). The Argathelians held a prominent place in Scottish public life for a short time after the ’15, in which the Campbell brothers had distinguished themselves. However, they quickly lost their edge and did not play great roles again until after the elections of 1722. What solidified their position, both in London and Scotland, were ministerial changes which gave the Campbell brothers the confidence of Charles, 2nd Viscount Townshend (1674–1738), and Sir Robert Walpole (1676–1745). For that to happen, Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland (1674–1722), and John Carteret, later 1st Earl of Granville (1690–1763), and their friend, John Ker, 1st Duke of Roxburghe (?–1741), had to leave the ministry. All three had done so by the end of 1725.12 Argyll and his brother Ilay then came to dominate Scottish politics. By the end of that decade, Ilay, his faction’s chief manager, was doling out many places, although he never gained exclusive control of all Crown patronage. That eluded him but his hold on Scotland was tight from c. 1725 until his death in 1761, with the exception of the years 1742 to 1747.13 Ilay’s emergence as a trusted manager in 1725 depended on his ability to control the country in the aftermath of the Malt Tax Riots, disturbances which Sir Robert Walpole’s government could not tolerate. In Ilay, Walpole found a Scot who could be relied upon to act sensibly and to use for the government his family’s political weight in the Western and Highland areas. It mattered that Ilay, unlike the Squadrone men, generally got on with Jacobites and was sensitive to the reasons for their discontent. Although often accused of being a Jacobite, he probably never deviated much, or long, from his family’s long-standing Whiggism.14 Both the Squadrone lords and Ilay constructed efficient political machines which sent information and nominations from Scotland to\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n8\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 8\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nLondon and then implemented the decisions taken by the principal managers and the ministry.15 Ilay’s principal Edinburgh assistant was his relative, Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton, SCJ (1692–1766). Their machine was inherited by Ilay’s nephew, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (1713–92) who, with his brother, James Stuart Mackenzie (c. 1719–1800), managed Scottish patronage for a few years – Bute from 1761 to 1763; Stuart Mackenzie, roughly from 1763 until 1765. The instability of governments in London after those years was reflected by the awarding of university jobs in Scotland to men backed by a variety of patrons who owed no fast allegiance to any particular faction among those who formed the kaleidoscopic ministries in London which ended only in the mid or late 1770s. Disorder in London allowed groups like the Scottish literati and their friends, the Moderate Party ministers in the Kirk, to exercise more influence on appointments than had been possible for comparable groups earlier in the century. That period ended c. 1778 when Henry Dundas put together another political machine which was more efficient and popular than had been the one run by the Argathelians. From time to time, opponents of the government managers could and did successfully push their opposition in the universities. Men in the universities with family or local interests sometimes showed the politicians that they counted and were not ciphers. Politicians negotiated with professors but the former could usually determine appointments if they were set on doing so. Still, others were not always subservient to the interests of vote-seeking politicians with eyes only on Westminster. Among them were clerics and members of corporations who had clear ideas about who should be appointed. One should also not infer that the filling of chairs was done with only parliamentary political goals in mind.16 Appointments reflected the interests of patrons but those interests included many things about which Parliament and its leaders never cared a toss and which figured only marginally in local elections. Sometimes those were related private family interests. The Kennedys of Cassillis took care of old tutors by appointing them to the humanity or Latin chair which the Kennedys controlled at St Andrews. Appointments might also serve the particular interests of patrons quite directly, as did the establishment of the Edinburgh and Marischal College chairs of agriculture in 1790. Both were founded by enthusiasts for agricultural improvements. When Ilay appointed medical men, chemists or astronomers, he was looking after his own intellectual interests and seeing that they were served by men in Scotland who\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\nIntroduction\n\n08:24\n\nPage 9\n\n9\n\ncould work for him and his friends as well as teach subjects which excited him as an amateur medical man and ‘scientist’. Many other appointments were made to support local interests in the university or the town in which it was situated. Some of those were religious in nature. Still, all who were appointed had to fit broad patterns of belief and behaviour which would not imperil the political position in Scotland of a legal or a de facto patron. That applied to other British institutions and was generally the case in other countries. University appointments offer a glimpse of the Scottish political life which was possible in the Kingdom after the Union, a politics still controlled by Scots. It was not just about jobs but also about the direction to be taken by the culture which Scots supported and developed. Posts were given to particular people for reasons having to do with utility, politeness or a vision of what the country should become as it changed from a greatly depressed and backward agrarian region in 1690 to one which by 1806 was not only thriving but had an agricultural sector which in parts of the Lowlands was as good as any elsewhere. By then, Scots possessed two of the best medical schools in Europe and some of its most advanced factories. One could appoint a man to a medical chair but to favour those trained in Leiden, and not in England, was a decision which affected the development of Scottish culture and kept it distinct in a United Kingdom where distinctions were being rubbed smooth and institutions made more alike. That was also true of appointments made to scientific chairs. Favouring the Moderate Party in the Kirk with divinity appointments changed the nature of the Kirk and, in the long run, altered the social outlook of the country. Scots might be united with the English but they controlled their educational institutions and used them for purposes they defined. Those definitions depended on particular patrons and their personal interests. When Mar, Argyll or Bute appointed mathematicians or medical men, chemists or astronomers, they were looking after their own intellectual and, sometimes, material interests. They tended to appoint men who could work for them and teach well subjects about which they were enthusiastic. When Henry Dundas appointed his friends to chairs, he was giving a sanction to a certain kind of literary man and a particular view of Scotland which he shared and promoted by other appointments in the civil administration, the courts and the Kirk. University appointments, like others, constituted a species of patronage with important cultural dimensions. The long-run effects of the appointments conferred by the Scottish politicians made Scotland a distinctive place. The brilliance of the eighteenth-century universities\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n10\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 10\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nwas not wholly the unintended result of decisions made for political reasons. Eighteenth-century Scots were lucky in their patrons. Those who dispensed patronage in the eighteenth century gave the country its medical schools, good science training and the moral and social philosophy which taught boys their duties in a world growing more complex and commercial. It fitted men to go out to govern an empire and even to speak or read some of its essential languages such as Persian and Arabic. Scots used their universities to make themselves more prosperous and exportable. Patrons, like James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose (?– 1742), or John Hay, 4th Marquis of Tweeddale (?–1762), or their rival, the Earl of Ilay, were willing, sometimes eager, to make the colleges and universities serve such ends. Over the many years in which such men made appointments, the colleges came to be increasingly secular in outlook, committed to utilitarian ends and to the education of boys who could thrive both in and out of Scotland. That achievement was a Scottish one and little concerned Englishmen in London who only in the nineteenth century would seriously interfere in the Scottish universities.17 Scotland’s history in this period was more influenced by these patrons than is often realised. Both Lord Ilay and Henry Dundas appointed many professors, and many more men to other bodies in the kingdom. One of Ilay’s obituaries spoke of the 54,000 jobs he had handed out over a career of fifty-five years. One need not believe the figure but one must recognise that his appointments ran into the thousands and that his patronage was exercised over more than the fortyyear period during which he had considerable power.18 Ilay helped into the universities Frances Hutcheson, William Cullen, John Anderson, Joseph Black, Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, Robert Watson, William Wilkie, George Campbell and many others. Through his appointments, Ilay had an impact on Scottish culture greater than that of any other single man between 1725 and the end of the period covered by this study. He did so without ever holding the positions which entitled men to exercise the influence he exerted.19 His influence was in a sense prolonged by his nephews, the 3rd Earl of Bute and his brother, James Stuart Mackenzie. They inherited his political machine and continued to make distinguished appointments until c. 1766. Their appointees included John Millar, Hugh Blair, William Robertson, John Hope and at least six other professors. Those members of the extended Campbell family all had an agenda of their own as well as a desire and need to serve the ministries in London to which they belonged. Their agenda can be seen in the extension of medical and scientific teaching, in the\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\nIntroduction\n\n08:24\n\nPage 11\n\n11\n\nfounding of a rhetoric chair at Edinburgh, and in the cultivation of Moderate clergymen which changed the Kirk and made Scotland a more tolerant place. Henry Dundas so dominated Scottish politics c. 1780–1806 that he could remark in 1801, ‘Every professor in the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh has been appointed for more than 20 years either actually by myself or upon my recommendation, and I take the satisfaction to reflect that in not one instance have I been mistaken.’20 He could have said the same thing of most appointments made at Glasgow after 1790 and about all appointments made from the late 1790s to 1805. By the 1790s, Dundas was using his university appointments to inculcate political conformity and loyalty to the Crown in an age of revolutions which he hated and feared. Dundas was not as enlightened a man as the 3rd Duke of Argyll, but his record was one which initially contributed to the development of the Enlightenment and then to its end in Scotland. Even as late as 1830, about a quarter of the sitting professors had been appointed by him and more by the members of his faction who continued in power beyond his time. Patronage mattered. Looking at an extended example of it in the universities sheds light on all the areas in which those patrons were active. Their clerical, legal and other civil appointments were of men not so different from the professors. Appointments outside the universities usually had the same ends in view, often considered men from the same families or family interest groups, and were designed to institutionalise the same beliefs or values. In general, the men who filled the university chairs were like those who filled most of the other livings in Scottish public and semi-public offices and corporations. 4. THE PROCESSES OF APPOINTMENT What was true of patronage patterns in one university cannot simply be generalised to all of the others. They all had unique structures which caused their patronage to be differently exercised and manipulated. King’s College or the Colleges of St Leonard and St Salvator were often so dominated by professorial family groups or the protégés of private patrons that contests for their chairs were not numerous. At St Mary’s College, where all the livings were Crown creations, and were controlled by politicians, competitions depended much on who was in power and the importance of the chair. Divinity chairs were usually contested but the chairs of ecclesiastical history and Hebrew, the first a virtual sinecure for some periods and the second generally\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n12\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 12\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\npoorly paid, were not so actively sought. At Glasgow, where the masters were in charge – but usually deferred to their betters – chairs were contested at least half the time. Despite Edinburgh’s attractiveness as a place to live, its places seem not to have been so sought after as were those in Glasgow. Edinburgh’s rate of contestation (43 per cent) was lower than Glasgow’s.21 There eligible local men probably had fewer opportunities to use their educations while in the capital more major politicians were involved with appointments. That acted as a discouragement to those with few political friends among the great. In each university, the professors almost always came to office after two sets of men had been consulted. The first were the legal patrons who held the right to appoint to the chair. They varied from place to place. At Glasgow, most of the chairs were in the gift of the College masters or the members of the University – the masters and professors afforced by the rector and the dean of faculty – who had the right to make appointments. The positions which they did not fill were filled by the Crown, the only other patron with legal appointment rights in the University. From time to time the Town Council used its political weight or its legal interests in bursaries and the College library to try to get its way but it was not a serious factor in university placements at Glasgow. Chairs were generally filled by men who had no legal rights to appoint but who had national influence. Their recommendations to the masters were almost invariably taken. At St Mary’s College in St Andrews, all the livings were regius chairs filled by the Crown; college men and locals had little influence on appointments there. The Crown installed men who would be useful to the politicians then in power while paying a decent regard to orthodoxy, merit and to the interests of those who acted for the King. In the St Andrews arts colleges, two chairs were filled by private patrons while the masters appointed to the rest, save for mathematics which was a regius chair. Because the masters tended to promote men already on the staff, that often left the private patrons to fill again the poorest paid of the chairs. In the end, many of the teachers at St Andrews, until after the union of the colleges in 1747, were men whom the private patrons at each of the arts colleges had initially appointed. The private patrons rewarded old tutors and clerics just as they sometimes looked after those of their friends. Merit was not consistently high on their list of qualities needed by appointees. The other chairs in that University were filled by the masters, who tended to look after their own families and friends.\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\nIntroduction\n\n08:24\n\nPage 13\n\n13\n\nAt Edinburgh the situation was much more complex. The Town Council was the legal patron to most chairs, with the Crown naming to others. At the end of the period there was one chair which had been privately endowed and specially filled. However, bodies such as the Incorporation of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians, the lawyers, acting collectively in the Faculty of Advocates, the Society of Writers to the Signet or as the judges of the sovereign courts, also influenced many decisions. So too did clerics who everywhere asserted rights to pass on the orthodoxy of the men appointed. A legal right to appoint was never a guarantee that the legal patron would in fact choose the person appointed, only that he would in the end sign the necessary appointment papers. The ‘men of power’ called most of the shots. 5. OTHER AIMS OF THIS BOOK In an earlier study of the Aberdeen universities, I set out a description of the Scottish professoriate up to 1800. The statistics given in my earlier book are not substantially changed by extending the time through 1806.22 I have not revised the figures given in that volume but I have added information about the professors. Each is listed with birth and death dates in the text when first mentioned. There is also more information about incomes which, in the past, have been underestimated. The incomes of the professors have been re-calculated, as have actual minimum incomes for salaries in selected years. Some salaries varied from year to year because the price of meal fluctuated. It constituted a component of many salaries. Over time salaries rose. Minimal incomes depended on one’s salary but total incomes were generally enhanced by fees, the possession of offices, income from land or rental properties and often by the boarding of students. It was total incomes which defined the prospects of a professor as much as did the salary he received. Total incomes have often been ignored and they have always been underestimated by those who have studied these universities. When it is said that the Scottish university men were poorly paid, one should quickly note that most made at least two or three times what clerics in the surrounding towns were paid and often, by the end of the period, as much as four or five times as much, even though average clerical stipends had risen a bit. In the case of some Edinburgh professors, the figure was over twenty times the average clerical salary in Scotland. Incomes were respectable but garnered\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n14\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 14\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nfrom salaries and perquisites, from pensions and writing, from the keeping of students and from rents, consulting fees or the practice of law or medicine. I have calculated incomes for the professors for given years using whatever I could find to do so. Those estimates may not be quite accurate but they cannot be far off the true figures. Sometimes they come from one or two years before or after the dates given. The kinds of education offered over the course of the century were partly determined by the incomes which the professors could expect. Well-paid men worked harder because they had to. While all of them received more than is sometimes realised, the hierarchy of total incomes placed the men at Edinburgh on top with Glasgow, Marischal College, St Andrews (after 1747) and King’s College following in that order.23 The best incomes attracted the best men and promotions or translations to other chairs are often partly explained by the differing salaries and the opportunities offered by the chairs to which men were translated. This work also offers not only some account of the motives for the expansion of the colleges but a new account of the founding of the medical school at Edinburgh, one of the most important educational achievements of the period.24 While the book has miscellaneous information about the Scottish professors, it does not seek to say about them all that is known. There is much more information in the sources for university histories which are listed in the notes and bibliography and in many more which are not because they have nothing in particular to say about patronage. What I principally have tried to do is to study the patronage of the chairs, and to make the account of that as complete as I could make it. If that has been successful, it will serve as a guide to future university histories in Scotland, histories which need to be written since only Glasgow and Aberdeen have histories which are at all adequate.25 It should also help us to see the origins of and the pressures to maintain the Scottish Enlightenment. Hierarchical, aristocratic societies, with scarcities and needs as great as those of eighteenth-century Europe, made patronage politics pervasive, but only exceptional patrons, such as Scotland had, made enlightenments not only possible but brilliant. Notes 1 Outram, The Enlightenment, 1995; Porter, The Enlightenment, 1990. In Porter’s The Creation of the Modern World, 2000 [The British edition is entitled Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World,\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\n3 4 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 9\n\n10 11\n\n08:24\n\nPage 15\n\n15\n\n2000], patronage gets a few pages with much of the space being devoted to Dr Johnson and Lord Chesterfield. In Daniel Roche’s account of the background to the French Enlightenment, France in the Enlightenment, 1998 [La France des Lumières, 1993], the Enlightenment is swamped in a hotchpotch of social analyses and factual details almost none of which deal with patronage, a subject not even warranting an entry in the index. This is to be found in The University in Society, ed. Stone, 1974, II, 407–48. Phillipson’s most recent pronouncement on the Scottish Enlightenment is ‘Scottish Enlightenment’, in Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment, 2 vols, ed. Michel Delon and translated by Fitzroy Dearborn et al. (Chicago and London, 2001); 2:1196–1200. There Phillipson tends to see the Scottish Enlightenment as rooted in responses to social changes and in university reforms designed principally by and for the clergy. Emerson, Professors, Patronage and Politics, 1992. That study stopped in 1800; this one goes slightly longer. There were sixteen men who taught at two places. Among the disappointed were men who taught at the extramural medical school in Edinburgh (1), in London hospitals (3), at the Royal Military School at Woolwich (1) and at private academies (2). Where the Edinburgh Town Council Minutes are cited, they are cited without a source from extracts which appear in the D. B. Horn Papers, EUL, Gen 1824 or from the appropriate volumes of Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, ed. Armet, 1967. That little of relevance exists in Inveraray is made likely by remarks in the Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, 1874, p. 442f. There the editors commented that the manuscripts had been carelessly kept and much hurt by damp, particularly those dating from c. 1740. The papers of Lord Ilay, the 3rd Duke of Argyll, were probably never there. He had no legitimate children and his papers seem to have gone to his natural son, General William Williams Campbell. The manuscripts seem to have been last used by William Coxe, the biographer of Sir Robert Walpole, in the 1790s. For a list of those publications see the bibliography. The chairs at Marischal College before 1715, with the exception of the divinity and mathematics chairs, were controlled by the Lord Marischal. In 1716 his interest was confiscated by the Crown and appointments were made by the leading Scottish managers for the ministry in London. King’s College was purged at the same time and new men imposed by Squadrone politicians. The best recent account of the Jacobites is Szechi, 1715 The Great Jacobite Rebellion, 2006. The Squadrone were led by the Dukes of Montrose and Roxburghe from c. 1713 to 1730 and by the Marquis of Tweeddale from 1740 to 1746,\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n16\n\n12 13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17 18\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 16\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment but others among their numerous aristocratic relatives and dependants also played roles. The Argathelians were the party of the 2nd and 3rd Campbell Dukes of Argyll (c. 1704–61). For the best short accounts of them see: Shaw, The Political History of Eighteenth-Century Scotland, 1999 and his The Management of Scottish Society 1707–1764, 1983; Murdoch, ‘The People Above’, 1980; Scott, ‘The Politics and Administration of Scotland 1725–1748’, unpublished PhD dissertation, 1982; Wehrli, ‘Scottish Politics in the Age of Walpole’, unpublished PhD. dissertation, 1983; Sunter, Patronage and Politics, 1986; more useful information about patronage and related matters is contained in Whetstone, Scottish County Government, 1981. Plumb, Sir Robert Walpole, 1960, p. 105ff. This has been disputed by Andrew MacKillop in ‘More Fruitful than the Soil’ (2000). MacKillop uses Ilay’s military patronage as a gauge of his overall power in Scotland, which leads him to underestimate the degree of control over Scottish life which the Duke actually exercised. Military patronage was not essentially Scottish and interested more men in London. In Scotland, the Duke’s power was buttressed by his personal patronage and by the years of placing men in offices and livings. It grew with time. Ilay and his brother, the 2nd Duke of Argyll, showed Jacobite sympathies when they were disaffected with the government in c. 1716–19. See the many letters of Fanny Oglethorpe to Lords Mar and Ilay in Vols II– VII of Calendar of Stuart Papers belonging to His Majesty, 1904–23. It is clear that both Mar and George Lockhart of Carnwath thought the Campbell brothers’ professions of devotion to the Pretender insincere and not to be relied upon. Lockhart had grown up with the Campbell boys and knew them well. Lockhart to Mar, 28 March 1718, Stuart Papers, VI: 272–8 and Letters of George Lockhart, Scottish History Society, ed. Szechi, 1989, p. 127–36. This letter comes from what seems to have been the period of Ilay’s maximum interest in the Jacobites. See also Szechi’s George Lockhart of Carnwath, 2002. The Squadrone ‘machine’ of the period 1715–24 is described in a 1741/2 letter from James Erskine, Lord Grange to John Hay, 4th Marquis of Tweeddale (1695–1762), Yester Papers, NLS, 7044/45–6. This is often said, e.g. Sunter’s review of Professors, Patronage and Politics in Scottish Tradition, 1995, p. 95, and Sunter’s Patronage and Politics, 1986. For a somewhat tendentious account of that, see Davie, The Democratic Intellect, 1964. The writer was clearly guessing that over a career of about fifty-five years, Ilay had appointed 1,000 people a year. It is given some plausibility by the sheer number of letters about appointments addressed to Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton, SCJ, in the Saltoun Correspondence held\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\n20 21\n\n22\n\n23 24 25\n\n08:24\n\nPage 17\n\n17\n\nat NLS. There are roughly 250 boxes of letters with, on average, over 100 letters in each. If each letter dealt with one place, then there were 25,000 appointments which Ilay and his aide sought to influence. In addition to those, Ilay handled in London some appointments with which Lord Milton was unconcerned, and others of a military nature, with which Milton also had little or nothing to do. Milton became Ilay’s manager in 1724, twenty years after the Earl’s political career had begun. 54,000 begins to look like a plausible estimate. This struck one of his opponents who in 1742 wrote to Henry Home that Ilay had had the authority of the Secretaries of State for Scotland but had ‘governed . . . in some Measure behind the Curtain’, which he could do because of his ‘Capacity, joined with his Influence at Court’; James Ogilvie, Lord Deskford to Home, 18 February 1742, NAS, Abercairny MSS, GD24/1/552/6. Quoted by Michael Fry in The Dundas Despotism, 1992, p. 184. Masters in the Scottish colleges were those who held voting and management rights under the initial charters and under charters which had been amended by Visitation Commissions and by Parliament to give these rights to new members of the corporation. There were no masters at Edinburgh because the Town Council retained financial control and the rights of ultimate oversight in every area of academic affairs. The rise of the senatus in the 1720s obscured this but did not eliminate the Town Council from university affairs. The teachers were overseen by a standing committee of the Council and by a bailie who presided over it. There are now a few more sons of small landowners, artisans and ministers, a few more eldest sons and more men who are known to have studied abroad and married. However, these changes come to less than 3 per cent in most of the categories of the earlier tables. That must be well within the margin of error for averages such as these which are based on often less than certain evidence and where years have been rounded off. The medians, too, are virtually unchanged by adding new data for the men who entered the universities between 1800 and the end of 1806. Incomes at St Andrews were about the same as those at King’s until after the union of the arts colleges at St Andrews in 1747. See Appendix 1. An earlier version of this account appears in ‘The Founding of the Edinburgh Medical School’, Emerson, 2004, pp. 183–218. The University of Edinburgh, by Anderson, Lynch and Phillipson, 2003, is a public relations book only important for sections dealing with the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 18\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPart II Glasgow University\n\nPage 19\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 20\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 21\n\n2 GLASGOW UNIVERSITY TO 1701 1\n\n1. THE STRUCTURES OF PATRONAGE AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITY A study of patronage in an eighteenth-century university should begin with the legal structures that defined the corporations in which patronage was awarded. Knowing those is knowing how they could be manipulated and managed. At Glasgow there were two chartered corporations: the College and the University of Glasgow. The University had as its chief officers the chancellor, rector and dean. The first, in Episcopal times, usually had been the Archbishop of Glasgow, whose powers were those assigned to the chancellor at Bologna.1 Under the Presbyterians, in 1692, a chancellor was elected by the rector and the masters who lacked a clear warrant for this election. It would later be claimed by the Argathelians that the right to appoint a chancellor vested in the Crown but this argument was not pushed and did not prevail in 1692. Chancellors generally did so little and had so few powers that it was perhaps not worth contesting the election of men usually belonging to the group in power in Scotland. The chancellor elected in 1692 was John Carmichael, 2nd Baron Carmichael and later the 1st Earl of Hyndford (1638–1710), a layman with political clout, as were the three Dukes of Montrose who succeeded him in the eighteenth century. The chancellor or his appointed vice-chancellor (usually the principal), admitted graduates to degrees, admitted new members to the University, and was the usual transmitter of letters from the University and College to the Crown and its ministers. In the eighteenth century, he often conveyed to them the professors’ suggestions about who might be picked to serve in regius chairs. Chancellors had influence not because of their University place but because they were noblemen with large incomes and many friends. Men like Carmichael or the Montroses could and did get dependants placed in the University and College. They were useful but mainly ornamental.\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n22\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 22\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nThe chancellors in this period were local noblemen such as the Dukes of Montrose. When their friends such as the Squadrone leaders or later Henry Dundas were in power, the chancellor could aid them. When they were out of power, they could be and often were obstructive in the interest of their faction. A chancellor might ignore the masters and their requests or refuse to transmit nominations to the Crown for regius chairs. He usually had friends in the College and might maintain a faction to frustrate those who backed his political opponents. The rector, the University’s chief magistrate, was, after 1727, elected annually in a complicated process which came to involve all the members of the University. In the early part of our period, he sat for years on end with the annual elections only a formality in which the masters or charter members of the University and College had a vote. Eventually the rector came to be elected with student votes, generally for two one-year terms. The rector and his assessors (usually the principal and professors of his faction) had judicial functions which mattered. The rectorial court had initial jurisdictions over all civil and criminal cases involving a member of the University, a point which the town sometimes disputed. The rector was the head of the main University disciplinary court for students and heard the cases of masters appealing from disciplinary procedures initiated in the College. The rector also sat as an elector of some professors and sometimes assumed some administrative functions. He was one of the three visitors of the College named in the charters. Four times a year, the visitors were to audit accounts and to see that affairs were conducted in accordance with the charter and the rules which had changed as the charter had been amended by Royal and Parliamentary Visitation Commissions. In a College in which factions were often closely divided, it was important to have him on one’s side both because of the votes he cast but also because of his legal jurisdiction. In the absence of the principal or dean, the rector sometimes presided over College Meetings, although the right to do so probably belonged not to him but to the senior regent of the College. The sphere of the rector’s jurisdiction was contested throughout the century, as were those of the principal and dean. A second visitor of the College created by the charter was the dean of faculty (or faculties) who was elected annually. His function as a visitor was to audit the accounts and see that rules were followed. He also had the right to vote in some elections of new members of the\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nGlasgow University to 1701\n\nPage 23\n\n23\n\nCollege and participated in College business, often keeping a record in the ‘Faculty Minutes’, a set of books whose titles varied over time. With the principal and rector, he managed the monies of the University. The third visitor was the minister of Glasgow, the principal preacher at the cathedral, who sometimes held a professorial position as well. In addition to those officials, the University included all the matriculated students and all who held appointments to positions mentioned in the often amended charter. The University Senate was composed of the rector, dean, principal, professors and masters. The function of the Senate was the election of new professors but not the professors and lecturers established and funded from the College revenues. Those men were chosen in the College Meeting, a body which sat under the principal and controlled all the property held by the College. The University as such had little or no property and did little but grant degrees and allow the rectorial court to function. Sometimes when the principal was incapacitated, the Senate acted in place of the College Meeting. It doing so, it overstepped its limits, notably under professor Leechman who functioned for many years as Vice-Rector during the long illness of principal Campbell in the 1750s and up to Campbell’s death in 1761. Leechman did business in the body he could best control. Glasgow was a university of one college. The College did all the arts teaching and was the most important part of the University. The College was a self-governing corporation composed of the principal and masters who, until 1727, were regents and thereafter were referred to as professors, except in some legal documents where they retained their technical designation of regents.2 Also on the foundation were bursars and other students and some of the servants, but not the lecturers appointed by the College, who had only precarious positions. The principal was the College’s most important figure. Nominally a professor of divinity, he spent most of his time administering the College. His deputy was the senior master or, in some circumstances, the professor of divinity. The principal and professors constituted a court competent to punish both students and professors for infractions of rules but most of the College Meeting’s business concerned the administration of funds. The way in which the University and College were supposed to be governed was nicely described by Thomas Reid (26 April 1710–7 October 1796) in the account of the University published in The Statistical Account of Scotland, edited by Sir John Sinclair and\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n24\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 24\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\npublished in 1799. Reid had been clerk to the faculty and knew how things should have been run, although they were not always run as he describes: In Glasgow, the whole property and revenue pertaining to the University, is vested in the college, and is administered by a meeting of the Principal and Professors, commonly called the College Meeting, very often, though perhaps with less propriety, the Faculty Meeting. The record of this meeting is visited and authenticated by the Rector, Dean of Faculty, and the Minister of the High Church of Glasgow. Other business of the University, besides matters of revenue, and the discipline of the students, [principally appointments] is managed in what is called an University Meeting or Senate; in which the Rector and Dean of Faculty sit, along with the Principal and Professors. Indeed, besides the College, all that remains of the University is a Chancellor, Rector, and Dean . . . The Rector and Dean are chosen annually . . . the Rector always names the Principal and Professors to be his Assessors; and with them, occasionally forms a court of law, for judging in pecuniary questions, and less atrocious crimes wherein any member of the University was party. The University has always maintained its exemption from all jurisdiction of the City Magistrates, but not of the Sheriff or Court of Session.3\n\nThe various higher officers of the University all had some role to play in the recruitment of new members of the University or College. Chancellors could refuse to admit men to office or try to obstruct their election. Rectors voted for new men and then might, in some circumstances, hear cases related to the elections of professors, deans and bursars. Deans were electors to some posts and had a right to make representations about the keeping of the rules specified in the charter or made by past Royal and Parliamentary Visitations. Distinctions between the College Meeting and Senate were not always observed, particularly when the principal was incapacitated and it was convenient to manage affairs through the University Meeting. This led to challenges of some actions by those who lost in the votes taken at meetings. Most professors of divinity were elected by the Senate but eventually the Court of Session found that the right to elect to this office belonged only to the College Meeting which excluded the rector and dean. The complexity of the structures offered many ways in which the disgruntled might try to question and frustrate the ambitions or choices of others. With the exception of Edinburgh, the other colleges and universities were equally complex and subject to the same sorts of disputes about the power and rights of officers as Glasgow had throughout the century.\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nGlasgow University to 1701\n\nPage 25\n\n25\n\nThe Crown – really its Scottish political managers – had a hand in many appointments. Over the century politicians here and elsewhere recommended the appointment of an increasing number of men to university chairs funded by the Crown. This gave it an added interest in the institutions.4 The bases for that interest were the regius chairs. In 1690 the Crown at Glasgow appointed only the principal; by 1806 it named the principal and professors of ecclesiastical history, law, anatomy and botany, medicine and astronomy. If a manager stayed long in power, he could build up a professorial clientele which was likely to do his bidding for a while after he had lost power. Usually the professors expressed an opinion about those appointments but they belonged to the Crown and it was thought somewhat improper to try to determine the nomination, although the College expected its choice to be considered by the politicians. Glaswegian clergymen, before whose Presbytery all the new professors had to subscribe the Westminster Confession, could and did sometimes object to a man’s signing the Confession. They, or others, sometimes made it difficult for an appointee to be translated from his church living to the University or to a kirk in the town. When clerics made trouble, they did so as much as political partisans as men of the cloth pursuing religious ends. Unlike the other universities in this period, there were no teaching posts at Glasgow controlled by private patrons other than the College meeting. There was, however, much meddling by genteel outsiders in the selection of professors. It occurred because so many desired to place dependants and to further their, or someone’s, political or cultural agenda. Most of those who interfered came from families which had long been connected to the College and, like the Dukes of Hamilton or the Mures of Caldwell, had endowed bursaries to which they might name holders and over which they still had some oversight. Some interference presumed future benefactions. Professors themselves wanted the support of the politicians and gentlemen for reasons of their own. The College was partially funded by the Crown. It farmed or collected teines [tithes] for the Crown on former Bishop’s lands in the area and needed the subsidies provided by the profits of this operation to maintain or expand its facilities. Most of the professors at one time or another sought patronage for relatives or friends. Most had children who needed something. The university men who sought to determine the choices for regius chairs were required to pay attention to the needs of those from whom they had to beg favours. Politicians on their side sought voices and votes\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n26\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 26\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nin church courts to support their policies. They were not averse to having the university men help in the management of local politics. The consequence was that local managers and noblemen were as active in the university politics of Glasgow as they were in the capital or elsewhere. The University also had places for influential outsiders. The greater gentry could be chancellors and rectors. Local ministers often served as deans of faculty and one was always a visitor. Those offices institutionalised outside influence, which it was often impossible to do in the St Andrews colleges or at King’s College. Outside influences at Edinburgh came through the Town Council but at Glasgow through chancellor, rector and dean of faculty. At St Andrews and King’s, the chancellors were usually absent and represented by professors serving as vices. During many years, rectors at King’s were not elected. Glasgow’s always had a chancellor and rector who were often resident in the area and the dean and minister of Glasgow always were. The university men all fitted into the politics of the burgh and region and helped to make Glasgow appointments mirror the ups and downs of party factions and the strains of Kirk politics. When compared to St Andrews, King’s and Marischal, Glasgow probably experienced greater involvement in its affairs by the local nobility, by government managers and alumni and donors. It also tended to involve in its affairs men of more influence and power than were concerned with the other universities except for Edinburgh. The main outside players – the government’s managers and those who opposed them – were mostly the same or the same kind of men at all the Scottish universities. Having looked at the structures we should now turn to the appointments, taking them in chronological order because that shows just how dependent on political influences the Scottish universities were. All the universities were politicised; that politicisation formed an important but often unnoticed context for the development of the Scottish Enlightenment. Factional politics affected who was selected for a place, how this was done, and the culture which Scotland came to possess as a result of such appointments. That is most obvious in the placements made in the wake of the Revolution of 1688–90. 2. THE PURGE OF 1690 AND THE REVOLUTION SETTLEMENT TO 1692 Purges occurred after every change of regime and indicated the Crown’s and the politicians’ determination to ensure that the schooling of boys and young men accorded with new views and was in the\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nGlasgow University to 1701\n\nPage 27\n\n27\n\nhands of friends of the new rulers. In 1690, all the grammar schools and the five universities were purged by a Parliamentary Visitation Commission eager to ensure that Episcopalian teachers, professors and masters, who might oppose the new Whig regime, were extruded and replaced by a corps of loyal teachers whose morals, Whiggism and Presbyterian commitments were beyond question.5 The Commission was struck by Parliament on 4 July 1690 when about sixty men were named to sit on it.6 Its chairman was William Lindsay, 18th Earl of Crawford.7 Most of the members served only on the committees which visited the university in the region from which they came or sat in the general sessions of the Commission held in Edinburgh. Among the West of Scotland noblemen who could have sat in Glasgow were the 4th Duke of Hamilton, 10th Earl of Argyll, 1st Viscount Stair, 3rd Baron Cardross and 2nd Baron Carmichael – men who might be taken to represent Lanarkshire, Argyllshire, Ayrshire, Dumbartonshire and Renfrewshire.8 Those who did sit included Lord Carmichael, Sir John Maxwell of Pollock, W[illiam] Cunningham of Craigends, Alexander Spittal, the laird of Leuchat, James Smollet of Bonhill, John Anderson of Dowhill (Provost of Glasgow), and the ministers Gabriel Cunningham, George Campbell and John Oliphant – ‘all of them persones of great Honour and Justice, as also great Moderation and temper’.9 Their judgement on the professors they outed was remarkably charitable. The Revolution Settlement deprived Glasgow of its chancellor, James Paterson, the Archbishop of Glasgow. Until a chancellor was elected in 1692, the effective heads of the corporations would be the rector and principal. In 1690 there seems to have been no rector, at least none was outed although the principal was. To maintain orthodoxy, the Visitors ordained that new appointees were to fulfil several conditions.10 They were to accept the Presbyterian establishment of the Kirk and worship in it, subscribe the Westminster Confession of Faith as their own personal beliefs, swear oaths of allegiance to the King and of faithful conduct in their offices, live blamelessly and peaceably with others, and, finally, show that they were fit for scholarly employment. The latter was to be shown by comparative trials or competitive tests for the new professors and regents who were to fill the vacated places.11 Formally these tests remained in effect throughout the period, although they effectively lapsed everywhere by the early 1700s. The Glasgow Commissioners met first at Edinburgh toward the end of July and then sat in the ‘high Common hall’ at Glasgow\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n28\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 28\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nto interrogate the principal and all the masters who were asked to give written replies to the Commissioners’ interrogatories. On 24 September 1690, the university men were summoned to Edinburgh to appear before the whole Commission and asked about their written replies, particularly about the requirement that they take oaths to uphold the new government and the new ecclesiastical settlement. After examining all the masters, the Commissioners on 27 September 1690 deposed the principal, professor of divinity and two regents who would not swear.12 Thomas Gordon (?–1702\\3), a Jacobite regent and professor of oriental language, had resigned earlier.13 This purge was remarkable only because the outed principal and those who went with him were thanked for their careful administration of the College and for the improvements they had made to it. The regents who survived, John Boyd (?–1699) and John Tran (?–1704), were willing to conform to Presbyterianism, just as earlier they had accommodated themselves to the Episcopalian regime. They seem to have been men of some flexibility as well as learning.14 A third man, George Sinclair (?–1699), had replaced Gordon but had not yet been installed. He was eager to conform since he had been forced out of the College in 1666 and had returned with the Revolution of 1688. While little is known of Tran and Boyd, Sinclair is well known. After a teaching career of twelve years, he had spent some time in selfimposed exile in Holland but he also served George Seton, 4th Earl of Winton, to whom he dedicated a book. Winton was an Episcopalian commander of troops used against Covenanters in 1666 and again in the late 1670s.15 That Sinclair should have been friendly with such a patron shows an ability to tolerate creedal differences which was needed in the 1690s. The book he dedicated to the Earl argued, on empirical grounds, for believing in the existence of witches. It is not irrelevant to note that some of Sinclair’s relatives had discovered and prosecuted witches in the 1680s during the last great outbreak of witchery in Scotland. But Sinclair was a modern virtuoso like Joseph Glanvill and Henry More, who also wrote similar works trying to give empirical evidence for a spirit world. Sinclair was also an engineer, to give him an anachronistic title. In 1691, he became the first to hold the professorship in mathematics, a post created by the College. The new men who replaced those whom the Visitors outed are an interesting lot. The new chancellor, John Carmichael, 2nd Baron Carmichael and 1st Earl of Hyndford (1638–1710), had been the chairman of the Visitation committee sent to Glasgow. In 1690, he served as HM Commissioner, Lord Privy Seal and a member of the\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nGlasgow University to 1701\n\nPage 29\n\n29\n\nCouncil. Carmichael was active in the Kirk but not bloody-minded. In the General Assembly of 1690, he famously read, to an Assembly bent on revenge, the royal agenda set out in a message with which he seems to have agreed: We expect that your management shall be such as we shall have no reason to repent of what we have done. A calm and peaceable procedure will be no less pleasing to us than it becometh you. We never could be of the mind that violence was suited to advancing of true religion; nor do we intend that our authority shall ever be a tool to the irregular passions of any party. Moderation is what religion enjoins, neighbouring Churches expect from, and we recommend to you.16\n\nCarmichael continued to hold high office as Secretary of State from 1696 to 1702 and his services were rewarded with promotion to his earldom in 1701. He became an active advocate of the Union of the Kingdoms. He was probably responsible for bringing Gershom Carmichael to Glasgow. In 1694, he enabled another regent, James Knibloe, to leave his office by providing the money for the College (or Carmichael, Knibloe’s successor) to buy him out.17 Lord Carmichael intervened with London politicians in 1709 to establish the regius chair of oriental languages.18 Like unto the chancellor was the new rector, David Boyle of Kelburn, after 1703 1st Earl of Glasgow (1666–1733). Boyle had spent time in Dutch exile and was a friend of William Carstares, later principal of Edinburgh University. Like Lord Carmichael, he was an active politician important in Glasgow and in the West of Scotland. His politicking was carried on under the wing of the Duke of Queensberry and was rewarded with a place on the Council in 1698 and with his peerage. In 1707, his political and religious interests were acknowledged by his being made HM Commissioner to the General Assembly, a temporary but lucrative post. Rector for only one year, Boyle aided in the creation of a chair of humanity and endorsed the principal’s efforts to improve the College.19 Under such men as Carmichael and Boyle, the reformed university received aid and protection but also supervision. The new principal, the reverend William Dunlop (1654–8 March 1700), was the son of a minister who had married the daughter of Mure of Glanderston, a family which had old ties to the university and one which would be involved in its affairs throughout the eighteenth century. Dunlop himself had wed the sister of the reverend Mr William Carstares (11 February 1649–28 December 1715), then Chaplain to\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n30\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 30\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nWilliam III and already probably interested in reforming the universities.20 Principal Dunlop, like Carstares, had been a sufferer under Episcopacy. Unable to preach legally, he had become a tutor to Lord Cochrane but also one of those who incited the rebellion which led Covenanters to Bothwell Bridge. By the early 1680s, Dunlop had emigrated to Carolina where he functioned both as a cleric and militia officer.21 Like Carstares, also a revolutionary in his youth, Dunlop became a moderate man and one having wide interests. He wrote an antiquarian ‘Account of Renfrewshire’, supplied Sir Robert Sibbald with miscellaneous historical materials and bits on natural history, and sought the improvement of the kingdom. In the last endeavour he was not always successful; he invested some College funds in the Darien Company, of which he was a director.22 Dunlop, like Carstares, was a politician but of a more militant sort. His politics had been played out on the field, in exile, and more recently in the delation to Carstares of the Montgomery or ‘The Club Plot’, a 1690 scheme by Jacobites and others to extract more power for the Parliament and to hurt the Presbyterian interest in the Kirk.23 His actions made him acceptable to the men brought to power by William III. Lord Crawford asked in a letter of 1 November 1690 to the Earl of Melville, HM Commissioner to Parliament, that Dunlop be appointed.24 Henry Erskine, 3rd Baron Cardross (1650–1725), another returned exile who had been in Carolina, wrote to Melville on the same day making a similar request. Dunlop’s reward for his constancy in their cause was the principalship of the University. This paid off a loyal supporter and gave the government assurance that the University would be in reliable hands. At the same time, men more rigid than himself saw the place going to one who had supported and suffered in their cause. His tenure was marked by an expansion of the College and by the improvement of its finances owing to his and William Carstares’ success in agitating for increased subsidies.25 Dunlop was influential in attempting to have the curriculum reformed and standardised texts printed and introduced in all the colleges – a plan which sounds sensible until one realises that it would have saddled the country with texts which would have been slow to change just when the novel ideas of Locke, Pufendorf and Newton were being introduced into the schools. Dunlop busied himself with church affairs and found his further reward in the office of Historiographer Royal of Scotland (1693). Dunlop’s new colleague as professor of divinity was James Wodrow (2 January 1637–25 September 1707). A strict Presbyterian\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nGlasgow University to 1701\n\nPage 31\n\n31\n\nfrom a genteel land-owning family, he had served as tutor to Alexander Stuart, Lord Blantyre and to the Duke of Hamilton. He also had ties to the Montgomerys, the family of the Earls of Eglinton. During the 1670s he had taught in grammar schools, during which time he too had suffered.26 A conventicle preacher in 1679, he had been hunted. In 1688 he was teaching theology privately in Glasgow. By marriage, he was related to the Dunlops of Dunlop, the Maxwells of Pollock, various Stirlings and to the Stewarts of Blackhall, local landed families of influence who had intermarried.27 Sir John Maxwell of Pollock was to be rector from 1691 to 1717. Wodrow married twice, both times to women from Glasgow merchant families. The principal and the politicians could trust him even though they might have found his teaching about when revolt against established authority was justified coming rather too close to them as well as hitting at the Jacobites.28 His broader message was the primacy of the conscience rightly guided, a message that later men would use against subscriptions to creeds, for legal reforms and on behalf of other enlightened causes. He was also, like the principal, interested in natural history and had studied medicine and botany. Not surprisingly, he raised two sons who followed him in these interests – Robert, the well-known historian and virtuoso, and John, an MD who taught botany at his Glasgow botanical garden and was a candidate for Glasgow medical chairs.29 The other appointments that the Visitation Commission made were to regencies and to the chair of oriental languages which the College had founded and funded. The latter was filled by regent John Tran, who replaced Thomas Gordon as both regent and professor.30 Tran got a slightly higher salary, perhaps as much as £64 (sterling) a year.31 The new regents were chosen according the rule which mandated comparative trials for those who sought to fill vacancies. The first of those trials in Glasgow was a more or less public event with the Provost of Glasgow, the burgh’s ministers, Maxwell of Pollock and other gentlemen invited to the disputations which were held over a fourteen-day period in late 1690.32 The winner was installed at the beginning of 1691. John Law of Ballarnock (c. 1666–1718) was the successful candidate but about him nothing of substance has been found.33 Two others who were tried were appointed a bit later to new foundations. James Knibloe (?–?) became the humanist or regent of humanity and William Jameson (c. 1660–20 October 1720) became the first lecturer in civil and ecclesiastical history in 1692. Those were new\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n32\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 32\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\npositions with small salaries supplied by the College. Knibloe later accepted an arts regency but stayed at Glasgow only a short time. As noted above, he seems to have ‘sold’ his place and then disappeared.34 William Jameson replaced him as a teacher of humanity and history. Combining the two was common in the Dutch universities of the time.35 ‘Blind’ Jameson (he had been blind since childhood) was eventually subsidised by the Crown with a grant of £400 Scots [about £33 sterling]. This was a precarious gift which principal Stirling asked to be continued. It was not just charity to a worthy blind man. Jameson was a learned and relatively prolific writer against Catholics, Episcopalians, Quakers and Deists. He too belonged to the circle of antiquaries gathered in Edinburgh about Sir Robert Sibbald and in Glasgow about principal Dunlop and Robert Wodrow.36 With those appointments, Glasgow’s Revolution Settlement was effected. Although the College and University were poor, the masters had found money to allow Sinclair, Tran, Knibloe and Jameson to become respectively specialist teachers of mathematics, Hebrew, humanity and history. They tried in 1702 to fund a Greek chair, as the Kirk wished them to do, but nothing immediately came of solicitations of ‘His Grace’.37 Still, the College had appointed reasonable men who were mostly in their forties and generally had interests beyond what they taught. The oldest of them, Sinclair, was among the most modern in his interests. The College had also done well to specialise the teaching of Latin and mathematics and to introduce or revive the teaching of history. Those were all steps which brought it into line with what William Carstares and others, who had spent time in Holland, hoped to see the universities do as they became more modern. They were also steps taken by an institution in competition with the University of Edinburgh which already had a regent of humanity but which would get an ecclesiastical historian only in 1702 and a civil one in 1719, about the time the Glasgow chair was endowed by the Crown. The appointment of a mathematician brought Glasgow level with Marischal College, St Andrews and Edinburgh. Its planned second professorship in divinity would have given it a more impressive set of theology teachers than Edinburgh possessed. The second theology post failed to materialise. George Meldrum, for whom it was designed, was appointed at Edinburgh.38 The men appointed did not modernise the curriculum, which remained rather scholastic, but they included three or four virtuosi who intended to see Scotland improved in diverse ways. Three of the men might once have been revolutionaries willing to suffer for their\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nGlasgow University to 1701\n\nPage 33\n\n33\n\nbeliefs, but their beliefs were generally Whiggish in nature and led them to respect due process and to oppose torture, which lasted in Scotland well into the eighteenth century.39 Such men did not usually find the political ideas of John Locke strange. Personally, some had got on with Episcopalians like Lord Winton or Sir Robert Sibbald, MD, although not with a government run by Episcopalians with views more extreme than Sibbald’s. They constituted something of a clique related by kinship, outlook and other ties. That was not a good omen for future appointments. The next ones extended the family connections. The rector appointed after the installation of the new principal in 1691 was Sir John Maxwell (January 1648–4 July 1732). He was related to Dunlop and Wodrow and after 1692 would find in the chancellor, Lord Carmichael, another distant relative. Another relative by marriage was Sir James Steuart (1635–1 May 1713), a longserving Lord Advocate, whose opposition to Episcopacy and the Stuarts, Maxwell had shared. Both had suffered before 1688. Maxwell had been imprisoned, fined, forfeited and then made a Privy Councillor by William III. From 1696 until 1702 he would serve as one of the Lords of Treasury and a judge of the Court of Session (1699–d). Later he was a Commissioner of Union.40 Maxwell and Steuart defended the College’s interests for a generation. Other ties ran to friends who were not relatives. Principal William Dunlop had come from Renfrew, which in 1690 supplied the dean of the faculty, Patrick Simson (1628–1715).41 Simson was minister of the town and a man well connected to the Presbyterian nobility of the West of Scotland. He remained dean until 1695. His son, John, became professor of divinity. The well-connected James Wodrow found at least one of his old teachers in the College. That man, John Tran, was married to a woman named Law – but this may not have been a relative of the regent bearing that name.42 George Sinclair’s brother had kept a school attended by principal Dunlop’s brother-in-law, William Carstares. The latter gave George’s cousin, Patrick Sinclair, a berth on the Edinburgh faculty. It looks as if half a dozen of the men in 1691 – there were only ten in both the College and University – were related by ties of kinship or close association. Most of them also had easy relations with many of the nobility and greater gentry of the area. James Wodrow’s father had been chamberlain to the Earl of Eglinton and Patrick Simson, as a young man, had been a functionary in the household of the Marquis of Argyll. Dunlop’s ties to the great ran partly through William’s Chaplain, William Carstares, but Dunlop\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n34\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 34\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nhad known other aristocrats in Carolina and tutored Lord Cochrane in his younger days. Glasgow professors throughout the century generally had more ties to the greater gentry of their region than the professors teaching elsewhere. The Parliamentary Visitation Commission continued to exist, but with a changing membership, and continued to make new rules. It issued reports and recommendations in 1690, 1695 and 1699 which agitated the colleges for years. Its proposals included having a common school year and producing a standard set of printed teaching texts for all the colleges in Scotland.43 It wanted fixed Greek chairs and said all regents should teach some mathematics to their charges. It mandated the teaching of Aristotle but also of more modern thinkers in natural philosophy. It encouraged experiments and the purchases of instruments with which to make them. It set a minimum age for faculty members – twenty-one – and paid attention to the discipline of both regents and students. The latter were to wear distinctive gowns, be godly and moral, come to college prepared in Latin and take degrees only after rigorous examinations in which they would be ranked by their performance.44 It discussed the desirability of adding chairs in law and medicine and for the better funding of the institutions. Divinity students were admonished to study Hebrew. Those recommendations were somewhat unsettling because they tended to set colleges in competition for scarce resources and because they envisioned a common curriculum when the masters were unlikely to agree on one. Most of the recommendations were not immediately effective. Common texts could not be agreed upon and the project was abandoned when the manuscripts of the texts were lost when the papers and effects of the recently deceased principal Gilbert Rule of Edinburgh were misplaced or burned around 1701. Greek was not required everywhere until c. 1702 and thereafter was a subject often evaded. Quite a few young men were appointed to teach before they were twenty-one and graduations were not conducted as they should have been. 3. APPOINTMENTS, 1692–1701 Between 1692 and 1704, only four academic appointments were made. The first of those appointed was Gershom Carmichael (1672–25 November 1729), who came recommended by the Duke of Hamilton and was probably placed through the influence of his distant relative, Lord Carmichael, then the King’s Commissioner to\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nGlasgow University to 1701\n\nPage 35\n\n35\n\nthe General Assembly.45 Like some of the men appointed earlier, he too came from a family which had suffered during ‘the killing times’. His father had been exiled to London where he preached to a congregation of Scots Dissenters and where he died. Gershom Carmichael probably grew up there. He and his mother had very likely returned to Scotland by 1687. By that time she had probably married Sir James Fraser of Brea, another sufferer and the author of famous books. They justified the Glorious Revolution and the sacking of bad kings and taught that all men were naturally called to live a moral life, although only the elect were to be saved. Carmichael attended Edinburgh University, taking his MA there in 1691. The following year he spent at Leyden where he may have picked up the Cartesianism he taught at Glasgow until c. 1700. In March 1693, he obtained a regency at St Andrews which was in the gift of the Earl of Cassillis. The Earl had also suffered outlawry in the Restoration period. Carmichael resigned his living in September 1693 in order to study further at Glasgow, where he took a second MA in 1694. When James Knibloe resigned in October of that year, he succeeded him. By then he was a believer in the righteousness of the revolutionary cause of 1688 and had some knowledge of natural law theory. He remained at the University until his death.46 John Loudoun (?–1 November 1750), Carmichael’s equally wellconnected friend, was appointed in 1699 to replace John Boyd. Loudoun had tutored the children of the Earls of Rothes and Haddington.47 He had been one of the candidates for a regency at Glasgow in 169048 and in 1695 he had been appointed a regent at St Andrews through the influence of his noble patrons.49 In Glasgow, Loudoun also seems to have found backing from the Duke of Hamilton. He would have been known to the masters because he had taught privately in the burgh c 1689.50 He served the College until his death in 1750.51 In 1699, Dr Robert Sinclair (by 1665–after 1717), probably a son of George, was made professor of mathematics. The younger Sinclair was a virtuoso physician trained in Utrecht who was in touch with the circle of Sir Robert Sibbald. He possibly had made a trip to Italy and, like George Sinclair, was an inventor – in his case, of a lamp.52 He was also enough of a linguist so that, in 1704, he added to his mathematics teaching instruction in Hebrew. He replaced the deceased John Tran.53 In 1703, Sinclair was made extraordinary professor of medicine and, with two assessors, examined and then granted a degree to a candidate for the MD For him to be a plausible\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n36\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nPage 36\n\nacademic patronage in the scottish enlightenment\n\nexaminer, he must have been reputable as a physician as well.54 Like the other two men, Sinclair was no backward-looking bigot but a man who had seen a bit of the world and had ties to modern men in Edinburgh, London and Holland. He had at least a local reputation as a virtuoso. The most important appointment of these years was that of John Stirling (August 1654–28 September 1727), who succeeded William Dunlop as principal in 1701. Principal Dunlop’s death in March 1700 set off a scramble for his office with ‘many trying at the Catch’.55 Stirling, the minster of Greenock, was the one chosen. He was then a vigorous man of forty-six whose mother was a Dunlop, which also related him by marriage to William Carstares, soon to become the Principal at Edinburgh.56 Another relative was Sir James Steuart, then the Lord Advocate. Stirling was a thoroughly reliable man. He had been recommended to the Crown, the patron to the principalship, by his cousin, Sir John Maxwell, then the rector. Sir John would long support the arbitrary rule that the principal was to introduce along with plans for expansion which were largely realised. Stirling’s place had been procured by Lord Carmichael in May 1701 but the minister could not bring himself immediately to say ‘yes’.57 Professor James Wodrow urged him to do so, telling him that it was God’s will that he become principal. Wodrow wrote again to Stirling on 12 June 1701 saying that, should Stirling refuse the place, his decision would irk the government, especially Sir James Steuart and William Hamilton of Whitelaw, SCJ.58 Professors Tran, Law and Carmichael urged him to take up the post, which he finally agreed to do.59 Robert Sinclair too was later said to have been ‘Active in the Interest of the Principal when his Election to that Post was coming on.’60 Those professors helped to select a man few on the faculty would consistently like in years to come. Why did so many want this man? Some probably realised that he would be a firm manager and would find support for his requests in Edinburgh among his relatives and powerful friends. Those men wanted to expand the universities to include the teaching of law and medicine and they sought to fund the College more adequately. Stirling later shared those aims and might have done so when he was appointed. He would have looked good to the masters who needed a well-connected man to speak for them. Others saw in him, as did Robert Wodrow, an earnest and powerful preacher of God’s word who would hew to an orthodox line.61 That voice would be heard in the local Presbytery, where he and the professor of divinity sat ex officio,\n\nM1143 EMERSON (PART I–III).qxp:Andy Q7.3\n\n29/2/08\n\n08:24\n\nGlasgow University to 1701\n\nPage 37\n\n37\n\nand very often in the yearly General Assembly held in Edinburgh. There Stirling could be expected to follow the lead of Carstares and the moderate and politique clergy, which, in general, he did. One also suspects that his relatives and friends were taking care of one of their own who in turn would repay the favour – as he did when he appointed more relatives to University livings. Finally, the politicians who secured his appointment probably saw him as a man who would serve them as a loyal local lieutenant. None of his supporters were disappointed. Stirling’s career provides a fine example of the political services expected of a college principal. He was active in the parliamentary elections in 1707/8, in a burgh election in 1709, and in preparations for the parliamentary elections of 1714 in the Glasgow burghs, in Lanarkshire, and possibly in Midlothian.62 He supplied ringing endorsements of government actions and gave in political intelligence during the 1715 and at other times when political tensions rose.63 He fulfilled similar tasks in the Kirk. Principal Stirling’s tenure saw the faculty expand and the revenues put on a better footing. The University library he inherited was a scholastic one but the one he left possessed most of the modern classics, including the Spectator Papers and the works of Newton.64 While he became unpopular with some of his colleagues within a very few years, and involved the University in turmoil and political infighting, some of that was forced on him by political opponents outside the College and by changed conditions in Scotland itself. Nevertheless, he was a willing political servant of the Duke on Montrose and the Squadrone interest throughout the period he served as principal. Notes 1 Coutts, History of the University, 1909, pp. 8, 12f. 2 Regents took an entering class of students through the whole curriculum, teaching them philosophy, mathematics, and whatever else they might learn except for Latin and Greek in the universities where there were chairs in those subjects. They attended church with their boys and gave them some religious instruction. Regents often looked after the boys’ finances and generally supervised them while they attended college. Regenting ended at Edinburgh in 1708, at Marischal College in 1753, at St Andrews in 1747 but at King’s College only in 1800.

This is not quite how the operation of the University was understood by others. Coutts says that after 1772 the rector’s powers were diminished by the Court of Session and those of the principal enhanced; Coutts, History, 1909, pp. 75–8. In 1690 the Crown appointed to six of about forty-eight professorships in Scotland (13 per cent). By 1806 it appointed twenty-six men to about eighty-eight chairs (28 per cent) and paid salaries to three more. Its remit is given in A. G.

In 1690, Crawford was President of the Convention Parliament, President of the Council and a Commissioner of Treasury. Personally pious, he prized orthodoxy but was not a man given to extreme measures. To his credit, he was made sick by witnessing the torture of prisoners, which seems not to have bothered other members of the Commission. Leven and Melville Papers, 1843, p. 583.
