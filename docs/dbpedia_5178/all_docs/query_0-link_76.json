The correspondence below is retained for interest and will be accessed by anyone using the search engine on the site.\n\nRobert Turner and Jimmy Hardie\n\n4/11/19\n\nHi Robert,\n\nI was saddened to read about Robert Turner’s passing so soon after Jim Hardie. Robert was ages with me and we grew up playing fitba’ and of course with the 214th GCBB pipe band. Dougie Elmslie and I caught up with him when we joined the Muirheads in late 1964 and became almost ‘local heroes’ when the band won the British Championships for the first time the following year!\n\nThe band’s success under Bob Hardie after that is legendary; talk about being in the right place at the right time! My association with the Boys’ Brigade continues down under and just last week I played at the funeral of Max Gray who I first met back in the 1990s when I was involved with B.B. Queensland.\n\nMax’s father was from Hawick and he was very proud of his Scottish heritage. Max became involved in B.B. in Sydney as a young man and became captain of a Company. He instigated the first B.B. Pan Australian Camp involving boys from all over Australia and other countries including New Zealand, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and other South Pacific nations.\n\nHe was awarded the ‘Order of Australia’ (our equivalent of the MBE) for his amazing work with boys. Interestingly he told me that one of the highlights of his life was a trip to Scotland when he visited the home of Sir William Alexander Smith in Thurso! Hope this finds you in good fettle.\n\nRegards,\n\nGordon Ferguson\n\nUS Attorney General\n\n22/7/19\n\nHello Mr. Wallace,\n\nThank you for the interview with Mr Barr. I believe that it is good for people to see political figures as real people with personal histories and human experiences regardless of there political views or affiliations. I am often disgusted with the way people of different opinions are lambasted in social media. We are all here together and have to learn how to deal with anyone who may diametrically oppose our own personal positions without resulting to personal attacks. I hope that this article and others like it will enable people to see the political figure, in this case, as a man and not as a beacon for a political ideology that they either agree or disagree with.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\nRegards, Jon Maffett\n\nBand Sizes\n\n15/7/19\n\nHi Rab\n\nNot wishing to offend anyone, but……… I picked up the comments re the size of today’s pipe bands. Yes they’ve been too big for too long. However, the outcomes of pipe band competitions have much more to do with adjudicators.\n\nIn my experience there are three types:\n\n1 Those who respond to what actually happens in the circle\n\n2 The totally inept who apparently have some difficulty hearing and seem to know little about piping or drumming\n\n3 Those who wish to inspire, shape the future but instead simply manipulate.\n\nUntil bands get off the fence and demand the formation of an Independent Adjudication Review Body there will be no change on the adjudication front.\n\nOn the numbers game, four reasons why it must change. I’m sure others will be able to add more reasons:\n\n1 Grades 2, 3A & 3B have suffered greatly over the past three decades due to the loss of the best leaders and quality players\n\n2 The number of quality pipe bands in Grades 2, 3A & 3B has reduced greatly\n\n3 The top pipers and drummers who once honed the necessary foundation skills in the lower grades before moving up to Grade 1, tend to move up too soon.\n\n4 Grade 1 bands on home turf at present are arguably not all of true Grade 1 standard.\n\nLet the discussion begin.\n\nRegards\n\nWinston Pollock, Northern Ireland\n\nBuchanan Piper\n\n14/5/19\n\nDear Mr Johnstone,\n\nI would be grateful if you could help me. My husband has recently been\n\ncreated the Buchanan Clan Chief. As such he is looking for a piper who\n\nwould be his personal piper and play when ever there is a major event.\n\nIndeed next year for his inauguration he will need three pipers for\n\nthis. Would you possibly be able to help me with this. Ideally they\n\nwould be Buchanan’s or one of the Buchanan septs and willing to join him\n\nat the occasional major events.\n\nThe following names are considered septs or associated names of Clan\n\nBuchanan: Calman, Colman, Cormack, Cousland, Dewar, Dove, Dow, Gibb,\n\nGibbon, Gibson, Gilbert, Gilbertson, Harper, Harperson, Leavy, Lennie,\n\nLenny, MacAldonich, MacAlman, MacAslan, MacAslin, MacAuselan, MacAuslan, MacAusland, MacAuslane, MacAlman, MacAlmont, MacAmmond, MacAsland, MacChruiter, MacCalman, MacColman, MacCormack, MacCubbin, MacCubbing, MacCubin, MacGeorge, MacGibbon, MacGreuisich, MacGubbin, MacInally, MacIndeor, MacIndoe, MacKinlay, MacKinley, MacMaster, MacMaurice, MacMurchie, MacMurchy, MacNeur, MacNuir, MacNuyer, MacQuattie, MacWattie, MacWhirter, Masters, Masterson, MacCaslin, Morrice, Morris, Morrison, Murchie, Murchison, Richardson, Risk, Rusk, Ruskin, Spittal, Spittel, Walter, Walters, Wason, Waters, Watson, Watt, Watters, Weir, Yuill, Yool, Yule, and Zuill\n\nI very much look forwards to hearing from you if you could help in this\n\nor direct me to someone who could.\n\nKind regards, Paula, The Lady Buchanan, tel: +44 1877339269\n\nColin Cameron\n\nUltimately, that’s not my focus. I don’t want to condemn or reject a certain style. There’s always a potential, given the reverberations of the not-so-distant past, to misspeak and come across that way. But really, I just don’t have any agenda like that.\n\nWhat I want to do, instead, is find a way to make room in our performative contexts (competitions, premier events, recitals, etc) for other styles and settings of pibroch. I am an ‘expansionist’ (re-expansionist?) hoping to see more of the precious inheritance of these manuscripts make its way into performance and instruction.\n\nI also applaud the effort to bring more of the modem compositions and composers to the fore, as well. I want to see pibroch grow and thrive, and think there is plenty room for us all. I hope that makes sense.\n\nYou know what started it all, really? Playing from Hannay-MacAuslan and being told, ‘You can’t do that! You’re playing it all wrong!’ Well, I certainly didn’t think so. I mean, I guess I made a hash of things (I’m always second-guessing myself – keeps me honest)). But nothing that particularly stood out. Different, yes. But wrong? It just came across as hurtful and not very well informed.\n\nI think today we are in a very strong position in pibroch. Lots of interest, lots of exposure, international appeal. I think we have lots more room to explore, musically grow, encourage new pieces, things like that. So, ‘expansionist’, really. Does that make things clearer or muddier? Anyway – love the site. Enjoyed meeting you. And hope to be back again!\n\nPS. Don’t change anything you’ve written. I just wanted to hopefully clarify some things.\n\nBlack Watch Promo Tour Picture\n\n23/3/16\n\nHi Robert,\n\nI see you had a good time down in Florida. Please find attached a few pictures. The first two pics were publicity shots for the North American Tour in 1957. The racoons are something I did in my art class. Likewise the self portrait. That was in the eighties. Thank you for keeping us up to date in the Piping Press.\n\nSandy Hain, Ohio\n\n• You are one talented man Sandy. Any other piper or drummer artists out there? If so please let us have your pictiures and we’ll happily feature them on Piping Press. Ed.\n\nWilliam Ross\n\n4/3/16\n\nDear Press\n\nAs a young adult I was very confused 34 years ago when I first started lessons. My teacher talked about Willie Ross and William Ross. This confused me for sometime. Can you blog in future about ‘The Queens Piper’ William Ross. Still very curious.\n\nThank you,\n\nMatthew Farrigan\n\nSaratoga Springs, NY\n\n• You’re not alone Michael. William Ross (above) was Queen Victoria’s piper and replaced Angus MacKay in 1854 after the latter’s mental illness meant he could no longer continue in post. Ross, formerly of the Black Watch, served until 1891 and in that time became a very influential figure in piping, not least through the publication of his collection of music – a collection which ran to several editions and which was widely used by pipers of the time. Ross was also heavily involved in the bagpipe-making trade and secured lucrative contracts from the War Office and Scottish Regiments. At one time he was so busy was he that he sub-contracted business to the German flute maker Henry Starck. William Ross is buried at Windsor, Berks., near the royal castle.\n\nWillie Ross, – the diminutive is always used by pipers to distinguish him from his illustrious forebear – has been the subject of many articles on Piping Press which can be accessed here.\n\nWheel of Fortune\n\n4/3/16\n\nDear Robert\n\nThis is just a short and slightly belated note to thank you on behalf of the City of Edinburgh Pipe Band for your excellent pre and post event coverage of the Pipe Majors’ Wheel of Fortune competition. We were really pleased with the level and quality of content on pipingpress.com and hope we can work closely with you again in the coming years.\n\nWhen the time is right, I will send you a couple of stories about the winners of the Sinclair pipes and the Allan MacDonald tune. The winner of the pipes is himself a Sinclair, while the person Allan’s tune will be named after is from Canada and sounds like a real character.\n\nLast but not least, we would welcome any thoughts you have on how we could improve the Wheel of Fortune. We think it has a lot of strengths, but we’re always looking to improve it for our audience, pipers and sponsors. With thanks and best wishes\n\nPaul White, City of Edinburgh Pipe Band\n\nLoch Ness Monster\n\n4/3/16\n\nSir,\n\nI work as a tour guide and often recommend the Whistlebinkies to passengers looking for music CDs. I had a query about ‘The Loch Ness Monster’ which appears to be the inspiration for one of Bear McCreary’s tracks on the new Outlander CD but can’t find any references. Is it a traditional tune he just used, or was it truly based on the Whistlebinkies tune?\n\nRose Scotlaw\n\n• The Loch Ness Monster is a fine jig written by that prolific composer Peter MacLeod, Partick, Glasgow. It can be found in John Wilson’s Book 1.\n\nClan MacRae Society Pipe Band\n\n22/2/16\n\nDear Piping Press,\n\nAs an American I would never offer any insight into historical piping matters in the UK. I believe one should not comment on matters you had no history or involvement in. However, back in the mid 90s I left the Schenectady Pipe Band to join the Worcester Kilties in Worcester, Mass. Many of the retired players of their heyday (1960s) returned to give it a go one more time. The Pipe Major was Bob Burnett. Burnett was a really interesting guy and I really enjoyed getting to know him. He got me lessons with another player in the Worcester band, George McKendrick. McKendrick had played with the Glasgow Police. Burnett told me he had played at age 17 with the ‘MacRae’ when they won the Worlds in the early fifties or their last time. He had a lot of really great stories about that time in his life and taught me ‘The Clan MacRae society’ the way they played it. I believe Bob still lives in Worcester and winters in Florida. Last I knew his son Robbie was in the Stewart Highlanders Grade 4 mid section. If someone could contact Bob, I am sure he could shed some light on the band’s later years. I haven’t seen him in some time. Thanks for such a great blog everyday. I’m hooked.\n\nMatthew M Farrigan\n\n• Glad you enjoy the site Michael and thanks for the info. Would be interested in a copy of Clan MacRae as you were taught it. Ed.\n\nOld Pipes\n\n10/2/16\n\nHi Rob,\n\nI came across a person who says they have a set of bagpipes from 1800 or pre-1800. He re-iterated that they had been in North America since that time. My question is, what is the likelihood the there was a pipe maker at that time? When the owner is well enough I will go and take some good pictures.\n\nGareth Houston-MacMillan, Utah\n\n• I have no knowledge of any pipe maker in North America at that time (there were only a few in Scotland then!). This set must have been brought over by an immigrant Scot or Irishman. Be very interested in the pix when you have them. RW\n\nNorrie Gillies\n\n10/2/16\n\nRobert,\n\nJust while I remember as you come to the end of your Alasdair Gillies serialised article see the attached image. Our pipe major, Alex MacIver, is far left, belt askew. In the centre standing centre in front of the ‘Paras’ P/M is Norrie Gillies, Alasdair’s father. You have covered this photo in the past.\n\nRegards\n\nHector Russell, Helensburgh\n\nWillie Ross\n\n10/2/16\n\nOne of my former instructors was P/M Angus MacDonald, Calgary Highlanders, and a boyhood friend of Donald MacLeod. Angus was taught by Willie Ross and when I went to my lessons he put Willie Ross’s picture in front of me to say that he was the best of the best. Reading your article brought to mind another time and another place. You are doing your best to keep the tradition alive and well.\n\nKen Rogers, Calgary\n\nGuide to the Games/ Alasdair Gillies\n\n20/1/16\n\nHi Rob,\n\nHope your new year is off to a great start. Thanks for the Guide to the Games – great to have all that info in one place this early in the season. One question: is the Lochaber Gathering still on this year? Perhaps there hasn’t been a date set yet, but I didn’t see it on your list. It’s one of the highlights of the circuit for me so I do hope it still is a go.\n\nOn another note, I really loved the Alasdair Gillies series you published. It brought back many warm memories. His personality shines through brilliantly. I remember Alasdair complaining a couple times that he was so well known for his MSR playing that his piobaireachd results sometimes got overlooked. He would joke how he often wasn’t ask to teach piobaireachd at workshops (always MSRs). However, it’s clear to see through this series, in his own words, that his heart and pride was more tied to the light music.\n\nGreat photos as well. Thanks, again!\n\nYours,\n\nNick Hudson, USA\n\nP/M Donald MacLeod\n\n13/1/16\n\nDear Rob,\n\nAttached is the recording of Donald’s tune ‘A Son’s Salute to His Parents’. I hope and feel sure Donald would approve of my timing of his tune. I just applied the normal scansion of 3/4 to it.\n\nI first met Donald McLeod, I think, in 1941/42 when the two regiments, the Camerons and the Seaforths, were amalgamated for training purposes. We each retained our Regimental Dress and I went from Inverness to Fort George. Donald had returned from France and was the Pipe Major when I arrived there.\n\nI was only 14/15 years old and in Boy’s service, I was quite a good player and Donald seemed to take an interest in me. At this time Donald was going on the bus from Ardersier through to John MacDonald in Inverness on a Wednesday and Saturday afternoons for lessons. I recall one of the tunes he was working on was Lament for the Earl of Antrim. His routine in the morning was this: he came into the Band Room to get a cup of tea with his cigarette. Then most often he picked his pipes up and played for an hour. Many times we heard tunes he had composed the night before in his bunk, mostly jigs and hornpipes. Quite often he would sit at the table and scribble bits into my MSS book. Another thing I recall when he came over in the morning is his sending me to mail his letters.\n\nWhile Donald was there a group of conscripts came from the police, three were from Glasgow: Alex MacDonald (P/M Angus’s father), Tommy Grant and Archie MacNab. Archie was a great player. I recall hearing him play an MSR and it was excellent. Donald composed a hornpipe and named it ‘Archie McNab’. I still have it in my MSS book; it is now known as Crossing the Minch.\n\nJigs became my favourite music at that time and when I went to Edinburgh Castle to Willie Ross he would ask me to play jigs to his daughter Cecily. She loved them.\n\nYours,\n\nJimmy McIntosh MBE\n\nOwen MacNiven\n\n28/12/15\n\nSir,\n\nThe article [Alasdair Gillies] mentions: ‘By the time I had done my basic training and moved to the Band Company based at Dreghorn Barracks, Edinburgh, the pipe majors there were about to change. P/M Jimmy Hood of the Argylls was due to leave and P/M Iain Morrison was to take over the position.’ I thought that Iain Morrison was P/M 1st Bn QOH 1975-1980 and then Scottish Division Depot Aberdeen 1980-1985. Is this correct and where does P/M Jimmy Hood fit in?\n\nAad Boode\n\n• Anyone help?\n\nFalklands Memories\n\n21/12/15\n\nDear Rab, I’ve just read your article concerning Peter [MacInnes] and myself. I must congratulate you; the piece captures the seriousness of the situation without glamorising or celebrating the craft of war. They were life-defining moments for both Peter and myself, who have remained firm friends for over 30 years. I look back on those days often thinking about the quality of military pipe bands and particularly the effort it took to maintain a place in the competition band whilst juggling the demands of demanding military commitments. My youngest son Robert is a piper with 1SG and there is a very different approach to the music/army balance.\n\nAll the best wishes of the season,\n\nKind Regards,\n\nSteven Duffy\n\nWillie Paterson and the Rutherglen Pipe Band\n\n10/12/15\n\nRobert,\n\nThe bespectacled man in civvies on the right of the back row as we look is drummer Willie Paterson. This was the very fellow who taught Alex Connell and Stirling McMurchie [Glasgow Police/ Strathclyde Police] and we know what happened with them! Willie was highly regarded, and of his time was an important influence on the huge changes to pipe band drumming which were evolving post WWII. He taught many 214BB drummers (and some pipers, including John Finlay) and laid the foundation of the 214 drumming dynasty which we are only now beginning to chronicle. Our Pipe Major in the 214, Alex MacIver, again as you know, played with the Rutherglen for many years and can be seen sitting far left in the front row.\n\nYou also will be aware that Rutherglen P/M, Jimmy Baxter [standing, far left in the picture above] was the uncle of Donald Campbell who is well known to you and is/was piper to the Vice Chancellor of Glasgow University and brother of politico Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s right hand man during his Downing Street years. Donald’s father, also Donald, is shown in the photo below with Alex MacIver leading the Grand March at the annual Keighley & District Caledonian Society Ball in Yorkshire:\n\nThe Rutherglen Pipe Band enjoyed considerable popular notoriety with their own annual Tartan Ball which took place in the Trades House, Glassford Street, Glasgow, where the RSPBA have been holding their AGMs recently. In this image from the Ru’glen Ball [below], Alex MacIver is in the back row and centre front is Nessie McFarlane, centre front, who was P/M Jimmy Baxter’s sister:\n\nTo freely access the music and some associated tales of P/M Alex MacIver’s compositions please visit www.214BB.com.\n\nSure and stedfast,\n\nHector Russell, Helensburgh\n\nJohn McLellan DCM, Dunoon\n\n25/11/15\n\nHi Rab,\n\nIan McLellan here. Just a quick message regarding your article about John McLellan’s tune South Hall. An excellent observation on your part regarding the gracing of the tune. P/M John Mackenzie of the Queen Victoria school pointed this out to me many moons ago after I had heard him playing it at the Argyllshire Gathering in the late sixties. In case you didn’t know John McLellan is a distant relation of mine. He was my grandfather’s cousin.\n\nOne other thing Robert, his surname is spelt McLellan, not Maclellan. Keep up the good work.\n\nRegards\n\nIan McLellan, Bearsden\n\nSouth West Piping & Drumming Academy\n\n25/11/15\n\nDear Mr Wallace,\n\nJust a note to thank you for your recent blog about piping in the South West. I have just been showing my in-laws, Sandy and Linda Gordon, and they were delighted.\n\nThe activities of the SWSPDA are developing very satisfactorily – well attended workshops across the region and increasing involvement in schools. By popular acclaim, the two Summer Schools have been hugely successful. We are very lucky to have the enthusiasm of all our Trustees and especially the piping and drumming tutors you mention in your blog. I hope to see Callum Moffat at the Glenfiddich one day!\n\nWe expect it to take years of perseverance to see a difference in the region’s pipe bands – but we are enjoying the whole process. Our youngsters are improving their skills with all the personal benefits that brings, and who knows, perhaps some of them will find that their playing provides an important part of the direction for their life. Thanks again for a very positive and helpful blog.\n\nKind regards,\n\nBob Lee, Dumfries-shire\n\nJohn Burgess\n\n18/11/15\n\nDear Rob,\n\nThank you for the nice article on John D. When I first went to Edinburgh Castle in January 1944 a few of us went down to a Piping Society meeting run by I think a P/M J.O. Duff and one night this wee boy in shorts trousers and the regular school stockings got up had his pipes tuned and played, Abercairney Highlanders: a young nine or ten year old JD. He did play an MSR too but I do not recollect the strathspey/reel; an eye opener. In Willie’s Room he had a picture of him on the mantlepiece.\n\nYour reference to his performance in the Clasp is something I remember as yesterday. The standing ovation was not for John’s attire but for his portrayal of the ground, variation one and doubling of Ronald MacDonald. I had seldom heard anything like it then or since. He portrayed intense sadness where as today it is devoid of this. In my book I tried to convey John’s timing where he did not play conventional echo movements but softened them to a soft glide to the last note in the phrase; an amazing musical performance. I recall your old teacher Bob Hardie remarking there and then, that it was the best music he had ever heard. If anyone has a recording of that performance it should be on all the websites.\n\nThanks again for the memories.\n\nYours aye,\n\nJimmy McIntosh\n\nThe Birl\n\n10/11/15\n\nRab,\n\nHave you ever had success teaching an established player a different way to play a birl? A band mate of mine has been playing for over 25 years, and always loved playing tunes with lots of birls in them. Over the past few years he’s developed a problem with the bottom two fingers on his right hand starting to move in unison when playing a birl. He has always played a double tap or tap-drag, if you will, style of birl. Any suggestions? Thanks.\n\nRobert McCarthy\n\n• The best way to form the birl is that used by most of today’s top professionals: the ‘seven’ – down over the hole and then a tuck in after the second stroke. I was origianlly taught the up and down, straight finger way and then when I was about 15 moved to the tap and drag you mention. When I joined Muirheads band, RG Hardie, the Pipe Major, insisted on my changing to the ‘seven’ and I worked hard at it until I had it the way he wanted it. So it is possible to change. However the symptoms you describe sound to me like a dystonia (not that I know much about these things). I would suggest recourse to a doctor and thence to a specialist to see if there is anything that can be done. In the meantime, your friend might find the ‘up and down’ straight finger version easier to form (the problem might be the tucking in after the tap). He should not stop playing and if the birl problem becaome insurmountable he can substiture doublings on low A for the birl where appropriate. Better that than giving up. Hope this is of some use. There is a comprehensive chapter on the birl with appropriate exercises in my tutor book. RW.\n\nLondon Clasp Competition\n\n2/11/15\n\nHi Rab,\n\nI read your article this morning. Yes, London has always had an attraction for me too. I first went down with Hughie about 1968/9 and in those days it was in Buckingham Gate – the headquarters of The London Scottish – what a great atmosphere – then on to the RAF Club whose caretaker was Gordon Spiers for a great time in the evening! I judged the ‘Clasp’ Piobaireachd Grades 1 and 2 but I was pleasantly surprised with the standard of most but also with the enthusiasm of all the competitors.\n\nThe results were as follows :\n\nGrade 1 (7 played)\n\n1. Gordon Hislop\n\n2. Sean Maloney\n\n3. Enora Morice\n\n4. Brieuc Bozec\n\n5. Ian Graham\n\n6. Andrew Park\n\nGrade 2 (10 played)\n\n1. John Campbell\n\n2. Tom Broderick\n\n3. Gill Cairns\n\n4. Andrea Zingg\n\n5. James Carnegie\n\n6. George Gordon\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t bring away a list of the tunes played, but I do remember that Enora Morice played a fair rendering of Melbank’s Salute (book version). Both she and Brieuc are from Brittany and are students of Herve le Floch and played good tunes on very good instruments. Gordon Hislop’s performance was excellent and would not have been out of place in a Grade 2 Professional contest. It transpires that he is a student of Tom Spiers. His technique, phrasing and instrument were to be commended. The other notable and very robust performance was from Sean Maloney from Ireland\n\nGood time had by all!\n\nRegards,\n\nTom Johnstone\n\nRob,\n\nJust a wee remark on today’s Pittsburgh news on the Piping Press. I remember the Westinghouse band when I was growing up. Since both of my parents were from Motherwell, we of course attended any Scottish events we could in the area. We actually lived very close to the Westinghouse plant in East Pittsburgh – in fact, in Turtle Creek, where the Secy. Sam Brown lived. I took my first dancing lessons in Wilkinsburg, where the President Jim Harris lived, and where the band practiced! In addition, the Pipe Major you mentioned, James Dryburgh, was the first and only owner of my now-treasured silver and ivory Lawrie pipes, which have, as you can imagine, a very sweet and mellow tone. After his wife passed away, he no longer had any interest in playing them, and since I was the first choice for the next owner, they were ‘gifted’ to me for the unbelievable sum of $100!!\n\nSo the article brought back many memories of my childhood, and it is nice to know that Mr. Dryburgh’s wonderful set of pipes is still being played these many, many years later!\n\nYours,\n\nJoyce McIntosh, South Carolina\n\n• Many thanks for sharing that Joyce. RW\n\nHighland Games League\n\n8/10/15\n\nGood Afternoon All\n\nI attach herewith the SHGA League as far as I can. I am looking for results for Aberfeldy, Strathardle and Inverkeithing if anyone can help. I know that the Roseneath Competition will be on 17th October and the results then will determine who wins the League. Could the Secretary of the CPA send this out to members and ask then to check their placings? I am sorry that it is on a spread sheet but it is the only way I can do a big number. Thanks for yoru help.\n\nPatricia Grant.\n\nSHGA Piping League 2015\n\nRun Rig Tune\n\n8/10/15\n\nHi Robert,\n\nHave had a request from an old fisherman to play a tune when he goes called ‘Chi Mi N Tir’. Runrig’s Donnie Munro used to sing it. I have tried to get it written for pipes without success, would it be possible for you to do it? Don’t need anything complicated just so long as it sounds like the song. Will be more than happy to pay for however much time it takes you. Have been trying for a year to get this for pipes and think I am going to run short of time if I don’t get it soon. If you can’t find it will send you disc with song on it.\n\nRon Aitkenhead, Caithness.\n\n• No bother Ron; please send the disc on. Will get tune to you ASAP. Good to talk to you at Inverness…RW\n\nPiobaireachd Discussion\n\n2/10/15\n\nMr Wallace,\n\nI am the publisher and director of the Alt Pibroch Club. I will be publishing a proposal for consideration of the broader piping public at learning.altpibroch.com. It has to do with sensitising both judges and competitors to the available options and choices as evidenced in the primary source material of earliest pibroch notations (staff and canntaireachd). This is one of two proposal I will be making publicly for discussion.\n\nI would appreciate your feedback. I would appreciate even more a chance to converse (Skype or email) when your schedule allows (I’ve done many such ‘interviews’ on the site – you can find them under the ‘Interviews’ category link on the right side of the page).\n\nI am reaching out to you, because I will also be presenting my work, my roadmap and my suggestions, at next March’s Piobaireachd Society meeting, and it would be (I think) a nice thing if members got a glimpse of what I’m doing beforehand, so the ensuing discussion would be fluent and dynamic.\n\nFinally, I am going to be making a comment in your Comments section regarding an interesting statement you made about a particular competitors performance at last year’s Oban. It may come across as confrontation or disrespectful. It is not intended as such. It is, however, intended to lay out for consideration the kinds of issues that competitors who are interested in presenting different interpretations may confront.\n\nIt is of great interest to me and my project that we open up options at competitions in such a way as to ally concerns typically expressed by competitors when asked why they do not explore alternative interpretations. Perhaps I’m reading your comment wrongly. Even so, it is an interesting ‘aside’ that allow for the possibility of discussion, I think. So, I am hoping you will receive in the light of an invitation to dialogue. Thanks! I look forward to hearing from you, and eventually meeting you in person, perhaps in Glasgow!\n\nJ David Hester, PhD\n\nAlt Pibroch Club\n\n• Happy to help in any way I can Mr Hester. Nothing wrong with a bit of confrontation, at least with civilised individuals like yourself, so please fire away and I’ll do what I can to repel all boarders!……Ed.\n\nCompetition Notes\n\n24/9/15\n\nMr. Wallace,\n\nCan I say, having access to these notes is simply wonderful. If only we can convince the conveners that live streaming shouldn’t threaten attendance or income!\n\nMonktonhall Pipe Band\n\n24/9/15\n\nYes, that’s Les [Hutt] in the back. P/M was Hugh Muir. When we first rolled into the Pans, as the locals call it [Prestonpans], the band didn’t compete apart from the Miners’ Gala every year. (Shotts used to compete there as well). The original name of the band was Preston Links Colliery, which I believe was where Cockenzie Power Station got built. Les could give you better info. When the Links pit shut, sponsorship was transferred to Monktonhall.\n\nI used to ponder why so many pits had pipe and brass bands, and the only thing I can come up with was if you’re lying on your side in a puddle a few thousand feet beneath the earth’s surface howkin’ away at a coal seam the music was probably the only thing keeping you sane. And I remember trotting behind my old man at practices watching him fix pipes. Every piper who worked down the pit had drone reeds that were black from exhaled coal dust. I used to scrape the stuff off. Kinda like resin. Then again most folk smoked in those days too.\n\nLooking forward to the next SFP&DA at Boca Raton; it means ‘rat’s mouth’ and was used as a base for pirates at one time.\n\nDonald McBride, Kansas\n\nHi there Rab. Its Dougie McBride here. I was recently asked if I knew the name of the album the Monktonhall Colliery band made many years ago. I think it was yourself that played a track on the radio just after my father died. Any chance you can remember what it was called. The album that is. The track was King George Vs Army. Hopefully you can help . Much appreciated. I`ve just remembered I was in Italy with you and think it was yourself that got a tour round the Vatican with myself and Ian McGeehie.\n\nCheers, Dougie\n\n• I remember playing a track for your dad Dougie but don’t think it was from an album. Would it have been his tune ‘Dunaskin Glen’ that he gave me for the Glasgow Collection?\n\nPiper Laidlaw\n\n24/9/15\n\nRab,\n\nI see you have Laidlaw on your site today. To hear more about Laidlaw from Colin Campbell and to hear the tune dedicated to Laidlaw played by John Patrick watch our 5th concert in the series Pipers and Pipe Music of the Great War available now on livestream.\n\nJeannie Campbell, Glasgow\n\nBook Search\n\n16/9/15\n\nHi Rob,\n\nJust read the review [of my book] by Duncan and would like to thank him. On the question of embellishments, I should tell you that over here they are taught incorrectly; this was something that happened in the 60s early 70s. You may remember the ‘Three Wise Men’, Seumas MacNeill, Capt. John MacLellan and John McFadyen. When they got together and formed the Institute of Piping they taught the dre as an E gracenote on low A and the dare as an F gracenote on E, this is in J McGillivary’s book and Worrall repeats this in his lecture on the PD web.\n\nThe first year I was at the school in Timmins I saw two boys doing this, asked them who was teaching them – Seumas. I went and spoke to him and told him it was wrong, demonstrated how John MacDonald [Inverness] taught it, and I have to give him credit, he said, ‘Jimmy you are correct, we have made a mistake with that’. John MacFadyen taught here and gave it to Ed Neigh in Canada and John MacLellan gave it to Archie Cairns.\n\nIn the fosgailte instead of sounding B, C or D to the E, they are going to low A with an E gracenote. Most of the poor crunluaths comes from accenting the low A with the E gracenote.\n\nI see so much of this when judging over here. If you look at the old books the E and F are clearly shown.\n\nRab,\n\nYou hit the nail on the head with your pipingpress.com article about Crieff. ‘Family Day Out Syndrome’ is the perfect description for the trap into which so many games on both sides of the pond fall. Over here, too many games committees see piping as a money pit, but fail to realize the money and visitors that these events bring into the games. Here in the Midwest, we have had several games drop piping altogether because it’s too expensive. How shortsighted!\n\nWhat happened with the Lochaber Gathering date? I saw it’s been moved to later in August.\n\nAll the best,\n\nMatt Pantaleoni, St Louis, Missouri\n\n• There’s been a double booking at Lochaber Matt, hence the re-scheduling to August 22. Be a good one to prepare for Oban. RW\n\nDenver Cardwell\n\n17/3/15\n\nHi Robert,\n\nI appreciate your personal appreciation of my late father. I have\n\nviewed the letters page and I notice I omitted the year 1985 the\n\noccasion the All Ireland triumph which was all the more special as the band was only able to compete at the contest every other year owing to the political situation which existed at the time.\n\nRegards\n\nAlan Cardwell\n\nSPA Trophies\n\n11/3/15\n\nSir,\n\nWith regard to the article of17 February about lost SPA trophies, I had a look at some old photographs. I found one which was part of several my uncle, a keen photographer, took of me on the day of the 1983 Uist and Barra competition, which I was going to play in. (As an aside, I won the Class B Piobaireachd that day, aged 17, in my first professional competition. (What happened thereafter?!!lol). The photograph has a number of trophies which I had won in the preceding year (1982). One appears to be the Chisholm Cup. I would have handed that back to Angus J. McLellan who was my tutor. Perhaps it will help pinpoint time frames? Some of the other trophies in the picture I can’t remember, but Jeannie [Campbell] is welcome to view it, if of help. I don’t think there are any of those listed/pictured in the article.\n\nBest regards,\n\nGraeme Gibson, ex-Strathclyde Police Pipe Band\n\nMuirhead’s Drummers\n\n25/2/15\n\nGood morning Rab. Firstly I would I like to say how much I enjoyed the concert last night in Dollar Academy. I worked occasionally in Shetland and there is a joke in Lerwick about the Swan fishing vessel. It is widely advertised as being a restored fishing boat when in fact it is really a replica. As I understand there was only about 10 feet of the original boat left when work commenced on the ‘rebuild’. (Another story!)\n\nI have attached a scanned copy of the photograph taken with the bass and tenor drummer from Muirheads in about 1967 at North Berwick Highland Games. Please thank Peter [Anderson] again for supplying the names.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDerek Dunn.\n\n• Thanks for that Derek and great to hear from Peter that Jim and Jock are still going strong. A couple of real characters…Ed.\n\nP/M Denver Cardwell\n\n25/2/15\n\nHi Robert,\n\nI have recently read a number of articles in relation to our late\n\nfather Denver, and appreciate the kind comments and acknowledgement of his valued and lenghty service to the piping world.\n\nThe reason I am forwarding this email is to clarify a few points for\n\nfuture references. There have been a few articles where Denver has been placed in his early 70s, and whilst he would have had a chuckle about this if he was still here, he was in fact 78 on his passing.\n\nDad played in the early days in the Grade 1 RUC Pipes and Drums and I am now the holder of his All-Ireland medal from that year. I believe it is the one and only time the band won the trophy at that level. In relation to his funeral service, although he lived most of his early life in the Portadown area, his funeral service took place in Holywood Methodist Church, County Down. There was a huge turnout at the service and the family really appreciated the level of support then and still today.\n\nThank you for your continued contribution through your articles and on the TV and I wish you well for 2015 and on. Please feel free to contact me regarding any factual matter re our late dad.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAlan Cardwell, on behalf of the family circle.\n\nSPA Amateur Winners\n\n21/2/15\n\nRab,\n\nDid you notice that Hector’s list [below] was in my handwriting? To be accurate, it was not a list of just the MacDougall Gillies winners as the April and October winners alternated. The April winners got the Gillies Trophy and the October winners got (and still get) the Farquhar MacRae trophy which dates back to 1918. I’ll attach a list of the MacDougall Gillies winners.\n\nYours,\n\nJeannie Campbell\n\n• Thanks for keeping the record straight Jeannie…Ed.\n\nMacDougall Gillies Medal and Trophy\n\n16/2/15\n\nRobert,\n\nYour allusion to Grain in Hides and Corn in Sacks [in the second instalment of our article looking back at piping in the 1930s], and also to the missing MacDougall Gilies Medal, reminded me of some related points which may amuse.\n\nThe last year the late Ronnie Lawrie judged the Open Piobaireachd at Oban, I was sitting in the back row in the Corran Halls with May McLellan, Ian’s wife. Between the end of the ceol mor and the march strathspey and reel event, Ronnie wandered up to where we were sitting to speak with May. She introduced me to him. As he looked down at me from a great height he gave me one of his looks which confirmed years of experience in ‘Glasgow’s Finest’.\n\n‘Tell me your name again?,’ he said.\n\n‘Hector Russell,’ I replied.\n\n‘I remember you. I judged you as a boy in the MacDougall Gillies Piobaireachd competition in the old Highlanders [Institute].’\n\nAnd he continued, ‘I will tell you something else. You played ‘Grain in Hides and Corn in Sacks’! You may not know this, but Robert Reid was sitting in the audience that day. At the end, when everyone had played, Reid got a hold of me and told me to make sure you got first place or else!’\n\nAnd so it turned out. I was announced as first with Dr. John MacAskill second. What Ronnie was recounting had taken place more than fifty years before. As you know Robert, like you, I was taught by Alex Ibell who in turn sent me to John Finlay for tuition. With John I learned both light music and particularly piobaireachd. ‘Grain in Hides’ was one of my first tunes and John had himself been tutored in that tune by Reid and had confirmed his interpretation with Bob Hardie. I think Bob had played the tune with some success which perhaps your records will confirm. [I believe Hardie won the Senior Piobaireachd at Oban with it. RW]\n\nAt the competition the trophy, as you know, was presented and immediately removed back for safekeeping. Winners were given the McDougall Gillies Medal to hold for the year and a Peter Henderson medal to retain. The Medal, as may be seen from the images, I have sent had an added flap where all the names of past winners were inscribed. This record mirrors the names shown on the trophy. Unfortunately the medal appears to have been lost as have so many famous piping trophies. The winners from 1960 to 1971 are as per the following list which features such notables as Tom Speirs, Anne Sinclair, John Wilson, John MacAskill, Donald Lindsay, USA, Jim Wark, James Hardie and Derek Boyd and Douglas Elmslie (both ex-Muirheads).\n\nTo finish, Ian McLellan has spoken of Ronnie’s remarkable memory for names, dates, events to which the above would attest.\n\nYours,\n\nHector Russell, Helensburgh\n\nP/M Alex MacIver\n\n4/2/15\n\nRobert,\n\nThanks for posting the P/M MacIver article and for the adjustments you made which improve my efforts. Forgive me in the interests of accuracy in confirming a couple of points:\n\n• Danes Drive, according to Ishbel’s eulogy, was the MacIver home from 1935 so it was a little piece of Lewis for nearly eighty years. It has not yet been sold but it appears it is now being prepared in readiness for this to happen.\n\n• The article relating to Donald MacLeod’s tune is not included on www.214bb.com web site but it will be added shortly. The draft has the information about the Donald MacLeod Tassie and this seems an appropriate place to record this information.\n\n• You mention, and I have seen this elsewhere, that Alex Ibell learned his piping and played with the Whiteinch band? Is this where his connection with Willie Francie comes from? Willie, our folklore has it, was with the Clan MacRae band and was a well known personality working in Yarrows.\n\nThis photo [above] from the website album is labelled as 1934. It is unique in showing Alex Ibell (far left) as Pipe Major. Just behind Alex’s left shoulder may be Alex MacIver. He was born on 23-06-1918 so time line would work. The attachment is a better version of the image than this one.\n\nSure and Stedfast,\n\nHector Russell\n\n• Alex occasionally talked about the ‘old Whiteinch band’ where he had played. I seem to remember a noted piper John Wallace as being from Whiteinch in years gone past so I wonder if there was some connection there. Perhaps a reader can help….Ed.\n\nP/M Ian McLellan\n\n4/2/15\n\nRob,\n\nI am enjoying the interview with Iain McLellan. We taught at many schools together; a very good teacher. I liked Tom McAllister and Alex Duthart. I thought more of Tom than John. In 1976 the RSPBA ran a quartet competition in Edinburgh ( judges undercover). I took a couple of quartets through for the new NCR band, no kilts yet. The result: 1st Edinburgh Police 2nd NCR 3rd Shotts. John came up to me and said, ‘that’s the last bloody time you’ll beat us’. Next year the 2nd and 3rd were reversed so I guess he was happy.\n\nYours,\n\nJimmy McIntosh, South Carolina\n\nPipe Band Magazine Back Nos.\n\n30/1/15\n\nMr Wallace,\n\nThank you – the magazines arrived today (the surface mail must have been on a hovercraft!). Issue 11 of the Piper Press had Donald Bain on the cover – it was a coincidence as I’m currently learning Donald Bain’s Bairns.\n\nChris MacKnight, Halifax, NS\n\n• Glad they arrived safely Chris. Donald is fondly remembered by all who knew him and Jim Barrie’s tune (John MacFadyen Book 2) a fine memorial.\n\nSean McGuire Tune (see original letter below)\n\n30/1/15\n\nThanks Robert. I did get the title.\n\nSean McGuire called it Lord Pottingers. However it turned out to be John Pottingers compliments to Ronnie Cooper.\n\nThank you for your kind assistance.\n\nPaul MacDonald,\n\nCape Breton\n\nEl Alamein\n\n19/1/15\n\nHello Robert,\n\nHaving read that there is some interest in wartime tunes, and that you are involved to some extent, I have sent a copy of an old advertisement from R.G.Lawrie Ltd. mentioning the 6/8 tune ‘El Alamein’ composed by P/M Wm Denholm K.O.S.B. [see letter from Peter MacLeod, Ontario, below for a picture of P/M Denholm and see the poster here], two parts of which are in the Scots Guards Book 2 as a two-part air. Hope it reaches you and naturally you can use it as you like.\n\nRegards\n\nMaurie De Hayr, Queensland, Australia\n\nFavourite 2/4 Marches\n\n18/1/15\n\nSir,\n\nMy all time favourites on 2/4 marches and all light music were/are P/M Angus MacDonald and P/M Iain Morrison as both played from the heart. There are a few pipers that come close today, however in the bands I feel that the round style of playing is taking the music away with medleys overdone with harmony/counterpoint. Everyone in my opinion should get back to learning March, Strathspey and Reels properly again and in all bands as Muirhead and Sons and Shotts and Dykehead used to play them.\n\nAnother sore point I have had for many years are competent judges taking points off a competitor’s score for a slight slip and therefore letting the not so musical player beat them. I am mentioning this fact because I would like to hear music played from the heart by more pipers, rather than safe playing designed to win competitions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDrew Aitken\n\n• Great players and great bands Drew. Here is P/M Angus in full flight:\n\nhttps://pipingpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-angus-excerpt.mp3\n\nIt’s from his ‘Worlds Greatest Pipers’ CD and it can be bought here. As regards judging, I think there is a more enlightened view abroad today with minor slips being considered just that.\n\nDouglas Elmslie\n\n18/1/15\n\nRab,\n\nWas saddened to hear that Dougie Elmslie had passed away. When we won the Juvenile Worlds in 1964 (Dam Park, Ayr, – that first nerve-racking outing for you and I!) you’ll remember Dougie was one of the 214BB ‘old hands’. It was his last year playing with the band, before going on to help win more prizes for the senior bands in which he played. Will always remember his cheerful grin and good-natured demeanour.\n\nArchie [Maclean], Inverness\n\nSean McGuire Tune\n\n18/1/15\n\nHello,\n\nI’m wondering if you could help me find the name of this tune as played by the great Sean McGuire. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_FqVk8RN3c second reel starting at 1:20. I heard it may have an association Whistlebinkies.\n\nThanking you in advance.\n\nPaul MacDonald, Cape Breton\n\n• Sorry Paul, can’t place it at all and I don’t think we could match the brilliant Sean! Perhaps another reader can help….Ed.\n\nWillie Bryson Tune\n\n13/1/15\n\nMr Wallace,\n\nAttached is a photo of a tune by P/M William Bryson which I believe to be unpublished. I found it in a hand written manuscript by an Andrew Donaldson from the Kinglassie Colliery Prize Pipe Band, dated 1952.\n\nChris MacKnight,\n\nHalifax, NS,\n\nCanada.\n\n• Thanks for that Mr McKnight. Andy made a significant contribution to piping and pipe bands over many, many years as everyone knows. He is being well looked after in a local care home and this might be a good opportunity to send him our best wishes. I am sure many of Andy’s former bandmates and pupils will recognise the script. He must have transcribed dozens of tunes in his time. Does anyone know anything about the ‘Fifeshire Piping Society’? If so please pass on any info….Ed.\n\nTunes from WW1\n\n5/1/15\n\nSir,\n\nI would very much like a copy of the music for Kemmel Hill, if you have it. Any format would be great, pictures, pdfs, Bagpipe Music Writer, or if you have them assembled in a book, I will purchase it from you, cheerfully.\n\nYours,\n\nJames MacNaughton MSc RPA\n\nPhD Candidate\n\nHistoric Archaeology\n\nUniversity of Idaho\n\n• I’ve emailed Donald MacPhee who played it on the night of the WW1 Pipes Tunes concert and asked him to forward a copy to you Mr MacNaughton…Ed.\n\nPipe Major Peter Bain\n\n5/1/15\n\nHi Rab,\n\nFestive greetings and all the best for 2015. Enjoyed the article on my old piobaireachd teacher Peter Bain written by my old boss (head of art department) Angus MacPhee. Two Glasgow-born, Gaelic-speaking, bagpipe-playing art teachers (both with the initials AM) in the same school was bit of a rarity!\n\nPlease find attached a rather faded photo of the 1st Bn. Scots Guards pipers circa 1927. The boy piper seated in the foreground is Peter Bain. The Pipe-Corporal seated 2nd from right is my father John Maclean (North Uist) – he looked after Peter, both of them being Gaelic-speakers helped. The Pipe-Major (seated centre) John Donald MacDonald (‘John the Bap’) from Sutherland was also a Gaelic-speaker. Seated 3rd from the right is Malcolm ‘Baggy’ MacMillan (Perthshire), Hugh’s father. [See detail below].\n\nMy father and Peter judged together for years in the 1950s and 60s as RSPBA judges. After I left the 214 BB, my father sent me to Peter for piobaireachd lessons at Bellahouston Academy where he held evening classes. Peter was a lovely man, calm and laid-back. John Burgess told me a wonderful story (in his own inimitable fashion) about Peter’s ‘laid-back’ approach at one outdoor competition.\n\nJohn was a young competitor at the time, and saw a tall, smartly dressed Peter Bain arriving to compete. John watched as Peter opened his pipe-box – and a chaotic tangle of drones, trailing hemp, drone reeds, chanter reeds etc. was extracted.\n\n(Not quite what John expected of a double gold medal-winner and player of Peter’s stature). John continued to watch as Peter sorted out the bits and pieces, and after a while eventually assembled his bagpipe. When Peter struck up, John said, ‘It was wonderful – what an instrument. And a prize-winning instrument on the day.’\n\nFond memories. Yes, many of us owe a lot to Peter Bain.\n\nKindest regards to you and your family,\n\nYours,\n\nArchie [MacLean, Inverness]\n\n*The same to you and yours Archie and thanks for that fascinating piece of piping history. RW.\n\nGold Medal Winners\n\n26/12/14\n\nDear Robert,\n\nMany thanks for your wonderful website stuffed with plenty of news and topics about the noble instrument and its best masters.\n\nI read the list of winners of gold medal; do you have any information about the prize pipes , when they started and names of famous makers like Duncan MacDougall or Alexander Glen. Thanking you\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nYves Tyson\n\nFrance\n\n• We hope cover these sorts of topics in the fullness of time Yves and would ask contributors on these subjects to forward any articles to us. Piping history is one of the most popular topics on the site particularly at this time of year when there is not much happening on the contest field in Scotland….RW\n\nMissing Trophy\n\n13/12/14\n\nDear Mr Wallace,\n\nI refer to our telephone conversation of today. I also refer to the PP Editor’s Blog of 12/12/14.\n\nRegarding the Braemar trophy you referred to, my daughter has this trophy and we are wholly apologetic for our failure to return it within time. She went off to university, I went on a lengthy training course offshore, and matters fell into abeyance.\n\nWe have had contact from the current holder of the title, and as I understand it, I am to deliver the trophy to one of his practice venues at the earliest. I will most certainly undertake to resolve this without delay. I will also seek to contact Mrs. P Grant to keep her informed and to apologise personally to her. Please be advised that we regret this matter totally and any difficulties this has caused. The matter will be rectified directly. Can you please send me contact details for Mrs. P Grant. With thanks to pipingpress.com and regards,\n\nDavid Jack\n\n13/12/14\n\nHi Robert,\n\nI saw the item regarding the missing trophy in your blog. Christie is a former pupil of mine at George Heriot’s. She’s moved over to Belfast and studies at Queens. I will pass on the request for the return of the missing trophy.\n\nKind regards,\n\nWillie McIntyre\n\n• Thanks to Willie and to Mr Jack for their quick response. Mrs Grant’s email is p.grant18@btinternet.com\n\nDonald Maclean and Piobaireachd Article\n\n13/12/14\n\nRob,\n\nYour article about P/M Donald Maclean of Lewis was of interest. Here is a recording from the Piobaireachd Society website of him playing My King has Landed in Moidart at the 1952 London competition.\n\nAlso, James Campbell’s balanced comments caught the eye and I look forward to seeing more of what he says. Paul Ross’s article of 4th November ‘The Search for Everyman’s Piobaireachd’ would probably put him in what James might call the ‘revisionist’ camp. This is also being explored on www.altpibroch.com.\n\nEverybody seems agreed that the ‘bones’ are the same; it’s just how much you make the flesh wobble that’s different. And the common factor surely is connecting. That comes from the heart, and is as apparent in the playing of Bob Brown, Robert Reid or Stuart Liddell as it is in that of Allan MacDonald. The copyist will never be the master.\n\nBest Regards\n\nJack [Dr Jack Taylor, President of the Piobaireachd Society]\n\nBratach and Glenfiddich\n\n5/12/14\n\nDear Rab,\n\nI have a student looking for a list of winners of the Bratach Gorm, Gillies Cup, and Glenfiddich Piobaireachd and their tunes. Someone mentioned you might have compiled such a list?\n\nThanks for you assistance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJori Chisholm\n\n• Here’s something from the recent programmes from London and Blair Jori. Click on the links to read reports on this year’s contests. Trust the tunes are going well for next year. RW. And now Glenfiddich – we take it the first 1987 should read 1985:\n\nThe Winnipeg Project\n\n4/12/14\n\nHi Rob,\n\nI was in touch with Yvonne over Facebook, and she recommended I get in contact with you at these email addresses. I recently released a music book project for the great Highland bagpipe called ‘The Winnipeg Project’. Attached is a cover photo and press release. I was wondering if you could put something in the Piping Press. All proceeds from this project are going towards the Canadian Mental Health Association – Winnipeg Branch. Thank you for your time, and on a personal note, I was a piping student of yours at the Regina School of Highland Arts many years ago.\n\nAll the best,\n\nNathan Mitchell\n\nwww.winnipegcollection.com\n\n(204) 470-6063\n\n* Has been done Nathan and your mention of the Regina school brings back fond memories of my time running the class there. I don’t know if it is still going but I know that Rob Kinnear has a very successful camp at Lake Diefenbaker. Good to see the teaching continuing. All success with the book and please pass on my regards to Robert and Graham (Schmidt) and other former members of the school…….RW.\n\nMajor Manson at Clachantrushal\n\n2/12/14\n\nRobert,\n\nOn my trip to Lewis in 2013, I went to the west side of the island and took the photos below. Clachantrushal is the largest Truiseil Standing Stone in Scotland standing six metres high.\n\nMajor Manson AT Clachantrushal was composed by P/M Donald MacLean who was born in Balantrushal, a village on the west side of Lewis, and where the stone resides. He composed the tune during his time as prisoner of war, after being captured at St. Valery. Major Manson was a retired Canadian Army Officer who worked in Glasgow as a silversmith. He visited the MacLean home in Balantrushal during the 1930s and gave Donald a set of engraved silver pipes and at the same time paid a visit down the road to the Standing Stone. (This was also the site of the last battle between the Macaulays and Morrisons a few hundred years ago—oh those Lewismen!) There’s a few Truchals for you. There are other famous tunes with the name Major Manson in the title.\n\nEnjoy the Pipingpress.com and all the news—and have spread the web site in the Fall 2014, 48th Highlanders Pipes and Drums Newsletter.\n\nYours,\n\nPeter K. MacLeod\n\n48th Highlanders Pipes and Drums Association\n\n(Thornhill, Ontario)\n\n• Thanks for that Peter; very interesting. For more on P/M Donald Maclean see our Famous Pipers pages.\n\nJames Robertson, Piper to Breadalbane\n\n24/11/14\n\nHi Rab,\n\nI have a client in her seventies who was talking to me about her grandfather James Robertson. He was a regular solo piping winner at various contests in the 19th century. She has attached a photo of him and I took some photos of two of his medals and his 2nd at the Northern meeting in 1875. She sent me the following to go with the picture:\n\n‘This is James Robertson born 6th July 1845 at Archell/Blair Atholl, Perthshire. He was Piper to the Earl of Breadalbane. He married in\n\nEdinburgh on June 7th, 1875 and was living at 49 Brunswick Street. By 1881 he had moved to 9 Leslie Place/Street by which time on the census he was a wine and spirit merchant. My mother said that it was in Rose Street, Edinburgh, but I don’t know where about on the street. According to my mother a large copy of this photo was on show when she was a schoolgirl, in a photographic shop at the top of Leith Walk. The same family still owns the [photo] business though no longer in Leith walk. He [Robertson] apparently had a display cabinet full of piping medals. In the 1990s my mother gave his pibroch music to the piping museum opposite Theatre Royal, Glasgow.’\n\nHe seemingly won loads of contests and there were loads of other medals etc that got split between the family (she can’t get them). She was trying to piece together any info she could on him. We thought you could research him and may want to use the info in an article for your website. She’s happy for you to do this if you want.\n\nLet me know if it’s of any use and if you learn anything about him.\n\nRegards,\n\nAlan MacColl,\n\nSecretary of the 214 Boys Brigade Ex-Members Association\n\n• Mr Robertson’s collection is clearly with the National Piping Centre and perhaps someone there can have a look at it for us now that provenance has been established. This Robertson was clearly a piper of some note though we can find scant reference to him in any of our sources. He should not be confused with James Robertson, Banff, Gordon Highlanders, nor with James Robertson the Edinburgh based pipe maker who took over James Center’s premises in 1908, though they all may be related in some way. I have trawled through the British Newspaper Archive and have come up with some info re Breadalbane pipers which is now on the History pages….Ed.\n\nCultybraggan Camp\n\n23/11/14\n\nDear Editor,\n\nMy annals of Edinburgh University OTC Pipe Band would be incomplete without mentioning our periodic training at Cultybraggan Camp. Set in West Perthshire, it was a POW camp during World War 2, and in 1960 became a training camp for army cadets and Territorials. It had a pleasant ambiance which seemed to foster pranks and mischief often aimed at military dictates and often fuelled by visits to the hostelries in nearby Comrie. Our pipe band was no exception and we entered into the spirit with enthusiasm.\n\nIt so happened that our Nissan Hut was near that of Glasgow University’s Pipe Band who were rather staid and military – which simply invited out attentions. There had been heavy snow, and on our return from a ‘run ashore’ in Comrie, we quietly piled up snow at their door and windows. At Reveille they thought they were snowed in and could avoid parading. Their RSM could not be fooled, and after a terrific commotion they sheepishly emerged giving hostile looks in our direction. Retribution followed the next morning. We had an elderly corporal called Stevenson attached to us, and for comfort we moved his bed nearer the stove which was next to the door. Early in the morning the door flew open and a barrage of snowballs hit the awakening corporal. ‘Stevie’ had a stammer which somewhat inhibited the use of certain swearwords – as did the sheer volume of snow hitting him. He did not take kindly to subsequently being referred to as ‘Snow White’.\n\nIt has been said that one of the horrors of WW2 were the other ranks’ ‘latrines at Shorncliff’ – and those at Cultybraggan were equally unpleasant. Known as the ‘Magic Flute’ they consisted of a large diameter pipe with holes cut at intervals in the top and partitioned off with a hessian screen at the front to afford some privacy. A constant stream of water flowed through, followed by large flushes. The trick was to set fire to some newspapers and allow them to float through the pipe. This promptly ejected any occupants, their business unfinished. At night we carried this further by blocking the pipe with turf at its exit – flooding the parade ground by morning.\n\nOn a professional basis we practised hard as a band and received an invitation to beat retreat at Gleneagles Hotel. This went very well, so much so that one of the guests provided refreshments for the band for quite a while afterwards. When we returned to the Officer’s Mess a party was in full swing, and, not to be outdone, we joined in, feeling we had to make up for lost time. This took the form of communally imbibing beer from shell case ‘ornaments’. Unfortunately the mixture of beer, cigarette ash and residual cordite had a disastrous effect, and no piping could be attempted until later the following morning.\n\nIn spite of the various escapades of the EUOTC Pipe Band, we took our playing seriously and the annual University Pipe Band Competition was keenly contested. We also beat Retreat at Edinburgh Castle and played abroad at some Scottish events. The top photograph shows us at Cultybraggan and below that at our Reunion in 2010 forty-five years later. We enjoyed wonderful camaraderie and friendship. Ours was a large band which sadly is very difficult to raise nowadays. I enjoyed being a piper, but an Army career was not for me and I subsequently joined the ‘senior service’.\n\nYours,\n\nKenneth Macdonald, Pitlochry\n\nPP Readership\n\n23/11/14\n\nRobert,\n\nI have been hesitant to email you because I figured that you were swamped with whatever transition you were making. I want to thank you for really being a beacon of knowledge for me personally, and in turn all the people that I try to pass the information (correctly) down to. I hope you realize that while you may not hear from so many of the people that you have helped with piping, you remain a pillar to look up to in these regards.\n\nI found the Piping Press quite by accident the other day. I use the Bob Dunsire forums to keep in touch with other pipers and saw the reaction to the article referring to Gordon Walker’s clothing. Perhaps you can use the Bob Dunsire to grow your readership?\n\nI wish you and your family the best during your time of change. With my job, I am quite experienced at change and know that it can be stressful.\n\nAs far as my piping is going, I have gone a bit to the dark side and have been playing the Scottish smallpipes quite a bit! I have also transferred to the Washington, D.C. area and no longer play with my pipe band from Vermont (Catamount). That is where I most recently saw you at the World’s weeks of 2011 and 2013. My work band is still going (US Customs and Border Protection Field Operations) While we do not get the funding that the US Border Patrol gets, we get by with a short and simple tune list, and steady blowing on well-maintained pipes. Here is a nice picture from National Police Week 2014. Please put my email on your mailing list. I want to support you in any way, so please let me know.\n\nYour friend,\n\nDave Barrett, Washington DC\n\nThanks\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wanted to send a small note just to express my thanks for the superb job you do on the website.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nLondon 2014\n\n23/11/14\n\nHi Rab\n\nGood to see you on Saturday and glad to see from your article on Piping Press that you seemed to enjoy the day. As always a couple of things we can improve on and we do try to do better year on year.\n\nGiven the number of events we run in one day (and I’m aware there are varying views on this but as you have said yourself in the past ‘where else can the juveniles ‘rub shoulders’ with the premier players’), the KCEC [Kensington Conference Centre] is the only venue which can accommodate us in terms of rooms, tuning etc. A couple of years back we could not get the venue on the first Saturday of November and sought out an alternative. After spending lots of time and wearing out a lot of shoe leather, we concluded there was nowhere else suitable in central London and had to put the date back a week (causing all sorts of complications due to clashes with Remembrance Sunday, the London Lord Mayor’s Show and other events). Also KCEC is such a popular venue that it is always booked on the preceding Friday years in advance making it difficult for us to even get in and prepare let alone running some events on the Friday evening! No magical solutions I’m afraid but rest assured every year we look at all the options.\n\nA minor point in your article. The JB Robertson Premier March event was this year run separately following feedback from those eligible to compete, and not at the behest of Robbie’s family.\n\nBest regards\n\nRoddy Livingstone, Vice-President SPSL\n\n* Thanks for that Roddy and for clearing up the issue of the JB Robertson March. It is always laudable when promoters listen to competitors, but experience has shown that it is not always wise to accept their recommendations. Witness the tuning situation at the Glenfiddich, also driven by competitor desire, where it results in an over-extended event with the paying public’s interest, at least in this regard, rather neglected. The Uist and Barra competition on the other hand is a model of efficiency with a guaranteed finish of 5pm at the latest, though they have nothing like the number of performances you have at London. I think it a credit to the SPSL that they try to give an opportunity to play to as many pipers as possible (and I would agree with Andrew Wright’s comments in his review yesterday), but there are limits to what can comfortably be achieved in a day as your president indicated in his closing remarks. RW\n\nHome Guard Pipe Bands\n\n22/11/14\n\nSir,\n\nFurther to recent correspondence in the piping press, The Glasgow Battalion of The Home Guard had a pipe band, and when the Btn marched through Glasgow in 1940 they were led by a band resplendent in No 1s and feather bonnets; possibly The Glasgow City Police Pipe band. ( British Pathe 1940) on YouTube. The Liverpool Battalion of The Home Guard also had a pipe band which was largely formed by The Bootle Village Pipe Band. This band is still in existence and they wear the MacKenzie\n\n(Seaforth) tartan; no doubt because the town of Bootle is adjacent to the town of Seaforth ( Merseyside). This town was so named following a marriage of a local family, the Blundells to a wealthy family from Loch Seaforth. I believe the band wore the old Seaforth cap badge but now wear the Queens Own Highlanders/ The Highlanders cap badge. The great Alex Duthart is also known to have served with a Home Guard Pipe Band.Highland Dress.\n\nColin Hughes, ex Pipes and Drums 1st Bn Queens Own Highlanders, Liverpool.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor me, and most other competitors I suspect, the real bone of contention is the wearing of jackets. While I personally feel that a well-fitted jacket will not inhibit my playing under most circumstances, when it is too hot, the level of discomfort can certainly affect my performance. And surely no competitor, organiser, judge or member of the audience wants to hear a performance adversely affected by an item of clothing which, at least in theory, is worn primarily to keep the wearer comfortable when it is wet or cold!\n\nAt one major competition I performed at this year (where jackets are required), the room became so hot that the organisers contemplated allowing competitors the option of playing without jackets, however decided against it for fear of giving some players an advantage over others who were not allowed the same choice earlier on! Sadly for those competitors who played later (like yours truly, here), the room became hotter and hotter and it was they who suffered most.\n\nHere is my view: at those particular competitions where competitors are required to wear jackets whilst performing, organisers and committees must equally be expected to provide an environment which maintains an acceptable temperature for the wearing of a wool jacket whilst performing. This would simply require the use of a thermometer. If, for whatever reason, the heating of the room became uncontrollable and exceeded the agreed temperature, then the steward would inform competitors that they would have the option of wearing a jacket or not.\n\nI think that this issue comes down to understanding and respect which ought to flow both ways between competitors and competition organisers.\n\nDecker Forrest\n\nGood Luck From Canada\n\n2011/14\n\nRobert,\n\nAll the best to you and your Pipingpress. I have already gone into it on and found it very informative and interesting. Especially the article by Bill Blacklaw, D&P Gordon’s Association. I look after the 48th Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums Association and have contact with Bill on Association matters—and I’m always on the hunt for piping, and pipe band material for our Association Newsletter and your new site fits that venue.\n\nI have passed on your Pipingpress website to some of our members and in our Fall Newsletter will make mention of it to all our members in the 48th P&D Association.\n\nAgain all the best and what I have seen so far in your pipingpress.com, it certainly will be a success.\n\nPeter K. MacLeod\n\nThornhill, Ontario\n\n48th Highlanders Pipes and Drums Association\n\nP/M William Denholm\n\n10/11/14\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen I saw the picture of William Denholm on the cover of ‘Holiday’ magazine it reminded me of the cover of a LP ‘Swing of the Kilt’ with the Gordon Highlanders Military band and a piper. So I dove into my vinyl vault. This LP came out sometime in the 50s and the piper that played on this recording was a very well known Pipe Major at the time (and I have his name somewhere and I’ll come across it another day). Incidentally he was, from what I heard, a very underrated piper and certainly played superbly on this LP with the military band.\n\nI didn’t know the piper on this LP cover was William Denholm who composed the classic El Alamein. Now I know.\n\nPeter K. MacLeod\n\n48th Highlanders Pipes and Drums Association\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI came across this photograph recently of two distinguished looking pipers which may have been taken at Aboyne Games or the Braemar Gathering in Aberdeenshire. Would any of your readers know who they are and when, approximately, this picture was taken.\n\nRegards\n\nWilliam Robertson,\n\n• Many thanks for the picture Mr Robertson. Would the piper on the right be Willie Ross? Answers please!\n\nJohn Goodenow Tune\n\n30/10/14\n\nMr. Wallace,\n\nHello from Oregon, USA. My name is Keir Todd. I started learning pipes at the St. Andrews Society of Detroit at age 11 in 1965. My first teacher ever was Mr. John Goodenow. He later went on to win the Piobaireachd Society Gold Medal (Canada) and his tune Salute to the Isle of Iona placed second in a composition contest sponsored by the Piob Society. P/M John MacLellan’s tune, The Phantom Piper, was first. Salute to the Isle of Iona is found in the Piob. Society collection of Modern Piob. I think 1980 is the publication date. There are two minor but obvious typos in the tune. I went through the tune with John himself. When I showed him the typos his response was, ‘I never looked at the printed score’. I asked him to correct them, date and sign the corrections. The first is in the last bar of the ground and the second in the toarluath.\n\nSeveral years later, John’s tune was was selected for the Clasp. P/M John Allan judged the contest in Cambridge Ontario. When John came on, P/M Allan had the grace to ask John to play his own tune. I was there for John’s performance. It occurred to me that that contest might be the only time in which a composer played him own tune, published by the Piob Society in a contest for the Clasp.\n\nI’ve attached a photo of the tune with John’s hand written corrections.\n\nCheers from ever sunny and rain drenched coastal Oregon, USA,\n\nKeir"
