        "text": "Hailing from Ohio, Iâ€™ve spent most of my academic life at Miami University where I finished my undergraduate and graduate degrees in physics and continued to teach introductory physics. My work there focused on physics education research; figuring out ways to make physics laboratory classes relevant and lectures less painful. My students would often ask me what life was like after college, and having never experienced that I decided a brief foray into industry for perspective might be worthwhile. The best take away from that 2 year experience was confirmation that my passion lies in teaching.\n\nAs an instructor my goal is to send students away with, at worst, a mild indifference for physics by taking the time to make the material approachable and understandable. At best, I aim to foster curiosity for science and the natural world while promoting a mindset built on critical thinking.\n\nAs an individual, my hobbies are generally related to the outdoors in climbing, hiking and birdwatching. To stay fit I enjoy training for triathlons and practicing/teaching yoga. Whatever free time remains after that is usually spent playing board games with friends or making things out of wood or flour (and water and salt and yeast)."
