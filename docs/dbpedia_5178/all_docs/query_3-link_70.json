        "text": "Rueben Murphy was sentenced to a minimum of 31 years behind bars\n\nA remorseless killer starts a life sentence today for the street execution of a young dad.\n\nRueben Murphy, 26, was sentenced to 31 years minimum yesterday for murder after pumping two 9mm bullets into the chest of 26-year-old Patrick Boyle on July 1, 2021.\n\n‌\n\nIn a premeditated attack, Mr Boyle was standing outside an address in Newway, off Lordens Road in Huyton, at around 5.55pm when Murphy approached on an electric bike and opened fire. The dad of a three-year-old boy - who was expecting a second child with his pregnant partner, was shot twice in the chest and pronounced dead at Whiston Hospital less than 30 minutes later.\n\nMurphy, formerly of Barkbeth Road in Huyton, was convicted of murder after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court alongside his close friend Ben Doyle, now 25, who rode the electric bike, carrying Murphy on the back, to within minutes of the murder scene. Another friend, 21-year-old Thomas Walker, was cleared of murder but admitted handling one of the bullets used to kill Mr Boyle on a date prior to the day of the shooting.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

Ben Doyle, you are now aged 25. You have both been convicted by the jury of the murder of Patrick Boyle and of offences of possession of a firearm, and possession of ammunition, both with intent to endanger life. Thomas Walker, you are now aged 21. You have pleaded guilty to an offence of possession of ammunition without a firearms certificate.\n\n“At just after 5pm on 1 July 2021, Patrick Boyle was shot twice in the chest on a residential street in Huyton by Rueben Murphy. He died shortly thereafter. This was a shocking premeditated attack in broad daylight on the streets of Liverpool. For neighbours in the area at the time, it must have been a terrifying experience.\n\n“In the hours leading up to 6pm, the shooting was planned by Rueben Murphy with his close friend Ben Doyle. Ben Doyle drove Rueben Murphy halfway to the scene on an electric bike. Both they and the bike were disguised.\n\n‌\n\n“Some time before the shooting Thomas Walker had been in possession of one of the bullets used in the shooting.\n\n“Post-mortem examination revealed two gunshot entry wounds - one to the upper right chest and the other to the upper left chest. The cause of death was determined as gunshot wounds to the chest.\n\n‌\n\n“At the time he lived in the Kirkdale area of Liverpool. He had a son, and his partner was pregnant. Many members of his family have sat through this trial, with great patience and dignity.\n\n\"Several family members have come over from Ireland to attend court today. We have listened today to his partner, Ashleigh Deans, read her victim personal statement in court with courage and to the statement of his aunt Alanna Hughes, read by his sister-in-law. We have also read the statements of his father Robert Boyle, and his sister Shauneen Boyle.\n\n“They speak eloquently and movingly of the terrible ordeal they had to endure both over the days immediately following Patrick Boyle's death and during the course of the trial and of the enduring pain of their loss. We have also heard of the impact upon his two sons, one of whom will never have known his father. It is clear that Patrick Boyle was a much loved partner, father, son, grandson, brother and nephew.\n\n‌\n\nREAD MORE: 'Loving' teen killed in motorbike crash 'made everybody laugh'READ MORE: Knives sold to underage teen with no checks for price of cola can\n\n“At the time of the events, Rueben Murphy lived at his mother's house at Barkbeth Road, Huyton. He was not working and was heavily involved in taking and supplying drugs, in particular cannabis and ketamine. He was living on benefits and income from his drug supply.\n\n\"Shortly after midday on 1 July 2021, Rueben Murphy made his way to Lyme Grove. There was then an altercation in the cul-de-sac at Lyme Grove involving Rueben Murphy, and two others Gamell Corbett and Frazer Brown. Frazer Brown knew Patrick Boyle. Immediately following that altercation, Rueben Murphy got on a bike and cycled to the Pennard Avenue area and then returned to Lyme Grove.\n\n‌\n\n\"Just after 1pm Rueben Murphy took a taxi to his home at Barkbeth Road and then returned to Lyme Grove. Closer to 2pm Ben Doyle arrived at the cul-de-sac on an electric bike. Some minutes later, he left on the bike, with its frame now wrapped in black bin bags, and rode to the Pennard Avenue area and back. This is the electric bike which would be used to take Rueben Murphy to the scene of the shooting a few hours later.\n\n\"Between 4 and 4.30pm, Rueben Murphy again took a taxi to Barkbeth Road and back. I find that, in the course of those journeys, the gun and ammunition used in the shooting was obtained by Rueben Murphy.\n\n‌\n\n\"At 5.40pm Rueben Murphy and Ben Doyle went into the back garden of 29 Lyme Grove and emerged with the electric bike, still wrapped in the black bin bags. They then rode off on the bike, with Ben Doyle driving and Rueben Murphy riding pillion. By that time, both were wearing dark clothing and with hoods up and masks. They went to find Patrick Boyle.\n\n\"Ben Doyle got off the bike at Pennard Avenue and Rueben Murphy carried on. this time as rider of the electric bike. Ben Doyle had carried Rueben Murphy to within minutes, and a very short distance from the location of the planned attack.\n\n\"At 5.46pm Patrick Boyle was seen leaving Fincham Green. That was the last CCTV footage of him before he was shot.\n\n‌\n\n\"Just after 5.56pm Rueben Murphy rode on the electric bike on Newway, Huyton. Patrick Boyle was standing in front of No 2, with two friends. Rueben Murphy approached, took out a 9mm Luger calibre self-loading firearm and shot Patrick Boyle twice in the chest from close range\n\n\"The forensic evidence suggests that it is very likely that, in total, at least three shots were fired and that Patrick Boyle may have been twisting and turning in order to avoid the bullets. Subsequently the police found two 9mm calibre cartridge cases at the scene. Thomas Walker's DNA was found on one of those cartridge cases.\n\n‌\n\n\"At around 6pm Patrick Boyle was taken to Whiston Hospital. Despite the best efforts of the medical staff, he was pronounced dead at 6.12pm.\n\n\"The sentence for murder is fixed by law. It is a life sentence. The Court must impose this life sentence and must also specify the minimum term which must elapse before you can be considered for release on license.\n\n\"If and when you are released you will remain on license for the rest of your life and liable to recall if you commit any further offence or breach the terms of that license.\n\n‌\n\n\"I am satisfied that the seriousness of the offence of murder in this case was particularly high and thus in principle falls within this category. Whilst it was you, Rueben Murphy who fired the fatal shots, you, Ben Doyle drove him part way to the scene and you were a full and willing participant in the plan which involved the use of a firearm to shoot Patrick Boyle.\n\n\"There are aggravating features of the offence which warrant an increase from this starting point. First, the shooting of Patrick Boyle was planned and premeditated to a significant degree. He was the specific target of your plan, which you put together over a number of hours during which, not only did you obtain the gun and ammunition and the electric bike. but also involved your change of clothing and the disguise of the bike. Secondly, the murder was carried out in broad daylight in a public area and within sight and sound of a number of members oi the public.\n\n\"As regards possible mitigating factors, an intention to cause serious bodily harm rather than to kill is a statutory mitigating factor. In your case, Rueben Murphy, this does not apply. I am sure that, when you shot him twice in the chest with a 9mm semi-automatic gun, you intended to kill Patrick Boyle. In your case, Ben Doyle, you knew that Rueben Murphy was armed and that he intended to cause serious harm by the use of the gun.\n\n‌\n\n\"Whilst use of a gun in such circumstances might very well lead to death. I am not satisfied to the criminal standard that you intended that Patrick Boyle should be killed or knew that Rueben Murphy intended to kill him. In your case, therefore, I find you intended to cause serious bodily harm.\n\n\"Rueben Murphy and Ben Doyle, this was a brazen and shocking attack, leading to the senseless death of a young man. At no stage have either of you shown remorse for what you have done nor for the enduring misery that you have caused to others.\"\n\nRueben Murphy\n\n‌\n\n“You will serve a minimum of 31 years”.\n\nBen Doyle\n\n“You will serve a minimum of 27 years”.\n\n‌\n\nThomas Walker\n\n“The sentence is 2 years’ imprisonment. You will serve up to one half of your sentence in custody.”\n\nREAD NEXT\n\n‌"
