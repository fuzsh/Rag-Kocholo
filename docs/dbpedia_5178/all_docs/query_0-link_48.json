        "text": "We went under Jonathan’s arrangements to the south of Ireland on our honeymoon for a week after our Sligo-based wedding and really enjoyed our time! We were so busy planning our wedding and coordinating with close family & friends to travel that it left very little time & energy to plan our honeymoon, so we reached out to Wendy Perrin’s team as we’d been on a few other family vacations that were marvelous with them. On our solo couples trip, we experienced some wonderful places of Ireland and of working with an experienced team and some that weren’t quite as ideal.\n\nThe Poor\n\nWhen we reached out to Jonathan’s team, we provided an initial budget and were told that we needed to increase it considerably to get the full experience. Understanding that luxury pricing often leads to a luxurious experience, we discussed and did a bit of research, and ultimately decided to move forward with a refreshed budget as informed by their team. Unfortunately, when all was said and done, even the higher-end budget that was provided wasn’t inclusive of planning, touring, and accommodation costs incurred during the trip, not to mention food & extras, leading to some strain as a newly-married couple. More transparency in what is included, what isn’t, etc. would be helpful for those that may be more price conscious!\n\nOn the trip, there were very few aspects that we didn’t enjoy, but there were a few that were somewhat unfortunate, namely our first stay just post-wedding. The first hotel that we were recommended & stayed at was a very nice hotel, the G, in Galway and usually would likely be marvelous. We were given a suite facing the bay with floor-to-ceiling windows—gorgeous views. Unfortunately, the hotel had recently switched owners and the staff informed us that they’d had difficulty with the central heating & cooling for months. The days were on the warmer side for April and, to top it off, the floor-to-ceiling windows created a greenhouse effect in the room, leaving us in a 90+ degree Fahrenheit room every evening. The staff did provide a bucket of ice for us to use to cool ourselves off, but unfortunately there was little to help with the issue (aside from drawing the blinds upon entry into the room each afternoon!) and no alternative rooms available.\n\nThe Wonderful\n\nEverything else. Truly, nearly everything else was marvelous. The locations—Connemara, Galway, Killarney, Dingle, and Dublin—were all wonderful to see, the food was fabulous, the people were so nice. It’s hard to whittle down to a few things, but I’ll try to put the best of the best below!\n\nWe so enjoyed the driver, Pat, that we worked with throughout the trip. He was so knowledgeable, friendly & informative and was able to tailor each day to feedback that we provided throughout the trip. The true gems of Ireland came through Pat’s recommendations and timing. We went to a sheep farm for a private sheep dog show and, by happenstance, watched two lambs be born and then got to feed them their first bottles! Pat drove us to a perfumery in the Burren where we picked out signature scents for our honeymoon; a place we truly would’ve never known of or found without him. Pat altered a driving-heavy day after hearing that we were still wiped out post-wedding to instead send us on a serene horse & buggy ride through the mountains of Kerry, giving us some of the best views we saw the whole trip! He provided some of the most marvelous food and drink recommendations each night, sending us to fantastic pubs for live music, steakhouses, and local fish-and-chip shops. Pat seemed to know everyone and everything and truly made our time there unforgettable.\n\nOur favorite hotel that we stayed at was the Aghadoe Heights in Killarney. It was a bit outside of the town, which added a bit of travel time to the evenings, but taxis were incredibly easy to nab and the staff was generally willing to drop you off & pick up within certain times. The hotel’s views were unbeatable regardless of the time of day and the bar & restaurant there was incredible. We had a dinner there that, shockingly, may have been one of my favorites of the whole trip. I’m not usually a fan of hotel-based restaurants—sometimes they’re poorly done—but the chefs & wait staff outdid themselves. There was an asparagus soup dish that I’ll dream of having regularly from here on out and the veal was perfection.\n\nAs far as the landscape & culture, don’t miss out on the Dingle Peninsula. That was likely the most picturesque views of the whole trip and the local artisans throughout that region were really neat. We got keepsakes at a workshop where you could go back and watch hand-cut crystal be made by former Waterford craftsmen, we had a silversmith make an Ogham bracelet for me with our wedding details on it, and bought pottery from a marvelous shop inspired by the local nature. That’s not to mention the food there—local ice cream, fish brought off the boat that very morning, and more—and the rest the area had to offer including ancient dwellings, more sheep than you can count, and Star Wars filming locations.\n\nAll in all, it was a packed but absolutely marvelous honeymoon. We enjoyed ourselves to the fullest and got to see a side of Ireland we weren’t yet familiar with—and do so in style!\n\nThe hotels chosen by Jonathan’s team were outstanding for the most part. The Manor House in Castle Combe and Lainston House just outside Winchester were both exceptional, with beautiful grounds, great food and very helpful staff. We especially enjoyed sitting in the garden and taking in the view at Lainston House. Great Fosters, near Heathrow, was a beautiful place and we had a fine dinner at their Michelin-starred restaurant, The Tudor Pass. (This 7-course meal took more than 3-and-a-half hours, so be prepared for an investment of your time.) However, their breakfast buffet was a bit skimpy, our bathroom was a bit grungy, and the staff left a great deal to be desired. One girl at the front desk was very friendly and helpful, but just about everyone else acted like we were imposing upon them.\n\nJon Moorhouse was the driver-guide on our first trip with Jonathan in 2022, and my mother and I were so glad to see him again! Jon massaged our itinerary to take advantage of better weather, and, knowing our interest in churches and cathedrals, made sure we got to attend a service with music at Wells Cathedral, found a cathedral for us to visit while we explored Wales, and even took us round to visit his own parish church. (The church was a gem, by the way, but to protect it from Instagram I won’t name it.)\n\nWe began by visiting Westonbirt Arboretum and Bowood House & Gardens, where we had a lovely walk around the lake and enjoyed the “Capability” Brown landscape. We explored Wells Cathedral, where we met Basil, the Cathedral Cat. He has a bed on the ticket counter and an official identity badge. We also visited nearby Glastonbury Abbey, which we felt like we could have skipped. We took a day off from touring on a Bank Holiday and enjoyed The Manor House and the village. Castle Combe really is charming, with a lovely little country church and war memorial. I know we had to spend the holiday somewhere, but maybe it shouldn’t have been in “England’s prettiest village,” which may also be England’s smallest village and was simply overrun with selfie-takers. Ugh!\n\nWe spent two more days touring with Jon. We drove into Wales, visiting Tintern Abbey (much more interesting than Glastonbury), Raglan Castle and Brecon Cathedral. Then we visited the gardens at Stourhead House, which were simply magnificent, on our way to Salisbury Cathedral. Jon deposited us at Lainston House and it was time to say goodbye! Based at Lainston House, we explored Winchester, touring the cathedral and the historic city center, and taking the “Keats Walk” through the water meadow to the 12th-century Hospital of St Cross. (This walk was pleasant but would be simply breathtaking in the autumn.) Moving onto Great Fosters, we finished up our trip by spending a day at Hampton Court Palace, where we attended Evensong in the Chapel Royal.\n\nWe enjoyed our trip very much, especially reconnecting with the world’s (or at least England’s) greatest driver-guide. Everything went smoothly and we were confident that Jonathan’s office would step in if we experienced any difficulties. Thank you, Jonathan and Katie, for another memorable trip!\n\nScotland was absolutely fabulous. We are more than happy with our destination choice, timing, and with Jonathan’s office. The sunny weather we enjoyed was unprecedented, my sister-in-law learned how to appreciate Scotch from our driver/whisky expert/guide John McElwee, and I discovered I loved haggis and black pudding. Who knew?!\n\nHere are some bits and bobs of feedback from our merry band; my husband and myself, and my brother-in-law and his wife…\n\nAccommodations\n\nGleneagles\n\nWow. Quite possibly one of the BEST hotels in which we have ever stayed. Warm, genuine regard from the staff. A beautiful grand dame of a hotel which did not disappoint. Fabulous breakfast buffet, top-flight dining in all venues. Fun American Bar with a really chill jazzy vibe. Andrew Fairlie, the two-star Michelin restaurant, did not disappoint. Falconry was breathtaking and fabulous (as long as you did not mind watching the raptors eat formerly live chicks…). In retrospect staying here might have been better at the end of our journey, for some relaxing and elegant recharge prior to the trip home.\n\nNess Walk\n\nAgain, genuinely warm and welcoming staff. Great location and proximity to restaurants for walking, but the riverfront was all torn up with construction. Great breakfast and the dinner we had onsite was wonderful. The rooms we had were small and had minimal storage for clothes and such. It felt like a wee step down after the stunning stay at Gleneagles. Their bar was open 24/7, perhaps for those needing a wee dram in the wee small hours?! The TV oddly required two remotes and we needed to call the concierge to get it working; she noted that this was a fairly regular part of her job, as the TVs are near impossible to suss out on guests’ own! Probably our least favorite, but still a good experience.\n\nIsle of Eriska Hotel\n\nWhat a beautiful setting! Another grand dame of a hotel. Public areas are beautiful. Our room was spacious and well appointed. Would not be accessible for those with mobility problems as there are no elevators and rooms are either on second or third floors; luckily our new hips and knees were functioning fairly well! Scotland was unseasonably warm for this time of year, and there was no AC—the advice was to open windows, but there were no screens, so we got to share our lodgings with wee midges. Service was mostly gracious…but a bit inconsistent. The fairly new manager, Massimo, was warm and welcoming—especially after we told him we had met his mom at Johnstons of Elgin the day previous, who told him to call her! That night, however, our toilet stopped working, and housekeeping was not able to fix it, so the desk man on duty said it would need to wait till the morning (!). Later he called us with a new scheme—the room next to ours was being renovated, and they could give us a key to use the loo in case we needed it during the night (!). Still not optimal. At some point Massimo evidently called to see how things were going—heard about this—and came back to the hotel himself to see if this could be fixed—and when it could not even though it was now late at night, called in maintenance to fix things. Which they did. His behavior should be a model for the rest of the staff, many of whom were quite new/in training, it seemed.\n\nWe waited a day for the perk offered by Jonathan’s office, a cream tea, and when it did not appear we asked staff, who curtly remarked that we should have stepped up to get this at the beginning, and it required 24 hours advance notice (!). I suppose we could have gone to Massimo but opted to let this go. On check out he did credit our bills for a bottle of wine as an apology for any inconveniences during our stay.\n\nOverall…. Staff needs work. Some were fabulous, others did not seem to know what they were doing and perhaps did not care. Quite the disconnect from the stunning surround.\n\nKimpton Charlotte Square\n\nNicely located in the thick of things. Our room looked out at another wing of the hotel and wasn’t optimal; our companions’ room had a lovely view of a town square. Staff were quite busy, understaffed most likely, but always helpful and kind. After so many wonderful Scotch tastings we enjoyed an entertaining gin tasting with Michael in the bar. Hotel was very busy with a number of meetings/conventions, so not as relaxing as our previous accommodations, but still a good vibe.\n\nActivities\n\nFalconry at both locations was wonderful. Had a fascinating walkabout in St Andrews. Stirling Castle was an absolute highlight. Thoroughly enjoyed the distilleries. Deanston was especially wonderful as we saw all parts of the working floor. Our stop at Pitlochry, House of Bruar, was great—we just stayed in the Sale Barn and made some great buys. Dunrobin Castle was a great comparator to Stirling Castle, leaving nothing to the imagination. The Balvenie Tour was also spectacular—and it enabled us to skip the Speyside Cooperage, as Balvenie had their own cooperage operation. Johnstons of Elgin did not disappoint, nor did their retail store! Culloden Battlefield was sobering; reminded us of our own history at Gettysburg. The Edinburgh food-and-drink walking tour was lovely and informative, as was the Old Town Walking Tour the next day. For the latter, we wound up taking a taxi up top to the Castle, then walking our way down. For exploring the city, best to use the on/off bus.\n\nDining\n\nAll the Gleneagles venues were top rate. The breakfast buffet was the best we have ever experienced!\n\nThe Tom Morris Bar and Grill at St Andrews was a great place to soak in golf history and have fabulous fish and chips.\n\nIn Inverness, The Mustard Seed was a disappointment. Crowded, hot, understaffed, and poor service as a result. Overcharged us on our bill. Would not recommend.\n\nAs disappointing as The Mustard Seed was, Rocpool was exquisite! Cool vibe, great music, outstanding food and drink, welcoming owner (who knew our driver quite well).\n\nTorrish at Ness Walk was quite good.\n\nIsle of Eriska Hotel dining was first rate. Ee-usk in Oban was a bit of a disappointment—again, seemed a bit understaffed, and the seafood was so-so. Beautiful setting on the waterfront, however.\n\nBABA at the Kimpton was fabulous, though not for everyone if they did not like Eastern/Mediterranean food. We were so stuffed after our food walk we wound up cancelling Scran and Scallie and had bar food at BABA. We were quite tired after our Old City Walk in Edinburgh so cancelled Monteiths and walked across the street to Browns, recommended by our driver, which was wonderful.\n\nThe WOW Moment\n\nQuite simply…WOW!! Our whisky tasting at The Malt Room was over the top. There was a marvelous charcuterie board to get us started, and we were treated to a selection of 5 rare Scotches to sample. It was a fabulous experience and we think it was one of our trip’s highlights. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this experience. 5 stars plus.\n\nThe Driver\n\nJohn McElwee went above and beyond on this trip with us, and truly was the ingredient that made our journey so special. By the time we finished spending time together he felt like our “Da”! His knowledge of Scotch and Scottish history is encyclopedic. He is a skillful driver with a wonderfully comfortable vehicle. Everyone in Scotland seems to know, and love, John, so we were able to use his influence while gaining entry to activities, pubs, you name it! He packed all of our suitcases into his car after leaving each hotel with the ease of a Rubik’s Cube Master. He looked at our activity suggestions in the Itinerary and advised which we might skip in favor of others which might hold more and different interest. Simply stated, having John as our driver made this vacation. He was kind, gracious, funny, and the best ambassador Scotland could want.\n\nOverall Experience\n\n11!! on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nThanks again for making this trip wonderful, and memorable. We have a number of countries still on our bucket list, so you can count on us being in touch soon to plan the next adventure!\n\nFrom the initial planning stages to nearly the end of our time in Ireland everything was wonderful. Jonathan’s office not only created a thoughtful and thorough itinerary for us, they went out of their way a couple of times. The first was that we had a great preliminary conversation with Jonathan Epstein (just a few days after he’d suffered a concussion) and Katie Stewart. The last was assisting us to connect with one of our hotels who had double billed us in (unintended) error.\n\nMy initial approach was to downplay the importance of nice hotels, as we intended to spend so little time in our rooms. Thank goodness Jonathan convinced us otherwise. Each of the three hotels reserved for us were not just great places to sleep. The ambiance, breakfasts, locations, special welcomes in each room, staff — all were superb and much appreciated after a full day of exploring and learning.\n\n• Windows in our room in the Great Southern Killarney hotel opened on to an inner garden. Despite being very near the downtown area, it was dead quiet at night. Hotel staff recommended and reserved excellent restaurants during our stay. We thoroughly enjoyed an Irish whisky tasting one evening after dinner.\n\n• Mount Juliet near Kilkenny was beautiful! Our “windows” were doors opening into beautiful green spaces. It was lovely to have a delicious cake and local honey waiting for us in the room. We ate wonderful breakfasts there, enjoyed drinks at the bar, and also a delicious dinner during our stay. We don’t play golf but this is a golf lovers’ (and equestrian) paradise!\n\n• The Dylan hotel in Dublin was extraordinary! Again, superb breakfasts and drinks on the house one evening. It was within walking distance of every place we wanted to see, and a good place from which to set out on our walking tour of the city.\n\nWe had naively thought that it was possible to drive far greater distances than the itinerary we finally settled on. Again, Jonathan’s gentle guidance proved wise. We travelled from Shannon to Killarney and ventured out from there for three days, then to Kilkenny for two days, and on to Dublin for three. That, in fact, was a lot to take in and we now are eager to plan more trips to Ireland through Jonathan.\n\nWeather was the only thing that didn’t sync up with all these extraordinary arrangements.… During the beginning of April this year we experienced rainy, cold, blustery winds, and moments of sunshine. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!\n\nWe can’t think of anything to avoid, although our walking tour guide in Dublin could not hold a candle to our driver/guide the rest of the trip. I think it was because the weather was, still, cold and rainy — enough to put a damper on anyone and anything.\n\nBrendan Glynn was our driver/guide for all but Dublin. He met us at Shannon and spent five full days with us. When we parted company, I felt that we were saying goodbye to a brother. Brendan is smart, gracious, well-prepared, discreet, funny, full of stories, and has a vast store of knowledge about everything we were seeing. He’s a fabulous driver. He provided valuable and entirely reliable recommendations throughout our stay. We had the great good fortune to be able to spend down time with him, too. There were days when we spent 12 or more hours together and we did not, for a moment, tire of his company. I lost my debit card and could not make satisfactory arrangements to get cash. Brendan allowed me to transfer funds from my bank to his and, in full faith that the transfer would be executed satisfactorily, advanced me Euros. I’m afraid any other guide would have a tough time meeting our expectations after having spent time with Brendan.\n\nOn our first afternoon of touring, we met a friend in Kildare. We had a bit of private time with her after which Brendan drove us all out to Helen’s Bar at the end of the pier in Ardea, Kilmackillogue and joined us for dinner. The pub was filled with locals only: a couple of men played dice, there was a women’s knitting group at a long table, and a book club met in an adjacent room. For all the fancy meals we had in Ireland, this simple meal of mussels and the like was exquisite! The fact that Brendan agreed to join us only added to the special nature of the evening. After that, we had several pints and/or meals together!\n\nBrendan took us to Dingle Crystal, a small seemingly out-of-the-way artisan craft shop where we saw some of the most beautiful crystal designs we’ve ever seen. Despite the fact that this place seems to be on at least a few tour guides’ itineraries, we were made to feel uniquely welcome by Sean Daly, the owner, and his sons. We spent time in the glass cutting room getting a glimpse of how they ply their craft and my husband purchased two beautiful whisky tasting glasses. We are not shoppers, so this was our only purchase, other than a couple of books, the entire month we were away!\n\nDuring our time in Kilkenny, Brendan was able to arrange with the owner of Jerpoint Park to open up weeks in advance of her scheduled opening date. Maeve gave us a private, guided tour of the Lost Town of Newtown Jerpoint, a 12th century settlement that she and her husband found was on land they bought to farm and which they excavated and reclaimed, inch by inch. We learned so much about the time, the confluence of events and landscape, and the special import of that particular location. This particular visit was a highpoint of our 8 days in Ireland!\n\nThe drives and views were incredible, all day every day!\n\nBrendan recommended two restaurants in Dublin that were extraordinary: we enjoyed Matt the Thresher twice and Hugo’s. At Hugo’s we met the owner, courtesy of Brendan, and discovered that she and my husband had worked in the same Vermont ski resort area some decades ago!\n\nMy husband and I had a wonderful trip to Ireland with the help of Wendy Perrin WOW travel advisor Jonathan Epstein (specializing in the British Isles). I told Jonathan’s colleague Katie Stewart about the type of trip we wanted, and she created a 10-day itinerary reflecting all the activities we hoped for.\n\nKatie listened carefully and made adjustments so that we were sure to have time every day to walk or hike and to see spectacular scenery, as many antiquities as possible, and charming towns to visit and shop in. In addition, she worked within our budget and sent us to hotels we will never forget.\n\nWithin the first two days we knew we had been in good hands. First, Katie set us up for a half-day tour of Dublin to give a sense of the city and its history. The surprise was that our guide happened to be the owner of the guide company, Pat Liddy, who has a vast range of knowledge about Dublin, and who is extremely charming and intelligent. What a great introduction for that trip!\n\nAfter a short stay in Dublin, we set off to see some of the West Coast. The surprise that day was our driver, Dolan Stevens, who picked us up to tour with us for the next 8 days. I could never have found such a terrific man had I searched for drivers myself. Dolan became “a friend” after a few hours with him. He had humor, knowledge, kindness, and humor. He followed Katie’s schedule and even added a few towns we hadn’t heard about.\n\nWe enjoyed a day driving down the Dingle Peninsula, with stunning views of the waves crashing against the rocky cliffs and stopping to explore some ancient stone “igloo-shaped” houses that were thousands of years old. Dolan squeezed a great deal into that (and every) day for us: Stops at Muckross House, picturesque oceanside towns, and the entire peninsula fit in that first day. We were so glad to have a driver on the narrow roads along the ocean as well as the countryside. Never did we take a wrong turn or even have to read a map.\n\nAmong the stops we liked so much were the hours we could walk/hike in gorgeous areas. Our driver knew exactly where to park and which hikes were suited to our abilities. We enjoyed the visitors’ path on the edges of the Cliffs of Moher, where the ocean’s frothy waves crashed against the brownish cliffs. And on a second day out, we took a beautiful path across rolling green hills of Connemara National Park.\n\nBesides the natural beauty, we loved our accommodations. One favorite was the Ballynahinch Castle (actually a glorious country house) with its many sitting rooms, crackling fireplaces, friendly staff, and exquisite suite overlooking a fast-moving stream. If we’d had more days there, we would have spent hours walking the many paths of the extensive grounds. Our last hotel was one we’d never heard of: The K Club. It’s a world-wide known golf hotel in an enormous enlarged country house with acres of greenery and paths around the courses. We were booked there because it’s only an hour to the airport, but it was the most elaborate hotel we stayed at! We discovered original oil paintings on the walls. Originals, including a large Botero! and some Modigliani! I’m certain that we wouldn’t have had such pleasing rooms everywhere if it hadn’t been for the relationship between our agent and each hotel.\n\nI can’t leave out the marvelous sheepdog training exhibition we were lucky enough to see. Katie was so enthusiastic about this stop that we agreed to include it. And was she ever right! No one would believe that little, young dogs could tell a group of sheep exactly where to sit or run, but we saw it, standing a mere 20 feet away with the trainer using either voice commands or a whistle. It’s a NEVER forget experience.\n\nThis was the fourth trip we planned with Wendy Perrin. I’m so convinced that the WOW agents have made them each exceptional. In Vietnam, Sicily, the area of Florence in Italy, and in Ireland, our travels were easy and enormously fulfilling. I influenced my daughter-in-law to use one of her agents for Panama, and she, too, was extremely grateful. At this point, I wouldn’t plan a trip abroad without finding a WOW agent so that I could relax and know I’d have the best of everything.\n\nJonathan and his team are expert at both designating superior lodging and choosing guides, but also keeping track of staff/ownership fluctuations that might shift the character of a guest’s experience. We are well traveled but a couple of the hotels recommended by his office were among the finest that we’ve ever enjoyed. Also, at our request, the team was able to arrange a tour of a specialized facility that generally doesn’t offer tours.\n\nAnother significant aspect of Jonathan and his team is that they are hyper-responsive to the issues/concerns that inevitably arise:\n\n— I think, without exception, that our many queries over the months were responded to within hours, and there was never any question as to whether the response was correct or that it had been rushed/poorly-thought-out,\n\n— It was obvious that our guides were chosen because of expertise in our areas of interest, and they seemed very aware of our passions and hobbies, sometimes in minute detail.\n\n— I have no doubt that if we had had a significant lodging concern during our trip that wasn’t being addressed by the local vendor, Jonathan’s staff would have intervened immediately on our behalf.\n\nJonathan and his office generated and constantly revised a meticulous and well-organized virtual itinerary — including pictures and descriptions — that worked nicely in the related phone app that we used daily during our trip.\n\nI’d note that while Jonathan’s office makes dining recommendations, reservations were left to us, as were flight and auto rental arrangements/reservations. Because we’ve planned way-too-many trips ourselves, this was no problem for us.\n\nOverall, we were delighted with both Jonathan and the whole staff, who organized one of the best trips of our lives.\n\nIn terms of Scotland itself, I’d say that the Scottish people are generally delightful: We found the Glaswegians (folks from Glasgow) especially talkative and spontaneously helpful. Although we ate well throughout Scotland, I’d single out two excellent restaurants in Glasgow: Cail Bruich; and The Gannet.\n\nI’ve been wanting for decades to visit the holy sites of Iona (Scotland) and Lindisfarne (England). We had the opportunity to visit Lindisfarne this time and would note that, other than getting some exercise with a hearty walk, visiting Lindisfarne Castle was a disappointment. However, we found Lindisfarne Priory haunting and inspirational.\n\nThe island of Islay is great for everyone loving peaty scotch whisky. The warehouse tasting at Bruichladdich was worthwhile, fun and educational.\n\nA final note: We’ve driven through much of western Europe — Italy, Ireland, France, England, et al — with both manual and automatic cars. Most everyone knows the usual driving challenges: Drivers ignore rules in Italy, and there are motorbikes buzzing around your car like mosquitoes; there are narrow, almost one-lane roads with hedgerows in Ireland; etc. But in country areas of Scotland and northern England, there are narrow country roads with hedgerows…and frequent massive “lorries” hurtling around corners at 50 miles per hour. It can be unnerving: Several times I was amazed that neither we nor others lost side mirrors.\n\nSome of “our kids” (spouses of our kids) had never been on a “Family Trip” before and they were astounded at the level of detail and quality of EVERYTHING, as were our own children. There were ten of us ranging in age from early 40’s to mid 70’s and we could not have had a better time together! The hotels were 5-stars, above and beyond, our driver guide Martin, who picked us up on our first day and stayed with us for 6 days total, was phenomenal; he was a treasure trove of historical information wherever we drove, he was the epitome of a gentleman, taking care of all of us and our varied needs constantly, checking on arrangements for future outings, and more. There were very real tears shed when we said good-bye to this man as he dropped us at our final hotel in Dublin, at the end of our trip.\n\nKatie and Jonathan suggested a variety of activities that made everyone happy, including a falconry walk at our first hotel (Dromoland—a 16th-century castle that truly set the tone for what a spectacular trip this was going to be…). We learned so much from Liam about the role falconry has played throughout history and throughout our language—all fascinating! Our outing to the Cliffs of Moher was truly breathtaking…and enroute the countryside alone was worth the trip. A trip to Caherconnell Farm provided us with an incredible sheepdog demonstration, followed by our getting to know the pups up close and personal, followed by artisanal cheeses and hot toddys served in a charming back room of the farm shop. The staff at Dromoland were all amazing and the foods and drinks we had there were simply the best! Weather was beautiful for us our first few days but the day that our daughter and sons were set to play Dooks, one of the oldest golf courses in Ireland, winds kicked up and rain pelted down, yet they played anyway and said they would do it all again for the experience of playing that course!\n\nWe sadly left Dromoland after 2 nights and went to Killarney for 3 nights, where we completely enjoyed all of the amenities offered at The Europe, our hotel there. Every one of us utilized the fitness center, spa treatments, pools, hot tubs, steam rooms, all while enjoying the most gorgeous views from our rooms overlooking Lough Leanne. The hotel staff was SO SO helpful and accommodating…. Padraig arranged a birthday dinner at a local restaurant for us one evening, and it was one of the best meals we had during our stay, at a lovely little restaurant owned by the same family since the ‘50’s, and they even prepared a special birthday dessert for our daughter. Across the street from our dinner we found a small authentic pub where we enjoyed lively Irish music afterwards. Killarney was a lovely little town and we spent time exploring there in between hiking nearly 7 miles through some of the most diverse, rugged and beautiful landscape I’ve personally seen. It was such a thrill to be able to do this with my kids!!! On our last night there, I asked for help in getting some drinks and appetizers brought to our suite so we could have a small cocktail party for all of the family. Padraig once again rose to the occasion, brought huge candle-filled lanterns to our room “to create more ambience” (as if the beautiful view wasn’t enough!) and we had the most lovely little “party” with our kids on our last night there.\n\nNext morning on our way to Dublin, Martin took us to the Rock of Cashel where we stepped back hundreds of years in time to explore that historic site, and also had a delightful lunch in a locally owned place where Mary, the owner, made us feel like their most important customers of the day! On to Dublin for our last 3 nights and the Shelbourne Hotel did not disappoint either…incredible staff, a sumptuous high tea service, delicious foods and drink, and within walking distance to some very cool parts of the city. Pat Liddy was an exceptional guide for our half-day walking tour there; he was so interesting we stopped for coffee together so we could hear more about all he was showing us! Seeing The Book of Kells, and the “Long Room” (the massive library at Trinity College) nearly had us in tears; the books are shelved floor-to-ceiling and it was a sight never to be repeated, at least not in my mind. Our final evening here, Nikita helped me arrange a special dinner in a private room for our family, next to a smaller room alongside where an Irish duo came to entertain us before dinner. The Irish pipes and the violinist were incredible—we were clapping, laughing, singing, playing flutes along with the duo, and ended up dancing before they were done! The dinner was exquisite, with a gorgeous linen-laid table, crystal, and servers timing the “reveal” of each dish just perfectly. We felt like royalty. What a way to end our time together!!\n\nNone of us will EVER forget this trip and it only solidifies my thinking that when it comes to trip planning, Wendy’s WOW List of agents is the ONLY way to go. Even the simplest things, like having airport transportation already set up, is worth any extra cost. Knowing you are with a knowledgeable guide and that your group is NOT part of a busload of 50 or more people, is worth any extra cost! (Our vehicle, by the way, for the ten of us, was incredibly comfortable and luxurious—a Mercedes “van” that was all windows and comfortable seating for our group!) This was our fourth trip using Wendy’s resources and it will NOT be our last. Kudos to Jonathan, Katie, Norma and all the staff who made this an unforgettable family trip. The connections and reconnections that were made in our little group of ten were priceless.\n\nMy wife and I traveled with our 3 adult children to Northern Ireland and Ireland July 1-12, 2023. Jonathan and his team planned and executed our entire trip for us from beginning to end. The logistics of the trip were essentially flawless. The itinerary was a combination of the typical tourist agenda with some unique and more personalized experiences thrown in, and most importantly, a cadre of guides whose authenticity was only exceeded by their graciousness.\n\nWe were delighted that Jonathan got on the phone with us for our first meeting, which he assured us is only a certainty with clients referred through Wendy. Indeed, when this came up in conversation during our trip, one of the experienced guides remarked that it was distinctly unusual to speak directly with him! It was Jonathan’s strong suggestion that we include Northern Ireland in our itinerary instead of just Ireland, and we are glad that we did. Our experience in N. Ireland was the soul of our trip, and we could never have understood the country without that experience and the help of our guide for 3 days while there, Mark Murphy. His authenticity was palpable, in addition to being a consummate professional. For example, he not only took us through a small Catholic village to watch children learning the Irish sport of hurling on a field surrounded by Irish national flags, but then took out his equipment so we could all give the game a try on an adjacent field. Every experience with Mark was like that, including his lessons on tasting Irish Whiskey at Bushmills and getting me the opportunity to hold the great N. Irish golfer Rory McIlroy’s PGA championship trophy at his home golf club in Belfast! We also spent a morning at Tracey’s Farmhouse Kitchen, making (and eating) delicious soda bread along with other delectables. Like all the folks we encountered, Tracey was an absolute delight, and we loved getting to go out to the countryside and spend some quality time with people who were so happy to share their lives with us.\n\nWe then went on to spend 3 days in Dublin, staying at a classic property called The Shelbourne. This gorgeous masterpiece offered impeccable service and a perfect location. One of the benefits of working through Jonathan’s office are some small perks offered to you at each of the hotels, and we enjoyed oysters and Guinness in the beautiful lobby bar at the Shelbourne one early evening before heading to dinner. We had less time than we thought in Dublin, and probably only did about half of what we intended, but we really enjoyed the city.\n\nGalway was our next stop, and we used that as the base for our exploration of the Connemara National Park and the Cliffs of Moher. Once again, our guide for 3 days, Anne Marie Lally, was lovely and extremely accommodating. She made sure we found the shopping that we needed, and the restaurants that would satisfy us. Another absolute highlight of the trip is the Killary Sheepfarm. It’s on an absolutely beautiful fjord, and it’s fascinating to watch the sheepdogs in action and to participate in shearing the wool off the sheep. Tom, a 3rd generation proprietor, is eager to share his place, and it helps keep the lights on for these family businesses.\n\nOur last stop was Dromoland Castle. At this point we had been on the move constantly for 10 days, and I think it was brilliant planning to let us decompress at this gorgeous castle for a few days before returning home. They do make you feel special there, although it is an expensive treat during the peak season.\n\nAs you can see, we left the planning and logistics entirely up to Jonathan, Katie and their team. We are glad we did, and I don’t think we would have changed a thing. As Wendy has written about before, the real difference maker is the quality of the guides and their gracious attitude and terrific knowledge and pride in their homeland. Perhaps the only thing I would do differently is giving a bit more guidance on special or unusually good restaurants or places to eat. We were told to rely on the concierge at the respective hotels, and they were fine for the most part, but it was a mixed bag. We did get shut out of one place since we made no reservations ahead of time, and another restaurant we tried was fairly pedestrian. Restaurants change from time to time, and it’s hard to predict individual tastes, but perhaps a few “classics” should be suggested in each area that capture something unique about that particular place.\n\nIt’s always hard to decide on the “value” of any trip. From our perspective, having Jonathan and his team create our trip for us was “invaluable”! Most of the cost was not the guides and extra experiences, which really made the whole trip! It was more the hotels, airfare, etc in peak season and there is only so much you can do about that. We chose not to, but I’m sure you can be guided to less expensive hotels and shoulder-season prices to make an experience more affordable. We rarely travel anymore without using Wendy’s WOW List planners, because you really do get spoiled. Thanks again to Wendy and Jonathan!\n\nIn 2019, when we promised our daughter a trip to Great Britain as a 40th birthday gift, we expected to give that gift in 2020. Our daughter is an avid devotee of Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and many facets of British life. She is also a passionate, amateur photographer and author of fan fiction, with an abiding desire to be accurate in her writing. She felt that she had reached a plateau in her research of British times and places, and could refine her work if she could experience the sights, smells, sounds, flavors and textures of the places where her stories take place.\n\nThe pandemic postponed our trip until 2023 and during that interval we were able to refine our list of goals and fortuitously become aware of Wendy Perrin’s team and The WOW List. Wendy’s team put us in contact with Jonathan’s team. What a blessing!\n\nUnfortunately, the delay also tempted us to compile a list of desired experiences that far exceeded the time and resources we had available for the trip. Jonathan was wonderful, and gentle, in helping us refine and organize our list to maximize the success of our journey.\n\nWhat we wanted most of all was a sensory experience of Great Britain, bringing to life a broad sampling of the different historical, regional and hierarchical offerings of the island. Our wish list included castles, abbeys, manor houses, local foods and gardens. We wanted to visit the big cities, small villages and rural farmlands. We wanted to minimize the barriers between us, as visitors, and the people of England and Scotland.\n\nBy the time we had honed our wish list, Jonathan’s team had a real sense of who we were and what we wanted. We divided our time around four major centers: London and surroundings; Bath and the Cotswolds; York and northeastern England; and Edinburgh and rural Scotland. In each of these locations we had one or more walking or driver guides, who was a resident in the selected area and extremely well versed in the many facets of the location. Our guides, Angus, Adge, Howard, Val, and Davaidh, were surprisingly well informed about who we were, our itinerary and what we were hoping to experience.\n\nMany of our desires were predictable (to name a few): Hyde Park, Kensington Palace and Gardens, Green Park, Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Parliament, Highclere Castle, Bampton, Castle Combe, Broadway, York Minster, the Shambles and the Jorvik center, the Cotswolds and Moors, Salisbury, Magna Carta, Alnwick Castle, Bamburgh Castle, Stirling Castle, Inverary Castle, and, of course, fish and chips and other local cuisine.\n\nOther “must haves” were less predictable: Camden Market, Abney Park Cemetery, Avebury Henge, Haggis, All Butter Eccles Cakes, the Alnwick Castle Poison Garden, a coin shop, and the Costco in Stevenage. In every case, our guides were able to help us satisfy our desires.\n\nBeyond that, the guides were able to suggest modifications to our schedule, suggesting experiences we had not thought of, adjusting our schedule to be more efficient or carving out time for desires we had given up on. Several of our favorite stops had not been on our list of desires, such as the Two Chairmen Pub, Castle Howard, Writer’s Museum in Old Town Edinburgh, up close and personal with Highland Coos, Eilean Donan Castle, Dalmally-Lochawe, Whitby-Goathland train station, a Tartan factory and Inverary Jail.\n\nOur history lessons were of the usual kinds: names; dates; and events. Our visceral learnings were all through our senses: the incredible accommodations that provided us a glimpse into a life of luxury and privilege — Roseate Hotel in London, The Manor House at Castle Combe, The Grand in York, Intercontinental The George in Edinburgh, Inverlochy Castle and Cromlix; the peaceful and rich openness of the moors; the smell of salt air, sound of waves, beauty of dunes and beaches of the North Sea; the sights and sounds of Morris Men in Bampton; the timeless cry of bagpipes near the ancient walls of Edinburgh Castle; calm, clear waters of the many Lochs reflecting sky and mountains; and the feel of cobbles underfoot in the early-morning and late-at-night walks.\n\nPerhaps the greatest parts of our trip were the personal reflections of our guides. Each in his or her own way expressed a deep love of their land, their nation and their people. The social hierarchy was expressed in ways that reflected a candid acceptance and pride of their system. The history was related in ways that honored and respected each culture’s contribution to the current nation. Their gift of many stories was priceless. Special thanks to Jordi, the Concierge at The Grand in York, who went above and beyond to help make our time in York relaxing and memorable.\n\nOne guide assured us that the “Seashell of Lisson Grove” had the best fish and chips in London. Another assured us that the “Oyster House” in Scotland had the best fish and chips in Britain. We tried both. However, we cannot agree with either, only because we haven’t tested the fish in every other restaurant. What we can agree on is that they were both so wonderful that we would love to return and test the fish in every place, so that we can know for certain.\n\nHaving used Wendy Perrin’s WOW List last year to travel to Greece, we chose Jonathan Epstein to book our trip to Ireland and his team made the entire process extremely easy and valued our input every step of the way. This was a mother and adult daughter trip that was supposed to happen 3 years ago. My daughter was studying abroad in Ireland and my trip to visit was cancelled and she had to come home due to Covid-19. She never travelled around Ireland because she was waiting on me to get there. She has since graduated, but we still wanted to see Ireland, so booked the trip on a whim one night while talking! I had planned this trip once before on my own and really didn’t want to do that again, so I looked at Wendy’s list and contacted Jonathan. I had a lot of specifics I wanted to do and see and even some specific places I wanted to stay. Jonathon and his team (Katie and Katie) were more than willing to plan the trip — they were incredibly accommodating and included everything we wanted and more.\n\nWe started our trip by flying into Dublin and then heading straight toward the west coast to stay in the historic Dromoland Castle in County Clare. Upon arrival in Dublin, we had a driver and tour guide, Donal, waiting for us and he would be with us for the duration of our trip. Donal was absolutely fantastic, and we cannot rave about him enough. He was extremely nice, accommodating and very knowledgeable about the history of Ireland and about each area and town we visited. He gave us great recommendations and was very flexible with our schedule and adapted it to the weather.\n\nSpeaking of weather, the weather on our first day in Ireland was less than desirable. Originally, we had a falconry lesson scheduled when we arrived at the castle. Unfortunately, due to weather we had to cancel and had afternoon tea instead. The tea was really lovely and I’m glad we got to experience it. The staff at Dromoland was wonderful and worked to rebook the falconry lesson around our schedule two days later, and it was a fascinating experience. The falconry guide, Dave, was very knowledgeable both about the magnificent animals we were interacting with and the grounds of the castle. Dromoland Castle was an extraordinary experience all around!\n\nWhile staying at Dromoland Castle, we took day trips to go explore the west coast of Ireland. Our first full day was spent in Galway doing a food tour through the city and experiencing the best food the city had to offer. Our guide Regina was great. She was a chef herself and you could tell she thoroughly enjoyed sharing the amazing food that Ireland, and Galway specifically, had to offer. During this tour, we had the best raspberry croissant with red striping and a delicious raspberry puree center. We also had a whiskey tasting where we tried Irish Poitin, which is Ireland’s version of American Moonshine, and it definitely made you cough on the smallest sip. The other highlight for me of the food tour was at lunch when we had local oysters. I am not usually a fan of oysters, but Regina described them as a little burst of fresh saltwater, and that’s exactly what it was!\n\nOur next day was spent sightseeing. We went to the Cliffs of Moher, Burren National Park, and went to a sheepdog demonstration at Caherconnell Sheepdogs. The weather this day was stormy, so Donal had us skip the cliffs in the morning and circle back to them in the afternoon in hopes of better weather. This ended up being a great decision and I’m glad Donal was looking out for us. We ended up having the clearest blue sky and were able to see the cliffs perfectly and it was definitely a top highlight of our trip. The Burren National Park was also very cool to see; with the dreary weather it was giving futuristic doomsday vibes. In the Burren, there is a perfumery that uses the wildflowers in the park to make perfumes. Both my daughter and I found one that we like and treated ourselves to a new scent. The sheepdog demonstration was interesting; I was not really sure what to expect going into it but it was really fascinating and we saw two lambs being born, which was beautiful.\n\nOn our third day, we checked out of Dromoland Castle and headed over to Limerick City to stop and visit King John’s Castle and the Hunt Museum. We then continued on to Killarney, and checked into the Killarney Park Hotel. This hotel was so beautiful, and our room was perfect. That evening we had a very interesting whiskey tutorial and tasting with the head of spirits at the hotel. The next day was spent driving the Dingle Peninsula and exploring Dingle. Here, we went to Louis Mulcahy’s pottery shop and local art galleries. We also had to get some more Murphy’s ice cream. Thursday was spent exploring part of the Ring of Kerry. We started with visiting Muckross House and Gardens and each got a scarf from the Muckross weavers. I got to watch as mine was getting finishing touches from the weavers and is one of the coolest souvenirs I’ve gotten during all my travels. We also explored the town of Kenmare and took a chocolate-making class at Lorge Chocolates. Neither of us had ever done a chocolate-making class or anything of the sort before, and it was very fun and educational. Benoit Lorge ran the private lesson with the 2 of us and he was so enthusiastic and passionate about his chocolate and the quality of chocolate that he creates.\n\nFriday was Saint Patrick’s Day and we left Killarney and headed to Dublin. This was also our last day with Donal, and we were sad to part with him. He truly was one of the best things about our trip. We stayed at The Shelbourne while in Dublin, and it was gorgeous. While we were in Dublin, there was also a big rugby match between Ireland and England and the Irish Rugby players were staying at The Shelbourne as well. It was quite fun to be in the middle of everything going on! For Saint Patrick’s Day, we walked over to see a bit of the parade and then went and had a pint and a bite to eat at a pub close to our hotel.\n\nOn our last day, we did a walking tour of Dublin in the morning and got a history lesson on St Stephen’s Green, Georgian Dublin, Dublin Art Museum and the Book of Kells at Trinity College. Our tour guide, Kate, was very personable and entertaining. She did not have us down to go to the Book of Kells, but found out that we were supposed to based on what we were told, so she worked with her boss to make sure we were able to go that afternoon. That evening we took a private cooking class with Alix Gardner’s Cookery School and there we learned how to make all the essentials for a true Irish feast. We made scones, soda bread, shepherd’s pie with lamb, and a Guinness cake. My daughter and I both cook a lot and consider ourselves to be decent cooks, but I think we both learned new techniques that we’ve applied to our cooking since. The food was delicious and we got to take home our leftovers. We managed to bring a whole Guinness cake on the plane home with us to the States! A slice of Guinness cake after a full day of traveling was well worth the trouble of packing it.\n\nOverall, our trip was absolutely fantastic and we both had such a good time. All the activities we did were great and the food was amazing. Ireland will always hold a special place in our hearts.\n\nWe were lucky enough to travel to Ireland from May 1-9, 2023. Our trip planner, Katie Stewart, helped us to plan an extraordinary trip. Because we had limited time (7 days, excluding travel to and from) she took the time with us prior to our trip to make sure we got the most out of our time. She suggested we fly into Shannon and out of Dublin so that we didn’t waste time doubling back to airports. She asked us about our goals and then provided us with options to finalize our itinerary.\n\nWe started off at Dromoland Castle, and that was an experience we will never forget. Not just because of the attentive and impeccable service, but also because of the grounds, the time we spent with a Falconer on the estate and the live music in the bar area at night.\n\nWe hired a personal driver/guide and this was the absolute BEST THING WE COULD HAVE DONE. This took all of the stress out of having to rent a car, navigate directions and drive on the opposite side of the street. We were able to relax, take in the sights and enjoy our time while Peter, our driver/guide, took us to our destinations in a luxurious executive stretch BMW. This was all set up by Katie Stewart.\n\nPeter, our guide from Pro Bus, is now considered family. He was respectful, fun and informative. We highly recommend talking to Katie about hiring a driver/guide.\n\nIn Dublin, Katie set up a 3+ hour tour with an historian and professional tour guide. This was lots of fun and informative. If you want to see something specific that may require reservations and/or timed entrance — make sure to let Katie know so you can get those tickets ahead of time to avoid lines and also to ensure you are able to get in.\n\nWe did visit the Guinness Storehouse and although we weren’t sad that we went, it was not what we expected. We are from Bourbon Country and are used to guided Bourbon distillery tours and thought this would be similar. It isn’t a guided tour that shows the production facilities or brewing process. It is more of a self-guided museum. with placards and a tasting room. They push a lot of people through on a daily basis and it is crowded and somewhat commercialized. Unless you feel like your trip wouldn’t be complete without a visit to Guinness, there are many other places you could spend a few hours in Dublin.\n\nWhile in Dublin, we stayed at the Shelbourne and it was lovely. Attentive service, beautiful rooms and great location. While in Killarney, we stayed at The Killarney Park hotel. It is a locally-owned hotel and the staff were some of the best we have ever had the pleasure of meeting. It is also centrally located and we were able to walk to and from bars/restaurants very easily. Our desire to walk to places and interact with local people was all discussed ahead of time with Katie and she made suggestions for hotels based on these talks.\n\nWe highly recommend Katie and will use her for future trips.\n\nWe used Jonathan Epstein’s office for a trip to Ireland June 8-20, 2022. His travel planner Katie Stewart was our go-to contact. Our group consisted of two couples. We are old friends and travel together often. Jonathan and Katie met with us on Zoom and listened to our wants and ideas for our trip. They then came up with an itinerary that checked all of our boxes. They had great recommendations and steered us away from a few things that they thought we would not enjoy.\n\nWe flew into Shannon and spent our first three nights at Gregans Castle in the Burren near Ballyvaughn. The hotel was wonderful. The cozy bar and the restaurant were exceptional. We met our driver/guide there and started a great adventure. Our guide Brendan was absolutely perfect for us. He had great insight into what we would enjoy and could turn on a dime if something was not working. We asked him a million questions which were answered graciously and had great discussions with him on Irish politics and customs. We went to Galway for a day and moved on to Killarney for three more nights at Cahernane House. The men played a round of golf there and Brendan wrangled reservations for us at several popular local restaurants. We never had a bad meal. Murphy’s Bar was a favorite. We drove to Dingle and around the peninsula. Ireland is an enchanting place.\n\nWe left Killarney for Cashel and the Cashel Palace. On the way we stopped in Middleton for a tour of the Jamison Distillery. This was informative and very enjoyable. Our room at the Cashel Palace had a wonderful view of the Rock of Cashel and we had a delicious and very fun dinner at Mikey Ryan’s Bar and Kitchen. The Rock of Cashel is part of the grim history of the English exploitation of Ireland and is a beautiful monument to the Irish people.\n\nWe left Cashel for Dublin and Brendan deposited us at the Conrad Dublin. We were sad to say goodbye to our new friend. The best decision we made for this trip was to have a driver/guide. The driving would have proved challenging and even dangerous for us to undertake on our own. We gleaned so much more enjoyment from the trip by being able to look at the scenery instead of worrying about where we were going. We learned a tremendous amount about the people and history of this beautiful country and had a blast doing so.\n\nMany thanks to Jonathan’s team for making all of this possible.\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL We are just back from Ireland and are thrilled to recommend Jonathan Epstein as a travel planner. Our family of 4 (including 2 college-age sons) spent 8 days in Ireland and worked with Jonathan and Katie Stewart in planning a trip that our family will always remember. From our first telephone call, I felt like a valued client, and they took my ideas of the way we wanted to travel and the top things we wanted to see, then designed an itinerary that was better than I could have ever planned.\n\nOne of the first recommendations that Jonathan made was to use a driver rather than to drive ourselves. Although I was nervous about spending days with someone we didn’t know, we all heartily agree that it was one of the best things we did. Not only did our drivers, Gerry and Seamus, know details and have suggestions we would never have known, but spending time with someone who loves and knows Ireland added an unexpected dimension to our trip. Seamus always knew places to stop for lunch, unexpected detours with the most amazing views, a perfect spot for coffee or for shopping, and the best local pubs with music that our boys would love. When we told him about one son’s interest in prehistoric and Celtic history, he took us to several out-of-the-way stops and tiny towns where we saw stone circles and ruins, and also had fun pub lunches away from crowds of tourists. Our boys learned all about hurling from Seamus and we talked about and watched matches on the trip.\n\nWe made a large circle around the Republic of Ireland, starting and ending in Dublin. We saw Cashel and the historic Rock of Cashel, Cork, Cobh, the Ring of Kerry, the Dingle Peninsula, the Burren region, Galway, and Dublin. Jonathan suggested the behind-the-scenes tour at the Jameson distillery, which was excellent, and a food tour in Galway which was one of the highlights of the trip. We explored towns and countryside, hiked through the Burren area, saw historical Irish sites and ruins, and explored the city highlights of Dublin. He managed to weave it all together in a way where we felt like we saw an incredible view of the country without being rushed.\n\nThe hotels where we stayed were wonderful, with beautiful rooms and grounds and exceptional service. The Cashel Palace and Greghans Castle were places where we wished we could stay for a month, and the kind of places where we got to know staff and felt like welcome family rather than just customers. All of the hotels and venues knew Jonathan and his company. Having Jonathan and Katie plan this trip was worth every penny. We were able to relax and enjoy the scenery without worrying about every detail or running over sheep on windy Irish country roads! It truly makes a difference to work with a professional. I can’t recommend them more highly, and this trip will be a part of our family’s memories always!\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL We had wonderful time on our family trip through Ireland with the knowledgable guidance of Jonathan and his staff. Our initial planning was spot-on with terrific advice and insight on everything from hotel choices to efficient and enjoyable sequencing of our many selected destinations to the pros and cons of spending more for extras. Jonathan was quick to understand our special requests as we returned to Ireland for the first time in 25 years, bringing our teenaged daughters to see so much that we remember fondly. He seamlessly wove together an itinerary to include both the common (Ring of Kerry, Dublin museums) and the somewhat less travelled (Cahir Castle, Rotunda Hospital) and wisely counseled us to arrange for a private driver.\n\nThis expertise was even more appreciated when we had to reschedule our trip from June 2020 to June 2021 and then again to June 2022. Jonathan and his team did all the leg work to rebook our rooms, guides, and driver—and even secured additional perks and discounts along the way.\n\nSome highlights of our trip that circled Dublin – Cong – Killarney – Laois (Ballyfin) – Dublin: We had gorgeous rooms, amazing service, and real value-added perks at the hotels where we stayed. The staff often mentioned Jonathan’s company, and it was clear that Jonathan had a connection with them. The suggested tours and activities were exactly as described—and sometimes even more appreciated by our teenagers than we had expected. The food tour in Galway and the sheepdog/lamb experience were real highlights that we would not have pursued without Jonathan’s urging. Our driver Pat was jovial, punctual, kind and flexible—as well as completely at ease driving in any number of crazy or frustrating settings. We were so grateful not to have had to drive—or even to have had to select a driver!\n\nOur only disappointment is that we were due to have a WOW Moment on this trip—this was confirmed when we rescheduled the dates from 2021 to 2022… but somehow Jonathan and his team forgot about it. A key staff member left during that time and I suspect the ball was dropped during her transition. We got a sincere apology, but we definitely felt a bit shortchanged.\n\nThat one omission notwithstanding, we would definitely work with Jonathan again if we were to return to Ireland. His assistance made our trip easier, more fun, and a better value for us.\n\nResponse from Wendy:\n\nI am dismayed that Jilda’s WOW Moment was missed—a highly unusual circumstance thanks to a Covid-related snafu—and we will certainly more than make it up to her on her next trip! As a reminder to all travelers, here’s how our WOW Moments project works, and here are the rules for redeeming your WOW Moments gift certificate. While every WOW Moment is a surprise, if your final trip itinerary does not include mention that this surprise will occur and when, by all means let us know immediately at info@wendyperrin.com.\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL My mother and I returned last week from 10 days in the Cotswolds (June 5-14). Our trip was planned by Jonathan. This was our first time to use a trip planner and we weren’t sure what to expect. Jonathan and his team made everything go smoothly, from our airport transfers to dinner reservations, and we had exactly the trip we had envisioned.\n\nDuring our initial consultation, we discussed what my mom and I wanted from the trip and listed our must-see sights. Jonathan then designed a trip where we based out of three beautiful villages (from small and remote Painswick and Lower Slaughter to bigger and more bustling Chipping Campden) and worked our way from south to north, ticking items off our sightseeing list along the way: Tewkesbury Abbey, attending Evensong service at Gloucester Cathedral, Sudeley Castle & Gardens, Kelmscott Manor, St Mary’s Church in Fairford, Hidcote Manor Gardens, Kiftsgate Court Gardens, and Blenheim Palace. One of the gardens we wanted to visit wasn’t running their normal tours because the head gardener was out on medical leave. At no cost to us, Jonathan was able to arrange a short private tour with the general manager of the property, after which we were left to enjoy a pot of tea in the magnificent garden.\n\nAll of our accommodations were outstanding (in fact one of them, The Painswick, couldn’t have been more perfect if we’d designed it ourselves), with superb locations, amenities and food. For our last night before flying home, we were booked at The Runnymede on Thames. Though only 10 minutes from Heathrow, it’s right on the river. After a long day of sightseeing and then driving back to London, we were able to spend one final glorious summer evening enjoying gin & tonics outside by the river.\n\nJon, our driver/guide, was a simply a gem. He was prompt, professional, knowledgeable and lots of fun! Ahead of our visits, he provided us with printed materials about our chosen sights so we could familiarize ourselves and make sure we didn’t miss anything that would be of interest to us. He booked lunches for us at wonderful local pubs so we didn’t waste valuable time looking for a place to eat or standing in queues. He chose beautiful scenic routes and stopped in several villages along the way so we could have a short ramble, and he gave us good advice on our plans for the days we were on our own. After a visit to Blenheim Palace on our final day, he drove us away from the tourist crowds to the little village churchyard where Winston Churchill is buried. This was the perfect way to end our trip!\n\nJonathan and his team allowed us to really relax and enjoy ourselves, making our “dream trip” a reality.\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL Having lost a sibling earlier in 2021, my husband and I reached out to Jonathan Epstein in October to see about organizing a trip to Ireland for the remaining siblings and in-laws some time in 2022. Jonathan didn’t even flinch when we mentioned the group totaled 18, 3 of whom have mobility issues. Jonathan and Katie Stewart went right to work helping us think through best time of year to travel with a group that large and destinations to reasonably cover in a two week period. Then came the hard part. All accommodations, restaurants, sight seeing venues and transportation had to be largely wheelchair accessible — not an easy feat in historical venues — and had to meet local Covid requirements and capacity limits in effect earlier this year when most of the bookings were finalized. Jonathan, Katie and the team did an absolutely spectacular job for our family! The accommodations were all 5 star (Adare Manor is beyond 5 stars and not to be missed! and The Europe is so special right on the Lake), meals were a delightful mix of everything from pubs to gorgeous private rooms, the itinerary perfectly captured the scenic beauty of Ireland and the history and vibrancy of Dublin, and the private transportation was amazing. We were met at the airport by our incredible guide Brendan and chief driver Martin and instantly knew we were in great hands. They became part of the family, along with relief driver Patsy, and taught us so much about their beautiful country while appreciating the banter on the bus and often participating in it. For most of the group, this was their first time abroad and to say this was a trip of a lifetime is an understatement! Every detail was thought through by Jonathan, Katie and the team. They strongly recommended and booked an early private tour of the Book of Kells, they organized a private tour of the Kilmainham Gaol, helped us work with The Epic Museum for some research into ancestry (not an easy task for a family named Kelly) and presentation to our group, they organized a private music experience for our group that was one of the highlights of our trip, shared knowledge of exceptional crafts people for those interested in bringing back crystal and jewelry, organized an informative and memorable Falconry experience for the group and arranged for a private whiskey tasting at an up and coming distillery. With a group this large, there were of course some challenges to overcome. When a personal wheelchair proved too difficult to travel with, Brendan miraculously produced a scooter we were able to utilize and travel with for the length of our stay — I still don’t know how he sourced this but without it, that couple would have missed so much! At each stop, Martin and Brendan set up and repacked 2 wheelchairs, a scooter and an additional mobility device. We didn’t travel light but these gentlemen never made any of us feel like a burden and did whatever they could to make sure wherever we stopped could be enjoyed by all of us. Jonathan, Katie and the team were very helpful when some of the group experienced Covid (no one was seriously ill) and we will always be grateful for their assistance. (Covid restrictions of all kinds were eliminated just prior to our arrival and Ireland experienced a surge in cases as did most of Europe as a consequence of lifted restrictions). The final challenge came as an organized trucker protest was setting up just as we were heading to the airport. Jonathan’s transportation partner, Bruno, was exceedingly kind, calm and helpful in ensuring we made it to the airport in time for our flight! My husband and I have worked with a few of the listed travel specialists and I can honestly say that Jonathan Epstein was an absolute joy to work with and is absolutely worthy of a WOW label. I would work with him again in a heartbeat and highly recommend him without any reservation!\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL We could not speak more highly of Jonathan and his team at the offices, as well as on the ground in Ireland. With three and a half weeks’ notice, they planned a fabulous 10 day trip to the Republic of Ireland for our family of two adults and three teens from 2/28/22 to 3/1/22. (We had put off planning, due to Covid concerns, and Covid hardly impacted our trip at all.) We gave them a budget and a couple of wishes and they prepared the perfect trip for our needs.\n\nWe stayed two nights in Dublin, where we did a lovely and informative walking tour with Fiona. The next day, our fabulous guide, Brendan, picked us up and spent the next 8 days driving us around. We spent three nights in Galway and three in Cork. During the days, we explored the countryside and visited both historic landmarks and out of the way finds. Along the way, Brendan charmed us with his unending knowledge of historical facts, local stories, jokes, and quick wit. As Jonathan had predicted, Brendan is now on our Christmas card list!\n\nSome of the highlights included: visiting the Book of Kells and the Long Room in Dublin; a fantastic food tour in Galway with Clare; experiencing a private demonstration of sheepdog work in Connemara and getting to know Tom, the farmer; a tour of the Midleton distillery with a whiskey tasting; and visiting the Irish National Stud Farm. Each family member loved learning about the rich history and culture of Ireland. Our kids, aged 20, 18, and 14, were the perfect ages for this trip, as there was so much to learn but also a lot of time in the car to see the far-flung rural sites. We were fortunate to attend a Gaelic football game where Brendan, a former player, could explain all the rules. The kids are very into sports, so this was a definite highlight. In all, the itinerary was a perfect mix for all our interests, and the right amount of moving from one hotel to another.\n\nWe were aware how much work Jonathan, Katie in his office, and Brendan did to make sure we were treated as VIPs everywhere we went. Our schedule frequently changed on the fly, due to weather or our wish to stay longer to learn more about a particular place, and Brendan was able to arrange upcoming situations to fit, every time. He could always call ahead to the perfect restaurant to get us right in, and he knew people everywhere we went to pave our way. The weather was rainy and cold sometimes, and one morning it even snowed. This really did nothing to set back our enjoyment of the trip. In addition, we had the bad luck for four out of the five of us to catch a bug over three days, and Brendan was adept at organizing around these problems, always thinking of our needs and what would work to continue a fantastic vacation for our family.\n\nIn addition, Jonathan and Katie booked us the perfect hotels for our needs and budget with very short notice. They were all very high quality and we received wonderful service.\n\nLastly, this is our second family trip through Wendy Perrin, the first being to Colombia in 2020. It is even more clear to us that Wendy brings enormous value to the trip. Using her service guaranteed an agent who is not only an expert in the region, but also plans a dynamic, exciting, varied, and completely personalized holiday. We received the royal treatment wherever we went, and problems we faced were quickly arranged away. Each of us are experienced travelers, but we would not have been able to do the volume of planning required to make this trip happen so well and so quickly, or to sit back, relax, and experience all the joys of Ireland while trying to manage the myriad logistics on our own. For sure, we will be using Wendy from now on, whenever it is appropriate. Thank you so much to everyone involved, for making such a success of what was a very important trip for our family, before two of our children launch!\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL I am just back from a magnificent visit to London thanks to Jonathan Epstein. Work and family obligations kept me from traveling for a few years and then when I finally was able to travel again the pandemic happened. As a regular reader of Wendy Perrin’s newsletter, I finally decided last fall that it was time to start traveling again, but that the services of an expert trip planner were probably in order. Wendy directed me to Jonathan and his wonderful colleague Katie who were super attentive to my interests and also my circumstance as a woman traveling alone. I could not be more grateful to them.\n\nWhen Katie told me this might be one of few chances I would have to meet and hear mostly Brits in London I’m not sure I really believed her. January in London is the off season after all, but still I never expected to see Westminster Abbey with only 5 other visitors! The same was true almost everywhere I went, whether Churchill’s War Rooms, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul’s, Hampton Court Palace, Tower of London, British Museum. The food markets were busy but mostly with locals, and the same was true in the pubs and restaurants. Londoners were COVID cautious and respectful, with almost universal masking.\n\nMy tours were fantastic and my guides were smart, knowledgeable and fun. I really felt like I’d made new friends when we parted company. Jonathan and Katie steered me toward a few tours I might not have otherwise done – as a great travel planner should – and that made my days especially interesting. Alex and Emma made London come alive for me, not just through great history lessons and fun facts, but also by showing me different ways to experience the city. I would not have thought about London street art but Alex is an expert and I had so much fun learning about it from her. And Emma’s history of London in four drinks ended up in a gin distillery – what’s not to love about a great history lesson with a gin and tonic in hand! I really wanted to visit Hampton Court Palace again and fit in a visit to Oxford. Simon, my driver guide, made the day extra special by suggesting we include a stop at Runnymede and also asked if I’d like to attend Evensong at one of the college chapels in Oxford. The day was filled with great conversation, meaningful history, glorious sites and capped by a beautiful service at New College chapel.\n\nMy hotel could not have been more perfect – not just the room, also the dining room and mostly importantly the caring staff. Located across from Kensington Palace with easy access to the tube and bus and all of Hyde Park, I almost felt like a local. The Milestone is quintessentially English – just what I wanted.\n\nBetween the time I booked the trip and finally left the Covid rules must have changed three times. Jonathan and team kept me updated and reassured. Like many other travelers have said, I almost felt safer in London than I do here at home.\n\nThanks Jonathan and team for a memorable trip!\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL Jonathan and Nicole did an absolutely fantastic job curating our trip to Ireland. With our tight budget, we were out of our depth and overambitious with where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do, but Jonathan and Nicole helped focus our attentions. They treated us like royalty throughout the entire process. No inquiry about our trip was too small; no detail overlooked. This gave us an excellent experience in Galway and Dublin that we will cherish forever.\n\nIn the months leading up to the trip, Jonathan and Nicole monitored the COVID entry requirements and kept us updated, relieving us of the stress of wondering if there were any changes that would negatively impact our trip. Nicole gave us the necessary information to obtain our COVID tests for reentry into the U.S. at a clinic right around the corner from our hotel.\n\nWhen we told Jonathan and Nicole that we were fine to take a train from Dublin to Galway, they suggested and arranged for a private driver to meet us at Dublin airport when our flight arrived at 5:05 am and drive us the 2 and a half hours to our hotel in Galway. This made our arrival into Ireland seamless.\n\nWe relied on Jonathan and Nicole’s expertise and knowledge of Ireland for experiences, accommodations, dining options and travel logistics. As a result, all of our experiences and dinner reservations went off without a hitch. We would not have thought to go to dinner at any of the restaurants Jonathan and Nicole recommended and we would have missed out on some truly incredible meals and dining experiences.\n\nOur accommodations were wonderful and the staff at those places were very friendly and helpful. When the hotel in Galway overcharged us for our stay, Nicole contacted them immediately and procured a refund of the overpayment. I wasn’t able to accomplish this on my own when checking out of the hotel that morning so having Nicole as our advocate was a real bonus.\n\nWhen I booked separate activities for us, Nicole happily added the details to our itinerary for me. Nicole arranged a number of private tours for us with local guides, something we wouldn’t have been able to do on our own. The value received by having Irish natives show us their cities was immeasurable. We were better able to interact with the locals and get a non-touristy perspective of Ireland. When I went back to one of the restaurants on our food tour in Galway for dinner, the owner fit me in without a reservation because I had been there earlier with our local guide, Sheena. I think I might have been turned away otherwise.\n\nJonathan and Nicole saved us so much time, energy and money by planning this trip for us, which allowed us to just go and enjoy ourselves. It was wonderful and comforting to know that all of the details had been capably handled by Jonathan and Nicole. I would highly recommend the private food tour in Galway. Spending that private time with a local was a priceless way to learn about Galway and its people and to have meaningful dialogue about the similarities and differences between U.S. and Irish cultures. It was also a fantastic opportunity to get additional suggestions from a local about places to go and places to avoid as tourist traps.\n\nThe next time we go to Ireland, Scotland, England or Wales, we will be contacting this WOW list planner!\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL I can’t say enough about Jonathan and his team. After asking him in March to create a golf itinerary to Ireland for my husband and I and another couple, the other couple ultimately decided they wanted to go a different direction. However, when they backed out less than three weeks before we were supposed to leave because of COVID concerns, I sheepishly asked Jonathan if he might be able to pull something together on extremely short notice for just the two of us. What he did exceeded every expectation. He got to work right away and had an exceptional itinerary planned within two days. We played some of the best golf courses in the world along with a full itinerary of sightseeing, private sheep dog and falconry tours and a private tour/tasting at the first new distillery in Dublin in 125 years, Teeling Distillery. Our private driver/guides, Brendan and Noel, were exceptional and were full of interesting information about the good, the bad, and the ugly of Ireland. Brendan and Noel both went above and beyond to make our trip as stress free and relaxing as possible. From getting laundry done, shipping items back to the United States, setting up COVID travel testing and giving us Euros out of their own pockets when it proved difficult to change money, there was nothing they wouldn’t do for us. Brendan even met us on the 18th green at Doonbeg to present us with a gift and take a few pictures on our 16th wedding anniversary. The staff at the hotels told us that there would be no room services provided because of COVID protocols but each day we returned to find our rooms immaculately cleaned and made up. I have no doubt that Jonathan had a hand in this. When we were accidentally double billed at one of the hotels, I contacted Jonathan and he immediately got to work on the problem. I know he felt terrible about the extra charges on our credit card but I wasn’t concerned. We were in good hands and he wasn’t going to let anything take away from our Ireland experience. Thankfully we had no COVID troubles and the testing to return to the United States went off without a hitch but Jonathan gave me peace of mind when he told me that if something were to go wrong, he would make sure we had comfortable accommodations to catch up on Netflix while we quarantined and I have no doubt that he would have. I can’t recommend Jonathan and his team enough. They were thoughtful, considerate and took care of our every need and their attention to detail percolated down through everyone we dealt with on our travels, as well.\n\nIt has become our practice to consult Wendy Perrin’s WOW list whenever we plan a trip. This time our goal was to spend Christmas in London.\n\nAlthough we have been to London several times, we know that the holidays can be a challenge due to closures on the holiday.\n\nWendy suggested Jonathan Epstein and he certainly came through for us. We had an initial phone conversation with Jonathan and Nicole, his associate. This is an important step when planning a trip with a WOW advisor. We were able to discuss our previous visits to London and our desire to see and do something new. They asked us a lot of questions, which was beneficial.\n\nWe had a hotel in mind that we stayed in on a previous visit. Jonathan, however, strongly advised us to select another hotel, The Stafford. We are so happy we took his advice. It is a much smaller hotel than the one we were thinking of and that proved to be a big factor in feeling like we were “going home’ at the end of each day of touring London. The friendly and efficient staff quickly knew our names and treated us royally. The hotel was first class and it was decorated beautifully for the holidays. There was even a small Christmas tree in our room.\n\nAs we had already seen most of the highlights of London on previous visits, Jonathan suggested other tours we would not have thought of. One was a Charles Dickens walking tour. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. We understand now how London during Dickens’ time influenced his writing.\n\nAnother highlight was a private “Behind the Glass” after hours tour of The Churchill Cabinet War Rooms. We had seen the War Rooms before, however, nothing can compare to actually going into the rooms not accessible to the public in the evening when it is closed. Our guide was passionate about the history of this place and she made it come alive for us with the many stories and facts.\n\nThese are tours we would not have discovered on our own.\n\nJonathan and Nicole executed a WOW Moment for us during our stay. It was a surprise private tour and tasting of the amazing wine cellar at our hotel. It was built in the 17th century and used as an air raid shelter during WWII! The Master Sommelier, Gino, gave us the tour and impressed us with his knowledge. It was very special!\n\nGiven the shorter time period of this trip, we feel Jonathan was able to help us plan the perfect amount of activity and also allow time to walk about London and enjoy the beauty of the lights and amazing window displays and decorations everywhere.\n\nJonathan and Nicole certainly added value to our holiday in London and we would not hesitate to call upon them again.\n\nJonathan Epstein did a wonderful job of planning an extensive itinerary for our 3 1/2 week self-drive trip to Wales, a bit of England, and lots of Scotland for mid-September to mid-October 2019. Unlike most of our trips planned by one of Wendy’s experts, this was not an itinerary with guide and drivers everywhere. For the most part, I went to Jonathan to get suggestions for accommodations and a broad outline of how best to spend our time. For a relatively modest planning fee, we got far more than I’d expected. For each of our stops (almost all were at least three days each), Jonathan laid out a list of highlighted things he recommended we do. He was spot on for so many of them and though I’d faithfully perused my guidebooks, he had so many creative ideas and brought to our attention lots of things I’d not considered and in some cases even heard of. I was quite impressed that this modest planning fee yielded a full-fledged itinerary, all hotel reservations, restaurant reservations and much more. Nicole Baratelle ably handled all logistics and was responsive to every detail and question I raised. Unlike a trip we did earlier in the year, it was clear to me that while we were on the trip, both Jonathan and Nicole were actively monitoring it and were quickly responsive on the few times we got back to them.\n\nNow, mind you, this wasn’t one of the best trips my husband I have taken. But that was no fault of Jonathan and Nicole. The weather gods were determined to make me pay for 13 previous trips to the UK where I’d experienced virtually no rain and thus it rained on 22 out of 26 days on this trip. The weather kept us from doing a number of things we’d expected to do, such as hike the Pembrokeshire Coast Path in Wales (locals told us not even the Welsh would hike that path in rain and 40 mph wind gusts). We did have one truly glorious day of full sun in the Yorkshire Dales. We never made it to Mull, Iona and Staffa, our principal reason for staying at Isle of Eriska resort. Mull became essentially off limits when we learned our dates coincided with Mull’s off-road rally (which Jonathan and Nicole should have known about) but we then made plans to hire a private boat for a full-day trip to all three islands. Alas, the weather did not cooperate and two days running our boat trip could not go. Deep into the trip in Scotland when we had completely wearied of the incessant rain and checked with them to see if we could leave our relatively isolated lodgings a night early (and couldn’t), Nicole came up some great ideas of additional things to do that made us glad we’d stayed put. Our accommodations were a bit of a mixed bag. Some we’d expected not much of turned out to be wonderful, especially Northcote in Lancaster’s Ribble Valley — a place I’d never even thought of going. While we found the Ribble Valley fine, its charms were a bit fleeting. However, it’s a great place for food. Northcote is not to be missed. We had the single best dish we’ve eaten anywhere in the world — and had it on two nights it was that good. Plus Northcote was a great base for us to see parts of the Dales I’d not been to before and the Lake District for a day since my husband had never been there. Thornbury Castle as a base for southeast Wales made for long daily treks as it is across the estuary in England (and had an irritatingly loud wedding our first night there) but we didn’t see any better base in our travels across southern Wales. The Marcliffe Hotel in Aberdeen was an unexpected pleasure. Though principally a golfing hotel, we loved our room, the food was excellent and it was wonderfully located for exploring Scotland’s eastern coast.\n\nFinally, the one time we did have Jonathan and Nicole arrange a guide for us yielded one of our most memorable trip highlights — a day spent salmon fishing on the River Stincharfor with superb ghillie Gilbert Browne who taught us to fish for salmon (it is a different method from fly-fishing and a lot harder on the body), and regaled us with tales of how the 9th Duke of Wellington has been pestering him for years to sell him Gilbert’s side of the river, and how wild salmon have been decimated by the invasion of Norwegian-owned salmon fish farms and sea lice. The latter has much to do with our not catching any salmon that day (neither did he). He was so chagrined we didn’t he didn’t want to accept pay for the day (we insisted).\n\nThe only minor glitch in the trip was a restaurant reservation on a night that the restaurant was closed. It shouldn’t have happened and it precluded us from having a dinner at a place we’d very much wanted to eat at. However, I highly recommend Jonathan. The bang for the buck was exceedingly high and he and Nicole were both creative and responsive. If they’d only had an in with the weather gods….\n\nThis was going to be our first trip to England. We had interviewed another England specialist, but thought her trip was too expensive and relied on too many meetings with wealthy people who owned estates and needed tourists to subsidize their lifestyles. So we went with Jonathan. We had already planned to stay with friends the first three nights in Nether Wallop in Hampshire. Jonathan had the remaining seven days to plan. My husband wanted to see Stonehenge and the Churchill War Rooms in London, I wanted to see anything royalty.\n\nWe were convinced to spend four days in the Cotswolds, Not knowing that you needed to spend only one day there to get an idea of what they are like, this was overkill. We had made the mistake of telling Jonathan we didn’t like to pack and unpack a lot. So we spend four nights in the Cotswolds, this was definitely overkill. I think Jonathan should have told us, that all we needed was really one day. We were stuck with a driver, who ran the agency that Jonathan subcontracted out to be our driver. My husband and I called him “the yapper” as all he did was yap. And not about any history, as he knew nothing. He was a former brick salesman and he could tell us about the brick, but nothing else. When we got to Stonehenge our first day, we were dropped off and told where to get our admission tickets, and where to get the shuttle bus. We had no guiding whatsoever. The rest of our four days we were driven around and told “You can stop here, and look at this garden or here”. All our previous trips prepared by Wendy Perrin advisors we were escorted with either knowledgeable drivers or drivers and guides. This driver did have a nice car and dressed well.\n\nThe room that we stayed at Barnsley House was extremely hot, with no air conditioning. The room was right next to the kitchen, and very noisy. This was one of the specialty suites also! The gardens that were so highly acclaimed were nothing special at all. We stayed at The Barnsley House in the Cotswolds and were told we were to have our WOW moment one evening. After an amazing WOW moment we had on our trip the previous month in Argentina with a private chef, and small string quartets playing we were most excited. This WOW moment was dinner in an alcove in the garden. We were given the regular menu and had no clue that our dinner would be comped by the hotel. That was it. A comped dinner. Another night’s dinner at the hotel we were charged 50 pounds for another guests wine! As we couldn’t stand our guide we cut everyday’s tours short by an hour so we could rest at the hotel’s swimming pool!\n\nAfter four days traveling in the Cotswolds seeing lots of thatched roofs and brick buildings, with a side trip to Bath we drove to London with a stop at Oxford where we were told we could wander around by ourselves! In London we stayed at The Goring Hotel, a place I had always wanted to stay at. Unfortunately there was construction going on in the garden everyday. So our garden views that we paid extra for, were unsightly and noisy. Jonathan never told us that construction was going on and that another hotel might be a better choice. Our room was lovely. We did enjoy our guides in London. I wish we would have spent more time there and less in the Cotswolds. Although we did do the Churchill Museum pre opening tour, there was no time to see the other exhibits in the museum as we had to race to the next stop.\n\nWe found nothing special with this travel advisor’s planned trip. There was hardly any thought or creativity at all. The whole idea was to have someone else plan an exciting trip for us, not to wish that we had never gone on it. We found England extremely poor value for the money we spent, The whole idea of using a WP advisor is to get knowledgeable and personal guidance. We have used Wendy Perrin advisors for trips to Scotland, Italy, Kenya, The Maldives, Chile/Ecuador, and Argentina. We have recommend WP to numerous other people. Friends of our are shocked at our experience. They pushed me to write a review. I hesitate to write negative reviews, as I ordinarily vote with my feet by not going someplace again or not use a service again. We took this trip in May. It is now late October. If i had to write the review earlier, it would have been even more negative.\n\nWendy always say to complain write away if something is not working out. If you are given the owner of the Subcontracted agency to be your driver, who one would think would be the best and most knowledgeable driver, what can you do? If your hotel reservation had cancellation fees if you don’t stay there, you don’t change it. If your WOW moment is a dinner at the hotel in a garden where other guests stumble upon you, what are you to do? (Remember you are told that the dinner will be a WOW moment, but nothing about it is WOW. The only way to we could confirm that someone thought this was a WOW moment was that we didn’t see the bill upon check out at the hotel.) You suffer and wonder why this travel advisor got such rave reviews.\n\nResponse from Wendy:\n\nThere’s an important takeaway here for travelers, not just in England but anywhere: Express any disappointment to the trip planner during your trip, while the situation can be fixed. I wish Linda had followed this piece of advice that I send to each traveler shortly before departure (as part of my Trip Support System described here):\n\n“If you should end up with a guide you’re not comfortable with (a rare occurrence, but possible), and that guide is assigned to you for more than one day, report it to your travel specialist immediately. If you wait till you get home to register your complaint, the travel specialist does not have the opportunity to fix it during your trip—and they often can. Report the situation even if you’re worried it might get the guide in trouble. Sometimes personal styles just don’t mix. Waiting till you get home to complain does not benefit anyone.”\n\nJonathan says the same: “I wish they had emailed us or called us just once during the trip to vocalize disappointment. I could have juggled guides, added experiences, layered in guides for the sites they visited, switched hotel rooms, even switched hotels and probably without penalty. It breaks my heart to get an email like this as we could have helped during the trip.”\n\nJonathan also says that his driver-guides in England do not go into sites for the most part because most travelers like to explore independently. If a traveler wants lots of special VIP touring with guides inside the sites, of course Jonathan can set that up, but he got the strong impression from Linda that she did not want VIP touring. She had made clear that she did not want the level of expensive arrangements that the other England specialist had proposed for her.\n\nIt’s a shame that Linda found England to be poor value for the money. It’s certainly true that the U.S. dollar does not stretch nearly as far in England as it does in Argentina (Linda’s trip the month before the England trip). I’m sorry that Linda did not enjoy her WOW Moment, which was dinner in a private pavilion in this renowned garden. Most of all, I’m sorry that the Cotswolds didn’t appeal more to her. The Cotswolds are one of the world’s legendary picturesque landscapes with charming villages—the quintessential historic English countryside—and normally travelers want to spend at least several days, if not weeks, there.\n\nLinda Johnsey, Ireland October 2019\n\nWow, did we just experience that? Thank you so much to Jonathan Epstein & Nicole Baratelle for creating an extraordinary birthday trip for my husband. After my trip planning conversation with Jonathan, I realized that he had asked all the RIGHT questions. I felt strongly at that point that I was in good hands planning this trip. It was one wow moment after another on a daily basis while we were on this two-week odyssey.\n\nThank you for suggesting a driver because he made all the difference in the world. I am so thankful that we had Seamus Hester as our driver because he truly went above and beyond the call of duty. He asked us at the beginning of the trip what we were interested in experiencing. He exceeded our expectations and made sure we experienced Ireland to the fullest. Even after a full day of driving us around, he would take us to Irish pubs after dinner. His lunch recommendations were spot on to our requests for delectable seafood. The highlight was finding the volunteer at St. Colman’s Cathedral in Cobh that shared so much information about the details of the structures interior. That was a very special moment in time.\n\nSheen Falls Lodge proved to be a very memorable place. Thanks again Jonathan for the room upgrade. What a treat! Falconry at this facility was spectacular. The falconer asked us to place our iPhones on Slo-Mo mode and the videos are incredible. Gin tasting by John was another Wow moment. Can someone really spend more than one hour talking about gin? What an experience, we loved every minute of it! However, being driven to dinner in their 1936 antique car was the highlight.\n\nBallynahinch Castle is keeping a secret from everyone. I signed Don up for clay pigeon shooting. One question from the instructor, Don responds and the universe opens up. Three test shots & feedback from the instructor and Don is shooting at 100%. The secret is the instructor is Shane Bisg"
