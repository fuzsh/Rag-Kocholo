        "text": "The Parish Church\n\nTo an original design by the great Anglo-Catholic architect James Brooks (1825-1901) the church is thought to be the first in England dedicated to The Ascension of The Lord. The foundation stone, according to Henry Simmonds in ‘All About Battersea’ (1882) was situated ‘under the altar’ of the temporary church. The builder was Mr Chessam of Shoreditch, who worked with Brooks on other Anglo-Catholic churches in the East End. The sloping site, caused Brooks to spend far more than he had estimated, and discontent at the additional expense led to his dismissal and replacement, in 1883, by Messrs J. T. Micklewaite and Somers Clark, who completed the church almost entirely to Brooks’ design. The present chancel and first part of the nave was consecrated by The Rt Rev’d Anthony Thorold DD, Lord Bishop of Rochester, in whose diocese The Ascension then was, 30th June, 1883. James Brooks, who was the son of a Berkshire farmer, came to London in 1847, where he studied at the Royal Academy Schools. His early work was much influenced by William Butterfield, but he soon fell in love with the austere 13th century churches of France, which he was able to adapt well to the red brick town churches he was called upon to build for the Anglo-Catholic Movement. His great ark-like buildings are expressive of the advanced ritual and high doctrine of the Church in which Brooks himself firmly believed. Thomas Bumpus, writing in ‘London Churches Ancient and Modern’ (1908) wrote: ‘The Ascension, Lavender Hill, is conceived in a bold and vigorous Early Pointed style, recalling such Burgundian examples as Auxerre and Pontigny, admirably adapted to the present day requirements’. In fact, The Ascension is a miniature copy of the Cistercian Abbey Church of Our Lady at Pontigny! Measuring 138ft by 40ft excluding the north chapel, the first impression of the church is of an immense, severe, building, plain to the point of being daunting. Yet at the east end the curves of the apse, (reminiscent of the nearby St Peter’s, Vauxhall) the north chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, the hipped roof of the vestry and sacristy block and the candle-snuffer roof of the stair turrets give an altogether more romantic profile. The ark-like quality is achieved by the combination of the nave and chancel under a single, huge, roof ridge, terminating in its tall gable at the west end and the semi-circular apse at the other. The west elevation is slightly different to Brooks’ plan – a carved, Portland Stone Calvary, by A. T. Bradford (1921), which serves as a memorial to the War Dead, replacing an un-built great west door. The present main entrance is via the base of the unfinished Bell Tower with Steeple through two massive doors bearing the inscription ‘The pence of the poor paid for this door: 1884’.\n\nAll Glorious Within\n\nThe interior of the church stands in stark contrast to the exterior of the building. The lack of windows in the aisles, so much a part of its external severity, serves to create a sense of security and other-worldliness which concentrates the mind on what the building was intended for: the worship of almighty God. The present interior, though rather different from Brooks’ original, speaks powerfully of the majesty of God. The high altar, raised from the pavement of the sanctuary on a flight of three sweeping steps is an elongation of the Brooks’ original. Carved in oak in 1876, it has cylindrical, ringed, legs and circles of cinquefoils and contains a relic of Blessed Maria Gabriella of Unity, a picture of whom hangs on a pillar to the north of the sanctuary. The reredos, behind the altar, is a framework containing plaster panels from the 1930s depicting The Ascension, flanked by The Resurrection and Pentecost with panels of angels between, The six, large, baroque, candlesticks on the reredos, together with the matching crucifix, are of gesso on oak and date from the 1920s, as do the four smaller ones arranged between them. On a pillar to the north is the Consecration Cross bearing the Latin inscription ‘Consecratio huius Ecclesiae a Domino: Antonio Roffensi Episcopo: in crastino Sancti Petri Apostoli: MDCCCLXXXIII’. (This Church was consecrated to the Lord by Anthony, Bishop of Rochester, the day after the Feast of St Peter the Apostle, 1883) In the chancel, note the fine choir benches of polished oak and the simple oak lectern arranged for reading at the choir offices. The statues on the inner chancel pillars are of Our Lady of Walsingham, to the north, and St Michael the Archangel, to the south. The latter was brought by members of the Guild of St Michael from St Michael’s, Battersea, when they were expelled by an unsympathetic incumbent in 1885! The windows in the chancel apse are by C.E. Kempe and date from 1896. They depict, from the north side going left to right: The Prophet Daniel, The Prophet Malachi, St Elizabeth, Our Lady, Christ the King, St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist. To the south of the chancel is an embryonic transept, containing seven other windows. They depict: Christ the King, in the tracery roundel, St Michael and St Gabriel the Archangels, in the two smaller roundels, all by A. K. Nicholson, and St Edmund of East Anglia and St Martin of Tours, the work of Powell’s of Whitefriars and dating from 1904. The others are of St George the Martyr and St Alban the Martyr, from 1917 and 1919 respectively. The chancel is separated from the nave by a huge, oak, rood screen, complete with return stalls on the eastern side. Started in 1910, it is a memorial to the second Parish Priest, Father Charles Stebbing Wallace SSC, and was executed by his elder son Arthur Wallace. Replacing the Brooks screen of 1876, a low, plain, structure, it is a response to the Edwardian taste for mystery. Above is its attendant rood beam with figures of Our Lady and St John. In the arches of the screen can be found to the north a statue of St John Vianney and to the south one of Jesus the Good Shepherd. To the west of this screen is the nave altar with its surrounding sanctuary. The altar is in carved oak from about 1930 and contains a relic of St John Mary of Camporosso, a picture of whom hangs on a pillar to the north. The six, baroque, candlesticks are of cast brass and gilded. The pulpit to the south dates from about 1900 and is eight sides of an oak decagon. Set on a stone base, it has fleur-de-lys in the uprights of its handrail. Note the very fine carved mahogany crucifix above. In front of the nave altar are, to the north, the sedilia, an arrangement of chairs for the sacred ministers, and, to the south, an outstanding example of a Victorian brass eagle lectern. Dating from around 1870, this once stood in St Philip’s, Queenstown Road. To the north of the nave altar stands the now famous Shrine of Our Lady of Lavender Hill with a pair of very fine gothic pavement candlesticks and, to the south, St George the Martyr, a copy of the Donatello original, together with a pair of large bronze candlesticks finished in silver-gilt. The Blessed Sacrament Chapel, to the north of the church, is entered through a fine gilded iron screen a memorial to Father Wallace’s younger son, Father Raymond Job Wallace SSC, who was killed in action during the Great War. However, the chapel itself is a memorial to the first Parish Priest, Father John Bourdieu Wilkinson SSC, who died in 1885. The screen, which was made in 1895, bears a hatchment consisting of a Chalice and Host, above the gates, suggesting that the chapel beyond was used for exposition of the Blessed Sacrament. The altar is of carved oak and is late 19th century. It has six enormous turned baluster legs. Set in the red, marble, gradine is a gilded, wooden, tabernacle with exposition throne above, which houses an iron aumbry containing the Blessed Sacrament. Note the beautiful 18th century Spanish painted silk Conopeaum covering it. Rising above this is a folding, triptych, altarpiece, central to which is an oil-on-board painting of The Descent of the Holy Spirit. It was painted by Thomas Kempe in 1887. The gothic crucifix and candlesticks set with semi-precious stones came from St Philip’s, Queenstown Road. Note the painting of Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii to the north and the fine carved stone piscinia to the south. To the north of this chapel is a fine statue of Our Lady given by a former curate, Walter Julius Carey SSC, sometime Bishop of Bloemfontaine. The windows in this chapel are all by Thomas Kempe and date from 1887. From the west wall, working left to right, they depict: The Annunciation, The Visitation, The Nativity, The Presentation, and Christ the King Found in the Temple, the Five Joyful Mysteries of the Holy Rosary. In the nave, note the unusual Stations of the Cross around the walls, the work of Nina Somerset and Hilda Price, artists in residence during the 1930s. The statues to the north are, from east to west, of The Divine Infant, from a drawing of Christ in the Temple by Rembrandt, and St Agnes. To the south they are of The Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, St Vincent de Paul, and St Joseph the Worker. Either side of the Sacred Heart, note the outstanding Victorian Brass Standard Candlesticks, which once stood in the sanctuary of St Philip’s, Queenstown Road. At the west end, under the uncoloured windows of the steep gable, stands the impressive font. Designed by Brooks, it was erected in 1881 as a memorial to members of the Leigh-Meynell and Leigh-Pemberton (of Bank of England fame) families. It depicts reliefs of The Baptism of Christ, Christ and the Children, and The Baptism of the Eunuch. Behind the font is a very impressive Calvary. It is of carved and coloured oak and was brought from France in 1890. Near the tower porch door is a large, marble, holy water stoup, above which, surmounted by a small statue of Our Lady, Seat of Wisdom, is an illuminated memorial to the dead of the Great War by William Bromage, an earlier artist in residence. In the south west corner stands the altar of Our Lady of Walsingham. The crucifix and four, matching, candlesticks are from the 1940s. Behind it, is a window depicting St Francis of Assisi, a memorial to Mother Mary Caroline CCJ, it is an early example of the work of the Faithcraft Workshops."
