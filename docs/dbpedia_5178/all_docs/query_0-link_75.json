        "text": "Isabel, Countess of Glasgow, about Kelburn Castle, ancestral home of the\n\nearls of Glasgow since 1700 and of their forebears for long centuries\n\nbefore that.\n\n''In fact,'' added her husband Patrick, the tenth earl, ''the castle\n\nhas been inhabited for as long as anybody can remember and it's been\n\nonly natural that everyone who's lived here has impressed their own\n\ncharacter, their own taste, on the trappings of the house.''\n\nIt is this more than anything else that contributes an atmosphere of\n\nthe castle as somewhere that has very much been -- and very much still\n\nis, I would emphasise -- ''lived in.'' And for me the family photographs\n\non the escritoire in the great drawing room, the teddy bears on its\n\nwindow-sill, the Bechstein piano with the words Hof Lieferant Sr Maj des\n\nKaisers u Konigs inscribed on the underside of its lid, the books in the\n\ncabinets throughout, all testify to a continuity of this sense of place.\n\nThere has been a castle at Kelburn -- set in rolling parkland south of\n\nthe Hailie Brae between Largs and Fairlie and with a spectacular view\n\nfrom the north Ayrshire coast across the Firth of Clyde to the Cumbraes\n\nand the island of Arran -- since the thirteenth century. The land on\n\nwhich it stands has belonged to the Boyle family since that time and has\n\ndescended to the present owner in the direct line of male succession.\n\nArchitecturally, it is an agglomeration of four contrasting styles.\n\nThe earliest (thirteenth century) part is a square keep (''I like the\n\ntiny bedrooms off its turret, don't you?'' said Lady Glasgow as she ever\n\nso slightly bent her head to lead me into one of them) around which was\n\nbuilt a James VI tower house in the 1580s.\n\nHere today, as everywhere else in the castle, it is clear that hardly\n\na single square foot is wasted. Every room is functional. Bedrooms are\n\nvery much bedrooms and bathrooms very much bathrooms. Of the latter the\n\ncountess observed: ''I had iron bars installed on the heating rails in\n\nthem rather than plastic bars, simply to keep the fittings in concert\n\nwith the 'feel' of the house overall.''\n\nThe greatest glory of Kelburn for the visitor, however, is the\n\nWilliam-and-Mary addition that was built, as the seventeenth century\n\nmerged with the eighteenth, at an angle to the earlier thirteenth and\n\nsixteenth-century towers. A line of baroque state rooms marches behind a\n\nfacade designed in what was to be one of the last vestiges of Scottish\n\ntower house vernacular. Over the door to its centrepiece -- the great\n\ndrawing room -- stands a pediment and on this pediment is the\n\ninformation that the room was completed in 1700.\n\nThe motif of the cornices is an entwining of the thistle and the rose\n\nclearly designed to anticipate the forthcoming union of the two\n\nparliaments of Scotland and England in 1707.\n\nAlthough a trifle premature, there was political method behind this\n\nidea. David Boyle, during whose time the work was carried out, was one\n\nof those who pushed the Act of Union through a not altogether unanimous\n\nScottish Parliament, for which he was rewarded with his elevation to\n\nbecome the first Earl of Glasgow.\n\nOf his achievement at Kelburn, it has been said that ''Lord Glasgow\n\ncobbled together and drilled into symmetry a reworking of such\n\ntraditional elements as crow-stepped gables, chimneys, and a heraldic\n\npanel over the principal door.\n\n''To give an ornamental flourish, the prosaic rain-water pipe became\n\nan extravaganza in leadwork. Although it divides, in order to preserve\n\nthe necessary symmetry, it seems to owe more to heraldry than\n\narchitecture and culminates in a three-dimensional and rather dotty\n\ndouble-headed eagle over the entrance -- a spirited rendering of the\n\nfamily crest. These marked architectural failings, however, are the\n\nsource of its very considerable charm.''\n\nThe subsequent addition of the Victorian, or ''dining room'' wing in\n\nthe nineteenth century is typical of its period: the Raeburn portraits;\n\nthe wrought-iron hinges on the new front door; the choice of grates\n\nfitted to old chimney pieces; the light fittings. Here too is the\n\nepitome of Victoriana -- the original William Morris wallpaper with its\n\nacanthus design and the Morris curtains with their tulip montage.\n\nKelburn Castle has 50 rooms in all, eight of these being bedrooms with\n\nprivate bathrooms and eight being bedrooms without such additions. One\n\nof the fixtures that Lady Glasgow has been anxious to retain throughout\n\nthe building is the claw-foot wrought-iron baths in preference to\n\nanything more ''modern,'' which she feels would be out of harmony with\n\nthe building's overall surroundings.\n\nFor me one of the nicest vignettes of the castle and its surroundings\n\nstands at a stone's throw to the south-west of the main buildings. It is\n\na delightful little square box garden that the third earl had planted in\n\n1769 in the shape of the St Andrew's Cross and with his children's\n\ninitials (G for George, E for Elizabeth, H for Helen, and J for Jane)\n\nplanted in miniature hedges at the inside corner of each of the four\n\nindividual enclosed gardens.\n\nThe whole estate of the Glasgows stretches for 35 acres over the\n\nhillside and comprises two farms, one lowland and the other hill. Both\n\nare at present sheep farms, but the intention is to convert the lower to\n\nmixed grazing.\n\nIn 1977 the Kelburn Country Centre was opened and the south side of\n\nthe park is now available to the general public between April and\n\nSeptember of each year, with a wide range of facilities for recreation,\n\nincluding pony trekking, a pets corner, and an assault course. There are\n\nalso a museum and various exhibitions, a potter's workshop, a craftshop\n\nand a tearoom, neatly created out of the old 1700 farm buildings.\n\nKelburn is renowned for its rare and unusual trees, including the\n\nlargest Monterey pine in Scotland, two yew trees that are both more than\n\n1000 years old, and an extraordinary weeping larch.\n\nThe castle itself, however, is open to the public for only five weeks\n\nafter Easter each year, and thousands of tours are conducted around it\n\nand through all its state rooms and its nooks and crannies.\n\nFor the rest? Kelburn Castle remains what it has been for much of its\n\nhistory over more than seven centuries -- the home of the Boyle family,\n\ntheir friends, and their relations."
