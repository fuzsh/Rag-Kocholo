        "text": "Boyle History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nThe Irish surname Boyle comes from the Irish Gaelic Ó Baoighill, possibly derived from the earlier Irish word \"baigell,\" which meant \"having profitable pledges.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Boyle family\n\nThe surname Boyle was first found in Donegal (Irish: Dún na nGall), northwest Ireland in the province of Ulster, sometimes referred to as County Tyrconnel, where they were descended from King Maoldun Baoghal (meaning \"peril\") of the Heremon line of Irish Kings. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Boyle family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Boyle research. Another 187 words (13 lines of text) covering the years 1078, 1164, 1296, 1566, 1574, 1588, 1607, 1609, 1612, 1617, 1621, 1623, 1639, 1643, 1644, 1646, 1667, 1679, 1682, 1687, 1694, 1698, 1699 and 1702 are included under the topic Early Boyle History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBoyle Spelling Variations\n\nNames from the Middle Ages demonstrate many spelling variations. This is because the recording scribe or church official often decided as to how a person's name was spelt and in what language. Research into the name Boyle revealed many variations, including Boyle, O'Boyle, Boghill, Hill, Boile, Baoghal, Baole and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Boyle family\n\nNotable amongst the family name at this time was\n\nRichard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, (1566-1643), an English settler in Ireland\n\nThe Lady Alice Boyle, Countess of Barrymore, (1607-1667) was the eldest daughter and second child of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork\n\nRichard Boyle (c.1574-1644), Archbishop of Tuam\n\nMichael Boyle, the younger (1609?-1702), Archbishop of Armagh\n\nRoger Boyle (1617?-1687), an Irish Protestant churchman, Bishop of Down and Connor and Bishop of Clogher\n\nCharles Boyle, 3rd Viscount Dungarvan (c.1639-1694), a British peer and politician\n\nRoger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery (1621-1679), British soldier, statesman and dramatist\n\nRoger Boyle, 2nd Earl of Orrery (1646-1682), an Irish peer and politician\n\nRichard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington, 2nd Earl of Cork (1612-1698), Lord High Treasurer of Ireland\n\nFrancis Boyle, 1st Viscount Shannon (1623-1699), Privy Counselor of Ireland and Governor of County Cork\n\nBoyle World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Boyle is the 989th most popular surname with an estimated 29,844 people with that name. 3 However, in Canada, the name Boyle is ranked the 821st most popular surname with an estimated 6,535 people with that name. 4 And in Australia, the name Boyle is the 319th popular surname with an estimated 11,125 people with that name. 5 New Zealand ranks Boyle as 443rd with 1,535 people. 6 The United Kingdom ranks Boyle as 300th with 20,127 people. 7\n\nLoading...\n\nBoyle migration to the United States +\n\nTo escape the religious and political discrimination they experienced primarily at the hands of the English, thousands of Irish left their homeland in the 19th century. These migrants typically settled in communities throughout the East Coast of North America, but also joined the wagon trains moving out to the Midwest. Ironically, when the American War of Independence began, many Irish settlers took the side of England, and at the war's conclusion moved north to Canada. These United Empire Loyalists, were granted land along the St. Lawrence River and the Niagara Peninsula. Other Irish immigrants settled in Newfoundland, the Ottawa Valley, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The greatest influx of Irish immigrants, however, came to North America during the Great Potato Famine of the late 1840s. Thousands left Ireland at this time for North America and Australia. Many of those numbers, however, did not live through the long sea passage. These Irish settlers to North America were immediately put to work building railroads, coal mines, bridges, and canals. Irish settlers made an inestimable contribution to the building of the New World.
