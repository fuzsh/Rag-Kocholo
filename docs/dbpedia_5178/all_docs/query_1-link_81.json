        "text": "Recently I posted a conjectural pedigree tracing possible descents of the Bole family of Westmoreland co, Pennsylvania, and the Boyle family of Limavady, co. Londonderry, Ireland, from John Boyle (abt 1464?-abt July 1555), laird of Kelburn, Ayrshire, Scotland. This article picks up with John’s ancestry, both known and hypothetical. It includes what I believe are the most likely connections to the Boyvilles of co. Cumberland, England, and of Normandy, France.\n\n1. Godard de Boyville, b. abt 1063?. In co. Cumberland he was the first lord of Millom by grant of William de Meschines, and held the manor of Kirksanton [4, 20]. Godard was a contemporary of Richer de Boyville, b. abt 1075?, d. abt 1150?, reputedly a vassal in Normandy, France, of William’s brother Ranulph de Meschines, Viscount of Bayeux. If so, Richer was likely a native of Boyville (Beauville, Beuville, Biéville, Boeville), located 5 miles NNE of Caen in Normandy and 22 road miles from Bayeux. In England, Ranulph granted Richer the barony of Levington that included the manors of Kirklinton and Solport, co. Cumberland [3]. The patronage of both Godard and Richer by the Meschines suggests that they were of the same family and may have been brothers. Godard was the father of [4, 20]:\n\n2. ——- de Boyville, b. abt 1091? [4, 20]. Father of [4, 20]:\n\n3. Robert de Boyville, b. abt 1116?, m. abt 1141? to Margaret, daughter of Waldeve [18]. By right of his wife he held part of Newby, Yorkshire [18]. Sometime before 1152 he resigned his land of Kirksanton, co. Cumberland, so that he could hold it as a free tenant after pilgrimage [21]. Father of [18, 21]:\n\n4. William de Boyville, b. abt 1142?, d. aft 1174, held land in Kirksanton, co. Cumberland and received further land there from the abbot of St. Mary’s, York, sometime 1161-1184 [18]. He also repeatedly granted rights in Kirksanton in the period 1175-1194 [21]. Father of [18, 21]:\n\n5. Robert de Boyville, b. abt 1168?, who in 1209/10 witnessed a charter of Alice de Rumilly regarding Borrowdale, co. Cumberland [18]. Father of [18]:\n\n6. Guy de Boyville, b. abt 1194?, d. aft 1246 [18], m. ca 1219? to ——-, daughter of William de Thursby, of Thursby, Yorkshire [18]. In 1241 he had co. Westmoreland property seized for having failed to tend to the knighthood of Ralph d’Eyncourt [17, 19].\n\nGuy was the father of Sir William de Boyville, b. abt 1220?, d. 1291/2 [5, 18, 22], who m. to Alice ——- [19]. Given the Kelburn connection to the Cumyn family (see below), it seems significant that in 1249 William was a witness in Annandale, co. Dumfries, Scotland, to a grant made to Sir Robert de Brus, which was also witnessed by Sir Walter Cumyn, Earl of Menteith, Sir Alexander Cumin, Earl of Buchan, and Sir John Cumin [12]. It may have been about this time that William was a forester in Allerdale, SW of Carlisle in Cumberland co [20].\n\nIn 1261 William and his wife Alice sued regarding land in Carnforth in Lancashire [19]. In 1268, and again in 1272, he served in an inquisition, the latter in Carlisle involving the Cumberland estate of the widow of Sir Eustace de Bayllol (Baliol) [12]. By 1274 he was the king’s escheator north of the River Trent, under King Edward I of England. A Henry de Boyville was his clerk by 1278-9 [12, 23]. In 1280 William was again part of an inquisition in Carlisle. Two years later was elected Sheriff of co. Cumberland and Constable of Carlisle Castle, but the election was revoked by King Edward [5]. In 1287 William held part of the lands of Skipton Castle, Yorkshire. In 1288 he arrived at an agreement with the prior of St. Bees regarding Kirksanton manor, located in Millom, co. Cumberland [18].\n\nIn July 1291, after King Edward asserted overlordship of Scotland, William accepted a commission to take the fealty of the Bishop of Whithorn to Edward, as well as the fealty of all of Galloway. He was rewarded by being made warden of the Scottish castles of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Wigtown. In that capacity, in late Nov 1291 he petitioned for £8 to support his housing in Dumfries Castle. However, in early March 1291/2, Henry de Boyville was to be paid for the custody of the castles, “after the death of Sir William de Boyville” [5, 12].\n\nWilliam may have been the brother of, and Guy the father of:\n\n7. ——– de Boyuile?, b. abt 1223?, d. bef 1278, m. abt 1248? to Marjory Cumin [7], daughter of Sir Walter Cumin of Rowallen, Ayrshire [16]. In another blog entry I surmised that because of his marriage he was an adherent of the Cumins (Comyns), who became closely allied with the Baliols about 1269 when Sir John Comyn married Alianora Baliol, sister of the future King John Baliol [9]. John Baliol possessed the district of Cunningham in Ayrshire, within which is Kelburn [10, 11]. Thus the circumstances suggest that this man, whose given name is unknown, may have been the original Boyle possessor of Kelburn, obtaining it about 1270 from Sir Walter Cumin [16], who may have himself obtained it from the Baliols. He died before 1278 [15]. Father of [8]:\n\n8. Richard de Boyuile, b. abt 1248?, d. aft 1295, m. abt 1275? to Anicia Mure, b. abt 1252?, daughter of Sir Gilbert Mure (Gilchrist Mor), of Pokellie (Polkelly), co. Ayr, Scotland, by an unknown wife [13]. Richard was of Kilburne (Kelburn) at the time of his marriage, when he was granted the lands of Polruskane by Gilbert Mure (who d. 1277) [1, 14]. Richard was styled lord of Calburne (Kelburn) when chartered the rents of Malderland by Sir Walter Cumyn, at some point in or before 1277 when Sir Walter was dead. He was also of Ryesholm, co. Ayr [1]. He is believed to have held Wamphray in co. Dumfries, Scotland, in that Ryesholm was a tenandry (freehold) of the lordship of Wamphray, said to have been “the original holding in Scotland of the de Boyville family now represented by the Boyles, Earls of Glasgow” [6]; i.e., the Kelburn family. In 1296 his name was inscribed on the Ragman Rolls [1]. Father of [8]:\n\n9. Sir Robert de Boyvilla, b. abt 1273?, d. aft 1295, is said to have succeeded his father as lord of Kelburn. His name was also inscribed on the Ragman Rolls in 1296, and he used a seal bearing a “bull’s head cabossed” [8]. Its use suggests that even at that early date, the name was being pronounced in contracted form as “Bole”. Father of? [8]:\n\n10. Richardus (Richard) de Boyville?, b. abt 1298?, a tenant mentioned in a charter of Sir Fergus de Ardossan in Dalry par, co. Ayr, probably about 1320 [8]. Father of? [8]:\n\n11. Hugo de Boyll?, b. abt 1325?, of Ryesholm, co. Ayr, made a donation to Paisley Abbey in co. Renfrew in 1399 [8]. Father of? [8]:\n\n12. John Boyle?, b. abt 1353?, of Caleburne (Kelburn) in 1417, sat in an assize that year [8]. Father of? [8]:\n\n13. Robert Boyle?, b. abt 1381?, d. bef 1457, of Calburn (Kelburn), in 1446 witnessed a charter to John Boyle of Wamphray, co. Dumfries, of the lands of Ryesholm [8]. Father of [8]:\n\n14. Robert Boyle, b. abt 1408?, d. bef 1478, had sasine of the Kelburn lands in 1456 [8]. Father of [2]:\n\n15. William Boyle, b. abt 1436?, d. abt 1494, had sasine of Kelburn bef 1478. He witnessed a sasine in 1482, and in 1493 had sasine of his grandfather Robert’s office of hereditary Sergeant or Coroner in the lordship of Largs [8]. Father of [8]:\n\n16. John Boyle, b. abt 1464?, d. abt July 1555, had sasine of Kelburne in 1495. He was chartered South Ballochmartine, Great Cumbrae island, co. Bute, in 1536, by King James V [8].\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Boles, D.B. (2017). The Origins and Descendants of James Bole of Westmoreland and Armstrong Counties, Pennsylvania. Tuscaloosa, AL: private print. Available at Lulu.com.\n\n[2] The Scots Peerage presented a pedigree showing (13.) Robert Boyle as the father of an unknown Boyle who died before Robert, in turn the father of (15.) William Boyle (Paul, J.B., The Scots Peerage. Edinburgh: David Douglas., v. 1, p. 535, 1904-14). However, a footnote indicated that the version I have shown (Robert father of Robert father of William) is equally plausible. In my view it is more plausible, as William is known to have been the grandson of the first Robert (see text); the second Robert was surely the son of the first given the 1456 sasine; and there is no evidence of any other intervening Boyle.\n\n[3] Information retrieved from http://www.kirklintonhall.co.uk/main-hall (2017). The page was the source of much of the information on Richer, but unfortunately has since been taken down. A rough summary apparently drawn from the page appears at https://venues4hire.org/venue/details/25520/kirklinton-hall-marquee-venue (2020), but does not include the important statement that Richer had been Ranulph de Meschines’ vassal in Normandy. Partial support comes from the statement that “There were De Boyvilles who were feudal tenants of Beuville, near Caen” (Robertson, W. Ayrshire: Its History and Historic Families. Kilmarnock, Scotland: Dunlop & Drennan, 1908), and that Boyville or Boeville was a “common name in Normandy, Twelfth Century” (Pickett, T.E. The Quest for a Lost Race. Louisville, Ky: John P.

The wording of the authoritative 1904 genealogy of the family is typical:\n\nThere seems to be no doubt that the lands of Kelburne in Cunningham were held by ancestors of the Earls of Glasgow for many years before 1292 … but the records of their tenure have disappeared: and for long afterwards the succession to the lands can only be inferred from the occasional occurrence, in records and charters, of the name and designation of Boyle of Kelburne. [1]\n\nWhen more specific estimates have been proposed for the first appearance of the family at Kelburn, the dates have tended to be “deep” — as, for example, the modern suggestion that the family acquired Kelburn in 1143 [2]. As indicated in my recent book on the Bole/Boyle family genealogy, such suggestions may have derived from the legend that the family was granted the property because it was related by marriage to Hugh de Morville, a magnate who came to Scotland sometime after 1124. Unfortunately, that logic seems to be confused, because the marriage relationship between the Morvilles and the Boyvilles (as the Boyles were then styled), did not occur until sometime between 1216 and 1272, and involved Boyvilles of co. Cumberland, England, not of Kelburn [3].\n\nRecently, on rereading one of the few authentic records of the early history of the family for perhaps the hundredth time, I had an insight that suggests a less deep origin at Kelburn. I propose that the property came to the family only about the year 1270.\n\nThe Record\n\nThe record in question was described in the 1904 genealogy:\n\nSir George Mackenzie, who died in 1691, mentions as extant in his time a ‘sasine of the lands of Kelburne given to Richard Boil, eldest son to Boil of Kelburn and Marjory Cumin his wife, daughter to Cumin of Rowallen, and this was in the reign of K. Al. 3,’ (i.e. between 1249 and 1285-86). [1]\n\nAlthough I had previously read this closely when examining the relationship between the Boyles and the Cumins, I had never asked something obvious. Why was Boil of Kelburn’s wife mentioned in the sasine? A sasine, a term specific to land ownership in Scotland, was issued to show that an heir had lawful possession of a piece of property. In most cases, property descended from a deceased owner to his oldest surviving son or brother. In such cases, there was no need to name a spouse.\n\nYet there was Marjory Cumin, daughter of Cumin of Rowallen. The insight came to me in the proverbial flash: Perhaps Kelburn came to the Boyles through their intermarriage with the Cumin family. If so, there would have been every reason to mention Marjory in the sasine.\n\nSupporting Circumstances\n\nAn important consideration is that Kelburn, as stated in the first citation above, is part of Cunningham, or Cunninghame, the northernmost district of Ayrshire north of the Irvine River. The district was granted to Hugh de Morville in the time of King David I (reigned 1124-1153). From the Morvilles it passed by inheritance and marriage to the lords of Galloway, a co-heiress of which, Dervorgille, married John de Baliol [4]. It appears that Dervorgille received the bulk of the Cunningham lands.\n\nThus in 1268, when John de Baliol died [5], it is probable that what is now Kelburn lay within the feudal domain of the Baliol family. This conclusion was also reached by Ayrshire historian William Robertson, who pointed out that when John de Baliol’s namesake son later became King of Scotland, “The Boyles of Kelburn therefore became tenants in chief of the Crown” [6].\n\nA critical juncture in the story of Kelburn may therefore have been reached near the time of John de Baliol’s death. About the year 1269, Sir John Comyn, “the Black”, lord of Badenoch, married Alianora Baliol, the sister of the future King John Baliol [7]. In effect, through this marriage, two of the most powerful families in Scotland formed a military alliance.\n\nComyn is the same surname as Cumin. As we have seen, the 13th century sasine summarized by Sir George Mackenzie ascribed the wife Marjory Cumin, daughter of Cumin of Rowallen, to Boil of Kelburn. Thus was provided a vector by which the Boyle family may have acquired Kelburn. Specifically, it seems possible that because Cumin of Rowallen was a member of the newly allied Comyn family, the Baliols granted him feudal rights to Kelburn in return for military service. In turn Cumin may then have granted Kelburn to his Boyle son-in-law. Then after Boyle died, a sasine was granted to the couple’s son Richard Boyle, confirming his possession of Kelburn.\n\nNot only are the linkages logical, they explain why there are no previous mentions of Boyles at Kelburn [9]. They imply that Richard Boyle was the first hereditary laird of Kelburn in the Boyle line, his father “Boil of Kelburn” having been so only by right of marriage.\n\nA Tight Chronology\n\nIf this was indeed the scenario by which Kelburn came to the Boyles, events must have transpired along a tight chronology. This conclusion derives from another 17th-century clue to the family’s origins:\n\nThere is… a Chartor extant Granted by [Sir Gilchrist Mure, or More] to his daughter Anicia of the lands of Cuthsach, Gulmeth, Blaracharsan… [etc.] [Portions of land] now not knowne by these names…. Ritchard a Boyle del Culliburne, having obtained fra Sr Walter Cumine ane an. rent [i.e., an annual rent] of fiftie schilling out of the lands of malsland… is supposed (& not vnprobably) to have obtained in marriage the forsd. Anicia, and wt her the land forsds. disponed to her by Sr Gilchrist, being certainlie lands of Polruskane… [8]\n\nThe gist of this difficult passage is that Sir Gilchrist Mure granted a charter of Polruskane to his daughter Anicia, who is believed to have been the wife of Richard Boyle. Presumably he was the same Richard Boyle named in the 13th century sasine — for he had obtained a rent from Sir Walter Cumin.\n\nThe chronological relevance is that Mure died in 1277, and Sir Walter Cumin died before Mure [8]. Thus if the scenario is correct, within about 8 years of the Comyn-Baliol marriage alliance, in approximate order (a) Kelburn was granted by the Baliols to Sir Walter Cumin, (b) Kelburn was regranted by Sir Walter Cumin to —– Boyle, the previously married husband of his daughter Marjory, (c) —– Boyle died, (d) Richard Boyle received sasine to Kelburn by right of his Cumin mother, (e) Sir Walter Cumin granted rents to Richard Boyle, (f) Sir Gilchrist Mure granted Polruskane to Anicia, (g) Richard Boyle married Anicia Mure, (h) Sir Walter Cumin died, and (i) Sir Gilchrist Mure died. Even if some events appear in the list out of order and the chronology extended somewhat beyond Gilchrist’s death, it seems likely that the Boyles acquired Kelburn about 1270. They could not have done so later than 1286, the latest possible date of Richard Boyle’s sasine.\n\nGenealogical Complexities\n\nThere are, however, certain genealogical complexities that accompany the scenario. Chief among them is that Sir Gilchrist Mure was himself a son-in-law of Sir Walter Cumin of Rowallen [8]. That creates at least the appearance of Richard Boyle having married his own close relative when he married Gilchrist’s daughter, Richard’s mother having been a Cumin of Rowallen.\n\nCloser examination, however, reveals that Anicia Mure could not possibly have been Sir Gilchrist’s child by his Cumin wife. The reason is that Gilchrist married Isobell Cumin after the battle of Largs [8], which occurred in late 1263. Thus any offspring of the couple could not have been of age, as was Anicia, to be granted land before Gilchrist’s death in 1277. Gilchrist must have had an unknown first wife, a supposition supported by his age, nearly 80, at the time of his death [8]. Anicia must have been Gilchrist’s child by that wife, making her unrelated to her husband Richard Boyle.\n\nInterestingly, an argument can be made that Richard’s mother was the daughter not just of some generic Cumin of Rowallen, but of Sir Walter Cumin himself. Diligent searches have failed to turn up any other Cumins associated with that location. Rowallen was in Walter’s possession by 1263 [8], and he may have been the first Cumin owner. He was certainly the last, for after his death sometime prior to 1277, Rowallen passed to the Mures [8].\n\nA Final Question\n\nA final question worth considering is whether a circa 1270 origin for the Boyles at Kelburn allows the family’s legendary (i.e., undocumented) participation in the battle of Largs in 1263 (see blog entry 28. The Kelburn Thistle and the Boyle Family). The short answer is “yes”.\n\nIf Anicia More was of age to be granted land prior to her father’s 1277 death, she may have been born (at a guess) around 1254. Her husband Richard Boyle may therefore have been born about 1250, and his father “Boil of Kelburn” about 1224. The latter would certainly have been of military age in 1263, even if these estimates are off by a few years.\n\nFurthermore, the father was probably of the district of Cunningham when the battle occurred. This inference follows from his pre-existing marriage to Marjory Cumin, and her family’s possession of Rowallen at the time of the battle. Rowallen — or Rowallan as it is spelled today — is in Cunningham and is located about 25 road miles SE of Kelburn. Although under the scenario, Boyle would not have been in possession of Kelburn at the time, he was likely from the district and could well have served in the battle of Largs.\n\nPostscript: Unfortunately my “sabbatical” is not yet over. I have composed this in a lull in the writing of my psychology textbook. That lull is now over, so I return to that work.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Boyle, R. (1904).

John, the son of John and Alianora, was one of the leaders of a Scottish army in 1296, and the following year had at least one child old enough to serve as a hostage. Thus the younger John could not have been born much after 1270 (Paul, J.B., The Scots Peerage.Edinburgh: David Douglas., v. 1, p. 508, 1904-14).\n\n[8] Mure, W. (1825). The Historie and Descent of the House of Rowallane. Glasgow: Chalmers and Collins. The original manuscript was written in or before 1657.\n\n[9] A major reason to propose this scenario is the conclusion mentioned in the text, that Kelburn was part of the Baliol domain. Thus the question is how Baliol land came to the Boyles, and the scenario provides a possible answer. Alternatively, however, it is possible that the Cumin family, seated at Rowallen within Cunningham, had prior possession of Kelburn and that it came to the Boyles as a tocher (wedding portion) on the marriage to Marjory Cumin circa 1250. While this would not change the scenario in one respect — Kelburn would still have come by way of the Cumins — it would change the date at which it occurred.\n\nOn this day, October 2nd, 753 years ago – in 1263 – a small Scottish force met an equally small invading Norwegian force on a beach near Largs, Ayshire. Although the Norwegians were able to hold the field after fierce back-and-forth fighting, they were subsequently forced to gather their dead and retreat to their ships. It was the beginning of the end of Norwegian overlordship of the western seaboard of Scotland. Three years later, by the Treaty of Perth, King Magnus VI Haakonsson of Norway ceded the Hebrides and the Isle of Man to King Alexander III of Scotland.\n\nBy military standards the action had been a small one, tactically inconclusive even though it ultimately proved strategically significant. In a sense the invasion had even been accidental, for while the Norwegians had amassed a vast armada of ships, it had been a storm that prematurely drove some of the boats onto the beach, triggering the Scottish reaction. Similarly, it was weather that forced the armada to retreat to Norway.\n\nA Fateful Thistle\n\nBeyond the bare historical account there is a curious, romantic story about the Battle of Largs that holds great cultural significance for Scotland. According to tradition, the Norwegian presence on the beach at Largs was unsuspected until one of the barefoot Norsemen stepped on a thistle, crying out in pain. The Scottish troops were alerted, and the battle was on. As a result the thistle has become a symbol of Scotland itself.\n\nIs the thistle story true? There appears to be no primary source for it. But as early as 1470, King James III used the thistle as a national symbol on coinage. In 1540, King James V created the Order of the Thistle, an honorary title for Scottish knights. The thistle today is regarded as the oldest of the national flowers, and it decorates many a coffee mug and T-shirt in tourist shops in Edinburgh.\n\nKelburn in the Battle of Largs\n\nThe thistle tradition holds a special place in my heart, because tradition also places the Boyle family of Kelburn Castle at the Battle of Largs, aiding King Alexander [1]. Possibly commemorating that, in the 19th century, Kelburn Castle had a turret that terminated in what was said to show “the finishing personality and nationality of Scottish architecture — the crest of the Laird surmounted by the thistle.” [2]\n\nWas the fateful thistle a Boyle one? Largs is only two miles from Kelburn Castle. Given that the site of battle is not entirely certain, and that lordly domains extended over large distances, it is not out of the realm of possibility. However, most likely not. In the middle and late 13th century, the lordship of Largs was held by the Baliol family [3], and that likely encompassed most if not all of the possible battle sites.\n\nThistles at Kelburn\n\nNevertheless there are still thistles at Kelburn. Earlier this year my wife and I toured the castle gardens. We found among the proliferation of flowers in the Plaisance, the brilliant rose of the thistle (photo). Whether the traditions are true or not, my ancestral estate of Kelburn recognizes its place within the colorful, historical Scottish landscape.\n\nPostscript: Developments in the Boyle of Kelburn Ancestry\n\nThis is only one of several blog entries I have written on the Boyles of Kelburn. Others include “8. The Kelburn Castle Origin of the Boles Family: A DNA Success Story”, and “24. Tartan Day and Our Scottish Origins”.\n\nAs outlined in the first of those blog entries, there is Y-DNA evidence that my ancestor James Bole (1752-1836), of Westmoreland and Armstrong counties, Pennsylvania, was descended from the Kelburn Boyle family. In a book I expect to release in January 2017, I include a lengthy “Origins” chapter that outlines the most likely line of descent of James from the Kelburn family – and beyond.\n\nThe story runs through known Boyle settlers of the Plantation of Ulster under King James I of England (VI of Scotland), back to Boyles of the west coast isles, before coalescing with the ancestry of the Boyle Earls of Glasgow around the year 1495. The book is titled, “The Origins and Descendants of James Bole of Westmoreland and Armstrong Counties, Pennsylvania.”\n\nMeanwhile, if you are a Boyle or Boles, please consider Y-DNA testing! Any male bearing the Bole/Boles/Bowles/Boyle name, of these or other spellings, who is thought to have Irish origins and a Protestant background but whose background is otherwise unknown, has a legitimate shot of descending from the Kelburn family.\n\nYou can obtain further information from the project webpage at http://www.ancestors-genealogy.com/bowles/index.html. Clicking on the “visit this site” link provided there will show the range of tests available. It is strongly recommended that 25 or more genetic markers be tested, as the 12-marker test is not very diagnostic. Besides providing you with evidence bearing on your own origins, your test results will be of considerable benefit to the Bowles DNA Project — even if you know little about your exact ancestry.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Tales From Scottish Lairds (1985).

Monaghan, Ireland (2014). Both books are available for download through Lulu.com. Please press here to access the site.\n\nIn the 1980s, while preparing to write a book on my paternal ancestry, I noticed something curious about my Boles surname. In Pennsylvania records of the 18th century there seemed to be little barrier to the name being alternatively spelled Bole, Boles, Boyle, or Boyles [1].\n\nA little investigation revealed two different causes. First, as surname expert E.C. Smith pointed out:\n\nThe addition of -s as it developed later was doubtless just fashion or force of habit, a friendly but meaningless ending to a name… [10]\n\nThat made some sense. But the second, more interesting cause actually suggested the possible origin of my family. For in writing about the name Boyle, Scottish surname authority G.F. Black noted:\n\nThis Scottish surname . . . is of Norman origin, from Boyville, otherwise Boeville or Beauville, near Caen . . . [David de Boiuil] appears as a witness between 1164-74 . . . In 1291 Henry de Boyville was castellan of the castles of Dumfries, Wigtown, and Kirkcudbright . . . In course of time the pronunciation of the name slipped into one syllable, written in 1362 Boyll, 1367 Boyuil, 1482 Boyle, 1500 Boyl . . . The name is not common anywhere outside of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire, where until recently [publishing in 1946] it was pronounced in common speech as “Bole.” [2]\n\nIn other words the equivalence between “Bole” and “Boyle”, names quite different to the modern ear because they are pronounced “Bowl” and “Boil” respectively, betrayed a possible Scottish origin. In the two counties mentioned, Ayrshire and Wigtownshire, they had historically been pronounced the same.\n\nI was immediately drawn to this explanation of the equivalence between “Bole” and “Boyle” because my immigrant ancestor James Bole (his son William adopted the “s”) was a Presbyterian from Ireland [1]. The Presbyterian religion is well represented in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. I could easily envision an immigration route leading from southwestern Scotland to Northern Ireland to Pennsylvania.\n\nKelburn Castle\n\nTaking my cue from Black’s discussion of the surname, I next investigated the Scottish Boyles. I quickly located records of an extraordinary family seated at Kelburn (or Kelburne) Castle, Ayrshire, two miles SSE of the town of Largs. They were distinguished from nearly all other landed Scottish families by having resided at their castle almost continuously, it was reputed, since about the year 1140. That was an important consideration, because the intervening 800+ years had provided ample time to spin off many descending lines — and Northern Ireland was just a short boat ride away.\n\nAs Black noted, the Scottish surname likely originated as a place name, specifically Boyville in Normandy. It presumably came to the British Isles on the heels of the Norman conquest in 1066. It spread widely throughout England, with one prominent family of Boyvilles taking up residence in co. Cumberland, on the border of Scotland, before 1130 [9]. It is thought to have been imported to Scotland as the result of a project of King David I, who after his accession to the throne in 1124 invited families from the north of England to settle in the lowlands. His intention was to create a garrison to thwart rebellion in the northern reaches of his country [3].\n\nAllegedly the Boyvilles were connected to the Anglo-Norman Hugh de Morville, who was granted much of northern Ayrshire by the king. Under the feudal system, he in turn granted Kelburn to them [4]. There they built a castle, much-altered and supplemented to create the present structure. In fact there is some controversy as to whether any of the original castle remains, but it is thought that the east end may include a portion of an early building [5].\n\nAlthough there are fragmentary mentions of the family at Kelburn in the early centuries — e.g., Richard de Boill in 1329, probably the same Richard listed in Ayrshire in 1296; Richard’s son Robert also in 1296; John Boyle in 1417; Sir Patrick Boil in 1433 — the connected pedigree of the family commences with one Robert Boyle, who had sasine (i.e., a transfer implying that his predecessor had died) of the Kelburn lands in 1456. He was the grandfather of William Boyle, who possessed Kelburn sometime before 1478. From William can be traced the modern family at Kelburn, in unbroken descent [6].\n\nThe great ancestor of the family was David Boyle, elevated to the peerage of Scotland in 1699 as Lord Boyle, of Kelburne, Stewarton, Cumbra, Largs, and Dalry. By patent dated 1703 he was created Baron Boyle of Stewarton, Cumbra, Fenwick, Largs, and Dalry, Viscount Kelburne — and most importantly, Earl of Glasgow. His prominence is attested by his appointment to the king’s Privy Council. He died in 1733, having married twice and having had several children [7]. It is through David that the present family at Kelburn trace their ancestry, and a representative remains the Earl of Glasgow.\n\nIn 2002, with my family I was privileged to enjoy a tour of the castle guided by Lady Isabel Glasgow. Much of the grounds are part of “Kelburn Castle, Country Centre & Estate” (www.kelburnestate.com), a park offering verdant strolls along forest paths and waterways; riding and camping facilities; and play activities for children. In 2007 the estate received international notice when four Brazilian artists were allowed to decorate the oldest portions of the castle (see photo).\n\nDNA Despair\n\nOver the quarter century since I initially suspected a family connection to Kelburn, I doubted I would ever be able to either prove or disprove it. At one point I thought I had covered part of the distance by tracing my Boleses to Clontibret parish, co. Monaghan, Ireland. That apparent discovery, however, quickly fell to ruin when DNA testing revealed that I am genetically unrelated to two descendants of the Clontibret family [11].\n\nDNA testing emerged as a popular genealogical research tool at the beginning of this century. The most-used procedure is to test the Y chromosome in men for a set of genetic markers that can vary in number, most often 25, 37, or 67 markers. If two men have markers that match sufficiently closely, and they share the same surname or variants of a surname, there is a high degree of confidence of relationship. Because the Y chromosome descends only from father to son, the relationship is exclusively through the male (typically the surname) line.\n\nThus it was that having tested, I learned in 2010 that I differed in a number of markers from the two Clontibret descendants [11]. That outcome threw me into a kind of genealogical despair, because I was right back to where I’d been in the 1980s: All I knew was that my immigrant ancestor was an Irish Presbyterian who had come to the country sometime after the mid-1700s [1]. Because many Irish civil records of a genealogical nature had perished in a disastrous fire in 1922, it seemed all I was ever likely to know.\n\nDNA Delight\n\nIn the intervening years, I assumed administration of the Bowles DNA Project from its founder. Despite the title of this project (located at http://www.ancestors-genealogy.com/bowles/index.html), it serves all variations of the surname including Boals, Boales, Boles, Bolles, Bolls, Booles, Boules, Bowles, Bowls, Boyle, Bolds, and others — with or without the friendly ending “s”. The duties are relatively light, consisting mostly of checking the results of new Y-DNA tests for relationships to existing members, inviting new members, and keeping the website up to date. My own test, of course, is entered at the site. Over the years results accreted that led to my categorization under “Group 8”, a set of about a dozen related test results from families appearing to originate in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn mid-February of this year I checked an unusually large backlog of test results. In the most recent batch I found that one new test, of a man named Boyle, matched a number of members of my group. I emailed a routine invitation, advising that the results placed him in Group 8 and asking that he consider joining the project.\n\nAlmost immediately I received an answer. It was from a professional genealogist in Scotland. He indicated that his client, who he was not free to identify,\n\n… has a proven documented ancestry from the Boyle family of Kelburn Castle in Ayrshire, Earls of Glasgow.\n\nTo say I was stunned would be an understatement. With one simple genetic test result, my connection to Kelburn Castle was proved beyond any reasonable doubt. While the genealogist assured me that his client was not of the immediate lineage of the current Earl of Glasgow, he was a descendant of John Boyle (1688-1740), the 2nd Earl of Glasgow.\n\nThe Relationship\n\nOf course I delved into the results as quickly as I could. I concluded that as Group 8 members go, I am not particularly closely related to the castle family. My best guess, based on estimates of mutation rates in the Y-DNA markers and of the average number of years between generations, is that my line converges with theirs about the year 1430. There is of course much imprecision in this estimate. But in any case it highlights the futility of attempting to establish a true genealogical connection: Even the castle family’s connected pedigree only extends back to about that time, and intervening records are few.\n\nOther members of the group may have brighter genealogical prospects. A number appear closely related enough that they may converge with the castle family’s ancestry after 1550. That is well within the timeframe of the established pedigree. It is even possible that some are descendants of known Kelburn Boyles who moved to Ireland. Among them were William Boyle, who in 1614 leased Moyle in the manor of Donboy, precinct of Portlough, co. Donegal, Ireland, and his sons Robert and James; Robert Boyle, of Carrickmacross, co. Monaghan, Ireland, in 1665; and Thomas Boyle, of Tullochdonell, co. Louth, Ireland, in 1680 [6]. There was also a possible branch of the family located at Limavady, co. Londonderry. It descended from a James Boyle who settled at Limavady about 1660. The family used a coat of arms similar to that of the Kelburn family, although the exact genealogical connection if any is unknown [8].\n\nFor me personally, however, knowing there is a genetic connection is plenty enough. It means that I will always have a place in Scotland I can visit with some “pride of ownership”. For the first time I can stroll along its forest paths and waterways knowing, and not just suspecting, that I’m stepping in the footprints of my ancestors. I anticipate a very satisfied feeling.\n\nThe subject of this article is now covered at length in a New Book! Also mentioned in the article is a Boles family of Clontibret parish, co.
