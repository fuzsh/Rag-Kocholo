The National Library of Australia gratefully acknowledges the contribution of the other foundation AJCP partners, the State Library of New South Wales and The National Archives of the UK, and all other organisations which supported the work of the AJCP, the world's most extensive collaborative copying project, operating from 1948 to 1997.\n\nIntroduction\n\nScope and Contents\n\n1. Papers 1892-1901 covering the 7th Earl of Glasgow's term as Governor of New Zealand, including correspondence, addresses, cuttings, photographs and scrapbooks. Correspondents include Lord Glasgow, Richard Seddon and Lord Ranfurly.\n\n2. Papers of Robert Elphinstone Boyle, including letters from his brother Lord Glasgow and nephew Lord Kelburn in New Zealand and Samoa.\n\nConditions Governing Access\n\nAvailable for Access.\n\nConditions Governing Use\n\nMany of the records digitised as part of the AJCP are still in copyright. Readers wishing to publish or reproduce documents should seek permission, in the first instance, from the owner of the original material.\n\nPreferred Citation\n\nAcknowledgement of use of this material should refer to the location of the original material and to the Australian Joint Copying Project. Items from this collection should include references to the location of the original material and to the AJCP nla.obj number, which serves as the online identifier for the digital copy.\n\nFor example:- M Series: Journal of Capt. James Cook, 18 February-23 September 1770, British Library Add. MS 27885 (AJCP ref: http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-987654321)\n\nArchival History\n\nMaterial selectively filmed at the private residence of Rt Hon. the Earl of Glasgow, Scotland, as part of the Australian Joint Copying Project, 1991 (AJCP Reels: M2634-M2635).

The original AJCP finding aids were unpublished typescripts or photocopies available from libraries that held copies of the original microfilm.\n\nDates used in this finding aid refer to the date range of the records selected for filming rather than to the date range of the Series or Files.\n\nAdvisory Statement\n\nMaori and Pacific Islander people are advised that this Finding Aid contains material and descriptive information which may be considered culturally sensitive and may cause distress, including names and images of people now deceased. This Finding Aid contains terms that reflect authors' views or those of the historical period, but which may not be considered appropriate today. While the information may not reflect current understanding, it is provided in an historical context.\n\nSubjects\n\nBoyle Family; Boyle, Patrick J., 8th Earl Glasgow; Boyle, Robert E.; Boyle, Sir David, 7th Earl Glasgow; Governors and Governors General: New Zealand; Knox, Uchter J., 5th Earl of Ranfurly; New Zealand: politics and government; New Zealand: Photographs; Photographs; Samoa; Seddon, Richard\n\nBibliography"
