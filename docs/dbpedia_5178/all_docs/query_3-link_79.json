South Dildo\n20. Flat Rock Reprise\n\nAll tracks are live improvisations by Curtis Andrews and Patrick Boyle, captured by Don Ellis at Fat Tracks on July 2nd and 3rd, 2007 in St. John&#39;s, NL. At times, the pieces were inspired by the unique place names of Newfoundland and Labrador, other times the improvisation attached itself to a location...for one reason or another. We don&#39;t know why. Thanks to our families, loved ones, plants and animals past and present.\r\n\r\nDEDICATED TO ED BLACKWELL AND DON CHERRY",
