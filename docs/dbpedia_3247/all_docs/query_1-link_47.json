        "text": "Solid-phase extraction sorbent consisting of alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants immobilized onto strong cation-exchange polystyrene resin.\n\nPubMed\n\nReid, Kendra R; Kennedy, Lonnie J; Crick, Eric W; Conte, Eric D\n\n2002-10-25\n\nPresented is a solid-phase extraction sorbent material composed of cationic alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants attached to a strong cation-exchange resin via ion-exchange. The original hydrophilic cation-exchange resin is made hydrophobic by covering the surface with alkyl chains from the hydrophobic portion of the surfactant. The sorbent material now has a better ability to extract hydrophobic molecules from aqueous samples. The entire stationary phase (alkyltrimethylammonium surfactant) is removed along with the analyte during the elution step. The elution step requires a mild elution solvent consisting of 0.25 M Mg2+ in a 50% 2-propanol solution. The main advantage of using a removable stationary phase is that traditionally utilized toxic elution solvents such as methylene chloride, which are necessary to efficiently release strongly hydrophobic species from SPE stationary phases, may now be avoided. Also, the final extract is directly compatible with reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The performance of this procedure is presented using pyrene as a test molecule.\n\nTwo-dimensional solid-phase extraction strategy for the selective enrichment of aminoglycosides in milk.\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, Aijin; Wei, Jie; Yan, Jingyu; Jin, Gaowa; Ding, Junjie; Yang, Bingcheng; Guo, Zhimou; Zhang, Feifang; Liang, Xinmiao\n\n2017-03-01\n\nAn orthogonal two-dimensional solid-phase extraction strategy was established for the selective enrichment of three aminoglycosides including spectinomycin, streptomycin, and dihydrostreptomycin in milk. A reversed-phase liquid chromatography material (C 18 ) and a weak cation-exchange material (TGA) were integrated in a single solid-phase extraction cartridge. The feasibility of two-dimensional clean-up procedure that experienced two-step adsorption, two-step rinsing, and two-step elution was systematically investigated. Based on the orthogonality of reversed-phase and weak cation-exchange procedures, the two-dimensional solid-phase extraction strategy could minimize the interference from the hydrophobic matrix existing in traditional reversed-phase solid-phase extraction. In addition, high ionic strength in the extracts could be effectively removed before the second dimension of weak cation-exchange solid-phase extraction. Combined with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, the optimized procedure was validated according to the European Union Commission directive 2002/657/EC. A good performance was achieved in terms of linearity, recovery, precision, decision limit, and detection capability in milk. Finally, the optimized two-dimensional clean-up procedure incorporated with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was successfully applied to the rapid monitoring of aminoglycoside residues in milk.

This work devotes on the development of solid-phase extraction method using silica- and polymer-based SCX (strong cation-exchange) and MCX (mixed-mode strong cation-exchange) cartridges for N,N-dialkylaminoethane-2-ols and alkyl N,N-diethanolamines, from water. The extracted analytes were analyzed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) in the full scan and selected ion monitoring modes. The extraction efficiencies of SCX and MCX cartridges were compared, and results revealed that SCX performed better. Extraction parameters, such as loading capacity, extraction solvent, its volume, and washing solvent were optimized. Best recoveries were obtained using 2 mL methanol containing 10% NH(4)OH and limits of detection could be achieved up to 5 x 10(-3) microg mL(-1) in the selected ion monitoring mode and 0.01 microg mL(-1) in full scan mode. The method was successfully employed for the detection and identification of amino alcohol present in water sample sent by Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the official proficiency tests. The method was also applied to extract the analytes from human plasma. The SCX cartridge showed good recoveries of amino alcohols from human plasma after protein precipitation.\n\nSolid phase extraction of copper(II) by fixed bed procedure on cation exchange complexing resins.\n\nPubMed\n\nPesavento, Maria; Sturini, Michela; D'Agostino, Girolamo; Biesuz, Raffaela\n\n2010-02-19\n\nThe efficiency of the metal ion recovery by solid phase extraction (SPE) in complexing resins columns is predicted by a simple model based on two parameters reflecting the sorption equilibria and kinetics of the metal ion on the considered resin. The parameter related to the adsorption equilibria was evaluated by the Gibbs-Donnan model, and that related to the kinetics by assuming that the ion exchange is the adsorption rate determining step. The predicted parameters make it possible to evaluate the breakthrough volume of the considered metal ion, Cu(II), from different kinds of complexing resins, and at different conditions, such as acidity and ionic composition.

This study was aimed to develop extraction and derivatization of aminoalcohols of CWC relevance by using magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction (MDSPE) in combination with on-resin derivatization (ORD). For this purpose, sulfonated magnetic cation-exchange resins (SMRs) were prepared using magnetite nanoparticles as core, styrene and divinylbenzene as polymer coat and sulfonic acid as acidic cation exchanger. SMRs were successfully employed as extractant for targeted basic analytes. Adsorbed analytes were derivatized with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) on the surface of extractant. Derivatized (silylated) compounds were analyzed by GC-MS in SIM and full scan mode. The linearity of the method ranged from 5 to 200ngmL(-1). The LOD and LOQ ranged from 2 to 6ngmL(-1) and 5 to 19ngmL(-1) respectively. The relative standard deviation for intra-day repeatability and inter-day intermediate precision ranged from 5.1% to 6.6% and 0.2% to 7.6% respectively. Recoveries of analytes from spiked water samples from different sources varied from 28.4% to 89.3%. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The advantages gained by the atomic spectroscopies come with the disadvantage of expensive and often complicated instrumentation. Solid-phase spectroscopy, in which the analyte is preconcentrated on a solid medium followed by conventional spectrophotometry or fluorometry, requires less expensive instrumentation and has considerable sensitivity and selectivity. The sensitivity gains come from preconcentration and the use of chromophore (or fluorophore) developers and the selectivity is achieved by use of ion exchange conditions that favor the analyte in combination with speciative chromophores. Little work has been done to optimize the ion exchange medium (IEM) associated with these techniques. In this report we present a method for making ion exchange polymer films, which considerably simplify the solid-phase spectroscopic techniques. The polymer consists of formaldehyde-crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol with polyacrylic acid entrapped therein. The films are a carboxylate weak cation exchanger in the calcium form. They are mechanically sturdy and optically transparent in the ultraviolet and visible portion of the spectrum, which makes them suitable for spectrophotometry and fluorometry.\n\nSolid cation exchange phase to remove interfering anthocyanins in the analysis of other bioactive phenols in red wine.\n\nPubMed\n\nda Silva, LetÃ­cia Flores; Guerra, Celito Crivellaro; Klein, Diandra; Bergold, Ana Maria\n\n2017-07-15\n\nBioactive phenols (BPs) are often targets in red wine analysis. However, other compounds interfere in the liquid chromatography methods used for this analysis. Here, purification procedures were tested to eliminate anthocyanin interference during the determination of 19 red-wine BPs. Liquid chromatography, coupled to a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and a mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS), was used to compare the direct injection of the samples with solid-phase extractions: reversed-phase (C18) and strong cation-exchange (SCX). The HPLC-DAD method revealed that, out of 13BPs, only six are selectively analyzed with or without C18 treatment, whereas SCX enabled the detection of all BPs. The recovery with SCX was above 86.6% for eight BPs. Moreover, UPLC-MS demonstrated the potential of SCX sample preparation for the determination of 19BPs. The developed procedure may be extended to the analysis of other red wine molecules or to other analytical methods where anthocyanins may interfere. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Though both grafted and impregnated forms of solid phase extraction resins are popular, the later is easy to make by impregnating a given organic extractant on to an inert solid support. Solid phase extraction on an impregnated support, also known as extraction chromatography, combines the advantages of liquid-liquid extraction and the ion exchange chromatography methods. On the flip side, the impregnated extraction chromatographic resins are less stable against leaching out of the organic extractant from the pores of the support material. Grafted resins, on the other hand, have a higher stability, which allows their prolong use. The goal of this article is a brief literature review on reported actinide and lanthanide separation methods based on solid phase extractants of both the types, i.e., (i) ligand impregnation on the solid support or (ii) ligand functionalized polymers (chemically bonded resins). Though the literature survey reveals an enormous volume of studies on the extraction chromatographic separation of actinides and lanthanides using several extractants, the focus of the present article is limited to the work carried out with amide based ligands, viz. monoamides, diamides and diglycolamides. The emphasis will be on reported applied experimental results rather than on data pertaining fundamental metal complexation. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

An improved method to lower the detection limit of this hyphenated technique is described in this present study. Activated carbon powder is used as both the SPE adsorbent and the SALDI solid in the analysis by SPE-SALDI. The surface of the activated carbon is modified by passing an aqueous solution of a cationic surfactant through the SPE cartridge. The results demonstrate that the sensitivity for nitrophenols in the analysis by SPE-SALDI can be improved by using cationic surfactants to modify the surface of the activated carbon. The detection limit for nitrophenols is about 25 ppt based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 by sampling from 100 mL of solution.

In CSPE, analytes are extracted and complexed on the surface of an extraction membrane impregnated with a colorimetric reagent. The analytes are then quantified directly on the membrane surface using a handheld diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer. Importantly, the use of solid-phase extraction membranes as the matrix for impregnation of the colorimetric reagents creates a concentration factor that enables the detection of low concentrations of analytes in small sample volumes. In extending C-SPE to a multiplexed format, a filter holder that incorporates discrete analysis channels and a jig that facilitates the concurrent operation of multiple sample syringes have been designed, enabling the simultaneous determination of multiple analytes. Separate, single analyte membranes, placed in a readout cartridge create unique, analyte-specific addresses at the exit of each channel. Following sample exposure, the diffuse reflectance spectrum of each address is collected serially and the Kubelka-Munk function is used to quantify each water quality parameter via calibration curves. In a demonstration, MC-SPE was used to measure the pH of a sample and quantitate Ag(I) and Ni(II).\n\nSemiautomated solid-phase extraction manifold with a solvent-level sensor.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrlando, R M; Rath, S; Rohwedder, J J R\n\n2013-11-15\n\nA semiautomated solid-phase extraction manifold for multiple extractions is presented. The manifold utilizes commercial solid-phase syringe cartridges and automatically introduces and elutes all the solvents during the extraction, reducing the typical workload and stress of the analyst. The manifold consists of a peristaltic pump with solenoid valves in a flow circuit that contains transmissive photomicrosensors. The photomicrosensors were used to control the solvent dispenser and the solvent level inside the cartridge. As solvent-level sensors, the photomicrosensors determined the exact time the solvent reached the top frit to avoid sorbent drying and accurately perform the solvent exchange. The repeatability of the manifold to introduce a particular volume of solvent into the cartridges was measured, and the precisions were between 0.05 and 2.89% (RSD). To evaluate the manifold, the amount of two fluoroquinolones in a fortified blank milk sample was determined. The results of the intra- and inter-day precision of multiple extractions from the fortified milk samples resulted in precisions better than 9.0% (RSD) and confirmed that the arrangement of the semiautomated manifold could adequately be used in solid-phase extraction with commercial cartridges.

We describe this methodology for the first time: it involves the application of solid phase extraction (SPE-for sample preparation) coupled with ion chromatography-conductivity detection (IC-CD-for the final determination). Mean recoveries of analytes between 79% and 93%, and overall method quantification limits in the range from 0.0018 to 0.038 Î¼g/mL for surface water and CRM samples were achieved. The methodology was applied to the determination of individual alkyl benzyl quaternary ammonium compounds in environmental samples (reservoir water) and enables their presence in such types of waters to be confirmed. In addition, it is a simpler, less time-consuming, labour-intensive, avoiding use of toxic chloroform and significantly less expensive methodology than previously described approaches (liquid-liquid extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry).

The resulting hybrid materials (SBA-15-C18-SO 3 - and SBA-15-C8-SO 3 - ) were comprehensively characterized. They showed high surface area, high pore volume and controlled porous size. Elemental analysis of the materials revealed differences in the amount of C18 and C8. SBA-15-C18-SO 3 - contained 0.19mmol/g of C18, while SBA-15-C8-SO 3 - presented 0.54mmol/g of C8. The SO 3 - groups anchored to the silica surface of the pore walls were 0.20 and 0.09mmol/g, respectively. The bi-functionalized materials were evaluated as SPE sorbents for the multi-residue extraction of 26 veterinary drug residues in meat samples using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detector (UHPLC-MS/MS). Different sorbent amounts (100 and 200mg) and organic solvents were tested to optimize the extraction procedure. Both silicas showed big extraction potential and were successful in the extraction of the target analytes. The mixed-mode retention mechanism was confirmed by comparing both silicas with SBA-15 mesoporous silica mono-functionalized with C18 and C8. Best results were achieved with 200mg of SBA-15-C18-SO 3 - obtaining recoveries higher than 70% for the majority of analytes. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Combining hydrogen-bonding, cation-exchange and Van der Waals interactions\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMills, M.S.; Thurman, E.M.; Pedersen, M.J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nSilica- and styrene-divinylbenzene-based mixed-mode resins that contain C8, C18 and sulphonated cation-exchange groups were compared for their efficiency in isolation of neutral triazine compounds from water and of the basic drug, benzoylecgonine, from urine. The triazine compounds were isolated by a combination of Van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions, and benzoylecgonine was isolated by Van der Waals interactions and cation exchange. All analytes were eluted with a polar organic solvent contaning 2% ammonium hydroxide. Larger recoveries (95%) were achieved on copolymerized mixed-mode resins where C18 and sulfonic acid are in closer proximity than on 'blended' mixed-mode resins (60-70% recovery).\n\nMeasurement of thyroxine and its glucuronide in municipal wastewater and solids using weak anion exchange solid phase extraction and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrown, Alistair K; Wong, Charles S\n\n2017-11-24\n\nA solids extraction method, using sonication in combination with weak anion exchange solid phase extraction, was created to extract thyroxine (T4) and thyroxine-O-Î²-d-glucuronide (T4-Glc) simultaneously from wastewaters and sludges, and to quantify these compounds via reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method limits of quantification were all in the low ng/g (dry weight solids) range for both T4 and T4-Glc: 2.13 and 2.63ng/g respectively in primary wastewater, 4.3 and 28.3ng/g for primary suspended solids, for 1.1 and 3.7ng/g for return activated sludge. Precision for measurements of T4 and T4-Glc were 2.6 and 6.5% (intraday) and 9.6 and 5.7% (interday) respectively, while linearity was 0.9967 and 0.9943 respectively. Overall recoveries for T4 and T4-Glc in primary suspended solids were 94% and 95%, and 86 and 101% in primary wastewater, respectively. Extraction efficiency tests using primary sludge determined that one methanol aliquot was sufficient during the extraction process as opposed to 2 or 3 aliquots. Mass loadings at the North Main Wastewater Treatment Plant in Winnipeg, Canada showed 316%, 714%, and 714% greater T4-Glc than T4 associated with the suspended solids of the primary, secondary, and final effluent respectively, yet 765% more T4 than T4-Glc associated with the solids of the mixed liquor. Moreover, 26% of T4 and 49% of T4-Glc were associated with the suspended solids during the treatment process. This method demonstrates the need to assess accurately both metabolite conjugates of contaminants of emerging concern, as well as the sorbed levels of particle-reactive analytes such as T4 in the aquatic environment.

Results showed that the accuracy of exchangeable base cation data with AAS method fits well with the national standard referential soil data. The relative errors for parallel samples of exchangeable Ca and Mg with 66 pair samples ranged from 0.02%-3.14% and 0.06%-4.06%, and averaged to be 1.22% and 1.25%, respectively. The relative errors for exchangeable K and Na with AAS and flame photometer (FP) ranged from 0.06%-8.39% and 0.06-1.54, and averaged to be 3.72% and 0.56%, respectively. A case study showed that the determination method for exchangeable base cations by using AAS was proven to be reliable and trustable, which could reflect the real situation of soil cation exchange properties in farmlands.\n\nFabrication of a novel hydrophobic/ion-exchange mixed-mode adsorbent for the dispersive solid-phase extraction of chlorophenols from environmental water samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Li; Wei, Yinmao\n\n2016-08-01\n\nA novel mixed-mode adsorbent was prepared by functionalizing silica with tris(2-aminoethyl)amine and 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde as the main mixed-mode scaffold due to the presence of the plentiful amino groups and benzene rings in their molecules. The adsorption mechanism was probed with acidic, natural and basic compounds, and the mixed hydrophobic and ion-exchange interactions were found to be responsible for the adsorption of analytes. The suitability of dispersive solid-phase extraction was demonstrated in the determination of chlorophenols in environmental water. Several parameters, including sample pH, desorption solvent, ionic strength, adsorbent dose, and extraction time were optimized. Under the optimal extraction conditions, the proposed dispersive solid-phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography showed good linearity range and acceptable limits of detection (0.22â½0.54 ng/mL) for five chlorophenols. Notably, the higher extraction recoveries (88.7â½109.7%) for five chlorophenols were obtained with smaller adsorbent dose (10 mg) and shorter extraction time (15 min) compared with the reported methods. The proposed method might be potentially applied in the determination of trace chlorophenols in real water samples. Â© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Dilution of urine samples with phosphate buffer for pH adjustment and SPE on weak cation exchange microelution plates was tested as a means to increase throughput of this analysis. Dilution using 200âmM phosphate buffer provides good buffering capacity without affecting the peptides recoveries. SPE on microelution plates was performed on Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor with subsequent evaporation of eluates in nitrogen flow. Though the use of smaller sample volume decreases the pre-concentration factor and increases the limits of detection of 5 out of 17 detected peptides, the recovery, linearity, and reproducibility of the microelution extraction were comparable with cartridge SPE. The effectiveness of protocols was confirmed by analysis of urine samples containing ipamorelin, and GHRP-6 and its metabolites. SPE after urine sample dilution with buffer can be used for faster sample preparation. The use of microelution plates decreases consumption of solvents and allows processing of up to 96 samples simultaneously. Cartridge SPE with manual ÑÐ adjustment remains the best option for confirmation. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The ES-SPME was prepared by the doping of eriochrome blue in polypyrrole (PPy-ECB) and used for selectively extracting the Ni(II) cation in the presence of some transition and heavy metal ions. The cation-exchange behavior of electrochemically prepared polypyrrole on stainless-steel with and without eriochrome blue (ECB) dye was characterized using ICP-OES analysis. The effects of the scan rate for electrochemical synthesis, uptake and the release potential on the extraction behavior of the PPy-ECB conductive fiber were studied. Uptake and release time profiles show that the process of electrically switched cation exchange could be completed within 250 s. The results of the present study point concerning the possibility of developing a selective extraction process for Ni(II) from waste water was explored using such a nanostructured PPy-ECB film through an electrically switched cation exchange. 2012 Â© The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry\n\nSolid Phase Luminescence of Several Rare Earth Ions on Ion-Exchange Films\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTanner, Stephen P.; Street, Kenneth W., Jr.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe development and characterization of a novel ion-exchange film for solid-phase fluorometry and phosphorimetry is reported. This new cation-exchange material is suitable for spectroscopic applications in the ultraviolet and visible regions. It is advantageous because it, as a single entity, is easily recovered from solution and mounted in the spectrofluorometers. After preconcentration on the film, the luminescence intensity of lanthanide ions is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the corresponding solution, depending on the volume of solution and the amount of film. This procedure allows emission spectral measurements and determination of lanthanide ions at solution concentrations of < 5 (micro)g/L. The film may be stored for subsequent reuse or as a permanent record of the analysis. The major drawback to the use of the film is slow uptake of analyte due to diffusion limitations.\n\nHigh-capacity cation-exchange column for enhanced resolution of adjacent peaks of cations in ion chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nRey, M A\n\n2001-06-22\n\nOne of the advantages of ion chromatography [Anal Chem. 47 (1975) 1801] as compared to other analytical techniques is that several ions may be analyzed simultaneously. One of the most important contributions of cation-exchange chromatography is its sensitivity to ammonium ion, which is difficult to analyze by other techniques [J. Weiss, in: E.L. Johnson (Ed.), Handbook of Ion Chromatography, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA]. The determination of low concentrations of ammonium ion in the presence of high concentrations of sodium poses a challenge in cation-exchange chromatography [J. Weiss, Ion Chromatography, VCH, 2nd Edition, Weinheim, 1995], as both cations have similar selectivities for the common stationary phases containing either sulfonate or carboxylate functional groups. The task was to develop a new cation-exchange stationary phase (for diverse concentration ratios of adjacent peaks) to overcome limitations experienced in previous trails. Various cation-exchange capacities and column body formats were investigated to optimize this application and others. The advantages and disadvantages of two carboxylic acid columns of different cation-exchange capacities and different column formats will be discussed.\n\nSimultaneous determination of cations, zwitterions and neutral compounds using mixed-mode reversed-phase and cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jingyi; Shao, Shan; Jaworsky, Markian S; Kurtulik, Paul T\n\n2008-03-28\n\nA novel mixed-mode reversed-phase and cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method is described to simultaneously determine four related impurities of cations, zwitterions and neutral compounds in developmental Drug A. The commercial column is Primesep 200 containing hydrophobic alkyl chains with embedded acidic groups in H(+) form on a silica support. The mobile phase variables of acid additives, contents of acetonitrile and concentrations of potassium chloride have been thoroughly investigated to optimize the separation. The retention factors as a function of the concentrations of potassium chloride and the percentages of acetonitrile in the mobile phases are investigated to get an insight into the retention and separation mechanisms of each related impurity and Drug A. Furthermore, the elution orders of the related impurities and Drug A in an ion-pair chromatography (IPC) are compared to those in the mixed-mode HPLC to further understand the chromatographic retention behaviors of each related impurity and Drug A. The study found that the positively charged Degradant 1, Degradant 2 and Drug A were retained by both ion-exchange and reversed-phase partitioning mechanisms. RI2, a small ionic compound, was primarily retained by ion-exchange. RI4, a neutral compound, was retained through reversed-phase partitioning without ion-exchange. Moreover, the method performance characteristics of selectivity, sensitivity and accuracy have been demonstrated to be suitable to determine the related impurities in the capsules of Drug A.\n\nAutomated solid-phase extraction of phenolic acids using layered double hydroxide-alumina-polymer disks.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhani, Milad; Palomino Cabello, Carlos; Saraji, Mohammad; Manuel Estela, Jose; CerdÃ , VÃ­ctor; Turnes Palomino, Gemma; Maya, Fernando\n\n2018-01-26\n\nThe application of layered double hydroxide-Al 2 O 3 -polymer mixed-matrix disks for solid-phase extraction is reported for the first time. Al 2 O 3 is embedded in a polymer matrix followed by an in situ metal-exchange process to obtain a layered double hydroxide-Al 2 O 3 -polymer mixed-matrix disk with excellent flow-through properties. The extraction performance of the prepared disks is evaluated as a proof of concept for the automated extraction using sequential injection analysis of organic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, gallic acid) following an anion-exchange mechanism. After the solid-phase extraction, phenolic acids were quantified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection using a core-shell silica-C18 stationary phase and isocratic elution (acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid in pure water, 5:95, v/v). High sensitivity and reproducibility were obtained with limits of detection in the range of 0.12-0.25Â Î¼g/L (sample volume, 4Â mL), and relative standard deviations between 2.9 and 3.4% (10Â Î¼g/L, nÂ =Â 6). Enrichment factors of 34-39 were obtained. Layered double hydroxide-Al 2 O 3 -polymer mixed-matrix disks had an average lifetime of 50 extractions. Analyte recoveries ranged from 93 to 96% for grape juice and nonalcoholic beer samples. Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The columns were evaluated by SEM and characterized with regard to the separation of diastereomers and Î±/Î²-isomers of aspartyl peptides. Column preparation was reproducible as evidenced by comparison of the analyte retention times of several columns prepared simultaneously. Analyte separation was achieved using mobile phases consisting of acidic phosphate buffer and ACN. Under these conditions the peptides migrated due to their electrophoretic mobility but the EOF also contributed as driving force as a function of the pH of the mobile phase due to increasing dissociation of the carboxyl groups of the polymer. Raising the pH of the mobile phase also resulted in deprotonation of the peptides reducing analyte mobility. Due to these mechanisms each pair of diastereomeric peptides displayed the highest resolution at a different pH of the buffer component of the mobile phase. Comparing the weak-cation exchange monolith to an RP monolith and a strong cation-exchange monolith different elution order of some peptide diastereomers was observed, clearly illustrating that interactions with the stationary phase contribute to the CEC separations.

Aviation turbine fuels.\n\nPubMed\n\nLavine, B K; Brzozowski, D M; Ritter, J; Moores, A J; Mayfield, H T\n\n2001-12-01\n\nThe water-soluble fraction of aviation jet fuels is examined using solid-phase extraction and solid-phase microextraction. Gas chromatographic profiles of solid-phase extracts and solid-phase microextracts of the water-soluble fraction of kerosene- and nonkerosene-based jet fuels reveal that each jet fuel possesses a unique profile. Pattern recognition analysis reveals fingerprint patterns within the data characteristic of fuel type. By using a novel genetic algorithm (GA) that emulates human pattern recognition through machine learning, it is possible to identify features characteristic of the chromatographic profile of each fuel class. The pattern recognition GA identifies a set of features that optimize the separation of the fuel classes in a plot of the two largest principal components of the data. Because principal components maximize variance, the bulk of the information encoded by the selected features is primarily about the differences between the fuel classes.\n\nDouble-disk solid-phase extraction--Simultaneous cleanup and trace enrichment of herbicides and metabolites from environmental samples\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFerrar, Imma; BarcelÃ³, DamiÃ ; Thurman, E.M.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nPhenylurea and triazine herbicides, including some metabolites, were isolated from water and soil extracts by solid-phase extraction using a layered system of two extraction disks, a method called double-disk solid-phase extraction. The first disk consisted of strong anion exchange (SAX) of 10-Î¼m styrene divinylbenzene (SDB) particles embedded in Teflon, and the second disk was a C18 disk of 10-Î¼m particles also embedded in Teflon. A volume of 500 mL of water or aqueous soil extract is passed through the layered system with the SAX disk first. The purpose of the SAX disk is to remove the humic and fulvic acids from the water or aqueous soil extract by ion exchange through their carboxyl groups. Even during methanol elution of herbicides, the humic substances remain bound to the SAX disk with >85% retention. Elution with methanol results in more than 90% recovery of the herbicides from the layered extraction disks. Removal of the humic and fulvic acids results in greater sensitivity for diode array detection quantitation (0.05 Î¼g/L for herbicides) by substantially reducing the absorbance of the humic peak on the LC chromatogram. The herbicides adsorb to the SAX disk either through hydrogen bonding to the anion-exchange sites or by hydrophobic interaction with the SDB surface of the anion-exchange disk. The method was tested for the analysis of natural water samples from the Mississippi Embayment, a cotton-growing area of the southeastern United States.\n\n[Study on solid phase extraction spectrophotometric determination of zinc with 2-(2-quinolylazo)-5-dimthylaminophenol].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Shi-ping; Duan, Chang-qun; Liu, Hong-cheng; Hu, Qiu-fen\n\n2005-10-01\n\nA highly sensitive, selective and rapid method for the determination of zinc based on the rapid reaction of zinc(II) with 2-(2-quinolylazo)-5-dimthylaminophenol (QADMAP) and the solid phase extraction of zinc ion with anion exchange resin cartridge was developed. In the presence of pH 8.5 buffer solution and Triton X-100 medium, QADMAP can react with zinc(II) to form a stable 2 :1 complex (QADMAP:Zn(II)). The molar absorptivity is 1.22 x 10(5)L x moL(-1) x cm(-1) at 590 nm. Beer's law is obeyed in the range of 0-1.0 microg x mL(-1). The zinc ions in the samples can be enriched and separated by solid phase extraction with anion exchange resincartridge. Testing results show that recovery for zinc(II) was from 95% to 104%, and RSD was below 3%. This method was applied to the determination of zinc in water and food with good results.\n\nDevelopment and validation of a UHPLC-MS/MS assay for colistin methanesulphonate (CMS) and colistin in human plasma and urine using weak-cation exchange solid-phase extraction.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Miao; Wu, Xiao-Jie; Fan, Ya-Xin; Guo, Bei-Ning; Zhang, Jing\n\n2016-05-30\n\nA rapid ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) assay method was developed for determination of CMS and formed colistin in human plasma and urine. After extraction on a 96-well SPE Supra-Clean Weak Cation Exchange (WCX) plate, the eluents were mixed and injected into the UHPLC-MS/MS system directly. A Phonomenex Kinetex XB-C18 analytical column was employed with a mobile phase consisting of solution \"A\" (acetonitrile:methanol, 1:1, v/v) and solution \"B\" (0.1% formic acid in water, v/v). The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min with gradient elution over 3.5 min. Ions were detected in ESI positive ion mode and the precursor-product ion pairs were m/z 390.7/101.3 for colistin A, m/z 386.0/101.2 for colistin B, and m/z 402.3/101.2 for polymyxin B1 (IS), respectively. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.0130 and 0.0251 mg/L for colistin A and colistin B in both plasma and urine with accuracy (relative error, %) <Â± 12.6% and precision (relative standard deviation, %) <Â± 10.8%. Stability of CMS was demonstrated in biological samples before and during sample treatment, and in the extract. This new analytical method provides high-throughput treatment and optimized quantification of CMS and colistin, which offers a highly efficient tool for the analysis of a large number of clinical samples as well as routine therapeutic drug monitoring.

This method was compared with a more conventional analytical method previously developed that combines solid liquid extraction (SL) to simultaneously extract phenolic compounds and organic acids followed by a solid-phase extraction (SPE) to separate the two types of compounds. Although the results were qualitatively similar for both techniques, the levels of extracted compounds were in general quite lower on using MSPD, especially for organic acids. Therefore, SL-SPE method was preferred to analyse white \"Vinho Verde\" grapes. Twenty samples of 10 different varieties (Alvarinho, Avesso, Asal-Branco, Batoca, Douradinha, Esganoso de Castelo Paiva, Loureiro, PedernÃ£, Rabigato and Trajadura) from four different locations in Minho (Portugal) were analysed in order to study the effects of variety and origin on the profile of the above mentioned compounds. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied separately to establish the main sources of variability present in the data sets for phenolic compounds, organic acids and for the global data. PCA of phenolic compounds accounted for the highest variability (77.9%) with two PCs, enabling characterization of the varieties of samples according to their higher content in flavonol derivatives or epicatechin. Additionally, a strong effect of sample origin was observed. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) was used for differentiation of grapes according to the origin and variety, resulting in a correct classification of 100 and 70%, respectively.\n\nCation Exchange in the Presence of Oil in Porous Media\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCation exchange is an interfacial process during which cations on a clay surface are replaced by other cations. This study investigates the effect of oil type and composition on cation exchange on rock surfaces, relevant for a variety of oil-recovery processes. We perform experiments in which brine with a different composition than that of the in situ brine is injected into cores with and without remaining oil saturation. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of the rocks was calculated using PHREEQC software (coupled to a multipurpose transport simulator) with the ionic composition of the effluent histories as input parameters. We observe that in the presence of crude oil, ion exchange is a kinetically controlled process and its rate depends on residence time of the oil in the pore, the temperature, and kinetic rate of adsorption of the polar groups on the rock surface. The cation-exchange process occurs in two stages during two phase flow in porous media. Initially, the charged sites of the internal surface of the clays establish a new equilibrium by exchanging cations with the aqueous phase. At later stages, the components of the aqueous and oleic phases compete for the charged sites on the external surface or edges of the clays. When there is sufficient time for crude oil to interact with the rock (i.e., when the core is aged with crude oil), a fraction of the charged sites are neutralized by the charged components stemming from crude oil. Moreover, the positively charged calcite and dolomite surfaces (at the prevailing pH environment of our experiments) are covered with the negatively charged components of the crude oil and therefore less mineral dissolution takes place when oil is present in porous media.

This is a model system in several aspects: first, the +2 and +4 oxidation states for tin are relatively stable; in addition, the phase of the Cu2-xSe NCs remains cubic regardless of the degree of copper deficiency (that is, âxâ) in the NC lattice. Also, Sn4+ ions are comparable in size to the Cu+ ions, while Sn2+ ones are much larger. We show here that the valency of the entering Sn ions dictates the structure and composition not only of the final products but also of the intermediate steps of the exchange. When Sn4+ cations are used, alloyed Cu2â4ySnySe NCs (with y â¤ 0.33) are formed as intermediates, with almost no distortion of the anion framework, apart from a small contraction. In this exchange reaction the final stoichiometry of the NCs cannot go beyond Cu0.66Sn0.33Se (that is Cu2SnSe3), as any further replacement of Cu+ cations with Sn4+ cations would require a drastic reorganization of the anion framework, which is not possible at the reaction conditions of the experiments. When instead Sn2+ cations are employed, SnSe NCs are formed, mostly in the orthorhombic phase, with significant, albeit not drastic, distortion of the anion framework. Intermediate steps in this exchange reaction are represented by Janus-type Cu2-xSe/SnSe heterostructures, with no CuâSnâSe alloys.

By means of ultrasonic extraction in combination with a strong anion-exchange solid-phase extraction (SAE-SPE) technique, the filtration, isolation, and determination of CrVI in the presence of trivalent chromium (CrIII) and potential interferents was achieved. The method entails (1) ultrasonication in basic ammonium buffer solution to extract CrVI from environmental matrixes; (2) SAE-SPE to separate CrVI from CrIII and interferences; (3) elution/acidification of the eluate; (4) complexation of chromium with 1,5-diphenylcarbazide; and (5) spectrophotometric determination of the colored chromium-diphenylcarbazone complex. Several critical parameters were optimized in order to effect the extraction of both soluble (K2CrO4) and insoluble (PbCrO4) forms of CrVI without inducing CrIII oxidation or CrVI reduction. The method allowed for the dissolution and purification of CrVI from environmental and workplace air sample matrixes for up to 24 samples simultaneously in less than 90 min (including ultrasonication). The results demonstrated that the method was simple, fast, quantitative, and sufficiently sensitive for the determination of occupational exposures of CrVI. The method is applicable for on-site monitoring of CrVI in environmental and industrial hygiene samples.\n\nMixed hemimicelles solid-phase extraction based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-coated nano-magnets for selective adsorption and enrichment of illegal cationic dyes in food matrices prior to high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection detection.\n\nPubMed\n\nQi, Ping; Liang, Zhi-An; Wang, Yu; Xiao, Jian; Liu, Jia; Zhou, Qing-Qiong; Zheng, Chun-Hao; Luo, Li-Ni; Lin, Zi-Hao; Zhu, Fang; Zhang, Xue-Wu\n\n2016-03-11\n\nIn this study, mixed hemimicelles solid-phase extraction (MHSPE) based on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) coated nano-magnets Fe3O4 was investigated as a novel method for the extraction and separation of four banned cationic dyes, Auramine O, Rhodamine B, Basic orange 21 and Basic orange 22, in condiments prior to HPLC detection. The main factors affecting the extraction of analysts, such as pH, surfactant and adsorbent concentrations and zeta potential were studied and optimized. Under optimized conditions, the proposed method was successful applied for the analysis of banned cationic dyes in food samples such as chili sauce, soybean paste and tomato sauce. Validation data showed the good recoveries in the range of 70.1-104.5%, with relative standard deviations less than 15%. The method limits of determination/quantification were in the range of 0.2-0.9 and 0.7-3Î¼gkg(-1), respectively. The selective adsorption and enrichment of cationic dyes were achieved by the synergistic effects of hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic attraction between mixed hemimicelles and the cationic dyes, which also resulted in the removal of natural pigments interferences from sample extracts. When applied to real samples, RB was detected in several positive samples (chili powders) within the range from 0.042 to 0.177mgkg(-1). These results indicate that magnetic MHSPE is an efficient and selective sample preparation technique for the extraction of banned cationic dyes in a complex matrix. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Deuterium labelled d(3)-acrylamide was used as internal standard. Acrylamide was extracted by 10 mL of water and the extract purified by a single SPE column consisting of 0.5 g of an in-house prepared mixture of C18, strong cation (SCX) and anion exchange (SAX) sorbents in the ratio 2/1.5/1.5 (w/w/w). The amount of the three sorbents was optimised in order to eliminate the main interfering compounds present in coffee extracts, such as melanoidins, trigonelline, chlorogenic acids and caffeine. The SPE procedure was very simple and consisted of pushing 1 mL of an aqueous coffee extract through the SPE column followed by 1 mL of water which was collected for the analysis. The method was tested on six samples of roasted coffee of different composition and roasting level. The repeatability of the method, expressed as relative standard deviation (n=6), was lower than 5%. The recovery of acrylamide at three spiked levels ranged from 92% to 95%. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) were 5 and 16 Î¼g kg(-1), respectively. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Drinking water samples were acidified with formic acid, and then triazines were adsorbed by the PCX sorbent. Subsequently, the analytes were eluted with ammonium hydroxide/acetonitrile. The chromatographic separation was performed on an HSS T3 column using water (4 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) as the mobile phase. The method achieved LODs of 0.2-30.0 ng/L for the 30 triazines, with recoveries in the range of 70.5-112.1%, and the precision of the method was better than 12.7%. These results indicated that the proposed method had the advantages of convenience and high efficiency when applied to the analysis of the 30 triazines in drinking water.\n\nSolid phase monofunctionalization of gold nanoparticles using ionic exchange resin as polymer support.\n\nPubMed\n\nZou, Jianhua; Dai, Qiu; Wang, Jinhai; Liu, Xiong; Huo, Qun\n\n2007-07-01\n\nA solid phase modification method using anionic exchange resin as polymer support was developed for the synthesis of monofunctional gold nanoparticles. Based on a \"catch and release\" mechanism to control the number of functional groups attached to the nanoparticle surface, bifunctional thiol ligands with a carboxylic acid end group were first immobilized at a controlled density on anionic exchange resin through electrostatic interactions. Gold nanoparticles were then immobilized to the anionic exchange resin by a one-to-one place exchange reaction between resin-bound thiol ligands and butanethiol-protected gold nanoparticles in solution. After cleaving off from the resin under mild conditions, gold nanoparticles with a single carboxyl group attached to the surface were obtained as the major product. Experimental conditions such as the solvents used for ligand loading and solid phase place exchange reaction, and the loading density of the ligands, were found to play a critical role towards the successful synthesis of monofunctional nanoparticles. Overall, the noncovalent bond-based ligand immobilization technique reported here greatly simplified the process of solid phase monofunctionalization of nanoparticles compared to a previously reported covalent bond-based ligand immobilization technique.\n\nAll-inorganic Germanium nanocrystal films by cationic ligand exchange\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nWheeler, Lance M.; Nichols, Asa W.; Chernomordik, Boris D.; ...\n\n2016-01-21\n\nIn this study, we introduce a new paradigm for group IV nanocrystal surface chemistry based on room temperature surface activation that enables ionic ligand exchange. Germanium nanocrystals synthesized in a gas-phase plasma reactor are functionalized with labile, cationic alkylammonium ligands rather than with traditional covalently bound groups. We employ Fourier transform infrared and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies to demonstrate the alkylammonium ligands are freely exchanged on the germanium nanocrystal surface with a variety of cationic ligands, including short inorganic ligands such as ammonium and alkali metal cations. This ionic ligand exchange chemistry is used to demonstrate enhanced transport inmoreÂ Â» germanium nanocrystal films following ligand exchange as well as the first photovoltaic device based on an all-inorganic germanium nanocrystal absorber layer cast from solution. This new ligand chemistry should accelerate progress in utilizing germanium and other group IV nanocrystals for optoelectronic applications.Â«Â less\n\nCharacterization of rhamnolipids by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction.\n\nPubMed\n\nBehrens, Beate; Engelen, Jeannine; Tiso, Till; Blank, Lars Mathias; Hayen, Heiko\n\n2016-04-01\n\nRhamnolipids are surface-active agents with a broad application potential that are produced in complex mixtures by bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas. Analysis from fermentation broth is often characterized by laborious sample preparation and requires hyphenated analytical techniques like liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to obtain detailed information about sample composition. In this study, an analytical procedure based on chromatographic method development and characterization of rhamnolipid sample material by LC-MS as well as a comparison of two sample preparation methods, i.e., liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction, is presented. Efficient separation was achieved under reversed-phase conditions using a mixed propylphenyl and octadecylsilyl-modified silica gel stationary phase. LC-MS/MS analysis of a supernatant from Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 pVLT33_rhlABC grown on glucose as sole carbon source and purified by solid-phase extraction revealed a total of 20 congeners of di-rhamnolipids, mono-rhamnolipids, and their biosynthetic precursors 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acids (HAAs) with different carbon chain lengths from C8 to C14, including three rhamnolipids with uncommon C9 and C11 fatty acid residues. LC-MS and the orcinol assay were used to evaluate the developed solid-phase extraction method in comparison with the established liquid-liquid extraction. Solid-phase extraction exhibited higher yields and reproducibility as well as lower experimental effort.\n\n[Determination of Arsenic in Food Package Aluminum by Ultrasound Assisted Solid Phase Extraction/ICP-AES].\n\nPubMed\n\nQin, Wen-xia; Gong, Qi; Li, Min; Deng, Li-xin; Mo, Li-shu; Li, Yan-lin\n\n2015-04-01\n\nDetermination of arsenic in pure aluminum by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry was interfered by aluminum matrix. The experiment showed that when the mass concentration of Al was greater than or equal to 5 000 times the As in the test solution, the measurement error was greater than 5%. In order to eliminate the interference, strong acid cation exchange fiber (SACEF) was used as solid phase extraction agent to adsorb Al(3+). The extraction conditions included amount of SACEF, extraction time, temperature and pH were investigated. The optimal extraction conditions were that 0.9000 g SACEF was used to extract the aluminum from the sample solution of pH 2.0 at 55 Â°C for 5 min with the ultrasonic assist, and in this case, the arsenic in the form of arsenic acid was not extracted and left in the solution for the determination. The results showed that after treating 10. 00 mL test solution containing 1.00 Âµg arsenic and 20.0 mg aluminum, arsenic did not lose. The mass concentration of residual aluminum in the raffinate was about 2,000 times the As, which had not interfered the determination of arsenic. The detection limit (3 s) was 0.027 Âµg Â· mL(-1) and quantification limit (10 s) was 0.0091 Âµg Â· mL(-1). The proposed method was successfully applied to the separation and determination of arsenic in the synthetic samples, the aluminum cans and the barbecue aluminum foil. Recovery was in the range of 98.3%-105% and RSD (n = 3) was in the range of 0.1%-4.3%. The results showed that the content of arsenic in the aluminum cans and the aluminum barbecue foil was below the limited value of national standard (GB/T 3190-2008).\n\nHypercrosslinked particles for the extraction of sweeteners using dispersive solid-phase extraction from environmental samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nLakade, Sameer S; Zhou, Qing; Li, Aimin; Borrull, Francesc; Fontanals, NÃºria; MarcÃ©, Rosa M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis work presents a new extraction material, namely, Q-100, based on hypercrosslinked magnetic particles, which was tested in dispersive solid-phase extraction for a group of sweeteners from environmental samples. The hypercrosslinked Q-100 magnetic particles had the advantage of suitable pore size distribution and high surface area, and showed good retention behavior toward sweeteners. Different dispersive solid-phase extraction parameters such as amount of magnetic particles or extraction time were optimized. Under optimum conditions, Q-100 showed suitable apparent recovery, ranging in the case of river water sample from 21 to 88% for all the sweeteners, except for alitame (12%). The validated method based on dispersive solid-phase extraction using Q-100 followed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry provided good linearity and limits of quantification between 0.01 and 0.1Â Î¼g/L. The method was applied to analyze samples from river water and effluent wastewater, and four sweeteners (acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamate, and sucralose) were found in both types of sample.

While the cation exchange procedure, performed in solution phase approach, was restricted so far to chalcogenide based semiconductor nanocrystals, here ferrite-based nanocrystals were subjected to a Fe2+ to Co2+ cation exchange procedure. This allows tracing of the compositional modifications by systematic and detailed magnetic characterization. In homogeneous magnetite nanocrystals and in gold/magnetite core shell nanocrystals the cation exchange increases the coercivity field, the remanence magnetization, as well as the superparamagnetic blocking temperature. For core/shell nanoheterostructures a selective doping of either the shell or predominantly of the core with Co2+ is demonstrated. By applying the cation exchange to FeO/CoFe2O4 core/shell nanocrystals the NeÃ©l temperature of the core material is increased and exchange-bias effects are enhanced so that vertical shifts of the hysteresis loops are obtained which are superior to those in any other system.

Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) can be applied to the cleanup and preconcentration of analytes as the selective adsorbent of solid-phase extraction (SPE). In recent years, a new type of SPE has formed, molecularly imprinted polymer solid-phase extraction (MISPE), and has been widely applied to the extraction of agrochemicals. In this review, the mechanism of the molecular imprinting technique and the methodology of MIP preparations are explained. The extraction modes of MISPE, including offline and online, are discussed, and the applications of MISPE in the analysis of agrochemicals such as herbicides, fungicides and insecticides are summarized. It is concluded that MISPE is a powerful tool to selectively isolate agrochemicals from real samples with higher extraction and cleanup efficiency than commercial SPE and that it has great potential for broad applications.\n\nNovel dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction combined with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry to determine morpholine residues in citrus and apples.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Dawei; Miao, Hong; Zou, Jianhong; Cao, Pei; Ma, Ning; Zhao, Yunfeng; Wu, Yongning\n\n2015-01-21\n\nThis paper presents a new analytical method for the determination of morpholine residues in citrus and apples using a novel dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction (DMSPE), followed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS).

Morpholine from the extract was adsorbed to a polymer cation exchange sorbent and eluted with ammonium hydroxide/acetonitrile (3:97, v/v) through a 1 mL syringe with a 0.22 Î¼m nylon syringe filter. All of the samples were analyzed by UHPLC-HRMS/MS on a Waters Acquity BEH hydrophilic interaction chromatography column using 0.1% formic acid and 4 mM ammonium formate in water/acetonitrile as the mobile phase with gradient elution. The method showed good linearity (R(2) > 0.999) in the range of 1-100 Î¼g/L for the analyte. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation values of morpholine were 2 and 5 Î¼g/kg, respectively. The average recoveries of morpholine from the citrus and apple samples spiked at three different concentrations (5, 20, and 100 Î¼g/kg) were in a range from 78.4 to 102.7%.\n\nMixed-mode isolation of triazine metabolites from soil and aquifer sediments using automated solid-phase extraction\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMills, M.S.; Thurman, E.M.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nReversed-phase isolation and ion-exchange purification were combined in the automated solid-phase extraction of two polar s-triazine metabolites, 2-amino-4-chloro-6-(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (deethylatrazine) and 2-amino-4-chloro-6-(ethylamino)-s-triazine (deisopropylatrazine) from clay-loam and slit-loam soils and sandy aquifer sediments. First, methanol/ water (4/1, v/v) soil extracts were transferred to an automated workstation following evaporation of the methanol phase for the rapid reversed-phase isolation of the metabolites on an octadecylresin (C18). The retention of the triazine metabolites on C18 decreased substantially when trace methanol concentrations (1%) remained. Furthermore, the retention on C18 increased with decreasing aqueous solubility and increasing alkyl-chain length of the metabolites and parent herbicides, indicating a reversed-phase interaction. The analytes were eluted with ethyl acetate, which left much of the soil organic-matter impurities on the resin. Second, the small-volume organic eluate was purified on an anion-exchange resin (0.5 mL/min) to extract the remaining soil pigments that could foul the ion source of the GC/MS system. Recoveries of the analytes were 75%, using deuterated atrazine as a surrogate, and were comparable to recoveries by soxhlet extraction. The detection limit was 0.1 ??g/kg with a coefficient of variation of 15%. The ease and efficiency of this automated method makes it viable, practical technique for studying triazine metabolites in the environment.\n\n[Determination of lead in edible salt with solid-phase extraction and GFAAS].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Xin; Zhou, Shuang; Ma, Lan; Yang, Dajin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEstablishing a method for determination of lead in salt with solid-phase extraction and GFAAS. Salt sample was diluted to a certain volume directly with ammonium acetate, then the sample solution was filtered through the solid phase extraction column which has been pre-activated. Lead ions were retained, and the sodium chloride matrix was removed. After elution, the collected lead ions was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry in 257.4 nm. This method can be used effectively to wipe off the sodium chloride in matrix. The limit of detection was 0.7 microg/kg and the limit of quantification was 2 microg/kg. Solid phase extraction technique can be used effectively to reduce the interference in matrix and improves the accuracy and reproducibility of detection.\n\nDetermination of bisphenols in beverages by mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nRegueiro, Jorge; Wenzl, Thomas\n\n2015-11-27\n\nFacing growing restrictions on the use of bisphenol A in food contact materials, several bisphenol analogs are arising as major alternatives to replace this chemical in most of its applications. This work reports a simple and robust method based on mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of bisphenol A and its main analogs - bisphenol S, 4,4'-sulfonylbis(2-methylphenol), bisphenol F, bisphenol E, bisphenol B, bisphenol Z, bisphenol AF, bisphenol AP, tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol P - in alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Mixed-mode solid-phase extraction, combining cationic exchange and reversed-phase mechanisms, was optimized to provide a selective extraction and purification of the target analytes. Derivatization of bisphenols with pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride allowed increasing their ionization efficiency by electrospray ionization. Validation of the proposed method was performed in terms of selectivity, matrix effects, linearity, precision, measurement uncertainty, trueness and limits of detection. Satisfactory repeatability and intermediate precision were obtained; the related relative standard deviations were â¤9% and â¤12%, respectively. The relative expanded uncertainty (k=2) was below 20% for all bisphenol analogs and the trueness of the method was demonstrated by recovery experiments. Limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 1.6ngL(-1) to 27.9ngL(-1) for all compounds. Finally, several canned and non-canned beverages were analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of the method. Only bisphenol A and three bisphenol F isomers were detected in any of the samples. Bisphenol A concentration ranged from\n\nPlatform construction and extraction mechanism study of magnetic mixed hemimicelles solid-phase extraction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXiao, Deli; Zhang, Chan; He, Jia; Zeng, Rong; Chen, Rong; He, Hua\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSimple, accurate and high-throughput pretreatment method would facilitate large-scale studies of trace analysis in complex samples.

Polypyrrole-magnetite was used as adsorbent due to its thermal stability, magnetic properties, and ability to adsorb Rhodamine 6G and crystal violet. Dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction parameters were optimized, including sample pH, adsorbent amount, extraction time, and desorption solvent. The optimum polypyrrole-magnetite dispersive micro-solid phase-extraction conditions were sample pH 8, 60Â mg polypyrrole-magnetite adsorbent, 5Â min of extraction time, and acetonitrile as the desorption solvent. Under the optimized conditions, the polypyrrole-magnetite dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction with ultraviolet-visible method showed good linearity in the range of 0.05-7Â mg/L (R 2 Â >Â 0.9980). The method also showed a good limit of detection for the dyes (0.05Â mg/L) and good analyte recoveries (97.4-111.3%) with relative standard deviationsÂ <Â 10%. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of dyes in textile wastewater samples where the concentration found was 1.03Â mg (RSD Â±7.9%) and 1.13Â mg/L (RSD Â± 4.6%) for Rhodamine 6G and crystal violet, respectively. It can be concluded that this method can be adopted for the rapid extraction and determination of dyes at trace concentration levels. Â© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the proposed method, trace metal ions in aqueous samples were adsorbed by cation exchange fibers and desorbed by acidic solution from the fibers. After the ion preconcentration process, the enriched solution was detected by ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis). Then, the concentration of heavy metal ions were quantified by analyzing ultraviolet and visible spectrum with the help of partial least squares (PLS) approaches. Under the optimal conditions of operation time, flow rate and detection parameters, the overlapped absorption peaks of mixed ions were obtained. The experimental data showed that the concentration, which can be calculated through chemometrics method, of each metal ion increased significantly. The heavy metal ions can be enriched more than 80-fold. The limits of detection (LOD) for the target analytes of copper ions (Cu2 +), cobalt ions (Co2 +) and nickel ions (Ni2 +) mixture was 0.10 Î¼g L- 1, 0.15 Î¼g L- 1 and 0.13 Î¼g L- 1, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSD) were less than 5%. The performance of the solid-phase extraction can enrich the ions efficiently and the combined method of spectrophotometric detection and PLS can evaluate the ions concentration accurately. The work proposed here is an interesting and promising attempt for the trace ions determination in water samples and will have much more applied field.\n\nCharacterisation of chamomile volatiles by simultaneous distillation solid-phase extraction in comparison to hydrodistillation and simultaneous distillation extraction.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrÃ¼ger, Hans\n\n2010-05-01\n\nA new method for complete separation of steam-volatile organic compounds is described using the example of chamomile flowers. This method is based on the direct combination of hydrodistillation and solid-phase extraction in a circulation apparatus. In contrast to hydrodistillation and simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE), an RP-18 solid phase as adsorptive material is used rather than a water-insoluble solvent. Therefore, a prompt and complete fixation of all volatiles takes place, and the circulation of water-soluble bisabololoxides as well as water-soluble and thermolabile en-yne-spiroethers is inhibited. This so-called simultaneous distillation solid-phase extraction (SD-SPE) provides extracts that better characterise the real composition of the vapour phase, as well as the composition of inhalation vapours, than do SDE extracts or essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation. The data indicate that during inhalation therapy with chamomile, the bisabololoxides and spiroethers are more strongly involved in the inhaling activity than so far assumed.

Linear or convex gradients in the range from pH 2.6 to 9 were formed using a variety of commercially available column packings that provide a buffering capacity in different pH ranges, and either polyampholytes or simple mixtures having a small number (three or fewer) of buffering species as the elution buffer. The resolutions achieved using cation-exchange or anion-exchange chromatofocusing were in general comparable, although for certain pairs of proteins better resolution could be achieved using one type of packing as compared to the other, evidently due to the way electrostatic charges are distributed on the protein surface. Several chromatofocusing methods were investigated that take advantage of the acid-base properties of commercially available cation-exchange column packings. These include the use of gradients with a composite shape, the use of very low pH ranges, and the use of elution buffers containing a single buffering species. The advantages of chromatofocusing over ion-exchange chromatography using a salt gradient at constant pH were illustrated by employing the former method and a cation-exchange column packing to separate beta-lactoglobulins A and B, which is a separation reported to be impossible using the latter method and a cation-exchange column packing. Trends in the apparent isoelectric points determined using cation- and anion-exchange chromatofocusing were interpreted using applicable theories. Results of this study indicate that cation-exchange chromatofocusing is a useful technique which is complementary to anion-exchange chromatofocusing and isoelectric focusing for separating proteins at both the analytical and preparative scales.\n\nIon-exchange solid-phase extraction combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of veterinary drugs in organic fertilizers.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Zhiyong; Zhang, Yanmei; Xuan, Yanfang; Song, Wei; Si, Wenshuai; Zhao, Zhihui; Rao, Qinxiong\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe analysis of veterinary drugs in organic fertilizers is crucial for an assessment of potential risks to soil microbial communities and human health. We develop a robust and sensitive method to quantitatively determine 19 veterinary drugs (amantadine, sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones) in organic fertilizers. The method involved a simple solid-liquid extraction step using the combination of acetonitrile and McIlvaine buffer as extraction solvent, followed by cleanup with a solid-phase extraction cartridge containing polymeric mixed-mode anion-exchange sorbents. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used to separate and detect target analytes. We particularly focused on the optimization of sample clean-up step: different diluents and dilution factors were tested. The developed method was validated in terms of linearity, recovery, precision, sensitivity and specificity. The recoveries of all the drugs ranged from 70.9% to 112.7% at three concentration levels, with the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation lower than 15.7%. The limits of quantification were between 1.0 and 10.0Î¼g/kg for all the drugs. Matrix effect was minimized by matrix-matched calibration curves. The analytical method was successfully applied for the survey of veterinary drugs contamination in 20 compost samples. The results indicated that fluoroquinolones had higher incidence rate and mean concentration levels ranging from 31.9 to 308.7Î¼g/kg compared with other drugs. We expect the method will provide the basis for risk assessment of veterinary drugs in organic fertilizers. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The target glycopeptide antibiotics were isolated from the samples by solvent extraction, and the extracts were cleaned with a tandem solid-phase extraction step using mixed strong cation exchange and hydrophilic/lipophilic balance cartridges. Subsequently, the analytes were eluted with different solvents, and then quantified by UHPLC-MS/MS in the positive ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring. Under optimal conditions, good linear correlations were obtained for the five glycopeptide antibiotics in the concentration range of 1.0â¯Î¼g/L to 20.0â¯Î¼g/L, and with linear correlation coefficients >0.998. Employing this method, the target glycopeptide antibiotics in food and biological samples were identified with a recovery of 83.0-102%, and a low quantitation limit of 1.0â¯Î¼g/kg in food and 2.0â¯Î¼g/L in biological samples with low matrix effects.

A distribution analysis of calculated pK(a) values from the 34390 records in Antibase2008 revealed that within pH 2-11, 44% of all included compounds had an acidic functionality, 17% a basic functionality, and 9% both. This showed a great potential for using ion-exchange chromatography as an integral part of the separation procedure, orthogonal to the classic reversed-phase strategy. Thus, we investigated the use of an \"explorative solid-phase extraction\" (E-SPE) protocol using SAX, Oasis MAX, SCX, and LH-20 columns for targeted exploitation of chemical functionalities. E-SPE provides a minimum of fractions (15) for chemical and biological analyses and implicates development into a preparative scale methodology. Overall, this allows fast extract prioritization, easier dereplication, mapping of biological activities, and formulation of a purification strategy.\n\nSystematic Assessment of Seven Solvent and Solid-Phase Extraction Methods for Metabolomics Analysis of Human Plasma by LC-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSitnikov, Dmitri G.; Monnin, Cian S.; Vuckovic, Dajana\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe comparison of extraction methods for global metabolomics is usually executed in biofluids only and focuses on metabolite coverage and method repeatability. This limits our detailed understanding of extraction parameters such as recovery and matrix effects and prevents side-by-side comparison of different sample preparation strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, seven solvent-based and solid-phase extraction methods were systematically evaluated using standard analytes spiked into both buffer and human plasma. We compared recovery, coverage, repeatability, matrix effects, selectivity and orthogonality of all methods tested for non-lipid metabolome in combination with reversed-phased and mixed-mode liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS). Our results confirmed wide selectivity and excellent precision of solvent precipitations, but revealed their high susceptibility to matrix effects. The use of all seven methods showed high overlap and redundancy which resulted in metabolite coverage increases of 34-80% depending on LC-MS method employed as compared to the best single extraction protocol (methanol/ethanol precipitation) despite 7x increase in MS analysis time and sample consumption. The most orthogonal methods to methanol-based precipitation were ion-exchange solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction using methyl-tertbutyl ether. Our results help facilitate rational design and selection of sample preparation methods and internal standards for global metabolomics.\n\nApplication of solid-phase extraction to agar-supported fermentation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLe Goff, GÃ©raldine; Adelin, Emilie; Cortial, Sylvie; Servy, Claudine; Ouazzani, Jamal\n\n2013-09-01\n\nAgar-supported fermentation (Ag-SF), a variant of solid-state fermentation, has recently been improved by the development of a dedicated 2Â m(2) scale pilot facility, Platotex. We investigated the application of solid-phase extraction (SPE) to Ag-SF in order to increase yields and minimize the contamination of the extracts with agar constituents. The selection of the appropriate resin was conducted on liquid-state fermentation and Diaion HP-20 exhibited the highest recovery yield and selectivity for the metabolites of the model fungal strains Phomopsis sp. and Fusarium sp. SPE applied to Ag-SF resulted in a particular compartmentalization of the culture. The mycelium that requires oxygen to grow migrates to the top layer and formed a thick biofilm. The resin beads intercalate between the agar surface and the mycelium layer, and trap directly the compounds secreted by the mycelium through a \"solid-solid extraction\" (SSE) process. The resin/mycelium layer is easily recovered by scraping the surface and the target metabolites extracted by methanol. Ag-SF associated to SSE represents an ideal compromise for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites with limited economic and environmental impact.\n\nImmobilized humic substances and immobilized aggregates of humic substances as sorbent for solid phase extraction.\n\nPubMed\n\nErny, Guillaume L; GonÃ§alves, Bruna M; Esteves, Valdemar I\n\n2013-09-06\n\nIn this work, humic substances (HS) immobilized, as a thin layer or as aggregates, on silica gel were tested as material for solid phase extraction. Some triazines (simazine, atrazine, therbutylazine, atrazine-desethyl-desisopropyl-2-hydroxy, ametryn and terbutryn), have been selected as test analytes due to their environmental importance and to span a large range of solubility and octanol/water partition coefficient (logP). The sorbent was obtained immobilizing a thin layer of HS via physisorption on a pre-coated silica gel with a cationic polymer (polybrene). While the sorbent could be used as it is, it was demonstrated that additional HS could be immobilized, via weak interactions, to form stable humic aggregates. However, while a higher quantity of HS could be immobilized, no significant differences were observed in the sorption parameters. This sorbent have been tested for solid phase extraction to concentrate triazines from aqueous matrixes. The sorbent demonstrated performances equivalent to commercial alternatives as a concentration factor between 50 and 200, depending on the type of triazines, was obtained. Moreover the low cost and the high flow rate of sample through the column allowed using high quantity of sorbent. The analytical procedure was tested with different matrixes including tap water, river water and estuarine water. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The extraction phase of poly(dimethysiloxane) (PDMS) containing 3% vinyl group was physically incorporated into the sol-gel network without chemical bonding. The extraction phase itself is then partly crosslinked at 320 degrees C, forming an independent polymer network and can withstand desorption temperature of 290 degrees C. The headspace extraction of BTX by the fiber SPME was evaluated and the detection limit of o-xylene was down to 0.26 ng/l. Extraction and determination of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) in water, orange juice and red wine by the SPME-GC thermionic specified detector (TSD) was validated. Limits of detection of the method for OPPs were below 10 ng/l except methidathion. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 1-20% for pesticides being tested.\n\nCation Exchange Reactions for Improved Quality and Diversity of Semiconductor Nanocrystals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeberwyck, Brandon James\n\nObserving the size and shape dependent physical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals requires synthetic methods capable of not only composition and crystalline phase control but also molecular scale uniformity for a particle consisting of tens to hundreds of thousands of atoms. The desire for synthetic methods that produce uniform nanocrystals of complex morphologies continues to increase as nanocrystals find roles in commercial applications, such as biolabeling and display technologies, that are simultaneously restricting material compositions. With these constraints, new synthetic strategies that decouple the nanocrystal's chemical composition from its morphology are necessary. This dissertation explores the cation exchange reaction of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, a template-based chemical transformation that enables the interconversion of nanocrystals between a variety of compositions while maintaining their size dispersity and morphology. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the versatility of this replacement reaction as a synthetic method for semiconductor nanocrystals. An overview of the fundamentals of the cation exchange reaction and the diversity of products that are achievable is presented. Chapter 2 examines the optical properties of nanocrystal heterostructures produced through cation exchange reactions. The deleterious impact of exchange on the photoluminescence is correlated to residual impurities and a simple annealing protocol is demonstrated to achieve photoluminescence yields comparable to samples produced by conventional methods. Chapter 3 investigates the extension of the cation exchange reaction beyond ionic nanocrystals. Covalent III-V nanocrystal of high crystallinity and low size dispersity are synthesized by the cation exchange of cadmium pnictide nanocrystals with group 13 ions. Lastly, Chapter 4 highlights future studies to probe cation exchange reactions in colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals and progress that needs to be\n\nValidated method for determination of eight banned nitroimidazole residues in natural casings by LC/MS/MS with solid-phase extraction.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Hanwen; Wang, Fengchi; Ai, Lianfeng; Guo, Chunhai; Chen, Ruichun\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA sensitive method based on solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry interfaced with electrospray ionization (SPE-LC-MS/MS-ESI) was developed for the simultaneous determination of 8 banned nitroimidazole (NOZ) drugs including metronidazole (MNZ), ronidazole (RNZ), dimetridazole (DMZ), tinidazole, ornidazole, secnidazole, metronidazole-OH (MNZOH, the metabolite of MNZ), and 2-hydroxymethyl-1-methyl-5-nitroimidazole (HMMNI, the metabolite of RNZ and DMZ) in natural casings. After extraction with ethyl acetate and evaporation, the NOZs were reconstituted in ethyl acetate and purified on a strong cation-exchange SPE column, and then LC/MS/MS analysis was performed by positive ESI applying multiple reaction monitoring of 2 transition reactions for each compound. The method was validated according to the European Union requirements (Commission Decision 2002/657/EC). Specificity, linearity, decision limit (CCalpha), detection capability (CCbeta), accuracy, and precision were determined. Average recoveries of the 8 NOZs from natural animal casing fortified at 3 levels (0.1, 0.5, and 1 microg/kg) ranged from 87.3 to 116.5%. The calculated CCalpha for NOZs ranged from 0.029 to 0.049 microg/kg, and CCbeta ranged from 0.049 to 0.083 microg/kg. Repeatability was in the range of 3.35-10.1%, and within-laboratory reproducibility was <10.3%.\n\nCation exchange assisted binding-elution strategy for enzymatic synthesis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs).\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Hailiang; Wu, Zhigang; Gadi, Madhusudhan Reddy; Wang, Shuaishuai; Guo, Yuxi; Edmunds, Garrett; Guan, Wanyi; Fang, Junqiang\n\n2017-09-15\n\nA cation exchange assisted binding-elution (BE) strategy for enzymatic synthesis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) was developed. An amino linker was used to provide the cation ion under acidic condition which can be readily bound to cation exchange resin and then eluted off by saturated ammonium bicarbonate. Ammonium bicarbonate in the collections was easily removed by vacuum evaporation. This strategy circumvented the incompatible issue between glycosyltransferases and solid support or large polymers, and no purification was needed for intermediate products. With current approach, polyLacNAc backbones of HMOs and fucosylated HMOs were synthesized smoothly. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the proposed method, trace metal ions in aqueous samples were adsorbed by cation exchange fibers and desorbed by acidic solution from the fibers. After the ion preconcentration process, the enriched solution was detected by ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis). Then, the concentration of heavy metal ions were quantified by analyzing ultraviolet and visible spectrum with the help of partial least squares (PLS) approaches. Under the optimal conditions of operation time, flow rate and detection parameters, the overlapped absorption peaks of mixed ions were obtained. The experimental data showed that the concentration, which can be calculated through chemometrics method, of each metal ion increased significantly. The heavy metal ions can be enriched more than 80-fold. The limits of detection (LOD) for the target analytes of copper ions (Cu 2+ ), cobalt ions (Co 2+ ) and nickel ions (Ni 2+ ) mixture was 0.10Î¼gL -1 , 0.15Î¼gL -1 and 0.13Î¼gL -1 , respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSD) were less than 5%. The performance of the solid-phase extraction can enrich the ions efficiently and the combined method of spectrophotometric detection and PLS can evaluate the ions concentration accurately. The work proposed here is an interesting and promising attempt for the trace ions determination in water samples and will have much more applied field. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On inorganic selective sorbents the increase in isotope enrichment factor up to 0.0127 is received. Also, parametrical models that are adequately describing dependence of the pressure difference and the magnitude expansion in the ion-exchange layer from the flow rate and temperature have been obtained. The concentration rate value under the optimum realization conditions of process and depending on type of a selective material changes in a range 1.021Ã·1.092. Calculated results show agreement with experimental data.\n\nFractionation analysis of oxyanion-forming metals and metalloids in leachates of cement-based materials using ion exchange solid phase extraction.\n\nPubMed\n\nMulugeta, Mesay; Wibetoe, Grethe; Engelsen, Christian J; Lund, Walter\n\n2009-05-15\n\nA simple and versatile solid phase extraction (SPE) method has been developed to determine the anionic species of As, Cr, Mo, Sb, Se and V in leachates of cement mortar and concrete materials in the pH range 3-13. The anionic fractions of these elements were extracted using a strong anion exchanger (SAX) and their concentrations were determined as the difference in element concentration between the sample and the SAX effluent. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used off-line to analyse solutions before and after passing through the SAX. The extraction method has been developed by optimizing sorbent type, sorbent conditioning and sample percolation rate. Breakthrough volumes and effect of matrix constituents were "
