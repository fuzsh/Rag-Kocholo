        "text": "Radial heterogeneity of some analytical columns used in high-performance liquid chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbia, Jude A; Mriziq, Khaled S; Guiochon, Georges A\n\n2009-04-10\n\nAn on-column electrochemical microdetector was used to determine accurately the radial distribution of the mobile phase velocity and of the column efficiency at the exit of three common analytical columns, namely a 100 mm x 4.6mm C18 bonded silica-based monolithic column, a 150 mm x 4.6mm column packed with 2.7 microm porous shell particles of C18 bonded silica (HALO), and a 150 mm x 4.6mm column packed with 3 microm fully porous C18 bonded silica particles (LUNA). The results obtained demonstrate that all three columns are not radially homogeneous. In all three cases, the efficiency was found to be lower in the wall region of the column than in its core region (the central core with a radius of 1/3 the column inner radius). The decrease in local efficiency from the core to the wall regions was lower in the case of the monolith (ca. 25%) than in that of the two particle-packed columns (ca. 35-50%). The mobile phase velocity was found to be ca. 1.5% higher in the wall than in the core region of the monolithic column while, in contrast, it was ca. 2.5-4.0% lower in the wall region for the two particle-packed columns.\n\nMicrowave assisted solvent extraction and coupled-column reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection use of an analytical restricted-access-medium column for the efficient multi-residue analysis of acidic pesticides in soils.\n\nPubMed\n\nHogendoom, E A; Huls, R; Dijkman, E; Hoogerbrugge, R\n\n2001-12-14\n\nA screening method has been developed for the determination of acidic pesticides in various types of soils. Methodology is based on the use of microwave assisted solvent extraction (MASE) for fast and efficient extraction of the analytes from the soils and coupled-column reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC-LC) with UV detection at 228 nm for the instrumental analysis of uncleaned extracts. Four types of soils, including sand, clay and peat, with a range in organic matter content of 0.3-13% and ten acidic pesticides of different chemical families (bentazone, bromoxynil, metsulfuron-methyl, 2,4-D, MCPA, MCPP, 2,4-DP, 2,4,5-T, 2,4-DB and MCPB) were selected as matrices and analytes, respectively. The method developed included the selection of suitable MASE and LC-LC conditions. The latter consisted of the selection of a 5-microm GFF-II internal surface reversed-phase (ISRP, Pinkerton) analytical column (50 x 4.6 mm, I.D.) as the first column in the RAM-C18 configuration in combination with an optimised linear gradient elution including on-line cleanup of sample extracts and reconditioning of the columns. The method was validated with the analysis of freshly spiked samples and samples with aged residues (120 days). The four types of soils were spiked with the ten acidic pesticides at levels between 20 and 200 microg/kg. Weighted regression of the recovery data showed for most analyte-matrix combinations, including freshly spiked samples and aged residues, that the method provides overall recoveries between 60 and 90% with relative standard deviations of the intra-laboratory reproducibility's between 5 and 25%; LODs were obtained between 5 and 50 microg/kg. Evaluation of the data set with principal component analysis revealed that the parameters (i) increase of organic matter content of the soil samples and (ii) aged residues negatively effect the recovery of the analytes.\n\nEnantiomeric separation of triazole fungicides with 3-Î¼m and 5-Î¼ml particle chiral columns by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nQiu, Jing; Dai, Shouhui; Zheng, Chuangmu; Yang, Shuming; Chai, Tingting; Bie, Mei\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThis study used chiral columns packed with 3-Î¼m and 5-Î¼m particles to comparatively separate enantiomers of 9 triazole fungicides, and Lux Cellulose-1 columns with chiral stationary phase of cellulose-tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) were used on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with flow rates of 0.3 and 1.0 mL min(-1) for 3-Î¼m and 5-Î¼m columns, respectively. The (+)-enantiomers of hexaconazole (1), tetraconazole (4), myclobutanil (7), fenbuconazole (8) and the (-)-enantiomers of flutriafol (2), diniconazole (3), epoxiconazole (5), penconazole (6), triadimefon (9) were firstly eluted from both columns, the elution orders identified with an optical rotation detector didn't change with variety of column particles and mobile phases (acetronitrile/water and methanol/water). The plots of natural logarithms of the selectivity factors (ln Î±) for all fungicides except penconazole (6) versus the inverse of temperature (1/T) were linear in range of 5-40Â°C. The thermodynamic parameters (ÎHÂ°, ÎSÂ°, ÎÎHÂ° and ÎÎSÂ°) were calculated using Van't Hoff equations to understand the thermosynamic driving forces for enantioseparation. This work will be very helpful to obtain good enantiomeric separation and establish more efficient analytical method for triazole fungicides. Chirality, 2011. Â© 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Zebrafish represent a model to study chemically induced TH disruption, prompting the need for sensitive detection of THs. Simultaneous quantification of 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), 3,3',5'-triiodo-l-thyronine (rT3), 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (3,5-T2) and 3,3'-diiodo-l-thyronine (3,3'-T2) in zebrafish larvae was achieved by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in positive ion mode. Solid-phase extraction with SampliQ cartridges and derivatization with 3Â m hydrochloric acid in n-butanol reduced matrix effects. Derivatized compounds were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C 18 column with mobile phases consisting of 0.1% acetic acid in deionized water and 0.1% acetic acid in methanol. The limits of detection ranged from 0.5 to 0.6âpg injected on column. The method was validated by evaluating recovery (77.1-117.2%), accuracy (87.3-123.9%) and precision (0.5-12.4%) using diluted homogenized zebrafish embryos spiked with all target compounds. This method was then applied to zebrafish larvae collected after 114âh of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), including PCB 28, PCB 66 and PCB 95, or the technical mixture Aroclor 1254. Exposure to PCB 28 and PCB 95 increased the T4:T3 ratio and decreased the T3:rT3 ratio, demonstrating that this method can effectively detect PCB-induced alterations in THs.

The object of this investigation was to determine the curve of column strength for extruded aluminum alloy 75S-T. In addition to three extruded shapes, a rolled-and-drawn round rod was included. Specimens of various lengths covering the range of effective slenderness ratios up to about 100 were tested.\n\nSemi-permeable surface analytical reversed-phase column for the improved trace analysis of acidic pesticides in water with coupled-column reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection. Determination of bromoxynil and bentazone in surface water.\n\nPubMed\n\nHogendoorn, E A; Westhuis, K; Dijkman, E; Heusinkveld, H A; den Boer, A C; Evers, E A; Baumann, R A\n\n1999-10-08\n\nThe coupled-column (LC-LC) configuration consisting of a 3 microm C18 column (50 x 4.6 mm I.D.) as the first column and a 5 microm C18 semi-permeable-surface (SPS) column (150 x 4.6 mm I.D.) as the second column appeared to be successful for the screening of acidic pesticides in surface water samples. In comparison to LC-LC employing two C18 columns, the combination of C18/SPS-C18 significantly decreased the baseline deviation caused by the hump of the co-extracted humic substances when using UV detection (217 nm). The developed LC-LC procedure allowed the simultaneous determination of the target analytes bentazone and bromoxynil in uncleaned extracts of surface water samples to a level of 0.05 microg/l in less than 15 min. In combination with a simple solid-phase extraction step (200 ml of water on a 500 mg C18-bonded silica) the analytical procedure provides a high sample throughput. During a period of about five months more than 200 ditch-water samples originating from agricultural locations were analyzed with the developed procedure. Validation of the method was performed by randomly analyzing recoveries of water samples spiked at levels of 0.1 microg/l (n=10), 0.5 microg/l (n=7) and 2.5 microg/l (n=4). Weighted regression of the recovery data showed that the method provides overall recoveries of 95 and 100% for bentazone and bromoxynil, respectively, with corresponding intra-laboratory reproducibilities of 10 and 11%, respectively. Confirmation of the analytes in part of the samples extracts was carried out with GC-negative ion chemical ionization MS involving a derivatization step with bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl bromide. No false negatives or positives were observed.\n\nTwo-Dimensional Model for Reactive-Sorption Columns of Cylindrical Geometry: Analytical Solutions and Moment Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Farman U; Qamar, Shamsul\n\n2017-05-01\n\nA set of analytical solutions are presented for a model describing the transport of a solute in a fixed-bed reactor of cylindrical geometry subjected to the first (Dirichlet) and third (Danckwerts) type inlet boundary conditions. Linear sorption kinetic process and first-order decay are considered. Cylindrical geometry allows the use of large columns to investigate dispersion, adsorption/desorption and reaction kinetic mechanisms. The finite Hankel and Laplace transform techniques are adopted to solve the model equations. For further analysis, statistical temporal moments are derived from the Laplace-transformed solutions. The developed analytical solutions are compared with the numerical solutions of high-resolution finite volume scheme. Different case studies are presented and discussed for a series of numerical values corresponding to a wide range of mass transfer and reaction kinetics. A good agreement was observed in the analytical and numerical concentration profiles and moments. The developed solutions are efficient tools for analyzing numerical algorithms, sensitivity analysis and simultaneous determination of the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients from a laboratory-scale radial column experiment.

Column qualification is commonly done by pulse response experiments and depends highly on the experimental testing conditions. Additionally, the peak analysis method, the variation in the 3D packing structure of the bed, and the measurement precision of the workstation influence the outcome of qualification runs. While a full body of literature on these factors is available for HPLC columns, no comparable studies exist for preparative columns for protein chromatography. We quantified the influence of these parameters for commercially available pre-packed and self-packed columns of disposable and non-disposable design. Pulse response experiments were performed on 105 preparative chromatography columns with volumes of 0.2-20ml. The analyte acetone was studied at six different superficial velocities (30, 60, 100, 150, 250 and 500cm/h). The column-to-column packing variation between disposable pre-packed columns of different diameter-length combinations varied by 10-15%, which was acceptable for the intended use. The column-to-column variation cannot be explained by the packing density, but is interpreted as a difference in particle arrangement in the column. Since it was possible to determine differences in the column-to-column performance, we concluded that the columns were well-packed. The measurement precision of the chromatography workstation was independent of the column volume and was in a range ofÂ±0.01ml for the first peak moment andÂ±0.007 ml 2 for the second moment. The measurement precision must be considered for small columns in the range of 2ml or less. The efficiency of disposable pre-packed columns was equal or better than that of self-packed columns.

According to the model, 240 different retention times of the analytes, expressed as Y variable (log k), at different % MeOH mobile-phase concentrations have been correlated with their theoretical most important structural or molecular descriptors. The goodness-of-fit was estimated by the coefficient of multiple determinations r(2) (0.919), and the root mean square error of estimation (RMSEE=0.1283) values with a predictive ability (Q(2)) of 0.901. The model was further validated using cross-validation (CV), validated by 20 response permutations r(2) (0.0, 0.0146), Q(2) (0.0, -0.136) and validated by external prediction. The contribution of certain mechanism interactions between the analytes, the mobile phase and the column, proportional or counterbalancing is also studied. Trying to evaluate the influence on Y of every variable in a PLS model, VIP (variables importance in the projection) plot provides evidence that lipophilicity (expressed as Log D, Log P), polarizability, refractivity and the eluting power of the mobile phase are dominant in the retention mechanism on a phenyl column.

The extended thermodynamic approach enabled the understanding of the underlying separation mechanism. Comparing six different column-salt systems it was observed that general system hydrophobicity presented by salt chaotropicity and column hydrophobicity favors stationary phase ion-pairing over the ion-pair formation in the eluent. Further, an attempt was made to describe the influence of analytes' nature on their retention behavior in such chromatographic systems. An analysis is performed in order to select and elucidate the molecular descriptors (electrostatical, quantum-chemical, geometrical, topological, and constitutional) that best explain the experimental evidence and findings obtained by the thermodynamic approach. The results of this analysis suggest that analytes' charge distribution and its complementarity to the structure of the electric double layer formed on the surface of the stationary phase upon the addition of chaotropic additives can be useful for understanding the differences in retention of structurally related analytes. These findings provide a novel understanding of the interactions between all the components of the chromatographic system containing chaotropic additive and a good basis for further investigations suggesting the development of generally applicable predictors in structure-retention relationship studies in related chromatographic systems.

The influence of this solvent strength effect on the separation of analytes is studied here theoretically using a mass balance model describing the spatio-temporal evolution of the eluent, the sample solvent and the analyte. The viscosity of the sample solvent and carrier fluid is supposed to be the same (i.e. no viscous fingering effects are taken into account). A linear isotherm adsorption with a retention factor depending upon the local concentration of the liquid phase is considered. The governing equations are numerically solved by using a Fourier spectral method and parametric studies are performed to analyze the effect of various governing parameters on the dispersion and skewness of the analyte zone. The distortion of this zone is found to depend strongly on the difference in eluting strength between the mobile phase and the sample solvent as well as on the sample volume.

Devising effective means to strengthen the crucial contribution of Analytical Chemistry to progress in Chemistry, Science & Technology, and Society requires carefully examining the present status of our discipline and also identifying internal and external driving forces with a potential adverse impact on its development. The diagnostic process should be followed by administration of an effective therapy and supported by adoption of a theragnostic strategy if Analytical Chemistry is to enjoy a better future.\n\nEnantioselective Analytical- and Preparative-Scale Separation of Hexabromocyclododecane Stereoisomers Using Packed Column Supercritical Fluid Chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nRiddell, Nicole; Mullin, Lauren Gayle; van Bavel, Bert; Ericson Jogsten, Ingrid; McAlees, Alan; Brazeau, Allison; Synnott, Scott; Lough, Alan; McCrindle, Robert; Chittim, Brock\n\n2016-11-10\n\nHexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) is an additive brominated flame retardant which has been listed in Annex A of the Stockholm Convention for elimination of production and use. It has been reported to persist in the environment and has the potential for enantiomer-specific degradation, accumulation, or both, making enantioselective analyses increasingly important. The six main stereoisomers of technical HBCDD (i.e., the (+) and (-) enantiomers of Î±-, Î²-, and Î³-HBCDD) were separated and isolated for the first time using enantioselective packed column supercritical fluid chromatography (pSFC) separation methods on a preparative scale. Characterization was completed using published chiral liquid chromatography (LC) methods and elution profiles, as well as X-ray crystallography, and the isolated fractions were definitively identified. Additionally, the resolution of the enantiomers, along with two minor components of the technical product (Î´- and Îµ-HBCDD), was investigated on an analytical scale using both LC and pSFC separation techniques, and changes in elution order were highlighted. Baseline separation of all HBCDD enantiomers was achieved by pSFC on an analytical scale using a cellulose-based column. The described method emphasizes the potential associated with pSFC as a green method of isolating and analyzing environmental contaminants of concern.\n\nSeismic performance of interior precast concrete beam-column connections with T-section steel inserts under cyclic loading\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKetiyot, Rattapon; Hansapinyo, Chayanon\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAn experimental investigation was conducted to study the performance of precast beam-column concrete connections using T-section steel inserts into the concrete beam and joint core, under reversed cyclic loading. Six 2/3-scale interior beam-column subassemblies, one monolithic concrete specimen and five precast concrete specimens were tested. One precast specimen was a simple connection for a gravity load resistant design. Other precast specimens were developed with different attributes to improve their seismic performance. The test results showed that the performance of the monolithic specimen M1 represented ductile seismic behavior. Failure of columns and joints could be prevented, and the failure of the frame occurred at the flexural plastic hinge formation at the beam ends, close to the column faces. For the precast specimens, the splitting crack along the longitudinal lapped splice was a major failure. The precast P5 specimen with double steel T-section inserts showed better seismic performance compared to the other precast models. However, the dowel bars connected to the steel inserts were too short to develop a bond. The design of the precast concrete beams with lap splice is needed for longer lap lengths and should be done at the beam mid span or at the low flexural stress region.\n\nEvaluation of Copper-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate Metal-organic Framework (Cu-MOF) as a Selective Sorbent for Lewis-base Analytes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHarvey, Scott D.; Eckberg, Alison D.; Thallapally, Praveen K.\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThe metal-organic framework Cu-BTC was evaluated for its ability to selectively interact with Lewis-base analytes, including explosives, by examining retention on GC columns packed with Chromosorb W HP that contained 3.0% SE-30 along with various loadings of Cu-BTC. SEM images of the support material showed the characteristic Cu-BTC crystals embedded in the SE-30 coating on the diatomaceous support. Results indicated that the Cu-BTC-containing stationary phase had limited thermal stability (220Â°C) and strong general retention for analytes. KovÃ¡ts index calculations showed selective retention (amounting to about 300 KovÃ¡ts units) relative to n-alkanes for many small Lewis-base analytes on a column thatmoreÂ Â» contained 0.75% Cu-BTC compared to an SE-30 control. Short columns that contained lower loadings of Cu-BTC (0.10%) were necessary to elute explosives and related analytes; however, selectivity was not observed for aromatic compounds (including nitroaromatics) or nitroalkanes. Observed retention characteristics are discussed.Â«Â less\n\nSeparation of natural product using columns packed with Fused-Core particles.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Peilin; Litwinski, George R; Pursch, Matthias; McCabe, Terry; Kuppannan, Krishna\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThree HPLC columns packed with 3 microm, sub-2 microm, and 2.7 microm Fused-Core (superficially porous) particles were compared in separation performance using two natural product mixtures containing 15 structurally related components. The Ascentis Express C18 column packed with Fused-Core particles showed an 18% increase in column efficiency (theoretical plates), a 76% increase in plate number per meter, a 65% enhancement in separation speed and a 19% increase in back pressure compared to the Atlantis T3 C18 column packed with 3 microm particles. Column lot-to-lot variability for critical pairs in the natural product mixture was observed with both columns, with the Atlantis T3 column exhibiting a higher degree of variability. The Ascentis Express column was also compared with the Acquity BEH column packed with sub-2 microm particles. Although the peak efficiencies obtained by the Ascentis Express column were only about 74% of those obtained by the Acquity BEH column, the 50% lower back pressure and comparable separation speed allowed high-efficiency and high-speed separation to be performed using conventional HPLC instrumentation.\n\n[Study for the revision of analytical method for tris (2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate with restriction in textiles].\n\nPubMed\n\nMimura, Mayumi; Nakashima, Harunobu; Yoshida, Jin; Yoshida, Toshiaki; Kawakami, Tsuyoshi; Isama, Kazuo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe official analytical method for tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate (TDBPP), which is banned from use in textile products by the \"Act on Control of Household Products Containing Harmful Substances\", requires revision. This study examined an analytical method for TDBPP by GC/MS using a capillary column. Thermal decomposition of TDBPP was observed by GC/MS measurement using capillary column, unlike in the case of gas chromatography/flame photometric detector (GC/FPD) measurement based on a direct injection method using a capillary megabore column. A quadratic curve, Y=2572X(1.416), was obtained for the calibration curve of GC/FPD in the concentration range 2.0-100 Î¼g/mL. The detection limit was 1.0 Î¼g/mL under S/N=3. The reproducibility for repetitive injections was satisfactory. A pretreatment method was established using methanol extraction, followed by liquid-liquid partition and purification with a florisil cartridge column. The recovery rate of this method was ï½100%. TDBPP was not detected in any of the five commercial products that this study analyzed. To understand the cause of TDBPP decomposition during GC/MS (electron ionization; EI) measurement using capillary column, GC/MS (chemical ionization; CI), GC/FPD, and gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) measurements were conducted. It was suggested that TDBPP might thermally decompose both during GC injection, especially through a splitless injection method, and in the column or ion sources. To attempt GC/MS measurement, an injection part comprising quartz liner was used and the column length was halved (15 m); thus, only one peak could be obtained.\n\nBiosensor for the enantioselective analysis of the thyroid hormones (+)-3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and (+)-3,3',5,5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T4).\n\nPubMed\n\nAboul-Enein, Hassan V; Stefan, Raluca-Ioana; Litescu, Simona; Radu, Gabriel Lucian\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAn amperometric biosensor based on L-aminoacid oxidase is proposed for enantioselective assay of (+)-3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3) and (+)-3,3',5,5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (L-T4), due to the fact that only the L enantiomer has the hormonal activity. The construction of the amperometric biosensor is simple and reproducible. The analytical information obtained from enantioselective analysis are reliable. The RSD <1% assured by using the amperometric biosensors for L enantiomers assay as raw materials, and from tablets, demonstrated their suitability for the analysis of T3 and T4 at ppb concentration levels.\n\nSignal Enhancement in HPLC/Micro-Coil NMR Using Automated Column Trapping\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDjukovic, Danijel; Liu, Shuhui; Henry, Ian; Tobias, Brian; Raftery, Daniel\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA new HPLC-NMR system is described that performs analytical separation, pre-concentration, and NMR spectroscopy in rapid succession. The central component of our method is the online pre-concentration sequence that improves the match between post-column analyte peak volume and the micro-coil NMR detection volume. Separated samples are collected on to a C18 guard column with a mobile phase composed of 90% D2O/10% acetonitrile-D3, and back-flashed to the NMR micro-coil probe with 90% acetonitrile-D3/10% D2O. In order to assess the performance of our unit, we separated a standard mixture of 1 mM ibuprofen, naproxen, and phenylbutazone using a commercially available C18 analytical column. The S/N measurements from the NMR acquisitions indicated that we achieved signal enhancement factors up to 10.4 (Â±1.2)-fold. Furthermore, we observed that pre-concentration factors increased as the injected amount of analyte decreased. The highest concentration enrichment of 14.7 (Â±2.2)-fold was attained injecting 100 Î¼L solution of 0.2 mM (~4 Î¼g) ibuprofen. PMID:17037915\n\nA novel approach to the simultaneous extraction and non-targeted analysis of the small molecules metabolome and lipidome using 96-well solid phase extraction plates with column-switching technology.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Yubo; Zhang, Zhenzhu; Liu, Xinyu; Li, Aizhu; Hou, Zhiguo; Wang, Yuming; Zhang, Yanjun\n\n2015-08-28\n\nThis study combines solid phase extraction (SPE) using 96-well plates with column-switching technology to construct a rapid and high-throughput method for the simultaneous extraction and non-targeted analysis of small molecules metabolome and lipidome based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This study first investigated the columns and analytical conditions for small molecules metabolome and lipidome, separated by an HSS T3 and BEH C18 columns, respectively. Next, the loading capacity and actuation duration of SPE were further optimized. Subsequently, SPE and column switching were used together to rapidly and comprehensively analyze the biological samples. The experimental results showed that the new analytical procedure had good precision and maintained sample stability (RSD<15%). The method was then satisfactorily applied to more widely analyze the small molecules metabolome and lipidome to test the throughput. The resulting method represents a new analytical approach for biological samples, and a highly useful tool for researches in metabolomics and lipidomics. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Generation of a pyroclastic flow caused by eruption column collapse is one of the most hazardous phenomena during explosive volcanic eruptions. The quantification of column collapse condition (CCC) is, therefore, highly desired for volcanic hazard assessment. Previously the CCC was roughly predicted by a simple relationship between magma discharge rate and water content (e.g., Carazzo et al., 2008). When a crater is present above the conduit, because of decompression/compression process inside/above the crater, the CCC based on this relationship can be strongly modified (Woods and Bower, 1995; Koyaguchi et al., 2010); however, the effects of the crater on CCC has not been fully understood in a quantitative fashion. Here, we have derived a semi-analytical expression of CCC, in which the effects of the crater is taken into account. The CCC depends on magma properties, crater shape (radius, depth and opening angle) as well as the flow rate at the base of crater. Our semi-analytical CCC expresses all these dependencies by a single surface in a parameter space of the dimensionless magma discharge rate, the dimensionless magma flow rate (per unit area) and the ratio of the cross-sectional areas at the top and the base of crater. We have performed a systematic parameter study of three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of eruption column dynamics to confirm the semi-analytical CCC. The results of the 3D simulations are consistent with the semi-analytical CCC, while they show some additional fluid dynamical features in the transitional state (e.g., partial column collapse). Because the CCC depends on such many parameters, the scenario towards the generation of pyroclastic flow during explosive eruptions is considered to be diverse. Nevertheless, our semi-analytical CCC together with the existing semi-analytical solution for the 1D conduit flow\n\nAnalytical and Experimental Assessment of Seismic Vulnerability of Beam-Column Joints without Transverse Reinforcement in Concrete Buildings\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHassan, Wael Mohammed\n\nBeam-column joints in concrete buildings are key components to ensure structural integrity of building performance under seismic loading. Earthquake reconnaissance has reported the substantial damage that can result from inadequate beam-column joints. In some cases, failure of older-type corner joints appears to have led to building collapse. Since the 1960s, many advances have been made to improve seismic performance of building components, including beam-column joints. New design and detailing approaches are expected to produce new construction that will perform satisfactorily during strong earthquake shaking. Much less attention has been focused on beam-column joints of older construction that may be seismically vulnerable. Concrete buildings constructed prior to developing details for ductility in the 1970s normally lack joint transverse reinforcement. The available literature concerning the performance of such joints is relatively limited, but concerns about performance exist. The current study aimed to improve understanding and assessment of seismic performance of unconfined exterior and corner beam-column joints in existing buildings. An extensive literature survey was performed, leading to development of a database of about a hundred tests. Study of the data enabled identification of the most important parameters and the effect of each parameter on the seismic performance. The available analytical models and guidelines for strength and deformability assessment of unconfined joints were surveyed and evaluated. In particular, The ASCE 41 existing building document proved to be substantially conservative in joint shear strength estimation. Upon identifying deficiencies in these models, two new joint shear strength models, a bond capacity model, and two axial capacity models designed and tailored specifically for unconfined beam-column joints were developed. The proposed models strongly correlated with previous test results.

Additionally, means are provided to thermally isolate the heated column from their surroundings.

Sample preparation involves an acidic extraction with methyl-t-butyl ether, performed in a 13 X 100 mm disposable glass tube, then a short second extraction of the organic phase with sodium hydroxide. After evaporation of the methyl-t-butyl ether, chromatography is performed on an \"Astec\" 2.0-mm (i.d.) octyl column. We compared results by this procedure with those by use of earlier larger-scale extractions and their respective 4.6-mm (i.d.) columns; analytical recoveries of cyclosporins A and D were comparable with previous findings and results for patients' specimens were equivalent, but the microbore columns provided greatly increased resolution and sensitivity.\n\nEnhanced capabilities of separation in Sequential Injection Chromatography--fused-core particle column and its comparison with narrow-bore monolithic column.\n\nPubMed\n\nChocholouÅ¡, Petr; KosaÅovÃ¡, Lucie; SatÃ­nskÃ½, Dalibor; SklenÃ¡ÅovÃ¡, Hana; Solich, Petr\n\n2011-08-15\n\nIn the Sequential Injection Chromatography (SIC) only monolithic columns for chromatographic separations have been used so far. This article presents the first use of fused-core particle packed column in an attempt to extend of the chromatographic capabilities of the SIC system. A new fused-core particle column (2.7 Î¼m) Ascentis(Â®) Express C18 (Supelcoâ¢ Analytical) 30 mm Ã 4.6 mm brings high separation efficiency within flow rates and pressures comparable to monolithic column Chromolith(Â®) Performance RP-18e 100-3 (Merck(Â®)) 100 mm Ã 3 mm. Both columns matches the conditions of the commercially produced SIC system - SIChromâ¢ (8-port high-pressure selection valve and medium-pressure Sapphireâ¢ syringe pump with 4 mL reservoir - maximal work pressure 1000 PSI) (FIAlab(Â®), USA). The system was tested by the separation of four estrogens with similar structure and an internal standard - ethylparaben. The mobile phase composed of acetonitrile/water (40/60 (v/v)) was pumped isocratic at flow rate 0.48 mL min(-1). Spectrophotometric detection was performed at wavelength of 225 nm and injected volume of sample solutions was 10 Î¼L. The chromatographic characteristics of both columns were compared. Obtained results and conclusions have shown that both fused-core particle column and longer narrow shaped monolithic column bring benefits into the SIC method. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Distinctive âthinâ and âthickâ stripes of dark CO staining reportedly respond selectively to stimulus variations in color and binocular disparity, respectively. Here, we first tested whether similar color-selective or disparity-selective stripes exist in human V2. If so, available evidence predicts that such stripes should (1) radiate âoutwardâ from the V1âV2 border, (2) interdigitate, (3) differ from each other in both thickness and length, (4) be spaced â¼3.5â4 mm apart (center-to-center), and, perhaps, (5) have segregated functional connections. Second, we tested whether analogous segregated columns exist in a ânext-higherâ tier area, V3. To answer these questions, we used high-resolution fMRI (1 Ã 1 Ã 1 mm3) at high field (7 T), presenting color-selective or disparity-selective stimuli, plus extensive signal averaging across multiple scan sessions and cortical surface-based analysis. All hypotheses were confirmed. V2 stripes and V3 columns were reliably localized in all subjects. The two stripe/column types were largely interdigitated (e.g., nonoverlapping) in both V2 and V3. Color-selective stripes differed from disparity-selective stripes in both width (thickness) and length. Analysis of resting-state functional connections (eyes closed) showed a stronger correlation between functionally alike (compared with functionally unlike) stripes/columns in V2 and V3. These results revealed a fine-scale segregation of color-selective or disparity-selective streams within human areas V2 and V3. Together with prior evidence from NHPs, this suggests that two parallel processing streams extend from visual subcortical regions through V1, V2, and V3.

The reduced longitudinal diffusion term (B) was measured using the peak parking (PP) method; the reduced solid-liquid mass transfer resistance term (C) was given by a combination of the PP results and the most accurate model of effective diffusion in ternary composite materials. The overall eddy diffusion term (A) was obtained by subtraction of these two HETP terms from the overall reduced HETP derived from the peak moments measured by numerical integration of the entire peak profiles. The results demonstrate that the dispersion of the column efficiencies is a result of the random nature of the packing process and the eddy diffusion term resulting from the lack of homogeneity of the column bed. At the highest reduced velocity achieved for small analytes, the relative standard deviations (RSD) of the eddy diffusion term for the 2.1mm I.D. columns were ca. 3 and 11% (with average values h(eddy)= 2.5 and 13.5) for naphthalene (k=3) and uracil (k=0), respectively. For the 4.6mm I.D. columns, these RSDs were 5 and 13%, respectively, with average values h(eddy)= 1.4 and 2.9. For insulin at reduced velocities as high as 160, the RSDs of the total reduced plate heights were 3 and 8% for the 2.1 and 4.6mm I.D. columns, respectively. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A side-by-side comparison of fluorocarbon column and eluents (F-column and F-eluents) with their hydrocarbon counterparts (H-column and H-eluents) in the separation of a group of 33 analytes, including 30 amino acids and 3 proteins, is conducted. The H-column and the F-column contain the n-C8H17 group and n-C8F17 group, respectively, in their stationary phases. The H-eluents include ethanol (EtOH) and isopropanol (ISP) while the F-eluents include trifluoroethanol (TFE) and hexafluorosopropanol (HFIP). The 2 columns and 4 eluents generated 8 (column, eluent) pairs that produce 264 retention time data points for the 33 analytes. A statistical analysis of the retention time data reveals that although the H-column is better than the F-column in analyte separation and H-eluents are better than F-eluents in analyte retention, the more critical factor is the proper pairing of column with eluent. Among the conditions explored in this project, optimal retention and separation is achieved when the fluorocarbon column is paired with ethanol, even though TFE is the most polar one among the 4 eluents. This result shows fluorocarbon columns have much potential in chromatographic analysis and separation of non-fluorinated amino acids and proteins.

In the KUL system, each column is described with four parameters, which enables estimation of the FKUL value characterising similarity of those parameters to the selected reference stationary phase. Thus, a ranking list based on the FKUL value can be calculated for the chosen reference column, then correlated with the results of the column performance test. In this study, the column performance test was based on analysis of moclobemide and its two metabolites in human plasma by liquid chromatography (LC), using 18 columns. The comparative study was performed using traditional correlation of the FKUL values with the retention parameters of the analytes describing the column performance test. In order to deepen the comparative assessment of both data sets, factor analysis (FA) was also used. The obtained results indicated that the stationary phase classes, closely related according to the KUL method, yielded comparable separation for the target substances. Therefore, the column ranking system based on the FKUL-values could be considered supportive in the choice of the appropriate column for biomedical analysis.\n\nFisheries Aspects of Seamounts and Taylor Columns\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1986-09-01\n\nthe armorhead population.

M.; Valentin, J. R.; Phillips, J. B.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe concept of a sample retention column that preserves the true time profile of an analyte of interest is studied. This storage system allows for the detection to be done at convenient times, as opposed to the nearly continuous monitoring that is required by other systems to preserve a sample time profile. The sample storage column is essentially a gas chromatography column, although its use is not the separation of sample components. The functions of the storage column are the selective isolation of the component of interest from the rest of the components present in the sample and the storage of this component as a function of time. Using octane as a test substance, the sample storage system was optimized with respect to such parameters as storage and readout temperature, flow rate through the storage column, column efficiency and storage time. A 3-h sample profile was collected and stored at 30 degrees C for 20 h. The profile was then retrieved, essentially intact, in 5 min at 130 degrees C.\n\nColumn Selection for Biomedical Analysis Supported by Column Classification Based on Four Test Parameters\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPlenis, Alina; Rekowska, Natalia; BÄ czek, Tomasz\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis article focuses on correlating the column classification obtained from the method created at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KUL), with the chromatographic resolution attained in biomedical separation.

Column permeability and changes of the eluent properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nGritti, Fabrice; Guiochon, Georges\n\n2008-04-11\n\nThe behavior of four similar liquid chromatography columns (2.1mm i.d. x 30, 50, 100, and 150 mm, all packed with fine particles, average d(p) approximately 1.7 microm, of bridged ethylsiloxane/silica hybrid-C(18), named BEH-C(18)) was studied in wide ranges of temperature and pressure. The pressure and the temperature dependencies of the viscosity and the density of the eluent (pure acetonitrile) along the columns were also derived, using the column permeabilities and applying the Kozeny-Carman and the heat balance equations. The heat lost through the external surface area of the chromatographic column was directly derived from the wall temperature of the stainless steel tube measured with a precision of +/-0.2 degrees C in still air and +/-0.1 degrees C in the oven compartment. The variations of the density and viscosity of pure acetonitrile as a function of the temperature and pressure was derived from empirical correlations based on precise experimental data acquired between 298 and 373 K and at pressures up to 1.5 kbar. The measurements were made with the Acquity UPLC chromatograph that can deliver a maximum flow rate of 2 mL/min and apply a maximum column inlet pressure of 1038 bar. The average Kozeny-Carman permeability constant of the columns was 144+/-3.5%. The temperature hence the viscosity and the density profiles of the eluent along the column deviate significantly from linear behavior under high-pressure gradients. For a 1000 bar pressure drop, we measured DeltaT=25-30 K, (Deltaeta/eta) approximately 100%, and (Deltarho/rho) approximately 10%. These results show that the radial temperature profiles are never fully developed within 1% for any of the columns, even under still-air conditions. This represents a practical advantage regarding the apparent column efficiency at high flow rates, since the impact of the differential analyte velocity between the column center and the column wall is not maximum.

Various AlMA/DVB ratios were investigated to prepare a series of 30% AlMA-DVB monolithic stationary phases in fused-silica capillaries (250-Î¼m i.d.). The physical properties (such as porosity, permeability, and column efficiency) of the synthesized AlMA-DVB monolithic columns were investigated for characterization. Isocratic elution of phenol derivatives was first employed to evaluate the suitability of the prepared AlMA-DVB columns for small molecule separation. The run-to-run (0.16-1.20%, RSD; nÂ =Â 3) and column-to-column (0.26-2.95%, RSD; nÂ =Â 3) repeatabilities on retention times were also examined using the selected AlMA-DVB monolithic columns. The Ï-Ï interactions between the aromatic ring and the DVB-based stationary phase offered better recognition on polar analytes with aromatic moieties, which resulted in better separation resolution of aromatic analytes on the AlMA-DVB monolithic columns. In order to demonstrate the capability of potential environmental and/or food safety applications, eight phenylurea herbicides with single benzene ring and seven sulfonamide antibiotics with polyaromatic moieties were analyzed using the selected AlMA-DVB monolithic columns.

L. (Principal Investigator)\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA chromatographic method for the quantitation of promethazine (PMZ) and its three metabolites in urine employing on-line solid-phase extraction and column-switching has been developed. The column-switching system described here uses an extraction column for the purification of PMZ and its metabolites from a urine matrix. The extraneous matrix interference was removed by flushing the extraction column with a gradient elution. The analytes of interest were then eluted onto an analytical column for further chromatographic separation using a mobile phase of greater solvent strength. This method is specific and sensitive with a range of 3.75-1400 ng/ml for PMZ and 2.5-1400 ng/ml for the metabolites promethazine sulfoxide, monodesmethyl promethazine sulfoxide and monodesmethyl promethazine. The lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ) were 3.75 ng/ml with less than 6.2% C.V. for PMZ and 2.50 ng/ml with less than 11.5% C.V. for metabolites based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1 or greater. The accuracy and precision were within +/- 11.8% in bias and not greater than 5.5% C.V. in intra- and inter-assay precision for PMZ and metabolites. Method robustness was investigated using a Plackett-Burman experimental design.

T.; Balcom, P. H.; Mason, R. P.; Chen, C.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nEstuarine water column methylmercury (MeHg) is an important driver of bioaccumulation in pelagic organisms so it is important to understand the sources and cycling of MeHg. As MeHg biomagnifies in food webs, increased water column concentrations can be transferred to fish consumed by humans. Few studies have taken a multi-estuary approach to look at MeHg cycling in the water column of these important MeHg producing areas. We examined the distributions and partitioning of sediment and water column MeHg across a geographic range of estuaries. In 2008 we sampled 10 shallow-water estuarine sites from Maine to New Jersey, sampled 11 sites in 4 estuaries in 2009, and sampled at 3 estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) sites in 1 estuary in 2012. Sediment measurements included both solid phase and pore water MeHg and total mercury (HgT). Water column parameters included dissolved and particulate MeHg and HgT, total suspended solids, nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon. Average suspended particle MeHg was highest at Wells (ME; 6 to 11.5 pmol/g; 4.5 to 7% of HgT) and lowest at Portsmouth (NH) and in Long Island Sound (CT-NY; 0.2 to 5.5 pmol/g; 0.25 to 3.75% of HgT). Average water column dissolved MeHg was highest in the Delaware River ETM (0.5 to 0.7 pM; 16 to 24% of HgT) and lowest at Portsmouth (0.06 to 0.12 pM; 1 to 2% of HgT). Significant positive correlations were found between MeHg and HgT across multiple estuaries in both sediment and the water column in 2008 and 2009. In contrast, water column dissolved and suspended particle MeHg do not correlate well with sediment MeHg or HgT, pore water MeHg or methylation rates in sediment across estuaries, indicating that sediment is often not a good predictor of water MeHg levels. However, ratios of average dissolved:pore water MeHg and suspended particle:sediment MeHg are close to 1 in the Delaware River ETM, suggesting that sediment supplies MeHg to the water column in this turbulent region, but average pore water MeHg was\n\nTank 241-T-204, core 188 analytical results for the final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNuzum, J.L.\n\nTANK 241-T-204, CORE 188, ANALYTICAL RESULTS FOR THE FINAL REPORT.

The maximum efficiency is that of an infinitely long column operated at infinitely small flow rates. It is determined by the maximum allowable system pressure, the column permeability (particle size), the viscosity of the eluent, and the intensity of the effective diffusivity of the analytes along the column. Alternatively, the twin-column recycling separation process (TCRSP) can overcome the efficiency limit of the single-column approach. In the TCRSP, the sample mixture may be transferred from one to a second (twin) column until its band has spread over one column length. Basic theory of chromatography is used to confirm that the speed-resolution performance of the TCRSP is intrinsically superior to that of the single-column process. This advantage is illustrated in this work by developing an automated TCRSP for the challenging separation of two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) isomers (benzo[a]anthracene and chrysene) in the reversed-phase retention mode at pressure smaller than 5000psi. The columns used are the 3.0mmÃ150mm column packed with 3.5Î¼m XBridge BEH-C 18 material (Î±=1.010) and the 3.0mm or 4.6mmÃ150mm columns packed with the same 3.5Î¼m XSelect HSST 3 material (Î±=1.025). The isocratic mobile phase is an acetonitrile-water mixture (80/20, v/v). Remarkably, significant differences are observed between the predicted retention times and efficiencies of the ideal TCRSP (given by the number of cycles multiplied by the retention time and efficiency of one column) and those of the real TCRSP. The fundamental explanation lies in the pressure-dependent retention of these PAHs or in the change of their partial molar volume as they are transferred from the mobile to the stationary phase.

Using an optimized analytical system, a commercially available Al 2 O 3 porous layer open tubular (PLOT) capillary column (30Â mÂ ÃÂ 0.25Â mm) deactivated with Na 2 SO 4 was used for separation of PFCs. Improvements in the separation of PFCs, the corresponding identification and the limit of detection of PFCs using this method and column are presented. The method was successfully applied to determine the atmospheric background concentrations of a range of PFCs from a number of samples collected at a rural site in Germany. The results of this study suggest that the method outlined using the Al 2 O 3 -PLOT-S capillary column has good sensitivity and selectivity, and that it can be deployed in a routine laboratory process for the analysis of PFCs in the future research work. In addition, the ability of this column to separate the isomers of one of the lower boiling PFCs (perfluorodimethylcyclobutane) and its ability to resolve perfluoroethylcyclohexane offer the opportunity for single-column analysis for multiple PFCs.\n\nLocal buckling of composite channel columns\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSzymczak, CzesÅaw; Kujawa, Marcin\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe investigation concerns local buckling of compressed flanges of axially compressed composite channel columns. Cooperation of the member flange and web is taken into account here. The buckling mode of the member flange is defined by rotation angle a flange about the line of its connection with the web. The channel column under investigation is made of unidirectional fibre-reinforced laminate. Two approaches to member orthotropic material modelling are performed: the homogenization with the aid of theory of mixture and periodicity cell or homogenization upon the Voigt-Reuss hypothesis. The fundamental differential equation of local buckling is derived with the aid of the stationary total potential energy principle. The critical buckling stress corresponding to a number of buckling half-waves is assumed to be a minimum eigenvalue of the equation. Some numerical examples dealing with columns are given here. The analytical results are compared with the finite element stability analysis carried out by means of ABAQUS software. The paper is focused on a close analytical solution of the critical buckling stress and the associated buckling mode while the web-flange cooperation is assumed.\n\nSimple column-switching ion chromatography method for determining eight monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in honeydew and nectar.\n\nPubMed\n\nNi, Chengzhu; Zhu, Binhe; Wang, Nani; Wang, Muhua; Chen, Suqing; Zhang, Jiajie; Zhu, Yan\n\n2016-03-01\n\nHoneydew is excreted by aphids as a sweet waste and nectar is floral honey. Honeydew and nectar are complicated samples which consist of various sugars and amino acids. In this work, a simple ion chromatography with column-switching method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of 8 monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in honeydew and nectar. A reversed-phase column was used as a pretreatment column to eliminate organics on-line and sugars were eluted from a collection loop to analytical column by using column-switching technique. This method showed good linearity (râ©¾0.9994) and afforded low limits of detection ranging from 1.55 to 10.17Î¼gL(-1) for all the analytes. Recoveries ranged from 95% to 105% and repeatability results were acceptable with relative standard deviation of less than 3.21% (n=6). This method was successfully applied to quantification of these sugars in honeydew and nectar. These results showed honeydew had much more oligosaccharides than nectar.

A segmented flow outlet fitting allows for the separation of solvent or solute that elutes along the central radial section of the column from that of the sample or solvent that elutes along the wall region of the column. Separation efficiency on the analytical scale is increased by 25% with an increase in sensitivity by as much as 52% compared to conventional separations.\n\nA design procedure for a tension-wire stiffened truss-column\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGreene, W. H.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nA deployable, tension wire stiffened, truss column configuration was considered for space structure applications. An analytical procedure, developed for design of the truss column and exercised in numerical studies, was based on equivalent beam stiffness coefficients in the classical analysis for an initially imperfect beam column. Failure constraints were formulated to be used in a combined weight/strength and nonlinear mathematical programming automated design procedure to determine the minimum mass column for a particular combination of design load and length. Numerical studies gave the mass characteristics of the truss column for broad ranges of load and length. Comparisons of the truss column with a baseline tubular column used a special structural efficiency parameter for this class of columns.\n\nLong-range attraction of an ultrarelativistic electron beam by a column of neutral plasma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdli, E.; LindstrÃ¸m, C.

In experiments performed at the FACET test facility at SLAC we observe that an electron beam moving parallel to a neutral plasma column, at an initial distance of many plasma column radii, is attracted into the column. Once the beam enters the plasma it drives a plasma wake similar to that of an electron beam entering the plasma column head-on. A simple analytical model is developed in order to capture the essential physics of the attractive force. The attraction is further studied by 3D particle-in-cell numerical simulations. The results are an important step towards better understanding of particle beam-plasma interactions in general and plasma wakefield accelerator technology in particular.\n\nRapid and sensitive analytical method for monitoring of 12 organotin compounds in natural waters.\n\nPubMed\n\nVahÄiÄ, Mitja; MilaÄiÄ, Radmila; SÄanÄar, Janez\n\n2011-03-01\n\nA rapid analytical method for the simultaneous determination of 12 different organotin compounds (OTC): methyl-, butyl-, phenyl- and octyl-tins in natural water samples was developed. It comprises of in situ derivatisation (by using NaBEt4) of OTC in salty or fresh water sample matrix adjusted to pH 6 with Tris-citrate buffer, extraction of ethylated OTC into hexane, separation of OTC in organic phase on 15 m GC column and subsequent quantitative determination of separated OTC by ICP-MS. To optimise the pH of ethylation, phosphate, carbonate and Tris-citrate buffer were investigated alternatively to commonly applied sodium acetate - acetic acid buffer. The ethylation yields in Tris-citrate buffer were found to be better for TBT, MOcT and DOcT in comparison to commonly used acetate buffer. Iso-octane and hexane were examined as organic phase for extraction of ethylated OTC. The advantage of hexane was in its ability for quantitative determination of TMeT. GC column of 15 m in length was used for separation of studied OTC under the optimised separation conditions and its performances compared to 30 m column. The analytical method developed enables sensitive simultaneous determination of 12 different OTC and appreciably shortened analysis time in larger series of water samples. LOD's obtained for the newly developed method ranged from 0.05-0.06 ng Sn L-1 for methyl-, 0.11-0.45 ng Sn L-1 for butyl-, 0.11-0.16 ng Sn L-1 for phenyl-, and 0.07-0.10 ng Sn L-1 for octyl-tins. By applying the developed analytical method, marine water samples from the Northern Adriatic Sea containing mainly butyl- and methyl-tin species were analysed to confirm the proposed method's applicability.\n\nSolid-phase extraction of polar pesticides from environmental water samples on graphitized carbon and Empore-activated carbon disks and on-line coupling to octadecyl-bonded silica analytical columns.\n\nPubMed\n\nSlobodnÃ­k, J; Oztezkizan, O; Lingeman, H; Brinkman, U A\n\n1996-10-25\n\nThe suitability of Empore-activated carbon disks (EACD), Envi-Carb graphitized carbon black (GCB) and CPP-50 graphitized carbon for the trace enrichment of polar pesticides from water samples was studied by means of off-line and on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE). In the off-line procedure, 0.5-2 l samples spiked with a test mixture of oxamyl, methomyl and aldicarb sulfoxide were enriched on EnviCarb SPE cartridges or 47 mm diameter EACD and eluted with dichloromethane-methanol. After evaporation, a sample was injected onto a C18-bonded silica column and analysed by liquid chromatography with ultraviolet (LC-UV) detection. EACD performed better than EnviCarb cartridges in terms of breakthrough volumes (> 2 l for all test analytes), reproducibility (R.S.D. of recoveries, 4-8%, n = 3) and sampling speed (100 ml/min); detection limits in drinking water were 0.05-0.16 microgram/l. In the on-line experiments, 4.6 mm diameter pieces cut from original EACD and stacked onto each other in a 9 mm long precolumn, and EnviCarb and CPP-50 packed in 10 x 2.0 mm I.D. precolumn, were tested, and 50-200 ml spiked water samples were preconcentrated. Because of the peak broadening caused by the strong sorption of the analytes on carbon, the carbon-packed precolumns were eluted by a separate stream of 0.1 ml/min acetonitrile which was mixed with the gradient LC eluent in front of the C18 analytical column. The final on-line procedure was also applied for the less polar propoxur, carbaryl and methiocarb. EnviCarb could not be used due to its poor pressure resistance. CPP-50 provided less peak broadening than EACD: peak widths were 0.1-0.3 min and R.S.D. of peak heights 4-14% (n = 3). In terms of analyte trapping efficiency on-line SPE-LC-UV with a CPP-50 precolumn also showed better performance than when Bondesil C18/OH or polymeric PLRP-S was used, but chromatographic resolution was similar. With the CPP-50-based system, detection limits of the test compounds were 0.05-1 microgram\n\nMonolithic column modified with bifunctional ionic liquid and styrene stationary phases for capillary electrochromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nMao, Zhenkun; Chen, Zilin\n\n2017-01-13\n\nA novel monolithic column with ionic liquid and styrene-modified bifunctional group was prepared for capillary electrochromatography (CEC) by in situ copolymerization in a ternary porogenic solvent. Ionic liquid (1-allyl-methylimidazolium chloride, AlMeIm + Cl - ) and styrene served as the bifunctional monomer, while ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) was used as the cross-linker. The monomer of AlMeIm + Cl - was introduced as anion-exchange group, while styrene as hydrophobic and aromatic group; the similar conjugated structure in AlMeIm + Cl - and styrene was beneficial for offeing obvious synergistic effect. The bifunctional stationary phase possessed powerful selectivity for the separation of neutral compounds, acidic analytes and phenols. The highest column efficiency was 2.70Ã10 5 platesm -1 (theoretical plates, N) for toluene. A relatively strong electroosmotic flow (EOF) was obtained in a wide range of pH values from 2.0 to 12.0, which could successfully achieve the rapid separation of the analytes within 10min. The proposed monolithic column was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). The results indicated that the resultant monolithic column had good permeability and excellent mechanical stability. Good reproducibility was obtained with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the retention time in the range of 0.24-0.47% and 0.81-2.17% for run-to-run (n=5) and day-to-day (n=5), while 1.09-2.70% and 0.98-1.70% for column-to-column (n=3) and batch-to-batch (n=3), respectively. The combination of AlMeIm + Cl - and styrene was a promising option in the fabrication of the organic polymer monolithic column. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is especially important for modern analytical columns packed with small particles, where wall effects dominate the band broadening. Detailed knowledge about the packing microstructure of packed analytical columns has so far not been acquired. Here, we present the first three-dimensional reconstruction protocol for these columns utilizing focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) on a commercial 2.1mm inner diameterÃ50mm length narrow-bore analytical column packed with 1.7Î¼m bridged-ethyl hybrid silica particles. Two sections from the packed bed are chosen for reconstruction by FIB-SEM: one from the bulk packing region of the column and one from its critical wall region. This allows quantification of structural differences between the wall region and the center of the bed due to effects induced by the hard, confining column wall. Consequences of these effects on local flow velocity in the column are analyzed with flow simulations utilizing the lattice-Boltzmann method. The reconstructions of the bed structures reveal significant structural differences in the wall region (extending radially over approximately 62 particle diameters) compared to the center of the column. It includes the local reduction of the external porosity by up to 10% and an increase of the mean particle diameter by up to 3%, resulting in a decrease of the local flow velocity by up to 23%. In addition, four (more ordered) layers of particles in the direct vicinity of the column wall induce local velocity fluctuations by up to a factor of three regarding the involved velocity amplitudes. These observations highlight the impact of radial variations in packing microstructure on band migration and column performance. This knowledge on morphological peculiarities of column wall effects helps guiding us towards further optimization of the packing process for analytical\n\n3D-Printing for Analytical Ultracentrifugation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDesai, Abhiksha; Krynitsky, Jonathan; Pohida, Thomas J.; Zhao, Huaying\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAnalytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a classical technique of physical biochemistry providing information on size, shape, and interactions of macromolecules from the analysis of their migration in centrifugal fields while free in solution. A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by 3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but still below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication paradigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a variety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource allocation.

A non-polar poly(5%-phenyl-95%-methyl)siloxane column (40 m x 100 microm x 0.1 microm) and a polar 70%-cyanopropyl-polysilphenylene-siloxane column (4 m x 0.1 mm x 0.1 microm) were used as (1)D and (2)D columns, respectively. The effluents from both the (1)D column and the (1)D+(2)D column series were monitored independently by two FIDs. Data from the (1)D and (1)D+(2)D integration reports were used to evaluate the NMT experiment. (1)D retention times, t(R,i,D1), were directly accessible from (1)D integration report while (2)D retention times, t(R,i,B), were calculated for all corresponding peak pairs from (1)D and (1)D+(2)D integration reports as a difference t(R,i,D2)=t(R,i,D1+D2)-t(R,i,D1). Search for corresponding peaks of PCB congeners in the (1)D and (1)D+(2)D chromatograms is elucidated in detail on standard PCB samples and on PCB congeners present in the technical formulation Arochlor 1242. Both retention times (t(R,i,D1) and t(R,i,D2)) as well as peak widths at half height (w(h,i)) and peak heights (h(i)) obtained from integration reports were used to construct 2D and 3D images for PCB NMT separations on serially coupled columns. The performance of the NMT procedure is illustrated by the separation of (i) standard PCB solutions, (ii) a mixture of the 209 PCBs, and (iii) a mixture of Arochlor 1242 and hydrocarbons on the DB-5+BPX-70 column series.

Major advances have been made in the column chemistry and suppressor technology in ion chromatography (IC) to handle a variety of sample matrices and ions. However, if the samples contain high concentrations of matrix ions, the overloaded peak elution profile is distorted. Consequently, the trace peaks shift their positions in the chromatogram in a manner that depends on the peak shape of the overloading analyte. In this work, the peak shapes in IC are examined from a fundamental perspective. Three commercial IC columns AS16, AS18, and AS23 were studied with borate, hydroxide and carbonate as suppressible eluents. Monovalent ions (chloride, bromide, and nitrate) are used as model analytes under analytical (0.1 mM) to overload conditions (10-500 mM). Both peak fronting and tailing are observed. On the basis of competitive Langmuir isotherms, if the eluent anion is more strongly retained than the analyte ion on an ion exchanger, the analyte peak is fronting. If the eluent is more weakly retained on the stationary phase, the analyte peak always tails under overload conditions regardless of the stationary phase capacity. If the charge of the analyte and eluent anions are different (e.g., Br(-) vs CO3(2-)), the analyte peak shapes depend on the eluent concentration in a more complex pattern. It was shown that there are interesting similarities with peak distortions due to strongly retained mobile phase components in other modes of liquid chromatography.\n\nCyclodextrins as a chiral mobile phase additive in nano-liquid chromatography: comparison of reversed-phase silica monolithic and particulate capillary columns.\n\nPubMed\n\nRocco, Anna; MaruÅ¡ka, Audrius; Fanali, Salvatore\n\n2012-03-01\n\nEnantioseparations of racemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, suprofen, indoprofen, cicloprofen, and carprofen) were performed by nano-liquid chromatography, employing achiral capillary columns and heptakis(2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-Î²-cyclodextrin (TM-Î²-CD) or hydroxylpropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (HP-Î²-CD) as a chiral mobile phase additive (CMPA). Working under the same experimental conditions (in terms of mobile phase and linear velocity), the performance of a RP-C18 monolithic column was compared with that of a RP-C18 packed column of the same dimensions (100 Î¼m i.d. Ã 10 cm). Utilizing a mobile phase composed of 30% ACN (v/v) buffered with 50 mM sodium acetate at pH 3, and containing 30 mM TM-Î²-CD, the monolithic column provided faster analysis but lower resolution than the packed column. This behavior was ascribed to the high permeability of the monolithic column, as well as to its minor selectivity. HP-Î²-CD was chosen as an alternative to TM-Î²-CD. Employing the monolithic column, the effects of different parameters such as HP-Î²-CD concentration, mobile phase composition, and pH on the retention factor and the chiral resolution of the analytes were studied. For the most of the analytes, enantioresolution (which ranged from R(s)â= 1.80 for naproxen to R(s)â= 0.86 for flurbiprofen) was obtained with a mobile phase consisting of sodium acetate buffer (25 mM, pH 3), 10% MeOH, and 15 mM HP-Î²-CD. When the same experimental conditions were used with the packed column, no compound eluted within 1 h. Upon increasing the percentage of organic modifier to favor analyte elution, only suprofen eluted within 30 min, with an R(s) value of 1.14 (20% MeOH). Replacing MeOH with ACN resulted in a loss of enantioresolution, except for naproxen (R(s)â= 0.89).\n\nDesulfurization of coal by microbial column flotation.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhmura, N; Saiki, H\n\n1994-06-05\n\nTwenty-three strains capable of oxidizing iron were isolated from coal and ore storage sites as well as coal and ore mines, volcanic areas, and hot spring. Four strains were found to have high iron-oxidizing activity. One strain (T-4) was selected for this experiment since the strain showed the fastest leaching rate of iron and sulfate from pyrite among the four strains. The T-4 strain was assigned for Thiobacillus ferrooxidans from its cultural and morphological characteristics.Bacterial treatment was applied to column flotation. An increase of cell density in the microbial column flotation resulted in the increase of pyrite removal from a coal-pyrite mixture (high sulfur imitated coal) with corresponding decrease of coal recovery. The addition of kerosene into the microbial column flotation increased the recovery of the imitated coal from 55% (without kerosene) to 81% (with 50 microL/L kerosene) with the reduction of pyrite sulfur content from 11% (feed coal) to 3.9% (product coal). The kerosene addition could reduce the pyritic sulfur content by collecting the coal in the recovery. However, the addition could not enhance separation of pyrite from the coal-pyrite mixture, since pyrite rejection was not affected by the increase of the kerosene addition. An excellent separation was obtained by the microbial flotation using a long column which had a length-diameter (L/D) ratio of 12.7. The long column flotation reduced the pyritic sulfur content from 11% (feed coal) to 1.8% (product coal) when 80% of the feed coal was recovered without the kerosene addition. The long column flotation not only attained an excellent separation but also reduced the amount of cells for desulfurization to as little as one-tenth of the reported amount.\n\nSU-D-213AB-05: Commissioning a CT Compatible LDR T&O Applicator Using Analytical Calculation with ID and 3D Dosimetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdamson, J; Newton, J; Steffey, B; Cai, J; Adamovics, J; Oldham, M; Chino, J; Craciunescu, O\n\n2012-06-01\n\nTo determine the characteristics of a new commercially available CT-compatible LDR Tandem and Ovoid (T&O) applicator using 3D dosimetry. We characterized source attenuation through the asymmetric gold shielding in the buckets by measuring dose with diode and 3D dosimetry and compared to an analytical line integral calculation. For 3D dosimetry, a cylindrical PRESAGE dosimeter (9.5cm diameter, 9.2cm height) with a central 6mm channel bored for source placement was scanned with the Duke Large field of view Optical CT-Scanner (DLOS) before and after delivering a nominal 7.7Gy at a distance of 1 cm using a Cs-137 source loaded in the bucket. The optical CT scan time lasted approximately 15 minutes during which 720 projections were acquired at 0.5Â° increments, anda 3D dose distribution was reconstructed with a 0.5mm 3 isotropic voxel size. The 3D dose distribution was applied to a CT-based T&O implant to determine effect of ovoid shielding on the dose delivered to ICRU 38 Point A as well as D2cc of the bladder, rectum, bowel, and sigmoid. Dose transmission through the gold shielding at a radial distance of 1-3cm from midplane of the source was 86.6%, 86.1, and 87.0% for analytical calculation, diode, and 3D dosimetry, respectively. For the gold shielding of the bucket, dose transmission calculated using the 3D dosimetrymeasurement was found to be lowest at oblique angles from the bucket witha minimum of â¼51%. For the patient case, attenuation from the buckets leadto a decrease in average Point A dose of â¼4% and decrease in D2cc to bladder, rectum, sigmoid, and bowel of 2%, 15%, 2%, and 7%, respectively. The measured 3D dose distribution provided unique insight to the dosimetry and shielding characteristics of the investigated applicator, the technique for which can be applied to commissioning of other brachytherapy applicators.

This transform uses the Fourier strategy for the computation of the associated 3-D discrete Radon transform. The innovative step is the definition of a discrete 3-D transform with the discrete analytical geometry theory by the construction of 3-D discrete analytical lines in the Fourier domain. We propose two types of 3-D discrete lines: 3-D discrete radial lines going through the origin defined from their orthogonal projections and 3-D planes covered with 2-D discrete line segments. These discrete analytical lines have a parameter called arithmetical thickness, allowing us to define a 3-D DART adapted to a specific application. Indeed, the 3-D DART representation is not orthogonal, It is associated with a flexible redundancy factor. The 3-D DART has a very simple forward/inverse algorithm that provides an exact reconstruction without any iterative method. In order to illustrate the potentiality of this new discrete transform, we apply the 3-D DART and its extension to the Local-DART (with smooth windowing) to the denoising of 3-D image and color video. These experimental results show that the simple thresholding of the 3-D DART coefficients is efficient.\n\nAnalytical evaluation of point of care cTnT and clinical performances in an unselected population as compared with central laboratory highly sensitive cTnT.\n\nPubMed\n\nDupuy, Anne Marie; Sebbane, Mustapha; Roubille, FranÃ§ois; Coste, Thibault; Bargnoux, Anne Sophie; Badiou, StÃ©phanie; Kuster, Nils; Cristol, Jean Paul\n\n2015-03-01\n\nTo report the analytical performances of the Radiometer AQT90 FLEXÂ® cTnT assay (Neuilly-Plaisance, France) and to evaluate the concordance with hs-cTnT results from central laboratory for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at baseline and during a short follow-up among unselected patients admitted in emergency room or cardiology department. Analytical performances of AQT90 FLEXÂ® cTnT immunoassay included imprecision study with determination of a coefficient of variation at 10% and 20%, linearity, and limit of detection. The concordance study was based on samples obtained from 170 consecutive patients with chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) admitted in the emergency room or cardiology department. The kinetic study (within 62 additional samples 3h later) was based on absolute delta criterion and the combination of relative change of 30% with absolute change of 7ng/L. The cTnT assay from Radiometer was evaluated as clinically usable, although less sensitive than the Roche hs-cTnT assay as demonstrated by the concordance and the kinetic studies. In non-selected population, the cTnT AQT FlexÂ© assay on AQT90Â© with kinetic change at 3h, provides similar clinical classification of patients, particularly for AMI group as compared to central laboratory hs-cTnT assay and could be suitable for clinical use.

Desired analytes are allowed to migrate continuously through the column under the electric field while undesired analytes are confined to the inlet vial by application of a hydrodynamic counter pressure. Using pressure ramping and buffer replenishment techniques, 18% of the total amount present in a bulk sample can be purified when the resolution to the adjacent peak is approximately 3. With a higher resolution, the yield could be further improved. Additionally, by periodically introducing fresh buffer into the sample, changes in pH and conductivity can be mediated, allowing higher purity (>or=99.5%) to be preserved in the collected fractions. With an additional reversed cycle of flow counterbalanced capillary electrophoresis, any individual component in a sample mixture can be purified providing it can be separated in an electrophoresis system.\n\nEnsuring repeatability and robustness of poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) HPLC monolithic columns of 3 mm id through covalent bonding to the column wall.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaaniste, Asko; Kruve, Anneli; Leito, Ivo\n\n2013-08-01\n\nTwo different methods to reinforce the poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) HPLC monolithic columns of 3 mm id in a glass column reservoir were studied: composite columns with polymeric particles in the monolith and surface treatment of the reservoir wall. Of the two methods used to counter the mechanical instability and formation of flow channels (composite columns and column wall surface treatment), we demonstrated that proper column wall surface treatment was sufficient to solve both problems. Our study also indicated that no surface treatment is efficient, and of the methods studied silanization in acidified ethanol solution and constant renewal of the reaction mixture (dynamic mode) proved to be the most effective. As a result of this study, we have been able to prepare repeatable and durable methacrylate HPLC columns with good efficiencies. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

S.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThis work presents an analytical study and experimental study on the behaviour and ultimate load carrying capacity of axially compressed self-compacting concrete-filled steel tubular columns. Results of tests conducted by various researchers on 213 samples concrete-filled steel tubular columns are reported and present authors experimental data are reported. Two theoretical equations were derived for the prediction of the ultimate axial load strength of concrete-filled steel tubular columns. The results from prediction were compared with the experimental data. Validation to the experimental results was made.\n\n3.

L.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe potential is investigated that precipitation scavenging of HCl from large solid rocket exhaust clouds may result in unacceptably acidic rain in the Cape Canaveral, Florida, area before atmospheric dispersion reduces HCl concentrations to safe limits. Several analytic expressions for HCl(g) and HCl(g + aq) washout are derived; a geometric mean washout coefficient is recommended. A previous HCl washout model is refined and applied to a space shuttle case (70 t HCl exhausted up to 4 km) and eight Titan 3 (60 percent less exhaust) dispersion ca"
