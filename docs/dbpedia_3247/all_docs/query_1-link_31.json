        "text": "HPLC separation of triacylglycerol positional isomers on a polymeric ODS column.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuroda, Ikuma; Nagai, Toshiharu; Mizobe, Hoyo; Yoshimura, Nobuhito; Gotoh, Naohiro; Wada, Shun\n\n2008-07-01\n\nA polymeric ODS column was applied to the resolution of triacylglycerol positional isomers (TAG-PI), i.e. 1,3-dioleoyl-2-palmitoyl-glycerol (OPO) and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-palmitoyl-rac-glycerol (OOP), with a recycle HPLC system. To investigate the ODS column species and the column temperatures for the resolution of a TAG-PI pair, a mixture of OPO and OOP was subjected to an HPLC system equipped with a non-endcapped polymeric, endcapped monomeric, endcapped intermediate, or non-endcapped monomeric ODS column at three different column temperatures (40, 25, or 10 degrees C). Only the non-endcapped polymeric ODS column achieved the separation of OPO and OOP, and the lowest column temperature (10 degrees C) showed the best resolution for them. The other pair of TAG-PI, a mixture of 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol (POP) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-oleoyl-rac-glycerol (PPO) was also subjected to the system equipped with a non-endcapped polymeric or monomeric ODS column at five different column temperatures (40, 32, 25, 17, and 10 degrees C). Thus, POP and PPO were also separated on only the non-endcapped polymeric ODS column at 25 degrees C. However, no clear peak appeared at 10 degrees C. These results would indicate that the polymeric ODS stationary phase has an ability to recognize the structural differences between TAG-PI pairs. Also, the column temperature is a very important factor for separating the TAG-PI pair, and the optimal temperature would relate to the solubility of TAG-PI in the mobile phase. Furthermore, the recycle HPLC system provided measurements for the separation and analysis of TAG-PI pairs.\n\nSEPARATION OF OCTYLPHENOL POLYETHER ALCOHOLS SURFACTANTS BY CAPILLARY COLUMN AND HPLC\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nSeparation of nonionic octylphenol polyether alcohols (OPA) by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and HPLC is described. sing a density programming and a 50-pm i.d. capillary column, a total of 18 group oligomers was separated. he effects of the operating parameters, such a...\n\nSEPARATION OF OCTYLPHENOL POLYETHER ALCOHOLS SURFACTANTS BY CAPILLARY COLUMN SFC AND HPLC\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nSeparation of nonionic octylphenol polyether alcohols (OPA) by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and HPLC is described.

The Ascentis Express C18 column packed with Fused-Core particles showed an 18% increase in column efficiency (theoretical plates), a 76% increase in plate number per meter, a 65% enhancement in separation speed and a 19% increase in back pressure compared to the Atlantis T3 C18 column packed with 3 microm particles. Column lot-to-lot variability for critical pairs in the natural product mixture was observed with both columns, with the Atlantis T3 column exhibiting a higher degree of variability. The Ascentis Express column was also compared with the Acquity BEH column packed with sub-2 microm particles. Although the peak efficiencies obtained by the Ascentis Express column were only about 74% of those obtained by the Acquity BEH column, the 50% lower back pressure and comparable separation speed allowed high-efficiency and high-speed separation to be performed using conventional HPLC instrumentation.\n\nThe Effect of Column and Eluent Fluorination on the Retention and Separation of non-Fluorinated Amino Acids and Proteins by HPLC\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJoyner, Katherine; Wang, Weizhen; Yu, Yihua Bruce\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe effect of column and eluent fluorination on the retention and separation of non-fluorinated amino acids and proteins in HPLC is investigated. A side-by-side comparison of fluorocarbon column and eluents (F-column and F-eluents) with their hydrocarbon counterparts (H-column and H-eluents) in the separation of a group of 33 analytes, including 30 amino acids and 3 proteins, is conducted. The H-column and the F-column contain the n-C8H17 group and n-C8F17 group, respectively, in their stationary phases. The H-eluents include ethanol (EtOH) and isopropanol (ISP) while the F-eluents include trifluoroethanol (TFE) and hexafluorosopropanol (HFIP). The 2 columns and 4 eluents generated 8 (column, eluent) pairs that produce 264 retention time data points for the 33 analytes. A statistical analysis of the retention time data reveals that although the H-column is better than the F-column in analyte separation and H-eluents are better than F-eluents in analyte retention, the more critical factor is the proper pairing of column with eluent. Among the conditions explored in this project, optimal retention and separation is achieved when the fluorocarbon column is paired with ethanol, even though TFE is the most polar one among the 4 eluents. This result shows fluorocarbon columns have much potential in chromatographic analysis and separation of non-fluorinated amino acids and proteins.

Fractions of isoxanthohumol and 8-prenylnaringenin obtained by the above HPLC were separately collected. Isoxanthohumol and 8-prenylnaringenin were enantioseparated by HPLC using Chiralcel OD-H column with a mobile phase composed of hexane/ethanol (90/10, v/v) and Chiralpak AD-RH column with a mobile phase composed of methanol/2-propanol/water (40/20/40, v/v/v), respectively. Both of isoxanthohumol and 8-prenylnaringenin from beer, hop, and hop pellet samples were found to be a racemic mixture. This can be explained that the two analytes were produced by non-enzymatic process. The effects of boiling conditions on the conversion of xanthohumol into isoxanthohumol were also studied. A higher concentration of ethanol in heating solvent resulted in a decrease in the conversion ratio and the conversion was stopped by addition of ethanol more than 50% (v/v). The isomerization was significantly affected pH (2-10) and the boiling medium at pH 5 was minimum for the conversion. Therefore, it was suggested that xanthohumol was relatively difficult to convert to isoxanthohumol in wort (pH 5-5.5) during boiling. This article is protected by copyright.

The most common have the brand names Halo, Ascentis Express and Kinetex. These columns provide super fast, sharp peaks and moderate sample loading and back pressure. These are available in different chemistries such as Câ, Cââ, RP Amide and Hilic. Normally, the silica gel particles have 2.7 and 1.7 Âµm total and inner solid core diameters with 0.5 Âµm thick outer porous layer, 90âÃ pore size and 150âmÂ²/g surface area. They have been used for the separation and identification of low and high molecular weight compounds.

The prototype is a liquid chromatography (LC) column (LC mini-column) fabricated on an inexpensive, flexible, biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) enclosure. The LC mini-column separates a mixture of proteins using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with polydivinylbenzene beads (5-20 Âµm in diameter with 10 nm pore size). The LC mini-column is smaller than any commercially available LC column by a factor of ~11 000 and successfully separates denatured and native protein mixtures at ~71 psi of the applied fluidic pressure. Separated proteins are analyzed using NuPAGE-gel electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and an automated electrophoresis system. Quantitative HPLC results demonstrate successful separation based on intensity change: within 12 min, the intensity between large and small protein peaks changed by a factor of ~20. In further evaluation using the automated electrophoresis system, the plate height of the LC mini-column is between 36 Âµm and 100 Âµm. The prototype LC mini-column shows the potential for real-time health monitoring in applications that require inexpensive, flexible implant technology that can function effectively under non-laboratory conditions.\n\nComparing monolithic and fused core HPLC columns for fast chromatographic analysis of fat-soluble vitamins.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurdi, Said El; Muaileq, Dina Abu; Alhazmi, Hassan A; Bratty, Mohammed Al; Deeb, Sami El\n\n2017-06-27\n\nHPLC stationary phases of monolithic and fused core type can be used to achieve fast chromatographic separation as an alternative to UPLC. In this study, monolithic and fused core stationary phases are compared for fast separation of four fat-soluble vitamins. Three new methods on the first and second generation monolithic silica RP-18e columns and a fused core pentafluoro-phenyl propyl column were developed. Application of three fused core columns offered comparable separations of retinyl palmitate, DL-Î±-tocopheryl acetate, cholecalciferol and menadione in terms of elution speed and separation efficiency. Separation was achieved in approx. 5 min with good resolution (Rs > 5) and precision (RSD â¤ 0.6 %). Monolithic columns showed, however, a higher number of theoretical plates, better precision and lower column backpressure than the fused core column. The three developed methods were successfully applied to separate and quantitate fat-soluble vitamins in commercial products.\n\nHPLC SEPARATION OF CHIRAL ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES ON POLYSACCHARIDE CHIRAL STATIONARY PHASES\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nHigh-performance liquid chromatographic separation of the individual enantiomers of 12 organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) were obtained on polysaccharide chiral HPLC columns using an alkane-alcohol mobile phase.

The central component of our method is the online pre-concentration sequence that improves the match between post-column analyte peak volume and the micro-coil NMR detection volume. Separated samples are collected on to a C18 guard column with a mobile phase composed of 90% D2O/10% acetonitrile-D3, and back-flashed to the NMR micro-coil probe with 90% acetonitrile-D3/10% D2O. In order to assess the performance of our unit, we separated a standard mixture of 1 mM ibuprofen, naproxen, and phenylbutazone using a commercially available C18 analytical column. The S/N measurements from the NMR acquisitions indicated that we achieved signal enhancement factors up to 10.4 (Â±1.2)-fold. Furthermore, we observed that pre-concentration factors increased as the injected amount of analyte decreased. The highest concentration enrichment of 14.7 (Â±2.2)-fold was attained injecting 100 Î¼L solution of 0.2 mM (~4 Î¼g) ibuprofen.

For the HPLC separation precolumn fluorescence derivatization with naphthyl isocyanate was applied. The resulting urea derivatives were resolved on a cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)-coated silica gel column employing a column switching procedure. Detection was carried out fluorimetrically with a detection limit in the low ng/mL range. The method was adapted to the determination of fenoterol enantiomers in rat heart perfusates using liquid-liquid extraction. As an alternative a CE method was used for the direct separation of fenoterol enantiomers comparing different cyclodextrin derivatives as chiral selectors.

These provide ultra-fast HPLC separations for a variety of compounds with moderate sample loading capacity and low back pressure. Chemistries of these columns are C(8), C(18), RP-Amide, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, penta fluorophenyl (PFP), F5, and RP-aqua. Normally, the silica gel particles are of 2.7 and 1.7 Î¼m as total and inner solid core diameters, respectively, with 0.5-Î¼m-thick of outer porous layer having 90 Ã pore sizes and 150 m(2)/g surface area. This article describes these new generation columns with special emphasis on their textures and chemistries, separations, optimization, and comparison (inter and intra stationary phases).

In present study, the HPLC separation of acetic acid and levulinic acid on Aminex HPX-87H column has been investigated by varying column temperature, flow rate, and sulfuric acid content in the mobile phase. The column temperature was found critical in resolving acetic acid and levulinic acid. The resolution for two acids increased dramatically from 0.42 to 1.86 when the column temperature was lowered from 60 to 30 Â°C. So did the capacity factors for levulinic acid that was increased from 1.20 to 1.44 as the column temperature dropped. The optimum column temperature for the separation was found at 45 Â°C. Variation in flow rate and sulfuric acid concentration improved not as much as the column temperature did.

Good separation was achieved within 2.5 min using Chromolith RP18e column (100 mm x 4.6 mm) for HPLC and Acquity BEH C-18 (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 microm) column for UPLC. Both methods were compared in terms of total analysis time, mobile phase consumption, sensitivity, and validation parameters like precision, accuracy, LOD, and LOQ. Further, system suitability test data including resolution, capacity factor, theoretical plates, and tailing factor was determined for both the methods by ten replicate injections. Monolithic column based HPLC gave better results for most of the selected parameters while UPLC was found to be more eco-friendly with low mobile phase consumption and better sensitivity. Both methods may be used conveniently for the high throughput analysis of large number of samples in comparison to traditional particulate column.\n\nAccessible silanol sites - beneficial for the RP-HPLC separation of constitutional and diastereomeric azaspirovesamicol isomers.\n\nPubMed\n\nWenzel, Barbara; Fischer, Steffen; Brust, Peter; Steinbach, JÃ¶rg\n\n2010-12-10\n\nDifferent RP-HPLC columns (phenyl, conventional ODS, cross-linked C(18) and special end-capped C(8) and C(18) phases) were used to investigate the separation of four basic ionizable isomers. Using ACN/20mM NH(4)OAc aq., a separation was observed exclusively on RP columns with higher silanol activity at unusual high ACN concentration, indicating cation-exchange as main retention mechanism. Using MeOH/20mM NH(4)OAc aq., another separation at low MeOH concentrations was observed on both, RP columns with higher as well as RP columns with lower silanol activity, which is mainly based on hydrophobic interactions. The isomers were also separated on a bare silica column at higher MeOH content using NH(4)OAc. Since cation-exchange governs this retention, the elution order was different compared to the RP phases. A strong retention on the silica column was observed in ACN, which could be attributed to partition processes as additional retention mechanism. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

On-line sample pretreatment and propranolol preconcentration were performed on an Ascentis Express RP-C-18 guard column (5 Ã 4.6 mm), particle size, 2.7 Î¼m, with mobile phase acetonitrile/water (5:95, v/v) at a flow rate of 2.0 mL min(-1) and at a temperature of 50 Â°C. Valve switch from pretreatment column to analytical column was set at 4.0 min in a back-flush mode. Separation of propranolol from other endogenous urine compounds was achieved on the fused-core column Ascentis Express RP-Amide (100 Ã 4.6 mm), particle size, 2.7 Î¼m, with mobile phase acetonitrile/water solution of 0.5% triethylamine, pH adjusted to 4.5 by means of glacial acetic acid (25:75, v/v), at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1) and at a temperature of 50 Â°C. Fluorescence excitation/emission detection wavelengths were set at 229/338 nm. A volume of 1,500 Î¼L of filtered urine sample solution was injected directly into the column-switching HPLC system. The total analysis time including on-line sample pretreatment was less than 8 min. The experimentally determined limit of detection of the method was found to be 0.015 ng mL(-1).\n\n[Determination of triterpenoic acids in fruits of Ziziphus jujuba using HPLC-MS with polymeric ODS column].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yong; Zhou, An; Xie, Xiao-Mei\n\n2013-03-01\n\nA simple and sensitive method has been developed to simultaneously determine betunilic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba from different regions by HPLC-MS. This HPLC assay was performed on PAH polymeric C18 bonded stationary phase column with mobile phase contained acetonitrile-water (90: 10) and with negative ESI detection mode. The developed approach was characterized by short time consumption for chromatographic separation, high sensitivity and good reliability so as to meet the requirements for rapid analysis of large-batch fruits of Z. jujuba from different habitats.\n\nDirect HPLC separation of beta-aminoester enantiomers on totally synthetic chiral stationary phases.\n\nPubMed\n\nGasparrini, F; D'Acquarica, I; Villani, C; Cimarelli, C; Palmieri, G\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe direct separation of beta-aminoester enantiomers by HPLC on synthetic chiral stationary phases based on a pi-acidic derivative of trans 1,2-diaminocyclohexane as selector is described. The application of different columns containing the stationary phase with opposite configurations and in the racemic form to the determination of enantiomeric excess in chemically impure samples is demonstrated.\n\nApplication of a Fast Separation Method for Anti-diabetics in Pharmaceuticals Using Monolithic Column: Comparative Study With Silica Based C-18 Particle Packed Column.\n\nPubMed\n\nHemdan, A; Abdel-Aziz, Omar\n\n2018-04-01\n\nRun time is a predominant factor in HPLC for quality control laboratories especially if there is large number of samples have to be analyzed. Working at high flow rates cannot be attained with silica based particle packed column due to elevated backpressure issues. The use of monolithic column as an alternative to traditional C-18 column was tested for fast separation of pharmaceuticals, where the results were very competitive. The performance comparison of both columns was tested for separation of anti-diabetic combination containing Metformin, Pioglitazone and Glimepiride using Gliclazide as an internal standard. Working at high flow rates with less significant backpressure was obtained with the monolithic column where the run time was reduced from 6 min in traditional column to only 1 min in monolithic column with accepted resolution. The structure of the monolith contains many pores which can adapt the high flow rate of the mobile phase. Moreover, peak symmetry and equilibration time were more efficient with monolithic column.\n\nDetermination of antioxidants by a novel on-line HPLC-cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay with post-column detection.\n\nPubMed\n\nCelik, Saliha Esin; OzyÃ¼rek, Mustafa; GÃ¼Ã§lÃ¼, Kubilay; Apak, ReÅat\n\n2010-07-26\n\nA novel on-line HPLC-cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) method was developed for the selective determination of polyphenols (flavonoids, simple phenolic and hydroxycinnamic acids) in complex plant matrices. The method combines chromatographic separation, constituent analysis, and post-column identification of antioxidants in plant extracts. The separation of polyphenols was performed on a C18 column using gradient elution with two different mobile phase solutions, i.e., MeOH and 0.2% o-phosphoric acid. The HPLC-separated antioxidant polyphenols in the extracts react with copper(II)-neocuproine (Cu(II)-Nc) reagent in a post-column reaction coil to form a derivative. The reagent is reduced by antioxidants to the copper(I)-neocuproine (Cu(I)-Nc) chelate having maximum absorption at 450 nm. The negative peaks of antioxidant constituents were monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance due to Cu(I)-Nc. The detection limits of polyphenols at 450 nm (in the range of 0.17-3.46 microM) after post-column derivatization were comparable to those at 280 nm UV detection without derivatization. The developed method was successfully applied to the identification of antioxidant compounds in crude extracts of Camellia sinensis, Origanum marjorana and Mentha. The method is rapid, inexpensive, versatile, non-laborious, uses stable reagents, and enables the on-line qualitative and quantitative estimation of antioxidant constituents of complex plant samples.

Here, two UiO-66 analogues, UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-67, were synthesized and used as stationary phase in HPLC to evaluate their performance in the separation of substituted benzenes (SBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results showed that SBs could be well separated on UiO-66-NH2 column but not on UiO-67 column. Nonetheless, PAHs could be well separated on UiO-67 column. The separation mechanisms of SBs and PAHs on UiO-66 analogues may be involved in the pore size and functional group in the frameworks of UiO-66 analogues. Introduction of the-NH2 into UiO-66 significantly reduced its adsorption capacity for SB congeners, which resulted in less separation of SBs on UiO-66-NH2. As for the separation of PAHs on UiO-67 column, the Ï-Ï stacking effect was supposed to play a vital role.\n\nIsolation and identification of arctiin and arctigenin in leaves of burdock (Arctium lappa L.) by polyamide column chromatography in combination with HPLC-ESI/MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Shiming; Chen, Kaoshan; Schliemann, Willibald; Strack, Dieter\n\n2005-01-01\n\nA simple method involving polyamide column chromatography in combination with HPLC-PAD and HPLC-ESI/MS for isolating and identifying two kinds of lignans, arctiin and arctigenin, in the leaves of burdock (Arctium lappa L.) has been established. After extraction of burdock leaves with 80% methanol, the aqueous phase of crude extracts was partitioned between water and chloroform and the aqueous phase was fractionated on a polyamide glass column. The fraction, eluting with 100% methanol, was concentrated and gave a white precipitate at 4 degrees C from which two main compounds were purified by semi-preparative HPLC. In comparison with the UV and ESI-MS spectra and the HPLC retention time of authentic standards, the compounds were determined to be arctiin and arctigenin. The extraction/separation technique was validated using an internal standard method.\n\nReversed Phase Column HPLC-ICP-MS Conditions for Arsenic Speciation Analysis of Rice Flour.\n\nPubMed\n\nNarukawa, Tomohiro; Matsumoto, Eri; Nishimura, Tsutomu; Hioki, Akiharu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNew measurement conditions for arsenic speciation analysis of rice flour were developed using HPLC-ICP-MS equipped with a reversed phase ODS column. Eight arsenic species, namely, arsenite [As(III)], arsenate [As(V)], monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO), tetramethylarsonium (TeMA), arsenobetaine (AsB) and arsenocholine (AsC), were separated and determined under the proposed conditions. In particular, As(III) and MMAA and DMAA and AsB were completely separated using a newly proposed eluent containing ammonium dihydrogen phosphate. Importantly, the sensitivity changes, in particular those of As(V) and As(III) caused by coexisting elements and by complex matrix composition, which had been problematical in previously reported methods, were eliminated. The new eluent can be applied to C8, C18 and C30 ODS columns with the same effectiveness and with excellent repeatability. The proposed analytical method was successfully applied to extracts of rice flour certified reference materials.\n\nThe effect of re-dissolution solvents and HPLC columns on the analysis of mycosporine-like amino acids in the eulittoral macroalgae Prasiola crispa and Porphyra umbilicalis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKarsten, Ulf; Escoubeyrou, Karine; Charles, FranÃ§ois\n\n2009-09-01\n\nMany macroalgal species that are regularly exposed to high solar radiation such as the eulittoral green alga Prasiola crispa and the red alga Porphyra umbilicalis synthesize and accumulate high concentrations of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) as UV-sunscreen compounds. These substances are typically extracted with a widely used standard protocol following quantification by various high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques. However, further preparation steps prior to HPLC analysis as well as different HPLC column types have not been systematically checked regarding separation quality and reproducibility. Therefore pure methanol, distilled water and HPLC eluent were evaluated as re-dissolution solvent for dried Prasiola and Porphyra extracts, which were subsequently analyzed on three reversed-phase C8 and C18 HPLC columns. The data indicate that distilled water and the HPLC eluent gave almost identical peak patterns and MAA contents on the C8 and C18 columns. In contrast, the application of the widely used methanol led to double peaks or even the loss of specific peaks as well as to a strong decline in total MAA amounts ranging from about 35% of the maximum in P. crispa to 80% of the maximum in P. umbilicalis. Consequently, methanol should be avoided as re-dissolution solvent for the HPLC sample preparation. An improved protocol for the MAA analysis in macroalgae in combination with a reliable C18 column is suggested.\n\nPreparation, characterization, and performance evaluation of UiO-66 analogues as stationary phase in HPLC for the separation of substituted benzenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYan, Zengguang; Li, Jianrong; Xie, Yabo; Bai, Liping; Jiang, Lin; Li, Fasheng\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUiO-66 analogues are good candidates as stationary phase in HPLC because of their chemical/thermal stability, large surface area, and two cage structures. Here, two UiO-66 analogues, UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-67, were synthesized and used as stationary phase in HPLC to evaluate their performance in the separation of substituted benzenes (SBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results showed that SBs could be well separated on UiO-66-NH2 column but not on UiO-67 column. Nonetheless, PAHs could be well separated on UiO-67 column. The separation mechanisms of SBs and PAHs on UiO-66 analogues may be involved in the pore size and functional group in the frameworks of UiO-66 analogues. Introduction of theâNH2 into UiO-66 significantly reduced its adsorption capacity for SB congeners, which resulted in less separation of SBs on UiO-66-NH2. As for the separation of PAHs on UiO-67 column, the Ï-Ï stacking effect was supposed to play a vital role.

A novel reversed-phase HPLC method for the determination of CPZ in tablets was described. The separation of CPZ diastereoisomers and caffeine (internal standard) was carried out by applying the same analytical and instrumental conditions on two stationary phases, which have different surface chemistries. The columns used in the study were monolithic silica Merck Chromolith Performance RP-18e and conventional C18 silica Phenomenex Synergi Hydro RP columns. In total, 10âÎ¼L aliquots of samples were injected into the system and eluted using water-acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) solution, which was pumped through the column at a flow rate of 1.0âmL/min. The analyte peaks were detected at 200ânm using diode array detector with high specificity. CPZ diastereoisomers and caffeine were measured within 13âmin using the C18 column, whereas <5âmin was required for the monolithic one. Validation studies were performed according to official recommendations. Value of a monolithic column for the assay of diastereoisomers in pharmaceutical tablets was evaluated for the first time and found as a powerful alternative to highly efficient C18 columns.

This commercially available column was used to fractionate the di-, mono-, and non-ortho PCBs into three fractions for gas chromatography (GC)/electron capture detection analysis, and a fourth fraction containing the PCDDs/PCDFs for GC/mass spectrometry analysis. The recoveries of the PCBs ranged from 68 to 96%, and recoveries of the PCDDs/PCDFs ranged from 74 to 123%. The PGC column has the advantage of faster separations (110 min versus 446 min) and less solvent use (275 ml versus 1,100 ml) compared with automated fractionation of these compounds on activated carbon (PX-21), while still affording good separation of the classes. The PGC column may have an advantage over the pyrenyl-based HPLC method because it has a greater loading capacity (400 Î¼g total PCBs versus 250 Î¼g). Overall, the PGC is a standard column that provides reproducible fractionation of PCDD/PCDFs and PCBs for analytical measurement in environmental samples.\n\nMethacrylate-bonded covalent-organic framework monolithic columns for high performance liquid chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Li-Hua; Yang, Cheng-Xiong; Yan, Xiu-Ping\n\n2017-01-06\n\nCovalent-organic frameworks (COFs) are a newfangled class of intriguing microporous materials. Considering their unique properties, COFs should be promising as packing materials for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). However, the irregular shape and sub-micrometer size of COFs synthesized via the traditional methods render the main obstacles for the application of COFs in HPLC. Herein, we report the preparation of methacrylate-bonded COF monolithic columns for HPLC to overcome the above obstacles. The prepared COF bonded monolithic columns not only show good homogeneity and permeability, but also give high column efficiency, good resolution and precision for HPLC separation of small molecules including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, anilines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and benzothiophenes. Compared with the bare polymer monolithic column, the COF bonded monolithic columns show enhanced hydrophobic, Ï-Ï and hydrogen bond interactions in reverse phase HPLC. The results reveal the great potential of COF bonded monoliths for HPLC and COFs in separation sciences. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The monolith was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and the results indicated that the monolith had a stable and homogeneous structure. The porosity of the monolithic column was 75.86% and average pore diameter was 2.1Âµm. Several alkylbenzenes and anilines were used to evaluate the column performance in terms of hydrophobicity. Then the column was applied to separate small molecules including phytosterol and BSA tryptic digest. Finally, five standard proteins, egg white and plasma were separated respectively and high separation capacity of protein was obtained. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Of the two methods used to counter the mechanical instability and formation of flow channels (composite columns and column wall surface treatment), we demonstrated that proper column wall surface treatment was sufficient to solve both problems. Our study also indicated that no surface treatment is efficient, and of the methods studied silanization in acidified ethanol solution and constant renewal of the reaction mixture (dynamic mode) proved to be the most effective. As a result of this study, we have been able to prepare repeatable and durable methacrylate HPLC columns with good efficiencies. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Commercially samples of food supplements were dissolved in chloroform with help of saponification with 1M solution of sodium hydroxide in ultrasound bath. A 20-min sample dissolution/extraction step was necessary before chromatography analysis to transfer Î²-carotene from solid state of food supplements preparations (capsules,tablets) to chloroform solution. Sample volume - 3Î¼L of chloroform phase was directly injected into the HPLC system. Next on-line sample clean-up was achieved on the pretreatment precolumn Chromolith Guard Cartridge RP-18e (Merck), 10Ã4.6mm, with a washing mobile phase (methanol:water, 92:8, (v/v)) at a flow rate of 1.5mL/min. Valve switch to analytical column was set at 2.5min in a back-flush mode. After column switching to the analytical column Ascentis Express C-18, 30Ã4.6mm, particle size 2.7Î¼m (Sigma Aldrich), the separation and determination of Î²-carotene in food supplements was performed using a mobile phase consisting of 100% methanol, column temperature at 60Â°C and flow rate 1.5mL/min. The detector was set at 450nm. Under the optimum chromatographic conditions standard calibration curve was measured with good linearity - correlation coefficient for Î²-carotene (r(2)=0.999014; n=6) between the peak areas and concentration of Î²-carotene 20-200Î¼g/mL. Accuracy of the method defined as a mean recovery was in the range 96.66-102.40%. The intraday method precision was satisfactory at three concentration levels 20, 125 and 200Î¼g/mL and relative standard deviations were in the range 0.90-1.02%. The chromatography method has shown high sample throughput during column-switching pretreatment process and analysis in one step in short time (6min) of the whole chromatographic analysis.

The low contents and complex components in plants make it difficult to be accurately analyzed. A novel one-step sample preparation method for ABA in plants was developed. Fresh peanut (Arachis hypogaea) plant materials were fixed by oven-drying, microwave drying, boiling or Carnoy's fixative, and loaded onto a mini-preparing column. After washed the impurities, ABA was eluted with a small amount of solvent. ABA in plant materials was completely extracted and purified in 2mL solution and directly analyzed by HPLC, with a 99.3% recovery rate. Multiple samples can be simultaneously prepared. Analyses using this method indicated that the endogenous ABA in oven-dried peanut leaves increased 20.2-fold from 1.01 to 20.37Î¼gg(-1) dry weight within 12h and then decreased in 30% polyethylene glycol 6000 treated plants, and increased 3.34-fold from 0.85 to 2.84Î¼gg(-1) dry weight in 5 days and then decreased in soil drought treated plants. The method combined the column chromatographic extraction and solid-phase separation technologies in one step and can completely extracted plant endogenous ABA in a purified and highly concentrated form for direct HPLC analysis.

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a beta-cyclodestrin (beta-CD) column, cyclodextrin-modified micellar electrokinetic chromatography (CD-MEKC), gas chromatography (GC) on a Chirasil-L-Val column, and HPLC on a Chirobiotic T column have been investigated as the chiral separation techniques. For HPLC separation on the beta-CD column, and also for CD-MEKC, selenomethionine enantiomers were derivatized with NDA/CN(-). For chiral separation by GC, selenomethionine enantiomers were converted into their N-trifluoroacetyl (TFA)-O-alkyl esters. The developed hybridation methodologies are compared with respect to enantioselectivity, sensitivity and analysis time. The usefulness of the best-suited method [HPLC (Chirobiotic T)-ICP-MS] was demonstrated by its application to the successful chiral speciation of selenium and D-and L-selenomethionine content determination in selenized yeast.

Prior to the dry-column chromatography step, the coal derived solvents were added to an acid treated silica gel column and eluted with chloroform. This step removed pyridine-type nitrogen heterocycles. After separation of the individual ring fractions, the fractions were further separated by either thin layer chromatography (TLC) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). If TLC was used, then after separation fluorescence profiles of each PAH ring fraction distributed on 30%-acetylated cellulose chromatoplates were obtained withmoreÂ Â» a spectrodensitometer. Measurement of fluorescence peak heights gave an approximate measure of the amount of the 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6- ring PAH. For HPLC separation, the 3- and 4- ring PAH fractions obtained from the dry-column chromatography step were separated with a ..mu..-Bondapak C/sub 18/ column and methanol:water (65:35) mobile phase. The HPLC separated PAH were characterized by chromatographic correlation factors and corrected fluorescence excitation spectra.

Most commonly, these feedstocks contain triglycerides which are transesterified into the fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAEs) which comprise biodiesel fuel. While the tranesterification reaction itself is simple, monitoring the reaction progress and reaction products is not. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is useful for assessing the FAAE products, but does not directly address either the tri-, di-, or monoglycerides present from incomplete transesterification or the free fatty acids which may also be present. Analysis of the biodiesel reaction mixture is complicated by the solubility and physical property differences among the components of the tranesterification reaction mixture. In this contribution, we present a simple, rapid HPLC method which allows for monitoring all of the main components in a biodiesel fuel transesterification reaction, with specific emphasis on the ability to monitor the reaction as a function of time. The utilization of a relatively new, core-shell stationary phase for the HPLC column allows for efficient separation of peaks with short elution times, saving both time and solvent.\n\nSynthesis of a mixed-model stationary phase derived from glutamine for HPLC separation of structurally different biologically active compounds: HILIC and reversed-phase applications.\n\nPubMed\n\nAral, TarÄ±k; Aral, Hayriye; ZiyadanoÄullarÄ±, Berrin; ZiyadanoÄullarÄ±, Recep\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA novel mixed-mode stationary phase was synthesised starting from N-Boc-glutamine, aniline and spherical silica gel (4 Âµm, 60 Ã ). The prepared stationary phase was characterized by IR and elemental analysis. The new stationary phase bears an embedded amide group into phenyl ring, highly polar a terminal amide group and non-polar groups (phenyl and alkyl groups). At first, this new mixed-mode stationary phase was used for HILIC separation of four nucleotides and five nucleosides. The effects of different separation conditions, such as pH value, mobile phase and temperature, on the separation process were investigated. The optimum separation for nucleotides was achieved using HILIC isocratic elution with aqueous mobile phase and acetonitrile with 20Â°C column temperature. Under these conditions, the four nucleotides could be separated and detected at 265 nm within 14 min. Five nucleosides were separated under HILIC isocratic elution with aqueous mobile phase containing pH=3.25 phosphate buffer (10mM) and acetonitrile with 20Â°C column temperature and detected at 265 nm within 14 min. Chromatographic parameters as retention factor, selectivity, theoretical plate number and peak asymmetry factor were calculated for the effect of temperature and water content in mobile phase on the separation process. The new column was also tested for nucleotides and nucleosides mixture and six analytes were separated in 10min. The chromatographic behaviours of these polar analytes on the new mixed-model stationary phase were compared with those of HILIC columns under similar conditions. Further, phytohormones and phenolic compounds were separated in order to see influence of the new stationary phase in reverse phase conditions. Eleven plant phytohormones were separated within 13 min using RP-HPLC gradient elution with aqueous mobile phase containing pH=2.5 phosphate buffer (10mM) and acetonitrile with 20Â°C column temperature and detected at 230 or 278 nm.

H.; Kenton, R. C.; Kalasinsky, Kathryn S.\n\n1989-12-01\n\nSolvent-elimination HPLC/FT-IR has become a viable combination of two important techniques, and we have been developing a system which is adaptable to both normal and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The interface involves the deposition of HPLC eluites onto a KCI-laden train with subsequent analysis via diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and with minor modifications, the system can be used with microbore and analytical columns. With aqueous solvents, the water is converted to methanol and acetone in a post-column reaction with 2,2-dimethoxypropane before the eluites are deposited. A number of different samples have been used to demonstrate the interface and its flexibility. Steroids, analgesics, and other pharmaceutical preparations have been separated with reverse-phase solvents and identified by their infrared spectra. For some of the compounds studied, different infrared spectra of a given compound have been found to exhibit intensity variations, which arise from different crystalline states. The differences can be concentration dependent and may be useful in obtaining semi-quantitative information from the infrared spectra. Applications involving both gradient elution and isocratic separations have been successful. The former provides the same advantages for HPLC/FT-IR as one finds in conventional HPLC. More recent work has been applied to the use of buffers such as those frequently used in bioanalytical separations. In trying to simplify the post-column reaction with water, we have immobilized dehydration reagents onto silica particles and packed these materials into a column which is inserted in-line after the analytical column. Of the reagents utilized to date, 3,3-dimethoxypropyltrimethoxysilane has been found to perform most efficiently. It has advantages over the simpler reagents because it can be regenerated in the reaction column. Results and the efficiency of the dehydration process and its relation to the type of reagent and its coverage will be\n\nA chiral HPLC method for the simultaneous separation of configurational isomers of the predominant cis/trans forms of astaxanthin.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbu-Lafi, S; Turujman, S A\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe report an HPLC method that allows the simultaneous separation of configurational isomers of the predominant cis/trans forms of astaxanthin.

The large separation of the cis isomers from the all-trans isomers that we report here ensure the suitability of this method for the routine determination of the ratio of the configurational isomers of all-trans-astaxanthin.\n\nHPLC-Chip/MS Technology in Proteomic Profiling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVollmer, Martin; van de Goor, Tom\n\nHPLC-chip/MS is a novel nanoflow analytical technology conducted on a microfabricated chip that allows for highly efficient HPLC separation and superior sensitive MS detection of complex proteomic mixtures. This is possible through on-chip preconcentration and separation with fluidic connection made automatically in a leak-tight fashion. Minimum precolumn and postcolumn peak dispersion and uncompromised ease of use result in compounds eluting in bands of only a few nanoliters. The chip is fabricated out of bio-inert polyimide-containing channels and integrated chip structures, such as an electrospray emitter, columns, and frits manufactured by laser ablation technology. Meanwhile, a variety of HPLC-chips differing in design and stationary phase are commercially available, which provide a comprehensive solution for applications in proteomics, glycomics, biomarker, and pharmaceutical discovery. The HPLC-chip can also be easily integrated into a multidimensional separation workflow where different orthogonal separation techniques are combined to solve a highly complex separation problems.

In this paper, we present a microfabricated approach to nano-LC, which integrates these components on a single LC chip, eliminating the need for conventional LC connections. The chip was fabricated by laminating polyimide films with laser-ablated channels, ports, and frit structures. The enrichment and separation columns were packed using conventional reversed-phase chromatography particles. A face-seal rotary valve provided a means for switching between sample loading and separation configurations with minimum dead and delay volumes while allowing high-pressure operation. The LC chip and valve assembly were mounted within a custom electrospray source on an ion-trap mass spectrometer. The overall system performance was demonstrated through reversed-phase gradient separations of tryptic protein digests at flow rates between 100 and 400 nL/min. Microfluidic integration of the nano-LC components enabled separations with subfemtomole detection sensitivity, minimal carryover, and robust and stable electrospray throughout the LC solvent gradient.\n\nSequential Injection Chromatography with an Ultra-short Monolithic Column for the Low-Pressure Separation of Î±-Tocopherol and Î³-Oryzanol in Vegetable Oils and Nutrition Supplements.\n\nPubMed\n\nThaithet, Sujitra; Kradtap Hartwell, Supaporn; Lapanantnoppakhun, Somchai\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA low-pressure separation procedure of Î±-tocopherol and Î³-oryzanol was developed based on a sequential injection chromatography (SIC) system coupled with an ultra-short (5 mm) C-18 monolithic column, as a lower cost and more compact alternative to the HPLC system. A green sample preparation, dilution with a small amount of hexane followed by liquid-liquid extraction with 80% ethanol, was proposed. Very good separation resolution (R s = 3.26), a satisfactory separation time (10 min) and a total run time including column equilibration (16 min) were achieved. The linear working range was found to be 0.4 - 40 Î¼g with R 2 being more than 0.99. The detection limits of both analytes were 0.28 Î¼g with the repeatability within 5% RSD (n = 7).

Degradation was studied in relation to the temperature of water (70, 80, 90Â°C) and the standing time of the infusion (up to 6h). Along with chromatographic separation, the antioxidant properties of the infusions were monitored using two spectrophotometric methods. During staying of green tea infusion, the degradation of some catechins probably to gallic acid was observed. Finally, the influence of tea bag storage on antioxidant properties of green tea was evaluated. Rapid degradation of antioxidants after 3weeks was observed.

Only limited information is available, however, on their compositions. The present study optimized the separation performance and characterized the low-molecular-weight phenolic fractions of these nuts with C18 and pentafluorophenyl (PFP) fused-core LC columns by employing a kinetic approach. Although both types of reversed-phase columns demonstrated similar performance in general, the PFP column furnished greater plate numbers and superior peak shapes for the low-molecular-weight fractions as well as overall separations of ellagic acid derivatives. The high-molecular-weight fraction of pecans, analyzed by a 3-Î¼m HILIC column, possessed more proanthocyanidins than the Chinese hickory nuts with dimers and trimers (31.4 and 18.34 mg/g crude extract, respectively) being present at the greatest levels. Chinese hickory nuts had lower proanthocyanidin content but possessed tetramers and pentamers at 4.46 and 4.01 mg/g crude extract, respectively.\n\nCarotenoids from Foods of Plant, Animal and Marine Origin: An Efficient HPLC-DAD Separation Method.\n\nPubMed\n\nStrati, Irini F; Sinanoglou, Vassilia J; Kora, Lintita; Miniadis-Meimaroglou, Sofia; Oreopoulou, Vassiliki\n\n2012-12-19\n\nCarotenoids are important antioxidant compounds, present in many foods of plant, animal and marine origin. The aim of the present study was to describe the carotenoid composition of tomato waste, prawn muscle and cephalothorax and avian (duck and goose) egg yolks through the use of a modified gradient elution HPLC method with a C 30 reversed-phase column for the efficient separation and analysis of carotenoids and their cis -isomers. Elution time was reduced from 60 to 45 min without affecting the separation efficiency. All- trans lycopene predominated in tomato waste, followed by all- trans -Î²-carotene, 13- cis -lutein and all- trans lutein, while minor amounts of 9- cis -lutein, 13- cis -Î²-carotene and 9- cis -Î²-carotene were also detected. Considering the above findings, tomato waste is confirmed to be an excellent source of recovering carotenoids, especially all- trans lycopene, for commercial use. Xanthophylls were the major carotenoids of avian egg yolks, all- trans lutein and all- trans zeaxanthin in duck and goose egg yolk, respectively. In the Penaeus kerathurus prawn, several carotenoids (zeaxanthin, all- trans -lutein, canthaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, optical and geometrical astaxanthin isomers) were identified in considerable amounts by the same method. A major advantage of this HPLC method was the efficient separation of carotenoids and their cis -isomers, originating from a wide range of matrices.\n\nSystems for column-based separations, methods of forming packed columns, and methods of purifying sample components\n\nDOEpatents\n\nEgorov, Oleg B.; O'Hara, Matthew J.; Grate, Jay W.; Chandler, Darrell P.; Brockman, Fred J.; Bruckner-Lea, Cynthia J.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe invention encompasses systems for column-based separations, methods of packing and unpacking columns and methods of separating components of samples.

The amide ligand was synthesised with high yield. The resulting amide bonded stationary phase was characterised by SEM, IR and elemental analysis. The resulting selector bearing a polar amide group is used for the reversed-phase chromatography separation of different classes of thirteen phytohormones (plant hormones). The chromatographic behaviours of these analytes on the amide-silica stationary phase were compared with those of RP-C18 column under same conditions. The effects of different separation conditions, such as mobile phase, pH value, flow rate and temperature, on the separation and retention behaviours of the 13 phytohormones in this system were studied. The optimum separation was achieved using reversed-phase HPLC gradient elution with an aqueous mobile phase containing pH=6.85 potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM) and acetonitrile with a 22 Â°C column temperature. Under these experimental conditions, the 12 phytohormones could be separated and detected at 230 or 270 nm within 26 min. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the lack of streamlined apparatus and consequently varying protocols remain as a challenge among positron emission tomography laboratories. We report here the prototype apparatus and implementation of a fully automated and simplified column-switching procedure to allow for the easy and automated determination of radioligands and their metabolites in up to 5 mL of plasma. The system has been used with conventional UV and coincidence radiation detectors, as well as with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer.\n\nSugar microanalysis by HPLC with benzoylation: improvement via introduction of a C-8 cartridge and a high efficiency ODS column.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyagi, Michiko; Yokoyama, Hirokazu; Hibi, Toshifumi\n\n2007-07-01\n\nAn HPLC protocol for sugar microanalysis based on the formation of ultraviolet-absorbing benzoyl chloride derivatives was improved. Here, samples were prepared with a C-8 cartridge and analyzed with a high efficiency ODS column, in which porous spherical silica particles 3 microm in diameter were packed. These devices allowed us to simultaneously quantify multiple sugars and sugar alcohols up to 10 ng/ml and to provide satisfactory separations of some sugars, such as fructose and myo-inositol and sorbitol and mannitol. This protocol, which does not require special apparatuses, should become a powerful tool in sugar research.\n\nA nitromethane-based HPLC system alternative to acetonitrile for carotenoid analysis of fruit and vegetables.\n\nPubMed\n\nSandmann, Gerhard\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAcetonitrile-based HPLC systems are the most commonly used for carotenoid analysis from different plant tissues. Because of the acetonitrile shortage, an HPLC system for the separation of carotenoids on C(18) reversed-phase columns was developed in which an acetonitrile-alcohol-based mobile phase was replaced by nitromethane. This solvent comes closest to acetonitrile with respect to its elutrophic property. Our criterion was to obtain similar separation and retention times for a range of differently structured carotenoids. This was achieved by further increase in the lipophilicity with ethylacetate. For all the carotenoids which we tested, we found co-elution only of Î²-cryptoxanthin and lycopene. By addition of 1% of water, separation of this pair of carotenoids was also achieved. The final recommended mobile phase consisted of nitromethaneâ: 2-propanol : ethyl acetate : water (79 : 10 : 10 : 1, by volume). On Nucleosil C(18) columns and related ones like Hypersil C(18), we obtained separation of carotenes, hydroxyl, epoxy and keto derivatives, which resembles the excellent separation properties of acetonitrile-based mobile phases on C(18) reversed phase columns. We successfully applied the newly developed HPLC system to the separation of carotenoids from different vegetables and fruit.

A pair of TAG-PI containing saturated fatty acids at least 12 carbons was separated. Except for TAG-PI containing elaidic acid, pairs of TAG-PI containing three unsaturated fatty acids were not separated, even by recycle runs. These results indicate that the resolution of TAG-PI on a non-endcapped polymeric ODS stationary phase is realized by the recognition of the linear structure of the fatty acid and the binding position of the saturated fatty acid in TAG-PI. Chain length was also an important factor for resolution. This method may be a useful and simple for measuring the abundance ratio of TAG-PI containing saturated fatty acids in natural oils.\n\nA NEW HPLC METHOD FOR SEPARATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON PIGMENTS IN NATURAL SAMPLES\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nA new high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed to analyze, in a single run, most polar and non-polar chlorophylls and carotenoids from marine phytoplankton.

The analytical procedure involves a simple protein precipitation, pre-column fluorescence derivatization, and separation by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The calibration curve showed good linearity over a wide concentration range (50 ng/mL to 10 microg/mL) in human plasma (r(2)=0.9998). The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 50 ng/mL. The average precision and accuracy at LLOQ were within 6.3% and 107.6%, respectively. This method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study after oral administration of a dose (300 mg) of bucillamine to 20 healthy Korean volunteers.\n\nTowards multimodal HPLC separations on humic acid-bonded aminopropyl silica: RPLC and HILIC behavior.\n\nPubMed\n\nGezici, Orhan; Kara, HÃ¼seyin\n\n2011-09-15\n\nThe stationary phase characteristics of the material obtained through immobilization of humic acid (HA) to aminopropyl silica (APS) via amide-bond formation were investigated. The material was characterized in terms of elemental analysis, FTIR, thermogravimetric analyses, pH point of zero charge measurements, potentiometric titrations, and contact angle measurements. Amount of HA bonded to APS was determined from the elemental analysis results, and found as 170 mgHA/gAPS. Stability of the material was studied in aqueous media at different pH values, and amount of HA released at pH=8 did not exceed 2% of the total immobilized HA. Stationary phase characteristics of the well-characterized material were investigated in an HPLC system by using some low-molecular weight polar compounds (i.e. some nucleosides and nucleobases) as test solutes. Effect of some experimental variables such as column conditioning, composition of mobile phase, and temperature on the chromatographic behavior of the studied compounds was studied. Role of ammonium solutions at different pH values on retentive properties of the species was also studied. Retention factors (k') versus volume percentage of organic modifier exhibited a U-curve, which was evaluated as an indication for RPLC/HILIC mixed-mode behavior of the stationary phase. Orthogonality between RPLC and HILIC modes was analyzed through geometric approach, and found as 48.5%. Base-line separation for the studied groups of compounds was achieved under each studied mode, and some differentiations were observed in elution order of the compounds depending on the HPLC mode applied. Chromatograms recorded under RPLC and HILIC modes were compared with those recorded on APS under similar conditions, and thus the influence/importance of HA immobilization process was evaluated in detail. In light of the obtained results, immobilized HA is represented as a useful stationary phase for HPLC separations. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Best conditions for separation of limonin in a reasonable time are 30 to 32% acetonitrile in water at 0.9 mL/min using a 5-micron C18 column 10 cm long. These conditions are used to analyze grapefruit and navel orange juice samples, and these HPLC results are compared with values determined by enzyme immunoassay or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on the same samples.\n\nHPLC enantioseparation of racemic bupropion, baclofen and etodolac: modification of conventional ligand exchange approach by pre-column formation of chiral ligand exchange complexes.\n\nPubMed\n\nSingh, Manisha; Bhushan, Ravi\n\n2016-11-01\n\nSeparation of racemic mixture of (RS)-bupropion, (RS)-baclofen and (RS)-etodolac, commonly marketed racemic drugs, has been achieved by modifying the conventional ligand exchange approach. The Cu(II) complexes were first prepared with a few l-amino acids, namely, l-proline, l-histidine, l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan, and to these was introduced a mixture of the enantiomer pair of (RS)-bupropion, or (RS)-baclofen or (RS)-etodolac. As a result, formation of a pair of diastereomeric complexes occurred by 'chiral ligand exchange' via the competition between the chelating l-amino acid and each of the two enantiomers from a given pair. The diastereomeric mixture formed in the pre-column process was loaded onto HPLC column. Thus, both the phases during chromatographic separation process were achiral (i.e. neither the stationary phase had any chiral structural feature of its own nor did the mobile phase have any chiral additive). Separation of diastereomers was successful using a C 18 column and a binary mixture of MeCN and TEAP buffer of pHâ4.0 (60:40, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1âmL/min and UV detection at 230ânm for (RS)-Bup, 220ânm for (RS)-Bac and 223ânm for (RS)-Etd. Baseline separation of the two enantiomers was obtained with a resolution of 6.63 in <15âmin. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, followed by a post-column reaction and a sensitive UV-visible detection system was the method of choice to determine qualitatively and quantitatively the two uranium species. Also a cation-exchange and fluorescence detection system was studied for separation and determination of UO/sub 2//sup 2 +/ ions. Uranyl ion was selectively complexed with L-phenylalanine moetie in the sample solution containing U/sup 4 +/moreÂ Â» ions. Uranium (IV)/U(VI)-ligand was separated on a C/sub 18/ column with acetate buffer. Hexanesulfonate was found to be the choice for ion-pair reagent. The separation was best done with the acetate buffer at .01 M concentration and pH of 3.5. Absorption of the two species were measured after a post-column reaction with Arsenazo-III. Chromatographic parameters were calculated and a calibration curves were constructed. The detection limit for the procedure was 0.7 ..mu..g/mo and 1.2..mu..g/ml for U(IV) and U(VI) respectively. When U(VI) was separated on the cation-exchange column the limit of detection was calculated to be 1 ..mu..g/ml. The direct fluorometric method for U(VI) measurement results in a detection limit of 2 ppB and upper concentration limit of 2 ppM. The effect of interfering ions in the direct method of determination could be eliminated by dilution of sample solution.Â«Â less\n\nNew approaches with two cyano columns to the separation of acetaminophen, phenylephrine, chlorpheniramine and related compounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nOlmo, B; GarcÃ­a, A; MarÃ­n, A; Barbas, C\n\n2005-03-25\n\nThe development of new pharmaceutical forms with classical active compounds generates new analytical problems. That is the case of sugar-free sachets of cough-cold products containing acetaminophen, phenylephrine hydrochloride and chlorpheniramine maleate. Two cyanopropyl stationary phases have been employed to tackle the problem. The Discovery cyanopropyl (SUPELCO) column permitted the separation of the three actives, maleate and excipients (mainly saccharine and orange flavour) with a constant proportion of aqueous/ organic solvent (95:5, v/v) and a pH gradient from 7.5 to 2. The run lasted 14 min. This technique avoids many problems related to baseline shifts with classical organic solvent gradients and opens great possibilities to modify selectivity not generally used in reversed phase HPLC. On the other hand, the Agilent Zorbax SB-CN column with a different retention profile permitted us to separate not only the three actives and the excipients but also the three known related compounds: 4-aminophenol, 4-chloracetanilide and 4-nitrophenol in an isocratic method with a run time under 30 min. This method was validated following ICH guidelines and validation parameters showed that it could be employed as stability-indicating method for this pharmaceutical form.\n\nProline-coated column for the capillary electrochromatographic separation of amino acids by in-column derivatization.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Chun-Chi; Liu, Chuen-Ying\n\n2004-10-01\n\nWith 3-trimethoxysilylpropyl chloride as the spacer, a proline-coated capillary column was prepared for the capillary electrochromatographic (CEC) separation of amino acids by in-column derivatization. Nine standard mixtures, including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, valine, phenylalanine, alanine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, were injected. o-Phthalaldehyde (OPA), OPA/2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and OPA/N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in borate buffer were tested as the derivatizing agent. Among them, OPA (50 mM) in borate buffer (pH 9.5, 50 mM) gave the best performance. The formation of isoindole could be detected by UV detection. The sandwich-type injection was carried out in hydrostatic mode (10 cm) with the program R(10 s)S(10 s) R(10 s)W(10 min) with R, S, and W being the reagent, sample, and waiting times. Mesityl oxide, benzyl alcohol, and acetone showed some interaction with the column. A current monitoring method was used instead of the determination of the electroosmotic flow (EOF). The direction of EOF was from anode to cathode even under acidic condition lower than the pI value (6.31) of the bonded group due to some unreacted silanol groups. Some parameters including pH, nature, and concentration of the mobile phase and the effect of organic modifier with regard to the CEC separation were investigated. With the proline-coated column (75 (50) cm x 75 microm ID) the best separation was performed in phosphate buffer (pH 4.00, 100 mM) with an applied voltage of -15 kV. The established method was also compared with those precolumn derivatized prior to the separation with proline-coated column as well as with in-capillary derivatization and separation with a bare fused-silica column.

The separation could be achieved in less than 1.5 min on a 50 mm sub 2 microm column with simultaneous solvent and temperature gradient programming. Due to the lower viscosity of the mobile phase and the increased mass transfer at higher temperatures, the separation could be performed on a conventional HPLC system obtaining peak widths at half height between 0.6 and 1.3 s.\n\nIndustrial application of green chromatography--I. Separation and analysis of niacinamide in skincare creams using pure water as the mobile phase.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Yu; Strickland, Zackary; Kapalavavi, Brahmam; Marple, Ronita; Gamsky, Chris\n\n2011-03-15\n\nIn this work, chromatographic separation of niacin and niacinamide using pure water as the sole component in the mobile phase has been investigated. The separation and analysis of niacinamide have been optimized using three columns at different temperatures and various flow rates. Our results clearly demonstrate that separation and analysis of niacinamide from skincare products can be achieved using pure water as the eluent at 60Â°C on a Waters XTerra MS C18 column, a Waters XBridge C18 column, or at 80Â°C on a Hamilton PRP-1 column. The separation efficiency, quantification quality, and analysis time of this new method are at least comparable with those of the traditional HPLC methods. Compared with traditional HPLC, the major advantage of this newly developed green chromatography technique is the elimination of organic solvents required in the HPLC mobile phase. In addition, the pure water chromatography separations described in this work can be directly applied in industrial plant settings without further modification of the existing HPLC equipment.

The separation and quantification of levetiracetam and caffeine (internal standard) were performed using a single analytical procedure with two different types of stationary phases, conventional Phenomenex Gemini C18 (100 x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and Merck Chromolith Performance RP18e (100 x 4.6 mm, macropore size 2 mm, micropore size 13 nm) monolithic silica. Five-microliter aliquots of samples were injected into the system and eluted using water-acetonitrile (90 + 10, v/v) mobile phase pumped at the rate of 1 mL/min. The analyte peaks were detected at 200 nm using a diode array detector with adequate resolution. Validation studies were performed using the method recommended by the International Conference on Harmonization, the U.S. Pharmacopeia, and AOAC INTERNATIONAL, which includes accuracy, precision, range, limits, robustness, and system suitability parameters. Levetiracetam and caffeine were detected in about 7 min using the conventional column, whereas less than 5 min was required when the monolithic column was used. Calibration plots had r values close to unity in the range of 0.8-8.0 microg/mL. Assay of levetiracetam in a tablet formulation was demonstrated as an application to real samples.\n\nFingerprint of Hedyotis diffusa Willd. by HPLC-MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Ting; Yang, Yi-Hua; Yang, Ju-Yun; Chen, Ben-Mei; Duan, Ju-Ping; Yu, Shu-Yi; Ouyang, Hong-Tao; Cheng, Jun-Ping; Chen, Yu-Xiang\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA HPLC-MS fingerprint method has been developed based on the consistent chromatographic features of the major chemical constituents among 10 batches of Hedyotis diffusa Willd. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Hypersil-Keystone Hypurity C(18) column using methanol:water:acetic acid as the mobile phase. Major compounds, including oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and ferulic acid, were analysed by HPLC-MS. Their analysis was ascertained by comparison with data derived from the standard compounds. The HPLC-MS fingerprint was successfully applied to analyse and differentiate samples from different geographical origins, or processing methods. H. diffusa was well distinguished from Hedyotis chrysotricha by HPLC-MS. Therefore the establishment of fingerprint of H. diffusa is critical in assessing and controlling its overall quality.\n\nGradient HPLC of antibiotics in urine, ground water, chicken muscle, hospital wastewater, and pharmaceutical samples using C-18 and RP-amide columns.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Ashwini; Kumar Malik, Ashok; Kumar Tewary, Dhananjay; Singh, Baldev\n\n2008-02-01\n\nA simple and highly sensitive high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC-UV) method has been developed for the determination of ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, cinoxacin, and nalidixic acid, in mobile phase citrate buffer (0.001 M) of pH 4.5 prepared in water (X), methanol (Y), and ACN (Z) using gradient at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min by direct UV absorbance detection at lambda = 280 nm. Separation of analytes was studied on the C-18 and RP-amide columns and best results were observed on the RP-amide column with LODs (3.3 x S/m) 0.89, 0.55, 0.67, and 1.41 ng/mL for ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, cinoxacin, and nalidixic acid, respectively, and better RSD than the C-18 column. The recovery of Fluoroquinolones (FQs) in urine, ground water, hospital wastewater, and chicken muscle using this method is more than 90%. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, cinoxacin, and nalidixic acid in urine, ground water, pharmaceutical dosage forms, hospital wastewater, and chicken muscle.\n\nHPLC Separation of Sulforaphane Enantiomers in Broccoli and Its Sprouts by Transformation into Diastereoisomers Using Derivatization with (S)-Leucine.\n\nPubMed\n\nOkada, Makiko; Yamamoto, Atsushi; Aizawa, Sen-Ichi; Taga, Atsushi; Terashima, Hiroyuki; Kodama, Shuji\n\n2017-01-11\n\nRacemic sulforaphane, which was derivatized with (S)-leucine (l-leucine), was resolved by reversed phase HPLC with UV detection. The optimum mobile phase conditions were found to be 10 mM citric acid (pH 2.8) containing 22% methanol at 35 Â°C using detection at 254 nm. Sulforaphane enantiomers in florets and stems of five brands of broccoli and leaves and stems of three brands of broccoli sprouts were analyzed by the proposed HPLC method. Both sulforaphane enantiomers were detected in all of the samples. The S/R ratios of sulforaphane in broccoli samples were 1.5-2.6/97.4-98.5% for florets and 5.0-12.1/87.9-95.0% for stems. The S/R ratios in broccoli sprout samples were higher than those in broccoli samples and were found to be 8.3-19.7/80.3-91.7% for leaves and 37.0-41.8/58.2-63.0% for stems. (S)-Sulforaphane detected in the broccoli and its sprout samples was positively identified by separately using an HPLC with a chiral column (Chiralpak AD-RH) and mass spectrometry.\n\nSimultaneous separation and analysis of water- and fat-soluble vitamins on multi-modal reversed-phase weak anion exchange material by HPLC-UV.\n\nPubMed\n\nDabre, Romain; Azad, Nazanin; SchwÃ¤mmle, Achim; LÃ¤mmerhofer, Michael; Lindner, Wolfgang\n\n2011-04-01\n\nSeveral methods for the separation of vitamins on HPLC columns were already validated in the last 20 years. However, most of the techniques focus on separating either fat- or water-soluble vitamins and only few methods are intended to separate lipophilic and hydrophilic vitamins simultaneously. A mixed-mode reversed-phase weak anion exchange (RP-WAX) stationary phase was developed in our laboratory in order to address such mixture of analytes with different chemical characteristics, which are difficult to separate on standard columns. The high versatility in usage of the RP-WAX chromatographic material allowed a baseline separation of ten vitamins within a single run, seven water-soluble and three fat-soluble, using three different chromatographic modes: some positively charged vitamins are eluted in ion exclusion and ion repulsion modes whereas the negatively charged molecules are eluted in the ion exchange mechanism. The non-charged molecules are eluted in a classical reversed-phase mode, regarding their polarities. The method was validated for the vitamin analysis in tablets, evaluating selectivity, robustness, linearity, accuracy, and precision. The validated method was finally employed for the analysis of the vitamin content of some commercially available supplement tablets. Copyright Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the laying duck breeding areas such as Honghu, Jianli, Xiantao, Tianmen and Hanchuan citys in Hubei Province, the culturists are used to feeding fresh pondweeds to the laying ducks. The yolk of duck's eggs is natural red with the chrominance reaching up to and/or above RCF (Roche Yolk Color Fan) 15. The red pigment components of natural red yolk of duck's eggs were separated and identified by thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS-MS) and high resolution electron impact-mass spectrometry (EI-MS). Four isomers of red pigments were separated by HPLC on a RP-C18 column with methanol-water (99.5:0.5, v/v) as mobile phase. The lambda(max) of the four components were 482, 488, 496, 501 nm, respectively, and all of them were single peak on chromatogram. They had the same molecular mass (Mr = 562), and had the same fragment peaks of MS2 with rhodoxanthin. The molecular formula of red pigments was determined as C40H50O2 by high resolution EI-MS. The results indicate that the red pigment is rhodoxanthin, and they are all cis-isomers of rhodoxanthin.\n\nMonolithic poly(1,2-bis(p-vinylphenyl)ethane) capillary columns for simultaneous separation of low- and high-molecular-weight compounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreiderer, Andreas; Ligon, S Clark; Huck, Christian W; Bonn, GÃ¼nther K\n\n2009-08-01\n\nMonolithic poly(1,2-bis(p-vinylphenyl)ethane (BVPE)) capillary columns were prepared by thermally initiated free radical polymerisation of 1,2-bis(p-vinylphenyl)ethane in the presence of inert diluents (porogens) and alpha,alpha'-azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. Polymerisations were accomplished in 200 microm ID fused silica capillaries at 65 degrees C and for 60 min. Mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements of the polymeric RP support showed a broad bimodal pore-size-distribution of mesopores and small macropores in the range of 5-400 nm and flow-channels in the mum range. N(2)-adsorption (BET) analysis resulted in a tremendous enhancement of surface area (101 m(2)/g) of BVPE stationary phases compared to typical organic monoliths (approximately 20 m(2)/g), indicating the presence of a considerable amount of mesopores. Consequently, the adequate proportion of both meso- and (small) macropores allowed the rapid and high-resolution separation of low-molecular-weight compounds as well as biomolecules on the same monolithic support. At the same time, the high fraction of flow-channels provided enhanced column permeability. The chromatographic performance of poly(1,2-bis(p-vinylphenyl)ethane) capillary columns for the separation of biomolecules (proteins, oligonucleotides) and small molecules (alkyl benzenes, phenols, phenons) are demonstrated in this article. Additionally, pressure drop versus flow rate measurements of novel poly(1,2-bis(p-vinylphenyl)ethane) capillary columns confirmed high mechanical robustness, low swelling in organic solvents and high permeability. Due to the simplicity of monolith fabrication, comprehensive studies of the retention and separation behaviour of monolithic BVPE columns resulted in high run-to-run and batch-to-batch reproducibilities. All these attributes prove the excellent applicability of monolithic poly(1,2-bis(p-vinylphenyl)ethane) capillary columns for micro-HPLC towards a huge range of analytes of different\n\nDirect-injection HPLC method of measuring micafungin in human plasma using a novel hydrophobic/hydrophilic hybrid ODS column.\n\nPubMed\n\nUranishi, Hiroaki; Nakamura, Mitsuhiro; Nakamura, Hiroki; Ikeda, Yukari; Otsuka, Mayuko; Kato, Zenichiro; Tsuchiya, Teruo\n\n2011-04-15\n\nA direct-injection HPLC-based method has been developed for determining amounts of micafungin in human plasma using a novel hydrophobic/hydrophilic hybrid ODS column. The method is easy to perform and requires only 10 Î¼L of a filtered plasma sample. The chromatographic separations were carried out with a gradient mode. The fluorescence detection wavelengths of excitation and emission were set at 273 nm and 464 nm, respectively. Retention times for micafungin and IS were 22.4 and 23.7 min, respectively. Micafungin and FR195743 (IS) peaks were completely separated with little tailing, and no interference was observed. The calibration curve of micafungin showed good linearity in the range of 0.5-20.0 Î¼g/mL (r(2)=1.00). The intra-day accuracy ranged from -4.5 to 5.3%. The inter-day accuracy ranged from -9.8 to 1.5%. The precisions were less than 10%. This method is useful for the determination of micafungin in human plasma. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The two-phase solvent system was composed of petroleum ether-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (3:7:1:9, v/v), where 20 mM of triethylamine (TEA) was added to the upper phase as a retainer and 5 mM of hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the aqueous phase as an eluter. In this experiment, the apparatus with an adjustable length of the separation column was used for the separation of alkaloids from D. scandens and the resolution of the compounds can be remarkably improved by increasing the length of the separation column. As a result, 70 mg protopin, 30 mg (+) corydine, 120 mg (+) isocorydine and 40 mg (+) glaucine were obtained from 1.0 g of the crude extracts and each with 99.2%, 96.5%, 99.3%, 99.5% purity as determined by HPLC. The chemical structures of these compounds were confirmed by positive ESI-MS and (1)H NMR. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, this work aimed to assay certain flavonoid glycosides of elderflower that could not be identified/quantified by other similar on-line HPLC methods (i.e. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhdrazyl and 2, 2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). To identify anti-oxidant constituents in elderflower by HPLC and to evaluate their individual anti-oxidant capacities by on-line HPLC-CUPRAC assay with a post-column derivatisation system. The separation and UV detection of polyphenols were performed on a C18 -column using gradient elution with two different mobile phase solutions, that is acetonitrile and 1% glacial acetic acid, with detection at 340ânm. The HPLC-separated anti-oxidant polyphenols in column effluent react with copper(II)-neocuproine in a reaction-coil to reduce the latter to copper(I)-neocuproine (Cu(I)-Nc) chelate having maximum absorption at 450ânm. The detection limits of tested compounds at 450ânm after post-column derivatisation were compared with those of at 340ânm UV-detection without derivatisation. LOD values (Âµg/mL) of quercetin and its glycosides at 450ânm were lower than those of UV detection at 340ânm. This method was applied successfully to elderflower extract. The flavonol glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol bound to several sugar components (glucose, rhamnose, galactose and rutinose) were identified in the sample. The on-line HPLC-CUPRAC method was advantageous over on-line ABTS and DPPH methods for measuring the flavonoid glycosides of elderflower.
