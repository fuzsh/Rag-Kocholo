        "text": "Neuropeptides are small messenger molecules that can be found in all metazoans, where they govern a diverse array of physiological processes. Because neuropeptides seem to be conserved among pest species, selected peptides can be considered as attractive targets for drug discovery. Much can be learned from the model system Caenorhabditis elegans because of the availability of a sequenced genome and state-of-the-art postgenomic technologies that enable characterization of endogenous peptides derived from neuropeptide-like protein (NLP) precursors. Here, we provide an overview of the NLP peptide family in C. elegans and discuss their resemblance with arthropod neuropeptides and their relevance for anthelmintic discovery.\n\nPolyketides and nonribosomal peptides are two important types of natural products that are produced by many species of bacteria and fungi but are exceedingly rare in metazoans. Here, we elucidate the structure of a hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide from Caenorhabditis elegans that is produced in the canal-associated neurons (CANs) and promotes survival during starvation-induced larval arrest. Our results uncover a novel mechanism by which animals respond to nutrient fluctuations to extend survival.\n\nFMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) are a diverse group of neuropeptides that are expressed abundantly in nematodes. They exert potent physiological effects on locomotory, feeding and reproductive musculature and also act as neuromodulators. However, little is known about the specific expression patterns and functions of individual peptides. The current study employed rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) to characterizeflpgenes from infective juveniles of the root knot nematodes,Meloidogyne incognitaandMeloidogyne minor. The peptides identified from these transcripts are sequelogs of FLPs from the free-living nematode,Caenorhabditis elegans; the genes have therefore been designated asMi-flp-1,Mi-flp-7,Mi-flp-12,Mm-flp-12andMi-flp-14.Mi-flp-1encodes five FLPs with the common C-terminal moiety, NFLRFamide.Mi-flp-7encodes two copies of APLDRSALVRFamide and APLDRAAMVRFamide and one copy of APFDRSSMVRFamide.Mi-flp-12andMm-flp-12encode the novel peptide KNNKFEF..."
