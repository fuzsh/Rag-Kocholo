National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Ames Research Center,Moffett Field, CA September 2005 www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/astrogram/2005/05astrograms.html Combined Federal Campaign launches On Sept. 19, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin released the results of the agency's Exploration Systems Ar- chitecture Study - a blueprint for the next generation of spacecraft to take humans back to the moon and on to Mars and other destinations. The study makes specific design recommendations for a vehicle to carry crews into space, a family of launch vehicles to take crews to the moon and beyond, and a \"lunar mission architec- ture\" for landing on the moon. It also recommends the technologies NASA should pursue in the near term. The study will assist NASA in achieving President Bush's Vision for Space Exploration, which calls for the agency to safely return the space shuttle to flight, complete the International Space Station, return to the moon, and continue exploration of Mars and be- yond. America's next generation space- craft will use an improved, blunt-body crewcapsule,andwillaccommodateup to six people. \"This spacecraft and its systems will build upon the foundation of the proven designs and technologies used in the Apollo and space shuttle programs, while having far greater ca- pability,\" Griffin said. \"It will be able to carrylargerandheaviercargosintospace and allow more people to stay on the moon for longer periods of time.\" The new spacecraft can be config- ured either to support human explorers or fly unpiloted to carry cargo. Its de- sign allows the flexibility to ferry crews of three astronauts, plus additional sup- plies,toandfromtheInternationalSpace Administrator unveils strategy for space exploration Station, take four crew members to lu- narorbit,andeventuallymaintainupto six astronauts on a mission to Mars. Crews and cargo will be carried into orbit by a space shuttle-derived launch system, consisting of a solid rocket booster and an upper stage pow- ered by a shuttle main engine that can lift 25 metric tons. The spacecraft also will be 10 times safer than the space shuttle because of its in-line design and launch-abort system. NASA chose the shuttle-derivedoptionforitslaunchsys- tem due to its superior safety, cost and its availability.

I would like to thank my many friends at Ames for an unforgettable 80th birthday party. Those who believe they have accomplished something in their lives should pause for a moment and consider all those who helped them along the way. I certainly had that opportunity on my birthday, when you all helped me and my family to celebrate it. It was truly the pinnacle of the many events I have celebrated at NASA. I am honored and proud to be a part of this incredible family. I thank you! -- Ol’ Jack NASA Ames celebrates historian Jack Boyd’s birthday Fewpeoplehaveinfluencedthecul- ture and ethos of NASA, and especially of NASA Ames, as profoundly as Jack Boyd. Throughouthisfirst58yearsofpub- lic service, Boyd's work, words and smiles have welcomed us all into the Ames family. Perhaps he is like a fine wine, that only gets deeper and more enjoyable with age. For all that he is, his dedication to the center has earned him countless circles of friends around the center, and thesecirclesoffriendsjoinedtogetherat Ames to celebrate his 80th birthday on Aug. 19 in the NASA Ames Conference Center. Like Boyd's office door, the invita- tion was open to everyone -- to all those he has mentored, inspired, advised, re- lied upon, calmed, researched beside and committeed with. NASAphotosbyDominicHart Several members of NASA Ames' Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART), representing several special- ties, have responded to calls for on-the- scene support of rescue and recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Shortly after the disaster occurred, theNASAAmesEmergencyOperations Center(EOC)wasactivatedandworked with the NASA Headquarters EOC and withotherEOCsthroughouttheagency supporting NASA's hurricane relief ef- forts. Robert J. Dolci, director of emer- gency services at Ames, was called to support the Stennis Space Center EOC led by Bill Parsons, who was recently named the new director of Stennis, near Gulfport, Miss. Both Stennis and the Michoud As- sembly Facility near New Orleans, La., were hit hard by the hurricane. Ap- proximately 3,500 NASA civil service and contractor employees work at the two facilities, in addition to some 4,600 employees of other federal agencies. On Aug. 30, DART water rescue specialist John Preston was deployed as part of a 14-person flood response team sent to the hurricane zone by California Task Force 3 out of Menlo Park. The teamreturnedtotheBayAreaon Sept.16. Ames assists hurricane relief efforts DART rescue specialists Mark Tangney, Roger Miller, Lynn Bala, Paul Brown, Eric Mueller, Kelly Kasser and Erik Rockwell deployed with the 70- person California Task Force 3 on Aug. 31 to support the search and rescue and recoveryeffortsintheNewOrleansarea. On Sept. 16, CNN covered the rescue of a 71-year old man by members of the task force. Tangney, deputy chief of DART, reported that the team was ac- companied by the Coast Guard, U.S. FishandGame,andtheNationalGuard, for security. A three-person emergency commu- nications team from NASA Ames flew toHuntsville,Ala.,tohelpestablishcom- munications at Michoud. The team also shipped emergency communications equipment and purchased $50,000 of satellite time to support satellite com- munications. Team members included Bill Notley and Bill Hunt (QSS) of Code JTN, and Code TN network engineer Dave Hartzell. Michael Wright also de- ployed to support the emergency com- munications team in early September.

Scott Hubbard out- lined the changes and challenges fac- ing Ames during NASA's transfor- mation to meet the requirements of the Vision for Space Exploration. Hubbard assured employees that \"Ames is not closing or being starved out.\" Nonetheless, Hubbard also warned that some of the effects of the transformation would be painful for AmesoverthenextfewyearsasNASA makes the most sweeping changes in 35 years. Among the challenges facing Ames is a budget shortfall of some $250 million in FY 2007, compared with FY 2004. As a result, Ames has an unfunded work force of about 700 people in FY 2006 - 300 civil servants and 400 contractors, according to Hubbard. Although the center did get a very important boost from the agency through the commitment to create an agency-wide transition pro- cess that will help take unfunded civil servants through FY 2006, Hubbard said Ames will initiate re- ductionsinitson-sitecontractorwork force and begin developing a new transition work force pool for civil servants. \"We will make every effort to find new work for our civil servant staff either at Ames or elsewhere in NASA,\" Hubbard vowed. He noted thatthecentersthatareprimaryben- eficiaries of the Vision for Space Ex- ploration cannot hire new employ- ees to support the Vision without first consulting with other centers, like Ames, to see if the work can be done there. Positive news included the fact thatAmeshasbeenassignedthenew Robotic Lunar Exploration Program and will play a major role in NASA's next lunar mission. In addition, Ames will be on the critical path for the CEV with respect to thermal pro- tectionsystemsandinformationtech- nologies. Hubbard predicted that other opportunities will follow as Ames demonstrates it can deliver. \"If we all work together, we can manageourwaythroughthisvalley andcomeouttheothersidestronger and healthier,\" Hubbard asserted.\n\n5. 5Astrogram September 2005 Question: What types of contraband items are located during random vehicle inspections? Answer: The following items have been found during vehicle inspections: Firearms, unlawful knives, unlawful weapons (brass knuckles, billy clubs, etc.), drugs and drug paraphernalia.

Astrogram September 20056 Green sand found on the big island of Hawaii resembles olivine crystals in the icy interior of comet Tempel 1, ac- cording to a NASA Ames astrophysi- cist. Scientistsrevealedthattheydetected greensilicatecrystals(olivine)inTempel 1 similar to, but smaller than, Hawaiian green sand particles, according to ar- ticles by the researchers in the Sept. 15, 2005, issue of the journal Science Ex- press. They made their observations before,duringandaftertheNASADeep Impact spacecraft's 820-pound 'impac- tor' collided with the comet in early July 2005, as planned, so astronomers could determinewhatisincomets.Thepapers outline findings scientists made using infrared detectors on the Gemini and Subaru telescopes in Hawaii. \"Thesilicatecrystalsaretalcumpow- der-size, but they are made of the same materials as the green sand beaches in Hawaii,\" said Ames' Diane Wooden, a co-author of both papers. The principal author of the Gemini Telescope paper is David Harker, University of California, San Diego. Seiji Sugita of the University of Tokyo is the principal author of the second Subaru Telescope paper. \"Followingthecollisionofthecomet with the 'impactor,' there was a short- lived gas geyser associated with the impactsitethatcarriedthecrystalsfrom Tempel1intospace,\"Woodensaid.\"The Gemini and the Subaru telescopes are two of the biggest in the world, and we were able to focus in on the green dust particlesinthejetandejecta-something that most space-borne telescopes could not see in infrared light,\" she noted. “TheinsidesofcometTempel1look very much like the outsides of comets that have not been 'cooked' by passages close to the sun,\" Wooden said. She ex- plained that there might be green sili- cates on the surfaces of comets that swarm in the outer reaches of the solar system and are not exposed to intense sunshine. Another comet, Hale-Bopp, was so activethatitreleasedgreensilicatecrys- tals as it passed close to the sun in 1997, according to Wooden. \"However, the Deep Impact spacecraft's 'impactor' had to blast the green silicate crystals from the interior of the comet Tempel 1 for us to see them with our ground-based instruments,\" she noted. Tempel 1 travels close to the sun during part of the comet's orbit, and strong sunlight hits the comet, causing its surface gases and other particles to fly off into space. These particles are whatmakeupacomet'stail,whichforms nearerthesun.\"InTempel1'scase,ithas passed near the sun so many times that it has lost much of its surface gases and particles,\" said Wooden. \"What's incredible to me is that the surface - or maybe the fluffiness of the body of Tempel 1 -- is protecting the primitive particles and gases just below thesurfacefrombeingout-gassed,\"ven- tured Wooden. \"We discovered crystalline silicates inthedustthatflewfromthecometafter its collision with the Deep Impact 'im- pactor.' We don't usually see these sili- cates in comets that have been 'cooked' by the sun,\" Wooden explained.

Future lunar explo- ration missions will be supported by a heavy cargo launch vehicle consisting of five space shuttle main engines, and two five-segment shuttle solid-propel- lant rocket boosters. This combination yields a lift capability of 106 metric tons to low Earth orbit, and 125 metric tons, if it incorporates an Earth-departure stage.

NASA's return to the moon will open opportunities for fundamental science in astrobiology, lunar geology, exobiol- ogy, astronomy and physics. The journey will start with robotic missionsbetween2008and2011tostudy, map and learn about the lunar surface. These early missions will help deter- mine lunar landing sites and whether resources, such as oxygen, hydrogen and metals, are available for use in NASA's long-term lunar exploration objectives.

Philpott eventually went on to head the electron microscope facility and re- tired in 1990. But long before NASA, Philpott was an Army foot solider in WorldWarIIwhenfateputhimsquarely in the middle of one of the great turning points in 20th century history, 60 years ago this year. On April 25, 1945, Russian and AmericantroopsjoinedforcesinTorgau, Germany,ontheElbeRiver.Thelink-up unified the eastern and western fronts of the war in Europe and effectively divided Germany in two. It marked the beginningoftheColdWar.Asoneofthe 69thInfantrysoldiersgatheredtherethat day, Philpott was photographed in a groupofAmericanandRussiansoldiers ( see above photo) happily reaching out to greet each other. This historic mo- ment was captured by camera and ap- pearedinnewspapersaroundtheworld. Sixty years later, former soldiers from50countrieswereinvitedtoRussia foragrandcommemorationofthe‘Great Patriotic War,’ as the war is known to Russians. Philpott was one of the 10 American veterans believed to partici- pate in a huge celebration in Moscow on May 9. Philpott felt that this 60th anni- versary gathering would be a great and heartwarming experience. He also felt some responsibilityin representingthe veterans, espe- ciallythosewho were killed. 70,000 troops werebroughtin fortightenedse- curity in Red Square. After many speeches by world lead- ers and miles of military pa- rades,theveter- answereinvited to the Kremlin for an official state banquet. Philpottthoughthewouldbesittingata table with his fellow vets, but upon arriving, he was asked to sit at the ‘Presidents’Table’ with heads of statesastherepre- sentative of the veterans group. To his surprise, Philpott was seated alongside the presidents of China and Russia, as well as Presi- dentBush. Hehad thepleasureofsit- ting next to First Lady Laura Bush. “I turned to Mrs. Bush and asked her if she can do me a fa- vor.” She looked at me with astonish- ment. “Can you pinch me, because I don’tbelievethisishappening,”Philpott said. Mrs. Bush was very gracious and easy to chat with. Philpott was inform- ing her about a book that he and his wife had edited called ‘Hands Across the Elbe,’ and that he had been trying to give a copy to President Bush and Rus- sian President Putin. Mrs. Bush raised her hand and her assistant ran to her. She stated, “Make sure President Bush and President Putin get a copy of this book.” Philpott then asked Mrs. Bush if it was possible to get a picture of him with President Bush. Mrs. Bush, once again, raised her hand and this time, caught Mr. Bush’s eye. Mrs. Bush let Mr. Bush know that Philpott wanted to take a picture with him. The president re- sponded“youdon’twantapicturewith just one president,” so President Bush asked President Putin to join in the pic- ture. Philpott was ecstatic. Since retiring from NASA, Philpott has periodically worked at Ames with visiting Russian scientists on the Cos- mosprogram. Hisspaceradiationstud- ies were flown on three of the Russian Cosmos satellites. Philpott also partici- pated in flying five pocket mice to the moon on Apollo 17 and had experi- ments on several shuttle flights. He and his wife later edited the ‘Hands Across the Elbe’ book, a collection of some of the Russian – American link-up stories.

Scott Hubbard. \"He took on the tough chal- lenge of helping the organization trans- formitselfwithdetermination,courage, vision and skill. Skip's hard work and leadership are an inspiration to us all.\" \"Dr. Fletcher has been a valuable asset to Ames and to the agency during his time at Ames. His knowledge of fundamental aerodynamics, coupled with a ready understanding of new are- nas for research such as air traffic man- agement modernization, have helped maintain Ames's continued contribu- tionstoaeronautics,\"saidAssociateAd- ministrator for Aeronautics Research at NASAHeadquarters, J.VictorLebacqz. Lebacqz served as Ames' deputy aero- nautics director under Fletcher before taking his post at headquarters. Because of these efforts, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) looks to Ames as the leader in the develop- mentofdecisionsupportsoftwareanda partner in the transformation of the National Airspace System. Today, soft- ware tools such as Surface Management Advisor and Multi-Center Traffic Man- agement Advisor are installed at some of the nation's major airports with fur- ther plans for expansion. Ames also has actively pursued the developmentofremotelycontrolledand autonomous aircraft and strengthened the capabilities of Ames' world-class simulation facilities. With advances in computer simula- tion and the implementation of 'full cost recovery,' physical facilities like wind tunnels, ballistic ranges and arc jets de- creased in importance for many deci- sion makers. Under Fletcher's leader- ship, Ames was able to maintain much of that expertise and capability. Ames strengthened partnerships with tradi- tional aeronautics partners and actively pursued partnerships with other NASA centers non-traditional partners. This foresight paid dividends dur- ing the Mars Exploration Rover mission and NASA's Return to Flight efforts. The wind tunnel, ballistic range and arc jets were integral in verifying the com- puter models used in the redesign of the space shuttle and subsequent mission support,includingemergencywindtun- nel tests on the shuttle's thermal blanket to determine its safety for re-entry.

JacobSmithpassed away on June 28, 2005, surrounded by his wife, his five children, and several grandchildren, as they sang hymns around his bedside. Smith was 91 years old,andhadbeenmarriedtohiswifefor 65 years. Smith was born in Brewton Ala., on June3,1914. HisfatherdiedwhenSmith was very young, and he spent his child- hood being raised by his mother. Life was difficult for Smith’s family, but he had a wonderful relationship with his brother, Gordon, and his two sisters, AltheaandVivian. Soonafterhisgradu- ation from high school, he left Alabama for Chicago, where he lived briefly be- fore making the trek to California. Shortly after arriving, he met the love of his life, Helen Beatrice Evans. And that love affair continued until he drew his final breath, as she held his hand. In other words, when Smith and Helen said “Til death do us part,” they meant it. Smith and Helen had been resi- dents of the Redding area since they retired from Ames, moving from the Bay Area to Palo Cedro in 1971. Prior to that,Smith(hisfriendscalledhim“Jake”) workedforNASAattheAmesResearch Center at Moffett Field, serving as chief aircraftinspectorformorethan30years. Duringthattime,hetraveledalloverthe world as part of the Ames Research team,doingscientificstudiesonvarious phenomenan in the atmosphere sur- rounding Earth, including the northern lights. Smithlovedflyingairplanes and scientific expeditions, and he enjoyed traveling. But working at Moffett Field —and anyone who knew Smith could tell you this — was not his only love and passion. Smith’s other real passion, and the center of his life was his undying love for his family … and his God. During his tenure at Moffett, and in addition to holding a full-time position there, few of the people who worked with Smith every day knew that he also served as the superintendent of the Peniel Rescue Mission. The skid-row mission(whichisnolongerinexistence) provided food and clothing for men liv- ing on the streets of San Jose. And seven-nights-a-week—for 12 1/2 years — Smith directed the caring ministry of thatmission. Eachnight,hewouldgoto the mission, often with his wife and his children,andoverseethepreparationof a hot meal, and conduct a gospel service for the street people of San Jose. Smith was not a preacher. He was, however, someone who cared about people. And that concern for people was an incred- ible motivating theme throughout his entire life. One of the primary reasons Smith moved to Palo Cedro to “retire” was so he and his wife could begin a foster home for troubled kids. His beautiful home and acreage in the rolling hills east of Redding provided a wonderful setting for such an endeavor. For sev- eral years after their retirement, Smith andHelenprovidedahomefortroubled kids. They called it ‘Blue Oak Ranch.’ Later in their retirement, working with kids and teens became less feasible forthem,andtheydecidedtofocustheir attention on helping small churches. They purchased a motor home and be- came a part of MAPS, a volunteer orga- nization that provides construction as- sistanceforchurcheswhoneedit. Smith and Helen traveled throughout Califor- niaandOregon,workingalongsideother volunteers,bringingencouragementand a helping hand to small or struggling churches that needed assistance with remodeling or new construction. In recent years, Smith and Helen were a part of Gideons International, a Bibledistributionorganizationthat pro- vides free copies of the scriptures to hotelsandmotels,hospitalsandthosein the medical profession, and the Armed Forces of the United States. Smith’s car or van always had several copies of the Bible handy for distribution to anyone he might happen to see. Smith loved to go to church on Sundays, and for the pastseveralyears,heandhiswife called Bethel Church in Redding their church home. Most people may not be aware that oneoutofahundredpeopleintheUnited States has ‘Smith’ as a last name. But make no mistake about it. Jake Smith wasn’t one in a hundred. He wasn’t even one in a thousand, or one in a million. An uncommon ‘common’ man died this summer in Palo Cedro. And thebestepitaphthatcanbewrittenabout his life is a four-word phrase, ‘He was, quite simply: ‘One of a kind.’ ‘One of a kind’ Jacob Smith passes away in Palo Cedro BY KEN JONES Jacob Smith Festival patrons ‘travel to Mars’ NASA photo by Astrid Terlep Throngs of visitors stopped by the NASA tent at the Mountain View Art and Wine Festival on the weekend of Sept. 10 to Sept. 11 to learn more about NASA and for a chance to appear that they had visited Mars.

Astrogram September 200512 Interns get rare opportunity to solve shuttle problem Students who participated in NASA's Return-to-Flight efforts (left to right) Derrick Chu, Amela Zanacic, Kurt Long (advisor), Kristi Stavros and Teresa Quinliven. BY JENNIFER KREMER After the first scrubbed launch on July 13, 2005, the world waited for the go-ahead to launch space shuttle Dis- covery and her crew into orbit for the first time in two-and-a-half years. What the world didn't see, were the many factors involved in getting the green light for “all systems go.” In July, James Ross, chief of the ExperimentalAero-PhysicsBranch,was briefedaboutfrozenwaterdropletsthat havebeenaccumulatingandthendrop- ping off the space shuttle orbiter during ascent. No wind tunnel tests had ever beenconductedonthedragcharacteris- tics of such ice particle shapes. As a result, the team conducting computa- tional fluid dynamics (CFD) on the tra- jectory of these ice particles had to rely onestimatesforthedragcharacteristics. This aspect of the analysis had a critical bearing on whether, and if so, where, the particles may impact the orbiter. Ross approached US Navy flight test engineer Kurt Long to gather a team to conductawindtunneltestoficeparticle effects on the shuttle test. Later that same day, five student interns fromAmes'EducationalAssoci- ates (EA) program and Summer High School Apprenticeship Research Pro- gram (SHARP) in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory(FML),werediligentlywork- ingontheirsummerprojectsusingwind tunnelswhenLongpresentedthemwith an opportunity of a lifetime: to team together and provide support for NASA's shuttle return-to-flight efforts. “The team required just over five hours to plan, design/construct hard- ware, stop existing wind tunnel testing, reconfigure the wind tunnel, calibrate instrumentation, collect data, analyze data and then provide the data to the sponsor,” explained Long. “We had wind tunnels available since the stu- dents have been working on projects in them; however, the challenge for this testwastofigureoutwhichwindtunnel to use,” he added. \"We decided on the FML's test cell number two wind tunnel and began reconfiguringitforthistest,\"saidAmela Zanacic, a student from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The team decided to use this tunnel because of its ease of reconfiguration, ability to acquire force and moment data, and its ability to rep- resent the full-scale aerodynamic char- acteristics of the ice particles. As the project got underway, there wasaclearsenseofurgency. “Thewhole processwaschaotic. Weweretoldtoget sometools-itdidn'tmatterwhatkindof tools, just get any tools! And when they began drilling holes in the floor of the wind tunnel, it really freaked us out,” explained Zanacic. The holes were added to the wind tunnel floor plate to facilitate rapid model mounting and reconfigurationforthiseffort;sincemost wind tunnel models employ standard- ized mounting lugs, this step is rarely employed. “Scrambling was a lot of fun,” she laughed. The team cut a two-and-half-inch- diameter acrylic sphere into quarters to simulate the shape of the ice particles affixedtotheorbiter. Thequartersphere wasthenattachedtoaneight-inchsting, a mounting device with a very sensitive balance that would measure forces and moments on the object in three different orientations relative to the flow direc- tion. The model and balance were then installed within the wind tunnel test section, and the tunnel was run at vari- ous speeds to measure the resultant forces on the ‘ice particle.’ The resultant data were analyzed to ensure accuracy, andthenprovidedtoNASAshuttlepro- gram personnel, to help predict the ice particle trajectories during the shuttle's ascent. The data also were used in a briefing to shuttle program personnel during a shuttle go/no go launch meet- ing the very next morning (a Saturday). “The experience reinforced what I am doing and studying in order to be- come an engineer. Engineering is excit- ing!” exclaimed Kristi Stavros, a stu- dent from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. “It is great to work with student interns. It allows us to teach the next generationandreceivefresh,newideas. This project brought the students out of the realm of theory and provided them with real-world applicability and a feel- ing of self-satisfaction,” said Long. “When you work at NASA, you al- ways hear about the 'glory days of NASA,' referring to the 60s and 70s. As interns,wewereabletogetatasteofthat feeling from the past and experience the feeling of teamwork,” said Zanacic. “In- ternsneverthinktheywouldgetachance to work on this type of project. They dream of this moment,” added Teresa Quinliven, a student from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, who missed this opportu- nity due to her first flight lesson toward her helicopter pilot's license.

This is thetasktowhichwehavebeenassigned in the Ames Exploration Encounter. FromSeptemberthroughJune,theAmes ExplorationEncounterisfilledwithstu- dents from all over California and Ne- vada. Students from public schools, private schools and home schools have the opportunity to visit a world-class facility and to immerse themselves in the study of space, science and technol- ogy. Thereisonegroupofstudentswhose education is not a first priority, as their parents are forced to travel from field to field, their lives ruled by growing sea- sons that don't match the school calen- dar. These children miss weeks or months of school. Most face an addi- tionalchallengebecausetheydon'tspeak English.Thesearethechildrenwhohave moved more times than the years they have been alive. These are the migrant students. Migrant students are among the neediest students in California schools. Migrantfamiliesmovefrequentlyasthey follow work in the agriculture, fishing, dairyorloggingindustry.UndertheNo Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA), sup- port is provided to help reduce the edu- cational disruption and other problems that result from repeated moves. The law states that migrant education ser- vices are a priority for those students whose education has been interrupted during the current school year and who arefailing,oraremostatriskoffailingto meetstatecontentandperformancestan- dards. Throughacollaborativepartnership between NASA Ames Exploration En- counter and San Jose Unified School District Migrant Education Program, more than 125 students attended the AmesExplorationEncounter.Underthe leadership of San Jose Unified School District Migrant Education Director Amelia Romero and Principal Albert Moreno the students were provided a high-quality and comprehensive edu- cationalprogramformigratorychildren this summer. Before their visit to the Ames Exploration En- counter, AEE op- erations manager Lorraine Ruiz and volunteer docent RenatoPiombipre- sentedtheprogram in Spanish to the students at their school. Excitement was high, as the students had been watching televi- sion and heard about the Discov- ery mission. Many of them had heard about astronaut candidate Jose Hernandez, who also was the son of migrant parents. Their goal was to visit NASA and meet a “real space celeb- rity”! They certainly werenotdisappointed as they had an oppor- tunity to meet NASA Ames’ very own Jolen Flores, Ph.D. They all asked for a copy of the June/July2005issueof ‘Hispanic Engineer’ magazine so that they could have a copy of Flores ‘ article about how he was named one of the ‘Top His- panics in Technology and Business.’ Flores gave students an out- standing presentation on his career at NASA Ames. We are very fortu- natetohaveagroupof docentsthatvolunteer in the AEE who took time out of their sum- mer vacations to join the migrant students visit to the Ames Ex- ploration Encounter. For the first time since itsinception,theAmes ExplorationEncounter Program was pre- sented in a bilingual/ English/Spanish for- mat. With the support and encourage- ment of the education division manage- ment, Mark Leon and Laura Shawnee, aswellasPlannersCollaborativevolun- teer manager Barbara Patterson, opera- tions manager Lorraine Ruiz and assis- tantmanagerLorraineWentz,125Span- ish-speaking students were given the opporutnity to become NASA’s next generation of scientists, engineers and astronauts. Perhaps some day we will see one or more of them on the cover of Hispanic Engineer magazine. BY LORRAINE RUIZ\n\n14.
