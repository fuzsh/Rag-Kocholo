        "text": "Ever-changing definition\n\nThe definition of autism has changed over the decades and could change in future years as we understand more. Some people feel the spectrum is too broad, arguing an autistic person with 24/7 support needs cannot be compared with a person who finds supermarket lights too bright. We often find that autistic people and their families with different support needs share many of the same challenges, whether that’s getting enough support from mental health, education and social care services or being misunderstood by people close to them. We will continue to fight to make society work for autistic people.\n\nHow many people are autistic\n\nIt is important to know how many autistic people there are for several reasons, including helping to provide support, as well as showing the sheer number and diversity of autistic people. This is also called “autism prevalence”. It is an estimate of how many autistic people there are in the UK. It is not the same as the number of autistic people who have a diagnosis and many autistic people might not have been identified or even know yet themselves. As autism understanding has grown, the estimated prevalence has also changed.\n\nGovernment prevalence surveys last estimated that around one in 100 people are autistic. However, because these are estimates this is not definite. Other surveys and international estimates have come up with different prevalence estimates. Most of them suggest autism prevalence is higher. The National Autistic Society thinks the UK governments should do more research into autism prevalence to find an updated figure. Until that research is done, we believe that more than one in 100 people are autistic, which means more than 700,000 people in the UK.\n\nHaving an accurate prevalence figure is vital. We all need to know this to improve support and understanding, and to create a society that works for autistic people."
