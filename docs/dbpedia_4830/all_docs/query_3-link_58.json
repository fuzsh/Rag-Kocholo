Itâs a good and simple editing system that is really fun to use. But, there are a few things that I wish would change. First of all, the space it takes up. I don't know if there is anything you can do about this, but whenever I record little snippets for a movie, they save to my photos. And I hate that! And to make it worse, when I delete them, I canât watch that part I filmed in the movie cause I deleted it. And yes, I know. There is something you can do about it. You finish the movie, save to photos, then you can delete all the snippets from your photos. But I wish I didnât have to do that. I just wish it didnât add it to my photos in general. Second, the trailers. I wish there was a bit more freedom to the trailers. The app chooses everything for you. You get to pick the topic and everything, but I wish there was more. I donât like how iMovie chooses the music, how long the clips have to be, and how long the trailer is in the first place. I donât usually write reviews, but this app deserved one. Other than some of my complaints, this was a really good app. Everything is free and available, there are more editing possibilities, and it looks very professional. Again, if thereâs anything you can do about my complaints, I would do it. I feel like these are common complaints and you would get more buyers if you fixed or changed them. Thanks!\n\nPup pup pup cute ,\n\nPerfect For Everyone.â¤ï¸ But one recommendation.\n\nSo I love this app. Iâve been using it for a few weeks and I can create some really cool stuff. Iâve been getting more advanced with the editing, and I love everything it can do. You can put text, backgrounds, photos, you name it. My only problem is the music. I have seen some awesome clips and they all have good music. The songs on here donât have words (from what Iâve seen) and Iâve been really wanting to create a clip with popular songs. This app is much better then other editing apps Iâve seen, itâs simple and easy to use, beginners wonât find it confusing. (I didnât.) Just play around a little bit, and youâll soon figure it out. It also has more advanced stuff. So many different options here, and itâs all easy to use! Iâm on an IPhone, and I havenât had the storage or lag problems other people talk about. On a computer it is a bit more complicated, but if you are looking for complex editing I recommend using that. The trailers are also amazing. You have so many different options, and it looks so cool and professional! Overall, super simple and easy to use, perfect for anything! Hope this review helped you, and it would be amazing if the developers could add more to the music! If you are an expert editor or you just want to experiment, this app is perfect for everyone!!\n\nMydawg_Mydawg ,\n\nAlmost great!\n\nI like iMovie.
