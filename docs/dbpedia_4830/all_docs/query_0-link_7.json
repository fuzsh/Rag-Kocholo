        "text": "In Queens, Mike Keegan is celebrating with his wife Ellie, his son Tommy and friends his recent promotion to detective in a precinct in Manhattan.\n\nMeanwhile, in a fancy club, socialite Claire Gregory witnesses the murder of the owner of the place by powerful mobster Joey Venza.\n\nMike is assigned to protect her in the night shift in her apartment in Manhattan.\n\nWhen Venza threatens Claire, the contact of Mike with Claire gets closer and conflicts him, dividing between the love for his family and the heat passion for Claire and the fascination for her world...\n\nHo Hum, coming from Scott I was expecting something more stylish than a few canapes and a Fine Young Cannibals soundtrack. It's not that the film is bad, it's just so slow and tiresome that it feels like you're watching an epic.\n\nAnd it's the same old story. Rich woman witnesses a murder, gets a poorer cop to do the titular job, they fall for each other etc. etc.\n\nthe only thing thats missing is Billy Joels 'Uptown Girl' being played every five minutes, to remind people of the class divide.\n\nSo thanks for Berenger, Rogers, and Bracco for putting in such good performances, therwise this film would have sunk quicker than the Titanic. The chemistry between the three leads is so convincing, you would think that they were doing this for real.\n\nSo all on all it's the weakest Scott film i've seen, just lacking in involvement or proper narration.\n\n\"Someone To Watch Over Me\" is a visual treat with some exceptionally beautiful shots (such as those of New York City at night and a number of stunning interiors) which together with a marvellous musical score contribute strongly to the movie's incredibly rich atmosphere. Murder, adultery and class distinction are at the heart of the story and interestingly, no gloss is applied to the depiction of any of these subjects. Instead, the focus is on the powerful impact they all have on the various people involved.\n\nNewly promoted police detective Mike Keegan (Tom Berenger) is given responsibility for protecting a wealthy Manhattan socialite Claire Gregory (Mimi Rogers) whose life is in danger because she was the only person who witnessed the brutal murder of one of her close friends. The job involves Mike spending time in Claire's luxurious apartment and accompanying her to a variety of social events. He soon becomes attracted to Claire and her glamorous lifestyle; she appreciates the level of security his presence provides and soon the unlikely couple fall in love.\n\nMike's wife Ellie (Lorraine Bracco) becomes suspicious about the nature of his relationship with Claire and his tacit admission about their affair leads to the break up of his family. Mobster Joey Venza (Andreas Katsulas) who had attempted to kill Claire immediately after she witnessed him killing her friend, then takes Ellie and her son hostage and what follows leads to the threat on Claire's life being removed permanently.\n\nClaire's comfortable existence changed radically after she witnessed the murder as she became more fearful and had her life threatened by the psychotic killer. The level of freedom she'd previously enjoyed also became considerably more restricted and her affair with Mike led to her stuffy fianc√© being dumped and Mike's wife being emotionally devastated by what had happened.\n\nMike's first assignment as a detective led to his life being put in extreme danger and also to him experiencing a great deal of emotional turmoil over his relationship with Claire. The effect this had on his marriage (which had always previously been a happy one) was also painful and his conduct and handling of the case drew severe criticism from his superiors. Ultimately the intensity of Mike's anguish and Claire's desolation are both incredibly profound.\n\n\"Someone To Watch Over Me\" is a romantic thriller which is beautifully directed by Ridley Scott and features consistently good performances by its talented cast. Lorraine Bracco provides the stand out performance as Mike's feisty, down-to-earth wife whose instincts are totally reliable and Andreas Katsulas' physiognomy and bearing make him the perfect choice for the story's villain.\n\nThe concept in a story about two people from two different walks of life getting involved in a love affair that will consume them, is not exactly new in mainstream movies. If one adds to the concept two attractive players to impersonate those lovers on the screen, the result will play heavily in the way an audience responds. If then, a murder is thrown in, it adds another layer to the film.\n\nRidley Scott, is a director with a keen sense of style. He has produced a string of movies that have resonated with the movie going public, and \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", his 1987 film, proves to be one of those favorites, if one is to go by the comments submitted to this forum. The screen play is by Howard Franklin. The excellent cinematography by Steven Poster pays tribute to New York City with the breathtaking aerial night shots. Michael Kamen added to the texture of the film with his music score that also blends music by Antonio Vivaldi and Leo Delibes' \"Lakme\" into the sound track.\n\nAlthough the mere idea of a rich socialite getting involved with a Queens detective is preposterous at best, one goes along with the possibility. We realize from the start they have no future together because the detective is pure polyester and the rich girl will not ever set her foot in the outer boroughs for all the money in the world. We realize from the beginning these lovers are doomed.\n\nThe best thing in the film are the two leads, Mimi Rogers is an exciting presence in whatever she decides to appear in, as it's the case here. Tom Berenger, with his rough good looks is perfect for the awkward detective that can't resist a woman out of his league. Lorraine Bracco, who in this film bears an uncanny resemblance with Debra Winger, plays the wife of the detective, and is also a cop. Andreas Katsulas is at his best creepy self as the man who doesn't want to be identified and will do anything to get his accuser out of the picture.\n\nRidley Scott delivers with his usual elegance and eye for the luxury most of us mere mortals can't afford."
