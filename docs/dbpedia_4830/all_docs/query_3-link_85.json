        "text": "May 28, 2018\n\nAn Irishman, an Englishman and an American are chained to a wall of a cell in 1980s Lebanon. Frank McGuinness was inspired by Brian Keenan’s account of being kidnapped and held for four and a half years through the late 1980s – I don’t know Keenan’s book (An Evil Cradling), but I presume it was an inspiration for the play, not a source. Someone Who’ll Watch Over Me is not a political play, the events are not placed into any historical context. The kidnappers are never seen and we don’t know their motivations. However, politics must haunt the play and it’s open to wonder if we are shown First World victims of Third World brutality – I presume this was not McGuinness’s intention, but plays live their own lives. What we are shown, over nine scenes, are the three characters trying to come to terms with their captivity, struggling against fear, discomfort, boredom. Sometimes they resort to fantasy or fiction (e.g., the drinking scene), but there are signs of mental decay under the pressure. Edward, the Irishman, is the most dynamic of the characters, a cynical journalist, he seems to enjoy aggravating the others – it’s uncertain whether he does this through pique at the situation or whether he is trying to toughen the other’s up...or, at least, toughen up Michael, the Englishman, who arrives in the second scene baffled and disorientated. And by the end there is a certain reversal, Michael now seem tougher and able to face the situation with a greater strength. But I’m not sure what the play’s really doing – but maybe it’s a character study of characters caught in an extreme situation: maybe that’s all it needs to be doing. Humour is one of their tactics to face the situation...so, at times, it’s an amusing play. I’m not convinced it doesn’t make a horrendous experience somehow mundane.\n\nMarch 21, 2007\n\n\"Someone Who'll Watch Over Me\" is one of the best war plays ever written. This haunting, heartbreaking, and funny work tells the story of an American, an Englishman and an Irishman trapped in a Middle Eastern prison cell together. (Which totally sounds like the beginning of a racist joke.) This play is so beautiful and sad and the scene where the English guy and the Irish guy argue about what really caused the Famine is just hilarious. Everything about this play is brilliant.\n\nSeptember 11, 2007\n\nThe 2005 revival (with David Threlfall, Jonny Lee Miller, and Aiden Gillen) was by turns incredibly poignant, funny, and tragic - a good text made fantastic in production.\n\nApril 8, 2012\n\nI played Michael Watters in a charity production of Someone Who'll Watch Over Me in March 2012. In order to learn the lines I had to spend about three months reading this book every day. And I never got bored with it. Switching from absurd comedy to high drama in the space of a line, this is certainly the best play I have ever performed in. When we were selling tickets, the director would tell people it was the best play written in the last 25 years. Hyperbole, to be sure, but it has to be a contender.\n\nSeptember 2, 2010\n\nI attended the play in New York before I read it. It was powerful and poignant. I saw Stephen Rea, James McDaniel, and Alec McCowan. The production included a stark set, with part ofElla Fitzgerald's version of George and Ira Gershwin's \"Someone To Watch Over Me\" between scenes as the lights faded to a starlit \"sky.\"\n\nFebruary 27, 2020\n\nA devastating 3 hander! Three men in a cell in Beirut, trying to eep their sanity and their hope alive. Just reading this was heart wrenching, I can only imagine what it is like to sit through a production of it!\n\nJanuary 3, 2009\n\nA wonderful exploration of human nature. How do we deal with isolation and loneliness? With loss? Hoe big are our imagines?\n\nOctober 21, 2010\n\nWhat a challenge for three actors, but it would be so thrilling to make this play come alive.\n\nMarch 18, 2013\n\nMight be my favorite play of all time. If not, top five.\n\nJune 10, 2014\n\nOne of the all-time realistic, fantastic, sad, triumphant plays. Three characters you'll never forget in a situation you'll desperately wish you could.\n\nOctober 8, 2018\n\nA one-room play with three characters has got to be one of the toughest types of plays to write. On one hand, it simplifies the casting and the staging, but those aren't really the author's problem, anyway. This play is even tougher, because the characters are all chained to the wall. The \"action\" is therefore largely limited to what's going on intellectually and emotionally inside the characters' heads. I couldn't help but compare this play to Genet's DEATHWATCH and Sartre's NO EXIT. Unfortunately, I this play doesn't really measure up.\n\nJanuary 22, 2021\n\nThree white men from the Western World trying to save their sanity while chained in a cell in Lebanon as hostages of some Arab terrorist(?) group. It's funny, but not very funny and that's about it.\n\nFebruary 26, 2021\n\nSo well written. So hard to read knowing there are people in chains as I safely read. I read this years ago and will read this again in years to come.\n\nMay 2, 2009\n\ni guess it wasn't too bad, but it seemed that these 3 characters could have as easily be sitting in a bar talking instead of being chained to a wall in a windowless room somewhere in Lebanon."
