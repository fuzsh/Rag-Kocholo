        "text": "about the play\n\nIn Lebanon, an American, an Englishman and an Irishman are abruptly taken from their work, their lives and the ones they love. Chained in a dark, isolated room there seems no escape from the enemies that terrorize them. In an absence of time they each struggle to make sense of their circumstances while they seek freedom. How is the value of a human life measured? And will the answer be enough for someone to finally be set free?\n\nAfter more than a year of seeing scenes and giving feedback on scenes from this play in Collective Monday, the ensemble voted to produce this revival and put it out in the public. This production was the initial launch of the Collective’s No Empty Seats campaign to make professional theatre accessible. We are indebted to Mr. McGuinness for helping us make that possible. Someone who’ll watch over me provided 1,000 seats to those priced out of professional theatre. During the summer run of 2010 there wasn't single empty seat.\n\nThis production was nominated for four NY Innovative theater awards: Best Director (Grant), Best Actor (Kane), Best Costumes (Amigone), & Best Lighting Design (Fabozzi).\n\nARTISTS & CAST\n\nMedia & articles\n\nFeatured in\n\nTONIC —\"No Empty Seats\" Aims to Make Theater Accessible to All.
