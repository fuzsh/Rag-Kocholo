        "text": "While stylistic and nicely shot, it's nothing more than an average, dismissible thriller.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/10 | Dec 7, 2020\n\nMuch of its failure to convince emotionally as well as intellectually must be laid at the door of its director, Ridley Scott, who seems far happier making super-high-tech thrillers like Alien and Blade Runner.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Nov 5, 2019\n\nThe movie can only fully work if all sides of the love triangle are equally strong.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Mar 21, 2019\n\nWhere Someone to Watch Over Me falters is, oddly enough, in the central relationship.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Mar 11, 2019\n\nEven though the movie doesn't leave much of a residue, it looks terrific while you're watching it: Manhattan has seldom appeared as glitzy or as glamorous.\n\nFull Review | Jun 3, 2012\n\nIllogical, flawed or forced thrillers are all too common. Ones that knock your eyes out are rare.\n\nFull Review | Jun 3, 2012\n\nA guilty pleasure: Ridley Scott's fourth film is a minor work, a semi-effective combo of cop thriller and erotic noir melodrama, but it has nice visual style and the perfromances by Tom Berenger, Mimi Rogers and especially Lorraine Barcco are likable.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B- | Jul 27, 2008"
