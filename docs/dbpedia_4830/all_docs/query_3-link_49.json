        "text": "One night I was clearing the dishes and had a jazz station on. Ella Fitzgerald began to sing one of the loveliest ballads of all time, George Gershwin’s memorable “Someone to Watch Over Me.”\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the song, it was the one that the student was learning to sing in the Richard Dreyfuss film, “Mr. Holland’s Opus” from 1995. It’s not easy to sing, demanding tremendous range. But when it’s done right, it is melodic and lyrical.\n\nI reflected on how, as beautiful the lyrics may be, they would be considered incredibly sexist today. The song is sung from the point of view of a young woman, and it revolves around her need for a man:\n\nLooking everywhere,\n\nhaven't found him yet.\n\nHe's the big affair\n\nI cannot forget.\n\nOnly man I ever think of with regret.\n\nI’d like to add his initial to my monogram\n\nTell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?\n\nThere's a somebody I'm longing to see.\n\nI hope that he turns out to be\n\nsomeone who'll watch over me.\n\nI'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood\n\nI know I could be always be good\n\nTo one who'll watch over me\n\nAs it reminded me of the Dreyfuss film, I thought of a teacher of mine in college who made a lasting impact on me. Dr. Kathleen Barber taught in the Political Science department at John Carroll University and I took her Constitutional Law class.\n\nShe was good. How good? Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas was a friend of hers and occasional houseguest. That good.\n\nI remember one class vividly. This was the early ‘70s, and we were discussing the women’s movement. Roe v. Wade had just been decided. Dr. Barber stated that the issues around women’s rights would have the most profound impact on society for decades to come.\n\nJCU had, up until a few years earlier, been an all-male school so the class was mostly young men. They challenged Dr. Barber’s statement, some openly scoffing. I remember thinking, however, “Holy cow! She could be right.”\n\nAnd indeed she was. Today’s arguments about abortion rights, women’s reproductive health, equal pay, parental leave, sexual assault on campus, and a host of other issues are evidence of how fundamentally the struggle for equality between the sexes has impacted our society.\n\nThe patriarchy will not yield its power willingly, and so the fight continues and will go on for a long time to come. We cannot get discouraged by temporary setbacks or failures. As Dr. King and President Obama have used the metaphor of the arc of racial history bending toward justice, it applies to gender parity as well.\n\nDr. Barber passed away two years ago today. But her legacy lives on in the thousands of students she taught, as well as the environmental and cultural causes for which she fought.\n\nAs the song ended and my reverie was broken, the dishwasher loaded and the “Start” button pressed, I closed the door and it began to work. I turned out the lights and headed for bed."
