Director Ridley Scott was the subject of BBC arts programme Omnibus in 1992.

Titled Eye of the Storm, it was first shown on UK television around the release of 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992).

Although there is a certain irony that Scottâ€™s career suffered a dip soon after (until his renaissance with Gladiator in 2000), it is a solid profile filled with various collaborators, including David Carradine, Sigourney Weaver, Mimi Rogers, Michael Douglas and his two sons Jake and Luke.

Amongst the things discussed are:

His first short film Boy and Bicycle (1962)

BBC years

The Advertising Years (including the Michelob ads that Stanley Kubrick loved and the famous Hovis commercials)

The Duellists (1977)

Alien (1979)

Blade Runner (1982)

The Famous Apple Commercial (1983)

Someone to Watch Over Me (1987)

Black Rain (1989)

Thelma and Louise (1991)
