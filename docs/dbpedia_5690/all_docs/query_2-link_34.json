He played 19 seasons in Russia, with Avangard Omsk, Sibir Novosibirsk, Severstal Cherepovets, and Metallurg Novokuznetsk before being transferred to Lokomotiv Yaroslavl during the 2010-2011 season.

The team was traveling to Minsk to play their opening game of the season, with its coaching staff and prospects. Lokomotiv officials said \"'everyone from the main roster was on the plane plus four players from the youth team.'\"[2][3][4] He was buried in Omsk next to the grave of Alexei Cherepanov.[5]\n\nHonours[]\n\n2004\n\nRussian championship (with Avangard)\n\n2005\n\nEuropean Champions cup (with Avangard)\n\n2007\n\nTurnir Puchkova\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of ice hockey players who died during their playing career\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
