        "text": "Vancouver Canucks - Eddie Lack - Goalie, Nicklas Jensen - Right Winger\n\nThe Canucks are the first team to have two prospects share the number one ranking. Not too long ago Jensen was easily the number one prospect in Vancouver, but certain events, not all of them pertaining to the stellar play of Lack, have shot Lack up the rankings.\n\nOnce Cory Schneider took over the starting job from Roberto Luongo, things started looking brighter for Lack. It is almost inevitable that Luongo will be traded, leaving a gap at the back-up goaltender position. Enter Lack, a 6'4 native of Sweden who went from undrafted to star potential very quickly. As you can see in the above graphic, Lack had a great season with the Chicago Wolves in the AHL. He continued his great play from his rookie season with the Manitoba Moose, in which he had a 2.26 GAA and a .926 SV%. While the wins weren’t very high this season, his goals against average and save percentage were great.\n\nLack is in a very interesting position now. He becomes the back up goalie for one of the elite teams in the NHL, but he also has the chance to take over the starting job much faster than many back ups could. While Cory Schneider has been lights out in his limited time in the NHL, he still remains unproven over a whole season. If Schneider slips up at any point and Lack gets a good string of starts together, he could show the rest of the league the potential that he really has. It would be a great story if other great Swedish net minding prospects like Anders Lindback and Robin Lehner are outplayed by the undrafted Eddie Lack.\n\nWhen the Canucks stepped up to the podium with the 29th pick in the 2011 draft, they drafted the best player available. Fortunately for them that player was Nicklas Jensen. The Danish forward was coming off an impressive 58 point rookie season for the Oshawa Generals in the OHL. Although he was projected to be a late first round pick, the Canucks got a steal to pick him that late. Jensen has not dissapointed since being drafted. Though he did not stick with the Canucks, he did not look out of place during training camp.\n\nWhen the Canucks returned him to the Generals, he kept up his scoring pace, matching his point total from the previous season in less games. Perhaps more impressive is his late season AHL call-up, in which he scored 4 goals in 6 games with the Chicago Wolves. Unfortunately he suffered a concussion in the second game of the AHL playoffs after scoring two goals in the first game.\n\nJensen projects as a top-6 power forward winger with first line potential. He is the type of player the Canucks have been searching for. Vancouver has lacked an elite right winger for some time now, and they’re hoping Jensen can fill the void sooner rather than later. Though Jensen will probably spend one more season in the minors, he will most likely get a call up this season and remain in the NHL beyond that point.\n\nEvgeny Kuznetsov - Washington Capitals - RW\n\nIn my second installment of prospect evaluations I come across one of the more intriguing prospects in hockey. Kuznetsov is a dynamic talent with game breaking potential, but he has yet to play in North America and nobody knows when he will. The Caps picked him 26th overall in 2010 and believe me, if there wasn’t concern over whether this guy would play in the NHL or KHL, he would have gone much higher. Which brings me to my point. Kuznetsov is an elite player. He is already playing against men in the KHL and putting up great numbers. The only question is, when will he bring his talents to the NHL.\n\nThe “Russian Factor” is something that is always brought up at every draft regarding a top Russian prospect. The “factor” really means how committed they are to playing their entire career in the NHL. It’s a phenomenon that only happens with Russian born prospects and is a bit unfair in my opinion. Many people chastise these players for not committing to their team or only playing for money (because the KHL would offer most Russians much more money than an NHL team would), but the reality is these kids are doing what they think is best for them. Kids like Kuznetsov are in their homeland for a reason, they feel more comfortable there. I can’t even imagine the challenge that foreign prospects go through trying to acclimate to a new country while still being put under a microscope before their draft. It’s a heavy toll on them, but almost every European first rounder in the past few years has done very well in North America. Athough there are leagues out there like the KHL, every hockey players dream is to play in the NHL and win a Stanley Cup. You don;t see Swedish players bolting for the Superliiga, and there’s a reasopn for that. Kuznetsov is a player who would be integral in an NHL cup run. Just think about a line with Ovechkin - Backstrom - Kuznetsov. I don’t think a better line could be made in the NHL.\n\nWhile the Caps have some interesting prospects, especially since they drafted a great two way center in Filip Forsberg ( a steal at the 11th pick if you ask me, and by the way a better fit for the Caps than Grigorenko would have been) and power forward Tom Wilson ( the first Canadian forward drafted in 2012), Kuznetsov remains by far the best prospect the Washington Capitals have. With Kuznetsov and the recent prospects and draftees they’ve acquired, plus a promising Braden Holtby in net, I don’t think it’s out of line to say the Caps will be competing for the SE division, if not the Eastern Conference for quite some time\n\nOnce again, the only question is will Kuznetsov come to the NHL or will he stay with the KHL. No one should be expecting this kid to come here. He is having great success in the KHL and he is in his homeland. Coming to North America is a big change for him and no one can expect him to just come over and start tearing up the league. If and when he does come over, I expect a short adjustment period but I stand by the fact that he will be one of the more dynamic players in the NHL if he does come over.\n\nIf you don’t know much about him or if you don’t like him for some reason, here are his stats the last few years;\n\nKHL totals : GP:128 G:38 A:42 P:80 PIM:70\n\nKHL playoff totals: GP:16 G:8 A:2 P:10 PIM:10\n\nWJC totals: GP:33 G: 23 A:28 P:51 PIM:32\n\nHe’s that good.\n\nBreaking (sort of) News:\n\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets trade RW Rick Nash, D Steven Deslisle and a conditional 2013 third round pick to the New York Rangers for centers Brandon Dubinsky, Artem Anisimov, defenseman Tim Erixon and a 2013 first round pick. Columbus would keep their third round pick if the Rangers make it to the Stanley Cup Finals\n\nThis trade helps both teams immensely. The Rangers aquire a dynamic scorer to help their struggling offense. Look where they got to in the post season without Nash, plus the players they’re trading away did next to nothing for them in the playoffs, and the regular season. We finally get to see what Nash can do in a full season with an elite center on his line. When Gaborik comes back from injury, watch out for the Blueshirts\n\nColumbus gets just as much of a return, with two quality centers, and a very good prospect at defense. Dubinsky may have had a bad season, but he has shown that he can put up the points. Anisimov is a quality depth center with some scoring touch. That gives Columbus great depth down the middle now with Johansen, Dubinsky and Anisimov. Add Erixon to a good young defense, with Jack Johnson, Ryan Murray, Nikita Nikitin and John Moore, and you have a pretty strong looking Columbus team. CBJ fans just hope now that management doesn’t screw things up again. And that first round pick will be huge too. Even though the pick will most likely be 20th or later, the 2013 draft is incredibly deep.\n\nIt’s been a while since I did a prospect evaluation but the time seems right now. I’ll start with Winnipeg since last time around I didn’t make it to the later teams. From now on I will give at least one prospect update weekly until all the teams are done. With a new draft and some new kids on each team some of the top prospects could have changed from last year, so look out for some of these up and comer’s making a mark in your favorite organization.\n\nWPG- Mark Scheifele\n\nScheifele represents a bright future in Winnipeg. Before he was drafted, the Winnipeg/Atlanta prospect pool was very shallow, with only Evander Kane and Alex Burmistrov giving them much hope. Enter Scheifele, a 6'3 center who can put the puck in the net, has good size, and has the potential to be a first line center, something Winnipeg lacks. A high riser in his draft, Scheifele quieted critics with a great preseason, and though he did not stick with the team, he did not look out of place in his 7 regular season games. With a struggling Barrie Colts team, Mark still put up 23 goals and 40 assists for 63 points in only 47 games. He also potted 6 goals in 7 games for Canada in the World Juniors U18 tournament. This kid has the size, skill and compete level to be the missing piece in Winnipeg’s offensive attack. The WPG/ATL franchise has lacked that first line center for a long time. Scheifele can fill that void very soon and with a strong young core of players like Kane, Burmistrov, Little, Bogosian, Byfuglien, Pavelec and Enstrom, the future looks bright in Winnipeg. With other prospects such as Paul Postma, Patrice Cormier and recent draftee Jacob Trouba, Winnipegs blue line looks set and with another top six forward added, whether it be in this years draft or by trade/UFA signing, the Jets are on their way to being a perennial playoff team.\n\n*I will have better pictures soon, just got to get Photoshop going again. Better graphics to come.\n\nEdmonton Oilers\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins: Position: C Ht: 6'1 Wt: 175 Age: 18\n\nThe crown jewel of the 2011 NHL entry draft went to the Edmonton Oilers for the second time in two years. With the selection of Taylor Hall first overall in the previous draft, Edmonton added another future star in Ryan Nugent-Hopkins. There are some other good prospects in the Oilers system, including Jeff Petry, Linus Omark and fellow 2011 first round draft choice Oscar Klefbom, but the skill and potential that RNH possess are unrivaled. Nugent-Hopkins wasn’t the clear cut number one pick in the months preceding the draft. The likes of Adam Larsson, Gabriel Landeskog and Sean Couturier were all gunning for the prestige of the top selection, but RHN proved throughout the season that he was the most worthy to be the number one pick. In Nugent-Hopkins, the Oilers get a playmaking center with excellent hockey IQ to go with their already star-studded group of youngsters. RNH can prove to be one of the best additions to the Oilers line-up in a long time.\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins started impressing people early on in his hockey career. Playing for the Burnaby Winter Club Bruins, RNH potted 119 goals and notched 95 assists for a whopping 214 points in only 66 games. Those numbers along with his potential made him the 1st overall pick in the WHL Bantam draft by the Red Deer Rebels in 2008. In the 2009-2010 season, Nugent-Hopkins scored 24 goals and added 41 assists for just under a point per game with 65 points in 67 games. RNH was also named WHL rookie of the year, and narrowly lost out for CHL rookie of the year to Matt Puempel. Playing at only 17 years old most of the season, Nugent-Hopkins had a great season by totalling 31 goals and 75 assists for 106 points in 69 games, and though Red Deer had a short playoff run, he still tallied 9 points in just 7 games. Though RNH missed the cut for the World Juniors roster for Canada, he played in the CHL Subway Super Series, and the Home Hardware Prospect Game, earning player of the game in the latter. RNH also played in the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament and proved that he has big game ability too. He scored 5 goals and 2 assists in 5 games, and also scored the the game-winning goal in the Gold Medal game vs the U.S.\n\nThere is some debate over whether Nugent-Hopkins will play in the NHL this season. Some say he does not have NHL-ready size yet, but his numbers overshadow that factor. There have been many undersized prospect, like Jeff Skinner last season, who have impressed in their rookie season. If RNH returns to the WHL in 2011-2012, he will be the first draft pick since Erik Johnson in 2006 to not go straight to the NHL after being selected first overall. Nugent-Hopkins has the ability to play in the big leagues right now, but it is all up to the Oilers staff whether to let him develop more or start his career now. With names such as Taylor Hall, Jordan Eberle and Magnus Paajarvi on the Oilers roster, RNH could jump right in and fit in with those second year players, especially if he is playing on a line with one or two of them. Though some do not consider RNH an elite player, he wouldn’t have to be elite in his first year is he is centering the likes of Taylor Hall and Jordan Eberle. Anyone who is compared to Joe Sakic and Pavel Datsyuk, as RNH is, definately have a chance of being an elite player. Nugent-Hopkins possesses the amazing vision needed to be an all-star center, a great hockey IQ, and is also responsible in his defensive zone. With the cast of young talent that will be surrounding Nugent-Hopkins once he is in the NHL, there is a good chance he will be a Calder finalist and a 90 + point player down the road.\n\nDetroit Red Wings\n\nTomas Tatar: Position: C/LW Ht: 5'11 Wt: 176 Age: 20\n\nThis was one of the toughest picks yet. With a Detroit farm system that loves to develop prospects very slowly, you never know when you’ll see a full season out of any of their promising picks. Also following the Detroit drafting prowess, late pick Tomas Tatar (not that late, 60th overall in 2009) tops the Red Wings prospect system. Tatar is a gifted forward who can play center or wing. Hailing from Slovakia, Tatar shows the most promise out of a prospect pool that includes Brendan Smith, Teemu Pulkkinen and fellow countryman Tomas Jurco. The wings have always been known to find talent later in the draft, and Tatar is a perfect example. And with a mostly veteran Red Wings team, Tatar’s time to shine will come sooner rather than later.\n\nWhile somewhat undersized, Tatar makes up for his build with his scoring and playmaking ability. In his native country, Tatar put up tremendous numbers with Dukla Trencin U-18 in 2006-2007 with 33 goals and 44 assists in 48 games. The following season, he built on his goal scoring numbers by tallying 41 goals in just 42 games. After Tatar was drafted in 2009, he went straight to the AHL with the Grand Rapids Griffins, and did not look out of place. as an 18 year old rookie playing amongst full grown men and seasoned veterans, he registered 32 points in 58 games, with 16 goals and 16 assists. Once again Tatar would build on those totals with a great total of 24 goals and 33 assists in 70 games. Tatar also earned a 9 game call-up to the big leagues last season. Though he only totalled one goal, he showed promise and the flashes of brilliance that the Wings drafted him for.\n\nThe Red Wings have two elite forwards in Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg, plus some secondary scoring in Johan Franzen, Todd Bertuzzi and Valtteri Filppula. Though an injury call-up might be what Tatar needs to get back on the Wings NHL roster, a strong training camp and preseason showing can get him there as well, and there is a good chance of the latter. With his great puck-handling skills, good speed, and deadly shot, there is no reason Tatar shouldn’t be a top six forward within the next year or two. Veteran presence on the Wings will help develop and guide Tatar to reaching his full potential. In the end, Tatar’s hard work ethic will help him become one of the next European Red Wings superstars, and we know how well the Wings do in that category.\n\nDallas Stars\n\nJack Campbell: Position: G Ht: 6'3 Wt: 175 Age: 19\n\nThe first goaltender on this list headlines the Dallas Stars as top prospect. While it was a bit of a tough decision, Jack Campbell is ultimately the Stars top prospect, and future of the organization. Other up and comers, including Scott Glennie, Philip Larsen and 2011 first round pick Jamie Oleksiak have good potential, but Campbell has more upside than the other prospects and can contribute more once he makes the team. Dallas has needed a franchise goalie since Marty Turco started running out of gas, and Campbell will be that goalie. Kari Lehtonen is too injury prone, and though he does put up decent numbers, he is not the top notch goalie that the Stars need.\n\nCampbell, who was born in Michigan, came up playing in the US NTDP and impressed at every level. For the under 18 squad, Campbell posted a terriffc 1.71 GAA and a .950 SV% in 7 games, winning every one of them. The next season in the USHL, he posted a 2.21 GAA, a .917 SV% and a 6-3-1 record. But perhaps his best attributes is his play during high pressure situations. In three World Juniors tournaments while representing the U.S, Campbell has an amazing combined record of 13-3, posting goals against averages of 0.75, 0.83 and 1.70. respectively. He won gold with the U.S. in the first two Under 18 WJC tournaments, and bronze in the Under 20 WJC tournament, while also earning the MVP award and best goaltender award.\n\nCampbell struggled in his first OHL season with the Windsor Spitfires. his statistics were less than stellar, but once the playoffs came around, Campbell turned it up again. Though the Spifires were eventually eliminated, Campbell proved that he has the tools to become an elite goalie in the NHL. Campbell has great glove, blocker puck-handling and passing skills, but perhaps his best skill is his compete level. He never gives up on a play and is always striving to be the best he can. Traits like those are what separate the “almost” all-stars from the perennial all-stars. Young goaltenders usually stay in the CHL or AHL for a few years before they get the chance to play in the NHL, and the Stars will follow that trend with Campbell. There is no reason to rush a young goaltender into a stressful situation when he isn’t physically or mentally ready yet. While it is so hard to predict goal-tending talent nowadays, Campbell will be a top goaltender soon enough. It might be a couple of years before we see even one start from him, but he will shine once he has the chance to on the NHL stage."
