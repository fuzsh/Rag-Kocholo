If no volume is indicated at the end of an entry here, it means the article appears in alphabetical order in volumes one through 46. In volume 46, MERSH begins the alphabetical listing anew. Those entries appear in this list with volume indicated at end of the line. Two supplementary volumes have also been indexed, and they are interfiled here in alphabetical order with all other entries but flagged with appropriate volume = e.g., v1(supplement)"
