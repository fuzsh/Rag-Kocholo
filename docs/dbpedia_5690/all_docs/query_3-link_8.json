        "text": "Full name: Semyon Aleksandrovich Varlamov\n\nTeam: Colorado Avalanche\n\nNumber: 1\n\nPosition: Goaltender\n\nHeight: 6’2”/189 cm\n\nWeight: 209 lbs/95 kg\n\nCatches: Left\n\nBorn: April 27, 1988 in Samara, RUS\n\nDrafted: Selected by the Washington Capitals in the 1st round (23rd overall) of the 2006 Entry Draft\n\nStrengths: Varlamov is a prototypical butterfly-style goaltender with excellent reflexes, flexibility, and size. Varlamov has a very good save percentage early into his NHL career and is developing into a long-term no. 1 goaltender.\n\nWeaknesses: Injuries and inconsistency had prevented Varlamov from playing a full NHL season until his fourth season. Varlamov’s puckhandling skills are his main weakness.\n\nBiography: Semyon Varlamov was born in Samara (then still known as Kuybyshev) – an industrial city on the Volga. After moving to Yaroslavl, a city further up the Volga, Varlamov developed into the best goalie prospect in his age group with the Lokomotiv hockey organization. Playing his way through the farm league, Varlamov debuted in the Superleague at the age of 18 and quickly became Lokomotiv’s number one goaltender. In 2007, Varlamov was Russia’s goaltender at the World Junior Championship and helped the team to a silver medal finish. Even before then, he was already drafted by the Washington Capitals and had good NHL potential. After two successful seasons in the Superleague, Semyon came to North America to play for Washington’s farm club. Throughout the regular season of 2008-09, he was called up to the big club a few times and proved to be effective, winning 4 of 6 games. The average play of Capitals starting goalie Jose Theodore prompted the club to entrust Varlamov with the goaltending duties for the playoffs. Varlamov was excellent, registering two shutouts in the first round against the Rangers. The Capitals were ultimately eliminated by the Penguins in game 7 of the second round, but Varlamov had left his mark as the team’s prospective no. 1 starter. Semyon continued collecting victories in the next season, but an injury two months in forced him to undergo a conditioning stint with the farm club. Varlamov regained his position towards the end of the season, but the Capitals only lasted one playoff round. In 2010, Varlamov was named to Russia’s Olympic team, but did not see any ice time. Semyon’s chance to shine for the national team came at the 2010 World Championship, where he went undefeated until Russia’s tight loss to the Czechs in the final. Semyon spent his third NHL season mostly as the backup to fellow young goalie Michal Neuvirth. However, Varlamov was selected to start in the 2011 Winter Classic outdoor game against the Penguins. In Washington, Varlamov was one of three Russians, along with Alexander Ovechkin and Alexander Semin, to have a strong fan following. He even starred in a humorous ad with Ovechkin. In the 2011 off-season, the Capitals decided to go in a different direction with their goaltending and traded Varlamov to the Colorado Avalanche. In Colorado, Varlamov is starting in a lot more games than he did in Washington, but also has a more fragile and younger team in front of him. In 2012, Varlamov once again was the main goaltender for Russia at the World Championship. This time, Varlamov won all 8 games that he started, including the gold-medal final. For the duration of the 2012-13 NHL lockout, Varlamov returned to play for the club that developed him, Lokomotiv, and put up outstanding numbers.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team\n\nGP\n\nW\n\nL\n\nT\n\nOL\n\nGAA\n\nSave %\n\nSO\n\n2004-05 Lokomotiv-2 Yaroslavl (RHL-3)\n\n8\n\n2.43\n\n1\n\n2005-06 Lokomotiv-2 Yaroslavl (RHL-3)\n\n33\n\n2.02\n\n8\n\n2006-07 Lokomotiv-2 Yaroslavl (RHL-3)\n\n2\n\n1.50\n\n0\n\n2006-07 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl\n\n33\n\n2.17\n\n3\n\n2007-08 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl\n\n44\n\n2.45\n\n3\n\n2008-09 Hershey (AHL)\n\n27\n\n19\n\n7\n\n1\n\n2.40\n\n92.0\n\n2\n\n2008-09 Washington\n\n6\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2.37\n\n91.8\n\n0\n\n2009-10 Hershey (AHL)\n\n3\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.95\n\n93.3\n\n0\n\n2009-10 Washington\n\n26\n\n15\n\n4\n\n6\n\n2.55\n\n90.9\n\n2\n\n2010-11 Hershey (AHL)\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3.36\n\n85.5\n\n0\n\n2010-11 Washington\n\n27\n\n11\n\n9\n\n5\n\n2.23\n\n92.4\n\n2\n\n2011-12 Colorado\n\n53\n\n26\n\n24\n\n3\n\n2.59\n\n91.3\n\n4\n\n2012-13 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl\n\n16\n\n8\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1.74\n\n94.6\n\n3\n\n2012-13 Colorado\n\n35\n\n11\n\n21\n\n3\n\n3.02\n\n90.3\n\n3\n\nTotals RHL/KHL Reg.

He rarely gives up fighting for the puck, fits in well on any line he is assigned to, and is reliable in any situation in the game.\n\nWeaknesses: While Kulemin has proved that he is a 30-goal scorer, he sometimes falls into long dry spells throughout the season. He doesn’t seem to take as many shots on net as he is capable of.\n\nBiography: Like his friend and fellow NHL star Evgeni Malkin, Nikolai Kulemin was born and raised in the steelmaking city of Magnitogorsk in the southern Ural Mountains. As a teenager, Kulemin developed with the local Metallurg hockey school and made it to the professional league at the age of 17. In 2004, Kulemin was a member of Russia’s team that won gold at the under-18 championship. In his third professional season, Kulemin was transferred to Magnitogorsk’s main club, which played in the Russian Superleague. The 2006-07 season was a breakthrough year for Nikolai. Not only did his Metallurg win the Superleague championship, but he was also named the league MVP after tallying 27 goals in 54 games. After one more productive season in Russia, Kulemin moved on to play in the NHL for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the team that had drafted him in 2006. Nikolai became one of the few players in Leafs history to score in his first NHL game – it was the gamewinning goal against the Detroit Red Wings. Nikolai’s adjustment to North American hockey and life was eased by the presence of three other Russian speakers on the Maple Leafs – Nikolai Antropov, Alexei Ponikarovsky, and Mikhail Grabovski. Towards the end of the 2009-10 season, Kulemin was promoted to his team’s first line with sniper Phil Kessel and centre Tyler Bozak. In 2010-11, Kulemin emerged as the Leafs’ hardest working player and one of the league’s best two-way forwards. His line with Grabovski and Clarke MacArthur was the team’s most consistent and also arguably the NHL’s most productive second line. Nikolai also broke the 30-goal mark for the first time in his career. In just his fourth NHL season, Nikolai is already the longest-tenured player in Toronto. Kulemin has also played for Russia in five world championship tournaments and has won silver and bronze medals, as well as the gold medal in 2012. During the 2012-13 NHL lockout, Nikolai returned to his hometown to play for Metallurg. Playing on a line with Evgeni Malkin and Sergei Mozyakin, Kulemin scored at more than a point-per-game rate.

He is a feisty player and is hard to contain for the opposing defensemen.\n\nWeaknesses: The consequence of being such an explosive player is that Radulov is prone to overplaying the puck, leading to turnovers. His spirited style at times leads to undisciplined plays and costly penalties.\n\nBiography: Alexander was born and raised in the northern Urals city of Nizhniy Tagil, in the Sverdlovsk region. When he was still a child, he moved with his brother Igor (also a future NHL player) to Yaroslavl to study at a sports school. Radulov began his professional hockey career at the age of seventeen with THK Tver in the Russian Hockey League’s second tier (the Major League) and was one of the leading scorers at the Under-18 World Championships, where Russia won gold. By the end of his first season, Radulov got to play in one game for Dynamo Moscow in the Superleague. In 2004, Radulov was drafted by both the NHL (the Nashville Predators) and by Canada’s Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (the Quebec Remparts). In his two years with the Remparts, Alexander made a strong impression. Following his first year in North America, he was selected to the QMJHL’s All-Rookie Team. In 2006, Radulov was a First-Team All-Star, the MVP, and the leading scorer among all Canadian major junior leagues. He broke various club records, including most goals in a game twice (seven) and established a 50-game point streak that was second only to Mario Lemieux’s in the league’s history! Radulov’s experience in Quebec was capped off with his team becoming the Canadian Hockey League champions (and Radulov being awarded the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the MVP of the Memorial Cup playoffs). Alexander began the next season with the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League, but less than two months later gained a permanent roster spot with the Nashville Predators. Radulov brought over his flair and eccentric goal celebrations over to the NHL, where he became the most popular player in Nashville. He played in the NHL YoungStars Game in 2007 and finished his rookie season with an impressive plus-minus rating. After his breakthrough second year, in which he scored 26 goals, Radulov signed a three-year contract with Salavat Yulaev Ufa in Russia’s KHL. This was seen as a breach of his NHL contract that had one remaining year, and Alexander was suspended by the Predators for the entire 2008-09 season once he played a game for Ufa. On Salavat Yulaev, Alexander quickly found chemistry with almost any players assigned to his line, including Sergei Zinoviev, Igor Grigorenko, and Patrick Thoresen. In each subsequent season in the KHL, Radulov increased his production. In 2010, he managed to score the quickest goal in Russian hockey history – just seven seconds into a game. At the end of the 2009-10 season, Radulov was awarded the “Golden Stick” award as the KHL’s most valuable player. After two years of playoff disappointment, Radulov’s team made it to the KHL playoff final and won the Gagarin Cup in 2011. Alexander was one of coach Vyacheslav Bykov’s most trusted players, as they’ve won together not just the Gagarin Cup, but also one bronze and two gold medals with the national team at the World Championships. Radulov scored the game-winning goal of the 2009 World Championship gold medal final. After Salavat Yulaev was eliminated in the first round of the 2012 KHL playoffs, Radulov went back to the Predators to fulfill the remainder of this NHL contract. Afterwards, Radulov signed a four-year contract with CSKA Moscow.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 2003-04 THK Tver (RHL-2) 42 15 16 31 102 2003-04 Dynamo Moscow 1 0 0 0 2 2004-05 Quebec (QMJHL) 65 32 43 75 +30 64 2005-06 Quebec (QMJHL) 62 61 91 152 +53 101 2006-07 Milwaukee (AHL) 11 6 12 18 +3 26 2006-07 Nashville 64 18 19 37 +19 26 2007-08 Nashville 81 26 32 58 +7 44 2008-09 Salavat Yulaev Ufa 52 22 26 48 +26 92 2009-10 Salavat Yulaev Ufa 54 24 39 63 +44 62 2010-11 Salavat Yulaev Ufa 54 20 60 80 +27 83 2011-12 Salavat Yulaev Ufa 50 25 38 63 +1 64 2011-12 Nashville 9 3 4 7 +3 4 2012-13 CSKA Moscow 48 22 46 68 +12 86 Totals RSL/KHL Reg.

He had great mobility on the ice and usually played against the opposing teams’ top lines. Zhitnik was also a good playmaker and point man on the powerplay.\n\nWeaknesses: Zhitnik’s speed, physical play and defensive reliability had been declining in his last few seasons. When attacking, he was prone to making risky plays leading to turnovers.\n\nBiography: Born in Kiev, Zhitnik developed into a hockey player with the Sokol sports club. At age 18, he drew attention from the NHL due to his speed and strength (Zhitnik was nicknamed “elephant” because of his powerful legs) and was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings. Like the majority of especially talented and promising young hockey players in the Soviet Union, Alexei was transferred to the Central Red Army team in Moscow. He played well enough to play not only at the 1992 World Junior Championship, but also at the Olympics in the same year. At both tournaments, Russia (or CIS, as it was known then) won gold. In the summer of that year, Zhitnik made the shocking transition from Russian life, where foreign jeans were a luxury, to sunny southern California. In his first season in the NHL, Alexei’s team (led by superstar Wayne Gretzky) made it all the way to the Stanley Cup final, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens. After another season and a half in L.A., Zhitnik was traded to the Sabres. He continued to be involved with the national team, being called to represent Russia at the 1996 World Championship (where he was named the tournament’s best defenceman), the 1996 World Cup, and the 1998 Olympics (where Russia won silver). In Buffalo, Zhitnik was one the pillars of the Sabres’ rise in the late 1990s. Alexei once again came short of being a Stanley Cup champion when the Sabres lost to the Dallas Stars in the 1999 playoff finals. In 1999 and 2002, he was invited to play at the NHL All-Star Game. Zhitnik joined fellow stars Ilya Kovalchuk, Alexei Kovalev and Nikolai Khabibulin in playing for Ak Bars Kazan during the 2004-05 NHL lockout. He did not return to the Sabres when the NHL resumed, signing instead with the New York Islanders. Although he was still a reliable minute-eating defenceman, Zhitnik was traded twice in the 2006-07 season, moving from the Islanders to the Flyers to the Thrashers. In 2007, when he was a Flyer, Zhitnik became the first Soviet-born defenseman to play 1000 games in the NHL. In 2008, Atlanta bought out the remaining year of his contract and Alexei returned to Russia to play for Moscow Dynamo. That year, Zhitnik played for the national team for the first time in eight years, captaining Russia at the Karjala Cup tournament of the Euro Hockey Tour. He was named captain of Dynamo for the 2009-10 season. This was Zhitnik’s last season of playing hockey.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 1989-90 Sokol Kiev 31 3 4 7 16 1990-91 Sokol Kiev 46 1 4 5 46 1991-92 CSKA Moscow 44 2 7 9 52 1992-93 Los Angeles 78 12 36 48 -3 80 1993-94 Los Angeles 81 12 40 52 -11 101 1994-95 Los Angeles/Buffalo 32 4 10 14 -6 61 1995-96 Buffalo 80 6 30 36 -25 58 1996-97 Buffalo 80 7 28 35 +10 95 1997-98 Buffalo 78 15 30 45 +19 102 1998-99 Buffalo 81 7 26 33 -6 96 1999-00 Buffalo 74 2 11 13 -6 95 2000-01 Buffalo 78 8 29 37 -3 75 2001-02 Buffalo 82 1 33 34 -1 80 2002-03 Buffalo 70 3 18 21 -5 85 2003-04 Buffalo 68 4 24 28 -13 102 2004-05 Ak Bars Kazan 23 1 8 9 30 2005-06 N.Y.
