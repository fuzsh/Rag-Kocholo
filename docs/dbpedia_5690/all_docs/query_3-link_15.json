        "text": "Host Cities: Bratislava and Kosice, Slovakia\n\nApril 29 – May 15, 2011\n\nRESULT: 4th PLACE\n\nThis tournament brought Russia’s four-year medal streak at the World Hockey Championships to an end. Russia entered the tournament with a weaker group of players than in 2010, but still brought plenty of familiar faces, with only two players (Vladimir Tarasenko and Nikolai Belov) making their WC debut. Plenty of weaknesses became apparent as Russia struggled right from the opening game, getting shut-out by Germany, and in subsequent tight victories against lesser hockey powers like Slovenia and Denmark. The coaching staff entrusted Evgeni Nabokov to be the starting goaltender. Having sat out most of the season, Nabokov was not in ideal shape and suffered a leg injury in the fourth game, forcing Konstantin Barulin of KHL’s Atlant to handle the remaining games. Russia was also set back by an underwhelming group of centres, a struggling powerplay, undisciplined play from Alexei Emelin and Evgeni Artyukhin, and a faulty defense. Alexander Ovechkin was parachuted in to boost the offense, but he did not register a single point. After losing its remaining round-robin games to the Czech Republic and Finland, Russia faced off against the young and talented Canadian team in the quarterfinals. As usual, this matchup provided for the most entertaining hockey of the tournament, with Canada leading 1-0 midway through the third period. Alexei Kaigorodov then deked through the Canadian defence and scored a beautiful shorthanded goal to tie the game. A few minutes later, Ilya Kovalchuk sniped in the game-winner from Alexander Radulov’s pass. This tandem was Russia’s main highlight in the tournament. By defeating Canada in the quarters for the second straight year, Russia did not have enough energy and willpower to maintain such tempo for the rest of the tournament and went on to lose in the semifinal to Finland and in the bronze-medal game to the Czechs (this turn of events resembled the 2006 Olympics for Russia). What is especially concerning is that Russia lost five games out of nine. While Vyacheslav Bykov’s record as Russia’s coach is still an impressive 40 wins to 9 losses, a fourth place finish is clearly a disappointment.\n\nGame 1: Germany 2 – Russia 0\n\nGoals: Greilinger (Braun), Reimer\n\nShots: Germany 27 – Russia 31\n\nSaves: Endras 31 – Nabokov 25\n\nPIM: Germany 6 – Russia 4\n\nGame 2: Russia 6 – Slovenia 4\n\nGoals: Atyushov (Kovalchuk, Radulov), Afinogenov (Korneev), Kulikov (Kaigorodov), Artyukhin (Afinogenov, Kaigorodov), Radulov (Kovalchuk, Gorovikov), Zinoviev (Zaripov) – Hebar (Gregorc), Golicic (Sivic, M.

He is a feisty player and is hard to contain for the opposing defensemen.\n\nWeaknesses: The consequence of being such an explosive player is that Radulov is prone to overplaying the puck, leading to turnovers. His spirited style at times leads to undisciplined plays and costly penalties.\n\nBiography: Alexander was born and raised in the northern Urals city of Nizhniy Tagil, in the Sverdlovsk region. When he was still a child, he moved with his brother Igor (also a future NHL player) to Yaroslavl to study at a sports school. Radulov began his professional hockey career at the age of seventeen with THK Tver in the Russian Hockey League’s second tier (the Major League) and was one of the leading scorers at the Under-18 World Championships, where Russia won gold. By the end of his first season, Radulov got to play in one game for Dynamo Moscow in the Superleague. In 2004, Radulov was drafted by both the NHL (the Nashville Predators) and by Canada’s Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (the Quebec Remparts). In his two years with the Remparts, Alexander made a strong impression. Following his first year in North America, he was selected to the QMJHL’s All-Rookie Team. In 2006, Radulov was a First-Team All-Star, the MVP, and the leading scorer among all Canadian major junior leagues. He broke various club records, including most goals in a game twice (seven) and established a 50-game point streak that was second only to Mario Lemieux’s in the league’s history! Radulov’s experience in Quebec was capped off with his team becoming the Canadian Hockey League champions (and Radulov being awarded the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the MVP of the Memorial Cup playoffs). Alexander began the next season with the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League, but less than two months later gained a permanent roster spot with the Nashville Predators. Radulov brought over his flair and eccentric goal celebrations over to the NHL, where he became the most popular player in Nashville. He played in the NHL YoungStars Game in 2007 and finished his rookie season with an impressive plus-minus rating. After his breakthrough second year, in which he scored 26 goals, Radulov signed a three-year contract with Salavat Yulaev Ufa in Russia’s KHL. This was seen as a breach of his NHL contract that had one remaining year, and Alexander was suspended by the Predators for the entire 2008-09 season once he played a game for Ufa. On Salavat Yulaev, Alexander quickly found chemistry with almost any players assigned to his line, including Sergei Zinoviev, Igor Grigorenko, and Patrick Thoresen. In each subsequent season in the KHL, Radulov increased his production. In 2010, he managed to score the quickest goal in Russian hockey history – just seven seconds into a game. At the end of the 2009-10 season, Radulov was awarded the “Golden Stick” award as the KHL’s most valuable player. After two years of playoff disappointment, Radulov’s team made it to the KHL playoff final and won the Gagarin Cup in 2011. Alexander was one of coach Vyacheslav Bykov’s most trusted players, as they’ve won together not just the Gagarin Cup, but also one bronze and two gold medals with the national team at the World Championships. Radulov scored the game-winning goal of the 2009 World Championship gold medal final. After Salavat Yulaev was eliminated in the first round of the 2012 KHL playoffs, Radulov went back to the Predators to fulfill the remainder of this NHL contract. Afterwards, Radulov signed a four-year contract with CSKA Moscow.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 2003-04 THK Tver (RHL-2) 42 15 16 31 102 2003-04 Dynamo Moscow 1 0 0 0 2 2004-05 Quebec (QMJHL) 65 32 43 75 +30 64 2005-06 Quebec (QMJHL) 62 61 91 152 +53 101 2006-07 Milwaukee (AHL) 11 6 12 18 +3 26 2006-07 Nashville 64 18 19 37 +19 26 2007-08 Nashville 81 26 32 58 +7 44 2008-09 Salavat Yulaev Ufa 52 22 26 48 +26 92 2009-10 Salavat Yulaev Ufa 54 24 39 63 +44 62 2010-11 Salavat Yulaev Ufa 54 20 60 80 +27 83 2011-12 Salavat Yulaev Ufa 50 25 38 63 +1 64 2011-12 Nashville 9 3 4 7 +3 4 2012-13 CSKA Moscow 48 22 46 68 +12 86 Totals RSL/KHL Reg.

He had great mobility on the ice and usually played against the opposing teams’ top lines. Zhitnik was also a good playmaker and point man on the powerplay.\n\nWeaknesses: Zhitnik’s speed, physical play and defensive reliability had been declining in his last few seasons. When attacking, he was prone to making risky plays leading to turnovers.\n\nBiography: Born in Kiev, Zhitnik developed into a hockey player with the Sokol sports club. At age 18, he drew attention from the NHL due to his speed and strength (Zhitnik was nicknamed “elephant” because of his powerful legs) and was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings. Like the majority of especially talented and promising young hockey players in the Soviet Union, Alexei was transferred to the Central Red Army team in Moscow. He played well enough to play not only at the 1992 World Junior Championship, but also at the Olympics in the same year. At both tournaments, Russia (or CIS, as it was known then) won gold. In the summer of that year, Zhitnik made the shocking transition from Russian life, where foreign jeans were a luxury, to sunny southern California. In his first season in the NHL, Alexei’s team (led by superstar Wayne Gretzky) made it all the way to the Stanley Cup final, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens. After another season and a half in L.A., Zhitnik was traded to the Sabres. He continued to be involved with the national team, being called to represent Russia at the 1996 World Championship (where he was named the tournament’s best defenceman), the 1996 World Cup, and the 1998 Olympics (where Russia won silver). In Buffalo, Zhitnik was one the pillars of the Sabres’ rise in the late 1990s. Alexei once again came short of being a Stanley Cup champion when the Sabres lost to the Dallas Stars in the 1999 playoff finals. In 1999 and 2002, he was invited to play at the NHL All-Star Game. Zhitnik joined fellow stars Ilya Kovalchuk, Alexei Kovalev and Nikolai Khabibulin in playing for Ak Bars Kazan during the 2004-05 NHL lockout. He did not return to the Sabres when the NHL resumed, signing instead with the New York Islanders. Although he was still a reliable minute-eating defenceman, Zhitnik was traded twice in the 2006-07 season, moving from the Islanders to the Flyers to the Thrashers. In 2007, when he was a Flyer, Zhitnik became the first Soviet-born defenseman to play 1000 games in the NHL. In 2008, Atlanta bought out the remaining year of his contract and Alexei returned to Russia to play for Moscow Dynamo. That year, Zhitnik played for the national team for the first time in eight years, captaining Russia at the Karjala Cup tournament of the Euro Hockey Tour. He was named captain of Dynamo for the 2009-10 season. This was Zhitnik’s last season of playing hockey.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 1989-90 Sokol Kiev 31 3 4 7 16 1990-91 Sokol Kiev 46 1 4 5 46 1991-92 CSKA Moscow 44 2 7 9 52 1992-93 Los Angeles 78 12 36 48 -3 80 1993-94 Los Angeles 81 12 40 52 -11 101 1994-95 Los Angeles/Buffalo 32 4 10 14 -6 61 1995-96 Buffalo 80 6 30 36 -25 58 1996-97 Buffalo 80 7 28 35 +10 95 1997-98 Buffalo 78 15 30 45 +19 102 1998-99 Buffalo 81 7 26 33 -6 96 1999-00 Buffalo 74 2 11 13 -6 95 2000-01 Buffalo 78 8 29 37 -3 75 2001-02 Buffalo 82 1 33 34 -1 80 2002-03 Buffalo 70 3 18 21 -5 85 2003-04 Buffalo 68 4 24 28 -13 102 2004-05 Ak Bars Kazan 23 1 8 9 30 2005-06 N.Y.

Other than being dangerous on offense, he has also become more reliable in defensive and penalty-killing situations.\n\nWeaknesses: Afinogenov’s unpredictable and explosive style of play makes him prone to losing control of the puck. He shies away from tough physical play, but occasionally takes undisciplined penalties. In recent seasons, Afinogenov has missed more games due to injury and his ice-time has decreased.\n\nBiography: Afinogenov comes from a sporting family, as his mother was a track and field athlete. He was drawn to hockey at very young age and was already on a team when he was seven. Despite being a good student at school, Maxim frequently got into trouble. His devotion to hockey paid off in his teen years, making it to the junior squad of the prestigious Dynamo Moscow. When he was sixteen, he even got to play in one game for the main team! In that same season, he began to regularly represent Russia at international tournaments. Afinogenov was Russia’s top scorer at the 1999 World Junior Championship held in Canada, winning the Best Forward award and helping lead Russia to its first World Junior gold medal finish in the post-Soviet era. In his final season with Dynamo before leaving to North America, Maxim’s team made it to the final of the Superleague playoffs, but ultimately lost. Following a stint in the American Hockey League, Afinogenov secured a spot on the Buffalo Sabres and instantly became one of the team’s most skilled players. Despite his talents, “Mad Max” did not fit in with ease in coach Lindy Ruff’s notorious defensive system. The most memorable goal scored by Afinogenov came in the quarterfinal match against Czech Republic at the 2002 Olympics, when Max scored Russia’s only goal against former Buffalo teammate Dominik Hasek. Back in the NHL, he suffered a concussion during team training camp and had to miss most of the 2002-03 season. In December 2003, “Mad Max” registered his first NHL hattrick. During the NHL lockout of 2004-05, Afinogenov returned to Dynamo and this time the team succeeded in winning the Russian Superleague championship. Returning to the NHL, Maxim led the Sabres in scoring in 2006 and continued to produce at a greater than point-per-game pace before wrist and groin injuries shortened his season in 2007. Towards the end of the 2008-09 season, he was a healthy scratch, signalling the end of his playing career in Buffalo. For the following season, Afinogenov practiced with the Atlanta Thrashers on a try-out basis, secured a spot playing alongside Ilya Kovalchuk and Nikolai Antropov and would go on to top 60 points. In 2010, he returned to Russia and signed a five-year contract with SKA St. Petersburg.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 1995-96 Dynamo Moscow 1 0 0 0 0 1996-97 Dynamo Moscow 29 6 5 11 10 1997-98 Dynamo Moscow 35 10 5 15 53 1998-99 Dynamo Moscow 38 8 13 21 24 1999-00 Rochester (AHL) 15 6 12 18 +5 8 1999-00 Buffalo 65 16 18 34 -4 41 2000-01 Buffalo 78 14 22 36 +1 40 2001-02 Buffalo 81 21 19 40 -9 69 2002-03 Buffalo 35 5 6 11 -12 21 2003-04 Buffalo 73 17 14 31 -4 57 2004-05 Dynamo Moscow 36 13 14 27 91 2005-06 Buffalo 77 22 51 73 +6 84 2006-07 Buffalo 56 23 38 61 +19 66 2007-08 Buffalo 56 10 18 28 -16 42 2008-09 Buffalo 48 6 14 20 -7 20 2009-10 Atlanta 82 24 37 61 -17 46 2010-11 SKA St. Petersburg 51 13 20 33 +8 50 2011-12 SKA St. Petersburg 23 4 8 12 +4 36 2012-13 SKA St. Petersburg 26 4 4 8 -3 4 Totals RHL/KHL Reg.
