Dell's Microsoft Office 365 goes worldwide

Looking to expand Microsoft Office 365 internationally, Dell reached out to EMM to create Solution Sheets and Sales Battlecards in a variety of languages, including French, German, UK English, Japanese, and Portuguese.

Understanding their needs:

Dell, a leading, global, end-to-end computing solutions company, was one of the first companies to offer Microsoft Office 365, launching the solution with great success. Looking to expand their offering internationally, Dell reached out to EMM to create Solution Sheets and Sales Battlecards in a variety of languages, including French, German, UK English, Japanese, and Portuguese.

How we helped:

Dell has been working with EMM since launching Microsoft Office 365 several years ago. EMM created the initial launch tools, including sales, training, and internal launch materials, along with a web tool with step-by-step instructions on how to activate Office 365 accounts. With the growth of Microsoft Office 365, EMM and Dell have continued their working relationship, revising materials to incorporate additional services and new features.

Dell extended their Microsoft Office 365 offerings internationally and quickly realized the need for localized sales materials. Once again, they engaged EMM, this time to create Solution Sheets and Battlecards in a variety of languages, so their sales teams had the material they needed to be successful. EMM created localized Solution Sheets and Battlecards in French, German, UK English, Japanese, and Portuguese.

In addition to creating the new sales materials, EMM provided the Solution Sheets and Battlecards in an easily editable format, so changes could be made as needed and promotional offerings could be added on the fly.
