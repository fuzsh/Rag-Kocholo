        "text": "No organization starts out as an enterprise-sized business. From Uber to Nike, and even Dell Technologies itself, we all have proud legacies of small and lean teams taking big risks and driving big results. With the Dell APEX portfolio of multicloud and as-a-Service solutions now entering its third year, we want to ensure all organizations, no matter their size, know how they can benefit from the as-a-Service approach Dell APEX brings to technology to help all organizations unleash their innovation.\n\nTo do so, we worked with Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) to provide third-party validation of this reality. Through interviews with multiple customers, ranging from small startups to global enterprises, ESG analysts have shared a proof that explains which three of our Dell APEX offers are a fit for your business, no matter your size.\n\nLet’s dive into each of these three offers and explore how real customers, like you, have benefited from them.\n\nAs-a-Service – At Your Fingertips\n\nDell APEX PC-as-a-Service (PCaaS) is a fully customizable subscription that provides businesses with Dell PCs, in addition to procurement, deployment, support and lifecycle management solutions. This can help overcome the cost barrier to executing a tech refresh for PCs while avoiding downtime with rapid deployment and ease of scaling. In their customer interviews, ESG identified the following benefits from this offer:\n\nStandardization and governance. Consistent devices across the organization with control and visibility.\n\nPredictable costs. Comes with consistent monthly payments with more control and visibility of spend.\n\nSustainable lifecycle. Dell retires your devices in a secure and environmentally conscious manner.\n\nImproved support. Global team of experts worldwide to assist when needed.\n\n“Overall, Dell APEX PCaaS is about 13% lower in TCO than before and keeps us from having huge refresh investments hit at the same time.”1\n\n-Dell APEX Customer\n\nRead how a professional services organization benefited from Dell APEX PCaaS.\n\nAny-sized Organization, Enterprise-grade Support\n\nDell APEX Managed Device Service is a managed service subscription designed to shift the burden of day-to-day support and PC management to Dell. This month-to-month, all-inclusive solution allows your IT teams to focus on driving value for your business, instead of “keeping the lights on” with the day-to-day burden of device management. Customers pointed to the following benefits in their conversations with ESG:\n\nFlexibility in scale. Adjust the number of subscriptions up or down as needed.\n\nMonthly payments. All-inclusive model with no term commitments.\n\nImproved security. Dell ensures devices are updated and have the latest in antivirus and encryption capabilities.\n\nExpert support.

We are a growing org with needs that are constantly changing. Dell APEX Managed Device Service takes care of everything and allows us to focus on our business instead of trying to be IT experts.”1\n\n-Dell APEX Customer\n\nRead how a consulting organization is benefiting from Dell APEX Managed Device Service.\n\nBackup Without the Burden\n\nThe Dell APEX portfolio also brings an all-in-one data protection platform with backup, disaster recovery and long-term retention governance with Dell APEX Backup Services. No matter your size, ransomware attacks will always be a concern. This offer enables you to back up your endpoints and your SaaS apps like Office365, as well as hybrid workloads like VMware VMs. The ESG paper highlights the following customer benefits:\n\nReduced risk. Expert-level guidance and advanced encryption technologies to secure data.\n\nCost efficiency. Lower overall costs, coupled with the benefits of an as-a-Service model.\n\nAgility. A 100% SaaS offer with no infrastructure to manage.\n\nFlexibility. Unlimited on-demand scaling and flexibility in agreement terms fit your business needs today and tomorrow.\n\n“I can assure our leaders that we are more secure and protected against disasters because of Dell APEX Backup Services. We sleep better at night because of APEX.”1\n\n-Dell APEX Customer\n\nExplore how a healthcare organization applied Dell APEX Backup Services.\n\nAccelerating Growth with Dell APEX\n\nNo matter your resource needs or organization size, Dell APEX can help you refresh your devices, offload your management of those devices and securely back up your data.
