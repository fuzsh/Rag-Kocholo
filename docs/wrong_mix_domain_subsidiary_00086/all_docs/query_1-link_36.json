        "text": "Greetings from Dell Technologies World 2019. From the mainstage this year, we shared details on how we are working with industry leaders, Microsoft and Dell Technologies, to help customers better deploy, manage, secure and support their digital workspace.\n\nFirst, we announced a partnership with Microsoft that allows mutual customers to embrace Microsoft 365 and VMware Workspace ONE together to meet their digital workplace needs while leveraging Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) to modernize productivity and collaboration experiences.\n\nSecondly, Dell unveiled Dell Technologies Unified Workspace, a new offering powered by Workspace ONE which brings together Dell hardware, services and support with Workspace ONE and Secureworks to transform how customers deploy, secure, manage and support endpoints.\n\nThe net result of these partnerships – a big win for all of our mutual customers and I’m excited to share some of the details of what we announced below.\n\nExpanded Collaboration with Microsoft\n\nLast year, Microsoft and VMware partnered to introduce value-added services for virtual apps and desktops with VMware Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure to our customers. Building on this success, our teams continued to collaborate and are excited to partner to support key use cases across access, management, security and cloud-based Windows desktops.\n\nSo, what does this mean? Well first, mutual customers will now be able to take advantage of the powerful combination of Workspace ONE and Microsoft 365 to get the most out of the digital workspace across device platforms. Specifically, customers will be able to use Workspace ONE to secure Office 365 apps and data through cloud-based integration with Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory. Customers will also enjoy Workspace ONE workloads co-existing with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) on Windows 10 and leveraging security baselines to provide customers with a more secure and seamless path to manage their end-user computing environment.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft recently announced Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD), the only service that delivers a multi-session Windows 10 experience, optimizations for Office 365 ProPlus, and support for Windows Server Remote Desktop Services (RDS) desktops and apps. As a part of this agreement, VMware will extend the capabilities of Microsoft Windows Virtual Desktop to enable customers to further accelerate their cloud initiatives leveraging Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure.\n\nThese collaborations will help customers maximize the impact of their modern digital workspace investments in VMware and Microsoft across both Microsoft 365 and heterogeneous technology environments. We are excited to partner and integrate with Microsoft solutions to drive more value across these solutions over time, allowing customers to build, manage and deliver optimized digital workspace solutions to address key and critical use cases around Windows 10, Office 365 and WVD.\n\nFor more information on these integrations and availability, click here.\n\nDell Technologies Introduces Unified Workspace\n\nLet’s also talk about Dell Technologies Unified Workspace, a comprehensive solution to help IT deploy, secure, manage and support virtually all devices from the cloud. This new solution brings together Dell devices, Workspace ONE, Dell Services and Secureworks to give customers access to all of the hardware, software and support they need to streamline and accelerate how they support end-user computing. Unified Workspace is a perfect example of the power of integrating the best of Dell Technologies to improve how IT and employees work.\n\nOver the past several years, Dell and VMware have collaborated to help IT solve one of its most complex and expensive problems –PC lifecycle management (PCLM). Traditional PCLM tools were built on client-server technologies of 25 years ago that required siloed tools, large infrastructure, and endpoints to be “inside of the perimeter.” Today, as employees want to work on mobile devices and apps in addition to their desktops and Windows apps, oftentimes from outside a company’s secure network, traditional PCLM practices have become detached from the reality of today’s modern workforce.\n\nWith Dell Technologies Unified Workspace powered by VMware Workspace ONE, customers can transform every phase of PC management – from onboarding to configuration to patches and updates – and manage them right alongside all other employee and corporate-owned devices. For example, VMware IT now leverages Dell Provisioning for VMware Workspace ONE (available standalone or as part of Dell ProDeploy Client Suite) to ship preconfigured devices from the factory directly to end users with zero IT touch. We expect this service to yield significant savings in cost avoidance and will help us get colleagues up and running considerably faster than before.\n\nTake a look at the latest press release for a full rundown on all of the Unified Workspace services, including Dell Provisioning for VMware Workspace ONE, that feature Workspace ONE.\n\nWe are excited about the benefits our customers can leverage from these partnerships. This is a monumental step forward and we will continue to push the envelope to enable our customers can seamlessly make the transition to the digital workspace with us. To learn more watch this overview of the announcements made today. Be sure to check back in here for updates as our companies continue to work together to bring solutions to market that help our customers accelerate and simplify their transition to modern management.\n\nThis article may contain hyperlinks to non-VMware websites that are created and maintained by third parties who are solely responsible for the content on such websites."
