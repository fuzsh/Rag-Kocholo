For any student that is using their own laptop, they can get any brand; Huion, XP Pen, or other brands. However if they plan on using the school’s lab PCs they must get a Wacom brand tablet, any series will do. We also have Wacom pen display tablets in the lab. If they want to take advantage of those, they will need to additionally get a pen that works with them.\n\nWe recommend that you bring your laptop to class the first week. Your instructors will discuss the use of laptops within your classes. In general, avoid distracting other students by turning off instant messaging, email, games and other unnecessary applications before class begins.\n\nWhen using laptops and other computers, be aware of SNHU's Network Acceptable Use Policy and File Sharing Policy. Information Technology Solutions monitors illegal downloading of music and other files from campus sites and will restrict network usage for anyone found violating this policy.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you avoid downloading unnecessary programs, utilities and games onto your laptop. These programs can create problems with other software on your computer. It is best to keep your computer clean.\n\nYou may purchase any laptop brand that you wish and from any location/reseller but SNHU students can take advantage of discounts from Dell and Apple.\n\nSoftware: Microsoft Office is required for all students. Office 365 is available to all students for free.\n\nExtended Service: The Dell laptops in this program come with a 1-year limited warranty, plus 1 year of accidental damage service. We strongly recommend that you purchase the 4-year warranty and the 4-year accidental damage service or choose a plan that matches the length of time you expect to keep the laptop. The accidental damage service can take care of items not covered under the warranty including drops, power surges, screen breaks and spills. The top three repairs on campus tend to be broken screens, malware/virus removal and liquid damage like spills. Broken screens and liquid damage are not covered under a regular warranty but require accidental damage coverage.\n\nIf you purchase a brand other than Dell, accidental coverage may be available under a different name. Ask the reseller you are dealing with for details.\n\nIf your laptop requires service, bring it to the Technology Help Desk in the Wolak Library Learning Commons. Help Desk staff are certified to perform warranty repairs on Dell and Apple computers. For other brands, the Help Desk can perform limited service and any warranty repairs would be your responsibility to arrange.\n\nOrder By: Order your laptop by the first week of August to ensure it arrives in time for the fall semester.\n\nResident Students: When you come to campus, bring the following with copy of the paperwork that comes with your laptop, including the invoice, warranty, product registration and any manuals.\n\nInternational Students: If you reside outside of the United States and prefer to have the laptop shipped directly to your SNHU campus address, provide Dell with the following ship to address:\n\nSouthern New Hampshire University\n\n2500 North River Road\n\nManchester, New Hampshire 03106\n\nAttn: (Your Name), Incoming Student\n\nThen send an email to the mailroom supervisor at mailroom@snhu.edu to alert them that you have ordered a laptop computer and that it will be shipped to your campus address before your arrival.\n\nAll undergraduate day students are required to have a laptop computer for use in classes and other academic activities.\n\nMac Specifications\n\nPC Specifications\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nIf you are a game design or graphic design student, refer to the other sections on this page for additional or different equipment requirements.\n\nOffice 365 is available free of charge to all SNHU students and faculty. The Office suite will remain free while you are a student at SNHU. Upon graduation, you may convert to a paid subscription if you wish. Terms subject to change at Microsoft's discretion.\n\nAntivirus software is required for on campus students and will be provided if needed. Antivirus is strongly recommended for everyone. Check with your ISP as it may offer antivirus software free of charge to subscribers.\n\nOptional Accessories:\n\nMany people find it useful to have a second power cord: one for home and one for your bag.\n\nWhen seeking a more affordable alternative to PC or Apple laptops, select minimalist laptop models can perform the online coursework for most SNHU classes. A Chromebook is not recommended for SNHU coursework. (Note: Minimalist laptops are NOT recommended for computer science, construction management, engineering, game programming and development, graphic design or other processing-intensive programs.)\n\nWhile PC (Windows OS) or Apple (Mac OS) laptops are recommended to provide optimal experiences for SNHU students, we recognize that students may benefit from having more affordable computer options available.\n\nAffordable Minimal Recommended Model:\n\nLaptop Dell Latitude 3310\n\nWindows 10, 64-Bit\n\nProcessor: Intel® Celeron DC, Pentium DC, Core i3\n\nMemory (RAM): 4GB RAM\n\nStorage: 64GB eMMC\n\nDisplay: 13.3\" HD (1366 x 768) Non-Touch Anti-Glare, Camera & Microphone, WLAN Capable\n\nGraphics Card: Intel® HD Graphics\n\nBattery: 3-Cell/42-WHr ExpressChargeTM Capable Battery\n\nService\n\nIf your laptop requires servicing, bring it to the Technology Help Desk in the Wolak Library Learning Commons.\n\nInternational Students\n\nIf your laptop requires service while you are outside of the United States, call the manufacturer's support line directly.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you have questions or problems with your computer, visit the Technology Help Desk in the Wolak Library Learning Commons, login to mySNHU and create a case online, or call 1.855.877.9919. Support is available via the Help Desk from 8 am to 8 pm. (The schedule is published each fall with exact times.)\n\nIf you have questions about the information on this page or purchasing a laptop, email instructionalsupport@snhu.edu.\n\nTraining\n\nConsider enrolling in the IT-100 (Introduction to Information Technology) course early in your academic schedule for an introduction to the software on your laptop.\n\nYou may also access self-paced lessons through Infobase for your PC or Mac.\n\nThe Wolak Learning Center periodically offers workshops to better use the software on your laptop."
