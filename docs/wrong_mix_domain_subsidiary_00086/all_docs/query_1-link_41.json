        "text": "Our company just bought a bunch of new Dell computers. MS Office 2019 Home & Business (Not Office 365) came pre-installed and we activated some of them.\n\nThere is a program that is specific to our business and requires the MS Access Runtime to be installed to run. Access runtime (32 or 64-bit) will not install because it gives an error message saying it’s not compatible with the version of Office we have. Something about “click to run.”\n\nOur software vendor said we will need the 32-bit version of Office. The OEM version of Office on our Dell computers is 64-bit.\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to download the 32-bit version? I’ve tried calling Microsoft and got transferred all over the place and eventually got to the support option where they wanted $500.\n\nThanks!\n\nI think since you bought the license for Office when you bought the computer it’s probably a single use license for that machine. The only way I can think you you getting a 32 bit version of the same Office version is if you had access to Microsoft Licensing Center, and if you had licenses for the software as well."
