        "text": "Pat Gelsinger took a direct shot at claims by Nvidia chief Jensen Huang that traditional processors like Intel’s are running out of steam in the age of AI.\n\nThe results show that a downturn in tech spending could be drawing to a close after Cisco also beat quarterly revenue estimates.\n\nUS PC giant Dell Technologies saw its Chinese sales plummet in the second quarter, amid a weaker macro environment and plans to cut reliance on China-based supply chains.\n\nThe cooling demand is giving manufacturers the time ‘to make changes as many factories begin to explore production options outside China’, IDC said.\n\nLenovo saw a steeper-than-expected revenue decline to US$15.3 billion in the fourth quarter, as rivals HP and Dell also grappled with slowing PC sales after a work-from-home boom.\n\nAmid similar lay-offs by tech giants, the chief executive says he is forgoing his bonus, and other members of his leadership team will also take pay cuts.\n\nApple engineers are actively engaged in the project, although a launch has not been finalised, according to sources.\n\nDell wants all of the chips used in its products, including those made by foreign suppliers in China, to be sourced from outside the country.\n\nThe lay-offs are expected to be announced around the same time as Intel’s third-quarter earnings report on October 27.\n\nThe IPEF Upskilling Initiative will provide training for 7 million over a decade in Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nLockdowns and shipment delays caused by China’s zero-Covid strategy are adding to cost pressures for global PC makers, who are moving to diversify production away from the world’s No 2 economy.\n\nThe world’s top PC maker beat HP, Dell and Apple in global shipments of desktops, notebooks and workstations in the third quarter.\n\nThe American PC giants say customers will have to replace old office computers and work-at-home demand will continue after lockdown winds down.\n\nFrom humble beginnings to a trillion dollars: how the likes of Walt Disney and Apple’s Steve Jobs created the world’s most successful companies in unlikely places, and why Jobs’ garage is now a designated historic site\n\nWireless tech is getting cheaper all the time. From a US$34 computer keyboard and mouse combo, to earbuds superior to Apple’s AirPods Pro but which cost much less, these could be good for you – or for friends or family members."
