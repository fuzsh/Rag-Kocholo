        "text": "Hey there, student Cyclone!\n\nInformation Technology Services is here to power your journey with fast, reliable internet, modern software and apps and professional technical support. The Getting Started section is filled with tasks new students should complete at the same time as Orientation. Items in the Preparing for the New Semester section will help you get ready for a new semester or make your transition to campus easier and less stressful. Lastly, the On-Campus Technology section contains instructions and tasks best completed when you're on campus.\n\nStudents: Get Started with Technology\n\nWHAT'S A NET-ID?\n\nCREATE YOUR NET-ID NOW\n\nYour Network Identification, or Net-ID, is the group of characters before the \"@\" sign of your Iowa State email address. It is different than your University ID, which is the nine-digit number listed on the front of your ISUCard.\n\nYour Net-ID is important because it serves as your unique identifier during your adventure at Iowa State. In fact, many Iowa State accounts to which students have free access automatically recognize Iowa State Net-IDs as login credentials. You may have already created your Net-ID through your Iowa State admissions account, but if not you can set it up now.\n\nGo to asw.iastate.edu.\n\nClick on \"Need to register for a Net-ID?\" under the box labeled Register.\n\nEnter the required information and click Next.\n\nYou can keep the suggested Net-ID or change it here if you'd prefer.\n\nSet your password. Be sure to follow the password standards described on the page.\n\nClick Accept and then click Register.\n\nNOTE: the Net-ID registration may take a few minutes to process. For help, contact the IT Solution Center.\n\nAt some point, you may get locked out of your account or need to change your password for security reasons. We recommend enabling Password Reset for your account so you can quickly and easily reset your password any time - day or night. Without this feature enabled, you'll have to contact the IT Solution Center to have it reset. Follow the instructions below, also available in the ISU Service Portal.\n\nFOR NEW USERS\n\nFOR RETURNING USERS\n\nGo to login.iastate.edu and sign in with your Net-ID and password.\n\nYou'll be prompted toenter your secondary email address (non-Iowa State email). If you are not prompted automatically, follow the instructions for returning users (right).\n\nAdd your phone number to be texted, called or both in the event you need a recovery code to reset your account password.\n\nClick Create My Account.\n\nGo to login.iastate.edu and sign in with your Net-ID and password.\n\nSelect yourname in the upper right corner.\n\nSelectSettings from the dropdown menu.\n\nClick the greenEdit Profile button, and sign in again if prompted.\n\nScroll to the section Set up Forgot PasswordText Message. You can also choose the option to Set Up Forgot Password Voice Call.\n\nSelect Edit and add your information.\n\nLastly, select Send Code to verify this feature is set up.\n\nAt some point, you may get locked out of your account and need to reset your Net-ID password. We recommend enabling Password Reset for your account so you can quickly and easily reset your password any time. Without Password Reset enabled, you’ll have to contact the IT Solution Center to have it reset.\n\nENABLE PASSWORD RESET NOW\n\nGo to login.iastate.edu and sign in with your Net-ID and password\n\nYou'll be prompted toenter your secondary email address (non-Iowa State email).\n\nIf you are not prompted automatically, follow the instructions below (For Returning Users)\n\nAdd your phone number to be texted, called or both in the event you need a recovery code to reset your account password\n\nClick Create My Account\n\nFor Returning Users\n\nGo to login.iastate.edu and sign in with your Net-ID and password\n\nSelect yourname in the upper right corner\n\nSelectSettings\n\nSelectEdit next to Personal Information\n\nEnter yoursecondary email and selectSave\n\nSet up Forgot PasswordText Message, if desired\n\nSet up Forgot PasswordVoice Call, if desired\n\nIowa State uses a cybersecurity tool called multifactor authentication (MFA) to protect your login information. With MFA, you are required to complete a second login step after inputting your Net-ID (username) and password - like typing in a code received via text message. You will be automatically prompted to enable MFA when first signing into your Iowa State accounts.\n\nCHOOSE THE MFA METHOD RIGHT FOR YOU\n\nThere are five different verification options available for MFA: the Okta Verify app, the Google Authenticator app, SMS text message, voice call and Yubikeys (a USB-type physical device). Okta Verify is recommended for ease of use. You can learn more about the verification options in the ISU Service Portal. Most verification options will require a cell phone. If you don't have a cell phone and can't acquire a Yubikey, please contact the IT Solution Center before attempting to activate MFA.\n\nARE YOU OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES?\n\nWe recommend you set up an alternate form of MFA other than SMS text message or voice calls\n\nOkta is the name of your Iowa State Sign On Dashboard and the easiest way to log into your most-used and favorite applications. In fact, you've already visited the Sign On Dashboard to enable password reset.\n\nYour Sign On Dashboard is a “single sign-on, or SSO” solution. Once you log in, you can access Iowa State applications (like your email or online coursework) with just one click - like using a master key. Logging into accounts this way is quick and secure. Plus, you only have to remember one password rather than typing in your login credentials for each website.\n\nLearn how to add more applications and organize your dashboard with sections.\n\nSet up apps to autolaunch when signing in - no more clicks required!\n\nIowa State’s email platform is Microsoft Outlook. Your Outlook account was automatically created after you received your Net-ID, and your Iowa State email address is: [Your Net-ID]@iastate.edu. Your Outlook account can be accessed through your Sign On Dashboard at login.iastate.edu. It can also be added as an app to your phone, tablet or computer.\n\nAs a student Cyclone, all communication from Iowa State offices will go to your Iowa State Outlook (not a previously-used email account). This can include correspondence from Admissions, Financial Aid, the Registrar’s Office, your academic advisor, your instructors and others. In other words, you are responsible for the information that is sent to you. Learn more about using Outlook.\n\nMicrosoft Outlook also offers a calendar. It's great for keeping track of classes, marking exams and scheduling study time or other events. Since faculty and staff also use Outlook, it's possible to request appointments through Outlook. However, be sure to confirm Outlook is the preferred scheduling method, either by referring to your syllabus or reaching out to the individual you're meeting with. Many offices use their own scheduling software, particularly academic advisors, in order to ensure a high-quality experience for everyone.\n\nYour ISUCard is your physical, permanent university identification card, which includes your picture and 9-digit university identification number. You will use your card for most campus services, including door access, meals on campus, testing centers, recreation center, riding CyRide, the library and many more. To request your ISUCard, be sure to carefully read through the guidelines on taking an ID photo and how to submit your photo.\n\nASSISTANCE FROM THE IT SOLUTION CENTER\n\nThe IT Solution Center, located on the first floor of Parks Library, is your on-campus resource for technology assistance with a technician. It is open seven days a week, except for university holidays, see hours of operation. You can easily request help from the IT Solution Center though the Get Help option in the ISU Service Portal. You can also contact the IT Solution Center by calling 515-294-4000 or emailing solution@iastate.edu, even if you experience issues before you arrive on campus.\n\nSYSTEM STATUS\n\nITS offers a central StatusHub with information about various campus technologies, like the internet networks and email. You can subscribe to email notifications when there are outages or planned maintenance so you're always in the loop. Learn how to subscribe to notifications. You can access the StatusHub from the ITS website menu and by going directly to status.it.iastate.edu.\n\nSELF SERVICE THROUGH THE ISU SERVICE PORTAL\n\nIn the ISU Service Portal, you can browse a database of how-to technology articles. Easily search the issue you are having to find possible solutions. For example, you can find instructions for how add apps to your Sign On Dashboard, print to a campus printer and more. Access the ISU Service Portal by visiting it.iastate.edu/Portal or by clicking the ISU Service Portal tile on your Okta dashboard.\n\nPHYSICAL REPAIRS THROUGH TECHCYTE\n\nTechCyte in the ISU Book Store has licensed and trained technicians that can service both Dell and Apple computers in their Service Center in the Memorial Union. View their contact information, service rates and schedule an appointment here.\n\nSecure your Devices\n\nFollow these steps to ensure private data is secure on your personal device:\n\nInstall software updates\n\nSet a screen lock\n\nCreate a good login password\n\nEnable full disk encryption\n\nLock your computer when away\n\nPhysically secure your laptop\n\nKeep your personal firewall enabled\n\nKeep your antivirus, antispyware and anti-malware software enabled\n\nConnect to Wi-Fi networks with care\n\nDelete ISU private data you don’t need\n\nInstall software updates\n\nYour operating system and app store will tell you when you need to install updates.\n\nIf you disabled updates, turn them back.\n\nInstall them quickly.\n\nSome apps may also use native MacOS and Windows notifications to inform you about updates.\n\nWindows\n\nMacOS\n\nManually Check for Updates.\n\nWindows devices: Check for updates manually.\n\nFor macOS: Check for updates manually.\n\nFor a mobile phone or tablet:\n\niPhone / iPad instructions to check for updates manually.\n\nAndroid instructions to check for updates manually.\n\nSet a screen lock\n\nFor macOS devices\n\nSelect the menu icon (Apple icon in upper left hand corner of your screen).\n\nSelect System Preferences.\n\nClick the Security & Privacy application.\n\nIn the General tab ensure the check box next to \"Require password after sleep or screen saver begins\" is checked\n\nFor Windows devices\n\nGo to Settings menu.\n\nSelect Personalization, then Lock Screen.\n\nIn Screen Saver Settings, select a screen saver other than \"none.\"\n\nEnsure the box next to On resume, display logon screen is checked\n\nFor a mobile phone or tablet\n\nSet a passcode.
