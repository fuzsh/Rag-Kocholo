        "text": "Microsoft 365 Government - how to buy\n\nIn response to the unique and evolving requirements of the United States public sector, Microsoft created specific Microsoft 365 Government environments for US public sector customers. This service description provides an overview of the environments and more information on how to buy. We recommend that you read this service description alongside other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 service descriptions.\n\nWhatâs Microsoft 365 Government?\n\nMicrosoft 365 Government is a set of productivity, security, and mobility cloud software capabilities tailored for US government agencies and contractors sponsored to hold controlled, unclassified information.
