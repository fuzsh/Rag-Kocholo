        "text": "Is Windows 10 part of your digital workplace strategy? We can help.\n\nMicrosoft has named Dell Services the “2018 SI & Consulting Windows 10 Global Deployment Partner of the Year.” The award was presented to Dell by the Microsoft One Commercial Partner (OCP) team at last month’s Microsoft Inspire.\n\n2018 marks the 8th consecutive year that Microsoft has recognized Dell as its “Partner of the Year” for Windows deployment. Dell also earned this year’s “FY18 US Marketing Top Commercial Windows 10 Deployment Partner” award from the US Microsoft 365 team.\n\nThe awards recognize Dell Services as the #1 Global SI (Systems Integrator) for Windows 10—as well as the investments that Dell has made to make it easier for enterprises worldwide to deploy and migrate to Windows 10 and leverage the Microsoft 365-Modern Workplace.\n\nWindows 10 is ready… are you?\n\nWindows 10 is the fastest-growing Windows operating system in history.\n\nIn today’s world, with security of utmost importance, Windows 10 is Microsoft’s most secure Client OS to-date. For example, the Windows 10 secure boot process ensures only approved ﬁrmware can be loaded and only approved apps started. Windows 10 also enables automatic encryption of data and multifactor authentication.\n\nSince most breaches originate from the client device, enterprises cannot afford to wait to migrate to Windows 10.\n\nIf your organization hasn’t fully migrated to Windows 10, you’re not alone. But with the clock ticking down to January 14, 2020 when support for Windows 7 ends, now is a good time to investigate what Dell Services can do as your Windows 10 solution provider.\n\nStart with a big-picture Workforce Transformation strategy for how to best leverage Windows 10 as part of a cohesive digital workplace and end-user services plan. We can help customize and integrate end-to-end Microsoft solutions into the existing environment and determine the right mix of on-premises, cloud, or hybrid deployment for Windows 10 and Office 365.\n\nThe Dell Client Deployment Assessment service evaluates current practices and recommends and develops an action plan for Windows 10 migration. If device renewal is part of the plan, the Dell ProDeploy Client Suite service provides expert configuration and installation, reducing deployment time for new client systems by up to 35 percent.[1] With Dell PC as a Service, organizations can opt to combine hardware, software, lifecycle management and financing into one price for everything per-seat-per-month service.\n\nWhat about WaaS?\n\nWith the new Windows as a Service (WaaS) OS upgrade model, Windows releases become incremental. Updates are delivered in smaller packages more frequently—a couple of times a year, rather than in one big package every 3-5 years. Users and administrators get new features and capabilities faster—and IT can say goodbye to disruptive, large-scale Windows OS migrations.\n\nWhile incremental updating is a routine event with over-the-counter software and mobile devices, WaaS will shift how IT manages its enterprise Windows environment. To help IT organizations ease the transition to Windows 10 updates as an ongoing maintenance activity, we created Dell Windows as a Service. Developed with Microsoft and built on the Microsoft WaaS framework, this new managed service leverages Dell’s global Windows expertise to help internal teams take a policy-based and programmatic approach to updates and get up to speed on everything from identifying applications for additional testing to handling pilot release and production rollouts.\n\nMost secure Windows ever\n\nAnother new managed service: Dell Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Managed Service is designed to help IT organizations augment the strength of Windows Defender ATP in Windows 10. Dell security professionals apply a range of cybersecurity methodologies and solutions to help protect users, data, and IP. The service helps organizations prevent and detect cyberattacks, as well as provides specific guidance and support for investigating and responding to attacks and other malicious behaviors.\n\nAll-in with Windows 10\n\nAt Dell, we’re all in with Windows 10. It’s why we migrated 100% of our own workforce to Windows 10 in 2017—and why we’re working with companies of all kinds to accelerate and ease migration to Microsoft 365 (integrating Windows10 Enterprise, Office 365 Suite and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EM+S)).\n\nLearn more about how Dell consulting, deployment, integration, training and support services make it easier to enable people to work and collaborate securely, anywhere, on any device, to get digital business done.
