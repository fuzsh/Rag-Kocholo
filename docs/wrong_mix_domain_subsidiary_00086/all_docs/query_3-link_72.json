        "text": "In an onstage interview at Structure 2015, Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla said that “EMC and Dell merging is a really good financial move for Michael, but it will set back innovation and distract from innovation.”\n\nVinod is a smart venture capitalist and I don’t doubt his ability to recognize innovation in startups, but his view on our ability to innovate at scale is not entirely accurate.\n\nEMC, and going forward Dell+EMC, will continue to leverage a dual track innovation model where we internally invest in incremental and disruptive technologies AND aggressively seed, cultivate, acquire and scale disruptive startups. This model has worked extremely well given that we are generally viewed as one of the more innovative technology companies even though we compete with companies many times our size.\n\nDell+EMC will actually remove one of the disadvantages EMC has had versus startups, the artificial quarterly cadence with short term expectations that dominate public company culture. Under a privately-controlled structure, the combined company would have more time to execute on innovation and more scale in R&D. It would also allow for the reassignment of $3.5B on average which currently goes to share buybacks and dividends each year.\n\nWhat matters most in this debate will be the results and we are quite proud of the outcomes of our innovation so far. We are the leader in storage, virtualization and data protection. We are the market segment leader in all flash arrays. We are the creator and leader of the converged infrastructure segment.\n\nWe are generally viewed as one of the most successful M&A engines of all time and we grow our acquisitions well. Most of our inorganic transactions became leaders in technology and innovation after we acquired them.\n\nWe also spend billions of dollars each year on R&D internally to keep the acquired technologies in the lead and to invent new products and technology where we see gaps (ex./ CloudPools, Atmos, ViPR, Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), Vblocks, most of Cloud Foundry, RackHD, and CoprHD).\n\nWhile our innovation engine is more complex and multifaceted than a single startup, it results in an industry leading flow of innovation that we think will create enormous strength within the combined Dell+EMC.\n\nI am glad that leading VCs are watching EMC as we benefit tremendously from many channels of innovation. As a roughly $80B entity, Dell+EMC will need more than just one source and method of innovation. Our model provides exactly that.\n\nThere will never be an end to the opportunities for organic growth and strategic external investment as long as innovation remains core to being successful in business and IT.\n\nDisclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements\n\nThis communication contains forward-looking information about EMC Corporation and the proposed transaction that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
