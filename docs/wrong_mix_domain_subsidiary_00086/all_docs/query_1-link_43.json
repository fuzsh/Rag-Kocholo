        "text": "Prev Next 7 key benefits of mobile device management for businesses How to successfully implement MDM for BYOD\n\nX\n\nFree Download What is unified endpoint management (UEM)? A complete guide\n\nWhen enterprise employees worked almost exclusively in company offices, they sat at desks and did their work on company-owned desktop computers. Now an employee's work moves with them from place to place. On laptops and tablets and phones. And very often, the work resides on devices the employees own. All this has shifted the work of the enterprise IT staff dramatically. This cavalcade of mobile devices and remote employees is one reason unified endpoint management came to be. In this guide, we look at what UEM can do, its main features, how to choose the right UEM product for your organization – and much more.\n\nCompare capabilities of Office 365 MDM vs. Intune\n\nOffice 365 MDM and Intune both offer the ability to manage mobile devices, but Intune provides deeper management and security. Delve into this comparison of the two consoles.\n\nBy\n\nPeter van der Woude, KPN ICT Consulting\n\nMicrosoft offers two mobile device management methods: MDM for Office 365 and Microsoft Intune.\n\nThe enterprise mobility industry has changed significantly in the past few years. Mobile device management (MDM) platforms such as MDM for Office 365 were once enough for most organizations. As iPads, wearables and IoT devices became prevalent in the enterprise, many organizations needed advanced management capabilities and a unified console. Unified endpoint management (UEM) products such as Intune entered the market, allowing IT admins to manage a range of different devices under a single console.\n\nMDM for Office 365 provides a limited feature set, but it is included in the price of many Office 365 subscriptions. This built-in tool offers organizations an integrated, inexpensive way to manage mobile devices. Microsoft Intune, on the other hand, provides a rich feature set and comes with additional costs.\n\nMDM for Office 365 capabilities\n\nMDM for Office 365 provides a lightweight version of MDM that does not include mobile application management (MAM). It provides organizations with MDM policies and settings that will help to control access to Office 365 data for supported mobile devices and apps. For stolen or lost devices, it offers the ability to remotely wipe the device to remove corporate data.\n\nSupported platforms\n\nMDM for Office 365 provides support for the following platforms:\n\nIOS 14.0 or later.\n\nAndroid 8.0 or later.\n\nWindows 10 or 11 -- this requires the device to be Azure Active Directory joined.\n\nSupported access control scenarios\n\nMDM for Office 365 provides a few scenarios that will prompt users to enroll their devices. When the user's device doesn't comply with the policy, the user might be blocked from accessing Office 365 data, depending on the policy configuration.\n\nThis article is part of\n\nWhat is unified endpoint management (UEM)? A complete guide\n\nWhich also includes:\n\n7 key benefits of mobile device management for businesses\n\nCompare capabilities of Office 365 MDM vs. Intune\n\nHow to successfully implement MDM for BYOD\n\nThese are the following scenarios:\n\nAccess to Exchange by using the built-in mail app on iOS 14 or later.\n\nAccess to Exchange by using the built-in mail app on Android 8 or later.\n\nAccess to Office and OneDrive for Business by using the Outlook, OneDrive, Word, Excel or PowerPoint app on iOS 14 or later.\n\nAccess to Office and OneDrive for Business by using the Outlook, OneDrive, Word, Excel, PowerPoint or the Office Mobile app on Android 8 or later.\n\nPeople using mobile browsers to access Office 365 data will not be prompted to enroll their devices and will not be blocked.\n\nSupported policy settings\n\nWith MDM for Office 365, IT can enable certain settings as requirements to access Office 365 data. IT can use these settings in the supported access control scenarios to block users from accessing Office 365 data. These settings are divided into the following categories:\n\nSecurity, which require password settings.\n\nEncryption, which require encryption settings.\n\nJailbroken, which require non-jailbroken devices.\n\nManaged email profile, which require managed email profile.\n\nMDM for Office 365 also provides a limited set of policies that IT can use to configure user device settings, such as policies to prevent data loss on devices, access public clouds, make screen captures and access the store.\n\nMicrosoft Intune capabilities\n\nMicrosoft Intune is a UEM platform that provides MDM and MAM functionality and comes with additional costs, as it's not part of the different Office 365 subscriptions. It requires an organization to have licenses that include the rights to use Microsoft Intune. These licenses include Microsoft Intune standalone, the Enterprise Mobility + Security and Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\n\nMicrosoft Intune helps organizations provide MDM and MAM policies and settings that will help control access to corporate data. This includes data in Office 365 and nearly all corporate data available from apps exposed via Azure Active Directory (AAD). For stolen or lost devices, Intune provides the ability to remotely wipe the device or app to remove corporate data. It also allows organizations to secure and manage mobile devices, apps and corporate data.\n\nSupported platforms\n\nMicrosoft Intune provides support for the following platforms:\n\nIOS and iPadOS 14.0 and later.\n\nMacOS 11.0 and later.\n\nWindows 10, including Windows 10 Teams, Windows 10 IoT and Windows Holographic for Business.\n\nSupported access scenarios\n\nMicrosoft Intune supports many scenarios. The main difference of MDM for Office 365 versus Intune is that Intune is not limited to Office 365-related scenarios. For most organizations, the management boundaries must expand to include all apps and data that can be exposed via AAD and all apps on devices that can use modern authentication. Intune integrates well within a Microsoft ecosystem, including Office 365.\n\nMicrosoft Intune can do more than control access to corporate apps and data. IT can use Intune to verify compliance of devices; deploy applications; assign advanced configurations, including Wi-Fi configuration; push certificates and VPN configurations; provide inventory information; and more. And that's only mentioning MDM scenarios. It also provides MAM scenarios, including limiting access to corporate apps and data and performing a selective wipe of only the app.\n\nSupported policy settings\n\nMicrosoft Intune provides many policy settings and listing all the possibilities is nearly impossible. It provides the policy settings available with MDM for Office 365 and many more. These policy settings are categorized to provide the functionality to address the supported access scenarios -- for example, policies to verify access requirements; verify compliance; configure settings; configure updates; and the ability to deploy, configure and manage apps.\n\nMDM for Office 365 vs. Microsoft Intune\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the main capabilities of MDM for Office 365 versus Microsoft Intune.\n\nIt should be clear that Microsoft Intune is the most logical choice from a security and management perspective. That doesn't mean there is no use case for MDM for Office 365. It could be enough for smaller organizations or organizations that only use Office 365. However, that requires strong agreements with the employees, as MDM for Office 365 only provides basic security for accessing Office 365 data.\n\nMDM for Office 365 is a good starting point for any organization deploying MDM. To provide real security and management capabilities, however, any organization should eventually consider using Microsoft Intune when using more than just Office 365.\n\nOrganizations can run both products alongside each other to support a migration path from MDM for Office 365 and Microsoft Intune. When a user gets a Microsoft Intune license, the enrollment process will automatically prefer the Microsoft Intune enrollment above the MDM for Office 365 enrollment.\n\nNext Steps\n\nHow to evaluate on-premises vs. cloud-based MDM, UEM\n\nEvaluate Intune alternatives for mobility management\n\nRelated Resources\n\nYour Complete Guide to Unified Endpoint Management –TechTarget\n\nUnified Endpoint Management Solutions, 2021–22 –IBM\n\nComputer Weekly – 7 August 2018: How digital is driving golf to the connected ... –TechTarget ComputerWeekly.com\n\nA Computer Weekly buyer's guide to going beyond desktop Computing –TechTarget ComputerWeekly.com\n\nDig Deeper on Unified endpoint management\n\nHow to add and enroll devices to Microsoft Intune\n\nBy: Peter van der Woude\n\nHow to use Managed Google Play with Microsoft Intune\n\nBy: Helen Searle-Jones\n\nA guide to Intune Suite licensing for endpoint management\n\nBy: Robert Sheldon\n\nDeploying Intune's Microsoft configuration manager console\n\nBy: Peter van der Woude"
