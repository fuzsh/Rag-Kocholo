        "text": "Microsoft presented Dell with the “Microsoft 365 US Modern Desktop Deployment Partner of the Year” award at this year’s Microsoft Inspire partner conference. This award marks the 9th year in a row that Microsoft has named Dell its top US deployment partner—a record that spans Windows 7, 8, 10, and now M365, which integrates Windows 10, Office 365, and Enterprise Mobility and Security.\n\nThis is also the third consecutive year that Dell has been a Winner or Finalist of the Microsoft Partner Network’s Global Modern Desktop Partner of the Year—and we are the only partner to finish in the top four all three years.\n\nThe awards are a welcome validation and opportunity to recognize our teams for, as Microsoft puts it: “demonstrating excellence in innovation and implementation of customer solutions based on Microsoft technology.”\n\nBut What Do They Mean For You?\n\nAs the clock ticks down to Windows 7 end of support, our decades of partnership with Microsoft and investments in innovative, flexible services are helping organizations of all types and sizes to put the latest Microsoft solutions, updated processes, and security features to work to enable their employees to do their best work—anywhere, anytime.\n\nOrganizations as diverse as the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), a maritime classification society that sets safety standards for 12,000+ commercial vessels and offshore facilities, and YES Prep a network of public, open-enrollment charter schools in greater Houston, are benefiting from Dell Technologies services.\n\nFor ABS, as this video describes, the challenge was moving from multiple versions of Windows on multiple kinds of hardware to Windows 10 and Office 365 Pro Plus on the latest Dell technology in ports around the world. Dell helped the ABS take advantage of Advanced Threat Protection features in Windows 10 and O365 Pro Plus to enhance its core application security. And today ABS relies on Dell for automated deployment of OS upgrades to devices around the globe.\n\nFor YES Prep, as this video describes, Dell helped create a strategy to equip all of its students with access to the latest technology using pre-configured, ready-to-use laptops running M365. With just a few clicks, students were able to start using the most up-to-date Windows tools for creation, collaboration, and learning. In addition to access, security was extremely important to the YES Prep team. They had purchased licenses for the Microsoft Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP) to protect against data and endpoint security breach, but did not have the resources to deploy it. Dell provided a WDATP as a Service solution that delivered enterprise-grade security while enabling YES Pres to concentrate on the student learning environment. Today, students can access their personal workplace from any device seamlessly and securely.\n\nWhy Dell Is ‘All About The Experience’\n\nOur vision is to continue to make it easy and affordable for organizations of all sizes and types to leverage our expertise, IP, and global resources to deliver a modern Windows experience to their users—faster, with less risk, cost, and effort.\n\nEvery day, we image and deploy thousands of Windows devices all over the globe using a trusted, highly effective supply chain. Dell was the first Microsoft Services Partner to automate Windows Autopilot and ship devices registered straight from the factory. Today, Dell Provisioning for Windows Autopilot and Dell Provisioning for VMware Workspace ONE modernize how organizations deploy Windows PCs, as well as other devices (clients, phones, IoT), giving IT administrators the ability to automatically provision new devices from the cloud to the end users’ desk.\n\nUsing Microsoft SCCM and Intune or VMware Workspace ONE to define their company’s standards and user specifications in the cloud—IT can rely on us to then configure and ship devices to desktops anywhere in the world. Devices arrive with the company’s Microsoft-supported Windows 10 desktop image, device drivers, user profile and access privileges. Before the user powers-on the device, it has already been automatically registered and enrolled in the Microsoft Store for Business/Partner Portal and the employee gets a ready-to-use, out-of-the-box experience—all without the need for any touches by in-house technicians.\n\nDelegate to Dell\n\nMany organizations also rely on Dell to offload all or some of their Windows and security management tasks. Dell WaaS Management Services, developed with Microsoft, keep PCs up-to-date with Windows 10 releases. And Dell Cybersecurity Services help organizations protect users and data by taking full advantage of Microsoft’s latest security features along with Dell data, endpoint, and cyber security solutions.\n\nDell deployment services—from basic hardware installations through planning, configuration and complex integrations—accelerate the time to workforce productivity, while reducing costs. For example, research shows organizations that leverage Dell ProDeploy Plus services can reduce deployment time by up to 56% with savings up to $792 in deployment costs by per PC."
