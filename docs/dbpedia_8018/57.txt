Ivan Shishkin was a prominent Russian landscape painter of the 19th century. He was a young prodigy, studying at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts and earning scholarships to meet artists all over Europe. He learned his signature precise linear style in Dusseldorf, Germany, and returned to Russia with an established reputation. He worked with Ivan Kramskoy, a well-loved Russian painter, and joined his artistic group, The Wanderers. Within the group, he was encouraged toward landscape painting. He rejected the popular plein air technique, preferring to spend hours inside the studio to achieve lifelike precision. Russians applauded his rigid and epic style and celebrated his work as an example of the superiority of Russian wildlife and nature. Capturing the national spirit so well, he earned the title the “tsar of the woods.”
