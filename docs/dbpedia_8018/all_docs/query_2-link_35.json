        "text": "\"Morning in a Pine Forest\" is a painting attributed to the Russian painter Ivan Shishkin, based on the creative method and painting manner. However, it was believed that some parts of the painting, particularly the bears, were painted by another popular Russian painter, Konstantin Savitsky. The painting features four bears gathered around and on a fallen tree in a pine forest, the location of which is believed to be in Narva-Joesuu in Estonia. The painting has been widely reproduced not only on canvas but also on various items. It is reminiscent of other Shishkin paintings, The Sestroretsk Forest (1896) and Forest in Spring (1884).This is an image of the famous artwork.
