        "text": "The post-1850 artistic styles of Realism, Impressionism, and Post-Impressionism existed alongside something new: photography. Where previously art had a practical purpose to preserve or convey an image, now photography usurped that and made arts like painting a solely expressive and decorative pursuit. This made styles like Impressionism possible.\n\nTravelers to Paris will definitely want to learn about this period of art history, as the city has a myriad of art museums dedicated to it including Musée D'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet, Musée L'Orangerie, and Musée Rodin. (And of course Monet's legendary garden at Giverny is a day trip outside the city.) In Amsterdam, visitors will find the Van Gogh Museum dedicated to the life and works of the great Dutch Post-Impressionist artist. London offers the Courtauld Gallery, and the National Gallery to see paintings of the period.\n\nWith these guides you'll be able to select just the content that you are looking for. Work your way through each section in chronological order, or go straight to a specific topic or artist. Simply find the era you want to learn about and then select either a general educational resource, or for more detail select an artist from the alphabetical listing.\n\n[Content Warning: Some programs in these listings feature art that contains nudity or unvarnished intimate details of artists' personal lives. I suggest pre-screening content before showing it to children if that concerns you.]\n\nRealism\n\nEvery artistic movement creates a backlash, and for Romanticism that backlash was Realism. The artists of the Realist movement portrayed the real world in their art: real people, real places, real life. Instead of presenting the world through \"rose colored glasses\" and romanticizing it, their images showed the gritty reality of all classes of life and all types of people.\n\nReArt: Wanderers: Aleksey Savrasov, Ilya Repin, Isaac Levitan, Ivan Shishkin, Viktor Vasnetsov\n\nRealist Artists\n\nThe Realism movement was centered in 19th century France with names like Manet, Corot and Courbet, but extended into other countries (and even into the 20th century with artists like the American Ashcan school).The list below is alphabetical and may be missing artists of note because they do not have free content on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nAlbert Anker (1831-1910)\n\nThis Swiss painter and Illustrator is often referred to as the \"national painter\" of Switzerland because of his works' pastoral depictions of Swiss village life. Anker's work has been featured on Swiss postal stamps. His studio in Ins, Switzerland is preserved as a museum.\n\nPaintings of the World (Episode 1)\n\nEdward Hopper (1882-1967)\n\nHopper is the pre-eminent 20th century American realist painter. His spare style influenced later prominent modernists like Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothco. Hopper's most famous picture, the diner scene \"Nighthawks\", can be seen at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMasterworks from the Great Museums of the World (Season 1, Episode 4 - Edward Hopper - Nighthawks)\n\nÉdouard Manet (1832-1883)\n\nDespite being considered a major foundational figure for Impressionism, Manet persisted in submitting to the official Salon throughout his career instead of joining the exhibitions put on by his Impressionist friends. A few paintings like \"The Spanish Singer\" did gain acceptance to the Salon. But Manet's controversial style of putting nudes in contemporary settings led the Salon to refuse others considered masterworks today (\"Olympia\" and \"Luncheon in the Grass\", both of which can be seen at Musée D'Orsay in Paris).\n\nManet and the Birth of Impressionism: In this 90 minute biography, British art critic Waldemar Januszczak explores the complex and talented man credited with founding Impressionism but who held himself apart from it.\n\nThe Impressionists with Tim Marlow (Episode 1)\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 16 - Edouard Manet:\"Olympia\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 17 - Edouard Manet: The Salmon)\n\nExhibition on Screen (Season 1 - Episode 2 - Manet)\n\nIlya Repin (1844-1930)\n\nRepin was one of the first Russian painters to gain fame in Europe, exhibiting at the Paris Salon in 1874-1876 and serving as a painting judge at the 1900 Paris Exposition. He's famous for painting for scenes of peasant life, such as in his famous painting \"Barge Haulers on the Volga\". The work of Ilya Repin helped provide the foundation of 20th century Soviet realist art.\n\nPaintings of the World (Episode 7)\n\nFamous People of the World: Ilya Repin\n\nImpressionism & Post-Impressionism\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the detailed, almost photorealistic style of realism gave birth to its opposite: Impressionism. This new revolution in painting focused not on capturing the subject in accurate detail, but rather on capturing the play of light on a scene. The Impressionists also advanced the idea of painting \"en plein air\", painting out in nature. Small brushstrokes of paint replaced detailed lines in making an image. Rejected by the traditional annual Paris Salon exhibitions due to their radical painting style and subjects, the Impressionists banded together to form their own exhibition.Post-Impressionism, despite its name, started with artists like Cezanne and Van Gogh working alongside the Impressionists. Where Impressionism sought to capture light, Post-Impressionism sought to capture meaning. More abstract than Impressionism, Post-Impressionism was the bridge between that style and modern art styles like Cubism and Fauvism.\n\nThe Impressionists with Tim Marlow: This British show is hosted by art historian Tim Marlow. The short 23-minute episodes each focus on just a single artist, making them a great starting point for learning the history and biography of the artists.\n\nSeason One: Manet, Monet, Renoir, Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cezanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh.\n\nThe Impressionists: British art critic Waldemar Januszczak's approach here is to tell the story of the Impressionist art movement as a whole, rather than focusing solely on individual artists. Over the course of four episodes (each an hour long), he traces the Impressionist movement and its most famous artists, influences and places.\n\nThe Impressionistic Masters: A very brief (26 minute) documentary that provides an overview of the Impressionist movement and the major artists that were a part of it: Degas, Monet, Renoir, Pissaro, and others.\n\nReArt: Impressionism: Gaugin, Van Gogh, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Cezanne, Claude Monet, Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Konstantin Korovin, Oleksandr Murashko, Camille Pissarro, Frederic Bazille, Henri Rousseau, Pierre-Auguste Renoir\n\nExhibition on Screen (Season 2 - Episode 5 - The Impressionists)\n\nExhibition on Screen: History's Greatest Artists (Season 3 - Episode 3 - Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse)\n\nHermitage Masterpieces: (Episodes 17 & 18) This 18-part series examines the art masterpieces by artists like Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Picasso, Matisse, Velasquez, El Greco, Rubens, and Renoir that are housed in Russia's Hermitage Museum. Each approximately half-hour episode focuses on a different type or period of art. This series was filmed before the fall of the Soviet Union, when the Hermitage was off-limits to Western visitors.\n\nImpressionist & Post-Impressionist Artists\n\nThe majority of the artists in the Paris-based Impressionist movement were French. The Impressionist and Post-Impressionist movements created some of the most famous names in all of art history: Monet, Van Gogh, Degas, and Renoir, to name just a few.The list below is alphabetical and may be missing artists of note because they do not have free content on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nFrédéric Bazille (1841-1870)\n\nBazille's career in Impressionism is largely a story of unrealized potential, since he was tragically killed in battle at age 28 during the Franco-Prussian war. Before his untimely death, the wealthy young art student was friends with (and generously shared his studio with) fellow Impressionists Monet, Sisley, Manet, and Renoir. Bazille was thus involved in the early development of Impressionism, but due to his early death and small body of work has remained a relatively obscure artist compared to his contemporaries.\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 25 - Frederic Bazille:\"The Terrace At Méric (Oleander)\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 26 - Frederic Bazille:\"Port Of The Queen At Aigues-Mortes\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 27 - Frederic Bazille:\"The Little Gardener\")\n\nGustave Caillebotte (1848-1894)\n\nCaillebotte is largely known for painting Paris street scenes that had a more realistic style than his fellow Impressionists. Wealthy in his own right, Caillebotte didn't need to make a living selling his art, and was able to finance Impressionist exhibitions and support his Impressionist friends by buying their art. After his death in 1894, he bequeathed his collection of Impressionist art to the Louvre, where it became the basis of the French national collection of their art seen today at Musée D'Orsay and other French museums.\n\nMasterworks from Great Museums of the World (Season 20 - Episode 3 - Gustave Caillebotte - Paris Street Scene in the Rain)\n\nMary Cassatt (1844-1926)\n\nCassatt, the sole American to exhibit with the Impressionists, lived most of her adult life in France pursuing her art career. Cassatt was mentored by Degas, and is largely known for her portraits. Late in her career she especially focused on portraits featuring mothers with children. In addition to her own creative work, Cassatt's relationships with American collectors Bertha Palmer and Louise Havemeyer influenced their purchases of Impressionist art that later served as the foundation for the Chicago Institute of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collections, respectively.\n\nGreat Artists with Tim Marlow (Season 2 - Episode 11)\n\nMasterworks from Great Museums of the World (Season 20 - Episode 1 - Mary Cassatt - The Bath)\n\nPaul Cézanne (1839-1906)\n\nCézanne is the French Post-Impressionist artist who laid the foundation for the transition to modern art, influencing Matisse and Picasso among others. He was taught and influenced by Camille Pissarro, and exhibited in the early Impressionist exhibits. Today, visitors to Aix-en-Provence can still visit his studio there, preserved as a museum. Cézanne held the record for highest price ever for a painting (a rumored $250-$300 million in 2011 for \"The Card Players\") until the sale of Da Vinci's newly discovered \"Salvator Mundi\" in 2017.\n\nThe Impressionists with Tim Marlow (Episode 6)\n\nBrushstrokes: Every Picture Tells A Story (Season 1 - Episode 3 - The Card Players by Paul Cezanne)\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 11 - Paul Cezanne:\"Still Life with Peppermint Bottle\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 12 - Paul Cezanne:\"Chestnut Trees at Jas de Bouffan\")\n\nReArt: Expressionism (Episode 8 - Paul Cezanne \"The Peppermint Bottle\")\n\nArt of the Heist (Episode 5 - Chasing Cezanne)\n\nEdgar Degas (1834-1917)\n\nAlthough considered by many to be the father of modern sculpture, Rodin also produced thousands of paintings, drawings and prints. Detail and depth of emotion are signatures of his sculptures, bringing an accusation of fakery when he produced his first masterpiece \"The Age of Bronze\". Rodin was especially prolific at portraits, producing a large number of busts of well-known contemporaries. Rodin's former Paris home is now open to the public as the acclaimed Musée Rodin. Visitors to the museum can view his personal art collection alongside a large collection of his work, including famous works like \"The Thinker\", \"The Gates of Hell\" and \"The Burghers of Calais\".\n\nGreat Artists with Tim Marlow (Season 2 - Episode 10)\n\nStealing Rodin: A theft of a Rodin sculpture from an exhibit in Santiago turns out to be something more complicated - a stunt coordinated by an art student that prompts a public debate.\n\nAlfred Sisley (1839-1899)\n\nThis English artist spent most of his life in France. Sisley painted almost exclusively landscapes, and is known in particular for his light palette and expressive skies. He often painted alongside his Impressionist friends Monet and Renoir, but his work never found the success during his lifetime that his compatriots did.\n\nPaintings of the World (Episode 4)\n\nJoaquín Sorolla (1863-1923)\n\nSorolla, a Spanish Impressionist who preferred to work en plein air, is known for his brightly sunlit scenes. His most famous painting, \"Sad Inheritance\", is known for being perhaps the first artistic portrayal of polio victims. Sorolla's 227 foot long mural called \"The Provinces of Spain\" took 8 years to paint for the Hispanic Society of America building in New York City, and can still be seen there today. Sorolla's former studio in Madrid is now preserved and open to the public as a museum.\n\nSorolla, Journeys of Light\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Latrec (1864-1901)\n\nThe work of this French post-impressionist painter, caricaturist, and illustrator is considered almost synonymous with Paris today. Toulouse-Latrec's iconic posters featuring the Moulin Rouge and other Paris themes are sold to tourists at numerous bouqiniste stalls along the Seine in Paris. A health problem that shortened his legs, his frequenting of brothels and cabarets, and his severe alcoholism have made Toulouse-Latrec a figure of pop culture fascination in movies like Moulin Rouge. The Musee de Toulouse-Latrec in Albi, France was founded by the artist's parents and holds the world's largest publicly viewable collection of his work.\n\nThe Impressionists with Tim Marlow (Episode 5)\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 8 - Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec:\"La Toilette\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 9 - Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec:\"Seated Dancer in Pink Tights\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 10 - Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec:\"The Laundress\")\n\nToulouse-Lautrec\n\nMoulin Rouge [Drama]\n\nVincent Van Gogh (1853-1890)\n\nThis Dutch post-Impressionist was never a success in his own lifetime, but today is one of the world's most famous artists. Van Gogh's frequently shifting style was known for his use of color and bold brushstrokes. He frequently painted self-portraits. Van Gogh's life has entered pop culture as the archetype of the \"tortured artist\" due to his battle with mental illness (including cutting off his own ear), and early death from suicide. Several movies have been made of his life along with a famous episode of the BBC television show Dr. Who. The world's largest collection of Van Gogh's work - including his famous \"Sunflowers\" and early masterpiece \"The Potato Eaters\" - can be seen at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Impressionists with Tim Marlow (Episode 8)\n\nThe Painting Life of Vincent van Gogh\n\nBrushstrokes: Every Picture Tells A Story (Season 1 - Episode 2 - Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear by Vincent Van Gogh)\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 4 - Vincent Van Gogh:\"The Starry Night\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 5 - Vincent Van Gogh:\"Bedroom in Arles\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 6 - Vincent Van Gogh:\"Cafe Terrace at Night\")\n\nReArt: Impressionism (Episode 7 - Vincent van Gogh:\"Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers\")\n\nExhibition on Screen (Season 2 - Episode 4 - Van Gogh)\n\nBiography (Season 2 - Episode 9 - Van Gogh)\n\nDr Who (Season 501 - Episode 10 - Vincent and the Doctor)\n\nVincent & Theo [Drama]\n\nVincent [Drama]\n\nJames Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834-1903)\n\nWhistler is an American post-Impressionist who worked in Paris and London alongside the Impressionists in the latter half of the 19th century. He's known for naming his paintings using musical terms (such as symphony or nocturne). Whistler's most famous painting is \"Arrangement in Gray and Black No.1\" - better known as \"Whistler's Mother\" - can be seen at the Musée D'Orsay in Paris.\n\nGreat Artists with Tim Marlow (Season 2 - Episode 9)\n\nJames McNeill Whistler and the Case for Beauty\n\nDon't miss the other parts of this four part series on learning art history with Amazon Prime Video:\n\nPart One: Learning European Art History for Free with Amazon Prime Video\n\nPart Two: Learning Pre-1850 European Art History Free with Amazon Prime Video\n\nPart Four: Learning Modern & Postmodern Art History Free with Amazon Prime Video"
