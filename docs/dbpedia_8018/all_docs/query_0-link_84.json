        "text": "Question from JayC.\n\nI think this is my biggest problem. Greens in nature are so varied, but I rarely stumble upon good combinations for getting the warm greens, the cool greens, the very bright greens of spring, the grey greens, etc. Any tips would be appreciated!\n\nFeedback from Vladimir London, Drawing Academy Tutor\n\nIvan Ivanovich Shishkin – Album\n\nLandscape paintings by Ivan Ivanovich Shishkin.\n\nRight-click and choose “Save Link As” to save this Album.\n\nDownload Album »\n\nDear Jay C.,\n\nMany thanks for your question. You have raised a very important topic – mixing colors to achieve desired hues and tints.\n\nI have to say that the most natural way is to “stumble upon” a good mixture. Mixing colors is a very intuitive method, using trial and error more than educated guesses and experience.\n\nIf you are serious about painting, then learning the colors of materials is essential. I would suggest reading a good book or two on color pigments, binding media, varnishes, and other art materials. You can also consult the information provided by paint manufacturers. This technical info can be rather boring, but it is invaluable for understanding various painting materials and will help you avoid numerous mistakes in mixing paints and various other techniques.\n\nGreat art comes from a talent that is based on the artist’s skills, knowledge, experience, and creativity; it does not depend on paint manufacturers. So, the question of what green colors you should use is the secondary to how you can use those paints.\n\nThere are two opposite points of view among fine artists concerning greens. One view advocates a very limited color palette, while another argues for using a wide variety of paints in one’s artwork.\n\nLet’s start with the Old Masters. Many of them used very few paints to create masterpieces that mesmerize viewers even today. Their restricted palette reflected a limited number of pigments available at that period.\n\nIn last 150 years, however, chemists and paint manufacturers have created a huge variety of colors. That doesn’t mean that you have to buy everything that comes out of the paint factory doors, though!\n\nMany fine artists use one or two green paints, for example Sap Green or Olive Green, and get all other greens by mixing in blue and yellow paints. Yellowish and bluish hues are achieved with different proportions of blue and yellow pigments in a mix. You can experiment with mixing, for example French Ultramarine with Lemon Yellow, ochre, or other yellows. Adding a bit of other colors will the change hue as required. It gives an infinite variety of green shades, all that you would ever need.\n\nOn the other hand, there are artists who go for a wider palette of ready-made green paints.\n\nWhen talking about painting greens from nature, one fine artist above all comes to mind, a Russian landscape painter of the 19th century – Ivan Ivanovich Shishkin (1832-1898).\n\nHe used an extensive range of green paints, such as Permanent Green, Veronese Green, Cobalt Green, Chrome Green, Cinnabar Green, Green Earth, Emerald Green, etc.\n\nShishkin also used various mixes of yellow and blue colors to achieve an even wider variety of greens.\n\nHis yellow pigments included Ochres, Cadmiums, Zink Yellow, Terre de Sienna, Indian Yellow (for glazing), and his blue pigments included Cobalt Blue, French Ultramarine, Bleu de Ciel pigment, Prussian Blue, and Parisian Blue.\n\nSometimes Shishkin would add black paints into green mixes. His blacks included Ivory Black and Lamp Black.\n\nBelow, you will see some of Ivan Shishkin’s landscapes.\n\nThe main topics of Shishkin’s art are Russian forests, fields and meadows. His favorite time of year was summer, and he would often paint en plein air.\n\nNo artist in Russia before Shishkin studied nature from life as much and in such detail as he did, making countless sketches in oil and many long-term paintings.\n\nShishkin created his art in a critical, realistic manner, depicting nature in all its glory. He painted naturalistic landscapes, treating them with the love, respect, and attention they deserved.\n\nKind regards,\n\nVladimir London\n\nDrawing Academy Founder and Tutor\n\nAsk Your Art Questions here »\n\nEnroll in the Drawing Academy Course:"
