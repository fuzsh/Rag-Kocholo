        "text": "Shishkin perfected his skills outside of the Academy, in the picturesque places of Petersburg suburbs.\n\nIn 1860 Shishkin received an important award â€“ a gold medal of the Academy. Before that he had won a number of other, less important awards. Having an opportunity to travel, Shishkin went to Germany, Munich. Then he moved to Switzerland, Zurich. Everywhere Shishkin studied in workshops of famous artists. His painting View in Vicinities of Dusseldorf gained him the rank of an academician.\n\nIn 1866 Shishkin returned to Petersburg. While traveling around Russia, Shishkin then presented his canvasses at various exhibitions. He painted numerous scenes of pine wood that made him so famous. Besides, the artist showed his works at the travelling exhibitions of the Itinerants (Peredvizhniki). In 1873 he got the rank of a professor in the Academy of Arts and for some time headed a students' workshop.\n\nHe suddenly died in Petersburg on March, 8th (20) 1898, while working on a new painting at an easel.\n\nIn Elabuga (Tatarstan) there is a monument to Shishkin and Shishkin Memorial House Museum near Shishkin Ponds. A street and Children's art school 1 are named after Shishkin."
