The Petersburg Cooperative of Artists was founded in 1863 by fourteen former students. By 1870 it had become the Peredvizhniki (The Itinerants). The group championed the poor, the rural peasants and the beauty of the Russian landscape. They espoused the importance of bringing social and moral responsibility into their artworks by representing the tough everyday life in the countryside under the Czarist system rather than by painting the traditional subjects in the traditional styles of the academy. Their paintings reflected the contradictions of Russian society at the time at a time when free expression was not allowed.\n\nThe style of their paintings is often more natural and with a lighter palette. Several painted en plein air. A few were influenced by the beginnings of Impressionism which they saw when traveling to France. An important tenet of the association was to bring art to the people of the provinces living outside of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The society did not take state support. They did work to attract new buyers in order to have a market for the new art. They organized forty-eight exhibitions which traveled to smaller cities throughout the countryside after showing in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The final exhibition of the group was held in 1923 at which point many of the members of the Itinerants went on to join the Association of Artists in Revolutionary Russia.\n\nRussian art critic Vladimir Stasov wrote: \"The artists striving to unite to setup their own society were not doing it for the purpose of creating beautiful paintings and statues for the sole purpose of earning money. They were striving to create something for the minds and feelings of the people.\"\n\nHere are some of some of our favorite paintings by the members of the Itinerants.\n\nAbram Arkhipov (1862 - 1930) studied at both the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture and the Saint Petersburg Imperial Academy of Arts. His work is known for its depictions of Russian peasant women in national costumes and traditional garb.

He was born into a Russian noble family. He was orphaned as a child and raised by his nurse. After studying at the Imperial Academy of Arts, Ge traveled throughout Europe and settled in Italy. In what may have been one of the first uses of a photographic reference as base for a painting, Ge used an image in his painting The Last Supper painted from a photograph taken by photographer Count Sergei Lvovich Levitsky.\n\nPortrait of a Ukrainian Boy\n\nThe Last Supper 1863\n\nOak Grove at San Terenzo 1867\n\nKārlis Hūns (1831 - 1877)\n\nHe's Going to Get It 1875\n\nNikolay Kasatkin (1859 - 1930)\n\nA Miner's Wife 1894\n\nRivals 1890\n\nAlexander Kiselyov (1838 - 1911)\n\nThe Forgotten Mill 1891\n\nIvan Kramskoi (1837 - 1887) studied at the Saint Petersburg Academy and was ultimately expelled along with others after helping to initiate the revolt against the academic art taught.

His works are called \"landscapes of mood\". He became world-famous and became the head of the Landscape Studio at the Academy where he had studied.

He attended the Saint Petersburg Imperial Academy of Arts. In 1876, on the strength of his painting Nevsky Prospekt at Night (which was lost in the second World War), he was invited to be a member of the Peredvizhniki. He is considered to be an important member of the group and was often called \"the artists' conscience\". His painting, The Stoker, was one of the first images of a worker in Russian art. He devoted a considerable amount of his painting time to portraiture, considering it a social duty to paint intellectuals, progressive writers, artists and actors. One of Yaroshenko’s most popular works is titled Life Goes On. It portrays prisoners behind the barred window of the convict wagon. He retired in 1892 as a Major General.\n\nLife is Everywhere 1888 The Stoker 1878\n\nThe Choir 1894\n\nTweet"
