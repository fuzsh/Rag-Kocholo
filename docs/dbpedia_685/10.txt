Westfield has existed as a community school for a long time and can trace its roots way back to when it was the Harpur Central School (now the Harpur Shopping Centre in Bedford) however we are excited to be entering a new season for pupils at Westfield School. Our priority has always been, and will continue to be, the provision of excellent education to the children of Queens Park and the nearby community. From September 2015 Westfield School is expanding its age range to take children from Reception onwards to Year 8. As well as taking children in Reception from September 2015 we will continue to accept children in Year 5 as they transfer from their Lower Schools.

We believe that this change will provide a high quality choice that will benefit the children, parents and community of Queens Park and beyond. From 2015 this change will provide 30 places in Reception and the usual one hundred places in Year’s 5 to 8.

Our curriculum is rigorous, but fun. Our ethos is caring, but challenging. Our aim is to be totally inclusive and international, with educational standards second to none. We strive hard to achieve this on behalf of your child and your family. We know that, ‘Every Child Matters’ and we are outstanding in this area of work. However, having celebrated our continued success, we’ve already embarked on the next part of our journey into the future. We’re hoping that you’ll ‘start your journey with us’. To find out more why not come along to one of our open mornings? (See the diary pages for more details)

The adults and young people who work alongside us come from many walks of life locally, nationally and internationally. Westfield is the school that brings communities together.

That’s the Westfield Way!

You are warmly invited to visit us.

With best wishes from us all.
