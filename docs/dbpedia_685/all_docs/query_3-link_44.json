        "text": "England's worst secondary schools have been revealed - as official figures show more than 380 failed to meet the Government's minimum standards last year.\n\nThe figures, released by the Department for Education today and analysed by Mirror Online, suggest 382 state-funded mainstream schools are under-performing.\n\nThey are based on how teenagers at each of the country's secondary schools performed in their GCSE exams in 2018, taking into account progress not attainment.\n\nData based on A-Levels was also due to be released.\n\nIn total, there are 3,297 state-funded mainstream schools and academies across England that are subject to the Government's floor standard.\n\nIn 2017, 365 education centres were found to have failed to meet the standard.\n\nHowever, the figures are not directly comparable because the latest data does not apply to University Technical Colleges (UTCSs) or further education colleges with 14-16 provision or studio schools.\n\nSchools fall below the performance threshold if pupils fail to make enough progress across eight subjects - with particular weight given to English and maths.\n\nIs your child's school on the 2018 list? You can find out below (or use our exclusive search tool to discover the school's GCSE performance)...\n\nRevealed: England's under-performing secondary schools\n\nThe below list is based on how teens performed in their GCSE exams.

in both English and maths has increased, from 42.6 per cent to 43.3 per cent.\n\nAnd they reveal that 95.5 per cent of pupils are now entering EBacc science at GCSE, up from 63.2 per cent in 2010.\n\nAt A-Level, the number of pupils taking maths and science was found to have increased, including a rise of around 7 per cent in the number of girls taking at least one of these subjects.\n\nMeanwhile, the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and others increased slightly, rising by 0.6 per cent between 2017 and 2018.\n\nSchool Standards Minister Nick Gibb said today: \"Making sure that all pupils, regardless of their background, are able to fulfil their potential is one of this Government's key priorities and these results show that more pupils across the country are doing just that.\n\n\"It's been clear for some time that standards are rising in our schools and today's data underlines the role academies and free schools are playing in that improvement, with progress above the national average and impressive outcomes for disadvantaged pupils.\n\n\"Also vital to rising standards is the increasing number of pupils entering the EBacc.\n\n\"With a record number of disadvantaged pupils achieving good grades in the EBacc, more pupils will go on to further and higher education with a wider range of options and opportunities.\"\n\nAnd... England's worst primary schools\n\nLast month, England's worst primary schools were revealed in official documents from the DfE.\n\nThe figures showed 364 state-funded mainstream primary schools did not meet the government's floor standard for performance in 2017/18.\n\nBelow is a summary, by region, of these schools. The list is ranked in descending order of percentage of under-performing schools.\n\nThe information reads, from left to right: the region, the number of under-performing schools, the number of pupils at these schools, and the percentage of total schools in region that are under-performing.\n\nEast of England: 60; 14,462; 4.0%\n\nEast Midlands: 47; 9,026; 3.7%\n\nSouth-west England: 49; 11,594;
