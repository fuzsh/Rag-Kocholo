        "text": "Summary:\n\nWestfield Middle School is a public middle school located in Westfield, Indiana, serving grades 7-8 with a total enrollment of 1,429 students. The school is part of the Westfield-Washington Schools district, which is ranked 9th out of 381 districts in Indiana and has a 5-star rating from SchoolDigger. Westfield Middle School has consistently maintained a 5-star rating from SchoolDigger over the past several years, ranking among the top middle schools in the state.\n\nWestfield Middle School's strong academic performance is a key differentiator, with students consistently outperforming the state average in ILEARN English Language Arts and Math assessments. In the 2023-2024 school year, 61.94% of 8th-grade students were proficient or better in ELA, compared to the state average of 42.6%. In Math, 62.38% of 8th-grade students were proficient or better, compared to the state average of 31.4%. However, the school's relatively homogeneous student population, with 76.21% of students identifying as White, is in contrast to the more diverse student bodies of some nearby schools, such as Fishers Junior High School and Riverside Intermediate School.\n\nWhile Westfield Middle School's chronic absenteeism rate is still lower than the state average, the gradual increase from 10.0% in 2020-2021 to 13.3% in 2022-2023 is a trend the school should monitor and address. Additionally, the school's relatively low percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch, at 18.4% in the 2022-2023 school year, is lower than the rates seen in some nearby schools, such as Sheridan Middle School and Noblesville East Middle School. Overall, Westfield Middle School's strong academic performance, efficient use of resources, and consistent high ratings make it a standout institution in the region.\n\nDetail:"
