        "text": "Schools in Bedford\n\nBedford, a historic English market town in Bedfordshire, offers a unique blend of rich heritage and contemporary appeal. With a vibrant multicultural population, Bedford features quirky attractions, museums, and a diverse range of restaurants. As a county town and the center of a significant rural area, Bedford boasts a distinct historical legacy, dating back to its founding at a ford on the River Great Ouse. The town has served as a hub for trading, notably wool, since the Middle Ages. In the 20th century, its population doubled, bringing improvements in living conditions, infrastructure, and local culture. Today, Bedford is known for its Italian influence and houses several golf courses, as well as various institutions for arts, culture, and education.\n\nClick on a school below to see ofsted ratings, exam results and more.\n\nSecondary Schools\n\nCastle Newnham School\n\nBiddenham International School and Sports College\n\nRidgeway School\n\nCambian Walnut Tree Lodge School\n\nBedford Academy\n\nKWS School\n\nSharnbrook Academy\n\nLincroft Academy\n\nGoldington Academy\n\nRedborne Upper School and Community College\n\nWoodland Middle School Academy\n\nArnold Academy\n\nAlameda Middle School\n\nSt John's School\n\nWootton Upper School\n\nDaubeney Academy\n\nBedford Free School\n\nHolywell School\n\nMark Rutherford School\n\nGrange Academy\n\nSt Thomas More Catholic School\n\nKempston Academy\n\nWixams Academy\n\nMarston Vale Middle School\n\nPrimary Schools\n\nLivingstone Primary School\n\nEdith Cavell Primary School\n\nCastle Newnham School\n\nPriory Primary School\n\nSheerhatch Primary School\n\nCotton End Forest School\n\nPinchmill Primary School\n\nFlitwick Lower School\n\nHaynes Lower School\n\nHoughton Conquest Lower School\n\nCamestone School\n\nBalliol Primary School\n\nThomas Johnson Lower School\n\nMaulden Lower School\n\nMoggerhanger Primary School\n\nRidgmont Lower School\n\nBroadmead Lower School\n\nThurleigh Primary School\n\nTurvey Primary School\n\nWilstead Primary School\n\nWootton Lower School\n\nKing's Oak Primary School\n\nBrickhill Primary School\n\nHazeldene School\n\nKingsmoor Lower School\n\nScott Primary School\n\nTemplefield Lower School\n\nKymbrook Primary School\n\nRenhold VC Primary School\n\nSilsoe CofE VC Lower School\n\nCarlton CofE Primary School\n\nBromham CofE Primary School\n\nMilton Ernest CofE Primary School\n\nJohn Donne Church of England Primary School\n\nRiseley CofE Primary School\n\nWilden CofE VA Primary School\n\nWestfield Primary School\n\nPolam School\n\nNewton Blossomville Church of England School\n\nOrchard School & Nursery\n\nLakeview School\n\nGreat Denham Primary School\n\nQueen's Park Academy\n\nPulloxhill Lower School\n\nThe Firs Lower School\n\nCranfield Church of England Academy\n\nSharnbrook Primary\n\nSt John Rigby Catholic Primary School\n\nPutnoe Primary School\n\nThe Hills Academy\n\nGoldington Green Academy\n\nSt Joseph's and St Gregory's Catholic Primary School and Nursery\n\nUrsula Taylor Church of England School\n\nGravenhurst Academy\n\nHarrold Primary Academy\n\nOakley Primary Academy\n\nGreat Barford Church of England Primary Academy\n\nWixams Tree Primary School\n\nElstow School\n\nCauldwell School\n\nShackleton Primary School\n\nShortstown Primary School\n\nGreat Ouse Primary Academy\n\nSpringfield Primary School\n\nRoxton Church of England Academy\n\nRamsey Manor Lower School\n\nWestoning Lower School\n\nRavensden CofE Primary Academy\n\nSt James' CofE Academy"
