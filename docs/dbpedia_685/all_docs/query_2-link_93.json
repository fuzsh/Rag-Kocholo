And I look forward to learning and sharing with my peers so we can embrace our differences and celebrate what makes us unique.\"\n\nCongratulations to North Ogden Jr. High teacher, Tiffany Ross!\n\nTiffany was named Middle School Teacher of the Year in the early career category at the February UCTE Conference.
