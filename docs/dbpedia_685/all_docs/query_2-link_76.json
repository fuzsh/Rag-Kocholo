        "text": "Westfield Washington Schools have cleared another hurdle in their plans for expansion after the Westfield City Council Monday approved a new development area for the district.\n\nThe council's action allows the district to take 96.5 acres on the cityâ€™s western edge and use it to build schools.\n\nCity Council members unanimously supported the ordinance, which changed property use in an area previously zoned for retail and multi-family homes.\n\nNow, the school district can move forward with plans to build a second middle school, and if needed an elementary school on land at the northeast corner of Centennial Road and State Road 32.\n\nMore:Westfield Washington is outgrowing its schools; the district has a plan to fix that\n\nEarlier this year, Westfield Washington Schools unveiled a plan to address rapid growth in the city as more families join the district.\n\nUnder the \"Destination Westfield\" timeline, construction on the second middle school will begin in the fall.\n\nIn a statement, Brian Tomamichel, assistant superintendent and chief financial officer for the school district, said the district is excited to move into the next stage of expansion plans.\n\n\"We take the unanimous vote as a sign of confidence in our vision to continue providing an excellent academic and extracurricular experience to all Rocks as we continue to establish ourselves as the state's top destination community,\" Tomamichel said.\n\nThe district's concept plan shows mockups of school buildings, parking lots and athletics fields.\n\nDuring the city council meeting, councilmember Scott Willis expressed support for the project but added he has concerns about what expanding to the city's western edge might mean for the city.\n\n\"This is going really far west that our comprehensive plan does not address,\" Willis said.\n\nMore:Westfield Washington Schools eyes parcel of land for future middle school\n\nWillis added that he wants city planners to be mindful about how to move forward as more homes are built on the western edge of Westfield.\n\nOther members said they supported the plan.\n\n\"I'm personally pretty excited to see this project and the school located where it is here,\" Westfield City Council President Mike Johns said. \"I think we all need to keep in mind and remember that this specific piece of land had been rezoned in the past many years ago ... we are a growing community, we need schools. I'm delighted to see the Westfield Washington schools taking this step forward.\"\n\nRachel Fradette is a suburban education reporter at IndyStar.
