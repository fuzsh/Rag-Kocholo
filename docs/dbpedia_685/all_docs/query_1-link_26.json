        "text": "This school is awful. I dread getting up every morning having to go to this prison. Children run down the halls screaming slurs. Student think they’re “edgy” or “cool” for saying Slurs and bullying each other. There is no orchestra or strings except 1 cellist. The teachers don’t give anywhere near enough time to work in class, the bell schedule is horrendous, I have get from my bus, to my locker, to algebra in 10 minutes, more accurately 9 minutes which might not sound so bad, but I have lower back, hip, knee, and ankle issues which make it painful to walk, run, and stand. The school focuses too much on athletics, we have 2 huge gyms, a weight room, a “stage area” which is essentially just another gym, and a wrestling room. The athletic areas take up 1/5 of the already massive school. This school is horrendous and treats students horribly. Never send your child here unless you want them to hate existing. This school makes me hate learning, never go here."
