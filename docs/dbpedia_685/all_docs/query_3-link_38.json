        "text": "Westfield State senior track and field athlete Travon Godette is capping his career in fine style. Having graduated on Saturday with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, he hopped on a plane to Iowa Tuesday to leave for the NCAA Division III Championships, where he will defend his national title in the javelin. Godette has maximized his experience as a student-athlete, and heading a list of honors he has been named as the 2015-16 Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference Male Scholar-Athlete of the Year.\n\nThe Scholar-Athlete of the Year is selected by a vote of the MASCAC athletic directors, and is based on athletic, academic and community service accomplishments.\n\nGodette's last 12 months have been a whirlwind of honors, achievement and accolades, including:\n\nMASCAC Male Scholar-Athlete of the Year\n\nNCAA Division III National Champion in the Javelin\n\nUSTFCCCA National Scholar Athlete of the Year\n\nWestfield State's Coach John Kurty Award for Service to Athletics\n\nNamed to the MASCAC Sportsmanship Team for the indoor and outdoor seasons\n\nPresidential Leadership Award Winner at Westfield State\n\nNamed as an Arthur Ashe Scholar\n\nNamed to the Governor's \"29 Who Shine\" honor roll\n\nSet the Westfield State University javelin, high jump and decathlon records and won MASCAC titles in javelin and indoor and outdoor high jump\n\nWon the decathlon and the javelin at the New England Division III championships and was named the Sebasteanski Award Winner as the Field Events MVP\n\nGodette has also driven himself to a 3.41 grade point average and incredible heights in athletic competition as well.\n\nGodette has had a strong senior season, winning the MASCAC high jump title both indoors and outdoors, and winning the MASCAC and New England titles in the javelin, in a season which he has thrown sparingly to nurse his shoulder through to this week's NCAA meet.\n\n\"Athletically, he's a freak of nature,\" said Owls head coach Sean O'Brien. \"To be among the best in the country in both the javelin and the high jump is just remarkable. He was a good athlete in high school, but he really took off, especially this year. He put in the effort over four years and got better each year, and that doesn't always happen.\"\n\n\"He's very coachable,\" added O'Brien. \"He has input and makes suggestions on his training, and was willing to try different things to get better. He doesn't just jump and throw, he can break down the events and understand why he practices what he does to improve.\"\n\nGodette has done an outstanding job balancing college athletics with being a college student.\n\n\"I see them building off one another,\" said Godette. \"[Westfield State athletic director] Dick Lenfest always says that athletics are not 'extra-curricular' - they are 'extra curriculum.' The same sense of self-discipline and teamwork, you use those in a classroom as well. You have to be a teammate in a classroom and help everyone learn to the best of their ability. If you use that in both athletics and academics, that's how you ensure success.\"\n\n\"I started out having an interest in music, and jazz, but when I came here most of my friends were English majors,\" said Godette. \"My past teachers who helped me work towards honor roll in high school were all English teachers who stepped in and told me I could do so much more and taught me a bunch of life lessons. I looked back and saw that my best role models in life were English majors.\"\n\n\"I found a passion to read and write and I want to be that type of teacher for someone else, use my passion for reading and writing and be able to influence students who might not care about home work in high school, or may not know what direction they want to take in life. I thought I could be that kind of person for someone else.\"\n\n\"One of my biggest influences would be Sophia Sarigianides, who was the faculty member who came with me to '29 Who Shine' with me as a mentor,\" added Godette. \"She taught me how to manage an English classroom; talked about matters of race; how to make literature applicable to everybody, whether culturally, or who they are economically, individually. Through her I realized why school ended up being such an important aspect of my life. It's important to make high school a safe environment for students. You have range to teach different aspects of life and community values, and that's something that she reinforces in her classroom - looking at each other as equals and making it a safe environment for students talk and she asserts her passions to teach and learn.\"\n\n\"Figuring out how to connect deeply with the curriculum you are going to teach, that's the dream,\" said Sarigianides. \"That's what our students need to do to 'sell' English to their future students. That's what Travon did, and what he does, and he is so collegial and works so well across his classes.\"\n\n\"Travon is very disciplined and very prepared for classes,\" said Saragianides. \"That has to be a connection to his athletics success. He's ready to produce and committed to whatever he is doing. It was a pleasure to be there and see him on stage at the '29 Who Shine' event and to see who he is on a par with in the Commonwealth.\"\n\n\"In receiving any award I can only think back to the people who influenced me to where I am today, both good and bad,\" said Godette. \"It's all about, no matter what you do, giving back. If I get an award, it reflects back out of humility and out of my responsibility to everyone who helped me to get here, so rightfully the award is 'ours,' and that's something I try to live by.\"\n\n\"In one of my classes he wasn't identifying with what he was presenting on the role of grammar in teaching English,\" said Sarigianides. \"And he wrote a poem about grammar - and that really unhitched his love of creative writing, and cemented his ideas about teaching and creative writing.\"\n\n\"I put an emphasis on the role of race in teaching English. Knowing that Travon was the only black student in the class, I had my eye on him during the discussions,\" said Sarigianides. \"He let the impact of the discussion show on him, while also remaining very involved and talking back to what is going on in schools. I think we were all better students and critics of race and English teaching because of his presence and involvement in class.\"\n\nHis leadership and presence in the classroom carried over into his role as a team captain for the Owls track and field team, where he helped set goals to win the MASCAC and the New England Alliance, both goals that his team reached.\n\n\"I think I grew as a leader, just as much as the team grew as athletes and campus community members,\" said Godette. \"I try to put myself back in my own shoes, and I thought about when I was a freshman and in high school. I didn't really lift and put in too much effort, I just did what I did because I was decent and didn't have to work.\"\n\n\"So [this season] I would do my best to be a role model, make sure I was first one in the weight room, the last one out of the weight room. I wouldn't talk back to coaches or other upper classmen publically to show respect and hope that would be emulated,\" he said.\n\n\"Setting high expectations at the beginning of the year and giving something to work towards and be passionate about, I saw a big improvement in our team from when everyone came in, and people would skip practice or miss lifts, and now you have freshmen running incredible times, you have so many distance runners performing and hurdlers peaking at the end of the year.\"\n\n\"It's awesome to see how supportive everyone is of each other,\" said Godette. \"Through all the success that we've had, I have taken note that this is the closest team that we have had in my four years here. That's a testament to us working together towards common goals as a family.\"\n\n\"He's pretty smart,\" said O'Brien mordantly. \"A lot smarter than I am.\"\n\n\"He rallies the troops and leads by example. He wasn't afraid to put people in their place when the time came to do it. He wanted to do well as a team, and not just as an individual. He set goals of winning the MASCAC, and the New England Alliance, and to do well at the New England Division III meet and he accomplished all of them.\"\n\nWhat has Godette's overall experience been at Westfield State?\n\n\"If I had to put it down to one word it would be unexpected,\" said Godette. \"I applied to about eight schools, and despite only about a 2.7 student coming out of high school, I got into all of them. Westfield was the school that EVERYONE goes to from my high school other kids were going to Nebraska, Tampa, and I was a little let down to stay in Western Mass. Once I got here I didn't want to change it at all. I met so many great friends and you can't really argue with the academic success I had here that I probably wouldn't have had anywhere else.\"\n\n\"At the end of my freshman year, I had a 3.06 GPA, but I learned more organizational skills. I had been diagnosed ADHD in middle school but I don't take any medicines, and when I study I may keep five assignments open in front of me and I go from one to another when my mind wanders. I learned ways around it. Once I knew what I really wanted to do I knew I could put all my effort into it and nothing would go to waste.\"\n\nPersonally, academically, and athletically, Godette has experienced tremendous highs and lows over his four years with the Owls.\n\n\"The coaches all have their own personalities and it makes for a strong coaching base,\" said Godette. \"Coach O.B. (Head coach Sean O'Brien) is sarcastic and funny, but he always pushes you like a father figure. You work towards those very few moments when he will give you a 'good job' a pat on the back. You don't doubt that he cares because of how much he's here or how early he comes in to do double sessions - but it's a little bit of tough love that makes you want to work hard.\"\n\n\"Probably the pit of my career was my freshman year. My stepfather was in a car accident and was comatose, and I had a rough time academically and athletically. I wasn't keeping up with my responsibilities. There was one day where I don't think I had slept in two nights, and I had missed practice. I walk in to the office and O.B. says 'wow, you look like crap' . . . and then he told me to not worry about practice and to go get some rest.\"\n\n\"I had been scared because you don't usually see that sympathy from O.B. and I was disappointed not to practice, but in that low I realized how much he does care about us as athletes and individuals. That was huge for me because it came at such a tough point in my life,\" said Godette. \"I realized track has always been one of the most important things in my life that has always been there, and knowing that I could count on those individuals to have my back.\"\n\n\"[Throws] Coach [Junior] Williams always has something different for me to learn. I'll come in to practice and I'll say that I think I've just figured out the last thing he has taught me, and he will say 'that's great because I have a new drill for you.' There's never a moment of being stagnant in your progression.\"\n\n\"Coach Devine is always happy, always enthusiastic. Even when you want to be negative, he's optimistic to the point where it's contagious. He makes sure there is a smile on your face and has a way of ensuring you of your value. And Coach (Jason) Weber is the liaison for a lot of the athletes. If you're having trouble communicating, as the youngest on the staff he helps bridge the communication gap. I think the staff is one of a kind and has been effective throughout my career,\" said Godette.\n\n\"You would think the high point would be winning nationals, but it actually came the year before when I came in third as a sophomore,\" said Godette. \"It was my first time at a really big meet. I had never been to nationals in high school, mostly because I didn't work as hard. But being in that atmosphere with thousands of people, who you know all the top athletes and seeing what else was out there, that motivated me to be become better the next year.\n\n\"It was also a fun experience, being there with coach O.B. and coach Williams. It was a different setting being outside of school, you see them as coaches every day, but in that setting its more as equals and while I was excited to be there, and they were excited to see how much I appreciated it. It really solidified me wanting to coach in the future because you live through the experiences of your athletes, and you see their eyes light up and want to be part of it.\"\n\nGodette has been accepted to a graduate program at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana and plans to pursue a MFA in creative writing and a MA in literature.\n\n\"That will help me whether I want to become a college professor or a high school English teacher,\" said Godette. \"I'm planning to volunteer with the track and field team [former Westfield State assistant coach Vijay Saxena is part of the coaching staff at McNeese] and will work with freshman composition students in the reading and writing center.\n\n\"It's definitely an interesting step in the right direction, it's the next level for everything I want to do,\" said Godette with a smile. \"I'm looking forward to the food, and culturally it is close to Houston, Dallas, Tampa, New Orleans, and I have read about authors who are from all those areas. I will be nerding out while I am there.\"\n\n-- story by Dave Caspole, Associate A.D."
