        "text": "Public school in Westfield, Indiana, United States\n\nWestfield High School is a public high school located in Westfield, Indiana, north of Indianapolis. Westfield High School is part of the Westfield Washington School District and is commonly abbreviated as \"WHS.\"\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe shamrock was chosen to represent the school's athletic teams due to the significant population of Quakers living in the community who preferred a nonviolent mascot.[citation needed] From 1968, up until 1997, the school was on the south side of Hoover Street. The former high school is still standing, and forms the west end of Westfield Middle School. Before the old high school was built, WHS was located by S.R. 32, east of U.S. 31. This school at one time served grades Kindergarten and 7-12. In 1970, the auditorium and gymnasium were burnt down. [citation needed] The school still served as the junior high, although there was no auditorium or gym. A new middle school was built in 1976. In the fall of 1997, the school relocated to its current location at the intersection of Hoover and Union Streets, just north of the old school.\n\nIn 2014, Riverview Health agreed to pay $1.5 million over 10 years for the naming rights to Westfield High School's football stadium.[2]\n\nOn August 21, 2015, Westfield High School officially opened its new $7.5 million stadium to the public for their first home game, which they won 38-21 against Harrison.[3]\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nWestfield athletic teams, nicknamed the Shamrocks, compete in the Hoosier Crossroads Conference.

Westfield Boys' golf has also won three state championships in 2013, 2015 and 2016. After two prior trips to the state finals in football (2A in '92 and 5A in '13) the Rocks won their first State Championship in class 5A football during the '16-'17 season.
