Having almost an equal mix of male and female students, they have 49.3% girls and 50.7% boys. Parents are encouraged to help the school ensure pupils are regularly attending school. With a 94.1% attendance rate, the attendance is below national average. The school has 26.7 members of staff, which far exceeds the average. They have a very low (pupil to teacher) ratio, which permits the teacher to give more focused attention in a smaller class size. With an average salary of only Â£30516 , the wages of the teachers at Queen's Park Academy are very far below the nations average. This School has an extremely small number of pupils who speak English as their 1st language, with only 11.1% of them doing so.\n\nAbout Ofsted\n\nOfsted have been inspecting schools on a regular basis since 2005. After a cursory warning period they undertake a thorough examination of the whole school. Inspectors will sit in on classes, assessing each teacher's teaching ability. They will also evaluate the way the current curriculum is implemented, and how the progress of each student is tracked throughout their tenure.\n\nEach school is graded on a four point scale: 1 being outstanding, 2 being good, 3 means they require improvement, and 4 signifying inadequate. Those schools attaining an outstanding or good grade might not be re-inspected for as long as five years; while those receiving lower grades will be reassessed with greater frequency, with little or no notice prior to the inspectors arriving."
