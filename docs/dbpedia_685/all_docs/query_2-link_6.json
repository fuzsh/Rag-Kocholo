        "text": "Learning: 1/5I dread going getting up every morning because of this school. I have never felt so overwhelmed with homework before. Teachers give us an absolutely absurd amount of homework, and they give us very little time to do our work in class which adds to the large amounts of homework. The way we are taught is tedious and boring, this school makes it seem like they are creating an engaging learning environment, but that’s all false. This school makes me want to never get out of my bed. I am filled with dread every time I wake up and hope it’s all some sort of horrible nightmare.Teaching: 2/5In my personal experience, teachers at this school genuinely seem like they want to help students, but I feel like they just don’t end up helping. My teachers are always there to help me and my peers, but only during SRT, and not on Mondays. Teachers are unable to fully help students.Social-emotional support: 4/5 They staff are often available to help students, and teachers will often try make sure students are supported and safe.Special education: 3/5I am not a special ed student and thus cannot be taken as a reliable source of information on this topic, but I do have lower back, hip, knee, and ankle issues and my wellness teacher has been very helpful in making sure I am able to do the activities, and if I can’t do the activity, they let me sit out.Safety:2/5 Students run down the hallways yelling slurs and profanity without any punishment. Students push and shove each other In the hallways and often call others slurs, again without punishment. Family engagement: 2/5My parents often have trouble reaching out to the school, when trying to get me placed in the advanced classes, especially algebra, I deserved after being used as a role model for classes that I was to advanced for, it was nearly impossible to get the school to respond. Overall experience: 2/5This school makes me hate Learning. I dread getting up every morning because of this school. The students are awful and some of the most annoying people you could ever have the displeasure of meeting. The students here seem to find enjoyment in saying the most offensive things ever, so much that it puts Fox News to shame. I hate learning because of this school and this schoolmates me dread waking up in the morning. I am just done. This school ruined me.— anonymous 7th grader10:59pm 11/26/23\n\nPosted by a student on 11/26/2023"
