Happy animals, very polite and helpful staff, venue was very clean and well maintained, food was tasty and all reasonably priced.\n\nThis was a real interactive and memorable day. The whole experience created laughs and memories which will last a long time. Such value for money! Would definitely recommend.\n\nLovely Safari Park, I think is the best one so far. I will definitely go again and recommend to friends.\n\nThis has to be one of the best attractions for a perfect day that is packed with so many things to do and enjoy... and, at such a great price, coupled with a free return visit. Awesome!\n\nLove it!! Plenty to do and see for all ages, clean and tidy. All staff pleasent and friendly, been going at least once a year for over 30 years and still love going.\n\nI have an annual pass so use WMSP a lot. It never fails to impress. Today we did the minibus safari tour with Clive, our tour guide and driver. He was so knowledgeable and helpful. It was a lovely experience."
