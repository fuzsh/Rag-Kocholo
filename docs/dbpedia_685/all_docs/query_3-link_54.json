Each of your pedagogy courses, as well as your practicum experience, are also supported by one or more of these pillars.\n\nCritical Engagement with Diversity: Our faculty understands that diversity means more than just acknowledging and/or tolerating difference. Critical engagement with diversity means knowing how to validate and include members of social groups that have traditionally been marginalized in education. These include, but are not limited to, differences based on race, class, gender, physical and developmental abilities, sexual orientation, religion, and gender expression. It is likely that, as a teacher, you will be responsible for educating students from an increasingly broad range of racial, economic, and language backgrounds as well as a wide and diverse range of learning needs. We begin to help you engage with diversity by inviting you to critically examine your own background and social position and to reflect upon the ways in which cultural assumptions, beliefs, and value systems may limit understandings of and interactions with students and families of different backgrounds and social positions.\n\nSocial Justice: Our faculty takes a critical approach to social justice and recognizes that society is stratified (divided and unequal) in significant and far-reaching ways along social group lines that include race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and ability. Schools play a primary role in this stratification, and thus are also a potential site for transformation. Therefore, we seek to enable our candidates: to recognize that all people are individuals, but they are also members of social groups and these social groups are valued unequally in society; to critically analyze education as a socio-political institution; to practice mutual respect and compassion for identities and experiences that are different from their own; to understand that diversity includes not only ways of being but also ways of knowing; and to build alliances across group differences so that we can work together to eradicate inequality between social groups within our classrooms and schools.\n\nReflective Practice: Our faculty believes in reflective practice as the key to continuing intellectual and professional growth. This expectation of our graduates is expressed in our learning outcomes as well as in the design of our programs and assessments. We believe that all good teaching involves a recursive process of reflective practice. Before, during, and after we teach, we ask ourselves “what are our students learning?”, “how do we know?”, and “how can we improve our assessment and instructional practices to improve learning?” At WSU, you will be required to begin and sustain a practice of reflecting on your learners, on your lessons and units, and on your classroom community as a whole. This process will carry you forward into your career as a professional teacher.\n\nCommunity Building: It is our intent that the understanding of teaching and learning of candidates in our programs is informed by the belief that all education is fundamentally and inherently socio-political, and that education must enable students to critically engage in ways that bring about a more socially just society. Classrooms are small societies where students reside for one year of their lives. Classrooms can be places where everyone feels valued, where there is excitement for learning, and where learners can safely take risks. Students need to feel both supported and challenged on a daily basis. Classrooms, conversely, can also be places where some students are ostracized, misunderstood, and in the worst cases, mistreated. Teachers are powerful and are more successful when they recognize that classrooms can be positive or negative spaces and when they seek to build a classroom community in which all learners and critical thinking are valued.\n\nScholarship, Inquiry, and an Excitement for Learning: Teaching is intellectual work. Our faculty believes that thinking deeply about ideas and experiences within and across disciplines is central to effective and dynamic teaching and learning. We expect our candidates to be continuous learners engaged in active inquiry and scholarship. We believe that effective teachers facilitate critical conversations using diverse lenses and multiple literacies. We expect our candidates to bring to their students a passion for learning, a questioning stance, and a deep understanding of powerful teaching practices. Candidates must be able to use the essential concepts of their disciplines to create a powerful, flexible curriculum that is responsive to the individual student, using diverse pedagogical approaches. It is never enough to simply love working with children to become a good teacher. At WSU, we help you learn to not only teach to the Common Core of State Standards, but to build powerful, interesting, and student-centered lessons and units of study that help students learn to think, to question, and to love learning.\n\nProgram Vision\n\nThe shared vision of the WSU Education programs is “Educators as Leaders Building Learning Communities.” This shared vision is an outgrowth of community discussions among education faculty of both initial and advanced programs, liberal arts and science faculty, candidates, P-12 teachers, and administrators. The vision represents the joining of two key concepts: leadership and learning community.\n\nLeadership: Candidates and graduates will view themselves as leaders, as advocates for children and adolescents, and as professionals who work effectively with colleagues, administrators, and parents to create a supportive and stimulating environment for learners. Also, candidates and graduates will recognize the value of scholarship and professional development as an important tool in the further development of their capacities as advocates and leaders.\n\nLearning Community. Candidates and graduates will belong to learning communities, which are vibrant social systems characterized by high levels of member dialogue and interaction, and by a shared commitment to the creation of knowledge. These learning communities will be motivated by shared goals, values, and responsibilities and will be respectful of the contributions of all community members. These learning communities will encourage the development of leadership qualities and participants who can participate effectively in collaborative settings specifically and more generally in democratic society.\n\nBased on the Leaders Building Learning Communities focus of the conceptual framework, and the subthemes of community building, social justice, reflective practice, and diversity, the WSU education community developed a series of outcomes for all the education programs to possess and that undergird the assessment system.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the program, the candidate will have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to:\n\nDescribe/explain the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of his or her discipline(s) and create learning experiences that make the aspects of any subject matter meaningful for students.\n\nDescribe and discuss how children learn and develop and provide learning opportunities or environments that support their intellectual, social, and personal development.\n\nDescribe/explain how students differ in their approaches to learning and create instructional opportunities that are adapted to diverse learners.\n\nUse a variety of instructional strategies to encourage students' development of critical thinking, problem solving, and performance skills.\n\nCreate a learning environment that encourages positive social interaction, active engagement in learning, and self-motivation.\n\nUse a variety of instructional media to foster student learning and collaboration.\n\nPlan instruction based upon knowledge of subject matter, students, the community, and curriculum goals.\n\nUse formal and informal assessment strategies to evaluate and ensure the continuous intellectual, social, and physical development of the learner.\n\nBe a reflective practitioner who continually evaluates the effects of their choices and actions on others (students, parents, and other professionals in the learning community) and who actively seeks out opportunities to grow professionally.\n\nFoster relationships with school colleagues, parents, and agencies in the larger community to support students' learning and well-being.\n\nWhat can I do with an education degree?\n\nOur education program alumni work in districts across the state in positions such as:\n\nEarly childhood educator\n\nElementary school educator\n\nHigh school educator\n\nSpecial education educator\n\nEarly education and care professional\n\nEarly intervention professional\n\nBefore/after school program professional\n\nYouth/community program professional\n\nReady to learn more?\n\nRequest Information\n\nVisit\n\nApply\n\nEducation Accelerated Dual Degree Program\n\nFast-track your teaching career!
