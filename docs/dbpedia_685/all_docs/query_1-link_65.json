        "text": "WESTFIELD — Lauren Figy Cadigan, supervisor of science, technology and engineering for grades 5-12 in Westfield, and Lindsey Ayers, STEM coach for pre-kindergarten to grade 4, have announced that Westfield Middle School and Franklin Avenue Elementary School have been recognized as 2023-24 Project Lead the Way Distinguished Schools. Project Lead the Way is a national nonprofit organization that provides a teacher-empowered STEM curriculum in computer science, engineering, and biomedical science used by Westfield schools.\n\nThe honor given to Franklin Avenue and Westfield Middle School puts them among a select number of schools across the United States providing broad access to the organization’s science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, curriculums — for Franklin Avenue through the elementary version, PLTW Launch, and for WMS through PLTW Gateway, the grade 6-8 curriculum."
