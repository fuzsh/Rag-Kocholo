        "text": "Westfield is for Aviation Lovers\n\nby Marina Brito & Maggie Altomare, Realtor®, Westfield High School Boundary Specialist\n\nThe Westfield HS boundary is located on the western part of Fairfax County, sharing its borders with Loudoun County. The Westfield boundary covers a long area, from parts of Herndon, VA to Centreville, VA.\n\nTo the West of the boundary you can find the Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center which houses the exciting Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.\n\nAbout the Westfield HS boundary\n\nWhat’s great\n\nWestfield HS is the newest high school to have opened in Fairfax County (in 2000)\n\nEasy access to major employment centers (Reston, Dulles Airport)\n\nThe amazing Air and Space Museum is just a few minutes away\n\nCommuting bus routes are convenient to the BRAND NEW Silver line of the Metro\n\nMany single family homes have large lots at County-average prices\n\nWhat you should know\n\nTraffic through Rt. 28 can be a challenge at certain times\n\nPublic transportation options are limited for non-commuters\n\nSome schools’ scores are lower than in surrounding highly-competitive boundaries\n\nWhy move here\n\nHighly-Rated Schools\n\nSilver line of the Metro (Now Open!) near the North end of the boundary\n\nPlenty of amenities available (parks, museums, golf courses)\n\nMore living space at affordable prices\n\nSchools in the Westfield High School Boundary\n\nThe Westfield boundary is the attendance area for highly-rated Westfield High School, Stone Middle School, and 7 feeder elementary schools.\n\nWestfield High School – home of the Bulldogs – is the newest high school in Fairfax County, with state-of-the-art technology and labs; and even an Aerospace Academy Pilot Program.\n\nAverage of Standard of Learning (SOL) Pass Rates (June 2012)\n\nSchool School Score Fairfax County Westfield High 91 89 Stone Middle 89 89\n\nElementary Schools\n\nCub Run Elementary 87 89 Deer Park Elementary 84 89 Floris Elementary 95 89 London Towne Elementary 86 89 Lutie Lewis Coates Elementary 83 89 McNair Elementary 93 89 Virginia Run Elementary 89 89\n\nHomes in the Westfield High School Boundary\n\nThe Westfield Boundary offers an affordable variety of options for buying a single family home (either detached or townhome).\n\nLast school year (2013-2014), over 450 homes sold within this boundary, with prices ranging from $365K to $2.9 Million. This is one of the few boundaries with affordable land – there are plenty of properties between 1 and 5 acres, with modern, large homes which have sold for around $1 Million or a little less.\n\nThere are almost an even amount of detached single family homes and townhomes available for sale; but relatively few condos. Due to its location on the Western-end of Fairfax County, home prices are consistent with the average price in Fairfax County.\n\nSOLD Home prices (School year 2013-2014)\n\nHome Type Low Average High Detached (179) $365K $609K $2.9M Townhome (235) $210K $364K $635K Condo (51) $185K $317K $410K\n\nSee all the homes for sale within this boundary\n\nFinding a home by school can be a challenge\n\nIf you have tried to find a home by school before, you have probably found that it’s a challenge to cross-reference homes for sale on a typical home search website with their assigned school.\n\nSimply finding homes “near” the school won’t do\n\nThe issue with typical home search websites is that they only display homes by city or zip code. Some of them display homes “near” the school. Well, that won’t do you any good since school boundaries span cities, zip codes, and just being “near” the school doesn’t mean that the home belongs to that boundary.\n\nYou want a home INSIDE the school boundary. Not just “near” it…\n\nThe good news is that we have put together the only interactive map where you can find homes for sale INSIDE the Westfield High School boundary. Plus, you can also see points of interest such as shopping and hospitals.
