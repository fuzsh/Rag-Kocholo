        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Col. (KRDO) – It was a bright sea of colors as students lined up and cheered for 106-year-old WWII veteran Dr. Monica Agnew-Kinnaman, giving her a special welcome as she arrived to help with a history lesson for middle school students in Colorado Springs.\n\n“Yes, I’m kind of shy really, I don’t like a lot of fuss. I feel I don’t deserve it. There are so many thousands of people who’ve done so much more than I have and deserve so much more credit,” WWII Veteran Dr. Monica Agner Kinnaman said.\n\nThe veteran was born in England and was there until two years after the war before coming to America.\n\nShe was one of the first women in history who served in the war and was proud to serve her country.\n\n“They needed everybody. You hardly ever saw a civilian. Everyone was in uniform. Everyone was pulling together,” Kinnaman said. “And it was important for the survival of our little island. It was just a small island. And we had the whole of the German forces, against us.”\n\nAfter the war ended, she continued helping those in need.\n\n“I took the abused and abandoned dogs, and then someone wanted me to raise a little wolf,” Kinnaman said. “She was only about four weeks when I got her, and she was the sweetest, gentlest animal you could ever think of. I had her till she was she died at nearly 15.”\n\nNow at 106 years old, she spends most of her days at home enjoying time with her two grown children who are 88 and 65 years old."
