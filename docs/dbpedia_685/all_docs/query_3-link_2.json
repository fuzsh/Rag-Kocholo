        "text": "Our 11+ entrance examinations take place in January of each year, for entry in the following September. We take pride in bringing out the best in all our pupils, whatever their strengths and weaknesses and aim to make the entrance process as stress-free as possible. Please contact school to discuss the examination and interview process for your daughter.\n\nChildren join in Round Square activities from Year 7 upwards and participate in these throughout their time in Senior House. For girls in Junior House there are activity camps, a summer residential for the whole of Key Stage 2 and the opportunity to apply for a place at a CISV (Children's International Summer Village) which is aimed at 11-12 year olds.\n\nThe next open day for the whole school is scheduled for Saturday 5th October 2024 from 9.30 am to 11.30 pm. If you are unable to make that date or you would like to arrange a visit before then, please telephone Mrs Jane Jokelson on 0191 255 3980.\n\nWe are happy to welcome girls to join us at any point through the school year. Our dedicated and welcoming staff will ensure that she is supported to settle in quickly and catch up on any missing work.\n\nIf you have any questions please contact the school office for further details; our experienced and friendly admissions team will guide you carefully through the process. Telephone us on 0191 255 3980 or email westfield@westfield.newcastle.sch.uk."
