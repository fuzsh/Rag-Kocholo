        "text": "Welcome to our careers website and thank you for considering WHSmith for your next career journey. As you navigate your way through the site, you will find lots of interesting facts and information about the Company. Many people in the UK still perceive our brand as a standalone high street retailer, so you may be surprised what you learn!\n\nHaving celebrated 230 years since the Company was founded in 1792, we now have over 1,700 stores across more than 30 countries around the world, with Support Centres in the UK, Las Vegas and Sydney. We have an ambitious growth strategy for the Group and the opportunities ahead are substantial as we expand our global reach and open in more travel hubs. Since becoming CEO in 2019, I have been incredibly proud of how the business has evolved and none of this would be possible without the fantastic support and commitment of our teams around the world.\n\nSo, why should you consider WHSmith? We are a nimble and entrepreneurial business, adapting at pace to the constant changes within the retail landscape. We always strive to be on the front foot and ahead of our competitors. We work hard to make WHSmith a great place to work for all our colleagues, minimising our impact on the planet, engaging our people and contributing to the communities that we have served for over 230 years.\n\nWhatâ€™s really interesting about the Group is the various different brands and businesses that sit within WHSmith and hopefully you will find a role or area of the business that could be the perfect next step on your career journey.\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider us and I hope to see you in one of our stores or Support Centres in the near future!\n\nCarl Cowling"
