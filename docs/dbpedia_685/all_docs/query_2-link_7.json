        "text": "Overall, some of the most rewarding educational years of my life so far. For the area, this middle school isn’t of a high value. The basis for all learning you’ll do in high school is well structured in this middle school. It offers a variety of optional classes, as well as principal classes. I would, however, like to see consolidation in the classes. For example, there are two separate classes for language and reading which could be put together to offer new courses."
