        "text": "Westfield elementary and middle schools were included in the inaugural list ranking more than 79,000 U.S. schools.\n\nWESTFIELD, NJ — New education rankings from U.S. News & World Report are once again showing that Westfield continues to rank among the best for K-8 schools in New Jersey.\n\nSpecifically, Roosevelt Intermediate School ranked number 8 among the top 10 public middle schools in the Garden State.\n\nThe news outlet based its 2024 Best Elementary and Middle School rankings on publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Education, focusing on student proficiency in core subject areas.\n\nHere’s a look at how other elementary schools in Westfield Public Schools ranked compared with others in the state:\n\n19: Franklin Elementary School\n\n55: Tamaques Elementary School\n\n128: Mckinley Elementary School\n\n131: Jefferson Elementary School\n\nMiddle School\n\n8: Roosevelt Intermediate School\n\n40: Thomas Edison Intermediate School\n\nWestfield Public School District has 10 schools and 5,942 students. The district’s minority enrollment is 30%. Also, 0.5% of students are eligible to participate in the federal free and reduced-price meal program and 1.0% of students are English language learners.\n\nLooking at teachers and staff, 96.7% of teachers are licensed, and 96.7% have three or more years of experience. The student-to-teacher ratio is lower than the state average, at 12:1. The district has 11 full-time counselors on staff.\n\nTest scores in Westfield Schools show that 67% of elementary students tested at or above the proficient level for reading, and 65% tested at or above that level for math. Also, 74% of middle school students tested at or above the proficient level for reading, and 60% tested at or above that level for math.\n\nThe U.S. News list includes data on more than 79,000 public elementary and middle schools nationwide.\n\nIn the analysis, U.S. News looked closely at state assessments of students who were proficient or above-proficient in mathematics and reading/language arts, while also accounting for student backgrounds, achievement in core subjects, and how well schools are educating their students. Student-teacher ratios are applied to break ties in the overall score.\n\nLaMont Jones, managing editor for education at U.S. News, said the state and district-level rankings are intended to give parents a snapshot of their child’s school and how well it’s doing within its community.\n\n\"Easily accessible data on student-teacher ratio, district spending, and the number of school counselors available at the school can keep parents informed and involved,\" Jones said.\n\nTo be included in district-level rankings, at least two of the top-performing schools must rank in the top 75 percent of the overall elementary or middle school rankings to qualify for district-level recognition.\n\n— With reporting by Patch Staff\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
