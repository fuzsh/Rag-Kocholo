        "text": "You can now access your child(ren)'s bus stop information using the credentials below. Cell phones will not return search results.\n\nClick here\n\nUser Name: guest\n\nPassword: guest\n\nSelect your child's grade from the dropdown menu\n\nEnter your address\n\nClick the button that says \"Find School/Transportation Info\"\n\nNOTE 1: Many of the recently built neighborhoods are still being added to system and might not be available now, but they will be available very soon.\n\nNOTE 2: Any bus stop change requests will be taken and implemented after Labor Day.\n\nWe are excited to announce the we are rolling out the Here Comes the Bus platform this school year! This will allow parents to track their child(ren)'s bus in real time. This service will be available at the start of the school year, however, it will be fully functional after Labor Day when all of the requested stop changes and route adjustments are fully implemented.\n\nClick the links below for download and registration information.\n\nHere Comes the Bus flyer - English\n\nHere Come the Bus flyer - Español\n\nGet the apP\n\nIn an attempt to improve the transportation experience, if your child is registered for a bus and you are dropping him/her off, we ask that you please notify our transportation department, so we can provide a more accurate roster and more efficient bus stops for all of our riders. All you have to do is email transportation@wws.k12.in.us with the subject line \"Opt Out\" and provide us with your child's name and student ID number.\n\nAll registered WWS students are in our routing system. However, if you need to send your student to a location other than your home address, you will need to make the request in writing to transportation@wws.k12.in.us. Transportation changes do not carry over, so please make a new request for the 2023-24 school year. Please allow 3-5 days to arrange transportation to permanent alternate pickups and drops offs.\n\nFor variations, please include in your email:\n\nStudent’s name, School, Grade\n\nAddress where you need your student picked up/dropped off\n\nName, relationship and phone number of person who resides at that location. Limit to 1 change, must come from custodial parent or guardian and if student is in elementary, the alternate address must be in the elementary school boundary, for which the child attends.\n\nDetails concerning pick up times (i.e. AM only, PM only etc.)\n\nAll school bus drivers that drive a vehicle with a capacity greater than (15) must be certified. Before getting their certification, they must have a valid driver's license, pass a physical examination, and obtain a Commercial Driver's License (CDL). The driver must also complete a three day pre-service school bus driver safety education training course and attend an annual safety meeting to learn any new or modifications to the safety laws. In addition, the drivers must spend 12 hours of on-bus training, pass written tests and a driving test given by a certified BMV examiner.\n\nOur bus fleet successfully completed another annual bus inspection by the Indiana State Police in March 2023. The semi-annual safety inspection is very thorough: several officers spend a full day looking at every vehicle inside, outside and underneath; everything from transmission, suspension and brakes to lights, mirrors, stop arms - even cleanliness is important."
