        "text": "We love this school! They have created an environment that fosters a love of learning. The school is student focused. The staff, the teachers, the activities, even the walls are kid friendly! The academics here are also strong. My child has learned so much and I feel so confident in her future with the foundation Shamrock Springs Elementary has laid at her feet.\n\nParent Review\n\n2y ago\n\nI wanted to add a new review for this school since the last one was in 2013. My child is in Kindergarten and so far I have been very impressed with the school. I've experienced very quick responses from both the Principal and Vice Principal when questions/issues have arose. I can't speak about the higher grades yet, but our Kindergarten teacher has been amazing. Very in-tune with how different children learn and she focuses on the child's well-being as a whole. I help out once a week and as a Spanish speaker, I have been asked to read in Spanish to my child's class. The kids love working on different languages and are all so inquisitive about the world. My favorite though, is asking what happened in their STEM class each week. Our 5 year-old came home talking about Frank Lloyd Wright and Frank Gehry the other day - amazing! They are definitely fostering creativity.\n\nParent Review\n\n6y ago\n\nThis school told my child that they would call the babysitter (child services) cause there mommy and daddy were not good parents... who tells a 6 year old that??? I work nights and sometimes I don't always make it back to my house to get my daughter to the bus or ever class on time they were never more then ten minutes late but still because I am trying to support my family and work 16 hour shifts I am a bad parent\n\nParent Review\n\n4y ago"
