        "text": "Sebastian Coe, Chair of the London 2012 Organising Committee has visited Bedfordshire to meet young people involved in sporting initiatives\n\nThe two clubs are faith-based sports initiatives run by the local church and mosque in the Queens Park neighbourhood. They are staffed by volunteers from both faiths, and engage over 180 children every week in cricket and basketball. The sessions take place at Westfield Middle School, Biddenham Upper School and Sports College.\n\nLord Coe said that the Olympics in 2012 has helped bring this about:\n\n\"What is now really gratifying is that two and half to three years into this project, I'm now witnessing schemes like the one at Westfield's School that I don't believe would have got up and running had we come back empty handed from Singapore\" he said.\n\n\"What I'm now witnessing is stuff happening on the ground at a participation level which is what we always said we wanted the Games to produce.\""
