        "meta_description": "The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians is a 1970 American animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions. After the Christmas special Frosty the Snowman (1969), it was Rankin/Bass' second hand-drawn animated work to be outsourced to Osamu Tezuka's Mushi Production in Tokyo, Japan. The show aired on ABC on April 7, 1970 before the airing of that year's Oscars. It was a tribute to early vaudeville, and featured animated reworkings of various famous comedians' acts.",

        "text": "Goofy animated special from Rankin/Bass which animates some random comedy bits from comedians of the day…or earlier. There is a song from the Smothers Brothers, a comedy routine from George Burns and Jack Benny, a stand-up routine from Flip Wilson about Christopher Columbus, WC Fields, the Marx Brothers and more.\n\nFor my money the Marx Brothers bit is the most interesting, as Groucho voices himself and recreated the Napoleon bit from their first hit show “I’ll Say She Is” which was never adapted into a film. Granted, Chico is voiced by Paul Frees and as such sounds a little like Boris Badenov, and obviously Harpo was also deceased but didn’t need his voice…and Zeppo wasn’t interested in acting at all…"
