        "text": "Well, Christmas is a-coming and bells begin to ring! Wreaths are on front doors, stores are crowded (though they really shouldn’t be) and Christmas music is assaulting our eardrums once more (just kidding...but am I?) But most of all, it’s that time again to watch the Rankin and Bass Christmas specials!\n\nBack in the 1960’s, the concept of a holiday TV special was brand new. It started with Mr. Magoo’s Christmas Carol in 1962. The idea was well-received, with advertisers jumping at the opportunity to profit on the undivided attention of families gathered for the holidays. In 1964, an animation studio known as Videocraft International created a Christmas special about a reindeer with a bright red nose. Although previous holiday specials were generally successful, this quirky stop-motion classic changed the game.\n\nThe success of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer was undeniable. The off-beat animation perfectly matched the eccentric, yet lovable characters. So, the animators went to work and produced more holiday specials for years to come. Soon Rankin and Bass, as the company was later known, was a fixture of the holiday season. Their work has become a holiday tradition, and some wouldn’t consider it Christmas without it.\n\nThere are so many specials, we couldn’t possibly talk about all of them. So, we have picked our top 5 favorites! It’s time, cassettes, for Rankin(g) and Bass!\n\nHistory of Rankin/Bass\n\nBefore we get into our favorite specials, let’s talk about the history of Rankin and Bass!\n\nNumber 1\n\nRudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\n\nThe crowned jewel of Rankin and Bass aired December 6, 1964 on NBC, as part of General Electric’s Fantasy Hour. For a few years, Rankin and Bass had been creating commercials for GE, and since they had been well-received, they decided to make a Christmas special as well.\n\nBack in the 1930’s, Montgomery Ward would give out free storybooks to children. One of their catalog writers, Robert L May, created the perfect story to include, about an outcast reindeer named Rudolph. The store printed 2 million copies that Christmas, and they received letters from children and parents all over the country. Rudolph was a hit! Two years later, the store gave the rights to the story to May, who then teamed up with his brother-in-law to make it into a song.\n\nIn 1948, that song was covered by famous country singer Gene Autry, and a Christmas tradition was born. “Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer” became one of the most played Christmas songs.\n\nSo, in the early 1960’s, Arthur Rankin turned his attention to the story for a Christmas special. Johnny Marks, the songwriter and May’s brother-in-law, was very protective of the property. But, it just so happened that Rankin was his next-door neighbor! Rankin finally convinced his neighbor to let him make the special, and the rest was history.\n\nPlot\n\nNarrated by Sam the snowman, this special follows the life of Rudolph, a reindeer born with a strange nose that glows red. After being made fun of by the other reindeer, he teams up with Hermey the elf. Together they run into characters like Yukon Cornelius and the abominable snowman, and end up on the island of misfit toys.\n\nMaking of\n\nRankin wanted a particular look to his specials, and he hired talented artists that weren’t well-known. His goal overall was none of his specials to look the same, so that every story had its own feeling. That’s why Rudolph felt so unique, because no one ever made anything like it before or since.\n\nThis special was written for the screen by Romeo Muller, and this started a long career partnership between him and Rankin and Bass. It was also directed by Larry Roemer, with assistant director Kizo Nagashima.\n\nThe songs were written, as usual, by Jules Bass and Maury Laws, with “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” and “Holly Jolly Christmas” both written by Johnny Marks.\n\nThe song 'Fame and Fortune' was not featured in the special until the next year, 1965.\n\nThe special had about $500,000 in production costs, which was immediately covered by the GE when they purchased the rights to the property for two airings.\n\nBecause of this, during the first airings, the title page said, “GE presents” while on the DVD versions, it says, “Rankin/Bass Present.”\n\nThis was the biggest premier of stop-motion television so far, with “animagic” created in Japan.\n\nIchiro Komuro created the puppets, while Tadahito (Tad) Mochinaga was the animation supervisor.\n\nThe 22 room sized sets which took a year to complete.\n\nThe figures had ball joints and each one cost $5000 which included multiple lip and eyepieces.\n\nIn later years, the special has been released on DVD with minor changes from the original. The biggest change is the ending. The original airing had the end credits immediately after Santa flies to the island of misfit toys. The credits appear on packages being thrown by an elf from the sleigh.\n\nIn the later version of the credits, names are spelled incorrectly.\n\nThey also shortened one scene from the special to make room for a few moments of the misfit toys getting on to Santa’s sleigh.\n\nStarring\n\nNarrated by Burl Ives as Sam the Snowman who was recognized for this role for many years afterwards. He even noted that this role overshadowed even his Oscar win in 1958's The Big Country.\n\nLarry D. Mann as Yukon Cornelius the loveable arctic prospector aiding Rudolph and Hermey on their journey.\n\nLarry D. Mann was in several things but most notably as the train conductor in “The Sting” and Watkins in “The Heat of the Night.”\n\nBillie Mae Richards as Rudolph (you know him.)\n\nShe is not only known for being the voice of Rudolph but also Tender Heart Bear in the first and second Care Bear Movies.\n\nPaul Soles as Hermey the elf that does not want to make toys but be a Dentist!\n\nPaul Soles has made appearances in many things but some of his most notable are when he played Danny in the movie “The Score” and Stanley in “The Incredible Hulk.” (The Hulk with Edward Norton in it.)\n\nStan Francis as Santa Claus\n\nStan Francis only acted in a few things like “Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans” and “The New Adventures of Pinocchio.”\n\nAlfie Scopp as Charlie in the Box, Fireball, and some of the Reindeer.\n\nAlfie Scopp was Avram the bookseller in “The Fiddler on the Roof” and has also done voice work for several other projects.\n\nJanet Orenstein as Clarice, the little doe that fancies Rudolph before he was cool.\n\nPaul Kligman as Donner, Clarice’s Father, and Comet the Coach.\n\nPaul Kligman is known for the 1955 musical drama series “Folio” and as General ‘Thunderbolt’ Ross in the 1966 “Hulk” series.\n\nCarl Banas as the Head Elf, Spotted Elephant, and some of the Other Toys.\n\nCarl Banas has done voice work on several things, one being the character Sweetums in the 1971 “Tales from Muppetland: The Frog Prince.”\n\nCorine Conley as the Doll and others.\n\nCorine Conley has many credits. She has been in a range of movies and tv shows including “Days of Our Lives”, the 2019 “Anne With an ‘E,’” and the 2018 movie “A Simple Favor.”\n\nPeg Dixon as Mrs. Donner, Mrs. Claus, and other voices.\n\nPeg Dixon was in the 1956 tv movie “Anne of Green Gables,” the 1967 “Spider-Man” tv series, and several characters in the 1972 “Festival of Family Classics” tv series.\n\nImpact/Why we chose it\n\nWhen Rudolph first aired, it captured 55% of viewers, and those numbers didn’t decrease for over 30 years. It remains to be the longest-running animated Christmas special, and its popularity has never declined. In 1995 it was the highest rated animated program for the entire year. Rudolph wasn’t just a big deal for Rankin and Bass, but for TV in general. It paved the way for more specials. If not for Rudolph, would we have How the Grinch Stole Christmas? Or A Charlie Brown Christmas? This special also highlighted an unpopular type of animation style, and inspired creators like Tim Burton and other stop-motion artists.\n\nRudolph not only had incredible songs, but it also yielded colorful characters that audiences would not soon forget.\n\nBut most of all, Rudolph is about intolerance. It’s the story of a young reindeer whose father is ashamed of him, of an elf ostracized by his coworkers. It’s a timeless story about people in search of acceptance, and that the parts of us that seem to be our weaknesses may be our best qualities\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nSo on Twitter, we asked you guys for your favorite Rankin and Bass Christmas specials, and your ranking was:\n\n4. Frosty the Snowman\n\n3. Santa Claus is Coming to Town\n\n2. Year Without a Santa Claus\n\nRudolph\n\nWe used your ranking to decide our number one! We had one comment that we would like to read as well, from Andrew Boynton @guthbrand: “The Hobbit! Before you say that’s not a Christmas special, remember the elves. Also Gandolf is basically a low-carb Santa” So The Hobbit is officially an honorable mention. Thank you Andrew!\n\nOur other honorable mentions are:\n\nThe Little Drummer Boy\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMIW7HR2LOo&fbclid=IwAR2LW4NgKa74o4BkEK2fwDCJmznsLePkniEmwkJJZP_UFO6FPKx3b9bjjCs\n\nThe Cricket on the Hearth\n\nhttps://www.dailymotion.com/video/xw4sty?fbclid=IwAR1thlI3chXfSrFxNDBgWo-4GyvzICyPR-rIXt8RB_P7juXLcqDaYndse4I\n\nSanta Baby\n\nThe Stingiest Man in Town(1978)\n\nRudolph’s Shiny New Year\n\nTwas’ the Night Before Christmas\n\nNestor, the Long-eared Christmas Donkey\n\nJack Frost\n\nThe Leprechaun’s Christmas gold\n\nRankin and Bass wasn’t just a Christmas special machine, they were a full-fledged animation studio that heavily influenced animation for years to come. But, their contribution to Christmas is incalculable. We encourage everyone to go and watch all the Rankin and Bass specials, and make a ranking of your own--you won’t regret it!"
