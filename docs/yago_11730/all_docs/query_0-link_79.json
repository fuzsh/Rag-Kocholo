        "text": "It’s comedy time again! And this time it’s based on… a slang term that had fallen out of fashion a decade earlier. Cool. Good to know Disney’s still hip and cool with the kids. But will the movie itself sink or swim?\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

All photos are capped from my copy of the movie with InstantShot! unless otherwise specified.\n\nSeriously, “beatniks” were outdated by 1965. Good job guys. No wonder the studio was struggling during the early Ron Miller years. Not to mention that once again, the company’s sights and budgets were very much set on theme parks and very much not set on movies. We’re just a year away from Magic Kingdom, folks! But first, they rounded up Norman Tokar to direct an adaptation of a short story by Martin Roth that I could not find. Arthur Julian wrote the script, who was, you guessed it, primarily a television writer with little film experience! That’s always a winning combination. Release that on a double bill with Song of the South in a post-Civil Rights world and you surely have a winning formula!\n\n… yeah, not so much. People were tired of watching the same comedy yet again. Besides, a successful comedy has jokes that are actually funny, which this didn’t. And as proof that we’re slowly but surely making progress on several fronts, critics tore into Disney for the many sexist and racial “jokes” baked into the script. As they should. I’m sure their terrible choice of double bill didn’t help that stand out any less. So Boatniks was sunk and I am really not excited about this.\n\nSTORY\n\nWe get off to a truly winning start with a montage of all the stupid crap rich drunk people get up to on their yachts. Stuff like having a beer can somehow mess up a compass despite aluminum not being magnetic and crashing Herbie the Love Bug in a lake while it’s parked. Yeah, it’s dumb. Having to deliver some tourist’s baby while her useless husband fishes is the last straw for Lieutenant Jordan. He’s off to a calmer assignment, where he’ll miss all the hot girls in bikinis but at least he won’t have to put up with all this nonsense. His commanding officer Commander Taylor congratulates him and assures him that he’s got the best possible man lined up to take over: Ensign Thomas Garland, son of a great Naval hero from World War II. But is he really the best man for the job? It certainly doesn’t seem like it. Poor Tom has the worst luck in the world, getting pulled over by the same sadistic cop from Blackbeard’s Ghost and The Ugly Dachshund while he’s already running late.\n\nWhile the cop gleefully writes Tom a million tickets, his radio announces a BOLO for three jewel thieves. By crazy random happenstance, said jewel thieves roll past at that exact second. Charlie and Max, the two dumb henchmen get nervous being so close to the cops but Harry, the leader, assures them that as long as they act natural they can drive to Mexico with their ill-gotten gains undisturbed in their trunk. So not ten seconds later Tom rear ends them. He apologizes profusely while trying to get the two cars unstuck and coming perilously close to opening up the trunk. Harry tries to shoo away the prying witnesses by accusing them of communism and assuring the cop who comes to investigate that there was no harm done. Tom finally makes it to Balboa Island, passing some more dumb boat shenanigans culminating in his introduction to Jason Bennett (Wally Cox, the original voice of Underdog) and the eternal party on his boat full of hot chicks giggling vapidly in bikinis. Yeah, there’s a lot of that in this movie. Buckle up.\n\nTom makes his clumsy way up the dock and knocks into a paint can, dumping it all over the head of Kate Fairchild, the very pretty owner of the local boat rental and sailing school. She’s furious with him like she didn’t leave a paint can precariously set on a thin rail above her head instead of safely and conveniently on the dock next to her. He tries to apologize and she snarls at him to leave her alone so we know they’re going to end up together because in Sitcom Land “get lost” means “take me I’m yours”. Finally, Tom reports in to Commander Taylor who isn’t even a little bit mad that he’s this late. He just gushes about how great Tom’s father was and introduces him to his Warrant Officers (I think) Walsh and Wagner, the latter of whom is none other than Tom Lowell from That Darn Cat and The Gnome Mobile! The second they start showing him around their boat, Tom falls overboard. Because he’s clumsy. Have they mentioned he’s clumsy? I don’t forsee the joke about his clumsiness getting old anytime soon, do you?\n\nThe trunk clearly wasn’t a safe place to hide the stolen jewels so when they get back to their motel, Charlie and Max get to work hollowing out salamis, bread, and pickles to disguise their loot as a picnic lunch. Why? Because it’s wacky. Harry saunters out in his shiny new naval uniform and declares that he’ll be going by the alias Commodore Simmons from now on. Every road in California has been blocked off to apprehend the thieves, so the only thing for it is to travel to Mexico by water. There’s just one problem: none of them knows the first thing about sailing. It’s okay, though! Harry has a book! It’s the same thing, right? Yeah. Definitely the same thing. They approach Kate while she teaching two kids to sail so they can rent a boat. It’s blatantly obvious that they don’t know the first thing about sailboats, but she doesn’t suspect anything. They’re just testing her, you see. And that flies as a cover story, because she’s just a girl you see.\n\nSpeaking of Kate, somehow, Tom is already head over heels for her even though she made it abundantly clear that she wants him far away from her. Walsh doesn’t see the appeal. He’d rather have one of the bombshells from Jason’s harem, always ready to party on a boat with a wine cellar instead of a motor. Yes, really. A distress signal interrupts that charming train of thought and they hurry off to aid a rowboat run aground on some rocks. Grandpa Munster and his wife bicker because hating your wife is just hilarious while Tom rows out to help them, and Wagner gets another distress signal and leaves with the boat. Tom’s really clumsy so he fails utterly at tossing a the struggling couple line so now they’re both stranded. And who should row out to help but Kate and her students? He tries to pretend it’s a drill but she’s not going to let anybody else act like she’s too female to be useful when in fact she’s the smartest person here. So she rescues him.\n\nSomehow the crooks manage to get their stolen sailboat onto the water, but that’s as far as they get. They try to hoist the sails but fail so spectacularly that they hoist Charlie up onto the mask. We are then treated to a solid ten minutes of the three goons screaming and flailing at each other and it is absolutely painful to watch. They crash to the deck under a pile of sailcloth and flail around for several more endless minutes until they finally crash into a dock. A man dressed in the most stereotypical Mexican costume on earth greets them with a hearty buenos dias and the crooks think they made it to Mexico. Of course there’s like an hour left so it’s just a taco stand. Because jokes.\n\nWhat’s the worst part of Ensign Taylor’s botched rescue, the part that he’s really in trouble for? Is it the fact that he didn’t rescue the civilians? Is it the fact that he damaged military property? Nope! According to Commander Taylor, it’s the fact that he was rescued by a girl. I really don’t understand how a company that created female leads like Cinderella, Lady, or the Three Good Fairies for their animated films insists throughout their live action output that women can’t do anything. It’s infuriating. Anyway, Taylor rips into Tom and orders him to get his life together, ending in one last potshot at the expense of Japanese people. Love it.\n\nThat night Kate pushes her way through an extremely hectic crowded restaurant and spots Tom in the crowd. They pretend not to see each other at first, but it doesn’t last long and soon they’re bickering about their past two disastrous meetings. They make a pact to stay away from each other, but when they shake on it the frazzled hostess mistakes them for friends. She suggests that they share a table so she can seat them quicker and they reluctantly agree. Somehow, incredibly, the impromptu date goes well and by dessert they’re laughing like a real couple. Tom swears he’s jinxed and it takes Kate all of thirty seconds to pin down the real problem: he’s trying way too hard to live up to his father’s reputation. By the time she gives him permission to pay her check (love those gender roles), he’s so comfortable he doesn’t even spill anything on h– oh wait never mind.\n\nTom’s newfound confidence continues to impress Kate as he shows her students around his boat. Incidentally, IMDB credits one of these students as a grown-up Kevin Corcoran! I couldn’t tell which one it is, but I think he’s one of the older kids here. Unfortunately all good things must end and Tom bumbles into a patch of dense fog. The jewel thieves wind up in the same patch of fog and the two dance awkwardly around each other. You can see them crash from a mile away but they draw it out just like everything else. It happens eventually and the thieves’ boat sinks. As he tosses them a life preserver like the upstanding member of the Coast Guard, Tom clumsily knocks the picnic basket into the water. Harry moans “Somebody up there hates me… I was wrong. Somebody down here hates me.” Here’s a hint: it’s me. I hate you. And everything else in this movie.\n\nEven though Tom did everything by the book and can’t be responsible for weather conditions or the thieves’ incompetence, Commander Taylor screams in his face again. If he screws up again, he’s done for. Knowing he’s on thin ice, Tom sails out to redeem himself through another series of unfunny gags full of the dumb rich idiots he has to save from themselves. The worst of the worst is a young lady with her skirt stuck on her wheel. Every man on the bay wolf whistles at her when she begs for help and the punchline is that the only way to free her is to cut her dress… and every coast guard member happily volunteers. It’s super gross. Someone actually greenlit this script, you guys. At least the thieves are only being incompetent and unfunny while attempting to fish for their picnic basket. It doesn’t work so they decide to try something else. Before they can turn to go, Charlie actually catches a huge fish that tears around the marina until Tom rescues them after way, way too long.\n\nApparently Tom and Kate became an official couple somewhere offscreen because they share a very casual smooch for two people who hated each other a few scenes ago. She shows him the picture the newspapers took of him helping the three lucky fisherman who caught a 500-pound bass. He doesn’t notice anything strange about the photo, but she, the only person with a brain in this entire film, points out that all three of the other men have their faces hidden. Somehow he doesn’t find this nearly as suspicious as she does, but he agrees to check things out. He watches through binoculars as they stick Charlie in a diving suit and dump him in the water. They pretend to fish while he searches the seafloor until a very tiny nurse shark swims by minding its own business. Charlie freaks out, which gets Harry and Max freaking out, and everybody freaks out, and Tom shoots the shark.\n\nMillions of dollars in jewels are still sitting at the bottom of the bay, but Charlie staunchly refuses to go diving again. I don’t blame the guy, and Harry has a solution anyway. He calls an associate in Tokyo to hook him up with a pearl diver. As I’m sure you can imagine given this movie’s track record, it’s handled with a great deal of respect and class. Nah just kidding, he asks the guy “how’s your geisha” while making small talk and that’s just the beginning of this flaming train wreck of a plotline. First, though, all of Balboa turns out out to watch Mr. Mitchell prepare to sail around the world in a dinghy. His wife is thrilled that the’s leaving even though she has nine screaming children under the age of ten to deal with because hating your spouse is hilarious. It’s all completely pointless because the second he shoves off, he crashes into another boat and gets stuck in Balboa to the horror of his sobbing wife.\n\nAfter that truly uproarious diversion, Tom finally acknowledges that these three fishermen might not be on the level. Kate instantly knows they’re smugglers but Tom is the one who gets to investigate their hotel room. All she can do is stall. On the way, he spots another issue of the Exposition Times newspaper featuring a headline about the jewel robbery and it all finally comes together. But the thieves are not in the motel. They are at the airport. Meeting their pearl diver. I am cringing just writing this, because Chiyoko Kuni shows up in the most stereotypical geisha get-up you’ve ever seen with a note pinned to her collar like a dog. She doesn’t speak English, just keeps bowing and scraping while the men drool over how hot she is. We were doing so well in Love Bug, guys. Remember when we had a competent, saavy Asian character who got one over on all the ignorant white dudes? Now we’re back to this. Ughghghg.\n\nSo Tom doesn’t find the jewel thieves at the hotel, but he does spot Commander Taylor in his casual clothes! He gets really defensive about why he’s here with his wife which would suggest that he’s not really here with his wife. Poor Tom was just trying to make polite conversation, geez. Once he storms away, Tom asks the front desk associate which room Harry Simmons is staying in and when he arrived– and he tells him! I know it’s an old movie but as a hotel front desk associate myself, I actually gasped at that. It’s such a big obvious security no no and yes it’s just a movie and Tom’s in the right but like… no. Just no. But not as hard a no as Harry walking right past Tom and passing Chiyoko off as his cousin Shirley from Pittsburg. Or Harry trying to breach the language barrier by speaking loud and slow in an offensive approximation of a Japanese accent… and occasionally speaking Spanish .\n\nAaaand it gets worse. The next day they take Chiyoko out onto the boat, now dressed in a bathing suit cover up like a normal person and not a caricature. Although I have yet to meet a normal person with hair that long and fine who wouldn’t braid it or tie it into a bun when going to swim. I can tell you from experience, that is going to tangle like crazy and it is going to hurt. Okay, I’m just stalling to avoid talking about the rest of this scene. Harry tries to tell her what she’s looking for by grunting and going “ohhh!” because that’s how racists think Japanese people talk. And then Chiyoko takes off her robe to reveal her bikini because she’s about to go swimming and the men spend the next few minutes shamelessly ogling her. Even Tom gets in on the action, turning his binoculars off the thieves he’s tailing to the scantily clad woman much to Kate’s irritation. And Harry actually makes a crack about all the men who would assault her if they saw her! And it’s supposed to be funny! This movie is the worst.\n\nChiyoko retrieves the picnic basket and there’s much rejoicing. Tom and Kate drive up to the motel and Kate the smartest person in this movie figures out that the jewels have to be in the basket. After all, they wouldn’t have hired a pearl diver if they weren’t. Tom doesn’t believe her and decides they have to do more spying to have a clue what’s going on and what he says goes. The crooks make sure all their jewels are present and accounted for, and Harry decides to give Chiyoko a $100 bonus for a job well done. Well, that’s not enough for all the trouble she went to and she tells him so because surprise! She speaks English! She snatches up a diamond bracelet and asses out, thrilled that she got one over on these dumb racist American dirtbags and that’s the end of her. Now, you might remember that I quite liked a similar joke made in The Love Bug, and I did. The problem here is that they spend almost all of Chiyoko’s screentime shamelessly objectifying her body and Harry’s attempts at speaking Japanese are mostly just grunting noises, compared to Buddy Hackett (apparently) actually speaking Cantonese however poorly. Mr. Wu also speaks English much sooner after his introduction and spends a much larger percentage of his screen time being competent and savvy.\n\nTom walks right past Chiyoko with one of the stolen jewels in her hand but rather than ask her where she got it or anything, he lets her pass by and peers through windows instead. I know he doesn’t know she speaks English, but cmon Tom. He doesn’t even get the right room. The room he gets happens to be the one where Commander Taylor is sleeping beside his wife (yes really, making the earlier exchange really pointless), who reports a Peeping Tom. After yet another “I hate my wife” crack, Taylor calls the police. Cut to the next morning when Taylor once again screams in Tom’s face. Tom stammers that he was trying to look in Commodore Simmons’ window to recover stolen jewels, to which Taylor replies “you are sicker than I thought” because we’re just trying to offend literally everyone. I mean I know it’s 1970 and Disney’s really conservative and things were obviously not super great for LGBTQUIA+ folks at that point yet but really???\n\nNow that they have their picnic basket, it’s off to Mexico for our jewel thieves. Harry makes another long distance call to a pilot associate in Tijuana and how do you think they portray Mexican people? If you guessed dirty and poor with bad accents and a ton of kids, you’re right! All they have available is a seaplane, but that sounds like it’ll work. Famous last words, right? Tom brings an unimpressed Taylor down to the docks to ambush them and see once and for all that they’re thieves. They spend so much time bickering that they miss the thieves walking right past them with picnic basket in hand. Luckily, Kate is there and she has eyes so she tries to stall. Tom steps in with an overly enthusiastic Coast Guard welcome and tries to “help Harry with his bags”. He’s clumsy so the basket flies open and all the food spills out.\n\nA random pelican of all things reveals the truth by snatching up a pickle. Kate snatches it away and finds the diamond necklace inside– exactly the proof Tom needs! She shows Taylor the evidence while Tom calls over some random dude in a motorboat to go after the thieves. Our obligatory chase scene gets cut short when Jason’s eternal yacht party stalls right in the thieves’ path. They have no choice but to hop from boat to boat until they can hide in the crowd on the yacht. There’s some more dumb jokes about being out of booze and food and more awkward shots of girls in bikinis. Eventually a submarine captain climbs aboard to join the party, leaving his blatant Beatles reference docked conspicuously beside it. Well, we all live in a yellow submarine so that means they have free reign to take it right? Sure. Cuz they do.\n\nTom pushes through the crowd and interrogates a hot girl to find out where he lost the crooks. He can’t follow them where they’re going so he flags down a troop of Sea Scouts to carry him in their canoe. And a canoe chasing a submarine should be awesome but it’s in The Boatniks so it’s mostly just boring. Remember when we had a really good movie about a submarine? I miss 20,000 Leagues. I miss watching movies I enjoyed. Finally, Kate and Taylor pull up in an actual motorboat to give Tom some much needed power, but by that point the thieves are already celebrating their escape. This Navy boat has sonar equipped so they find the sub… then lose it… then find it again because Charlie sneezes. That’s five minutes of my life I won’t get back. Harry comes up with the admittedly clever plan to make it look like they sank by shooting all their food out of their torpedo tubes and escaping the sonar.\n\nIt almost works. Almost. Taylor orders his men to get divers on the scene to recover the jewels from the “sunken” sub. Unfortunately for the crooks, Kate is mildly intelligent and spots the seaplane just as they surface the sub. The chase starts up all over again, now agonizingly slow because it was so riveting when it was fast we just desperately needed to see more of it. Finally, the crooks make it to the seaplane and push past Pepe the pilot’s wife when she tries to be a good hostess and offer them coffee, tea, or tequila over and over again because lol Mexico. Suddenly, the plane starts making horrible noises and Pepe realizes that they can’t take off unless they remove some weight from the plane. They start tossing whatever they can off the boat and they drag the gag out but you can tell the second the plane stalls that they’ll toss the picnic basket and render this whole thing pointless so get on with it already. So they do that. And Harry pulls down a screen with the anemic punchline: “Maybe the movie will be good?” Hint: it’s not.\n\nThe bad guys’ plotline has been resolved so now all that’s left is our romantic leads. The Coast Guard catches the picnic basket, saving Tom’s reputation. Taylor loves him again and declares that Tom finally lives up to his dad’s name and his curse is lifted and everything is peachy. Kate tries on a diamond ring and not-so-subtly hints that Tom should give her one like they didn’t hate each other three days ago. Whoopsie doodles, it’s stuck on her hand! Guess she’ll just have to keep it. It’s not like it’s stolen property or anything like that. Tom decides the universe is telling him to propose to this girl who hated him three days ago, and they share a smooch because apparently they’re engaged now. And that’s our happy ending.\n\nI’m no fan of these goofball comedies. They’re so formulaic and obnoxious and dumb and I spent the better part of the late ’60s begging for something with a little more meat in it. And instead, I get… this. It’s just as dumb and derivative as the rest of this genre, except this time the writers seemed to be on a mission to offend as many people as possible. And this isn’t me viewing things from 2021, at least one critic at the Washington Post in 1970 cringed at the depictions of women, Mexican people and Japanese people. It’s that bad. Even the jokes that aren’t offensive are just… dumb. They nearly all fall flat, because they’re told by bland actors with poor direction playing characters with zero depth to them. The Boatniks should have been sunk on sight.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nEnsign Thomas Garland is clumsy. He’s very clumsy. The script takes great pains to make sure we know how clumsy he is. It’s like reading the first few chapters of Twilight. It’s his only character trait. Mostly he just bumbles and fumbles around and the framing of the movie insists we should care and we just don’t because this guy is so boring. There’s a really easy fix to this baked in this excuse for a script, too, but they give so little weight to his struggle to live up to his famous father that it feels like an afterthought. Robert Morse’s voice sounded really familiar to me even though I’m not super familiar with the original How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and I’ve never seen Mad Men. I had to scroll pretty far down his IMDB page to figure out why– he voiced Jack Frost in my favorite super underrated Rankin/Bass Christmas Special of the same name! They almost never show it anymore, but it’s a very sweet if a little cheesy retelling of the original Little Mermaid story but with snow sprites instead. It’s nice to have something to smile about in this review.\n\nKate Fairchild is the smartest person here and pretty much the only reason Team Good Guys gets anything done. Good for her but that’s about all she’s got going for her. Being the only sane person in this marina can only go so far when the rest of your personality is Girl. It doesn’t help that her romance with Tom comes completely out of left field offscreen. They have no chemistry whatsoever! I know it was an unspoken rule that every movie needed a romance, but this one really didn’t. I hope Stephanie Powers gets a little more to work with next time we see her.\n\nCommander Taylor doesn’t seem to realize World War II is over. He’s hyper aggressive and takes his job seriously which is usually good for a military commander, but come on, dude, you’re babysitting a bunch of drunk losers with more money than sense. It’s not a war zone. It doesn’t help that several of his lines are pot shots at Japanese people for no real reason other than he’s in the Navy and hasn’t gotten over Pearl Harbor thirty years later. Don Amece deserves a better script.\n\nHarry Simmons and his cronies Charlie and Max are just another bunch of bumbling crooks cut from the same cloth as Frank and Iggy from That Darn Cat or the mob from Never a Dull Moment. It’s the same characters. You’ve got the stock team of the leader who thinks he’s smarter than he is (Harry), the one who actually has all the brains but gets ignored (Max), and the really dumb one who gets to be the butt of every joke (Charlie). To their credit, the actors give it their all and put way more energy into the film than is really warranted. As a result, their scenes are way more interesting than the heroes, but that’s not saying very much. They’re played by three very famous character actors with experience in this particular archetype: Norman Fell (the original Oceans Eleven) as Max, Michael Shaughnessy (Francis the Butler in the aforementioned Never a Dull Moment), and Phil Silvers (It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World) as Harry!\n\nMUSIC\n\nMost of this movie happens over near-complete silence, as is the case with many of these lower-budget films. Bruce Belland, Robert F Brunner, and Franklyn Marks’ score only shows up under two circumstances. The first is when the movie gets particularly desperate to be wacky and quirky, such as when the crooks flail under their fallen sail for five minutes on end or the endless submarine chase. Bouncy brass and tambourine come off as a sort of musical laugh track, begging the audience to laugh? Please? And that’s the better scenario. The only other times you hear incidental score here are very specific musical queues for Chiyoko and Pepe’s scenes so you knew very clearly which country they’re from and how very exotic they are. You know, because they weren’t painfully stereotypical enough to begin with.\n\nThe Boatniks can only loosely be called a song. In fact, I didn’t even bother trying to find it to add to my Disney playlist or to link it here because I debated talking about it. But I think I can spare a little blurb to talk about how bad it is. Almost the entire song consists of this foghorn-like bass voice droning “Booooaaaaatniiiiiks” over some beboppy electric piano chords. Right in the middle the generic Disney chorus starts up a single verse featuring the pun “nautical but nice” and implying that Boatniks are an actual type of person (they’re not) and that the title means anything (it doesn’t). Then we’re back to foghorn guy. When the credits song is this cringeworthy, you know you’re in for a bad time.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nWilliam E. Snyder’s second to last film makes me wonder how he got the job as Disney’s resident cinematographer. Don’t get me wrong, he’s done some good work in the past like Rascal and Summer Magic. But dear Lord, this is not his best work. The lighting is atrocious, and there is a jarring difference between scenes filmed on location and the green screen. It’s particularly bad when the goons are climbing around the main sails. I know how hard it is to film out on water like this and special effects weren’t as advanced as they are now but come on, man, your biggest claim to fame is The Creature From the Black Lagoon. You’ve done films on water before, and he’s done better work than this in the past. There’s also not a lot of color in this movie for a film focused so heavily on summer fun. It’s a lot of blue and gray which isn’t very pleasing to the eye, and the model work on the submarine sequence is terrible. You can see the strings bobbing around everywhere!\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nDisney just keeps finding new and appalling ways to disappoint me, don’t they? The different times excuse can only fly so far, and this… this is just… ugh. And from what I’ve heard from other reviewers, the worst is yet to come. Not that this thing didn’t have other problems. It feels like they were aiming for some kind of offbeat, absurdist kind of comedy without any idea how to make it work. The end result is a collection of “lol so random XD” type jokes peppered between all the offensive ones and mostly I just wanted to throw my TV out a window the whole time.\n\nFavorite scene: Kate turning the movie’s attempted “meet-cute” on its head and actually having a realistic reaction to some goon knocking paint all over her head. It’s a shame that couldn’t last."
