        "text": "With the rise of dangerous sports, extreme game shows, exploitative news, and particularly reality TV, writers have become fascinated by the idea of just how far a game show will go to get ratings. Of course, the answer is always the same — public execution. Movies like The Running Man, The Show, Series 7: The Contenders, and Live, as well as the novel The Big Question (by game show producer Chuck Barris), all deal with game shows where contestants die on television. It’s an intriguing premise, but most of them don’t tell very interesting stories. That said, Live and The Big Question both build up the tension by only having one person die on TV at the end of an episode, and as the pressure mounts over the course of the story, we get this increasing sense of dread. We know this is going to end with someone dying, and it is just a matter of who and when. Even though these are just fictional stories, they do succeed in putting that sickening feeling in the pit of our stomach. Thankfully, real TV has never gone this far, but the closest I have ever gotten to that pit-of-the-stomach “someone’s life is going to be ruined forever” feeling from a game show is while watching the infamous Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire.\n\nOne of the most fun posts I’ve written on here was about the worst game shows and reality shows in the history of television. In that post, I named The Chamber, a game show where contestants answered questions from inside a torture chamber, to be the worst game show of all time. I left Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire off that list for a very practical reason — I hadn’t seen it. It was a one-time event that was never rerun, and it didn’t appear on the internet again until last year. While it was never intended to be a weekly series, it was intended to have more editions, so it definitely counts. Sadly, unlike that post, the story of this show is just bleak and maddening.\n\nContent warning: This story includes multiple instances of domestic abuse. I’ll give another warning when we get to it, but if you simply stop reading when I get to the end of the episode description, you won’t see any of it.\n\nThe year was 2000, and big money quiz shows were all the rage. Thanks to the runaway success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, every network was trying to get its big-money show on the air. Shows like Greed, Winning Lines, and the ill-advised reboot of Twenty-One were trying to give away as much or more money than Millionaire, with varying levels of success. Also, right around the corner was reality TV. Survivor would premiere in March of that year, and Big Brother would follow in July. We were still two years away from The Bachelor. However, in February of 2000, a shockingly misguided game show aired and made the worst kind of headlines.\n\nPart dating game show, part beauty pageant, and part creepy male fantasy (oh wait, did I already say beauty pageant?), Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire was all of the criticisms people can make about reality television combined into one. It was shallow. It was vapid. It was sexist. Thankfully, unlike so many other controversial shows, it only aired one episode. In hindsight, it is fascinating that they expected this to be such a smashing success that it could happen more than once. It is such a disaster in every foreseeable way, yet they thought they could do this format again?\n\nAlright, let’s take a look at the rules of this nightmare. 50 women compete to marry the titular multi-millionaire. The multi-millionaire is kept in a pod onstage, and no one gets to see him.\n\nHowever, all 50 women have agreed that should they win, they’ll marry him at the end of the show. Yeah, I’m sure keeping his face obscured in shadow like a Bond villain is really going to get these women excited to marry him. Host Jay Thomas tells us a little bit about the multi-millionaire at the beginning of the show however, promising, “He is not crazy.” Yeah, we’ll get back to that…\n\nAll 50 women are brought out on stage, and they introduce themselves one at a time. The announcer says their name, an onscreen graphic displays their name and age, and the contestant says what their job is.\n\nThis process takes nearly SEVEN MINUTES. I realize when you have 50 contestants it takes some time, but there has to be a better way than speed-rounding all 50 of them in one fell swoop. People are going to change the channel. The multi-millionaire then has to immediately knock it down to 10. Again, this show is shallow, and it’s not pretending to be anything else, but knocking it down to 10 based solely on appearance?\n\nWhile most of the women are in their 20s or early 30s, their ages go as high as 43 and as low as… 19. Yeah. So, you’re probably expecting that the groom-to-be is around 30, but nope. He’s 42. Well, at least he doesn’t choose any of the women who could still be in college, right? Nope, one of his final 10 is all of 20 years old. The 10 remaining women move to the second round, and the other 40 go away with their free trip to Vegas and week of pampering, and probably a slight sense of relief because they don’t have to continue competing in this travesty.\n\nAlright, so we’re down to 10. Now we’ll finally get to know these women, because this mysterious multi-millionaire is going to marry one of them after all, right? Nope. They get to answer one question apiece. You’ve probably gotten hints of this so far, but with this round it becomes quite evident that this show is BORING.\n\nHere’s how this exciting round of 10 goes. Jay announces a category, the randomizer picks a contestant, Jay reads them a relationship question and four choices, the contestant gives their answer, and the multi-millionaire’s friends and family rate the answer on a scale of 1-10. If you’re only going to give these women one question to answer, you would think they would be meaningful, right? Let’s take a look at some of them:\n\n“You’re out having brunch with friends. You order a bowl of soup. Everyone else orders an expensive entrée. Now the check arrives. One of your friends proposes that you split the bill equally. What do you do?”\n\n“Let’s say your house is a little dirty. What do you do?”\n\n“Your husband mentioned that on a recent business trip he and some of his business associates ended up at a strip club. How do you respond?”\n\nDespite these questions being pretty open-ended, they are multiple choice anyway, because we just have to parody Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Jay even asks, “Final answer?” at one point. That aside, how are these supposed to help the multi-millionaire learn anything about the women? Also, how are the friends’ and families’ scores supposed to help him? He sees the contestants answering, and he’s the one eliminating players. Their scores mean nothing.\n\nWeirdly, Jay interviews some of the contestants during this round, but he snubs two of the last three and goes right to their question. I’m guessing they were cut for time, but the fact that he interviews the first seven and not two of the last three makes it feel like someone was giving him a “hurry it up” motion. (This show didn’t air live, but it feels live). The interviews also don’t really help the multi-millionaire learn anything about the women, as they’re typical game show anecdotes (“I once met George W. Bush,” “I accidentally walked into a pole in the military”). Not exactly the kind of stuff that helps you fall in love.\n\nWell, sure we could spend time getting to know these women so the groom could make sure to pick one who at least seems well-suited for him. Nah, forget that. It’s more important to have a swimsuit contest. It’s not like a guy going on a show where he gets to have his pick of women to instantly marry is looking for a real connection anyway. On the plus side, in this round, we at least get to see a few likes, dislikes, and hobbies for each woman. Of course, we don’t get to hear them talking about them, but at least they are slightly informative.\n\nAfter the swimsuit round, the multi-millionaire cuts the field in half from 10 women to five. It is here that you can see the monumental shift in the attitude of the women on stage. When the 50 women were narrowed to 10, the women who are selected were surprised, yes, but they were mostly smiling and hugging the people next to them. When the field narrows from 10 to five, the reality of it all sets in. The smiles are clearly nervous ones, and none of them feel confident about what’s ahead.\n\nLet’s just say that they are correct to be worried. Jay asks each of them a question about how they feel or if family members are watching at home, and their answers are extremely telling. Jay asks one contestant if she is prepared to be legally married by the end of the show, and she lets out the most blasé “Yep” imaginable. They haven’t even met the potential groom yet, and they’re already thinking of the annulment.\n\nIt’s totally understandable too, because when you sign up for a show with 50 contestants, you never actually think too much about winning. It’s a free week in Vegas and a chance to be on TV. Sure, some poor sap is going to stuck marrying someone at the end, but it won’t be you…\n\nYou can see that host Jay Thomas is experiencing the same gross pit-of-the-stomach feeling that I mentioned at the top, at least to a point. I don’t have a lot of nice things to say about him based on the comments he made after the show, but as the show marches on towards (metaphorical) death, you can see him change. He starts out jokey, making some quips that aren’t exactly great, such as saying that losers can come to his hotel room for a consolation buffet. However, once it gets down to the final five, Jay seems to realize that these women are terrified.\n\nFor the rest of the show, he tones down any jokes at the expense of the women and is genuinely concerned with making them feel comfortable. Again, we’re going to come back to what he said after the show, so I don’t think he had some kind of crisis of conscience here or anything, but it’s admittedly a hosting job that improves as the show goes on.\n\nWe already had the wannabe Who Wants to Be a Millionaire round earlier with the multiple-choice questions, but now we’re getting another knockoff Millionaire as each contestant is given some “intimate” questions to answer. Well, two questions. Well, kind of three questions, but they’re worded terribly. It’s a mess. See if you can understand these rules as Jay explains them (I am not blaming the host here, mind you):\n\n“You have 30 seconds to answer, and when you hear this chime, it means it’s time to wrap it up. Here is intimate question #1: What are the three things your new husband can do to bring out the best in you, and what are the three things he should avoid doing?”\n\nThat is just the first question! Technically, they’re looking for six answers. Thankfully, the second question is just asking if children are needed for a happy life, but still. Who is writing these questions? One two-part question with six answers, followed by one simple yes-or-no, and both warrant 30 seconds? Plus, the timer is never shown on screen, and no one is told to hurry it up. When time runs out, the contestants just seem kind of confused. Plus, for every single contestant, there’s this dramatic, knock-off Millionaire music that is dumb the first time and absolutely grating the fifth time. The producers probably thought it was amusing parody, but it’s just sad. The real Millionaire music is genuinely great; this is desperate. Once again, the family and friends give scores for these answers, but … just one score overall. Not one score per question or something sensible! If this was handled well, I would at least admit that these are good questions to get to know someone you’re considering marrying. However, the execution is so wonky that I don’t think Jay even knows what’s going on.\n\nBefore the multi-millionaire proposes to one of these women (based on all of the meaningful information he has gathered about them over the course of the show), they get one final plea.\n\nAs if these women are not terrified enough at the moment, they have to make them in wedding dresses! Everyone had a wedding dress personally tailored in advance, so if I’m being gracious, they put five of them in wedding dresses to show off the designers’ work. How are these women supposed to make statements from the heart like this? Even worse, they are still making these statements to a man they cannot see!\n\nFinally, after these final pleas, the ladies get to learn who the multi-millionaire is. A video clip kind of introduces him, but his face is still shrouded in various ways throughout. Then, he comes out of his pod, and everyone gets to meet Rick Rockwell.\n\nWe don’t see a lot of the reactions from the women (a wise choice from the director), but it is clear they are not impressed. Eliminated contestants were watching backstage, and one was quoted as saying, “He wasn’t as attractive as you would have thought. So the room erupted with, ‘Whew! God forbid it was me!'”\n\nWhen a show is this shallow, there is a certain expectation that the contestants will be conventionally attractive. All 50 women were, after all. Rick, to put it kindly, is not. When you plan this show that you promise will end with a wedding on national television, you should at least make the bachelor someone who could be fun to marry for a short while. I get the show’s ultra-shallow messaging is that women want to marry someone with money, but it’s clear from these women’s reactions that they don’t! Since they don’t get to know Rick in any other way, this is an absolutely dreadful first impression. Then, he doubles down on the weirdness by making an incredibly creepy statement about the women on stage: “I know exactly what I’m looking for in love and life, and it’s here tonight.” The camera is showing the women’s faces as he makes this objectifying statement, and one of them cannot help but roll her eyes.\n\nWho can blame her? Another is giving a deer-in-the-headlights “Get me out of here now” look. Rick briefly talks about how unfair it was that he got to learn about them while they knew nothing about him, which is nice and all, but he knew the format of the show. He then just walks up to one of the women, walks her forward, and proposes. It is the most awkward thing on a special filled with awkward moments.\n\nThe woman he proposes to is Darva Conger, and if you’ve been paying attention, you’ll note that until the proposal, she has been the least terrified of the women. There are two reasons for this. One, she is from a Hollywood family. Her mother was Susan Harrison, whom you may know as Burt Lancaster’s sister in Sweet Smell of Success or the dancer in the classic Twilight Zone episode “Five Characters in Search of an Exit.” Two, up until the moment of the proposal, she did not think she had any chance of being chosen.\n\nIn an interview with Larry King a year later, Conger admitted that she went on the show to get back at a boyfriend she had broken up with. She hoped to look great and make him reconsider things, and in the end — a very long and messy end — it worked. In multiple interviews, Conger suggested that she assumed the show was rigged, including a 2015 ET interview where she said that she thought the multi-millionaire was already dating one of the women on stage. She got taken to task for saying this by critics, but let’s really look at this. This was before dating reality shows were really a thing. The Bachelor, which tries to end every season with an engagement after weeks of gameplay, wouldn’t premiere until two years later in 2002. Most dating shows until this point offered the prospect of a single date. Even more risque dating shows of the ‘90s like Studs, Bzzz!, and Singled Out ended with contestants winning a date. Promising that a show will end with a marriage is a lot. As I’ve stated, Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire wasn’t live, but if all the women ran out when Rick walked out, it’s not like they could have just brought in more. I really can’t blame someone for assuming the show was taking out some kind of insurance, at least for its first episode, by making one of the contestants a plant. Sure, rigging game shows has been illegal since the ‘50s, but maybe she wasn’t thinking of it in those terms, or maybe she thought there was a loophole somewhere. I’ll cut her some slack.\n\nAlright, back to the proposal, because four things of note happen in about five seconds. One, Rick gets Darva’s name wrong! He gets on one knee and says, “Darva Congra, will you marry me?” Couldn’t have, uh, fixed that in post? I know this was last minute, but there’s something else we’ll get to soon that was obviously fixed in post. Two, the other women (who are clearly relieved) are just kind of awkwardly shuffled off stage. Three, Darva accepts in a state that can only be described as trance-like. From the moment Rick takes her hand until the end of the show, she looks like her soul has left her body and she does not believe anything that is happening.\n\nThis is clear proof that the poor woman believed the show was rigged, because she was on top of things for the whole show up until the proposal. Four, Rick plants a huge kiss on her that she was not expecting, and that she later said she was not happy about. This is just absolutely unhinged television at this point, and I still cannot believe it aired. Jay interrupts the raucous cheers to promise a wedding when they come back.\n\nWhen they come back, a makeshift wedding set has been brought in, and a judge from Nevada marries Rick and Darva. In addition to Darva remaining in her horrified trance state for the entirety of the ceremony, the judge also seems kind of horrified.\n\nSince Darva has no one on her side of the wedding party, no one knows what to do with the flowers that she walked in with. She hands them off to the judge, and Jay quickly steps in to take them. It does provide another amusing moment from Jay, but just… how was this not planned for? How was this so sloppy? As Rick and Darva are dancing, Rick is clearly saying all kinds of things to her, and we just keep seeing Darva mouth “OK” over and over. She is not into whatever he is suggesting.\n\nThat’s where the TV episode ends, but the story is far from over. The fallout was almost immediate. There was plenty of criticism to go around, which I have to imagine the producers knew would happen. Thankfully for the creators, the premise was so objectionable that not as many people talked about just how downright boring it all was. Two hours of absolutely nothing, except for a little bit of grim death, or at least what felt like it. Darva and Rick never consummated the marriage, and Darva filed for annulment almost immediately. She sold the ring through Make a Wish and gave the rest of her prizes directly to charity to make it clear she had no financial gain from the show. Of course, she still got criticized by everyone for years to come when the show came up, but trust me — she is not the villain here. Did she go on the show? Yes. Did she go through with it? Yes, but clearly under duress. If you want to blame her for that, fine, but that is all you can blame her for. She went on a show thinking it wasn’t real, and the worst case scenario happened. Naivete was her only sin. We need to take a look at Rick Rockwell, or rather — the man who called himself Rick Rockwell. To put it bluntly, his name wasn’t Rick Rockwell, he wasn’t a multi-millionaire, and it’s clear that no one would ever want to marry him.\n\nHis given name is Richard Balkey, and he clearly decided that he wanted to go with Rick Rockwell after taping, because the new name is awkwardly edited in. Watch how it cuts away from Jay every time he says his full name. I guess Richard wanted to sound like a runner-up love interest in a ‘40s screwball comedy (Likely profession: Traveling salesman. Likely actor: Ralph Bellamy). As for the multi-millionaire thing, they are really stretching the definition here. When people wanted to know if Rick really was a multi-millionaire, FOX revealed that he had liquid assets of $750,000, but a net worth of a little over $2 million. However, even if you can put aside the unconventional looks, the debatable wealth, and the stage name that sounds like a character the Left Behind authors discarded, we have to deal with the actual elephant in the room — the restraining order. I’m going to reinforce the content warning from the top.\n\nEven though FOX claimed that they ran a background check on Rick, what they didn’t report was that a former girlfriend had a restraining order on him. According to a People magazine article, Ex-girlfriend Debbie Goyne claimed Rockwell “’threw me around and slapped and hit me’ and broke into her home.” Rockwell, of course, denied this, but in an interview with Dateline, he did admit that he threatened to kill her. At first, FOX claimed the restraining order didn’t come up in their research on Rick, but they later disclosed that he had told them about it, and they decided it wasn’t a big deal. A restraining order wasn’t a big deal? How. All of the stories suggested that FOX was selecting from a wide range of multi-millionaire candidates, but this is who you landed on. Oh, but there’s more. Another ex-girlfriend said that Rick sent her countless emails after their breakup, which he signed “Ira” in reference to Ira Einhorn, a fugitive who murdered his girlfriend. I guess Rick, a wannabe standup comedian, (don’t seek out his standup; there is video) thought this was just hilarious. Who were the other options for this show, FOX?\n\nIf you’re angry by now, you should be, but save a little bit of anger for one more person. I really hate to say this, because I thought host Jay Thomas was the only saving grace of this absolute shitshow, but then I looked up his comments about the show. Maybe I shouldn’t have. What can I say? I’m thorough to a fault… well, at least more thorough than the FOX network running a background check. In a 2014 episode of Gilbert Gottfried’s podcast, Thomas sat down to talk about his career, including the show, and there are some noteworthy tidbits. Thomas, unsurprisingly, knew the show was awful and really didn’t want to do it, but they paid him enough. He claims that Rick was actually friends with producer and creator Mike Fleiss, but I have not heard this claim anywhere else and can’t back it up. Thomas describes Darva Conger as “a bitch,” without giving any examples to back up his misogyny. He clearly just didn’t like her. Just give one example, Jay, and also use a better word! Or just don’t criticize the woman who got exploited by everyone. Anyway, Jay claims he went into the pod at one point to tell Rick, “Whatever you do, don’t marry the blonde!” However, all of Jay’s claims deserve speculation, not just because they’re misogynistic, but because we know that one is factually incorrect. Jay claims, “There was a girl from Washington, who was a little bit overweight with braces,” and he claims he told Rick, “Marry her, she will be so happy.” It goes without saying that this is just a gross and disgusting statement, but it’s also just not correct. Based on what he’s saying, it’s clear he’s talking about a finalist named Jennifer who was from Washington. It sure doesn’t look like she has braces, but maybe it’s just because I’m watching a VHS rip of the episode (If you really must know you, you can watch the whole thing on YouTube, but I don’t recommend it). However, even if we give him that one, she is extremely slender, just like pretty much all of the women! What on earth were you talking about, Jay? She’s more nervous than Darva, sure, but she probably thinks it’s real, and her mother wasn’t an actress. If you want to have even less respect for Thomas, listen to the rest of the podcast where he uses the r-slur and claims Woody Allen is the victim in an abusive marriage.\n\nThere really isn’t too much to say about the major players in the years since. Darva and Rick reunited a year later for an interview with Larry King, which I mentioned above. I can’t find video of it, but it sounds like they were fairly cordial with each other, not that Darva had any need to be. She was eventually married and had a son, before divorcing. She’s been mostly out of the public eye, as has Rick. Jay Thomas passed away in 2017 from throat cancer. Creator Mike Fleiss sadly didn’t leave TV forever out of sheer embarrassment, instead going on to create The Bachelor, which took a little longer to get to the wedding but had even more drama. In 2019, Fleiss was accused of assault by his wife, but he continues to work on The Bachelor anyway.\n\nSo let’s go back to FOX’s other contender for the worst game show of all time title. The Chamber put contestants in a torture chamber to answer questions, and one sued the show for damages. That said, even though it had a horrible premise and execution, at least contestants knew there was danger going on. FOX had a responsibility with Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire, and they blew it. Even if you want to create the trashiest “dating” show of all time, you have a responsibility to make sure your contestants are safe. By not weeding out a contestant who seemed to have murderous intentions toward multiple women, they put all 50 women in danger and should have been sued out of existence. Thankfully, Darva got out immediately and was not harmed physically. After getting out, she became the villain in the public eye (even though, admittedly, there was no hero), and that only made things worse. It kind of just shows everything wrong with America, and I think it’s worse than The Chamber.\n\nOther Game Show Posts:\n\n7 Worst Game and Reality Shows\n\nThe Dullest Game Show on TV: Spin the Wheel\n\nHOME\n\nWell, we’re a week away from this year’s Oscars, and I’ve seen every Best Picture nominee, so let’s talk about them.\n\namerican fiction\n\nJeffrey Wright is one of the most compelling actors working today. When he’s on screen, no matter what he’s doing, you cannot look away. When I heard he was heading up an acclaimed satire, I was excited. Wright, unsurprisingly, is fantastic. The rest left me feeling a bit conflicted.\n\nWright plays Dr. Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, a writer and college professor, who finds his books about mythology assigned to the African-American Studies section of the bookstore. Following an event where few people care about his book, but everyone cares about a book called We’s Lives in Da Ghetto, Monk decides to make a quick buck by writing a book that is essentially a checklist of what he thinks white audiences want from Black authors. It’s a great premise, and it leads to some very funny moments. The dialogue is sharp, and the situations are appropriately ridiculous. However, this is only part of the movie.\n\nAmerican Fiction is also a family drama, as Monk returns home and has to help his mother. It is well-written and well-acted family drama, but it feels so disconnected from the over-the-top satire. On the literature side of things, we see an acclaimed white author who seems so dumb that he has probably never read a book. I have no idea what kind of author he is supposed to be, but it would be fine if the movie went all-in on the satire. However, on the family drama side, we have Monk’s gay brother (Sterling K. Brown) struggling to find acceptance and his mother’s gradually worsening Alzheimer’s. I have heard people make connections between the two plotlines, and for a lot of audiences, it works. For me, it’s like if The Producers had a completely sincere plotline about Gene Wilder’s dying cat.\n\nDespite my issues with it, I still liked American Fiction quite a bit. Again, it is genuinely funny. I laughed out loud many times. However, when it comes to satire, I prefer the kind that goes all in. If you have a point to make, I would prefer you twist the knife instead of lightly poking. Think Network, The Producers, The Menu, or the obvious comparison point to this film — Bamboozled. This one will cast a wider net, but I did leave scratching my head a bit at what exactly it was trying to say, which is not the mark of great satire.\n\nANATOMY OF A FALL\n\nA gripping courtroom drama from director Justine Triet, Anatomy of a Fall is the favorite to win Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars, and it’s a few people’s longshot favorite for a few others. Here is a courtroom drama that truly puts the audience in the position of the jurors. Even though we get to know Sandra (Sandra Hüller) before the trial, information is revealed casually throughout that completely turns the story on its head. The screenplay zigs and zags when we aren’t expecting it, and we’re left to wonder about what we really know at all.\n\nThe entire ensemble is phenomenal here, from Sandra’s kindly lawyer (Swann Arlaud) to her young son (Milo Machado-Graner) to the court-appointed caretaker (Jehnny Beth). Unsurprisingly, the film takes inspiration from the 1959 classic Anatomy of a Murder. Both look at the unseemly sides of their respective country’s court systems without ever outright telling us the truth of what happened. All we have are the facts, and they are messy and frustrating. Even the emotions we feel at the end are complicated, and the movie leaves us thinking about it long after the credits roll. I know I still am.\n\nBARBIE\n\nEveryone in the world has seen this movie already. It was the highest grossing film of the year. You’ve already made up your mind about it. If you really want my thoughts on it, here they are.\n\nGreta Gerwig’s previous two films were two of my favorites of the last decade. Lady Bird was probably the only high school movie to ever connect with me on an emotional level, and Little Women was just astoundingly beautiful. Barbie is … the best that it can be. At the end of the day, it’s a toy commercial for kids. It can be deconstructive, but only so deconstructive. It can have meaningful themes, but they can only go so far. Again, this could have been so much worse. A toy commercial directed by Greta Gerwig starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is a whole lot better than one without them. If this impacts kids and people who aren’t reading these important discussions other places, then that’s wonderful. They’re important discussions, and they’re presented well. They’re just presented as part of a toy commercial.\n\nAgain, you’ve already made up your mind about this one, but I will say that the scenes with Will Ferrell are absolutely insufferable to get through. Everything else in the movie fits the vision and flows smoothly, but I audibly sighed every time Ferrell and his pointless subplot showed up. I’m guessing this was a way to get dads into the theatres, but clearly this wasn’t a problem. I’m admittedly not a big fan of his anyway, but I feel like even a lot of his fans must have been annoyed by this.\n\nTHE HOLDOVERS\n\nI fell in love with The Holdovers from the opening scenes. Its setting is so rich, and its characters are so defined, that it could have gone pretty much anywhere with them and I would be OK with it. Are the basic story beats a bit cliche? Sure, but they feel so real here, thanks to the brilliant performances from Paul Giamatti, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, and Dominic Sessa. Randolph gives us such a raw and brutal portrayal of grief that it’s no surprise she is a lock to win Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars.\n\nSet in 1970 at a boarding school, The Holdovers sees an unlikely bond form between prickly teacher Paul Hunham (Giamatti) and student Angus Tully (Sessa) when they have to stay at the school for the holidays. It’s set over Christmas break, and it definitely feels like Christmas all throughout, but it’s all very bittersweet. It is definitely trying to look and feel like a film from 1970, not just a modern film about 1970, and for the most part, it succeeds. I do think the ending scenes wrap up more things than a New Hollywood classic ever would have, and I did find myself wondering why it didn’t shoot for a more ambiguous ending to things. Director and writer Alexander Payne hasn’t been afraid of these kinds of endings in the past, so maybe he didn’t listen to his instincts here. Who knows? Regardless, it’s a thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming film that I would recommend to pretty much anyone.\n\nKILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON\n\nIt is fascinating that the legendary Martin Scorsese, more than 55 years removed from his first motion picture, is currently in the most interesting stage of his career. He’s made classics in every decade since the ’70s of course, but his three-film run of Silence, The Irishman, and Killers of the Flower Moon can be put up against any director’s best run of three. Based on the book of the same name which focused on the FBI’s investigation of the Osage murders, the film shifts focus to the Osage Nation and those who victimize them. Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an unpleasant, dim-witted man who goes along with his uncle William Hale’s (Robert De Niro) plan to marry and murder the wealthy Osage. However, it is just as much the story of Ernest’s wife, Mollie (Lily Gladstone). Gladstone gives the finest performance of the year as a woman who sees her world falling apart around her and has to take things into her own hands. She doesn’t have big monologues, but her subtlety is her strength. There are still a few big moments though, like when she gives a scream of grief so primal and deep that it will shake you.\n\nScorsese is a big fan of horror films, and while this is not classified as one, it definitely gave me the same feelings I get watching Rosemary’s Baby or Hereditary. At one particularly horrifying moment, I remember thinking the movie was playing out like it was about to reveal that the conspirators all worshipped Satan. Of course, this is not that kind of movie, and all the true horror had already been revealed. It is nothing more than a band of monstrous men who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that is just as horrifying as any demonic conspiracy.\n\nKillers does not require you to have watched previous Scorsese films, but new layers will be revealed if you have. In Goodfellas, De Niro’s character kills off the various conspirators from an airport heist when things go south. It’s portrayed as paranoid, but it still plays out over a cool and stylized montage set to the piano coda of “Layla.” Here, De Niro’s character pathetically makes things even worse by trying to dispose of his conspirators. There’s nothing cool about William Hale; he’s just a worm, and a pretty dumb one at that. Prepare yourself for a challenging watch if you sit down for this one, as the subject matter is obviously quite heavy, but it is an absolutely brilliant film. You won’t be able to look away, and if you’re like me, you’ll find yourself wanting to return to it before too long. I could go on and on, but I do have to mention Robbie Robertson’s score, which has become one of my favorite of all time. Robertson said of the music:\n\nI feel that the score is unexpected in many ways and authentic to the heart of the story. For me, it’s kind of perfection to be able to go all the way around this big circle. Starting at Six Nations when music comes along in my life, and then to my history with Martin Scorsese and all the movies leading up to Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nRobertson died last year, but his legacy lives on through the most powerful score I have heard in some time.\n\nMAESTRO\n\nWell, we go from my favorite of the bunch to my least favorite. How in the 2020s are we still making the kind of film that Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story was parodying in 2007? I’m not saying all biographical dramas are like this, and there’s even another biographical drama in this category that I like. I’m specifically talking about these “visual representation of a historical figure’s Wikipedia page” biopics that have nothing to say and refuse to challenge us. Leonard Bernstein did some cool stuff. Thanks for showing us. All we get is the what, not the why or really even the how.\n\nI like Bradley Cooper, but between this and A Star is Born, it seems that I’m not a big fan of him directing himself. Admittedly, even though it wasn’t a true story, A Star is Born also followed a lot of the tropes of a rise-and-fall biopic. He’s better when he does something weird, like Nightmare Alley or his small performance in Licorice Pizza. Here, he has an impressive makeup team that sure makes him look like Leonard Bernstein, but I can’t see past the actor. He and Carey Mulligan get a lot of big character moments, but we’re not given reason to care about them. That said, it’s not quite Bohemian Rhapsody bad. It’s just boring. Thankfully, it’s a very strong year overall, and that’s enough to make this the weak link.\n\nOPPENHEIMER\n\nThe more interesting of the two biographical dramas nominated for Best Picture, Oppenheimer is a bold film that takes a lot of chances. Christopher Nolan’s early films do a lot for me, but after The Dark Knight (which I love), they start to drop off. I was tentative going into Oppenheimer, but I ended up really liking it.\n\nCillian Murphy is the Best Actor frontrunner for his work as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and I can’t argue. It’s an extremely actor-y performance, with a lot of big emotional moments and dramatic line deliveries. Murphy has been putting in solid work for decades, and this will probably go down as his signature role. The enormous ensemble cast is great too, because even if we cannot remember which character is which, we can identify the famous actor playing them, which is all we need. Matt Damon is the standout as the sarcastic Leslie Groves, who offers many of the film’s most memorable moments. Robert Downey Jr. is the one nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and he’s the favorite to win. The Oscars do love a comeback story, after all. There are also brilliant performances by Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, David Krumholtz, and Dane DeHaan.\n\nEven though audiences were looking forward to the famous nuclear testing scene, the most gripping part of Oppenheimer is the last hour. Never have dueling senate hearings been this enthralling. This is the kind of biopic I can enjoy, because it’s something beyond just a biopic. It’s not a birth-to-death story of Oppenheimer or even a rise-and-fall. It’s an engaging psychological drama about a man who is brilliant but also entirely full of himself. He feels bad about what he’s done, but then he wants people to praise him for feeling bad about it. I suppose you could view this as a straightforward “look at this poor genius who wasn’t appreciated,” but that’s not how it’s intended.\n\nHowever, I think there’s a reason Oppenheimer is both the Best Picture frontrunner and a favorite of audiences everywhere. Unlike Killers of the Flower Moon, this movie doesn’t put you face to face with the evil its main character commits. If you go into Oppenheimer thinking that the atomic bomb was a necessary evil (or have an even worse opinion than that), you won’t be challenged on that. I don’t think the movie is pro-bomb, but its message seems to be the message of so many movies from the ’50s and ’60s. Instead of dwelling on the tragedies at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the movie suggests we’ll one day destroy the world. The final scene of the film (not a spoiler, I promise) sees Oppenheimer dreaming about piloting a plane that drops a bomb in some kind of world-ending event. He clearly feels some guilt for what could happen, but not for what did. If this fantasy sequence had shown him dropping a bomb on Hiroshima or Nagasaki, the movie could have sent a stronger message. I don’t think it’s a perfect film, but a lot of the big swings really pay off.\n\nPAST LIVES\n\nA simple story about complicated emotions, Past Lives is one of my favorite films of the year. Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) are 12-year-olds who crush on each other, but right as they realize this, Nora’s family moves from South Korea to Canada. 12 years later, Nora is living in New York, and they reconnect online, but nothing comes of it besides an intense friendship. It takes another 12 years for them to meet again, and by that point, Nora is married to Arthur (John Magaro).\n\nSo many situations in Past Lives have been played out before in sitcoms and romantic comedies, but not like this. Instead of forced drama or awkward comedy, Past Lives treats its characters as human beings with adult emotions. No one is a punch line or a disposable character getting in the way of true love. There are a lot of big, showy movies up for Best Picture this year, and most of them are great. It’s nice to see this smaller film included with them, because it’s exactly what it sets out to be. It’s sweet, romantic, and nuanced, and it’s perfect.\n\nPOOR THINGS\n\nYorgos Lanthimos’ films have not worked for me in the past, so I was a bit nervous about Poor Things. The Killing of a Sacred Deer and especially The Lobster really left a bad taste in my mouth and a gross feeling in the pit of my stomach that I couldn’t shake. Thankfully, Poor Things didn’t do that at all, and I quite enjoyed it.\n\nI wasn’t quite sure of the tone at first, but once I realized that it wasn’t so much a dark comedy as a laugh-out-loud comedy where everything was funny on purpose, I had a good time. It may have lavish production design and an acclaimed cast, but this is a very silly movie in the best way. It’s a fun parody of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. Willem Dafoe plays a Dr. Frankenstein-type named Godwin Baxter, often referred to literally as “God,” who puts the brain of a baby into the head of an adult woman (Emma Stone).\n\nStone plays the evolution quite well, centering the film with a convincing and hilarious performance. Mark Ruffalo turns in a great supporting performance as her pseudo-posh suitor, and Margaret Qualley and Kathryn Hunter are quite memorable in their small roles. More than any film this year, I’m actually surprised at how much I liked this one.\n\nTHE ZONE OF INTEREST\n\nHere is a film that establishes its thesis statement in its opening minutes and then proceeds to repeat it over and over until the end of the movie. I like plenty of movies where the protagonists are evil, and I even like a few where they’re unrepentant monsters. I like movies that show evil as perfectly banal and boring. Sadly, in an attempt to show how boring evil people can be, The Zone of Interest ends up being a movie that is pretty boring.\n\nRudolf Höss (Christian Friedel) and his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) live right next to Auschwitz, where Rudolf works. We simply see the day-to-day life of the family as we hear the horrifying events going on in the background. The sound design is phenomenal and is really the standout aspect of the film. It doesn’t show us the horrifying events, but they are ever present, and we can’t avoid them.\n\nThe messages are clear. People can live what seems to be an average life while being responsible for some truly horrible acts. There are horrible acts going on in our own backyard that we become desensitized to. These are both important and relevant messages about both the Holocaust and today’s world. It’s hard to make a compelling film out of bad people (or any people, really) simply going about their day-to-day lives. I could see this working as a short film or part of another bigger film, but as it is, the message of “evil is boring” sadly leads to a film that’s boring. However, that’s not to say that you can’t make an interesting film with the same themes and ideas. Take a look at the 2001 HBO film Conspiracy. It’s nothing but Nazi officials sitting around a table, calmly plotting genocide. It’s as horrifying as The Zone of Interest, but it’s also gripping and compelling. The dialogue is well written, and the performances are all great. I’m not saying it’s a perfect film, but it sure tackles its themes far better than The Zone of Interest.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nOverall, this is a really good year. There’s only one film in the category I outright dislike (Maestro), and even that isn’t as bad as other biopics of the last few years. Some of the films leave something to be desired, but that doesn’t mean they’re bad or that I wouldn’t recommend them. It looks like Oppenheimer is going to take Best Picture and Best Director, which is understandable. Again, it takes a “this was bad” approach to historical tragedy without making the audience dwell on it for too long. It’s right in that sweet spot the Academy loves. It’s a well-made film, so I won’t be too upset if it wins. The only other film I could see taking home the big prize is Anatomy of a Fall. It’s winning a lot of screenplay prizes and some smaller Best Picture equivalents, and it feels different enough from Oppenheimer, while still being a serious enough drama, that I could see it as a longshot. I’d be quite happy if it took home Best Picture, because I know my favorite, Killers of the Flower Moon, has no chance. Actually, I don’t really see any of the others having much of a shot. Poor Things seems to be some people’s longshot winner, but I think it has too much thematic overlap with Barbie, and it may not be original enough to merit the big win (However, this is the voting body that gave an even more racist rewrite of Driving Miss Daisy the top prize a few years ago, so maybe I’m being too generous).\n\nBest Actor seems to be a two-way race between Cillian Murphy and Paul Giamatti, with Murphy the favorite. I don’t really have a preference between those two or likely-third-place-finisher Jeffrey Wright, as they all gave strong performances. Whichever two don’t get it will get one in due time, I’m quite sure. Emma Stone and Lily Gladstone seem to be neck-and-neck for Best Actress, and while Stone gives a great performance in Poor Things, it can’t be compared to Gladstone’s stunning work in Killers of the Flower Moon. I don’t think there’s a performance in any category that compares to Gladstone’s work. It’s the kind of performance these awards are made for. The two supporting categories are locked up for Robert Downey Jr. and Da’Vine Joy Randolph respectively, the latter of which I’ll fully agree with and the former of which I’ll live with. What do you think about this year’s lineup? Leave a comment and let me know!\n\nHOME\n\nOh, Rankin/Bass, the iconic production company that brought us classic Christmas specials. like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town, and a bunch of others you haven’t heard of. Believe it or not, there are a whopping 19 specials produced by the company, with some in stop-motion and some traditionally animated. Someday, I will get around to ranking all of them, but for now, I’m going to rank all the appearances of Santa Claus in these specials. He’s not quite in all of them — they don’t awkwardly shoehorn him into Cricket on the Hearth, he wasn’t around yet in The Little Drummer Boy, he doesn’t return with Frosty in Frosty’s Winter Wonderland, and he’s not in a few others for various reasons. That leaves us with 12 specials where he makes an appearance, and his appearance and characterization are often wildly different. The most iconic versions are the grumpy one in Rudolph and the Mickey Rooney-voiced one that appears in three specials, but you might be surprised at the wide range of traits he has. Also, I’m not including his appearance in Here Comes Peter Cottontail (that’s Easter), and I’m not counting The Leprechaun’s Christmas Gold (it’s just a guy lazily dressed up like Santa). I’ll be grading each one on a scale of 0-5 on four factors: Christmas Spirit, Kindness, Appearance, and Plot Relevance. You’ll be surprised at how not-so-jolly some of them are. Let’s start at the very bottom of the barrel with…\n\n#12\n\nWe all know the classic poem “’Twas the Night Before Christmas.” It’s a staple of Christmas and established a lot of our views of the modern Santa Claus. It has been adapted a bunch of times, usually as a short because it’s — you know — short. Rankin/Bass adapted plenty of songs into half-hour or hour-long specials to varying results, so it makes sense they went after this poem. However, despite being based on a poem about the joy of seeing Santa dropping off gifts in your home, this Santa is the most petty and thin-skinned version of the character in the Rankin/Bass canon. Santa Claus has decided that he is giving up on AN ENTIRE TOWN because one child has stopped believing in him. One child! One child loses his faith in Santa Claus and publishes something about it in the local paper, which leads Santa to believe people have given up on him. Can’t he see all the children of the world? Doesn’t he know that this is just one child? Also, it’s not even a human child. It’s a mouse! One MOUSE stops believing in Santa, and the big guy gives up on the whole town.\n\nOf course, the town all comes together and welcomes back Santa, but it’s not as heartwarming as they think. When we do finally see him, he looks like this!\n\nWhy does he look like a baby in a Santa suit? He’s so tiny! With the strange beard choice, he looks more like a garden gnome than Santa Claus. I’m not saying it has to match the look of the Santas in other Rankin/Bass specials, as the traditionally animated ones really have no consistency, but this one looks terrible. Awful look. Awful story. Awful character. Worst Santa this side of a Kirk Cameron movie. You’re lucky you’re relevant to the plot, so you get a few points. I just don’t like your relevance.\n\n#11\n\nThe original classic has a lot going for it, from the songs to the low-budget charms and voice performances. It also has a particularly cruel Santa Claus. I get that the whole point of the song is others learning to be nice to Rudolph, but even the 8-minute cartoon from the ‘40s had Santa being nice to him. It was just the other reindeer that bullied him. Here, the North Pole is some kind of fascist regime where everyone gets in line or has to get out.\n\nSanta is also quite full of himself here. As soon as Rudolph is born, Santa walks into his home, sings a song about who he is, and then mocks Rudolph’s dad for his son’s red nose. Great guy. Thankfully, unlike the way most people seem to remember this, Santa does make up with Rudolph before realizing he needs him to see through the storm. It’s a heck of a lot better than abandoning an entire town because one rat doesn’t believe. For that alone, he gets the second-lowest slot, but he’s not very jolly here until the end. He just spends most of the special being thin and angry.\n\n#10\n\nHey, Rudolph just saved Christmas single-handedly. Should we celebrate him? Give him a night off? Let him spend some time with his girlfriend? Nope, he needs to save New Year’s also! On literally the same Christmas Eve, Santa gets a letter from Father Time that the Baby New Year is missing, and Santa immediately loans Rudolph out for yet another mission. When was the last time this guy slept? Why doesn’t Santa go with him? I mean, sure he’s tired, but so is Rudolph! Santa grabs Rudy and says, “Once again the happiness of all the world’s children depends on you.” Yeah great, no pressure. Why doesn’t Father Time have minions who could help? Has there never been an issue before?\n\nSanta is slightly more heroic here at least, as he does show up at the last minute to take Rudolph and company back to Father Time’s castle in what can only be described as a Santa ex machina. His personality is also much better than the previous two entries, and Rankin/Bass favorite Paul Frees does give a likable voice performance. It’s just putting way too much on the back on one reindeer.\n\n#9\n\nNow that the truly egregious ones are out of the way, it’s time to break into the section of Brief Santa Cameos (BSC). These BSCs came in stories where Santa really wasn’t needed, but he gets shoehorned in anyway because … Christmas special. The story is about Nestor, the donkey that Mary rode to Bethlehem, so what does this have to do with Santa Claus? Well, the narrator is Santa’s donkey, who is a descendant of Nestor’s.\n\n“You never knew Santa had a donkey? Well sure. Who do you think pulls Santa’s snowplow?” Um, I figured it was driven by an elf or something. “And who totes all the toy carts from one place to the other?” I don’t know; I figured maybe those magical reindeer he had! Or maybe the elves! This is a weird hierarchy at the North Pole. “Sorry, donkey, the reindeer only fly. You have to do the manual labor around here.” Is Santa just keeping this nepo donkey employed because of his connections? Maybe it’s out of the goodness of his heart, so I will award some ambiguous kindness points, I guess.\n\nWe get a brief glimpse of Santa at the beginning, and he has these dead, soulless eyes. Why didn’t they just use the same puppet as the other specials from the same era? Why is this a Nestor-specific Santa Claus? They reuse the elves from the other specials. The score may be lower overall than Shiny New Year, but I ranked this one higher since at least the awful things he does are speculative instead of on screen. Seriously though, what are those eyes?\n\n#8\n\nYes, the Rankin/Bass adaptation of A Christmas Carol explicitly has Santa Claus in it. The Ghost of Christmas Present is obviously inspired by the traditional image of Father Christmas, but making him outright look like Santa Claus by giving him a white beard is a bit excessive. “See? Do you get? Just wanted to be sure.” Also, there’s a whole song about how Santa Claus is real, and his suit turns from green to red, just to hammer it home. This special doesn’t have time to include the giving to the poor message of the original story, but hey — at least it forces a BSC. I don’t really have a score for this one, because it’s just a silent cameo, but here you have it. The most nothing appearance from Santa in one of these specials.\n\n#7\n\nSanta only has two brief appearances in this weird midquel to The Adventures of Pinocchio, but at least he’s not 1) creepy, 2) mean, or 3) dead-eyed. In one scene, Pinocchio daydreams about teaching Santa’s toys to dance, and Santa looks on happily.\n\nThen, Santa actually pops up at the end for a Santa ex machina to get Pinocchio and the cricket back home. That’s the second Santa ex machina so far, but he doesn’t have any of the negative qualities of Shiny New Year here, so he’s higher up.\n\n#6\n\nThe weirdest Rankin/Bass special out there (and there is some serious competition), Rudolph and Frosty’s Christmas in July is a huge crossover involving a bunch of beloved characters from the mythos, including the Santa Claus from Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town. Mickey Rooney returns to voice him, and of his three times playing the role, it’s the least interesting. Santa is in the special because of course he is, but he doesn’t really do anything.\n\nIn addition to this, he is exceedingly dumb. The villain, Winterbolt, does use mind control (which he just has apparently… go with it) to sway him, but even before that, Santa basically says, “Sure, trust this random wizard I’ve never heard of before who made an obvious Faustian bargain. What could go wrong?” Then, he gets lost in a storm on the way to Frosty and Rudolph, and he can’t even pull his classic Rankin/Bass Santa ex machina and save the day. Instead, he just shows up after the plot has been resolved. Great thanks. Meaningful.\n\nThat said, it’s still sweet to see Rooney reprise the role, and he still brings a lot of warmth to it. Santa and Mrs. Claus longingly look back on the events of Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town, and they talk about their love for each other. He may be dumb, but at least he’s not malicious.\n\n#5\n\nI’m guessing you haven’t heard of this. In 2001, Rankin and Bass reunited for one more Christmas special. It wasn’t a hit, and they didn’t do anymore after this one. I’m not going to act like “Santa Baby” is an unseen holiday masterpiece, but it’s charming enough. Gone is the weird high fantasy that they got obsessed with in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, and in its place is a small, family story in the vein of their classic specials. Santa himself doesn’t play too much of a part, so this may feel like another BSC, but it’s not really.\n\nThe special is about an overworked but poor dad who ends up working as a street Santa Claus, and by the end, he has to sub for the real guy on Christmas Eve. We only see a bit of the real Santa, but he’s quite jolly despite being injured, and the voice performance from… an uncredited actor is great. It’s really hard to find anything on this special, as even IMDB doesn’t know. I’m guessing it only aired once.\n\nAnyway, since the real Santa is out of commission, the bird that narrates this special turns the main character into Santa for the night, so I’m counting him too.\n\nShe literally says, “You’re the real Santa,” so I can’t argue. Like in The Santa Clause, he becomes a better father for it. It’s suggested later that it was all a dream, but so what? I’m counting it.\n\n#4\n\nStarting in the late ‘70s, Rankin/Bass got on a really weird high fantasy kick. My theory is that they adapted The Hobbit (quite well in fact), which led them to really want to make Lord of the Rings. However, Ralph Bakshi was already making an animated Lord of the Rings so they couldn’t do that. Instead, a bunch of their projects started to have wizards and dragons and other strange creatures. (They would eventually adapt Return of the King but only Return of the King). Their final Christmas special for some time was The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, based on the children’s novel by L. Frank Baum.\n\nThe biggest issue with this one is that Rankin/Bass already covered the origins of Santa Claus in Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town! I remember seeing both of these as a child and saying Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town was the real one, while Life and Adventures just didn’t count. How could he have two origin stories? Well, he does, and by the ranking here, you can tell which one is better.\n\nThis one is quite flawed and bizarre, but that’s not what I’m ranking here. I’m simply ranking the Santa, and it’s a pretty good one. Sure, the backstory is kind of odd, as he’s raised by a lioness and is granted eternal life by a wise council at the end, but he is still quite kind and giving. He apparently invents toys in this universe, which is a pretty big deal, so he definitely gets points for that. The voice isn’t as memorable as Mickey Rooney or Paul Frees, but J.D. Roth (as the young Santa) and Earl Hammond (as the adult) do alright. Unfortunately, I have to lower his “plot relevant” score because, despite being IN THE TITLE, Santa Claus is sidelined for a bit while some guy called The Great Ak fights a war with some evil creatures. Cool. Relevant to Santa.\n\n#3\n\nHe’s not in the classic song (nor is Christmas, even), but Santa fits into the story of Frosty the Snowman quite nicely. Frosty is on his way to the North Pole anyway, so it makes sense that Santa could help. Unlike the Santa ex machina situations, this one actually works.\n\nIs it ultimately a short role? Sure, but Paul Frees gives a great performance as a Santa who is both funny and sweet, and it serves the story nicely. He might regret it all, though, when all the children of the world start bringing their snowmen up to the North Pole.\n\n#2\n\nDespite what the title may suggest, Santa actually is in this one. Sure, Santa does get a bit down in the dumps when a doctor (for literally no reason beyond being a troll) says that kids don’t believe in him anymore, but this quickly passes. Mrs. Claus goes out to prove the doctor wrong, and when one of the reindeer goes missing, Santa goes after it. Using the uncreative alias of “Klaus,” Santa meets up with a family who turn him around. He’s never rude or annoying about thinking the world doesn’t need him. Instead, It’s a lot of self-doubt, and that makes his character a lot more interesting. Plus, he is sick at the beginning, so that might be affecting his brain. It may feel a bit out of character to some, but this one is held in pretty high esteem today. It may not have the same classic status as Frosty, Rudolph, or Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town, but it is fondly remembered.\n\nMickey Rooney gives his second voice performance as Santa here, and he’s just as good as the first time. There’s a real lived-in quality to his performance this time around, which fits this wearier version of the character. Pretty much every voice actor on this list at least does fine, but Rooney has the most dimension to his voice work. The downbeat nature of the beginning of the special only makes the heartwarming ending work even more. What he lacks in Christmas spirit early in the special, he makes up for with everything else.\n\n#1\n\nCould it really be anything else? Yeah, no surprises for the number one slot here. There have been multiple attempts at an origin story for Santa Claus over the years, but this still seems to be the definitive one in pop culture, and for good reason. While there are understandably fantasy elements in play here, it doesn’t try to be more than it is.\n\nDespite the fantasy elements, it portrays a Santa whose defining trait is kindness. He warms the hearts of children and adults alike over the course of the film, including Jessica, the future Mrs. Claus. Of course, it can’t work on everyone, and the villainous Burgermeister Meisterburger is constantly in his way. However, in a surprising touch of nuance, the villain is neither defeated nor reformed; the people just take to Santa’s way instead, and the Burgermeister falls out of power because no one cares about him. By the end of the special, Santa essentially passes into legend, and the narrator tells us we should all be more giving.\n\nIt’s rare to see Santa as a younger man, but Mickey Rooney’s voice performance really makes us believe this is the guy who will become the Santa we know. Mickey Rooney was 50 here, but he is incredibly convincing as both the young Kris Kringle for most of the movie, and the older Kris he plays at the end here and in the later specials. Of all the various Santas we see over these specials, this one looks the most classic by the end too.\n\nWell, there you have it. If you haven’t seen some of these weirder specials and you want something different, maybe check them out. Don’t check out ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas, though. Be better to yourself than that. I hope your holidays are wonderful!\n\nHOME\n\nIn the first part, I took a look at the first three films in Stanley Kramer’s decade of message films—The Defiant Ones, On the Beach, and Inherit the Wind. In this second part, I’ll be taking a look at the four final films of the period, and theorizing as to what caused his decline as an A-list filmmaker.\n\nJUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG\n\nAfter his success with Inherit the Wind, Stanley Kramer decided to make another courtroom drama. Like Inherit the Wind, Judgment at Nuremberg was based on a real-life event (The Nuremberg Judges Trials), but the names and details were changed to fit the story. Kramer’s third consecutive film based on existing source material, Judgment at Nuremberg was originally a 1959 episode of Playhouse 90 of the same name, written by Abby Mann, who also wrote the film’s screenplay.\n\nIt might seem uninspired that Kramer would follow one courtroom drama immediately with another, especially seeing as how both films even star Spencer Tracy in a lead role, but Nuremberg and Inherit the Wind are different beasts altogether. Inherit the Wind deals with serious issues, but it often uses humor to point out hypocrisies, while Judgment at Nuremberg is, as fits the subject material, gravely serious.\n\nAfter World War II, the highest-ranking Nazis were dead or had fled the country, and Judgment at Nuremberg is based on the trials of the judges who upheld Nazi law.\n\nAll of Kramer’s films had big-name stars in the cast, but Nuremberg really went above and beyond, with many stars taking lower salaries because they believed in the film. Nuremberg featured great actors like Spencer Tracy, Maximilian Schell, Burt Lancaster, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Montgomery Clift, Richard Widmark and even bad actors like William Shatner. Schell was actually not a big star yet, but he reprised his role from the Playhouse 90 episode, and this is the film that made him one.\n\nUnlike Inherit the Wind where he played a noble, crusading lawyer, Judgment at Nuremberg sees Spencer Tracy in the role of the everyman. Tracy plays Dan Heywood, an American judge who is called in to be one of the three judges presiding over the Nuremberg trials. He’s something of a moderate, stating that he’s a Republican who greatly admired Franklin Roosevelt, and he doesn’t go into the trial with pre-conceived notions. He becomes friendly with Frau Berholt (Marlene Dietrich) but questions having a relationship with her as the trial goes on.\n\nIt’s an incredibly subdued performance from Tracy, but he really sells it, and his ten-minute speech at the end is both earned and compelling.\n\nMaximilian Schell plays attorney Hans Rolfe, who is arguing the case for the four defendants (Burt Lancaster, Werner Klemperer, Torben Meyer, Martin Brandt). Rolfe delivers passionate, emotional arguments that really seem to work on the judges at first, but grow thin as the trial goes on. It’s not that he’s all style and no substance, as he does make valid points about the hypocrisy of the rest of the world, but it’s clear he’s making semantic arguments that work best when you don’t really think long and hard about them. Schell is truly an imposing presence, from his towering height and dark hair, to his flowing black robe that almost resembles a villainous cape.\n\nOn the side of the prosecution is Col. Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), who has seen the horrors of war and wants the guilty punished. There’s such a cliche to portray a military figure as the most conservative, right wing figure in the film, so I find it interesting that they went a different direction with Lawson. He’s clearly broken by seeing the concentration camps he helped liberate, but he also doesn’t want the US to quickly enter another war. Plenty of people involved in the case want the judges to go easy on Germany so they’ll be an ally in the upcoming Cold War, but Lawson outright says “We’re not cut out to be occupiers.” The film was made in 1961, so a character in 1948 saying this was meant to be insightful, but looking at it 60 years later, perhaps Kramer and screenwriter Abby Mann didn’t realize just how insightful.\n\nCol. Lawson is perhaps the most perfect example of righteous anger ever portrayed on screen. There are times he can’t keep his cool, because he knows that Rolfe is winning people over with his showy arguments, and all of that anger boils over.\n\nIt all makes sense when we see Lawson take the stand himself and testify about what he saw firsthand at the concentration camps. All of the performances in this film are great, but personally, I find Widmark’s the most interesting, and the character of Lawson to be one of the best characters in any of Kramer’s films.\n\nThere are also short but impactful performances by Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, who play Germans victimized in different ways. Clift’s Rudolph Peterson was sterilized by the Nazis for what is implied to be a mental disability. Clift was in quite bad shape, due to a 1956 car crash and his drug and alcohol dependency, and he knew he wouldn’t be able to remember long passages of dialogue. However Kramer, the great director of actors that he was, eventually realized he could work with this, as it fit the nervousness and discomfort of Clift’s character on the stand.\n\nWidmark is again fantastic here, as his character’s sympathy towards a nervous witness can easily be interpreted as the actor’s sympathy towards a nervous actor.\n\nGarland is also brilliant as Irene Hoffman, a German who was friends with a Jewish man who was executed for associating with her.\n\nIt’s clear that Irene Hoffman is already living with misplaced guilt over her father figure being executed, and while she doesn’t want to testify about it again, she knows it’s what has to be done. Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), one of the defendants, was the judge who handed down the verdict, and it’s Janning who interrupts Rolfe’s interrogation of her, as he can’t stand to see her break down again.\n\nOf the four defendants, the only one who gets a lot of focus is Janning, a highly respected judge and scholar who remained a judge under Nazi rule. What makes Janning unique among the defendants is that he recognizes his own guilt, and agrees with the life sentence handed down to him at the end. A recurring theme of the film, and perhaps the most important theme of the film, is German citizens denying that they knew just how bad the Nazis were. The first people to argue this are Judge Haywood’s hosts (Ben Wright, Virginia Christie) but it’s clear they were fully onboard with the Nazi ideology and are now trying to save face. Marlene Dietrich’s character tries to say the same thing about herself, but it’s clear that she too isn’t being entirely honest. The third person to do this is Janning in the film’s final scene. After admitting his guilt, Janning pathetically tries to argue that he couldn’t have known just how bad things would get, but Haywood shuts him down. The film does not have time for self-proclaimed well-meaning people who couldn’t do more. Janning admits some of the wrong he’s done, but he ends the film whimpering and making excuses, showing that he does not grasp the true depth of his guilt.\n\nIt’s clear that with this film Kramer was showing the danger of going easy on fascists, as the end titles show that no one sentenced at Nuremberg was still serving out their sentence. It’s a pretty straightforward film, with most of it spent in a courtroom, but it’s incredibly acted and very effective, even if it doesn’t quite have the “x factor” that Inherit the Wind had.\n\nAt the Oscars that year, Judgment at Nuremberg received 11 nominations, tying with West Side Story. Tracy and Schell were both up for Best Actor, Garland was up for Best Supporting Actress, Clift for Supporting Actor (Widmark was still snubbed somehow), Abby Mann for Best Adapted Screenplay, Kramer for Best Director, and the film itself was a top contender for Best Picture. Maximilian Schell, the break-out star of the film won Best Actor, and Mann won the screenplay prize, and in plenty of other years, this would have been Kramer’s chance to sweep, but it was up against the even better West Side Story (If they’re even able to be compared), which won Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno) and Supporting Actor (George Chakiris).\n\nIT’S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD\n\nAfter the bleak Judgment at Nuremberg, Kramer wanted to make something light, so in true Kramer fashion, he went all out and made the silliest film of all time, collaborating with screenwriters William and Tania Rose. 1963’s It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World is 2 hours and 41 minutes (or 3 hours and 12 minutes… or 3 hours and 17 minutes… or 3 hours and 30 minutes depending on your cut) of utter ridiculousness with every comedic actor you can imagine popping up at some point.\n\nIn the lead roles alone, you have Milton Berle, Ethel Merman, Sid Caesar, Edie Adams, Jonathan Winters, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett, Dorothy Provine and Spencer Tracy. Along the way, they meet Terry-Thomas, Phil Silvers, Dick Shawn, Jim Backus, Peter Falk, and Eddie “Rochester” Anderson, with everyone from Buster Keaton to the Three Stooges making cameos. Whether this wild parade of stars helps the film’s comedy or distracts from it has been debated for years.\n\nThe plot of Mad Mad World is obviously secondary to the antics, so it’s a pretty simple one. Before a gangster (Jimmy Durante) dies, he tells the motorists who witness it that he buried $350,000 under a big W in Santa Rosita State Park.\n\nAt first they discuss working together and splitting the money equally, but they can’t decide on shares and decide to race each other there instead.\n\nKramer’s previous films, particularly Nuremberg and On the Beach, had similar packed casts of famous actors, but it’s clear that regardless of their star power, they slipped perfectly into their roles. Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift might not be your first choices for “German citizens broken by the Nazi regime,” but it’s hard to argue against their performances. Some of the actors in Mad Mad World fit their roles like a glove, while others feel like they’re in the film as part of a cinematic Where’s Waldo game.\n\nFor the most part, the principal actors work. I enjoy Sid Caesar and Edie Adams as the down-to-earth couple of the bunch who just gets pushed too far, and Caesar is quite a good straight man to all the zany comedy.\n\nEthel Merman is perfect as Milton Berle’s loud and overbearing mother-in-law who is just as greedy as the men, and Jonathan Winters creates some of the film’s most memorable moments as dopey furniture mover Lennie Pike. The supporting cast fill their roles well too (Anderson and Falk as the cab drivers are quite enjoyable), but as for the cameos, it gets to be a bit tedious. They’re not always even doing anything particularly funny, but you just recognize them. It’s the ’60s equivalent of a parody film just referencing other films, with the audience laughing because they understand the reference. Is there any reason for the Three Stooges to pop up as firefighters except for the audience to identify them as the Three Stooges? They don’t do anything besides just stand there!\n\nYou pretty much just have to accept Mad Mad World for what it is—a 2 1/2 hour (or 3 hour… or 3 1/2 hour) Looney Tunes cartoon. It’s ridiculous and overblown and is jam-packed with silliness, but also… there’s a reason Looney Tunes cartoons were only seven minutes long instead of 170 minutes. You can only have so many slapstick expressions and prop gags before it just feels tired. I guess it really depends on what kind of comedy you prefer, as this is very obvious physical, slapstick comedy which just isn’t really my thing. It’s a well-made movie and I can enjoy the ride, but it won’t be my personal favorite.\n\nDespite being wildly different from his other films, Mad Mad World still features all the Kramerisms you’d see in his other films of this era. It starts and ends with the song “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,” obviously written for the film, and features a score by Ernest Gold and cinematography (in color for once) by Ernest Laszlo, and while it may not be a serious film in any sense, it still deals with American greed, as literally every problem in the film could have been averted if the characters just worked together.\n\nMad Mad World was an enormous success at the box office, and it inspired plenty of other high budget, star-studded, two-hour-plus comedies like The Great Race, Scavenger Hunt, and Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, but none of these ever had the same success as Mad Mad World. It’s kind of hard to one-up the biggest comedy of all time. At the Oscars, it was nominated for a bunch of technical awards, but as to be expected, it wasn’t up for any acting, screenwriting, or directing awards.\n\nStanley Kramer could have taken his good will from Mad Mad World and spent the rest of his career as a respected comedic director, but he opted instead to go back to the serious drama he was known for. However, his next film would still draw from his big budget ensemble comedy.\n\nSHIP OF FOOLS\n\nKramer’s 1965 film Ship of Fools took a bit from both of his previous two films. Like Mad Mad World, it was an ensemble piece with countless actors and no discernible protagonist. Like Judgment at Nuremberg, Kramer teamed with screenwriter Abby Mann to tell a story about the normalization of fascism, this time set before World War II. Like both of these films, Ship of Fools is quite long.\n\nSet in 1933 on an ocean liner traveling from Mexico to Germany, Ship of Fools tells multiple, interconnected stories over the course of the trip, with many involving the rise of fascism in Germany. Among these, we have the ship’s medic Dr. Schumann (Oskar Werner) and his flirtation and romance with a countess (Simone Signoret), the extremely anti-Semitic Siegfried Rieber (Jose Ferrer) and his various virulent interactions with passengers, a rich woman trying to feel young again (Vivien Leigh), an angry American ex-baseball player (Lee Marvin), and a host of others.\n\nThere are undeniably some interesting ideas in Ship of Fools, particularly the way it portrays a world that is unaware of what it’s about to go through and the way in which people (particularly the rich) don’t take threats seriously, but the themes are muddled and get lost in the countless number of silly side plots and romance arcs. When the film’s darker themes do pop up, they’re handled in an incredibly unsubtle way. For example, at one point, a Jewish German character doesn’t take the anti-Semitism of Rieber very seriously, outright saying “What are they going to do, kill all of us?”\n\nAll of Kramer’s other films from this period, even the weaker ones, were always immensely watchable. Even the longest ones, like Judgment at Nuremberg which hit the three-hour mark, always kept the viewer invested in what was going on. Ship of Fools is the only one that I struggled to get through. The romance between Dr. Schumann and the countess was enjoyable to watch, but honestly that was about it.\n\nIf 1967 was the year everything changed in Hollywood (and we’ll get to that with Kramer’s next film), 1965 was the year everyone realized the current model wasn’t working. With the rise of TV, filmmakers were concerned that filmgoers were losing interest in going to the movies, so they made increasingly extravagant spectacles loaded with stars (see It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World), enormous set pieces, and lengthy runtimes. In 1954, the highest-grossing films were White Christmas (2 hours), The Caine Mutiny (2 hours, 5 minutes), and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (2 hours, 7 minutes). Just two years later in 1956, the highest-grossing films were The Ten Commandments (3 hours, 40 minutes), Around the World in 80 Days (3 hours, 2 minutes), and Giant (3 hours, 17 minutes). For the next few years, epics were the big thing, with films like Spartacus, Ben-Hur, and Exodus being major hits. However, by the mid ’60s, the epics era was fading. How the West Was Won was wildly miscast, Cleopatra almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox, and the exorbitant The Fall of the Roman Empire bombed at the box office.\n\nBy 1965, the epic was hanging on by a thread, with The Greatest Story Ever Told being laughably tacky and desperate (John Wayne as a Roman Centurion?) and even David Lean’s Doctor Zhivago being nowhere near as acclaimed as his previous efforts like Lawrence of Arabia and The Bridge on the River Kwai. Ship of Fools wasn’t exactly an epic, as it was 2 1/2 hours, in black-and-white, and didn’t cover a long period of time, but a lot of the gimmick was still there. Come see all of these stars romancing each other… on a boat!\n\nThe Academy wasn’t quite as forward-thinking as the viewing public, as Ship of Fools was up for a whopping eight nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Werner), Best Actress (Signoret), Best Supporting Actor (Michael Dunn), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Costume Design, and winning for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Of Kramer’s films from this period, Ship of Fools is the least-talked-about today, and that’s for good reason. It was the dull display of a failing studio system.\n\n1967 would be a year packed with successful and important films, and Kramer would be in the conversation one last time. His final film of this period is perhaps both his greatest legacy and the most obvious display of his flaws.\n\nGUESS WHO’S COMING TO DINNER\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Stanley Kramer without talking about his final film of this era—Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner. For his final message film, Kramer took on the issue of interracial marriage, which was undeniably at the forefront of society, as Loving v. Virginia made it legal nationwide just weeks after the film’s premiere.\n\nIn addition to taking on a serious issue, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner is the last film of Spencer Tracy’s career, who was in failing health but agreed to do the movie when he heard what it was about.\n\nKatharine Hepburn did the same, and she and Kramer both put up the money to cover the losses if Tracy died before production wrapped. In addition to Tracy and Hepburn, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner reunited Kramer with The Defiant Ones star Sidney Poitier, who had an extremely successful decade, including an Oscar win for Lilies of the Field. With all of these factors working in the film’s favor, it’s really a shame that it isn’t very good.\n\nKramer and screenwriter William Rose wrote the screenplay in just four weeks… and it shows. They felt so impassioned to write a movie about a serious issue that they didn’t bother to write a real story about it. Matt and Christina Drayton (Tracy and Hepburn) are a wealthy liberal couple living in California, whose worldview is tested when their daughter Joey (Hebpurn’s nice Katharine Houghton) comes home with her Black fiancé Dr. John Wade Prentice (Poitier).\n\nWe’re told that Joey and John have fallen head-over-heels for each other on vacation, but we don’t actually see any of this. We see all of one kiss… in the rearview mirror of a taxi… in the opening moments of the film.\n\nI hate to fall back on something as cliched as “Show don’t tell,” because there are plenty of brilliant films that break every rule, but a series of conversations about two people being in love does not a romantic film make. Even if it’s just the first act of the film, or even just a few flashbacks, show us how these two people met! John has apparently never loved another woman since his wife and son died years ago, but he immediately fell in love with Joey and vice versa.\n\nKramer wanted to make sure that there was nothing that could make Matt and Christina oppose the marriage except for John’s race, so he went out of his way to write a character that was impossible to dislike unless you were a racist. I’m just going to do list off all of the ways in which they make John a near-perfect potential spouse and son-in-law.\n\nHe’s played by the strikingly handsome Sidney Poitier.\n\nHe’s a doctor, so he’s well-off, but he also does work with the World Health Organization, so he’s charitable.\n\nHe’s been married before and had a child, showing he’ll be a good parent.\n\nHe is extremely deferential to the Draytons, and will end his allegedly whirlwind romance if he does not receive their blessing.\n\nHe leaves money for the Draytons for his long distance call to his parents.\n\nHe has refused to have sex with Joey despite her wishes.\n\nJohn exists not as a character, but more as a checklist for white audiences to make sure all of their questions are answered. While one can understand the desire on Kramer’s part to make sure racism is the only thing standing in the way, nothing exists in a vacuum. Many viewers have pointed out that there are still things that aren’t race-related that could stand in the way, like the fact that the two have only known each other for ten days, or the 14-year age difference between John and Joey (She’s only 23). In addition, going out of the way to show John this way while giving Joey almost no discernible characteristics ends up leaving some viewers to think that Kramer thinks it takes a near-perfect Black man to marry a white woman, which isn’t really equality at all.\n\nIn addition, the film goes out of its way to show that John’s father (Roy E. Glenn, Sr.) is just as opposed to the marriage as Matt, and even more so as time goes on. If I’m being generous, this exists to give John a bit of character development as he has to stand up to his father, but it seems to come from a place of “See, Black people can be racist too.”\n\nEven at the end of the film, his father still isn’t comfortable with the marriage, but it does suggest he’ll get there. At least his mother (Beah Richards) is much more open-minded about it. That said, John Sr. is not the most uncomfortable character in the film.\n\nFor a film that is about destroying racial stereotypes, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner does something that is unforgiveable. In the character of Tillie, the film takes a racist stock character and does absolutely nothing with it.\n\nIf you want to read more about the “Mammy” stock character, I recommend reading this article by Dr. David Pilgrim and listening to Karina Longworth’s Six Degrees of Song of the South series on her podcast You Must Remember This, where she breaks down Hattie McDaniel’s career of playing these characters. Essentially, the character was a Black servant (A slave if pre-Civil War, a maid if post) who was often middle-aged or elderly, overweight, had entirely no character outside of her relation to the white protagonists, and was completely happy in her life of servitude (even if she did get some snarky lines in now and then). Hattie McDaniel’s character in Gone with the Wind is probably the most famous version of this, but is also a more fleshed-out example than most. Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner has one of these, and it plays the stock character entirely straight.\n\nObviously, the Draytons are well-off, so the idea of them having a maid is perfectly logical, and the maid being a Person of Color is not the problem. It’s the way that the film leans so heavily into caricature, like Kramer thought that the maids portrayed in Hollywood films were an accurate representation of life, when in reality it was just white writers creating Black characters they were comfortable with. Tillie (Isabel Sanford) is portrayed as perfectly happy in her life, and she has no discernible characterization outside of making comments about other people’s lives. She’s extremely judgmental of Joey, saying she raised her, and she yells at John for wanting to marry a white woman. Does she just… not have any of her own issues to deal with? At one point, in relation to the impending nuptials, she even says “Civil Rights is one thing…” as if to suggest Black people have come far enough and this is a step too far!\n\nAt the end of the film when Matt brings everybody together to give his final decision, he introduces Tillie to John’s parents as “a member of this family for 22 years.” This is the same language slave owners used to justify how well they treated their slaves! You say she’s a member of your family, but what have you done to get to know her? What is her family life and personal life like? Why does she have no character in this film outside of serving white people?\n\nOf course, there are things to admire in Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner as well, as its general acclaim and awards nominations showed. Katharine Hepburn is quite good as Christina Drayton, showing a closer-to-earth sensibility than her husband, and Tracy is solid, although his age and generally-weakened state are pretty obvious (He’s 67 and looks 80.). There are some very genuine moments between the two of them that feel true-to-life for a couple who has been together so long, and for some, this is the real draw of the film. I also enjoy Matt’s relationship with Monsignor Mike Ryan (Cecil Kellaway), especially because Matt isn’t Catholic or particularly religious at all, and yet the two men respect each other greatly as friends. Mike has no qualms about interracial marriage, and he has even heard of John and greatly respects his work.\n\nAlso, despite it not being portrayed too well, the film does at least try to show that racism isn’t just a deep south issue. White well-meaning liberals may have some prejudice deep down that they’ve really never dealt with or thought about (Get Out of course looked at and deconstructed this to hell and back in 2017.).\n\nGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner was a massive success at the box office, even in the south where it led to changes in the ways films were marketed. At the Academy Awards, it was equally successful, receiving nominations down the board, including Best Picture, Best Director for Kramer, Best Actor (posthumous) for Tracy, Best Actress for Hepburn, Best Supporting Actor for Kellaway, Best Supporting Actress for Richards, Screenplay, Art Direction, Editing, and Score. Hepburn would ultimately win for Best Actress, and William Rose took home Best Original Screenplay (somehow).\n\n1967 was the year that ushered in a new era of movies, and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner showed both the Hollywood that was changing and the Hollywood that was being left behind. It dealt with a serious, pressing topic, but unlike the other films that were coming out, it was a low-key, stagey, and rather boring affair. It was obviously shot on soundstages, and even some of the acting feels rather screwball at times.\n\nA lot of people blame Bonnie and Clyde for Kramer’s period as an A-list director coming to an end, and I think that definitely played a part. The story goes that Kramer felt he had just had his biggest success, and he went on a tour of colleges to talk about his craft. However, all the students wanted to talk about was the visceral, violent and exciting Bonnie and Clyde. Another obvious candidate is the fact that Spencer Tracy, Kramer’s partner-in-crime, was dead. Obviously Kramer had made moves in this period without him, but the two men had a special working relationship that could never be replicated.\n\nBoth of these facts definitely played a part in his fall, but I think there was one more factor, another film that came out in 1967, that made Stanley Kramer realize his glory days were over. That film was In the Heat of the Night.\n\nThere’s a perhaps apocryphal (and definitely exaggerated) story that the first time The Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson heard The Beatles’ “Strawberry Fields Forever,” he abandoned his Smile album, because “Strawberry Fields” had done everything he was hoping to do with Smile, and I wonder if Kramer felt the same way after seeing In the Heat of the Night. I’ve never read what Kramer thought of Norman Jewison’s film In the Heat of the Night, but I would have to guess it was a combination of admiration and frustration. Here was a film that had the social conscience of all of his films, while telling a more compelling story than he had ever told. In the Heat of the Night had the interracial partnership of The Defiant Ones, the hot, sweaty deep south of Inherit the Wind, the brilliant performances and character work that Kramer always strived for, and it even had Sidney Poitier. It was the greatest Stanley Kramer film that Stanley Kramer never made, and perhaps a film he was unable to make.\n\nOn a hot night in September, businessman Phillip Colbert is murdered in the small town of Sparta, Mississippi. The police officer who discovers the murder, Sam Wood (Warren Oates), discovers a Black man at the train station and arrests him for the murder with no evidence, besides the fact that Colbert’s wallet was taken and the man, Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), has money in his wallet.\n\nIn Tibbs’ first interaction with Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger), we learn everything we need to know about Gillespie’s character. He is undeniably a racist, like almost everyone in the town, but he is also more intelligent than all of the other officers around him.\n\nHe has no problem throwing racial slurs around, but he is also livid when he discovers that Sam has arrested a man without any evidence. The film isn’t afraid to depict racism as a systemic problem, as it doesn’t show a “good white person” on the police force who hates the racism of the town, but instead shows Gillespie as being constantly surrounded by racist Barney Fifes.\n\nWhen Gillespie discovers that Tibbs is not only a police detective, but the best police detective in Philadelphia, he convinces him to stay and help him solve the murder. Unlike Dr. John Prentice, Poitier’s Virgil Tibbs is a three-dimensional human character.\n\nLike Prentice he’s a brilliant man and good at what he does, but he doesn’t exist as a checklist to make white audiences comfortable. At one point, he understandably gets too hung up on investigating Endicott, a suspect who treated him horribly, but when Gillespie calls him on this, he admits his mistake. The film, however, does not portray Tibbs’s suspicion of Endicott because Endicott is racist as equal to Sam Wood’s suspicion of Tibbs because Sam is racist. One is understandable, one is unforgivable. Also, Tibbs’ main motivation for staying and solving the murder isn’t to help people out of the goodness of his heart, but to show them what he’s truly capable of and embarrass the racists. He’s proud of what he can do, and we love him for it.\n\nFurthermore, Gillespie’s character arc is far more believable than Joker’s in The Defiant Ones. Like that film, In the Heat of the Night only takes place over a few days, and Gillespie undeniably learns a lot in that time. He is getting there by the end, even carrying Tibbs’ suitcase to the train station for him, but the film goes out of its way to make him meeting and working with Tibbs not be some kind of miracle cure. When Gillespie meets Tibbs, he mockingly asks what they call him in Philadelphia, and he replies with the famous proclamation, “They call me Mister Tibbs!” However, it’s noteworthy that even by the end of the film, Gillespie calls him “Virgil” as he gets on the train to leave.\n\nHe has moved past the slurs of course, but he’s not at the point where he can call the man what he wants to be called. Also, Virgil coming to town doesn’t make the town as a whole any more forward thinking, and in fact, the murder of Colbert has probably set them back. This is the environment Gillespie will have to continue to live and work in.\n\nUnlike the stagey and formal Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, In the Heat of the Night is visceral and hard-hitting, gorgeously shot on location (albeit mostly in Sparta, Illinois). You really get the feel of those hot southern summer nights where no one can get comfortable because they’re just sweating so much. I’m not saying that every movie needs to put characters’ lives in danger to be good or even exciting, but we feel thrown right into the middle of this film, while we’re always an outside observer in Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.\n\nAt the Oscars, it was In the Heat of the Night that would take home Best Picture, as well as other awards including Best Actor for Steiger. I don’t like the simplicity of asking if a film “holds up” today, because every film is a product of its time, but I will say that In the Heat of the Night is incredibly relevant today, and it feels both very important to its time and utterly timeless. For me personally, it’s still the best film of 1967.\n\nKramer would go on to direct a few more films, but none would have the success of even the least-successful film of this period. Seriously, can you name one without looking? There may be a part three to this sometime where I finally get around to watching them, but they really aren’t considered a major part of his legacy in any way.\n\nThat said, what is the legacy of Stanley Kramer? It’s clear that he wanted to push filmmaking forward, and in a way he did, but in an era where things were changing fast, it seemed that perhaps Kramer wasn’t pushing fast enough. If Kramer had started as a director ten years earlier, these films could have felt a lot more innovative and progressive (Imagine Judgment at Nuremberg in 1951 or Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner in 1957), but the longer he went, the more behind-the-curve his films felt. That said, he still wanted to deal with important issues, and he valued film as a medium that could make people take a look at their own views. Once again, I cannot stress enough what a great director of actors Kramer was, and he really cared about getting great performances out of everyone, from the A-listers to the day-players. Sometimes his skills came together to create truly great films, particularly Inherit the Wind, while sometimes he got in the way of himself. However, for a space of ten years, he got to make films exactly as he wanted to make them, and for the most part, they were well-received.\n\nHOME\n\nSince the early days of film, filmmakers have struggled to find the balance between their story and their message. Sure, there are always filmgoers who will say they don’t like when movies “get political,” but that usually just implies the movie is making them think about something they don’t want to. Every movie has something to say, whether directly or indirectly, and even if there doesn’t seem to be a message, you can assume the filmmakers think the status quo isn’t all that bad.\n\nIn his ten-year run from 1958-1967, director Stanley Kramer made what came to be known as “message pictures,” movies that covered all kinds of social issues like racism, Antisemitism, nuclear war, American greed, the rise of fascism, the fall of fascism, McCarthyism, and anti-intellectualism. To his admirers, he was a groundbreaking director, daring to take on topics others shied away from. To his critics, he was preachy and old-fashioned. Regardless, for ten years, Stanley Kramer was one of the most successful directors in Hollywood, with every film from that period receiving positive critical reception and multiple Oscar nominations. I want to take a look at each of these films and see what made his rise so prominent and his fall so abrupt.\n\nPRE-1958\n\nStanley Kramer was born in Manhattan in 1913, and—perhaps unsurprisingly—originally planned to go to law school. However, he was offered a writing internship with 20th Century Fox, and that was that. He was drafted into World War II, where he faced Antisemitism from a bigoted captain, and after the war, he rose through the ranks to become one of Hollywood’s most respected producers. Among the films he produced before taking the director’s chair were Home of the Brave (dealing with racism in the military), The Men (Marlon Brando’s debut), High Noon, and The Caine Mutiny.\n\nIn 1955, Kramer started directing films as well. His first two films, 1955’s Not as a Stranger and 1957’s The Pride and the Passion were financially successful, but it was his next film that really put him on the map as a director.\n\nTHE DEFIANT ONES\n\nThe first of Kramer’s message films, The Defiant Ones is a story of two chain gang prisoners in the Deep South, one white and one Black, chained together. When the prison transport crashes, the two prisoners, John “Joker” Jackson (Tony Curtis) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) go on the run.\n\nImmediately, this movie tips us off to some of Stanley Kramer’s favorite techniques. Instead of a score, the opening credits play over a spiritual version of the W.C. Handy song “Long Gone.” Every film of Kramer’s from this era would begin with a song and would usually close with the same one.\n\nWe also see Kramer’s famous against-type casting. Tony Curtis was looking to break out of his good looking leading man typecast, and had started to do it in 1957 with the masterful Sweet Smell of Success, and continued it by portraying a southern prisoner here. Robert Mitchum was the original choice for the role, but since he had worked on a chain gang in his youth, he found the idea of Black and white prisoners chained together in the Deep South, even as a warden’s joke, beyond the suspension of disbelief. While Curtis gives a fine performance, he’s not entirely convincing as a southerner, and one can see where Mitchum would have been better in the role.\n\nThat said, Tony Curtis really believed in the movie and both raised money for the budget and insisted Sidney Poitier recei"
