        "text": "What in the world is this?\n\nA cheap DVD at an expensive price? Extremely bad art? No heart or warmth? BURT REYNOLDS? We can't really tell you what it is, but we can tell you what it is NOT. It is not a quality RANKIN/BASS Holiday special on DVD and RANKIN/BASS had nothing to do with this project. I know Mom always said...If you have nothing good to say, don't say it at all. Well, we thought the fans of RANKIN/BASS should see this. We definitely had nothing good to say BUT we had to say something!\n\nDon't forget to order your Rankin/Bass merchandise in time for this holiday season!
