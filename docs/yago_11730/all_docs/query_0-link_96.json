        "text": "01 of 30\n\n“The Muppet Christmas Carol” (1992)\n\nIt's time to get Christmas started with a most sensational, inspirational, Muppet-filled adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol. In this feature-length musical, Michael Caine takes the lead role of Ebenezer Scrooge, the grasping old miser who needs a night full of visiting spirits to help him develop a capacity for friendship and joy. The familiar Muppet characters enliven the sometimes gloomy story — especially Gonzo and Rizzo, who act as squabbling narrators. Kermit and Miss Piggy are paired as Mr. and Mrs. Cratchit, with little Robin the Frog as Tiny Tim. The film is a perfect mix of jokes, scares, songs, and sentiment.\n\nWhere to watch The Muppet Christmas Carol: Disney+\n\nDirector: Brian Henson\n\nCast: Michael Caine, Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Frank Oz\n\nRelated content: The Muppets sit down with Brett Goldstein to reminisce about making The Muppet Christmas Carol\n\n02 of 30\n\n“Elf” (2003)\n\nIn this hilarious Christmas comedy, Will Ferrell plays Buddy, a misplaced boy who grew up at the North Pole as one of Santa's elves. Buddy feels out of place in the workshop as a fully-grown adult who's terrible at making toys — and when he learns that he's actually human, he travels to New York City to find the father who gave him up for adoption. Buddy's sugar-sweet demeanor clashes with the real world to great comic effect. Classic scenes include a wild snowball fight and a mad scramble when Buddy angrily unmasks a department store Santa Claus.\n\nWhere to watch Elf: Max\n\nDirector: Jon Favreau\n\nCast: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner\n\nRelated content: Jon Favreau says he's not interested in making an Elf sequel\n\n03 of 30\n\n“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” (1964)\n\nThe stop-motion animation wizards at Rankin/Bass Productions contribute several Christmas specials to this list, and Rudolph is the most special of all. A little reindeer is bullied and excluded for having a glowing red nose, but he finds a friend in another outcast: Hermey the Elf, who left Santa's workshop to become a dentist. The pair's struggle to be accepted as they are is just as timely now as it was in the 1960s, and their trip to the Island of Misfit Toys is unforgettable. It's a nostalgic treat for parents to share with a new generation.\n\nWhere to watch Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: Amazon Prime Video (to buy)\n\nDirector: Larry Roemer\n\nCast: Burl Ives, Billie Mae Richards, Paul Soles\n\nRelated content: 3 things that make Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer so special\n\n04 of 30\n\n“It's a Wonderful Life” (1946)\n\nThis vintage Christmastime fable highlights how important each person can be to their family, friends, and community. George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) is stuck in a small town with a failing business wishing that he had never been born, and Clarence (Henry Travers), his guardian angel, is eager to earn his wings by helping George appreciate how many lives he's touched. This bittersweet movie digs deep into the joys of young love, the responsibilities of adulthood, and the effort it takes to remain honest in an unkind world. The triumphant finale, when George discovers his true worth, is a guaranteed heartwarmer.\n\nWhere to watch It's a Wonderful Life: AppleTV+\n\nDirector: Frank Capra\n\nCast: Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers\n\nRelated content: How It's a Wonderful Life devised a new form of fake snow that revolutionized the medium\n\n05 of 30\n\n“The Santa Clause” (1994)\n\nIt's the night before Christmas, and Santa's annual trip is interrupted when he accidentally falls off an icy roof. Scott Calvin (Tim Allen), a divorced dad who owns the roof in question, finds himself stuck with the job of delivering the remaining presents. Scott and his son Charlie visit the North Pole, where he's informed by the elves that he has a year to become the new Santa Claus. A reluctant Scott gradually takes on the appearance and powers of the legendary figure, but when his custody arrangement is threatened, he has to heal the rifts in his broken family as well.\n\nWhere to watch The Santa Clause: Disney+\n\nDirector: John Pasquin\n\nCast: Tim Allen, Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson\n\nRelated content: Tim Allen talks working with his real-life daughter on The Santa Clauses\n\n06 of 30\n\n“How the Grinch Stole Christmas” (1966)\n\nThis classic story from beloved children's author Dr. Seuss is brought to life with hilarious animation by Warner Brothers director Chuck Jones. In this special, the Grinch, a holiday-hating supervillain with a heart two sizes too small, is determined to stamp out the cheery festivities in the nearby town of Whoville. Disguising himself as a felonious Santa, the Grinch grabs presents, decorations, and the Christmas feast, leaving the Whos with nothing to celebrate but each other. Kids will love the catchy song \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\" and the furious, infectious joy the scoundrel takes in spoiling everyone's holiday season.\n\nWhere to watch How the Grinch Stole Christmas: Peacock\n\nDirector: Chuck Jones, Ben Washam\n\nCast: Boris Karloff, June Foray, Thurl Ravenscroft\n\nRelated content: How the Grinch Stole Christmas is getting a sequel book not by Dr. Seuss\n\n07 of 30\n\n“A Christmas Story” (1983)\n\nA Christmas Story is a collection of vignettes about 9-year-old Ralphie and his family as they approach the holidays in the early 1940s, experiencing the dreams and disasters of the season. All Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle, but his mother, his teacher, and even the department store Santa tell him, \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" The film also includes a pink bunny pajama suit, a secret decoder ring, a triple-dog-dare to lick an icy cold flagpole, and the iconic \"leg lamp\".\n\nWhere to watch A Christmas Story: Max\n\nDirector: Bob Clark\n\nCast: Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin\n\nRelated content: The real-life filming locations in A Christmas Story\n\n08 of 30\n\n“A Charlie Brown Christmas” (1965)\n\nThe first-ever Peanuts special, A Charlie Brown Christmas, turns seasonal depression into heartfelt comedy. As the Christmas season nears, Charlie Brown is worried that the holiday is getting too commercial, encouraging kids to think about nothing but presents, parties, and pink aluminum trees. He's supposed to be the director of the school's nativity pageant, but nobody pays him any attention, and the kids all laugh at the scrawny tree he picks out. A seasonal staple, Linus' show-stopping speech about the true meaning of Christmas remains the gold standard for holiday special sincerity.\n\nWhere to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas: AppleTV+\n\nDirector: Bill Melendez\n\nCast: Peter Robbins, Christopher Shea, Kathy Steinberg\n\nRelated content: Listen to never-before-heard, unearthed version of A Charlie Brown Christmas song\n\n09 of 30\n\n“The Christmas Chronicles” (2018)\n\nIn this Netflix original movie, a brother and sister are determined to catch Santa Claus on camera and end up hitching a ride on his sleigh. Surprised by the stowaways, Santa loses control of his ride and ends up separated from his reindeer, his magic hat, and his sack of toys. Old Saint Nick and the kids need to get Christmas back on track, and their quest takes them through the night-time streets of Chicago in an endearingly down-to-earth adventure.

Genius toymaker Jeronicus Jangle (Forest Whitaker) is robbed of his prized creation and his notebook of ideas, causing both his family and his business to fall apart. Decades later, Jeronicus has lost his creative spark, but his precocious granddaughter Journey can help him to complete his most brilliant achievement — if she can convince him to believe in himself again. The film is a visual feast, featuring sumptuous costumes, a cute robot, and enormous musical numbers with inventive, enthusiastic choreography.\n\nWhere to watch Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey: Netflix\n\nDirector: David E.

Watching a bad guy fall down the icy stairs or get smacked in the face with a paint can may not sound in line with the Christmas spirit, but seasonal joy comes in many flavors.\n\nWhere to watch Home Alone: Disney+\n\nDirector: Chris Columbus\n\nCast: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara\n\nRelated content: Home Alone cast: Where are they now?\n\n12 of 30\n\n“Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas” (1977)\n\nThis gentle Christmas classic from Jim Henson's Muppets features adorable woodland animal characters, a sweet story, and rousing tunes by songwriter Paul Williams.

Clever puppetry tricks and detailed miniature sets give this special a timeless charm that will never fade.\n\nWhere to watch Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas: Peacock\n\nDirector: Jim Henson\n\nCast: Jim Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson, Marilyn Sokol\n\n13 of 30\n\n“The Year Without a Santa Claus” (1974)\n\nIt's time to save Christmas again in this stop-motion favorite about the terrible year when Santa Claus decides he'd rather sleep in than get up and do his job. Knowing that children around the world will be disappointed if they don't receive a visit from Santa this year, Mrs. Claus sends the sprites Jingle and Jangle out into the world to prove that people still believe in the jolly old man.

It's a decidedly modern take on tradition, with Noelle discovering that a female Santa is the best person for the job.\n\nWhere to watch Noelle: Disney+\n\nDirector: Marc Lawrence\n\nCast: Anna Kendrick, Bill Hader, Kingsley Ben-Adir\n\n24 of 30\n\n“Jingle All the Way” (1996)\n\nIf your family is looking for a little holiday-themed mayhem, Jingle All the Way offers comical action sequences based on an all-too-familiar Christmas challenge. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Howard, a dad who's made the unwise promise to deliver the season's hottest toy to his son on Christmas Eve after every store has already sold out. Frustrated in his quest, Howard develops an unhealthy rivalry with another dad (Sinbad), who's made the same promise to his own child. Holiday traditions are mined for chaotic comedy, but ultimately, the movie is most concerned with repairing Howard's relationship with his son.\n\nWhere to watch Jingle All the Way: Disney+\n\nDirector: Brian Levant\n\nCast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sinbad, Phil Hartman\n\nRelated content: Jingle All the Way cast: Where are they now?\n\n25 of 30\n\n“March of the Wooden Soldiers” (1934)\n\nMarch of the Wooden Soldiers is the oldest film on this list — and one of the sweetest. Comedy legends Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy play bumbling toymaker apprentices who live in Toyland, a world populated by storybook characters. The plot involves an unpaid mortgage for the Old Woman Who Lives in a Shoe, who faces eviction unless she allows Silas Barnaby, the meanest man in Toyland, to marry her daughter Bo Peep. When a thwarted Barnaby threatens to unleash a gang of evil bogeymen on the town, Stan and Ollie restore order with a squadron of six-foot-high wooden soldiers, leading to fairy-tale endings for everyone.\n\nWhere to watch March of the Wooden Soldiers: AppleTV+\n\nDirector: Gus Meins, Charles Rogers\n\nCast: Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Charlotte Henry\n\n26 of 30\n\n“Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town” (1970)\n\nAnother stop-motion masterpiece from Rankin/Bass, Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town tells the story of how the man in the red suit became a legend. An orphaned child from the gloomy village of Sombertown is adopted by a family of toy-making elves who name him Kris Kringle. Years later, the leader of Sombertown — a cranky old tyrant with the delicious name of Burgermeister Meisterburger — trips on a toy duck and decides to ban all playthings. The story manages to explain the beard, the flying reindeer, the North Pole workshop, and the annual tradition of gift-giving at Christmas.\n\nWhere to watch Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\nDirector: Arthur Rankin Jr., Jules Bass\n\nCast: Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Keenan Wynn\n\n27 of 30\n\n“Mickey's Christmas Carol” (1983)\n\nClocking in at just half an hour, Mickey's Christmas Carol is a kid-friendly version of the famous Dickens tale, chock full of their favorite characters. This adaptation has pitch-perfect casting, with Uncle Scrooge as the money-minded Ebenezer, Mickey Mouse as Bob Cratchit, Donald Duck as Scrooge's spendthrift nephew, and ghosts played by Goofy, Jiminy Cricket, and the big bad Pete. The film sprints through the story at a record clip but manages to hit all the important moments and memorable images. (Keep an eye out for fun cameos featuring more faces from Disney's golden age!)\n\nWhere to watch Mickey's Christmas Carol: Disney+\n\nDirector: Burny Mattinson\n\nCast: Alan Young, Wayne Allwine, Hal Smith\n\n28 of 30\n\n“The Polar Express” (2004)\n\nTom Hanks plays five roles in this wintry epic, which was made exclusively through motion-capture animation. A young boy who's almost too old to believe in Santa Claus is awakened on Christmas Eve by the arrival of an enormous steam locomotive pulling up outside his house, ready to take him to the North Pole. He boards the train for a magical adventure with new friends through a treacherous snowbound landscape, all the way to Santa's workshop. The art style is hauntingly beautiful, and where else can you see a fleet of tap-dancing waiters performing a catchy musical number about hot chocolate?\n\nWhere to watch The Polar Express: Max\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nCast: Tom Hanks, Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye\n\nRelated content: Next stop: The best train movies\n\n29 of 30\n\n“Arthur Christmas” (2011)\n\nIn this clever animated comedy, the Claus family has modernized the Christmas Eve delivery protocol, distributing toys around the world thanks to a battalion of elves using high-tech spy equipment, including a gigantic metal sleigh-ship that resembles a merry MCU helicarrier. The current Santa's younger son Arthur (James McAvoy) is a hapless lad, decidedly not next in line to take the reins in the family business. But Arthur's the one who really believes in the holiday, and when he discovers that an otherwise successful present drop has missed one little girl's gift, he demonstrates the real spirit of Christmas to his jaded family.\n\nWhere to watch Arthur Christmas: Max\n\nDirector: Sarah Smith\n\nCast: James McAvoy, Hugh Laurie, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent\n\n30 of 30\n\n“Dr. Seuss' The Grinch” (2018)\n\nThis computer-animated update to the 1966 special boasts an all-star cast, including Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of the Grinch and Pharrell Williams as the story's narrator. Expanding the special's run-time to feature length gives the film the space to explore the Grinch's grumpy personality, adding delightful character moments and sly sight gags. The Whos of Whoville also get the chance to shine, with a strong subplot for Cindy Lou Who's overworked single mother (Rashida Jones). The Grinch is entertaining for kids at any age, all the way up to the grouchiest of adults.\n\nWhere to watch Dr. Seuss' The Grinch: Peacock\n\nDirector: Scott Mosier, Yarrow Cheney\n\nCast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Pharrell Williams, Rashida Jones, Kenan Thompson, Angela Lansbury\n\nRelated content: Benedict Cumberbatch admits what makes him Grinch-y"
