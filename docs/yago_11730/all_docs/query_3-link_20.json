        "text": "Rankin/Bass Productions is an American animation production company, and the former name is Videocraft International, Ltd. Rankin used to work at ABC as an art director, but he teamed up with Bass in 1955 and making TV commercials. They changed the company name from Videocraft to Rankin/Bass since they started making animated TV shows. Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass established the production ‘Rankin/Bass Production’ on September 14, 1960. The company created numerous stop-motion animated shows and cel-animation shows such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964), Frosty the Snowman (1969), Mad Monster Party (1967), and more. Especially, their Christmas special show, Rudolph was the most popular and longest running holiday show. Many of their specials used famous Christmas songs; thus, their specials became Christmas icons in the US.\n\nRankin/Bass Productions is known as titled their stop-motion animation technique called “Animagic” which is a single-frame stop motion. According to the TV show; The WGN Morning News (2004), Rankin Bass historian named Rick Goldschmidt explains, “Animagic is a stop-motion form of animation where they would move a puppet one frame at the time and shoot it.”\n\nMajority of Rankin/Bass Productions’ works were actually created in Japan. Rankin visited Japan and was looking for the production studios. Their first stop-motion animated TV series; The New Adventures of Pinocchio (1960) was written and designed by Rankin in the US and made by Dentsu Studios in Japan. Japanese stop-motion animator, Tad Mochinaga leaded the animation series at Dentsu Studio in the 1960’s. Japanese puppet makers created the Rankin’s puppets with woods, wires, and wools. Most of Rankin’s cel-animation projects were also made in Japan. Toei Animation, Crawley Films, Mushi Production, and Topcraft were working to create many Rankin’s films.\n\nFilmography:\n\nSanta, Baby!
