Adapted by Peter S. Beagle from his novel, this touching fantasy features the voices of Alan Arkin, Jeff Bridges, Angela Lansbury, Christopher Lee and Mia Farrow as the titular creature on a magic-filled quest to find others of her kind. With music by Jimmy Webb and soft-rock hitmakers America.\n\nFORMAT: DCP\n\nDISTRIBUTOR: Park Circus"
