        "text": "If you watched Christmas movies on television as a child, you probably have fond memories of claymation specials — maybe Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was your favorite, or perhaps Santa Claus Is Coming to Town. But you may not have realized that all of those beloved classics were directed and produced by the same creative team. Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass first went into business shortly after WWII, just as television was becoming a mass medium, and their collaboration yielded many of America’s most beloved Christmas programming.\n\n“To this day it’s amazing to me that these programs, which were rather simply made, have lasted in the marketplace,” Bass told Toronto’s National Post in 2006. Today, the Rankin-Bass specials feel both nostalgic — distinct products of the mid-20th century — and timeless. As Rankin explained in a 2005 interview conducted for the Archive of American Television, “In all our pictures we had an antagonist who becomes the good guy ... and the underdog fulfills his quest.” It’s an enduring arc, and one that feels especially heartwarming around the holidays. No wonder these specials have stood the test of time.\n\nBelow, the best of Rankin and Bass’ claymation Christmas movies — along with a bonus entry."
