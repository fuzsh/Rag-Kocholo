Rhimes wrote, "Meredith will say, 'I need a medical medical to medical!' And someone else will go, 'Well I have medical medical.' 'Well hand me the medical!"

She also revealed that on the show "Scandal," it's "political political."

The show helped to raise awareness for a critical illness.

"Scrubs alum" Sarah Chalke appeared in the season-nine episode "Can't Fight This Feeling" to raise awareness for Kawasaki disease.

According to TV Line, the episode is based on her real-life fighting for answers about her baby's mystery illness that turned out to be the rare Kawasaki disease.

It can kill within days, but her son survived thanks to her finding a web article about Kawasaki symptoms that matched her son's.

Now Chalke is dedicated to bringing the disease to national attention, especially since there's such a short window that it can be treated in.

"The Kawasaki doctor we dealt with said they do a news story every year, and often that save lives every year," Chalke told TV Line. "So she said that this ["Grey's Anatomy"] episode absolutely is going to save lives. It's going to save some kids."
