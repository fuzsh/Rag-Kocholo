        "text": "After watching 420 episodes of Grey’s Anatomy, I’ve learned invaluable life lessons, shed countless tears, and experienced a rollercoaster of emotions through its captivating storytelling and relatable characters.\n\nJohannesburg, South Africa (08 August 2024) – It’s amazing how much we can learn from TV shows. They don’t just entertain us; they offer lessons about life, love, and everything in between.\n\nI love series and movies, storytelling, and getting lost in worlds created by incredible minds.\n\nI started watching Grey’s Anatomy when it first came out in 2005 (ja, 19 years ago) but gave up for some reason. I recently decided to give it another go, and after watching all 420 episodes, I’ve picked up a lot more than just medical jargon and dramatic plot twists.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Grey’s Anatomy is a long-running medical drama that follows the lives of surgical interns, residents, and attending doctors as they evolve into seasoned doctors while trying to maintain their personal lives. The show, created by Shonda Rhimes, is renowned for its intense surgeries, complex relationships, and powerful storytelling.\n\nDo not watch the video below if you have not seen all 20 seasons, as it does contain spoilers.\n\nAs the show progresses, the medical procedures become more far-fetched, and the characters face incredible hardships. It’s a whirlwind of drama and emotion. From miraculous saves to heartbreaking losses, every episode is a rollercoaster.\n\nHere’s a glimpse into the life lessons and entertaining quirks I’ve gleaned from this iconic show:\n\nEmotional Rollercoaster: I cried a lot while watching Grey’s Anatomy, sometimes at the most basic characters. The show has a way of tugging at the heartstrings and making you care deeply about every character, no matter how minor they might seem.\n\nClipping Mania: One thing that stood out is how often they “clip” things while operating. It’s almost comical how many times they say “clip, clip, clip.” It’s a small but consistent detail that often made me giggle.\n\nCreative Language: The writers cleverly replaced more explicit language with “freaking.” The doctors say “freaking” a lot, which is both amusing and enduring. It’s a fun way to keep the dialogue intense without crossing lines.\n\nMedical Families: It’s fascinating how many characters have siblings, parents, or family members in the medical world. Like, it’s unrealistic bit it’s also a reminder of how family could influences career choices (emphasis on could).\n\nMeredith’s Cadence: Meredith Grey, the show’s central character, has a unique way of speaking. Her rhythm doesn’t always match the urgency of the situation, creating a captivating contrast that makes her stand out even more (or a little more annoying).\n\nFavourite Characters: George, Izzy, and Cristina are among my favourite characters. They brought such warmth and complexity to the show. Alex, on the other hand, did not get the ending he deserved, which still feels like an unresolved chapter.\n\nMissing Denny Duquette: The absence of Denny Duquette is still felt. His storyline was one of the most poignant, leaving a lasting impact. I think about him often. Cue “If I Lay Here”.\n\nHouse Sharing Woes: Sharing a house with colleagues is not advised. The show highlights the chaos and complications that come with living and working with the same people.\n\nRelatable Life Lessons: Many episodes are relatable from a “life lesson” point of view. The characters’ struggles and triumphs often mirror our own, providing valuable insights and reflections on our personal journeys.\n\nSeasonal Highlights and Lows: Seasons 13 and 18 were the weakest, with storylines that felt like pulling teeth. Season 2 remains my favourite, while Season 15’s “Silent All The Years” is the most powerful episode I have ever seen. Season 8 was heartbreaking, and Season 17, dealing with COVID-19, was both brilliant and tough to watch. The beach scenes were beautiful yet poignant.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, Grey’s Anatomy has consistently delivered impactful storytelling. Bring on Season 21! I am ready for it. The anticipation is high, and I can’t wait to see where the journey takes us next.\n\nHere’s to many more lessons, heartaches, and moments of joy (like dancing it out) with our favourite doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n\n*Grey’s Anatomy is available to watch on Disney+ (Hulu) and Netflix.\n\nSources: Brent Lindeque | Opinion Piece\n\nDon’t ever miss the Good Things.
