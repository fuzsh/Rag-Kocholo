        "text": "If you’re reading this, Grey’s Anatomy might be older than you. The series is, at the very least, in your age range. The medical drama premiered on ABC in March 2005, returning March 14 for its 20th (!!) season. The cast naturally looks different after nearly two decades (and we’re not talking about cosmetic differences).\n\nThe original cast of Grey’s Anatomy included Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Patrick Dempsey, Chandra Wilson, Justin Chambers, Katherine Heigl, T.R. Knight, Isaiah Washington, and James Pickens Jr. The only series regulars still standing in season 20 are Chandra Wilson’s Miranda Bailey and James Pickens Jr.’s Richard Webber. We’re not complaining; They’ve always been the heartbeat of the series. Even Ellen Pompeo’s Meredith Grey has become a recurring character in the show. The eponymous doctor extraordinaire will make appearances throughout the new season, but don’t expect to see her smiling face every week. Here's a full episode guide for round 20 of Grey's.\n\nWhen does season 20 of Grey’s Anatomy premiere?\n\nHopefully you’re reading this on the right day, otherwise, you’ve fallen behind! The new season of Grey’s Anatomy premiered on ABC on March 14, 2024 at 8 p.m. ET. New episodes will air every Thursday night at 8, landing on Hulu for streamers the next day.\n\nHow many episodes will be in Grey's Anatomy season 20?\n\nOne of the pillars of the series that is Grey’s Anatomy is hours upon hours of content. In its heyday, the popular show released seasons at 20+ episodes a pop. Season 20, however, will be capped at 10 episodes, making it the shortest season of the show to date (not counting the pilot season, which ran for 9 episodes. Who counts a running start anyways?)\n\nAll that said, for as long as the show is on the air (which just might be for the rest of eternity), you can likely expect a beefier episode count. The truncation of this season was largely due to delays related to the SAG-AFTRA strike in 2023. As long as Hollywood pays their writers living wages, we will have unrealistically beautiful surgeons operating on highly imaginative injuries.\n\nHow can I catch up on 19 years of television?\n\nTime, and lots of it. If you’re interested in starting from the pilot episode, Grey’s Anatomy is available to stream on both Netflix and Hulu.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nHere’s the season 20 release schedule for Grey’s Anatomy.\n\nEpisode 1: \"We've Only Just Begun,\" March 14, 2024\n\nEpisode 2: “Keep the Family Close,” March 21, 2024\n\nEpisode 3: “Walk on the Ocean,” March 28, 2024\n\nEpisode 4: “Baby Can I Hold You,” April 4, 2024\n\nThere’s more to come. Until then, scrub in."
