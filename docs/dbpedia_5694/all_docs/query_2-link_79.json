        "text": "When you settle down for an episode of Grey's Anatomy, you know crying is a matter of when, not if.\n\nIt's a goddamn emotional rollercoaster and throughout the show's 17 seasons, we've lost many tears to this chaotic show.\n\nOften these tears are due to character deaths. Seriously, someone dies nearly every episode.\n\nWatch: Derek and Meredith reunite on Grey's Anatomy. Post continues below video.\n\nVideo via ABC.\n\nOver the years, we've said goodbye to hundreds of characters, from patients to interns and recurring characters.\n\nMain characters aren't off-limits either. Even main main characters aren't off limits (see: Derek Shepherd). At this point, I'm convinced Shonda Rhimes enjoys screwing with our emotions.\n\nHere's where all these past cast members are now.\n\nPatrick Dempsey, Dr Derek Shepherd.\n\nThere were a lot of rumours that Dempsey and Rhimes had a... strained relationship, which ultimately lead to the death of one of Grey's most important characters in 2015.\n\nDerek had stopped while driving to help in a car accident, but was hit by a truck. He ended up brain dead, and Meredith later agreed to take him off life support.\n\nGeorge jumped in front of a bus to save a young woman's life. His injuries were so severe he was unrecognisable - so much so his friends at the hospital had no idea it was him until he traced his nickname (007) on Meredith's hand.\n\nHis death was very sudden and came about due to some off-screen drama.\n\nIn 2009, Knight announced he was leaving the show, frustrated by the lack of screen time his character George was receiving.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly he said he did not discuss this frustration, which saw George appear in just 48 minutes in the first nine episodes of season five, with Rhimes due to a \"breakdown of communication\". Instead, he just decided to leave.\n\n\"My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [about George],\" he explained. \"And with respect, I'm going to leave it at that.\"\n\nSince his departure, Knight has worked both on- and off-Broadway, and also kept up his film and television career.\n\nHe starred in multiple episodes of The Good Wife and played Reince Priebus in miniseries The Comey Rule. He also appeared as Davey Bowden in The Flight Attendant, alongside Kaley Cuoco.\n\nIn 2013, Knight married his long-time partner Patrick B. Leahy.\n\n\"I was seeing these doctors, thinking there was something physically wrong with me because I'd never felt like that,\" he said. \"I'd dealt with depression throughout my life, and it was always manageable. I just felt, you know, everybody feels a little blue.\n\n\"This just hit me like a truck,\" he said. \"I had to take some time off. I went away, I took care of it and I'm feeling great.\"\n\nThe Last Ship concluded in 2018, the same year his wife Rebecca Gayheart filed for divorce."
