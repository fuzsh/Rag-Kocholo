        "text": "Kimberly Jayne \"Kim\" Raver is an American actress from New York City. She has had a relatively long career in television roles, but she is primarily remembered for three roles. She portrayed the paramedic Kimberly \"Kim\" Zambrano in the police procedural \"Third Watch\" (1999-2005), the political advisor Audrey Raines in several seasons of the crime thriller series #24 (2001-2010), and the cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr. Theodora Grace \"Teddy\" Altman in the medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\" (2005-). Raver joined the medical drama in its 6th season. She was originally intended to only portray a new recurring character, but was promoted to a series-regular before the end of that season.\n\nIn 1975, Raver made her television debut as a child actress in the long-running educational children's television \"Sesame Street\" (1969-). She appeared regularly in the series from 1975 to 1978. She decided to follow an acting career in the early 1990s, but she mostly acted in television commercials for the first few years of her career.\n\nIn 1995, Raver made her Broadway debut in the play \"Holiday\" by Philip Barry. Shortly later, Raver started portraying one-shot characters in popular television series of the 1990s, such as \"Law & Order\", \"The Practice\", and \"Spin City\". Her role in \"Third Watch\" was the first time that Raver portrayed a major character in television.\n\nRaver portrayed the Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Hale, one of the main characters in the short-lived action drama series \"The Nine\" (2006-2007). In the series, Kathryn and several other characters were held hostage by bank robbers over a 52-hour period. The episodes explored events in the lives of the hostages both before and after the robbery. The series was nominated for a Golden Reel Award, but was canceled due to poor ratings.\n\nRaver portrayed the editor-in-chief Nico Reilly, one of the main characters in the short-lived comedy-drama series \"Lipstick Jungle\" (2008-2009). The series was based on a popular novel by Candace Bushnell, and focused on the life-long friendship of three career women who worked in different industries. The series was canceled due to poor ratings and a controversy over abrupt casting changes.\n\nRaver joined the cast of \"Grey's Anatomy\" in 2009, and decided to depart from the series in 2012. Following a years-long hiatus, she returned to the series in 2017. She has remained a series-regular ever since. Raver also had recurring roles in the crime drama \"Ray Donovan\" (2013-2020) and the political thriller \"Designated Survivor\" (2016-2019) during this period. Raver made her voice acting debut in animation in the superhero film \"Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors\" (2018), where she voiced the super-heroine Captain Marvel /Carol Danvers.\n\nKatherine Marie Heigl was born on November 24, 1978 in Washington, D.C., to Nancy Heigl (née Engelhardt), a personnel manager, and Paul Heigl, an accountant and executive. Her father is of German/Swiss-German and Irish descent, and her mother is of German ancestry. A short time after her birth, the family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Katherine was to spend the majority of her childhood; the youngest member of her family, Katherine--or \"Katie\" as she is nicknamed--has two elder siblings, John and Meg. Tragically, her older brother Jason died in 1986 of brain injuries suffered in a car accident, after being thrown from the back of a pickup truck. When doctors determined he was brain-dead, the family made the difficult decision to donate his organs. Not only did this painful chapter give Katherine a greater perspective and appreciation for life, but it motivated her to use her celebrity to promote the importance of organ donation.\n\nKatherine was first thrust into the limelight as a child model. An aunt, visiting the family in New Canaan, took a number of photographs of Katherine, then aged nine, in a series of poses to advertise a hair care product she had invented. Upon returning to New York, with permission from Katherine's parents, she sent the photos to a number of modeling agencies. Within a few weeks, Katherine had been signed to Wilhelmina, a renowned international modeling agency. Almost immediately, she made her debut in a magazine advertisement and soon followed this with an inaugural television appearance in a national commercial for Cheerios breakfast cereal.\n\nFollowing a number of commercials and modeling assignments for Sears and Lord & Taylor, she made her big-screen debut in Sexy Sheryl - Ein heißer Sommer (1992), which starred Juliette Lewis and C. Thomas Howell. It was then that she realized that acting rather than modeling was her passion. In 1993, Katherine appeared in Steven Soderbergh's critically-acclaimed Depression-era drama, König der Murmelspieler (1993), before landing her first leading role as a rebellious teenager, alongside Gérard Depardieu, in Daddy Cool (1994). During this time, Katherine continued to attend New Canaan High School, balancing her academic studies with work on films and modeling, which she undertook during holidays, vacations and weekends.\n\nIn 1995, she played \"Sarah Ryback\", the niece of Steven Seagal's character, in Alarmstufe: Rot 2 (1995), which was her \"debut\" in the action film genre. Acting was now becoming a stronger focus for Katherine, although she still modeled extensively, appearing regularly in magazines such as \"Seventeen\". Television appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) and Late Night with Conan O'Brien (1993) soon followed, before she took the lead role in Disney's Wenn Wünsche in Erfüllung gehen (1996) in 1996. It was also during that year that Katherine's parents divorced and, following her graduation from high school in 1997, she moved with her mother into a four-bedroom house in Los Angeles' Malibu Canyon area. This enabled her to focus upon acting with the guidance and support of her mother, who now managed her career.\n\nIn 1997, Katherine portrayed \"Taffy Entwhistle\", Rita Hayworth's stand-in, in Stardust - Entscheidung in Hollywood (1997) and was also cast as the beauteous \"Princess Ilene\" in the European production, Prinz Eisenherz (1997). She then made her made-for-TV movie debut, co-starring with Peter Fonda in a re-working of the classic Shakespearean play, Sturm über Mississippi (1998), updated with an American Civil War theme. In this film, she played \"Miranda Prosper\", a young woman torn between her love for both her father and a Union soldier. Bug Buster (1998) and Chucky und seine Braut (1998) represented a venture into the horror genre for Katherine. While both films could be described as rather tongue-in-cheek despite their gory emphases, Chucky und seine Braut (1998) was the better received, both critically and commercially.\n\nIn 1999, Katherine decided to branch out into series television when she accepted the role of the haughty, yet vulnerable, \"Isabel Evans\", on Roswell (1999), a show that blended teen angst with sci-fi drama. Though she had never planned to embark on a career in television, the role of Isabel, a teenager with a secret life, was an offer she found impossible to refuse. In the series, Isabel, her brother Max (Jason Behr) and their friend Michael (Brendan Fehr) are aliens passing as humans in Roswell, New Mexico, as they desperately try to hide the truth from government agencies, the people of Roswell and even their own adopted families. To publicize her role on the show, Katherine graced the covers of magazines such as \"TV Guide\", \"Maxim\" and \"Teen\" and was interviewed on Later with Greg Kinnear (1994) and The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn (1999). Along with her mother Nancy, she also appeared in an episode of the Sci-Fi TV talk show, Crossing Over with John Edward (2001), during which she spoke with John Edward, a psychic medium, about her late brother, Jason. During the three years Roswell (1999) was in production, Katherine found time to work on several movies. Eins, zwei, Pie - Wer die Qual hat, hat die Wahl (2000), an independent film released in 2001, is the story of a college freshman who meets the girl of his dreams in an elevator during a blackout, and spends the rest of the movie trying to find her again. Her cameo role is that of Arlene, the competitive tomboy. The second film, Schrei, wenn Du kannst (2001), a horror film starring David Boreanaz and Denise Richards, appeared in U.S. theaters on February 2, 2001. In this movie, which is based upon the 1996 novel by Tom Savage, Katherine plays \"Shelley\", a medical student who meets a sudden demise.\n\nIn the spring of 2001, Katherine accepted a role in NBC's Atomalarm in San Francisco (2002), a two-hour original television thriller. Katherine and Kerr Smith (Dawsons Creek (1998)) co-starred as brilliant and politically concerned college students who build a nuclear device to illustrate the need for a change in national priorities, but are betrayed by a fellow student when the bomb ends up in the hands of a terrorist. Unfortunately, the telefilm, directed by Eric Laneuville, written by Tom Vaughan, and based on the best-seller \"The Seventh Power\" by James Mills, was shelved when its storyline was deemed too close for comfort to the events of September 11, 2001. It was eventually broadcast in 2003. Since the cancellation of Roswell (1999) in the spring of 2002, Katherine has been busy with various projects, including an appearance on UPN's update of the classic television series, Twilight Zone (2002). That episode, entitled Cradle of Darkness (2002), aired on October 2, 2002, and featured Katherine in the role of a woman who goes back in time to stop one of the most notorious murders in history. In addition, she completed a movie, Descendant (2003), a psychological thriller inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\". She has also starred as \"Romy\" in ABC/Touchstone's two-hour telepic, Romy & Michele: Hollywood wir kommen! (2005), a prequel to the 1997 feature, Romy und Michele (1997). During the summer of 2002, Katherine made a major decision in the direction of her career when she signed on for representation in all areas with the William Morris Agency, one of the biggest and most prestigious agencies in the entertainment industry. She is now being represented by Norman Aladjem at Paradigm Agency and being managed by Nancy Heigl and Stephanie Simon and Jason Newman at Untitled Entertainment."
