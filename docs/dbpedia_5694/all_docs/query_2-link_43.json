        "text": "If there is a better example of “wallpaper TV,” than Grey’s Anatomy, I’ve not yet found it. It’s the kind of show you can put on in the background and devote a minimum of your attention to, yet still manages to help block out the cold, cold 2024 world. Now in its 19th season, the long-running medical drama created by Shonda Rhimes transports you to simpler (and steamier) times, as it follows Dr. Meredith Grey and the team of doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial who are faced daily with life-or-death decisions and lots of hunks.\n\nIf you needed an excuse to not leave the house, here’s our breakdown of the personality types of the characters on Grey’s Anatomy. You’re welcome and one caveat: there is widespread dissension on the personality typing of some Grey’s characters. We did our best here based on observed traits over certain seasons, but if you disagree, please tell us in the comments!\n\nMeredith Grey - Enneagram Type Four & INFJ\n\nMeredith’s underlying fear of being “ordinary” – a hallmark of the Enneagram 4 personality type – is on vivid display when her dying father, Ellis, expresses his disappointment at how ordinary Meredith has turned out to be, leading Meredith to become almost suicidal. Fours can experience a deep conflict in the sense that they long to connect with others, but they feel that because they are so unusual, very few people are able to truly see them as they are. We see this as a recurring theme in Meredith’s relationships throughout the series.\n\nAlso, Enneagram 4s are the true romantics of the Enneagram, and I think we can all agree that Meredith is that! You can learn more about what Enneagram 4s secretly want in relationships here.\n\nGiven her intuitive, complex and empathetic nature, Meredith is also likely an INFJ in the 16 personalities system based on Myers Briggs theory. Known as “The Counselor,” this type often acts as a confidante, as we see Meredith do for her colleagues. She strives for harmony in her relationships and is regularly seen mediating conflicts, for example, between Cristina and Izzie in the earlier seasons.\n\nMeredith may be one tough doctor but, like most INFJs, she is creative, sensitive, visionary and has a strong dedication to her patients. She often looks at the bigger picture in medicine and her personal life – as we often hear detailed in her narratives.\n\nDerek Shepherd (AKA McDreamy) - Enneagram Type Three & ENTJ\n\nLike many Enneagram 3s, Derek is success-oriented – ambitious and highly driven to succeed in his career as a neurosurgeon. He is image-conscious too, often concerned with how others perceive him and his reputation. He struggles with setbacks and failures, as they directly impact his sense of self-worth.\n\nDerek is also likely an ENTJ personality type within the Myers and Briggs model. He is a charismatic leader with a strategic mind, often taking charge in surgeries and hospital politics. This type tends to be visionary and ambitious, with a strong determination to achieve their goals, which we see in Derek’s work to advance his career and such ambitious projects as the brain-mapping initiative. This type can also be assertive and sometimes stubborn, which results in delightful repartee with Meredith!\n\nCristina Yang – Enneagram Type Eight and INTJ\n\nPlayed by the inimitable and wonderful Sandra Oh, Cristina is known for her assertiveness in the operating room and in her personal life, a key trait of Enneagram 8s. This type is also known as “The Challenger,” and we see that in how Cristina is not afraid to challenge superiors and the status quo to achieve what she believes is right. She often seeks to maintain control over her environment and situations, disliking feeling vulnerable or powerless, which is the core motivation of this type.\n\nShe is also fiercely protective of loved ones, despite her tough exterior – another trait of this Enneagram type.\n\nHighly analytical and brilliant, Cristina is likely an INTJ. Known as “The Mastermind” in 16 personalities theory, these type traits are on display with Cristina’s strategic thinking in complex medical cases. She also values competence, is highly skeptical, and is independent. Another INTJ trait is being highly determined in all arenas, and we can see that in Cristina’s athlete-like focus during the hot dog eating contest in Season 2!\n\nAlex Karev - Enneagram Type Eight and ISFJ\n\nDirect and confrontational, Alex is likely an Enneagram 8. He is not afraid to speak his mind and can be quite blunt. Like many 8s, he struggles with his own vulnerability and often uses a confrontational attitude to mask his insecurities. He is also intensely loyal and will go to great lengths to protect his loved ones and friends.\n\nAlex had a difficult upbringing that leads him to be defensive and sometimes aggressive when his past is brought up. The Enneagram is, in part, based on childhood experiences. Having had a tough childhood with a need to present a tough exterior is consistent with Enneagram 8s and Alex’s character.\n\nAlex is also likely an ISFJ, when looked at through the lens of the 16 Myers and Briggs personality types. Loyal and dedicated to his patients, he shows a strong sense of duty, consistent with this type. Initially he appears tough, but he has a caring and nurturing side, especially with children. ISFJs are known as “The Protector” for a reason! He also values stability and security, which is reflected in his career choices and personal life.\n\nMiranda Bailey – Enneagram Type One and ESTJ\n\nWith a strong sense of right and wrong, Miranda is a classic Enneagram Type 1. She often serves as the moral compass of the group, holding herself and others to high ethical standards. There is no doubt that she is a perfectionist – a key trait of this type – known for her meticulous nature and high expectations, both for herself and her residents. Like many Ones, she can also be hard on herself, driven by an internal critic that demands excellence.\n\nMiranda is also likely an ESTJ. She is practical, responsible and no-nonsense, especially in her assertive communication style, which can come across as harsh or intimidating to others. Organized and efficient like many ESTJs, she effectively manages her residents and the clinic. She also values tradition and hierarchy, evident in her enforcement of the hospital's rules and protocols.\n\nGeorge O'Malley - Enneagram Type Nine and INFP\n\nLike most Enneagram 9s, George avoids conflict and seeks to keep the peace among his friends and colleagues. He is also supportive and agreeable, sometimes to the point of neglecting his own needs – an Enneagram 9 tell. George’s core desire for harmony means it’s difficult for him to assert himself, which affects his personal and professional relationships.\n\nGeorge is also likely an INFP. Sensitive and compassionate, George is often the emotional support for his friends. Like many INFPs, he is idealistic and seeks to find his place in the world, as seen in his struggle to find the right specialty in medicine and subsequent decision to join the army. Consistent with the INFP personality, George exhibits a strong desire to help others and make a meaningful impact, which drives his career choices.\n\nIzzie Stevens – Enneagram Type Two and ENFP\n\nEnneagram 2s are caring and nurturing, and we see that in how often Izzie goes above and beyond for her patients. Twos seek deep personal connections, and because of this Izzie can become overly involved in the lives of her patients. An Enneagram 2’s core fear is being unloved. Izzie’s pursuit of George and other questionable behaviors can be seen as a way to fill this void. When unhealthy, Enneagram 2s can be manipulative in relationships and hyper-critical of their partners.\n\nIzzie is likely an ENFP. Warm and enthusiastic, she connects easily with her patients and friends. Another trait of this type is being idealistic and passionate, which we see in her setting up the Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic. ENFPs can also exhibit a spontaneous and free-spirited nature, sometimes acting impulsively based on their feelings. They also seek out new possibilities and are open to change. Her lingerie model to doctor transformation is a perfect example of this!\n\nMark Sloan (AKA McSteamy) - Enneagram 3 and ESFP\n\nMark Sloan is a classic Enneagram Type 3, highly ambitious and charming. Like many 3s whose core motivation is status, his character is often focused on success and image. He is competitive and highly driven in his career as a plastic surgeon, always striving to be the best and most renowned in his field.\n\nMark is adaptable and can be very charismatic, using his social skills to advance his career and personal goals. He sometimes struggles with authenticity, as he can be more focused on how his life looks rather than how it feels, a common issue for Type 3s. However, his growth throughout the series shows him moving towards a more heartfelt and genuine connection with others, reflecting the healthy side of a Type 3.\n\nCharismatic and sociable, like many ESFPs, Mark enjoys being the center of attention and thrives on interpersonal interactions. He uses his charm resourcefully to navigate complex social situations. He’s also spontaneous and action-oriented, seeking out excitement and new experiences in his personal life and surgical career, and often acting on his impulses (see cheating with his best friend’s wife or his bravado in undertaking risky surgeries).\n\nThis is not an exhaustive summary of the many characters of Grey’s, but these old episodes are not going to watch themselves!\n\nNot sure of your Enneagram type?
