        "text": "Secrets, secrets, secrets – everyone has a secret on Thursday's “Grey’s Anatomy.”\n\nLexie and Mark are hiding their blooming relationship. Bailey is hiding her fear of being around dying children. Derek is hiding an engagement ring in his pocket. And Arizona, well she is hiding a secret that even I didn’t see coming.\n\nWe know Izzie is sick. Izzie knows Izzie is sick. So, why is Izzie testing herself instead of seeing one of the many doctors around her? At the beginning of the episode she is testing herself for who knows what.\n\nCristina walks in on McArmy sleeping, and they have a moment. He tells her he likes the back of her neck, and she looks like she is going to melt in to a puddle. Meredith knows something between Cristina and Hunt, but Cristina insists that nothing is happening, or at least that she doesn’t know what is happening. Meredith also asks Cristina to read the part in her mother’s diary about her mother having an affair with the chief. I’m so happy they’re friends again.\n\nDerek is ready to propose. He is so ready in fact that he is walking around the hospital with the ring in his pocket. “I have to be careful though. She spooks easy,” he says to Mark. Wow, is that the understatement of the year, or what?\n\nMeredith’s radar must be turned on high this week because she is also sensing something going on between Lexie and Mark. Apparently, the two have been trying out a real relationship, a secret one but a real one none the less. She tells Meredith, in a panicked voice, nothing is going on.\n\nOne of the night’s cases is a man who was run over by his pregnant wife. She claims that it was an accident, she wasn’t thinking, and the two seem pretty happy. After the wife faints she is hooked up to a monitor to make sure that she and the baby are OK. In the hallway Derek makes a comment to Meredith that they are a nice looking couple and their kid will probably be really cute. “Not as cute as ours,” she replies. What? Did Meredith Grey really just say that? Derek of course catches, but he doesn’t say a word, especially since she barely even notices she has said.\n\nBailey has returned from her leave (she was recovering from the death of Jackson) to some very good news – she is being promoted! The chief has decided to talk to the board about Bailey becoming a general surgery attending immediately after she completes her residency. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Bailey jump up and down like that. That happiness is quickly shot down though when she realizes that her case for the day is a child with a pulmonary disease.\n\nElsewhere in the hospital we meet a man and his wife. The man refuses to talk to any of the younger doctors, instead insisting to wait for a “grown up.” Finally, the chief happens to walk by, and he explains to them that he has an interesting problem. I’m not quite sure what it is, but I know it was caused my some intense sexual activity and a crazy new position.\n\nCristina tells Derek not to do the “house of candles” type of proposal because that is what he likes and not what Meredith likes. She also tells Meredith that her mother’s diary is kind of hot and reads like a Victorian romance novel. And she would know a lot of romance novels seeing as she is currently living one. She and McArmy don’t hold hands while walking down the hall, but they stand close enough so that their finger tips can touch. It is so cute!\n\nIzzie has found a new way to test her self. When Sadie is having trouble drawing a patient’s blood she has Sadie try it on her. When Sadie puts it in the bag to throw away, Izzie tells her to run both tests. She then tells her group that before they perform any procedures that day they need to go to her first.\n\nDuring surgery Mark tells Callie that he feels like he needs to break up with Lexie, and just as we are about to find out why the patient’s blood pressure goes crazy. At that moment Lexie is on the phone with one of the surgeons in the operating room because the patient’s wife, the pregnant woman, Jen, she wants to know how he is. They can’t seem to get her blood pressure to relax either, and her worrying about him isn’t helping. Lexie tries to tell her that everything is going to be fine, but she starts to have a seizure.\n\nBailey is having a lot of trouble working with Stacey, the little girl with the heart problem. She can’t stand to see the same thing twice, and when Stacey nearly crashes and her surgery is bumped up to immediately, Bailey decides she can’t scrub in. Arizona tries to explain to her that she can do this and that Jackson’s case was special in an unfortunate way, but I don’t know if she wants to go back in there.\n\nRob, the patient in surgery with the pregnant wife, is finally stable, but his wife, Jen, isn’t. Meredith leaves the surgery to help Lexie with Jen, and we find out that Mark wants to breakup with Lexie because Derek is like his brother and that would make Meredith like his sister and Lexie like his sister… sort of. Totally stupid reason, and Callie tells him so.\n\nDuring Stacey’s surgery Dr. Dixon discovers that Stacey’s heart is more damaged than they thought. She actually says that it is “the most diseased heart I’ve ever seen.” When Bailey hears this and hears that without a heart transplant Stacey will die she immediately walks away, but who can blame her? I’ve never seen Bailey like this, and I’m just not sure how she intends to get past this. How could anyone get past it?\n\nWhat is wrong with Dr. Dixon? I don’t mean to ask that so rudely, but what is wrong with Dr. Dixon? The way she speaks, acts and tends to patients, well, I just think there is something off. Everyone sees it, yet we have heard no background. Just as Dr. Dixon begins to tells Stacey’s parents that she will need to live in the hospital, in that bed, until she receives a new heart Bailey rushes in to tell Stacey’s parents that there is another way. She shows them this backpack that she could wear all the time to get her medicine and tells them that they would put the family on a program. The parents get very excited, and the mother hugs Dr. Dixon to thank her. Dr. Dixon then complete freaks out, screams and all and walks away. It is so insane and so confusing. Bailey goes running after her, and she finds her hysterically crying and shaking in another room. She tells Bailey that she needs someone to hold her to suppress her nervous system, or she won’t be able to calm down. When Cristina comes in to find out what is going on she is also told to hold Dr. Dixon. I’m even more confused now.\n\nJen has just learned that she has had a brain aneurism and that Lexie lied to her about the state of her husband. It’s a rough moment.\n\nThe blood tests Sadie took earlier reveal that Izzie is anemic, but that the other woman has cancer. Is there anyway the tests could have been mixed up? It probably doesn’t happen that often in real life, but this is television. Plus, Denny acted like something really bad was happening to Izzie.\n\nLexie confronts Mark about their secret relationship. She tells him that keeping their secret is giving her high blood pressure and that if he wont’ be out in the open with her then she doesn’t want to be with him at all.\n\nCristina and Hunt (McArmy) are having one of their dream-like moments again, walking toward one another in the hallway, but unlike the other ones that end with a small touch this one ends with Hunt seeing a woman come out of the elevator, get the fear-of-death look and run away. Who is that woman? Is McArmy married? Hunt runs in to a room, hyperventilating and screaming about not being able to “do this.” Cristina runs after him and uses Dr. Dixon’s trick of hugging to calm him down. Seriously, who is that woman?\n\nIn surgery with Stacey Dr. Dixon explains to Bailey that whether she likes it or not general surgery is not for her; pediatric surgery is the right move for Bailey. She could not be more right. Bailey says that the fact that she does not want to be anywhere near a dying child makes her completely unsuitable for the job, but Arizona tells her that it just makes her “uniquely qualified.”\n\nMeredith finds Cristina and Hunt cuddled together in the on call room. Cristina is reading Meredith’s mother’s diary while Hunt sleeps. “He’s planning to propose,” Cristina says. My heart skips a beat, as does Meredith. “The chief to your mother,” she finishes. Good save!\n\nAfter work Callie and Arizona run in to each other in the ladies room at the bar. Callie is nearly in tears, and Arizona tells her that people talk at work so she knows some things about Callie. Is Arizona hitting on Callie? I don’t think so, but I definitely do think so. She tells her that people really respect her and like her, and then she goes in for the kiss. Wow! I did not see that coming until a split second before it happened.\n\nOh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! At Meredith’s house Derek and Mark are setting up for the proposal. Derek has placed red roses and candles all throughout their bedroom, including a heart made out of red rose on their bed. Mark muddles something about real love, making me think that he has serious feelings for Lexie, but Derek just dismisses it.\n\nUnfortunately, a proposal won’t be happening tonight. Right after Mark leaves Derek’s phone rings. It’s Addison. In case you don’t know, Addison is Derek’s ex-wife. She once was on “Grey’s Anatomy,” but then got her own spin-off show, “Private Practice.” Tonight was the crossover event, and Addison is calling to tell Derek that something terrible has happened to her brother, Archer.\n\nWhen Meredith returns home that night the whole room has been cleared, but she does find one, single rose petal under her pillow."
