        "text": "01 of 31\n\n\"A Hard Day's Night\" (season 1, episode 1)\n\nAs is the case with most shows, it's best to start at the beginning, as Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her group of fellow interns are introduced to the intense world of surgical residency (and, of course, Chandra Wilson's Dr. Bailey). Plus, you can't miss the moment Meredith realizes that the hot guy she just slept with is also her boss.\n\n02 of 31\n\n\"Bring the Pain\" (season 2, episode 5)\n\nThis episode featured two of the show's most iconic moments: First, George (T.R. Knight) performs open-heart surgery on a patient while trapped in an elevator with Alex (Justin Chambers). And, more importantly, Meredith Grey delivers her \"Pick me. Choose me. Love me.\" monologue to Derek Shepherd (Dempsey) in hopes he'll leave his wife for her.\n\n03 of 31\n\n\"Into You Like a Train\" (season 2, episode 6)\n\nOn a macro level, \"Into You Like a Train\" featured one of several large-scale disasters (a train crash, duh). On a micro level, it's the one with two strangers impaled by a pole. That's exactly what it sounds like, and the doctors were forced to choose one of them to save.\n\n04 of 31\n\n\"As We Know It\" (season 2, episode 17)\n\nY'all, this was the legendary bomb in a body cavity moment. It was one of the show's first truly shocking and tense events (something fans have come to love and expect). It also featured iconic guest star Kyle Chandler.\n\n05 of 31\n\n\"Losing My Religion\" (season 2, episode 27)\n\nQuite possibly the most tragic hour of the show involved the deaths of both Denny Duquette (Izzie's beloved, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Doc the dog. It's also home to the show's most iconic music moment, featuring Snow Patrol's \"Chasing Cars.\"\n\n06 of 31\n\n\"Walk on Water\" (season 3, episode 15)\n\nThe ferry episode: The doctors of Seattle Grace conquer their first off-site mass casualty (a container ship crashed into a ferryboat, causing an explosion), while Cristina (Oh) and Dr. Burke (Isaiah Washington) try to find a non-awkward time to tell everyone they're engaged. It ends on one of the show's most extreme cliffhangers — Meredith falling into the water near the ferry crash and drowning.\n\n07 of 31\n\n\"Drowning on Dry Land\" (season 3, episode 16)\n\nIt's not Grey's Anatomy without a strong two-parter — the ferry crash continues into a second hour and the doctors are confronted with grieving families en masse, proving to be a pivotal learning moment for them.\n\n08 of 31\n\n\"Some Kind of Miracle\" (season 3, episode 17)\n\nFebruary 2007 proved to be a banner month for Grey's. This was a polarizing installment, with Meredith fighting for her life after almost drowning during the ferry incident and experiencing some wild side effects of her mini coma. In short, she sees the afterlife, kind of.\n\n09 of 31\n\n\"The Other Side of This Life, Part 1\" (season 3, episode 22)\n\nGrey's Anatomy goes on the road! Addison (Kate Walsh) takes off for Los Angeles to figure out WTF is going on with her life while things crumble back in Seattle. Backdoor pilot, anyone?\n\n10 of 31\n\n\"Didn't We Almost Have It All?\" (season 3, episode 25)\n\nIf it wasn't clear from the photo, Cristina's wedding to Preston doesn't quite go...as planned. (It doesn't happen at all, actually.) It's (obviously) a major turning point for the character.\n\n11 of 31\n\n\"Freedom: Part 2\" (season 4, episode 17)\n\nAs a season finale, this was chock-a-block full of plot. But the episode was most important for all of the relationship milestones (and anti-milestones?) that went down: Callie (Sara Ramirez) and Erica (Brooke Smith) share a kiss, Chief Webber (James Pickens Jr.) goes back to his wife Adele (Loretta Devine), and Derek and Meredith decide to rekindle their romance.\n\n12 of 31\n\n\"Elevator Love Letter\" (season 5, episode 19)\n\nThe medical drama doesn't always draw inspiration from world events the way Scandal preferred, but this portrayal of Owen's PTSD (which aired in 2009) was decidedly prescient.\n\n13 of 31\n\n\"Now or Never\" (season 5, episode 24)\n\nThe finale of season 5 marked the end of one iteration of Grey's Anatomy — starting the following season, new characters enter the show and new stories about the hospital begin to be told. Oh, and George O'Malley is dead and Izzie (Heigl) is battling cancer.\n\n14 of 31\n\n\"Sanctuary\" (season 6, episode 23)\n\nThis is the active shooter episode. Just. Watch.\n\n15 of 31\n\n\"Death and All His Friends\" (season 6, episode 24)\n\nThe follow-up to the shooter episode focused on the staff's critical injuries. Lexie (Chyler Leigh) and Mark (Eric Dane) work together to save Alex, and Cristina operates on Derek. Oh, and Meredith tells the shooter to kill her instead of her husband...a pivotal moment that is referenced in later Grey's episodes.\n\n16 of 31\n\n\"Dark Was the Night\" (season 8, episode 9)\n\nThis show loves to build you up just in time to tear you down (or is it the reverse? One can never really tell), and sometimes it tears you down just to tear you down some more. \"Dark Was the Night\" was the perfect example of the latter, one of those devastating episodes where the hits (like the news that Derek and Meredith wouldn't be regaining custody of their daughter) just keep on coming (like the death of Teddy's husband, Henry).\n\n17 of 31\n\n\"Flight\" (season 8, episode 24)\n\nOf all the medical disasters on Grey's Anatomy, the plane crash episode is the one that haunts fans' dreams, from the actual crash footage to the scene where Mark says a devastating goodbye to Lexie.\n\n18 of 31\n\n\"Remember the Time\" (season 9, episode 2)\n\nJust when you thought our long national plane crash nightmare was over, Shondaland delivered a crushing flashback episode! This one is a deep dive into the horrifying emotional side effects of being the victim of an aviation disaster.\n\n19 of 31\n\n\"Get Up, Stand Up\" (season 10, episode 12)\n\nOMG, it's the day of April (Sarah Drew) and Matthew's (Justin Bruening) wedding! Everyone thinks April is going to follow the Grey Sloan Memorial tradition and bail on the nuptials, but — spoiler alert! — Jackson (Jesse Williams) doesn't forever hold his peace, if you know what we mean.\n\n20 of 31\n\n\"Fear (of the Unknown)\" (season 10, episode 24)\n\nGet your tissues ready, because Cristina Yang is leaving. Her departure was the show's biggest at the time. It also meant the dissolution of Grey's most important relationship (sorry, Derek and Meredith).\n\n21 of 31\n\n\"All I Could Do Was Cry\" (season 11, episode 11)\n\nRemember all those Japril haters? Let's see them try to argue with the couple after watching them make a devastating decision about their unborn child.\n\n22 of 31\n\n\"How to Save a Life\" (season 11, episode 21)\n\nThere's no easy way to say this: Derek spends most of the episode saving four victims of a car accident and then gets hit by a semi as he's driving away. We said \"essential,\" not \"easy to watch.\"\n\n23 of 31\n\n\"She's Leaving Home: Part 1\" (season 11, episode 22)\n\nThe fallout of Derek's death gets an entire episode. Do we need to explain why that's important?\n\n24 of 31\n\n\"The Sound of Silence\" (season 12, episode 9)\n\nDenzel Washington directed this episode. If you somehow need to know any more about its importance, we leave you with this quote from Meredith (who is brutally attacked by a patient, with her subsequent treatment and recovery serving as the episode's main story line):\n\n\"In group settings, men are 75 percent more likely to speak up than women. And when a woman does speak up, it's statistically probable her male counterparts will either interrupt her, or speak over her. It's not because they're rude, it's science. The female voice is scientifically proven to be more difficult for a male brain to register. What does this mean? It means, in this world, where men are bigger, stronger, faster, if you're not ready to fight, the silence will kill you. Don't let fear keep you quiet. You have a voice. So use it. Speak up. Raise your hands. Shout your answers. Make yourself heard. Whatever it takes. Just find your voice and, when you do, fill the damn silence.\"\n\n25 of 31\n\n\"Unbreak My Heart\" (season 12, episode 11)\n\nThis is as close to a standalone episode as Grey's is likely to get. It follows the evolution of Jackson and April's relationship (you know, Japril) through a series of flashbacks and pivotal moments. \"Unbreak My Heart\" is also responsible for convincing fans — who were wary of April's feelings toward Derek Shepherd and Jackson's history with Lexie — to full-on ship Japril.\n\n26 of 31\n\n\"Be Still, My Soul\" (season 13, episode 18)\n\nThis episode was Pompeo's directorial debut and featured a landmark moment for Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary). In short, audiences meet Maggie's mom (LaTanya Richardson Jackson) and then she, well, dies. (This is Grey's Anatomy after all.)\n\n27 of 31\n\n\"Silent All These Years\" (season 15, episode 19)\n\nOne of the series' most powerful episodes centers around a woman's sexual assault and the women who come together to support her.\n\n28 of 31\n\n\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" (season 17, episode 4)\n\nWhen Meredith contracted COVID-19 and fell into a coma, fans saw a lot of familiar faces. (Derek! Lexie! Mark!) But there was one, in particular, that surprised viewers: the return of George O'Malley, who finally gave us some closure to his devastating season 5 death.\n\n29 of 31\n\n\"Helplessly Hoping\" (season 17, episode 7)\n\nAfter helping Meredith rediscover the joys of a relationship, Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti) became the latest Grey Sloan Memorial victim when he was stabbed.\n\n30 of 31\n\n\"Look Up Child\" (season 17, episode 14)\n\nAlthough the next episode, \"Tradition,\" would technically serve as Jackson's farewell episode, this is where you'll learn what you really want to know, a.k.a. what's going to happen with Jackson and April.\n\n31 of 31\n\n\"I'll Follow the Sun\" (season 19, episode 7)\n\nNineteen seasons in, the unthinkable happens: Meredith Grey decides to leave Seattle and head to Boston. Although Pompeo didn't leave the show for good and continues to narrate the series, this episode marks the character's goodbye to the home (and the people) she's been with since the beginning."
