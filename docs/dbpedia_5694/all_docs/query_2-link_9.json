        "text": "What is everyone like?\n\nMeredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) Meredith is the central character and narrates most of the shows. She began as an intern and is now a resident. She has had an off and on romance with Derek Shepherd, and they finally got married by post-it note. She calls herself “dark and stormy,” mostly due to issues with her alcoholic absent father who she feels abandoned her many years ago. She also had difficulty reconciling her mother’s long-term affair with Chief of surgery Richard Webber. She is best friends with Cristina Yang and they refer to each other as “my person.” She has a half sister named Lexie and she had difficulty accepting her when she first came to Seattle Grace Hospital, but they have slowly grown closer.\n\nCristina Yang (Sandra Oh) Cristina is a cardiothoracic surgery resident who is an overachiever. Her life revolves around surgery and she has been known to put surgery before the relationships in her life. She is best friends with Meredith Grey. For some time, she had a serious relationship with Preston Burke but he left her on their wedding day. She is currently in a relationship with Owen Hunt.

He began an on-and-off-again relationship with Meredith and they recently ended up marrying by post it note.

They have been able to come to a truce and appear to be helping each other through their trials in their new positions.\n\nAlex Karev (Justin Chambers) – Alex grew up in an unstable home.

He later begins to date Izzie and they got married while she was in the hospital with cancer.

The long hours spent at work caused problems between her and her husband and they ended up divorcing. Recently she has started to date Ben Warren (Jason George).\n\nRichard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) – He was the original Chief of Surgery at Seattle Grace Hospital. Years ago, he had an affair with Meredith’s mom (Ellis Grey), and the affair contributes to the tension between him and Meredith at work. He struggled with alcoholism in the past and when Seattle Grace and Mercy West merged, it caused him much stress and he ended up falling off the wagon. Derek Shepherd reported him to the hospital board, and he was subsequently demoted back to surgeon and told to get help for his alcoholism. Shepherd took over as acting chief in his absence and there has been a lot of tension between the two because Webber does not like the way Shepherd has been running the hospital.

She ends up leaving without telling him and he really feels the loss. He starts dating Teddy Altman but explains that he doesn’t want a fling, he wants a family, which is opposite of everything he has been up to this point.\n\nAlexandra ‘Lexie” Grey (Chyler Leigh) – She is resident and half-sister to Meredith (same father). She is known for her photographic memory. Initially, she and Meredith did not get along but have slowly grown closer. She dated Mark Sloan for quite some time but it ended when his 18 year old daughter showed up at his door pregnant and moved in with them.

She appears calm and able to counsel others through highly emotional situations. She is currently dating Callie Torres and has helped her with ‘coming out’ to her dad, although it doesn’t go well at all. Callie wants kids and she adamantly does not, so this is a point of contention for their relationship.\n\nCalliope “Callie” Torres (Sara Ramirez) – She is an attending orthopaedic surgeon. She got married to George O’Malley but they divorced because he realized he was in love with Izzie. Callie started a relationship with Erica Hahn but it was cut short when Hahn left the hospital over the lack of punishment for Izzie. She has since met Arizona Robbins and they are dating. She “came out” to her dad, who was not happy, but after cutting her off from his money and not speaking to her, he has begun to come around.

She began dating Alex Karev and their relationship had its ups and downs. She was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and had to undergo rigorous treatment. They ended up marrying in the hospital and she underwent surgery, surviving the treatment. Once back to work, she accidentally induced hyperkalaemia in a patient slated for renal transplant and therefore lost her job.
