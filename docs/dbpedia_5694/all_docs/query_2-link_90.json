        "text": "A lot has changed since Shonda Rhimes' Grey's Anatomy premiered on ABC in 2005. In fact, following the departure of Justin Chambers, whose character, Alex Karev, was dispatched with a controversial Season 16 storyline twist, the hit medical drama's only original cast members still on rounds are Ellen Pompeo, Chandra Wilson, and James Pickens Jr. Click ahead to look back -- and catch up -- with all your favorites.\n\nSpoiler alert: If Grey's Anatomy is new to you, then be advised that character storylines -- and exits -- will be discussed.\n\nPompeo, 50, is seen with husband Chris Ivery at a Los Angeles Lakers game in February 2020. After all these years, Pompeo is still playing Meredith Grey, and thanks to her contract, is one of the highest-paid actresses in the world.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the 38-year-old Williams was set to appear in an all-star Broadway revival of the baseball-themed play, Take Me Out. The production was suspended the day after Williams was snapped at this March 11, 2020, promotional event for the show.\n\nChambers made his final appearance on Grey's Anatomy in its 300th episode. In a statement announcing his departure, Chambers said it was time to \"diversity my acting roles.\" On a subsequent episode, Alex Karev was said to have moved to Kansas to be with (throwback time!) Dr. Izzie Stevens.\n\nSince her character checked out of the Seattle scene in Season 6, Heigl has starred in two short-lived series, State of Affairs and Doubt. She joined the cast of Suits in 2018. She's due next to appear in Firefly Lane, a Netflix series based on the coming-of-age novel of the same name."
