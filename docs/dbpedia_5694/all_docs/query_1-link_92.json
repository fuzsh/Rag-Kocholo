        "text": "Grey’s Anatomy has been one of the few shows I watch religiously, the first season broadcasted in 2005 but I only found out about it by 2012. So by the time I started watching it, 6-7 seasons had already been broadcasted. At first I didn’t understand what all the hype was about, I mean it is just a show about doctors, or so I thought. But then, when I started following it, I realized that Grey’s Anatomy is so much more than just a show about doctors.\n\nThe show revolves around Dr. Meredith Grey and her friends, their story – from starting out as interns to becoming doctors. It’s true that you don’t exactly need to watch the previous episodes to be able to enjoy the one you’re watching but unless you do, it’ll probably be hard to understand the story line. One of the many great things about this show is that even though one of the main characters is Dr. Grey, the producers never let other characters seem less important.\n\nOver these thirteen seasons, Shonda Rhimes, the creator of this show has won many hearts as well as broken them. The surprises and the shocks in this show have honestly, often left me numb- among other things. You never know while watching an episode if by the end you’ll be happy, bitter or sad. It is so unpredictable yet so consistent. It is exhausting.\n\nThe chemistry between characters, as the show proceeds sometimes gets a little confusing. There’s so much happening everywhere, whether it’s the friendship Christina and Meredith share, or the one Dr. Webber and Dr. Bailey share, it is annoying how well the pairings are.\n\nGrays Anatomy will make you shed tears, feel joy, it will make your heart skip a beat, it will most definitely make you want to stop watching it, but most of all, it will make you see the brighter side of things.\n\nMeredith Grey from the starting of the show has been dealt a bad hand, but how she gets through whatever is thrown her way is admirable. At one point, I wanted to yell at the creators and the producers to tell them to give the girl a break because that’s how emotionally investing the grasp of this show is. It will ruin your life, in a good way, of course."
