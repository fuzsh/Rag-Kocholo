        "text": "Early life and career\n\nPompeo is the youngest of six children born to Kathleen (née O’Keefe) Pompeo, who was a homemaker, and Joseph Pompeo, who worked as a salesperson. When Pompeo was very young, her mother died from an accidental drug overdose, a traumatic loss that shaped her appreciation of life. “My life started out with tragedy,” she recalled in a 2016 interview with Good Housekeeping magazine. “I was pathetically insecure. I didn’t have a mother to tell me how amazing I was.” After finishing high school, she worked as a bartender in Miami. She moved to New York City in 1995 and was discovered by a casting director while working at a bar and grill. She appeared in several commercials before landing her first television role in the legal drama Law & Order (1996). She made her feature film debut in the romantic comedy Coming Soon (1999) and continued working in television, making guest appearances on the shows Strangers with Candy (1999) and Strong Medicine (2001). She made her second appearance on Law & Order in 2000.\n\nLater life and career\n\nPompeo moved to Los Angeles in 2001 with the intention of establishing herself as a serious actress. In 2002 she garnered rave reviews as the love interest opposite Jake Gyllenhaal in the romantic drama Moonlight Mile. She continued to accumulate film credits in the early to mid-2000s, with roles in the crime biopic Catch Me If You Can (2002), the superhero film Daredevil (2003), the comedy Old School (2003), the action thriller Art Heist (2004), and the comedy-drama Life of the Party (2005). She made a guest appearance on the widely popular situation comedy series Friends in 2004.\n\nShe met her husband, music producer Chris Ivery, at a grocery store in 2003. They married in 2007, with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg serving as a legal witness. The couple have three children together.\n\nIn 2005 she landed the role of Meredith Grey, the surgical intern protagonist in the medical drama series Grey’s Anatomy. The show would eventually launch Pompeo and her fellow cast members into stardom. In 2007 the cast shared the Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. Later in 2007 Pompeo and the female cast and crew received the Lucy Award from the Women in Film organization, honouring their work in expanding opportunities for women in the entertainment industry. Pompeo went on to direct the “Be Still, My Soul” (2017) episode from the show’s 13th season, as well as “Old Scars, Future Hearts” (2018) from the 14th season.\n\nPompeo renewed her Grey’s Anatomy contract in 2017, agreeing to a two-year deal worth more than $20 million annually that made her one of the highest paid actresses in television. In a 2018 interview with The Hollywood Reporter magazine, she credited the show’s creator, Shonda Rhimes, with encouraging her to demand the deal that she deserved. She went on to become one of the show’s executive producers in 2022. When Grey’s Anatomy was renewed for its 19th season in 2023, Pompeo revealed that she would scale back her on-screen appearances while still serving as an executive producer and one of the show’s narrators.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In 2015 she was featured in the celebrity-studded music video for Taylor Swift’s hit single “Bad Blood.” Pompeo has often been recognized for her philanthropic work. She was the recipient of the Inspiration Award at the GLSEN 2018 Respect Awards, a fundraising event held by GLSEN, an educational nonprofit organization working to create safe and inclusive schools for LGBTQ+ youth."
