        "text": "Grey's Anatomy season 19 spoilers follow.\n\nGrey’s Anatomy is returning for season 20, and several main cast members will definitely be back.\n\nEllen Pompeo's Meredith Grey officially bid farewell to Grey Sloan Memorial in season 19, but fans can rest assured that the show's last two remaining original cast members, James Pickens Jr (who plays Richard Webber) and Chandra Wilson (Miranda Bailey), will return (via Deadline).\n\nThe outlet also reported that Kevin McKidd (Owen Hunt), Camilla Luddington (Jo Wilson) and Caterina Scorsone (Amelia Shepherd) have renewed their contracts and will reprise their roles in Grey's Anatomy season 20.\n\nRelated: Grey's Anatomy star Jeffrey Dean Morgan begged Shonda Rhimes not to kill him off\n\nThe season 19 finale ended on a major cliffhanger, with new hospital chief Dr Teddy Altman unconscious on an operating room floor and her fate left hanging in the balance.\n\nAlthough it looked like fans might have to wait until season 20 to see if Kim Raver's character has been killed off or not, it's been reported that Raver has also extended her contract.\n\nContract extensions are also likely for the actors who play the hospital's new group of interns – so that would mean comebacks for Harry Shum Jr (as Benson Kwan, aka Blue), Adelaide Kane (Jules Millin), Alexis Floyd (Simone Griffiths), Niko Terho (Lucas Adams), and Midori Francis (Mika Yasuda).\n\nMeanwhile, the episode marked Krista Vernoff's last as showrunner, as she previously announced that she'd be leaving Grey's Anatomy and its spin-off Station 19 at the end of their current seasons.\n\nRelated: Grey's Anatomy teases new love interest for Jo Wilson\n\nWhile it might be hard to imagine a Grey's Anatomy without Meredith Grey, creator Shonda Rhimes has said that the medical drama still has plenty of life left in it.\n\n\"I might be a very old lady by the time we reach its last season because it doesn't seem to be stopping, which is wonderful and I feel the world really belongs to the fans and the fans have been really clear about what they want,\" she said.\n\nRhimes continued: \"It's such an amazing show and it's doing so well as it's moving forward. I'm going to leave it alone and see where it goes, and we're going to stay a show as long as everybody wants to be there and as long as the fans want to be there.\""
