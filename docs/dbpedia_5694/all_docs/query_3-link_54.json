        "text": "”You have to wonder why we cling to our expectations. Because the expected is just what keeps us steady….. standing…… still. The expected is just the beginning. The unexpected, however, now, that’s what changes our lives.” - Dr Meredith Grey, Grey’s Anatomy\n\nMeredith is the central protagonist of ‘Grey’s Anatomy’, my favourite American medical drama TV series. The quote above is one of the hundreds that give deep insight. I am not much of a serial binger, but this series can keep me glued for hours together on late evening weekends.\n\nWhat makes it so addictive for me, I wonder?\n\nThis romantic medical drama teaches us all deeper truths of life and living, ethics and morality, friendship and competition and of course, love and loss like nothing else that I have come across so far. The beautifully scripted and casted characters are all Doctors. For some, the blood & illness can be sometimes overwhelming; But this bunch of highly competent, fiercely loyal and very competitive doctors have always given me a reason to come back for more.\n\nI believe that there cannot be a more perfect setting to explore human emotions than a hospital where people come, when they are at their most vulnerable, to be treated by Doctors, on whom they pin all their hopes to work miracles for their loved ones. Only to be told, many a time, at the end that they didn’t make it. How do you communicate that to a mother of a child or any loved one frequently through your work-life and come back to work the next day? And these doctors themselves are also honest to their flaws.\n\nThey are only human, after all.\n\nThe brilliant stitching together of their personal and professional lives, with the surgeries they do, the patient cases and families they deal with are very intellectually stimulating to say the least and tests your version of what it is to be a thorough professional. The courage required to make decisions that translate to life or death can Be mind-numbing and moving!\n\nI like every episode, every dialogue and every narrative that runs at the beginning and end of each episode because they are profoundly wise and insightful angles that touch me every time. Every character teaches viewers essential life lessons through their most distinct traits, flaws and personal dilemmas. It brings out the emotion in a way that no other show that I have seen so far can match.\n\nI genuinely experience an instinctive calm once I put on one of the episodes... And, there can be no man in the history of television to be as perfect as Dr Derek Shepherd. I can be left alone in a room with Grey’s Anatomy - all 16 seasons, and I will not miss anything. I am waiting for the seventeenth season."
