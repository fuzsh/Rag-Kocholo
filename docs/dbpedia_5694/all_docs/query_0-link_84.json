Why did Ellen Pompeo leave Grey’s Anatomy and is she returning to the series? Well, the answer is complicated.\n\nPompeo made her debut as Dr. Meredith Grey on ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy in March 2005. After more than 17 years and 19 seasons, Pompeo and her character left Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in the Grey’s Anatomy mid-season premiere on February 23 — but the episode technically wasn’t her last appearance ever. “For the record, it’s not really my final,” Pompeo told Entertainment Tonight ahead of the episode. “It’s a little bit of a trick they’re playing on people.”\n\nDeadline confirmed in August 2022 that Pompeo took a reduced role on the medical drama for Season 19 and signed on to only appear in eight episodes. Despite her reduced role, Pompeo will remain as an executive producer on Grey’s Anatomy, and she also appeared in the season 19 two-hour finale. Pompeo will make her second return to the series in the upcoming Season 20, along with veteran Jessica Capshaw, who starred as Arizona Robbins for seasons 5-14.\n\nPompeo reportedly left Grey’s Anatomy to star in the Hulu limited series about a troubled orphan, according to Variety. The new show will center around a Midwest couple who adopts a child they believe is an 8-year-old girl. Later, they start to suspect she’s hiding a big secret about her identity from them.\n\nKeep reading for everything there is to know about Ellen Pompeo’s Grey’s Anatomy exit, including when she’ll appear on the show again.\n\nWhy did Ellen Pompeo leave Grey’s Anatomy?\n\nWhy did Ellen Pompeo leave Grey’s Anatomy? Though the news of Pompeo stepping back from Grey’s Anatomy shocked some fans, the move has been a long time coming. “I’ve been trying to focus on convincing everybody that it should end,” Pompeo told Insider of the show in December 2021. ” I feel like I’m the super naive one who keeps saying, ‘But what’s the story going to be, what story are we going to tell? And everyone’s like, ‘Who cares, Ellen? It makes a gazillion dollars.'”\n\nEven in 2018, when the news of the $20 million-dollar deal that she signed with ABC in late 2017 to remain on Grey’s Anatomy became public, Pompeo was honest about the fact that she was losing interest in the show before she secured the highest paycheck of any woman on network TV. “What I said to Shonda is the truth: ‘I don’t get to do anything else, and that’s frustrating for me creatively. I make 24 episodes of TV a year, and as part of this deal, I cannot appear anywhere else. And directing is cool but, to be honest, it just takes me away from my kids,’” she wrote in a 2018 essay for The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAlong with her increased salary, Pompeo also started directing episodes of Grey’s Anatomy in 2017 during season 13 of the show. “Then I said, ‘So, it’s got to be a ton of money. And it has to help me with my producing because producing is something I really enjoy. That’s my creativity now,’” she continued in her essay for The Hollywood Reporter. At the time, Pompeo went so far as to describe acting as “boring” in the essay because, according to her, “an actor is the least powerful person on set.” She also noted that, because of her age, she thought it was “unrealistic” for her to set her sights on big roles in projects outside of Grey’s Anatomy.\n\nHow was Meredith Grey written out of Grey’s Anatomy?\n\nHow was Meredith Grey written out of Grey’s Anatomy? Meredith made the decision to move to Boston to work for Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) at the Catherine Fox Foundation and hopefully find a cure for Alzheimer’s Disease. (Williams left Grey’s Anatomy after 12 seasons in 2022). In her final episode, she said an emotional goodbye to Dr. Nick Marsh (Scott Speedman), whom she had begun dating. “I want you in my life if you want to be in my life. But if I have to choose, I’m going to pick me, I pick my kids, and I pick what’s best for us, and I’m not going to beg you to love me,” she told him. Fans were keen to notice the similarities between the scene and Meredith’s iconic “pick me, choose me, love me” speech to Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) in the show’s second season.\n\nAfter Meredith left Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital and Seattle on the February 23 episode, she became the final member of Grey’s Anatomy‘s original class of medical interns — which included George O’Malley (T.R. Knight), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) — to leave the series.\n\nKnight exited Grey’s Anatomy as a series regular on the season five finale, which aired in 2009. He returned to guest star on an episode in season 17. After making disparaging public remarks about Grey’s Anatomy and reported tension with creator Shonda Rhimes, Heigl appeared in her final episode of the show in a season six episode that aired in January 2010. Heigl hasn’t yet returned.\n\nOh, who played Meredith’s best friend Dr. Cristina Yang, exited the series in 2014 after 10 consecutive seasons in the role. She went on to pursue other projects and has yet to return. Chambers suddenly exited the series in 2019. He also hasn’t returned.\n\nWill Ellen Pompeo return to Grey’s Anatomy?\n\nWill Ellen Pompeo return to Grey’s Anatomy? The answer is yes! Meredith will be returning to the series in the upcoming Season 20. “[Pompeo] was a huge part of the premiere for me, she and I have a great relationship,” new showrunner Meg Marinins told Deadline ahead of the premiere. “She’s constantly in my head, her voice. She cares very deeply for the show and even in the episodes that she’s not in, she’s interested to know what’s happening. So, you’ll see her come and go and she will always remain a very important part to the show.”\n\nPompeo has also spoken about her future on the show, revealing that she doesn’t plan on completely cutting ties with Grey’s Anatomy any time soon. “It’s still Grey’s, [Meredith]’s still there in spirit and that’s the house that Grey built, so she’s always there,” she told Entertainment Tonight in September 2022 of her character. “She just has to step away for a little bit to do a Hulu show. It’s a great company to work for and I’m really, really lucky that they’ve given me the opportunity to do both, and so I had to take it.\n\nIn a November 2022 Instagram post, Pompeo thanked fans for their support. “I’m eternally grateful and humbled by the love and support you have all shown me, Meredith GREY and the show for 19 seasons,” she wrote in a photo caption. “Through it all….none of it …would have been possible without the best fans in the world. You all are RIDERS and you all have made the ride so fun and ICONIC!!I love you madly and appreciate you right back.” Once again, Pompeo assured everyone she’ll “definitely be back to visit.”\n\nGrey’s Anatomy premieres on ABC on Thursday, March 14, 2024, at 9/8c and streams on Hulu."
