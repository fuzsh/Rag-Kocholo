        "text": "Hello SpoilerTV. I’ve just joined the site as a show expert for Grey’s Anatomy. I’m new to this blog but not new to the show. Love love love it. I’ve written stuff about Grey’s before on my own blog and now have the opportunity to spout my often strong, biased opinions here on whatever subject you want. I love a good debate so feel free to disagree.\n\nThis is a 3 part series of blogs designed to help navigate the path to S8. Part one is the good, the bad and the just plain ugly. It's a long one, so here goes...\n\nSecond in the worst episode award is 712, Start Me Up, a dull filler of an episode which used up valuable screen time that could have been dedicated to really kick starting the true Chief Resident race stories.\n\nThe most subtle was from April, “Sparkle…that was the name of my pony” (re-watch 710 for the context!). Subtle and genius.\n\nMeredith, in 721, “My mother was about as nurturing as a steak knife”\n\nCristina, “\"She's mostly tubes and wires. And she looks more like a chicken than a baby. Like a featherless, beakless chicken. You want to wait until she's cuter.\" 719, It’s a long way back.\n\nI also loved Derek catching Bailey and Eli, at it, in the on-call room! Classic. 715, Golden Hour."
