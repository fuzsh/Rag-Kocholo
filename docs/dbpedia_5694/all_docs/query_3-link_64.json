        "text": "When is the right time to let the thing you love go? It’s something I’ve thought a lot about over the last few years as my relationship has started to strain. I’ve wondered whether it was me. I’ve stepped back, taken some time for myself. But ultimately, I have found myself crawling back to Grey’s Anatomy. After all, how do you give up nearly 20 years of history? And so I turn on my TV, load up Disney+ and there is my beloved, begging: “Pick me. Choose Me. Love Me.”\n\nI’m not alone in my co-dependent relationship with this show. Indeed, since it debuted in 2005, Grey’s Anatomy has carved a singular place in the television landscape. Following a group of surgical interns (basically junior doctors) at a Seattle hospital, it differentiated itself from other medical dramas at the time, like ER and House, by centring on the lives of women. Along with the show’s complex and morally complicated lead, Meredith Grey (played by the now-long-suffering Ellen Pompeo), the series introduced characters like Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Meredith’s driven and sometimes cold best friend, and the overly involved and emotional Izzy Stevens, a role that launched the career of Katherine Heigl.\n\nThe pace of Grey’s Anatomy was different, too. While medical stakes were often high, the show prioritised the personal lives of its characters, turning what could have been another workplace procedural into something rich and layered. This slower pace allowed these fictional characters to become fully realised. You cared just as much about Meredith saving her patient as you did about her next date with McDreamy, her neurosurgeon love interest played by Patrick Dempsey.\n\nIt’s this deep characterisation that helped it connect so deeply with audiences, and is likely why the show has lasted 20 seasons. It is currently the longest-running primetime medical drama in US TV history, still drawing in millions of viewers per episode. Its popularity was bolstered further after it worked its way to streaming services and introduced the show to a new generation of fans. Streaming also made binge-watching easier: now, at the click of a button, new and old fans alike could submerge themselves in the beautifully drawn and incredibly messy lives of Seattle’s finest surgeons. We’ve watched as the characters have suffered break-ups, make-ups, bombings, shootings, plane crashes, kidnappings, addiction, cancer and so much death.\n\nThis week it was announced that Grey’s Anatomy would return for a 21st season. I received this news with the same weariness I imagine the surgical interns at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital must feel after they’ve worked a 36-hour shift. Yes, I love Grey’s Anatomy, but after nearly two decades it is hard not to feel exhausted by it.\n\nWhile the show’s first few seasons remain impeccable (season two is, perhaps, the greatest thing produced for American network television), the quality of this drama has varied wildly. For every great moment – like the hospital shooting at the tail end of season six, or the blistering move to kill off the lead character’s love interest during season 10 – there are multiple ill-thought-out plotlines. Who can forget the musical episode (seriously, I wish I could forget it), Georgie and Izzy’s relationship, Meredith committing insurance fraud, and the entire existence of Owen Hunt?\n\nLater seasons, in particular, have dragged. During season 17, the show’s attempt to depict the harsh realities of the coronavirus pandemic for healthcare workers was admirable, but resulted in little momentum. For the majority of that season, Dr Meredith Grey was out of action after catching Covid. It felt like the beginning of the actor’s slow withdrawal; as Grey’s was recommissioned for its 19th season, Pompeo announced she would have a reduced role going forward (she is set to appear in only four episodes of the next season).\n\nIn fact, only two of Grey’s Anatomy’s original cast members remain full-time: Chandra Wilson, who plays the interminable Dr Miranda Bailey, and James Pickens Jr, whose character Dr Richard Webber is the hospital’s father figure. Even its creator, Shonda Rhimes, has relinquished the reins as showrunner (she remains an executive producer and the show is co-produced by her company Shondaland, which is also behind hits like Bridgerton, Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder).\n\nWith each departure, the parts that made up Grey’s Anatomy’s beating heart have been stripped away, at times leaving things limp. Naturally, resuscitation attempts have been made: most recently, in season 19, a new class of interns were brought in as a soft reboot hoping to capture the scrappy and energetic spirit of the show’s early run. But as any long-standing fan knows, sometimes a crash cart, CPR and high dose epi aren’t always enough.\n\nWhen Grey’s Anatomy premiered, the combination of Rhimes’s approach as showrunner, the impeccable casting (in particular the dynamics between Meredith and her best friend Cristina), and the consistently smart writing produced genuinely brilliant television. Despite the often-outlandish medical scenarios and wild life-or-death situations, the characters felt genuine. They were messy and contradictory and made mistakes. On a personal level, watching Meredith struggle through her mental health issues helped ease me through my own life’s messiness and hiccups. They might perform life-changing surgery and all have inexplicably good hair, but they were complicated in ways that made them feel wholly human.\n\nThat sense of humanity is why so many Grey’s Anatomy fans revisit the show, watching older seasons over and over again. Indeed, my own Grey’s viewing habits are unhealthy; each year, when the nights are long and the weather intolerable, I go back to the very beginning. But at a certain point I always stop. Cristina leaves and Derek dies and soon the show morphs into something that looks the same but feels entirely different. To misquote Meredith’s overbearing and callous mother: imagine my disappointment when I discover the thing that was once extraordinary is no more than ordinary.\n\nBut with the show now feeling like it’s on life support, the kindest thing might be to turn off the ventilator. I clearly lack the willpower to do so; each year I’ll embark on my rewatch and even continue to keep up with the new episodes. Still, for both my sake and the sake of the show, someone somewhere should make the decision and call time of death on Grey’s Anatomy."
