        "text": "We’re halfway through Grey’s Anatomy Season 20, but before we reunite with our favorite characters at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital we must survive yet another week without a new episode.\n\nPer ABC, the official Grey’s Anatomy Season 20, Episode 6 synopsis is as follows: “Mika and Teddy receive a patient from a nearby penitentiary. Catherine pushes back on Link and Monica’s treatment plan for a VIP. Bailey tries to integrate wellness into the residency program.”\n\nBut when can we expect the hit medical drama to return? We’ve got the answer!\n\nCurious if Grey’s Anatomy is new tonight, Thursday, April 25? Want to know when Grey’s Anatomy returns with new Season 20 episodes? Wondering how many episodes are in Grey’s Anatomy Season 20? Or if the medial drama will be returning for a historic Season 21?\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Grey’s Anatomy Season 20, Episode 6 (and beyond), including premiere date, time, and more.\n\nIs Grey’s Anatomy New Tonight (Thursday, April 25)?\n\nSadly, no. As we noted, there will be no new episode of Grey’s Anatomy airing on ABC, Thursday, April 25. The show is currently on week two of its midseason hiatus, but hang in there. A return is on the horizon.\n\nWhen Is Grey’s Anatomy Coming Back With New Episodes? Grey’s Anatomy Season 20, Episode 6 Premiere Date\n\nThe next new episode of Grey’s Anatomy — aka Season 20, Episode 6, “The Marathon Continues” — premieres on Thursday, May 2 from 9:00 to 10:01 p.m. ET with next-day streaming on Hulu. ABC will also be airing new episodes of 9-1-1 and Station 19 this night.\n\nWhen Does Grey’s Anatomy Season 20, Episode 7 Premiere On ABC?\n\nHave trust issues after a week with no Grey’s Anatomy and need to know when Season 20, Episode 7 is set to premiere? Join the club. Thankfully, ABC released Episode 7 details in advance.\n\nGrey’s Anatomy Season 20, Episode 7, “She Used to Be Mine” is set to premiere on Thursday, May 9 from 9:00 to 10:01 p.m. ET with next-day streaming on Hulu. According to the network, the synopsis is as follows: “An unexpectedly complex case brings back painful memories for Simone. Jules and Blue make a high-stakes bet on who can finish their procedure log first. Richard suspects Winston is avoiding him.”\n\nHow Many Episodes Are In Grey’s Anatomy Season 20?\n\nAs a result of 2023 WGA and SAG-AFRTA strike delays and schedule changes, Grey’s Anatomy Season 20 will be a shorter season, with only 10 episodes. While fans may be upset there’s only half a season left after the April hiatus ends, we’ve got good news…\n\nWill There Be A Grey’s Anatomy Season 21 On ABC?\n\nYes! ABC renewed Grey’s Anatomy for Season 21, which means the series will return in the 2024-2025 season for more.\n\n“The loyalty and love of Grey’s Anatomy fans has propelled us into a historic 21st season, and I could not be more grateful,” series creator and executive producer Shonda Rhimes said in a statement per Variety. “Meg Marinis’ storytelling is a gift that continues to keep the show vibrant, compelling and alive, and I can’t wait to see what she has in store for next season.”\n\nHow To Watch Grey’s Anatomy Live On ABC:\n\nWhen Grey’s Anatomy does finally return with new episodes, here’s how you can tune in live: If you have a cable subscription that includes ABC, you can watch Grey’s Anatomy live by setting your TV to the proper channel a few minutes before an episode airs. You can also use your cable username and password to watch live ABC episodes live on ABC.com or with the ABC app. And if your cable package includes a DVR, you can always record live episodes for later viewing.\n\nDon’t have cable? Don’t worry! There are other live viewing options, like live TV skinny bundles, which give you access to networks without cable. YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, and fuboTV, all come with ABC. But if you don’t have cable or a live TV skinny bundle, you can stream episodes the following day on Hulu. Here’s how to watch Grey’s Anatomy online.\n\nHow To Watch Grey’s Anatomy On Hulu:"
