        "text": "Grey's Anatomy is one of the most legendary shows of these past few years, and is still a fan favorite after 16 seasons. Let's dive into 10 stories about Shonda Rhime's creation.\n\nHow it was created\n\nThe show wasn't creation because Shonda Rhimes is passionate about the hostpital, but after she had a discussion with a surgeon. The latter told her how difficult it was to shave her legs in a hospital shower, which is quite original for a starting point!\n\nThe show could have been called... La s√©rie aurait pu avoir un autre titre\n\nComplications! If Grey's Anatomy is a direct reference to the book \"Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body\" from doctor Henry Gray, the initial title was very different since the producers wanted to call it Complications.\n\nThe very singular episode titles' of the show\n\nYou may not know this but all the episode titles of Grey's Anatomy are song titles. Even after 16 years, the show still honors music with its episodes, with an impressive consistency. And obviously, these songs are always linked to what happens in the episode...\n\nKatherine Heigl refused an Emmy Award nomination in 2008\n\nWhile she won the best actress in a supporting role Emmy back in 2007 for her part as Izzie Stevens, she asked not to be nominated the year after. Why? She figured her character weren't good enough in season 4 and didn't deserv a nomination...\n\nAddison Montgomery was only supposed to stay on 5 episodes\n\nThe character played by Kate Walsh wasn't supposed to stay, but she impressed fans so much - who immediatly loved her - that both writers and producers decided to give her a more important part. She then left the show to be the main character of her spin-off: Private Practice. She ended playing in 59 episodes of Grey's Anatomy.\n\nCharacters who could have been very different\n\nWhile fans can only think of Derek Shepherd & Miranda Bailey being Patrick Dempsey and Chandra Wilson, these two characters would have been played by two other stars of the show! Indeed, Isaiah Washington (Burke) auditioned for Mc Dreamy and Sandra Oh wanted Bailey's part.\n\nRealistic surgeries\n\nBecause they want to be very realistic and authentic in surgery scenes, the actors are graded for them to improve and master their movements. On set, they use real organs or animal, but if the hospital scenes are shot in a studio, the MRI scan is a real one!\n\nMeredith could have dated Preston Burke\n\nIndeed, even if Meredith and Derek fans can't believe if, Ellen Pompeo's character was supposed to be in a relationship with Burke, played by Isaiah Washington. But the actress didn't want that plot to go on as she is married to an African American man in real life, she didn't want her character to be too close to her personal life.\n\nA show without Alex Karev?!\n\nYou have read right. Grey's Anatomy could have existed without Alex Karev. The pilot was actually shot without Justin Chambers' character. But ABC, the network that broadcasts the show, wanted more male characters, and that's how he was created. Scene were even reshot before the airing of the episode.\n\nShonda Rhimes loves Buffy the vampire slayer\n\nYou may have noticed this but among the several guests stars invited on Grey's Anatomy, there are several that Buffy the vampire slayer fans know pretty well! Seth Green, who portrayed Oz, appeared in two episodes on the 4tg seasons, and Tara (Amber Benson), played in season 7. As for Adam Busch, aka the despicable Warren on Buffy, he came on as a med student in season 7. Shonda Rhimes loves Buffy and always talks about it!"
