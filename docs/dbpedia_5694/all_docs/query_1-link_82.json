        "text": "Doctor, doctor! Get these viewers a new medical drama to watch — stat!\n\nMedical dramas are one of the most popular genres among TV viewers, and we totally understand why. There’s nothing quite like the adrenaline-rushing storylines, secret hospital romances, and cheerful triumphs that keep us coming back for more.\n\nReady to get sutures–deep into a new medical show? These are the best hospital dramas and medical reality shows streaming now on Hulu.\n\nMedical Shows on Hulu\n\nGrey’s Anatomy\n\nWhen you think of medical dramas, the first show that comes to mind is probably Grey’s Anatomy — the longest-running medical drama on American airwaves. Set in Seattle, the show centers around Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her professional growth from medical intern to chief of general surgery.\n\nThroughout its 19 seasons (and counting), Meredith and her peers have experienced love, triumph, and heart-wrenching loss — both personally and professionally — keeping fans hooked since 2005.\n\nCatch up on Season 19 of Shonda Rhimes’ pillar show, Grey’s Anatomy, streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Grey’s Anatomy\n\nHouse\n\nDr. Gregory House, M.D. (Hugh Laurie) is an infectious disease specialist known more for his unconventional methods and blunt personality, and less for his bedside manner. Despite his prickly demeanor, House is undeniably brilliant in his ability to work through even the most baffling medical cases.\n\nWatch: House\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nIf you like your medical shows with a heaping dose of drama, you’ll love General Hospital — a soap opera series with over 15,000 episodes, which have entertained generations of mid-day TV watchers since 1963.\n\nCan’t watch the show live? Catch up on new episodes the next day on Hulu.\n\nWatch: General Hospital\n\nScrubs\n\nNot all medical shows are intense and serious. Take a break from the drama, and have a laugh at the expense of the peculiar staff and unpredictable patients at Sacred Heart Hospital. Whether you’re watching for the first time or just the first time in a while, this early 2000s hit hospital comedy starring Zac Braff and Donald Faison is a TV classic you won’t be able to get enough of.\n\nWatch: Scrubs\n\nER\n\nBefore there was Grey’s Anatomy, there was ER — the 1990s medical drama that made the mold and put George Clooney on the map. This TV classic follows the lives, loves, and losses of the doctors and nurses at Chicago’s County General Hospital.\n\nWatch all 15 seasons of ER streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: ER\n\nThe Good Doctor\n\nShaun Murphy is a brilliant but very young surgeon with autism and Savant syndrome. Follow along as he challenges the skepticism of the colleagues, who his condition prevents him from connecting with, by checking out our insider’s guide to The Good Doctor and by streaming all six seasons on Hulu.\n\nWatch: The Good Doctor\n\nPrivate Practice\n\nShonda Rhimes’ Private Practice is a spin-off of her hit medical drama, Grey’s Anatomy. This series follows Grey’s character Kate Walsh and her departure from Seattle Grace Hospital to join an upscale private practice in Los Angeles.\n\nWatch all six seasons of Private Practice streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Private Practice\n\nThe Resident\n\nWhen stuck between following the rules or saving a patient, the doctors at Chastain Memorial Hospital aren’t afraid to create controversy.\n\nThe Resident follows a young doctor, Conrad Hawkins, throughout his residency under the wings of a senior resident who isn’t afraid to expose the good, bad, and ugly of modern medicine.\n\nWatch all six seasons of The Resident now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: The Resident\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nThis fictional yet realistic medical drama takes place at the severely understaffed and underfunded Boston’s St. Eligius teaching hospital, where doctors and nurses take viewers behind the scenes as they navigate complex patients and their personal lives.\n\nAll six seasons of St. Elsewhere are streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: St. Elsewhere\n\nBody of Proof\n\nWe love a good genre crossover, and ABC’s Body of Proof gives us the best of both medical and procedural television.\n\nThis medical/legal drama follows Dr. Megan Hunt — a neurosurgeon-turned-medical examiner who uses her clinical background to crack tough criminal cases.\n\nAll three seasons of Body of Proof are streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Body of Proof\n\nTransplant\n\nBashir Hamed is an ER doctor who fled his war-torn home in Syria to find refuge in Canada. To continue his career in a new country, he must relearn everything from the ground up.\n\nWill this “transplant” take to his residency in the best hospital in Toronto? Watch select episodes of Transplant now with a Hulu + Live TV subscription.\n\nWatch: Transplant*\n\n*Live TV plan required to watch live content on Hulu. Regional restrictions, blackouts, and additional terms apply.\n\nSaving Hope\n\nSaving Hope is a Canadian TV medical drama with a supernatural twist. Set in Toronto at Hope Zion Hospital, Dr. Alex Reid works at the same hospital where her fiancé, Dr. Charles Harris, is currently in a coma. The twist? He can see the spirits of other comatose and deceased patients.\n\nWatch all five seasons of Saving Hope streaming on Hulu now.\n\nWatch: Saving Hope\n\nMedical Reality Shows\n\nDr. Pimple Popper\n\nWarning: This medical reality show isn’t for the squeamish. But if you can’t get enough of blackheads, lipomas, cysts, and keloids — this show is for you.\n\nDr. Sandra Lee (aka Dr. Pimple Popper) is a dermatologist with her own practice in Los Angeles, where she takes patients from all over the country desperate to find a solution to their skin condition. You may have even seen her viral videos on Instagram before the show got picked up by TLC.\n\nSelect seasons of Dr. Pimple Popper are available to stream now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Dr. Pimple Popper\n\nDr. Miami\n\nIt’s no secret — Miami is a hot spot for those seeking top-tier plastic surgeons, state-of-the-art facilities, and a warm climate for post-procedure recovery. In this medical reality show, the charismatic Dr. Michael Salzhauer (aka Dr. Miami on social media) gives a behind-the-scenes look at his Miami-based practice, sharing jaw-dropping stories of his patient’s cosmetic transformations.\n\nSeason 1 of Dr. Miami is streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Dr. Miami\n\nNight Watch\n\nWhat do you think is the busiest time of day for medical emergency personnel? If you guessed the middle of the night — you’re right.\n\nNight Watch is an emergency responder reality series that shows live footage of first responders handling the most intense emergencies imaginable. You have to see it to believe it.\n\nWatch: Night Watch"
