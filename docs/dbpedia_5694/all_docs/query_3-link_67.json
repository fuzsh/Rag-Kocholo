        "text": "In season three, Burke abandoned Cristina at the altar and then just took off, eventually winning a Harper Avery award elsewhere and then at some point, moving to Zurich, Switzerland to open his own hi-tech hospital. He got married, started a family, and then in season 10, he invited Cristina to his hospital to take it over for him as he retired.\n\nIsaiah Washington left the series after it was reported that he called costar T.R. Knight a gay slur during an argument on set, and all his defenses just kept making it worse before he finally was let go from the series. Apparently he and ABC made up, because they let him return for a second in 2014. His most significant role since was Thelonious Jaha on The CW's The 100, until his character died in season five, followed by Starz' critically acclaimed P-Valley.\n\nIntern Norman arrived in season four and had to fend off assumptions that he was an attendant, rather than an intern, due to his age. He messed up and told the wrong patient she was dying, and later he collapsed and had a stroke. He had surgery to remove the blood clot, and decided after his surgery that he was going to transfer to psych.\n\nEdward Herrmann, a fairly legendary actor, is mostly widely known as Richard Gilmore on Gilmore Girls. He also appeared in several episodes of The Good Wife, Harry's Law, and even American Dad before his death in 2014.\n\nOne of the biggest tearjerkers on this list, at the end of season five, George had just decided to enlist as a trauma surgeon in the army and was on his way to do so when he saved a woman from getting hit by a bus, only to be hit himself. He was in such bad shape when he got to the hospital that no one recognized him until he used his finger to write his nickname, 007, in Meredith's hand. They were unable to save him, and he tragically died.\n\nAfter several tumultuous seasons behind the scenes (including Isaiah Washington using the f-word while allegedly referring to him), Knight struggled with some of George's storylines and the fact that George barely appeared in the beginning of season five, and asked to be released from his contract.\n\nKnight returned to Shondaland in 2017 for an arc on The Catch, and has also appeared on The Good Wife, 11.22.63, and Genius, among other series. In 2019, he appeared on The Bravest Knight and in 2020, he appeared in HBO Max series The Flight Attendant with Kaley Cuoco. He also returned to Grey's for one episode to meet Meredith during her COVID-19 coma.\n\nErica Hahn and Callie Torres started a relationship that really may have gone somewhere, until Erica learned about the time Izzie Stevens cut Denny Duquette's LVAD wire in attempts to save his life. The heart that then went to Denny was taken from one of Erica's patients. When Callie refused to report the situation, Erica up and left the relationship and her job in early season five.\n\nBrooke Smith went on to appear in Bosch, Bates Motel, Supergirl, The Good Doctor, Chicago Med, and The Good Fight, and the 2019 film Bombshell.\n\nIzzie Stevens got cancer, married Alex Karev, survived the cancer, and then sorta just disappeared in season six. She eventually returned for a second and admitted she didn't feel like Seattle was her home anymore. Later, Alex got sent divorce papers, and now we know Izzie secretly had Alex's twins, lives on a ranch in Kansas, and became a surgical oncologist.\n\nKatherine Heigl's exit basically began in 2008 when she withdrew her name from Emmy consideration because she didn't feel like the material deserved it. In 2010, the character disappeared completely. She said in the years since that she would like to return to the character, but creator Shonda Rhimes did not. \"I'm done with that story,\" she told TVLine in 2015.\n\nHeigl, then a burgeoning romcom star, went on to star in a few more romcoms before returning to TV with State of Affairs, then Doubt, and more recently, she joined Suits and the 2020 series Firefly Lane.\n\nFor all the drama that most Grey's interns tend to cause, Megan just may take the scalpel. She got into a love triangle with Steve and Pierce, as she was dating Pierce, but slept with Steve, and then Pierce wanted to kill Steve, and Megan got pregnant by Steve, and then she later married Steve, and she hasn't been seen since season six after Derek Shepherd rehired her.\n\nMolly Kidder has done a few acting gigs since Grey's, including a guest spot on Outsourced in 2010 and some independent films.\n\nNurse Olivia was laid off during the merger with Mercy West in season six, but returned for a moment in season 14 when her son swallowed a toy while she was visiting her parents in Seattle. Of course, her son was treated by Alex, the guy who once gave her syphilis, and she had a lot of time to talk to Jo, his then-fianc√©e.\n\nSarah Utterback has made a few TV appearances in the years since leaving Grey's in 2009, including on the shows Reception and Mysteries of Laura.\n\nAddison, the woman who began as Derek's bitter estranged wife and eventually became a fan fave with her own spinoff, was last seen as a regular on Grey's Anatomy in that somewhat controversial musical episode in season seven, when she helped save Callie after her car accident. She also appeared in the 2012 episode where Meredith imagined that her mother was still alive and happily married to Richard, while Derek and Addison were still unhappily married and returned again for an arc in 2023.\n\nShe ended Private Practice married to Jake (Benjamin Bratt) with a son, Henry.\n\nShe went on to appear in Fargo, have her own short-lived show Bad Judge, star as a grieving mother in 13 Reasons Why, and help bring about the end of the world in The Umbrella Academy. She also stars on the 2020 show Emily in Paris.\n\nThe death of Lexie, Meredith's perky half-sister, was another major tearjerker, as she perished in one of the most devastating storylines the show has ever had: the plane crash. She never even made it back to the hospital (then called Seattle Grace) alive after being crushed by part of the plane while the love of her life, Mark Sloan, cried over her. She and Mark returned to reunite with Meredith during her COVID-19 coma and hinted that the couple found each other again in the afterlife.\n\nChyler Leigh starred in the hilariously named series Taxi Brooklyn before taking on the role of the badass Alex Danvers on Supergirl.\n\nMark, a.k.a. McSteamy, also died in the plane crash of season eight, but not immediately. He made it back to the hospital and lived for a few days, but his injuries were too severe. The hospital is now named in his and Lexie's honor after the rest of the plane crash survivors bought it with the money they won from their lawsuit. Mark returned with Lexie to visit Meredith in her coma, hinting that the couple reunited after death.\n\nEric Dane left the show to star in TNT's The Last Ship, which ended after five seasons in November 2018. He currently stars on the HBO series Euphoria with Zendaya and Storm Reid.\n\nRemember that OGYN resident who Jo dated back in season nine? They got into a fight after he found out about all the things she hadn't told him, and the fight turned physical, landing Jason in the hospital after he fell and hit his head. Alex convinced him not to press charges against Jo, and then he was never seen again.\n\nCharles Michael Davis went on to star in The Originals on The CW, then Younger on TV Land, then For the People on ABC, and Chicago P.D. on NBC. So he's doing fine.\n\nDr. Herman became Arizona's unreasonably demanding mentor in fetal surgery, though she seemed a lot more reasonable when Arizona learned about Nicole's massive terminal brain tumor. Amelia fixed the tumor, but Herman lost her eyesight and ended up leaving in season 11. However, she returned to help Arizona leave the show at the end of season 14 by offering her grant money to open a center for women's health in New York.\n\nGeena Davis starred in the Fox series The Exorcist in 2016, before her final return to Grey's. In recent years, she has had recurring roles on Netflix's GLOW and the animated She-Ra reboot series.\n\nCristina Yang went through a seriously tough time after the plane crash, and it took a long time for her to fully recover. Then she lost the Harper Avery award, discovered that while working at that hospital she could never win the award and began to realize she might need to move on. Her long ago love Preston Burke then invited her to Zurich to run the cutting edge hospital he had opened, so he could retire with his family. She left, after one last dance party with Meredith, in season 10.\n\nSandra Oh is currently one of the biggest TV stars, starring as Eve in the critically acclaimed BBC America series Killing Eve, for which she has won a Golden Globe. Like Geena Davis, she too also has a recurring role on Netflix's She-Ra and the Princesses of Power. She also also lends her voice to a character on Robert Kirkman's animated series Invincible.\n\nDerek Shepherd had a rough couple of seasons as he got a job working for then-President Barack Obama in Washington, D.C. and tried to make Meredith and the family come with him. She refused and they lived apart for a while, until he decided to make things right and move home to do the job more remotely.\n\nJust as he and Mer were happy again in season 11, he was on his way back to tie up some loose ends and happened upon a massive car accident. He spent hours taking care of the victims, only to then be hit by a truck as soon as he got back into his own car. The doctors at the hospital where the ambulance took him were unprepared for trauma and failed to get a head CT, leading to his death.\n\nPatrick Dempsey said that he left the show because \"it was hard to keep the storylines intriguing\" and he wanted to have more time to spend with his family, and he asked to be let out of his contract early. Since the end of his time on Grey's, he starred in Bridget Jones' Baby, a miniseries called The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair, the show Devils, and commercials where he reminds us he was once a TV doctor. He will also star in a rumored sequel to Enchanted.\n\nHe shockingly returned to Grey's for a series of dream sequences in season 17.\n\nCallie left Grey Sloan when her somewhat controversial girlfriend Penny got a fancy fellowship in New York. After losing a truly devastating custody battle with Arizona, she was going to stay in Seattle, but Arizona had a change of heart and sent her on her way with Sofia at the end of season 12.\n\nSara Ramirez left to take a new gig on CBS' Madame Secretary. They have since played the divisive Che Diaz on HBO's Sex and the City spinoff And Just Like That.\n\nPenelope's time at Grey Sloan was rough from start to finish. She arrived as Callie's new girlfriend with the reputation as one of the doctors who had killed Derek, and found herself having to work for a grumpy Meredith. Then when she got a prestigious job in New York and Callie decided to follow her, she set off the devastating custody battle between Callie and Arizona. Last we heard, she and Callie had broken up (hence Arizona's moving to New York), but that relationship was always doomed.\n\nSamantha Sloyan went on to star in The Haunting of Hill House as Leigh, and appeared on shows such as SEAL Team and The Rookie."
