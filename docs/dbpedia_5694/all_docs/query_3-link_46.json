The Bajan actor made his TV debut in Sweetbitter and then starred opposite fellow Grey's cast member Jake Borelli in romcom The Thing About Harry.\n\nGrey's Anatomy past characters: What major cast members have left the series?\n\nSandra Oh as Dr Cristina Yang\n\nBefore she became well-known for her starring role in Killing Eve, Sandra Oh was known to many as the fierce, career-driven and no-nonsense Cristina Yang. Starting off in the core group of interns from the first season, Cristina always prioritised work – that is until she fell in love with her senior Dr Preston Burke and then Dr Owen Hunt.\n\nShe is Meredith's best friend and \"person\" - the pair have gone through a shooting and plane crash together, after all - coining the term in the show's early seasons. Now, although she doesn't appear in the series, she remains one of Meredith's closest confidantes and works in Switzerland as the director of cardiothoracic surgery, as well as serving as a chief medical officer there.\n\nKatherine Heigl as Dr Izzie Stevens\n\nIzzie was one of the core group of interns that kicked off the series, going on to have some major storylines concerning patient (and eventual husband) Denny Duquette, battling a rare form of cancer and surviving.\n\nOften being the sweet-natured moral compass of the group, Izzie went on to marry Alex, get fired from Seattle Grace and eventually reconcile with Alex. So, it's safe to say that her journey as a character is far from linear.\n\nJustin Chambers as Dr Alex Karev\n\nFrom growing up in the foster care system to being the resident 'bad boy' in the hospital when he came on the scene with Meredith and their batch of interns, Alex had quite the character arc in his time on the show. He had an on-off relationship with Izzie, which petered out after her romance with Denny Duquette, and had his own fair share of heartbreaking storylines.\n\nAlthough he started off wanting to go into plastic surgery, he quickly shone in his eventual specialism of paediatric surgery and climbed up the career ladder, even filling in for Bailey as chief of surgery for a little while. He left in season 16 after finding out that Izzie had used the embryos they froze years ago and the pair rekindled their relationship, with Alex leaving Jo and moving to Kansas.\n\nTR Knight as George O'Malley\n\nGeorge got off to a rocky start when he was an intern at Seattle Grace, but after failing his intern exam and repeating his year at the hospital, George proved himself to be a great surgeon and became known for his elevator heart surgery.\n\nHe fell in love with Callie, and the pair eventually got married - but having always been in love with Izzie (and sleeping with her), George eventually came clean about his infidelity. The pair had a brief relationship but George decided he wanted to pursue a career in the army as a trauma surgeon.\n\nBut sadly, on his way home after his last day at the hospital, George proved how heroic he was once again and jumped in front of a bus to save another woman (in the season 5 finale). Despite being admitted to the hospital and his friends operating on him, his injuries meant he was unrecognisable until it was too late and he died.\n\nIsaiah Washington as Dr Preston Burke\n\nThe former head of cardiothoracic surgery, Preston went through his own trials and tribulations. Having gotten shot and developing a tremor that impacted his ability to complete surgeries, he was assisted by then-fiancée Cristina, but the whole ordeal put major strain on their relationship. Their romance was a major storyline until the collapse of their marriage.\n\nWashington was fired from the show after using a homophobic slur on set. In a statement at the time, he said: \"I can neither defend nor explain my behaviour. I can also no longer deny to myself that there are issues I obviously need to examine within my own soul, and I've asked for help.\"\n\nPatrick Dempsey as Dr Derek Shepherd\n\nThe original 'McDreamy', Derek was initially introduced in the series after a one-night stand with Meredith, with neither being aware that they'd soon be working together at the hospital.\n\nA renowned neurosurgeon and eventual board director, Derek and Meredith's on-off relationship underpinned the show's early seasons. Despite the rocky nature of their relationship, the pair go on to adopt Zola and have two further kids, Ellis and Bailey.\n\nHe went through quite the challenging period following the season 7 shooting and quit as chief of surgery, but eventually got his career back on track and went on to lead a brain mapping initiative. Unfortunately, Derek died after being involved in a fatal car accident and being taken to an under-staffed hospital which isn't primed to deal with his extensive injuries.\n\nKate Walsh as Dr Addison Montgomery\n\nA world-class neonatal surgeon, Addison went on to star in her own spin-off, Private Practice. Introduced in season 1 as Derek's estranged wife, Addison wasn't best pleased about his growing relationship with Meredith, creating quite the awkward love triangle. However, she then moved to Los Angeles to open her own practice, leading to her own six-season spin-off.\n\nSara Ramirez as Dr Callie Torres\n\nIntroduced in season 2, Callie was a senior orthopedic resident and went on to become George's love interest, with the pair getting married.\n\nAlthough she was generally disliked by George's friends, she went on to win them over through the years after having a child with Mark and later getting married to Arizona. Callie is one of the longest-running LGBTQ+ characters in TV history as well, having appeared in 11 seasons of the hit show.\n\nJessica Capshaw as Dr Arizona Robbins\n\nA preppy chief of pediatric surgery, Arizona is known for her upbeat way of handling things and rolling round the hallways in her wheely trainers.\n\nHowever, Arizona went through quite the dark period of time after surviving the fatal season 8 plane crash, living with survivor's guilt and her new reality after having her leg amputated. Although she and Callie divorced, she remains the proud mother of their daughter Sofia.\n\nEric Dane as Dr Mark Sloan\n\nHead of plastic surgery at the hospital, Mark was a ladies' man (known as 'McSteamy') and one of Derek's best friends, with the pair having grown up together. Although the pair were like brothers, Mark had an affair with Addison, but they later patched things up.\n\nHe went on to have an on-off relationship with Lexi, a child with Callie and, sadly, was one of the major casualties of the plane crash. Because of his and Lexi's death, the hospital was renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n\nChyler Leigh as Dr Alexandra Caroline 'Lexie' Grey\n\nMeredith's half-sister, Lexie was first introduced in season 3 after being transferred to Seattle Grace as a surgical intern. Eventually going on to become a resident, Lexie also only ever wanted to have a good relationship with Meredith, and would often pick up the pieces from their father Thatcher's destructive behaviour.\n\nIn her time at the hospital, she had feelings for George, a fling with Alex and an on-off relationship with Mark. Unfortunately, along with Mark, she died in the tragic plane crash of season 8.\n\nSarah Drew as Dr April Kepner\n\nOne of the residents from Mercy West that joined the hospital after the merger, April wasn't liked by many and held her religious beliefs close to her. Under the tutelage of Owen, she goes on to specialise in trauma surgery and marry Jackson, with the couple having two kids together.\n\nHowever, after the death of their first son, April goes to serve as a trauma surgeon in the army with Owen, leading to an irreparable rift, and so April and Jackson divorce.\n\nHaving initially been with paramedic Matthew earlier in the show, the pair eventually rekindle and are exposed when they get into a fatal car accident together. Afterwards, they split and April later decides to go to Boston with daughter Harriet and Jackson to run the Catherine Fox Foundation.\n\nJesse Williams as Dr Jackson Avery\n\nAnother resident originally from Mercy West, Jackson makes a name for himself (despite being from the prestigious Avery medical dynasty) in plastic surgery, working under the tutelage of Mark Sloan.

He eventually realises he would prefer to run his family's foundation in Boston, and so, with April and their daughter, they leave.\n\nKelly McCreary as Dr Maggie Pierce\n\nComing from quite the medical power couple (or affair), Maggie is the child of Richard and Ellis Grey, meaning she is the half-sister of Meredith.\n\nIntroduced in season 10, Maggie is starkly different from Meredith and is particularly perky, but she doesn't mess around when it comes to her career, having graduated from medical school at 19. Maggie eventually moves into Meredith's home with her and Amelia, often helping out with Meredith's children.\n\nWhile she does have a substantial relationship with Jackson, they break up and Maggie goes on to marry Winston. Ultimately, Maggie makes the decision to move to Chicago and further her career.\n\nGiacomo Gianniotti as Dr Andrew DeLuca\n\nRaised in Italy, Andrew was introduced as a surgical intern at the end of season 11 and became a resident in season 13. Always having a good moral compass, it came into its own when Andrew suspected an aunt and niece were really a girl and her human trafficker. Spotting the trafficker, Opal, again later in the show, Andrew is stabbed by one of Opal's accomplices and was treated at the hospital.\n\nHowever, he died from his injuries and later returned in Meredith's beach dream sequence in season 17.\n\nBrooke Smith as Dr Erica Hahn\n\nA recurring character in the show's second and third seasons, Erica was a workaholic who was a long-time rival of Preston Burke's.

Having regretted telling Cormac, Owen told him to forget about his near-death confession, but Cormac had to think about the ramifications of keeping the secret. He eventually handed in his resignation and moved with his sons back to Ireland, thereby keeping Owen's secret.\n\nGrey's Anatomy seasons 1 to 20 are available to stream on Disney Plus now – sign up to Disney Plus for £7.99 a month or £79.90 a year now.
