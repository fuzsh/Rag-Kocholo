        "text": "I'm going to fill you in on a super-secret, very nuanced storyline from Grey's Anatomy's 13th season. It's been really, really subtly woven in, and I want to make sure you're not missing out. Did you guys know that Riggs and Meredith maybe want to be together, but have conflicting feelings about it?! Seriously, don't beat yourselves up if you didn't notice. It's not like every single conversation the two of them have had somehow revolves around it or anything.\n\nThat's far more cynical than I like to be about Grey's Anatomy, or really about anything, but the Meredith and Riggs storyline has been painfully drawn out. The two of them kissed for the first time in an episode that aired May 12, 2016; that's almost a full year ago. Sometimes slow-burn romances are fun and sexy, but Meredith and Riggs's has devolved into talking in circles over the past several episodes. It's exhausting. Centering last night's around yet another bout of \"will they/won't they\" kept it from being a truly incredible, signature episode of Grey's.\n\nWhat's more, I want this to be an episode that's remembered for Meredith being a surgical badass, essentially performing brain surgery with no surgical instruments in the middle of a dangerously turbulent flight. I celebrate Meredith's decision to have sex in an airport bathroom with Riggs (even if I don't like the way he was behaving — more on that in a second). Truly! No sarcasm. I am 100 percent Team Meredith Grey Getting Hers and Also Grey's Remembering How to Be Sexy. But when it comes to the storytelling in this episode, I wanted this episode to be more about Meredith and less about Meredith as she relates to a man. The series has been so successful at exploring who Meredith is as Meredith since Derek's death, and it was a shame to see that fall apart here. I wanted more of Meredith, and less of Meredith and Riggs. I always want more Meredith.\n\nI'll even argue that there was a way to put Riggs on the plane with Meredith without making it about their romantic life by having Riggs LISTEN TO MEREDITH when she said she didn't want to talk about their theoretical relationship. When Meredith winds up sitting next to him on a plane and learns they're headed for the same surgical conference, she asks Riggs to leave her alone. She's got three little kids — this was supposed to be her me time!\n\nThey could've still worked together to save patients once the terrible turbulence hit, and it could've still been an opportunity for Meredith to open up about the plane crash (which we'll get to in a second, because holy shit). Riggs could have listened to her, which would have shifted the focus of the episode and prevented the story to going into a weird, \"Just keep badgering her until she says yes!\" narrative. I know men not taking no for an answer is supposed to be romantic or something but it's disrespectful to ignore someone who's asking you to stop doing something. And it reads particularly poorly when Riggs is refusing to take no for an answer after having followed Meredith into an airport bathroom. Something about him trying to convince her in that enclosed space felt claustrophobic and off.\n\nEssay question: Does this episode airing the week of the horrible United incident make it better or worse or have no effect? Explain your answer.\n\nEarly in the episode, Meredith and Riggs learn that they've both been in plane crashes, although his was a minor accident with friends in a small propeller plane. But can we talk for a second about the fact that Riggs somehow DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MEREDITH'S PLANE CRASH? He never asked why Meredith's last name was the name of the hospital? He never heard gossip about how Arizona lost her leg, or talked to Jackson about why he went into plastics, or figured out how the hospital's board members were chosen? I know Meredith isn't exactly the sort of person to waltz into a room of strangers and suddenly get emotional about her tragic past, but for Riggs to have no idea about the plane crash or Lexie is a little extreme.\n\nUnrelated: I really like that Meredith has been wearing the same style of cable-knit sweater for 12 years now.\n\nThat said, I think this is the first time we've ever heard Meredith talk about the plane crash in her own words, and it's incredibly moving, as are the repeated flashback montages of, essentially, every bad thing that's ever happened to in her entire life. I always love it when Meredith acknowledges that her life has been tragic as fuck and she talks about how people around her have a habit of dying on her. \"Sometimes I feel like I'm just waiting for my turn [to die].\" In this same conversation, she shuts down Riggs's request for a relationship by snapping, \"I'm married.\" This was out of left field enough that I thought she meant that she and Alex had gotten married in secret or something. Understandable that she still has lots of complex feelings around Derek! She's just never phrased them like that before and it caught me off guard.\n\nWhen he's not pestering Meredith about their relationship, Riggs spends most of his time tending to people injured in the plane's severe turbulence, alongside Meredith and a random (sexy) pediatric dentist. Riggs is mostly occupied with trying to save a passenger who goes into cardiac arrest and bracing the broken wrist of a flirty flight attendant (played by Kelsey Grammer's daughter Spencer). Meredith works with a young man with a brain bleed, which is a semi-depressing reminder that, YUP, she could've been a brilliant neurosurgeon if she hadn't quit for Derek. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with general surgery, but I'm still bitter that Meredith never truly got to choose. Her training is on full display as she's caring for her brain-bleed patient, as is the #YOLO style surgical practice with which she drills into his skull with a needle and syringe, and starts siphoning out blood through cocktail straws. It's a little bit like what Izzie did for the guy in the ferry accident, without the benefit of the drill and a whole lot like an episode of MacGyver. (I'd watch that crossover, for the record.)\n\nBut once the plane is safely on the ground, and the patients are loaded into ambulances, and the pilot has tacitly congratulated Meredith for a job well done, it's all about Meredith and Riggs again — the massive accomplishments of the episode take a backseat to their relationship. And it is a relationship now (I will light things on fire if they lapse back into \"won't they\" territory next week). It was a completely compelling hour of television and I'll probably rewatch it at least twice. I just wish its primary function hadn't been to send Meredith and Riggs walking off into the sunset together. At least she refused to hold his hand."
