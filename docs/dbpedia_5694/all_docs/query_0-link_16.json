        "text": "Grey's Anatomy won't be hanging up its white coat just yet.\n\nThe ABC series has been renewed for a 21st season, extending its run as primetime TV's longest-running primetime medical drama, according to show creator Shonda Rimes.\n\n\"The loyalty and love of Grey's Anatomy fans has propelled us into a historic 21st season,\" she told E! News in an April 1 statement, \"and I could not be more grateful.\"\n\nRimes also confirmed that showrunner Meg Marinis—who replaced Krista Vernoff at the end of season 19—will continue serving her current role. Praising Marinis, she called the showrunner's storytelling \"a gift that continues to keep the show vibrant, compelling and alive.\"\n\nRimes added, \"I can't wait to see what she has in store for next season.\"\n\nNews of the renewal comes just weeks after the premiere of Grey's Anatomy's 20th season, the first one since Ellen Pompeo stepped back from her lead role as Meredith Grey. However, the actress remains a part of the main cast as the show's narrator, with a new generation of physicians and interns—including Natalie Morales, Nico Terho and Midori Francis—scrubbing in.\n\nNow, only two other OG cast members remain on the Grey's lineup: Chandra Wilson (Miranda Bailey) and James Pickens Jr. (Richard Webber). But for the duo, Meredith's presence will always be felt at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n\n\"As far as our story tones are concerned, we still have that Meredith voice there,\" Wilson told E! News in 2022. \"The thing we've learned over the seasons is that Grey's maintains its feel no matter who is there, no matter which characters are there.\"\n\nPickens Jr. agreed, adding that their colleague \"will hover over the show as long as the show is in existence.\"\n\nWhat other TV shows are getting another season? Keep reading to find out."
