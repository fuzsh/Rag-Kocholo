        "text": "The season 20 finale saw Grey Sloan tasked with dealing with an influx of patients from a wildfire raging just outside Seattle. By the end, multiple characters found themselves at career crossroads with their jobs in limbo, prompting questions about their futures on the show.\n\nAhead of the 21st season, there have already been some confirmed major changes relating to the cast.\n\nBoth Midori Francis (who plays surgical intern Mika Yasuda) and Jake Borelli (who plays surgical resident Levi Schmitt) will be departing the series, with both actors in talks as to how their storylines will wrap up next season.\n\nMore like this\n\nFurther shake-ups include Grey's moving from its regular 9pm slot on ABC in the US to 10pm, which has caused many to think the show could be coming to a potential end.\n\nBut Disney TV Group president Craig Erwich has said (via Deadline): \"I think the show is creatively firing on all cylinders and continues to be extraordinarily popular — if not the most popular show in terms of past seasons.\"\n\nThe season 20 finale might have landed in the US, but when can fans in the UK watch the dramatic ending?\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about how to watch Grey's Anatomy season 20.\n\nGrey's Anatomy season 20 premiered in the US on Thursday 14th March 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the season landed in the UK on Disney Plus just two weeks later, on 28th March 2024, with episodes airing weekly from then on.\n\nThe delay in production and transmission remains due to last year's SAG-AFRA and WGA strikes, which have now lifted.\n\nThe season consists of only 10 episodes – the shortest since the first season - due to the delay.\n\nIt was confirmed in March of this year that the show would be back for another season, with Meg Marinis taking over as showrunner from Krista Vernoff.\n\nIn fact, if creator Shonda Rhimes has anything to do with it, it seems like we may be continuing to see Grey's Anatomy on our screens for many years to come.\n\nRhimes told Deadline: \"I might be a very old lady by the time we reach its last season because it doesn’t seem to be stopping, which is wonderful, and I feel the world really belongs to the fans and the fans have been really clear about what they want.\n\n\"It’s such an amazing show and it’s doing so well as it’s moving forward. I’m going to leave it alone and see where it goes, and we’re going to stay a show as long as everybody wants to be there and as long as the fans want to be there.\"\n\nGrey's Anatomy season 20 release schedule – when is episode 9 out?\n\nThe show returned from its brief midseason hiatus with episode 6 on Disney Plus on Thursday 16th May. The sixth episode aired on ABC at 9am ET on Thursday 2nd May. The episode then became available to stream the next day on Hulu.\n\nSince then, we have been back to weekly releases.\n\nThe confirmed release schedule in the UK for the second half of season 20's episodes is as follows:\n\nSeason 20 episode 6 - Thursday 16th May (out now)\n\nSeason 20 episode 7 - Thursday 23rd May (out now)\n\nSeason 20 episode 8 - Thursday 30th May (out now)\n\nSeason 20 episode 9 - Thursday 6th June\n\nSeason 20 episode 10 - Thursday 13th June\n\nGrey's Anatomy cast – Who's back for season 20?\n\nThe following main cast members have returned for Grey's Anatomy season 20.\n\nChandra Wilson as Dr Miranda Bailey\n\nJames Pickens Jr as Dr Richard Webber\n\nKevin McKidd as Dr Owen Hunt\n\nCaterina Scorsone as Dr Amelia Shepherd\n\nCamilla Luddington as Dr Jo Wilson\n\nKim Raver as Dr Teddy Altman\n\nJake Borelli as Dr Levi Schmitt\n\nChris Carmack as Dr Atticus Lincoln\n\nAnthony Hill as Dr Winston Ndugu\n\nAlexis Floyd as Dr Simone Griffith\n\nHarry Shum Jr as Dr Benson 'Blue' Kwan\n\nAdelaide Kane as Dr Jules Millin\n\nMidori Francis as Dr Mika Yasuda\n\nNiko Terho as Dr Lucas Adams\n\nEllen Pompeo as Dr Meredith Grey\n\nScott Speedman as Dr Nick Marsh\n\nJessica Capshaw as Dr Arizona Robbins\n\nAlex Landi as Dr Nico Kim\n\nNatalie Morales as Dr Monica Beltran\n\nMeredith Grey star Ellen Pompeo is no longer a full-time on-screen cast member after she left early in season 19.\n\nPompeo returned for the season 19 finale and continues to narrate the series, but isn't expected to play a major role in future.\n\nHowever, given the developments in Meredith's research into Alzheimer's disease in the season 19 finale, Meredith is continuing to appear in the series on a recurring basis in two to four of the 10 episodes, as well as narrating all episodes and receiving star billing.\n\nElsewhere, Scott Speedman is back as Dr Nick Marsh, Meredith's love interest and a tutor to the interns.\n\nAdditionally, former series regulars Kate Walsh and Jesse Williams have also returned in recurring roles as Dr Addison Forbes Montgomery and Dr Jackson Avery, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly McCreary also left the series in season 19, and isn't expected to return for season 20 as Dr Maggie Pierce in a regular capacity. However, the door has been left open for a return.\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter, McCreary said: \"I love that about the show, that people come back. I think it’s open. I think that’s a question for Meg Marinis, who is the new showrunner. But I am open to it and I think the storyline leaves it pretty open.\"\n\nShe later added: \"It seems like even though she’s gone to Chicago, Maggie and Winston’s story isn’t over. I’m happy to see there’s still love, respect — and, of course, a lot of heat between them.\"\n\nElsewhere, Levi's former love interest Dr Nico Kim, played by Alex Landi, is back for season 20, alongside recurring characters Dr Catherine Fox (Debbie Allen) and Dr Taryn Helm (Jaicy Elliot).\n\nBack in February, it was announced that Dr Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), who was last seen at the end of season 14, would return to Grey Sloan Memorial in season 20 as a guest star in the fourth episode of the season, as well as Dr Nico Kim (Alex Landi).\n\nNico was a mainstay on the show from seasons 15 through to 18, being in an off-on relationship with Dr Levi Schmitt (Jake Borelli), so we'll just have to wait and see how the pair react when they cross paths once again.\n\n\"With Levi and Nico, you will see how they interact with one another now that time has passed,\" revealed Marinis to Deadline.\n\n\"They’ve both done a lot of growing in between seeing each other. Nico is not the same Nico that we saw, it’s been some time. Also Levi has done a lot of growing up as a doctor and he’s had a couple of romantic things happen since Nico. And I think seeing each other in these different parts of their lives, it’s really nice. It’s a great story for Levi.\"\n\nOther guest stars confirmed for the new series include Natalie Morales (Dead to Me) as Monica Beltran, a paediatric surgeon \"whose pragmatism and level-headedness have made her one of the best in her field\", according to Deadline.\n\nFreddy Miyares (When They See Us) will also feature as Dorian, a patient who is involved in a major accident and is struggling with his future.\n\nGrey's Anatomy season 20 episodes\n\nThe twentieth season of Grey's Anatomy will consist of 10 episodes.\n\nWe've Only Just Begun - Meredith rethinks her plans after going rogue in last season’s finale. The interns are on thin ice following a patient’s death, but Simone and Lucas are immediately tested in an emergency. Richard confides in Bailey, and Teddy’s fate is revealed.\n\nKeep the Family Close - Bailey tells the interns they must complete dozens of basic procedures before being allowed back in surgery. Meanwhile, things are awkward between Simone and Lucas, and Amelia comes up with a solution to a complicated surgery.\n\nWalk on the Ocean - Meredith and Amelia work to secure funds for their research while Amelia finds herself at odds with a new attending. Levi runs into someone from his past, and Owen gives Winston advice. Lucas ditches Mika, forcing her to treat a patient alone.\n\nBaby Can I Hold You - Dr Arizona Robbins returns to Grey Sloan for a particularly complicated case. The interns are interrogated about their past mistakes, while Teddy is eager to return to work after her health scare.\n\nNever Felt So Alone - It’s all hands on deck at Grey Sloan when a group of medical students is injured by a floor collapsing at their white coat party. Jo and Link are forced to talk about the future, while Jules confronts Winston about his attitude.\n\nThe Marathon Continues - Mika and Teddy receive a patient from a nearby penitentiary; Catherine pushes back on Link and Monica's treatment plan for a VIP; Bailey tries to integrate wellness into the residency programme.\n\nShe Used to Be Mine - An unexpectedly complex case brings back painful memories for Simone; Jules and Blue make a high-stakes bet on who can finish their procedure log first; Richard suspects Winston is avoiding him.\n\nBlood, Sweat and Tears\n\nI Carry Your Heart\n\nBurn It Down\n\nWhat will be the plot of Grey's Anatomy season 20?\n\nThe series continues the plot thread of Meredith's potentially controversial research into Alzheimer's disease after setting up the new storyline in the finale - as she secretly teams up with sister-in-law Amelia against the wishes of Catherine!\n\nMeanwhile, we have a host of romantic pairings who are in happy places as of the finale too, despite how complicated their living arrangements are including Meredith and Nick, plus Maggie and Winston.\n\nThe following romantic pairings will need further examination:\n\nDr Meredith Grey and Dr Nick Marsh\n\nDr Miranda Bailey and Dr Ben Warren\n\nDr Richard Webber and Dr Catherine Fox\n\nDr Owen Hunt and Dr Teddy Altman\n\nDr Jo Wilson and Dr Atticus 'Link' Lincoln\n\nDr Maggie Pierce and Dr Winston Ndugu\n\nDr Simon Griffith and Dr Lucas Adams\n\nDr Benson 'Blue' Kwan and Dr Jules Millin\n\nDr Mika Yasuda and Dr Taryn Helm\n\nBailey will also be back in charge of the interns who are exploring who’s to blame for their mistakes in the finale from last season and into this current run.\n\nMuch will also be focused on Teddy's recovery after ending up in a life-or-death situation in the finale of last season and the premiere from this season.\n\nSeason 20 is about \"back to basics\", according to showrunner Meg Marinis.\n\nSo, that's a lot of drama to continue! The 20th season of Grey's Anatomy also comes at the same time as the final season of Station 19, the firefighter spin-off to Grey's. There's set to be one final major crossover for the two shows, meaning that a big disaster could be on the cards that warrants both teams being involved.\n\nShowrunner Marinis teased that Bailey’s husband Ben (Jason George) and Carina (Stefania Spampinato) will be making an appearance on Grey's Anatomy, but will they continue to feature in the medical drama after the end of Station 19?\n\nMarinis told Deadline: \"I don’t want to answer that because I don’t want to answer anything about Station 19 that I’m not only fully aware of. How they end their stories will help me determine whether or not I will be seeing those characters on Grey’s.\"\n\nIs there a trailer for Grey's Anatomy season 20?\n\nYes, a trailer for Grey's Anatomy season 20 has been released.\n\nCatch it below, including seeing Teddy in a dangerous situation, plus further appearances from Meredith and Nick!\n\nGrey's Anatomy seasons 1 to 20 are available to stream on Disney Plus now – sign up to Disney Plus for £7.99 a month or £79.90 a year now. Season 18 is also available on Sky and NOW with new episodes airing on Sky Witness in the UK."
