Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead on for 24 things you probably didn't know about the hit medical drama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show's title comes from a real medical textbook.\n\nThe anatomy book \"Gray's Anatomy,\" written by Henry Gray, is still in print today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Grey's Anatomy\" wasn't actually the original show title.\n\nKate Walsh, who played Addison Montgomery on the show, told BuzzFeed in 2017 that the show's name was changed three times before \"Grey's Anatomy\" was chosen.\n\n\"It was 'Doctors' and then 'Surgeons' and then 'Complications' and I was like, 'What a b------- show title!' Walsh recalled. \"'Grey's Anatomy' is the perfect title.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA real hospital is used for some scenes.\n\nThe Veterans Administration Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in California serves as the entrance for Grey Sloan Memorial, according to Los Angeles magazine.\n\nBut the interior shots are done on a soundstage at Loz Feliz's Prospect Studios, according to the outlet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly three of the main season-one cast members are still on the show.\n\nAfter over 300 episodes, Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey), Chandra Wilson (Miranda Bailey), and James Pickens Jr. (Richard Webber) are the only original leads who are still on the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBohkee is a scrub nurse in real life.\n\nShe may not say much, but she's been a staple background character of the show for years.\n\nAnd according to a 2013 tweet from Sandra Oh, who played Cristina Yang, Bokhee really knows what she's doing.\n\n\"The nurse in that scene, Bokhee, is a real surgical nurse,\" Oh wrote. \"She's been with us since the beginning. She's like my 2nd mom, she's the best.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show takes its medical scenes seriously.\n\nAccording to McKenna Princing, who wrote about being a medical advisor on the show for UW Medicine in 2017, the series employs real doctors to make sure the writers are getting some procedures and jargon right.\n\nBut until the advisors filled in the jargon, the writers just put \"medical medical\" as placeholder text in the script, according to show creator Shonda Rhimes' book \"Year of Yes.\"\n\nRhimes wrote, \"Meredith will say, 'I need a medical medical to medical!' And someone else will go, 'Well I have medical medical.' 'Well hand me the medical!\"\n\nShe also revealed that on the show \"Scandal,\" it's \"political political.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organs and fake blood are made from some pretty nasty materials.\n\nTo make the surgeries look real, Sarah Drew, who played April Kepner on the series, said that they use cow organs and fake blood made up of chicken fat and red gelatin.\n\n\"The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag,\" she said, according to RTE. \"And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh ... It's pretty gross.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKatherine Heigl rejected her Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Izzie Stevens.\n\nIn 2008, Heigl opted out of her Emmy nomination for \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, she said in a statement that she didn't feel the writers had \"given [her] the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination\" and she \"did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials.\"\n\nPer Us Weekly, Heigl left the show shortly after in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the stars have also directed episodes.\n\nAccording to Bustle, Wilson (Miranda Bailey), Debbie Allen (Catherine Avery), Kevin McKidd (Owen Hunt), Jesse Williams (Jackson Avery), and Meredith Grey herself, Pompeo, have all directed episodes of the long-running series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show helped to raise awareness for a critical illness.\n\n\"Scrubs alum\" Sarah Chalke appeared in the season-nine episode \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" to raise awareness for Kawasaki disease.\n\nAccording to TV Line, the episode is based on her real-life fighting for answers about her baby's mystery illness that turned out to be the rare Kawasaki disease.\n\nIt can kill within days, but her son survived thanks to her finding a web article about Kawasaki symptoms that matched her son's.\n\nNow Chalke is dedicated to bringing the disease to national attention, especially since there's such a short window that it can be treated in.\n\n\"The Kawasaki doctor we dealt with said they do a news story every year, and often that save lives every year,\" Chalke told TV Line. \"So she said that this [\"Grey's Anatomy\"] episode absolutely is going to save lives. It's going to save some kids.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been two spin-offs from \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\n\"Private Practice\" followed Addison Montgomery's transfer to a California clinic. It ran for six seasons and ended in 2013.\n\nIn 2018, \"Station 19\" premiered, following Ben Warren as he changed jobs from doctor to firefighter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerek and Meredith had a real wedding registry.\n\nPeople reported in 2009 that the fictional couple had a real wedding registry on The Knot.\n\nIt encouraged fans to donate to research organizations that Derek and Meredith would have approved of, like the American Academy of Neurology Foundation and the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Grey's Anatomy\" scrubs are used in real hospitals.\n\nBarco Uniforms and ABC partnered in 2006 to produce hospital-grade scrubs under the \"Grey's Anatomy\" label, according to Metro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe character Miranda Bailey is partially inspired by Shonda Rhimes' mom.\n\nThe beloved chief of surgery has been on the show since season one and came straight from Rhimes' real life, according to an interview she gave to O magazine.\n\n\"She's very no-nonsense. Dr. Bailey says stuff like 'These people are nasty — all they think about is sex while we're trying to save lives here.' My mother is definitely that kind of realist,\" Rhimes said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChambers is nothing like his character.\n\nKarev was long known for his commitment-phobe ways and fear of ever settling down.\n\nMeanwhile, Chambers came to the show as a married father of five kids, according to Cosmopolitan. The actor later left the show after playing Karev for 15 years so he could focus on his family and other projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCamilla Luddington, who plays Jo Wilson, is actually British.\n\nShe does an awfully good American accent on \"Grey's Anatomy,\" but you can catch her speaking in her native accent in Lifetime's \"William and Kate,\" a TV movie about Prince William and Kate Middleton's love story.\n\nLuddington played Middleton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery \"Grey's Anatomy\" title is a song title except for one.\n\nSince its premiere episode, \"A Hard Day's Night,\" every \"Grey's Anatomy\" episode has shared its title with a song, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nBut one exception was made for the season-14 episode \"1-800-799-7233.\" It was named for the domestic-violence hotline since the episode dealt with Jo Wilson's abusive ex-husband, per Glamour.\n\nJesse Williams was a teacher before he played Jackson Avery.\n\nAccording to Essence magazine, Williams once taught high-school history before he made the jump to acting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerek Shepherd was almost played by Rob Lowe.\n\nAccording to E! News, Lowe wrote in his memoir that he was offered the role of Derek Shepherd but turned it down for a CBS show called \"Dr. Vegas\" that failed to make it.\n\nInstead, McDreamy was played by Patrick Dempsey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRhimes loves to use some of the same actors in her projects.\n\nMany people who have appeared on \"Grey's Anatomy\" have also appeared on Rhimes' other shows like \"Scandal.\"\n\nNotably, per ScreenRant, Meredith's dad is also Cyrus Beene on \"Scandal,\" Teddy's love interest Henry is also Jake on \"Scandal,\" and Meredith's mom is also Sally Langston on \"Scandal.\"\n\nAnd that's just to name a few.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPompeo and Dempsey didn't originally know that Derek was married during season one.\n\nThe first season finale reveals that Derek is still married to Addison Montgomery, a fact that Dempsey didn't learn until halfway through the season and Pompeo didn't know until the final episode, according to a since-deleted behind-the-scenes video.\n\n\"They didn't tell me that was coming and I was very surprised,\" Pompeo said.\n\nDrew gave birth in real life right after filming April's birth scene.\n\nAccording to Access Hollywood, after shooting April's labor and delivery over a long 10-hour workday, a pregnant Drew went home and found herself in labor for real a few hours later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nTV Show TV\n\nAdvertisement"
