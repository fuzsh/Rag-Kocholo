On Thursday (August 8), it was revealed that Michael would play the character, whose name is James.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…\n\nTVLine broke the news about the cast addition, noting that the character is an openly gay Episcopal chaplain who is headed to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n\nHere’s a bit about his character: “He holds a special place in his heart for his younger patients, and his warmth, training and spirituality make him comfortable and confident in any situation. In his personal life, James finds himself at a crossroads where he is open to love and taking great leaps of faith.”\n\nYou’ll recognize Michael from Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, where he plays Leif.\n\nSeason 21 of Grey’s Anatomy premieres on September 26, and it’ll air at 10pm ET."
