        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"Grey's Anatomy's\" 19th season returned on February 23.\n\nOver the course of its 407 episodes (and counting), there have been 34 series regulars.\n\nOnly three actors have remained the entire time: Ellen Pompeo, Chandra Wilson, and James Pickens Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimone Griffith: 7 episodes (season 19)\n\nSeason 19 brought in a fresh batch of interns, each with a reason why they're stuck as the first class at the revamped Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\nSimone, it was revealed during the season, experienced sexism and racism at her last hospital, and eventually lashed out and was expelled from her program, leading her to Grey Sloan ... which just so happens to be the hospital her mother died at while giving birth to her.\n\nBenson Kwan: 7 episodes (season 19)\n\nKwan, as he's called, is at Grey Sloan because when his mother got sick, he essentially dropped out of school to help take care of her, and then when she died, he stopped caring about his grades and couldn't get into a top-tier medical school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJules Millin: 7 episodes (season 19)\n\nWe don't know much about Jules yet, except for that she hooked up with Link during a one-night stand before she started at Grey Sloan, and that she has a sort of no-strings-attached thing going on with Kwan.\n\nShe's also mentioned in passing that her parents were free-spirited hippies, and that she's the only responsible one in her family.\n\nMika Yasuda: 7 episodes (season 19)\n\nYasuda is one of eight kids, so she's determined to make herself stand out from both her siblings and her intern class. Much like Callie Torres before her, Yasuda lives out of her van so she's always close to the hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucas Adams: 7 episodes (season 19)\n\nAdams has the most interesting backstory — he's secretly Meredith and Amelia's nephew, as his mother is one of Derek and Amelia's sisters, though we don't know which one yet.\n\nHe kept his family a secret because he didn't want to be judged by the rest of the interns, but eventually revealed the truth when his classmates became convinced he was sleeping with Amelia (his aunt).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNick Marsh: 25 episodes (season 14, 18-present)\n\nSpeedman's character, Nick, was first introduced in a season 14 episode as a patient of Meredith's who needed a liver transplant. The two connected, and it helped Meredith move on from Derek's death a tiny bit.\n\nSpeedman returned as a series regular in season 18 after Nick and Meredith run into each other at a hotel in Minnesota. Now, with Ellen Pompeo departing \"Grey's\" as a series regular, Nick's future at Grey Sloan Memorial is a little up in the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErica Hahn: 25 episodes (season 2-5)\n\nErica Hahn first appeared in season two as a rival heart surgeon for Burke, whose patient unfortunately loses his potential heart donor to a little patient named Denny Duquette. However, that wasn't the last we saw of her — after Burke left \"Grey's Anatomy,\" Erica was brought in as a new cardio surgeon, and helped Callie realize that she was bisexual.\n\nUnfortunately, after finding out that Izzie, the doctor who committed a crime in order to steal Erica's heart donor, was still working at Seattle Grace, she walked into the hospital parking lot and was never seen again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCormac Hayes: 36 episodes (season 16-18)\n\nHayes, nicknamed \"McWidow,\" was introduced in season 16 as a \"gift\" from Cristina to Meredith all the way from Switzerland. The pediatric surgeon knows what it's like to mourn your spouse and be a single parent while juggling surgery — in other words, this Irish sweetie may be the perfect next love interest for Meredith.\n\nDuring season 17, Hayes asked Meredith on a date, only for her to collapse from COVID complications and spend much of the season in a coma/on a ventilator.\n\nAlas, it wasn't meant to be, as Flood departed \"Grey's\" in the 10th episode of season 18 amidst concerns about Owen Hunt's medical ethics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWinston Ndugu: 44 episodes (season 16-present)\n\nWinston was only in a single episode at the end of season 16 before it was announced Hill had been promoted to series regular for 17.\n\nNow, he's married to Meredith's half-sister Maggie and fully emerged in the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital drama. As the two are currently experiencing a bit of a rough patch, we'll see what happens in their future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeah Murphy: 46 episodes (season 9-10, 12)\n\nMurphy was part of the new class of interns in season nine, but she only lasted one more season before she was fired by Richard for being a good doctor, but not a good surgeon. Her main storyline? She was hooking up with Arizona while she and Callie were on a break and filed a sexual harassment claim against Callie for compromising her education, leading to a temporary \"non-fraternization policy\" between the doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n\nShe briefly returned in season 12 and was rehired after she trained and worked hard at another surgical program, but we haven't seen her since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShane Ross: 46 episodes (season 9-10)\n\nRoss was another intern added in season nine. He was involved with Cristina, both romantically and professionally. At the end of season 10, she invited him to come and work in Switzerland with her, and he agreed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNathan Riggs: 48 episodes (season 12-14)\n\nRiggs was brought in during season 12, clearly as a replacement for Derek, but also a cardio replacement for Cristina. He was also the ex-best friend and brother-in-law of Owen, but he was under the impression that his wife, Megan Hunt, had been killed in action in the Middle East.\n\nThis turned out to be untrue, and Riggs and Megan rode off into the sunset together at the end of season 14 ... until Megan came back in season 18 and revealed they'd broken up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreston Burke: 62 episodes (season 1-3, 10)\n\nOh, Burke. The show's first cardio god, and first extremely traumatic exit. For three seasons, fans watched Burke and Cristina fall in love (it wasn't always a smooth journey) and were prepared for the two to get married in the season three finale. Instead, Burke realized he was trying to force Cristina to be something she wasn't, and he left her at the altar.\n\nHe reappeared seven years later in Switzerland to give Cristina his chief job, as he wanted to retire and spend more time with his wife and kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas Koracick: 63 episodes (season 14-17, 18, 19)\n\nKoracick was one of the more delightful new additions to the cast back in season 14, but we feel like he was never properly used. He was in a dragged-out relationship with Teddy, only for her to finally dump him and return to Owen.\n\nIt was announced during season 17 that he'd be leaving the show towards the end of the season. His exit played out in a heartbreaking way: After catching COVID-19 and realizing that all of his POC hospital roommates had died, he asked Jackson to hire him at the Fox Foundation to help address racial inequality in medicine. He then moved to Boston to start his new role.\n\nHowever, in the season 17 finale, Jo revealed she had sold her shares of the hospital to Koracick, making him a board member. He's since appeared in episodes of both season 18 and 19 as Catherine's doctor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAddison Montgomery: 64 episodes (season 1-3, guest appearances in season 4-19)\n\nIntroduced in an iconic cameo appearance in the season one finale, Addison began as a villain, and ended as one of our favorite characters of all time. As any \"Grey's\" fan knows, Addison and Derek were married and lived in New York City before Derek caught Addison cheating with his best friend Mark. Then, he packed up and moved to Seattle, thus setting the events of \"Grey's Anatomy\" in motion.\n\nAddison, an accomplished neonatal surgeon, moved to Seattle to try and win Derek back, but eventually conceded that Meredith and Derek were meant to be. She stuck around for a bit before moving to Los Angeles and starring in her very own six-season spin-off, \"Private Practice.\"\n\nShe hadn't been seen on \"Grey's\" since season eight — but that changed, as Walsh returned to Seattle during season 18 for the first time in 10 years. Now, she's secured a recurring role in season 19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtticus \"Link\" Lincoln: 84 episodes (season 15-present)\n\nLink was introduced in season 15 as our new orthopedic surgeon and a close friend of Jo's. At first, there didn't seem to be much to Link, but as we learned about his life, his childhood cancer, and his complicated relationship with his parents, we realized he's actually the best.\n\nSeason 19's been heading towards an eventual relationship between Link and his bestie Jo, but it remains to be seen if they can work it out after Link's heart was broken by Amelia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLevi Schmitt: 102 episodes (season 14-present)\n\nSchmitt is part of the fourth class of interns on the show, and originally started out as a dweeb nicknamed \"Glasses\" living in his mom's basement. But now, he's finding his confidence, started wearing contacts, and came out to family. He has the distinction of being \"Grey's'\" first gay male series regular.\n\nAs for season 19, Schmitt is currently the only senior resident and he's feeling the strain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge O'Malley: 103 episodes (season 1-5, 17)\n\nGeorge \"007\" O'Malley was the first of the original five interns to leave the show, and what an exit it was. After going from the guy who almost killed someone on his first day and failing his intern exam to becoming one of the most compassionate and talented surgeons in his class, George enlisted in the US Army and was on his way to tell his mom the news when he pushed a woman out of the way of an oncoming bus and was dragged for blocks.\n\nHe was brought in as a \"John Doe,\" but Meredith was able to identify him via his \"007\" nickname. Tragically, he died in the season five finale.\n\nDuring season 17, George returned as one of the special guests on Meredith's beach — the place her mind has been while she's unconscious and intubated due to COVID. George revealed he still checks in on his friends and his mom ... cue the tears of all \"Grey's\" fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLexie Grey: 114 episodes (season 3-8, 17)\n\nLexie, or Little Grey, as some called her, was Meredith's younger half-sister with a photographic memory. She was introduced in the second class of interns, and over the course of six seasons, she became a strong, confident surgeon and had a very tumultuous relationship with Mark. She also became very close with Meredith.\n\nSadly, she died in the season eight finale in the infamous plane crash and had one of the most heartbreaking final scenes with Mark in the history of the show.\n\nLexie returned in season 17 for an appearance on Meredith's death beach, telling Meredith that the amount of grief she's endured was only because of how much she loves the people in her life. It was lovely to see the original Grey sisters reunited once again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephanie Edwards: 117 episodes (season 9-13)\n\nIt seemed that Edwards and Jo were introduced as part of the third new class of interns to be the next Meredith and Cristina. And while they gave it their best shot, no one compares to the original.\n\nEdwards had three big plotlines during her five seasons on the show: She was dating Jackson when he decided to interrupt April's wedding, she dated a patient played by Wilmer Valderrama who died and it shook her very hard, and she decided to leave the hospital after experiencing a very harrowing fire and saving a kid from dying.\n\nWe can't help but feel Jerrika Hinton was underused during her tenure on the show. Come back, Edwards!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIzzie Stevens: 120 episodes (season 1-6)\n\nThere is much to be said about Izzie, who fell in love with a patient and cut his LVAD wire in order to steal a heart, only for said patient to die almost immediately after due to a stroke. She also had sex with a ghost of that patient — it was a symptom of a brain tumor — and was then fired due to being slow on the job after beating cancer.\n\nWhen Izzie left in season six, she left behind her job, friends, and husband, Alex. However, her ghost looms large over the show. The idea of her played a major role in season 16: Alex found out that Izzie used his sperm to have twins, which led to Alex leaving Seattle and moving in with her, so they could be a family (off-screen).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew DeLuca: 136 episodes (season 11-17)\n\nOn DeLuca's first day at the hospital, he pretended he was a surgeon, rather than the lowly intern he actually was. That set up his character for the rest of the series — he always thought he knew best.\n\nHe's also been through the ringer. He almost got beaten to death by Alex over a misunderstanding, his girlfriend Sam was at risk of getting deported and had to move to Switzerland, he almost lost his hands to frostbite, and was eventually stabbed and killed during season 17 by a human trafficker.\n\nDeLuca is also the first person Meredith said she loved after Derek's death, and once she woke up from her COVID coma, she was forced to mourn him too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Sloan: 139 episodes (season 2-9, 17)\n\nFans heard about Mark before we saw him, but we were all wondering: How could he possibly have been better than Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd and led Addison to cheat?\n\nThe answer: Mark Sloan, aka McSteamy, was hilarious, sexy, charming, and definitely had that bad-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold thing going for him. He started off as a womanizing, shallow plastic surgeon who had no interest in teaching interns, but he ended his life (he died due to complications from the plane crash) as a dedicated father, soulmate to Lexie, and had one of the most endearing mentor/mentee relationships with Jackson, aka \"The Plastics Posse.\"\n\nDerek even forgave him for sleeping with his wife, and they resumed their friendship.\n\nMcSteamy returned in season 17 alongside Lexie on the death beach, and discussed with Meredith how he checks in on the lives of Callie, Arizona, and their daughter Sofia. Plus, fans of \"Slexie\" were finally given closure that the two were together in the afterlife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Warren: 147 episodes (season 6-present)\n\nWarren has had more jobs than anyone: He started in season six as an anesthesiologist, then became a surgical intern and resident, and then decided that actually he wanted to be a firefighter, which he now is on \"Grey's\" spin-off \"Station 19.\"\n\nBut through all that change, one thing has been constant: how much he loves his wife, Miranda Bailey. They have one of the most steady relationships on the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeddy Altman: 156 episodes (season 6-8, 14-present)\n\nAt first, Teddy was brought in as yet another cardio replacement and one of Owen's best friends and fellow veteran (whom she clearly was in love with). Over her first tenure on the show, fans saw her get over Owen and fall in love with her husband, Henry — yes, they were married and then fell in love — but he died on the operating table. She then left to take a chief job in Europe.\n\nTeddy returned for a brief appearance in season 14. She was once again a main character from season 15 through the present.\n\nCurrently, she's married to Owen after the two repaired their relationship and dealt with her unresolved trauma, but as any \"Grey's\" fan knows, they can't be happy for long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaggie Pierce: 186 episodes (season 10-present)\n\nFans were a bit fatigued when they found out that Meredith had yet another half-sister, but Maggie, the latest cardio surgeon to grace the halls of Grey Sloan Memorial, has edged her way into our hearts.\n\nIf we ignore how annoying she was about Meredith and Riggs, and her weird relationship with her step-brother Jackson, we can focus on how sweet she is with her birth father Richard, and what a good sister she's been to both Meredith and Amelia. And now, she's married! Congrats, Maggie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmelia Shepherd: 192 episodes (season 7-present)\n\nSpeaking of sisters, Amelia was first introduced on \"Private Practice\" as one of Derek's four sisters, a fellow neurosurgeon who was addicted to painkillers.\n\nThroughout her time on \"Grey's,\" Amelia has married and divorced Owen, been diagnosed with a giant tumor, given birth to a son with Link and later rejected his proposal, and has grown into the strong woman Derek knew she could be.\n\nThe pandemic was difficult for her, but she showed her strength by never relapsing and instead attending AA meetings and talking through her feelings.\n\nShe now has a new love interest, Dr. Kai Bartley, who is played by E.R. Fightmaster, the first nonbinary actor on \"Grey's.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril Kepner: 204 episodes (season 6-14, 17, 18)\n\nApril was part of the new class of residents that joined the show in season six after Seattle Grace merged with another hospital, Mercy West. For a long time, all we knew about her was that she had a giant crush on Derek and that she was a virgin.\n\nBut over time, she grew into a formidable trauma surgeon, and she fell in love with and got married to Jackson. When they tragically lost their baby due to a genetic disorder, April enlisted in the Army, which led to the dissolution of their marriage, though they'd go on to have a daughter together, Harriet.\n\nApril left the show in season 14 when she reconnected with Matthew, the paramedic she left at the altar. After he lost his wife and she went through a near-death experience, they got married and she left the hospital to focus on charity work.\n\nHowever, we checked in on April during season 17 to find out she and Matthew had split up, and she supported Jackson's move to Boston. When the two returned in season 18 for another episode, fans were delighted to see that \"Japril\" had worked things out and gotten back together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCristina Yang: 220 episodes (season 1-10)\n\nThis loss still hurts. Cristina stood by Meredith's side for 10 seasons as her \"Twisted Sister,\" her person, and her best friend. But along the way, she also became the show's best character. She became a more empathetic doctor, was easily the best surgeon of the original class, and never compromised on her ideals — namely, that she didn't want to have children.\n\nLittle girls everywhere saw a hero in Cristina Yang, and she went out on top: After realizing that she could never win a Harper Avery, surgery's most prestigious award, at Grey Sloan Memorial, she accepted an offer from her ex-fiancé (who left her at the altar) to take over an entire state-of-the-art hospital in Switzerland.\n\nThough she hasn't been seen since, Meredith still frequently mentions her, texts her, and calls her, keeping the Twisted Sister spirit alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArizona Robbins: 224 episodes (season 5-14)\n\nWhen Arizona was introduced in season five as a potential love interest for Callie, she was also shown using her Heelies to skate around the hospital — she was the sunniest pediatric surgeon the halls of Seattle Grace had ever seen.\n\nThough she and Callie went through their ups and downs (Arizona moving to Africa, Callie having a baby with Mark, Arizona getting her leg amputated due to the plane crash and then cheating on Callie to deal with it, having an extremely painful divorce and child custody hearing), there is still hope for the two of them, as Arizona was last seen moving to New York City (where Callie lives) and exchanging flirty texts with her ex-wife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJo Wilson: 231 episodes (season 9-present)\n\nJo was introduced in season nine as part of the class of interns, but she quickly became the only one we cared about as we learned about her experiences with homelessness, how she was abandoned at a fire station by her birth mom, and her abusive ex-husband Paul. Gradually, she and Alex fell in love and got married — only for Alex to leave her in season 16 due to his twins with Izzie.\n\nDuring season 17, Jo decided to leave surgery behind for OB-GYN because she \"needs joy\" in her life. She also had a friends-with-benefits situation with Jackson before he left, which led to him letting her move into his apartment with her newly adopted daughter Luna after he moved to Boston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCallie Torres: 241 episodes (season 2-12)\n\nCallie Torres (formerly Callie O'Malley), was the first new main character to be introduced on the show when she popped up in season two as an ortho resident with a crush on George.\n\nAlthough that relationship was clearly not going to work, Callie remained on the show for 11 seasons, developing close friendships with everyone at the hospital and discovering that she was bisexual, before she moved to New York City with Penny in season 12. They've since broken up.\n\nBring back Callie and Arizona, please, \"Grey's\" gods. We need to see them back together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerek Shepherd: 247 episodes (season 1-11, 17)\n\nIt's almost impossible to comprehend that it's been half a decade since Derek saved an entire family from a car crash only to get rammed into by a truck. While he knows exactly what needs to be done to save him, other doctors do not, and he dies.\n\nDerek was Meredith's other half for the entire show up to that point, her soulmate, and one of the two central love stories of the show (the other being Meredith and Cristina). Through it all, he was there by her side.\n\nAnd while we thought we'd never see McDreamy again, he popped up at the end of the season 17 premiere, giving every \"Grey's\" fan a heart attack. He's since been in three more episodes on Meredith's death beach, trying to counsel Meredith on her next steps and eventually telling her to wake up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson Avery: 274 episodes (season 6-17, 18, 19)\n\nJackson and April were the only two doctors left from the Mercy West merger (the rest of their class was killed in the hospital shooting) — and now, they're both gone too.\n\nJackson, a plastic surgeon, was a bit adrift after his ex-wife, April, left the show. He was dating his step-sister Maggie for awhile, then moved on to Vic from \"Station 19,\" and most recently hooked up with Jo post-Karev divorce.\n\nAfter reconnecting with his dad and figuring out what kind of person he wanted to be, he left Seattle to move to Boston and become the head of the Fox foundation and address racism in medicine. He brought along Koracick and April, too.\n\nJackson has since appeared in one episode of season 18 and 19 each, to reveal he had gotten back together with April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOwen Hunt: 327 episodes (season 5-present)\n\nHas there been a more polarizing long-running character than our very first trauma surgeon Owen Hunt? When Owen first arrived, he was a cool Army doctor who pulled an icicle out of Cristina. But when he returned, he was a haunted man struggling with PTSD.\n\nAlthough he got through it, his relationship with Cristina turned toxic, as he accused her of killing their baby when she got an abortion (she had always been very clear she didn't want kids), and then he cheated on her to get back at him.\n\nThen he threw himself into a relationship with Amelia (which also didn't work), and then got engaged to Teddy, although she cheated on him, so they also broke up. However, season 18 began with the two of them finally getting married, though they're already having huge issues in season 19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex Karev: 358 episodes (season 1-16)\n\nAlex started off as the show's token villain. But over the course of 16 seasons, fans watched him become one of, if not the best man on the show. He built one of the sweetest and most solid friendships on the show with Meredith (and another with Arizona) and finally got his happy ending with Jo.\n\nUnfortunately, when Justin Chambers announced he was leaving \"Grey\"s after 16 seasons, making Meredith the only original intern left, fans were broken-hearted — and not everyone could believe he was getting back together with Izzie, who left him with just a note.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeredith Grey: 407 episodes (seasons 1-19)\n\nOf course, the woman who started it all, the titular Grey of \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nMeredith has gone through more than anyone should have to: Her mother and father are dead, her sister Lexie is dead, her husband Derek is dead, her ex-boyfriend Andrew is dead, her close friends George and Mark are dead, her best friends (Callie, Alex, Izzie, Jackson, and most importantly Cristina) have left, she's been attacked by a patient, she's almost lost her medical license, and she was intubated due to a particularly nasty case of COVID.\n\nIt took 407 episodes, but we're finally saying goodbye to Meredith as a series regular. Her last episode (for now) aired on February 23, with Meredith and her family moving to Boston so her daughter Zola could go to a school for gifted kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranda Bailey: 407 episodes (season 1-present)\n\nThe pilot of \"Grey's Anatomy\" begins with our five interns, Meredith, Cristina, Alex, George, and Izzie, learning that their resident (their boss) is someone called \"The Nazi.\"\n\nUnfortunate nicknames aside, Miranda Bailey has been with viewers throughout every season as the wise, compassionate, and extremely skilled boss of all of our favorite characters. We'd all be lucky to have a Bailey in our lives.\n\nNow, she's one of the last two actors to remain on the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichard Webber: 407 episodes (season 1-present)\n\nWebber was the first chief of surgery on \"Grey's,\" a title that has changed hands relatively frequently (Burke, Derek, Owen, Alex, and Bailey have all been chief at one point), but it has always fit the best on Webber. We've watched him deal with his alcoholism, the death of his wife, a new relationship with Catherine, and become a father figure to Meredith, Maggie, and Jackson.\n\nNow, he's back as the \"Chief of Chiefs\" after Catherine demoted Koracick.\n\nEven though one of the first-ever plots for Webber was him retiring from the hospital, 19 years later he's still kicking as one of the two actors left from the pilot.\n\nWhen you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission.
