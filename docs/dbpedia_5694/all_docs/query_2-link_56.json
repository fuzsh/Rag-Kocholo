        "text": "On Feb. 28, the 15th episode of Grey's Anatomy's 15th season will officially make it the longest running primetime medical drama in television history. As we build up to this monumental TV moment, we've asked five writers, all of them Grey's groupies since the first season, in 2005, to tell Shondaland.com why the seminal drama series has meant so much to them over 330 (and counting!) episodes.\n\nIn 2005, it was a peak time for teen dramas. The O.C., Gilmore Girls, One Tree Hill, and Veronica Mars were all fighting for the attention of people like me: a high school student (among others) — but I was ready for something more. Enter the dramatic, highly stressful, emotionally complex, and sometimes insane lives of the characters on Grey's Anatomy, who made being dateless for the homecoming dance seem like a minor annoyance compared to trying to remove a 70-pound tumor, or a repairing a guy who was mauled by a pet lion.\n\nTeen soap operas were my training wheels to riding the motorcycle that was Grey's. The messy relationships between characters were intriguing, and the wacky medical cases kept things interesting. But it was something deeper that connected me with the show then, and still does now, 15 seasons later: the inclusivity.\n\nOut of nine main cast members in season one, four of them were people of color. It was important to see such a diverse cast, but it never felt like Grey's Anatomy was filling quotas or making after school specials out of \"teaching moments.\" When Cristina rose in the ranks early, it wasn't chalked up to her being a smart Asian doctor. Miranda and Richard's professional relationship didn’t rely on them being able to relate to each other simply because they were both black. And when Cristina and Burke ended up together, the fact that it was an interracial relationship wasn't the focus of their issues — it was that hey, maybe they weren't temperamentally right for each other, and, you know, perhaps the power dynamic between them was a little off.\n\nRace and sexual orientation aren't constantly being parsed for drama at Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\nGrey's also marked the first time that I saw someone who looked like me in a leading role on television. I'm a Korean-American woman who was adopted from Seoul at 7 months old by two loving, Caucasian parents. I grew up in a small town in upstate New York where I was the only Asian person in my high school graduating class of 184 students, and very few TV shows that I watched had Asian characters who weren't the token nerds, let alone leading ladies. There is a stereotype that Asian people are smart and go on to become either doctors or lawyers. Cristina technically filled that stereotype, but she wasn't the soft-spoken good girl that I typically saw in pop culture. She was the strong-willed, confident, whip-smart, doesn't-take-any-shit-from-anyone person that I wanted to be. She broke rules, she took risks, and she didn't care what people thought of her — or who she had to take down to get where she wanted.\n\nOver time, Cristina's tough exterior softened, and more vulnerable moments emerged, whether it was comforting her best friend, Meredith, with the words of wisdom I need tattooed on my inner wrist after a bad Bumble date (\"He's not the sun. You are.\") or collapsing in a nervous breakdown (\"Somebody sedate me!\") when a patient's diagnosis triggered the trauma of her own recent miscarriage. She fought to take on some of the toughest cases, and also fought to keep a sense of herself within ultimately unsuccessful and all-consuming relationships (with both Burke and later Owen). And through that time, Cristina was never reduced to \"getting ahead\" just because she was Asian. Preston's mother didn't dislike her because she was Korean — any mother might clutch her pearls if she accidentally walked in on her her son's girlfriend stripping the first time they met. On Grey's I knew I wouldn't hear a racist slur thrown at Cristina, or witness her being put down because her eyes were more slanted than her colleagues'. I couldn't say the same about my real life, so it was a nice Xanadu to aspire to.\n\nOf course the show has had storylines that deal specifically with race, like when Miranda and Ben had to tell Tucker exactly what to do if he was ever stopped by a cop in order to protect his life. But most of the time, race and sexual orientation aren't constantly being parsed for drama at Grey Sloan Memorial. Arizona and Callie weren't treated any differently than Meredith and Derek for having an inter-office romance. There was the chance that it would end badly and make work awkward (and it did, unfortunately), but they weren't called out specifically because they were two women. This season, Levi and Nico are an interracial gay couple who start sneaking around at first, but by the time they enter a full-blown relationship, no one is freaking out because they have different backgrounds — Karev would just prefer they hook up in an on-call room instead of, ya know, a supply closet.\n\nPeople work hard and get knocked down often — and then get back up — no matter who they are.\n\nThis inclusivity isn't just about romantic, behind-the-scenes action — it's professional, too. Maggie is lauded as one of the greatest young surgeons at the hospital rather than the best young black surgeon. Her race isn't what's remarkable — it's her talent. The same goes for Cristina, who went on to leave Grey Sloan (still not over it…) for a prestigious position leading research in Zurich — not because she's the most talented Asian surgeon, but because she's the best fit for the job. Although the hardships people face because of their race or sexual orientation is important, it is refreshing to see that hard work doesn't have to be cast against someone being \"different.\" When Cristina faced and overcame adversities, it had more to do with the intense demands of a career in cardio (and her own ambition) as a woman. Her successes spoke for themselves as she excelled, and the same went for Maggie, Callie, and even Jackson (other than the nepotism stuff). Non-white people aren't often seen that way in pop culture — our personal issues often have to come with a side of race. Grey's doesn't do that. People work hard and get knocked down often — and then get back up — no matter who they are.\n\nLooking at the cast now, in season 15, nine main characters are people of color, and zero storylines that I can recall so far have centered on race per se. I may not have Cristina to relate to because she looks like me, but I have Maggie to remind me how lucky I am to have wonderful adoptive parents (and that I should be thankful my mom is still with me); Bailey to help me remember to take care of my mental health; and Meredith to inspire me to have love triangles well into my 40s. As far as I'm concerned, that's the most fun way to be inclusive."
