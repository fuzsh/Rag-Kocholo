Aside from both being \"medical\" programs I think ER was more about the real ethical problems facing those charged with medical care. Grey's is more about romance/relationships than about real life in the emergency medical care business.\n\nFor what it's worth, my bother-in-law, a doc in charge of an ER in a major metropolitan hospital, says ER was more realistic and relevant than Grey's. I agree. Mind you, we are talking about the first few shows of both shows.\n\nThat said, Berny's absolutely right. ER's long ceased being the must see TV it used to be more than ten years ago.\n\nGold Member\n\nUsername: Chaunb3400\n\nHuntsville , Alabama U.S.\n\nPost Number: 7323\n\nRegistered: Jul-05\n\nPosted on\n\nnever watched either.....really\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Yodapez\n\nPost Number: 2\n\nRegistered: Jun-06\n\nPosted on\n\nER until Dr. Green died.\n\nGold Member\n\nUsername: Dustin3\n\nTigard , Or U.S.\n\nPost Number: 1816\n\nRegistered: Oct-05\n\nPosted on\n\nI think it was meant to say, \"which is more entertaining, ER or Grey's\"\n\nThe question does not ask, \"which is more realistic\" JOHN!, lol\n\nSilver Member\n\nUsername: John_s\n\nColumbus , Ohio US\n\nPost Number: 990\n\nRegistered: Feb-04\n\nPosted on\n\nThe original question was:\n\nThread: Poll: ER vs. Grey's Anatomy\n\nI have my opinion for various reasons, but curious of what others say...which do you prefer, and why?\n\nER makes Grey's look like a sophomoric Disney after school special.

The problem I have here is that people are comparing a series at its peak (Grey's) with the current shows of a series that, I agree, has gone on too long.\n\nAs I said before, ER's long ceased being the must see TV it used to be more than ten years ago. But there was a time when it was, unlike Grey's, more than a night time soap opera set in an emergency room.\n\nI do have a thing for Sandra Oh.\n\nGold Member\n\nUsername: Dustin3\n\nTigard , Or U.S.\n\nPost Number: 1915\n\nRegistered: Oct-05\n\nPosted on\n\nha.\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: Leafs_fan_4_eva\n\nToronto , Ontario Canada\n\nPost Number: 90\n\nRegistered: Jun-06\n\nPosted on\n\nyeah... i dont no who watches E.R. its so dry... they should just cancell the show.\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: Leafs_fan_4_eva\n\nToronto , Ontario Canada\n\nPost Number: 91\n\nRegistered: Jun-06\n\nPosted on\n\nis anyone in this thread???????\n\nGold Member\n\nUsername: Dustin3\n\nTigard , Or U.S.\n\nPost Number: 1928\n\nRegistered: Oct-05\n\nPosted on\n\nevery once in a while\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: Ftalife\n\nPost Number: 75\n\nRegistered: Jul-06\n\nPosted on\n\ni love grey's anatomy\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: Ftalife\n\nPost Number: 76\n\nRegistered: Jul-06\n\nPosted on\n\ni love the story lines\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: Ftalife\n\nPost Number: 77\n\nRegistered: Jul-06\n\nPosted on\n\ni keep watching the show just to see who is hooking up. i like how the story is very much about the personal lives of the doctors\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Reservoirdog\n\nPost Number: 4\n\nRegistered: Aug-06\n\nPosted on\n\nGrey's Anatomy now...ER in its heyday\n\nSilver Member\n\nUsername: Ftalife\n\nPost Number: 186\n\nRegistered: Jul-06\n\nPosted on\n\nyep!! i agree\n\nGold Member\n\nUsername: James1115\n\nCt\n\nPost Number: 7033\n\nRegistered: Dec-04\n\nPosted on\n\nI still watch ER every week, it is not as good as it was 10 years ago but you know what it is still pretty good. I watch grey's also, they are two different shows as John said. Grey's is ER minus the seriousness. Both are good show's.\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Whirlygirl\n\nKitchener , Ontario Canada\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Feb-07\n\nPosted on\n\nAs a person who was avidly an ER fan ~ I've jumped camps! ER just can't stack up to the plot and innovative freshness of Grey's. You gotta love virtually all of the Grey's characters. I can't think of a single one that I am not fascinated and in love with! ER's plots are presented in stale fashion with more compact, less larger-than-life characters. The one thing ER excels at is plot development. They frequently leave you gasping for more even if the close-ups and scene ends are not as pretty or compelling. With the possible exception of Grey's Feb. 15th episode. I do enjoy them both but I believe the question is which do you prefer, I prefer Grey's and would watch a medical show every night of the week if it were available.\n\nGold Member\n\nUsername: James1115\n\nUse a simple...\n\nPost Number: 9260\n\nRegistered: Dec-04\n\nPosted on\n\ngood call\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Jsalexandra\n\nPost Number: 8\n\nRegistered: Nov-09\n\nPosted on\n\nFor me its ER all the way.Its definitely better.\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: Hamon\n\nPost Number: 52\n\nRegistered: Oct-09\n\nPosted on\n\nI will prefer Simpsons Episodes.

I think ER is way better because is more realistic, while in grey's anatomy there is too much drama, and I can tell you I found myself bored as hell after watching the first 2 seasons. In my opinion even dr. House is better then grey's."
