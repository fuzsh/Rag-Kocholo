        "text": "Ellen Pompeo will be in more episodes of Grey’s Anatomy’s upcoming 20th season than expected.\n\nSources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the actress behind the beloved character of Dr. Meredith Grey will appear in at least four episodes of the strikes-shortened season, with the possibility for more. Reps for ABC declined to comment.\n\nAs previously announced, Pompeo was not expected to have much — if any — of an onscreen role in the Shonda Rhimes-produced drama’s landmark 20th season. Pompeo was reduced from series regular to recurring after signing on to produce and star in a limited series for Hulu. That show, which remains untitled, is currently in pre-production.\n\nIn season 19, Pompeo appeared in less than 10 of the 20 episodes and was written out in the finale after moving to Boston. The actress, who has starred as the Grey in Grey’s Anatomy since 2005, is expected to continue to do her trademark voiceover for the show. Pompeo’s appearance in a teaser trailer for season 20 also generated headlines as sources say she has a big storyline that is set up in the upcoming premiere.\n\nAs for other season 20 tidbits, Jessica Capshaw will reprise her role as Arizona in what sources say will be just one episode."
