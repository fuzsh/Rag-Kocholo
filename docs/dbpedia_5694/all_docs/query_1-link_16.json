        "text": "“Grey’s Anatomy” is a long-running medical drama television series following the lives of doctors and residents at a hospital in Seattle. Premiering in 2005 on ABC, the show has run for 19 seasons and was created by Shonda Rhimes, who also served as its showrunner, executive producer and head writer until 2015. The series mostly revolves around Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), as she grows from an intern to the chief of general surgery and navigates love and friendship in the process. “Grey’s Anatomy” started out with nine principal cast members: Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, T. R. Knight, Chandra Wilson, James Pickens Jr., Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey. The show’s success has catapulted many of its stars into the mainstream, including Pompeo, Oh and Dempsey, as well as Rhimes, who has gone on to have a lucrative career as a producer and screenwriter of shows like “Scandal” and “Bridgerton.” Starting in its 19th season, Pompeo has shifted to a more reduced role, with the show becoming increasingly ensemble-focused. “Grey’s Anatomy” has birthed two spinoff shows, “Private Practice” and “Station 19,” and has become the longest-running scripted primetime show airing on ABC. Throughout its run, the series has been well-received by critics and fans alike, though ratings have dropped in more recent years. It has taken home the Golden Globe for best television series – drama and garnered 38 Emmy nominations, winning a total of four. On March 24, it was announced that “Grey’s Anatomy” had been renewed for a 20th season, with Meg Marinis serving as showrunner."
