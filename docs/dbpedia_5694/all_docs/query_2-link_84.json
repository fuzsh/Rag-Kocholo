        "text": "Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey)\n\nIn 2020, Forbes named Pompeo, who played Meredith Grey since season 1, as the 10th highest-paid actress in television after she earned $22 million in 2019. In 2017, after her costar Patrick Dempsey left Grey’s Anatomy, Pompeo signed a new deal that paid her $575,000 per episode or around $20 million per season, according to The Hollywood Reporter. She also received a seven-figure signing bonus and two backend equity points, which made her $6 to $7 million richer. It’s unclear what Pompeo’s salary was before, but in 2007, Reuters reported that she made $200,000 per episode. Celebrity Net Worth reports that her net worth is $80 million.\n\nPompeo explained in a 2017 essay for THR that she asked creator Shonda Rhimes for more money when it the show runner left ABC for Netflix, which Rhimes agreed to. “What happened is that I went to Shonda [Rhimes] and I said, ‘If you’re moving on to Netflix and you want the show to go down, I’m cool with that,’” Pompeo wrote. “‘But if you want it to continue, I need to be incentivized. I need to feel empowered and to feel ownership of this show.’ And she was like, ‘I absolutely want to keep the show going. It’s the mothership, so let’s find a way to make you happy. What do you want?’”\n\nPatrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd)\n\nSalary: $400,000 per episode\n\nNet worth: $80 million\n\nDempsey, who played Derek Shepherd until he left Grey’s Anatomy in season 11, made $400,000 per episode at the time of his exit in 2015. Five years later, the actor, who starred on Grey’s since season 1, surprised fans with a return to the series during the season 17 premiere in November 2020 (and it’s likely that his cameo earned him a similarly hefty paycheck!) THR reported that Dempsey’s original exit from the series allowed Grey’s Anatomy to save $9.6 million per season. Celebrity Net Worth reports that his net worth is $80 million.\n\nIn her essay for THR in 2017, Pompeo explained that she and Dempsey made the same amount before her raise, but she believed she should make more because the show is titled after her character.\n\n“For me, Patrick [Dempsey] leaving the show [in 2015] was a defining moment, deal-wise,” Pompeo wrote. “They could always use him as leverage against me—’We don’t need you; we have Patrick’—which they did for years. I don’t know if they also did that to him, because he and I never discussed our deals. There were many times where I reached out about joining together to negotiate, but he was never interested in that. At one point, I asked for $5,000 more than him just on principle, because the show is Grey’s Anatomy and I’m Meredith Grey. They wouldn’t give it to me. And I could have walked away, so why didn’t I? It’s my show; I’m the number one. I’m sure I felt what a lot of these other actresses feel: Why should I walk away from a great part because of a guy? You feel conflicted but then you figure, “I’m not going to let a guy drive me out of my own house.”\n\nSandra Oh (Cristina Yang)\n\nSalary: $350,000 per episode\n\nNet worth: $25 million\n\nOh, who played Cristina Yang, left Grey’s Anatomy in season 10. She starred on the series since season 1. It’s unclear what she made at the time, but in 2012, around the time of season 9, TV Guide, reported that Oh made $350,000 per episode, which was the same amount that Dempsey and Pompeo made at the time. According to Celebrity Net Worth, she’s worth $25 million. In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2018, Oh reacted to Pompeo’s massive raise on Grey’s Anatomy. “I totally understand and remember that struggle for her,” she said. “It’s really good that she feels full circle about that. That she feels righted now.”\n\nWhen asked about her own salary negotiations, Oh hinted that her experience was different than Pompeo’s. “I don’t see it the same way, in my experience…it’s complicated,” she said. “It’s too complicated, you know what I mean?”\n\nKim Raver (Teddy Altman)\n\nSalary: TBD\n\nNet worth: $5 million\n\nRaver has had an on and off journey on Grey’s Anatomy. Raver, who plays Teddy Altman, served as a main cast member from seasons 6 to 8. She left the series and returned in season 13 in a recurring role before she was promoted in season 14 back to a main cast member. It’s unclear what her salary is, but Deadline reported in 2020 that she was among the supporting cast members to receive “significant pay bumps” from new deals. According to Celeb Worth, she’s worth $5 million.\n\nGrey’s Anatomy airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on ABC. Stream the next day on Hulu.\n\nHow to Save a Life: The Inside Story of Grey’s Anatomy\n\nFor more about Grey’s Anatomy, read Lynette Rice’s behind-the-scenes book, How to Save a Life: The Inside Story of Grey’s Anatomy. In the New York Times Bestseller, Rice investigates the past decade and a half of Grey’s Anatomy and reveals the never-before-told stories behind the controversial exits (and firings) of cast members like Isaiah Washington, Katherine Heigl and Patrick Dempsey, who left the show after accusations he “terrorized the set.” How to Save a Life is a must-read for any Grey’s Anatomy fan.\n\nOur mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
