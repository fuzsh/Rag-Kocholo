Moments before the explosive detonated, Meredith was tasked with taking it out of a patient's body. This incident would haunt Meredith for seasons to come.\n\nRELATED: The Best Grey's Anatomy Quotes of All Time, Just Because\n\nSadly, he died tragically at the end of season 2 when he had a stroke following his heart transplant. Denny had been a patient at the hospital for a long time because of his ongoing heart problems. But after developing a relationship with Izzie Stevens, his death became even more excruciating for fans to handle.\n\nRELATED: Some 'Grey’s Anatomy' Fans Aren't Happy About the Fate of the Show\n\nMeredith's mom, a world-famous surgeon, also suffered from Alzheimer's. After her condition worsened, Ellis was admitted to the hospital. After being given Lorazepam to calm her down, she was not able to be resuscitated and died.\n\nSusan, who was married to Meredith's father, was admitted Seattle Grace after suffering from chronic hiccuping and acid reflux. After being released, she came back to the hospital with a fever and had to be rushed into surgery because she was septic and had a toxic megacolon. Susan died shortly afterwards in surgery. Meredith's dad ultimately blamed her for Susan's death.\n\nGeorge died in the most heroic fashion: Jumping in front of a bus to save a young woman. The actor, T.R. Knight, reportedly decide to give up his scrubs after what he called a gradual \"breakdown of communication\" between himself and show creator Shonda Rhimes.\n\nRELATED: More Interesting Facts About Grey's Anatomy\n\nThe Mercy West transfer was murdered by Gary Clark, a grieving widower in one of the scariest episodes of Grey's ever. Charles nearly escaped Gary when he entered the room he was in. Unfortunately, a small noise from the bathroom caused Gary to check and promptly shoot Charles when he found out he was a surgeon. Gary was initially looking to kill Derek Shepherd.\n\nLike Charles, Gary murdered Reed after he asked her if she was a surgeon. Her body was discovered by April Kepner, who slipped in her blood.\n\nThe frequent patient died after a tumor near his heart caused bleeding in his lungs and trachea. While in surgery, Henry passed away due to complications. The sudden death hit everyone hard, especially Cristina.\n\nThe fatal plane crash of season 8 claimed Lexie's life after she was crushed by debris. Despite valiant efforts to save her, Lexie died just moments after Mark professed his love for her and promised that they were going to get married, have kids, and build a happy life together.\n\nJust like his love Lexie, Mark endured life-threatening injuries after the plane crash at the end of season 8. He was put on life support, but was taken off in the season 9 premiere, much to the dismay of McSteamy fans everywhere. To memorialize Mark and Lexie's lives, the hospital was renamed Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\nCristina particularly struggled with this one. She and Dr. Thomas had a very strong bond until he suffered a heart attack while operating on a patient.\n\nUltimately, a heart attack claimed Adele's life in season 9. Fans learned Adele had been suffering from Alzheimer's back in season 7 and her condition continued to deteriorate up until her death.\n\nOnce she discovered Dr. Webber had suffered from electrical shock, Heather began trying to help him. During that time, she stepped into a water puddle and was instantly electrocuted. While falling, she hit her head on a generator box.\n\nDerek miraculously survived a plane crash and shooting ... but, alas, a deadly car accident in season 11 resulted in his tragic demise. After helping out victims of a different car collision, McDreamy got into a terrible accident of his own when a truck smashed into him while he was in the middle of making a U-turn. Despite the effort of doctors to save him, he didn't make it off the surgery table.\n\nJo's estranged, abusive ex-husband was in the hospital after being the victim of a hit-and-run. When Jenny refused to help him get his stuff so he could leave the hospital, he tried to attack her. In doing so, he hit his head, which caused his brain to swell and eventually die."
