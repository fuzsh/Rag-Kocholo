        "text": "As we exclusively announced in December, the first 19 seasons of ABC’s venerable medical drama Grey’s Anatomy would be offered on a Disney streaming platform for the first time, and now all 420 episodes are available on Hulu ahead of the Season 20 premiere on ABC.\n\n“Grey’s Anatomy is one of our top performing next-day titles, and we are very excited to now be the only streaming destination to offer every Grey’s episode ever, both past and current,” said Hulu General Manager Lauren Tempest. “In addition to bringing lifelong fans back to Grey Sloan, we hope that new audiences will discover and fall in love with the characters and stories that have captivated us for so many years.”\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Hulu has released a new featurette with the most iconic moments from the past 19 seasons and teasing what’s ahead. You can watch it above.\n\nAs we reported, under the pact, Hulu and Netflix, the longtime SVOD home of Grey’s will share the co-exclusive domestic streaming rights to all prior 19 seasons of the drama series. All episodes will be available on both the bundled Disney app and the standalone Hulu service.\n\nSecuring Grey’s Anatomy for the foreseeable future is part of a short-term domestic content agreement between Disney Entertainment and Netflix in which Disney is licensing 14 popular library TV series to Netflix on a non-exclusive basis for 18 months. The list includes Lost, This Is Us, Prison Break, Archer, How I Met Your Mother, White Collar, Home Improvement, The Resident, ESPN 30 for 30, My Wife and Kids, Reba, The Bernie Mac Show and the recent Wonder Years reboot.\n\nSeason 20 of Grey’s Anatomy premieres Thursday, March 14 on ABC and begins streaming Friday, March 15, exclusively on Hulu."
