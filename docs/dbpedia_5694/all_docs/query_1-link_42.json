        "text": "After debuting in 2005, and premiering over 430 episodes, Grey’s Anatomy will finally air its landmark 20th season on Netflix.\n\nThe long-running ABC medical drama has garnered a cult following of loyal fans who are invested in the lives of doctors and interns at the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n\nFollowing the emotional season 19 finale, viewers will finally be able to catch up with the dramas in the absence of Meredith Grey (played by Ellen Pompeo).\n\nThe two-hour episode ended with a cliffhanger for almost every character to have a major storyline in the upcoming instalment.\n\nIncluding Teddy Altman’s (Kim Raver) fate after she shockingly collapsed hours after complaining about a toothache.\n\nDue to being busy at the hospital, she couldn’t get it checked out in time and in the final moments of the episode Mika Yasuda (Midori Francis) could be seen reviving Teddy.\n\nThe interns’ residency at the hospital is also under threat after a major rule break saw Lucas (Nico Terho) and Simone (Alexis Floyd) performing surgery without attending supervision.\n\nKwan (Harry Shum Jr) also broke major protocol when he decided to resuscitate Max (Juliet Mills) despite her do-not-resuscitate order.\n\nHowever, Netflix streamers will have to wait and see if this trio will join the list of characters who were fired from Grey Sloan.\n\nThe season 19 finale also came to a happy end for Dr Bailey (Chandra Wilson) after she won The Catherine Fox Award.\n\nShe became the first winner in history who hadn’t been nominated and was winning for a non-surgical achievement.\n\nIt was a welcomed surprise as she travelled to Boston with the nominees and under the guise that she was presenting an award.\n\nAlthough Grey said goodbye early in season 19, she made sporadic appearances throughout the show and will continue to do so in season 20."
