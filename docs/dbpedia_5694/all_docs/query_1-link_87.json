        "text": "by Carolyn Thomas ♥ @HeartSisters\n\nBefore my heart attack, much of what I knew about CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) was learned by watching TV medical dramas like Grey’s Anatomy. Researchers who study how television has impacted public opinion suggest that TV actors following their cardiac arrest scripts are heroically brought back to life by another TV actor pretending to perform CPR over 70 per cent of the time. (1) Pulse restored, smiles of relief all around, and the cheerful patient and family heading for home while waving in gratitude to the brilliant hospital life-savers.\n\nFor real-life heart patients, however, we know that most people whose hearts suddenly stop don’t survive. Only about one-quarter make it out of the hospital alive. Of those survivors, the American Heart Association reports that nearly one-third are seriously disabled.(2)\n\nCardiac arrest is NOT the same as a heart attack (although people like me who have survived a heart attack are at higher risk of cardiac arrest both during and after that heart attack than those without a cardiac history). My heart attack was like a plumbing problem (essentially, a blocked pipe preventing blood flow to the heart muscle) – but sudden cardiac arrest is an electrical problem (the heart’s electrical circuits can’t maintain a heartbeat). So during cardiac arrest, blood can’t flow to the organs of the body, including the brain, which is why so many people don’t recover after cardiac arrest.\n\nIn a 2021 study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine, researchers assessed what home viewers would learn about CPR as demonstrated by TV actors.(3) The researchers described what they’d learned after studying hundreds of episodes of medical dramas as “a missed opportunity for improving both performance and communication on CPR.”\n\nIn other words, not only were the CPR techniques used by TV actors during their cardiac arrest scenes significantly more likely to be demonstrated incorrectly, but the post-CPR outcomes were also portrayed inaccurately.\n\nNot surprisingly, when actor/doctors on the screen push down on the chests of actor/patients, for example, the compression strength is not nearly as forceful as real-life rib-cracking CPR needs to be to actually maintain life.\n\nThis study also found that patients (and their family members) who believe those inappropriately optimistic CPR prognoses (“70 per cent survival”) portrayed by television actors are more likely to expect aggressive medical care when facing their own medical crises, as researchers explained:(3)\n\n“The public has unrealistic views regarding the success of CPR, and one potential source of misinformation is medical dramas.\n\n“Prior research has shown that depictions of resuscitation on television are skewed towards younger patients with acute injuries, while most cardiac arrests occur in older patients as a result of medical co-morbidities. Additionally, the success rate of televised resuscitation on older shows has vastly exceeded good outcomes in the real world.\n\n“Medical dramas continue to focus on trauma as the main cause of cardiac arrest and portray favorable outcomes more frequently than should be expected.\n\n“Healthcare workers should anticipate the need to counter misinformation when discussing patient goals of care and end-of-life planning.”\n\nIn a compelling interview in Shots: Health News From NPR, we learn more about “the widespread misconception of what CPR can and cannot do. CPR can sometimes save lives, but it also has a dark side.”\n\nSome of you reading this might in fact have been one of those patients whose stopped hearts have been resuscitated by CPR. And if you’re able to read this, you’re one of the small minority who didn’t die or suffer permanent neurological, cognitive or psychological damage after the CPR that successfully restarted your pulse. You probably never saw any “dark side” to CPR.\n\nSadly, as researchers noted here and elsewhere continue to remind us, many are not so lucky.\n\nYet these researchers still ask the important question: while it’s possible to endure a ‘successful’ resuscitation that restarts the heart and thus saves a life – what kind of life will that be? Factors like the patient’s age (younger is better) or how long the patient’s heart was stopped before CPR began (sooner is better) or general physical condition (healthy is better) or where the CPR took place (in-hospital is better than out-of-hospital ‘bystander CPR’) or who was performing the CPR (skill and experience are better) – all of these things help to determine a fairly accurate post-CPR prognosis, according to what’s called the Cerebral Performance Scale – or CPC.(2)\n\nThis scale ranks five categories of neurological deficit that can result from sudden cardiac arrest, all the way from Category 1 (“full consciousness/return to normal life”) to Category 3’s serious brain injury (“limited cognition/significant neurological deficits”) or Category 5 (“brain death, never regains consciousness”).\n\nThe general public tends to incorrectly believe (from television, movies or high-profile professional athletes who are famously resuscitated during cardiac arrest) that the CPR drama they’ve watched on TV is always a miracle cure for a stopped heart. This could be true for some – but sadly, only for a small minority and only under ideal circumstances.\n\nBut The New England Journal of Medicine published an interesting CPR study suggesting that people over age 60 actually tend to change their minds about wanting heroic CPR measures for sudden cardiac arrest once they learn the actual survival statistics – along with the commonly experienced neurological harms that can follow. For both acute and chronic illness cases, research participants were significantly more likely to change their minds once they were informed about the reality of post-CPR survival(5):\n\n“When asked if they wanted CPR in case of sudden cardiac arrest, 41 per cent of participants opted for CPR before learning the probability of survival to discharge (10-17 per cent). After learning the probability of survival, only 22 per cent opted for CPR.\n\n“And among older adults, only 6 percent of patients who were 86 years of age or older opted for CPR under these conditions.”\n\nLanguage matters too, as the NPR interview reported from physician and bioethicist Dr. Holland Kaplan, who explained:\n\n“Doctors may ask family members if patients ‘want everything done’ if their heart stops. But that puts a burden on both patients and families. Who wants to feel like they don’t want everything done for their loved one?’\n\nInstead, if CPR seems futile or hurtful, she suggests recommending the option to “allow natural death” instead of “do not resuscitate.”\n\nDr. Kaplan also told NPR that, even for healthcare professionals who perform CPR during cardiac arrest, “the bad experiences far outnumber the good ones, unfortunately. It’s no wonder that many doctors choose NOT to receive CPR themselves.”\n\nDr. Ken Murray explained why in this classic essay in TIME magazine called Why Dying is Easier for Doctors.\n\nMy own personal experience is also why I now have a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) order on my own Advance Care Planning documents. These have been shared, discussed, regularly updated carefully and signed by my closest family and my GP. My decisions stem from 10 years of regularly visiting my once-bright, vivacious, brilliant friend in the longterm care institution she’d been sent to after being “successfully” resuscitated. Those years had a profound and life-altering effect on me. At first, those of us who knew and loved her were so relieved that she was still alive, that she hadn’t died. But for over a decade, she deteriorated alarmingly, lying helpless in bed, in a dimly lit 5-bed ward, day after day, year after year. She often wept in my arms during my visits, repeatedly sobbing: “Every day, I wish they had not found me in time.” After these visits, I sat in the parking lot and wept, too.\n\nSigning a DNR order – or conversely deciding that you DO want to be resuscitated – is an intensely personal decision that should be clearly communicated – both verbally and in writing – to your family and to your doctors. What I or anybody else decides has nothing to do with the decisions of others.\n\nFor more about informing your family and doctors about what YOU want in case of cardiac arrest, read: “Who Will Speak For You When You Can’t?” Not having your important people on the same page can mean a terribly stressful tug-of-war some day in some Emergency Department or Intensive Care Unit – between those who may be reluctant to prolong your suffering and others who insist that everything that can be done MUST be done. Please tell them today what YOU want.\n\nAnd for a more accurate portrayal of what CPR looks like in daily life, skip those Grey’s Anatomy reruns. Instead, watch non-sugar-coated hospital documentaries, like the excellent series Emergency NYC or Lenox Hill (both streaming on Netflix).\n\n.\n\n1.
