        "text": "After a lengthy delay due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, ABC's longest-running scripted primetime series, Grey's Anatomy, finally returned to our TVs this spring, with just about the entire cast returning. And judging by what we've seen of the landmark 20th season of the mega-hit hospital soap, the drama that's in store for us this year was worth the extra wait.\n\nIt's not surprising, because so much went down in Season 19, with Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) leaving the place that raised her into a legendary surgeon so she could try to cure Alzheimer's Disease in Boston. The residency program is being resurrected by a ragtag group of interns, which includes Shepherd legacy Lucas (Niko Terho), as well as Blue (Harry Shum Jr.), Jules (Adelaide Kane), Mika (Midori Francis), and Simone (Alexis Floyd). Three of the five new recruits live together in Meredith's old house, while the other two are secretly hooking up, and it feels very much like Season 2 over here.\n\nWhat will these new interns continue to face in Season 20, and how will they cause their mentors to grow gray hairs? That remains to be seen, but here's what we know about Grey's Anatomy Season 20 (and Season 21!).\n\nGrey's Anatomy latest news\n\nNot only are the doctors in, they will remain in! On April 2, ABC renewed Grey's Anatomy for a 21st season, which will further extend its run as TV's longest-running medical drama. Creator Shonda Rhimes announced the news in an Instagram post.\n\nGrey's Anatomy release date\n\nGrey's Anatomy Season 20 premiered on Thursday, March 14 at 9/8c, followed by the final season of Station 19. The shortened season of Grey's will consist of 10 episodes. Grey's Anatomy had premiered in the fall of every broadcast season since its second season, but those tandem strikes derailed the calendar for everybody. Head here for ABC's full midseason premiere calendar.\n\nGrey's Anatomy Season 20 trailer\n\nAt the end of February, ABC released the first full-length trailer for Season 20. The 90-second spot somehow contains hours of drama, with Kim Raver's Teddy collapsing, doctors hooking up in backrooms, Ellen Pompeo's Meredith boldly announcing that she's scrubbing in, and my favorite: parking lot drama with new cast member Natalie Morales!\n\nIn January, ABC dropped the first real trailer for the new season of Grey's Anatomy, and it also manages to jam in a lot of different people's drama into 60 seconds, including a hint that Scott Speedman's Nick Marsh isn't going to be getting over Meredith moving across the country to Boston.\n\nNew Grey's Anatomy showrunner\n\nKrista Vernoff has been the showrunner of Grey's Anatomy for the past six years (and Station 19 for the past four), but she stepped down at the end of Season 19. Meg Marinis, who has worked on the show since Season 3 and written over 25 episodes, took over showrunner duties.\n\nGrey's Anatomy Season 20 cast\n\nGrey Sloan Memorial hasn't seen the last of Meredith Grey yet. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Ellen Pompeo is expected to appear in \"at least four\" episodes of Season 20 — which will be a 10-episode season due to strike-related delays. While four episodes would be only a small fraction of your typical Grey's Anatomy season, it's a sizable chunk of this one.\n\nSeason 20 will also see the return of longtime cast member Jessica Capshaw, per The Hollywood Reporter. Capshaw, who exited the series in 2018 after 10 seasons, will reprise her role as Dr. Arizona Robbins; reportedly, she will appear in just one episode. Alex Landi will also return as Dr. Nico Kim, alongside new Grey's guest stars Natalie Morales (playing Monica Beltran, a \"pragmatic\" pediatric surgeon) and Freddy Miyares (playing a \"likable\" patient named Dorian).\n\nAlongside the interns — Lucas (Niko Terho), Blue (Harry Shum Jr.), Jules (Adelaide Kane), Mika (Midori Francis), and Simone (Alexis Floyd) — the following series regulars are expected to return for Season 20:\n\nChandra Wilson as Miranda Bailey\n\nJames Pickens Jr. as Richard Weber\n\nKevin McKidd as Owen Hunt\n\nKim Raver as Teddy Altman\n\nCaterina Scorsone as Amelia Shepherd\n\nCamilla Luddington as Jo Wilson\n\nChris Carmack as Atticus 'Link' Lincoln\n\nAnthony Hill as Winston Ndugu\n\nJake Borelli as Levi Schmitt\n\nKelly McCreary departed the series in Season 19 after eight seasons on the show.\n\nThe major question mark is Scott Speedman, whose character, Nick Marsh, left the hospital in the Season 20 premiere to be with Meredith. However, with Pompeo due to pop up this season in multiple episodes, it's possible we haven't seen the last of Nick. Kate Walsh has also been making frequent trips back to the show as Addison Montgomery. There's been no news about Walsh's future on Grey's, but perhaps there's room for Addison to return full time to Grey Sloan...\n\nHas Grey's Anatomy been renewed for Season 21?\n\nYes! On April 2, ABC renewed Grey's Anatomy for Season 21. Creator Shonda Rhimes announced the news in an Instagram post, thanking fans, the cast, the writers, and the crew.\n\nShows like Grey's Anatomy\n\nIf you want more hospital drama in perhaps less rainy cities, check out these shows like Grey's Anatomy.\n\nWhere to watch"
