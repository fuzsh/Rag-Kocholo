Both ABC and Grey's creator Shonda Rhimes have previously said that the show will end when Pompeo exits. In making such a massive decision, Pompeo said that she and the others involved are asking themselves, \"What story do we tell? To end a show this iconic, how do we do it?\"\n\nNo one other than Oh could have played the whip-smart, fearless and secretly tenderhearted best friend of Meredith Grey, Dr. Cristina Yang.\n\nBut before she donned her TV scrubs, the dynamic actress had roles in The Princess Diaries, Under the Tuscan Sun and Sideways.\n\nOh left the series after 10 seasons. Since then, she has co-hosted the Golden Globes, won a Golden Globe for her performance as Eve Polastri on the BBC America series Killing Eve and has been nominated for three Emmys.\n\nIn 2021, the actress revealed she has no plans to ever return to the long-running medical drama series. On the premiere episode of the Los Angeles Times' Asian Enough podcast, Oh said \"in some ways, you do your work as a bubble and you let it go. I left that show, my God, seven years ago almost. So in my mind, it’s gone. But for a lot of people, it’s still very much alive. And while I understand and I love it, I have moved on.\"\n\nRamirez made their Grey’s Anatomy debut as Dr. Callie Torres in Season 2. Dr. Torres was the show's first-ever openly bisexual main character.\n\nBefore the actor’s role on the medical show, Ramirez appeared in the film You’ve Got Mail and won a Tony Award in 2005 for their “Lady of the Lake” role in Spamalot.\n\nRamirez announced their decision to leave the show following the Season 12 finale. In Ramirez's final episode, Callie and her ex, Arizona, agreed that they would co-parent their daughter together. “I’m deeply grateful to have spent the last 10 years with my family at Grey’s Anatomy & ABC but for now, I’m taking some welcome time off,” Ramirez wrote in a note in 2016. “Shonda been so incredible to work for, & we will definitely continue our conversations!”\n\nIn 2020, the star came out as nonbinary and announced that they use she/her and they/them pronouns. In 2021, it was revealed that Ramirez will join the cast of the Sex and the City reboot, And Just Like That.\n\nFans will recall that Mr. Meredith Grey was dramatically killed off in a Season 11 episode. \"After 11 seasons on Grey’s Anatomy, Dempsey is moving on to pursue other interests. Dr. Derek Shepherd is an iconic character and we’ve been proud to be the home of 'McDreamy' and the 'Mer/Der' love story,\" ABC said in a statement.\n\nBut that wasn’t the last of McDreamy! Dempsey reprised his role for the season 17 premiere.\n\nIn 2021, the actor announced that he will be reprising another one of his beloved roles. Dempsey is set to appear in Disenchanted, the sequel to his 2007 Disney hit, Enchanted, alongside Amy Adams.\n\nHeigl spent six dramatic seasons on Grey’s Anatomy as Dr. Izzie Stevens. During her run on the series, she was bullied for her modeling career by a fellow doctor, fell in love with a dying man and her character was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nBefore Grey’s Anatomy, the actress was the lead in the Disney Channel Original Wish Upon a Star. She also had a role on the TV series Roswell.\n\nThe Firefly Lane star returned to Grey’s Anatomy in 2020… sort of.\n\nIn a Season 16 episode, Grey's stunned viewers when it was revealed via a letter from Izzie’s long-time flame, Alex Karev, to his friends, that he had abandoned Seattle to reunite with Izzie. The couple was finally happy together, raising their two young twins on a horse farm in Kansas.\n\nAfter playing Dr. Karev for more than a decade, Chambers left the series. \"There's no good time to say goodbye to a show and character that's defined so much of my life for the past 15 years,\" the actor said in a statement to ET.\n\n\"For some time now, however, I have hoped to diversify my acting roles and career choices. And, as I turn 50 and am blessed with my remarkable, supportive wife and five wonderful children, now is that time.\"\n\nHe is currently listed as not having any upcoming projects.\n\nKnight’s character seemed to all but disappear from the series, only to return as a John Doe who could do little more than draw “007” (George’s nickname) into Meredith’s hand before dying.\n\nSince his time on the medical drama, Knight has had recurring roles on The Good Wife, The Bravest Knight and The Flight Attendant.\n\nIn 2020, Grey’s Anatomy brought O’Malley back to life for one more episode. \"What I loved about what [the writers] did with George...” the actor said in an interview about the episode, “was Meredith is having this vision, for lack of a better word, of who George would be … Meredith is seeing the best of George: She’s seeing his humor, his kindness, his generosity and in this brief moment that you get to see him, it’s such a great way to remember him.”\n\nDane currently has a role on the HBO series Euphoria.\n\nIn 2021, he reprised his McSteamy role for an episode of Grey’s. During the episode, Meredith asks whether Mark and Lexie are still together in the afterlife. \"On your beach looks like we are,\" Mark says. Sounds like Slexie shippers can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nAfter her character survived a car accident, a plane crash that resulted in her leg being amputated and the breakup of her relationship with Dr. Callie Torres, Capshaw left the medical series in 2018.\n\nCapshaw and her castmate, Sarah Drew, left the series around the same time. \"I will never stop being grateful for the chance to work with @sarahdrew and @JessicaCapshaw,\" show creator Shonda Rhimes wrote in a tweet after it was announced that the actresses were leaving the hit series. \"In April and Arizona, they created powerful unforgettable characters.\"\n\nThe actress is still playing the complicated and seemingly always in a love triangle Dr. Altman.\n\n“I am hopeful for Teddy. She has a long journey to gain forgiveness and I hope that we get to see that,” Raver said in an interview.\n\nWilliams’ character became a fan favorite thanks to his relationship with Dr. April Kepner. Japril fans were devastated to see Jackson Avery leave the series following Season 17.\n\nWhen asked if he thought the hit medical drama would end during the COVID-19 pandemic, Williams said, “I think the show is too important to go out without a damn parade.”\n\nHinton left Grey’s in 2017. Her character suffered burns from an explosion and left Grey Sloan Memorial to travel the world.\n\n\"I really love work that engages with the world,\" Hinton told ET in 2018. \"I believe that our entertainment shapes us and we shape our entertainment, and that ongoing dialogue is a fact of nature.”\n\nThe actress is now on M. Night Shyamalan’s Apple TV+ drama, Servant.\n\nTragically, Dr. Andrew DeLuca was stabbed to death in a 2021 episode.\n\n\"I'm more than satisfied,\" Gianniotti told ET in an exclusive interview of DeLuca's heartbreaking death. \"I really don't see how they could have done more for DeLuca or explained more with DeLuca... He's always been plagued, if you will, about doing the right thing at all costs. Unfortunately it cost him his life, but looking back, he doesn't regret it.\"\n\nDr. Koracick left the series in 2021, but according to producers, that doesn’t mean it’s the last we’ve seen of him.\n\n\"Greg Germann is a comic genius and we are so lucky that he brought his talents to our show these last few years,\" showrunner/executive producer Krista Vernoff said in a statement to ET. \"We will miss Greg terribly in the day to day -- but we plan to see Tom Koracick again!\"\n\nThe actor is still playing the lovably nerdy doctor on the medical drama series.\n\nDr. Levi Schmitt and Dr. Nico Kim (Alex Landi) are the first openly gay male doctor couple on the series. “Growing up gay in Ohio, I craved seeing gay storylines on television. I craved seeing things that reflected who I was at the time. It’s mind-blowing that I get to play the story that I would’ve craved to see when I was younger,” the actor told ET."
