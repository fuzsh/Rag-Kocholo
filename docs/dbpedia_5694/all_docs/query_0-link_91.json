        "text": "Grey's Anatomy has been officially renewed by ABC.\n\nThe network announced on Tuesday (April 2) that it has picked up a 21st season of the medical drama, with Deadline reporting it's likely to have 18 episodes.\n\nFans will be thrilled about the renewal, as well as the news that there will be a major increase from only 10 episodes in season 20 due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\n\nGrey's has gone through major changes these past few seasons, with Meg Marinis taking over for long-time showrunner Krista Vernoff and Ellen Pompeo only making guest appearances on screen.\n\nSeries creator Shonda Rhimes announced the season 21 renewal: \"The loyalty and love of Grey’s Anatomy fans has propelled us into a historic 21st season, and I could not be more grateful.\n\nRelated: Grey's Anatomy's Jessica Capshaw responds to fan reaction ahead of show return\n\n\"Meg Marinis’ storytelling is a gift that continues to keep the show vibrant, compelling and alive, and I can’t wait to see what she has in store for next season.”\n\nDeadline has reported that producers will begin trying to sign up the veteran cast to new contracts because many of their deals are up after season 20. The list includes original cast members Chandra Wilson (Dr Bailey) and James Pickens Jr (Dr Webber), plus Kevin McKidd (Dr Hunt), Kim Raver (Dr Altman), Camilla Luddington (Dr Wilson) and Caterina Scorsone (Dr Shepherd).\n\nShowrunner Meg Marinis recently suggested that it was likely that Grey's Anatomy would continue beyond its current season.\n\n\"I've not been informed that this is the last season, so I'm going to keep going and telling stories as long as they let me. We still have stories to tell,\" she told Deadline.\n\nRelated: Grey's Anatomy's Kevin McKidd talks Teddy and Owen's future after medical emergency\n\n\"We receive a tremendous amount of support from the studio and the network and from Shondaland. So I'm going to keep going until they tell me to put that pen down.\"\n\nWhile Grey's Anatomy will definitely be continuing, spin-off series Station 19 will be coming to an end later this year after seven seasons.\n\nGrey's Anatomy season 20 and Station 19's final season are airing on ABC in the US. Both shows stream on Disney+ in the UK.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
