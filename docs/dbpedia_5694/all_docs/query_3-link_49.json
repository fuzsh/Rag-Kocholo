        "text": "Have you ever watched a Grey’s Anatomy episode and thought, “How did they come up with that?!” From a man who had a disease that made his skin look like tree bark (a severe symptom of undetected HPV) to the time guest star Demi Lovato’s character could hear her organs (superior canal dehiscence syndrome), or whenever the doctors have to do a Whipple procedure (a very complicated surgery that removes cancer from the pancreas), these storylines are all created with the help of top-of-the-line, real-life doctors.\n\nSince 2013, a select number of residents temporarily join the writers each season as part of the Grey’s Anatomy Medical Communications Fellowship. Residents from all over the country apply to be in this highly competitive program, and this year we enlisted four fellows to share their own insight into and knowledge of the writers’ room. We spoke with the fellows — Shruti Koti, Yomi Alimi, Anna Melio, and Ania Rogalska — about their experiences and what they brought to the table for season 20.\n\nSo, what's your own medical story?\n\nSHRUTI KOTI, Northwell Health: I have finished my two years of general surgery residency, and I’m currently taking two years in the lab to do research. I don’t have a specialty yet. I am thinking of applying to a surgical oncology fellowship once I’m done with my residency.\n\nYOMI ALIMI, Virginia Mason Medical Center: I’m a urology resident at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle. I went to pharmacy school first at the University of Pittsburgh, and I worked as a pharmacist, and then I actually had colon cancer and had to [get] chemo and surgery. I decided I want to be a doctor and take care of people, which is what took me to medical school at Yale. So now, I’m an actual doctor in Seattle.\n\nANNA MELIO, Virginia Mason Medical Center: I am currently a general surgery resident up in Seattle. I grew up in Chicago and went to college at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where I started studying neuroscience and French. While I was there, I took an EMT certification course and then worked for a local ambulance company and fire department as an EMT in college. That was my first exposure to working in medicine and fostered my love of medicine. Initially, I didn’t think that I wanted to be a surgeon, but on my surgery rotations, I very quickly fell in love with the operating room. I’m still not 100 percent decided on what I want to do, but possibly surgical oncology or trauma.\n\nANIA ROGALSKA, University of Texas, Department of Surgery: I’m a general surgery resident right now. I’ve completed two years of surgery, and right now I’m doing a research year to study and investigate different protocols while testing different equipment that we use in the surgical field.\n\nEllen Pompeo, Alexis Floyd, and Ania Rogalska\n\nWhy become a Grey's Fellow?\n\nSK: I heard about it through one of the old chief residents at my program, who had sent it to somebody else, who sent it to me. I’ve loved Grey’s Anatomy, and I’ve always watched it, and it’s been one of my favorite shows. It has a lot of the things that I value in my hobbies and my personal life and also in my career. I’m very passionate about public health messaging, storytelling, and writing, so it just felt like the perfect thing for me to apply to. I live in New York, and the writers’ room has become hybrid, so they have opened it up to be virtual for the fellows, which is nice because I don’t think I would have been able to relocate for a couple months. But we did get to come in person and visit.\n\nYA: When I got to Seattle, I walked into our intern call room and saw this picture of Derek Shepherd. I never watched Grey’s — I was a Scrubs guy — but then I started watching it, and my girlfriend at the time was really into it. My program director sent me an advert for the fellowship, and I was like, “Oh, this is actually really interesting.” I am interested in medical communications, [and] I have a pretty diverse experience in health care. When I started watching Grey’s, I realized they were telling great stories. I was excited to be able to contribute and to make sure they could maintain the accuracy and realism. The show is about a lot of things I care about: Black women in medicine, Black men in medicine, issues surrounding abortion, racial justice issues.\n\nAM: I am interested in medical communication and the way in which patients interact with their health-care systems and the best ways that we can communicate medicine for our patients. I come from a background of people who are not in medicine, so I’m aware that people either get their medical information through things like Grey’s Anatomy and media and TV. I wanted to learn how it’s produced on that end and then also learn from the writers themselves and how they make very complex and very nuanced material digestible for such a wide audience. That was what inspired me to do it.\n\nAR: I’ve always had a big interest in just art in general. That was my initial passion in life — it actually wasn’t medicine. That creative outlook is maybe not as common for a lot of science people, so when I saw the Grey’s Anatomy thing come up, it was a nice way of marrying the two things that I really liked doing, which is medicine and then being more creative. It’s about trying to communicate to people what we do in surgery and have it in a more expressive and fun modality, as opposed to just the way we tell patients what their diagnosis is, and it seems a lot more rigid and textbook.\n\nShruti Koti in front of the Grey’s emergency room entrance.\n\nTell us about the job...\n\nSK: When the writers are discussing and writing and coming up with scenarios, the medical fellow is there to help guide all the medicine and answer any questions and come up with scenarios. So, one aspect is verification and fact-checking. It’s also really helpful for the writers on the show to have the perspective of someone who is in the middle of residency and has gone through those experiences recently. I got to share a lot of my personal experiences with patients and personal experiences with other staff in the hospital. And then, the third part would be coming up with a lot of the medical cases for the show.\n\nYA: We all come with different journeys to medicine, and that adds to the depth and breadth of the stories the writers tell. You’re reading the scripts and correcting it for little inaccuracies. There’s a medical summary that’s done for each episode — broad strokes, but also details of the different medical pieces of the story. That’s a document that goes out to everyone. There’s a pronunciation guide that we help with. We also get to be in medical scenes.\n\nAM: We are sent scripts as they come out by the writers. Sometimes the writers will put “Character says, ‘Medical, medical, medical,’” and I fill in the blanks of what someone could be asking for in that situation. The third aspect of it is more on that production element. Like, if there’s going to be a monitor in the background of this patient’s room, what vital signs could appear on that monitor? Or what kind of bandages would this person have?\n\nWhere can we see your influence this season?\n\nSK: I contributed the ambulance scene in the first episode — that whole scenario with Simone and Lucas and Bailey and Meredith. It was just so cool seeing it on-screen [in the premiere] and being like, “Oh, those were my lines that Meg [Marinis] took from the document I sent her and put into the script.”\n\nYA: So far, I’ve helped with episodes seven, eight, and nine. I haven’t had any big story arcs since those were mostly in place when I got here, but I’ve provided details for specific operations, making sure things are accurate. I learned about the real medical research behind Meredith’s Alzheimer’s research. We talked with the actual physician that wrote the paper [it’s based on] and helped provide feedback in terms of how to have Amelia and Meredith say certain things to add to the realism of it.\n\nAM: The thing that I was most proud of bringing to Grey’s Anatomy was my perspective on overarching topics like: What does it feel like to have long-term patients? What does it feel like to have patients who pass away? Or what does it feel like to have a big win? What does it feel like to be a broke intern and living in Seattle and not really sure what you’re doing, let alone how you can possibly be thought of to save lives?\n\nAR: In the first episode, I had four moments when I was captured on camera. I’m pushing a gurney in the first 30 seconds of the premiere. So, not only did I contribute to the medical components to the episode when I joined the team, but I got to watch them film it, and then I also contributed on set. When you watch the show, you think the actors know medicine, but when you come on set, they hold even the most basic surgical instrument incorrectly. So, even the smallest contribution on how to hold something correctly is important.\n\nWhat was it like to come to set?\n\nSK: I went a week after I finished just based on timings of when I was free, and it was really cool. I got to see all the sets and Meredith’s house and the hospital and where they film everything. And of course, I got to meet other writers in person, which was great because I had spent weeks and weeks just on Zoom with them. And I met Ellen Pompeo and Debbie Allen.\n\nYA: It was amazing meeting the writers. And meeting Ellen Pompeo was so surreal. I froze, and I blew my shot, which is why I don’t have a photo.\n\nAM: Everybody was so incredibly welcoming on the set and very kind to the fact that I had clearly never been in the realm of film or TV before. In the same way that there’s a language of medicine and understanding from people who have lived their lives within that space, there’s a well-coordinated, choreographed understanding on set. It was amazing just to see that and be involved. I was also really so happy that they were interested in what I had to say about the medical things!\n\nAR: It was an out-of-body experience in a way because you see the show and it looks effortless, but it takes so much to make it perfect. You realize how much work is put into 10 seconds of a show, and you develop a whole new level of respect for the job and how perfection isn’t just something that we see in surgery. That was a whole new level of appreciation for me.\n\nDebbie Allen and Yomi Alimi.\n\nWhat was most surprising about the set?\n\nSK: I was surprised that a lot of the parts that are filmed of the hospital and the hallways and the rooms are in different parts of the studio campus. Not everything connects all together. It all gets edited and cut and put together, but it was just funny seeing everything a bit separate because it looks so different than what we see on the screen.\n\nYA: How realistic it is! They threw me into a scene and had me as background, nothing crazy important, just fixing a sheet. But I immediately felt at home. Usually, I have social anxiety, and I get nervous, and sometimes that affects my performance in real life. But once I’m comfortable, I don’t feel it, and I was so comfortable.\n\nAM: I was very surprised by all of it. But No. 1, I was surprised by how many talented people were on the crew and how they all had different jobs I didn’t know existed. I watch TV, and I know there are people who are in props and costuming and lighting and all of those things, but speaking to them and seeing how many people were involved in this specific nuance was amazing. You know, actors are getting bloody, and the costuming people are looking specifically at where the blood lines up on the gowns so they can mimic it in future scenes. It was incredibly detailed and very cool.\n\nAR: How empty [the set] is in some spaces, because your imagination fills in the gaps when you’re watching the show. But when you’re on set, it’s a wall, and it’s not a room. So, there’s a lot of empty space that your imagination has always filled with a real place, but it’s not a real place.\n\nHow does Grey's compare to being a real-life doctor?\n\nSK: I think the medicine is very accurate. And I’m not just saying that because I was involved. The emotions are also really accurate, and what the residents go through, and the intensity of that feeling when you don’t really know what you’re doing but somebody’s life is in your hands.\n\nYA: I walked onto set, and I felt right at home. The realism is pretty surreal. You do have to suspend disbelief a little bit, but once you immerse yourself in the stories, you realize that the medicine is really just a conduit for them to tell these very human stories, and they do it very well.\n\nAM: It’s different but in positive, fantastic ways. It’s funny because [people in residency] joke like, “Oh, are you sleeping with all your coworkers?” or “Are you, like, pulling out LVAD wires?” That aspect of it is not true to life. But nobody wants to watch six hours of me sitting at a computer typing notes or studying in my bedroom for an exam after I’ve worked 12 hours. I am very impressed with how the writing team marries a job that is very cool but also largely not that cool and turns it into something that’s watchable.\n\nAR: A lot of times when I’ve been working and I’ve been having a lot of crazy days or crazy patients or crazy diagnoses, I have this feeling like, “You can’t write these things. You can’t make up these people.” But on the show, you see things that are crazy all the time. And there are a lot of weird situations and rare instances — things that you can never imagine happening — that [doctors] see. We don’t try to have people making out in the on-call room and having these really intense relationships because it wouldn’t be as professional, but I think that that’s part of the drama and the Hollywood of it all.\n\nWhich doc on the show do you most relate to?\n\nSK: My parents were just watching the show, and they finished up season 19 recently in preparation for season 20, and my dad said that Jules reminded him of me. She is very calm on the surface. I don’t really tend to display my anger or frustration or sadness or things like that, but I do feel them.\n\nYA: A little bit of every character resonates with me, but Lucas this season and last has resonated with me the most. He’s a smart guy who has ADHD, and I have ADHD. He really wants to do the right thing and believes he’s doing the right thing, and that’s like me.\n\nAM: My heart is with Dr. Cristina [Yang] a little bit, and I think a lot of surgeons would want to say the same from the original seasons. But of the new interns, I really like Jules. She works very hard, and she’s very good at operating.\n\nAR: Everyone wants to relate to Meredith because that’s the character that everyone wants to be. But it’s been interesting to see the newer interns develop. I’m still trying to figure out which one of them I’m most like.\n\nAnna Melio on set all dressed up!\n\nFinally, do real doctors watch Grey’s?\n\nSK: I think it depends on the stage and training. I watched it so much in medical school because it was aspirational, like “Oh, like, they get to do the real stuff.” Once I started residency, I wasn’t watching it as much, especially in the harder months because you spend 80-plus hours a week doing this thing, and in your downtime you want to do something different.\n\nYA: Oh, yeah. And I’m constantly sharing my experience with all my sisters. My sister went into medicine because of Grey’s Anatomy and Ellen Pompeo and her experience watching the show growing up.\n\nAM: We do! Yes. I don’t know many surgeons who would have the time to watch the series in a row all of the time. But I think most of my class has watched it. And most of the people I work with have watched Grey’s Anatomy, at least in some capacity. The fact that I was in a background shot of Grey’s Anatomy is going to be the coolest thing to surgeons. I’m going to be telling people forever!\n\nAR: The show has an impact on people that go into medicine. And I think medical people also look to the show just to see how their jobs are portrayed. Even spouses of people who are in medicine watch the show to connect with their significant others. It paints a story of what the career looks like, and it really shapes people.\n\nIf you have completed two years of a surgical residency and are interested in applying for the Grey’s Anatomy Medical Communications Fellowship, email greysfellowship@gmail.com.\n\nEmily Zemler is a freelance writer and journalist based in London.
