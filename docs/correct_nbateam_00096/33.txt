Former NBA head coach and current team executive John Lucas has emerged as a candidate for the Houston Rockets’ coaching vacancy, according to reports.

The Houston Chronicle and The New York Times both reported that Lucas, who hasn’t led an NBA team in 17 years, joins a growing list of candidates to replace the departed Mike D’Antoni.

The Chronicle reported late last week that Rockets have scheduled meetings with former Brooklyn Nets floor boss Kenny Atkinson, Denver Nuggets assistant coach Wes Unseld Jr., Dallas Mavericks assistant Stephen Silas and Los Angeles Clippers assistant Tyronn Lue. Jeff Van Gundy has also been linked to the post.

Lucas, 66, currently the team’s director of player development, is poised to get an interview, too, per the reports. Lucas has been the team’s development coach since 2016 and has a strong relationship with stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook and the rest of the Rockets players, per the reports.

Lucas has NBA head coaching experience. He compiled a 173-258 overall record with the San Antonio Spurs (1992-1994), Philadelphia 76ers (1994-1996) and Cleveland Cavaliers (2001-2003).

Lucas played 14 seasons in the league, including three stints with the Rockets, who drafted him No. 1 overall out of Maryland in 1976. He averaged 10.7 points and 7.0 assists per game in 928 NBA games.

D’Antoni parted ways with the club last month after turning down extension offers prior to the season. He guided the Rockets to a 44-28 record in 2019-20 and a 217-101 (.682) mark since taking over in 2016-17. Houston was 28-23 in the postseason during D’Antoni’s tenure, losing in the conference semifinals three times and the conference finals once (2017-18).
