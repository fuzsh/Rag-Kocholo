        "text": "OTTUMWA — It felt a little bit like deja-vu.\n\nFor the third time this season, Dawson Weller came up to the plate late in a game at John Hart Stadium for the Ottumwa baseball team with the score tied. Weller snapped a 2-2 in the bottom of the sixth inning of Ottumwa's home-opening win over Ames back on May 22, then drove in the only run in eight innings against Waukee in a 1-0 opening win of a hard-fought doubleheader with the eighth-ranked (4A) Warriors just 11 days earlier.\n\n\"I've been here before,\" Weller said. \"I just had to put a ball in play. That's what I did.\"\n\nWeller delivered his third game-winning hit at home this season for the Bulldogs, coming through in extra innings for the second time in less than two weeks. The Ottumwa freshman's most recent clutch hit came with the bases loaded and nobody out in the bottom of the eighth on Friday, ripping a 3-2 pitch through a drawn-in Norwalk infield to bring home Tucker Long with the winning run clinching a 3-2 win over the Warriors in Class 4A, Substate 6 first-round action setting off a familiar celebration in the final game of the season at Legion Memorial Field.\n\n\"Coming up with the bases loaded, I was looking for something dead red down the middle,\" Weller said. \"Even when I got two strikes on me, I knew that (Norwalk starting pitcher C.J. Davis) had to bring it to me. I just waited on a strike, got an outside fastball and took it to right.\n\nIf they're playing back on the infield, you never know what might have happened. Having the infield playing in looking for the out at home, I was able to put it right past the first and second baseman to win the game.\"\n\nWeller found just enough space going to right to secure a pair of clutch hits on Friday night. Before lining the game-winning pitch past Norwalk's drawn-in infield, Weller was able to line a pitch that Payton Nichols nearly snagged for an out in the bottom of the fourth inning with Nolan Heller standing at third.\n\nInstead of being robbed of a potential game-tying hit, Weller's liner bounced off the edge of Nichols' glove dropping into shallow right. By mere inches, Ottumwa had tied the score at 2-2.\n\n\"He (Nichols) was there and the ball was in his glove for just a split second,\" Weller said. \"When it bounced out, I just hustled on down to first. I hit it just hard enough to tie the ballgame.\"\n\nWeller's first hit came after a pair of errors allowed Ottumwa (30-10) to erase a two-run Norwalk lead in a matter of minutes. Ground balls hit by Javen Rominger and Cameron Manary turned into consecutive throwing error by the Warrior infield, cutting Norwalk's lead to 2-1 while putting the tying run at third base with no outs.\n\n\"It just kind of snowballed in a hurry for us,\" Weller said. \"Once we got the momentum, the nerves we had in the first couple of innings quickly went away.\"\n\nEarly nerves by the Bulldogs were compounded by a physical challenge for Ottumwa sophomore pitcher Tucker Long. Back on the mound for the first time since coming within a pitch of throwing his second no-hitter of the season six days earlier against Davenport Central, Long retired the first six Norwalk batters before running into sudden trouble in the top of the third allowing three hits and a walk with RBI singles by Colton Moore and Davis giving the Warriors a 2-0 lead.\n\n\"I actually have a cut on the top of my foot that I've been playing with all season. When I drag my right foot across the mound, I get into it and I have to deal with a little bit of pain,\" Long said. \"I had my foot wrapped. In the third inning, the wrapping came undone. It was starting to hurt me a little bit. I was struggling to get my pitches under command.\"\n\nOttumwa's defense had Long's back. Matthew Mitchell threw out Moore trying to score on a one-out ground ball by Aidan Harder before Long came back to strike out Nichols, keeping Norwalk's lead at just two runs.\n\n\"Other than one rough inning, it was a good night,\" Long said. \"That's how baseball goes sometimes. You never want to give up any runs, but if they do you just try to minimize the damage. I think we did a good job of that.\"\n\nLong and Davis would dual through regulation with Davis retiring 10 of 11 Bulldogs after Weller was thrown out at home in the bottom of the fourth trying to score on a ground ball to third base by Mitchell. Long, meanwhile, allowed just three base runners to reach over the final five innings, finishing with 11 strikeouts while throwing what would have been his 110th and final pitch to retire Nichols looking in the top of the eighth, keeping the game tied at 2-2 heading into the bottom of the eighth with Long leading off at the plate\n\n\"I knew the eighth inning was going to be my last inning on the mound,\" Long said. \"You always look to capitalize when you step up to the plate leading off, especially when it's late like that. You know the game needs to get finished.\"\n\nLong began to put the finishing touches on Norwalk (13-19), driving a pitch up the middle for a lead-off single. Rominger would follow with a base hit of his own before Manary laid down a bunt that got past Davis, loading the bases for Weller who delivered the winning run on Ottumwa's fourth hit of the inning and seventh overall hit of the game.\n\n\"For a lot of our guys, this was their first postseason experience,\" Ottumwa head baseball coach John Jaeger said. \"We talked with the guys about how that playoff atmosphere brings a different feel to it. We kind of felt that in the first three innings. I thought our kids kept their composure really well. We kept putting the ball in play. It was just a matter of time before we could break the ice.\n\n\"We kept pushing and pushing and battling and battling. We finally broke the ice, forced a couple errors and pushed a couple runs across. I felt pretty confident coming up in the eighth with the top of our line-up coming up. Those guys all had great at-bats to put Dawson in the position to come up with another big hit.\""
