        "text": "From Tulsa to Italy to Shanghai, John Lucas III has made many stops in his professional basketball career. Undrafted out of Oklahoma State in 2005 Lucas actually began his pro career with the Timberwolves' summer league team before racking up the frequent flyer miles to all points of the globe.\n\nTo say he's a known face of the NBA is more than a stretch. He's played fewer than 250 games in his NBA career but has latched on with the Timberwolves a second time, signing here in September.\n\nWould you know Lucas if you passed him on First Ave.? Chances are that answer is no. And that's for sure the case for a trio of Wolves fans who interrupted Lucas' pregame steps-running routine at Target Center on Thursday night to ask if he'd take their picture in front of the court.\n\nHey, at least they didn't use a selfie stick.\n\nHere's video, from espn.com by way of TNT"
