        "text": "What Sean Marks called “the little rebuilding we’re having” Sunday continued apace this week. The Brooklyn Nets didn’t add any draft picks to their current stash of 27 — 16 firsts and swaps plus 11 seconds — through 2031. They did re-sign Trendon Watford to a $2.7 million vets minimum deal, a one-year contract that will make Watkins an unrestricted free agent a year from now.\n\nSo, Brooklyn now has 14 players under contract but two of the 14, Mamadi Diakite and Jalen Wilson, are not fully guaranteed. Of the 14, eight are either on vets minimum or rookie deals, a good thing for a rebuilding team. However, it should be noted that NBA teams can bring up to 20 players into camp. They don’t have to down to 15 (plus three two-ways) until the day before the season opener. And with so much about the Nets no longer bound by traditional team-building, don’t be surprised if Sean Marks & co. let players fight for the final spots.\n\nAdding to the roster uncertainty, Brooklyn is apparently offering a number of their veteran players in trades. They have three expiring deals in Bojan Bogdanovic at $19.0 million, Dorian Finney-Smith at $14.9 million and Dennis Schroder at $13.0 million. Cam Johnson who it would seem has the most value among free agents still has around $70 million on his deal over the next three years. (Jake Fischer wrote Monday that trade talks for Johnson may be complicated by the number of unlikely bonuses in his contract. Teams, he writes, are wary of deals that might change — rise — in the future should a player meet the criteria for unlikely bonuses.)\n\nAccording to the internet capologists, Brooklyn is now $8.16 million below the luxury tax threshold which Sean Marks emphasized again Sunday on ESPN will not be breached. The Nets still have access to the MLE of $12.8 million and the BAE of $4.7 million this off-season but are unlikely to use them.\n\nIn his talk with ESPN’s Tim Legler and Marc Kestecher Sunday, Marks also said Joe Tsai is on board.\n\n“Us not being in the tax this year was by design. We don’t plan on being in there, and we’ll kept that future flexibility and make sure when it’s the right time, we’ve got an ownership group, like Joe, who has shown the capacity to go in and pay tax when we’re competitors, when we’re really gonna contend for a championship. So that in our back pocket is vital too,” said Marks.\n\nThe general sense among insiders is that the Johnson and DFS will not be around much longer, that they will be elsewhere for the start of training camp come the first week of October. In their place, you’d assume there’d be lower paid, maybe younger players as well as more draft capital. A good guess might be picks in the 2026 Draft where Brooklyn has only its own pick.\n\nThose moves will also affect final numbers on 2025 cap space which won’t be known until well into next season, but the best estimate now is Brooklyn will have between $49.5 million (Keith Smith/Spotrac) and $60 million (Yossi Gozlan/CapSheets) going into free agency. Either way, the Nets would top the list.\n\nThere were a few other housekeeping items to keep track of. The Nets, it was confirmed, added a new trade exception worth $23.3 million in the Mikhail Bridges trade. It’s the league’s second largest. They now have four TPEs, including the Bridges biggie. The Nets also have $9.5 million from the Royce O’Neale trade and small, virtually worthless $1.3 million left over from the Spencer Dinwiddie trade. (Two others — the $11.9 million remnant of the Joe Harris trade exception and $6.8 million TPE from the Patty Mills trade — expired.)\n\nIt’s all about flexibility — the picks, the expiring deals, the trade exceptions, developing players, tens of millions of dollars in cap space, Tsai’s willingness to spend, etc. — the Nets will need if they are going to keep the rebuild mercifully short. Again, no guarantees despite Marks calling it “a little rebuilding.”\n\nIn talking with Locked on Nets this week, Gozlan said he thought the Nets were extremely well positioned with all their rebuilding assets and an apparent understanding of how the new CBA works.\n\n“I think the Nets are one of the best positioned teams in the league, definitely top 5 when you think about teams like OKC. They have the best position now and in the future. Then you’ve got teams like Brooklyn, Utah — these teams with surplus of first round picks — the Spurs,” Gozlan told Doug Norrie. “I think Nets are extremely well positioned.”\n\nIndeed, by next summer, they could have the largest stash of draft picks, including as many as many as five picks in the top 40 of a historic draft and the largest stash of 2025 cap space and may be near the top in the value of trade exceptions.\n\nBut Gozlan emphasized that the Nets turnaround is a multi-year program. that despite all the work positioning the franchise, it will likely take the next two NBA Drafts — in 2025 and 2026 — for Brooklyn to be “more competitive.” Marks also mentioned that two-year timeframe when he explained to Legler and Kestecher why he and Tsai decided to move Bridges to the Knicks for all that draft capital.\n\n“When you move somebody like Mikal, those decisions aren’t quite as simple as they maybe appear to be. We thank Mikal for his time here, but this fits us better, our timeline, how we’re gonna build sustainably, keeping a lot of flexibility over these next couple years here.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nIndeed, the bottom line here is that fans will have to trust the process, hopefully not the draconian one the 76ers put their fanbase and the NBA through a decade back (ultimately without much to show for it.) And the Nets strongly believe New York is not Philadelphia, that the city itself will attract players. That was certainly a big part of Nic Claxton’s decision to stay. The Spartanburg, S.C. native raved about the city in talking about this decision to re-sign.\n\nSummer League stories: The Long Island connection\n\nLucas Kaplan remains in Las Vegas for us covering the Summer League. The Nets are 1-1, but that record really doesn’t matter to anyone but the players. Everyone else, coaches, front office personnel, pundits and fans are looking at which players are doing well, which have improved and which might wind up on the Brooklyn or Long Island rosters come fall.\n\nThe biggest story out of Las Vegas is, as expected (and hoped,) Noah Clowney who has been proving that his stint at the end of last season was not a fluke. ICYMI, back in April, the 6’10” power forward averaged 12.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in 24.7 minutes a game with shooting splits of 60/47/72. In one game, he had seven blocks, in another he hit 3-of-4 3-pointers and in two other games he grabbed 10 boards each.\n\nIn his first two games, Clowney, who turned 20 Sunday, is averaging 13.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.0 blocks in 30 minutes a game, with shooting splits of 61/29/50. A small sample size but he looks very good in doing it.\n\nAs Steve Hetzel said Sunday about his defense,\n\n“I think for Noah has an incredible knack for protecting the rim,” said the Nets assistant coach who handling Summer League head coaching duties. “He’s got great timing, great length, and he blocks a lot of shots, But what he’s gotten really good at is the rule of verticality, just jumping straight up, straight down. Something that we’ve been working on.”\n\nMoreover, his late defense on the Pacers Jarace Walker was one of the keys to the Nets big turnaround on Friday night. It’s gotten noticed outside the Nets organization and fandom as well.\n\nLast year, of course, Clowney was the 4th youngest player in the league, only 18 years old. Nets fans, like Hollinger, had little confidence in his NBA game. The organization, blessed with more patience, liked some of what they saw and sent him off to finishing school in Long Island where Mfon Udofia and his staff did an admirable job developing him. Will he start for Brooklyn next to Nic Claxton in October? That would seem a certainty if Dorian Finney-Smith is, as rumored, on the way out (hopefully to a better team.)\n\nClowney himself spoke highly of the development team out on the Island, as our Lucas Kaplan wrote.\n\n“I think coaching, and even the staff in Long Island — all the staff, front office, whatever it may be — I think they all put you in uncomfortable positions and make you get comfortable in ‘em. They build your confidence from there. And it’s the same work we put in Brooklyn we put in there.”\n\nAnd that is absolutely critical to any rebuild, taking a guy your scouts think has potential and mining it whether in a G League setting or the Summer League or if opportunity presents itself, in the NBA.\n\nThe Long Island crew also deserves some credit for Keon Johnson who two teams — the Clippers and Trailblazers — gave up on. Taken six spots ahead of Cam Thomas in the 2021 Draft, he too took a turn for the better after Brooklyn signed him to a two-way. His issue was controlling his greatest asset, his jaw-dropping athleticism. As Hetzel, who worked with Johnson in Portland said, the player he is now is a big improvement over the player he was with the Blazers and before Long Island.\n\n“Like I’ve spoken before, it’s growth. He’s maturing as a player, the game is slowing down for him, which is allowing him to slow down on the court and he’s making these positive plays.”\n\nJohnson himself has talked about his growth while a member of the Nets organization.\n\n“I’m starting to put myself in better positions, where I can show what I can do with the ball in my hands and also playing off the ball,” he said Saturday. In two summer league games, he’s averaging 21.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 3.0 steals while shooting 57/40/88. And if you’re looking for a number to indicate improvement in control, KJ has had only four turnovers in two games, including one in Friday’s night game.\n\nAs our guy Lucas noted, the Nets have made good use of Long Island in recent years and will have be an even a bigger factor going forward.\n\nAs we were writing this tome Monday morning, Erik Slater broke some news...\n\nNo word on how it went or even the workout was private or included other teams. Hayes (whose nickname is “Purple,”) was waived by Detroit last February in a roster management move, four years after taking him at No. 7 in the 2020 Draft. (If you want an example of how a rebuild can screwup, check out the Pistons’ history.) There were no issues other than he had disappointed in his three and a half seasons after being drafted ahead of Tyrese Haliburton and Tyrese Maxey, among others. In 210 games with the Pistons, his shooting splits were 38/28/78. By some measures, he was the worst shooter in the NBA. But he’s 6’5”, plays good D and has good court vision. His assist to turnover ratio was a very solid 2.7-to-1.\n\nWhen Slater broke the news, the internet was filled with memes that suggested that he and Ben Simmons, whose shooting struggles are indeed legendary, would be the Nets tank commanders this season.\n\nThat silliness aside, this is what teams confident in their development infrastructure can do: take a chance on a player who was a five-star high school recruit or a one-and-one college player or, in Hayes case, a European rising star. They can’t give him a two-way deal. Only players with three or fewer seasons in NBA are eligible, but they can sign him to a camp invite. Teams can bring 20 players into camp. If cut, their G League rights automatically go to Long Island.\n\nThe Nets have had a good record finding gems either in the second half of the first round or beginning of the second or even rummaging around the NBA’s bargain bin. Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Nic Claxton Cam Thomas, and now hopefully Noah Clowney all qualify.\n\nAgain, we don’t know if the Nets liked what they saw today or didn’t. We don’t know if Hayes or his agents liked what they heard from the Nets or liked what another team might have told them. But this is due diligence, it’s what rebuilding teams do. Despite playing more than 200 NBA games, Hayes is still only 22 years old.\n\nThe Nets hit the jackpot with Harris and Dinwiddie in 2016. One became a two-time 3-point percentage leader and beat Steph Curry in the All-Star Weekend 3-point shootout. The other averaged 20 points a game. Both wound up making nearly $100 million over the course of their careers. Give it a shot with Hayes or someone similarly situated. You know, beggars, choosers.\n\nClaxton gets new role?\n\nLost in Sean Marks discussion with ESPN Sunday was his discussion of how Nic Claxton might play a larger role ... on offense.\n\n“He’ll have the ball in his hands more often.” said Marks.\n\nPart of that may be necessity. The Nets are not a finely tuned offensive team and if they drop players like Cam Johnson and Bojan Bogdanovic (the only player to average 20 point a game other than Cam Thomas on the roster,) it will get tougher to put up points. They’ll need everyone to contribute more.\n\nIn the past, of course, there was not much need for the now 25-year-old to put up points or play any role that doesn’t start with a “D.” And his lack of production hasn’t helped much. He’s 3-of-19 from three in his five years as an NBA player, a 15.8% rate. His career assist per game number is 1.9. Noah Clowney in his half a season, is 12-of-33 from three and 1.8. Day’Ron Sharpe is also 12-of-33 and 1.0.\n\nBut those with longer memories may recall how Tom Crean, the head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs utilized Claxton as a near 7-foot playmaker on occasion in his sophomore year. Video exists.\n\nVideo also exists of Claxton’s final Long Island Nets game just before COVID shut down the league. If the Nets can get any production like this from Claxton, it will be a far more interesting season for the big man...\n\nClaxton scored 34 points, grabbed nine rebounds, handed out four assists, shot 10-of-16 overall and 3-of-5 from three (as many threes as he’s made in his NBA career.)\n\nYes, we know it was one game and yes, we know that the NBA is more daunting than the Southeast Conference, particularly in a bad year. Still, this, too, is what rebuilding is about: not just finding diamonds in the rough but finding skillsets among your current players. And like diamonds in the rough, this may not work out either.\n\nJobs, jobs, jobs!\n\nThe Nets did fill a job this week. Matt MacDonald who was assistant GM in Long Island last season under J.R. Holden, has been promoted to the top job out in Uniondale. MacDonald has been with the Nets since 2018, moving from basketball operations assistant to scouting operations coordinator to assistant GM.\n\nThere are still a few opening left to fill, and Brian Lewis reported this week that they’re likely to be filled internally, adding “B.J. Johnson — who has run the draft as director of player evaluation — is among several execs expected to get internal promotions, a source told the Post. That would suggest that Johnson is a good bet to wind up as Sean Marks No. 2, whatever title that might hold.\n\nBeyond the No. 2 job in the front office, one interesting job where there might a change in title is that of capologist. Long-time Nets executive Matt Tellem left this summer to take on the herculean task of Suns’ capologist. He had been vice president of strategy in Brooklyn.\n\nWhile capology is a job where a number of Nets staffers have responsibilities, the lead guy now is Makar Gevorkian, whose current title is Senior Director of Salary Cap & Strategy. He too is pretty much a Nets lifer, starting as a seasonal employee back in 2020, not long after he graduated from the University of Chicago Law School. He seems to have done a pretty, pretty good job in the last few weeks.\n\nFinal Note\n\nThe sports betting services are out with their projected win totals and way down at the bottom are your Brooklyn Nets with 19.5 wins. Of course, as we noted up top, the roster remains unsettled although the strategy does not. The bad news is that a 20-win season will be painful for everyone, period, particularly for the players and coaches. The good news that will help the Nets get a top pick, maybe even Cooper Flagg, the Maine wunderkind who everyone has as a transformative if not generational player. It will not secure the Nets getting Flagg. A change in rules has lessened the lottery chances of the team with the worst record.\n\nIn the meantime, halfway through the off-season, just remember, there are reasons why they play the games."
