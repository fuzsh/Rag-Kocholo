        "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Quarterback Hudson Card, offensive lineman Gus Hartwig and linebacker Kydran Jenkins will join head coach Ryan Walters to represent Purdue Football at Big Ten Media Days in Indianapolis later this month. The Boilermakers' head coach and senior trio will take part in the first day of the event, July 23, at Lucas Oil Stadium to speak to the media and look ahead to the 2024 season.\n\nOther schools joining Purdue on the first day will be Illinois, Northwestern, Ohio State, Rutgers and Wisconsin. Big Ten Network will broadcast six consecutive hours of live coverage every day, beginning at 11 a.m. ET. Rick Pizzo and Jake Butt will host morning coverage of the day's press conferences, while Dave Revsine, Gerry DiNardo and Howard Griffith will interview all attendees on the BTN set during afternoons.\n\nCard returns to Big Ten Media Days for the second straight year. During his first season in the Old Gold and Black, the signal caller started 11 games and finished third in passing yards per game as well as completions per game. The Austin, Texas, native threw for 2,387 yards with 15 touchdowns, while also recording 203 yards and five touchdowns on the ground to showcase his mobility. Leading Purdue to a win over Indiana in the Old Oaken Bucket Game, Card accounted for 360 yards of offense (275 passing, 85 rushing) and four touchdowns (three passing, one rushing) to become the first quarterback since Drew Brees (2000) to pass for at least 275 yards and rush for at least 85 yards in the same game.\n\nA focal point on the Purdue offensive line since arriving on campus in 2020, Hartwig enters his fifth and final season as a Boilermaker. The four-time All-Big Ten Honorable Mention center has started 36 games throughout his career. Returning from an injury suffered at the end of the 2022 campaign, Hartwig started the final nine games last season and helped pave the way for Purdue to lead the Big Ten in rushing in conference games and tallying the most rushing yards (2,029) in a single season since 2012.\n\nJenkins attends Big Ten Media Days as one of the leaders of the Purdue defense. Heading into the 2024 season, the senior linebacker looks to climb the Purdue career charts in sacks and tackles-for-loss. The Louisville, Georgia, native currently ranks 10th all-time with 16.5 sacks as well as 18th in program history with 31.5 TFLs. Last year, Jenkins finished second in the Big Ten and 18th nationally with 15.5 TFLs, the most by a Boilermaker since George Karlaftis in 2019 (17.0). He became the first Boilermaker to lead the team in TFLs in back-to-back seasons since Jake Replogle (2014-15). Jenkins also added 7.5 sacks a season ago, ranking third in the conference.\n\nPurdue enters the second season with Walters guiding the Boilermakers. Despite one of the nation's toughest schedules in 2023, Purdue tied for fourth in the Big Ten West and won both rivalry games to keep possession of the Cannon Trophy (Illinois) and the Old Oaken Bucket (Indiana) for the third straight season. The Boilermakers also found success in all three phases of the game. The offense led the Big Ten in rushing in conference contests, averaging 184.6 yards per game. That included the Boilermakers rushing for more than 300 yards in back-to-back games for the first time since 1968. On the defensive side of the ball, Purdue recorded 35 sacks, the most since 2004 and the third-most in program history. The 2023 special teams unit averaged 24.2 yards per kickoff return, Purdue's best since 2004 and the fourth-most all-time.\n\nFor updates while the Boilermakers are at Big Ten Media Days, follow Purdue Football on X (Twitter) and Instagram @BoilerFootball."
