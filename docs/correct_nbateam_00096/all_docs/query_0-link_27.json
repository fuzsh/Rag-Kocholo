        "text": "The Houston Rockets have a new coaching staff and a new rookie class headlined by No. 4 pick Amen Thompson.\n\nHowever, there's one mainstay from last year's team that could have an impact on Thompson ... John Lucas. When Thompson visited the Rockets in the pre-draft process, he got to know a little more about the Houston lead assistant from last year's team.\n\n\"We were just trying to get to know each other,\" Thompson said via Kelly Iko of The Athletic. \"John Lucas is very exciting. I would love to get to train with him, he brings out the best in you. But just trying to get to know each other and see if Iâ€™m a good fit.\"\n\nLucas has an eye for player development, specifically with point guards considering that's what he played during his playing career from 1977-90. Lucas was able to parlay that into a 30-year coaching career, spending the last three seasons as the lead assistant under Stephen Silas.\n\nHowever, when Silas was fired and flocked over to the Detroit Pistons, Lucas stayed in Houston with the franchise that drafted him 47 years ago.\n\nNow, he'll hope to develop another top Rockets draft pick and elevate his game to a whole new level.\n\nYou can follow Jeremy Brener on Twitter @JeremyBrener.\n\nWant the latest in news and insider information on the Houston Rockets?
