        "text": "We’re just a few days away from the opening of New Orleans Saints training camp in Irvine, California. There is a particular group of players who could take a major step forward this season, ultimately positively impacting the team.\n\nThree on the following list are new rookie arrivals, some are NFL veterans looking to elevate their careers to the next level and others were former Saints’ draft picks who are possibly assuming primary roles. A trio of young offensive linemen headline the list.\n\nHere are 10 Saints to watch:\n\nLet’s start with this year’s first-round pick, Taliese Fuaga. Although it’s still early in the process, he is being considered a player with All-Pro potential. Most NFL prognosticators have lauded his potential and awarded the Black and Gold an “A” grade for the pick, terming him a “stud with nastiness.”\n\nThe Saints quickly slid Fuaga into the left tackle spot. Throughout rookie camp, OTAs and minicamp, they have really liked what they have seen. The pads come on soon, and that’s when we’ll get a clearer picture.\n\nNick Saldiveri is in a jumbled competition at left guard along with veteran free agent additions Lucas Patrick and Shane Lemieux. During minicamp, the now 6-6, 330-pouner appeared to have separated himself and drew rave reviews from the staff.\n\nLimited to four games in his rookie season in 2023, he started 35 contests at Old Dominion, proving to be tough, durable, and possessing a high football IQ and outstanding blocking recognition. He displays good knee bend, is patient in pass protection with a good base, and keeps his feet moving in blocking assignments. The Saints recognized great potential and traded up in the fourth round of the ’23 draft to get him.\n\nDefensive end Chase Young is not yet 100 percent physically but the early prognosis has been trending upward, and he seems to be on schedule concerning tests on his neck injury. The Saints signed him to a one-year, $13 million prove-it deal.\n\nThe 25-year-old was the second overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. He was selected as the 2020 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, earning a spot in the Pro Bowl that season as well. Thus far in his career, he has accumulated 100 tackles and 16.5 sacks in 32 NFL starts. Last season, he posted 7.5 sacks, including one in Super Bowl LVIII against the Kansas City Chiefs. He could be an ideal piece on the edge along with Cam Jordan and Carl Granderson.\n\nLinebacker Willie Gay, a five-year veteran and two-time Super Bowl champion with the Chiefs, is very active. The 6-1, 243-pound former Mississippi State Bulldog has collected 233 tackles, 5 sacks, and 4 interceptions since arriving as a second-round pick of the Chiefs in the 2020 draft. He could be a major addition to the Saints’ defense for the foreseeable future.\n\nKendre Miller is still somewhat of a mystery. Saints fans may not have witnessed his true potential since he was inactive for nine games as a rookie last season. He did flash some potential, totaling 73 yards on 13 carries against Atlanta in the season finale and showing great patience on many of those runs. In week 9 against the Bears, he made an attention-grabbing 31-yard catch near the sideline. He cradled an over-the-shoulder swing pass in week five against New England and then galloped 33 yards upfield.\n\nOf Miller’s 51 touches as a rookie, 15 produced first downs. Pro Football Focus tabbed the 22-year-old, 6-0, 220-pounder as a sleeper for the 2024 campaign.\n\nTight end Dallin Holker received a $235,000 guarantee along with a $10,000 signing bonus as an undrafted rookie free agent this year. The 6-2, 241-pound former Colorado State star could be utilized in an assortment of ways in the new-look Klint Kubiak offense.\n\nWith Juwan Johnson suffering an injury that could keep him on the shelf for an undetermined period, Holker could see his practice reps increase from the start. He possesses an uncanny catching radius, reliable hands and decent run-after-catch ability. Holker is sneaky fast. He will have to fine-tune his blocking skills.\n\nTrevor Penning couldn’t be left off this list. He has been the center of attention for many observers. The former first-round pick in 2022 has seemingly gotten a new lease on his NFL life since moving to right tackle during the offseason. Said to have started the offseason with a clean slate, Penning has drawn positive feedback from Dennis Allen, Klint Kubiak and new offensive line coach John Benton.\n\nCedrick Wilson, a seven-year veteran, was added to bolster the overall depth at wide receiver. The 6-2, 197-pounder with 4.53 speed and a 37″ vertical appeared comfortable in his route running during OTAs and minicamp.\n\nA sixth-round pick of the Cowboys in 2018, Wilson has accumulated 101 catches for 1,269 yards and 11 scores in his career. A very diligent worker, the 28-year-old served as a deep threat for Dallas and later with the Miami Dolphins. He can track the ball well as a route runner.\n\nWilson’s father spent seven seasons in the NFL (49ers, Steelers) and was part of the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh squad in 2006, teaming with Hines Ward, Antwaan Randle El and running back Jerome Bettis.\n\nWill Harris, a six-year veteran, hasn’t drawn a lot of attention. He was a below-the-radar free agent addition this offseason who has been an active NFL contributor with 246 tackles, 14 passes broken up and 2 interceptions from his secondary spot.\n\nThe 6-1, 207-pound Boston College product was a third-round pick of the Lions in 2019. Possessing skills to play either safety or nickel, he is a treasured pickup. Harris has played in 41 NFL games with 31 starts.\n\nHarris’ father played wide receiver at Mississippi State (1989-’92) and was drafted by the Bills in 1993.\n\nBub Means, a fifth-round pick of the Saints this season, could maneuver his way into the three-wide receiver set as a rookie. A few NFL websites identified Means as a potential impact player as a rookie.\n\nWith the required size at 6-1, 212 pounds, he can negotiate the 40-yard dash in 4.43 seconds with an impressive 39.5″ vertical. He recorded 19 reps on the 225-pound bench press test at the NFL Combine, which caught everyone’s attention.\n\nThe offensive scheme at Pitt limited his deep play potential, although Means corralled 41 passes for 721 yards and six touchdowns in 2023. He uses his body very well to shield the ball from defenders. Having experience at cornerback earlier in his college career has helped his maturation as a receiver."
