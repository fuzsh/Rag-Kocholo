        "text": "SUNNYVALE — Aptos Little League’s 10s All-Star Noah Marcus hit the ball to left side of the infield and sprinted to first base with two out in the top of the sixth, which sent Ryder Bergh home from third base with the apparent tying run.\n\nThe throw across the diamond pulled Willow Glen’s first baseman off the bag, and he attempted a swipe tag in vain as Marcus sped past him and stepped on first base.\n\nFrom his vantage point at home plate, Bergh saw his teammate reach base safely. So did Aptos’ coaching staff and teammates, and their fans. The first base umpire saw otherwise and called Marcus out on the play. Game over.\n\nAptos, the District 39 champion, suffered a heartbreaking and controversial, 7-6 loss to D-12 champ Willow Glen at De Anza Park on Sunday to drop from the unbeaten ranks in the Section 5 Tournament.\n\nManager John Bergh attempted to protest the ruling, but game officials told him the decision was made correctly. End of conversation.\n\nWhile Aptos players initially were outraged by the ruling, they followed their coaches’ leads, bit their tongues, and walked off the field with class. They vowed to fight another day.\n\n“I don’t think he go touched,” said Ryder Bergh, of the final play of the game. “I was at home plate when I saw it. I had a perfect angle. I mean, I don’t think it was even close. We have a bunch of videos, too. I’m sure he dodged it.\n\n“I’m not mad we lost, I just don’t like the call. But, we’re gonna be back and we’re going to win three times in a row.”\n\nAptos plays host Sunnyvale, the D-44 champ, in the consolation bracket final on Monday at 5:30 p.m. The winner advances to Tuesday’s final against unbeaten Willow Glen, and the loser is eliminated.\n\nWillow Glen has to lose twice to be eliminated. If it loses Tuesday, the finalists will play again Wednesday evening.\n\nSunnyvale eliminated Santa Teresa 9-6 in consolation action Sunday.\n\n“He said he saw him tag him,” said John Bergh, of his post-game meeting with the first-base umpire, which helped set up his post-game speech to his players. “That’s baseball and that’s life. It’s all about getting back up and moving forward. Sometimes you get hit hard, and, sometimes, it’s all about that next step. A life lesson through sports.”\n\nNeedless to say, Willow Glen was happy to escape with the victory. It will enjoy Monday off before returning to the diamond for Tuesday’s 5:30 p.m. championship.\n\n“We very much agreed with it,” said Willow Glen manager Brett Rahn. “These kids have been working hard; they’ve put in a lot of work, and they’re really good. They pick each other up every play, every at-bat, so it’s awesome.”\n\nWillow Glen rallied from a 3-0 deficit with a six-run second inning. It produced the decisive run in bottom of the third, when Bodie Cross doubled, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on a force out at second base, which allow Jackson Stefani to reach base on a fielder’s choice.\n\nAptos had runners in scoring position all six innings. Lincoln Cope two hits, three stolen bases, one RBI, and scored twice. Leadoff hitter Ashton Miller singles and scored a run and drew two walks. Bergh had two hits, one walk, and scored a run. Lucas Kish had a single and scored a run, and Kaiden Wang drew a walk and scored a run.\n\nAptos stranded six runners over the final three innings, and 10 total.\n\nSeven players scored for Willow Glen. Juan Mercado-Lopez, James Cardenas and Jackson Hewko hit RBI singles in the second inning for Willow Glen.\n\nFox Braley started on the mound for Aptos and pitched 1 1/3 innings. Deken Espinoza threw 3 1/3 innings of relief, and Cope closed out the game.\n\nHudson Gall started and pitched two innings for Willow Glen. Caleb Hernandez came on in relief and pitched two-plus innings, and Isaac Rojas threw the final two innings.\n\nTHE SCORE\n\nWillow Glen 7, Aptos 6\n\nUp next: Section 5 Tournament elimination game, Aptos vs. Sunnyvale\n\nWhen: Monday, 5:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: De Anza Park, Sunnyvale"
