        "text": "From now until preseason camp starts in August, Land-Grant Holy Land will be writing articles around a different theme every week. This week is all about Ohio State heroes. Whether they are the biggest names in Buckeye athletic history or underappreciated icons, perhaps even players who made major impacts off the field. You can catch up on all of the Theme Week content here and all of our ”Buckeye Heroes” articles here.\n\nFor Buckeye Heroes week here at Land-Grant Holy Land, I wanted to take a slightly different approach. Instead of just talking about one man’s career in Columbus, I wanted to look at the entire history of the program.\n\nSo, what better than a super controversial Mount Rushmore?\n\nOn the bright side, this won’t cause nearly as much controversy as a football Mount Rushmore, which is basically impossible to do. For basketball, there is likely eight to nine guys that you could argue should be on here, but I am going to make the case for the four that I believe stand out above the rest.\n\nJerry Lucas (1959-1962)\n\nWhen talking about Ohio State men’s basketball history, the conversation starts and ends with Jerry Lucas.\n\nLucas was the 1961 and 1962 AP Oscar Robertson Player of the Year and led the Buckeyes to the school’s only national championship in 1960. He has 1,990 career points and a school-record 1,411 career rebounds. He was a First Team All-American all three years he spent at Ohio State and is true basketball royalty in Columbus.\n\nLucas went 78-6 as a Buckeye.\n\nJim Jackson (1989-1992)\n\nJim Jackson is one of the top names associated with the program — and with good reason. Jackson was the 1990 and 1991 Big Ten Player of the Year and the 1991 National Player of the Year. He has 1,785 career points, which is ranked seventh all-time for Ohio State.\n\nHe was also a consensus First Team All-American in 1991 and 1992.\n\nEvan Turner (2007-2010)\n\nTurner is a guy that I am not sure we fully appreciate how good he was as a Buckeye. He was the 2010 Big Ten and National Player of the Year and led the team in scoring, rebounds, assists, and steals during his sophomore and junior seasons.\n\nTurner averaged 15.0 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game in 101 total games as a Buckeye, and was the model of consistency during his three years in Columbus.\n\nDennis Hopson (1983-1987)\n\nThe fourth spot can go to a couple of guys, so we might as well just put the program’s all-time leading scorer… for now (Bruce Thornton could have something to say about that over the next two seasons).\n\nHopson was the 1987 Big Ten Player of the Year and is one of only two Ohio State players to eclipse the 2,000-point mark, scoring 2,096 points en route to being the all-time leading scorer. He also holds the single-season scoring record with 958 points in 1987.\n\nHonorable mention\n\nClark Kellogg (1980-1982)\n\nSconnie Penn (1998-2000)\n\nMichael Redd (1997-2000)\n\nHerb Williams (1977-1981)\n\nJohn Havlicek (1959-1962)\n\nRobin Freeman (1953-1956)\n\nBest one-and-dones\n\nGreg Oden\n\nMike Conley\n\nD’Angelo Russell\n\nMalaki Branham\n\nBrice Sensabaugh"
