        "text": "Fast forward 15 years, and Stoudamire is now the new head coach at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, his second Division I head coaching job after being at the helm of Pacific University from 2016 to 2021. “After playing for the Spurs, I didn’t feel it anymore. I had always said I wasn’t built to be a 12th man. I didn’t have a plan, didn’t know what I wanted to do,” Stoudamire told Legends of Basketball Magazine in September as he prepared for the upcoming NCAA season. He spent some time as a studio analyst at NBA-TV in Atlanta before returning to Houston and meeting with John Lucas. “He put confidence back in me. That’s what he does. He told me: ‘Don’t run from it. Tell your story where it is. Just own it and move on. After that, what can people say?’” “I owe him a lot. He taught me to be myself again,” Stoudamire said of Lucas. “I built myself back up.”\n\nDel Harris on Peter Vecsey: I want to begin by saying I first met Peter almost 50 years ago when he brought a group of good players from New York City’s Rucker Park, including Tiny Archibald, to the Dominican Republic to play against the DR national team to help prepare them for the Central American Championships. I had contacts in the DR and they asked if Tom Nissalke and I could bring some Rockets during this off-season time to play as well. They paid money in DR pesos, but that is another story. It was a good thing to do for everyone and DR won the championship. That was all good. The Rockets were in receivership when Tom asked me to come there with him from the (ABA’s) Utah Stars. We had a great first year because we traded two future first-round picks (1977, ’78) for Moses Malone at the start of the season. He had been with us in the short time we were at the Stars. Getting what would become an all-time great was not the only boost — we drafted John Lucas in our first round, giving us a great feeder for the big guy and we had very good players who were excellent shooters all around with them. We lost in the 1977 Eastern Conference finals in six to Philadelphia with Dr. J (Julius Erving), George McGinnis, Bobby Jones, Doug Collins and others. Tom was named the 1977 NBA Coach of the Year.\n\nKelly Iko: I’ve often said Lucas is grandfathered into the organization, and I still believe that. He commands a great deal of respect from players and front-office executives alike and does a good job of maximizing his role. Even if Udoka goes a different direction with his official coaching staff, I could see Lucas remaining with the organization in some capacity, perhaps in a role akin to a front-office liaison."
