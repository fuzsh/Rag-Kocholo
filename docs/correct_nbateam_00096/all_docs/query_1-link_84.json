        "text": "Free agent point guard John Lucas III has reached an agreement to join the Utah Jazz, his agent told The Salt Lake Tribune. The Jazz had actively courted Lucas for more than a week, flying him to Orlando during summer league, where he met with coach Tyrone Corbin and Jazz executives. He will become the second point guard on the roster, behind rookie Trey Burke.\n\nFree-agent guard John Lucas III met with Utah Jazz executives on Monday in Orlando, but the two sides have not reached a deal. “John has started the process of meeting with teams who have an interest in him,” Lucas’ agent, Bernie Lee, told USA TODAY Sports in a text message. “He has his next meeting set for tomorrow back home in Houston. John hopes to make a decision by the end of the week.”"
