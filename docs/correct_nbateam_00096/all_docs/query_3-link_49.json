        "text": "Fantasy football draft season is here. If you haven’t done so already, it’s time to start your draft prep. One of the most useful weapons to have in your draft day arsenal is fantasy football tiers. With a tier-based approach, you can see how each player stacks up at his respective position. Tiers are slightly different from fantasy football rankings because it’s not just a straight list of players. These groupings allow for a more flexible approach to drafting that you can ultimately build into your draft board.\n\nOver the next few days, I’m going to go position-by-position and give you my tiers for 2024 fantasy football drafts. We’ll kick things off today with quarterback fantasy football tiers. Of course, don’t forget that you can check out all of our fantasy football rankings and fantasy football projections.\n\nRankings are included as part of our fantasy football subscriptions. Along with rankings and projections, you’ll also get access to our Fantasy Football Game Plan Draft Guide and much more with an FTN Fantasy+ subscription.\n\nTier 1 – Elite\n\nJosh Allen\n\nJalen Hurts\n\nLamar Jackson\n\nPatrick Mahomes\n\nHere you have the cream of the crop. Allen, Hurts and Jackson are all elite runners who are more than capable of putting up numbers with their arms. Mahomes is no slouch in the run game, but he offers an enormous ceiling as a passer\n\nAll four players are more than capable of putting up monster numbers yet again this year, but there’s a problem. They’re going so early in drafts, that they’re essentially priced out of most draft boards. Don’t get me wrong. They’re all extremely valuable, but you’ll be able to construct a more balanced roster by waiting at the position. I discuss this concept even further in the Roadmap fantasy draft strategy article in my Game Plan draft guide.\n\nTier 2 – Borderline Elite\n\nC.J. Stroud\n\nAnthony Richardson\n\nJoe Burrow\n\nIt wouldn’t be at all shocking if any of these three players ended up finishing as the No. 1 option in 2023. Stroud was a massive surprise last year and the Texans only got better in the offseason with the additions of Stefon Diggs and Joe Mixon. It’s aggressive to have Richardson up here, but he averaged over 26 fantasy points per game in his two healthy starts last season. Likewise, Burrow is coming back from injury but has already shown the ability to put up borderline elite numbers.\n\nTier 3a – High-Ceiling QB1s\n\nKyler Murray\n\nJordan Love\n\nTua Tagovailoa\n\nThis third group really needs to be subdivided into two sub tiers, as the next five quarterbacks are not all cut from the same cloth. This trio comes with a higher ceiling but also have more volatility. Murray flashed high upside after returning from injury last season. He also gets Marvin Harrison Jr. in the mix. Love played near perfect football over the final two months of the season last year. And Tagovailoa is at the helm of one of the most explosive offenses in the league.\n\nTier 3b – High-Floor QB1s\n\nDak Prescott\n\nBrock Purdy\n\nThis group isn’t as sexy as the first subset of Tier 3, but both come with higher fantasy floors. Prescott is coming of a league-leading 36 touchdowns last season. Meanwhile, Purdy showed no ill effects from the elbow injury and set a 49ers franchise record for passing yards.\n\nTier 4a – Late-Round Safe Options\n\nJared Goff\n\nMatthew Stafford\n\nKirk Cousins\n\nAaron Rodgers\n\nIf you want to execute the “safe and upside” late-round approach in your drafts where you take one safe option and one upside option, this is your safe tier. These guys may not all be available at the end of your drafts, but it’s extremely likely that at least one will be. These four signal callers may not have the highest ceilings, but their floors make them appealing options.\n\nTier 4b – Late-Round Upside Options\n\nJayden Daniels\n\nJustin Herbert\n\nCaleb Williams\n\nTrevor Lawrence\n\nThis is the group to pair with your safe option. These four players do not come with a high floor, but each of them has the potential to give you a massive return on investment if they hit this year. If you’re going to use the safe-and-upside strategy in your 1QB leagues, you’ll want to draft one player from the safe tier and one from the upside tier. Doing so will give you the opportunity to swing for the fences on upside while not completely striking out if you miss. The safe option won’t win you your league, but he will tide you over while you work the waiver wire.\n\nTier 5a – Superflex Targets\n\nDeshaun Watson\n\nWill Levis\n\nJ.J. McCarthy\n\nDrake Maye\n\nRussell Wilson\n\nBo Nix\n\nThese guys aren’t likely to be drafted in 1QB leagues, but they’re all in consideration in 2QB and superflex formats. This is a high ceiling group of players, yes, but it’s too aggressive to consider them as late-round options in 1QB leagues with 12-or-fewer teams.\n\nTier 5b – Superflex Avoids\n\nBaker Mayfield\n\nGeno Smith\n\nDerek Carr\n\nDaniel Jones\n\nBryce Young\n\nGardner Minshew\n\nThis group offers a much lower ceiling or comes with significantly more questions than the players in 5a. As such, it’s a good idea to avoid them as your third quarterback option in a superflex or 2QB format.\n\nTier 6 – Watch List\n\nJustin Fields\n\nAidan O’Connell\n\nMichael Penix Jr.\n\nJacoby Brissett\n\nSam Darnold\n\nSam Howell\n\nJake Browning\n\nJarrett Stidham\n\nDrew Lock\n\nThese guys aren’t going to be drafted in regular-sized leagues, but you should keep your eye on them."
