        "text": "John Lucas III\n\nJohn Lucas III is averaging 4.8 points and 4.2 assists in six games with the Detroit Pistons.\n\n(AP File Photo)\n\nAUBURN HILLS - The Detroit Pistons have signed John Lucas III to another 10-day contract.\n\nThe Pistons originally signed the veteran point guard to a 10-day deal Feb. 2 after losing Brandon Jennings for the season because of a torn left Achilles last month.\n\nIn six games, Lucas has averaged 4.8 points, 4.2 assists and shot 42.9 percent - including 55.6 percent on 3-pointers - while playing almost 13 minutes per game.\n\nHe has a total of three turnovers in six games.\n\nLucas' best showing was Feb. 4 in a 114-109 loss at Indiana, where he had 10 points and six assists. Lucas had nine points and six assists in Wednesday's 104-87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe Pistons are Lucas' fifth team in seven NBA seasons.\n\nThe 5-foot-11 Lucas came to Detroit after spending the season in the Chinese Basketball Association, where he averaged 26.6 points, 7.1 assists, 4.7 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 43.5 minutes in 26 games.\n\nSince the Pistons signed Lucas, rookie Spencer Dinwiddie - the third point guard on their roster - has played in three of six games."
