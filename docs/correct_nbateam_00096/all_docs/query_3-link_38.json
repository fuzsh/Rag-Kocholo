        "text": "BISMARCK — Isaiah Schafer came out firing early.\n\nBut Wylee Delorme and Deng Deng led the charge as Class A-B battled back and posted a 97-81 win over Class AA in the opening game of the Lions All-Star basketball series on Monday night at Bismarck High's Karlgaard Gymnasium.\n\nSchafer hit five 3-pointers in the first half, including four in the opening seven minutes to help the big-school all-stars open up a quick 11-point lead at 26-15.\n\nDelorme, who led Devils Lake to a state title, and Deng, the North Dakota Mr. Basketball winner, combined for 35 points to lead a comeback win.\n\n“They’ve got a countless amount of all-staters and so do we, so we knew that obviously if they went on a 10-point run, then it’s basketball,” said Deng, the Four Winds-Minnewaukan standout headed to North Dakota to play football. “We had to stay level-headed and just keep working. We kept cutting the lead down and down and once we got the lead, we didn’t give it back.”\n\nClass A-B ended the first half on a 9-4 run, with Deng hitting a 3-pointer and a running jumper and a free throw during that stretch and Delorme closing the half with a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nThe second half was all A-B, as the small-school all-stars outscored AA 48-37 to pull away.\n\n“We were just getting offensive rebounds, playing team ball and defending the rim,” Delorme said. “Our coach emphasized our playing as a team and not doing one-on-one stuff and if we played as a team, we were going to get a ‘W’ tonight.”\n\nA-B got the job done by spreading the ball around. Eleven different players scored, with three — Delorme (20), Deng (15) and Bowman County’s Bishop Duffield (13) — in double digits.\n\nA 9-0 AA run trimmed a 12-point deficit to 60-57 on a Ryan Larson basket with 15:04 to go. But A-B answered with a 22-5 burst to stretch the lead to 20 at 82-62 with 7:15 remaining.\n\nDeng capped a 9-0 run with a big dunk with 2:51 on the clock, putting an exclamation point on the big second half, stretching the lead to 95-70.\n\n“It’s a great feeling,” Deng said. “You know, we could just do so much – we could shoot the lights out, you saw the alley-oop dunks. It’s just crazy hype being a part of this environment. Even when you’re on the bench, you just get to witness some amazing players go at it. I’m truly grateful to be a part of this team.”\n\n“It’s very fun,” Delorme said. “Just working together.”\n\nCentury’s Schafer led AA with 22 points, 17 of them in the first half. Erick Paye of Grand Forks Central and West Fargo’s Tony Leal finished with 12 apiece and Lucas Kupfer of Legacy added 11.\n\nHolding Schafer to one second-half three and five points after the break was a key.\n\n“We couldn’t let him get hot in the second half. We had to stop him. We knew if we could stop him, we were going to make a run,” Delorme said.\n\n“We focused more on keeping Schafer off the three and keeping them all off the three,” Deng said. “We got a little more physical and rebounded on both ends of the floor.”\n\nAtticus Wilkinson of Shiloh Christian finished with nine points, Kai Thomas of Williston Trinity Christian and Javin Friesz of Flasher each had eight and Grafton's Braylon Baldwin contributed eight for A-B.\n\nThe teams meet again on Tuesday night at Fargo South."
