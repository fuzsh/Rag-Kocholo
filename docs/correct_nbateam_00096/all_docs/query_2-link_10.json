        "text": "After China, John Lucas III feels at home with Pistons\n\nJohn Lucas III is quick to emphasize he's not knocking the Utah Jazz.\n\nHe was treated well by the organization last season.\n\nIt's just that after signing a two-year deal in the summer of 2013, he found himself in the Jazz's flex offense, a system in which point guards are expected to set almost as many picks as the other players in the lineup.\n\nFormer Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, who won more than 1,200 games, was a disciple of the offense, and his successor, Tyrone Corbin, played under Sloan for years so there were similarities when he took over in the 2010-11 season.\n\nBut Lucas is a pick-and-roll point guard, and he chuckles now at the thought of his diminutive 5-foot-11, 166-pound frame setting multiple picks.\n\nThe veteran point guard, signed to a 10-day contract with the Detroit Pistons last week, said he feels right at home in Stan Van Gundy's system and is glad to be back in the NBA after almost completing an entire season in the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\n\"The Pistons are telling me to be who I am, don't be nothing else,\" Lucas told the Free Press last week. \"The Jazz were just all about a half-court set offense. It wasn't made for me.\n\n\"I was doing more screening than I was coming off ball screens, and I'm a ball-screen player. I was putting screens on (centers) and (power forwards) and that's the way the offense ran. It's been like that since Jerry Sloan was there.\"\n\nWell-traveled road\n\nIt took Lucas, 32, a few years to show his worth after a standout career at Oklahoma State. He wasn't selected in the 2005 draft and spent the next years playing in the NBA Development League, playing overseas, performing brief stints with the Houston Rockets and getting brief looks from other NBA teams.\n\nHe finally clicked with the Bulls in 2011-12 and with the Raptors in 2012-13.\n\nA free agent in the summer of 2013, he signed with the Jazz. He was expected to be a solid backup and serve as a mentor to first-round pick and former Michigan star Trey Burke.\n\nHe struggled on the floor, but the organization thought highly of Lucas' influence on Burke.\n\nBut he was traded twice in three months last off-season with the Boston Celtics waiving him in September.\n\nHe signed with the Washington Wizards, but was cut after only four days.\n\nOff to China\n\nLucas passed on a chance to sign with Los Angeles Lakers and instead accepted an offer to join the Fujian Sturgeons of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nHe was a standout, averaging 26.6 points and 7.1 assists in 43 minutes per game over 26 outings.\n\nBut it was more than just playing basketball. After a season of discomfort with the Jazz, he was back to playing his style.\n\nAnd he rediscovered his joy for the game.\n\n\"I'm glad I went to China,\" he told reporters last week. \"Last year was difficult for me. I had to go back and fall in love with the game, and that's what I did in China. I always loved the game, but it wasn't me. I kind of lost my swag.\n\n\"I lost who I was out there when I was with the Bulls and Toronto. When I was in Utah, it was a different style, a different type of play.\"\n\nOpportunity knocks\n\nA chance to return to the NBA opened when the Pistons lost Brandon Jennings for the season with a ruptured left Achilles tendon.\n\nAfter exploring the trade market for a third point guard to join D.J. Augustin and Spencer Dinwiddie, the Pistons settled on Lucas. His Chinese club released him with one game remaining in the CBA schedule and he signed his first 10-day contract Feb. 1.\n\n\"We wanted a guy with NBA experience, which he has, to complement what we've already got,\" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. \"We wanted a high-energy guy who would push the ball up and down the floor and really play and attack in the pick-and-rolls. And that's what John is.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Lucas to fit in.\n\nHe was more effective than Augustin in just his second game â€” Wednesday night's loss at Indiana. In 16 minutes, he scored 10 points on 4-for-6 shooting. He added six assists.\n\n\"Everybody's going to eat because of the way it is,\" Lucas said of Van Gundy's system. \"When somebody's pounding it, that's when the defense is going to get set up. As long as that ball's moving, everybody's going to be able to get shots, everybody's going to eat.\n\n\"That's why San Antonio is successful and been good for so many years. You watch the way that ball moves, you can't outrun that basketball and they proved that last year against the Heat.\"\n\nVan Gundy has said Lucas can expect another 10-day deal this week. At the end of the second deal, the Pistons would have to sign him for the rest of the season to retain Lucas.\n\nHe is hopeful.\n\n\"It feels like I've been with this team for the whole year and just fitting right in,\" Lucas said. \"The offense fits me the way Coach wants me to come in and play, it fits who I am as a basketball player, so I feel very comfortable. I have a great group of guys that have accepted me already and so I feel good.\n\n\"This is where I belong, in the NBA. It just felt good to be back out there.\"\n\nContact Vince Ellis: vellis@freepress.com.
