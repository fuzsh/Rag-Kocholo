        "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. – Four outstanding Tar Heel student-athletes – a national champion women's tennis player, a four-time All-ACC men's golfer, a gold glove and home run slugging centerfielder and the most prolific rebounder in NCAA men's basketball in the last 60 seasons – are the 2023-24 winners of the Patterson Medal, the most prestigious athletics award given at the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe 101st class of Patterson Medal honorees includes Armando Bacot (men's basketball), a graduate student from Richmond, Va.; Fiona Crawley (women's tennis), a senior from San Antonio, Texas; Austin Greaser, a graduate student from Vandalia, Ohio, the first men's golfer to win a Patterson Medal; and Vance Honeycutt (baseball), a junior from Salisbury, N.C.\n\nPatterson Medals are awarded primarily on career athletic accomplishments. Dr. Joseph Patterson first presented the medal in 1924 to honor the memory of his brother, John Durand Patterson.\n\nRecipients must have competed in at least three seasons for the Tar Heels and concluded their collegiate eligibility. Sportsmanship and leadership are also considered in selecting the awards.\n\nThis year's recipients combined to compete in 17 seasons for the Tar Heels, including five by Bacot and Greaser due to extra seasons of eligibility because of Covid-19.\n\nBacot broke Carolina's all-time records for rebounds (1,715), double-doubles (87) and offensive rebounds (593), is UNC's second-leading scorer (2,347 points), is one of two Tar Heels to average a career double-double in scoring and rebounding in the last 50 years and became the fourth player named Carolina's Most Valuable Player three times with Lennie Rosenbluth, Billy Cunningham and Tyler Hansbrough.\n\nThe 33rd men's basketball player to win a Patterson Medal, Bacot shattered UNC's single-season rebound record with 511 in 2021-22, when he also tied David Robinson's NCAA record for double-doubles with 31. He was named Most Outstanding Player in the East Regional, became the first player in NCAA Tournament history to record double-doubles in all six games in one season and grabbed 22 rebounds to lead the Tar Heels to a win over Duke in the national semifinals in the first-ever meeting between UNC and the Blue Devils in NCAA Tournament history. He holds UNC records for the most rebounds in the Elite 8, national semifinal and championship games and tied Tim Duncan and Hakeem Olajuwon's NCAA Tournament record with seven consecutive double-doubles.\n\nBacot earned first-team All-ACC and All-America honors in 2022, 2023 and 2024. He finished his career tied with Duncan for the most double-doubles in ACC history and second most in NCAA history. He played in three wins at Duke and is No. 2 in the ACC and No. 8 in NCAA history in career rebounds.\n\n\"I can't think of a better person to win the Patterson Medal than Armando,\" says head coach Hubert Davis. \"I tell our guys all the time that to be a UNC men's basketball player you have to be elite in three areas – on the court, off the court and in the classroom. Armando checked all three boxes throughout his career, and I'm so happy he's being celebrated and recognized for that.\"\n\nCrawley led the Tar Heels to their first NCAA championship in 2023, winning ACC and National Player-of-the-Year honors from Honda and the ITA.\n\nShe won 141 matches, fourth most by a Tar Heel, made All-ACC in each of her four seasons and was a four-time All-America. She was first-team All-America in singles in each of her last three seasons and the past two seasons in doubles. In 2023, she won the NCAA doubles title with Carson Tanguilig. Crawley also won the 2022 ITA Fall Championship and Women's All-America championship and the 2021 ITA Fall Doubles with Elizabeth Scotty.\n\nCrawley, who played in the 2023 U.S. Open main draw in New York, led the Tar Heels to 2021 and 2024 ACC titles and three consecutive ITA National Team Indoor Championships. She won a Hurd Award in 2024, a $100,000 grant from the Universal Tennis Foundation that assists young players transition to a professional career.\n\n\"The Patterson Award winner is an incredible honor, which Fiona earned as one of the best tennis players in the country, but off the court, she is an even better person and teammate,\" says UNC head coach Brian Kalbas, who has coached four Patterson Medal winners, all in the last 10 seasons. \"We are all so proud of Fiona and her accomplishments, and we are grateful for everything she did to elevate Carolina tennis.\"\n\nGreaser represented the United States in several international competitions, including the 2023 Walker Cup, won two NCAA regionals and led the men's golf team to the best four-year span in program history. He contributed to 19 tournament team victories, the most by any Tar Heel, including wins against top national fields at the Stephens Cup, East Lake Cup, Ben Hogan Collegiate Invitational, Valspar Collegiate Invitational, Calusa Cup, Amer Ari Invitational, Hayt Collegiate, Olympia Fields/Fighting Illini Invitational and the 2024 ACC Championship.\n\nHe finished his career averaging 71.04 strokes per round over 52 tournaments, the second-lowest average in UNC history among players with 100 or more rounds. He shot a combined 34 strokes below par in 156 rounds, one of only two Tar Heels to shoot below par in at least 100 rounds.\n\nHe was runner-up in the 2021 U.S. Amateur, won the 2022 Western Amateur (one of the amateur majors), and was a three-time collegiate medalist, twice making birdies on the final hole to win, including a 30-foot birdie to win the 2024 NCAA Chapel Hill Regional. He also had 14 top-five and 21 top-10 collegiate finishes.\n\nGreaser led UNC to top-five finishes (T5, T5, T3 and T5) in each of the last four NCAA Championships, something no other program in the nation accomplished, and the first time an ACC team did that since 1971. He earned second-team All-America honors in 2024, was a Haskins Award finalist for National Player of the Year this spring and joined Dustin Bray as the only Tar Heels to earn All-ACC accolades four times.\n\n\"This is an incredible honor for Austin made even more special as the first-ever men's golf recipient of the Patterson Medal,\" says head coach Andrew DiBitetto. \"Austin earned this prestigious award as his impact on our program was significant. Austin produced on the course from day one throughout his five years, and he helped change our culture with his character, determination, resiliency, leadership and work ethic. It's hard to find someone more committed to improvement and the process of becoming the best version of himself.\"\n\nHoneycutt became one of the top five-tool players in college baseball, displaying the hitting, power, speed, defense and arm that earned him multiple first-team All-America honors as a junior in 2024. The centerfielder twice broke UNC's single-season record for home runs (25 in as a freshman in 2022 and 28 in 2024) and is the Tar Heels' career home run king with 65, fourth most in ACC history.\n\nIn 2024, he became the first Diamond Heel ever to earn first-team All-America honors as a player and first-team Academic All-America honors. He became the first player to win ACC Defensive Player-of-the Year honors for a second time and won an ABCA/Rawlings Gold glove.\n\nHe leads UNC with seven multi-home run games, is one of two Tar Heels with homers in five consecutive games, scored the fourth-most runs, has the fifth-most total bases, sixth-most steals and is 10th in runs batted in. He is the only Power 5 conference player ever with at least 60 career home runs and 70 stolen bases.\n\nHoneycutt helped UNC win the 2022 ACC Tournament and 2024 regular-season title. He holds the UNC record with 10 homers in NCAA Tournament play, had two walk-off hits in the 2024 NCAA Tournament and led Carolina to the College World Series, where UNC tied for fifth.\n\n\"Vance is an extraordinary player and exceptional young man,\" says head coach Scott Forbes. \"He has been a leader in our program for three years and led us to the College World Series this year. He leads by example and plays the game the right way. Vance has been a great representative of our baseball program and university on the field and in the community. He is the embodiment of a student-athlete and takes pride in doing everything like a champion.\"\n\nHoneycutt is the 17th baseball player to win a Patterson Medal, the first since Dustin Ackley in 2009.\n\nPatterson Medal Winners\n\n1924— Monk McDonald (men's basketball, football, baseball)\n\n1925— M.D. Bonner (football)\n\n1926— Jack Cobb (men's basketball)\n\n1927— Ad Warren (football, boxing, wrestling)\n\n1928— Galen Elliott (men's track and field)\n\n1929— Henry Satterfield (men's basketball)\n\n1930— Ray Farris Sr. (football, boxing, baseball)\n\n1931— Henry House (football, baseball)\n\n1932— Staton McIver (football)\n\n1933— Stuart Chandler (football)\n\n1934— Virgil Weathers (men's basketball)\n\n1935— Harry Williamson (men's track and field)\n\n1936— Harry Montgomery (football)\n\n1937— R.D.
