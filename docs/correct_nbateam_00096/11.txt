HOUSTON (AP) _ The agent for former Oklahoma State basketball player John Lucas the III says Lucas is planning to sign with the Houston Rockets.

Lucas played for Houston under two separate ten-day contracts last season as a rookie. He also spent time with the Tulsa 66ers of the NBDL.

Agent David Falk says Lucas and the team have ``an agreement in principle with a few nuances to work out.''

Lucas is the son of former Rocket John Lucas Junior and was the Big 12 player of the year in 2004 while at OSU.
