Ramsey Signing Pickett Dies

Former Town wing half Reg Pickett has died at the age of 85 at a nursing home in Rowlands Castle, Hampshire.

Pickett was signed from Portsmouth, with whom he had won the First Division in 1950, for Â£5,000 by Sir Alf Ramsey in 1957 and was made captain. He went on to make 148 appearances for the Blues, scoring four times.

Born in Bareilly in India, Pickett appeared in 26 games in the 1960/61 campaign in which Town won the Second Division but on only three occasions the following year when Town won the Football League championship for the only time in their history.

He left Town to join Stevenage in June 1963 and had been with Weybridge before joining Pompey.

R.I.P. Reg .A hard tackling no.4. My lasting memory,however,is when we lost at home to Man.Utd 2-7.! Yes, it happened too back in the day.Reg tries to trap the ball and clear on our 6 yard line but the ball comes off his foot too Dennis Law,who looked at Reg,said thanks and slammed it in the net....

I remember him well as a hard right half who could break up play and get an attack rolling. In the days when the practise pitch was behind the West Stand (now Britannia) the fans (schoolboys) had full access and were allowed to watch practise sessions close up. I was standing behind the goal at the Churchman's end (which didn't have a net) and stopped one of his shots with my hand which sprained my wrist! Fortunately it wasn't Ted Phillips!

Thanks for your contributions and rest in peace Reg.

Great memory Teds Left Foot but think you may have your memory slightly wrong there as Reg left Ipswich in June 1963 and the Man U 2-7 game was Sept 1963, Dennis Law did get his hatrick though lol.

Not trying to be clever it was 50 odd years ago!!! so all of us are entitled to a little memory lapse........sorry where am I?

Good memory rabbit. I was at that game and recall that Law was dirty and brilliant! Jackie Milburn was our new manager.
