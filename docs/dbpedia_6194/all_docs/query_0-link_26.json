His position is well deserved. He began his career in old Indian Territory as a teacher, and he accordingly knows not only the law but the people with whom he has had his professional and civic associations. He has been in active practice in the territory and state for more than fifteen years.\n\nHe comes of a prominent old family of Tennessee, in which state at Byrdstown in Pickett County he was born March 15, 1875. There is extant a book known as \"The Footprints of the Huddleston Family,\" a lineage which includes the names of many men of more than ordinary prominence, and a specially noteworthy fact is that the family line is traced directly back to Alfred the Great of England. Mr. Huddleston's parents were Martin Van Buren and Mary (Richardson) Huddleston. His mother was a third cousin of Hon. James D. Richardson of Memphis, Tennessee, who resigned a position as member of Congress from Tennessee to accept the Masonic honor of grand commander of the Supreme Council of the Thirty-third Degree. Both Mr. Huddleston's parents were natives of Tennessee, and his mother resides at Byrdstown. Martin Van Buren Huddleston was born in 1932 and died in 1901. In 1895 he came to the Stonewall District of Indian Territory, and lived there until his death. He was a farmer and stockman, but for some time back in Tennessee he conducted a considerable business in the buying of timber and rafting of logs down the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers to Nashville. During the war between the states he was for four years a private soldier in General Lee's army. In the family were two sons and six daughters, and all are still living except two of the daughters.\n\nCreed Taylor Huddleston spent the first nineteen years of his life at the old homestead in Tennessee, being reared as a farmer's son, and completing his early literary education in Mount Vernon Academy at Burrville, Tennessee. On leaving home to seek his fortune in the world he first went to Texas, spending one year at McKinney, Collins County, and he both attended and taught school while there. Coming to Indian Territory, he located at Stonewall, and for five years was one of the successful teachers, being in charge of a subscription school for a time and for one term in the Indian school department. In the meantime he continued his education, attending for a term or so the American Temperance University at Harriman, Tennessee. While teaching he also studied law and having familiarized himself with the fundamentals of jurisprudence and with methods of practice in Indian Territory he was admitted to the bar at Ardmore before the United States Court in 1899. His practice began in the same year and also on August 17, 1899, he married Miss Lena Willie Sehon. She was born at Monterey, Tennessee, a daughter of John F. Sehon, and she spent all her early years in her native state until her marriage. She and her husband returned to Indian Territory, but after a short time they went back to Tennessee where Mr. Huddleston entered the Law department of the Cumberland University at Lebanon, where he was graduated LL B with the class of 1901. He was also admitted to the bars of both Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nA graduate of one of the best law schools of the Middle West and with some considerable experience as a lawyer and man of affairs in Indian Territory, Mr. Huddleston took part in the opening of the Kiowa and Comanche Reservation in 1901, and was one of the early settlers and first lawyers to locate at Lawton, where he became a partner of Senator Gore and the latter's father, and they did considerable business as lawyers during the registration period in preparing papers for the homeseekers. Mr. Huddleston continued to practice in Lawton for two years, and then moved to Okemah where for the past twelve years he has enjoyed not only a large private practice as a lawyer but has made himself a factor in local business and civic affairs. At Okemah Mr. Huddleston owns five store buildings on Broadway, and has also put on the market what is known as the Huddleston Addition to the town. He has also invested much of his capital in farming land, and has altogether about eight hundred acres.\n\nHe is an active democrat, though he has not sought prominence in politics or as an office seeker. He is a lay leader in the Methodist Episcopal Church South, is a Thirty second Degree Scottish Rite and a Knight Templar Mason, having local affilations with Okemah Lodge No. 139, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, Okemah Chapter No. 61, Royal Arch Masons, and Indian Consistory at McAlester, and is also a member of India Temple of the Mystic Shrine at Oklahoma City. Other fraternities of which he is a member are the Woodmen of the World, the Modern Woodmen of America, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Knights of Pythias. Mr. and Mrs. Huddleston are the parents of two children: Lorena, born May 11, 1902, and Maggie Helen, born December 28, 1907.

This is Cordell Hull, whose service as Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944 broke all records for tenure of this post. One of the few living statesmen who was born in a log cabin, he has consented to have his decaying birthplace near Byrdstown, Tenn., converted into a national shrine.\n\nTennessee cut more of a national figure before the War Between the States than it did afterward, largely because the population of industrial states has increased faster. She gave three presidents to the nation, Jackson, Polk and Johnson. Only Virginia, Ohio and New York have given more. Massachusetts is tied with Tennessee at three, the two Adamses and Coolidge.\n\nIn the House and Senate for 24 years before entering the cabinet, Hull was the author of the original income tax law of 1913. He was Democratic national committee chairman in 1920. As Secretary of State he was the chief mover behind the Reciprocal Trade Relations Act of 1934. In 1945 his efforts for peace gained him the Nobel prize.\n\nBorn in 1871, Hull received serious backing for the presidency in 1940, but his age forbade. FDR himself was inclined to support him. He did not, however, need the presidency to attain secure fame.

He is one of the progressive and influential citizens of Knoxville and his high standing in the community clearly entitles him to specific recognition in this publication. Further consistency is given to such consideration by reason of the fact that he is a scion of one of the sterling pioneer families of Tennessee, John Wright, grandfather of the Judge, was a native of North Carolina and came to Tennessee in an early day, his wife having also been a native of North Carolina and both having been of staunch Irish lineage. The respective families were founded in America in the colonial epoch of our national history and each generation has given its quota of worthy and useful citizens. Rev. Absalom B. Wright, father of him to whom this sketch is dedicated, was born in Tennessee, on the 5th of November, 1826, and became a man of high intellectual attainments. In his earlier manhood he prepared himself for the practice of medicine. But following the calls of his conscience soon entered the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal church, in which he labored for many years, with consecrated zeal and with much distinction. He was one of the representative members of the clergy of his church and held various important pastorates, in his native state, where he ever retained a high place in popular confidence and esteem, and where he continued to reside until his death, as did also his noble wife, whose maiden name was Cynthia S. Progge and who likewise was a native of Tennessee. Of their five children three sons and one daughter are now living.\n\nJudge Will Dudley Wright was born in what was then Fentress but now Pickett county, Tennessee, on the 31st of July, 1864, and after availing himself of the advantages of the common schools he continued his studies in Rheatown Academy, at Rheatown, Greene county, and in Grant University at Athens, in which latter institution he was a member of the junior class of 1886. Owing to more than two years illness resulting from relapse of measles at the close of his junior year in the institution, he did not return and complete his senior year and take his A. B. degree. He soon afterward began reading law in his home along with his brother, T. Asbury Wright, now one of the leading members of the Knoxville Bar, and later he continued his technical studies for one year in the office of Messrs. Lindsay & Baker, each prominent attorneys of Huntsville, this state. He was admitted to the bar in November, 1888, and began the practice of his profession at Wartburg, Morgan county, Tennessee where he soon proved his powers and gained a substantial clientage. There he continued his labors in his profession until July, 1897, when there came distinguished recognition of his ability and sterling character, in that he was appointed United States attorney for the eastern district of Tennessee, under the administration of the lamented President McKinley. In August of that year he removed to the city of Knoxville, where he maintained his official headquarters during his two terms of effective service as United States attorney, and where he has continued to reside since his retirement from the position. He was reappointed United States attorney in 1901, by President Roosevelt, and he retired from office at the expiration of his second term in 1905.\n\nAfter leaving the office mentioned Judge Wright resumed the active work of his profession, with distinctive gain in prestige by reason of his able administration in the position of United States attorney, and in September, 1910, further official honors came to him, in his election to his present important incumbency, that of chancellor of the chancery court of the chancery division of Knox county, in which position his services have been marked by characteristic discrimination and judgment, broad and accurate knowledge of the law and successful administration in the furtherance of equity and justice.\n\nIn politics Judge Wright has given unwavering allegiance to the Republican party, and he is admirably fortified in his opinions concerning economic and governmental polity. In his civic attitude he is broad-minded and liberal and he takes a lively interest in all that touches the welfare of his home city and state. Prior to his removal to Knoxville he had served as clerk and master of the chancery court of Morgan county, from 1888 to 1893, and the experience thus gained has proved of great value to him in his present exacting office. Judge Wright is affiliated with the time-honored Masonic fraternity, in which he has received the degrees of the various York rite bodies, including those of the chivalric order, in which his affiliation is with Coeur de Lion Commandery, Knights Templars, in Knoxville; he also holds membership in the temple of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. He is identified with the Cherokee Country Club and was one of its organizers. He is also a member of the Cumberland Club which is one of the representative social organizations of Knoxville. Both he and his wife are zealous and valued members of the Second Presbyterian Church of Knoxville and in the same he holds the office of elder.\n\nIn the year 1897 was solemnized the marriage of Judge Wright to Miss Nellie Pitts Spears, who was born and reared in Marion county, this state, and who is a daughter of the late Colonel A. L. Spears, a representative citizen of Jasper, the judicial center of that county, and a valiant officer of the Federal army in the Civil war; his father, General James G. Spears, of Pikeville, Bledsoe county, was one of the honored pioneers of that section of the state and gained his military title brigadier general through distinguished services as an officer also in the Federal army in the late Civil war.\n\nJudge and Mrs. Wright became the parents of three children, two of whom are living, namely: Martha Cynthia, a daughter, and Will D. Jr., a son, each attractive and interesting children. [Source: A History of Tennessee and Tennesseans:..., Vol.7, By Will Thomas Hale, Dixon Lanier Merritt; 1913]"
