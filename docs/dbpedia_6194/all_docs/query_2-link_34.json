They have had years of teaching from the most influential teacher they will ever have...you. As you help them prepare to enter the world of formal education, we are here to guide you, support you and link arms with you on your journey into kindergarten.\n\nTo qualify for kindergarten, children must turn 5 on or before July 31."
