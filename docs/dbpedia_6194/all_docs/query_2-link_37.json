I felt like a veil was removed from my eyes. I wept and wept and wept. All that knowledge that had been accumulating throughout the years had sunk from my head to my heart through God's love.\"\n\nDianna Kvashina\n\n\"Carrie Pickett talks about not just knowing something in your head but experiencing first hand that God is good. God didn’t do this. He is a God of restoration, and it was His love that sustained me. Without His love there is no purpose or meaning to life. I decided to praise Him regardless.\"\n\nJohn Adams\n\n\"I knew I had a God-sized hole in my heart. I didn't understand it until I got a revelation of God's love for me in Carrie's first year class. The love of God invaded my whole heart. I felt like I was coming home from a war and being nurtured with such tender loving care and getting wrapped in this love blanket.\"\n\nYong Uhlig\n\nPrevious\n\nNext\n\nMeet Carrie Pickett\n\nWelcome to Life Foundations! My name is Carrie Pickett. I graduated from Charis Bible College in 1999 and moved to Russia to plant a Charis campus. While in Russia, I met my husband, Mike. Together we grew the Russian ministry to reach over ten Russian-speaking nations. After sixteen years in Russia, we felt led to relocate to Colorado, where I now serve as the Assistant Vice President of Charis Bible College and International Operations of Andrew Wommack Ministries. I also serve as Director of Charis Bible College Woodland Park and the Director of the Global Training School. It’s the desire of my heart to reach the world with the grace message and to see powerful ministers raised up with a Great Commission vision.\n\nGive\n\nLife Foundations is produced by Charis Bible College.
