        "text": "Descendants of Pickett Shiflett Sr.\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. Pickett Shiflett Sr. son of Stephen Shiflett and Elizabeth Powell, was born about 1775 in Orange Co., VA and died on 3 Sep 1849 in Elbert Co., GA about age 74.\n\nGeneral Notes for Pickett Shiflett Sr.\n\nSubmitted by: Larry Shifflett lfsofva@aol.com :\n\n7 November 1763, Mark Stowers and Hannah, his wife, sell 330 acres to John Powell, who is to marry Frances Stowers, daughter of Mark and Hannah Stowers. Land bounded by Henry Kendall.\n\n9 August 1768, John Powell and Frances, hs wife, sell the same 330 acres to James Powell.\n\n15 April 1770, James Powell to daughter, Ruth Bredden, 100 acres bounded by Henry Kendall and Stephen Shiflet.\n\n25 April 1771, James Powell to Stephen Shiflet, 100 acres.\n\n1787, Stephen Shiflett's daughter, Frances, marries Samuel Self in 1787.\n\n16 November 1795, Pickett Shifflet and Lewis G. Powell to John Miller 200 acres, part of the 330 acre tract of Mark Stowers, bounded by Samuel Self.\n\n1795, Pickett Shiflett marries Lucretia Powell in 1795, bondsman Francis Powell.\n\nApparently, John Powell, James Powell, Francis Powell and Stephen Shiflett's wife, Elizabeth, are all children of John and Ann Powell of Culpeper County.\n\nLewis G. Powell is the son of James Powell (1725-1776) and at James' death, chooses John Shiflett as his guardian.\n\nNow all this does not prove that Pickett Shiflett is the son of Stephen Shiflett, but it is highly probable, based on the circumstantial evidence of the land boundry of Henry Kendall and the fact that the land Pickett sells is part of the tract Mark Stowers sells to James Powell. This land, if not divided and sold in part as the tract of land that James Powell sells to Stephen Shiflett, at least borders other land of Stephen Shiflett. Because there is no deed to Pickett Shiflett, we could assume that he receives his part from the estate of Stephen Shiflett, dec'd. or at the death of his mother, Stephen's widow.\n\n16 Nov 1795, Pickitt Shifflet and Lewis G. Powell of Orange to John Miller of same\n\nOrange Co. Deed Book #21, pages 64 & 65\n\nThis Indenture made this 16th day of November one thousand seven hundred and ninety five, Between Pickitt Shifflet and Lewis G.

Powell lands, by the land said Miller bought of Sam'l Self and by Edward Brent's land being part of three hundred and thirty acres granted by Patton to Mark Stowers bearing date one thousand seven hundred and sixty two with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging rents, issues & profits unto the said John Miller his heirs and assigns forever and the said Pickett Shifflet and Lewis G.

Powell to John Miller was proved by the oaths of Robt. Miller, Philip Seal, and Jacob Swartswilder three of the witnesses thereto and ordered to be recorded.

Lewis Robert Shiflett (Pickett Sr.1) was born about 1809 in Elbert Co., GA and died on 15 Jun 1884 in DeKalb Co., GA about age 75.\n\nGeneral Notes for Lewis Robert Shiflett\n\n1850 United States Federal Census\n\nName:L.

Shiflett, Enumerasted 5 Jun 1880\n\n*Original burial was in the Mt. Zion Methodist Church cemetery in Hart County, Georgia. The graves in this cemetery had to be relocated when Hartwell Dam was constructed circa 1960. (info profided by member#47643006)\n\nThe birth and death dates listed on the tombstone may not be correct. They were put there many years later when the bodys were moved to the cemetery.\n\nU.S. Veterans Gravesites, ca.1775-2006\n\nName: Lewis Robert Shiflet\n\nService Info.: PVT CONFEDERATE STATES ARMY\n\nBirth Date: 18 Mar 1811\n\nDeath Date: 15 May 1880\n\nCemetery: MT Zion Church Cemetery\n\nCemetery Address: Hartwell, GA 30643\n\nPVT CO B 24 GA INF\n\nConfederate States Army\n\nFrom the book \"A Sketch and History of Our Ancestors by Bruce A. Howard\"\n\nI would also like to point out these discrepancies by those who have made obvious guesses. Lewis R. Shiflett was born in 1809 not 1811. He died on the 15th day of June 1884 not 1880. He did not die in Hart County and doubt he is buried in Hart County. He died in DeKalb County over 120 miles from his former home and in the month of June when it was hot. I somehow doubt his son carried him back to Hartwell to bury him. The Lewis Shiflett buried in Hart County is Lewis B. Shiflett, son of Powell Shiflett. His widow Mrs. Martha Shiflett continued to live on their home place in the southern part of the county and spent her remaining days there. The 1870 census shows she hired a man to work the farm and their former slaves who took their last name and are living all around them. She died of a heart attack in April 1880 and buried at old Mount Zion.\n\nLewis married Elizabeth Powell on 8 Feb 1838 in Elbert Co., GA.

She is living with daughters Sarah E., age 19, Nancy H., age 18, and Mary, age 2. It appears she and Lewis R. Shiflett are either divorced or separated. Lewis is listed in 1870 in Elbert County, family 53. I am not sure about Mary, age 2 living with Elizabeth in 1870. She must be a granddaughter.\n\nChildren from this marriage of Lewis Robert Shiflett and Elizabeth Powell were:\n\n+ 12 M i. Judge A.

Shiflett, age 27, born in AL\n\nKing David D Shiflett first enlisted in the Confederate Army in 1862. He joined on 22 Feb, 1862 in Crockett, Houston, Co., Texas. He was living with his wife and daughter. Muster roll reports that he enlisted for 12 months. In November of 1862 the muster roll reports that he was sick and that he was sent to Camp Nelson in Arkansas. In Jan./Feb. of 1863 he is listed as present and the must roll notes that he has not been paid since October of 1862. On June 10, 1863 he was captured at Providence, LA but he is listed as being in Providence and \"sick\" on a muster roll in 1864. According to records he was captured in Alton, IL. He then transferred to Camp Douglass in Chicago where one month before the Civil War ended, enlisted in the Union Army. According to these records, he stayed in for two months before being sent to Ft. Leavenworth Hospital. He never arrived. He was listed as deserted in July, but two telegraphs reveal that he was arrested in Ft. Scott, Kansas six days after he left for Ft. Leavenworth. From the records below, it is not clear if he was cleared to return to Ft. Leavenworth and never arrived or what happened to him after he was arrested. In October, the army again wrote that he was a deserter and that he had never been captured. I have yet to find a record of his making his way back to Texas, but by 1872 his wife had remarried. Below are details from scans of his military records.\n\nRe: KING DAVID SHIFLETT (GA - TX) New\n\nrhnelson (View posts) Posted: 25 Feb 2013 4:07PM\n\nShannon,\n\nThis past week while researching in Houston County, Texas, I found two records that show K.D.D.

Both Powell and Pickett's first name lead me to believe that there is a relationship to the Powells and Picketts in the same area of Virginia. I mean you don't just name your two boys Powell and Pickett out of the blue. There are books that state Stephen Powells wife was Lucretia Powell, but I know this for a fact it wasn't - it was Elizabeth. Stephen died and left his \"stuff\" to Elizabeth. You see her name around the Virginia area several times but never a mention of Pickett. Then she dies and suddenly out of the blue, up pops Pickett selling some land and then moving to GA. I can't prove it is the same land. It has to be close but I just don't know if it is the same land. Stephen's land is listed like - up to the fence post on old man bla bla's land around to the creek and the old Oak tree -!!!!! and when Picket sells his land it is listed differently. But he sells the land after Elizabeth dies and he and Powell go to Georgia. I know that John Powell and Ann Pickett are the parents of Elizabeth Powell Shiflet. Makes sense that she named her kids Powell and Pickett after her parents.\n\nAnyways, my grandfather was born William Joseph Shiflet. He went to work for the MKT Railroad in North Texas (Denison area). They kept giving him his paycheck with his name spelled Shiflett (two ts) So he just added two ts to his name. Then his son took German in High School and his German teacher told him he had left out the c in his name. So, my grandfather had little education and he said OK - and added the c - so it became Schiflett. Any person you see with the named spelled that way is most likely a relative of mine. All of my grandfather's siblings said he was nuts and kept the name Shiflet. I love that story.

She was a pillar, certainly among the public relations professionals throughout the Texas Medical Center who were fortunate to work with her on countless projects,\" said Jane Brust, who led media relations efforts at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the UT Health Science Center for 23 years before moving on to become associate vice president of health sciences public relations and marketing at the University of Southern California and associate dean of USC®s Keck School of Medicine.\n\nSusan Young, president of the South Main Center Association, recalls, \"Early in my tenure heading the South Main Center Association, I was encouraged to meet Mary Schiflett because she knew the inside story on anything worth knowing she embraced me as a friend when she decided that I measured up to the job with which I had been entrusted.\"\n\nMary Schiflett\n\nSchiflett grew up in Dallas, and attended Highland Park High School and Southern Methodist University where she majored in economics and journalism.\n\nDorothy Dowell Phillips recalls hearing her mother speak of Mary on numerous occasions.\n\n\"My mother and Mary formed a college friendship that lasted a lifetime,\" said Phillips, whose mother would one day become the society columnist for the Dallas Times Herald.\n\n\"Mother said Mary was very popular in college, and she always had a date. She sang and played the piano and accordion in many SMU musical productions. She was particularly good in a musical called °Pigskin Parade® which told the story of a football team®s rise to championship.\"\n\nAn avid supporter of the troops during World War II, Schiflett performed in UFO shows in Dallas and made sandwiches for soldiers.\n\n\"She was loyal that way,\" Phillips said, especially where friends and family were concerned.\n\n\"Above all, she was a mother and a grandmother,\" remembers close friend Lee Pryor, Ph.D., a retired English pofessor from the University of Houston, where Schiflett worked before joining the Texas Medical Center. \"Her family had her deepest affection,\" Pryor said.\n\nAt UH, Schiflett was a senior research associate in the College of Business and an adjunct professor of planning with the College of Architecture. At UH she collaborated with Rice University professor Fred von der Mehden, Ph.D., on a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to identify ten prominent ethnic groups that had settled in early Houston and to describe how those groups had prevailed. This work resulted in radio and TV programs, numerous publications and a book of essays about the major ethnic groups in Texas, published by Texas A&M Press as part of Rice University Studies.\n\nShe also examined non-traditional educational programs for adults enrolled in public universities.

She had lots of diverse interests and a zest for life.\"\n\nPryor remembers Schiflett as the °model of efficiency® - practical and rational, but never cold.\n\n\"That®s Mary,\" adds the South Main Center®s Smith. \"I came to rely on and enjoy her great good sense and prickly impatience with foolishness.\"\n\nPryor also remembers Schiflett as a wonderful cook, a snappy dresser and a great gardener.\n\n\"When I visited her at home, she always had some new plant or garden arrangement to show me,\" he said.\n\nHis fondest memories include accompanying Schiflett to the opera, ballet, Alley Theatre and symphony.\n\n\"She subscribed to them all,\" he said. \"She was a great lover of the arts and of literature. She®d often read three books at a time.\"\n\nSchiflett parlayed her love of reading into a talent for writing. She was a regular contributor to Business Week magazine.\n\nBut among Schiflett®s greatest loves was world travel.\n\nPhillips recalls the time she was just starting her career and faced a dilemma. She asked Schiflett for advice.\n\n\"I had to choose between accepting a new job or going to Europe. Mary said °Go to Europe. There®ll always be jobs.®\"\n\nSchiflett traveled the world with friends in search of solar eclipses and meteor showers.\n\nAt the time of her death, she had visited all seven world continents, including Antarctica. The alter flowers at her Jan. 20 memorial service featured six varieties of flowers (representing six continents). Nestled in the center was a tiny penguin figurine (representing Antarctica, the seventh continent).\n\nSchiflett was forever involved with societal issues.\n\nShe served on the National Task Force for Consumer Product Safety, where she helped the U.S. Department of Commerce assess the risk of fires in high-rise buildings. As a member of the National Panel of the National Endowment for the Humanities, she evaluated a decade of public grant programs in 16 states.\n\nShe was a founding member of the Cultural Arts Council of Houston and the Third Ward Redevelopment Council Board, and chairman of the selection committee for the 16th annual Leon Jaworski Award sponsored by the Houston Bar Auxiliary. She was president of the Downtown Club of Houston and the Houston Center for the Humanities.\n\nRichard Wainerdi, Ph.D., president of the Texas Medical Center, remembers the time Schiflett recruited a group of physically handicapped Boy Scouts and sent them trekking through the Texas Medical Center to identify obstacles for handicapped individuals. Based on the findings, changes were made to make the campus more accessible.\n\n\"This happened a dozen years before the Americans with Disabilities Act,\" Wainerdi said. \"Mary was always ahead of her time.\"\n\nHe recalls the occasion when Schiflett convinced the Federal Reserve to conduct a study and issue a report about the Texas Medical Center®s enormous economic impact on the local economy. The report revealed Texas Medical Center institutions contributed almost $6 billion to the economy of Harris County and the surrounding area.\n\n\"Barbara Bush has said that the Texas Medical Center is Houston®s gift to the world,\" Wainerdi says. \"I believe that Mary Schiflett was God®s gift to the Texas Medical\n\nCenter.\"\n\nSchiflett leaves behind one son Raymond Schiflett III, an attorney with The University of Texas, daughter-in-law Peggy, and grandchildren Ray IV of Wimberley and Shayna of Colorado.\n\n- Ronda Wendler\n\nhttp://www.eclipsetours.com/eclipsepage\n\nMARY SCHIFFLET (1925-2006)\n\nMary Schiflett at the total solar eclipse in Zambia recording temperatures. June 2001.\n\nEULOGY FROM DAVID WEBER\n\nI met Mary in November of 1994 while traveling with a group to South America to observe a total eclipse of the sun. For those of you that have never experienced a total eclipse, you may wonder why anyone would travel around the world to distant foreign countries for such a brief event. It turns out that Mary had the bigger picture in mind. That is, she savored the adventure of the journey as well as the actual eclipse itself. Mary enjoyed making new friends along the way in addition to exploring our destination countries. She always made it a point to visit museums, paying particular attention to local artwork.\n\nOn the day of the eclipse, Mary was the tour member responsible for recording the temperature changes that occur before, during and after totality. She took this responsibility very seriously and was quite meticulous in her attention to detail. As a side-note, during the 1994 eclipse trip, Mary signed up for an extended cruise down the Amazon River. However, during this adventure, all of Mary's luggage was lost and she had to share clothes with another eclipse chaser, Celia Moynihan. Upon returning to Houston, Mary reportedly burned the blouse that she had worn for almost a week.\n\nIn 1998, our eclipse group traveled to the island of Curacao in the southern Carribean. This must have been a very, very special eclipse for Mary since she was able to share the experience with members of her family, Raymond and Peggy. In 1999, Mary traveled to the Canary Islands to view a meteor shower. Our group stayed up until almost dawn as we watched the meteor display through openings in a partly cloudy sky.\n\nIt was during one of my earliest conversations with Mary that I discovered that we shared a common travel goal, that is, to eventually set foot on each of the seven continents. Well, Mary beat me to it, achieving her goal in January of 2000 when she traveled to Antarctica and walked among the penguins.\n\nIn June of 2001, our group traveled to the African countries of Zimbabwe and Zambia for yet another eclipse. Mary visited with the native peoples, observed wildlife, explored museums and listened to local music. In April of 2005, Mary invited a group of her eclipse friends to Houston to be her guest for brunch and to reminisce about our previous travels and adventures.\n\nMary was an individual with an adventurous spirit and will be truly missed as our group continues to travel, chasing eclipses around the world.\n\nACCOUNT OF HER LIFE\n\nMary Schiflett passed away on January 13, 2006 at age 81. She was born September 23, 1925 in El Paso, TX and moved to Dallas where she was outstanding senior girl graduate of Highland Park High School. She attended Southern Methodist Univeristy on a music scholarship but later changed her major to economics and journalism and graduated with honors.\n\nShe was a member of 5 honor societes and won 1st prize in the Cokesbury contest for the best essay by a college under graduate. Her love and talent in music was demonstrated by writing an operetta while in high school that led to her college scholarhip. Throughout her life she played the piano both by note and ear and she wrote a number of songs for special occasions and to honor friends. She was given a special award by the American Red Cross for having performed as a singer, pianist, and accordianist for more than 1000 hours at hospitals and military bases across North and Central Texas during World War II and turned down several opportunities to turn professional with her music while still at college.\n\nAt SMU she was a journalist for THE SEMI-WEEKLY CAMPUS. Upon graduation she first worked for the US Dept. of Commerce at its regional office as an economics historian. Later she was assistant editor of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce's journal DALLAS.\n\nIn 1948 she married Ray Schifflet II and they moved to Houston. She continued her career as a writer, joining the staff of McGraw-Hill's BUSINESS WEEK. When the marriage ended she enrolled at the University of Houston obtaining a masters degree in English Literature and continued as a free-lance editor and writer for economics and business journals. She taught economic planning in the Future Studies Program at UH-Clear Lake and city planning in the College of Architecture on the Main UH campus. At UH and Rice universities she received a number of national grants including one from the Sloan Foundation and two from the National Endowment for the Humanities and these projects resulted in her contributing articles and chapters to books published nationally.\n\nIn 1984 she joined the executive staff of the Texas Medical Center as Associate Director for Planning. She held successively senior positions until her temporary retirement in 1998 as Vice President for Public Affairs. After an extended trip to South America, she returned to TMC becoming Vice President/Consultant, a position she held until December 2006. Twelve years before the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed Mary recognized the need for handicapped facilities at the Texas Medical Center and initiated guidelines which enabled facilities to be installed at all onsite buildings.\n\nShe was listed for many years in WHOS WHO IN AMERICA and other national and international biographical directories. She was the first woman member of the Rotary Club of River Oaks in 1997 and was awarded its Outstanding Member plaque for her service, and and was President in 2003-2004. She was a member of the executive committee for the Friends of Hermann Park; on the volunteer service council of the Institute for International Education's Southern Regional District; and President for two years of the Downtown Club.\n\nEUOLOGY FROM DEBBIE MORAN\n\nI first met Mary on an eclipse trip to Africa. When I lost my suitcase somewhere on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, it was Mary who came to the rescue with a loan of undergarments for the few days remaining. Her generosity went even beyond that when she informed me there was no need to return them. Mary's desire to travel to see eclipses says something about who she was. I think it is because chasing eclipses is more than just a gee-whiz experience. It satisfies on many levels: as a thing of beauty, as an extraordinary natural phenomenon full of rapidly changing effects, as a cultural experience as it brings together people from many different parts of the world, and for many, there is a spiritual aspect. Besides being one of the most beautiful sights one can hope to see, an eclipse, more than anything else I can think of, makes this corner of the solar system seem tailor made for humans. I always marvel at how two completely unrelated objects, the moon, a rock only about the quarter the diameter of earth, and the sun, a star which could swallow a million earths, could be placed in the heavens in such a way that from our point of view here on earth, their apparent size is nearly the same. When every year or two, they happen to coincide in such a way that the moon completely blocks the chromosphere of the sun and the normally invisible corona appears, the effect is miraculous. It is one of those things that makes you grateful to be alive. I remember our tour guide in Africa saying he did not fully understand why we bothered to go to all this effort. After the eclipse, he said, \"Now I see.\" I know Mary also appreciated the way eclipses draw people to explore different cultures. We have found ourselves in parts of the world we may have never thought about visiting otherwise. This serendipity of experience is another great attraction of eclipse travel.\n\nAfter we returned to Houston, Mary became a lunch companion. She was also a Symphony patron, and as a musician with the Symphony, I appreciated her support. We often spoke of conductors and interpretations as well as symphony politics. I always thought it was extremely cool that she had to steer our lunches around activities such as showing PBS camera crews around the Medical Center. She struck me not only as interesting in her own pursuits, but also as interested in others. For me, Mary was a model to aspire to, with her grace, dignity, and engagement in life. I was right in the middle of getting to know her better, and feel greatly that I have missed a lot.\n\nJoseph next married Jane Clancey Pegues on 21 Mar 1969 in Dallas Co., TX.
