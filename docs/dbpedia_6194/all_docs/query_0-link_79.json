        "text": "PITTSBURGH — Kenny Pickett hit George Pickens for a 41-yard touchdown with 1:17 remaining, and the Pittsburgh Steelers rallied to beat the Baltimore Ravens 17-10 on Sunday.\n\nPickett and the rest of Pittsburgh’s sporadic offense managed little over the game’s first 55 minutes, but a late interception by rookie cornerback Joey Porter Jr. gave the Steelers life. Pickett responded by driving Pittsburgh 80 yards in eight plays, the last 41 coming on a rainbow down the sideline to Pickens.\n\nThe score was the Steelers’ first touchdown in nearly nine quarters and it somehow was enough to beat the Ravens, who seemed intent on keeping Pittsburgh in the game before ultimately handing it to their longtime AFC North rivals.\n\nThe Ravens turned the ball over three times, including twice in the final five minutes.\n\n49ERS 42, COWBOYS 10: Brock Purdy threw three of his four touchdown passes to George Kittle, and San Francisco extended its dominance over visiting Dallas.\n\nThe Niners knocked the Cowboys out of the playoffs in tight games the past two seasons and that added intrigue to this early season matchup between perceived contenders. The rematch wasn’t even close.\n\nThe Niners led 14-0 before the Cowboys got their initial first down of the night and were never really threatened on the way to matching a franchise record with their 15th straight regular-season win. Dallas had its most lopsided loss in 10 years.\n\nJAGUARS 25, BILLS 20: Travis Etienne rushed for 136 yards and two fourth-quarter touchdowns, and Jacksonville beat jet-lagged Buffalo at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nThe Jaguars may not want to leave London after getting back-to-back wins in the British capital, ending Buffalo’s three-game winning streak and proving they can hang with an AFC powerhouse.\n\nThe Bills had routed their past three opponents but looked tired at times, rushed for only 29 yards, and had a rash of injuries.\n\nLIONS 42, PANTHERS 24: Jared Goff threw three touchdown passes in the first half and ran for a score in the fourth quarter, lifting Detroit to a home victory over winless Carolina.\n\nThe NFC North-leading Lions are alone atop the division in October or later for the first time since 2016.\n\nThe Panthers turned the ball over three times in the first half — two coming on consecutive snaps — to set up Detroit up for three touchdowns and a 28-10 halftime lead.\n\nDOLPHINS 31, GIANTS 16: Rookie De’Von Achane had a 76-yard rushing touchdown, Tyreek Hill surpassed 150 yards receiving for the third time this season, and host Miami beat New York.\n\nThe Dolphins’ 524 yards gave them 2,568 for the season, which is the most yards through the first five games of a season in NFL history.\n\nWith the win, Miami regained first place in the AFC East after Buffalo lost to Jacksonville.\n\nFALCONS 21, TEXANS 19: Desmond Ridder passed and ran for touchdowns, providing an answer to those who had called for him to be benched, Younghoe Koo kicked a go-ahead 37-yard field goal as time expired, and Atlanta snapped a two-game skid by beating Houston at home.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRidder’s 6-yard TD pass to rookie running back Bijan Robinson and 2-point pass to Tyler Allgeier gave the Falcons a 15-12 lead early in the fourth quarter. Robinson reached back to catch the ball against his hip before running through the middle of the Houston defense into the end zone.\n\nHouston rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud answered with an 18-yard scoring pass to tight end Dalton Schultz, giving the Texans a 19-18 lead with 1:49 remaining. Schultz found an opening in the middle of the end zone behind safety Jessie Bates.\n\nSAINTS 34, PATRIOTS 0: Alvin Kamara rushed for a touchdown to become the Saints’ career TD leader, Derek Carr had two scoring passes and New Orleans routed host New England.\n\nTyrann Mathieu added a 27-yard interception return for a touchdown to help New Orleans chase Patriots quarterback Mac Jones from the game — the second straight week coach Bill Belichick sidelined Jones in the second half.\n\nKamara punched in his 73rd career TD, one of his 22 carries for 80 yards. Carr finished 18 of 26 for 183 yards, and Michael Thomas had four catches for 65 yards as New Orleans ended a two-game skid.\n\nCOLTS 23, TITANS 16: Zack Moss upstaged the return of Jonathan Taylor by running for a career-high 165 yards and two scores, and Gardner Minshew was sharp in relief of the injured Anthony Richardson to lead host Indianapolis past Tennessee.\n\nThe Colts snapped a seven-game losing streak at home by beating the Titans for the first time in six tries.\n\nOn a day when most expected Taylor or Tennessee’s Derrick Henry to be the focus, it was Moss who dazzled. He averaged 7.2 yards on 23 carries in his second 100-yard game this season, caught two passes for 30 yards and made play after play — just one day after the Colts announced they signed Taylor to a three-year contract extension.\n\nEAGLES 23, RAMS 14: Jalen Hurts passed for 303 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 72 yards and another score, and Philadelphia outlasted host Los Angeles to remain unbeaten.\n\nDallas Goedert had eight catches for 117 yards and an early TD for the Eagles, who are off to their second consecutive 5-0 start despite getting tested throughout this meeting of the last two NFC champions.\n\nA.J. Brown had six catches for 127 yards, but the Eagles couldn’t reach the end zone in the second half and had to rely on their defense, which shut out the Rams (2-3) after halftime.\n\nBENGALS 34, CARDINALS 20: Joe Burrow threw for 317 yards and three touchdown passes to Ja’Marr Chase, who finished with a season-high 192 yards receiving, and Cincinnati won at Arizona.\n\nIt was a much-needed offensive performance for Burrow, who signed the NFL’s richest contract during the offseason but was slowed through his first four games of the season by a calf injury. The 26-year-old looked plenty healthy against the Cardinals, completing 36 of 46 passes and buying time on a handful of plays with his athleticism in the pocket.\n\nCHIEFS 27, VIKINGS 20: Patrick Mahomes threw two touchdown passes in the third quarter, one to Travis Kelce after the All-Pro tight end briefly left the game with an ankle injury, and Kansas City won at Minnesota.\n\nMahomes went 31 for 41 for 281 yards and no turnovers in his most efficient performance of the season for the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs, who once again won while not at their best.\n\nKirk Cousins threw for scores to Jordan Addison and Alexander Mattison for the Vikings. They had two chances at the tying touchdown in the final five minutes, but a late hamstring injury to star wide receiver Justin Jefferson and a lack of timeouts from earlier mismanagement of the game were ultimately too much to overcome.\n\nJETS 31, BRONCOS 21: New York celebrated Nathaniel Hackett’s return to Denver by rallying past the Broncos behind Breece Hall’s 72-yard touchdown run and Bryce Hall’s 39-yard game-sealing scoop-and-score off Russell Wilson’s fumble in the final minute.\n\nThat gave Hackett, the Jets’ offensive coordinator who was fired after going 4-11 as Denver’s head coach last season, a measure of satisfaction.\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
