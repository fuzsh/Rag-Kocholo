        "text": "Over the past few years, music artists like Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Mick Jagger and Dion (DiMucci) have demonstrated hitting the eighties doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt still rock. But octogenarians starting a new band is something you don‚Äôt hear often. Enter Steve Cropper, who formed The Midnight Hour in 2022, largely drawing on backing musicians for his Grammy nominated 2021 album Fire It Up. Now he‚Äôs out with Friendlytown, the first offering as Steve Cropper & The Midnight Hour. And it‚Äôs a pure joy, not weird!\n\nNot all of my readers may be familiar with Cropper, though most folks have probably heard of In the Midnight Hour, Knock On Wood and (Sittin‚Äô On) The Dock of the Bay ‚Äì three soul gems that not only featured the longtime guitarist and producer as part of Stax house band Booker T. & the M.G.‚Äôs, but three songs he also co-wrote. And let‚Äôs not forget the credit Cropper received for that group‚Äôs prominent instrumental Green Onions. In the late ‚Äô70s, he also became a member of The Blues Brothers and can be seen in the fun 1980 picture of the same name.\n\nThe Midnight Hour, named after the aforementioned 1965 song Cropper penned with Wilson Pickett who also first recorded it, feature Roger C. Reale (lead vocals), Eddie Gore (Hammond organ, tambourine, harmony vocals), Jon Tiven (bass/Hammond, piano, saxophone, harmony vocals) and Nioshi Jackson (drums, percussion) ‚Äì oh, and that bearded dude from Texas, Billy F. Gibbons (lead guitar), best known as one third of ZZ Top. Cropper provides rhythm and lead guitars. When you see this cool line-up you already know this can‚Äôt suck!\n\nFriendlytown, which dropped on Friday, August 23, ‚Äúexplores personal relationships from a seasoned perspective,‚Äù as this review in Blues Rock Review nicely summarized. Appearing on European rock & blues label Provogue, part of Mascot Label Group, the album was co-produced by Cropper and Tiven who also served in that capacity on Cropper‚Äôs above-mentioned Fire It Up. That title perfectly sums up my sentiments about finally getting to some music!\n\nLet‚Äôs kick it off with the opener and title track. Co-written by Cropper, Gibbons, Reale and Tiven, it nicely sets the tone for the rest of the album ‚Äì soulful blues that doesn‚Äôt reinvent the wheel but is well executed by top notch musicians and simply a lot of fun if you dig soul and blues, which I do!\n\nOn Too Much Stress another killer guitarist joins: Brian May, of British rock band Queen, who trades licks with Gibbons and Cropper. He also co-wrote the song with Cropper, Reale and Tiven. With so much great guitar action, it‚Äôs easy to ignore the song‚Äôs somber topic, which are the curveballs life can throw at you ‚Äì but, hey, it‚Äôs blues after all! The opening chords seem to be a tip of the hat to Leiber-Stoller rock & roll classic Jailhouse Rock, popularized by Elvis Presley.\n\nEvidently, Cropper, Reale and Tiven aren‚Äôt fans of politicians, and who can blame them. Our current times provide plenty of examples who aren‚Äôt just weird con artists but a clear and present danger to democracy. Or as the songwriters cheerfully put it, ‚Ä¶‚Äùliars, crooks and clowns‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nYet another guest appears on You Can‚Äôt Refuse: Country and southern rock singer-songwriter Tim Montana who demonstrates nice bluesy guitar chops. The track, again co-written by Cropper, Reale and Tiven, also features Simon Kirke on drums. He‚Äôs best known as a co-founder of Bad Company and the only continuous member of that group who technically haven‚Äôt disbanded but whose outlook is uncertain.\n\nI‚Äôll leave you with one more track: Reality Check, another co-write by Cropper, Reale and Tiven. I suppose by this time you‚Äôve probably figured out these three fellows wrote most of the songs on the album.\n\nThe final word shall belong to Mr. Cropper. ‚ÄúIf your booty is not shaking in the first two bars of this album you‚Äôre already dead in a chair,‚Äù he said (laughing) in a statement on Mascot‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúI feel so good about this batch of songs. They‚Äôre packed with radio hooks, and we have Billy Gibbons, Brian May, and Tim Montana playing on the album‚Äîit‚Äôs like guitar heaven.‚Äù I approve of this message! üôÇ\n\nHere‚Äôs a Spotify link to the album. I encourage you to check it out!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Blues Rock Review; Mascot Label Group website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Sunday and welcome to another installment of imaginary music travel. If you‚Äôre a frequent visitor of the blog or are familiar with my music taste otherwise, you know how much I dig great vocals, especially when sung in perfect harmony. So this time, I thought to challenge myself and put together an itinerary of instrumental tracks only. I think I found some good stuff, so stay with me!\n\nJeff Beck/Declan\n\nStarting us off today is Jeff Beck, who undoubtedly was one of most amazing guitarists of our time with an incredible tone. Apart from music with various groups like The Yardbirds, The Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice, he released a series of albums under his own name. Sadly, Beck‚Äôs nearly 60-year career came to an end in January 2023 when he passed away from bacterial meningitis at age 78. Off his seventh solo album Who Else! from March 1999, here‚Äôs the beautiful Declan, a composition by Irish folk musician D√≥nal Lunny.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band/Jessica\n\nThis next track takes us to August 1973 and Brothers and Sisters, the fourth studio album by The Allman Brothers Band. During the recording sessions, co-founder and bassist Berry Oakley who had been struggling with addiction and depression in the wake of Duane Allman‚Äôs death weirdly was also killed in a motorcycle accident. The group carried on, bringing in Chuck Leavell and Lamar Williams on piano and bass, respectively, with guitarist Dickey Betts becoming their de facto leader. Betts also composed the bouncy Jessica, a tribute to gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, named after Betts‚Äô infant daughter.\n\nHorace Silver Quintet/Se√±or Blues\n\nJust because we didn‚Äôt start today‚Äôs trip with jazz doesn‚Äôt mean we skip it altogether. This time, I‚Äôve picked a track by pianist, composer and arranger Horace Silver who is especially known for hard bop, a style he helped create in the 1950s. After leaving The Jazz Messengers, who Silver had co-founded with drummer Art Blakey in 1954, he formed his own quintet. One of their early albums, 6 Pieces of Silver, appeared in late 1956. Here‚Äôs Se√±or Blues, a composition by Silver. He was backed by Donald Byrd (trumpet), Hank Mobley (tenor saxophone), Doug Watkins (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums).\n\nBooker T. & the M.G.‚Äôs/Time Is Tight\n\nOne of the coolest ‚Äô60s backing bands I can think of were Booker T. & the M.G.‚Äôs. As house band of Memphis soul label Stax, they played on hundreds of recordings by artists like Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas and Albert King. Starting in the early ‚Äô60s, Booker T. & the M.G.‚Äôs also released instrumentals under their own name. Their best-known is Green Onions, the title track of their October 1962 debut album. Time Is Tight became another hit single released in February 1969. Credited to all four members ‚Äì Booker T. Jones (organ), Steve Cropper (guitar), Donald ‚ÄúDuck‚Äù Dunn (bass) and Al Jackson Jr. (drums) ‚Äì the tune was included on the soundtrack album UpTight for the 1968 drama picture of the same title.\n\nJan Hammer/Crockett‚Äôs Theme\n\nNext let‚Äôs pay a visit to the ‚Äô80s and one of the biggest instrumental hits of the decade I can recall: Crockett‚Äôs Theme by Czech-American musician, composer, and record producer Jan Hammer who had gained prominence in the early ‚Äô70s as keyboarder of jazz fusion band Mahavishnu Orchestra. Hammer also wrote scores for film and television. The latter included the ‚Äô80s U.S. crime drama series Miami Vice, which also became popular in other countries including Germany. Here‚Äôs Crockett‚Äôs Theme, which was released in 1986 and topped the charts in Belgium and The Netherlands, reached no. 2 in the UK and Ireland, and no. 4 in Germany. By comparison, it peaked at a moderate no. 42 in the U.S. on Billboard‚Äôs Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nPeter Frampton/Isn‚Äôt It a Pity\n\nFor our sixth and final stop we shall head back to the present. In April 2021, Peter Frampton released his most recent all-instrumental album appropriately titled Frampton Forgets the Words. The English-American guitarist turned 74 on Monday. The day before, he was announced as one of the 2024 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Leading up to it I had read Frampton had really hoped he would make it in. The induction of the man, who with Frampton Comes Alive! delivered one of the most iconic ‚Äô70s rock live albums, is well-deserved! Coming back to the above-mentioned album, here‚Äôs a beautiful rendition of George Harrison‚Äôs Isn‚Äôt It a Pity, a great song from his first post-Beatles solo album All Things Must Pass, which came out in November 1970.\n\nOf course, this post wouldn‚Äôt be complete without a Spotify playlist of the above tunes. Hope there‚Äôs something for you and you‚Äôll be back for more. While I can‚Äôt exclude the possibility of future twists, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see another all-instrumental installment of The Sunday Six anytime soon!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nI don‚Äôt know about you, but with January gone, 2024 is already starting to feel old. For now, let‚Äôs focus on something much more cheerful, which has become one of my favorite writing tasks each month: Turntable Talk!\n\nFor this round, Dave asked us to share our thoughts about a great movie soundtrack. The first thing that came to mind were theme songs from James Bond 007 pictures, but I felt that‚Äôs not really what our dear follow blogger had in mind. Since I‚Äôm not exactly a movie expert, I started to get a bit anxious. Sometimes a dose of anxiety can jolt the brain, and suddenly different soundtracks started popping up, including my pick: The Commitments!\n\nThe 1991 musical comedy was directed by Alan Parker, a name I recalled in connection with ‚Äò80s dramas and thrillers like Mississippi Burning and Angel Heart. I had forgotten Parker also directed Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall and Fame, both pictures that are topically closer to The Commitments.\n\nThe comedy tells the tale of Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins), a young lad from the North Side of Dublin, Ireland, who is determined to put together a band of other young working-class folks to play Stax-style soul: The Commitments. The film was based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Roddy Doyle.\n\nTo fulfill his dream of managing a soul band, Rabbitte puts an ad in a local paper and holds auditions at his parents‚Äô house. After he assembles a group of mostly individuals with very little experience, they get a drum set and a piano. Rabbitte secures the remainder of the equipment on credit from a shady black market dealer. They find a rehearsal space, practice furiously and eventually become pretty good.\n\nTheir first gig at a local church community center starts great but ends in disaster after their great lead vocalist Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong), who is full of himself, accidentally hits bassist Derek Scully (Kenneth McCluskey) with his microphone stand, leading to a chain reaction of exploding amps and a power outage.\n\nAs the film goes on, tensions among the members rise. Veteran trumpeter Joey ‚ÄúThe Lips‚Äù Fagan (Johnny Murphy), who claims he played on Sgt. Pepper‚Äôs Lonely Hearts Club Band and performed with all kinds of different high profile artists, seduces each of the three female backing vocalists, one after the other. Meanwhile, Deco becomes increasingly obnoxious, making drummer Mickah Wallace (Dave Finnegan) want to punch him in the face, which he eventually does.\n\nAfter two additional gigs that end in chaos, Joey tells Rabbitte he could get his friend Wilson Pickett to perform with the band. Rabbitte sees a huge breakthrough opportunity for the group and invites a bunch of journalists to their next gig at a music club where Pickett is supposed to appear with them. While The Commitments put on a great gig, the Stax star doesn‚Äôt show ‚Äì that is not in time. As Rabbitte leaves the venue, angry that Joey allegedly fooled him, Pickett‚Äôs limousine pulls up next to him, and the driver asks for directions to the club ‚Äì suggesting Joey for once had not stretched the truth! The film ends with a funny monologue of Rabbitte giving an update on each of the Commitments‚Äô former members after the group had broken up.\n\nThe film ends with a funny monologue of Rabbitte giving an update on each of the Commitments‚Äô former members after the group had broken up.\n\nWhile I hope the above summary provides a good idea about the plot, I find it impossible to convey the film‚Äôs hilarious humor without any video excerpts ‚Äì not to mention the great music! Here‚Äôs the official trailer.\n\nHere‚Äôs another snippet.\n\nI realize I‚Äôm nine graphs into this post and haven‚Äôt discussed any specific music. Let‚Äôs get to some of the great songs from the soundtrack!\n\nHere‚Äôs one of my favorites, Mustang Sally, written by Mack Rice in 1965 and popularized by Wilson Pickett a year later.\n\nAnother highlight is Chain of Fools, penned by Don Covay and first released by Aretha Franklin in November 1967.\n\nNext up: Try a Little Tenderness, written by Jimmy Campbell, Reg Connelly, and Harry M. Woods, was first recorded by the Ray Noble Orchestra in December 1932. The Commitments‚Äô rendition mirrors the popular version by Otis Redding, which appeared in November 1966.\n\nLet‚Äôs do another Wilson Pickett classic, In the Midnight Hour, a song he co-wrote with Steve Cropper, guitarist of Stax house band Booker T. & the M.G.‚Äôs. This gem was released in June 1965.\n\nNotably, the film‚Äôs band characters were mostly inexperienced actors who were cast because of their musical backgrounds and their resemblance to the characters in the novel. Together with casting directors Jon Hubbard and Russ Hubbard, Parker was searching the Dublin local club scene to find young music artists to cast for the movie.\n\nThe only actor who did not play their instrument was Joey, the trumpeter. Parker had actually hoped to get Van Morrison to play the part. Apparently, Rory Gallagher was considered as well. Given the instrument was the trumpet, I don‚Äôt understand why Parker wanted any of them other than for their fame. Eventually, Parker cast Murphy, a veteran film and stage actor.\n\nParker spent five weeks rehearsing with the cast before actual filming began. Music supervisor G. Marq Roswell, who had identified songs for the film, also oversaw the recording sessions. Since Parker wanted the rehearsal and performance scenes of The Commitments to be as realistic as possible, all tracks were recorded live on set.\n\nThe estimated budget to make The Commitments was quite small, amounting to $12-15 million, which translates to about $35 million today. Surprisingly, the film only grossed just under $15 million in North America. In contrast, it was the highest grossing film in Ireland of all time, generating IR¬£2.23 million ($3.5 million). In the UK, it made ¬£8.29 million.\n\nEventually, the film was also turned into a musical. It premiered in September 2013 in London and had an initial run there until November 2015. It has since had two tours of the UK and Ireland. The most recent came to an end last year. I still fondly remember watching the theatrical release of The Commitments in a small independent movie theater in T√ºbingen, Germany, where I was a graduate student at the time. To this day, it remains one of my all-time favorite music-related films.\n\n* This post was originally published on A Sound Day on February 16, 2024. It has been slightly reformatted.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube\n\nOnce again, Dave from A Sound Day recently reached out to a bunch of fellow bloggers to invite their thoughts on the latest topic for his monthly recurring fun feature Turntable Talk. This time, his ask was to write about an instrumental we like a lot. Following is my humble contribution, which was first published on Dave‚Äôs blog on January 12.\n\nWhile it‚Äôs safe to assume most of us had things we happily kissed goodbye or wish could get rid of once and for all when 2023 came to its close, it‚Äôs great to see when beloved things continue. In my mind, the latter include Turntable Talk, which remains one of the most fun blogging activities each month thanks to fellow blogger Dave who always comes up with great topics!\n\nFor Round 22, Dave asked us to forget about the words, if you will, and share some thoughts on an all-instrumental we dig. If you‚Äôre familiar with my music taste, you know how much I love vocals, especially when sung in perfect harmony. As such, you might think I may have a hard time finding an instrumental I really like. Well, not really.\n\nIn fact, I knew right away which tune I would write about. Then I thought, ‚Äòwell, perhaps not so fast!‚Äô After all, there are multiple instrumentals I dig, such as Monty Norman‚Äôs James Bond Theme, The Shadows‚Äô Apache, Fleetwood Mac‚Äôs Albatross and The Allman Brothers Band‚Äôs Jessica. Heck, even my favorite hard rock band Deep Purple penned a great instrumental titled April.\n\nAfter I had thought about the above and a few additional instrumentals, I decided to go Brooklynite, cheerfully concluding ‚Äòfuhgeddaboudit!‚Äô So I went back to my initial pick, hoping nobody else will choose it: Green Onions by Booker T. & the M.G.‚Äôs.\n\nWhy Green Onions? Coz it‚Äôs a friggin‚Äô awesome tune with a cool sound and a simple, yet infectious groove that makes you want to snip your fingers or engage other parts of your body to move along! Green Onions also is an instrumental with a nice background story.\n\nOriginally, the 12-bar blues with its distinct Hammond organ sound was composed by Booker T. Jones when he was 17. This was around 1961 and, as such, predated The M.G.s. At that time, remarkably, Jones already was a professional musician and had played baritone saxophone on the recording of Cause I Love You by Carla Thomas and Rufus Thomas ‚Äì the first hit single for Satellite Records, which soon would become Stax Records.\n\nThe M.G.s who in addition to Jones (organ, piano, keyboards, guitar) originally featured Steve Cropper (guitar), Lewie Steinberg (bass) and Al Jackson Jr. (drums), came together in 1962. Serving as Stax‚Äô house band, they played on countless recordings by the label‚Äôs artists, such as Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas and Rufus Thomas. And rockabilly singer and Sun Records recording artist Billy Lee Riley.\n\nWhen on a Sunday in June 1962 Riley didn‚Äôt show up for a scheduled recording session, Booker T. & the M.G.s began jamming to a tune Jones initially had written on piano but felt it sounded better with a Hammond organ. Stax co-owner Jim Stewart liked what he heard and decided to record the track, Behave Yourself, with the idea to release it as a single. Once it was in the can, they needed a B-side. That‚Äôs when the magic happened.\n\nJones started playing his ‚Äúold‚Äù composition on the Hammond. The other members of the M.G.‚Äôs began improvising to it. The end result was Green Onions, which initially was titled Funky Onions. However, Stewart‚Äôs sister and Stax label co-owner Estelle Axton (Stax = Stewart-Axton) felt Funky Onions sounded like swearing. Therefore, it was renamed Green Onions.\n\nAfter they had recorded Green Onions, Cropper took a copy of the tune to Memphis radio station WLOK where he was friendly with morning DJ Rueben Washington. All Washington needed to hear was part of the track. He cut off the record that was on the air and started playing Green Onions several times. The phone lines lit up quickly and the rest is history.\n\nGreen Onions, which subsequently became the A-side of the single, peaked at no. 3 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 in late September 1962. The track also topped the R&B Singles chart for a combined (non-consecutive) four weeks.\n\nAbout 17 years later, in December 1979, Green Onions entered the UK Singles Chart after it had been featured in Quadrophenia, a 1979 British drama film that was loosely based on The Who‚Äôs 1973 rock opera of the same name. Eventually, it peaked at number no. 7 in late January 1980 and stayed on the British chart for 12 consecutive weeks!\n\nI‚Äôll leave you with a few quotes related to Green Onions, as documented by Songfacts:\n\n‚ÄúIf we released this as a record, what would you want to call it?‚Äù ‚ÄúGreen Onions,‚Äù was Booker T. Jones‚Äô reply. ‚ÄúWhy ‚ÄòGreen Onions'‚Äù Jim asked. Booker T: ‚ÄúBecause that is the nastiest thing I can think of and it‚Äôs something you throw away.‚Äù ‚Äì dialogue between Jim Stewart and Booker T. Jones\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòGreen Onions‚Äô appears to be a simple song, but every time I play it, I have to pay attention. I have to remember, and school myself on how the notes go, because it‚Äôs just not as simple as it sounds.‚Äù ‚Äì Booker T. Jones\n\n‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre a successful songwriter, you might see your songs get in movies, cartoons, commercials. But I never knew that I would be a co-writer on a song for adult diapers (laughs). For four years ‚ÄòGreen Onions‚Äô was in a commercial for Depends. That song‚Äôs gone from adult diapers to pita chips and now it‚Äôs in a dog food commercial. As soon as they get through with it someone else will use it.‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Cropper\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nHappy Sunday and welcome to another installment of my weekly time travel into the wonderful world of music. As always, we will visit six tunes from six different decades in different flavors. Let‚Äôs fasten our seat belts and off we go!\n\nAhmad Jamal Trio/Beat Out One\n\nOur first stop is the year 1956 and some groovy piano jazz by the Ahmad Jamal Trio. According to his website, Jamal was born in July 1930 in Pittsburgh, Pa. and already began playing the piano at the age of 3. By the age of 10, Jamal was composing, orchestrating and performing works by Franz Liszt, exploring the music of Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, Nat Cole, Erroll Garner and a host of music notables... At 17, he left home at the request of the George Hudson Orchestra and began touring the country...He formed his own group in 1951 and with the help of John Hammond started his recording career with Okeh Records. This brings me to Count ‚ÄòEm 88, an album Jamal recorded with Israel Crosby (bass) and Walter Perkins (drums) in 1956 and released the same year as Ahmad Jamal Trio. Jamal who is still alive at age 92 continued to frequently tour and record well into his ‚Äô80s. Let‚Äôs listen to his composition Beat Out One, off Count ‚ÄòEm 88. And, yes, feel free to snip along!\n\nPretenders/Brass in Pocket\n\nLet‚Äôs move on to 1979 and the eponymous debut album by Pretenders. Interestingly, Nick Lowe produced the English-American rock band‚Äôs first single Stop Your Sobbing but felt they were going nowhere, so didn‚Äôt continue with them ‚Äì boy was he wrong! Chris Thomas, who had worked with the likes of The Beatles, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd, Badfinger and Roxy Music before, took over and the rest is history. Pretenders charged out of the gate strongly, with the album topping the UK charts, and climbing to no. 2, no. 2, no. 5, no. 6 and no. 9 in New Zealand, Sweden, Canada, Australia and the U.S., respectively. Brass in Pocket, written by co-founders Chrissie Hynde and James Honeyman-Scott, became the record‚Äôs third single in November 1979 and their most successful song overall, including their only no. 1 hit in the UK. While Pretenders have had many line-up changes over the years, they are still going strong, with Hynde and drummer Martin Chambers remaining as original members. Their most recent album Hate for Sale from July 2020, which I reviewed here, sounds mighty.\n\nQuasi/It‚Äôs Hard to Turn Me On\n\nIf you happened to read my most recent Best of What‚Äôs New installment, the name Quasi should ring a bell. Or perhaps you knew this American indie rock band from Portland, Ore. all along. They were founded in 1993 by former husband and wife Sam Coomes (vocals, guitar, keyboards, bass) and Janet Weiss (vocals, drums). This next tune takes us to April 1998 and Quasi‚Äôs third studio album Featuring ‚ÄúBirds‚Äù. At that time, they were still a duo, at least in the studio, playing all instruments except for one track. Quasi‚Äôs music frequently features flavors of the ‚Äô60s. After expanding into a trio from 2007 to 2011, they‚Äôve been back to being a duo since Mole City, their second most recent album. Here‚Äôs It‚Äôs Hard to Turn Me On, penned by Coomes. I just find their retro and at times slightly weird sound pretty charming!\n\nBarbara Blue/The Shoals (feat. Davor Haƒçiƒá)\n\nNext, we return to the present and the Shoals ‚Äì that would be Muscle Shoals, Ala, baby! You may have heard of FAME Studios where artists like Etta James, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Duane Allman and Gregg Allman recorded. The session musicians who worked at FAME became known as the Muscle Shoals Horns and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, aka the Swampers ‚Äì famously referenced in Lynyrd Skynyrd‚Äôs classic Sweet Home Alabama. In other words, Muscle Shoals is holy ground in music. As such, when coming across a song titled The Shoals the other day, I paid attention immediately. It turned out to be a track on the new album From the Shoals by Barbara Blue. The Memphis-based blues and soul vocalist, who apparently is known as the ‚Äúreigning queen of Beale Street,‚Äù has been active since 1977. The album, her 13th independent release, came out two weeks ago on January 27. It was recorded at the NuttHouse Recording Studio in Sheffield, Ala., about 3 miles away from FAME. Here‚Äôs the great funky and soulful opener The Shoals, co-written by Blue and her Croatian songwriting partner Davor Haƒçiƒá. Love this! Based on what else I‚Äôve heard thus far, the album sounds sweet as well.\n\nThe Smiths/This Charming Man\n\nTime to pay a visit to the ‚Äô80s, specifically, October 1983. That‚Äôs when English indie rock and jangle pop band The Smiths, who had come together the previous year in Manchester, released their second single This Charming Man. And charming it was indeed. Co-written by guitarist Johnny Marr and vocalist Morrissey, the tune was the band‚Äôs first to make the mainstream UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at no. 25. It also became the first of the group‚Äôs multiple singles to top the UK Independent Singles Chart. Notably, in 1992, five years after The Smiths had broken up, the single was reissued and got to no. 8 on the UK Singles Chart. While I find the ego clashes between Marr and Morrissey that led to The Smiths‚Äô breakup and subsequent litigation over royalties brought by former members Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce less than charming, I love the tune‚Äôs jangly guitar sound.\n\nThe Yardbirds/Heart Full of Soul\n\nOur final destination on today‚Äôs time travel is June 1965. Did you really think I‚Äôd skip the ‚Äô60s? No way! On June 4 of that year, The Yardbirds released their single Heart Full of Soul in the UK. Written by Graham Gouldman who in 1972 would become a co-founder of 10cc, Heart Full of Soul was The Yardbirds‚Äô first single after Jeff Beck had replaced Eric Clapton as lead guitarist. The tune appeared three months after For Your Love, which had also been penned by Gouldman. Heart Full of Soul climbed to no. 2 in the UK, a notch higher than For Your Love, which had reached no. 3 there. In the U.S., where Heart Full of Soul was released on July 2, 1965, the picture was reversed. For Your Love reached no. 6, while Heart Full of Soul climbed to no. 9. Notably, The Yardbirds initially recorded Heart Full of Soul with an Indian sitar player but didn‚Äôt like the outcome. According to Beck, he couldn‚Äôt get the 4/4 time signature right, so Beck ended up emulating the sitar on his guitar, using a fuzz box.\n\nLast but not least, here‚Äôs a Spotify playlist of the above tunes. As always, I hope there‚Äôs something you dig.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Ahmad Jamal website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHope everybody is enjoying their weekend. I‚Äôd like to welcome you to another Sunday Six zigzag journey to the beautiful world of music, six tunes at a time. While writing about music typically makes me a happy camper, I always particularly look forward to putting together another installment of this weekly feature. As long as I dig the track, these posts can include any type of music. Not being limited to a particular album or specific theme feels very liberating. Let‚Äôs do it!\n\nClifford Brown and Max Roach/Sandu\n\nToday, I‚Äôd like to start our little trip in 1956. Clifford Brown was an American jazz trumpeter and composer, who during only four years of recording left an impressive legacy. Sadly, he passed away in a car accident at the age of 25 en route to Chicago for a gig, along with pianist Richie Powell and Powell‚Äôs wife Nancy Powell who was at the wheel when their car went off the road for unknown reasons. Max Roach, a pioneer of bebop, is regarded as one of the most important drummers in history. In 1954, the two musicians formed a quintet and over the next few years recorded a series of albums. One of them was Study In Brown, which included the great Brown composition Sandu. In addition to Brown, Roach and Powell, at the time, the quintet featured Harold Land (tenor saxophone) and George Morrow (double bass). My kind of music for a Sunday morning to get in the mood‚Ä¶\n\nBruce Springsteen/Bobby Jean\n\nI trust Herr Springsteen doesn‚Äôt need an introduction. While I‚Äôve covered The Boss multiple times since I started penning this blog in June 2016, based on a quick search, apparently, this is only the second time I feature Bruuuuuuuuce in The Sunday Six. With so many songs Bruce Springsteen has written over nearly six decades, it‚Äôs hard to pick one. I decided to go back to June 1984 and the album that brought the New Jersey rocker on my radar screen: Born in the U.S.A. One of the tunes I‚Äôve always loved and think would have made a good single is Bobby Jean. The story about a guy who wants to visit somebody important to him only to find out the person left is ‚Äúa good song about youthful friendship‚Äù, according to Springsteen, as noted by Songfacts. Apparently, the tune was written as a farewell message to E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt, who during the Born in the U.S.A. recording sessions decided to leave to focus on his solo career. Of course, Little Steven has been back since 1999 and is set to join Bruce and the band for a 2023 international tour. Man, it just feels so good hearing the great Clarence Clemons blowing that saxophone ‚Äì nobody did it quite like the big man!\n\nOtis Redding/(Sittin‚Äô On) The Dock of the Bay\n\nI don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm ready for some sweet soul music. And when it comes to that genre, nowadays, my first preference tends to be Stax ‚Äì you know, the real good stuff! The Memphis soul label is associated with so many great artists like Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas and Kim Weston. And, of course, Otis Redding, who by the time (Sittin‚Äô On) The Dock of the Bay was released as a single on January 8, 1968, had become the label‚Äôs biggest star. Sadly, he wasn‚Äôt able to witness the huge success of the tune, which became his only no. 1 hit on the U.S. mainstream chart Billboard Hot 100. Only three days earlier, Redding had died in a plane crash at the age of 26. The song, co-written by him and Steve Cropper, the guitarist of Stax killer house band Booker T. & the M.G.‚Äôs, also became the de facto title track of Redding‚Äôs seventh studio album The Dock of the Bay, which he had finished recording two days prior to his untimely death. And, yep, you guessed it correctly, the record also became Redding‚Äôs most successful on the Billboard 200. Life can be so unfair!\n\nDwight Twilley Band/I‚Äôm On Fire\n\nGoing from Otis Redding to the Dwight Twilley Band does seem to be a leap. Who‚Äôs Dwight Twilley anyway? But you see, to borrow from a famous Tom Hanks movie, I‚Äôd like to think of The Sunday Six like a box of chocolate: You never know what you‚Äôre going to get! BTW, had you asked me about Twilley a couple of weeks ago, I would have drawn a blank. Then Spotify served up I‚Äôm On Fire as a listening suggestion. While it perhaps didn‚Äôt set me on fire, I quite liked how this catchy tune rocks. If you don‚Äôt know it, you should give it try. It turned out I‚Äôm On Fire, first released as a single in April 1975, is one of two U.S. top 20 singles Twilley is best known for, according to Wikipedia. The other one is called Girls (1984). I‚Äôm On Fire, written by Twilley, was also included on Sincerely, his debut album released as Dwight Twilley Band. The ‚Äúband‚Äù really was a duo and in addition to Twilley (guitar, piano, lead and harmony vocals) only included his music partner Phil Seymour (drums, bass, percussion, lead and harmony vocals). They released a second studio album in 1977. Each subsequently recorded solo albums. Seymour also sang backing vocals on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers‚Äò tunes American Girl and Breakdown. Twilley still seems to be around. Sadly, Seymour passed away from lymphoma at age 41 in August 1993.\n\nSonny Landreth/Congo Square\n\nTime for a stop-over in the ‚Äô90s before heading to our final destination. If you‚Äôre into guitar-driven blues chances are you‚Äôve heard of Sonny Landreth. If you haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôd encourage you to check out this slide guitarist from Louisiana, who has been active for nearly 50 years and released close to 20 albums under his name. Given his talent, it‚Äôs not surprising he‚Äôs played with the likes of John Hiatt, John Mayall, Mark Knopfler, Gov‚Äôt Mule and Little Feat. Congo Square, which Landreth wrote together with Roy Melton and David Ranson, is a tasty tune from his fourth studio album South of I-10. Released in February 1995, the record marked the first time Landreth collaborated with Knopfler who played guitar on Congo Square and two other tunes. Cool stuff!\n\nDirty Honey/The Wire\n\nLet‚Äôs go out with a great rocker: Gypsy by Dirty Honey. If you‚Äôre a frequent reader of the blog, you may recall me raving about this contemporary rock band from L.A., founded in 2017. I just love their classic rock sound, which reminds me of groups like Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and The Black Crowes. To date, they have released a self-titled EP and debut album, as well as a bunch of singles. The Wire, credited to the band, is from their first album that came out in April 2021. It was also released separately as the third single. Dirty Honey aren‚Äôt reinventing classic rock, but this is kick ass and I love it ‚Äì and that‚Äôs good enough for me!\n\nThis post wouldn‚Äôt be complete without an accompanying Spotify playlist. Hope you‚Äôll find something here you dig!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; Bruce Springsteen website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nThe time has come for a bit of self-promotion, something I usually shy away from. While it‚Äôs not my personality to highlight my accomplishments, I felt the 1000th post on Christian‚Äôs Music Musings warrants an exception.\n\nWhen I started the blog on June 25, 2016, I really had no idea whether I would stick with it. To me, looking back at my early posts feels funny and at times a bit embarrassing. Like with many other things I guess there‚Äôs a learning curve for blogging. I want to believe my writing and the look and feel of the blog have improved over time.\n\nWhile at the end of the day my main goal is to have fun with this blog, I can‚Äôt deny receiving recognition feels reassuring. The stats WordPress provides draw a picture I find encouraging. I realize compared to other fellow bloggers my total numbers remain moderate, but thus far, the long-term trends look promising. Annual traffic of both total views and visitors has grown nicely over the past five years.\n\nThe picture is pretty similar for the numbers of ‚ÄúLikes‚Äù and ‚ÄúComments.‚Äù The latter in particular is what I find most gratifying. I‚Äôd like to take this opportunity again to thank everybody who took the time to read and provide feedback. I enjoy exchanging facts and views, and hope you guys keep the comments coming!\n\nMy best-performing post to date is this piece from January 2018 about Bad Company‚Äôs 2016 album Live At Red Rocks. It has been seen more than 2,000 times and continues to get views ‚Äì sometimes in what looks like random surges. While I‚Äôm not complaining and still stand behind the post, frankly, I don‚Äôt find anything special about it. I can safely say I invested significantly more time and effort in other posts.\n\nFinally, since Christian‚Äôs Music Musings is a blog about a topic that has been a key hobby and passion for most of my life, this post would be incomplete without at least one song, don‚Äôt you agree? I figured the occasion calls for an upbeat tune that has the number 1,000 in the title: Land of 1000 Dances. I guess this is where my nerdy side emerged! üôÇ\n\nWritten by American R&B singer and songwriter Chris Kenner, Land of 1000 Dances was first recorded and released by him in 1962. Wikipedia notes the song mentions the Pony, the Chicken, the Mashed Potatoe, the Alligator and 996 other dances. Just kidding, it‚Äôs actually 16 dances altogether ‚Äì still pretty impressive!\n\nThe original has a slower tempo than the best-known version of the tune by Wilson Pickett I heard first and came to love many years ago. Recorded at the storied FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Ala., Pickett‚Äôs rendition first appeared as a single in July 1966. It was also included on his third studio album The Exciting Wilson Pickett from August of the same year. What a killer version!\n\nAnd since three make a charm, let‚Äôs throw in another cover by the ultimate party group, The J. Geils Band. You just know when Peter Wolf and his bandmates take on a tune like Land of 1000 Dances it‚Äôs gotta be good! A live recording of their cover was included on the compilation Flashback: The Best of the J. Geils Band, which came out in March 1985. Here‚Äôs the official clip. It‚Äôs a perfect live song and The J. Geils Band are the perfect group to deliver it!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube\n\nWelcome to another installment of The Sunday Six, my weekly recurring feature where I stretch out across different genres and different decades to celebrate music I dig, six tracks at a time. This edition features blue-eyed soul/R&B, Americana rock and Stax soul, bookended by two beautiful guitar-driven instrumentals. It touches the ‚Äô60s, ‚Äô70s, ‚Äô80s, ‚Äô90s and 2021.\n\nMarisa Anderson & William Tyler/Hurricane Light\n\nKicking off this post is beautiful instrumental music by Portland, Ore.-based guitarist and composer Marisa Anderson. From her website: Marisa Anderson channels the history of the guitar and stretches the boundaries of tradition. Her deeply original work applies elements of minimalism, electronic music, drone and 20th century classical music to compositions based on blues, jazz, gospel and country music, re-imagining the landscape of American music‚Ä¶Classically trained, she honed her skills playing in country, jazz and circus bands. Originally from Northern California, Anderson dropped out of college at age nineteen to walk across the US and after more than decade of wandering landed in Portland, Oregon, where she currently lives. Hurricane Light is a track from Anderson‚Äôs new album, Lost Futures, which appeared on August 27 and which she recorded together with William Tyler, a fellow guitarist from Nashville, Tenn. I find this music super relaxing. It‚Äôs got a cinematic feel to it, which perhaps isn‚Äôt surprising. Anderson‚Äôs website also notes she writes scores for short films and soundtracks.\n\nBoz Scaggs/Lowdown\n\nLet‚Äôs jump back 45 years to a very cool tune by Boz Scaggs. Lowdown, which features a seductive funky bassline and is smooth at the same time, is from Scaggs‚Äô seventh studio album Silk Degrees released in February 1976. Co-written by Scaggs and then-future Toto co-founder David Paich, the song also became the highest-charting single off the album, climbing to no. 3 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100. In Canada, it peaked at no. 2. It also charted in the UK and Australia. BTW, that neat bassline was played by David Hungate, another soon-to-become original member of Toto. And there was a third musician who would join Paich and Hungate to form Toto the following year, together with Steve Lukather and Bobby Kimball: drummer Jeff Porcaro. Scaggs started his career in 1959 in high school as vocalist in Steve Miller‚Äôs first band The Marksmen. The two musicians continued to play together in a few other groups, including Steve Miller Band. After staying with them for the first two albums, Scaggs secured a recording deal for himself and focused on his solo career. He is still active and has released 19 solo albums to date, the most recent of which, Out of the Blues, appeared in July 2018.\n\nSteve Earle & The Dukes/I Ain‚Äôt Ever Satisfied\n\nWhen my streaming music provider served up I Ain‚Äôt Ever Satisfied the other day, I was immediately hooked. I‚Äôve listened to some of Steve Earle‚Äôs catalog, but there is a lot left for me to explore. I Ain‚Äôt Ever Satisfied, written by Earle, appeared on his sophomore album Exit 0 from May 1987, which he recorded together with his backing band The Dukes. The album placed in the U.S. and Canadian mainstream charts at no. 90 and no. 36, respectively, and earned Earle two 1988 Grammy nominations for Best Male Country Vocalist and Best Country Song. Earle has released 21 studio albums to date, including collaborations with Del McCoury Band and Shawn Colvin. His most recent album J.T., a tribute to his oldest son Justin Townes Earle who passed away from a drug overdose in August 2020, was released in early January this year. I previously reviewed it here.\n\nSon Volt/Driving the View\n\nAlternative country and Americana rock band Son Volt are a recent discovery for me. They entered my radar screen with their latest album Electro Melodier, which came out at the end of July. I featured a tune from it in a previous Best of What‚Äôs New installment. The group around singer-songwriter and guitarist Jay Farrar was formed by him in 1994 after the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, another alt. country outfit he had co-founded in 1987. Son Volt‚Äôs studio debut Trace appeared in September 1995. To date, the band has released 10 albums. In addition to Farrar, the current members include Chris Frame (guitar), Mark Spencer (keyboards, steel guitar), Andrew DuPlantis (bass) and Mark Patterson (drums). Here‚Äôs Driving the View, a great track from Son Volt‚Äôs third studio album Wide Swing Tremolo that appeared in October 1998.\n\nWilson Pickett/In the Midnight Hour\n\nNext we‚Äôre going back to 1965 and Memphis, Tenn. for some sweet soul music recorded at the Stax studio. By the time Atlantic recording artist Wilson Pickett recorded In the Midnight Hour, Stax founder Jim Stewart had signed a formal national distribution deal with Atlantic Records, a contract that would come to haunt him when Atlantic Records was sold to Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1967 and Stax would lose the rights to all Atlantic-distributed recordings between 1960 and 1967. Coming back to a happier subject, In the Midnight Hour was co-written by Pickett and guitarist Steve Cropper, a founding member of Stax house band Booker T. & the M.G.s, who also was the label‚Äôs A&R man. M.G.s members Al Jackson Jr. (drums) and Donald ‚ÄúDuck‚Äù Dunn (bass) participated in the recording session. In the Midnight Hour, which appeared in June 1965, also was the title track of Pickett‚Äôs sophomore album released the same year. The tune became Pickett‚Äôs first no. 1 on Billboard‚Äôs R&B singles chart and his highest charting song at the time on the mainstream Billboard Hot 100, where it reached no. 21. Just a timeless soul classic!\n\nRobben Ford/A Dragon Tail\n\nFor the last track in this installment, we‚Äôre going back to the present time and a killer instrumental by guitarist extraordinaire Robben Ford, off his new album Pure that came out on August 27. Ford, who began playing the saxophone at age 10 before he discovered the guitar as a 13-year-old, has had a remarkable career. He has collaborated with Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, George Harrison, Charlie Musselwhite, Larry Carlton and Little Feat, among many others. His solo debut Schizophonic, a jazz album, came out in 1976. Ford has since released close to 30 additional records under his name. This doesn‚Äôt include any of his collaboration albums. While primarily being associated with blues, Ford has played many other genres, including jazz, rock and funk. He has been nominated for five Grammys and was named one of the ‚Äú100 Greatest Guitarists of the 20th Century‚Äù by trade publication Musician magazine that folded in 1999. Here‚Äôs A Dragon Tail from Ford‚Äôs above mentioned new album. Check out this amazing sound!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Marissa Anderson website; YouTube\n\nThis is the third and final part of this mini-series featuring songs related to planes, trains and automobiles. Parts I and II focused on planes and trains. This leaves automobiles.\n\nIn case you missed the two previous installments, the theme of the mini series was inspired by the 1987 American comedy picture Planes, Trains and Automobiles. The film is about a marketing executive (Steve Martin) and a sweet but annoying traveling sales guy (John Candy) ending up together as they are trying to get from New York home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. Their plane‚Äôs diversion to Wichita due to bad weather in Chicago starts a three-day odyssey and one misadventure after the other, while the two, seemingly incompatible men use different modes of transportation to get to their destination.\n\nChuck Berry/Maybellene\n\nI couldn‚Äôt think of a better way to start this final installment of the mini-series than with a car chase told by Chuck Berry in a classic rock & roll tune. Credited to him, Russ Fratto and Alan Freed, and partially adapted from a Western swing fiddle tune titled Ida Red, the song tells the tale of a guy in a V8 Ford, chasing after his unfaithful girlfriend Maybellene who is driving a Cadillac Coupe de Ville. Initially released as a single in July 1955, Maybellene became Berry‚Äôs first hit, reaching no. 1 on Billboard‚Äôs Rhythm & Blues chart and no. 5 on the mainstream Hot 100 chart. The tune is an early example of Berry‚Äôs gift to write lyrics that appealed to both young African American and young white people. Maybellene also became part of the soundtrack of the motion picture Rock, Rock, Rock! from December 1956, and was included on Berry‚Äôs third studio album Chuck Berry Is on Top. The latter might as well have been titled ‚ÄúThe Greatest Hits of Classic Rock & Roll.‚Äù\n\nThe Beach Boys/409\n\nThe Beach Boys released various car-related tunes in the ‚Äô60s. I guess hot rods and surfing made for good friends. Here‚Äôs one of my favorites: 409. Songfacts notes 409 refers to a Chevrolet Bel Air 409 sport coup√©, a 360-horsepower beast that with some tuning could be boosted to more than 400 horsepower. If you‚Äôre into cars, you can view some images here. Co-written by Brian Wilson, Mike Love and Gary Usher, the tune first appeared in June 1962 as the B-side to the band‚Äôs second single Surfin‚Äô Safari. It was also included on two studio albums: Surfin‚Äô Safari, The Beach Boys‚Äô debut record from October 1962, and Little Deuce Coupe, their fourth studio release that came out in October 1963 and featured car songs. Giddy up, giddy up 409!\n\nWilson Pickett/Mustang Sally\n\nThe first time I heard Mustang Sally and fell in love with the tune was in the 1991 music comedy picture The Commitments, which not only is hilarious but also features outstanding Stax style soul ‚Äì a film I can highly recommend. Originally, the song was written and first recorded by Mack Rice in 1965. But it wasn‚Äôt until the following year when Wilson Pickett released a cover that popularized the song, taking it to no. 6 and no. 23 on the U.S. Billboard R&B and Hot 100 charts, respectively. The tune was also included on Pickett‚Äôs 1967 studio album The Wicked Pickett.\n\nGolden Earring/Radar Love\n\nWhen it comes to ‚Äô70s car songs, the ones that always come to my mind first are Deep Purple‚Äôs Highway Star and Golden Earring‚Äôs Radar Love. I decided to go with the Dutch rock band, which included the tune on their ninth studio album Moontan from July 1973. Co-written by their guitarist and lead vocalist George Kooymans and Barry Hay, respectively, Radar Love became Golden Earring‚Äôs most successful song. It hit no. 1 in the Netherlands, reached the top 10 in the UK and various other European countries, and climbed to no. 13 in the U.S. If you‚Äôre stickler, the one thing that isn‚Äôt clear is whether the driver in the song is in a car or in a truck. For the purposes of this post, let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs the former. And since I‚Äôm not fooling around with any single edits, here‚Äôs the 6:26-minute LP version. It‚Äôs a hell of a rock tune that deserves to be heard in its full length.\n\nBruce Springsteen/Ramrod\n\nLet finish with The Boss and what I feel is more of a deep cut from The River, especially when considering this album also includes tunes like The Ties That Bind, Sherry Darling, Independence Day, Hungry Heart and, of course, the title track. This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Ramrod is a great song. There‚Äôs a reason why it has remained a staple during Bruce Springsteen concerts. Springsteen originally wrote and recorded Ramrod for Darkness on the Edge of Town but didn‚Äôt use it until The River album, which was released in October 1980. I dig the tune‚Äôs 60s garage rock vibe. Let‚Äôs go ramroddin‚Äô!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nIs it really Sunday again? It is. Crazy how time seems to be flying. On the upside, Sunday is fun day and time for my favorite recurring feature. I think I‚Äôve put together another set of six tunes that celebrates the beauty of music in its different flavors. Hope you enjoy it!\n\nHenry Mancini/The Pink Panther Theme\n\nLong before I had ever heard of Peter Sellers, Inspector Jacques Closeau and The Pink Panther movies, I was familiar with The Pink Panther Theme. That‚Äôs because I watched the cartoon series as a child growing up in Germany. I always loved the instrumental theme, which was composed by Henry Mancini in 1963 for the first movie in the series titled The Pink Panther. When that track came to my mind the other day, I figured it would be great to feature one of the coolest jazz instrumentals I know in a Sunday Six installment. Apart from being included in the film‚Äôs soundtrack album, The Pink Panther Theme also became a top 10 single in the U.S. on Billboard‚Äôs Adult Contemporary chart, then known as Middle Road Singles. And it won three Grammy Awards. Undoubtedly, the standout is the tenor saxophone solo played by American soul-jazz and hard bop tenor saxophonist Plas Johnson who is still alive at 89 years.\n\nSolomon Burke/A Change Is Gonna Come\n\nSolomon Burke may not have enjoyed the chart success of peers like James Brown, Wilson Pickett or Otis Redding, but he still is considered to be one of the founding fathers of soul music in the ‚Äô60s. Atlantic Records‚Äô Jerry Wexler called him ‚Äúthe greatest male soul singer of all time.‚Äù Burke was also known as ‚ÄúKing Solomon‚Äù, the ‚ÄúKing of Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Soul‚Äù, ‚ÄúBishop of Soul‚Äù and the ‚ÄúMuhammad Ali of Soul‚Äù. No matter what you want to call him, there‚Äôs no doubt that Burke was an amazing vocalist, and I got a powerful example to illustrate my point: His amazing rendition of A Change Is Gonna Come, which has literally brought me to tears. The tune was written by Sam Cooke and first appeared on his final studio album Ain‚Äôt That Good News from February 1966, 10 months prior to his mysterious death from a gun shot at a Los Angeles motel in December 1964. Burke who passed away in October 2010 recorded A Change Is Gonna Come as the title track of a studio album that appeared 1986. If you haven‚Äôt heard this cover, you need to check it out. It‚Äôs incredibly moving!\n\nCurtis Mayfield/Move On Up\n\nAt the time I decided to feature the previous Solomon Burke tune, I also thought of Move On Up by Curtis Mayfield. Then I saw fellow blogger Music Enthusiast featured the same song earlier this week in one of his posts and considered scrapping it. When I told him, Music Enthusiast encouraged me to keep it, saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great song that shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten and deserves the widest audience possible.‚Äù He‚Äôs right. Move On Up is the title track of Mayfield‚Äôs debut solo album Curtis, which came out in September 1970. Addressing challenges faced by many African Americans, the album was somewhat comparable to Marvin Gaye‚Äôs What‚Äôs Going On, except it predated Gaye‚Äôs seminal record by eight months. Move On Up, which like all other tracks on the record was written by Mayfield, appeals to listeners not to let obstacles get in the way to pursue dreams and make the best of life. As such, the tune has a more upbeat message than some of the other darker tracks on the album. Sometimes, I can get a bit impatient when it comes to long songs. Not so in this case where I love each and every second of the 8:49 minutes: The horns, the congas, the cool bass line, Mayfield‚Äôs falsetto vocals ‚Äì it‚Äôs just perfect!\n\nJean-Michel Jarre/Oxyg√®ne (Part IV)\n\nLet‚Äôs continue with the idea of moving up. Way up. All the way to outer space. To those who have followed my blog for a long time and have witnessed my occasional criticism of ‚Äúartificial music‚Äù that is ‚Äúgenerated by computers,‚Äù the selection of Jean-Michel Jarre may come as a bit of a surprise. After all, we‚Äôre talking electronic music that‚Äôs entirely generated by synthesizers. Not even the drums are real. So what‚Äôs up with that seemingly contradictory pick? Well, perhaps Jarre is the exception that proves my rule! üôÇ It‚Äôs simple. I‚Äôve always had a thing for space music and Oxyg√®ne, Jarre‚Äôs third studio album released in December 1976, is exactly that. The best way to listen to this album is with headphones. The sound effects are just amazing, and before you know it, you feel like floating in space. I‚Äôve listened to this music countless times to fall asleep. Here‚Äôs the best known track from the album, Oxyg√®ne (Part IV). It also appeared separately and became the most successful single of Jarre‚Äôs still-ongoing recording career, topping the charts in Spain and reaching the top 10 in various other European countries and in New Zealand. Happy floating!\n\nH√©roes del Silencio/Entre dos tierras\n\nH√©roes del Silencio were a Spanish rock band from Zaragoza. They were formed as Zumo de Vidrio in 1984 by guitarist Juan Valdivia and vocalist Enrique Bunbury. Bassist Joaqu√≠n Cardiel and drummer Pedro Andreu completed the line-up of the band, which in 1985 changed their name to H√©roes del Silencio. The group‚Äôs debut EP H√©roe de Leyenda from 1987 was followed by full-length debut album El Mar No Cesa, which came out in October 1988. The breakthrough came with sophomore studio release Senderos de traici√≥n from May 1990. It topped the charts in Spain and reached no. 17 in Germany. Altogether, H√©roes del Silencio recorded four studio and various live and compilation albums before they disbanded in 1996. In 2007, as part of a 20th anniversary celebration, the band organized a 10-concert world tour. Entre dos tierras, credited to all members of the group, is the opener to their aforementioned sophomore album. While it‚Äôs the only H√©roes del Silencio tune I know, I‚Äôve always liked its amazing sound.\n\nThe Who/Success Story\n\nI guess we‚Äôve already reached the point again when it‚Äôs time to wrap up. Let‚Äôs do so with another rocker: Success Story by The Who. The track from their seventh studio album The Who by Numbers from October 1975 may not be the most popular or best tune by The Who. But when I coincidentally stumbled across the song the other day, I immediately earmarked it for a Sunday Six. Notably, it‚Äôs one of the few tunes written by John Entwistle. I also dig the lyrics, which Songfacts calls ‚Äúa cynical autobiography of The Who.‚Äù Songfacts further notes, The line, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your fairy manager‚Äù is an allusion to The Who‚Äôs gay manager Kit Lambert, who they were in the process of suing. Referring to a preacher becoming a rock musician, Entwistle also poked fun at Pete Townshend who followed Indian spiritual master Meher Baba and included spirituality in his songs. Perhaps most importantly, this song simply rocks and is bloody catchy!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube"
