        "text": "Evaluation and Management of Testosterone Deficiency (2024)\n\nPanel Members\n\nJohn P. Mulhall, MD; Landon W. Trost, MD; Robert E. Brannigan, MD; Emily G. Kurtz, MD; J. Bruce Redmon, MD; Kelly A. Chiles, MD, MSc; Deborah J. Lightner, MD; Martin M. Miner, MD; M. Hassan Murad, MD, MPH; Christian J. Nelson, PhD; Elizabeth A. Platz, ScD, MPH; Lakshmi V. Ramanathan, PhD; Ronald W. Lewis, MD\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nWhere gaps in the evidence existed, the Panel provides guidance in the form of Clinical Principles or Expert Opinion with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique if differences of opinion emerged. A Clinical Principle is a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature. Expert Opinion refers to a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there is no evidence.\n\nFor additional information on the challenges associated with reviewing the literature on testosterone deficiency, refer to the Appendix A section in the left menu.\n\nTable 1: AUA Nomenclature\n\nTable 2: Dosing Profiles of Testosterone Formulations\n\nTable 3: Prevalence of Testosterone Deficiency\n\nTable 4: Assays for the Diagnosis of Testosterone Deficiency\n\nDiagnosis\n\nGuideline Statement 1\n\n1. Clinicians should use a total testosterone level below 300 ng/dL as a reasonable cut-off in support of the diagnosis of low testosterone. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 2\n\n2. The diagnosis of low testosterone should be made only after two total testosterone measurements are taken on separate occasions with both conducted in an early morning fashion. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 3\n\nDiscussion and Table 5\n\nGuideline Statement 4\n\n4. Clinicians should consider measuring total testosterone in patients with a history of unexplained anemia, bone density loss, diabetes, exposure to chemotherapy, exposure to testicular radiation, HIV/AIDS, chronic narcotic use, male infertility, pituitary dysfunction, and chronic corticosteroid use even in the absence of symptoms or signs associated with testosterone deficiency. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 5\n\nDiscussion\n\nAdjunctive Testing\n\nGuideline Statement 6\n\n6. In patients with low testosterone, clinicians should measure serum luteinizing hormone levels. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 7\n\n7. Serum prolactin levels should be measured in patients with low testosterone levels combined with low or low/normal luteinizing hormone levels. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 8\n\n8. Patients with persistently high prolactin levels of unknown etiology should undergo evaluation for endocrine disorders. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 9\n\n9. Serum estradiol should be measured in testosterone deficient patients who present with breast symptoms or gynecomastia prior to the commencement of testosterone therapy. (Expert Opinion)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 10\n\n10. Men with testosterone deficiency who are interested in fertility should have a reproductive health evaluation performed prior to treatment. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 11\n\n11. Prior to offering testosterone therapy, clinicians should measure hemoglobin and hematocrit and inform patients regarding the increased risk of polycythemia. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 12\n\n12. PSA should be measured in men over 40 years of age prior to commencement of testosterone therapy to exclude a prostate cancer diagnosis. (Clinical Principle)\n\nDiscussion\n\nCounseling Regarding Treatment of Testosterone Deficiency\n\nGuideline Statement 13\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 14\n\n14. Patients should be informed that testosterone therapy may result in improvements in erectile function, low sex drive, anemia, bone mineral density, lean body mass, and/or depressive symptoms. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 15\n\n15. Patients should be informed that the evidence is inconclusive whether testosterone therapy improves cognitive function, measures of diabetes, energy, fatigue, lipid profiles, and quality of life measures. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 16\n\n16. The long-term impact of exogenous testosterone on spermatogenesis should be discussed with patients who are interested in future fertility. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 17\n\n17. Clinicians should inform patients of the absence of evidence linking testosterone therapy to the development of prostate cancer. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 18\n\n18. Patients with testosterone deficiency and a history of prostate cancer should be informed that there is inadequate evidence to quantify the risk-benefit ratio of testosterone therapy. (Expert Opinion)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 19\n\n19. Patients should be informed that there is no definitive evidence linking testosterone therapy to a higher incidence of venothrombolic events. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 20\n\n20. Prior to initiating treatment, clinicians should counsel patients that, at this time, it cannot be stated definitively whether testosterone therapy increases or decreases the risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular-related death, all-cause mortality). (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 21\n\n21. All men with testosterone deficiency should be counseled regarding lifestyle modifications as a treatment strategy. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nTreatment of Testosterone Deficiency\n\nGuideline Statement 22\n\n22. Clinicians should adjust testosterone therapy dosing to achieve a total testosterone level in the middle tertile of the normal reference range. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 23\n\n23. Exogenous testosterone therapy should not be prescribed to men who are currently trying to conceive. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 24\n\n24. Testosterone therapy should not be commenced for a period of three to six months in patients with a history of cardiovascular events. (Expert Opinion)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 25\n\n25. Clinicians should not prescribe alkylated oral testosterone. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 26\n\n26. Clinicians should discuss the risk of transference with patients using testosterone gels/creams. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 27\n\n27. Clinicians may use aromatase inhibitors, human chorionic gonadotropin, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or a combination thereof in men with testosterone deficiency desiring to maintain fertility. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)\n\nDiscussion and Table 6\n\nGuideline Statement 28\n\n28. Commercially manufactured testosterone products should be prescribed rather than compounded testosterone, when possible. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)\n\nDiscussion\n\nFollow-Up of Men on Testosterone Therapy\n\nGuideline Statement 29\n\n29. Clinicians should measure an initial follow-up total testosterone level after an appropriate interval to ensure that target testosterone levels have been achieved. (Expert Opinion)\n\nDiscussion\n\nGuideline Statement 30\n\n30. Testosterone levels should be measured every 6-12 months while on testosterone therapy. (Expert Opinion)\n\nDiscussion and Table 7\n\nGuideline Statement 31\n\n31. Clinicians should discuss the cessation of testosterone therapy three to six months after commencement of treatment in patients who experience normalization of total testosterone levels but fail to achieve symptom or sign improvement.
