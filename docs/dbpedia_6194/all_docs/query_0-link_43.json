        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis study provides evidence that maternal occupational exposure during pregnancy to estimated concentrations of EDC – as classified by application of a JEM – is associated with significantly increased risk of impaired fetal growth. In particular, mothers exposed to pesticides were three to five times more likely to have an infant with suboptimal fetal growth as measured by POBW<85 and SGA respectively, and mothers exposed to phthalates were about three times more likely to have a baby with inadequate fetal growth measured by POBW<85. Maternal exposure to ALP was associated with a non-significant but increased risk of inadequate fetal growth as measured by SGA and POBW<85.\n\nThis study also demonstrated disproportionate exposure to EDC with personal risk factors in women. In general, women who were exposed to EDC were more likely to be Caucasian British, less educated, done work involving prolonged standing or physical effort and worked as skilled trades, personal service, machine operators and elementary occupations.\n\nThe study has several strengths primarily due to the large amount and detail of data available. The prospective design minimises recall bias, and selection bias was minimised by the 80% participation rate to the mid-pregnancy. Detailed information was collected about individual maternal characteristics and information obtained on chemical exposures through JEM, which enabled adjustment for potential confounders including adjustment for exposures to individual EDC in order to minimise the effect of possible confounding. The classification of EDC exposures was assessed independently and prior to knowledge of the outcomes by a recently updated JEM developed specifically to assess the association between occupational exposures to EDC and birth outcomes, thus information bias was largely eliminated. We were able to evaluate the effect of several EDC exposures on two different criteria for inadequate fetal growth.\n\nIn this study, we used POBW<85 as an indicator of inadequate intrauterine growth that is less dependent on the health of the reference population or the quality of their morphometric data than is percentile position on a birth weight distribution. The method uses optimal rather than expected growth as the standard and reports the ratio of the observed birth dimension to the optimal birth dimension rather than as being above or below a specified position of the population distribution of that dimension, avoiding the problems inherent in the use of percentile position.\n\nThe availability of job titles, the detailed information on work tasks or activities routinely performed, type of business and information about when the mother worked during her pregnancy has reduced non-differential misclassification of exposure and enabled a more accurate assessment of occupational exposures compared with studies with access only to job titles.\n\nWe validated the job title coding to get a more accurate code for each job title, so the potential for observer bias in the coding of occupational title status was minimised, improving the reliability and validity of the coded job titles. The risk for each category of EDC was estimated, rather than several EDC categories combined, allowing any differences between categories to be observed. Finally, JEM-based assessments of risk of exposures to chemical agents are more reliable than self-reported assessments (17).\n\nA limitation was that individual exposures were not measured. However, Vandenberg et al (44), has reviewed the dose–response between endocrine disrupters and various health outcomes and the possibility of non-monotonic dose–responses. As stated by Vandenberg: “the endocrine system evolved to function when unbound physiologically active ligand (hormones) are present at extremely low doses”, “EDCs that mimic natural hormones have been proposed to follow the same rules and therefore have biological effects at low doses” (44, page 8). Another limitation is that the cells of JEM represent exposure probabilities, which are only a crude measure of exposure, so it needs to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the JEM does not consider specific chemicals but only broad groups thereof, and the mechanisms of action can vary between specific chemicals in a group (34). In this study, we reported the specific chemicals identified within each broad group of pesticides, phthalates and alkylphenolic compounds, but it was not possible to distinguish the role of each specific chemicals in their broad groups in the observed lower fetal growth rate. There is also a possibility of overlap between the categories of phthalates and alkyphenolic compounds among exposed mothers, so it was not possible to separate the specific role of each of these chemicals in inadequate fetal growth rate. Finally, too few mothers were exposed to some of EDC such as polychlorinated organic compounds, bisphenol A, and flame-retardants to allow evaluation of their associations with our outcomes. Exposure to the miscellaneous category had a protective effect, but due to small number of exposed people, the CI was very large, (95% CI 0.05–0.60) so the results should be interpreted with caution. Large CI were also observed in the results of occupational groups in . There might be a risk of type 2 errors due to small samples of those exposed to some of EDC. However, for other EDC our results are compatible with those of previous similar studies (4, 16, 17), enhancing their credibility as well as our own.\n\nThis study introduces another approach (fetal growth measured by percentage of optimal birth weight) for defining adequacy of growth in assessing the effects of chemical exposures compared to other published studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the risk of inadequate fetal growth as measured by POBW<85 was significantly elevated following possible or probable maternal occupational exposures to one or more classes of EDC, particularly pesticides and phthalates. A recent study in the Generation R cohort using the same JEM found that occupational exposures to pesticides and phthalates during pregnancy were significantly associated with reduced placental weight and fetal length as estimated by ultrasounds and reduced fetal weight following mother’s exposures to phthalates and PAHs (16). Another study from Generation R cohort using the same JEM concluded that maternal occupational exposure to phthalates and pesticides was associated with adverse effects on fertility and pregnancy outcomes (17). A meta-analysis from a European large-scale prospective study using the same JEM also suggests that pregnant women classified as exposed to multiple EDC, including pesticides and phthalates, were at significantly higher risk of term low birth weight newborns in cohorts throughout Europe (4). Our finding in regard to non-significant association between POBW<85 as a measure of fetal growth and maternal exposure to ALP is in line with a recent study in the Generation R cohort using the same JEM in assessing occupational exposure to chemicals and fetal growth as measured by reduced fetal weight estimated from ultrasound-fetometry (16). Our finding about a significant association between maternal exposure to pesticides and SGA is supported by several studies (45–47). However, epidemiological studies on the effect of exposures to endocrine disrupters on pregnancy outcomes are not always consistent, warranting further research into this important topic. For example, the affected occupations associated with exposures to pesticides in this study were those classified as veterinary nurses and horticultural trades and, to phthalates, hairdressers, beauticians, and printing machine minders. The findings in the present study concerning exposure to pesticides and phthalates in hairdressers and agricultural activities and having infants with inadequate fetal growth is in accordance with previous findings (16, 17, 48–50). However, there were some studies in agricultural activities and among hairdressers that show conflicting results (51–54).\n\nThere is limited research evaluating the occupational and personal characteristics of women associated with occupational exposures to EDC. Evaluation of the influence of both occupational and personal risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, age, marital status, ethnic origin, education, BMI, socio-economic status) would help to improve our understanding of health hazards and develop a comprehensive preventive approach to achieve a longer, healthy working life. Unequal exposure to occupational exposure acting as EDC is an under-recognized risk factor that may play an important role in deriving the higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes among those affected populations.\n\nHuman development is most vulnerable to toxic substances and endocrine disruption in the early embryonic period. The restricted fetal growth associated with exposure to pesticides and phthalates during pregnancy is an important public health concern because restricted fetal growth is linked to adverse health later in life such as coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension (55). It is therefore important to identify occupation-related risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Further larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and identify potential targets for prevention. Until then, precautionary prevention and control management of risks to health and safety at the workplace are recommended. In general, the precautions to be taken for the protection of the reproductive health of both women and men will not differ from the safeguarding of all workers. A national priority of supporting research on occupational causes of adverse reproductive outcomes recommended.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nConsistent with the results of other studies, this prospective birth cohort study provides evidence that occupational exposure to pesticides and phthalates may play a role in the etiology of inadequate fetal growth and SGA infants."
