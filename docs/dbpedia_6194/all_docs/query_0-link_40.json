James Franklin Pickett, sometimes known as J.F., but usually just called \"Frank,\" came into this world in a cabin near Ringo, Oklahoma in what was then Indian Territory. One of the Pickett's closest neighbors was an Indian named Jacob Dick. According to Ruby O. (Pickett McElroy), Frank told her that when he was still very small, he became quite ill and was sent to Missouri to live with James Monroe and Mary Catherine Pickett, his paternal grandparents. There he stayed till he was eight years old, when his parents moved back to western Missouri. His grandmother passed away in 1907 and Frank returned to his parents. GWDP and Ruby O. Pickett McElroy). 1\n\n#2. The family moved several times while Frank was growing up. They settled in the Hartford, Kansas vicinity and lived on farms near Ottumwa and Strawn. Evidently, Frank and his father did not always get along too well, and Frank ran away from home when he was twelve. He went to Holly, Colorado to live with his Uncle Bob Pickett (Robert, brother of William Monroe). He also worked on ranches in southern Colorado, New Mexico and Oklahoma in his mid teen years. He returned home to Hartford when he was sixteen but didn't immediately go to his parents. He told Ruby that he passed his mother on the street in Hartford and she did not recognize him. For the next few years he worked on farms and ranches in the Flint Hills region of east central Kansas. (As related by Ruby O. Pickett McElroy). 1\n\n#3. In 1919 Frank met, fell in love, and on Valentine's Day of 1920, married Hazel Ruth McCullough, daughter of a prominent farmer from south of Hartford. The very handsome Frank and the very beautiful Hazel made a striking couple and seemed set for a lifetime of bliss. For the next 17 years they lived in Hartford; Decatur, Illinois; Iola, Kansas and, probably, other places. Frank had a formal education of about three years schooling and it was not easy to find decent paying permanent work in those years. He took to leaving home for a few days, or a few weeks, either by himself or with one or two of the older children. Over the next years, his stays increased in length. Finally, in 1938, Frank took Bud and Perk and left for Missouri. He did not return. The boys, however, did return to their mother. (Re: GWDP). 1\n\n#4. Frank roamed Missouri, Illinois, Colorado and Kansas for some years. He married a very nice lady named Pearl Dunne in the late thirties and stayed with her for several years. By the mid-forties he was again footloose. He met Ruby O. Logsdon in Decatur, Illinios and they were soon married and began a whole new family of six children. He and Ruby lived primarily in Illinois till Frank's death in 1966. Daughters Ruby Belle, Marcy and Sarah, as well as Bud, all confirm that Frank was very talented in several areas and capable of hard work. He left a deep impression on those who knew him. (See the booklet \"Frank\" written by Ruby O. Pickett and George Wm. Darrell Pickett). (Also, see \"The History of Cynthia Belle Hellyer\" as told to Virginia Albert.). 1\n\nSources\n\n↑ Source: #S1\n\n↑ Source: #S58\n\n↑ Source: #S81 Record for James F.
