        "text": "'The story of Marlion Pickett is one of tumult and pain and uplift - yet also endurance, and stoicism. And that makes Belief not merely inspiring but instructive, too. With colour and heart, Dave Warner expertly sketches his softly spoken subject, and tells one of those rare athletic tales from which we can all learn, and through which footy - sport in general, for that matter - can transcend itself.'\n\n– Konrad Marshall\n\n''Inspirational' is an over-used word, but it should be kept in reserve for a story like Marlion Pickett's. Here is someone who didn't rise above disadvantage so much as discover his true self and remain true to it through trials and obstacles that are foreign to most Australians. Reading Marlion's story, it is comforting to know that there is a happy football ending - the 2019 grand final which concludes the book, then more premiership glory and an authentic career as an AFL star. But even without that knowledge, Marlion has set an example for anyone who loses hope in a better future. Yes - inspirational.'\n\n– Malcolm Knox"
