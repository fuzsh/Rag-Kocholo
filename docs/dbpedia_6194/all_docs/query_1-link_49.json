        "text": "Biography\n\nBill joined the Navy in December of 1965. He served on the USS Constellation CVA-64 as part of the catapult crew (last man under the planes prior to launch). Bill was proud of his service, following a long line of patriotism. His family has fought in every war and major conflict of the USA, including the French and Indian War of 1754.\n\nAfter his Vietnam service he began a 41-year career as an electrical lineman with San Diego Gas and Electric and ending with Avista Utilities headquartered in Washington state as a regional manager. Kidney disease began with his first exposure to Agent Orange while launching spray planes during his service on the USS Constellation. Cardiac issues were identified by the completion of his naval service. Accumulating complications of Agent Orange exposure forced an early retirement from his electrical career by 2011.\n\nHe lost his battle of deteriorating health with 18 agent orange diagnoses. None of the soldiers understood the ramifications of Agent Orange during their service. Bill told his family in his last days of life, “If I had known then what I know now about Agent Orange, I would still have served proudly.”"
