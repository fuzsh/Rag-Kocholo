        "text": "This page contains a list of contact information for interpreters who have met the standards to be designated as certified or registered interpreters in Tennessee. A CERTIFIED interpreter has passed all interpreter tests. A REGISTERED interpreter has not completed the final test. The purpose of the roster is to help courts and other law-related agencies find credentialed court interpreters on a freelance basis. The fact that an interpreter is listed on the roster does not indicate an employment relationship with the Tennessee Supreme Court or any circuit, chancery, general sessions, juvenile or municipal court. Court interpreters are not employees of the State of Tennessee.\n\nLocating an interpreter is easy to do. You can find an interpreter by the language desired; by a location (county) or by level of certification (certified/registered). You can also use a combination of these options. For example:\n\nIf you would like to locate a Certified Spanish interpreter, simply select ‘Spanish’ as the language and select ‘Certified’ as the credential. Press the ‘Apply’ button and a list of certified interpreters will be provided alphabetically by the city of residence.\n\nIf you would like to locate an Arabic Interpreter located in Middle TN, select ‘Arabic’ as the language and select ‘Middle TN’ for availability. Press the ‘Apply’ button and a list of Arabic interpreters in Middle TN will be provided.\n\nIf you would like a list of all interpreters in Memphis, enter ‘Shelby’ as the county and press the ‘Apply’ button.\n\nClick here for information about interpreters for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing\n\nIf there are no interpreters listed for your chosen language, please contact the Administrative Office of the Courts at 615-741-2687 for assistance."
