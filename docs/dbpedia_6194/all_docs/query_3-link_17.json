It is considered the holiest day of the Jewish sacred calendar.\n\nOctober\n\nOctober | LGBTQ+ History Month\n\nLGBTQ+ History Month honors members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities on Whittier Campus and beyond.

Over the centuries, Diwali has become a national festival that is also enjoyed by non-Hindu communities.\n\nNovember 20 | Transgender Day of Remembrance\n\nThis day honors the memory of the transgender people whose lives were lost in acts of anti-transgender violence.

The time is used to acknowledge the historical contributions of women in the United States.\n\nMarch 11 | Start of Ramadan\n\nRamadan is a month of fasting, prayer, and reflection observed by Muslims worldwide.

They are organized, planned, and coordinated by students.\n\nJune\n\nJune | Pride Month\n\nIn honor of 1969’s Stonewall Rebellion — which many consider the start of the modern LGBTQ+ movement — the month pays tribute to the progress of LGBTQ+ history and civil rights.\n\nJune 19 | Juneteenth\n\nJuneteenth marks the day when federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865, to take control of the state and ensure that all enslaved people were freed.
