L. Pickett, M. D., is a native of Wisconsin, born in Harford, December 24, 1861, son of Samuel H. and Eliza (Multer) Pickett. The father was a native of Cattaraugus County, New York, and was a carpenter by trade. He came westward to Wisconsin in the early days and settled in Milwaukee County, and later in Hartford, Washington County, remaining there until 1872. In that year he came to Clark county, Wisconsin, and took up land, which he broke and improved. Samuel H. Pickett still continues to live on the old homestead.\n\nSamuel L. attended the common schools of Wisconsin, receiving his education in the winter months and assisting his father to clear land during the summer. He remained with his father until attaining his majority and then started teaching school. During his first year of teaching he took up the study of medicine, and after teaching two years he attended the Minnesota Hospital College for one year, afterward teaching again for a similar period. He then went to the Keokuk College of Physicians and Surgeons two years, graduating with honors in 1888.\n\nHe at once started the practice of his profession in Wilson. His skill, his personality and his social qualities rapidly obtained recognition, and he now has a very large practice, owning a well-equipped office a beautiful home, being a fine type of a well-to-do country physician.\n\nHe also makes a hobby of an artificial lake near Wilson, which he keeps supplied with spring water and stocked with game fish. The villages of Wilson and Hersey are supplied with ice taken from this lake.\n\nDr. Pickett was married in November, 1888, to Mary Hatch, daughter of Edwin and Eliza (Foster) Hatch, early settlers of Waukesha county and later of Dunn county, who later came to Wilson and passed away. This union has been blessed with three children: Edwin, Alta and Marion. Dr. Pickett belongs to the Hudson Lodge, Independent Order of Foresters; Hersey Lodge, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and Wilson Lodge, Modern Woodmen of America. He is also a member of the county, state and American medical societies. A Democrat in politics he has served as chairman of the township of Springfield.\n\nHis large practice necessitates the keeping of two teams and an auto, and he is regarded as one of the leading physicians of the county. Socially, Dr. and Mrs. Pickett occupy an enviable position in the community, and they are always leaders in every effort for the betterment of the neighborhood. They are worshipers at the Methodist church at Wilson.\n\n*Eliza Multer, mother of Samuel L., was born 24 Sep 1834 in Ashford, Cattaraugus County, New York(6) and died 12 Jan 1920 in Unity, Clark Co WI at age 85.\n\n**Dr Samuel L.
