Burdens have not received the political, policy, or research priority that is commensurate with their magnitude or impact on individuals. We conclude by arguing that we need a coherent language and framework to recognize and, where appropriate, reduce burdens across a wide array of policy domains.\n\nsocial safety net\n\nadministrative burdens\n\nwelfare state\n\nPolicy debates often (and rightly) center on what people need. What resources, protections, or supports are most critical in their daily lives? We have seen successful policy changes to broaden access to health insurance, college, childcare, special education supports, affordable housing, and other safety net supports. What good are these policies, however, if we cannot access the benefits associated with them?\n\nThe gap between people’s needs and the policies that are supposed to provide for them is filled with administrative burdens. Administrative burdens are rooted in laws, organizational rules, and everyday implementation practices. Burdens are a barrier to limit access to everything from formal citizenship to voting rights to the resources required to enjoy social rights, such as education, housing, and health care. Burdens also emerge in the state use of coercive power in contexts such as the criminal legal system, or child protective services (Edwards et al. 2023, this volume, issue 5). Across these and other venues, burdens tend to fall more heavily on more marginalized groups, undermining their claim to citizenship rights. Further, burdens are often not just a result of inattention or lack of capacity, but also the product of deliberate design.\n\nTo take one example, encouraged by the Donald Trump administration, Arkansas added a (now defunct) work reporting requirement to its Medicaid program with claims that it would boost employment. Such gains never emerged. Instead, more than eighteen thousand people lost health insurance coverage. One study estimated that an astonishing 95 percent of those who lost coverage were still eligible because they were working or should have been exempted from the work requirement (Sommers et al. 2019; Sommers et al. 2020; Wagner and Schubel 2020). Many were unaware of the new requirements. Those who attempted to report work faced a cumbersome process, including an online-only documentation system that proved difficult to navigate. The impact of these changes was both substantial and unevenly distributed. Racial disproportionalities in the Arkansas Medicaid program made Black program beneficiaries particularly vulnerable (Sommers et al. 2019). Black people make up roughly 15 percent of the state population but 26 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries. More than 47 percent of Black Arkansans rely on Medicaid relative to 25 percent of their White counterparts. As a result, the large-scale loss of Medicaid coverage sparked by work reporting requirements had implications for racial inequity (Michener 2020).\n\nThis example illustrates the relevance of our central argument: we need to shift attention from policy potential and promises to concrete access. Understanding the origins, experience, and consequences of administrative burden allows us to make this shift. In doing so, we focus on people’s experience of government as well as the administrative processes that shape those experiences. A fuller understanding of the administrative state and inequality means seeing and measuring burdens as well as their consequences.\n\nTo “see” burdens, we need to better examine where they come from and how they operate. This double issue shows us key points of demarcation. One is the distinction between universal and means-tested programs. In the 1980s and 1990s, attention to administrative burdens in policies and programs were largely focused on targeted poverty-based programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The general view was that targeted policies had high levels of burdens, whereas universal social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance and Medicare, were relatively more accessible. As we detail, however, the sources of burdens as well as the types of programs they are embedded within cannot be explained by simply focusing on whether policies are targeted or universal. In some cases, more universal programs can have large burdens. Indeed, as Zachary Parolin, Christina Cross, and Rourke O’Brien (2023, this volume, issue 5) demonstrate, increases in burdens in both Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), a classic targeted policy, and unemployment insurance (UI), a New Deal–era universalist social insurance policy, explain accelerating racial inequalities in take-up of U.S. social welfare benefits.\n\nThe presence of multiple actors and conflicting incentives in service delivery also contribute to burdens. Programs managed by a mix of federal, state, and local partnerships are typically more complicated and less accessible. For-profit providers that deliver social welfare benefits further fragment the map of service delivery and sometimes have incentives to make policy benefits inaccessible, whether private insurers participating in the Medicare program or private agencies providing job training to welfare participants.\n\nAnother key demarcation in the functioning of burdens include those between rights-granting and rights-depriving programs (Brown 2023, this volume, issue 5; Edwards et al. 2023, this volume, issue 5) as well between state administered and third-party administered programs (DeLuca, Katz, and Oppenheimer 2023, this volume, issue 5; Yu 2023, this volume, issue 4). Even further, comparing the experiences of individual programs is not always the best analytical approach; doing so can obscure the cumulative consequences of having simultaneous experiences with multiple programs (Sackett and Lareau 2023, this volume, issue 4).\n\nIf burdens are so important, why have they historically received relatively little attention? After all, they are hardly an unfamiliar topic. Ask anyone about their interactions with government, and chances are you will get an earful about a seemingly Kafka-esque experience that they or a family member has faced trying to access vitally important social rights such as health care, income support, unemployment, and food assistance, or a fundamental political right, such as voting (Lowrey 2021).\n\nAdministrative burdens have the odd combination of being both grindingly familiar to us as individuals, and largely unattended as a matter of policy analysis, design, and practice. They are a widely observed fact of life, but not a widely used conceptual tool to analyze life. One explanation for this failing is the fragmented discourse around them, siloed both across and within academic disciplines and policy areas. We are social scientists who share an interest in policy, but who assess it from different perspectives: as an economist, a political scientist, a sociologist, and a public administration scholar. The interdisciplinary nature of our team reflects both an acknowledgment of the benefit of a diversity of approaches and the need for cross-disciplinary communication. The economist and sociologist uncovering burdens in a social welfare program are often not talking to each other. Similarly, the policy analyst thinking about hassles in education does not share their insights with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) expert. In large part, this is because they do not conceive as burdens as a single analytical concept but are more apt to think of them as specific to a policy domain or area of study. Rather than a general toolbox for reducing burdens, we are left instead with lots of little toolboxes, bereft of enough instruments to comprehensively address the problem.\n\nThis article seeks to advance a standard way to talk about burdens, whether in research, applied practice, or in policy debates. There is power in legibility and coherence. Naming something allows us to see it more clearly. It is difficult to accumulate knowledge when researchers use different terms and miss entire bodies of research. Framing something allows us to understand its consequences and to consider how to address it. These basic points are true for different but related domains: social science, politics, and policymaking.\n\nIn the following sections, we break down the types of costs in administrative burdens and offer some examples of their effect in different policy domains and the ways they reinforce patterns of inequality. We consider the sources of burdens before looking at potential ways to reduce them. In each section, we highlight recent innovations that have helped build and deepen our understanding of burdens and their consequences, including many from this collection. Table 1 summarizes the key insights we draw from the emerging body of research on administrative burden and provides the roadmap for our discussion in remaining sections.\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS\n\nIn this section we summarize the ways in which administrative burdens affect access, outcomes, and inequality. We describe the evidence along five main themes: access, social control, inequality, incidence, and the accumulation of burdens.\n\nSOURCES OF ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS\n\nIn this section, we summarize the evidence on the sources of administrative burdens including the role of policy design, bureaucratic dysfunction, federalism, and the private provision of social welfare benefits.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\nOpen Access Policy: RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences is an open access journal.
