        "text": "Emily Nazario is a PhD student advised by Dr. Terrie Williams in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at UCSC. She is interested in the physiology and conservation of marine predators and how the two intersect. She is researching a range of approaches that can be used to inform conservation, including how dolphins and beluga whales manage their metabolic gasses and their influence on dive recovery, how the metabolic needs of juvenile mako sharks may be influencing their habitat suitability in light of climate change induced hypoxia, and the habitat suitability of Hawaiian monk seals across the main Hawaiian Islands. Emily is passionate about the intersection of physiology, tools that can inform targeted conservation of marine predators, and their application to management approaches such as dynamic ocean management. Emily received a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from UCSC.\n\nEmily's CSP DE chapter investigates the habitat suitability of juvenile mako sharks in the Southern California Bight Ecoregion. This region is an important nursery area for the North Pacific mako shark population, though this region is expected to be largely impacted by climate change-induced hypoxia and warming temperatures. Additionally, juvenile mako sharks make up most of the mako shark landings in this area. Thus, understanding how this nursery area may geographically shift and where future spatial protections should be placed will be a critical component of the conservation efforts for this species. This study will pair habitat models and the metabolic demands of mako sharks to map their habitat suitability in the region. This mechanistically informed habitat model will also be used to project how their habitat suitability may change when considering projected environmental conditions. The habitat suitability maps can then identify critical areas for spatial management and where the risk of overfishing may be the highest."
