The National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent Changes in Industrial Techniques was organized in December 1935 as part of the National Research Program of the Works Progress Administration. Its purpose was to investigate recent changes in industrial techniques and evaluate their effects on employment. Between 1937 and 1941 the NRP published more than 700 reports on a broad variety of agricultural, manufacturing and mining activities. In late 1936 the distinguished documentary photographer Lewis Hine was hired as chief photographer. Hine made photo studies in 14 industrial communities from December 1936 to July 1937. General views of the community, working conditions in factories, machinery, and workers, are pictured for each photo study.\n\nThis primary source comes from the Records of the Work Projects Administration.\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 518502\n\nFull Citation: High Point, North Carolina - Textiles.
