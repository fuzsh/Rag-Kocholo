It’s just a matter of whether it’s in a formal educational setting with experienced instructors ready to help or an informal one through the “school of hard knocks,\" alone. I took the latter route, and I must say, if you survive, it makes a great testimony. However, I don’t recommend it!\n\nThe Lord led me to start Charis Bible College for the purpose of training people for the work of the ministry. He wanted me to take a unique approach; it had to be a combination of the rich teaching of God’s Word and practical, hands-on ministry experience.\n\nWhatever God is leading you to do, preparation is never a waste of time. Statistics show that 80% of ministers drop out of the ministry, and 80% of those who stay are on the verge of burnout. I believe the lack of preparation–spiritually, academically, and practically–are at the root of these statistics.\n\nIf you choose to attend, I guarantee you it will change your life and the lives of those around you forever.\n\nAndrew Wommack\n\nPresident & Founder\n\nMeet Your Instructors\n\nGet to know our instructors and internationally-known guest speakers.\n\nAndrew Wommack\n\nPresident and Founder\n\nBilly Epperhart\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nMike & Carrie Pickett\n\nExecutive Vice Presidents\n\nWendell Parr\n\nMinistry Ambassador\n\nBarry Bennett\n\nSenior Instructor\n\nGreg Mohr\n\nDirector of Ministry School\n\nHave questions?\n\nOur team would love to help!\n\n\"What you truly believe in your heart will be the most powerful force in your life.\"\n\nBarry Bennett\n\nSenior Instructor\n\nUnderstand God's Love\n\nLearn what it means to be set free!"
