“Wickett” Wilson Pickett was born April 18, 1941, in Prattville, Alabama, the 4th of 11 children. Pickett started from humble beginnings but quickly skyrocketed to fame as a teen. He made his mark on the music scene with hits like Land of 1000 Dance, Mustang Sally, and In the Midnight Hour. His soulful sound has transcended generations.

His legacy lives on thanks to the work of his family and brother Maxwell Pickett, who toured with him in his youth and eventually started the Wilson Pickett Legacy, in honor of his late brother.

In partnership with the Wilson Pickett Legacy, the City of Prattville renamed The Fountain City Arts Festival in 2018 to the Wilson Pickett Music & Arts Festival aka “Pickett Fest.”
