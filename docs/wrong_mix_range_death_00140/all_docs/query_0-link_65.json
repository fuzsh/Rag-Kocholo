John (Johann) Peter1 Rinck (Johann FrantzA Rincke, JohannesB, Johann DavidC Rinke, Hans JacobD, HansE, UnknownF) was born Abt. 1780 in Lincoln County, North Carolina, and died 28 Feb 1861 in Jefferson Township, Washington County, Indiana. He married Sarah Eliza Robeson 27 Nov 1805 in Lincolnton, North Carolina. She was born Abt. 1780 in North Carolina Or South Carolina, and died 18 Oct 1876 in Jefferson Township, Washington County, Indiana.\n\nNotes for John (Johann) Peter Rinck:\n\nCREDITS AND INFORMATION ON THE FAMILY OF JOHN PETER RINCK WAS SUPPLIED BY THE FOLLOWING, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS AND MISTAKES IN THIS INFORMATION, IF ERRORS ARE FOUND PLEASE CONTACT (MARY RINK HARBINSON) m.harbinson@worldnet.att.net\n\nEvelyn Maxfield Baier for her information on the John Peter Rinck line and his son Lawson her mother was Bessie Rinck\n\nStephen Jones and his information on the Eliza Rinck line, John Peter Rinck daughter and also the Hennessee Related lines of this family and for the picture of Myra Hennessee.\n\nBob Skinner lots of census information\n\nSam Steiner for his information and picture of William and Josie Rinck and his information on the line of Lawson Rinck and associated families.\n\nBill Hinds for info on Alonzo Rink and wife Julia Yount Rink and their children.\n\nRay Yount for information on Alonzo Rink and Julia Yount Rink helped in the Estate of his father Frantz Rincke Will and he paid taxes in the State of N.C. until around the 1830 time period. He is not on any census or can not find records of him at this point.\n\nHouse 1126 Lincoln County census\n\nAnderson Roberts age 36 male\n\nMary C. age 33\n\nDavid W. age 12\n\nNancy age 7\n\nFranklin M. age 5\n\nMary F. age 1\n\nJohn Ring age 15 living with them.

N.C. so it is my belief that John is Johann Peter Rinck.\n\nWarren County Tennessee Land Plots, Jacob Rinck is listed in book 9, and 91 as owning land, Then we have a Peter Rince which has to be our John Peter listed beside Jacob in book 59.\n\nJohn Peter probably moved from Warren Co. Tenn to Alabama while Jacob Stayed and came in 1835. Eliza had to have married Thomas Harper son of John Harper of Burke Co. N.C. in Aabama since their first children were born there. After John Harper died the family moved back to Warren Co. and Thomas is listed in the 1830 Census as living next to his mother Elizabeth Wilcher Harper.\n\nSome of The Wilcher Family moved to Blount Co. Ala. and of course the Rinks to DeKalb Co. Ala. The Wilcher family spelled thier name Welcher, Wilsher, Welsher and Wilshire.\n\n1840 Indiana Census\n\nWashington County, Indiana\n\npage 168\n\nJohn Rinck 000000001-0000001born between 1781-1790\n\npage 170 Eli Rinck 10001-00001 He was born between 1811-1820\n\npage 45 Lawson Rink 10001-00001 he was born between 1818-1820\n\n1850 Washington Co.

Lawson living on another farm in 1860 does not really indicate a divorce or separation. It was common for men to hire themselves out for farm labor. However there may have been a separation and or divorce. If so it should be in the Jackson Co. Indiana Records . I do not believe that Lawson could have been married before 1838 because he would have only been 20 in 1838.\n\nI do believe that Lawson married 2nd Margaret unknown; I do not believe it was Margaret May Rink because of the N.C. place of Birth and N.C. for both of her parents. I do think that the children listed in the 1870 census as Mary, 22 Jemima 16 and James 14 were Margarets children by a previous marriage and they were not named Rink, but only written that way by the census taker. I do think that Alonzo age 3 may have been the son of Lawson and Margaret but he could have been a grandson of Lawson as you indicated.\n\nI believe Margaret died between 1845-1864 when Eli remarried.\n\nNotes for Martha Jackson:\n\nCould have been married to a Bostic since Willis Bostic age 14 born in Indiana is living with them.\n\nChildren of Eli Rink and Margaret May are:\n\n+ 12 i.
