Seifried - June 02, 1943 - April 23, 2022\n\nDeparted: 04/23/2022 (Saratoga Springs)\n\nObituary Preview: Linda J. Seifried, nee Linda Clark, passed away peacefully at her home on April 23, 2022, with her family present and with support from Helios Hospice Care, after living with breast cancer for many years. Linda was the daughter of Henry and Betty (Hulka) Clark, born in Jamaica, Long Island on June 2, 1943, during WW II. Shortly after, the family moved to upstate NY, and settled near the family farm at Saratoga Springs. Here her sister Carole was born and Linda started school. But Hank's work demanded that they locate closer to the city, so in 1949, they made the big move to Dumont, NJ, where Linda's brother Henry Jr. was born. Linda graduated from high school and then won a scholarship to the School of Visual Arts in NYC. An adventurous and educational year of commuting into the city followed. But a desire for continued education caused Linda to enroll at Douglass College as a Biology/Education major, and the next four years were happily spent in New Brunswick, NJ. Here, Linda met Stefan Seifried, a Soils major at Rutgers University. By Senior year, they were making plans for marriage, and in August of 1966, right after graduation, they married. They remained in New Brunswick while Stef completed his Master's degree and Linda taught her first year of biology and chemistry. Then they moved to NY for Stef's first job, mapping the soils of Orange County. Here they started a family of their own, with Christine, Bonnie, and Rosemary born in Middletown. It was here that Linda 'discovered' the Bible, and began a deep and thorough study of it, finding answers to her deepest concerns and ending with her dedication and being baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. Their home in the country was delightful, but Stef's job called for a move once a county had been mapped. So the family moved to 5 acres with a barn, near Cochecton, NY, in Sullivan County. They made hay, raised a beef cow or two, had pigs, and grew a large vegetable garden, a life they loved. Here, the girls went to school and Linda worked as a substitute teacher at their school, until Chris graduated in 1986. That year, they made their biggest and last move, one county north, to a 100 acre farm with two barns and a bigger tractor, near Sidney, NY. Bonnie and Rosie finished high school, and all three went off to college, while Linda and Stef continued to live the life they both love - caretaking the land, roaming and photographing the woods and fields, creating art, growing big flower and vegetable gardens, camping, hiking and paddling her kayak with their daughters on both coasts and at their beloved Lake George, and enjoying the world of nature as well as their cats. Linda loved teaching and was involved with it one way or another for her entire life. While living in Sidney Center, she again served as a substitute teacher, taught science and French at Sidney Central School, and also worked at Rainbow Day Care. Linda and Stef were both involved in the Adirondack Mountain Club, where Linda served in many leadership roles for the Susquehanna Chapter. She is survived by her husband of 55 years, Stefan T. Seifried, and her three daughters Christine (Gary) Lackos of Sidney Center, NY, Bonnie (Mike) Seifried-Myers of Marshfield, MA, and Rosemary (Gene) Seifried of Twisp, WA, and grandson Thomas Lackos of Sidney Center, NY. Cremation services are under the direction of CH Landers Funeral Home in Sidney, NY. A memorial is planned for Sunday, May 15 at Compassionate Care Funeral Home in Saratoga Springs, NY.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nJudy Mary DeLong - November 12, 1947 - April 19, 2022\n\nDeparted: 04/19/2022 (Saratoga Springs)\n\nObituary Preview: SARATOGA SPRINGS - It is with great sadness that we inform you of the passing of Judy Mary DeLong, age 74, of Saratoga Springs, New York.

Born May 27, 1920, in Northumberland, NY, Doris was the daughter of Jasper and Sylvia Ellithorpe Putnam. The oldest of five siblings, she grew up in the Wilton home her grandfather, the Rev. Osmond Putnam, built in 1924 after a fire destroyed the original house at the family homestead. After marrying Lawrence Lasselle of Burnham, Maine in 1940, Doris and her husband raised their family in that same Wilton home and later built a new house on the property but across the street. Her husband died in 1989. Doris lived on what is now Putnam Lane for most of her life, including her final years. Following graduation from Saratoga High School in the class of 1938, Doris was a switchboard operator at the New York Telephone Company until her marriage. For many years, Lawrence and Doris Lasselle owned and operated Saratoga Bus Service, which featured school buses and charter buses along with a city bus line in Saratoga Springs. Later, she worked as a bookkeeper for businesses owned by Ralph and Larry Ernst and by Thomas Cunniff. Doris devoted a great deal of time and leadership to South Wilton Methodist Church, serving for many years as Sunday school superintendent and as a church trustee (often chair of the board of trustees). Throughout those years, she engaged local community members from a variety of religious backgrounds in participating in church activities such as presenting annual neighborhood Christmas pageants and helping with monthly church suppers. When area Methodist churches merged into Trinity United Methodist Church, Doris continued to serve as a trustee. She gave principal stewardship to the South Wilton Cemetery for seven decades, continuing until her passing. Always passionate about local history, she was a founder of Wilton Heritage Society and presented many programs there over the years. Her enthusiasm for family history and genealogy led her to write a book, Letters to Lura: 1850’s Life, Death & Publishing and The Jane McCrea Story, which was published in 2010, in association with the Washington County Historical Society. The book was based on a treasured, handed-down-through-the-generations collection of correspondence, journals, and published writings of her great-great-Aunt Lura Boies, a celebrated local poet who died in 1859 at age 24. In her 70’s and 80’s, Doris appreciated traveling, making several trips to Europe as well as across the U.S. It was a particular delight to visit with her daughter Sally on the northern California coast. For almost twenty years, Doris enjoyed the winter sunshine at Holiday Village in Mims, FL, where she made many dear friends. The most cherished memories of Doris’s impact on the world involve her gentle caregiving and her presence of mind in an emergency. As a young wife and mother, she cared for her husband’s parents, serving as the sole caregiver for her mother-in-law, who was bedridden for seven years and in constant pain that only Doris could comfort. As Mom, Aunt Doris, and Gram, she provided constant, gentle nurturing and caring as she opened her heart and home to generations of the extended family (and their friends) over many decades. A neighbor whose arm was severed in a farm accident always credited Doris with saving his life, telling the story of how she calmly rushed to his rescue, gave communication instructions to others, and drove him to the hospital in record time “with horn blaring and never hitting the brakes,” showing amazing skill and courage that day. In addition to her husband and her parents, Doris was predeceased by her brother, Wayne Putnam, and her sister, Elsie Allen, as well as her beloved grandmother, Lizzie March Putnam; a son-in-law, Charles Baker; and close sister-in-law, Thena Brashear. She is survived by a sister, Myrtle Buyce of South Glens Falls, NY, and a brother, Jay Putnam of Chandler, AZ; daughters Linda Baker of Saratoga Springs, NY, and Sally (Charles) Grigg of Westport, CA, and son Richard (Karen) Lasselle of Groveland, FL; grandchildren Charles (Pam) Baker of Burlington, VT, Linanne (Tom) Conroy of Rochester, NY, Melissa Allen of Naples, FL, Jeanine Russell of Roswell, GA, and Alexis (Randy) Ross of Alexandria, VA; eight great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. The family would like to express deep appreciation to all those who helped Doris lead a vibrant and purposeful life long after blindness overtook her. Particular thanks go to granddaughter Melissa and her family, who lovingly stepped up to care for her in their home for several years. She led an active life staying with her daughter Linda in her last years. Karen and Paul Millington were thoughtful and loving caregivers, providing extra help, comfort, and encouragement when it was needed most. A celebration of Doris’s life, beginning with an informal calling hour, will be held at 1 pm on Saturday, May 14, 2022, at the Trinity United Methodist Church, 155 Ballard Road, Wilton, NY. Online remembrances or condolences may be shared at: www.compassionatefuneralcare.com. This website also provides information for those who might like to send contributions in Doris’s memory to the South Wilton Cemetery Association, Trinity United Methodist Church, or the Wilton Heritage Society.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nDuncan Lloyd - March 19, 1936 - March 06, 2022\n\nDeparted: 03/06/2022 (Saratoga Springs)\n\nObituary Preview: Duncan Lloyd, age 85, affectionately known as G’Pa peacefully passed away on March 6, 2022, surrounded by loved ones.
