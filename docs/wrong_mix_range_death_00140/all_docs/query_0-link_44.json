MCP]Ohio - Ripley From: \"L Edw\" curator1224@yahoo.com \"On May 5, 1934, Artimisha Ellen Piatt was found hanging from a window sash cord in the Eagle Creek located near Ripley, OH. This created a legend in Ripley which now is remembered at the Ripley Museum. Artimisha was the daughter of Jacob Piatt and Christina Burnsides Piatt and was born in Adams County, OH. A rumor which went with the investigation in 1934 was that she was married 9 times to a Brewer, Henry Slater, a Hedges, a Cook, a Kunzman, a Summers and George Martin. Her second marriage to 1662 Scott Levi has been well documented, but the others have not been found. Photographs of all the key people in the investigation and one of the fishermen who found her can be seen at the museum. Contact L Edwards at curator124@yahoo.com if you can provide more information for the display at the Ripley Museum - a photo is especially wanted.Ohio - Wayne County - Doylestown Walter ``Walt'' L.

Adieu, dear ones, I have waited long / To hear the message that calls me home / And now t comes like a low sweet song / Of welcome over the river's foam. And my heart shall / ache and my feet shall roam / No more, no more; I am going home. Home, where no / storm, where no tempest raves, / In the light of calm, eternal day / Where no willows weep over lonely graves / Where the tears from eyelids are wiped away. And my soul shall sigh, and my feet shall roam / No more, no more; I am going home.\n\nOklahoma - Harper County - Doby Springs John Holmes and crew of harvest hands were moving harvesting equipment (header barge) to another field. As they went into the yard the barge hit or run into telephone wires overhead and scared the horses. John was thrown or lost his balance and the barge run over him across his abdomen or groin injuring him fatally. He lived about an hour after the accident. Mother (Nellie) was sitting sewing in the kitchen and I was playing nearby. A car drove into our yard (to my childish eyes it seemed very big black) they had came after my mother to take her to my father lying injured. He told my mother to tell Nora he would meet her in heaven and he wanted me (Audrey) to be raised a christian. As he passed away a beautiful smile was on his face and he seemed to be greeting someone and called \"Ma, Ma\" as though he saw his mother waiting for him. His mother had already passed on some years before. After our fathers' death, Mother, Nora and I lived with Grandpa and Grandma Pyeatt, Uncle Dwight and Aunt Jennie for a year or so on the farm south of Lenora, Oklahoma. John Holmes and Nellie Pyeat went to school together.
