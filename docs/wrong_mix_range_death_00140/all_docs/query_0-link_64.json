Chrissie Bowie Bucklin\n\nSAN BENITO, TX. -Christine \"Chrissie\" Bowie Bucklin passed away early Sunday morning, July 2, 2006, after a lengthy illness.\n\nChrissie was born Christine Ferguson Bowie to Christine Ferguson Kerr and John Caldwell Bowie on December 10, 1911, in Bloomfield, Iowa. Her parents were Scottish immigrants who first settled in Iowa then moved to San Benito in 1916, as part of the Bowie Clan that were among the early settlers of San Benito. She attended San Benito schools graduating from high school in 1929. Upon graduation from high school, she attended Brownsville Junior College as it was known then and later graduated from Texas A&I University.\n\nTeaching was her lifelong profession beginning in 1932, at Fred Booth Elementary School in San Benito. She taught there until her marriage to Edward I. \"Red\" Bucklin in 1936, after which she lived in Kansas City and St. Louis Missouri. Chrissie and Red returned to San Benito in 1945. She resumed her teaching career at Fred Booth School for the 1947-48 school year. In 1955, she went to Highland School as Head Teacher and then in 1957, returned to Fred Booth as Assistant Principal until her retirement in 1982, after 38 years of loyal and dedicated service to the San Benito School District. As a result of her service and the great respect the citizens of San Benito had for her, May 21, 1982, was officially declared \"Chrissie Bucklin Day\" by the San Benito C.I.S.D. and the San Benito City Commission.\n\nShe was very active in professional organizations. She was a member and past president of the local Chapter of Texas State Teachers Association, Parent Teachers Association, a member of the National Education Association and the America Association of University Women.

Providence Journal, July 1, 1902\n\nWilliam Whipple Brown\n\nWilliam Whipple Brown died yesterday in the 88th year of his age. He was the last of the old South Water Street merchants, among whom he was well known for two generations. ....His father was Whipple Brown, a widely known captain, who was captured by the British in the War of 1812 and put on the prison ship at New London. His grandfather was Abial Brown who fought at the battle of Bunker Hill and was with Col. Lippitt's regiment at Trenton and Princeton. He lived in the old homestead on Planet Street about 86 years, and his father and grandfather both lived and died there before him. The history of the old house extends back probably over a century and a half. It was originally the old hotel in Pawtuxet. Some untoward incident gave it a bad name and no one would live in it, so it was placed upon a raft and sailed grandly up Providence River. One half fell off at Fox Point and was put on India Street, and the other half was put up on the bank at what is now Planet Street, and stands as firmly there as ever, but the waterfront has been filled in, leaving it some distance from the river.\n\n.\n\nEmail communication from Shirley M.
