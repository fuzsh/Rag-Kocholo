RHODES July 01, 1891, daughter of GEORGE RHODES and MARY LONG. She was born February 19, 1869 in Harrisburg, PA.\n\nHERVEY EDMUND DIEFFENBACH, the largest dealer in natural ice in Bloomsburg, Pa., was born in that town Oct. 18, 1865, and is a son of Jacob Dieffenbacher, The family is descended from Conrad Dieffenbacher, one of the earliest of the sturdy Germans to settle in Columbia county.\n\nLeonhard Dieffenbacher, a native of Eppingen, Grand Duchy of Baden, Germany, was the ancestor of the family in Columbia county. He and his wife, Anna Martha, had several children, of whom Conrad was one. The name has been altered by his descendants in America, who have dropped the terminal er.\n\nConrad Dieffenbacher was born in Eppingen, March 1, 1743, and after the completion of his education came to America on the ship Richmond, landing at Philadelphia Oct. 20, 1764. He settled in the Fulhomer (Faulkner) Swamp, in Limerick township, in what is now Montogomery county, Pa., where he married Catherine Betz on Jan. 30, 1769, and their children were: Abraham, born Nov.16, 1769; John, July 13, 1771; Fredrick, May 4, 1773; Jacob, Nov. 19, 1775; Philip, Feb. 3, 1778; Henry, Jan. 31, 1780; Elizabeth, May 11, 1782; Conrad, Feb. 15, 1785; Catherine, May 20, 1787; David, June 17, 1789; and Susannah, Aug. 31, 1791. He moved to Derry township, Northumberland county, in April, 1809. Later he moved to Washingtonville, and there married Catherine Haas. He died Aug. 6, 1813.\n\nHenry Dieffenbacher, son of Conrad, born in Montgomery county Jam. 31, 1780, died June 1, 1870. He was a farmer, and resided in Washingtonville, then in Northumberland county. He married Susannah, daughter of Jacob and Mary C. (Gortner) Hill, the former a soldier in the Revolution and later promoted to captain. Her children were: David, who married Elizabeth Truckenmiller; Solomon; Christina, wife of John Springer; Sarah, wife of Abraham Cooper; Hannah, wife of John Moyer; Elizabeth, wife of Christopher Raupp; Jacob who married Martha A. Funston; Leah, wife of John Sidler; Susannah, wife of Charles Truckenmiller; Aaron, who married Jane Daw; and Henry, who married Sarah E. Hagenbuch.\n\nJacob Dieffenbach, father of Hervey E., was born August 27, 1818, near Washingtonville, Northumberland county, and died in Bloomsburg May 4, 1898. He was a farmer and resided on the State road, between Jerseytown and White Hall, and in 1854 moved to Bloomsburg and bought what is now the Dieffenbach Addition. He Moved into the addition in 1860. He married Martha A. Funston, who was born at Jerseytown, Jan. 19, 1827, daughter of Thomas A. and Hannah (Schooley) Funston and died in Bloomsburg Dec. 29,1902. Their children were: Sarah Adeline, born Oct. 16,1847, married Charles A. Knorr; Susan Blanche, born May 3, 1850, died Sept. 21, 1852; Alvin Hill, borrn May 7, 1853, died July 22, 1859; Emma Jane born Jan. 13, 1856, March 2, 1856; Clara Adelia was born April 4, 1860, died May 4, 1896; Henry Funston, born Oct. 25, 1862 married Laura B. Dieterich; Hevery Edmund is mentioned below; Harriet Hannah born Dec. 4, 1869, married O. T. Weidman.\n\nHervey E. Dieffenbach attended the Port Noble school at Bloomsburg, then went to the old Academy, later to the Fifth street school, to the Normal school and finally to the West Third street school. He then went to live on his fathers farm and assisted him in the manufacture of brooms, his father being the largest maker of brooms in the county. After this he was engaged in selling tea for about five years, when he sold the business. On July 1, 1891, he married Jennie C. Rhoads, daughter of George W. and Mary Anna (Long) Rhoads, of Harrisburg, and they had these children: George Edmund, born Sept. 19, 1892; Oliver Hill, born Sept. 21, 1894; Mary Anna, May 29, 1895; Harriet Jennie, July 20, 1900; Clyde Marcus, Dec. 22, 1902; Jacob Grier, July 28, 1905; Martha Claire, Feb. 4, 1908; and Frederick Carroll B., May 26, 1910.\n\nIn July, 1891, Mr. Dieffenbach went to Sunbury to work in the planing mill of Witmer Driesbach & Rhodes, and then changed to the Herndon Manufacturing Companys planing mill, at Herndon. In 1897 he returned to Bloomsburg and entered the ice business with his brother, Henry F., under the firm name of Dieffenbach Brothers. For six years they continued the partnership, and then Hervey E. assumed entire control. In 1897 they bought five acres of land between Eleventh and Fourteenth streets, which is flooded by means of springs, thus guranteeing a constant supply of pure ice in the winter for packing in their storehouses. Generally the supply of natural ice is sufficient for their trade, but of late years it has been found necessary to import Mount Pocono natural ice to keep up with the rapidly growing patronage.\n\nMr. Dieffenbach is a Dempcrat in political affilation, but has not sought or held office. He was reared under the discipline of the Reformed Church, but now attends the United Evangelical.

Eberlin departed this life at her home at Norconk, Wilmot township, on Monday, May 14, 1900, Matilda Jane Eberlin, wife of the late Martin J. Eberlin, who passed over into the great beyond May 1, 1899. The deceased was aged 40 years, and was a victim of that dreaded disease consumption. She left three children, an aged father and several brothers and hosts of friends to mourn her death.\n\nInterment took place in the St. John's Lutheran Cemetery, which was in sight of her home, on Thursday, May 17. The funeral was very largely attended. Her last remains were carried to her last resting place from her home by twelve pallbearers, where she was laid to rest by the side of her husband. She was a devoted and consistent member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Rev. John W. Klinger of Dushore, her pastor, officiated and delivered an able and touching sermon.\n\nThe deceased was born in Cherry township, Sullivan County, in 1860, and was a daughter of Hiram Kisner. She received the rite of holy baptism in her infancy by the Rev. C.L. Early, and was confirmed according to the rites of the Lutheran church in Cherry township, Sullivan County, in 1872, by the Rev. Henry B. Strodach, and was united in holy wedlock with Martin J. Eberlin in 1878, by the Rev. Lewis Smith. The deceased was one of those rare personalities who seem to diffuse about them a sort of love compelling atmosphere, which few can resist that come within the charming circle of its influence.\n\n\" None knew her but to love her.\n\nNone named her but to praise\"\n\nAlthough conscious of the approaching death, which was to sever the tenderest of human ties and deprive her children of fond mother's love and guidance, she was nevertheless enabled to meet death's merciless advance with marvelous fortitude and resignation, testifying to the last her abiding faith in God's infinite goodness and a Christian hope of a blissful immortality. The church of which she was an exemplary member and the social circle enlivened by her presence lose much by her untimely demise. To the bereaved family which now only consists of three children the loss is an irreparable one. To this tearful group around the desolate hearthstone of their once happy home, the sympathy of the entire community have gone forth with a depth and sincerity seldom ever witnessed.\n\nMore About JOSEPH MARTIN EBERLIN:\n\nCemetery: St John's, Wilmot, PA\n\nChildren of MATILDA KISNER and JOSEPH EBERLIN are:\n\ni.
