        "text": "...I would appreciate any advice/direction you could give me. My grandfather passed away several years back now, and following a trip to France, memories of some of my talks with Grandpa come back to me from time to time - thus my search down the Leavell trail. Grandpa's maternal Grandfather was, I think, George Washington Leavell. My Grandpa was difficult to understand so most things he told me he had to repeat a time or two.\n\n...Sorry we aren't a family for records, etc., so I don't have much to go on. Great-great Grandpa Leavell lost a thumb in the civil war and may have been permanently injured necessitating walking with a cane. My Grandpa Davis (maternal) was closer to his Grandpa Leavell than he was to his paternal Grandpa Davis.\n\n...GG Grandpa Leavell would have died in Lafeyette, Lanett, or perhaps New Site AL in the early nineteen hundreds. I am keenly interested in tracing the family tree back and would love to do and present to my Mom - I think she would really enjoy it now that both her parents are gone.

He married ETTA NORTH. She was born December 04, 1859, and died April 14, 1928.\n\nNotes for LUTHER TELLIS MOSES:\n\nTranscribed from MEMOIRS OF GEORGIA published by the Southern Historical Association, 1895.\n\nLUTHER T. MOSES is one of the best known men of this section of the state, being chief deputy of internal revenue of Georgia. He is a grandson of a soldier of the war of 1812, Neal Moses, who with his wife, Nancy (Manning) Moses, came from their native state, North Carolina, to Georgia in 1812, and after a short residence here went to Alabama, where Mr. Moses died. Their son, Ansley Moses, was born in Fayette county, Ga., in 1829. He was a man of great ability and very useful to his state. In 1860 he helped organize Company D, Fifty-third Georgia regiment, Longstreet's corps. With this he went out as captain, being sent on an expedition to the coast. The next year he went out as first lieutenant but after a few months was made captain of Company D, which rank he held until 1863. Longstreet was then transferred to the western army, and in April Capt. Moses was taken prisoner at Knoxville, Tenn., and imprisoned for eight months at Camp Chase, Ohio; it was while here that he contracted the chronic lung disease which eventually caused his death; from Camp Chase he was transferred to Fort Delaware, where he remained until the close of the war. Mr. Moses represented his county in the legislature in 1873 and 1874. He was deacon in the Baptist church, in which he had been a conscientious member and earnest worker from the age of twenty-one. His death occurred in 1886, and was greatly deplored. The wife of Capt. Moses was Miss Mary E. Leavell, daughter of Charles and Elizabeth W. (Hunter) Leavell, both natives of Virginia, but who passed their youth in South Carolina, coming to Georgia about 1832 and making their home in Coweta county. It was in this county that Luther T. Moses was reared, having been born in 1853. He received a good common school education and devoted some ten years to teaching. His interest in schools has always been very deep, and he has manifested this interest constantly and by every possible means, doing everything in his power to advance the educational interests of his native county, often at considerable sacrifice to himself. He was a member of the school board from 1880 to 1887, and again from 1889 to 1893, each time resigning to take an important government position. This was the office of deputy internal revenue collector, to which he was appointed by President Cleveland in January, 1887, holding it until the inauguration of the new president, being appointed chief deputy in August, 1893, the position he still holds. Mr. Moses was married in 1884, his wife being Miss Etta North, born in 1860 and reared in Coweta county, the daughter of Thomas G. and Jane (Jones) North. They have four children: Tallmadge, Alice, L. T., and Mary. Both Mr. and Mrs. Moses are steadfast members of the Baptist church, and everywhere beloved and respected. Mr. Moses is a man of wide and growing influence and is sure to make his mark in his country and age.\n\nChildren of LUTHER MOSES and ETTA NORTH are:\n\n.....i.....RICHARD TALMADGE MOSES, b.

CHARLES L. MOSES, congressman from the fourth district of Georgia, is of noble ancestry, for his great-grandsires on both sides took part in the revolutionary conflict. His grandfather, Neal Moses, the son of John Moses, the revolutionary hero, was born in North Carolina, took part in the war of 1812, and in 1820 moved to Fayette county, Ga. His wife was Nancy Manning, and in 1829 his son Ansley was born. The latter was reared on the farm in Fayette county and married Miss Mary Leavell, whose parents Charles and Elizabeth (Hunter) Leavell, were natives of South Carolina, and were married in Newberry district in 1831, removing to Georgia in 1833. Charles Leavell was born in 1802, his father being John Leavell, a Virginian, whose father, also John Leavell by name, emigrated from England before the revolution, and was with Francis Marion through all that struggle. Charles L. Moses was born in 1856 and reared on the old farm in Coweta county, Ga., and received a good common school education. In 1873 he entered Mercer university and graduated in 1876. He began teaching in Newnan, having charge, for seven years, of the boy's department; the last year in this department there were 150 boys. Among Mr. Moses' college classmates were Thomas Watson, John Boifeuillet, Seaborn Wright of Rome, W. D. Jelks, and T. E. Murphy, who took first honors. Mr. Moses himself carried off the second honors. He is a young man of great promise and recognized ability, his election to congress in 1890 from the fourth district being in evidence of this. Throughout his district he is held in high esteem, and justly regarded as a most worthy citizen. His wife, to whom he was married in 1881, was Miss Blanche Hall, daughter of Rev. J. H. Hall of Newnan. They have seven children living: Coral, James H., Charles L., Jr., Ansley, Hugh A. Blanche, Amaziah. Mr. and Mrs. Moses are honored members of the Baptist church. Mr. Moses is a member of the I. O. O. F.\n\nhttp://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/leakin-leaver.html#RYK09GLWP\n\nMoses, Charles Leavell (1856-1910)  also known as Charles L.

LAVELLE) was born October 21, 1871 in Centerville, Leon, Texas. She married ALFRED LANSING SHARPE November 28, 1895 in Georgetown, Williamson, Texas, son of JOHN SHARPE and SARAH KELLOGG. He was born November 21, 1858 in Ravenna, Portage, Ohio, and died Abt. 1920.\n\nNotes for ALFRED LANSING SHARPE:\n\nhttp://www.genealogymagazine.com/alfredlsharpe.html\n\nB. B. Paddock, History and Biographical Record of North and West Texas (Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1906), Vol. II, p. 473\n\nALFRED L. SHARPE.\n\n.....Beginning his career of activity as a boy in the telegraph and railroad service, then going into mercantile trade, thence to cattle ranching, and, while still maintaining his interests in the latter, engaged in affairs of public nature, Mr. Sharpe has recently taken the important post of collector of customs at the port of El Paso, one of the most responsible positions in the Federal service of Texas.\n\n.....Mr. Sharpe was born in Ravenna, Ohio, November 21, 1858, a son of John E. and Lavinna (Kellogg) Sharpe. He studied his first lessons in the schools of his native neighborhood. Though a mere boy, he was accepted as an employe of the Erie Railroad, did his work in a commendable manner and from increasingly important grades, and for twelve years remained in railroad an express service. From the Erie road he went with Cleveland, Lorain & Wheeling, and then employed with the Gould System. He has been in Texas since 1882. In 1892 he embarked in the hardware, implement and vehicle business at Georgetown, Texas. Seven years later, on his removal to West Texas, he engaged in the cattle business. At the present time owning one of the best ranches in the vicinity of San Elizario, he has gained his position in the business by the skill of management of affairs and men which he has learned to employ from youth up.\n\n.....With success in business has come leisure to indulge his inclination for political and public service. He was elected a member of the twenty-ninth legislature to represent the one hundredth district--El Paso county. This is, as regards the amount of effective and beneficial legislation accomplished, one of the notable legislatures during the years of Texas' political history. Of the enactments bearing upon the welfare of El Paso and the state of Texas, no measures were more important than the irrigation bill and the famous anti- gambling bill, both of which were introduced and passed by the efforts of Mr. Sharpe, and it is proof of his legislative skill that the latter measure and thereby placed a most effective instrument in the hands of executive officers for controlling public gambling. The content and purpose of the law is explained in its title, viz.: An act to prevent, by means of writ of injunction, at the suit of the state, or any citizen thereof, the habitual use, actual, contemplated or threatened, of any premises, place, building, or part thereof, for the purpose of gaming or keeping or exhibiting games prohibited by the laws of this state. Mr. Sharpe also took an active part in obtaining the revision of the present land law. Mr. Sharpe resigned his position in the legislature, December 22, 1905, to accept the office of collector of customs at the port of El Paso, district of Paso del Norte, this appointment being received from President Roosevelt.\n\n.....Mr. Sharpe was married in 1895 to Miss Kate Leavell, of Georgetown, Texas. They have two children, John O. and Holland Sharpe.\n\n.....Alfred began work as a boy telegraph operator for the Erie Railroad, which is natural, his father having work for that railroad as well. Following that, we as employed by the Cleveland, Lorain & Wheeling Railroad, then with the Gould System.\n\n.....He migrated from Ravenna, Ohio to Georgetown, Texas in 1882. He embarked in the hardware, implement and vehicle business in Georgetown in 1892.\n\n.....Alfred relocated to El Paso County, Texas about 1899 to take up ranching. This was cutting edge adventure, as the county had only been organized since 1850. He became very successful at this endeavor and was particularly known for his ability to supervise effectively the many workers, young and old, that were needed. His U Bar Ranch was near the town of San Elizario and was along the Rio Grande River, the river bordering the US with Mexico. The ranch was near the small town of Ysleta, which is the oldest town recognized in what is now the State of Texas, having had its beginnings attributed at about 1682. They resided in the city of El Paso.\n\n.....It perhaps can be said (with tongue in cheek) that Alfred started the Republican Party revolution in Texas. He was elected to the twenty-ninth Texas Legislature from district #100 encompassing El Paso County in 1904. It is reported that he was the first Republican elected to a Texas state level office since the days of post Civil War Reconstruction period. It is also reported that he authored the first anti-gambling legislation adopted by the Texas Legislature. The vitality of that bill was tested and sustained by the Texas Supreme Court, thereby placing into the hands of law enforcement officers a reliable instrument to support their arrests. A water irrigation bill was also authored by Alfred and passed. Legislative commentary claims these were two of the most important bills of that Legislative session, and that their success attested to the legislative skill plied by Representative Sharpe.\n\n.....He served only part of one term, as he resigned December 22, 1905 to receive an appointment from President Theodore Roosevelt to be the Collector of Customs at the Port of El Paso. This was considered one of the most important federal positions in all of Texas.\n\n.....We believe Alfred served the Federal Government in the capacity of Collector of Customs at El Paso during the Presidential administration of William Howard Taft (1909-1913), a fellow Republican who, like Alfred, also hailed from Ohio\n\n.....He is reported as shooting his young adult daughter, Holland, wounding her in the head. He turned the handgun upon himself with a fatal shot. We believe this took place in New York state, perhaps in Binghamton where other Sharp(e) relatives resided. The oral tradition, though undocumented by this writer, is that Alfred experienced financial difficulties in Texas, and went to Binghamton, New York to work with his first cousin (once removed), Willis Sharpe Kilmer, the patented medicine success. Presumably, the financial distress was an element in the tragic shootings. Holland married a Mr. Woodhull and she lived out her life in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n--D. A.
