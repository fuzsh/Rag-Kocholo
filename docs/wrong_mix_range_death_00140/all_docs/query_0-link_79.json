(Letter did not name half-brother)\n\nDeath certificate names parents not known, completed by his daughter Mary.\n\nDaughter Mary letter from Deb Schenck:\n\nMr. Lambert said Dad stayed with Eden ogg in Garrett county and went to school. Then he came back to Berea and stayed with Jim ogg. J;m ogg's wife was a Miss Wren and Eden ogg was a brother to Jim Ogg. Dad came to Berea College to school in 1901-02. He said he knew someone who would helphim get a job in a bank if he'd get more schooling. (This was after Dad ha d gone to Illinois) . The Eden O ggs were going to Newman, Illinois where the Adam Oggs were and stopped and picked up my Dad and took him with them. He worked there for Add ogg and was helping Uncle Marcell Groscost with the broom corn when he met my Mother. Mr. Lam b ert said Dad was to marry a girl in Illinois. The girls father came to Berea . Mr. Lambert said he remembered him getting off the train. He was investigating to see who his daughter was goin g to marry. The impression Mr. Lambert got word that the g irls father was supposed to be welltodo. Dad had an 80 acre farm near N ewman and Hume, Illinois. Forest Groscost s a id it was a good 8 0 acres. Dad said he lost it on the stock Tharket, betting on wheat. (perhaps the banker father of his girl friend was the cause of him losing his farm on the st o ck market). My D a d and Sam Lambert, a cousin of Jim Lambert, were cutting trees near st a te r oad 25 on the west side of the road near Boones Gap when a tree fell between them, breaking ones right arm and the others left arm. Jim Lambert carried Dad down to the bottom of the hill. Dad WqS in his early teens.\n\nHe was fourteen when he went with the oggs to Illinois. Dad was a member of the Modern Woodmen of America, the Methodist Church, and in politics he was more concerned with\n\nthe person capable of the office he was seeking, than with the political party this person represented. My Mother, Clara May We a ver Knuckles, W a s a life long member of the MethodistChurch and was affiliated with the Womens Societies of the church\n\nThe A dam O gg's gave d a d a pair of pillows and a B ible as a wedding gift.\n\nTheir first home was an apartment on Cleveland A venue, in Ter r e Haute, until the summer following their marriage when they completed their new home at 2 3 0 3 spruce street, Terre\n\nHaute, Vigo county, Indi ana .Dad was the victim of several accidents. Besides h a vin g his arm broken he was working in a pa p er mill at Terre Haute when he had three fingers cut nearly to the bone, after which he changed jobs and worked for the pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nAfter «b»we «/b»moved to Edinburgh, he was getting a load of wood and on his way home the wagon wheels hit a rut in the woods and threw him on the tongue of the wagon. There was an indenture in his chest from the watch he had in his overall breast pocket. This caused him to have fainting spells occasionally and it was several years before he recovered from this.\n\nDuring World War «b»I, «/b»Dad had to go to columbus to\n\nthe Court House to register. He was 41 at the time and the War was nearly over. Therefore, he never had to go to service. In 1918 we all had the flu as did every other fam~ly, many people died and there was a funeral nearly every hour of the day. On November 11, when the War was over, we were having a telephone installed in our house on a farm Dad had rented, and the lineman received the news when he checked with the office after the installation of the telephone was completed. Daddy was husking corn in a field nearby, and I climbed to the top of a straw stack and yelled to him the news. 4fter the telephone man had gone, my sister, who was four at the time, called the operator and told her she wanted to talk to her Grandpa. Edinburgh, about 2600 population at that time, and the operator knew who she was and got her Grandpa on the phone for her. Farmers thrashed their small grain in those days with a large thrashing machine, nearly as large as the railroad locomotive. The thrashing machine went from farm to farm and it took four or five men to run it. It was powered with wood or coal. These men stayed at the farm over night and if they happened to be at your farm they were there for all meals. After thrashing was completed one year, my cousin, pauline Weaver, and I decided to climb the new straw stack. We didn't want Dad to see us, because of the scolding we would get. Pauline got in a hurry to get down and landed where some of the cows had been and with mother's apron on, and I got in a hurry and got turned around and was coming down head first. Quite a trick getting turned around in the new straw. In November 1922, after Grandpa's death November 3, 1921, Mother sold her father's small farm and she and Dad rented a farm near the farm of Forest Groscost, south of Middletown, Indiana. Later we moved onto the Groscost place then they went to Muncie, Indiana to live. This is where my folks lived when they were killed. It was about half-way between sulphur springs and Mechanicsburg.\n\nOther GPS Proof of this connection lies with WWI application signed by brother Benjamin in 1918 naming John Knuckles in Madison Indiana as his next of kin. Since Madison Indiana is both a city and a county, it suggests he also may have been referring to his father still being alive, since his father lived in Madison City...or his brother in Madison Co, IN. The problem lies with his marriage certificate naming his father as John Knuckles being deceased in 1906. Since there is no John Knuckles deceased by this time, it suggests he was alienating himself from his father by saying he was dead, when in fact he was living in Madison, IN\n\n[HI25116] (Research):Father not proven, but mother confirmed. A marriage document names father John R Knuckles deceased in 1906. W A Ogg letter dated 1938 says his father died when he was a small child as well as his mother.\n\n[MI25116] (Medical):Auto- train accident\n\n[DI25116] Anderson Daily Record, Madison Co, Anderson, Indiana Jan 4 1930\n\nTwo Killed in Crash At Middletown\n\nJohn Knuckles and Wife Died When Train Struck Automobile\n\nCrossing Signals Were In Operation\n\nAttempt Made By Garage Man To Halt Sedan Before Collision\n\nFuneral Services For Victims Will Be Held Sunday Afternoon At Church in Ed inburg, Indiana\n\nMiddletown, Jan 4- Mr and Mrs John Knuckles, both age 55 residing four mil es southeast of Middletown, were instantly killed at 9 p.m. Friday wh en a Ford sedan driven by Mr Knuckles was struck and demolished by a west- bound Pennsylvania passenger train at the Eighth Street crossing here.

She is my great great great grandmother, and was married to Elisha Tanner 5 Jun 1821, On a search in LDS I found her birth to be 1799. And while researching the archives in Richmond a few weeks ago, I found the marriage bond between her and Elisha Tanner listing her as Coley Viar. I have found her listed as Coner Via, and Correr Via, on other family trees on the internet, but I believe the Marriage bond information is more accurate. I am trying to find out when and where she died, and her parents. I know you did not list that information in your tree, but perhaps you have some notes that may lead me to this information.
