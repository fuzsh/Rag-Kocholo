        "text": "Towers Galore at the NAB Radio Show\n\nBroadcast engineers cant help themselves  they love towers! A session at the upcoming NAB Radio Show (Philadelphia, PA, September 23-25, 2009, www.nabradioshow.com) entitled Tower Sites I Have Known and Photographed should be of great interest to any broadcast engineer who, like this sessions presenter, Scott Fybush, shares a love of towers.\n\nThe editor of the online trade journal NorthEast Radio Watch (www.fybush.com/nerw.html), Scott Fybush is a contributingwriterto Radio World, the news editor of the 100000watts.com radio directory, and a freelance radio journalist. Fybush also writes and photographs the \"Tower Site of the Week\" feature at fybush.com (www.fybush.com/featuredsite.html; see next paragraph for additional information), and is writing a history of FM radio in New York City. In his Radio Show session Scott will cover some of his fascinating road trips to tower sites all across the U.S. that highlight the history of radio.\n\nScott has assembled a truly extraordinary compilation of tower sites on his Tower Site of the Week archive Web page (at www.fybush.com/siteindex.html). Scott took the photo above at South Mountain in Phoenix, Ariz. just one of literally thousands of tower photos posted in Scotts archive. A complete list of the current contents of Scotts archive is provided in the table below, organized by state.
