        "text": "In this week”s issue… Region digs out from big snowfall – Big departure at WOR – WGBH hires Braude & Eagan – WMVY yields to WBUA – Brian Dodge resurfaces in Pioneer Valley – Pennsylvania AM goes dark\n\nBy SCOTT FYBUSH\n\n*In nearly 20 years of writing this column, we”ve covered plenty of storms as they”ve raged across the territory we cover. From coastal hurricanes to derechos to big winter snowfalls, we”ve seen pretty much everything nature can dish out at a broadcaster. So by those standards, the blast that hit NERW-land beginning on Friday was at most a medium-big deal, inconveniencing many with as much as 40 inches of snow but inflicting little to no permanent damage.\n\nFor hundreds of thousands of people from the Maritimes to Long Island, of course, that was cold comfort as power lines went down and roads jammed. Where were radio and TV in the midst of all that? On the air, mostly – there”s no word of any tower collapses or even many extended station outages. (One exception was in southern MAINE, where NBC affiliate WCSH Channel 6 in Portland was knocked off the air for reasons that remain vaguely unclear, with the station telling viewers its transmitter had been “fried” by the storm; there were also stations knocked off by power outages in southeaste rn Massachusetts and Rhode Island, including big-signalled WCTK 98.1 New Bedford/Providence and the Quincy-based main signal of WUMB-FM 91.9 Boston.)\n\nThere were plenty of good stories of radio and TV stepping up to the plate with extended coverage: plenty of TV newsrooms went wall-to-wall with snow coverage, of course, and our old colleagues at WBZ (1030 Boston) were on the air non-stop with coverage, for instance, as were WPRO in Providence, New York”s WCBS and WINS, and some smaller outlets such as WSAR in Fall River.\n\nBut there were also some disturbing signs that things out there are changing. Take, for instance, the major radio group that proudly sent out a press release over the weekend touting the public service it offered during the storm – noting that one of its flagship stations had “kept its listeners safe and informed throughout the blizzard via social media with continuous updates about concert postponements, traffic bans, power outages, and [transit] service closings.” That was no doubt a comfort to listeners with access to power, but probably wasn”t much help at all to hundreds of thousands of people without electricity or broadband access. Isn”t that what radio itself was supposed to be for?\n\nWe”re still waiting for more word on conditions to emerge from the area that was hit hardest by the snowfall, along Long Island Sound in southern CONNECTICUT. With as much as 40 inches of snow falling in parts of New Haven and Fairfield counties, even the best-prepared stations had crisis moments, such as Cox”s WPLR/WEZN/WFOX, which put out an on-air plea for plows to help dig out the parking lot of its Milford studio complex.\n\nWith travel bans in effect across most of southern New England, and travel impossible anyway, it was a long, long weekend for many station staffers camped out on conference-room floors and break-room sofas all over the region (or, for the luckiest, in hotels within convenient walking distance of studios and transmitter sites), and we heard from plenty who pulled multiple-day shifts away from home to keep the public informed.\n\nOne of the oddest bits of timing involving the storm and radio happened off the MASSACHUSETTS coast last Friday night.\n\nThe end of WMVY (92.7 Tisbury) wasn”t meant to coincide with a massive winter storm, to be sure, but the sale of the class A FM signal from Joe Gallagher”s Aritaur Communications to Boston University”s WBUR-FM (90.9) closed…and once it had closed, the AAA programming that had been airing for three decades on 92.7 had to give way right on schedule at midnight to WBUA, the new simulcast of WBUR-FM.\n\nFor WMVY”s programmers, of course, the end of 92.7 is the start of a new road. As we”ve been reporting here in NERW, the nonprofit “Friends of MVY” helmed by PD Barbara Dacey had just two months to raise $600,000 to buy the station”s studios and intellectual property in order to keep it going as a noncommercial streaming operation. They made their goal with a few hours to spare, and so the end of WMVY over the air on Friday was less of a funeral than a celebration of what was coming next.\n\nDacey and the rest of the WMVY airstaff were in the studio (“at the end of a dirt road on Martha”s Vineyard”) for the final couple of hours on 92.7, playing some of their favorite songs and giving shout-outs to listeners on the Vineyard and all over the world, but as they were broadcasting, the weather was worsening outside…and so while the final 20 minutes of WMVY programming on 92.7 leading up to the midnight handoff to WBUA/WBUR were the sounds of an ocean”s waves, streaming listeners lost the signal a few minutes earlier when WMVY”s net connection went down in the stormy weather.\n\nA lost net connection is a pretty serious inconvenience to a broadcast station these days, of course – but it”s a death sentence to an all-streaming operation, especially one like the reborn “mvyradio.com” that”s still trying to provide a local community service to an isolated area that really needs a local source of weather and emergency information. (In fairness to the mvyradio.com folks, they”re still trying to find a new FM home for their programming so they can go back to the vitally important work of, you know, being a radio station.)\n\nAnd there”s one more interesting piece to the WMVY puzzle:\n\n[private]\n\nIn addition to its over-the-air broadcast on 92.7 serving the Vineyard and parts of the Cape and South Coast, WMVY was also being heard on translator W243AI (96.5) in Newport, RHODE ISLAND. Owned by Boston-area broadcast engineer David Maxson, the translator reportedly went silent on Friday night – but WMVY”s airstaff was promising all day on Friday that the 96.5 signal would be back up and running again “within a few days.” A translator can”t relay a webstream, of course…and that presumably means that the mvyradio.com programming is going to show up somewhere terrestrial (perhaps an HD2 subchannel?) for W243AI to relay. Stay tuned…\n\n*While WBUR expands its Cape-and-Islands reach with the new WBUA 92.7 (joining existing WBUR 1240 West Yarmouth and part-time relays on WCCT 90.3 Harwich and WSDH 91.5 Sandwich), its Boston public radio archrival WGBH (89.7) was making a big hire to add to its own talk roster.\n\nFormer WTKK (96.9 Boston) morning hosts Jim Braude and Margery Eagan are already no strangers to WGBH”s airwaves or to its management, having done a guest shift on 89.7 right after their former commercial talk home flipped to rhythmic top-40 as “Hot 96.9” last month. WGBH GM Phil Redo used to run Greater Media, and he wasted little time bringing Braude and Eagan to 89.7 full time, where they”ll start February 25 as co-hosts of the noon-2 PM “Boston Public Radio” block. Where does that leave existing hosts Callie Crossley and Emily Rooney? They”ll continue as “contributors,” WGBH says, and Rooney is of course plenty busy with her evening “Greater Boston” show on WGBH-TV. Braude and Eagan will bring their monthly “Ask the Governor” feature to WGBH, which will offer the show to other stations around the Bay State as well.\n\nWill Braude and Eagan bring some of their commercial talk audience over to the bottom end of the FM dial? WGBH is hardly the first public station to snap up former commercial talk talent, though the results have been mixed so far: Connecticut”s WNPR has a daily show hosted by former WTIC talker Colin McEnroe; Rochester”s WXXI has former WHAM morning co-host Beth Adams in its morning shift; in Syracuse, WCNY tried and failed to find a good local fit for longtime WSYR talker Jim Reith.\n\n*Another displaced WTKK talker has found a new home: former afternoon firebrand Michael Graham starts a new version of his “Natural Truth” show today from noon-3 PM on a four-station network based at WCRN (830 Worcester). In addition to that big 50,000-watt signal, Graham”s new show will also be heard on WESO (970 Southbridge), WBNW (1120 Concord) and WPLM (1390 Plymouth).\n\nMore Radio People on the Move: former Boston jock Merilee Kelly is the new programming coordinator for John Garabedian”s Codcomm group on Cape Cod, where her duties will presumably include the eventual launch of two new formats to join the existing WPXC (Pixy 103) and WFRQ (Frank FM).\n\nOut west, Pamal is selling off a small Pioneer Valley AM signal that”s long been the odd man out in that Albany-based group. WPNI (1430 Amherst) was left behind as a standalone when Pamal spun off WRNX (100.9) to Clear Channel, and even by then Pamal had already stopped programming the 5000-watt AM signal, donating its airtime first to local public broadcaster WFCR and then (after WFCR relocated its AM programming to much bigger WNNZ 640) to a simulcast of Boston”s WUMB-FM as a “temporary” measure starting in 2007.\n\nNow Pamal has at last found a buyer for WPNI – and what an interesting buyer it appears to be. “The Love Radio Church, Inc.,” which has agreed to pay $100,000 for the station, appears on the surface to be just another small religious broadcaster…at least until one starts tracking down the names and addresses and phone numbers behind the principals listed on the application. The first clue, perhaps, is the typo that converted Brattleboro “VT” into Brattleboro “VA”. Put together a pile of typos and the “Love” name along with Brattleboro and the other town listed for one of the principals, Cairo, New York, and it all begins to point to one man behind the scenes.\n\nYes, Brian Dodge is back in action in the Pioneer Valley, just a few miles from the mountaintops where his unauthorized translator moves in the mid-1990s prompted an epic FCC complaint that eventually silenced several of those translators but never resulted in any more concrete action against Dodge by the Commission. In the years after that, Dodge ran several stations in Vermont and New Hampshire without benefit of full FCC licenses, got himself in serious trouble with the law in Vermont, and eventually ended up in New York”s Hudson Valley running WCKL (560 Catskill). That little AM station was booted from its longtime home after failing to pay rent to its landlord, Clear Channel, and is now reportedly operating at reduced power from a longwire antenna while being sold to what appears to be yet another Dodge “Love” shell.\n\nAnd wouldn”t you know it? The signatory on the asset purchase agreement for WPNI is one Tamara K. Thayer, who”s also signed applications for WCKL – and the phone number listed there is a (518) cell number that also points right back to WCKL.\n\nThe new “Love” group made a $10,000 deposit for WPNI and will pay $25,000 at closing, with Pamal financing the remaining $65,000. Will this “Love” do a better job of creating a going business than Dodge”s previous ventures? We”ll be watching closely…and we suspect Clear Channel will be, too, since WPNI”s signal can cause serious damage to Clear Channel”s 1430s in the Boston and Binghamton markets if it doesn”t drop from 5,000 watts to 11 watts at sunset.\n\n*There”s a station sale in southern RHODE ISLAND, too: Astro Tele-Communications is getting out of the radio business with an $800,000 sale of WADK (1540 Newport) and WJZS (99.3 Block Island). The buyer, 3G Broadcasting, is helmed by Bonnie and Kenneth Gomes and owns the “Oyster Radio” cluster in Apalachicola, Florida.\n\n*Back to CONNECTICUT for a moment: there”s late word of the death Sunday of Brian Garnett, who was a reporter with WPOP (1410 Hartford) and then on the political beat for WFSB (Channel 3) in the 1980s and 1990s. Garnett later worked as director of external affairs for the state”s corrections department.\n\n*Our NEW YORK coverage begins in lower Manhattan, where one of the city”s longest-serving broadcast engineers has parted way with the station he completely rebuilt last decade. Tom Ray”s time at WOR (710) lasted just over 15 years, and what a decade and a half it was: he oversaw the station”s move from its (very) longtime 1440 Broadway address downtown to the financial district, shepherded its New Jersey transmitter relocation through a veritable swamp of political and physical obstacles, and made himself a national lightning rod with his vocal initial support for HD Radio on AM.(Tom literally wrote the book on the topic, in fact.)\n\nRay had been serving as national director of engineering when Buckley Broadcasting sold WOR to Clear Channel last year, and he gave up the remaining Buckley stations to stay with WOR. Now he”s stepping down from that post to launch his own independent consultancy, Tom Ray Broadcast Consulting, with another big announcement coming tomorrow.\n\nMeanwhile over at Clear Channel”s main New York facility a few blocks away on Sixth Avenue, Marc Rivieccio is the new director of marketing for all five FM signals and WOR, moving up from director of promotions for the cluster.\n\nAnd over at CBS Radio, a bonus month (and then some) of all-Christmas music on WWFS (102.7)”s HD2 channel has finally ended, with smooth jazz now in place on that subchannel.\n\n*Up the Hudson, Polnet is looking for a buyer for WRKL (910 New City). Once the local voice for Rockland County, the station switched to Polnet”s Polish-language programming since 1999, when the Chicago-based company bought the signal for $1.625 million, evidently with the aim of serving the Polish community in New York City, some 35 miles to the south. For the last couple of years, WRKL has been leased out to the Spanish-language Radio Cantico Nuevo religious network, and now Polnet has listed the station for sale (via Media Services Group) at an asking price of $3 million.\n\n*Upstate, WYSX (96.7 Morristown) and WPAC (98.7 Ogdensburg) made it back on the air at reduced power just before the big storm hit the North Country late last week. Stephens Media is still working to fully rebuild the stations” shared transmitter site, which burned to the ground after a lightning hit in late January.\n\nA Rochester LPTV station is seeking to become a little less “low-power.” Now that Bill Christian”s Milachi Media has purchased WGCE-CA (Channel 6), it”s applying to move the station to digital operation on channel 25 with 15 kW of power from the rooftop of the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Rochester. That site, last used by WRUR (88.5) before its move to Pinnacle Hill a few years ago, would give WGCE coverage of most of Monroe County for the first time – and would wipe out our fringe reception here at NERW Central of Syracuse PBS station WCNY (Channel 24), which also operates digitally on channel 25.\n\n*Three obituaries from central New York: in Auburn, Dick Morgan”s name was synonymous with WAUB (1590), where he worked for three decades and even owned the station for a few years in the early 1990s under the Morgan Media banner. Morgan was instrumental in WAUB”s shift from daytime-only to fulltime status; he died Friday at 66. In Utica, Frank McBride worked at stations including WRCK (107.3) and WXUR (92.7), as well as as an on-air pitchman for a local car dealership. He was 54. And in Oneonta, they”re mourning Terry Doyle, whose commitment to independent media found him hosting shows on three community stations, local WUOW (88.5) and nearby WIOX (91.3 Roxbury) and Ithaca”s WRFI. Doyle suffered a heart attack in January and died on Wednesday, far too young at 46.\n\n*A mystifying PENNSYLVANIA story comes to us out of Pittsburgh, where WXDX (105.9) morning co-host Tim Benz abruptly disappeared from the modern rock station”s morning show on Friday after what he says was an impassioned on-air debate over gun control. Benz tells local papers that he “decided to step away from the morning show” because he “couldn”t step away from the debate” – but he also says he”s still under contract to Clear Channel and expects to reappear somewhere on the air there…which has our “publicity stunt” meter pegged pretty hard, for some reason.\n\nThere”s no publicity stunt surrounding WVSL (1240 Selinsgrove); the AM station long known as WYGL is simply gone all of a sudden, with Max Media returning its license to the FCC and its tower reportedly already gone. The station had most recently been running an all-sports format (as “The Game”) simulcast with WVSL-FM (92.3 Riverside), which remains on the air in the Susquehanna Valley.\n\nAcross the Alleghenies, the WLLI callsign that had been on 1150 in Huntingdon (now back to its old WHUN calls) has instead moved to 990 in Somerset, ex-WNTW.\n\nOver in the hills south of Pittsburgh, they”re mourning Jerry Braverman, who was the Saturday night jock on WLSW (103.9 Scottdale) for 15 years until his multiple sclerosis worsened last summer and he became unable to continue. Braverman had also worked at WEDO (810) and WIXZ (1360) in McKeesport and had served in the Navy and as a police officer in Forest Hills. Braverman died Tuesday (Feb. 5) at 66.\n\n*Radio People on the Move: in York, Chris Tyler has joined Cumulus” WSBA (910)/WGLD (1440) as PD/brand manager. Tyler recently parted ways with WTPA (92.1 Palmyra), where he”d been working as GM/PD/morning man after nearly two decades with Clear Channel in Harrisburg. In Lewisburg, Rob Kime is the new GM of religious WGRC (91.3) and its sister stations in the Susquehanna Valley; he replaces Larry Weidman, who”s retiring after more than two decades there. And on the western edge of the state, Matt Spaetz moves from the PD chair of WWIZ (103.9 Mercer) to sister Cumulus rocker WYFM (102.9 Sharon).\n\nIt”s still silent, but 1370 in the Philadelphia suburb of Pottstown has its heritage calls of WPAZ back. Four Rivers Community Broadcasting quietly swapped calls in late January, restoring WPAZ to 1370 in place of the WBZH calls installed in 2011 for the abortive attempt by a community group to restart the shuttered AM. The WPAZ calls had been parked at Four Rivers” 89.1 construction permit in Mohrsville, near Reading, and that signal has returned to its previous CP calls of WZMV. It”s also apparently on the air now, having filed for a license to cover on January 28.\n\nSports lineups are shifting in the state”s two biggest markets: in Pittsburgh, today brings a new schedule to CBS Radio”s KDKA-FM (93.7 the Fan), where Chris Mueller moves from the 10 PM shift to 2-6 PM, where he”ll join Josh Miller and Joe Starkey. Colin Dunlap moves up from weekends to the 10 PM-2 AM shift; the former Post-Gazette columnist will also write for the Fan website. Across the street at Clear Channel”s WBGG (ESPN 970), Joe Bendel is gone from the 4-7 PM show, replaced by former 2-4 PM host David Todd.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Jon Marks has a new noon-2 PM co-host at WPEN-FM (97.5 the Sports Fanatic), as Sean Brace replaces Brian Baldinger. Marks had also been co-hosting from 10-noon with Tony Bruno, who”s now solo in those hours, while Baldinger is now heard from 6-7 PM on weeknights.\n\nOver at Clear Channel, Frankie Darcell will take over afternoons on WDAS-FM (105.3) in March, but from a distance: she”s rejoining sister station WMXD (92.3) in Detroit after being laid off there in December, and will do a show for both markets from the Motor City.\n\n*On a relatively quiet week in CANADA, call letters (which will never be heard or seen on the air) are nonetheless our lead story from Montreal. Evanov”s new “Radio Fierte” on 990 now has call letters, CHRF, which means an on-air launch of the French-language service for gay and lesbian listeners is growing closer. CHRF will use the same technical plant as the former CKGM on 990, since moved to 690.\n\nOn TV, last week marked the official handoff of CJNT (Channel 62) from Channel Zero to Rogers as the new fulltime “CityTV” outlet for Montreal, now the easternmost link in the nearly-national network. The new Montreal City will launch a local “Breakfast TV” show in the next few months, joining a field made more crowded by the recent launch of a local morning show from 6-9 AM on Global”s Montreal outlet, CKMI (Channel 46). And there”s now a callsign for the “ICI” ethnic service that will launch on channel 47 as part of the CJNT-to-City conversion: it will be CFHG-TV when it launches later this year.\n\n*The CRTC has approved a big technical change for Newcap in Fredericton, New Brunswick: CFRK (92.3 Fred FM) will slightly boost power (from 40 kW to 42 kW average ERP, 93 to 100 kW max DA) and slightly increase antenna height (from 125 to 137 meters) as it relocates to the former CIHF-TV tower, where it will be diplexed with Newcap”s other Fredericton FM, the soon-to-debut CIHI (93.1). CIHI was to have run 21 kW average/50 kW max DA from 150 meters but will instead operate with the same power, height and DA as CFRK.\n\nOn Prince Edward Island, religious broadcaster CIOG has been granted power increases at both of its transmitters. Both CIOG (91.3 Charlottetown) and CIOG-1 (92.5 Summerside) will go from 50 to 250 watts.\n\nIn Truro, Nova Scotia, the CRTC denied an application from the town”s tourist information station, CJIS (107.1), to boost power from 2 watts to 550 watts (340 watts average DA).\n\nIn Quebec, CIQI (90.3 Montmagny) has been granted a second transmitter.
