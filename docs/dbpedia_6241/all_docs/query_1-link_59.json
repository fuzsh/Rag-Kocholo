        "text": "Bluelight Communications will launch Urban “105.5 The Beat” W288CS Rochester NY/102.7 WLGZ-HD2 Webster at 6pm today.\n\nHelmed by veteran programmer Mickey Johnson, the new new station will feature the syndicated Breakfast Club in mornings. Pamela Anise, former Program Director/Midday Host at iHeartMedia Urban “101.1 The Beat” WUBT Nashville, joins the station as APD/Midday Host. Afternoons and nights are currently vacant but Johnson is seeking applicants at Mjohnson@1055thebeat.com.\n\nJohnson joins Bluelight from Townsquare Media’s 92.9 WTUG Tuscaloosa AL where he served as Brand Manager. He has also programmed Urban stations in Jacksonville, Birmingham, and St. Louis including launching “95.7 Jamz” WBHJ and serving as OM for Radio-One’s “Hot 104.1” WHHL St. Louis.\n\nThe new format gives a competitor to Monroe County Broadcasting’s 103.9 WDKX, which had served as the only Urban or Urban AC station in the market.\n\nW288CS was purchased by record executives Lester Pace and Manny Bella in July for $650,000. The translator has completed its move to the Xerox Building in downtown Rochester where it is operating with 250w/153m giving it nearly full-market coverage.\n\nBluelight communications has tapped veteran programmer Mickey Johnson to oversee programming of the New Beat of Rochester WBZA-X1 (W288CS, 105.5, Simulcast with WGLZ. Mickey will handle all day day programming responsibilities.\n\nIn Mickey’s first move he secured the highly popular syndicated morning show “the breakfast club”. Also has hired Pamela Anese to handle the midday slot and also serve as APD. New start ups are the best, this will be my 4th looking forward to coming in and having lots of fun as we find a position in the market for ourselves. Mickey said he’ll be rounding out the rest of the staff in the coming months, he’ll need afternoon and night talent so Get you stuff to him at Mjohnson1055thebeat.com"
