        "text": "The station went on the air as WMCB on August 23, 1982. On October 23, 2005, the station changed its call sign to WSKT, and on November 29, 2005, to the current WMYJ.[4]\n\nAccording to filings with the FCC, the station transmitter site was flooded by 8Â½ feet of water in June 2008, and FCC granted approval to suspend operations pending replacement of equipment. The station returned to the air in September 2008, and shortly afterward added 24-hour FM service via a translator at 94.1 FM, formerly a local relay for the K-Love network.\n\nThe station now airs an adult contemporary format."
