History

On August 23, 1991, the station signed on the air. The original call sign was WLMF. On October 30, 1992, the station changed its call letters to WFUL, on February 3, 1993, to WDCZ, on August 1, 1997, to WDCZ-FM, on January 1, 2004, to WRCI.[5]

On February 11, 2008, the station, then owned by Crawford Broadcasting, ended its contemporary Christian format as WRCI "102.7 The Light" to make way for "Legends 102.7", a hybrid of oldies and adult standards. The "Legends" format was already featured on 990 AM WLGZ, which after simulcasting of the FM signal turned to a Christian talk and teaching format. AM 990 now carries the call letters WDCX, along with much of the programming of its sister station in Buffalo, WDCX-FM.

WLGZ was purchased by DJRA Broadcasting on January 1, 2010. Following WLGZ's sale from Crawford to DJRA, most adult standards titles were dropped from the station's playlist and WLGZ morphed into a straightforward oldies outlet featuring hits of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The format change for WLGZ has succeeded in increasing the station's audience.

The station's license was assigned to DJRO Broadcasting LLC on June 1, 2012. A noteworthy fact is that this station has not completely discarded songs and artists from the 1960s and early 1970s which are not commonly heard on commercial radio. However, WLGZ has adapted its playlist to feature a greater proportion of songs from the 1980s, as are heard on classic hits outlets.

On September 21, 2017, at 6 p.m., WLGZ-FM launched an urban contemporary format branded as "105.5 The Beat" on its HD2 subchannel, fed on translator W288CS.[6]
