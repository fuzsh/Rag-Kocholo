        "text": "R31 \"that her Daddy had been intimate with her?\"\n\nAre you kidding? The 1970s audience wasn't ready for that. Victor Lord was only slightly villainous in the early days. It was only years after the character's death that history was rewritten and he became an evil child molester and all-out rapist. It was even written in that he did all these horrible perverted things to Dorian because the writers had to come up with a way to revive her character after making her so irredeemable.\n\nThen of course, in true OLTL fashion, it turned out he wasn't dead after all and came back to Llanview to drink the blood of one of his granddaughters, (the most preposterous Llanview storyline ever??)\n\nI don't know if I necessarily agree with that. In the 70s soaps were much more cutting edge and willing to take provocative risks. I just don't think the connection between DID and childhood sexual trauma was ever even considered a possibility by the writers back then, because if it was even on the table they would have found a clever way to allude to it. I just think they went with the established history of how Viki developed DID. Soap just didn't do a whole lot of retconning in those days.\n\nOf the 4 remaining soaps, I can't imagine any of them doing some of the stories they did in the 70s without major backlash and protests. The audience and the world has changed too much. Hell, you couldn't even do some of those great Norman Lear sitcom from the 70s on network TV anymore.\n\nI was never a big watcher of OLTL, but I did watch it some in the 80s if I was home since it came in after AMC. Itâ€™s weird watching those other actors playing Karen, Jenny, Brad, etc.\n\nIn the clips here, looks like two different actresses playing Kathy Craig? One seems really strong and the other seems really drippy. Or am I mixing characters up? That character was gone by the time I watched back in the day.\n\nI am also too young to have watched the Alice/Steve/Rachel on AW. Did George Reinholt ping back then? He is FLAMING in these OLTL clips.\n\nI was puzzled that Erika Slezak put up with what happened to so many of the characters on that show. She just went along with making Victor Lord the world's most evil person ever?\n\nThe first Dorian was Nancy Pinkerton, who was a rather unremarkable woman looks-wise. She may have reminded some of Grayson Hall.\n\nNever understood why the writers seemed to write yet another nun character into the show. Kathy Glass was the saintly Jenny. Crystal Chappell was yet another nun twenty years later, who wore makeup and lipstick, which made no sense.\n\nJameson Parker was terrific as Brad the cad. He was dreamily handsome and flirted with waitresses on his honeymoon.\n\nOne of my favorite characters on this show ever was the fey Matt McAllister, henchman for Victor Lord, co-conspirator with Dorian, and obviously gay, but it was never revealed as such. OLTL has a bunch of background characters that gave the show a depth that other soaps lacked. Also loved Wanda, Vicky's chubby best friend and confidante. Also loved Jack Betts as the evil doctor Ivan Kipling.\n\n[quote]I was puzzled that Erika Slezak put up with what happened to so many of the characters on that show. She just went along with making Victor Lord the world's most evil person ever?\n\nI am no Slezak stan like a lot of you on here for reasons that are lost on me, but what were you expecting her to do? I get the feeling that Slezak was like a lot of old school soap broads, they came in, did their lines, and went home and only really bitched when it was something extreme.\n\n[quote]I'd forgotten that for a time OLTL ran for 45 minutes, sharing a 90 minute time slot with AMC.\n\nOLTL shared a 90 minute time slot with General Hospital, not AMC.\n\nIn July 1976, both GH and OLTL were expanded to 45 minutes. Then both were expanded to 60 min in Jan. 1978.\n\nAMC remained a 30 minute show until Jan. 1977 when it expanded to 60 minutes. Agnes Nixon had been very resistant to doing it as an hour on a permanent basis.\n\nHowever, AMC did experiment with an hour for a week in late June/early July 1975. AMC went to an hour for that week to prepare audiences for the launch of Ryan's Hope. AMC had aired at 1 p.m. from its start. But for that week of hour-long shows, it began at 12:30 p.m. Then when Ryan's Hope launched, it debuted at 1 p.m. and AMC reverted back to 30 minutes airing at 12:30 p.m.\n\n[quote]The 1970s audience wasn't ready for that. Victor Lord was only slightly villainous in the early days. It was only years after the character's death that history was rewritten and he became an evil child molester and all-out rapist.\n\nA FAR worse rewrite was the origins of Tess/Bess or whatever her name was. Jessica (Bree Williamson) was discovered to have been sexually exploited as a child while Niki Smith was out partying. There was a video discovered of her being abused, and the actors just looked heartbroken playing it which I'm sure they were in real-life.\n\nThe Niki story was exploitive, but was well written and fit the tone of the show in the 90s. What happened with Jessica was just the manipulation of the audience and really unpleasant.\n\nThe 90s rewrite of Viki's DID really delved into the entire psychology of Viki and it made sense. It wasn't a rewrite for the sake of a rewrite. Making Victor, Viki's abuser was brilliant and it didn't destroy Victor's character as much as it showed how good he was at fooling everybody. How often are we shocked when we find out that someone, we thought we knew, has committed some horrible act. It was good storyline.\n\nRon likes crazy ladies and he likes the camp and cartoony aspects of DID, which has it's place too, but was a total fuck you to what Michael Malone wrote. But Ron wasn't the only writer who kept going back to that DID well on that show. It was overused in my opinion. Michael Malone's story should have been the last of all of Viki's alters.\n\nI wish OLTL had explored the process of integrating all of Viki's alters in 1995 when Malone was doing that storyline.\n\nAs it was, Viki was working with Nora's psychiatrist sister Susannah Hanen on the integration. Then when it came time for Slestak's annual two-month vacation, they sent Viki off to a clinic in Switzerland to continue the process. And when Viki returned to town, it was all complete, supposedly.\n\nI know the process of integrating alters might not make for the most dramatic of storytelling, but I thought they should have tried to do more with that. They way they left it, you can have six alters, but go off on a two month vacation and have it all fixed.\n\nBut that's the sad thing, R112.\n\nNo one knows or seems to want to tell stories like that any more.\n\nThey want to do the reboot of AMC but I guarantee they'll take out all the nuances that made it special - the relationships, the older character actors, the humor - and just make it Slutty Young People, or focus on a noirish murder mystery that will have Lucci, if she's back, tossing her hair and batting her eyes like the days of old.\n\nSeems like TV only wants to do the Young People Acting Like Adults show (CW) or variations on Shonda Rhimes shows, where the stakes are racheted up higher and higher every week - all plot, no character.\n\nEllen Holly thought her groundbreaking storyline and seniority meant that she should have been treated with a certain level of respect and salary and that Nixon and others at ABC should have had her back, but instead let her down over and over.\n\nThe sad truth is the entertainment business in the late 60s - mid 70s was not kind to performers of color. Carla's story was never going to be the A story. It was always going to be limited.\n\nI am certain that she experienced some racism behind the scenes, which can be soul crushing and play games with your head. But also, I'm sure that there was some professional jealousy over Walter Slezak's daughter coming on the show, getting A stories and an A salary when she hadn't put in the work.\n\nI have no issues with Slezak, but I don't think she is the saint that a lot of you want to make her out to be. I don't know if she called Holly a name, but I am not willing to just assume that Holly is nuts and Slezak is above it all.\n\nI also find it sad, then when women of color have spoken out in this industry, they always get labeled as crazy.\n\nOne Life To Live post 1977 reminds me of that office some of have worked in where no matter HOW much you wish, you end up with a CUNT for a boss. When one asshole leaves, they still hire another one. Whereas other offices in your region all have the awesome bosses?\n\nJoe Stuart, Paul Rauch (makes Stuart look like a sweetie pie) and the Linda Gottlieb (from anything but an aesthetics standpoint, most her ideas were SHIT, and most of the B/C stories on OLTL were straight up garbage. And a lot of her OLTL truly did play like an ABC Afterschool special. Someone mentioned that above and it was brilliant.\n\nI guess that lady from Y&R who played Laurel on OLTL from 84-86? (married to Larry on the show- in real life she sings and plays the piano) said+ allegedly+ that Paul Rauch was absolutely vicious, and played people against each other. He was so bad, allegedly, that the show/ABC was fined by the UNION. This is all at the same timeframe that Ellen is talking about- This guy must have came onto this show like a demon!\n\nThe irony is I fucking love the Paul Rauch era- especially 85-88. 1990-91 was absolutely horrible.\n\nWhen you look back, the Gottlieb era- minus those key stories- AIDS Quilt, Marty's Rape, then Todd/Nora, Todd/Marty- the show was boring as a dishrag. So many of the supporting actors were boring as shit, as were the cliched storylines.. The only \"B\" storyline that worked was Carlo and Alex. They were electric- and SCARY! Loved all of their sex games- It was like those two characters were on a different show. And the show looked stunning. It is amazing how different Rauch and Gottlieb's shows LOOKED- Its interesting.\n\n[quote]And I will never believe that Slezak said what Holly says she did.\n\nTo me, and I guess I'm in the minority, is that Ellen believes that Slezak said it and that's all that matters. Ellen has been incredibly consistent over the years about that comment and has never backed down from it.\n\nPersonally, I don't think that Slezak would have said something like that publicly.\n\nBut you know what, if that set was as toxic as legend has said that it was at that particular time, then maybe someone told Ellen that Slezak said that to stir up shit. Or maybe she misheard something. This could all be a gigantic misunderstanding.\n\nI just have hated over the years how Ellen has gotten painted as a crazy.\n\nEvery story has multiple sides.\n\nWell fuck those asshole actors. They wanted typical soap stories that had been done to death. Gottlieb changed OLTL into powerful drama that could have been good for night time or films. I remember everyone on college campuses tried to schedule their classes so they could catch OLTL when it was actually on and would watch in large groups. That never happened with any soap before. The Gottlieb/Malone/Griffith combination was magic. That soaps never went with the times is one of the reasons most aren't on anymore, including OLTL. Gottlieb's touch would have made a difference if they stayed as exciting and powerful as they were during her short time on the show.\n\nI think that was Roger Howarth after a fight with Pam Long and it was a chair. He was pissed when he found out the DID story was going to be fake copied from some movie what was popular at the time. Only the movie was done seriously. Clown acting from Howarth was born from that whole thing. He never seemed to put his heart into anything on OLTL or ATWT after that. He just phoned it in and collected his paycheck, to this day. There was talk of the original story, as written by Labine before she was fired by JFP and joke writer Long took her place was of Emmy winning caliber. It was the kind of story that would have gotten Howarth noticed by night time and films if he played it right and if anyone remembers the very beginning of the DID story he was playing it very real and seriously and suddenly he was playing it for laughs. Too bad. I always wondered if he had the chops to do a story like that, about the raping of Todd as a child, right.\n\nMany years later he would play the story of his GH character, Franco, remembering being raped as a 4 year old boy and while he was a little better during the big reveal in that story, it was just so so. It wasn't Emmy winning material. In fact I think the actor who played his childhood \"almost\" brother, did a better job with his part in the that story, how he reacted to and helped Franco and such.\n\nWell one thing for sure, the fucking up Todd's DID story on OLTL back in 1998 sure brought out a slew of some amazingly written fan fictions. I remember thinking if only some of those writers were actually writing the show.\n\nThis is what I think based on what I've read and general subtext. ABC was planning to do a slow phase out of soaps. They decided to move AMC to LA where it would be cheaper to produce. They left OLTL in NYC because they planned to cancel it to make way for a 3rd hour of Good Morning America.\n\nBecause OLTL was the highest rated soap on the lineup, they could not justify cancelling OLTL and not AMC. OLTL was higher rated, but AMC was the more iconic show, so they just decided to cancel them both and go with cheaper chat programming.\n\nIf the Chew and the Revolution (?) would have been successful, I have no doubt that GH probably would have gone the following year. Eventually The Chew built an audience, the other one was not so lucky and they eventually turned that hour back over to the affiliates for the Couric talk show.\n\nAs for the 3rd hour of GMA, because of the popularity of the Kelly Ripa talk show, they can't get three consecutive hours. Which is better for ratings, ad buys, and just general program synergy.\n\nI believe in my gut, that the only thing that keeps GH on the air is Days of our Lives. The minute NBC decides to cancel Days, expect a GH announcement to follow. ABC is like Proctor and Gamble, they want out, but they are waiting for someone else to pull the trigger first.\n\nThis was just the start of OLTL's storylines from late 1994, soon after this came Dorian seducing her step-grandson Joe for revenge against Viki (for her being on death row for Victor's murder), which led to Viki remembering she had been raped by her own father.\n\nThey were obviously going all out for a ratings war at this time, as there's lots of sex and naughtiness.\n\nMarlena's possession on Days of Our Lives was starting up at this point, but that era did not age well. This 1993/1994 era of OLTL looks like it could have been made yesterday.\n\nDespite 1993-1994's great additions like Todd, Marty, David Vickers, Blair, there were some not-so-great characters added to OLTL at this time.\n\nSloan Carpenter for one. Not sure why Viki married him, he's kind of dour, and not great looking like Viki's usual husbands, she was obviously still attracted to Clint at the time. His son the priest was also dour.\n\nAlso, Luna, not sure what the point of her character was, but she reminds me of that other pointless character Felicity LaFortune played on AMC at the time.\n\nTonja Walker's big, flashy character Alex Olanov was starting to seem like something out of the Dynasty era at this point, she was at odds with all the realism.\n\nWatching the clip posted by R223 made me ache for OLTL. I watched it as a teenager because it came on after Dark Shadows. It followed it intermittently during college but then afterwards watched it steadily. I even recorded it on my VCR when I went abroad for work or travel. When it was good, it was great, and when it was bad, it was laughable. But it was a community of people I knew and cared about. Even seeing that little clip -- and I remember when there was suddenly a new Carlotta -- I recalled how interestingly they handled the Fish-is-gay story, not to mention how capably David Fumero handled his straight-guy-friend role. And how unbelievable beautiful Layla was. Did I mention David Fumero's guns?"
