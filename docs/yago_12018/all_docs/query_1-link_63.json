        "text": "On Jan. 4, Joan Copeland passed away peacefully in her sleep at her Manhattan home on Central Park West. The 99-year-old actress was a veteran performer of stage, television, and film who had appeared on several soap operas during her extensive career. She played twins Maggie and Kay on LOVE OF LIFE from 1960-’63, and troublemaker Andrea Whiting on SEARCH FOR TOMORROW from 1967-’72. Copeland also had brief turns as THE EDGE OF NIGHT’s Mary Appleman, HOW TO SURVIVE A MARRIAGE’s Monica Courtland, ATWT’s Joan Rogers and Greta Aldrin, LOVING’s Claudia, and Nora’s mom on ONE LIFE TO LIVE, Selma Hanen.\n\nWith his wife by his side, THE EDGE OF NIGHT star Donald May passed away at home on Jan. 28 at the age of 94. After spending a decade playing Adam Drake on the ABC and CBS soap (from 1967-’77), May went on to play the mayor of Llanview on OLTL, Earl Foster on ALL MY CHILDREN, Raymond Speer on ATWT, and Grant Wheeler on TEXAS. He also had roles on primetime sudsers DALLAS and FALCON CREST.\n\nJerry verDorn made left his mark on daytime audiences over the course of his career, first playing GL patriarch Ross Marler from 1979 until 2005 and then moving over to OLTL as a recast of Clint Buchanan, playing the character through the end of the broadcast run and the series’ online revival in 2013. Along the way, verDorn was nominated for multiple Daytime Emmy Awards, taking home the win twice in 1995 and 1996. The actor died on May 1 at the age of 72 after a months-long battle with cancer.\n\nAfter it was mistakenly reported on July 26 that actor Tony Dow had passed away, the veteran actor died the following day, surrounded by his loved ones, after a battle with cancer. While Dow was famously known for his role of Wally Cleaver in the 1950s sitcom LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, he appeared on GH in the mid-1970s as police officer Ross Jeanelle and on NEVER TOO YOUNG in 1965 as race car driver Chet. Dow was 77.\n\nAlthough best known for her groundbreaking role as communications officer Lt. Nyota Uhura on the original STAR TREK series, Nichelle Nichols made an impact when she appeared on Y&R in 2016 as Neil’s estranged mother, Lucinda Winters. The storyline in which Neil made peace with the mother who abandoned him before she passed away earned Nichols a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Performer and the late Kristoff St. John (Neil) an Outstanding Lead Actor nod. Nichols died on July 30 at the age of 89 from natural causes.\n\nCritically injured after crashing her car into a Los Angeles home on Aug. 5, Anne Heche died a week later at the age of 53. The actress had slipped into a coma shortly after the accident, during which she suffered severe brain damage and bodily burns. She was placed on life support so her organs could be harvested for donation and died on Aug. 12. Heche’s acting career was launched shortly after she graduated high school when she was tapped by ANOTHER WORLD to play twins Vicky Hudson and Marley Love. During her 1987-1991 run, Heche was twice nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress, taking home the honor the second time at the 1991 ceremony.\n\nAward-winning writer Michael Malone died at home in Clinton, CT, on Aug. 19 at the age of 80. One of daytime’s most prolific scribes, Malone was best known for his tenure as OLTL’s headwriter from 1991-’96. In addition to writing the critically acclaimed storyline in which Father Andrew befriended gay teen Billy Douglas, Malone created the character of Todd Manning and penned the gang rape of Marty Saybrooke and the subsequent trial. That storyline not only garnered Malone’s writing team a Daytime Emmy Award at the 1994 ceremony, but Hilary B. Smith (Nora), Susan Haskell (Marty), and Roger Howarth (Todd), all took home awards as well for their performances. In addition to his work on the ABC sudser, Malone held the top scribe spot at ANOTHER WORLD in 1997 before returning to OLTL in 2003.\n\nAfter a three-year battle with pancreatic cancer, actor Robert LuPone died on Aug. 27, in Albany, NY. The brother of Broadway icon Patti LuPone, he had earned a Tony nomination himself for playing Zach in the original Broadway production of A Chorus Line and co-starred in the film version of the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar as the Apostle James. LuPone’s daytime credits included Chester Wallace on RYAN’S HOPE in 1979, Tom Bergman on SEARCH FOR TOMORROW in 1983, Neal Cory on ANOTHER WORLD in 1985, and both Charley Nichols and Leonard Brill on LOVING in the early 1990s. The actor also earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for his work as AMC villain Zach Grayson in 1983, and he closed out his soap career playing shady lawyer Leo Flynn, one of Roger Thorpe’s minions, on GL in the ’90s.\n\nVeteran actor Mark Miller was 97 years old when he died on Sept. 9. “My Papa’s beautiful soul left this Earth,” announced his daughter, actress Penelope Ann Miller. “He loved deeply and was loved by all who knew him. He touched many lives. He was funny, fun, and always creating. He cherished this life and saw the glass half full! I was blessed to call him my dad.” In addition to his work in primetime and theater, Miller played Randy Washburn on GH in 1965, Howard Jones on BRIGHT PROMISE in 1970, and J.R. Barnett on DAYS from 1975-’76.\n\nRobert Gentry passed away on Sept. 17, just 12 days shy of what would have been his 82nd birthday. He made his daytime debut in 1965 playing Brad Murphy on THE DOCTORS, and appeared on A WORLD APART, OLTL, GENERATIONS, DAYS, ANOTHER WORLD, and B&B over the course of his career. But Gentry was best known for his portrayal of GL’s Ed Bauer (from 1966-’69 and again from 1997-’98) and AMC’s Ross Chandler (1983-’89).\n\nAnn Flood — who was the longest-running cast member on THE EDGE OF NIGHT thanks to her portrayal of Nancy Karr from 1962 until the soap went off the air in 1984 — died on Oct. 7 at the age of 87. She made her daytime debut playing Liz Fraser Allen on FROM THESE ROOTS from 1958-’61, and also portrayed Ella Hobbs on SEARCH FOR TOMORROW, Rose Livingston on ANOTHER WORLD, Bitsy Davidson on AMC, Helen Guthrie on OLTL, and Ruth Mansfield on ATWT.\n\nLegendary actor John Aniston was 89 years old when he died on Nov. 11. He created the role of Victor Kiriakis on DAYS in July 1985 and played the character for over 30 years until his final appearance on the Dec. 26 episode — during which the soap honored the beloved actor with a montage of Victor clips through the years. The final scene of the episode featured the beloved yet cantankerous crime boss sailing off into the sunset on his yacht… aptly named Victor.\n\n“You were one of the most beautiful humans I ever knew,” his daughter, actress Jennifer Aniston, wrote in announcing her father’s death. “I am so grateful that you went soaring into the heavens in peace — and without pain. And on 11/11, no less! You always had perfect timing. That number will forever hold, and even greater meaning for me now. I’ll love you ’til the end of time.”\n\nThe GH community was shocked when Sonya Eddy (Ephiphany) died on Dec. 19 at the age of 55. According to Eddy’s producing partner and close friend, Tyler Ford, she fell ill following a scheduled surgery on Dec. 9 and was admitted to the hospital on Dec. 15, where doctors discovered she’d developed a serious infection. After being placed on life support, Eddy passed away on Dec. 19. “I am heartbroken about the loss of the incredible Sonya Eddy,” said GH executive producer Frank Valentini in a statement. “I truly loved her, not only as an actress but as a friend. The lights in the hub of the nurse’s station will now be a little dimmer, but her spirit and light will live on in both the show and our set.”"
