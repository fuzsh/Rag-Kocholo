        "text": "Elizabeth Hubbard was the first winners for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama for her role as Althea Davis on NBC’S The Doctors (I would love to know what her reel was). In 1975 Susan Flannery won for her role as Dr. Laura Horton on Days of Our Lives (I wonder if she picked Laura revealing that she was raped by Bill and that Mike was his son and not Mickey’s as her reel?). Flannery would later win 3 more Emmys for her role as Stephanie Forrester on The Bold and The Beautiful in 2000 (Brooke and Stephanie’s showdown at Big Bear), 2002 (Stephanie finds out that Massimo is Ridges father), and 2003 (Stephanie fakes her heart Attack).

In 2019 Jacqueline MacIness Wood won for her role as Forrester Creations CEO Steffy Forrester Spencer (Liam finds out that Bill and Steffy slept together/Steffy begs Liam to keep their family together/Steffy catches Liam with Hope).\n\nI have been fortunate enough to see all of Elizabeth Hubbard’s performances in 1973-74 since they have been shown on RetroTV. During that year Althea was married to the nefarious villain Dr. John Morrison but was in love with her ex-husband Dr. Nick Bellini. She also had many scenes with her daughter Penny (Julia Duffy), who was a handful. She had friendship scenes with Dr. Maggie Powers and Dr. Matt Powers. I am glad she won mainly because she never did win despite 8 nominations – and 7 in a row! – for playing Lucinda Walsh on As The World Turns.\n\nI have also scene all of the performances from Helen Gallagher’s 3 Emmy wins. Maeve was a supporting character, who never really did have much lead material, albeit her 3rd Emmy Maeve did have a bit of a storyline with Da’s infidelity years before. She was superb as Maeve and had wonderful scenes with all of her on-screen children and daughters-in-law (particularly Delia and Jillian for the latter, and the original Mary (Kate Mulgrew) for the former).\n\nI saw many of the episodes for which Judith Light won her two Emmys. She was terrific as Karen and while she wasn’t my choice to win it’s easy to see why they chose her. Her courtroom scenes in 1979-80 were particularly memorable – she had been prostituting herself for money and it came out on the witness stand.\n\nI am particularly glad that Robin Strasser won her Emmy as she was my very favorite Best Actress Emmy winner ever! She worked mostly with Anthony Call as her husband Herb Callison in 1981-82, and of course six-time Emmy winner Erika Slezak. The latter is a terrific actress but I resent her winning so many times. I felt that Robin ought to be the six time Emmy winner and honestly I would have only given Erika her 1991-92 Emmy. I prefer Dorian to Vicky and her alters.\n\nDorothy Lyman was phenomenal as the REAL Opal Gardner (Jill Larson was a pale imitation). Her 2 1/2 year stint as Opal was phenomenal. She was one of only 2 AMC actresses to ever win this category. (Mary Fickett won for “Individual Achievement” in which the other nominees included another actor, directors, lighting directors, etc.).\n\nKim Zimmer won 4 Emmys. I love her but felt she often chewed the scenery too much. I would have voted for other actresses (Robin Strasser, Elizabeth Hubbard, Jeanne Cooper and Beth Ehlers) the years she won, but I would have voted for her over Susan Lucci when she did the crazy Dolly the clone story!\n\nMarcy Walker was superb as Eden – and as Liza – and I am glad she won her Emmy for the rape storyline. She was amazing!\n\nI was not happy with Finola Hughes’s win. That was the year of Casey the Alien. I wanted Julia Barr to win for AMC that year. I am not a big fan of hers – she’s good but I have never really cared about her characters.\n\nLinda Dano was wonderful as Felicia Gallant and she had a story around alcoholism and grieving her husband’s death. I would have preferred Ellen Dolan’s Margo and her rape storyline for the Emmy win that year but at least she lost to someone who did phenomenal work!\n\nHillary B Smith is an all-time favorite and she was brilliant in the rape trial storyline when Marty was raped and Todd was one the rapists. So glad she won. Disappointed she was only nominated one more time (for 1999). So deserving of her award!\n\nI don’t like Jess Walton and was disappointed by both of her wins (one for Supporting Actress and one for lead). I wanted Genie Francis or Jensen Buchanan to win. I was unhappy when Walton’s name was called.\n\nCynthia Watros was great as crazy Annie but I would have definitely voted for Eileen Davidson, who played 5 characters on Days that year.\n\nI have never particularly liked Susan Lucci, resent her 21 nominations – I feel that they were name recognition nominations and not fully deserved. She’s a good actress but not a great one. I would have never voted for her ever. Julia Barr is my all-time favorite AMC actress. She also robbed Kate Collins of a nomination in 1991-92 for her dual roles of Natalie and Janet that year.\n\nSusan Flannery won 4 Emmys. I have never seen her work on Days. She was always my favorite on B&B and I miss her on that show.\n\nMartha Byrne played a dual role in 2000. Lily and Rose. I think the 3 AMC actresses cancelled each other out. I would have voted for Marcy Walker’s Liza Colby Chandler that year, and I loved Julia Barr’s Brooke too. But I love Martha Byrne. It was her 2nd Emmy and the first to win when her previous win was for Younger Actress.\n\nMichelle Stafford won 2 Emmys – the other for Supporting Actress. She is the REAL Phyllis.\n\nMaura West is one of my all-time favorite actresses. Her Carly Tenney Snyder was one of my very favorite characters – I would have nominated her all 14 times she was eligible for that role, and at least 6 times for Ava on GH. My very favorite Best Actress wins were hers for 2006 and 2009 – so incredibly happy! She was my 2nd choice for 2014 and was really disappointed that year since I wanted Alison Sweeney to win so so so much! Still I am glad she won for playing Ava. Surprised she hasn’t won a 4th Emmy yet but perhaps she will on the 26th?\n\nJeanne Cooper won for playing my favorite character on Y&R: Kay Chancellor! While she wasn’t my choice for 2007 – I preferred Maura for playing the storyline where Carly thought she was dying. But I loved JC and am glad she got a competitive Emmy.\n\nSusan Haskell was not a favorite of mine. I was disappointed. I wanted Debbi Morgan to win for the return of Jessie back from the dead scenes.\n\nLaura Wright’s Carly – well, I don’t like her but she’s an excellent actress. I was rooting for Colleen Zenk’s Barbara on ATWT that year.\n\nI really dislike Heather Tom. I resent her 5 Emmys. I know I am in a very small minority who doesn’t care for her acting but I just plain don’t like her. I think I would have voted for Crystal Chappell for Days for 2011 and Susan Flannery for B&B for 2012.\n\nEileen Davidson won for both of her signature roles: Kristen on Days and Ashley on Y&R. I was ecstatic with her 2013 win but would have voted for Nancy Lee Grahn on her 2017 win. She’s phenomenal in both roles.\n\nGina Tognoni – I was not crazy about her Phyllis mainly because I regard Michelle Stafford as the real Phyllis. I loved Gina’s work on One Life To Live and her 2-time Emmy winning role for Supporting Actress on Guiding Light. I must say her acceptance speech was one of the most gracious ever though.\n\nJacqueline MacInnes Wood’s win was one of the biggest Emmy surprises ever. I really like her but I really wanted Maura to win last year.\n\nWho will win this year? Finola, Katherine, Heather (yet again), Maura or Arianne?\n\nElizabeth Hubbard was the first winners for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama for her role as Althea Davis on NBC’S The Doctors (I would love to know what her reel was). In 1975 Susan Flannery won for her role as Dr. Laura Horton on Days of Our Lives (I wonder if she picked Laura revealing that she was raped by Bill and that Mike was his son and not Mickey’s as her reel?). Flannery would later win 3 more Emmys for her role as Stephanie Forrester on The Bold and The Beautiful in 2000 (Brooke and Stephanie’s showdown at Big Bear), 2002 (Stephanie finds out that Massimo is Ridges father), and 2003 (Stephanie fakes her heart Attack). In 1976 and 1977 Helen Gallagher won back to back Emmys for her role as Ryan matriarch Maeve Ryan (I have no clue what her reels were I’d love to know). She would later win again in 1988 (Maeve has a heartfelt talks to John while he’s fighting for his life). In 1978 Laurie Heinemann won her Emmy for her role as Sharlene Frame Matthews on Another World (Sharlene tells Russ about her past as a prostitute).

In 1985 Kim Zimmer won her first of 4 Emmys for her role as “The Slut of Springfield” Reva Shayne Lewis Lewis Spaulding Lewis Winslow Cooper Lewis O’Neill on Guiding Light (HB comforts Reva after the whole fountain scene). She won again in 1987 (Reva’s suicide attempt/the black and white episode with Reva and Kyle), 1990 (Reva confronts Pharoah about almost molesting her as a child/Reva’s wedding day morning to Josh), and 2006 (Reva finds out that she has menopause/Reva tells Josh that he’s not good enough for her). In 1989 Marcy Walker won her Emmy for her iconic role Eden Capwell on Santa Barbara (Eden deals with fact that she’s been raped). In 1991 Finola Hughes won Lead Actress for her role as Anna Devane on General Hospital (Anna talks to Casey the alien about sex). In 1993 Linda Dano won for her role as novelist Felicia Gallant Castiglione on Another World (Lorna confronts Felicia about her alcoholism). In 1994 Hillary B.

In 2008 Jeanne Cooper won for her legendary role as Katherine Chancellor on The Young and The Restless (Kay tells Jill that she gave her baby away).

In 2019 Jacqueline MacIness Wood won for her role as Forrester Creations CEO Steffy Forrester Spencer (Liam finds out that Bill and Steffy slept together/Steffy begs Liam to keep their family together/Steffy catches Liam with Hope).\n\nWhen Irene Daily won her Emmy, it was still under the three tape submission rule book. Her first reel was a charming episode of Jim Mathews asking her to join him for lunch. The second reel was Liz gossiping in church. And for the life of me I can’t remember her third submission. I think ( but I could be wrong ) it was a fight scene w/ Rachael who came over to torment Alice who was on the verge of yet another emotional breakdown.\n\nRobin Strasser dazzled everyone with her Emmy winning submissions.One minute she’s tough as acrylic nails and then the next, childlike, vulnerable and you’re ready to forgive her for the chaos she created with Herb’s campaign for Governor of Llanview.\n\nAnd Zimmer didn’t submit the ” Slut of Springfield ” episode for her first Emmy win.\n\nYou’re incorrect about Laura Wright’s Emmy winning submission. It wasn’t Carly confronting Dominic. It was the episode where she tells Michael to be strong and he will survive prison before he’s taken away to Pentonville."
