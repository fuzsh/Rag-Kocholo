        "text": "OLTL Year in Review\n\n2010 in Llanview has come to a close and as we look towards 2011 let’s take a look back at what happened this year. 2010 brought us the reunion and wedding of a longtime fan favorite couple, the death of one of the most hated characters to ever step foot in Llanview, the introduction of a family of himbos, a man who was apparently responsible for all the crimes in Llanview (and I don’t mean Mitch Laurence), and a mass cast exodus of complex characters played by talented actors. 2010 in Llanview also taught us to get 4th and 5th opinions from doctors, that enemies can become friends, it taught us how not to use air quotes, and that your brother can turn out to be your father and he probably killed your mother. So now let us explore the Best and the Worst of OLTL 2010.\n\nBest Story\n\nBo and Nora Reunite and Get Married. After leaning on each throughout 2009 during Matthew’s paralysis, surgery, and recovery, Bo and Nora finally got their act together and decided to give their romance another try. After he was shot by SuddenlyPsychoSchuyler, Bo asked the big question and Nora said yes. They got married in the most hilarious, over-the-top wedding in recent memory which ended with my favorite couples’ montage of 2010 set to Cheap Trick’s “The Flame”.\n\nRunner Up: Viki and Dorian Team Up to Take Down Echo.\n\nWorst Story\n\nTeen Jess. I don’t even know where to begin with this trainwreck of a story. Jessica reverted back to 17 because her psychopath bio father gave her electro shock therapy and then tried to rape her. Teen Jess then spent the next few months running around Llanview acting like a lovestruck idiot which Real Teen Jess never was. It made Clint and Viki look like the worst parents in the world for allowing their mentally ill daughter to run around town and stalk her long-ex-boyfriend, neglect her daughter, and be a general annoyance to viewers. Jessica finally got her memory back and re-entered 2010 after Himbo #1 decided that having sex with a mentally ill woman (and possibly knocking her up) was a great idea. The story was horrible and whoever thought it would be a good idea should never be allowed to write again.\n\nRunner Up: Rex and His Never-Ending, Highly Annoying Search for His Parents.\n\nBest Recast\n\nTom Degnan as Joey Buchanan. I was initally skeptical when I learned that Tom Degnan had been cast as Joey because his performance on ATWT as the final Adam Munson didn’t exactly wow me but I soon realized that Degnan’s performance on ATWT was mainly due to horrible writing and the awful character destruction done previously to the character of Adam. So far Degnan has been doing a good job which in no small feat considering Nathan Fillion was the last actor to play Joey. Plus there is the added funny bonus of Terri Conn playing his girlfriend on OLTL when she previously played his aunt on ATWT.\n\nRunner Up: Gina Tognoni as Kelly Cramer. Not technically a recast because Tognoni was the first Kelly Cramer but since the character was last played by Heather Tom then in falls under the recast category.\n\nWorst Recast\n\nBilly Warlock as Ross Rayburn. This may actually be one of the worst recasts in the history of OLTL. The role of Ross was originally played by Shawn Christian in 2002 who now plays Dr. Daniel Jonas on DOOL and was recast in 2009 with Michael Lowry. I’m not trying to be mean here but Billy Warlock is much shorter than Lowry which was well…just plain old bad. Kassie DePaiva is a very tall woman and trying to watch scenes between Blair and Warlock’s Ross was just painful. Blair could have squashed this version of Ross with her shoe. And to make matters even worse was the fact that Ross’ brother was being played by the much taller Matt Walton. I bought Lowry and Walton as brothers but Warlock and Walton as brothers wasn’t believeable and I didn’t buy it. Next time you recast a character OLTL make there isn’t such a large height difference.\n\nRunner-Up: None because unless I’m forgetting someone then there were no more characters who were recast in 2010.\n\nBest Twist\n\nAllison Perkins is Dr. Joplin’s Sister. The reason I made this the Best Twist was because it was the only thing this year that I didn’t see coming and it wasn’t in any of the spoilers. I was as shocked as poor Schuyler was at the news that Allison and the late doctor were related. Note to OLTL: Come up with better plots twists because it’s sad when this is the best plot twist all year.\n\nRunner-Up: Ummm…I’ll let any readers out there make their own suggestion for Best Twist.\n\nWorst Twist\n\nClint is Rex’s Father (and Echo is His Mother). So in 2009 we finally (or so we thought) learned that Mitch Laurence was Rex’s father. Except it turned out that Schuyler was really Roxy and Mitch’s child and Rex was just an abandoned baby that Allison took from the hospital and gave to Roxy telling her that it was Roxy’s son. Then Rex learned he was half-Native American (I giggled for weeks at this one) through a boring and contrived “adventure” story with the albatross of OLTL aka Rex and Gigi. But wait…no…Rex isn’t Native American because the letters he found that were written between his parents were fakes. The story behind his mother’s half of the necklace…also fake. It turns out that Clint Buchanan masterminded these fake parents for Rex because…well he doesn’t want Rex for a son (not that I can blame him). Echo is Rex’s mom and to keep Clint from throwing his own son in jail she lied to Charlie and told him that he was Rex’s father. Yeah that’s a nice game to play with a recovering alcoholic who just buried a son a year ago.\n\nRunner-Up: Inez Salinger is the mother of Ford and James. She must have had Ford when she was 10.\n\nBest Death\n\nStacy Morasco Sinks to Her Icy Grave. In proving that TIIC do sometimes listen to viewers, they finally answered the prayers of many viewers by dropping this horrid character into an icy lake. Death isn’t supposed to be funny but somehow OLTL managed to make Stacy’s death completely hysterical. Fish and Rex made the lamest attempt ever at trying to save Stacy from becoming a popsicle and Stacy finally sunk down to her watery and cold grave.\n\nRunner-Up: Nothing even comes close to the amazingness of Stacy’s AboutFreakingTimeDeath.\n\nWorst Death\n\nEddie Ford Becomes Llanview’s Newest WhoDunit. After being on the show for around a month TIIC decided to kill Eddie off to give us a whodunit starring the Himbo Family. Ummm…I don’t really care who killed Eddie unless it was one of the himbos and they get sent to jail and removed from my screen. I’m just mad that Eddie didn’t get to kill off one of his himbo sons before biting the bullet.\n\nRunner-Up: Elijah Clark is Killed By Cole Thornhart…While in Police Custody.\n\nBest Descent into Madness\n\nDr. Marty Saybrooke. Things started to go down hill with Marty after Eli shoved her down the stairs and caused her to lose her baby. Then John left her and went back to Natalie who ended up pregnant. As if this wasn’t enough, Cole kills Eli and is sent to jail. Marty had attempted to take the fall for Cole’s actions but Natalie found evidene pointing to Cole and Cole wouldn’t have let her anyway. Marty swore revenge and discovered that John might not be the father of Natalie’s baby and she was able to get proof (presuambly anyway) that Brody is the father of Natalie’s baby. And Natalie isn’t the only one at the receiving end of Marty’s wrath…if I was Todd Manning I would be sleeping with one eye open. As a good girl and victim Marty isn’t a good character but as a scheming, revenge seeking loon Marty is just made of awesome. Keep it up Marty!\n\nRunner-Up: Clint Buchanan as Asa Jr.\n\nWorst Descent into Madness\n\nElijah Clark as the Evilest Evil Who Ever Eviled. One day Eli is a lawyer who is in love with Blair and the next day he’s a mustache-twirling, serial kiling, super villian. Eli pushed Marty down the stairs because…ummm…actually I’m not sure why. Eli bashed Ford’s skull in because…ummm…not sure about that one either. Everything else he did was because of money but considering the elaborateness of his plan you would think it probably would have been easier for him to rob a bank to get the money.\n\nRunner-Up: Schuyler Joplin Becomes a Gun-Toting Loon and Shoots Bo.\n\nBest Couple\n\nViki Lord Banks and Charlie Banks. I find Viki and Charlie to be the most realistic and relatable couple on OLTL. The struggles they faced following Jared’s death and now with Echo come off as very real and raw. I just hope that Echo doesn’t do too much damage and her presence is just another bump in the road for this couple.\n\nRunner-Up: Bo Buchanan and Nora Hanen Buchanan.\n\nWorst Couple\n\nLangston Wilde and Robert Ford. Ford is a slimeball who liked sleeping with barely legal teenagers and mentally ill women. Langston cheated on Markko who walked out on his family for her with the Lead Himbo. Langston is a freshman in college while Ford is a professor at the same college. Their relationship is beyond gross and makes Langston look like a pathetic idiot.\n\nRunner-Up: Rex Balsom and Gigi Morasco.\n\nMost Improved Actor\n\nShenell Edmonds as Destiny Evans. Edmonds was very green when she started and it showed. But with working with experienced actors and probably taking acting classes she has remarkably improved the the past year. Her scenes where she learned that Greg was her father were amazing and I totally felt and bought her pain of being lied to her entire life.\n\nCharacter That Has Run His/Her Course\n\nTodd Manning. Todd started out as a frat boy who led the gang rape on Marty Saybrooke. Todd was originally highly complex and completely screwed up character who had been abused by his psychotic adoptive father. The Todd I see today on my screen is still a little screwed up but there is nothing complex about him at all. He is nothing but a schoompy, emo podd of a formally great character. I’m tired of seeing Todd pout and shout empty and lame threats. Trevor St. John looks bored and seems to be sleeping through all his scenes that I’m beginning to think he is just as bored and over the character as I am. Either transform Todd back into what he originally was after the gang rape or get rid of the character because schoompy and love sick are not characteristics of the Real Todd Manning. (Note: I do not mean bring back Roger Howarth for the record. Just fix the character).\n\nMost Over-Used Plot Device\n\nCharacters Going Crazy. Mitch, Allison, and Stacy were already loons but Schuyler, Hannah, Greg, Eli, Marty, Cole, Jessica, Eddie, and Clint all lost their marables in 2010 (although in Jessica and Cole’s case they’ve always been a little nutty). That is way too much crazy on one show. If I want to see a bunch of nut jobs then I will watch Criminal Minds.\n\nBiggest WTH? of 2010\n\nCasting Jessica Leccia as Inez Salinger. If they wanted Inez to be Ford and James’ mother in addition to Nate then they should have cast an older actress. Leccia is 34-years-old and David Gregory (Ford) is 25. I do not buy them as mother and son. Brother and sister…sure. Leccia’s Inez should have been James and Ford’s sister who ran away from their abusive father because she was a pregnant teen. It would make me buy Inez as Nate’s mom and be much more believable. And casting 55-year-old John Wesley Shipp as Eddie Ford did not help either.\n\nI was not very fond of OLTL in 2010 and I hope in 2011 that won’t be the case. 2010 started out shaky then went from bad to worse and towards the end of the year started to find it’s footing again. I hope the upward trend continues so I will be able to watch on a more regular basis because I really do miss watching the show everyday. So here’s to hoping that 2011 in Llanview will be a lot better than 201o.\n\nA Whodunit?…With the Himbo Family…And A Psycho is Back!\n\nIn OLTL’s never-ending quest to shove the Ford Family down viewers throats, they’ve decided to kill Abusive Papa Ford and make the rest of the Ford Family look like suspects.\n\nAm I supposed to care that a character who appeared a month ago kicked the bucket? Am I supposed to care that characters who have been on the show less than a year (with the exception of Himbo #1) are all possible suspects? Cause I don’t. I don’t care who killed Eddie Ford unless it was a well-established character and that scenario would get a big WTH from me for destorying another long-time character to prop this newbie family. Of course none of the Fords probably have the guts to kill Eddie anyway. Ford let Eli bash his head in, James couldn’t even wrestle a gun away from Hannah the Crazy Banana, Nate acts like a Mama’s Boy, and Inez…well actually she’s probably the only Ford with the guts to kill someone cause girlfriend is slightly manipulative and apparently has no probably drugging the Police Commissioner.\n\nSpeaking of being manipulative and drugging people (and no I don’t mean Lisa)…Jerry returned today. And the Ford brothers think having Eddie for a daddy is bad…ask Jax what it’s like having a raging psychopath who has more lives then Mitch Laurence for a brother.\n\nIs Jerry working for the Balkan or manipulating the Balkan? Or perhaps he just likes stealing the bodies of children of an international super criminal. With Jerry who knows. Jerry obviously isn’t the Balkan because a) that’s too easy and b) the son of the Balkan was named Aleksander which doesn’t start with a J as Jacks family tradition would dictate. Not to mention that Aleksander is too old to be Jerry’s son. No way am I buying that Jerry has a kid almost as old as Jax. Whatever Jerry is up to I’m sure it’s really, really bad. Hopefully while he is in Port Charles he can give Lisa lessons on how to be a good psycho because she is horrible at it.\n\nAs much as this pains me to say it Rex and Jason won the “Made of Awesome” award for today. Rex for saving Nora and Jason for telling Dante to stop being stupid before he ruins everything. I’m sure they will go back to being jackasses soon but for today they did good things.\n\nSorry For My Brother (or Father) Helping That Psycho\n\nSo November Sweeps has turned into November Sleeps on OLTL. I mean really, could today’s episode been anymore boring?\n\nTodd and DanYella took Tea home from the hospital but before they could leave they ran into a handcuffed Greg. Tea wanted to know why Greg did this to her and he really had no answer. I felt really bad for Tea and DanYella for Greg betraying them like this but I don’t feel sorry for Todd at all. I think he looks like a douche even when he has the right to be angry. He’s just not a sympathetic character to me. It’s kinda hard to feel sorry for someone in this situation when they once handed a woman a can of dirt and told her it was her dead baby when he in fact had given her baby away just because it wasn’t his (or so he thought anyway). The irony in all of this is that Blair raises Sam as her own son and she cares a lot about DanYella. And Todd’s posturing and trying to be a bad ass was laughable and eye roll-inducing. RealTodd would have been plotting to take Greg down by kidnapping him and torturing him or something instead of behaving like a whiny, pathetic man with lame threats. No way RealTodd would have let Greg leave the hospital walking on his own two feet. I don’t know who this imposter calling himself Todd Manning is but he’s definitely nothing like Original Todd. Original Todd was a lot of things but sappy and schmoopy were never on the list.\n\nWhile I snickered at Todd threatening to rip Greg’s head off I totally believed it when Shaun said it. Dude walked back downstairs last year when the Russians kidnapped Starr and Hope while he had a couple of bullets inside of him. Ripping Greg’s head off for Shaun would be like me ripping a few sheets of paper in half. Loved Shaun and Tea. He gave her a big old bear hug too:\n\nShaun apologized to Tea for what Greg did and later Destiny apologized to DanYella for Greg’s actions as well. Poor Destiny is having a hard time with this whole my brother is my father who helped a serial killer terrorize my friend’s family. Being a soap teen just isn’t easy.\n\nOther things that happened:\n\nWhy is James still wearing the same clothes that he was buried alive in?\n\nStarr’s whining reached “makes dogs howl” levels today.\n\nBrody spent the first half of the show shirtless. Not that I’m complaining.\n\nAMC/Pine Valley reference!\n\nNora gets major points for telling Mrs. Evans that she IS Destiny’s mother because she raised her.\n\nSo Greg killed Destiny’s bio mother and disposed of her body? Well that’s just a little psycho."
