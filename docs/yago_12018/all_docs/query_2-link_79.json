        "text": "Her first soap opera stint was as Kit on the now-canceled show The Doctors.\n\nIn 1983, she took over for Margaret Colin in the role of Margo Montgomery Hughes on As the World Turns, a character she would play on the serial for several years. During Smith's run as Margo, the character went from being a troublemaker to a leading heroine. After giving birth to her first child (as well as a bitter feud with a co-star over an adulterous relationship), Smith left \"ATWT\" in 1989.\n\nSmith returned to daytime in 1992 in her Daytime Emmy Award-winning role as District Attorney Nora Hanen Gannon Buchanan Colson on the ABC soap opera, One Life to Live. Nora became a centerpiece of the show, particularly after her involvement as a lawyer in a rape trial. Her character has had several husbands and lovers, several children (including an interracial child) and is daytime's only Jewish character.\n\nWhile portraying Nora, Smith briefly played the wife of Gene Wilder on the primetime sitcom Something Wilder. The show was quickly cancelled, and Smith returned to playing Nora full-time.\n\nHilary B. Smith has also appeared in Love Potion #9 alongside Sandra Bullock and Tate Donovan and the 2002 film, Maid in Manhattan. She guest starred on an episode of Law & Order: SVU for the 2004-2005 season."
