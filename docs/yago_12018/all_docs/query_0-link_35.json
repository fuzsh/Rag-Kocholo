        "text": "By\n\nGH Executive producer, Frank Valentini promised an exciting announcement today and he delivered one less than an hour ago.\n\nValentini, through a video on his Twitter account shared the news that Daytime Emmy winner, Hillary B. Smith is coming to General Hospital as Nora Buchanan! Smith played Nora on One Life to Live for many years, from 1992-2012 and again in 2013 on Prospect Park’s online reboot of the series.\n\nFrom the looks of the video teaser, Nora Hanen Gannon Buchanan will be counsel to someone in need of expert legal advice! Could she end up actually prosecuting or defending Franco (Roger Howarth)? If so, this would not be the first time that Smith and Howarth have worked together in an on-screen legal courtroom battle. For Smith, won her Emmy for Nora trying to bring Todd to justice for the gang rape of Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell) on One Life.\n\nWith the hiring of Smith, this is the first time since the rights to One Life to Live are back with ABC that GH has been able to utilize a character from the beloved soap opera since the protracted legal battle with Prospect Park. There is no word yet as to how long Smith will be staying in Port Charles, if its for a guest-star arc, recurring, or on contract is yet to be revealed.\n\nWatch the video annoucement featuring Rebecca Budig (Hayden) of Smith coming to GH as Nora Buchanan here.

Harrington) becomes more unhinged as his hatred for Sonny (Maurice Benard) has taken over any sense of reason. First, he tried to get Kristina (Kate Mansi) put behind bars for threatening to kill and harm Ava Jerome (Maura West) during the confrontation that saw Kristina go crashing through a window.\n\nKnowing Cates is using Kristina as a pawn to get to him, Sonny goes into the courtroom as cool as a cucumber, while Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) goes before the judge to argue how Cates’ case against her daughter has no merit. The judge gives Cates 48 hours to come up with proof and build a case of the allegations he levied against Kristina, or he is in deep trouble with the law and the FBI.\n\nMeanwhile, Ava (Maura West) and Nina (Cynthia Watros) talk at the gallery where Ava admits what happened when Kristina came to pay her visit the night she fell through the window and lost her unborn baby. When Nina asks what really went down that day, Ava explains that Kristina came to see her after she was issued a subpoena. Ava confirms that Kristina barged into the room and was yelling at her.
