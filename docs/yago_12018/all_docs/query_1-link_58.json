(15s)\n\nAbraham B Holley [Y4a12], son of Mary T Young and John William Holley, was born 10 March 1842 in District 10 in Giles Co TN. He lived within this community his whole life, and probably married his wife there also, in 1863. She was Sarah Phoebe A Brown, born 11 February 1845 in TN. Her parents are probably Jesse Franklin Brown (1807 NC) and Phebe Parks (1810 NC) who lived with their six children in Lincoln Co in 1850. One child was 5 year old Phebe Brown. Of Abraham and Phoebe’s grandchildren, two had Brown as a middle name. Furthermore, in the area of eastern Giles Co and western Lincoln Co, there were only three young girls who had any combination of names which could have been Abraham B Holley’s future wife. Phebe Brown is the likely one. Her parents and siblings lived in Franklin Co in 1860, but there was no 15 year old daughter with the parents. The two siblings next older and younger than Phebe (America and James) were at home. Phebe could have been with her older siblings (Susan, Wade, and Malher) who were no longer living with their parents.\n\nAbe was a farmer. He died 30 September 1910, and Phoebe on 14 February 1921. Both are buried in Center Point Cemetery in District 10.

She appears to be the same wife Abe had since the 1870 census. These nine children were-\n\na. John William Holley, b 1865\n\nb. James T Holley, b Jan 1867\n\nc. Mollie E Holley, b Jul 1869\n\nd.
