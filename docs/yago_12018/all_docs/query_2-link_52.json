        "text": "Ruth Gordon, an actress and writer whose perpetual energies seemed to defy time, died yesterday at her summer home in Edgartown, Mass. She was 88 years old.\n\nIn those years - the last 70 of them in and around the worlds of stage, screen, television and letters - Miss Gordon manifested a fearsome will and an insatiable appetite for things new. She was a seaman's daughter, and she never tired of exploration or conquest.\n\n''Pan me, don't give me the part, publish everybody's book but this one and I will still make it!'' Miss Gordon wrote in ''My Side,'' her autobiography. ''Why? Because I believe I will. If you believe, then you hang on. If you believe, it means you've got imagination, you don't need stuff thrown out for you in a blueprint, you don't face facts - what can stop you? If I don't make it today, I'll come in tomorrow.''\n\nGarson Kanin, Miss Gordon's husband of 43 years, said that even her last day of life was typically full, with walks, talks, errands and a morning of work on a new play. She made her last public appearance only two weeks ago - at a benefit showing of the film ''Harold and Maude'' - and she had recently finished acting in four films. In one of them, characteristically enough, Miss Gordon insisted on doing her own motorcycle stunts."
