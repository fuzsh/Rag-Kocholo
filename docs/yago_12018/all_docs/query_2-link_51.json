        "text": "GH has never gotten how to write black families. Long ago, they were on to something with Edward and his long lost black love interest. I forgot her name. She was a veteran actor and brought it! She also was supported by her grandson Justice. The family kind of dwindled away after bringing some fire! The original Jordan and her men were very good initially and they were all good actors . Now, we are left with a poodle head and black Barbie doll who Cannot act her way out of a paper bag . Aunt Stella has no purpose and TJ has never had the opportunity to test but one Love interest while Molly was able to get her freak on. I don’t know any young man of any shade who would not at least had one other fling especially if his girl stepped out on him?! Don’t get me started on Marshall and how they are wasting he and Epiphany’s talents because….they don’t know what to do with black people by writing them as complicated characters like their white counterparts which might save this soap from slipping off into the abyss it’s destined for because of poor writing for overloaded storylines that are tangential but not circumventing\n\nAs far as Stella she needs to speak up and let Curtis and Portia know that it was her fault about the papers. She’s a good actress but she’s doing two shows now maybe that’s why her part is so limited. I don’t know where they’re going with Epiphany and Marshall but if they’re going to have a musical connection I wish they would just do it. I’d rather hear her sing and him play his saxophone than this monotonous dance of Brook Lynn practically forcing Chase to sing. I remember Justice back in the day, I liked him and found it unnecessary for him to be killed off. I like TJ and I think Molly is all wrong for him, nothing to do with race, but I stated in another post he’s a family man, he wanted to be legally married to her she didn’t want to be which says a lot about her, I don’t think she ever wants children whereas I think TJ would make a good father I think Molly is all about career, TJ could be both a great doctor and a great husband and Dad. Jordan needs to move on, forget about Portia’s big secret and let her deal with it herself, and if anyone needs a love interest it’s her, maybe she should crack a smile once in a while it would help. Her character is being wasted so much more could be done with her. I don’t like the storyline of Curtis being under Selina Wu’s thumb either, I could go on and on but it would be too long.\n\nI’m starting to come around to NuJordan. She’s getting a little better and I think she will continue to grow…fingers crossed.\n\nAs for Portia, she acts like a giddy teenager. What grown woman squeals as much as she does. It’s childish and unnecessary. I never really was a fan of the character and it seems to be getting worse now that she’s keeping this huge secret from Trina. I couldn’t care less about Curtis being in the dark because of his attitude.\n\nI would love for the writers to give Jordan a new love interest. I would take a fun fling. Get her out of Curtis’ orbit.\n\nI think they are setting Curtis up for a big fall. He’s been arrogant, rude, and judgmental. I doubt he would given up on his marriage to Jordan as quickly as he did if he hadn’t had Portia waiting in the wings. I’d like to see Portia with Drew eventually. At least for a while. I don’t see the chemistry with Curtis.\n\nGive Taggart a bigger role on the show.\n\nI certainly don’t want to do a wholesale condemnation of the current cast of black actors or any actors for that matter. I think that we should be mindful of the fact that there are many variables that go into the mix. You have the way scripts are written, stage direction, producers’ concepts and… the fact that the taping of shows is a very fast, one take process on soaps today. In years past, there was more time for young actors to get acclimated to the process.\n\nIMO, Trina is doing an excellent job stepping into a big role. And as several posters have noted, Jordan is warming up to the character.\n\nSometimes in life, slow and steady wins the race. In several cases, I see the winning trend around the bend."
