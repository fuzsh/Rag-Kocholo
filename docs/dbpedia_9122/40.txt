A deep dive on Chinese yuan renminbi

The renminbi, abbreviated as CNY or RMB, serves as the official currency of mainland China, with the yuan being its primary unit. Internationally, the Chinese currency is commonly referred to as the 'yuan.'

The term 'renminbi' translates to 'people's currency' and was initially introduced in 1948 alongside the establishment of the People's Bank of China. While it can be readily exchanged in Hong Kong and Macau, it does not serve as the official currency in these regions.
