        "text": "A senior researcher has encouraged China to expand the use of its interbank transfer protocol, warning of risks inherent in the use of Western systems like Swift.\n\nOnshore yuan rallied to a high of 7.1150 per US dollar during morning trading, the strongest level since January 2.\n\nThe sudden strength in funding currencies, particularly yen and yuan, dented carry trades, after weak US labour data last week stoked recession fears and fuelled bets on deeper rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nEddie Yue Wai-man’s reappointment for a second five-year term as head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is good news. Yue has amply proved himself over the past five difficult years. The next five years will be just as challenging, if not more so.\n\nWhile Donald Trump returning as president poses political risks, the US dollar is more insulated against his policies than many might think.\n\nProvince’s move follows Shenzhen’s announcement of a US$964.4 million sale of offshore yuan-denominated bonds as China pushes to internationalise its currency and boost Hong Kong’s hub role.\n\nWith geopolitics making overseas use of the yuan more common, a professor has said the time is now for Hong Kong to have a greater role in the currency’s offshore settlement.\n\nOverseas use of Chinese renminbi is ‘robust’ compared to other key currencies thanks to pivotal role in supply chains, study finds.\n\nHong Kong’s government raised US$3.2 billion via green bonds denominated in US dollars, euros and offshore yuan in the city’s latest push to establish itself as a sustainable finance hub.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements has praised China and other developing economies in managing their monetary policy, but cautioned pressure will remain high as US Fed rates remain unchanged.\n\nHong Kong’s monetary authority plans to sign an agreement with the Chinese central bank to find ways to enhance cross-border remittance services to make it easier for Hongkongers who work or retire on the mainland.\n\nWith yuan capital outflows at their highest in years, transfers from Hong Kong to mainland China appear to have done much to keep the currency from depreciating at much higher rates.\n\nHKEX will seek to boost international use of the yuan and enhance Hong Kong’s connector role between China and the world, Carlson Tong says."
