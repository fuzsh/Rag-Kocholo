The net inflow of cross-border RMB settlements stood at 404.47 billion yuan last year.\n\nAccording to data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Chinese currency accounted for 2.88 percent of global foreign exchange reserves in the first quarter of this year, up 1.8 percentage points from 2016 when it entered the IMF's Special Drawing Rights basket, ranking fifth worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, the amount of cross-border RMB settlements related to the real economy maintained rapid growth."
