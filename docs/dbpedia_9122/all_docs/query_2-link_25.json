        "text": "China’s Monetary Nationalism\n\nMoney and political rule in China’s history\n\nChina’s past and present provide eloquent testimony to the political significance of money and currency. In the country’s long history, there are numerous examples of how “bad money” has led to political instability, the delegitimisation of political rule, territorial disintegration, civil war and chaos. It is historically proven that the early paper currencies under the Song (1127–1279), Yuan (1271–1368), Ming (1378–1635) and Qing (1636–1912) dynasties experienced deep losses in value as a result of ex­cessive monetary expansion, which subsequently undermined the legitimacy of imperial rule and contributed to its demise. The Taiping Rebellion (1851–64), which is estimated to have cost the lives of 20 to 50 million people, was also triggered by a currency crisis.\n\nIn the period 1839–1949, which China’s official historiography refers to as the “century of humiliation”, the state’s monopoly on currency was chal­lenged several times and from different sides: initially by the branches of European banks in the coastal trading ports, then later also by local Chinese banks and provincial governments, and finally by invaders from Japan. In China’s republican era, the Kuomintang government and Japanese colonial authorities fought bitterly for national currency dominance in the years 1938–41. After Japan put the currency of the Republic of China under massive pressure by selling on foreign exchange markets, the currency war escalated in 1941 when both sides carried out attacks, acts of sabotage and even military assaults on the opposing central banks and banks.\n\nFor China’s communist rulers, money and currency have always been an essential foundation of their rule.\n\nIt is firmly anchored in the current political culture of remembrance that China’s revolutionary changes of power in the 20th century were preceded by runaway inflation. Massive currency devaluations were followed by food riots and unrest, which were key factors in the fall of the empire (1912) and the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War (1927–49). The student protests in Tiananmen Square (1989) also had a monetary component against the backdrop of high inflation (around 25 per cent). Also unforgotten are the former restrictions on China’s national sovereignty, for example as a result of the parallel existence of several currencies on the country’s territory, the uncontrolled activities of foreign banks, or the indebtedness of the state and private sector to foreign countries.\n\nThe collective memory of all these events continues to characterise the mindset and actions of the Chinese state and party leadership to this day. For China’s communist rulers, money and currency have always been an essential foundation of their political rule, comparable in importance only to the insignia of the people, army, territory, party and state. On the occasion of the founding of the central bank and the introduction of the new currency, the renminbi, Mao Tse-tung proclaimed on 1 December 1948, just one year before the proclamation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC): “The Chinese people finally have their own army, their own regime, their own land and now their own bank and currency! This is how a republic mastered by the people should be like.” The symbolic names given to the central bank (People’s Bank of China, PBoC) and the currency (People’s Money, RMB) as well as the enforcement of an RMB with stable value as legal tender in the turmoil of the civil war contributed significantly to legitimising the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the founding phase of the PRC.\n\nThe defensive and offensive sides of Chinese monetary nationalism\n\nDue to this historical background, money and cur­rency are integral parts of China’s sovereignty, iden­tity and nationalism. China’s monetary nationalism has an economic and a political facet: Economically, its currency is an instrument to safeguard monetary stability and promote economic development, growth and competitiveness, if necessary, also at the expense of third countries. Politically, the RMB is an internal symbol of national identity and an external mani­festation and instrument of China’s claim to inter­nation­al leadership.\n\nIt is obvious that the monetary system is subordinate to the CCP’s interest in maintaining the system and its power in order to preserve political stability. Money and currency are core elements of politics and political power. Only after recognising this premise can their economic dimension be assessed. The political system, which describes itself as “Socialism with Chinese characteristics”, makes use of efficient market economy regulations and provides very broad scope for entrepreneurial freedom and autonomy. However, the CCP’s claim to leadership in all key political issues remains absolute.\n\nIn this type of political setting, the central bank responsible for monetary policy (the PBoC) cannot be independent. As in other centres of power, the man­agement staff of the PBoC are committed to the com­munist party and ideology. Leninist organisational principles also apply to the PBoC. From a constitutional point of view, the PBoC is a subordinate author­ity of the State Council, which is responsible for political supervision and the budget. All important monetary policy decisions ultimately require the approval of the State Council. The fact that the PBoC nevertheless enjoys a certain degree of authority and independence is primarily due to its success in ful­filling its mandate, namely to safeguard the monetary value of the RMB and promote economic growth.\n\nChina’s monetary nationalism has both domestic and foreign policy aspects. On the one hand, it has a defensive inward focus for the purpose of protecting financial sovereignty; on the other hand, it has an offensive outward focus in an effort to gain inter­national financial leverage and influence. In the 20th century, during the ruling eras under Mao Tse­tung, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, the focus was primarily on defensive aspects. China’s state and party leadership was concerned with controlling the RMB and enforcing it as the only legal tender on the territory of the PRC, securing the currency’s internal monetary value and thus the Chinese people’s trust in it. The leadership could thus avoid financial and currency crises that could have jeopardised this trust as well as internal stability while also averting any financial dependencies, be it through foreign debt or through the dominance of Western banks and finan­cial institutions in China itself.\n\nFrom a Chinese perspective, a sense of vulnerability persists regarding monetary and financial policy, right up to the present day.\n\nAlthough monetary and financial policy has succeeded in mastering all these tasks, a sense of vulner­ability persists from a Chinese perspective, right up to the present day. The international monetary system remains US dollar-centred and Western-dominated and could potentially be used as a political weapon against the People’s Republic. Financial sanctions, such as those imposed on Russia in response to the war of aggression against Ukraine, would also hit China’s economy hard. In addition, the Chinese econ­omy and economic policy are at the mercy of the sometimes surprising twists and turns of US monetary policy, at least as long as stable exchange rates are sought for the RMB and certain restrictions on capital movements are maintained in a controlled manner for capital transactions with foreign countries. In the not unthinkable event of a financial and economic crisis, China’s political stability or even the CCP’s claim to power could be jeopardised by rampant capital flight.\n\nFrom a Chinese perspective, the offensive financial and currency policy goals that have become increasingly apparent since the turn of the millennium have therefore always had a defensive connotation. For example, the build-up of currency reserves (totalling USD 4 trillion at peak times) was obviously based on the idea of having to be prepared for speculative attacks on its own currency and a likely subsequent financial crisis. The actively pursued goal of inter­nationalising the RMB was therefore also a reaction to the turbulence on the global markets in the financial crisis of 2008/09. China’s demand for a level of rep­resentation at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank that is in line with the country’s economic weight is also understandable and legiti­mate. Other financial policy measures already display a clearly offensive character, such as the establishment of new competing multilateral financial insti­tutions, for example the Asian Infrastructure Invest­ment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank (NDB). State or quasi-state direct investments and foreign loans made as part of the Belt and Road Ini­tiative (BRI) already testify to China’s strong economic and political dominance in regional and international contexts. The dependencies and asymmetrical power relations that have emerged as a result have become proven instruments of economic coercion in China’s foreign policy, when deemed necessary.\n\nIn the current era of government under Xi Jinping (since 2014), China’s monetary and financial policy has been characterised by an offensive approach. The People’s Republic is actively seeking to exert influ­ence, co-determination and participation in inter­national financial and monetary matters in line with its own political ideas and interests. Due to its grow­ing political ambition, it is inconceivable that China could be passively integrated into the existing gov­ernance structures of the global monetary system in the same way as the former financial policy “rising powers” Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia, especially as the United States – supported by other G7 coun­tries – is actively blocking China from having a greater “vote and quote” in the IMF and World Bank. The state and party elites in the People’s Republic regard it as illusory that America would ever offer China a genuine partnership in the existing governance system or even respect Beijing’s core political interests. It is therefore the long-term objective of the Chinese leadership to gradually change the inter­national financial and monetary system in such a way that its own room for manoeuvre is expanded and that of America and the West is reduced. In the long term, the People’s Republic must endeavour to re­shape the global monetary and financial system in such a way that it is sufficiently compatible with the structures of the Chinese one-party state. China’s monetary policy and international financial policy therefore align with the country’s overriding political interests.\n\nThe Renminbi’s Long March to International Currency Status\n\nAs early as the opening and liberalisation of the Chinese economy under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and 1990s, the question arose as to what role the RMB would be able to play internationally in the future. The idea of RMB internationalisation was first offi­cially mentioned in 2006 in a document from the Chinese central bank in the form of a positive re­commendation. According to the document, greater use of the RMB outside its own borders would pro­mote China’s status, political influence and economic competitiveness. The desired internationalisation of the RMB was given political backing and momentum as a result of the shocks resulting from the global financial market crisis that began in 2008. This event clearly demonstrated to the Chinese government the risks of dependence on the US dollar and a dollar-dominated financial system.\n\nChina’s motives\n\nFrom a Chinese perspective, the internationalisation of the RMB is necessary to counteract the economic and political disadvantages facing the PRC in the current international monetary system. The worries and concerns of the Chinese leadership are primarily in three areas.\n\nFirstly, China’s companies are exposed to currency-related costs and risks – particularly substantial cur­rency risks – in their foreign trade and investments, even though the country is now the world’s second-largest economy (based on market prices) and largest trading nation. China’s domestic financial institutions and financial markets will not be able to develop in the same way as the country’s real economy for the foreseeable future. In contrast, RMB internationalisation could allow China’s citizens, companies, banks and corporations to use their own currency inter­nationally as a means of payment and investment, to raise RMB-denominated capital or to issue RMB-denominated bonds abroad.\n\nSecondly, China is at a disadvantage due to the ob­ligation to hold foreign exchange reserves denominated in US dollars to hedge against currency and financial market crises. Beijing views these investments as inefficient, loss-making and politically humiliating. As a large economy with global eco­nomic exposure, China holds the highest level of dollar currency reserves in the world and considers itself to be in a dollar trap due to the associated asset risks, which are difficult to calculate. In the worst-case scenario, the People’s Republic would have to accept the United States offloading its monetary ob­ligations to foreign countries through an expansive monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nRMB internationalisation would be a way for China to free itself from the dollar trap.\n\nThese three sets of concerns and the resulting commitment to change distinguish China’s project of currency internationalisation from the rather half-hearted efforts with which the former West Germany and Japan in the 1980s and 1990s – and the euro­zone since the beginning of the 21st century – sup­ported and continue to support the internationalisation of the mark, yen and euro.\n\nBenefits, costs and risks of the renminbi internationalisation\n\nAs politically desirable as the international upgrading of China’s own currency may be from a Chinese per­spective, it cannot simply be decreed politically. Nor does such a process only bring advantages. Currency internationalisation in general, and RMB internationalisation in particular, are associated with costs and risks.\n\nUsually a currency can be considered international if it can be used to fulfil the primary monetary func­tions (medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value), not only domestically but also abroad, that is, beyond the borders of the issuing central bank’s juris­diction. A distinction must be made between (private) use by households, companies, banks and corporations, and the use by central banks (see Table 1).\n\nUsing a different currency instead of the domestic and customary legal tender is a matter of trust. There­fore, currency internationalisation can only ever be a demand-driven, market-based process. Internationalisation also requires government support. In order to be accepted, the international currency should be convertible into other currencies without restrictions and should be available globally to a sufficient extent. The issuing country should therefore have open, deep and well-developed financial markets so that inves­tors can invest there at any time. Conversely, investors must also be able to rely on being able to withdraw their capital at any time. Only countries that sustainably and credibly secure internal and ex­ternal monetary stability have the prerequisites to provide a global or reserve currency.\n\nThis provision of an international currency goes hand in hand with considerable advantages for the issuing country, as a look at the United States clearly illustrates. From the perspective of the economic and political heavyweight China, the potential (five) ad­vantages must outweigh the (four) disadvantages à la longue.\n\nBenefits\n\n1. Lower transaction costs in foreign trade: The use of the RMB on the international goods and financial mark­ets would have multiple advantages for Chinese companies and corporations. Exporters could invoice in RMB; importers could acquire goods and services abroad in RMB; financial institutions could conduct their business activities abroad in RMB; industrial, commercial and financial enterprises could invest abroad in RMB and raise capital abroad in RMB. Risks concerning exchange rates would be eliminated for all of them. The Chinese state and state-owned enter­prises would benefit as well. They could raise capital abroad in the form of RMB bonds, and they could grant loans in RMB, for example for infrastructure projects. A digital RMB that is interoperable in inter­national financial transactions could drastically re­duce cross-border transfer costs.\n\n2. Seigniorage gains: Seigniorage in the narrower sense refers to the central bank’s profit from money crea­tion, which results from the difference between the nominal value of the (interest-free) means of payment and their lower production costs. Additional seignior­age profits arise when the domestic currency is held as a financial asset abroad. A real transfer of wealth (in favour of the domestic economy) takes place (at least temporarily) with the transfer of the country’s own currency into foreign hands. Above all, however, the issuer’s economy gains a considerable advantage in terms of interest. This is because as soon as foreign­ers hold sufficient liquidity in the foreign cur­rency, it is possible for domestic borrowers, bond issuers and also state bodies to finance themselves at more favourable (interest) rates. China is also seeking this privilege. If there is a corresponding international demand for RMB, foreign countries would make capital available to China. However, a successful spread of the RMB abroad would not only give China’s economy and state a strong competitive advantage on the financing side; indirectly, it would also give a boost to the financial centres of Hong Kong and Shanghai. As the domestic financial and capital markets develop and deepen, China’s banks and financial institutions could improve their financial strength, become more competitive internationally and expand into new markets.\n\n3. Macroeconomic stability and fiscal resilience: An inter­national currency acts as an anchor in the global financial system. For the issuing country, this reduces the systemic risk of currency and financial crises. Issuing countries have the advantage of being able to raise bonds abroad and also offset balance of payment deficits in their own currency. This greatly expands their fiscal leeway and the monetary policy options of their central bank. In the 1960s, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, France’s finance minister at the time, described this advantage with regard to the United States as an “exorbitant privilege”. In fact, the annual absolute returns of American investments abroad are considerably higher than those of foreign investments in America on a sustained and permanent basis. One of the main reasons for these differ­ences in yields and returns is that the world beyond the United States is more or less forced to hold liquidity and currency reserves in US dollars, not least to protect itself against volatility risks and currency shocks.\n\n4. Gain in foreign policy power: An internationally rec­ognised currency gives the issuing country political standing, prestige, soft power and very direct influ­ence over the states that have pegged their exchange rate and hold reserves in the foreign currency. In view of its universally useful international monetary functions, the reserve currency becomes a quasi-public good in whose existence and preservation third countries (must) also have an interest. States that provide an international currency are the key players in the global macro-management and governance of international financial and monetary policy. In a bilateral context, an international currency can serve as a strategic tool for wielding political influence, offering both opportunities for positive promotions and the means for implementing negative sanctions.\n\nOn the positive side, a country’s own currency can be used for loans and donations, for example for development aid, emergency measures to deal with natural disasters, military aid, as well as stabilisation and support measures in the event of financial and currency shocks. In the latter cases, it is up to the issuing country to decide whether and, if so, to what extent it supports the country concerned via swap lines or through direct interventions on the foreign exchange market.\n\nAs a negative measure, a global, extraterritorial ban can be imposed on the use of one’s own cur­rency in international payment transactions with enemy states, such as those that the United States and the EU have imposed on North Korea, Iran and Russia. The foreign currency reserves of the enemy state can also be frozen, insofar as access to them is possible. It is precisely these measures by America (and its allies) that make China aware of its financial vulnerability. The internationalisation or digi­talisation of the RMB would therefore be an effective way of protecting itself to some extent against potential financial and currency attacks by the United States. In addition, RMB internationalisation could enable the PRC to build up its own power to impose financial sanctions in the medium to long term and apply it if necessary.\n\n5. Promotion of liberal financial and capital market reforms domestically: The complete internationalisation of the RMB would inevitably entail the liberalisation of interest rates, exchange rates and the unrestricted movement of capital abroad. It would therefore require reforms in China in order to address these matters. However, various politically influential interest groups in China – such as the four major state-owned banks, state-owned enterprises, and the export, construction and property industries – object to such reform measures. This anti-reform lobby can­not, however, fundamentally oppose the internationalisation of the RMB – a goal that is being pursued by the state and party leadership, has been identified as a geopolitical priority and is also popular with the public. In this respect, the dissemination and enforce­ment of its own currency on a global level is a politi­cally expedient instrument for forcing through domestically controversial liberalisation measures within the PRC. China pursued a similar reform strat­egy when it joined the World Trade Organization.\n\nCosts and risks\n\nThe advantages described above for the issuing coun­try are accompanied by considerable costs and risks. The transition to a reserve currency country harbours substantial stability risks.\n\n1. Appreciation pressure: A high or rising global demand for a country’s currency can result in its unintended appreciation, which constitutes the flip side of sei­gnior­age gains. Although it is true that appreciation of a currency benefits domestic consumers and the import economy by increasing purchasing power, it simultaneously erodes price competitiveness for export companies, putting pressure on the national economy to adapt. Such a reduction in competitiveness is problematic from a Chinese perspective, con­sidering the high priority that Beijing has traditionally given to exports and the associated positive income and employment effects.\n\nChina is maintaining capital controls for systemic and political reasons.\n\n2. Stability risks in the free movement of capital: Currency internationalisation generally limits the ability to conduct monetary policy autonomously. Once a country engages in international trade and finance transactions, it inevitably faces the conflicts between exchange rate stability, the free movement of capital, and retaining autonomy in monetary policy: Only two of these three goals can be realised in this tri­lemma. In the long term, it would make sense for China to combine monetary autonomy with convertibility and flexible exchange rates, that is, to adopt the position chosen by the leading Western central banks – the Federal Reserve (Fed), the ECB, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Bank of England (BOE). As already discussed, China maintains capital controls for systemic and political reasons and protects ex­change rates via currency reserves. Obviously, the state and party leadership fears that convertibility would mean losing control over volatile exchange rates, being exposed to unwanted capital flight, and an inability to guarantee domestic financial, econom­ic and political stability. Stability takes precedence over RMB internationalisation in the CCP’s policy calculations. As a consequence of the conflicting ob­jectives described above, the PBoC’s monetary policy is not entirely autonomous in matters of liquidity management. Monetary and fiscal policy adjustments to the international economic environment are al­ways necessary, especially in response to the Fed’s guidelines and decisions.\n\n3. Transformation risks: Renminbi internationalisation exacerbates the loss of control that China is already facing as a result of the policy of financial repression and limited capital mobility. The PBoC cannot control the RMB markets outside the borders of the PRC, and capital and payment transactions with foreign coun­tries only to a limited extent. Payment transactions for cross-border movement of goods and services are not subject to restrictions, and there are even gaps in the existing foreign exchange controls on capital movements. Against this backdrop, differences in short-term interest rates between RMB domestic mark­ets and RMB offshore markets constantly lead to arbitrage and speculative movements, the costs of which are ultimately borne by the PBoC. And the more that offshore RMB circulate abroad, the higher the currency reserves that need to be held. Another problem is that foreign RMB liquidity has contributed significantly to the formation of bubbles on the Chinese asset markets (equities, real estate). Particularly in periods of appreciation pressure on the RMB, foreign liquidity flowed uncontrollably into China.\n\n4. Global responsibility of the monetary hegemon: A country with an international currency not only enjoys an exorbitant privilege. It must also bear exorbitant burdens. It is true that the mandate of monetary policy only applies to the domestic currency, the domestic market or the domestic economy. But the hegemon cannot afford to lose the trust of foreign investors and the global financial markets. From a foreign perspective, both secure, unhindered access to the liquidity of the international currency and its stability in value are essential. In this respect, the advantages provided by having the status of a reserve currency country also give rise to a special responsibility for maintaining stability of the international currency and financial markets. In financial crises, for example, America is repeatedly called upon to act as a lender of last resort, providing the major global central banks with unlimited liquidity via swap lines in order to avoid liquidity bottlenecks on the markets. In turn, combating inflation at home also follows the imperative of maintaining inter­national confidence in the stable value of the cur­rency. In addition, the reserve currency country is required to continuously allow current account deficits (and practically therefore also budget deficits) so that its own currency can be sufficiently available as a source of global liquidity. The continuous current account deficits inevitably result in growing foreign debt. Fiscal over-indebtedness constitutes a long-term threat. At present, it is still uncertain what exorbi­tant burdens China will have to shoulder. The People’s Republic has already demonstrated its political wil­lingness to assume responsibility, at least within a regional framework.\n\nThe international use of the renminbi: Barriers, approaches, measures\n\nIt is not foreseeable whether, when and how the PRC will achieve complete convertibility as is required for RMB internationalisation. Although China has made progress in developing its domestic financial sector and liberalising interest and exchange rates, capital movements abroad remain strictly regulated. It is not only interest groups such as exporters and the state-owned economy that are vehemently opposed to the liberalisation of capital movements. Systemic bar­riers also stand in the way of the transition to con­vertibility: If one considers that, in Xi Jinping’s era of government (since 2012), China’s economy and markets have been brought firmly under the control and into the service of the party and state, it is hard to imagine that this same party and state could be prepared to expose its own economic policy to the assessments and sentiments of the international financial markets. In view of the political fear of losing control, the convertibility of the RMB is illu­sory for the time being. Without this convertibility, however, foreign investors would shy away from investing in China’s financial and capital markets, especially as the legal and regulatory framework con­ditions are also problematic. In a system of “Socialism with Chinese characteristics”, there is no reliable guarantee of the rule of law and property rights. Company data and financial information are neither transparent nor reliable. Sometimes they are manipu­lated for political reasons.\n\n“Crossing the river by\n\nfeeling for the stones.”\n\nIrrespective of the lack of political and institutional prerequisites, the PRC is fundamentally committed to the long-term goal of RMB internationalisation and is making persistent efforts to implement it effectively. If market forces are not sufficient to realise this plan, the supporting hand of the state is needed to stimu­late international demand for the RMB. The controlled, cautious, incremental, gradualist and politi­cally coordinated approaches that can be observed here are very similar to the those used in the reforms for macroeconomic transformation and foreign trade liberalisation. The Chinese proverb “Crossing the river by feeling for the stones” describes the approach symbolically. The metaphor makes it clear that the path to the goal is not predetermined, but rather resembles a long process based on the principle of trial and error. It may be necessary to pause or turn back if you are in danger of losing your footing.\n\nThe approach of the People’s Republic to RMB internationalisation does not necessarily correspond with those used for the currency internationalisation of th­e dollar, mark, yen and euro. In view of the country’s unique political and economic circumstances, China is seeking its own path. For the period following the turning point marked by the global financial market crisis in 2008/09, a multi-pronged approach is recognisable: On the one hand, the aim is to develop efficient domestic financial and capital markets and gradually open them up to foreign in­vestors. On the other hand, the RMB is to be increasingly used abroad. To this end, the use of China’s own currency in cross-border trade and services is being promoted over a long time horizon, and efforts are being made to establish RMB offshore foreign markets. Politically, the use of the RMB in foreign trade is being actively promoted in China’s neighbourhood and in the Global South. Technological developments such as the digitalisation of payment transactions also offer the opportunity to make the RMB more widely used around the world. The inter­nationalisation of the RMB is therefore like a “long march”, the course and end point of which cannot be determined. What is visible is a gradual process that is being actively driven forward by China’s government and financial institutions at various levels.\n\nRMB in foreign trade\n\nIn July 2009, the PRC launched a pilot project for an initial five Chinese cities and their foreign trade with Hong Kong, Macao and the countries of South-East Asia in order to process exports and imports via the vehicle RMB and enable invoicing in RMB. After a successful start, the project was gradually expanded to cover the whole of China, and the restriction to the immediate regional neighbourhood was lifted. Thirty-one clearing banks worldwide were designated for payment processing in RMB by the end of 2022. The early currency swap agreements with the Bank of Korea (December 2008) and the Hong Kong monetary authorities (January 2009) were followed by numerous other agreements with 40 central banks to date. The PBoC concluded a swap agreement with the ECB in October 2013 and a clearing agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank in March 2014. Apart from Frankfurt, RMB clearing in Europe is also possible in London, Paris, Luxembourg, Zurich, Budapest, Mos­cow and Belgrade. China is adapting a similar strat­egy for the promotion of the international use of the digital RMB (e-CNY) and is initially focusing on local pilot projects and bilateral agreements with foreign jurisdictions.\n\nDevelopment of an independent infra­structure for international payment transactions\n\nIn October 2015, the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), developed by the PBoC, went into opera­tion. China now has its own platform for clearing and settling international foreign trade transactions in real time. Thanks to CIPS’ own messaging capacities, the PRC now has a functional national alternative to the established SWIFT system. CIPS is based in Shanghai, uses the established SWIFT standards, is organised as a cooperative like SWIFT and also has Western banks as shareholders. There are currently 1,443 banks participating in CIPS, either directly with their own clearing account or indirectly as participating users. So far, however, CIPS has been used almost exclusively for cross-border payments in RMB. At the equivalent of around 14 trillion euros in 2022, the transfer volume corresponded to slightly less than 1 per cent of the SWIFT volume. China has also created an alternative platform in the credit card business: “China Union Pay”, founded in 2002 by the PBoC and leading Chinese banks, can be used world­wide for payment transactions. For their part, the Chinese digital companies Alibaba and Tencent have developed payment services that are also expanding their international presence. In order to create inter­operability in cross-border payment transactions for its newly developed digital central bank money, China is focusing on innovation, standardisation processes and international cooperation.\n\nPrice formation on commodity markets\n\nAs the world’s largest and most important consumer and importer of commodities, China is actively seek­ing to expand RMB invoicing and RMB quotations and reduce its dependence on dollar-based agricultural and commodity trading. The commodity exchanges in Dalian, Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as the Shanghai Oil and Gas Exchange established in 2021, provide RMB trading platforms and publish RMB-denominated commodity indices. Where appropriate, contracts in RMB are concluded with supplier coun­tries such as Russia, Brazil, Argentina and the Gulf States.\n\nDevelopment of RMB offshore markets\n\nIn view of the continuing restrictions on capital movements in and out of China, the adoption of the RMB as a means of payment or financing vehicle abroad is limited. Therefore, RMB offshore markets had to be created outside the jurisdiction of the PRC, where RMB proceeds can be freely exchanged into other currencies, and investment, lending and financing transactions can be carried out in RMB. The globally established financial centre of Hong Kong – with its advanced infrastructure, free movement of capital, generally liberal regulations and close eco­nomic ties to the PRC – has been predestined as a location for the establishment of such offshore mark­ets. A functioning RMB offshore market requires a freely convertible RMB. Parallel to the non-convertible onshore RMB (CNY), a convertible offshore RMB (CNH) was thus created. The system can be summarised with the formula “one currency – two markets”. For foreigners, the offshore RMB and RMB offshore market create the possibility of using the Chinese currency not only for trade transactions with the PRC, but also for international financial transactions and as an investment vehicle and store of value.\n\nThe issuance of bonds denominated in RMB in Hong Kong, so-called dim sum bonds, proved to be highly attractive at times. Issuers benefited from the lower interest rate (compared to the “panda bonds” issued in the People’s Republic), and investors could expect RMB appreciation gains for some time. In general, bank accounts denominated in RMB were high-yielding investments during the period of RMB appreciation.\n\nThe newly emerging RMB offshore market was largely fuelled by China’s foreign trade surpluses. These were recycled via the PBoC’s currency swap lines and foreign loans from Chinese banks and cor­porations. As early as March 2012, China provided the BRICS countries with credit facilities in RMB. Loans from Chinese state and development banks to partner countries as part of the BRI launched in 2014 are increasingly being granted in RMB. The multilateral development banks NDB and AIIB, which were founded at China’s initiative, can also grant loans denominated in RMB, although they are still pre­dominantly provided in US dollars.\n\nRelaxation of restrictions on capital movements\n\nAs already discussed, the desired internationalisation of the RMB is hampered by China’s continued restric­tions on capital movements. These are responsible for the fact that the PRC is far less integrated into the global economy in financial terms than it is in terms of foreign trade and direct investment. Although the capital controls protect the People’s Republic from the uncertainties of volatile financial markets in the short term, they do not force it to make the necessary structural adjustments to meet global economic re­quire­ments. In economic terms, the country is thus accepting a loss of efficiency. China’s savers and investors are missing out on potentially profitable investment opportunities abroad.\n\nTo counteract these negative effects, the PRC is liberalising capital movements in a controlled manner. The liberalisation steps are linked to specific pro­grammes. Windows or quotas are being opened for capital flows into China and between RMB onshore and RMB offshore markets: Special programmes allow selected institutional investors to invest in China’s capital markets. Others allow Chinese financiers and companies to invest in RMB offshore markets abroad. Foreign companies can also raise capital in RMB offshore markets and then invest it in the People’s Republic. “Connect” programmes give investors in China, Hong Kong and third countries the opportunity to invest in the others’ stock or bond market with­in the framework of fixed quotas (“Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect”, “Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect”, “Shanghai-London Stock Connect”, “Bond Connect”). Companies can borrow abroad for invest­ments in designated free trade zones (Shanghai, Guang­dong, Tianjin, Fujian). Despite all these pro­grammes and measures, the RMB is still a long way from convertibility; however, there has been financial integration into international markets.\n\nFlexibilisation of the exchange rate regime\n\nFrom a theoretical and historical perspective, flexible exchange rates are not a necessary prerequisite for a currency to be widely used internationally. However, in the current currency and exchange rate system of the post - Bretton Woods era, flexible exchange rates are a necessity and are also in the interests of the participating countries in terms of efficient capital and goods markets. In fact, China has made progress in the transition from fixed to flexible exchange rates, reducing the prior undervaluation of the RMB against the dollar and the euro. The external value of the RMB is now determined by a managed floating within the framework of a periodically adjusted parity (“crawling peg”). The PBoC allows daily exchange rate movements of a maximum of 2 per cent around the fixed parity of the RMB against a designated basket of currencies. A market-determined external value of the RMB that is in line with the economic fundamentals is then formed in the medium to long term via floating central rates. Although flexibility of the ex­change rate regime has been achieved in this way, the RMB foreign exchange markets are comparatively less liquid and developed. And ultimately, China’s exchange rate policy remains dollar-centred. The basket of currencies designated by the PBoC is domi­nated by the dollar and currencies from the dollar zone. To hedge against currency shocks, the PBoC primarily holds dollar reserves. An autonomous RMB currency area remains illusory for the time being.\n\nEstablishment of the RMB as a reserve currency\n\nIt is primarily economic criteria that qualify a curren­cy as a reserve currency: an appropriate significance in world trade and on world financial markets, free movement of capital, flexible exchange rates, a stable and sustainable national economy, and developed financial markets. China has improved in terms of these criteria over the past few years, but still only partially fulfils them. It is due to China’s political and economic clout that central banks and the IMF give the RMB a certain bonus. Starting in 2011, the first central banks included the RMB in their basket of reserve currencies. In November 2015, the Executive Board of the IMF decided to include the RMB in the IMF currency basket at an initial share of 10.9 per cent. The ECB has also held RMB in its official cur­rency reserves since June 2017, albeit with the rather symbolic equivalent value of EUR 500 million.\n\nRMB internationalisation – a mixed interim assessment\n\nThe currency internationalisation measures imposed by the Chinese authorities after 2008/09 have not failed to have an effect. As a result, the RMB became increasingly important internationally as a means of payment and store of value. However, this trend came to a sustained halt in the summer of 2015 due to turbulence on the Chinese stock market and the sub­sequent depreciation of the RMB. The RMB no longer appreciated, and it was no longer worth it for market participants to hold RMB liquidity speculative­ly. However, following the relative stagnation in the second half of the 2010s, the internationalisation of the Chinese currency now appears to be gaining momentum again, as can be seen from the Standard Chartered Renminbi Globalisation Index (RGI), which has documented the process since 2012. The RMB has been able to record gains on shares, particularly in international payment transactions and on the foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe RMB still does not play a significant role in the global financial and currency markets.\n\nPercentage shares of USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, RMB in the global financial and currency markets\n\nHowever, the data in Table 2 only provide an in­complete picture of the international role of the Chinese currency. In fact, the RMB has visibly gained status and profile in China’s foreign trade and capital transactions as well as in the regional context over the past 15 years. However, this positive development is not – or only partially – recognised in the avail­able statistics from SWIFT, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the IMF. The use of Chinese and Asian sources provides sufficient empirical evidence of the regional and international importance of the RMB:\n\nRMB as a means of payment: 18.2 per cent of Chinese trade and services were settled in RMB in 2022. The natural centre of these transactions with foreign countries is in Hong Kong, with a share of 50.3 per cent, followed by other Asian financial centres such as Singapore (10.3 per cent), Macao (4.0 per cent), Tokyo (2.4 per cent) and Taipei (2.2 per cent). Ac­cording to Chinese media reports, RMB exceeded US dollars in China’s total payment transactions for the first time in March 2023. The RMB is accepted in cross-border payments more than elsewhere by Asian countries and in parts of Africa and Latin America. More recently, Russia, Brazil and Argentina (still under the Kirchner administration) have begun to increasingly use the RMB as a means of payment in foreign trade transactions. In response to Western sanctions, Russia has switched its international pay­ment transactions to RMB as far as possible. India, on the other hand, still insists on dollars or rupees. It is also reported that RMB cash has become the unofficial parallel secondary currency in some of China’s neighbouring countries, such as Laos, Myanmar and North Korea (“yuanisation”).\n\nRMB as a store of value: Bonds and debt securities denominated in offshore RMB are predominantly issued in Hong Kong and held in Hong Kong bank accounts. The issuance of international bonds de­nominated in RMB, the “dim sum bonds”, began steadily increasing again starting in 2018 following a massive slump between 2014 and 2017. However, the RMB has hardly benefited from the global trend of relatively decreasing dollar reserve holdings. Central banks are choosing to shift into gold and convertible currencies. It is likely to be mainly central banks in Asia, Africa and Latin America that are storing RMB as a reserve currency.\n\nRMB as a monetary policy anchor: Although no country in the world has officially pegged its currency to the RMB to date, China’s trading partners are increas­ingly basing their exchange rate policies on the cur­rent exchange rates of the RMB to the US dollar. The stability of intra-regional exchange rates is an im­por­tant factor for economic stability and growth, espe­cial­ly for the countries of East and South-East Asia, which are linked by sophisticated trade and production networks. Traditionally, the common link to the external dollar anchor secures stable intra-regional exchange rates. With the rise of China as Asia’s centre of economic gravity, the exchange rate movements of the RMB against the US dollar have therefore in­creasingly assumed a guiding and anchoring function for the ASEAN states, Taiwan and South Korea. In the meantime, even the exchange rates of the BRICS currencies (and those of some other countries in the Global South) correspond more closely with the RMB exchange rates than those of the Asian currencies traditionally orientated towards the US dollar. Ob­viously, an RMB currency zone emerged in the 2010s that is already significantly larger than the euro cur­rency zone.\n\nGeopolitical potential for a multipolar global monetary system\n\nThe continued underdog position of the RMB in the global financial and currency markets contrasts with China’s strong position in the real global economy as the largest trading nation and second-largest eco­nomic power. It is unlikely that this imbalance will change and that China’s national currency could gain significant international weight for payment and credit transactions or as an investment vehicle. The continued adherence to restrictions on capital move­ments and market access restrictions to the domestic capital market, the persistence of current account surpluses and the increasing economic problems of the People’s Republic argue against the RMB gaining status. In view of domestic debt, declining economic growth and geopolitical conflicts with America, it is unlikely that China will relax its capital controls in principle or allow high deficits in foreign trade. Main­taining macroeconomic and domestic political stabili­ty remains a priority for China’s state and party leader­ship.\n\nNevertheless, the RMB certainly has the potential to develop into a major international currency in the long term. A stronger role for the RMB as a globally used payment, credit and investment vehicle in the future is supported not only by China’s significant position in global foreign trade and as an economic power, but also by the widespread global unease concerning the dominant position of the dollar, America’s exorbitant currency privilege and the associated systemic risks.\n\nIn particular, the developing and emerging countries of the Global South are vulnerable in the dollar-centred global monetary system. In a world of volatile financial markets, they are repeatedly forced to take on the burden of adjusting to a US monetary and fiscal policy that is primarily orientated towards American economic and political interests. Unlike the G7 countries and America’s allies, the emerging economies do not have access to the Fed’s swap lines for short-term liquidity bridging in the event of finan­cial crises, such as the insolvency of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. As a group, they are underrepresented in the IMF and World Bank and can only exert lim­ited influence there. In addition to the general levels of dissatisfaction, there are fundamental doubts as to whether the unipolar global monetary system, which is centred on the dollar, can be sustained in view of America’s growing national and foreign debts, coupled with the fear that the United States could be tempted to get rid of its debt through inflation and devaluation at the expense of foreign creditors hold­ing dollars. The use of the dollar (and the euro, yen and pound) for financial sanctions against Russia and the seizure of the Russian central bank’s currency reserves have further fuelled unease about dollar hegemony and the Western-dominated global mone­tary system. With growing mistrust concerning America and the dollar, the RMB is becoming more attractive.\n\nFor China, there is an opportunity to promote the RMB as an alternative “emerging market currency”.\n\nIn view of the current financial, monetary and foreign policy risks, it is necessary for the emerging markets to diversify their own currency dependencies and to take precautions against the uncertainties of the current financial and monetary system. Against the backdrop of this widespread criticism of the dollar, China has the opportunity to promote the RMB as an alternative “emerging market currency”, as a kind of counterweight to the dollar. Beijing is supported in its ambitions to create a multipolar currency system and to break the dominance of the dollar by the BRICS group, which has spoken out accordingly several times in its final declarations. The call for “de‑dollarisation” has a monetary and a geopolitical component:\n\nIn terms of currency policy, the RMB could be used to discipline America if it abuses its exorbitant privilege as the issuer of the world’s reserve currency in an exploitative manner in terms of monetary and fiscal policy. The alternatives of the RMB (and the euro) would serve as both a reinsurance and a safety net against a potentially globally destabilising American macro policy. The growing internal and external debts of the United States and its fragile domestic political situation make it imperative to take precautionary measures against a conceivable collapse of the existing global monetary system.\n\nGeopolitically, currency policy is an area of conflict in the Sino-American rivalry. Financial sanctions are an effective instrument of American foreign policy. They could cause considerable damage to China or other countries. China, which is vulnerable on this front, is arming itself by internationalising its own means of payment and establishing a currency zone centred around the RMB. It would also be advantageous for third countries to be able to switch to an alternative infrastructure for cross-border payments and an alternative currency in the event of a potential conflict with America. If the dollar and euro are problematic for a state regime for geopolitical reasons or for fear of sanctions, China could provide the RMB as an effective alternative via swap lines and help out with its CIPS transfer infrastructure. Digital central bank money could also be an interesting option.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Global South, currency policy and geopolitical considerations may argue in favour of a multipolarisation of the international monetary system (and thus a stronger role for the RMB). Still, the RMB remains commercially unattractive compared to the dollar (and the euro), at least as long as it is not fully convertible and RMB liquidity is not sufficiently available globally. On the other hand, countries always have administrative options to in­fluence foreign trade payments. It can therefore not be ruled out that the forces of geopolitics will prove to be more powerful than the factors concerning economic cost and efficiency. Just as supply chains and trade flows are already geared towards geopolitical constraints in the present, geopolitically fragmented credit and capital markets could also emerge in the future. It is even conceivable that the global monetary system will collapse and a bipolar currency regime will emerge in which China forms its own currency zone with other revisionist states.\n\nOne open, speculative question is how China would behave as a currency hegemon. Would the People’s Republic work cooperatively and constructively with America and the eurozone? Would it be prepared to take on economic adjustment burdens and, for ex­ample, open swap lines in RMB in crisis situations or grant support loans to financially troubled countries? On the one hand, China’s constructive role in past financial crises gives reason for cautious optimism. On the other hand, Beijing’s restrictive attitude towards countries that are unable to repay their BRI loans suggests that China will primarily focus on its own interests. It seems unlikely that it would adopt solutions conceived in the United States.\n\nIn any event, China is single-mindedly and persistently pursuing its goal of national rise in the area of financial and monetary policy as well. Digital pay­ment systems could make it easier and cheaper to bypass the dollar and euro in the future. They could thus give the internationalisation of the RMB a new boost. China began laying the foundations for state digital money at an early stage. It will try to use its “first mover” advantage in the digitalisation of cur­rency and payment systems commercially and geo­politically on an international scale.\n\nChina’s New Digital Currency\n\nMonetary sovereignty under pressure to innovate\n\nChina is a technology-savvy country. New technologies are spreading rapidly in the economy and society. The party and the state regard innovation as an effec­tive driver of the country’s national advancement. Digitalisation is actively promoted. The innovations and business activities of fintech companies have long been seen as a welcome opportunity to reform an antiquated financial and banking system. At the end of 2022, 75.6 per cent of all Chinese (1.067 bil­lion) had internet access and 1.065 billion used a smartphone. In its urban centres, China is already almost a cashless society. According to a survey by the PBoC, 59 per cent of all payment transactions were made by mobile phone in 2019, only 23 per cent by credit card and 16 per cent in cash.\n\nTowards the end of the 2010s, China’s regulatory authorities and political leadership increasingly realised that the innovations of the fintech industry were – irrespective of the commendable techno­logical and economic progress associated with them – undermining and threatening the monetary sovereignty of the state, that is, the sovereign power over money and currency. The emergence of private crypto­currencies and the dominance of digital pay­ment platforms have been and continue to be viewed particularly critically. The party and state’s claim to power has resulted in an absolute imperative to re­spond to the systemic challenges of the private digital economy in regulatory and political terms. The intro­duction and establishment of a central bank digital currency should prove to be an appropriate and effective strategy in the medium term in order to avoid financial risks and strengthen the state’s over­sight and surveillance capacities on the markets.\n\nPrivate cryptocurrencies: China established itself early on as a global centre for the production and trading of bitcoins. Bitcoin is historically the first private cryptocurrency to circulate in virtual networks and accounts on a decentralised basis and independent of state control using blockchain technology. However, China’s financial and monetary authorities had no interest in the establishment of a competing private currency and the resulting erosion of the state’s mone­tary monopoly. They were therefore quick to take action against bitcoins and other private crypto­currencies. As early as August 2017, the issuance and trading of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoins, was banned, and internet access to foreign crypto exchanges was blocked. Starting in May 2021, finan­cial transactions involving cryptocurrencies were completely illegal. The production of bitcoins (“min­ing”) in China was also no longer possible. Even more than the payment token Bitcoin, the Chinese author­ities perceived the plans presented by Facebook in 2019 to establish the stablecoin Libra, later Diem, as a global means of payment via its own network as a threat to their monetary sovereignty. They feared that the global use of Libra/Diem in Facebook’s social net­works would further strengthen the global dominance of the dollar, and that China would also have to accept the introduction of the new artificial cur­rency (and thus the Facebook platform).\n\nThanks to the innovations of Alibaba and Tencent, China is currently the most advanced market for digital financial services in the world.\n\nDigital payment platforms: In mobile payments, China experienced in the 2010s a unique and spectacular technological and market development, which was largely driven by the digital platforms Alipay and WeChat Pay. The two companies are not actual finan­cial service providers, but companies from outside the industry that have their origins in online retail (Alibaba) and social media (WeChat/Tencent). The two platforms have successfully expanded their business portfolios beyond mobile payment processing to include traditional banking services and offers for favourable consumer loans, insurance or lucrative investment opportunities in money market mutual funds. Their services are now used by 1.3 billion (Ali­pay) and 0.9 billion users (WeChat Pay). The innovations and investments of Alibaba and Tencent have made China the world’s most important and ad­vanced market for digital financial services. On the other hand, the disruptive changes in China’s finan­cial markets have also brought to light numerous problems and excesses: blatant cases of credit and investment fraud, growing consumer debt, inhumane working conditions, misuse of user data, insufficient data security against criminal access by third parties, unfair contract clauses, excessive fees and gagging contracts.\n\nThe resulting disruption in general and the commanding market positions of Alibaba and Tencent, which dominate mobile payments with a market share more than 90 per cent (2020), in particular, have prompted China’s authorities and politicians to crack down on the fintech industry with increasing severity and in many cases to utilise the police. From the perspective of the party and the state, the two companies’ digital financial services projects are not only a regulatory challenge, but also a political one. From a regulatory perspective, it is about avoiding systemic risks that jeopardise the stability of the financial market. The state and party leaders are con­cerned about the lack of transparency, the in­adequate supervision of the widely ramified shadow banking system, and the strong market positions of Alibaba and Tencent, all of which encourage abuse. The reali­sation that Alipay and WeChat Pay are ultimately digital network companies that conduct risky banking transactions without the necessary equity capitalisation could not continue without consequences. The insolvency of just one would destabilise the financial markets, not only because of the conceivable collapse of payment transactions, but also because of the re­sulting existential strains on the financial institutions indirectly exposed.\n\nPolitically, the level of control exercised by Alibaba and Tencent over user data, payment flows, infrastructure and technologies beyond state control was a provocation. Due to their financial power, both com­panies had also gained considerable political influ­ence. Against this backdrop, the criticism openly voiced by Jack Ma, the charismatic founder and CEO of Alibaba, in October 2020 – in which he fundamen­tally questioned the regulatory and monetary sovereignty of the state – was viewed as hubris. The IPO of Alibaba’s fintech spin-off Ant Group was can­celled at short notice at the personal behest of Xi Jin­ping. The entire fintech sector had to submit to politi­cal supervision and strict regulation as part of a large-scale campaign. All fintech companies had to register as financial market holding companies under com­mercial law and were therefore subject to the appli­cable banking regulations. New or stricter regu­lations were issued in the areas of consumer protec­tion, data protection and data security, labour pro­tection and competition. Alibaba and Tencent were required to disclose the credit ratings of their users and make them available to the state and competitors.\n\nDigital central bank money – pioneer China\n\nThe central bank wants to ensure that the supply of money is also guaran­teed in the future in the event of a decline in the use of cash.\n\nAccording to the white paper published by the PBoC in July 2021, China is pursuing three objectives with the introduction of the digital yuan, the e-CNY. Firstly, cash should also be made available to the public in digital form. The central bank wants to ensure that the supply of money is guaranteed by the state in the future in the event of a decline in (physi­cal) cash usage. The e-CNY is also intended to guar­an­tee access to money and cash for people who do not have their own bank account, that is, to improve financial inclusion. Secondly, the e‑CNY is intended to ensure secure, efficient payments under the con­ditions of fair competition between providers. As a form of state money, the e‑CNY is legal tender. It offers protection against data misuse by platforms and criminals, enables the interoperability of systems, and is a fallback option should one of the private systems collapse. Thirdly, possibilities for the use of the e-CNY in cross-border payments are to be explored.\n\nChina’s digital currency project started in 2014. In 2016, the PBoC officially announced its intention to introduce digital central bank money for electronic payments (digital currency electronic payment, DCEP) and set up an internal research institute, the Digital Currency Research Institute, for this purpose. Face­book’s Libra initiative (2019) gave the CBDC project political urgency, so that the first pilot tests were launched in April 2020, initially in the cities of Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu and Xiong’an.\n\nSince then, the use of the e-CNY has been successively tested and introduced in an increasing number of regions and to ever more recipients. It is not yet clear when the e-CNY will be available throughout the country. China’s pioneering work in the intro­duction of a CBDC attests to the country’s leadership in digital technologies and payment transactions. However, it also implies considerable risks for the PBoC, the party and the state, as design flaws could lead to enormous economic damage and result in a loss of political legitimacy.\n\nThe white paper published by the PBoC provides detailed information on the architecture of the e‑CNY. According to this information, the e-CNY is digital central bank money and legal tender. It digitally supplements and replaces physical cash in circulation with identical value (1:1). It is widely available to the general public (“retail-based”) and is intended to be interoperable with all private payment systems. The PBoC does not charge a usage fee for the e-CNY, but it does not pay interest either. The e‑CNY is issued and administered centrally by the PBoC and put into circulation via commercial banks or other intermediaries – and it is backed 100 per cent by the central bank. Users therefore do not access the e‑CNY directly through the PBoC, but via intermediaries at banks or through digital and telecommunications companies. To be able to pay with e‑CNY, users must register an electronic wallet (“wallet”) by providing their identity, bank details or at least one telephone number and then fill it with an authorised amount. The wallet can be accessed via smartphone apps, electronic watches, wristbands, chip cards and machines. The e-CNY can be used as a value-based payment token, for example for peer-to-peer trans­actions, as well as account-based via commercial and online banks. Offline transactions, between two mobile phones, for example, are also possible. Trans­actions are cleared centrally via the PBoC by means of registration, authentication and verification. Con­trolled anonymity applies: Users’ data is protected against access by merchants, banks and platforms, but it can be viewed and monitored by the PBoC in real time, for example to combat money laundering or crime. The e-CNY issued by the PBoC is not block­chain-based, but the future issuance and use of digital central bank money is fundamentally open to new technologies, so that further innovations, such as programmability for smart contracts, are conceivable.\n\nChina’s pioneering work in introducing a CBDC is testament to the country’s leadership in digital technologies and payments.\n\nThe design is very promising. However, it remains to be seen to what extent people and companies will actually accept the e-CNY in China. Thanks to inten­sive promotion, 261 million Chinese had an e-CNY wallet in 2022. However, the amount of e-CNY in circulation at the end of 2022 corresponded to just 0.1 per cent of cash in circulation in China. Given the existing and convenient payment portals of Alipay and WeChat Pay, the additional use of the digital yuan makes little sense from a user perspective for the time being. It is even conceivable that the Ali­baba-Tencent duopoly will be further strengthened by the introduction of the new e-CNY money. A broader use of the e-CNY is only to be expected in connection with additional benefits that are not yet available, such as for offline transactions, payments as part of smart contracts and international transfers. On the other hand, the state could set new incentives for the application of the e-CNY or, conversely, en­force the use and acceptance of the e-CNY through laws, de­crees or other forms of state pressure.\n\nEven if China’s public and private sectors remain cautious about the new digital means of payment, the goals set by the PBoC in its white paper are likely to be achievable. However, the white paper does not seem to reflect fully the ambitions of the central bank, the state and the party. The economic and political implications of the state’s new digital money go far beyond the technocratic level of monetary policy. With the e-CNY, China’s state authorities have a new instrument that is likely to be used in various fields, both inside and outside the country. Domestically, the e‑CNY creates new options for monetary policy and gives the state unimagined possibilities for control, surveillance and repression. At an inter­national level, blockchain technology could revolutionise cross-border payments. Chinese technology and Chinese companies could acquire dominant positions in the areas of global payments and services. An early and successful introduction of the e‑CNY internationally could sustainably bolster both the global status of the RMB and the resilience of the Chinese economy vis-à-vis Western sanctions.\n\nNew options for monetary policy\n\nWith the ban on cryptocurrencies, the introduction of a CBDC and the enforcement of platform interoperability (domestically), the Chinese government has resolutely confronted the challenges of the fintech industry. The RMB remains unchallenged as the most broadly accepted means of payment and the authoritative monetary unit of account in China. Fears that prices and wages would be expressed in foreign or digital currencies – meaning that monetary policy measures would no longer have any influence on domestic prices and economic activity at home – have receded into the background. Nevertheless, China’s monetary policy will change as a result of the digitali­sation of money and, in particular, the introduction of the e‑CNY.\n\nFuture changes will depend crucially on the extent to which and in what way the e‑CNY will supplement or even replace existing physical cash and central bank money in general. China’s policymakers, in particular the PBoC, will influence the rate at which the e‑CNY is used to shape further developments as far as possible in their favour. Despite this still un­predictable environment, the extent and direction of the coming change can be recognised in outline. There are new options for monetary policy (1) due to the displacement of physical cash, (2) due to the real-time recording and programmability of a CBDC, (3) due to the possibility of direct payments by the cen­tral bank to private households and companies and (4) due to new technological possibilities for controlling capital movements. If successfully implemented, China’s monetary policy could lead the way inter­nationally.\n\n(1) The use of cash has been declining in China for a long time. The production, storage, anti-counter­feiting, distribution and redemption of banknotes and coins generate considerable costs that the PBoC would rather not have. China’s party leadership would also favour the abolition of physical money, which it sees as an instrument for money laundering, criminal activity and corruption. However, cash remains in­dispensable as a means of payment in many rural regions of China for the time being. As the intro­duction of the e‑CNY is about improving financial inclusion, the associated abolition of physical money would be counterproductive. Therefore, the PBoC’s assurances that it will neither discontinue the supply of cash nor replace it with administrative decrees as long as there is a demand for a physical means of payment are (still) credible. However, if a cash ban were to be issued in the distant future – meaning that people and companies in China would no longer be able to use cash – the PBoC would have a new monetary policy option. In the event of severe reces­sions or deflation, it could levy a negative interest rate and thus incentivise private-sector spending.\n\nWith the issuance of e-CNY, it will be possible to record payment trans­actions, liquidity movements and lending in real time.\n\n(2) China’s monetary policy will become more targeted and effective in the future. With the issuance of e-CNY, it will be possible to record payment trans­actions, liquidity movements and lending in real time. Monetary authorities will thus be able to obtain a precise picture of current events on the financial markets at an early stage and deploy their instruments immediately, without delay and in accordance with the circumstances. As the CBDC is traceable and pro­grammable, the PBoC will also be able to make much more targeted use of its monetary policy management instruments. Appropriate programming should make it possible to limit and control the setting of interest rates, minimum reserves and money supply quotas in terms of time, use, region and price, and to track their implementation.\n\n(3) It is also conceivable that the PBoC could pay out “helicopter money” to private households, for example in the form of consumer vouchers, or that it could grant investment subsidies to cooperatives and companies in order to directly and immediately stim­ulate overall economic demand. This distribution channel would have the additional advantage of mak­ing any misappropriation of funds by corrupt inter­mediaries virtually impossible. The PBoC would thus take over fiscal policy tasks, as it were. It would also be the executive organ of fiscal policy.\n\n(4) Cross-border payment transactions with e‑CNY would create new opportunities for the PBoC to con­trol and manage capital movements and foreign ex­change reserves. Through appropriate blockchain programming, the PBoC could put itself in a position to condition or exclude certain uses of the e‑CNY, such as a sale on the foreign exchange market. The RMB could thus be better protected from speculative attacks.\n\nTool of control, surveillance and repression\n\nEvery transaction carried out with the new digital cur­rency e‑CNY is saved and stored in the PBoC’s central databases as part of the registration, authentication and verification process. The design of the e‑CNY thus allows for the respective wallet holder to be identified. These digital footprints are undoubtedly an expedient instrument for the Chinese state and party in the Xi Jinping era, not only to combat crime but also to secure power. The PBoC offers assurances that the e‑CNY guarantees better data security and data protection vis-à-vis private third parties compared to private payment systems, and that small amounts are not traced. However, there is no data protection vis-à-vis the PBoC and the security authorities. The PBoC has repeatedly made it clear in official announcements that the principle of controlled anonymity does not mean protection from criminal prosecution. In general, surveillance and law enforcement were always important political objectives associated with the introduction of the e‑CNY. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection – the powerful CCP organisational unit for combating corruption and ideological deviation – was involved in the digital currency project at an early stage.\n\nThe Chinese security authorities are permitted to access data anywhere, at any time and without restriction at their discretion.\n\nIt is possible for the PBoC to view and trace CBDC transactions in real time. As a consequence, the state security agencies will be able to use the available transaction data for surveillance, prosecutions and repression, regardless of the official assurance of anonymity. The Chinese security authorities are per­mitted to access data anywhere, at any time and without restriction at their discretion. Criminal law is interpreted broadly, and accusations of money laundering or terrorist financing are repeatedly levelled against regime critics or unpopular individuals. Party cadres who have fallen out of favour are deliberately accused of tax evasion. In addition to the ubiquitous surveillance cameras equipped with intelligent facial recognition software, digital social security cards and the “Smart Cities” project, the e‑CNY provides the party and the state with another effective digital tool for surveiling civil society and the party.\n\nIn the future, the PBoC will also be able to link the payment data registered in its e-CNY data centre with information from the Credit Reference Centre, which is also under its administration. By virtue of this responsibility and the control it offers over financial credit, the PBoC has always been an important player in China’s social credit system. Going beyond tradi­tional credit report bureaus, the social credit system comprehensively evaluates the people and firms of the People’s Republic via a point system in order to provide incentives for socially desirable behaviour. The future role of the PBoC in China’s social credit system could go beyond the collection and processing of personal and firm-related creditworthiness data and also include executive functions. For example, in order to sanction defaulting debtors, it could block access to e‑CNY accounts for the “delinquents” con­cerned, refuse or even cancel certain payments. Or it could ensure that one is notified if the partner to a transaction is on a blacklist of “conspicuous” persons.\n\nCross-border payment transactions using e‑CNY could enable the PBoC to record transactions made abroad in e‑CNY. China’s authorities would be able to monitor, control and possibly even regulate the activities of Chinese companies abroad. Capital flight would be made more difficult. Foreigners would also have to fear that the Chinese apparatus could use the data it has obtained about them against them. It is even conceivable that the PBoC could issue a pro­gramme order to prevent e‑CNY transfers from indi­viduals or firms abroad. The Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, which has been in force in China since June 2020, expressly provides for extraterritorial action when exercising state measures against operators and sponsors of foreign sanctions. Such fears are the reason and motive for the creation of a bill in the US Congress. The “Chinese CBDC Prohibition Act”, intro­duced in August 2023 by Republican Senator Rick Scott, would prohibit American financial services companies from carrying out transactions with e‑CNY. China’s authorities would be denied access to the payment data of American citizens.\n\nCross-border interoperability in international payment transactions\n\nCross-border payment transfers are notoriously time-consuming, cumbersome and costly. In order to establish a secure connection between different legal, regulatory and currency environments, commercial banks, correspondent banks and at least one clearing centre must be involved. The World Bank put the global costs of international payment transactions for the first quarter of 2023 at 6.25 per cent of the trans­fer amounts, and for bank transfers as much as 12.10 per cent. In developing and emerging coun­tries, which often only have poorly developed bank­ing systems, the costs, time and risks of international payment transactions are particularly high.\n\nOn a positive note: CBDCs and distributed ledger technology offer promising potential for cost savings and productivity gains that would benefit the Global South in particular. Digital payment platforms could be used to process cross-border transfers via blockchains, peer-to-peer, as well as in real time while by­passing the existing banking and clearing system at very low cost, and perhaps even free of charge in the future. The more consumers and companies become accustomed to efficient payment processes, the more politicians and central banks will come under pres­sure to enable cross-border digital transactions and the cost reductions that can be realised as a result.\n\nThe technological expertise and practical experience gained during the rollout of the e-CNY offer China the opportunity to play a leading role in the future development of the infrastructure of a digital international payment system and to increase its autonomy in this area. In a quantum leap, so to speak, the RMB could gain international distribution and influence. The disruptive nature of this revolution in digital payments is fuelling ambitions in China that the country could go from being an out­sider in the global financial system to an insider, or even a world leader. The technology and infrastructure of inter­national payments could be China-centred in the future.\n\nThe e-CNY is a retail CBDC that was developed for China’s domestic payments. However, the design could easily be extended to wholesale processes and international transactions. The major hurdle for the acceptance of e‑CNY in cross-border money transfers is the lack of interoperability with payment systems abroad. The strategic goal of the PBoC and Chinese financial policy must therefore be to establish this interoperability with as many foreign payment sys­tems as possible and to enforce its own standards for multilateral solutions. The design of the infrastructure of international payment transactions is current­ly still completely open. From a Chinese perspective, initiatives for the development and promotion of an international payment system that is interoperable with the e-CNY must necessarily be broad and diverse. The motto seems to be “Let a thousand flowers bloom”. China’s e-CNY internationalisation projects include unilateral and multilateral initiatives, bi­lateral measures, disruptive innovations and the further development of existing payment systems.\n\nUnilateral and multilateral initiatives\n\nThe Universal Digital Payment Network (UDPN) is a block­chain-based, decentralised network that provides standardised interoperable procedures for inter­national transfers of CBDCs and stablecoins. The UDPN is the most important project of the BSN plat­form (“Blockchain-based Service Network”) to date. This network, developed in China, is a public infra­structure for the development, provision and main­tenance of blockchain-distributed applications. The UDPN project and the BSN platform form a unique ecosystem that will be practicable and presumably also very cost-effective for the concrete implementation of cross-border payment transactions in the future. It could be an attractive option for private and state-run payment systems abroad to simply “dock on” to this platform. In the search for a suitable digital payment vehicle, the e-CNY would be the logical choice. The UDPN project could expedite the internationalisation of the RMB.\n\nThe Finance Gateway Information Service is a joint venture established in 2021 between SWIFT – the Brussels-based operator of the global communications net­work for financial transactions – and various sub­sidiaries of the PBoC, including the settlement centre and the Digital Currency Research Institute. According to the official announcement, the joint venture will improve the integration of SWIFT into China’s financial system and develop messaging standards for Chinese financial institutions. This will also involve enabling international payments with e‑CNY via SWIFT.\n\nmBridge is a project of China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates with the support of Hong Kong’s BIS Innovation Hub Centre. With mBridge, the participating central banks have a tailored blockchain – the “mBridge Ledger” – and based on this a common multi-currency-capable “mbridge platform”, via which they can issue and exchange their respective CBDCs. The jointly devel­oped prototype enables transfers and currency ex­changes of wholesale CBDCs in real time around the clock. It forms a “bridge” that connects the four national payment systems and exchanges currencies. In an initial practical test in 2022, in which 20 com­mercial banks took part alongside the four central banks, the mBridge platform issued CBDCs worth around USD 12 million and processed more than 160 payment and foreign exchange transactions totalling more than USD 22 million. The mBridge project has shown that the interoperability of digital payment transactions between central banks is feasible. How­ever, there is still a long way to go before it can be effectively implemented in practice. The parties in­volved will have to agree on the common governance of the platform and make difficult legal adjustments at the national level.\n\nChina’s digital payment infrastructure could be particularly attractive for countries in the Global South.\n\nBilateral measures\n\nIt can be assumed that China will actively promote and encourage interoperability with the e-CNY with foreign governments, financial authorities and pay­ment processors, similar to what has been done in the past for physical infrastructure projects under the BRI. China’s digital payment infrastructure could be particularly attractive for those countries in the Global South that have close economic ties to China, whose banking and financial systems are underdeveloped, or that are politically and economically depen­dent on Beijing. The People’s Republic is well-posi­tioned with its offerings for efficient cross-border payment transactions, meaning that its initiatives are likely to be well-received abroad.\n\nBlockchain-based transactions between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are likely in the medium term, especially as the technical foundations have already been laid with the mBridge project. In view of the existing broad financial integration that exists between China and Hong Kong, considerable efficiency gains and cost savings can be expected.\n\nMany BRI partner countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America have modernised their telecommunications infrastructure with Chinese components. Chinese smartphones are also widely held in these regions. It therefore makes sense to equip the cross-border payment infrastructure with Chinese software and adapt it to Chinese standards. China’s CBDC, the e-CNY, can become a model and blueprint for the introduction of CBDCs in third countries. Beijing would offer technical support for the introduction of CBDCs and then insist on inter­operability with the e‑CNY in terms of implementation. Utilising the UDPN network could be the only viable option for blockchain-based cross-border payments for some time to come.\n\nCountries that fear being subjected to American or Western financial sanctions see the e-CNY as a practical alternative to the current international payment-transfer traffic based on SWIFT standards. Sanctioned countries such as Russia, Iran and North Korea are urging China to implement it soon.\n\nPilot zones have been set up in provinces exposed to foreign trade to test cross-border payment trans­actions with e-CNY. In the “Guanxi Pilot Free Trade Zone”, for example, a blockchain-based trade and finance platform for foreign trade with Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia is to be set up. The “Silk Road Connect” platform in Wuhan will be used to test payment transactions with CBDCs on the digi­tal Silk Road.\n\nInternationalisation of Chinese retail payment systems\n\nThe private digital payment platforms Alipay and WeChat Pay are now active in around 50 foreign markets. They enable Chinese tourists there to make purchases and payments using the payment systems they are familiar with at home. Although the use of a CBDC is not yet possible for Chinese people abroad, it could be easily realised by adapting the apps. In the future, payments could also be made in e-CNY at the foreign point-of-sale stations of the Chinese credit card company Union Pay, which is represented at 27 million points of sale in 73 countries. Under com­petitive conditions, Alipay, WeChat Pay and Union Pay have not been able to match their domestic com­mercial success abroad. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that e-CNY will become more widespread in trans­actions beyond China’s borders via private Chinese retail payment systems. It can be assumed that there will be a corresponding demand, for example in intra-African trade or for guest worker remittances in the Global South. Technically, it would not be a problem to open the apps up to foreigners, especially as the standard user interfaces of Huawei smartphones, for example, already include an e-CNY application. How­ever, foreign users would have to have an electronic e-CNY wallet with Alipay, WeChat Pay or a certified bank. The granting of corresponding authorisations could result in currency substitution effects in the target country (“yuanisation”). Such an infringement of monetary sovereignty would be in striking contra­diction to the principle of CBDC interoperability established by the BIS, to which the PBoC has also committed itself in its white paper.\n\nChina is likely to play a leading role in setting international standards due to its pioneering approach.\n\nSetting international standards\n\nIt is conceivable that non-Chinese jurisdictions will permit the cross-border use of the e-CNY in one way or another for reasons of practicality and simply uni­laterally accept the standards that have been devel­oped in China. However, the resulting dependencies vis-à-vis China suggest that most states are likely to refuse this type of unilateral approach. It is very likely that the establishment of a modern, efficient system for international CBDC transactions will only be realisable on a larger scale if financial authorities and central banks agree bilaterally or multilaterally on an interoperable platform and the common stan­dards on which it is based. The central banks involved would have to commit to uniform message standards, agree on rules for determining the finality of pay­ments, define the technical interfaces that enable transactions via different systems and set up a clear­ing mechanism. It is currently still unclear whether – and, if so, within what framework – multilaterally harmonised standardisation is possible. The mod­ernisation of the international payment system is on the agenda of the G20, the G7, the IMF, the BIS, the OECD and the BRICS countries. China is active in the various efforts to set international standards in several ways. It is a member of the relevant standardisation committees of the Financial Stability Board of the G20, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the BIS and, as mentioned, has co-devel­oped customised interoperability as part of the mBridge project. The exchanges between the central banks of the United Kingdom (BOE), Canada (BOC), Japan (BOJ), Sweden (Riksbank), Switzerland (SNB), the United States (Fed) and the eurozone (ECB) on the fundamental questions regarding the design of CBDCs, in which China is not involved, could also be the starting point for setting international standards. Although it is not yet clear how the further coordination and discussions will advance, it is likely that China will play an important, perhaps even a leading role in setting international standards due to its pioneering approach, its expertise and the experience it has gained. However, it is also conceivable that it will not be possible to develop or implement uniform global standards. It can then be assumed that China will develop a multilateral payment system for its CBDC, the standards for which correspond to its own ideas and interests, but which will only be accepted for use by some of the states, and most likely not by the G7 countries.\n\nPromoting the internationalisation of the renminbi?\n\nThere is widespread expectation in China that the e‑CNY will provide a new and effective momentum for the broader international use of the RMB, especial­ly as the escalation of the Sino-US rivalry has given political urgency and priority to the goal of RMB inter­nationalisation.\n\nHowever, as already discussed, it is unclear whether, when and how an interoperable cross-border sys­tem for payment transactions will materialise. It is also likely that China’s e-CNY will be met with great scepticism abroad. Regardless of these reservations, however, the People’s Republic, with its technological expertise and political influence, could succeed in establishing the e-CNY as the payment means of choice in the inevitable digitalisation of international payments. The RMB would then gain status on a global level. For China itself, digital capital trans­actions with foreign countries would be easier to monitor, meaning that controls could be relaxed.\n\nHigher percentage shares of the RMB in global payment transactions do not necessarily lead to a greater attractive­ness for other monetary functions.\n\nHowever, its use as a means of payment is only one of several monetary functions that determine the appeal of an international currency. Higher percentage shares of the RMB in global payment transactions – possibly also in global foreign exchange trading – do not necessarily translate into a greater attractiveness for other monetary functions, particularly as a private investment vehicle or reserve currency. Even if the interoperability of digital payment transaction systems is possible with e-CNY, the willingness of investors to hold large quantities of RMB will remain low as long as China continues to maintain capital controls and market access barriers to its domestic capital market. Not only does the PRC lack an open, deep and well-developed capital market where RMB could be invested freely and indefinitely, the avail­able information on Chinese companies and debt instruments is not reliable. China’s politics and insti­tutions do not enjoy the trust of the global financial markets. There are doubts as to whether invested capi­tal can be withdrawn from China even in finan­cial crises. In view of the political and economic un­certainties in the People’s Republic, it is uncertain how stable the value of the RMB will be in the long term.\n\nUltimately, the e‑CNY is not a new currency, but a technology and an infrastructure. The e‑CNY gives Chinese central bank money a new, digital form. However, the issuance of e‑CNY is not accompanied by an expansion of the money supply, which could potentially spread outside of China’s borders. Con­ceptually, the e-CNY is 100 per cent backed sovereign money. It is therefore to be expected that, as long as China maintains capital controls, the RMB will con­tinue to play only an outsider role as a global credit and investment vehicle.\n\nInstrument of foreign and security policy\n\nChina’s various efforts to achieve interoperability in cross-border digital payment transactions are proof that the e-CNY project has taken on a strong inter­national focus beyond its original objective of protect­ing national monetary sovereignty. For China, digital currency policy is not only monetary and currency policy, but also, and above all, trade and industrial policy, as well as foreign and security policy. China’s goal is to counteract its own disadvantages in the multilateral financial system, reduce its existing eco­nomic and political vulnerabilities, develop its own economically profitable industrial capacities, and, in the medium to long term, reshape the existing global structures in a way that they become compatible with China’s authoritarian one-party system.\n\nDigital central bank money offers China the opportunity for a new disruptive start.\n\nFrom a Chinese perspective, the current system of international payments is not only costly and ineffi­cient. It is also problematic in terms of foreign and security policy, as it gives America – its geostrategic rival – the power to exclude individuals, companies and countries from this international payment sys­tem. Individuals and companies from China, Hong Kong and Macao have already been the target of American financial sanctions on several occasions. Digital central bank money offers China the opportunity for a new disruptive start. An e-CNY that can be used in international business transactions would not only reduce vulnerability to Western financial sanctions. What’s more, a new, innovative system of international payments that is based on an interoperable CBDC would no longer be dollar-centred. The newly emerging structures could create new depen­dencies in the future – now vis-à-vis the PRC. Beijing would gain new power resources and capabilities with a prospective China-centred infrastructure for payment transactions, and it would give it access to payment data worldwide. A functioning infrastructure for cross-border payments with CBDCs under Chinese leadership could substantially improve China’s geopolitical position in several respects:\n\nBy participating in the new China-centred digital payment system, foreign companies and countries would become dependent on the new infrastructure, its reliability and the continual software up­dates that are required. China’s approach of expanding its own sphere of influence abroad by exporting technology and infrastructure is well known, not least from the discussions about Huawei’s telecommunications hardware and Chinese surveillance software. The willingness of countries that use these technologies to respond to Beijing’s wishes for cooperation in politics and business – and also to refrain from criticising their Chinese partner – would inevitably increase.\n\nAs mentioned above, China’s security and financial authorities would gain a new lever for extraterritorial control and surveillance. They could track international transactions and use the information obtained to take action against capital flight, crime and criticism of the regime. If blockchain-based programmability is available, Chinese authorities could even block or reverse certain payments. The new digital infrastructure for international payments “made in China” would also give Chinese authorities and digital companies privileged access to payment data within the new system. The Chi­nese state could use this wealth of data – combined with other personal or company-related in­for­mation – for propaganda purposes or for coercive measures against foreign companies and states, for instance. For Chinese digital companies, the data could potentially be advantageous in international competition.\n\nCircumventing Western financial sanctions would be easier and cheaper in the future with a functioning digital payment system. Transfers could be made outside of Western clearing houses and bypass the SWIFT system (which is blocked in the event of sanctions). It would also no longer be possible for the initiators of the sanctions to immediately identify, let alone prove, a breach of Western sanctions. However, the Western side could continue to respond to a breach of sanctions by imposing secondary sanctions. In this case, how­ever, the secondary sanctions target would not be a Chinese company or commercial bank, but the state-owned PBoC itself. The Sino-American conflict would reach a new level of escalation. Given this kind of escalation risk, it is unlikely that the PRC would be willing to allow third countries to use the e-CNY in order to circumvent sanctions. China would probably want to reserve this option for itself.\n\nChina’s potential gains in power described here are currently only hypothetical. It is uncertain whether – and, if so, when – interoperability in cross-border payment transactions with CBDCs will be realised. The technical and regulatory obstacles as well as the difficulties regarding sovereignty are enormous. The majority of countries would probably also refuse to accept an infrastructure in which China had complete data sovereignty and could carry out all programming itself. However, there are also huge economic and political incentives to make international payment transactions more cost-effective and efficient and to protect them against Western threats of sanctions. It is rather likely that human ingenuity will solve the remaining implementation problems."
