That year, for the first time, authorities allowed Chinese firms to buy and sell the yuan in exchange for US dollars for imports of goods and services. Since then, China has liberalised its current account and allowed freer flows.\n\n03:05\n\nWhat happened at the Chinese Communist Party’s major policy meeting, the fifth plenum?\n\nWhat happened at the Chinese Communist Party’s major policy meeting, the fifth plenum?\n\nHowever, the yuan is not fully convertible in the capital account – which records the net flows of transactions between China and the rest of the world – as Beijing continues to maintain strict currency controls on portfolios, as well as plant and equipment investments.\n\nTo encourage the international use of the yuan, Beijing has supplied renminbi liquidity to foreign countries through swap agreements, and outsourced yuan-denominated businesses for borrowing, lending and bond issuances to offshore financial centres, especially Hong Kong.\n\nThis arrangement has resulted in two market prices for the yuan’s value against foreign currencies, albeit with only a slight difference. The onshore yuan, with its abbreviation CNY, is used within China and its value is “managed” by the PBOC; while the offshore yuan CNH rate is traded more freely outside mainland China.\n\nCan the yuan replace the US dollar?\n\nUnder the current international monetary system, the US dollar is the dominant currency for invoicing, investment and central bank reserves, but the threat of US sanctions has sparked fears Chinese financial institutions may be cut off from the global US dollar payment system.\n\nAs a result, China is urgently trying to crack the hegemony of the US dollar and promote use of the yuan beyond its borders to minimise disruptions to its trade and investment activities.\n\nAfter plunging abruptly in 2015, international use of the yuan started to recover last year as major steps were taken to open up China’s financial markets to foreign investors and entities.\n\nBut the yuan still has a long way to go before it is truly global and is unlikely to replace the US dollar any time soon unless the Chinese government relaxes its rigid capital controls, analysts said.\n\nThe latest data from the International Monetary Fund showed the yuan’s share of global currency reserves was 2 per cent in the second quarter of 2020, well below the US dollar’s 61.3 per cent.\n\nSimilarly the yuan’s share of global payments was 1.97 per cent in September, the fifth most active currency, while the US dollar was in first position, commanding 38.45 per cent of payments.\n\n“Far more must be done for the yuan to really displace the dollar. A fully open capital account remains a key prerequisite,” said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis.\n\n“These days, 2030 seems to be China’s new target for achieving that, with the previous goal of 2020 fading from memory.”\n\nWant to know more?\n\nIn every episode of the Inside China podcast, we take a deep-dive into a specific topic, mixing independent reporting and exclusive interviews to bring you unique insights into an emerging potential superpower. Now, we are featuring regular updates on the coronavirus pandemic from across the country.\n\nAlso, each week political economy journalist Finbarr Bermingham wraps up the latest developments in tariffs, diplomacy and economics from reporters and editors at the Post in the US-China trade war podcast."
