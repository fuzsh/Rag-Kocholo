        "text": "Chinese Currency || Discover The RMB / CNY\n\nChinese Currency üí∞ LTL‚Äôs Guide to Chinese Money\n\nWhat is the Chinese Currency and how do you talk about it in Chinese?\n\nAnd what are all those interesting places on the Chinese banknotes?\n\nLook no further friends, our guide to Chinese money will take you through the answers to these questions, as well as giving you a whistle stop tour of some great places to visit in China.\n\nChinese Money | How to Talk About Chinese Currency\n\nChinese Money | History of Chinese Currency\n\nChinese Money | The Banknotes\n\nChinese Money | China‚Äôs Growing Cashless Society\n\nChinese Money | Chinese Banknote Scenery\n\nChinese Money | FAQs\n\nHow to Talk About Chinese Currency\n\nFirstly, talking about Chinese money can be a bit confusing. The official name for China‚Äôs currency is ‚ÄòRenminbi‚Äô ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂ∏Å (R√©nm√≠nb√¨), which literally translates into English as ‚ÄòThe People‚Äôs Currency‚Äô. It is often abbreviated to RMB.\n\n‚ÄòYuan‚Äô ÂÖÉ (Yu√°n) is the unit of measurement for the RMB, but is also used to refer to the currency as a whole: Chinese Yuan.\n\nThis also has an abbreviation CNY, which is also used as the international code for the Chinese currency. The symbol for the Yuan is ¬•.\n\nTo confuse us all further, in spoken Chinese ‚Äòyuan‚Äô is also called ‚Äòku√†i‚Äô Âùó.\n\nIf we use a comparison to British currency then, ‚ÄòRenminbi‚Äô would be like ‚ÄúPounds Sterling‚Äù which is the official name for the currency and ‚Äòyuan‚Äô would be like ‚ÄúPounds‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄòKuai‚Äô is a bit like saying ‚Äòquid‚Äô, an informal way of saying pounds, except that ‚ÄòKuai‚Äô is used more commonly. ‚ÄòYuan‚Äô is used more rarely in casual conversations.\n\nThere are also smaller denominations of Chinese currency:\n\n1 yuan is worth 10 ‚Äòji«éo‚Äô Ëßí (also generally referred to as ‚Äòm√°o‚Äô ÊØõ in spoken Chinese). Furthermore, 1 ‚Äòjiao‚Äô can then divided in 10 ‚Äòfƒìn‚Äô ÂàÜ, but fen are rarely used in China today.\n\nChinese Currency History\n\nThe People‚Äôs Bank of China introduced the Renminbi in December 1948.\n\nInitially only bank notes were issued and they began to circulate in areas of Communist-controlled China.\n\nThis was just under a year before the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in October 1949.\n\nThe new government aimed to end the hyper-inflation that had been in a problem during the final years of the Republic of China.\n\nIn 1955 the yuan was revalued: 1 new yuan was equal to 10,000 old yuan.\n\nChinese Banknotes\n\nThe current series of Chinese banknotes is the fifth series of the renminbi; it has been progressively introduced from 1999.\n\nSpecifically, it is divided into 100, 50, 20, 10, 5 and 1 yuan notes.\n\nOlder releases of Chinese currency also included a 2 yuan note, but this is very rarely seen today.\n\nSmaller note denominations of 5 and 1 jiao are also commonly circulated. The 2 jiao note can also be found rarely.\n\nChairman Mao is featured on all the modern yuan notes, in place of the various leaders which have featured earlier.\n\nAdditionally, each note has the words ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Bank of China‚Äô written in mandarin on one side, as well as in the Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian and Zhuang languages on the reverse.\n\nChina‚Äôs Growing Cashless Society\n\nNonetheless, these days seeing a Chinese note is not as common as you‚Äôd imagine, lots of people having converted to using online payment apps.\n\nAt the till, you‚Äôll see people flash their phones quickly at the cashier, or hold up their phone to scan a QR code much more often than you‚Äôll see someone reach for their wallet.\n\nDID YOU KNOW ‚Äì In some cases, smaller shops will refuse to accept your cash, though most places will just give you an eye roll as they search around for bits of change. Still, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî the majority of places in Shanghai accept cash no problem.\n\nThe two most popular payment apps are WeChat and Alipay. To set up these payment systems you usually have to connect your bank card to the account and verify your identity with your passport or Chinese ID.\n\nChinese bankcards can be used for both apps, and Alipay has started to accept some international cards too.\n\nYou can either perform a small transaction to transfer money to your WeChat and Alipay accounts, or if you don‚Äôt have enough money in your account balance, money will be taken directly from the card you connected.\n\nWeChat has become particular popular for payment functions, such as the ‚Äúsplit bill‚Äù option for group messages.\n\nNot sure which one will be better for you?

Built in 1959 as one of the ‚ÄòTen Great Constructions‚Äô for the 10th anniversary of the PRC, the Great Hall of the People is China‚Äôs political hub.\n\nConstruction of the building took just 10 months to complete.\n\nAlthough not on the list of many tourists coming to Beijing, The Great Hall of the People‚Äôs location in the West side of Tian‚Äôanmen Square means that most people visiting Beijing will get a glimpse of the building, even if they don‚Äôt know what it is.\n\nThe hall used for China‚Äôs parliamentary meetings along with other legislative and ceremonial activities.\n\nThe building itself is covers an area larger than the Forbidden City, making it one of the largest hall structures in the world.\n\nThough the hall is closed during national conferences or other large-scale political events, the public are allowed access for just 30CNY. Remember to bring your passport for entry to the building.\n\n50 Yuan | The Potala Palace, Lhasa, Tibet\n\nÂ∏ÉËææÊãâÂÆ´ B√π d√° lƒÅ g≈çng ‚Äì Potala Palace\n\nSecondly, the 50 Yuan billion! The Potala Palace was once home to the Dalai Lama and is now one of the must visit museums and world heritage sites in Tibet.\n\nEach year the site attracts nearly 1.5 million tourists.\n\nIt was originally built in 1645 at an altitude of 3,700m, and is rumoured to have been built on the site over an ancient palace.\n\nMake sure you‚Äôre ready for the climb! There are 432 steps to reach the top at the Potala Palace.\n\nThe Putuo Zoncheng temple, located in Chengde and built between 1767 and 1771, was modelled after the Potala Palace and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre coming to China for a brief visit or don‚Äôt have time to make it all the way to Tibet, why not explore Chengde, just a few hours North of Beijing.\n\n20 Yuan | The Li River, Yangshuo, Nr Guilin\n\nÊºìÊ±ü L√≠jiƒÅng ‚Äì Li River (Not to be confused with Lijiang town in Yunnan Province)\n\nThe Li River featured on the 20 yuan note is a scene taken from the 83 km which flow from Guilin to Yangshui in Guangxi province.\n\nThis stretch of river is famous for its karst mountain scenery; it‚Äôs well known as one of the most beautiful places in China, attracting thousands of visitors each year.\n\nInterestingly, the Li River was featured in National Geographic as one of the world‚Äôs top ten watery wonders.\n\nThe specific scene on the 20 Yuan note is a view of fisherman on a bamboo raft floating down river, much like the raft in the photo to the left, very close to the small town of Xingping.\n\nIf you‚Äôre feeling adventurous you can have a go on a raft yourself on your visit.\n\n10 Yuan | Kui Gate, The Yangtze Three Gorges (Between Chongqing and Yichang)\n\nÂ§îÈó® Ku√≠ m√©n = Kui Gate\n\nThe scene featured on the 10 Yuan note is one of the most famous views of the Yangzte River. The shot is taken along the Three Gorges (Qutang Gorge, Wu Gorge and Xiling Gorge) section of the river.\n\nThe Kui Gate is the upstream entrance of the Qutang Gorge, the most Westerly of the three.\n\nThe Kui Gate is also known as Qutang Pass or ‚Äòthe door of the Three Gorges‚Äô. There are sheer cliffs on both sides of the river at this point.\n\nThe river flows into the Three Gorges via this gate all the way from its basin in Sichuan.\n\nThe best way to see the scenery of the 3 gorges is to take Yangzte river cruise either from Yichang or Chongqing.\n\n5 Yuan | Tai Shan, Shandong Province\n\nÊ≥∞Â±± T√†ishƒÅn ‚Äì Tai Mountain\n\nTai Shan (or Mount Tai) is one of the five Daoist sacred mountains in China.\n\nLocated just north of Tai‚Äôan city in central Shandong province, Tai Shan is the most climbed mountain in China.\n\nMany visitors climb Tai Shan in the middle of the night so that they can catch a glimpse of the famous sunrise over the sea of clouds.\n\nThe mountain has a long history of inspiring Chinese artists as well as scholars.\n\nIt has been an object of worship for thousands of years, since even before the famous Qinshi Huangdi was said to have paid tribute to the mountain, telling the gods of his victory in unifying China.\n\nTOP TIP | Confucius‚Äô home town Qufu, only 70km from Taishan, is also well worth a visit!\n\n1 Yuan | West Lake ‚ÄúThree Ponds Reflecting the Moon‚Äô, Hangzhou\n\nË•øÊπñ Xƒ´h√∫ ‚Äì West Lake\n\nLastly, Three Ponds Mirroring the Moon, the scene featured on the 1 Yuan note, is one of the ‚Äú10 Scenic Spots‚Äù around Hangzhou‚Äôs West Lake.\n\nThe spot is located in the centre of West Lake and can be accessed by one of the many small ferries, which take tourists to different points on and around the lake.\n\nThree Ponds Mirroring the Moon gets its name from a particular practise which takes place during China‚Äôs Mid-Autumn festival.\n\nOn this night, when the moon is at its brightest, a candle is lit inside each of the pagodas.\n\nThe light from the moon and each of the small windows in the pagodas cast their refections on the water.\n\nWest Lake is another very famous tourist attraction in China. It certainly has inspired countless mentions in traditional Chinese poetry and literature throughout the centuries.\n\nChinese Currency || FAQs\n\nWhat is the difference between RMB and Yuan?\n\nThey‚Äôre technically about the same thing! They‚Äôre different names for Chinese currency. ‚ÄúYuan‚Äù tends to be more colloquial, probably because it has less syllables to say. RMB is the more technical term, as it‚Äôs the official abbreviation for Renminbi. The most common form, however, is ‚Äúkuai‚Äù.\n\nHow much is $100 US Dollars in China?\n\nIt fluctuates. As of November 2020, it‚Äôs about ¬•660.\n\nIs 100 RMB a lot in China?\n\nIt may not translate to a lot in US Dollars ‚Äî it‚Äôs only a little more than $15 ‚Äî but it is more than sufficient to pay for a day‚Äôs worth of public transportation and local food. However, if you want to live a bit more lavishly, you‚Äôll need more than 100 RMB per day.\n\nWhat can you buy for 1 dollar in China?\n\nIn Shanghai, I‚Äôve bought these for around 1 US Dollar, which is approximately 6-7 RMB.\n\n‚Äì 3 waters\n\n‚Äì 1 tea or juice\n\n‚Äì 1 ice cream\n\n‚Äì Breakfast or lunch\n\n‚Äì Various types of snacks\n\n‚Äì Bus and/or subway (subway can go more or less, depending on distance)\n\nHow do you say Cryptocurrency in Chinese?\n\nCryptocurrency in Chinese is Âä†ÂØÜË¥ßÂ∏Å jiƒÅm√¨ hu√≤b√¨.\n\nCheck out this blog for LOTS of cryptocurrency related words in Chinese.\n\nWant more from LTL?\n\nIf you wish to hear more from LTL Mandarin School why not join our mailing list.\n\nWe give plenty of handy information on learning Chinese, useful apps to learn the language and everything going on at our LTL schools!\n\nSign up below and become part of our ever-growing community!"
