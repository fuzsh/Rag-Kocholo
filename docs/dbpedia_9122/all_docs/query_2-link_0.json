        "text": "The People’s Bank of China has exclusive authority to issue currency. Banknotes are issued in denominations from 1 fen to 100 renminbi. The obverse of some banknotes contains images of communist leaders, such as Mao Zedong, leader of China’s communist revolution, whose likeness is pictured on several notes; lower denominations often contain images of people dressed in traditional attire. The reverse side of most coins, which range in denominations from 1 fen to 1 renminbi, contains images of historic buildings and the country’s diverse landscape. Renminbi became the official name of the currency in 1969.\n\nAs China became one of the world’s preeminent centres of finance and trade in the early 21st century, the renminbi rose as a global currency. In recognition of the renminbi’s elevated status, in November 2015 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the renminbi was to become one of its reserve currencies. Thus, it would join the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound sterling, and the Japanese yen as one of the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights currencies used for intergovernmental loans. The renminbi’s status change took effect in late 2016."
