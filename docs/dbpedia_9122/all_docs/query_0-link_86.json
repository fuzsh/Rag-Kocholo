        "text": "In the growing global bifurcation, those leaning toward the US won’t be feeling too much difference in the usage of the dollar in cross-border trade finance and forex reserves. But for those in China-leaning countries, the changes are more palpable.\n\nAs Visual Capitalist shows, China’s renminbi overtook the dollar in March 2023 as a share of China’s trade settlements, the first time in history. The renminbi, also called the yuan, at the end of March this year accounted for 53% of cross-border payments and receipts in the world’s second-largest economy. The dollar now stands at 43%, down from 83% in 2010.\n\nGlobally, the dollar’s share of trade finance payments also has declined since early 2022. At the same time, the yuan’s share has more than doubled, from around 4% to 8%, IMF data shows.\n\nThis is not only because Russia, at war with Ukraine and the West, has increasingly turned to China as a financial lifeline. The share of the renminbi in trade finance has increased across a wide swath of countries that aren’t considered to be squarely in the Western bloc. The yuan’s share of all cross-border transactions of Chinese non-bank entities with foreign counterparts was close to zero 15 years ago, but has risen to around 50% in late 2023, the IMF says. Meantime, the dollar has fallen from around 80% in 2010 to 50% in 2023."
