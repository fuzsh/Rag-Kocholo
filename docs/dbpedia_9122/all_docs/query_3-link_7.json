        "text": "The Making of China's Exchange Rate Policy by Leong H. Liew; Harry X. Wu\n\nCall Number: HG3873.C45 L54 2007\n\nISBN: 9781843760085\n\nTable of contents\n\nThis book examines the major economic and political factors influencing China's exchange rate policies from the foundation of the People's Republic to the present. It considers how national economic and political priorities, international influences, domestic institutional interests and the new constraints imposed by China's rapidly globalising post-Mao economy determine exchange rate policy. The authors argue that China's exchange rate decisions were not made simply in response to external pressures, rather that they were formed on the basis of domestic assessments of domestic circumstances to serve domestic interests. They go on to illustrate that such decisions are made on the basis of what policymakers perceive are the nation's best interests, and thus constitute dynamic interplay between national priorities and the interests of institutional and non-institutional actors in the policy arena.Fulfilling the demand for further research on how China formulates exchange rate policy, this book will strongly appeal to a wide-ranging audience including: students, academics and researchers with an interest in political economy, Asian studies, international relations, comparative politics, international business and international economics and finance. Policymakers and bankers will also find much to interest them in this book.\n\nChina's Currency and Economic Issues by Marc Labonte; Wayne M. Morrison; Jonathan E. Sanford\n\nCall Number: HG1285 .C48263 2004\n\nISBN: 1594549346\n\nTable of contents\n\nChina has a policy of pegging its currency (the yuan) to the U.S. dollar. If the yuan is undervalued against the dollar, there are likely to be both benefits and costs to the U.S. economy. It would mean that imported Chinese goods are cheaper than they would be if the yuan were market determined. This lowers prices for U.S. consumers and diminishes inflationary pressures. It also lowers prices for U.S. firms that use imported inputs (such as parts) in their production, making such firms more competitive. Critics of China's peg point to the large and growing U.S. trade deficit with China as evidence that the yuan is undervalued and harmful to the U.S. economy. The relationship is more complex, for a number of reasons. First, while China runs a large trade surplus with the United States, it runs a significant trade deficit with the rest of the world. Second, an increasing level of Chinese exports are from foreign invested companies in China that have shifted production there to take advantage of China's abundant low cost labour. Third, the deficit masks the fact that China has become one of the fastest growing markets for U.S. exports. Finally, the trade deficit with China accounted for 23% of the sum of total U.S. bilateral trade deficits in 2004, indicating that the overall trade deficit is not caused by the exchange rate policy of one country, but rather the shortfall between U.S. saving and investment. This book presents a coherent examination of the details behind China's currency policies as they relate to outside factors.\n\nIs China Ready to Challenge the Dollar? by Melissa Murphy; Wen Jin Yuan\n\nCall Number: HG3978 .M868 2009\n\nISBN: 9780892065905\n\nWhile China is still a long way from challenging the dollar's global reserve currency status, as the largest holder of U.S. debt, Beijing is undoubtedly nervous about the prospect of a weaker dollar and is taking steps to diversify its reserves, as well as to internationalize the renminbi. There also seems little doubt that in the next decade China will emerge as a major player in the international financial system. Given the strategic geopolitical and economic implications of these developments, this report attempts to provide a clearer understanding of what is motivating Beijing's current moves, where its policy is likely headed, and the implications for the United States.\n\nGaining Currency by Eswar S. Prasad\n\nCall Number: HG1285 .P73 2017\n\nISBN: 9780190631055\n\nChina's currency, the renminbi (RMB), has taken the world by storm. The RMB is well on its way to becoming a significant international currency, one that is used widely in international trade and finance. This book documents the RMB's impressive rise, with China successfully adopting a uniqueplaybook for promoting its currency. China's growing economic might, expanding international influence, and the rise of its currency are all intricately connected. The book documents how China's government has tied these goals together, enabling faster progress towards each of them. But there are many pitfalls ahead, both for China'seconomy and its currency. The book shows how the government has so far navigated its way around domestic and international dangers, but enormous risks still lie ahead. The International Monetary Fund has elevated the RMB to the status of an official reserve currency, a currency that foreign central banks use to keep their rainy day funds. If China plays its cards right, with reforms that put its economy and financial markets on the right track, the RMB is going tobecome an important reserve currency that could rival some of the traditional reserve currencies such as the euro and the Japanese yen. But this book argues that there are limits to the RMB's ascendance-the hype about its inevitable rise to global dominance is overblown. The Chinese leadership's apparent commitment to financial sector and other market-oriented reforms-coupled with unambiguous repudiation of political, legal, and institutional reforms-sets the RMB on a clear course. It will attain the status of a reserve currency over time but has essentially givenup its claim of being seen as a safe haven currency, one that investors turn to for safety. The RMB will erode but not seriously challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance in international finance.\n\nFrom Trade Surplus to the Dispute over the Exchange Rate: Quantitative Analysis of Rmb Appreciation by Xin Li; Dianqing Xu\n\nCall Number: HF1014 .X56 2016\n\nISBN: 9789814723954\n\nSince 2005, China has been accused of causing the trade deficit and manipulating the exchange rate. At the same time, there have been arguments against the RMB appreciation. The reason for this conflict is the lack of quantitative research or elaboration on many extremely important indicators. To correctly describe the industrial chain and value-added process around the world, it is necessary to identify data by using new methods and separating the processing trade from the non-processing trade based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data. This book establishes a Global Multi-department Computable General Equilibrium (GMCGE) model based on the continuous global input-output database. It focuses on the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model that constructs a consistent interaction mechanism within the economic system and fully reflects the general equilibrium characteristics and thus tries to avoid the limitations of the partial equilibrium model. It shows how the GMCGE framework can distinguish the processing trade from non-processing trade in the input-output data, and at the same time ensure the endogenous equilibrium of the social accounting matrix (SAM) after distinction."
