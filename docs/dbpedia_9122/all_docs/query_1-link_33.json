        "text": "Money Exchanging\n\nCurrency Exchange, Bank of China\n\nI am an American, and the exchange rate in my country is very bad. Can I exchange money in China? Is it easier to do it in the country?\n\nAnswer: It is quite easy to exchange money in China and the rates will be more favorable, but it is advisable to exchange a small amount in your country before leaving.\n\nWhere can I exchange money in China?\n\nAnswer: Usually, four-star and five-star hotels offer exchange service, but only for their guest. There are counters at most airports in China, providing money exchanging service. Mostly people will also go to banks in downtown areas. Remember to take your passport, which need to be presented when converting currency in the country. However, for remote areas, it is difficult to exchange currency or use a credit card, so it is advisable to take enough money when you are going to visit the remote area.\n\nWhen getting Chinese currency, I was given many 100 Yuan notes, the lowest value was 50 Yuan. If I had been traveling on my own I would have faced difficulties as taxis and buses. The drivers sometimes find it impossible to give change. So if possible try to get some low value notes too to help with paying for transport, postage etc?\n\nFor the sake of easy carriage, the bank staff will always give you some big notes. However, you can ask them to give you a 100 Yuan of small change. It is strongly advised to take some small change with you.\n\nCan I exchange the unused Renminbi back in US dollars?\n\nAnswer: Of course you can. Please keep all your exchange receipts, which you must present. However, such exchange can be quite unfavorable in rates, you'd better use all your Chinese money before you left.\n\nIs there anything else worthy of note when exchanging money?\n\nAnswer: Yes. The following things merit attention:\n\n1. Choose a bank which is the nearest to your hotel if you are going to exchange a large amount of money or you can exchange in your hotel directly if it offers this service.\n\n2. Do not exchange money in the street or the small shops which is mostly illegal and sometimes forgeries may be given.\n\nCan I use RMB in Macau and Hong Kong?\n\nAnswer: Of course you can. 100 Yuan is widely accepted in Hong Kong, however, the small domination such as 10 Yuan and 20 Yuan are not so popular. Usually, you pay them in RMB; they will give you changes in Hong Kong Dollar. Note that the exchange rate is not as satisfying as in mainland.\n\nCan you give the latest exchange rate?\n\nAnswer: The exchange rate is changing all the time; please refer to Currency Conversion for the latest rate."
