        "text": "China has a long and rich history, and its currency reflects this. Chinese notes and coins are some of the most beautiful in the world. The notes are brightly coloured, with intricate designs that tell a story. The coins are also beautifully designed, with different images on each side. Many of the designs on both notes and coins are based on traditional Chinese symbols and motifs. This makes them not only visually stunning but also culturally significant.\n\nChinese banknotes feature the portrait of Mao Zedong (also known as Chairman Mao), the founder of the People’s Republic of China, on the obverse. While on the reverse side, various famous Chinese landmarks are featured, such as:\n\n100 yuan – The Great Hall of the People, Beijing\n\n50 yuan – The Potala Palace, Lhasa\n\n20 yuan – The Li River, Guilin\n\n10 yuan – The Yangtze Three Gorges, Central China\n\n5 yuan – Mount Tai, Shandong Province\n\n1 yuan – West Lake, Hangzhou\n\nAs for 1 and 5 Jiao notes, their designs feature the emblem of the PRC (obverse) and Chinese minorities (reverse).\n\nChina began to use currency in the form of sea shells, which then led to the establishment of a barter system. Eventually, bronze coins were created as substitutes for those objects. This material was chosen for minting coins because China had already used it extensively.\n\nThe increasing trade and development of markets during the era before the Qin dynasty resulted in different types of currencies being used, such as fabrics (bu bi), knives (dao bin), shells carved in bronze (daiming tongbei) and round coins (huan qian). The shapes, instruments and tools that these currencies were based on varied depending on the region or city. This was due to the rapid economic growth market traders experienced then.\n\nAt its peak, the Han dynasty saw a rise in trading activity. As a result, people were allowed to mint their own coins. However, this led to two major issues: counterfeiting and poorer-quality coins.\n\nCurrently, the yuan or renminbi is the current legal tender in China. This currency was established with the foundation of the People’s Bank of China (China’s Central Bank) by the Chinese government and issued for the first time shortly before the Chinese Communists won the Civil War in 1949. After taking control, one of the government’s earliest tasks was to end the hyperinflation during the Kuomintang rule’s final years.\n\nTipping is not a local custom in Mainland China, which differs from many Western countries where it is common to tip waiters, taxi drivers, and hotel staff. If tips are offered in China, they may be refused or cause embarrassment.\n\nAlthough tipping is not customary in China, there may be a few instances where it would be appropriate to do so. Doing some research beforehand can avoid any potential cultural missteps while travelling in China. Here are a few potential scenarios where tipping might be expected:\n\nRestaurants: Tipping is not common practice in China, so you won’t need to worry about leaving a gratuity for your waiter or waitress. However, if you’re dining at a restaurant that offers exceptional service, feel free to leave 10-15% of your bill as a tip.\n\nHotels: As with restaurants in China, you’ll find that hotel employees provide great service without expecting anything extra in return. Unless you’re staying at a traditional Chinese-style hotel where hospitality and room service are taken to a whole new level, then tipping might be appreciated. If you choose to give a tip, do so discreetly to avoid any awkwardness. RMB50-100 should be sufficient.\n\nTaxis: Taxi drivers in China don’t expect tips, but you may want to round up the fare to the nearest Chinese renminbi or yuan to show appreciation for their services. It’s important to agree on your fare with the taxi driver before you start your journey, especially if you’re not using a ride-hailing service like Didi.\n\nTour guides: If you’re taking a tour of China led by a local guide, giving them a small token of appreciation at the end of your trip is customary. RMB200-300 per person per day is a reasonable amount to tip your tour guide.\n\nSpa: Pamper yourself with a traditional Chinese massage or reflexology treatment during your stay. Tipping is not expected. Instead, it’s considered good manners to simply tell your therapist that you enjoyed your experience.\n\nKeep in mind that the amount you tip should be based on your level of satisfaction with the service you received. In China, it’s more about the gesture than the actual monetary value of the tip.\n\nBudget\n\nIf you’re looking to spend less than RMB 285-300 (AUD $61-65) daily, you’ll need to be resourceful. This budget is only suitable for backpackers or those happy to rough it a bit. With AUD $80, you can expect to eat street food, take public transportation, and stay in a hostel or dormitory-style accommodation. Mainly, you must cook your own meals, do your own laundry, and be very strategic about where you spend your money. You can still enjoy a few basic activities and attractions, but your choices will be limited.\n\nModerate\n\nYou can expect to spend between RMB 700-1,000 (AUD $150-215) daily for a more comfortable budget yet still a reasonable price. This is a happy medium for many travellers as it allows you to eat out occasionally, take taxis when necessary, and enjoy some of China’s attractions without worrying too much about the cost. You can also afford to stay in a nicer hotel or hostel and enjoy some creature comforts that make travel more enjoyable.\n\nLuxury\n\nA budget of more than RMB 1,500 will let you live quite lavishly during your time in China. You’ll be able to eat at the best restaurants, stay in luxury hotels, and enjoy VIP treatment at many of the country’s attractions. Of course, this spending level is unnecessary– you can have an amazing time in China while sticking to a more moderate budget. It all depends on your preferences and travel style."
