        "text": "China’s currency - the Renminbi - ranks as the fifth most popular global payment currency.¹\n\nOn top of this, China has the second largest GDP in current dollars, making it a key target market for international business.²\n\nBut if you’re looking to break into this market, then you need to understand the Renminbi, which actually refers to two different currencies: CNY and CNH.\n\nThis article explores the ins and outs of the Renminbi, Yuan, and the difference between CNH and CNY.\n\nWhen importing from China and paying suppliers overseas, you can use Wise Business and payout in CNY to forget about long transfer times and hefty fees.\n\nUnderstand Chinese RenMinBi\n\nBefore looking at the difference between CNY and CNH, let’s first take a look at Renminbi and Yuan.\n\nWhat is RenMinBi (RMB) and what is Yuan?\n\nRenminbi (RMB) is the official name given to the currency belonging to the People’s Republic of China.\n\nThe name is the equivalent of Pound Sterling or Australian Dollar, for example.\n\nYuan, however, is the name given to the unit of currency.\n\nAnother example makes this distinction clear: although the official name of the currency in North America is the “US Dollar”, in day-to-day life it’s simply referred to as a dollar.\n\nThis is the exact same with Renminbi and Yuan, respectively.\n\nCNY vs CNH\n\nFrom here, there is another distinction to be made about Renminbi/Yuan.\n\nThere are two types of Renminbi - and, by implication, two types of Yuan. These are: CNY and CNH.\n\nCNY is the Chinese Yuan traded in the onshore market;\n\nCNH is the Chinese Yuan traded in the offshore market.\n\nCNH and CNY are valued at the same amount in Renminbi, and both of them are currencies of the same country (China). This means that CNH exchanges to CNY at a ratio of 1:1.\n\nDespite these similarities, CNY and CNH are not the same currency.\n\nThey are exchanged at different amounts, regulated by separate authorities, traded at different prices and have differing levels of restrictions.\n\nWhat are the differences between CNY and CNH\n\nHere’s a summary of the main differences between CNY vs CNH.\n\nCNYCNH People's Bank of China (PBOC) controls the reference rate, in which CNY can only fluctuate within a 2% range of the reference rate Free floating exchange rate determined by the market Regulated by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) Regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Restrictions exist for currency trading Can be traded without restrictions Only residents of Mainland China have access to the CNY market Residents and non-residents of Hong Kong, as well as certain residents of Mainland China, have access to the CNH market³\n\nWhat is CNH used for?\n\nCNH is the type of Renminbi traded in the offshore market.\n\nThe offshore market simply refers to everywhere outside of mainland China.\n\nHong Kong is considered part of the offshore market and thus trades using CNH.\n\nCNH is traded freely in currency markets across the globe and its price is determined by market forces.\n\nWhat is CNY used for?\n\nCNY, on the other hand, is the type of Renminbi traded in the onshore market - in other words, within mainland China.\n\nThe economy of mainland China is controlled by the government, with the price of CNY being controlled by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).\n\nThe reference rate for CNY is set daily and is only allowed to fluctuate within 2.0% of the reference rate each day.³\n\nPay employees or even other businesses from USD to CNY with Wise, and get the mid-market rate for your transfers. Learn more about CNY transfers on the link.\n\nSend payments to China with Wise\n\nCan you convert CNH to CNY?\n\nWithin China, CNH and CNY amount to the same value.\n\nThis means you can exchange CNY for CNH at a ratio of 1:1.\n\nHowever, when converting CNH and CNY into a foreign currency, the exchange rate will be different for each one. You can always check the latest exchange rate for USD to CNY.\n\nWhat does this mean for businesses importing from China?\n\nWhen importing goods from China, it’s important to be aware of what type of Renminbi you’re using - the difference between CNH vs CNY can cost you unnecessary money.\n\nWhen you’re sending money to China with a currency conversion, it’s likely to be in CNY - but if you’re receiving money from China, then it’ll probably be in CNH.\n\nGiven this complex payments landscape, you need a provider that can give you the best exchange rate possible, such as Wise.\n\nWith Wise, you can send money to China having it exchanged at the mid-market rate.\n\nYou can also find out the best time to exchange your money to CNY, using Wise’s exchange rate tracker - giving you live notifications about changes in the rate.\n\nWise is not a bank, but a Money Services Business (MSB) provider and a smart alternative to banks. The Wise Business account is designed with international business in mind, and makes it easy to send, hold, and manage business funds in 40+ currencies.
