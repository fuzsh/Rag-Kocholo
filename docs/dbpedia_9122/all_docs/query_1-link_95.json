Chinese yuan is readily available in the UK through our online exchange office.\n\nOur currency exchange platform is a hassle-free way to get the Chinese currency you need for your upcoming trip.\n\nAnd, for orders over £750, enjoy free delivery.

While you can exchange currency in China, having some local currency on hand when you arrive is more convenient.\n\nThis can help cover immediate expenses like transportation and small purchases. It’s a smart way to ensure you have cash available when you land in China and start your journey.\n\nWhat is the best currency to bring to China?\n\nWhen travelling to China, the Chinese yuan is the best currency to bring. Some tourist areas and larger hotels may accept US dollars or euros. However, having Chinese yuan on hand is generally more cost-effective and convenient.\n\nCan I use my bank card in China?\n\nYes, you can use your bank or credit card in China. However, it’s important to note that cash is the preferred method of payment in many places. You’ll need yuan for daily expenses in smaller towns and local markets.\n\nCredit or debit card payments are primarily possible in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. It’s advisable to carry both cash and a card for maximum flexibility.\n\nQuick reminder: Always inform your bank about your travel plans to avoid issues with card usage abroad.\n\nShould I use cash in China?\n\nAbsolutely, having some cash on hand in China is super handy. Here’s the deal:\n\nChinese yuan is the go-to currency in China. Everywhere accepts cash, from street food vendors to local shops.\n\nCash is super helpful for the little things. You’ll need it to buy snacks at local markets or grab a quick bite from street stalls.\n\nATMs are everywhere in China’s cities, so you can quickly get more cash if you run low.\n\nWith cash, you won’t have to worry about card fraud. But remember to keep your cash safe and don’t flash around large amounts.\n\nWhen converting your home currency to Chinese yuan, keep an eye on the exchange rates. Sometimes, using your card for purchases can give you a better deal.\n\nYou can often use your card for payments in big cities and tourist spots without a hitch.\n\nHaving a mix of cash and cards is a good call for your China trip. Cash for the small stuff and cards for more significant expenses.\n\nHow much cash should I take to China?\n\nIt depends on your travel plans and preferences, but here’s a friendly guide to help you out.\n\nStart with some local currency. Having a bit of Chinese yuan (CNY) in your pocket is a good idea right from the get-go. Consider bringing around 500-1,000 CNY for immediate expenses like transportation, snacks, and small purchases upon arrival.\n\nKeep a backup. While cards are widely accepted in urban areas, having some cash on hand is smart. Especially for more remote locations where card payments may not be possible. Another 500-1,000 CNY as a backup should do the trick.\n\nATM access: Remember that ATMs are widely available in Chinese cities. You can withdraw more cash as needed during your trip. Ensure your card is okay for international withdrawals, and check with your bank about any fees.\n\nSouvenirs and bargains: Plan on shopping for souvenirs or love a good haggle in local markets? Then, having extra cash can come in handy. An additional 500-1,000 CNY should cover you for those spontaneous shopping sprees.\n\nDaily budget: Think about your daily budget and how much you’ll spend on activities, food, and entertainment. This can help you gauge how much cash you’ll need for your stay.\n\nRemember, having a little extra cash is always better than running out. Don’t hesitate to carry more if you’re unsure. And, of course, keep your money safe and secure while you explore the wonders of China!\n\nHow does tipping work in China?\n\nTipping in China is different compared to in Western countries. Here’s a guide to tipping etiquette in China:\n\nNo obligation: Tipping is not common in China, and there’s no obligation to tip in most situations.\n\nService charges: Some upscale places add a service charge (around 10%) to the bill. You don’t need to tip extra.\n\nTour guides and drivers: Tipping tour guides and drivers is customary on guided tours. Around 50-100 CNY per day per person for guides and 20-50 CNY per day per person for drivers is common.\n\nPorters: You can tip hotel porters 5-10 CNY per bag.\n\nTaxi drivers: Tipping is not necessary for taxi drivers; rounding up the fare is convenient.\n\nSmall gifts: Instead of cash, consider offering small gifts from your home country as a token of appreciation.\n\nLanguage barrier: Carry small denominations of Chinese yuan (CNY) for easier transactions.\n\nTipping isn’t the norm in China, but polite gestures and a friendly attitude are always appreciated.\n\nIs China a cheap country to visit?\n\nAbsolutely! China offers excellent value for travellers. Here’s the lowdown:\n\nAccommodation\n\nYou’ll find various accommodation options that won’t break the bank. From budget-friendly hostels to mid-range hotels, even upscale properties in China are often more affordable than their Western counterparts.\n\nFood\n\nDining in China is budget-friendly, especially at local eateries and street food stalls. Enjoy delicious traditional dishes like dumplings, noodles, and stir-fries without denting your wallet.\n\nTransportation\n\nPublic transportation, including buses and subways, is cost-effective and efficient, making it easy to explore cities and towns. Planning on covering long distances? Domestic flights within China are also relatively affordable.\n\nSightseeing\n\nEntrance fees to attractions, historical sites, and museums are typically budget-friendly.

Prices are generally reasonable, offering unique items to take home as souvenirs.\n\nChina is a budget-conscious traveller’s dream, ensuring a fantastic experience without straining your wallet.\n\nChinese currency\n\nBanknotes in China\n\nChinese yuan banknotes are available in several denominations. Including 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 CNY notes, each with distinct colours and designs.\n\nThe front of most yuan banknotes features a portrait of Mao Zedong, a significant figure in Chinese history. The designs may vary slightly across denominations.\n\nYuan banknotes often depict symbols of China’s rich history and culture, such as landmarks, landscapes, and historical events.\n\nChinese yuan banknotes incorporate watermarks, holograms, and security threads to prevent counterfeiting, making them challenging to replicate.\n\nCoins in China\n\nTraditional Perforated Yuan Coins:\n\nThese are the classic Chinese yuan coins that have been in circulation for many years.\n\nThe perforated feature with a square hole in the centre is a distinctive characteristic of these coins.\n\nDenominations for these perforated coins commonly include 1 yuan and 5 yuan.\n\nModern Non-Perforated Yuan Coins:\n\nIn recent years, China has introduced non-perforated yuan coins to modernise its currency.\n\nThese coins do not have a hole in the centre and often feature updated designs.\n\nDenominations for non-perforated coins can include 1 yuan and 5 yuan, as well as smaller denominations like 1 jiao (equivalent to 0.1 yuan) and 5 jiao (equivalent to 0.5 yuan).\n\nThe non-perforated 1 yuan coin typically features a distinct design, such as a pattern of grains, while the 5 yuan coin may showcase various cultural symbols or scenic landscapes.\n\nBoth types of yuan coins are widely accepted for everyday transactions in China.\n\nChina’s yuan currency import and export regulations\n\nImport (Bringing CNY into China):\n\nYou can bring up to CNY 20,000 without declaring.\n\nDeclare amounts exceeding CNY 20,000.\n\nExport (Taking CNY out of China):\n\nYou can take up to CNY 20,000 without declaring.\n\nDeclare amounts exceeding CNY 20,000.\n\nEnsure legal documentation for larger exports.\n\nCheck the destination country’s rules for foreign currency.\n\nNon-compliance may lead to fines or legal actions.
