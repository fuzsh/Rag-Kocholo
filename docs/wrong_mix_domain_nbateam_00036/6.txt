As the Rockets sit in second-to-last place in the Western Conference with a 11-14 record, the team has explored nearly every option, including a rumored deal where they would've dealt a handful of future first-rounders for Jimmy Butler, and after cycling through all 14,000,605 potential trade outcomes, they have reportedly landed on pursuing J.R. Smith. According to Marc Stein of the New York Times, Houston has "expressed exploratory interest" in getting Smith from the Cleveland Cavaliers via trade.

The idea of Smith going to the Rockets signals the organization's level of desperation to address their need for some offensive firepower beyond James Harden and an underperforming Chris Paul. All is not lost for Houston. They are only 2.5 games out of the eighth seed, but in a loaded Western Conference, the team cannot afford to stay pat on their roster, and run the risk of falling down further in the standings.

Getting His Hennyness might only put a band-aid over a much larger problem that has been hurting Houston all season long. Another good three-point shooter will not help a Rockets defensive unit that has been nowhere close to as effective as they were last season.
