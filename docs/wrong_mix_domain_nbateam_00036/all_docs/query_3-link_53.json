        "text": "Former NBA No. 1 draft pick Joe Smith earned $61 million over his 16-year career. Today, he’s living paycheck-to-paycheck and owes $157,000. “A lot of people think once you sign that contract, you’re just an automatic millionaire,” Smith tells former MLB star and businessman Alex Rodriguez on CNBC’s “Back in the Game,” in which Rodriguez helps former pro athletes get back on solid financial footing.\n\nKG: I talked to Russ a couple times about personal s–t—real recognize real—but I respect his talent. I respect his appetite. We have a similar background. We have a similar path, if you will. I played with guys like Steph [Marbury] when we were super best friends, and he left, and that left an immediate mark and impacted me in a certain way that I looked at teammates different after that. The ones that stuck—Malik [Sealy], Sam Mitchell, Joe Smith, Gary Trent, Trenton Hassell, Troy Hudson—those guys became real friends with me after that because of that situation.\n\nAmir got the call after his mom and while excited, spent the next two months in a state of worry. He graduated with a 4.4 GPA and had always put academics first, but he still wondered if he was good enough academically for Rice. On Wednesday, Amir got his official acceptance letter from the admissions office. On Saturday, Bowie and Amir will make the drive once again up 59 towards the Medical Center. This time, though, Bowie won’t be going to a hospital. She won’t be dealing with grief or illness. She will be taking Amir to his dorm room at Rice, where he starts summer classes on June 22.\n\nSmith has the genes for basketball. His dad is Joe Smith, who was the No. 1 NBA draft pick in 1995. Father and son are building their relationship now, but Amir grew up watching basketball clips of his dad on Google and YouTube. While Joe did financially support him, Amir has memories of being with his father in person just a handful of times. Bowie and Joe were in a relationship during his rookie season with Golden State. After their relationship ended shortly after Amir was born, Bowie stayed close with Joe’s family, particularly his mother, who passed away from cancer in 2007. But Joe and Amir were never together. “It was hard to know I had a dad who accomplished all these great things in the sport I love,” Amir said. “But to not be able to just go outside and actually be able to play with him and learn from him. That was tough.”"
