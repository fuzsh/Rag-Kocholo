It’s not just spotting up, or sitting in the corner and relying on jump shots only.\n\nThe defensive versatility that he brings has really impacted our group in a great way. Offensively, he’s finding different ways to get it done. Off ball and spot-up shooting is a huge asset for him, but we want him to post up and find his mid-range shots, where he can rise up over guys.\n\nThe offensive glass [rebounding] has been the biggest improvement in the last month for him. It’s that mentality of going after it every time. He’s starting to make reads and handle [the ball], and make plays for other guys. The goal for everybody is to be well-rounded so that we don’t have to rely on any one person. It’s a true team aspect.\n\nWe see growth from all of our guys, and Jabari has taken a step, as well."
