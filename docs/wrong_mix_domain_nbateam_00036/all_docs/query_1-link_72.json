        "text": "BROOKLYN, N.Y — There was the Jabari Smith before the NBA Draft, then the Jabari Smith immediately after, and then the Jabari Smith who gave himself time to let it all set in.\n\nThirty minutes before he had hoped to be picked No. 1 by the Orlando Magic, a chorus of chants descended on him. He eagerly swiveled his head to find the source as he recognized his name. He grinned widely. In the first row of Barclays Center, three random fans wanted his attention. They wore Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks and Charlotte Hornets jerseys.\n\nNone of those three teams were among the trio contending for Smith — in fact, the way he saw it, only two teams were feasible — but the Auburn phenom seemed thrilled to say hello to anyone who cared enough to ask for it. Perhaps that’s why he was willing to leave his family table in the green room to spend a few minutes with a reporter, even so close to draft time.\n\nIn the final minutes before an NBA career, he was reflecting.\n\n“Sports were always my way to interact with people,” he said. He made friends in grade school by discussing sports, so in middle school he played as many different sports as possible — even the ones he was bad at.\n\nSmith felt fortunate. Soon he would make a living playing his favorite sport.\n\nMoments after he was picked, he walked through the arena tunnel with a hat perched on top of his head, a hat nobody thought he’d be wearing. Himself included. Orlando and Oklahoma City passed on him, leaving him third for the Houston Rockets, a team he didn’t work out with. He had assumed he would be top-two. While reminiscing with friends at an Atlanta Waffle House recently, Smith hypothesized about the Magic and told them how excited he would be for them to visit nearby Orlando.\n\nA Rockets videographer asked to film Smith greeting the Houston community: “What’s up, H-Town?”\n\nThe camera lowered. “Can we try that again, but with a little more emotion?”\n\nThe instant shock was hard to shake. Even if Smith had just become the highest-drafted Auburn player ever. Even if he had exceeded all pre-college expectations by going top-three. Even if he had just assured himself of becoming a millionaire.\n\nLoving sports makes anyone a competitor, after all. One is better than three.\n\n“You just want to hear your name called,” he said, describing the wait. He was shaking in his seat from the jitters.\n\nSmith floated through a gazillion photoshoots. He gave an optimistic press conference, then more photoshoots. And radio calls. And a lot of standing and waiting in between, his head tucked in his phone.\n\nJABARI'S FAVORITE HOOP: Welcome to Crabapple, Jabari Smith's secret sanctuary where he developed into star NBA prospect\n\nHISTORIC OUTSIDE SHOOTING: Why should Auburn basketball's Jabari Smith be No. 1 pick in 2022 NBA Draft? Start with this stat\n\nSlowly he regained his usual upbeat demeanor, the one that endeared himself to coach Bruce Pearl and Auburn teammates.\n\nHasn’t Smith always played best when he has reason to snarl anyway?\n\n“I definitely can bring some anger out of this,” he said as he strolled down a hallway. “But right now, I want to be positive.”\n\nThat’s Smith’s natural setting. It’s the wiring that made him join that middle school football team.\n\n“I think he did it just to have something to do,” his mom, Taneskia Purnell said.\n\nSmith describes it as “my second love.” He loved it enough to be a one-man locker room cleanup crew.\n\nYou've heard of player/coaches. Before Smith was an NBA lottery pick, he was a player/custodian.\n\n\"He was always the last person out of the locker room,\" Purnell said. \"I asked him, 'Why are you always last?'\"\n\n\"Our coach is real big on keeping the locker room clean,” Jabari would say. He laughed about it on the draft floor. “Coach Ross and Coach Justice, they'd all make us run if the locker room wasn't clean. People leave their stuff out, so I would be like, ‘I'm not going to run.’”\n\nHe was already one of the slowest runners on the track team, after all — another sport he tried for the heck of it.\n\n“He was actually quite slow. But he still liked it,\" Purnell recalled. \"We would still go to the track meet. He would still be running, and they would be getting ready to start the next race, and he’s still coming around.”\n\nSmith was coming around to his new home as he reunited with family under the arena Thursday. He hugged his mom. His dad, a former NBA player, beamed. Soon Jabari will make a living playing his favorite sport.\n\nHis eyes lit up at the thought of Auburn teammate Walker Kessler possibly being Houston’s other first-round pick.\n\n“Do you know if he worked out for Houston?” Smith asked a team employee. “Walker Kessler? Tall white dude?”\n\nHe adjusted his hat. Maybe it could be a good fit after all.\n\n“There’s definitely a chip on my shoulder with how everything played out,” he said. “It’s all going to work out.”\n\nHouston’s first summer league game is against Orlando.\n\nThere’s one unanswered question lingering from an evenly talented draft year.\n\nWhat will the angry Jabari Smith look like on an NBA court?"
