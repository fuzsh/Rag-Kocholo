        "text": "HOUSTON — In a few weeks, when the 16-52 Houston Rockets close the book on their 2022-23 season, they’ll have learned many lessons— some good, others not so good.\n\nFrom the beginning of training camp in September through the middle of March, Houston’s journey has often looked confusing, ill-fitting and sometimes embarrassing. But even as regular season wins evaded them, hope never departed. Hope for a turnaround. Hope for a better tomorrow. Hope for something.\n\nHope can come in various forms, and one is beginning to emerge. The Rockets have won less than 25 percent of their games, but three of those have come against the best teams in the Eastern Conference: Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Boston. While their opponents might regard those as throwaway games within a grueling schedule, the wins mean something internally for a Rockets team that has struggled to get things right for months.\n\n“We’re a work in progress, but when we understand the moment, it’s gratifying as a coach for sure because we’re constantly teaching them. But they need to feel it,” Stephen Silas said following the most recent of those victories: Monday’s 111-109 win over the Celtics. “As much as we can watch film, talk about it, write it on the board, there’s no better teaching method than going through it and finding success at the end.”\n\nSilas wasn’t referring specifically to Jabari Smith Jr. when he used the phrase ‘work in progress’, but it’s not too far from an accurate depiction. Since being drafted third overall last June, Smith had struggled to ingratiate himself on both ends of the floor with his new team. It didn’t make things any easier that the Rockets as a whole were in a rut offensively and defensively, but Smith’s biggest draws leading up to the draft were his elite shooting and his versatile defense — both of which had evaporated.\n\nRecently, however, Smith has turned the page. He rededicated himself to his craft, his mechanics and most importantly, his confidence. Gone were the hesitation and the overthinking. Gone was hanging his head and pointing fingers after a missed read or defensive rotation. Smith decided to just get back to hooping. Those around him will tell you he takes losing hard. He despises it. That mentality is part of the reason why the Rockets brought him in in the first place — a culture reset.\n\nSince the calendar flipped to March, Smith’s game has found a groove. The rookie is averaging 16.6 points and 7.6 rebounds per game, shooting 55.8 percent from the field and 50 percent from three on 4.3 attempts a night. The numbers say one thing, but the games say another. Watching him move on the floor, it’s almost a night and day difference. It’s no surprise the Rockets are 3-4 in the seven games they’ve played this month.\n\n“It’s great,” Silas said. “The way he has bounced back from his rookie wall that he hit earlier, stayed with it and found confidence, everybody in the building sees the confidence that he has on both ends of the floor. He’s not hesitating shooting the basketball. Before, he was shot faking and driving or turning down shots. He’s not turning them down anymore.”\n\nStarting center Alperen Şengün was ruled out during pregame warmups, which dealt an obvious blow to Silas and the coaching staff, but also gave way to one of the weapons in his back pocket — going small and using Smith as the lone big. It’s something that was first introduced by assistant Rick Higgins with the Summer League group in Vegas during the offseason, a move then that was also born out of necessity.\n\nPrior to Monday’s game, Smith talked about not having a lot of experience playing center in college due to the presence of former teammate and current Utah Jazz big Walker Kessler. But he fully understood the intrigue surrounding small ball and his role within it.\n\n“As I get stronger I feel like that’s where my advantage will be,” Smith said. “That’s where I’ll be the biggest mismatch for other (centers) in the league. Just keep learning and playing that position.”\n\nOffensively, deploying Smith at center opens things up considerably for the other players sharing the floor with him. In Tari Eason and Jae’Sean Tate, the Rockets have two wings who can hit outside shots, but aren’t considered long-range threats by Houston’s opponents. Tate is capable of handling some of the playmaking duties in Şengün’s absence, and like Şengün, he prefers to operate inside the restricted area. Eason is cut from the same cloth.\n\nSmith’s rediscovered shooting stroke also makes things easier for the likes of Jalen Green and Kevin Porter Jr., two guards who are able to drive, draw defenses in and kick it to the perimeter. The Rockets are a poor outside shooting team as is, but Smith’s uptick in his form has created better spacing and suddenly made things easier for Houston’s offense, even if it comes in short spurts. A well-oiled machine like the Celtics might think they could get away with cheating off Smith in the corner to key in on Porter, but Smith isn’t shooting below 30 percent anymore.\n\nUsing Smith as a center doesn’t only serve him, it gives everyone else more room to operate. Each Celtics player on the floor either has a foot in the paint or is one step away from it. Porter loves driving to his left and shifting to his right and knows how to zip a pass out of it, with his 13 assists against the Celtics serving as a testament. Watch Smith and Green’s movement when Porter drives. There’s an understanding there: as Smith moves down, so does Green, opening two options. Sometimes, simplifying basketball for young teams can actually be beneficial.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, it’s a completely different story. As difficult as it might be to see because of Houston’s record, they want to be a strong defensive unit. That strength comes from versatility and being able to weaponize different schemes when necessary. With Green, Porter, Martin, Eason, Tate, Smith and Usman Garuba, the Rockets don’t have to play in a drop defense or stick to their individual assignments. They can opt to switch ball screens and keep things in front of them. All seven players are between 6-foot-4 and 6-foot-11 with lengthy wingspans. The overall experience isn’t there yet, but these are the games where valuable lessons are learned.\n\nOf the players on the floor, it’s Smith who has the highest ceiling for a quality defensive stopper. He has the length to disrupt actions on the perimeter and the lateral quickness to keep up with smaller players. He’ll need to improve his physicality if he’s going to play longer, more important stretches at center but he’s still a solid rebounder for his position and isn’t lacking in effort. Smith becoming more of a nuisance makes Houston’s defense better and faster.\n\n“Defensively, we’re more active,” Kenyon Martin Jr. told The Athletic. “When Şengün is in, he’s usually staying on his man and we’re in drop but going small and switching one through five, it’s quicker. Guys can switch out and get to the ball. Miss or make, we get the ball out fast and we’re all the same size so we can all get up the court quicker. That’s why it’s fun.”\n\n“Our switchability helped us tonight,” Silas added. “We were able to stay body on body and not help as much. When we don’t have to help as much, we’re a better defensive team so it was good.”\n\nFrom the notebook\n\n• Green’s development from Year 1 to Year 2 hasn’t been as smooth as might have been expected, but since returning from injury in late February, he’s looked more like the player the Rockets see turning into a star. The second-year guard is averaging 21.0 points and shooting 37.8 percent from three on nearly seven attempts per game. More importantly, he’s becoming a smarter player as the season nears its end.\n\nAs a rookie, Green’s talent was obvious but his on-court processor wasn’t where it needed to be yet, understandable given his lack of NBA experience. At times, he tried to do too much or make simple things infinitely more difficult. But in his second season, things are slowing down for him. Green knows he’s at the top of every scouting report when it comes to defending the Rockets and understands the treatment that comes with it: The traps, the doubles, the kitchen sink.\n\nDeveloping on the ball is one thing. Becoming dangerous off it is how Green can take his game to a different ecosystem. Watching in real time, I was racking my brain trying to find another player with the athleticism to give up the ball after a trap, outrun the trap, receive the ball going downhill and finish at the rim with contact, all in three seconds. The recognition and execution of plays like this separate the good from the great. More of this, please. (Garuba’s no-look between the legs dime was a thing of beauty, by the way.)\n\n“The attention that he’s getting with the double teams, there are games where he’s good with it and where he can be better with it,” Silas said. “We just want Jalen to make the right plays and he generally does that.”\n\n(Top photo of Tari Eason, Kevin Porter Jr. and Jabari Smith Jr.: Thomas Shea / USA Today)"
