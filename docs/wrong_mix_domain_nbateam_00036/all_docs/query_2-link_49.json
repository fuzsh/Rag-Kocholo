        "text": "Jabari Smith Jr. News\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Suspended For Monday's Game\n\nHouston Rockets forward/center Jabari Smith Jr. will miss Monday's game against Portland with a suspension. He was handed a one-game suspension for his altercation with Utah's Kris Dunn on Saturday. Smith Jr's absence will be a major blow for the playoff-chasing Rockets, who have racked up eight consecutive victories. Following Alperen Sengun's (ankle) injury, Smith Jr. has filled the starting center role. With him now sidelined, Jeff Green and Jock Landale should share the minutes at the five positions. Green is the more attractive fantasy option of the two and played great after Smith Jr.'s early exit at the weekend, scoring 21 points and registering four rebounds with a pair of blocks. A meeting with Portland could also be fruitful for him, as the Trail Blazers are allowing opposing centers to shoot 60.6 percent from the field.\n\nMar 25\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Good To Go Wednesday\n\nHouston Rockets forward/center Jabari Smith Jr. (illness) will play on Wednesday against the Clippers. The talented Auburn product has been battling an illness and initially landed on the injury report with a questionable tag, but he has been upgraded to available. However, how effective Smith Jr. can be remains to be seen. He already struggled to perform in Tuesday's matchup against San Antonio, recording only two points and three rebounds in 25 minutes. Wednesday's matchup is also a tough one for Smith Jr. and the Rockets, as the Clippers have developed into a very good defensive team.\n\nMar 6\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Will Return On Monday\n\nHouston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. (ankle) did not appear on the injury report for their game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night. The 20-year-old has missed the last four consecutive games due to an ankle sprain, but it seems like he has fully healed now that he doesn't carry an injury designation at all. He should re-enter his role in the starting lineup and can be started in fantasy leagues regardless of size or format. He's made some improvements in traditional stat categories along with his efficiency so far this year. Smith averages 13.7 points, 8.7 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.7 threes made, and 1.2 turnovers per game while shooting 47.4% from the floor.\n\nJan 29\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Out Again On Saturday\n\nHouston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. (ankle) won't suit up for Saturday's game against the Brooklyn Nets. He'll now be sidelined for a fourth consecutive contest, so his next chance to return will be on Monday versus the visiting Los Angeles Lakers. The 20-year-old is averaging a career-high 13.7 points this season, meaning there will be extra scoring chances up for grabs, which Jalen Green and Fred VanVleet could mostly absorb. At the same time, Jeff Green may remain in the starting lineup, although he's a hit-or-miss fantasy option.\n\nJan 27\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Receives Another Questionable Tag On Friday\n\nHouston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. (ankle) is back on the injury report after initially being removed when it first came out. The second-year forward is still dealing with some lingering effects of the ankle sprain that he suffered a few games back. The fact that he popped up on the report later than normal as questionable isn't the best sign for his chances to play against the Charlotte Hornets. If he has to remain sidelined for a third consecutive game, Jeff Green would likely remain in the starting five while Amen Thompson, Cam Whitmore, and Jock Landale would all see some more minutes coming off of the bench. If Smith plays, however, Landale and Whitmore wouldn't be great starts in this contest.\n\nJan 26\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Off Fridayâ€™s Injury Report\n\nHouston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. (ankle) is not spotted on the team's injury report ahead of Friday's matchup with the Charlotte Hornets. Out for back-to-back games due to a sprained left ankle, Smith is cleared to return against the Hornets on Friday. The 2022 first-rounder is bringing in top-100 fantasy numbers in his second season with the Rockets, tallying 13.7 points, 8.7 rebounds, 1.7 treys, and 0.8 blocks per game. Jeff Green will slide back to Houston's second unit to free up Smith's starting spot.\n\nJan 25\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Ruled Out On Sunday\n\nHouston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. (ankle) won't play on Sunday against the Boston Celtics. The 20-year-old logged 41 minutes in Saturday's overtime win over the Utah Jazz, finishing with 24 points and 10 rebounds. However, Smith tweaked his left ankle during the extra quarter, although he downplayed the severity of the ailment. At any rate, it's possible the Rockets could be without him for at least a few more games. Houston also won't have Fred VanVleet, so Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, and Alperen Sengun could benefit significantly on the scoring end. In addition, Aaron Holiday and Jae'Sean Tate could see more streaming interest from fantasy managers, considering both men will likely enter the starting lineup versus Boston.\n\nJan 21\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Considered Questionable Monday\n\nHouston Rockets forward/center Jabari Smith Jr. (ankle) is listed as questionable ahead of Monday's meeting with Detroit. Smith Jr. missed his first game of the season Friday versus Philadelphia due to a left ankle sprain. It looks like his absence could be limited to only one game, but it's not fully certain Smith Jr. can return against Detroit. With Dillon Brooks (oblique) also sidelined, Jae'Sean Tate and Jeff Green have jumped into the starting unit. They could be in line for even more extra work on Monday, as Tari Eason (leg) is also questionable for the contest.\n\nJan 1\n\nJabari Smith Jr. Ruled Out Against 76ers\n\nHouston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. (ankle) suffered a left ankle sprain in the third quarter during their Wednesday night game against the Phoenix Suns. He'll now miss at least one game as he was ruled out of their Friday night matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers. This will be his first missed game of the season, but it's unknown whether or not he'll have to miss more time. Smith has seen a boost in fantasy value since last year. He currently ranks 73rd in nine-category value compared to 144th last season while he averages more points, threes, rebounds, assists, and steals. As he sits this game out, Jae'Sean Tate will get more playing time and Tari Eason (leg) could move into the starting lineup if he plays.\n\nDec 29"
