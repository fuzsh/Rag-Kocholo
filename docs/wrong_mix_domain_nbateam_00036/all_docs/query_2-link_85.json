        "text": "Smith closed Thursday's 133-110 loss to the Warriors with 24 points (8-17 FG, 4-10 3Pt, 4-4 FT), three rebounds and two assists across 32 minutes.\n\nJalen Green had a rough night offensively Thursday, but Smith stepped his game up and notched a team-high 24 points -- his fifth straight game with 15-plus points and the second time he surpassed the 20-point plateau in that stretch. The second-year forward has scored at least 15 points in nine of his last 11 appearances, and he's settling in quite well as a reliable go-to scoring option for the Rockets in the post, especially with Alperen Sengun (ankle) still sidelined.\n\nSmith notched 18 points (7-14 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT), eight rebounds and three assists across 36 minutes during Tuesday's 113-106 loss to Minnesota.\n\nSmith flirted with a double-double for the second consecutive game, and while he came short of reaching that feat again, he posted a solid stat line due to his overall contributions. Smith has topped the 15-point mark in his last four games following a one-game absence due to a suspension, averaging 19.0 points, 5.8 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.0 blocks per game in that span.\n\nSmith posted 28 points (9-14 FG, 5-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT), seven rebounds, two assists and three blocks across 36 minutes during Sunday's 125-107 loss to the Mavericks.\n\nThe Rockets had a rough showing as their 11-game winning streak came to an end, but Smith was one of the few bright spots. In 14 March appearances, Smith posted averages of 14.1 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 0.9 blocks, 0.9 steals and 2.1 three-pointers.\n\nSmith (suspension) is in the starting five for Wednesday's game versus the Thunder.\n\nAfter missing Houston's previous contest due to a suspension, Smith will replace Jock Landale in the starting lineup Wednesday. Smith is averaging 12.5 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 28.0 minutes across his lat 10 appearances.\n\nThe NBA announced Sunday that Smith has received a one-game suspension due to his involvement in an altercation in the second quarter of Saturday's 147-119 win over the Jazz.\n\nSmith will serve the ban during Monday's game against the Trail Blazers. The second-year big man was on the receiving end of a punch from Utah's Kris Dunn with 11:55 remaining in the second quarter, and both players were assessed technical fouls and ejected from the game. Because he was deemed to have initiated the altercation, Dunn received a two-game suspension to Smith's one. While Smith is out Monday, Jeff Green and Jock Landale should absorb most of the minutes at center.\n\nSmith was ejected during the first half of Saturday's matchup against the Jazz after engaging in an altercation with Kris Dunn, Tony Jones of The Athletic reports.\n\nSmith was ejected after engaging in a shoving battle with Dunn, though the circumstances of the altercation were not clear. Smith exits the game having posted five points (2-3 FG, 1-1 FT), two rebounds and two assists across nine minutes. Smith should remain in the starting unit when the Rockets take on the Trail Blazers on Monday.\n\nSmith amassed 20 points (8-13 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT), seven rebounds, two assists, three blocks and one steal across 32 minutes during Saturday's 117-103 win over the Cavaliers.\n\nSmith registered three blocks Saturday for the second time this season as he adjusts to his starting role at center with Alperen Sengun (ankle) sidelined indefinitely. It was the first time since Feb. 25 that Smith tallied 20-plus points in a game as he finished Saturday's contest as the second-leading scorer behind Jalen Green. Since the All-Star break, Smith is averaging 14.7 points, 9.0 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.1 steals over 33.5 minutes per game.\n\nCoach Ime Udoka said Tuesday that Smith will start at center in Alperen Sengun's (ankle/knee) absence, Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle reports.\n\nSmith has started at power forward next to Sengun in all 59 of his appearances this season. However, at 6-foot-11, Smith can provide size on the interior. He is averaging 0.8 blocks per game in 2023-24.\n\nSmith registered 15 points (5-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT), nine rebounds, one assist and two steals over 33 minutes during Tuesday's 103-101 victory over San Antonio.\n\nSmith got the nod as the starting center Tuesday, replacing Alperen Sengun who is likely to miss the remainder of the season with multiple knee and ankle injuries. While the move to center is not set in stone for Smith, it will likely give him a small bump in production, especially on the defensive end. Assuming he stays healthy, Smith could end up being a valuable piece on a lot of winning fantasy teams.\n\nSmith contributed 10 points (3-10 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT), 11 rebounds, two assists and three steals over 34 minutes during Sunday's 112-104 victory over the Kings.\n\nSmith didn't have a good shooting performance and was erratic on offense, but he salvaged his fantasy stat line by grabbing 11 rebounds and adding three steals to the cause, proving he can be a disruptive presence on the defensive end. Smith needs to be better offensively, as he's failed to surpass the 15-point mark in six of his last 10 games. During that 10-game stretch, the second-year forward has averaged 14.0 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.1 steals per game.\n\nSmith contributed 19 points (6-11 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 3-4 FT), two rebounds, one assist and two blocks across 29 minutes during Wednesday's 122-116 loss to the Clippers.\n\nSmith took the court Wednesday despite entering the contest questionable due to illness, going on to lead all Houston players in threes made while ending one point shy of the 20-point mark in a losing effort. Smith matched a season-high total in threes made, a feat he has now accomplished six times. He has recorded at least 19 points in 12 outings, including in four of his last 10 contests."
