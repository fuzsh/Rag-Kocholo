        "text": "For Jabari Smith Jr., the No. 3 draft pick of the 2022 first round by the Houston Rockets, his rookie season of 2022-23 wasn’t all he envisioned. While Smith did earn All-Rookie second-team honors, the projected sharpshooter out of Auburn made 40.8% of his overall shots and 30.7% from 3-point range.\n\nOne plausible reason for that is a lack of strength. At 6-foot-11, 213 pounds, Smith is one of the NBA’s lightest power forwards, and it’s conceivable the physical toll of playing against bigger and stronger players might have taken a toll on a number of fronts.\n\nNow, as the 20-year-old enters his second year under new head coach Ime Udoka, Smith seems to be prioritizing physical development.\n\nOn a new episode of “The Bradeaux & Will Show,” Smith was asked about his offseason points of emphasis. He responded:\n\nI feel like it’s just been strength. With strength, that helps you with being able to put the ball on the floor, being able to take bumps, having to move and change directions.\n\nPlaying stronger and playing lower to the ground. I just feel like there wasn’t one thing that I was focused on, except for my body.\n\nGetting stronger and just precise movements. I don’t think I was weak last year, I just need to throw my body around a little more and take bumps.\n\nThat new and improved body was on full display during Smith’s brilliant stint (albeit an abbreviated one) at the NBA’s 2023 summer league. In two games with the summer Rockets — both wins — Smith averaged 35.5 points (48.8% FG, 33.3% on 3-pointers), 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 32.2 minutes per game.\n\nThe complete podcast interview can be listened to below."
