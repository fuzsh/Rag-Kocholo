        "text": "JR Smith made quite the news when he joined college again and started playing golf. Following a successful NBA career, the basketball icon was ready to explore another page of his life. However, judging by LeBron James’ reaction, Smith seems to be doing brilliantly in golf.\n\nThe 36-year-old has been dedicating his time to the new game, often sharing his progress with fans. Many have previously praised Smith for the same, impressed with how he has chosen to move forward.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nJames, who has played with Smith before, was all praises for the former NBA player.\n\nLeBron James praises JR Smith for winning Player of the Year\n\nSmith, who is studying at North Carolina A&T, has apparently made it through the year with a 4.0 GPA. If that was not enough, they have named him the Academic Athlete of the Year, clearly a result of his grades and performance in golf.\n\nREAD MORE: NBA Twitter Clowns Kevin Durant for Trash Talking Jayson Tatum’s Celtics During Olympics\n\nJames seemed proud of Smith. He took to Twitter and wrote, “YESSIR @TheRealJRSmith!! Proud of you Kid!!! Love bro.”\n\nSmith and James played together for four years with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the highlight being their 2016 Championship run. James ended up moving to Los Angeles Lakers afterward, while Smith stuck with the Cavaliers for a few more years. However, Smith’s last year in the NBA was with the Lakers, when they won their championship in 2020 at the Orlando bubble.\n\nWhy did Smith choose golf?\n\nThough it has brought him success now, Smith’s decision to pick up another game while in his 30s was certainly surprising. While many were happy about him going back to complete his education, not many expected a switch as a player.\n\n“Golf is one of those games that has you feeling really high and or can bring you down to your knees and humble you,” said Smith.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHe has previously attended PGA Tour events and wanted to join AT&T due to their liberal studies programs. “I’ve always been told that I can go further my education after going pro ball since I came out of high school. If I’m able to, it’s going to be a dream come true.”\n\nWATCH THIS STORY: Is Shaquille ONeals Ex-Wife Shaunie Married to Someone else now?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWith the way things have shaped up, one can only hope for Smith to progress more and achieve more at AT&T. James’ support for Smith seems to be constant, and will stay so even later on.\n\nWhat is your favorite James-Smith interaction? Let us know in the comments below."
