The event takes place at Indianapolis’ Gainbridge Fieldhouse as part of the league’s 2024 All-Star Weekend.\n\nThe annual showcase of young talent, featuring a mini-tournament with four teams and three games, airs live at 8 p.m. Central on TNT.\n\nFor the Houston Rockets, Jabari Smith Jr. is the lone representative.

The 6-foot-11 forward was drafted third overall in 2022.\n\nRookies Amen Thompson and Cam Whitmore have played increasingly well in recent weeks, but the Rising Stars vote took place at an earlier point in the season.
