        "text": "Tim Warner/Getty Images\n\nUtah Jazz guard Kris Dunn has been suspended two games without pay for initiating an altercation and throwing a punch in a fight with Houston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr., the league announced Sunday.\n\nSmith has been suspended one game for the fight.\n\nDunn's suspension will begin on Monday as the Jazz take on the Dallas Mavericks and he will miss the following game against the San Antonio Spurs. Smith will miss the Rockets' matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nThe scuffle occurred early in the second quarter after the two got physical at the top of the key as the Rockets brought the ball up the court. Dunn threw the first punch aimed at Smith and Smith returned with one of his own, though neither of their punches landed. After teammates and officials broke up the fight, both players were ejected.\n\n\"For me, I take responsibility for my actions and whatever the league decides for me, I have to respect that,\" Dunn said, per ESPN.\n\nSmith, a second-year player out of Auburn, is averaging 13.3 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. The Rockets sit in 11th place in the Western Conference at 35-35 and are fighting for a spot in the play-in tournament. Having a key starter out will make that quest more difficult during a time when every game counts.\n\nDunn is putting up 5.3 points and 3.9 assists per game off the bench for Utah and has been a valuable defender, notching a steal per game. The Jazz sit behind the Rockets in 12th place in the West.\n\nDunn's first game back from suspension will be against the Smith and the Rockets in a matchup that both teams hope will be a little friendlier this time around."
