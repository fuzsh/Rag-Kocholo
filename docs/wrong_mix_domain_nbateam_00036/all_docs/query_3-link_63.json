        "text": "There was a time when Isaiah Thomas was one of the most exciting players in the NBA. His story helped to make him a wonderful player to root for as well. He was able to succeed despite standing at just five-foot-nine. He was the last pick (60th overall) in the 2011 NBA Draft. Put those two things together, and the odds are clearly against a player making an impact in the NBA.\n\nNow 35 years old, Thomas was able to do so. Unfortunately for him, his rapid ascent to NBA stardom came crashing down. Now he’s become somewhat of an afterthought, and Thomas has barely held on to an NBA career.\n\nThomas, who is currently unsigned, remains hopeful that his NBA tenure can continue.\n\nFormer MVP Candidate Wants To Play 1-2 More Years\n\nIsaiah Thomas Wants 1-2 More NBA Seasons\n\nSpeaking with Cassidy Hubbarth of ESPN during the NBA Summer League, Thomas expressed that he wants to play ‘a year or two more’ in the league.\n\nThe way the past few seasons have went Thomas needs to prove to potential suitors that he still is deserving of a roster spot, even if it’s at the end of the bench. Four seasons have passed since he received regular playing time in the league. In 2019-20, he appeared in 40 games (37 starts) for the Washington Wizards. That season, Thomas would average 12.2 points and 3.7 assists in 23.1 minutes.\n\nSince that season, Thomas has been hopping from team to team, or just not rostered by anyone. He didn’t sign until April in the 2020-21 season. On a 10-day contract, Thomas played just three games for the New Orleans Pelicans. He played 22 total games in 2021-22 for the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks, and Charlotte Hornets. Thomas did not get signed by anyone in the 2022-23 season.\n\nLast season, Thomas joined the Salt Lake City Stars of the G League in March. After four productive games with them (averages of 32.5 points and 5.3 assists), the Phoenix Suns signed him to a 10-day deal. He played six games for 19 minutes with them totaling eight points and three assists.\n\n2016-17 Was A Magical Season For The Point Guard\n\nIt has been over seven years since fans got to witness the apex of Thomas’ NBA career. The previous season in 2015-16, he was named to his first All-Star team. He took it a step further in 2016-17.\n\nThat season, Thomas finished fifth in MVP voting and made the All-NBA Second Team. His 28.9 scoring average was third-best in the league. Thomas was clearly the top player on a Boston Celtics team that went 53-29, best in the Eastern Conference.\n\nUnfortunately, Thomas sustained a hip injury in the Eastern Conference Finals. He missed the last three games of the series which saw the Celtics eliminated by the Cleveland Cavaliers. During the offseason, Thomas was traded to Cleveland in a deal that brought Kyrie Irving to Boston. Thomas would not play for the Cavaliers until January of 2018.\n\nIt has been a wild whirlwind of a career for Thomas. For the amount of things he has had to overcome, it is no surprise that he is not giving up on continuing an NBA career."
