        "text": "A TRADITION UNLIKE ANY OTHER\n\nWelcome back, folks, to the annual NBA Summer League Viewer’s TV Guide. Each year at No Ceilings, this has been one of my favorite pieces to assemble.\n\nSummer League is heaven for basketball fans. If you haven’t traveled to Las Vegas for basketball paradise, I would recommend making it a mandatory vacation on a yearly basis. There’s plenty of excitement each year when it comes to Summer League. We look to this event to fill the void of not having NBA basketball in our daily lives. It’s also the first opportunity to get a look at the incoming crop of rookies from the recent NBA Draft class.\n\nBUT. That’s not the only thing we should be keeping an eye on. There are also plenty of names who are looking to take the next step in their development. Personally, I’m always more intrigued to see the “sophomores” at Summer League. In so many words, let’s see who has been grinding in the lab on their games.\n\nIf you are reading the TV Guide for the first time, let me catch you up to speed. Below is EVERY roster that has been officially announced for EVERY NBA team at Summer League. You’ll see some breakdowns when it comes to each team’s rookies, as well as some “notables” which includes players to keep an eye on moving forward. I’ve also pointed out one player who deserves some special attention this year.\n\nAND FOR THE FIRST TIME, A BONUS SECTION spotlighting the “Too Good For Summer League” candidates.\n\nAll rosters mentioned are from the social media accounts of the NBA teams.\n\nWelcome to the 2024 NBA Summer League TV Guide.\n\nATLANTA HAWKS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nZaccharie Risacher (1st)\n\nNikola Djurisic (43rd)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nKobe Bufkin\n\nMouhamed Gueye\n\nDylan Windler\n\nEJ Liddell\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Kobe Bufkin\n\nSUMMARY: As always, the Atlanta Hawks kick off our Summer League preview and should have plenty of names that intrigue fans moving forward. The main attraction will be, of course, the #1 pick from the 2024 NBA Draft. Zaccharie Risacher had one of the biggest swings in terms of draft stock throughout the 2024 cycle. Playing for JL Bourg, Risacher took tremendous strides forward with his development. The recently turned 19-year-old will draw plenty of intrigue, especially when it comes to his outside shooting. Risacher will be one of the top names to watch, as it will be interesting to see how quickly he can adjust to the NBA game.\n\nAnother international name to keep an eye on is Serbian-born wing Nikola Djurisic. A high-feel wing with good size, Djurisic has been a name that has been buzzing in NBA circles over the last couple of years. The biggest thing holding Djurisic back was his outside shot; however, that looked to catch fire in the second half of the season. If the outside shot is legit, Djurisic has the tools to be a high-level NBA talent, especially given his playmaking and tremendous feel on the court.\n\nKeep a close eye on second-year guard Kobe Bufkin, who was selected 15th overall in the 2023 NBA draft. Bufkin missed some time with injuries before returning and turning some heads with his play towards the end of the season in the G League. In 14 games with the College Park Skyhawks, Bufkin averaged 23.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.4 steals per game while shooting 35.6% from downtown. With Dejounte Murray being traded, Bufkin could be in line for some extended minutes this year and will be a potential sophomore breakout candidate to monitor. Bufkin has the tools to be a strong backcourt mate with superstar Trae Young, given his versatility and defensive upside. He should be at the top of your lists for players to watch closely this year at Summer League.\n\n**UPDATE** Kobe Bufkin suffered a shoulder injury during a practice last week and is missing Summer League. This is the absolute worst.\n\nMouhamed Gueye will be an interesting sleeper to monitor. Gueye has some fantastic tools as a big man and could be an intriguing name to monitor. Gueye dealt with numerous injuries throughout his rookie year and only managed to play four games in the G League last year. The former 39th pick in the 2023 NBA Draft has the upside to make him a fun talent to groom, and a strong Summer League showing could do wonders for his development.\n\nEJ Liddell was a late addition to the Atlanta Hawks roster and I’m still intrigued to see if another team could be just what Liddell needs to stick at the next level. He was a former 41st overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft who had battled some injuries over the years. Liddell has spent most of his career in the G League. He averaged 17.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks last year for the Birmingham Squadron and could be a fun sleeper to monitor in Las Vegas.\n\nBOSTON CELTICS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nBaylor Scheierman (30th)\n\nAnton Watson (54th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJordan Walsh\n\nJaden Springer\n\nDrew Peterson\n\nNeemias Queta\n\nRon Harper Jr\n\nJD Davison\n\nJaelen House\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Jordan Walsh\n\nSUMMARY: The Boston Celtics are coming off a world championship and look to be running it back with the majority of their roster under contract for the foreseeable future. However, that doesn’t mean that the Celtics don’t have some intriguing young pieces who could be looking to hopefully earn some minutes in the rotation. Boston found a fantastic piece with the 30th selection of this year’s draft in Baylor Scheierman, who became the first offical first round selection for Brad Stevens.\n\nScheierman has the potential to be a sensational fit for this Celtics team. The former Creighton wing is a versatile piece on the offensive side of the ball that can get hot in a hurry from beyond NBA range. Scheierman is relentless offensively, especially when it comes to his ability on the boards. There’s a chance that the versatile wing could carve out a role on this Celtics roster in the rotation early, given his tools and floor spacing upside.\n\nThe other name to keep an eye on is second-year wing Jordan Walsh. After the Celtics traded back multiple times in the 2023 NBA Draft, Boston selected Walsh with the 38th pick. Walsh showed plenty of impressive flashes throughout his rookie year in the G League, averaging 14.7 points and 7.5 rebounds while shooting 36.1% from three-point range. Still just 20 years old, Walsh will be a name to watch out for to see his growth after a full offseason. Given his unique defensive potential, Walsh could be an intriguing talent for the Celtics moving forward as a potential defensive asset, especially if the outside shot continues to trend in the right direction.\n\nBoston also has plenty of “familiar faces” that deserve some spotlight this Summer. Jaden Springer is always going to be one to watch out for, as he has the defensive tools to be a legit asset for a team like the Celtics, especially if the offense side of the ball can progress. Neemias Queta has become an important big man depth piece for the Celtics and has reportedly signed an extension with the team. Drew Peterson was brought on board last year as a two-way and has the offensive versatility to throw him in as a potential sleeper. Keep an eye on undrafted free agent Tristan Enaruna as well. He’s coming off an impressive season for Cleveland State and has some serious tools. With a strong showing, Enaruna could be a legit name to watch out for as a down the road developmental piece for the organization.\n\nSome super sleepers to monitor include Jaelen House and JD Davison. House, the son of former NBA veteran Eddie House, was an electric scorer last year for New Mexico. Davison has continued to be a two-way contract piece for the Celtics and should have plenty of opportunity to show that he’s worth earning a roster spot.\n\nBROOKLYN NETS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nNone\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nNoah Clowney\n\nDariq Whitehead\n\nJalen Wilson\n\nZylan Cheatham\n\nKeon Johnson\n\nKJ Jones II\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Noah Clowney\n\nSUMMARY: The Brooklyn Nets are fully in on the rebuild after trading away star wing Mikal Bridges. That means it will be an interesting upcoming season for the development of plenty of young pieces on the roster. Brooklyn didn’t have a 2024 NBA Draft selection this year, but the team invested plenty of 2023 NBA Draft capital in some intriguing talents who could be poised for extended minutes this year.\n\nOne of the main attractions will be forward Noah Clowney. Clowney, still just 19 years old, was the 21st pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and spent the majority of his rookie season in the G League with the Long Island Nets. In 34 games in the G League, Clowney averaged 15.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.8 blocks per game while also shooting 32.1% from deep. It’ll be a big opportunity for Clowney this year to hopefully get some extended minutes with the Nets.\n\nThe name to watch closely is second-year wing Dariq Whitehead. A former top recruit out of high school, Whitehead dealt with injuries throughout his freshman season at Duke. It resulted in Whitehead sliding to 22nd in the 2023 NBA Draft before the Nets invested in the long-term upside of the young wing. The 19-year-old wing got some run in the G League after recovering from a previous injury, averaging 8.8 points per game in 18.5 minutes for the Long Island Nets. Now with a full offseason, it will be interesting to see where Whitehead is at, as the previous healthy version of the talented wing was a special talent.\n\nDon’t forget about Nets 2023 second round pick Jalen Wilson as well. After a productive collegiate career with the Kansas Jayhawks, Wilson put up impressive numbers last year in the G League. He averaged 19.3 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game while shooting 38.0% from three. Wilson spent some time with Brooklyn last year as well, and it will be interesting to see if he’s ready to take another step forward in his development.\n\nKeep an eye on KJ Jones II as a potential sleeper. Jones was a bucket-getting machine at the Division II level for Emmanuel College (GA). If he gets in a groove, he could get fans extremely familiar with his game.\n\nCHARLOTTE HORNETS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nTidjane Salaun (6th)\n\nKJ Simpson (42nd)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nBrandon Miller\n\nNick Smith Jr.\n\nBryce McGowens\n\nJake Stephens\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Tidjane Salaun\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Brandon Miller\n\nSUMMARY: The Charlotte Hornets are starting to look like a team that’s getting on the right path. With new management running the show, the Hornets went out and hired former Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee this offseason as their new head coach. After that, the Hornets shook things up a bit in the 2024 NBA Draft, selecting international forward Tidjane Salaun with the #6 overall selection.\n\nSalaun will be the attention grabber, as NBA fans will want to see why there was so much buzz about Salaun throughout the recent draft cycle. At around 6’10” with a promising frame to mold, Salaun has the foundation you’re looking for in a raw but fascinating two-way player. He’s a high-motor forward who plays every possession with his hair on fire. Salaun has shown some impressive strides with his outside shooting, making him a potential fantastic pick-and-pop weapon moving forward. If the tools can continue to blossom, Salaun should be a fantastic fit for this young Hornets team moving forward.\n\nYes, Brandon Miller is listed on the Summer League roster.\n\nYes, he should most likely find himself at the top of your “Too Good For Summer League” rankings.\n\n“Miller Time” could be short, as the second-year wing could be looking to get some quick run before shutting it down. Miller was sensational throughout his rookie season and most likely would have won Rookie of the Year if it were not for an alien in San Antonio. He’s going to be a player who plenty are expecting to take another leap forward in the upcoming season.\n\nSecond year guard Nick Smith Jr. will be a big name to watch out for at Summer League. After spending some time in the G League during his rookie season, Smith got some run with the big club and showed some promising strides. He is the type of talent who can start to take some nice steps forward in his second Summer League showing.\n\nIt would have been fun to see what second round pick KJ Simpson could have brought to the table in Summer league. It appears as if Simpson is still recovering from a predraft injury and could be sidelined throughout Summer League. Simpson is coming off a sensational season for Colorado and continued to improve each year throughout his collegiate career. Despite being undersized, Simpson plays with a chip on his shoulder and can pack a punch offensively in a number of ways. He’s got the tools to become a nice rotation piece, especially if he can prove himself on the defensive end at the next level.\n\nCHICAGO BULLS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nMatas Buzelis (11th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJulian Phillips\n\nAdama Sanogo\n\nNathan Knight\n\nDereon Seabron\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Matas Buzelis\n\nSUMMARY: Chicago looks to be a team that is slowly but surely trending toward a youth movement. The Bulls seemed destined to fall into an interesting place on draft night, as they could have gone in a number of different directions. That was until G League Ignite forward Matas Buzelis found himself still on the board. For the Bulls, it’s a fantastic swing on a player who has the upside to be one of the top players in this class. Buzelis came into the year as one of the top prospects. The hope was that Buzelis would become a lengthy forward with elite floor spacing ability. Unfortunately, the outside shot never came around on a consistent level. Regardless of the shot, Buzelis continued to take promising strides from a developmental perspective. Given his tools, the upside is fascinating, and Buzelis could be a tremendous value pick if things fall into place.\n\nAfter going undrafted last year, former UConn Huskies big man Adama Sanogo spent the year in the G League for Chicago with the Wind City Bulls. Sanogo had a tremendous year in the G League, averaging 20.4 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game. He’s back with the Bulls this year on a two-way and will be another name to watch out for.\n\nDon’t forget about 2023 second round pick Julian Phillips. The former Tennessee product was a high-upside selection in the 2023 class and showcased plenty of flashes during his rookie year. Phillips averaged 16.9 points per game in nine games while shooting 47.5% from downtown in the G League and won’t turn 21 until November. Phillips has the raw tools to be a strong addition to this organization moving forward and will be a name to keep a close eye on at Summer League.\n\nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nJaylon Tyson (20th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nCraig Porter Jr.\n\nEmoni Bates\n\nDJ Burns\n\nNae’Qwan Tomlin\n\nLuke Travers\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Jaylon Tyson\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Craig Porter Jr.\n\nSUMMARY: The Cleveland Cavaliers are having themselves an interesting offseason. The Cavaliers went out and hired Kenny Atkinson as their new head coach, before agreeing to an extension with superstar Donovan Mitchell. That means that for now, the Cavaliers are looking to run things back with the core of their foundation. There are plenty of intriguing names to keep an eye on for this Cavaliers Summer League team, especially as Cleveland looks to bolster their rotation.\n\nCalifornia guard Jaylon Tyson was an impressive talent this year for the Golden Bears. Tyson transferred to Cal and was the focal point of their offensive attack, excelling in the pick-and-roll game as a ball-handler and scoring option. He’s got the offensive versatility to be a fantastic addition for the Cavaliers early on and it will be interesting to see if Tyson can still be such an impact without the ball in his hands so much.\n\nCraig Porter Jr. was a pleasant surprise for the Cavaliers last year and has cemented himself as a potential legit piece for this team moving forward. Porter Jr. could be a candidate for the “Too Good For Summer League” team, as he has shown the ability to be a dynamic weapon on the court.\n\nEmoni Bates will be another one to keep an eye on. After being a well-known prospect in the high school ranks, Bates fell to the 49th pick in the 2023 NBA Draft. He spent his rookie year getting plenty of run in the G League with the Canton Charge. In 27 games, Bates averaged 21.6 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.9 assists while shooting 37.1% from downtown. Scoring has never been a question for Bates, and it will be interesting to see if the rest of the game is trending in the right direction.\n\nYes, the big fella DJ Burns finds himself on the Cavaliers roster. Burns was a fan favorite during the NCAA Tournament and has reportedly gotten in fantastic shape throughout the predraft process. Burns is extremely skilled and will be a super sleeper to watch out for in Summer League.\n\nDALLAS MAVERICKS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nMelvin Ajinca (51st)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nOlivier-Maxence Prosper\n\nAlex Fudge\n\nJamarion Sharp\n\nBrandon Williams\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Olivier-Maxence Prosper\n\nSUMMARY: The Mavericks were one of the pleasant surprises of the 2024 NBA playoffs, as they battled their way through a vicious Western Conference to get to the NBA Finals. Now, the Mavericks will be looking to build off an impressive year and get back to the Finals. After numerous strong additions throughout the season via trade, Dallas has plenty of pieces in place to go forward with. The hope for Dallas is that some of their young pieces will take a step forward to give their bench a boost.\n\nDallas took a flier on international wing Melvin Ajinca in the 2024 NBA Draft, who has been a popular name in the scouting world. Ajinca spent last year with Saint Quentin and offers the hope of developing into a 3-and-D talent with legit floor spacing upside. If the defense can be consitent, Ajinca could be a name to monitor.\n\nThe name I’m curious to see is second-year forward Olivier-Maxence Prosper. The versatile forward was one of the biggest risers throughout the predraft process in 2023 and has the tools to be a desired talent—especially when it comes to the current build of the Mavericks roster. Prosper spent some time in the G League with the Texas Legends, averaging 18.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game while shooting 41.6% from three-point range.\n\nKeep an eye on Jamarion Sharp and Alex Fudge. Both have the tools to be dynamic defensive assets. If the offensive game can show anything, they could be developmental pieces to watch in Vegas.\n\nDENVER NUGGETS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nDaRon Holmes II (22nd)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJulian Strawther\n\nJalen Pickett\n\nHunter Tyson\n\nP.J. Hall\n\nTrey Alexander\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Julian Strawther\n\nWarning: Wagon Alert!\n\nSUMMARY: Ladies and gentlemen, we have our first official WAGON ALERT for Summer League. The Denver Nuggets are going to be out for revenge this year, especially coming off a shocking early exit in the NBA Playoffs. The Nuggets have done a sensational job of adding some intriguing talent in recent draft classes. The hope is that the Nuggets can get some improved production from a number of their pieces and there’s a lot of fun talent to look at for this Summer League team.\n\nThe worst-kept secret throughout the 2024 NBA Draft process was the Nuggets desire to draft Dayton big man DaRon Holmes II. There had been reports of an early promise to Holmes in the predraft process, which resulted in Denver trading up to secure “their guy” with the 22nd pick. Holmes took strong developmental strides each year at Dayton and could be a tremendous addition to the rotation for the Nuggets early on, given his skill set.\n\nJulian Strawther looks poised to be a player who could earn some extended minutes for the Nuggets this year in the rotation. Strawther showed some flashes for Denver throughout his rookie year, especially when it came to the outside shot. Going back to his days at Gonzaga, Strawther has been a player who can make an impact in a number of ways. He will be one to watch for sure.\n\nJalen Pickett will be a bit of a “sleeper” to keep an eye on for this Denver Nuggets Summer League squad. There are plenty of names that should generate some serious buzz for the Nuggets, but Pickett is one who deserves some serious spotlight. Pickett was selected 32nd overall in the 2023 NBA Draft and spent the majority of his rookie year in the G League with the Grand Rapids Gold. In 24 games, he averaged 17.4 points, 5.5 rebounds, 8.9 assists, and 1.5 steals per game while shooting 37.7% from downtown. Denver is always looking to develop their draft picks with the upside of having them as pieces in their rotation. Pickett has the offensive tools to be an intriguing name to watch, especially with his feel for the game.\n\nAnother personal favorite of mine to watch out for is second-year wing Hunter Tyson. He was the 37th overall selection in the 2023 NBA Draft and Tyson was a player who popped last year at Summer League. Like Pickett, Tyson spent the majority of his rookie campaign in the G League with the Gold. He put up some eye-opening numbers down there, averaging 23.8 points per game with shooting splits of 44.1/39.3/84.4. There’s plenty of young talent waiting in the wings that can spread the floor at a dangerous level in Strawther and Tyson. They will both be names to keep in mind.\n\nA couple of shocking undrafted players deserve some spotlight as well. Denver added two strong talents in the undrafted market in both P.J. Hall and Trey Alexander. Hall has the tools to be a player who could stick down the road, given his toughness and floor spacing upside. Alexander has shown the tools to be a crafty two-way talent and if the consistency can come around, he could be a great get for this organization.\n\nDETROIT PISTONS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nRon Holland (5th)\n\nBobi Klintman (37th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nMarcus Sasser\n\nTosan Evbuomwan\n\nDaniss Jenkins\n\nJalen Slawson\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Ron Holland\n\nSUMMARY: The Detroit Pistons are shifting in a completely new direction. There’s a new man in charge, as rising executive Trajan Langdon was hired to be the team’s President of Basketball Operations. Detroit also hired former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff as the new Head Coach. There’s plenty of intriguing talent on this Pistons roster; now it’s time to see if they can finally take a step in the right direction.\n\nDetroit turned heads on the night of the 2024 NBA Draft with the selection of Ron Holland with the #5 overall pick. Holland has as much upside as any selection in the 2024 NBA Draft class. There had been speculation of Holland slipping in the class, due to poor workouts. But the beauty of the draft is that it only takes one team to be convinced of the tools. Holland is as dangerous of a transition threat as any prospect. He’s got elite speed in the open floor and is a blur when getting downhill to finish above the rim with bad intentions. The outside shot will be the swing skill, more than ever for Holland. The Pistons hired one of the best shooting coaches in the league in Fred Vison. If he can get Holland on the right path, it’s going to be a heck of a development for Pistons fans.\n\nThe Pistons weren’t done there, as they went on to add forward Bobi Klintman in the second round. Klintman has been a name buzzing in draft circles going back to the 2023 NBA Draft before withdrawing and heading overseas to play in the NBL. There are fun tools and floor spacing upside with Klintman, and he could present some intriguing value for the Pistons moving forward.\n\nPersonally, I’m pumped to see Marcus Sasser on this Pistons Summer League roster. Sasser was the 25th overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and had some promising moments during his rookie season. He’s the type of player that is licking his chops for his second Summer League. The Pistons have added some exciting young talent to the mix in the last couple of years. Plenty of names that are going to generate some excitement with fans, but Sasser could be the one that starts to create some buzz this year as a legit piece to have in the mix moving forward. In his last five games of the 2023-24 NBA season, Sasser averaged 17.8 points and 5.2 assists per game while shooting 44/37/90.\n\nA bit of a “sleeper” that I’m keeping an eye on is Tosan Evbuomwan. After going undrafted, Tosan spent most of last season in the G League with the Motor City Cruise. He put up some eye-opening box scores throughout the year and finished with averages of 15.1 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game while shooting 55.4% from the field and 36.1% from deep.\n\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nQuinten Post (52nd)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nBrandin Podziemski\n\nTrayce Jackson-Davis\n\nReece Beekman\n\nMantas Rubstavicius\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Trayce Jackson-Davis\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Brandin Podziemski\n\nSUMMARY: The Golden State Warriors have been one of the more interesting teams to monitor throughout the offseason. The changes have already started to take place for this Warriors team with players such as Chris Paul and Klay Thompson moving on to new teams. Golden State also brought in a pair of veterans in Buddy Hield and Kyle Anderson. Still, there’s some intriguing talent that Golden State hopes will take a big step in year two.\n\nThe Warriors added Boston College big man Quinten Post in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft. Post wasn’t listed on the initial Summer League roster for the California Classic as he’s been recovering from a leg injury, but reports suggest he’s hoping to make an appearance in Las Vegas. Post is a skilled big man who can offer some versatility on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nThe names to watch out for include Brandin Podziemski and Trayce Jackson-Davis. Podziemski was one of the most impressive rookies in the league last year and looks poised for an increased role for the Warriors this year. Podziemski has the versatility offensively that makes him a fantastic piece for the Warriors given his ability on the court. The name who could take a big step in year two is Trayce Jackson-Davis. After falling into Golden State’s lap in the 2023 NBA Draft, TJD showed plenty of flashes throughout the year for the Warriors. Given the defensive tools and offensive versatility, he should be a name that continues to earn the trust of the coaching staff moving forward. Both players have been playing with Team USA as part of the select team, and are expected to take the court for the Warriors in Las Vegas.\n\nKeep an eye on a couple of sleepers for the Warriors moving forward. Virginia guard Reece Beekman went undrafted but has the tools to be a sneaky name to watch moving forward. Beekman is a talented defender with a strong feel for the game. If the offensive game can continue to progress, he can be a strong rotation asset. Mantas Rubstavicius has been a name buzzing over the years and had some promising flashes last year in the NBL. He’s a sleeper to keep an eye on as he can light it up in a hurry.\n\nHOUSTON ROCKETS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nReed Sheppard (3rd)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nCam Whitmore\n\nAJ Griffin\n\nJermaine Samuels Jr.\n\nTrevor Keels\n\nKira Lewis Jr\n\nN’Faly Dante\n\nOrlando Robinson\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: AJ Griffin\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Cam Whitmore\n\nSUMMARY: Houston, we have liftoff. It was a strong season for the Houston Rockets, who look to be a team that is quickly on the rise in the Western Conference. Hiring Ime Udoka as the new head coach seemed to be just what the doctor ordered. Now, it will be interesting to see how this impressive roster, mixed with youth and veterans, can continue to mesh. The Rockets had themselves a heck of a haul last year with Amen Thompson and Cam Whitmore. Both showcased tremendous upside as rookies, and there’s no denying that they have the potential to both become popular sophomore breakout candidates.\n\nI thought Houston landing Reed Sheppard with the third overall pick was a tremendous fit. This Rockets team has a fantastic young nucleus of athleticism, defensive assets, and playmaking. The next ingredient they need in the kitchen is someone who can really shoot it. Sheppard just had a jaw-dropping freshman season at Kentucky. Not only was his shooting percentages freakish, but he had the tape to back up what the stats were telling you. Sheppard has the potential to be a perfect fit for this team. He’s a player who knows how to make others, especially when it comes to his playmaking in both the halfcourt and transition offense. You pair that with his dangerous shooting ability, and Sheppard could be a heck of a player for this team for years to come. Throw the height or position doubts out the window. Reed Sheppard can just flat-out play.\n\nThe Rockets made a sneaky trade during the offseason, acquiring former Atlanta Hawks forward AJ Griffin. It’s been a strange start to his career for Griffin, who never seemed to get consistent run with the Hawks. Sometimes, a new change of scenery could be just what is needed to get the confidence cooking again. Griffin has the tools to be a strong fit for this Rockets team, given his upside and floor spacing potential. He’s going to be a fun one to keep an eye on at Summer League. I think this is a tremendous “buy-low” move for the Rockets that could pay off, especially when you remember that Griffin is still just 20 years old.\n\nToo Good For Summer League Candidate! Yes, I’m throwing Cam Whitmore in the mix here. After being projected as a potential Top 5 selection 72 hours before the 2023 NBA Draft, Cam Whitmore suffered a strange slide. Houston jumped all over the upside, selecting Whitmore with the 20th overall pick. An absolute bully when getting downhill, Whitmore spent the early portion of his rookie season in the G League with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. It didn’t take long before Whitmore opened eyes with his play with the Vipers. In 13 games, Whitmore averaged 26.2 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 2.1 steals per game while shooting 47.5% from the field and 38.9% from three. After getting brought up to the Rockets, Whitmore continued to impress with some strong stretches during his rookie season. The tools are there for Whitmore to continue adding versatility to his offensive game. I thought his rookie year was a great start. Now, it will be interesting to see what other aspects of his game can begin to get unlocked. He could be a “let’s shut this one down” candidate.\n\nINDIANA PACERS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nJohnny Furphy (35th)\n\nTristen Newton (49th)\n\nEnrique Freeman (50th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJarace Walker\n\nBen Sheppard\n\nOscar Tshiebwe\n\nKendall Brown\n\nJosiah-Jordan James\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Jarace Walker\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Ben Sheppard\n\nSUMMARY: The Indiana Pacers have done an outstanding job over the years of adding some intriguing talent throughout the draft. This year was no different, as the Pacers left with three new selections from the 2024 class with intriguing potential. It starts with Johnny Furphy, who surprised some by falling out of the first round. After coming off the bench to start the 2023-24 NCAA season for Kansas, Furphy was inserted into the starting lineup and started to thrive. When things were cooking, Furphy showcased his potential to be a strong off-ball threat with a beautiful outside shot. After Kansas dealt with numerous injuries, Furphy got the full kitchen sink thrown at him defensively, which resulted in some rough outings. Furphy has the tools to be a fun talent to develop, given his feel off-the-ball and floor spacing ability. Pair that with his athletic ability, and you have a fun talent to work with.\n\nDespite being an older upperclassman, UConn Huskies senior Tristen Newton has the potential to be a strong value in the second round. The crafty floor general checks the boxes when looking for a potential modern NBA floor general; if the outside shot can become consistent, the Pacers could have a fun rotation asset to work with moving forward. Akron senior Enrique Freeman was one of the biggest risers throughout the predraft process. After a strong showing at the combine, as well as some reported strong workouts, Freeman became a name that some thought could sneak into the end of the first round. there’s some fascinating value appeal for the Pacers with getting Freeman at 50. Freeman was a production monster last year for Akron and had some questions about his outside shot. Reports suggested that he had shot it well during predraft workouts. If that’s a sign of things to come, then there’s some diamond in the rough potential here for the Pacers.\n\nThe big name to watch out for is second-year forward Jarace Walker. After being selected #8 last year in the 2023 NBA draft, Walker spent most of his rookie season playing in the G League for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. In 19 games, Walker averaged 21.9 points, 5.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.1 steals per game while shooting 47.3% from the field, 37.7% from three, and 79.2% from the free throw line. He’s someone who is expected to take a big leap in his second year, given his versatility on both sides of the ball. If Walker can prove that he is ready to be consistent defensively, along with taking steps in the right direction with his offensive game, he will be someone who finds the floor often for the Pacers in Year Two.\n\nDon’t forget about Ben Sheppard as well, who was starting to open some eyes in the second half of the season for the Pacers. Sheppard has the tools to take a big leap for Indiana in his second season. He’s got good size and the ability to be a microwave scoring option from deep. Sheppard could find himself in the mix for the “let’s shut him down quickly” team, a tradition unlike no other when it comes to Summer League. Sheppard spent only 10 games in the G League, averaging 18.3 points per game while shooting 37.1% from deep. He was eventually called up and played 19.7 minutes during the postseason for the Pacers, averaging 5.2 points per game and shooting 38.0% from deep. Given his two-way upside, Sheppard could be a player who gets shut down early at Summer League.\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nCam Christie (46th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nKobe Brown\n\nJordan Miller\n\nTrentyn Flowers\n\nAmari Bailey\n\nMoussa Diabate\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Kobe Brown\n\nSUMMARY: The Los Angeles Clippers have definitely had an “interesting” offseason when it comes to some of the players being brought in. After losing Paul George to the Philadelphia 76ers, it’s clear that the Clippers will lean on the likes of James Harden and Kawhi Leonard moving forward. It will be interesting to see what type of rotation the Clippers will have next season and beyond. The Clippers still have names like Terance Mann, Norman Powell, and Amir Coffey on the roster; also, veteran Russell Westbrook continues to be mentioned as a potential trade candidate.\n\nFor now, it looks as if the Clippers will wait to see if any of their young talent can step up and earn extended minutes. Los Angeles selected Minnesota freshman Cam Christie in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft. Christie is a raw ball of clay but has the tools to be a strong get for the Clippers down the road. Many expected the talented wing to go back for another year of development. If that were the case, Christie would have been a name penciled in as a potential first-rounder in 2025. Christie had a 10-game stretch in the second half of the 2023-24 NCAA season where he averaged 15.0 points per game with shooting splits of 43/45/86. The tools are there, but Christie will most likely be a name that spends some time in the G League developing his game.\n\nThe names to keep an eye on include a pair of “sophomores” in Kobe Brown and Jordan Miller. Brown was the 30th pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and has the tools to be a dynamic talent offensively, given his skills. In 22 games in the G League last year with the Ontario Clippers, Brown averaged 18.2 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 1.1 steals per game while shooting 47.8% from the field and 33.3% from downtown. Given his positional versatility, Brown will be at the top of the list for Clippers fans to watch out for when it comes to a potential name that can earn some extended minutes.\n\nJordan Miller is another intriguing name to watch out for. He was the 48th overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and showcased the potential to be a great find in the second round after a strong final season at Miami. Miller spent his rookie year with the Ontario Clippers, averaging 20.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 35.5% from downtown.\n\nThe sleeper here to watch out for is Trentyn Flowers. After being a well-known recruit in the high school basketball scene, Flowers committed to play at Louisville. That was until a late change of mind saw Flowers heading overseas to play in the NBL. After a rough start in the NBL, Flowers bounced back and showcased some intriguing flashes. Given his size and offensive ability, Flowers is a name to keep a close eye on in Summer League.\n\nLOS ANGELES LAKERS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nDalton Knecht (17th)\n\nBronny James (55th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nColin Castleton\n\nBlake Hinson\n\nMaxwell Lewis\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Dalton Knecht\n\nSUMMARY: The Los Angeles Lakers look to be running it back with the hope that the roster, plus a new man in charge, can be enough to make some noise in the Western Conference. The team went out and hired first-time head coach JJ Redick to be the decision-maker moving forward.\n\nIt’s been a good start for the Lakers, who had former Tennessee Volunteers wing Dalton Knecht fall into their laps on draft night at 17th overall. Knecht has the tools to be a dangerous player for the Lakers, especially once he finds his footing at the NBA level. We’ve seen shooters like Knecht struggle to get rolling early on as they make the transition to the NBA, but once that shot starts to fall, the confidence can surge in a hurry. Knecht will be one to watch, especially when it comes to simply trending in the right direction.\n\nThey actually did it. Bronny James was selected 55th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers. Bronny will draw plenty of attention, for obvious reasons. The expectations should be extremely watered down for Bronny, who will still be behind in his development given everything he had to go through last year, including a serious medical scare to start the 2023-24 NCAA season. The hope is that Bronny can take strides with his development throughout Summer League before getting as much playing time as possible in the G League this year. The tools are there for James to be a backcourt talent in the NBA given his defensive upside, but there will need to be a stress on patience as his game develops.\n\nSecond-year forward Maxwell Lewis will be a name to monitor. The offensive upside is legit and Lewis was having an eye-opening 2022-23 season for Pepperdine before cooling off and sliding to 40th overall in the 2023 NBA Draft. He spent the majority of his rookie year in the G League with the South Bay Lakers where he averaged 14.6 points per game while shooting 35.5% from three. If the defensive side of the ball can show some consistency, Lewis is a name to watch out for moving forward.\n\nA couple of sleepers include Colin Castleton and undrafted 2024 free agent Blake Hinson. Castleton is a skilled big man who went undrafted in 2023 but showed some promising upside with the South Bay Lakers last year. In 24 games in the G League, Castleton averaged 16.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 1.6 blocks per game while shooting 57.1% from the field and 75.0% from the charity stripe.\n\nHinson is coming off an impressive senior season for Pittsburgh and can get hot in a hurry. He’s a microwave scorer who can quickly activate NBA Jam mode with his tough shot-making ability. Hinson averaged 18.5 points per game last year while shooting 45.4% from the field and 42.1% from downtown.\n\nMEMPHIS GRIZZLIES\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nZach Edey (9th)\n\nJaylen Wells (39th)\n\nCam Spencer (57th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nGG Jackson II\n\nJake LaRavia\n\nTrey Jemison\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Zach Edey\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: GG Jackson II\n\nWarning: Wagon Alert!\n\nSUMMARY: Memphis looks to be a potentially dangerous team in the Western Conference. Coming off a year with a laundry list of injuries, the Grizzlies will hope to be on the warpath in the Western Conference and remind folks just how dangerous they can be at full force.\n\nMemphis found itself picking in the Top 10, and the hope is that it will be the last time they draft that highly for the foreseeable future. The Grizzlies sent shockwaves throughout the NBA Draft space by selecting Purdue giant Zach Edey with the ninth overall selection. Make no mistake about it folks: Edey will be the talk of the town for Summer League. The strides in development Edey took from his freshman year to his senior year are jaw-dropping. He’s been one of the most dominant players in college basketball in recent memory. Edey was tremendous throughout his senior year, showcasing improved conditioning and feel on both sides of the ball. The million-dollar question moving forward is: can his game translate to the NBA level? We’re about to find out. At nearly 7’5”, 300 pounds, Edey will have an advantage physically on just about any opposing big man on a nightly basis. It shouldn’t be much of a shock if Edey continues to dominate at Summer League, given his size and ability around the basket. However, how “seamless” it looks on the defensive side of the ball will be fascinating. Despite the questions, Edey has the tools to be a match made in heaven for the Grizzlies, given their need for a dangerous interior presence on the roster.\n\nMemphis has shown a desire over the years to take some swings in the draft, especially when it comes to developing talent for their rotation. They got a pair of intriguing talents in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft with the selections of Jaylen Wells and Cam Spencer. Wells was one of the biggest risers throughout the 2024 NBA Draft process after a strong finish to the 2023-24 NCAA season for Washington State. In his last 13 games, Wells averaged 16.2 points per game while shooting 45.8% from the field, 44.3% from deep, and 78.4% from the charity stripe.\n\nThe sleeper to keep an eye on is Cam Spencer. One of the most competitive players on the court at all times, Spencer was a dangerous offensive weapon for the National Champion UConn Huskies. Despite being considered a bit undersized, Spencer is the type of weapon that could stick on a roster in the rotation. He’s a deadly shooter who knows how to make winning plays. In his last 19 games, Spencer averaged 13.7 points per game with shooting splits of 48/44/93.\n\nWAIT A SECOND, THAT’S GG JACKSON’S MUSIC.\n\nAfter a roller coaster of a season at South Carolina, the Memphis Grizzlies selected GG Jackson with the 45th pick in the 2023 NBA Draft. Jackson had the tools to be a tremendous get for the Grizzlies, and it was about as perfect of a rookie season as Jackson and the Grizzlies could have hoped for from him. After spending some time in the G League with the Memphis Hustle, Jackson was brought up due to his impressive play and the injuries piling up for the Grizzlies. In 22 games with the Hustle, Jackson averaged 20.0 points per game while shooting 43.3% from the field, 31.1% from three, and 83.1% from the free-throw line. After being brought up to the Grizzlies, Jackson showcased his awesome upside. He averaged 20.4 points per game in his last 18 games while shooting 34.9% from downtown. Jackson will be one of the top returners to monitor in Las Vegas. If the game continues to trend in the right direction, GG can be a dangerous weapon for this Grizzlies team this year—especially since he won’t turn 20 years old until December.\n\nMIAMI HEAT\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nKel’el Ware (15th)\n\nPelle Larsson (44th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nKeshad Johnson\n\nJosh Christopher\n\nCole Swider\n\nAlondes Williams\n\nZyon Pullin\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Kel’el Ware\n\nSUMMARY: Heat Culture, baby! The Miami Heat were one of the top teams to monitor heading into the offseason. Plenty were speculating if superstar Jimmy Butler could be heading to a new destination. For now, it looks like that conversation has cooled off, and the Heat will be looking to make noise in the Eastern Conference with a healthy squad.\n\nMiami opened some eyes on draft night with the selection of Indiana sophomore Kel’el Ware. It wasn’t that the talent isn’t obvious with Ware, but some were expecting that Ware would be coming off the board later. Regardless, Ware has the tools to be a tremendous fit for the Heat. Miami has desperately been looking for some big man depth behind star Bam Adebayo. Ware could be just what the doctor ordered for this organization. A former top recruit out of high school, Ware struggled to find his groove during his freshman year at Oregon. That resulted in him transferring to Indiana for his sophomore year, and it was a wise decision. Ware has the tools to be a dynamic big man at the next level. He’s a talented shot blocker with the upside to be a dangerous floor spacer. It could be a perfect marriage for both parties.\n\nThe Heat also added another intriguing talent in the second round in Pelle Larsson. The former Arizona Wildcat has shown the ability to be a versatile threat offensively over the years. The question with Larsson moving forward is if he can unlock another level of consistency to his game. When things are clicking, Larsson has the feel and floor spacing ability to be a strong addition.\n\nUndrafted free agent Keshad Johnson is a serious sleeper to keep an eye on for the Heat. Johnson transferred to Arizona after some impressive years at San Diego State and was a tremendous addition for the Wildcats. He’s a dawg on the court, especially when it comes to his rebounding and defensive ability. The Heat signed Johnson to a two-way contract already, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if he figured out a way to get into the rotation at some point this year. Johnson won’t wow you with stats, but he’s the type of talent that every team needs in their rotation.\n\nMILWAUKEE BUCKS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nAJ Johnson (23rd)\n\nTyler Smith (33rd)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nChris Livingston\n\nMarJon Beauchamp\n\nAndre Jackson Jr.\n\nJaylin Galloway\n\nRyan Rollins\n\nJustin Moore\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: AJ Johnson\n\nSUMMARY: Milwaukee will be out for blood in the upcoming 2024-25 NBA season. After a roller coaster of a year, including a head coaching change in-season, the Bucks will be one of the top teams to watch out for this year. The question remains, who will be stepping up in the rotation for the Bucks?\n\nMilwaukee opened some eyes during the 2024 NBA Draft when they selected AJ Johnson with the 23rd overall pick. Honestly, I loved the pick. Johnson has the upside to be one of the top talents in this class. He was originally set to go to Texas for the 2023-24 NCAA season before deciding to head overseas and play in the NBL. Despite playing LIMITED minutes, I loved the flashes from Johnson. He’s got good size at around 6’5” and is dangerous when he gets downhill. Johnson has the offensive weaponry to be a heck of an addiction down the road. He’s going to require patience, especially when it comes to his body filling out. For a team like the Bucks, it was a strong swing that could eventually pay off in a major way. The tools are legit, especially when it comes to the offensive firepower and playmaking ability.\n\nMilwaukee wasn’t done there, as they landed another intriguing talent in the second round in Tyler Smith with the 33rd overall selection. While playing with the G League Ignite this past year, some thought that Smith could sneak into the lottery conversation at one point. Smith impressed throughout the year with his floor spacing ability and understanding of what he can do to impact the game. He could be another name that needs some reps in the G League this year, but his combination of size and shooting upside is a strong foundation to work with.\n\nSome intriguing returners will be worth monitoring for this Bucks Summer League squad as well. MarJon Beauchamp will be a candidate to take a nice step forward in his third year in the league. Beauchamp has shown some flashes, but the hope is that the next “step” will unlock some more consistent minutes in the rotation for the Bucks. I’ll be fascinated to see where the development is at for Andre Jackson Jr. He’s got the tools to be a tremendous asset in the rotation for Milwaukee moving forward. With freakish athleticism and defensive upside, Jackson could earn legit minutes on this roster if his play on the offensive side of the ball continues to improve.\n\nMINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nRob Dillingham (8th)\n\nTerrence Shannon Jr.(25th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJaylen Clark\n\nJosh Minott\n\nLeonard Miller\n\nJaedon LeDee\n\nJoe Wieskamp\n\nNadir Hifi\n\nKok Yat\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Leonard Miller\n\nWarning: Wagon Alert!\n\nSUMMARY: After an impressive run in the NBA Playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves look to be a team that is on the rise in a hurry in the Western Conference. Minnesota has found a superstar in Anthony Edwards. They also have become a force on the defensive side of the ball. Given the roster at hand, Minnesota looks to be a team that will be a beast out West for the upcoming year. That being said, the Timberwolves also look to be trotting out a potential WAGON in Las Vegas.\n\nMinnesota was the talk of the town during the 2024 NBA Draft, as they acquired Rob Dillingham in a draft night trade with the San Antonio Spurs. Dillingham was one of the most fascinating prospects in the 2024 class after an impressive freshman season with the Kentucky Wildcats. Despite being undersized, Dillingham has the tools to be the definition of an NBA Jam scorer at the next level. He’s lightning in a bottle offensively, and he showcased some fascinating playmaking upside last year. The defense will be the question moving forward, but Dillingham landed in a perfect spot to be surrounded with defensive pieces all over. He should be must watch TV at Summer League.\n\nWhat was even more impressive was that Minnesota held onto their other first round selection after acquiring Dillingham. They selected former Illinois wing Terrence Shannon Jr. After being cleared of a previous legal situation, TSJ was a rapid riser throughout the predraft process due to some reportedly strong workouts. Minnesota adding Shannon to the mix gives the team another strong wing asset in their rotation. Shannon has had questions about his outside shot over the years, but he’s a physical beast on the perimeter who is at his best getting downhill. He’s made a reputation going back to his days at Texas Tech for his defensive ability, something that will be desired early by the Timberwolves given their identity.\n\nA sleeper to keep an eye on for this Timberwolves Summer League team is Jaylen Clark. The former UCLA product was one of the top defensive weapons in the country before rupturing his Achilles tendon at the end of the 2022-23 NCAA season. The injury resulted in Clark missing his entire rookie season while recovering. Despite the injury, Clark was still the 53rd overall selection in the 2023 NBA Draft. He has the defensive tools to be a perfect fit for this Minnesota team. Clark is an athletic weapon with outstanding defensive awareness. If the outside shot continues to trend in the right direction, he could be a name that makes noise for this roster.\n\nSecond-year forward Leonard Miller will draw plenty of curiosity from NBA fans as well. Miller was the 33rd overall selection in the 2023 NBA Draft after spending a year with the G League Ignite. He spent most of his rookie year in the G League with the Iowa Wolves, averaging 19.5 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game in 31 games. During that span, Miller also shot 49.6% from the field and 36.5% from three. If the two-way game is trending upward quickly, he will be a name to watch out for as a potential rotation piece.\n\nPlenty of sleepers deserve some attention on this Summer League roster as well. Jesse Edwards and Jaedon LeDee were names that impressed throughout the collegiate season. A super sleeper to watch out for is Nadir Hifi. Although undersized, Hifi was buzzing overseas with his play for Paris and is one to have on your radars.\n\nNEW ORLEANS PELICANS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nYves Missi (21st)\n\nAntonio Reeves (47th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJordan Hawkins\n\nMalcolm Hill\n\nJoey Hauser\n\nJordan Hall\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Yves Missi\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Jordan Hawkins\n\nSUMMARY: New Orleans looks to be another sleeper candidate to make some serious noise in the Western Conference. The Pelicans have shown the potential to be a dangerous team in the NBA. The only thing that has seemed to hold this team back is health. After making a trade for Dejounte Murray, it looks as if the Pelicans are diving even deeper on the hope that a healthy year can get the Pelicans to the next level.\n\nThe Pelicans went into the 2024 NBA Draft with the potential to land a potential big man with the 21st overall pick. That’s just what they did, adding athletic big man Yves Missi. After an impressive year at Baylor, Missi was one of the more intriguing centers in the draft. He has the tools to be a dynamic rim running big with impressive athleticism and shot blocking upside. Missi will need time for the tools to come together, but he landed in a great spot that can lean on his strengths early on.\n\nI thought New Orleans adding Kentucky guard Antonio Reeves in the second round was a sneaky pickup. Reeves was an upperclassman who was absolutely deadly from beyond the perimeter last year for Kentucky. Although he will be a bit of a specialist early on, Reeves has the potential to offer some legit floor spacing upside, which was a solid swing in the second round.\n\nOne of my favorite names to watch out for heading into Summer League is second-year wing Jordan Hawkins. The former UConn Huskies sharpshooter showcased plenty of flashes throughout his rookie year when it comes to how dangerous of a scoring threat he can be. The next step for Hawkins will be unlocking the versatility and consistency. He should be in the conversation for “Too Good For Summer League” and could be a candidate to be shut down early with a couple of impressive performances.\n\nNEW YORK KNICKS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nPacome Dadiet (25th)\n\nTyler Kolek (34th)\n\nKevin McCullar (56th)\n\nAriel Hukporti (58th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nRokas Jokubaitis\n\nDuane Washington Jr.\n\nJustin Lewis\n\nJacob Toppin\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Tyler Kolek\n\nSUMMARY: New York made one of the biggest splashes of the NBA summer with the blockbuster trade to acquire Mikal Bridges. After resigning OG Anunoby, the Knicks are clearly making a serious push to contend in the Eastern Conference with an impressive roster.\n\nOn top of the move, I also loved what the Knicks did in the 2024 NBA Draft. One of my favorite “swings” in this previous class was international forward Pacome Dadiet. He caught my eye going back to his showing at Basketball Without Borders and has been a talent that was hiding in the shadows overseas. Dadiet is extremely talented and was playing for a Ratiopharm Ulm team that was stacked with veteran talent. Throughout the year, Daidet continued to impress which resulted in his minutes starting to climb. For a Knicks team that gave up plenty of future draft capital for the Bridges trade, Dadiet was a fantastic addition that could pay off in a big way down the road.\n\nI thought the team’s landing of Tyler Kolek has the potential to be a match made in heaven. Kolek was a name I thought the Knicks could have taken with one of their first round selections. Getting him at 34th overall was tremendous value. The limitations of Kolek are obvious, but the strengths he brings are fantastic. Kolek is an asshole on the court, in a good way. He’s going to be ready to go to war every night, regardless of who is lining up across him. The playmaking and feel are fantastic, especially with his basketball IQ. Adding Kolek as a potential rotation piece behind Jalen Brunson has the upside to be a fantastic marriage for both parties. It won’t take long for Knicks fans to become Kolek fans.\n\nOne of the most shocking falls of the 2024 NBA Draft was Kansas wing Kevin McCullar. There had been rumblings throughout the predraft process of McCullar having some medical issues. It wasn’t much of a surprise, especially given McCullar’s injury history and procedure at the end of the year, resulting in him not being able to participate in the predraft process. If McCullar can get healthy and stay healthy, this could be one of the best value selections of the draft. He’s a versatile piece who can play and defend multiple positions, and he is addicted to making winning plays. Regardless of the outside shot consistency, McCullar could be a fantastic rotation asset.\n\nI would keep a close eye on Ariel Hukporti. The stats won’t wow you, but Hukporti has been a name that has been buzzing in scouting circles for basically decades. Hukporti has started to showcase some legit potential to become a rotation big. He’s a big-bodied rebounder who can really get after on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nNikola Topic (12th, injured)\n\nDillon Jones (26th)\n\nAjay Mitchell (38th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nOusmane Dieng\n\nAdam Flagler\n\nJack Gohlke\n\nKeyontae Johnson\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Ajay Mitchell\n\nSUMMARY: Things are getting fun in a hurry for this Oklahoma City Thunder squad. The Thunder are set up to be a force in the Western Conference for years to come. Sam Presti continues to do a tremendous job of building this team throughout the draft and the Thunder have positioned themselves to be a legit contender in the Western Conference this year. Yes, the Thunder still have a treasure chest of draft picks. No, Sam Presti doesn’t care if you want those picks traded for a player. Instead, Presti added a trio of players to the mix with the 2024 NBA Draft class.\n\nThe Thunder landed international guard Nikola Topic, considered a potential Top 5 pick for almost the entire 2024 NBA Draft cycle, with the 12th overall selection. Topic was as impressive as any prospect this year during his tenure with Mega Basket. After a midseason move to play in the Euroleague for Crvena Zvezda, Topic showed some promising flashes before dealing with numerous injuries. Eventually, Topic would suffer a partial ACL tear at the end of the season. The tools are there for Topic to be a tremendous addition to this roster. Given his age and upside, Thunder fans should be excited to see him down the road.\n\nOklahoma City was aggressive on draft night, trading up to acquire Weber State forward Dillon Jones with the 26th overall pick. Jones is a dynamic weapon offensively. He has tremendous feel for the game and can score in a number of different ways. The Thunder have shown a desire over the years to get players who can impact the game with their feel and versatility, and that’s just what Jones can bring to the table. This could be a match made in heaven for both parties.\n\nThe sleeper to keep a close eye on is Ajay Mitchell. OKC traded up again to acquire Mitchell in the 2024 NBA Draft with the 38th overall pick. Mitchell is a crafty floor general who is coming off a sensational year for Santa Barbara. He plays the game with great pace and can light up the scoring column while also making strong reads. OKC signed him to a two-way contract already, but Mitchell will be a fun one to watch develop for this team moving forward.\n\nIt’s going to be a very interesting Summer League for third-year forward Ousmane Dieng. The recently turned 21-year-old has the tools to be a strong addition to the rotation for the Thunder. After he spent the last couple of years developing in the G League, it’s going to be interesting to see if Dieng is ready to take the next step forward and become a piece of this rotation for OKC. While playing last year for the Oklahoma City Blue, Dieng averaged 17.2 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game. The outside shot needs to come around on a more consistent level, as Dieng shot just 28.8% from deep last year in the G League. If it can, Dieng has the potential to be another weapon in the rotation for this deep Thunder team.\n\nORLANDO MAGIC\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nTristan Da Silva (18th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nAnthony Black\n\nJett Howard\n\nJarrett Culver\n\nJared Rhoden\n\nIsaiah Todd\n\nJay Huff\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Jett Hoard\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Anthony Black\n\nSUMMARY: PLAY THE DAMN SONG! The Orlando Magic are right on schedule with their development. Orlando is coming off a sensational season where they made it back to the NBA Playoffs. Now, the goal is for Orlando to continue to take the next steps forward to becoming a contender for years to come in the East.\n\nPersonally, I thought Orlando landed one of the best potential picks in the first round in terms of fit. Colorado forward Tristan Da Silva wasn’t the “sexiest” of prospects in the 2024 NBA Draft class, but I thought Da Silva was the type of talent that every team desires. In a draft class that featured so much uncertainty, Da Silva was the only player I continued to get the same feedback about: “Kid can just play, I really like him.” Da Silva is a high-feel player who understands how to get to his spots and make his teammates better. If the outside shot is legit early on, he’s going to be a player who can earn a role in the rotation right away.\n\nAll eyes will be on second-year guard Anthony Black. After being selected with the sixth overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, Black eventually became an important defensive asset in Orlando’s rotation. The hope is that Black will be ready to take a leap forward in Year Two. The defensive game has already become legit and I thought Anthony showcased some awesome feel offensively at times as a rookie. If he can showcase that the next step in development is ready to happen, Black could pair to be a sensational running mate with Jalen Suggs this year.\n\nOne of the top names I’m watching closely this year at Summer League is second-year wing Jett Howard. After an impressive freshman season at Michigan, Howard was the 11th overall selection in the 2023 NBA Draft. Howard spent the majority of his rookie season in the G League with the Osceola Magic. In 35 games, he averaged 18.8 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game while shooting 43.6% from the field, 37.7% from three-point range, and 80.9% from the free throw line. Howard is the type of talent who could take a serious leap forward in his second Summer League. He has the tools to become an important asset for the Magic in their rotation. The defensive side of the ball will need to show some improvements, as expected. If Howard can take a step forward, though, along with the addition of rookie Tristan Da Silva, the Magic could get a SERIOUS boost in their rotation when it comes to their floor spacing.\n\nPHILADELPHIA 76ERS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nJared McCain (16th)\n\nAdem Bona (41st)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJustin Edwards\n\nRicky Council IV\n\nRomeo Langford\n\nRJ Hampton\n\nJudah Mintz\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Jared McCain\n\nSUMMARY: There’s been plenty of buzz surrounding the Philadelphia 76ers this offseason. The Sixers added another serious talent to the mix with the addition of superstar forward Paul George. Philadelphia now has a fascinating three-headed monster with PG, Tyrese Maxey and, the big fella, Joel Embiid.\n\nAlong with the Paul George addition, I thought Philadelphia had one of my favorite draft hauls of the 2024 NBA Draft. The 76ers got themselves some tremendous value at 16th overall with the addition of Jared McCain. After an impressive freshman season at Duke, McCain was in the conversation to go in the lottery. McCain isn’t the biggest player, but he’s an absolute gamer. He’s a player who won’t be afraid of the moment, and he’s a dawg on the court. McCain is a high-feel combo guard who knows how to make his teammates better and can space the floor. He’s relentless on both sides and isn’t afraid to go inside and make plays on the boards. At the end of the day, McCain can just flat-out play. Throw him on the court and be happy he’s on your team.\n\nOne of my favorite second round fits was Adem Bona landing with the 76ers. Bona was coming off a strong freshman campaign for UCLA before a late-season injury resulted in him not being able to work out for teams after he tested the waters for the 2023 NBA Draft. That resulted in Bona returning to UCLA for his sophomore year, and the thoughts were that he could be a name who climbed up boards. After a hyped incoming recruiting class disappointed, Bona was asked to play a role that wasn’t to his strengths. Bona plays with his hair on fire and his motor never turns off. He’s an explosive big man who can live above the rim and fly across the floor for emphatic rejections. Adding him in the rotation behind Joel Embiid could be a tremendous get for this team.\n\nA former top recruit in the high school ranks, it was shocking to see Justin Edwards go undrafted. After coming into the year as a projected preseason Top 10 pick, Edwards struggled to find his groove at Kentucky. He will be a name to keep an eye on, especially if he can spend some time getting some reps in the G League. Edwards has the tools to become a promising 3-and-D talent, but the confidence is going to need to be unlocked.\n\nI’ll be keeping a close eye on second-year wing Ricky Council IV. There’s no denying that Council has the tools to be an NBA-caliber wing. If the outside shot can trend upward, Council has the potential to earn a spot on this roster moving forward. He put up some impressive numbers in the G League with the Delaware Blue Coats last year, averaging 23.8 points per game while shooting 38.0% from three-point range.\n\nFamiliar faces Romeo Langford and RJ Hampton find themselves on the 76ers Summer League roster as well. Both will be interesting names to watch out for, especially as Philadelphia looks to find some “cheaper” options for depth.\n\nPHOENIX SUNS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nRyan Dunn (28th)\n\nOso Ighodaro (40th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJalen Bridges\n\nIsaiah Wong\n\nDavid Roddy\n\nQuinndary Weatherspoon\n\nMichael Devoe\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Ryan Dunn\n\nSUMMARY: Phoenix was one of the biggest roller coasters of a team throughout the 2023-24 NBA season. Now, the hope is that a “fresh start” can be just what the Suns need to get back into the mix in the Western Conference. One of the biggest additions for the Suns this offseason wasn’t a player. It was the move to hire Mike Budenholzer as their new head coach. “Bud” has shown an ability throughout his career to turn teams around in a hurry. He could be a tremendous addition for the Suns team this year.\n\nWe know the foundational blocks for the Suns. They are going to have plenty of offensive firepower with players like Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and a hopefully healthy Bradley Beal. Despite the desire to acquire veterans, I thought this would be a fantastic draft class for a team like the Suns to find some legit depth. Personally, Ryan Dunn was near the top of my list when it came to where he would end on the night of the draft. The Virginia sophomore has been one of the top defensive prospects I’ve evaluated in recent memory. The defense is THAT good. He’s an athletic freak on the floor with tremendous awareness and anticipation. Dunn can switch onto anyone and hold his own, regardless of position. He’s got lightning-quick feet and tremendous timing to make emphatic rejections. Plenty have pointed at the offensive side of the ball as the million-dollar question. The outside shot is the clear “Hey, if this gets to average, we have a 10+ year NBA player.” But the FIT with Phoenix is VERY interesting here. Dunn might struggle with the outside shot, but he’s a smart player off the ball who can put himself in the right position to make an impact. If the Suns can have him on the floor with clear offensive weapons, Dunn could be a player who could fit perfectly early on in his career.\n\nDon’t sleep on the addition of Marquette big man Oso Ighodaro in the second round as well. Ighodaro is a high-feel big man with serious playmaking chops and defensive awareness. Again, this Suns team needs depth in the biggest way. Oso has the tools to be a perfect rotation big at the next level.\n\nBaylor wing Jalen Bridges will be another name to watch out for. Despite going undrafted, Bridges has good size and can space the floor from deep. Personally, I think one of the more interesting “sleepers” to keep an eye on for the Suns is second-year guard Isaiah Wong. The former 2023 NBA Draft second round pick became a free agent after the Indiana Pacers didn’t pick up his contract. It’s not a surprise, given the amount of backcourt depth in the organization for the Pacers, but Wong could be a sneaky add for this Suns team with a strong summer. Wong spent most of his rookie year in the G League for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants and averaged 15.7 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per game while posting shooting splits of 42/31/83.\n\nPORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nDonovan Clingan (7th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nRayan Rupert\n\nKris Murray\n\nTerquavion Smith\n\nJustin Minaya\n\nKennedy Chandler\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Rayan Rupert\n\nSUMMARY: It’s been a rock-solid offseason for the Portland Trail Blazers. As the Blazers continue to chip away at their rebuild, it’s been impressive to see the amount of talent that’s come into the picture for this team. Portland continues to build throughout the draft and will be one of the more fascinating teams to watch as they hope for steps in development from a number of their young players.\n\nPortland was expected to have two picks in the lottery for the 2024 NBA Draft. That was until the Blazers traded the 14th pick and veteran Malcolm Brogdon to the Washington Wizards for forward Deni Avdija. It’s a fantastic addition for the Blazers, as Avdija was fantastic for the Wizards at times last year. Despite rumors of trying to trade up, Portland stayed put at #7 overall and landed UConn big man Donovan Clingan. It was probably one of my favorite value selections of the first round, as Clingan could be a sensational get for the Blazers. Portland has plenty of centers on their roster already with Deandre Ayton, Rob Williams, and Duop Reath. However, Clingan has the potential to raise the ceiling of this team moving forward. Clingan struggled in the first half of the season after dealing with some preseason injuries and working to get his conditioning back. Once everything fell into place, Clingan’s second half of the season was sensational. He’s a beast of a rim-running asset who can do some serious damage on the defensive side of the ball. Clingan’s playmaking ability is fantastic and is begging to be unleashed. For a team like the Blazers, it was a great time to trust your board and take the best player available.\n\nThere are plenty of names on this Blazers Summer League roster who deserve some attention as well. Second-year wing Rayan Rupert will be one to keep a close eye on. The rumblings about Rupert behind the scenes have been promising, and he’s someone who could be poised for a big step forward in year two. Rupert is a talented two-way upside swing with freakish measurables. If the tools are taking steps in the right direction, he’s going to be a legit piece for this team’s future. In 21 games in the G League last year, Rupert averaged 13.4 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game while shooting 37.8% from downtown. He just turned 20 at the end of May.\n\nI’ll also be fascinated to see what Kris Murray looks like in Year Two. Murray was the 23rd overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and struggled to find his consistency as a rookie. He’s the type of talent who could start to really carve out a role in a rotation after a full offseason of work.\n\nSACRAMENTO KINGS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nDevin Carter (13th, injured)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nKeon Ellis\n\nIsaiah Crawford\n\nIsaac Jones\n\nMason Jones\n\nAdonis Arms\n\nAntoine Davis\n\nDrew Timme\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Keon Ellis\n\nSUMMARY: Light the beam! The Sacramento Kings shook things up this offseason with the swing to acquire DeMar DeRozan in a blockbuster trade. DeRozan gives this Kings roster another dangerous offensive weapon who can take over a game in crunch time.\n\nI LOVED the Kings staying put in the 2024 NBA Draft and adding Devin Carter to the mix. There had been rumblings about Carter having a shoulder injury throughout the predraft process which was recently confirmed. Carter is expected to be out for Summer League, but he’s got the tools to be a legit weapon for this Kings roster as a rookie in the rotation. Carter is an absolute dawg on both sides of the floor. He’s a lengthy combo guard who can space the floor from well beyond NBA range, as well as getting after it defensively.\n\nThe name to watch out for with this Kings Summer League team is Keon Ellis. After an impressive postseason showing, Ellis looks to be someone who is on the verge of breaking out for this Kings team. He’s a crafty defensive weapon who is starting to find his groove as a floor spacer. A strong Summer League showing will only fill up the gas tank when it comes to the confidence for Ellis to be on the way up with his development.\n\nSome sleepers to keep an eye on include Isaiah Crawford, Isaac Jones, and Mason Jones. Crawford is coming off an outstanding year for Louisiana Tech and was a versatile piece on both sides of the floor. If he can stay healthy, he can develop into an intriguing piece for this roster.\n\nSAN ANTONIO SPURS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nStephon Castle (4th)\n\nJuan Nuñez (36th, not playing)\n\nHarrison Ingram (48th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nSidy Cissoko\n\nRiley Minix\n\nJamaree Bouyea\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Stephon Castle\n\nSUMMARY: We’re all patiently awaiting Year Two of life with an extraterrestrial on an NBA court. The San Antonio Spurs found “the guy” last year with the addition of Victor Wembanyama. Now, it’s going to be trying to find the surrounding pieces to move forward with for the foreseeable future. San Antonio was one of the storylines of the 2024 NBA Draft. Heading into draft night, the Spurs were set to pick fourth and eighth overall. That was until a surprising move saw the Spurs keep only one of those selections.\n\nWith the #4 overall selection, the San Antonio Spurs selected UConn Huskies freshman Stephon Castle. One of the top guard prospects in the high school ranks coming into the year, Castle was a name that was buzzing heading into the 2023-24 NCAA season given his offensive potential and fit with the Huskies. Instead, Castle became a completely different type of asset than some expected in the preseason. He took a massive leap forward with his defensive ability, making him one of the top perimeter defenders in the class. Castle took on the challenge of being a “new face” on a roster that was full of veterans and defending champions. To do that, he had to adapt to whatever role the Huskies would need him to play… and that’s just what he did. The shot will be the question for plenty moving forward, but Castle has the tools to be a highly impactful player in the early stages of his career. If the shot does come around…the Spurs have the opportunity to get one of the top talents from this class.\n\nSan Antonio selected Rob Dillingham with the eighth pick, which immediately got plenty of fans foaming at the mouth for the potential excitement it would bring. BUT MY GAWD THAT’S WOJ’S MUSIC. The Spurs decided to trade Dillingham to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and instead focused on adding two intriguing pieces in the second round.\n\nInternational guard Juan Nuñez has been buzzing overseas over the last couple of years with his tremendous feel and wizard-like playmaking ability. He’s gifted with the ball in his hands and has the tools to be a floor general who can run the show and put teammates in position to thrive. Nuñez had already signed a contract with international powerhouse Barca before the draft, which was a loud “hey, I’m a stash guy” endorsement. He won’t be at Summer League, but will be one to continue to monitor, especially if the outside shot can progress.\n\nI thought the Spurs got a potential great find with their final second round selection in Harrison Ingram. After buzzing as a freshman at Stanford, Ingram returned to Stanford for another year before struggling to take a step forward. That’s when he announced he would transfer to North Carolina for his junior year. At Stanford, Ingram was given the ball to lean on his playmaking ability, as his three-point shot was lacking consistency. He showed some impressive flashes at that time, but many were waiting for another level to be unlocked. This year at North Carolina, Ingram shocked me with how different his game looked from his Stanford days. He was a bruiser inside with his ability to impact the game on the boards and the outside shot became a legit weapon. I also thought Ingram’s physical transformation from his freshman year has been remarkable. Ingram is a physical two-way player who could become a heck of a rotation piece down the road given all of the ways he can impact the game on the court.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what second-year wing Sidy Cissoko can bring to the table for this Summer League squad. Cissoko has the tools to develop into an intriguing wing option, especially if the feel and outside shot can come around. He’s a sleeper to keep an eye on throughout the Summer. He spent the majority of his rookie year in the G League with the Austin Spurs and averaged 14.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.2 steals per game with shooting splits of 44/26/65.\n\nTORONTO RAPTORS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nJa’Kobe Walter (19th)\n\nJonathan Mogbo (31t)\n\nJamal Shead (45th)\n\nUlrich Chomche (57th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nGradey Dick\n\nOchai Agbaji\n\nBranden Carlson\n\nOmari Moore\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Ja’Kobe Walter\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Gradey Dick\n\nWarning: Wagon Alert!\n\nSUMMARY: I’m extremely intrigued to see what the Toronto Raptors can do this year. Toronto continues to add some intriguing talent to their roster. The Raptors invested in “their guy” this offseason with a hefty five-year, $225 million extension for Scottie Barnes. Now, it’s time to see if the Raptors can continue to surround Barnes with the right pieces to get this team moving forward.\n\nToronto added one of the more fascinating players in the 2024 NBA Draft class in Ja’Kobe Walter with the 19th overall selection. There was a point last year in which Walter was considered a potential Top 5 selection. From a physical perspective, Walter looks to be everything you’d want in a prototypical NBA wing. He’s listed at around 6’6” with a 6’10” wingspan and has a beautiful-looking shot from outside. There are tools to be unlocked for Walter, and Baylor ran him all over the floor on the offensive side of the ball. The consistency was lacking for Walter as a freshman, but there’s no denying he can light it up offensively. For a team like the Raptors, Walter presented some legit value at that point of the draft and he’s going to be a big one to keep an eye on early. It wouldn’t surprise me if he has a couple of big performances in Las Vegas.\n\nThe “sleeper” to keep an eye on for this Raptors team is San Francisco “big” man Jonathan Mogbo. Although he’s listed at around 6’8”, Mogbo is an intriguing talent for this Toronto roster. He’s a late bloomer who grew up as a guard before a growth spurt. That becomes evident on the basketball court when you see his feel and playmaking ability. Mogbo might be a bit undersized, but he makes up for it with his athleticism and 7’2” wingspan. He’s a versatile chess piece that should be fun to watch develop moving forward.\n\nI loved Toronto adding Houston guard Jamal Shead in the second round. You can question the potential given his undersized frame, but Shead is an elite defender in the backcourt and has the mentality you want from a guard. For a team like the Raptors that are trying to take the right steps in their “rebuild”, Shead is the type of asset you want for your organization. He’s relentless on the defensive side of the ball and knows how to play the game with impressive feel and playmaking ability.\n\nUlrich Chomche is the definition of raw, but he’s a heck of a swing with the 57th pick. The former NBA Academy Africa product will have his moments during Summer League, but Toronto knows they are going to want to feed him as many reps as possible this year. He should be a name that lives in the G League, as he just needs experience and reps to unlock his potential.\n\nGradey Dick? Too Good For Summer League Candidate? You BETTER BELIEVE IT. For “sophomores” Summer League is a tremendous opportunity to get a surge of confidence. If you’re a sharpshooter with high feel, you can really take a quick step with your development. Gradey took a while to find his groove as a rookie, but we cannot understate how important it is for a rookie to start to build some confidence heading into their first offseason. In his last 12 games, Gradey averaged 15.0 points per game while shooting 38.7% from downtown. He’s a player I’m expecting to look very different early on at Summer League this year.\n\nUTAH JAZZ\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nCody Williams (10th)\n\nIsaiah Collier (29th)\n\nKyle Filipowski (32nd)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nBrice Sensabaugh\n\nTaylor Hendricks\n\nKeyonte George\n\nDarius Bazley\n\nKenneth Lofoton Jr.\n\nWalker Kessler\n\nArmando Bacot\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Taylor Hendricks\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE: Keyonte George\n\nWarning: Wagon Alert!\n\nSUMMARY: Yes, this Jazz roster is an absolute monster that features ridiculous depth. But let’s congratulate Utah fans on something first…\n\nThank goodness the Utah Jazz rebranded away from the neon highlighter jerseys. Congratulations, Jazz fans; this offseason has already been a smashing success. The baby blue and purple look is just fantastic. Now, let’s get serious. I absolutely love the direction that the Jazz are heading in. We’ve seen it time and time again. Danny Ainge is someone who LOVES to build through the draft. He’s someone who will let the draft play out and trust his board. Utah had a strong draft last year, adding talents such as Taylor Hendricks, Keyonte George, and Brice Sensabaugh. George became the darling of the class after his sensational rookie year.\n\nUtah doubled up on that vision this year, adding three more big-time prospects to the roster. With the 10th overall selection, Utah selected Colorado freshman Cody Williams. Yes, his brother is good and plays for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Cody is coming off a fantastic freshman year. Heading into the 2023-24 NCAA season, Williams was buzzing as a prospect to monitor closely from the high school basketball scene. Personally, I thought Williams would be a name that would be at the top of “breakout candidate” lists as a sophomore. Everything that he accomplished during his freshman year far exceeded my expectations. Now, that doesn’t mean that there’s not going to be some work to be done. Williams has some sensational upside, but he’s going to need time and patience to unlock the tools. That’s just why Cody's landing with the Utah Jazz could be a match made in heaven. If you want to compare Cody to his brother, Jalen Williams, you need to remind yourself of one thing: Jalen took three years of college ball to really start to “click.” With where Cody is at this stage, he’s got a great foundation to work with. Don’t obsess with the stats at Summer League; focus on the development with each game. The Jazz got a potential weapon on the perimeter, now they just need to give it time to blossom.\n\nI thought one of the most exciting fits in the first round was Isaiah Collier falling to the Jazz at 29. Collier was considered the top high school basketball guard coming into the year and spent his freshman year at USC. Despite impressing early on in the year, Collier struggled with turnovers. After missing some time with an injury, Collier returned to the court and looked much improved. He’s going to be another high-upside talent that the Jazz can let develop moving forward. Utah struck gold last year with Keyonte George falling into their laps. There’s no reason why it can’t happen again with Collier, especially if the outside shot can continue to develop.\n\nOne of the more interesting slides on the night of the 2024 NBA Draft was Duke sophomore big man Kyle Filipowski. At one point, an executive I spoke to after the first round said: “How the hell is Filipowski still on the board?” There’s no denying that Filipowski has everything you’d want for a modern NBA big. He’s a 7-footer with floor spacing upside, toughness, and playmaking chops. With Utah, Filipowski can continue to develop his consistency as a potential pick-and-pop weapon.\n\nI’m fascinated to see the strides that second-year forward Taylor Hendricks can take in his second summer league. Hendricks isn’t going to be a player that puts up eye-opening stats. Instead, these are the types of talents you want to see taking steps in the right direction. Coming off an impressive freshman year at UCF, Hendricks was the ninth overall selection in the 2023 NBA Draft. He spent the majority of his rookie season in the G League with the Salt Lake City Stars, where he averaged 14.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks per game while shooting 35.6% from downtown. Still just 20 years old, Hendricks has plenty of exciting upside to untap.\n\nI thought Brice Sensabaugh showed some legit stuff last year in the G League, especially with his playmaking ability. Sensabaugh was a shot-making machine at Ohio State before being selected with the 28th overall pick in 2023. He spent the majority of his rookie year in the G League as well, where he averaged 19.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game while shooting 36.5% from three-point range.\n\nWalker Kessler on the roster? Yes, why not? Walker Kessler also in trade rumors? Sure, let’s present come chaos. Kessler was coming off a strong rookie year and followed that up with a respectable sophomore campaign. He will be a popular name to keep an eye on. Yes, the legend, Kenneth Lofton Jr. is back for Summer League. Lofton spent some time with the Salt Lake City Stars last year, and put up some eye-opening performances. In just eight games in the G League with the Stars, Lofton averaged 23.4 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 4.9 assists while shooting 57.8% from the field.\n\nTOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE CANDIDATE! Utah Jazz rookie standout Keyonte George finds himself on the roster for Summer League. George will be one of the biggest names at Summer League and could be a candidate to get the “okay, we’ve seen enough, shut it down” decision from the front office. Keyonte was fantastic for the Jazz in his rookie year when it came to his playmaking ability and offensive upside. He’s going to be a popular breakout candidate across the league this season.\n\nWASHINGTON WIZARDS\n\n2024 NBA DRAFT PICKS:\n\nAlexandre Sarr (2nd)\n\nCarlton “Bub” Carrington (14th)\n\nKyshawn George (24th)\n\nNOTABLES:\n\nJohnny Davis\n\nJared Butler\n\nPatrick Baldwin Jr\n\nJules Benard\n\nTristan Vukcevic\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Alexandre Sarr\n\nSUMMARY: THESE AIN’T THE SAME WASHINGTON WIZARDS! Washington continues to push forward in the young states of their rebuild. After looking like they struck gold last year with the selection of Bilal Coulibaly, the Wizards had one of the most exciting hauls of the 2024 NBA Draft. A hat tip to the new Wizards front office, who look to be putting together an exciting vision moving forward.\n\nWashington started off their impressive draft night by taking Perth Wildcats big man Alexandre Sarr with the second overall selection. Sarr arguably has the highest upside of any prospect in the 2024 NBA Draft class. Landing that alone with the second pick, is a great start. The defense is legit. Sarr glides on the court with impressive size and length. He’s a raw ball of clay that just simply needs time and reps to continue to work on his craft. The Wizards did a sensational job last year of allowing their upside selection of Bilal Coulibaly to learn with playing time and experience. That should be just what is in store for Sarr this year. There will be growing pains, but if Sarr can continue to take steps in the right direction, he’s got the upside to be a heck of a piece for this young Wizards franchise. At worst, the Wizards landed themselves a versatile defensive weapon who could become a real asset on that side of the floor. If the offensive game continues to trend upward, there’s going to be a heck of a piece developing in DC.\n\nOne of my favorite selections of the night of the draft, in terms of just potential fit, was the Wizards landing Carlton “Bub” Carrington with the 14th overall pick. Carrington gives this organization just what they need: a youthful floor general with tremendous upside. Carrington has everything you’re looking for if you were in an NBA lab putting together a modern ball handler. He’s listed at around 6’5” and is shifty with the ball in his hands. While Carrington has built a reputation for his scoring upside, his playmaking flashes were tremendous this year. With almost every young point guard, Carrington is going to require serious patience. The tools are there, and it’s a fantastic foundation of weaponry to work with. With time, “Bub” could develop into a heck of a piece for this Wizards team for years to come.\n\nThe icing on top of the cake was Washington adding Kyshawn George in the latter portion of the first round. The Wizards went into the 2024 NBA Draft with a roster that needed to add assets in a hurry. That’s just what they did in the first round alone. They added a potential defensive anchor big man with upside, a hopeful franchise floor general, and a dangerous floor spacer with untapped potential. George came off the bench this year as a freshman for the Miami Hurricanes before being inserted into the starting lineup. It was a tough situation with that Miami team last year, but the freshman wing was the lone bright spot. Kyshawn can light the net on fire from WELL beyond NBA range. The on-ball creation will need some work, just in terms of quickness. But he’s a lengthy wing who knows how to cover ground in a hurry and can glide through traffic.\n\nHere’s Johnny.\n\nI won’t stop loving Johnny Davis. It’s going to be a big prove-it year for the former 10th overall pick from the 2022 NBA Draft. I’m still conducting my investigation to see what happened with Davis’s extreme change in his shooting motion. For now, it looks as if this will be a crucial summer for the 22-year-old. Back in his collegiate days for Wisconsin, Davis was an explosive scoring weapon who could do his damage in the midrange and was an underrated defensive asset. The outside shot has been the skill holding back Davis. He’s going to be one to keep an eye on; if things are trending in the right direction, it would be a very exciting development. Hey…it could happen, right?\n\nTHE TOO GOOD FOR SUMMER LEAGUE TEAM CANDIDATES\n\nWe all know this is something we debate with ourselves on a yearly basis when it comes time for Summer League. We observe every roster announcement before scrolling to a name and saying: “Wait a minute, why is he playing at Summer League?” The truth is, we should be applauding these young players for wanting to improve and get some extended work.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that executives aren’t watching closely before realizing, “OK, we’ve seen all we need to see; let’s not be stupid here and risk an injury.” Because of that, it’s time to unleash the first annual “Too Good For Summer League” teams. So many other NBA awards have debates about whether or not positions should be mandatory for teams like this. I’m not going to force a “center” onto this list. Simply put, here are the top ten players, not in order.\n\nLet’s have some fun.\n\nFirst Team All-Too Good For Summer League\n\nKeyonte George, G, Utah Jazz\n\nI mean, we’ve got lightning in a bottle here, folks. Keyonte George is coming off a sensational rookie season for the Utah Jazz. He’s going to be a high bucket-getting machine this summer, and we’ve already started to see that after his first couple of performances during the Salt Lake City Summer League. Could one eye-opening performance in Las Vegas get him shut down for the rest of the Summer? I would think there’s a good chance.\n\nBrandin Podziemski, G, Golden State Warriors\n\n“Air Podz” is coming off a strong rookie season for the Golden State Warriors and looks like a player who could be a building block for the franchise moving forward. He’s spent the weeks before Summer League playing with the Team USA select team, which seems like he’s probably faced some pretty good competition all week. Now he will get to play in Las Vegas against Summer League folks. It seems as if it will only be a matter of time before Podziemski opens some eyes with his play on the court. He should be a popular breakout candidate in his second season.\n\nBrandon Miller, W, Charlotte Hornets\n\nWe all had the same reaction. “Brandon Miller? Summer League roster? What?!” Hey, you’ve got to respect it. Miller struggled throughout his rookie Summer League showing. He then followed that up with a tremendous rookie season. It just goes to show that 1) Summer League reps are important for young players to knock some rust off, and 2) we shouldn’t panic too quickly on Summer League performances with young players. Miller looks to be a rising superstar for the Charlotte Hornets. He is going to have the potential to be the best player at Summer League. I would imagine he should have a pretty short game log if he looks as good as we hope, especially after playing with the Team USA select team.\n\nCam Whitmore, F, Houston Rockets\n\nI understand why Cam Whitmore is going to be playing at Summer League. He’s young with tremendous upside, and you still want him to get as much work as possible to continue trending upward. But this is the type of player that could just simply overpower opponents in Las Vegas. Whitmore might be young, but he’s got the strength and power to get to the basket at will. If the outside shot continues to trend upward, as well as the offensive versatility starting to get unlocked, Whitmore is going to be a FUN one to watch out for this year.\n\nGG Jackson II, F, Memphis Grizzlies\n\nWhat a tremendous story and rookie season it was for GG Jackson. After a less-than-deal predraft process, Jackson saw himself fall to the second round before being scooped up by the Memphis Grizzlies. He spent some time tearing up the G League before getting called up and thriving at the NBA level. Now, it will be interesting to see if GG’s game is continuing to take steps in the right direction. If so, GG will be a dangerous offensive weapon for this Grizzlies team that will be out for revenge during the 2024-25 NBA season.\n\nSecond Team All- Too Good For Summer League\n\nAnthony Black, G, Orlando Magic\n\nRookie point guards have one of the biggest learning curves of any position in any sport. I thought Anthony Black had a strong rookie season, given his ability to get minutes and make an impact on an Orlando Magic team on the rise. The tools are all there for Black to turn into a legit backcourt machine for the Magic moving forward. Now, the focus will be on letting the confidence meter continue to fill up while the game starts to slow down. For Black, Summer League is going to be a tremendous opportunity to continue to work on his craft. He’s the type of player who could start to look noticeably better regardless of the stats. He should be at the top of your watch list for Las Vegas.\n\nCraig Porter Jr., G, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nThere were some awesome flashes last year for Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Porter Jr. That included a five-game stretch that saw him average 14.4 points and 4.8 assists per game while shooting 50% from downtown. Porter is now looking like a fantastic bench asset on the rise for this Cavaliers team. He will be a fun “sleeper” to monitor in Las Vegas, as things could get interesting in a hurry for this Cavaliers roster if Porter can take another leap forward.\n\nJordan Hawkins, G, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nOne of my favorite “breakout candidates” as a sophomore this upcoming season is New Orleans Pelicans wing Jordan Hawkins. After some impressive flashes during his rookie year, Hawkins cooled off and struggled to get consistent minutes. He’d have his fair share of games in which Hawkins was red hot, but that’s the dangerous world with sharpshooters. When they are off, you’ve got to be able to bring something else to the table. That’s why Summer League can be so important for some of these second-year players. If the game can start to slow down, Hawkins could be a name that puts it together quickly.\n\nBen Sheppard, W, Indiana Pacers\n\nConsider me high on the potential for the Ben Sheppard sophomore leap. I think there’s a chance that Sheppard could take a noticeable leap in his second Summer League. There’s something about lengthy sharpshooters with feel who are coming off playing in the NBA playoffs that screams “OK, this might not live up to your expectations.” Sheppard has the talent to be a heck of a piece for this rising Pacers team for years to come. He’s started to look like a 3-and-D prospect who is on the verge of unlocking some fun stuff offensively.\n\nGradey Dick, W, Toronto Raptors\n\nYes, we’re doubling down on the fact that another shooter on the second team is going to take a leap forward. Gradey Dick has been a high-feel player going back to his productive career at Kansas. I’m betting that after a roller coaster of a rookie season, a strong finish to the season, paired with his first full offseason, is going to be just what Gradey needs to get things cooking. If Gradey can start to showcase some additional versatility offensively, he’s going to be a player who can earn some consistent minutes for this young Raptors team."
