        "text": "BROOKLYN, N.Y. – Auburn All-American Jabari Smith was selected No. 3 overall by the Houston Rockets on Thursday night at the 2022 NBA Draft held at the Barclays Center.\n\nSmith, the 2022 USBWA Wayman Tisdale and NABC Division I National Freshman of the Year, became the highest draft pick in program history at No. 3.\n\n\"I'm happy to be where I'm wanted,\" Smith said. \"I'm glad they took a chance on me, and I'm ready to get in there and show them they made the right decision.\"\n\nThis past season, the SEC Freshman of the Year and All-SEC First Team selection helped lead the Tigers to the program's first No. 1 national ranking, an SEC regular-season championship, a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament and the third-most wins in school history.\n\n\"I'm just going to bring a competitive edge (to Houston),\" added Smith. \"My shooting ability, my ability to score, my ability to guard multiple positions and just my will to win. I'm a team player.\"\n\nSmith is the son of Jabari Smith Sr., who played at LSU from 1998-2000 and was drafted in the second round, 45th overall, by the Sacramento Kings in the 2000 NBA Draft. His cousin, Kwame Brown, was selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft.\n\n\"I'm so excited for Jabari and his family,\" Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl said. \"The fact that he gets to go to Houston, a pretty good basketball town and a really good organization, I'm excited for him. I'm happy for him. I'm absolutely disappointed that he wasn't the No. 1 player taken in the NBA Draft. That's a real prize. But he's going to go to a really good young club with really good pieces. He will be an NBA All-Star. There's no doubt in my mind.\"\n\nThe Tigers now boast 33 all-time NBA draft picks, including nine first-round draft picks and two NBA Lottery picks (Isaac Okoro in 2020).\n\nChuck Person and Chris Morris were previously Auburn's highest-ever NBA Draft Picks. Both were selected No. 4 in 1986 and 1988 respectively. Charles Barkley and Isaac Okoro were selected No. 5 in 1984 and 2020.\n\nSmith is the fourth \"One and Done\" player from Auburn to enter the draft after his freshman year, joining Isaac Okoro in 2020 and Sharife Cooper and J.T. Thor in 2021.\n\nAUBURN ALL-TIME NBA DRAFT PICKS (33)\n\n1960 – Henry Hart, 12th Round, 82nd Overall, New York Knicks\n\n1963 – Layton Johns, 4th Round, 34th Overall, Los Angles Lakers\n\n1965 – Joe Newton, 3rd Round, 21st Overall, Washington Wizards\n\n1966 – Lee DeFore, 4th Round, 31st Overall, New York Knicks\n\n1971 – John Mengelt, 2nd Round, 21st Overall, Cincinnati Royals\n\n1972 – Henry Harris, 8th Round, 120th Overall, Houston Rockets\n\n1973 – Jim Retseck, 3rd Round, 46th Overall, Golden State Warriors\n\n1976 – Gary Reddings, 5th Round, 73rd Overall, Portland Trail Blazers\n\n1977 – Eddie Johnson, Jr., 3rd Round, 49th Overall, Atlanta Hawks\n\n1978 – Mike Mitchell, 1st Round, 15th Overall, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n1978 – Stan Pietkiewicz, 7th Round, 133rd Overall, Buffalo Braves\n\n1979 – Rich Valavicius, 7th Round, 143rd Overall, Houston Rockets\n\n1981 – Earl Banks, 6th Round, 122nd Overall, Seattle SuperSonics\n\n1981 – Bobby Cattage, 8th Round, 165th Overall, Utah Jazz\n\n1983 – Darrell Lockhart, 2nd Round, 35th Overall, San Antonio Spurs\n\n1983 – Odell Mosteller, 10th Round, 211th Overall, Utah Jazz\n\n1984 – Charles Barkley, 1st Round, 5th Overall, Philadelphia 76ers\n\n1984 – Greg Turner, 9th Round, 193rd Overall, Kansas City Kings\n\n1986 – Chuck Person, 1st Round, 4th Overall, Indiana Pacers\n\n1987 – Frank Ford, 6th Round, 138th Overall, Los Angeles Lakers\n\n1987 – Gerald White, 7th Round, 158th Overall, Dallas Mavericks\n\n1988 – Mike Jones, 3rd Round, 63rd Overall, Milwaukee Bucks\n\n1994 – Wesley Person, 1st Round, 23rd Overall, Phoenix Suns\n\n2000 – Mamadou N'Diaye, 1st Round, 26th Overall, Denver Nuggets\n\n2000 – Chris Porter, 2nd Round, 55th Overall, Golden State Warriors\n\n2001 – Jamison Brewer, 2nd Round, 40th Overall, Indiana Pacers\n\n2019 – Chuma Okeke, 1st Round, 16th Overall, Orlando Magic\n\n2020 – Isaac Okoro, 1st round, 5th Overall, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n2021 – JT Thor, 2nd Round, 37th Overall, Detroit Pistons\n\n2021 – Sharife Cooper, 2nd Round, 48th Overall, Atlanta Hawks\n\n2022 – Jabari Smith, 1st Round, 3rd Overall, Houston Rockets"
