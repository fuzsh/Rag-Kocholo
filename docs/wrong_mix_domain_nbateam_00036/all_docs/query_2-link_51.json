        "text": "The Houston Rockets‘ chase for the final Play-In spot in the Western Conference has just taken a blow after starting power forward Jabari Smith Jr. was slapped with a one-game suspension by the NBA. The 20-year-old’s sanction comes as a result of his altercation in Saturday’s 147-119 blowout win against the Utah Jazz.\n\nSmith threw a couple of punches in the direction of Jazz guard Kris Dunn, which resulted in the league going down hard on the Rockets rising star.\n\nHouston Rockets’ Jabaro Smith Jr. Suspended for One Game\n\nThe league made the official announcement via the NBA Communications Twitter account, which also revealed that Dunn has also been suspended for two games for his role in the fracas:\n\nAs the statement indicates, it’s Dunn who gets the shorter end of the stick here after “initiating an altercation and throwing a punch.” Based on the video below, it appears that it was the Jazz guard who threw the first punch:\n\nSmith is far from innocent, though, as he too let his fists fly in the fight which, fortunately, was broken up before things got nasty. It’s also a good thing that both players aren’t very accurate with their punches as neither of them really got close to connecting with their blows.\n\nSmith finished with five points, two rebounds, and two assists in nine minutes of action. He will be suspended for Houston’s game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday as the Rockets look to make it nine straight victories.\n\nFor More NBA Content:"
