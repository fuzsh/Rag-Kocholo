        "text": "BROOKLYN — The Houston Rockets selected Auburn’s Jabari Smith Jr. with the third pick in the 2022 NBA Draft Thursday evening. The 6-foot-10 big was the SEC Freshman of the Year this past season, and he also was named a consensus second-team All-American.\n\nHere’s a quick analysis of Smith’s strengths, weaknesses and his fit in Houston.\n\nStrengths\n\nElite consensus five-star, and a top-10 recruit in the country. He was named to the rosters for the McDonald’s All-American game, the Nike Hoop Summit and the Jordan Brand Classic. In his first collegiate season, was one of the most decorated freshmen in the country. He was first-team All-SEC, won the SEC Freshman of the Year award and won multiple National Freshman of the Year awards, including the Wayman Tisdale Award. He was named a consensus second-team All-American.\n\nTremendous size at 6-foot-10 for the type of player he is. Has good wingspan at 7-foot-1. Moves well for a player his size. Has good twitch and quickness. Gets off the ground quickly, athletically and functionally. Has good hip rotation. Has an excellent frame that should allow him to put on weight with ease and functionality.\n\nHis key skill is shooting. He is the best 6-foot-10-plus teenage shooter I have ever evaluated. Has pristine mechanics. Perfect balance. Great footwork into the shot. Great rhythm and tempo throughout the shot. Quick release. Doesn’t have to dip the ball to get into the rhythm every time. High release point allows him to make contested ones. Everything is clean and simple with his jumper. All the numbers are absurd for a 19-year-old, let alone one this big. Among high-major players since 2000, only Lauri Markkanen and Jason Kapono made at least 42 percent of their 3s on at least 150 attempts as true freshmen. In total, Smith hit 41.4 percent of his catch-and-shoot jumpers this past season on 133 attempts, with almost all the makes being 3s. His shot prep off the catch is terrific, and he consistently is ready to fire. If you don’t pick him up in transition, it’s over. If you don’t find him in the corners, it’s over. If you close out short, it’s over. If you don’t switch the pick-and-pop, it’s probably over. He’s a ridiculous weapon.\n\nMoreover, Smith generates 3s and midrange shots with an awesome pull-up game. There are shot-creation issues, but this is an immediately translatable way for him to be an effective NBA scorer. Made his pull-up jumpers at a 48.1 effective field-goal percentage, 10th-best among all high-major players in college hoops to take at least 100 such shots in the half court. Before he gets to the half court, you have to pick him up quickly because he’s a legit threat to pull up in transition and hit a 3 in your face. If he moves off the ball, the key is to chase him off the line given how good he is as a catch-and-shoot guy. Even if you do, he’s excellent as a relocation shooter. Loves the one-dribble stepback 3 to his left but can also hit a one- or two-dribble midrange jumper going to both his right or his left if he needs to get some space. He can realign his body in midair to get a clean look at the rim and can rise over the top.\n\nSmith has my favorite move of any player in this class. It’s his left-hand dribble into a spinning turnaround back to his right, where he elevates when wrong-footed, fixing his alignment in midair and sinking it. It’s insane and not guardable. If you overplay the spin, he can fake the spin, pivot back and hit a jumper going left. Auburn ran some interesting actions to get him cleared out at the elbow, where he is comfortable hitting a jab-step pull-up after a dribble or a mini-hesitation rise-up for a jumper. Almost automatic from the elbows. Again, his high release point and ability to generate rhythm from a standstill is lethal. Any type of stepback or turnaround, wrong-footed or right-footed, Smith has it. Can throw together a large variety of complex moves off the bounce and string them together to get a stepback look. He finished 39th in the NCAA among the 229 players nationally to take at least 100 pull-ups in terms of effective field-goal percentage. It’s kind of unheard of for a player his age to be as good of a shooter at his size.\n\nThe other part of Smith’s game that makes him so awesome is his defense. Smith is a terrific defender, one whose game should translate well in NBA settings. Will have no issues switching and should be a plus defender in that capacity as a four. Slides laterally extremely well. Beats his man to the spot and stays in front. Sticks with guards in switches and defended a ton of wings this past season with ease. Does this largely with his lateral quickness. If he beats his man to the spot, he’s awesome at using his length to contest and completely swallow up guards. Not the twitchiest guy in the world, but he reacts well to counter moves. While he’s still relatively skinny, he’s pretty difficult to go through if you try to plow through his chest. Can’t post him. Only going to get stronger too, given his frame.\n\nDoes a good job in overall team defensive constructs, as well. Closes out onto shooters well for a player his size and also fights to recover. Good in help defense and very conscientious. Tries to be there if a teammate gets beaten. Makes smart plays as a weakside shot blocker on occasion. Positive anticipation, but not great. Has good hands to get into passing lanes to deflect the ball. Overall, I see him as a strong plus on defense, not necessarily a likely All-Defense team member. — Sam Vecenie\n\n(Jim Dedmon / USA Today)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nWhile Smith is extremely functional athletically with his balance, lateral quickness and hip flexibility, he’s not necessarily the most explosive athlete in the world. Doesn’t have a wild first step or crazy vertical leap. Plays with more of a hunch and wide stance than actual bend through his legs. There is room for him to add explosiveness if he starts playing with less stiffness in his lower half, but it will take time. His current way of playing may sap some of his burst.\n\nThis bears itself out a couple of ways on offense as problematic. First, he can struggle to drive off his back foot and get leverage or blow by opposing players. Not as fluid as some of the best creators in the NBA. That’s the key difference between someone like him and, say, Jayson Tatum right now. Second, he’s not a good finisher given his size. Doesn’t go up with a ton of strength and doesn’t explode upward. Made 52.1 percent of his shots at the rim; that’s a below-average mark for a player of any size, let alone someone who is 6-foot-10. Needs to be able to pressure the rim in a more effective way.\n\nIt feels like Smith’s not all that comfortable handling the ball to attack. His handle isn’t that tight. Doesn’t have that suddenness in change of pace off the bounce. When he tries to go forward stringing together moves, he can lose control of the ball. On top of that, also doesn’t pass well. Often passes as a last resort and misses open reads. Doesn’t collapse the defense right now because he can’t force help. The end result is that he ends up taking a bevy of pull-up jumpers that are exceptionally difficult to live on. Almost all his pull-ups are contested. He might be good enough to live off it as he keeps improving as a shooter but could be little margin for error as a creator if he doesn’t get rid of some of the stiffness over the next few years. — Vecenie\n\nThe fit in Houston\n\nThis is essentially a dream come true for Houston. The Rockets want to build a new, versatile defensive identity. It doesn’t get any better in this class than Smith, a legitimate Swiss Army knife on that side of the ball. There’s a reason Smith had been long presumed as the top overall pick, as he generated stops at an elite rate and also hit an efficient amount of 3s for the Tigers.\n\nExpect Smith to slot into the starting lineup alongside Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., Alperen Şengün and Jae’Sean Tate. Smith should get the bulk of tough assignments from Day 1, and judging from his Auburn tape, he should be able to hold his own. He’s also going to serve head coach Stephen Silas well with his floor-spacing ability, giving more room for Green and Porter to operate in between the lines.\n\nSmith might not be as good as creating his own jump shot right now, but he doesn’t have to be. It will come with time, development and reps. I wouldn’t be surprised if Silas occasionally trots him out as a small-ball center given his size and strength. That should prove useful in games where Houston is relying on spacing, stops and speed to overwhelm opponents. — Kelly Iko\n\nSummary\n\nSmith has All-Defense in his future. He’ll instantly raise Houston’s defense on Day 1 and should see an example for the others to follow. Offensively, Smith will do all the right things and fall in line.\n\nThe Rockets ended up with a player who legitimately might have been at the top of their board for weeks. That should be considered a slam-dunk selection. Now, the real work begins. — Iko\n\n(Photo: Brad Penner / USA Today)"
