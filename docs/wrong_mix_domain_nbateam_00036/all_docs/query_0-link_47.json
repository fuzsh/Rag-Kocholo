        "text": "With the end of the NBA season quickly approaching and the NBA Draft coming shortly after, the trade rumors for the Portland Trail Blazers are beginning to fly.\n\nBleacher Report’s Greg Swartz wrote an article on every NBA team’s dream offseason trade target, mentioning Houston big man Jabari Smith Jr. as the ideal candidate for the Blazers.\n\nSwartz mentioned that the Rockets could be looking for a major swing in the offseason, and that Portland should try to get involved in a three-team trade that could land them with the young forward.\n\nBalancing out a guard-heavy roster, getting younger and moving veterans for draft picks should be high on the list of priorities for the Portland Trail Blazers this offseason.\n\nPortland shouldn’t be looking to trade for current stars, but those who can develop into one in a few years alongside Scoot Henderson, Shaedon Sharpe and others.\n\nIf the Houston Rockets swing for the fences for a star, the Blazers should try to get involved in some sort of three-team deal to land Smith, much like the Cleveland Cavaliers did with Jarrett Allen in the James Harden-Brooklyn Nets deal.\n\nThe former No. 3 overall pick just completed his second season in the NBA where he averaged 13.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 0.8 blocks while starting all 76 games he appeared in for the Rockets.\n\nBE community, what do you think of the idea of trading for a player like Smith? Chime off in the comments section below."
