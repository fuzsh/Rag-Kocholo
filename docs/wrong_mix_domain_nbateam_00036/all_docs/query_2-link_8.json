        "text": "HOUSTON -- Since losing Alperen Şengün to a knee and ankle injury on March 10, the Houston Rockets have not missed a beat without their best player. They have extended their winning streak to five and remain in a close race for the 10th and final Play-In spot in the Western Conference.\n\nReplacing Şengün's production has been a collected effort. Jock Landale has played a solid role in helping the Rockets fill the vacancy left by Şengün. But Houston has opted to use Jabari Smith Jr. as their starting center rather than inserting Landale into the lineup.\n\nThe results has led to the Rockets going 3-0 since Şengün left the Golden 1 Center in a wheelchair, while Smith has played some of the best and efficient ball of his young career.\n\n\"I've played the five a little bit this season, but not as much as I am now,\" Smith said. \"I am just learning how to play with different people guarding me. Sometimes, I've been having smaller people on me. I've been figuring it out and finding that good balance between the two positions.\"\n\nSmith has never shied away from playing the five. He has always welcomed the challenge due to his advantages amid his quickness and shooting attributes.\n\nCoach Ime Udoka revealed that he began to trust Smith's ability to play center after watching him go head-to-head against James Wiseman during the 2023 Las Vegas Summer League tournament in July, where he recorded a game-high 38 points on 13-of-25 shooting, seven rebounds and six assists in the win over the Detroit Pistons on July 9.\n\nThe success Smith experienced in Las Vegas has transitioned to the second-year forward playing a significant role in the absence of Şengün.\n\nSmith has averaged 17.0 points on 55.9 percent shooting from the field, 50.0 percent from behind the arc, 7.0 rebounds and a block over the previous three games. He had one of his best performances of the season in Saturday's 117-103 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Smith finished with 20 points on 8 of 13 shooting and seven rebounds in the win.\n\n\"He is always going to have an advantage there,\" Udoka said. \"A lot of times, it is harder for opposing big men to guard him than it is for him to guard them. He has the space and can get off any kind of shot he wants too. It is something we will keep taking advantage of.\"\n\nSmith said nothing has changed in his game other than embracing more responsibilities as Houston's primary rebounder while containing the opposing team's big men on the defensive end.\n\nBehind Smith's on-court contributions, the Rockets are entering Tuesday's interconference match against the Washington Wizards three games back of the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors for the ninth and 10th seed of the Play-In Tournament.\n\n\"You definitely pay close attention to the standings, just seeing how close we are,\" Smith said. \"Just watching the NBA and basketball, you can see how tight the West is in general. We are just out here fighting. Everybody is gearing up for the postseason and making their last push. It's been a fun time of the year.\""
