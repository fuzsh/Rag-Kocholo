        "text": "Rumors have been swirling in recent weeks regarding budding star Alperen Sengun, with the Rockets’ center’s name being mentioned in trade reports. Would Houston really consider moving Sengun who arguably was the team’s most valuable player last season, in 2023-2024? Not according to Rockets general manager Rafael Stone. In an appearance on the NBA’s Sirius XM radio channel, Stone said that Sengun would be with the team next year: “We get calls on all our young guys. We have no interest in moving him.”\n\nDespite averaging a gaudy 21.1 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 5.0 assists per game last season, on 53.7% shooting from the floor, the Rockets have not extended Sengun’s contract this offseason, despite the big man being extension eligible. Per reports, much of that decision is largely driven by Houston’s financial circumstances. The Rockets can open up max cap space next summer, in 2025, just by waiving several players on their current roster. Given the massive variance between Sengun’s cap hold and the expected figure on his first year salary pursuant to an extension, it would make sense for Houston to wait on an extension. The Philadelphia 76ers employed this strategy with guard Tyrese Maxey and it ultimately paid off as the team was able to sign All-Star forward Paul George into cap space.\n\nBut the fact that there are reasons to hold off an extension doesn’t necessarily mean that the Rockets would commit. After all, Houston brass aggressively pursued Milwaukee Bucks center Brook Lopez last offseason in free agency, presumably to replace Sengun in the starting lineup. Lopez ultimately re-upped with the Bucks. And it’s been no secret that the Rockets’ preference would be a more versatile, mobile big man to anchor their defense. While Sengun carried the Houston offense, head coach Ime Udoka often had to switch forward Jabari Smith Jr. onto opposing teams’ centers against less favorable matchups. And starting shooting guard Jalen Green’s best stretch of the season in 2023-2024 largely came with Sengun sidelined due to injury, during March, when Green claimed Western Conference Player of the Month honors.\n\nGiven his production thus far at such a young age, Sengun could likely fetch a considerable return in a trade. The Rockets are currently building around their “Core 7” of prospects, each selected in the first round of the past four drafts. To date, Sengun has been the most productive of the group. One could easily imagine Sengun as the centerpiece in a trade for an established star player the likes of which the Rockets have been rumored to be targeting.\n\nBut for now, expect Sengun to open the season as the starter at center for the Rockets, per Stone. He’ll look to build upon his impressive offensive production and continue improving defensively to garner the payday he deserves."
