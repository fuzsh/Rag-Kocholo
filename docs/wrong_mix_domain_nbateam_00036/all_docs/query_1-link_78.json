        "text": "In the weeks leading up to the NBA Draft, Jabari Smith loomed as the favorite to be the No. 1 pick by the Orlando Magic.\n\nThat changed Thursday night, when the Magic shocked many and opted to select Duke’s Paolo Banchero with the top pick. The Oklahoma City Thunder went with Chet Holmgren at No. 2 after being linked to the Gonzaga star for some time. That left Smith there for the Houston Rockets with the third overall pick.\n\nRead more on Jabari Smith: Houston Rockets select Jabari Smith with No. 3 overall pick in NBA Draft\n\nThe moment Bruce Pearl knew Jabari Smith could potentially go No. 1 overall\n\nBruce Pearl reflects on Jabari Smith, Walker Kessler’s impact at Auburn, NBA futures\n\nThe Rockets seized the opportunity and made Smith the highest-drafted player in Auburn history. The fall -- however brief for the Tigers’ All-American -- left Smith with a chip on his shoulder well ahead of his rookie season.\n\nAfter being picked third overall, Smith met with the media in Brooklyn, N.Y. Here’s a look at everything he had to say about his wait, the Rockets’ decision to draft him and what comes next as he embarks on his NBA career.\n\nJABARI SMITH\n\nQ. Talk about your game and what you’ll bring to the Rockets.\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: I’m just going to bring competitive edge. My shooting ability, my ability to score, ability to guard multiple positions, and just my will to win, you know what I’m saying?\n\nI’m a team player, so that’s what they’re getting.\n\nQ. What’s the first thing you’re going to buy with your first NBA paycheck, and then who are you looking forward to playing against this season?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: First thing I’m going to buy, probably somewhere to live, H Town. So probably that.\n\nAnd most looking forward to playing against LeBron. That was my idol growing up, so that’s who I’m looking forward to playing against.\n\nQ. Talk about your mindset right now, having gone through the whole pre-draft process? Where is your head at as you head to Houston?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: Motivated. Real motivated to get down there, get to work and just meet my teammates, meet my staff, just meet everybody down there. Just building relationships, getting to know the family and just getting to work.\n\nQ. What were your thoughts when the pick was announced? There was a lot of talk about you going No. 1. Did it add a chip to you when you got the final result?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: Definitely added a chip, but God makes no mistakes, so I’m happy to be here. I’m happy to be where I’m wanted. I’m happy to get to Houston and just show them, give them what they picked. Just happy to be here.\n\nQ. I know you didn’t work out with Houston. What do you know about them going in, and does it sort of change the way that you sort of go in there and have to build those relationships and all that?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: No, everybody in the NBA is similar. Everybody wants to win. Everybody is easy to get along with. I’m just happy to go in there and just meet new people, meet my teammates. And I know they’re a young, hungry team just like me, so I’m ready to get in there.\n\nQ. What are you most looking forward to joining the young core with Jalen Green and those guys?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: Most thing I’m looking forward to is just growing with them over these next few years. Growing with them, trying to win games with them, growing with them.\n\nWe’re all young, all new to the NBA lifestyle, so just learning from them. They’re older than me, so just getting in there and ultimately building that relationship with them so it can transfer to the court.\n\nQ. How did it feel to have your name called with your parents beside you, and what was your father’s reaction?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: It was a night that I’ll never forget, seeing the smiles on my family’s faces, seeing the smile on my brother’s face, seeing the smiles on my family’s faces in the crowd. It was just something I’ll never forget. Making them proud is something I’ve worked for all my life.\n\nMy dad just told me it was time to amp it up a little bit, time to work even harder. It’s a new level, whole new game. Just trying to get there and get to work.\n\nQ. What is it like to sort of be at the table and go through that just as it’s playing out when you know it’s possible No. 1 or that group of three is sort of interchangeable? What’s going through your mind and being said at the table during that stretch?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: Anticipation. Like you’re just sitting there, cameras floating around, you don’t know where you’re going. You get jitters a little bit, you’re shaking, you’ve been working for this all your life.\n\nYou know you just want to hear your name called, and when it happens you get a little relief, emotions settle in. After that, it’s just a whole new life. You’re a part of a new team, new family. So got to put it behind you and just go forward.\n\nQ. What are some goals you wish to accomplish in your NBA career?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: Goals I wish to accomplish is win an NBA championship, multiple-time All-Star and ultimately be a Hall of Famer and one day be listed as one of the greatest ever.\n\nBut ultimately I just want to win championships and be labeled as a winner, always deep in the playoffs, somebody always competing for championships. That’s what I want to be.\n\nQ. There were many reports that you might go first overall. I don’t know if you saw those things, and did you expect coming into tonight that you would go first?\n\nJABARI SMITH JR: I really didn’t expect it, but I knew it was a possibility. So when it didn’t happen, I wasn’t surprised. All the guys up for the pick are great players. They bring a lot to the table.\n\nLike I said in other interviews, it was a coin flip. When it happened, I just was happy for him, clapped for him and just waited to hear my name called."
