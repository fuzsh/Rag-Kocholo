        "text": "HOUSTON — Shortly before an early December 2022 fixture against the Milwaukee Bucks, then-Rockets lead assistant John Lucas summoned the players to the locker room for one final pregame discussion. He needed to make sure their focus and attentiveness were airtight that evening.\n\nEven for a team that had lost 18 of its first 25 games, there was always a heightened importance when going up against blue-chip contenders. The games just felt different. But considering that Lucas was stepping in for head coach Stephen Silas, who had taken a leave of absence following the death of his father, Paul, it was important to establish unity on all fronts despite the chaos, even if it was only for a night.\n\nLucas and his unorthodox ways are well-documented within the organization, the 69-year-old was seen as a source of light and much-needed comedic relief at times, but there was no time for joking today. Not with Giannis Antetokounmpo in town. The Rockets needed the serious Lucas. More importantly, rookie Jabari Smith Jr. needed the serious Lucas.\n\nIt had been nearly six months since Houston drafted Smith, but the disappointment of falling to the No. 3 pick still felt like a fresh wound to him. A natural competitor, Smith had tried to use draft night as fuel, and on some nights it worked. But more often than not, he couldn’t shake the sinking feeling or inconsistency that came with it. Lucas, who spent more time with him than anyone on the team, knew firsthand the negative effect the “chip on the shoulder” complex was having on the teenager.\n\n“Jabari had a hard time letting go of being the third pick,” Lucas said. “He was fighting things that were out of his control.”\n\nIn a 125-105 October drubbing on the road, which coincided with Smith’s third game as a pro, he had been awarded the Giannis assignment. It was a proud moment for Smith, going up against a player he had watched on television growing up, but he found himself in awe of the two-time MVP and NBA champion instead of focusing on the game plan.\n\nThat evening, Antetokounmpo schooled the rookie and steamrolled the Rockets en route to 44 points on just 21 shots in 28 minutes, with Smith incurring the brunt of the damage. It was such a mismatch that at one point sparingly used center Usman Garuba was forced to step up to the challenge.\n\nLucas wasn’t particularly pleased with how much Smith praised Antetokounmpo after their first meeting, so to prepare him mentally for the second go-around, Lucas opted for his favorite motivation tactic — reverse psychology.\n\nWith Smith’s teammates all in the room, Lucas told Smith he had Giannis sign a pair of sneakers and would gift them to Smith after the game, a gesture typically reserved for children or adoring fans. Lucas knew indirectly calling out Smith in front of his peers would annoy him, but more importantly, it would recalibrate his focus and ensure he was locked in.\n\n“He was really fired up for that game,” Lucas recalled.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Smith wanted to make it clear he was going to stick to Antetokounmpo. He was prepared to fight for every inch on the court. Houston didn’t want Milwaukee’s scheme to expose favorable matchups for Antetokounmpo and wanted to keep Smith latched on to him as much as possible.\n\nThe Rockets, like most other teams that have faced Giannis, had a specific defensive game plan that prioritized walling the forward on drives and forcing him to take as many outside jumpers as possible. But at its core, Houston’s strategy was to lean on Smith, who utilized his 7-fo0t-2 wingspan and aggression to become a 6-foot-11 irritant. And for one glorious night, it worked.\n\nIt was a rough scoring outing for Giannis, who finished with 16 points on 17 shots to go along with three costly turnovers. A frustration foul committed by Antetokounmpo on Smith with 18 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter was the encapsulation of a job well done by the rookie defender, and the elation on his face showed how much that moment meant to him. His impact was undeniable, and despite having a slow scoring night — six points on 1-of-9 shooting— Smith still managed to lead the team in plus/minus and rebounds while also chipping in three steals and a block. A night-and-day difference from their first matchup.\n\n“He had a couple really spectacular defensive games,” Rockets general manager Rafael Stone said of Smith. “I thought his best game of the season was when we played Milwaukee. He was just outstanding, and he didn’t even play well offensively.”\n\n“The first time we played them, I wasn’t prepared,” Smith told The Athletic. “I was amazed that I was playing against him. But the second time, I tried to challenge myself and compete with him, talk to my teammates and make it tough for him. It definitely wasn’t a one-man job, my teammates were locked in with me to build that wall. But me being on my Ps and Qs, reminding them he’s coming down full speed and we gotta be ready for him.”\n\nExamining Smith’s defensive performance as a rookie and parlaying that to future production takes myriad factors — advanced metrics, nuance and, importantly, context. Numbers alone won’t tell the story, especially when intertwined with the Rockets’ fiasco of a 2022-23 season.\n\nFor example, per Cleaning the Glass, the Rockets gave up nearly four more points with Smith on the floor versus when he was on the bench. That would slot him in the bottom quartile of defenders from last season — 16th percentile to be exact. Now, if Houston as a whole was an elite or even an average defensive unit, Smith’s impact would stick out. But given the Rockets were ineffective on that end of the floor as a unit, there’s more to be explored beyond the surface level.\n\nHouston’s top decision-makers have confidence in Smith’s defensive potential. During the course of the 2021-22 season, team scouts and representatives attended Smith’s Auburn games around the country. When they couldn’t view a game in person, they watched film or TV. During group sessions, his tape defending smaller guards was a constant. The Rockets’ draft contingent spoke with coaches of schools Smith played against and the consistent feedback painted the picture of a multi-purpose, multi-positional ball stopper. Not only could he function in a switch-heavy scheme (which new coach Ime Udoka has already started implementing), but also he could contain the action in front of him.\n\nWhen those attributes — along with his elite floor spacing — were combined with his frame, it was easy to see why Smith was touted as the top projected pick for months leading up to the 2022 draft.\n\n“It was essentially that he’s got the size of a center,” Stone said of the team’s predraft process. “(He’s) 6-11 with a 7-2 wingspan, very typical center size with a unique ability to move his feet on the perimeter. Particularly in the playoffs when people start switching everything more and more, he projected to be a really interesting big. He has the size to be a rim protector while at the same time can move on the perimeter like someone materially smaller.”\n\nAt the beginning of Smith’s rookie campaign, the organization was aware of his struggles with the physicality and the timing of the NBA, normal adjustments for teenagers making the jump from the collegiate game to the pros. Sometimes, he would get too handsy and find himself in early foul trouble. Other times, he was slow to closeouts and late to contests — or missed a key rotation altogether.\n\nBut with each passing game, the bright flashes stood out. The coaching staff continued to trust his versatility and used him in several ways. Per advanced metrics via the Bball Index, his three most common “assignments” were slashers (18.9 percent), secondary ballhandlers (17.9 percent) and primary ballhandlers (11.5 percent), comparable defensive profiles to players such as Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum and Jerami Grant. Position-wise, Smith spent the majority of his minutes defending power forwards (37.0 percent) and split the rest of his time with small forwards (21.2 percent), centers (15.0 percent), shooting guards (14.9 percent) and point guards (11.9 percent)\n\nNote: Defensive role versatility includes wing stopper, point-of-attack defender, anchor big, chaser, etc. Defensive position versatility refers to guarding different positions (point guards, small forwards, etc.).\n\nInternally, Houston tracked Smith’s individual impact and found after the All-Star break he was much more settled, which had a positive effect on his defense.\n\n“I definitely think he got better as the season went on,” Stone said. “To the extent to which he struggled was really with the physicality, which I thought also improved. And also the recognition, which almost all rookies really struggle with. Not when the ball’s in front of you or guarding the ball, but where you’re supposed to be on help, what’s coming, what actions the opposing team is trying to get to.”\n\nOne game that stood out to the front office was a March home win against the Boston Celtics. The Rockets deployed Smith at center, and he had one of the most complete games of his career — scoring 24 points on 9-of-11 shooting including 5 of 6 from 3. But it was on the defensive end where he really impressed, snagging 11 rebounds, recording a steal and a block and showcasing his full switching capabilities. He held his own whether he was protecting the paint or perimeter.\n\n“I came in with the intangibles to play defense, but now I feel like I’m learning different spots, learning where to be, tendencies, watching more film,” Smith said. “Going into the game knowing who I’m playing, their tendencies and stuff. The mental side of it is all coming together.”\n\nWhat will end up separating Smith from the rest of his draft class colleagues — and will elevate him into legitimate defensive conversations — is the work he puts in from this point onward. The “he’s just a rookie” excuses won’t cut it anymore, especially not with Udoka manning the sidelines.\n\nWhen Smith steps on a basketball court, it’s hard not to be impressed with his physical attributes. Rangy limbs that stretch across highways. Footwork more impressive than any one of Tamia’s line dances. A sturdy, slender frame that can withstand the pressure of a rebuild.\n\nBut being a top defender is much more than that. It takes work, sacrifice and film study. Attention to detail. Smith is his own biggest critic and loves to go back and watch his tape, picking up on things he might have missed in the heat of battle.\n\n“Every time I watch film before the game, I watch defensive clips,” Smith said. “If I open my feet up too much, closing out on different people. If it was something in the film session we talked about and I miss it, we’ll go over it in the next film session.”\n\nIn the possession below, Smith does a good job recognizing the Warriors calling a double drag for sharpshooter Klay Thompson and does his best to shoot the gap and dissuade him from launching. The end result, a missed layup, is good, but he momentarily lost Thompson, once at the top of the key and again on his dive to the rim. Smith’s length came in handy here.\n\n“That kid’s got a lot of talent and skill,” Warriors forward Draymond Green said. “He communicates on the court. He’s more mature than his years; it’s impressive to see.”\n\nAnother important nugget in Smith’s growth is the information he downloads from top defenders around the league. Not from simply speaking to them, but also by studying their games.\n\n“All of those guys who are just versatile defenders who guard the best wing on every team, who guard the best player on every team sometimes,” Smith said. “So just watching them and how much they take heart in their defense — because those guys are great offensive players as well. It’s easy to focus on one side of the ball and take plays off, but they seem not to do that, so that’s what I focus on.”\n\nThroughout the 2022-23 season, The Athletic asked a number of notable defenders for their advice for Smith on reaching their level of production, going from potential to prolific. Here’s what they had to say…\n\nMarcus Smart, guard, Memphis Grizzlies (Defensive Player of the Year 2022, three-time All-Defensive First Team, three-time Hustle Award)\n\nKeep going. This game is not catered to any defensive player. This game is all catered to the offensive players. Everything they do, they’ll always get the benefit of the doubt and you’re always going to get scrutinized as the defensive player. Just understanding that and continuing to keep going.\n\nLeBron James, forward, Los Angeles Lakers (five-time All-Defensive First Team, All-Defensive Second Team, four-time NBA champion)\n\nWork. Work. That’s all there is, man. There’s no substitution for work, man. He has a bright future.\n\nMikal Bridges, forward, Brooklyn Nets (All-Defensive First Team 2022)\n\nStay active. Watch film. Know when to be aggressive and when to be solid. A lot of guys in the league are really crafty offensively, getting foul calls and stuff. But just be solid, know when to be a little handsy and reach but be more solid on that end. Sometimes, guys will make tough shots. You just have to let it go over your head and get ready for the next play because you know guys are talented.\n\nJrue Holiday, guard, Milwaukee Bucks (three-time All-Defensive First Team, two-time All-Defensive Second Team, NBA champion)\n\nIt’s a little bit of everything. Mostly the effort — being able to want to get stops. I think genetically, it’s effort and putting in the time where you know players’ games. Know what they like to do, know their tendencies and from there, maneuver your way around it.\n\nMyles Turner, center, Indiana Pacers (two-time NBA blocks leader)\n\nTiming is everything and foul trouble is gonna be the biggest thing as a rookie. You’re gonna get a lot of foul trouble, a lot of questionable calls. But you just gotta be able to keep your head, keep your composure and continue to work on your timing and it’s just something that’s natural.\n\nCam Johnson, forward, Brooklyn Nets (fifth-year veteran defender)\n\nIt’s a continuous process. Pay attention to details. There’s a high level of awareness, whether it’s your position off the ball or how you’re guarding the player in front of you on the ball. There are layers to it. You can’t just guard everybody the exact same way. Understand the person you’re guarding.\n\nRoyce O’Neale, forward, Brooklyn Nets (seventh-year veteran defender)\n\nWatch a lot of film. Try to study guys as much as you can. This league has a lot of great scorers and different guys like doing different things. Learn and watch other guys. Don’t be afraid to ask guys who are defenders how they guard certain people and little tips like that.\n\nDraymond Green, forward, Golden State Warriors (four-time All-Defensive First Team, four-time All-Defensive Second Team, four-time NBA champion)\n\nI think it’s a will to be great on that side of the ball. Studying and just understanding what opponents want to do. For me, that was my way on the court. That’s what I had to do to become an NBA player essentially.\n\nYou just gotta study. Watch the game. And it can’t just be full. You gotta watch basketball. When you watch a lot of basketball, you pick up on stuff you’re not even aware that you’re picking up on. Just love and embrace the game.\n\n(Illustration: Sean Reilly / The Athletic; photos: Jason Miller, Adam Hagy, Logan Riely, Justin Ford / Getty Images)"
