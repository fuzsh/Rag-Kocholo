        "text": "When basketball historians look back on the wild free-agent summer of 2019 they’ll debate over which player was quoted as saying, “free agency has been tough because I feel like in some ways the NBA has kind of given up on me.”\n\nThey’ll ask “was it Jeremy Lin, Carmelo Anthony, J.R. Smith or all of the above?”\n\nIt’s not a trick question. Of course, the answer is Lin, who through tears and a little self-pity bemoaned his unemployed status recently at a speaking event in Taiwan. Lin is being way too hard on himself. He recently won an NBA title as a third guard on the Toronto Raptors. And with career earnings exceeding $60 million, Lin, undrafted out of Harvard, defied incredibly long odds to make it and survive this long. Plus, his playing career isn’t over. There is still a possibility Lin will find his way onto an NBA roster or he may decide to play overseas. Just imagine Lin’s earning potential and popularity if he were to sign with a team in China.\n\nBut today, one month after the frenzy of June 30, Lin finds himself in the same sinking boat with Anthony and Smith, two former teammates from his Linsanity days with the New York Knicks. Has the NBA given up on Anthony and Smith? We’ll soon find out. Anthony and Smith haven’t appeared in an NBA game since November and, like Lin, they’re waiting for an opportunity to prove they still have something to offer.\n\nSmith recently worked out for the Milwaukee Bucks and was considered an option until Kyle Korver agreed to a deal. Smith’s brother recently hinted that J.R. could be joining Carmelo’s former team, the Houston Rockets. Until then, Smith waits, trains and plays golf.\n\nAnthony has been training on his own since being exiled by the Rockets not long after he scored 28 points in a road win against the Brooklyn Nets. The timing was odd and the reasons are still unclear. Anthony appeared to embrace his role as a scoring forward off the bench and had apparently found a home with a contending team. But the experiment ended abruptly and not even his influential friend and Rockets teammate, Chris Paul, could save Carmelo from being banished for good.\n\nAnthony has gone underground as he plots his comeback. There have been a few public appearances but even fewer comments from one of the feared scorers of his generation. Instead, Melo has others speaking about him or for him and it has been damaging.\n\nIn July, Anthony’s former teammate in Denver and New York, Chauncey Billups, told SiriusXM NBA Radio that “scoring 30 meant too much to Melo.” Being called selfish during free agency by a high profile former teammate isn’t the type of endorsement Anthony needed. Likewise, Anthony’s trainer, Chris Brickely, didn’t do his famous client any favors when he told the popular New York morning radio show “The Breakfast Club” that “Melo just wants to have a final season, a farewell season, do what D-Wade did. Do the jersey swap.”\n\nThat ill-timed statement opens Anthony to unfair ridicule. A team should use a roster spot on Carmelo because he wants to enhance his souvenir collection during a farewell tour? Anthony would be better served speaking for himself and letting potential suitors know that he’d be content with any role and that he believes he can help a contender. That’s the message he should want out there.\n\n“Can he still play? That’s what teams want to know,” said one NBA coach whose team has had internal conversations about pursuing Anthony. “It can’t be about a farewell tour.”\n\nWhen I asked one Eastern Conference general manager if Anthony or Lin has a better chance of being in the NBA next season, he replied: “Depends on if LeBron (James) has a roster spot left.”\n\nAh yes, if only Carmelo had a relationship with a powerful superstar on a contending team. The same GM then modified his answer and said “if a team suffers an injury at point guard, Jeremy is the most likely alternative other than Shaun Livingston. Ranking 289th in win shares doesn’t help Jeremy. And he has struggled to defend his position.”\n\nIf this is it for Lin he goes out with a championship ring. Smith earned his with the Cavs while Anthony only made one trip to the conference finals, with the Denver Nuggets. Lin will always have Linsanity, that magical but all-too-brief stretch in the winter of 2012 when he was the talk of the NBA. He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated for back-to-back weeks and had the Garden eating out of the palm of his hand.\n\nLin’s sudden emergence also created unrest in the locker room. Anthony didn’t like standing in the corner watching Lin become an overnight sensation. Soon Mike D’Antoni lost his job, Lin suffered a knee injury and when July rolled around, Garden Chairman James Dolan elected not to match the offer sheet Lin signed with the Rockets.\n\nYou may remember Anthony calling it a “ridiculous contract” while Smith said that if the Knicks matched the offer it would cause problems in the locker room. They just can’t have nice things at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut today, seven years after they were together in New York, Anthony, Lin and Smith are equals; unemployed and wondering if the NBA has given up on them.\n\n(Top Photo: Jim McIsaac/Getty Images)"
