        "text": "On Wednesday night, the Houston Rockets dropped their third straight, falling to the Atlanta Hawks, 134-127 in a game in which they fought back from double digit deficits. Despite the disappointing loss, there was a silver lining: sophomore forward Jabari Smith Jr., the third overall pick in the 2022 draft, exploded for a career night, scoring 34 points and grabbing 13 rebounds, to go along with four blocked shots. It was the latest achievement in what has been a highly encouraging second season for the 6’11 forward.\n\nOn the year, Smith is averaging 13.2 points and 8.8 rebounds on 48% shooting overall, and 36.9% from long distance. The improvement has been striking after a disappointing rookie season in which Smith shot just 40.8% overall and 30.7% on 3s. Smith took 4.9 three-point attempts per game for Stephen Silas’ Rockets; he’s now taking 4.4 three-point attempts.\n\nIn addition, Smith’s defense has dramatically improved under head coach Ime Udoka, with the versatile forward often shouldering the burden of covering for difficult matchups for Rockets center Alperen Sengun. Udoka has asked a lot of Smith this season and Smith has matured and delivered.\n\nStill, despite the improvement, per cleaningtheglass.com, the Rockets have been outscored by 9.4 points per 100 possessions in Smith’s 758 minutes, the second worst mark on the team amongst its regular rotation players. (Jalen Green, at -13.6 points per 100 possessions is the worst). Tari Eason, the team’s primary backup forward, has the highest net rating on the team, with the Rockets outscoring opponents by 16.9 points per 100 possessions in his 351 minutes thus far this season.\n\nAfter being drafted, Smith signed a four-year, $40.33 million contract which keeps him with the Rockets through the 2025-2026. The Rockets exercised their option on Smith’s third year, 2024-2025, on October 30, 2023. Their deadline to exercise the option on his fourth year, 2025-2026, is October 31, 2024. Smith earns $8.82 million this season pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement’s rookie scale. He is extension eligible the summer after next.\n\nThe team hopes that Smith, Sengun, and Eason form a frontline that can stay together through the team’s next era. Dillon Brooks is currently the team’s starter at small forward after signing a four-year, $86 million contract this summer but he will eventually be supplanted by Eason.\n\nFor now, Smith and Sengun continue developing chemistry. The Rockets couldn’t be happier, especially after Wednesday night’s performance."
