        "text": "HOUSTON (AP) — Marcus Camby is returning to New York, while the Houston Rockets continue to reshape their roster.\n\nThe 38-year-old Camby agreed Monday to rejoin the Knicks in a deal that sends three players and two second-round draft picks to Houston, according to a person with direct knowledge of the move.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because neither team has announced the trade.\n\nYahoo Sports reported that Camby's deal was for three years and $13.2 million.\n\nThe Rockets will get guard Toney Douglas, centers Josh Harrelson and Jerome Jordan and second-round picks in 2014 and ‘15.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 Camby, meanwhile, will be back in New York where he played from 1998-2002.\n\nDouglas played in 38 games last season, starting only nine, and averaged 6.2 points and 2.0 assists. The 6-10, 275-pound Harrelson was a second-round pick by New Orleans in 2011 and was traded to the Knicks. He appeared in 37 games and averaged 4.4 points and 3.9 rebounds. The 7-foot Jordan, a native of Jamaica, averaged 5 minutes in 21 games last season.\n\nThough Camby has battled injuries during his NBA career, he remains a productive rebounder and shot blocker even after 16 seasons. He also drew interest from Miami and New Jersey but made his destination clear on Twitter, with a simple posting of \"NY\" on Monday afternoon.\n\nCamby helped the Knicks make a surprising run to the 1999 NBA Finals in his first season in New York. The No. 2 overall pick in the 1996 draft and a native of nearby Connecticut became a fan favorite before the Knicks dealt him Denver in 2002. He should become a valuable backup at center to Tyson Chandler, last season's NBA Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nHe becomes the second nearly 40-something to join the Knicks this summer, with Jason Kidd agreeing to go to New York last week. The deals cannot become official until today.\n\nThe Knicks had announced earlier Monday that all three players going to Houston would headline their summer league roster.\n\nSmith staying in New York\n\nNEW YORK — The Knicks are keeping another key member of their rotation with JR Smith deciding to re-sign.\n\nSmith's agent confirms the deal that was agreed to early Tuesday. Smith had declined a $2.5 million option for next season, because doing so meant he could earn slightly more. But the New Jersey native had hoped to return to the Knicks.\n\nSmith joined the team in February after playing in China during the lockout and averaged 12.5 points, right at his career average. The 6-foot-6 guard joins Steve Novak, who agreed to terms Monday, in returning to the Knicks. Both were reserves last season, but Smith could become a starter if the Knicks don't match an offer sheet Landry Fields plans to sign with Toronto."
