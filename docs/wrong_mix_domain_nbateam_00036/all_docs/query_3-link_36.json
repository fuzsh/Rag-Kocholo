        "text": "Early life and collegiate career\n\nHarden was born in Los Angeles to Monja Willis and James Harden, Sr., but was largely raised by his mother. The family—which includes a sister and a half brother—lived in Compton, California. Harden initially focused on baseball, playing first base and pitching. However, at about age 10 he fell in love with basketball while playing for a recreational team in the Watts district of Los Angeles. Harden attended Artesia High School in nearby Lakewood, California, and he led the school to back-to-back state championships as a junior and senior, averaging almost 19 points per game both years.\n\nHarden was recruited by a number of major Pac-10 (later Pac-12) schools, including the University of Washington, University of Arizona, and University of California at Los Angeles. He ultimately signed with the Arizona State Sun Devils. During his freshman year (2007–08), he averaged 17.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game and led the conference in steals. Harden was named to the Pac-10’s first team and all-freshman team. Harden’s play was even stronger the following season, as he averaged 20.1 points and 4.2 assists per game. He was named the Pac-10’s Player of the Year and was a consensus All-American. After the Sun Devils lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament, Harden declared for the NBA draft.\n\nNBA\n\nHarden was selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder as the third overall pick in the draft. Although not a starter in his first season (2009–10), he came off the bench to play in 76 games and netted an average of 9.9 points. At the season’s conclusion, Harden was named to the All-Rookie second team. He continued to come off the bench the next two seasons, and in 2011–12 he put up almost 17 points per game along with 3.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds. That season the Thunder advanced to the NBA finals but lost to the Miami Heat in five games. Harden was named the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year, which acknowledges the league’s most effective bench player. In 2012 he was also a member of the U.S. men’s basketball team that won a gold medal at the London Olympics. During this time Harden was receiving attention not only for his play but also for his full beard, which became his signature look.\n\nIn the offseason Oklahoma City offered Harden a four-year, $55 million contract extension, which he rejected. Shortly before the start of the 2012–13 regular season, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, who immediately signed him to a five-year, $80 million contract extension. Expected to be a central player on the team, Harden moved from the bench to the starting lineup. He rewarded the Rockets’ gamble, as he posted 25.9 points per game and was named an NBA All-Star for the first time. That year Houston made the playoffs for the first time in four years, though the team lost in the first round. In the 2014–15 season Harden registered 27.4 points per game and upped his assists to 7 as he finished second (behind Stephen Curry) in voting for the MVP award. Despite not finding much playoff success, the Harden-led Rockets became one of the league’s winningest teams in the 2010s.\n\nIn the 2017–18 season Harden scored 30.4 points and tallied 8.8 assists per game, and he won his first MVP award. That season he also won the NBA scoring title for the first time. His hot streak continued, as he scored 36.1 and 34.3 points per game in the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons, respectively. In both seasons he again led the league in scoring. Part of Harden’s success has been due to his three-point shot, in which he takes a step back before releasing the basketball. The step-back three-pointer has become hugely popular in the sport, and it has dramatically increased the number of three-pointers taken—and made.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

This led Harden to demand a trade in 2020, and early the next year he was sent to the Brooklyn Nets. In a more limited role, Harden continued to put up solid numbers, though he began to deal with hamstring issues. The Nets struggled to find playoff success despite their star-studded roster—which included his Thunder teammate Kevin Durant—and midway through the 2021–22 season Harden was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. There he was paired with dominant big man Joel Embiid, and Harden played well in the 2022–23 season. Although he missed his first All-Star team after 10 straight selections, he reached a near-career-high in assists with 10.7 in his new supporting role. However, after a playoff loss in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Harden requested a trade in August 2023, and in October he was sent to the Los Angeles Clippers."
