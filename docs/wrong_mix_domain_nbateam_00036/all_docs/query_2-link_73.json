        "text": "With the NBA Draft approaching on Thursday, Auburn basketball forward Jabari Smith Jr. is among the top three prospects that have been shuffled around the top spot on mock drafts for months along with Gonzaga's Chet Holmgren and Duke's Paolo Banchero.\n\nThe Rookie Wire's latest mock draft has tabbed Smith at No. 1 overall to the Orlando Magic. Several Magic players were in attendance for Smith's private workout with the team on June 9.\n\nThe draft will take place at 6:30 p.m. CT on ESPN. The first round will also be broadcast on ABC.\n\nMAKING THE CASE: Why should Auburn basketball's Jabari Smith be No. 1 pick in 2022 NBA Draft? Start with this stat\n\nPRE-DRAFT PROCESS: Auburn basketball's Jabari Smith worked out with only 2 teams before NBA Draft. Here's why\n\nEXPERTS: After NBA lottery, where experts project Auburn basketball's Jabari Smith in mock drafts\n\nHere are three things to know about Smith:\n\nBruce Pearl said he's the best player he's ever coached\n\nIt's high praise from the seasoned coaching veteran, who has coached NBA players like Tobias Harris and Isaac Okoro over his 20 years of coaching experience. Pearl proudly bestowed that title on Smith on the College Hoops Daily podcast with Jon Rothstein.\n\n\"Jabari is the best I’ve ever coached,\" Pearl said. \"He’s put himself in this position to be successful. He is as good of a jump shooter as I’ve seen in college basketball in a long, long time.\"\n\nSmith averaged 16 points and seven rebounds per game for an Auburn team that was ranked No. 1 for several weeks throughout the season. He was named a consensus All-American and made First Team All-SEC.\n\nIf he goes No. 1, he won't be the first in the family\n\nThough he is a distant cousin, former top overall pick Kwame Brown is on Smith's extended family tree according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Brown was taken first in 2001 by the Washington Wizards. He ultimately would not live up to the lofty expectations of a No. 1 pick, but Brown played over 600 games in a long NBA career.\n\nAvid NBA fans may remember Jabari Smith Sr., who played for the Sacramento Kings, Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets from 2000-05, but Sr. was selected in the second round of the draft.\n\nIf Orlando calls Smith Jr. to make him their franchise cornerstone, there's someone in the family he can lean on for that unique experience.\n\nHe added 20 pounds of muscle in one year\n\nWhen Smith arrived at Auburn in 2021, the talent was obvious, but Pearl pushed him to put on some weight. Pearl told The Ringer he would check with Smith about his progress five times a week in the summer and fall.\n\nThe freshman weighed about 200 pounds and is now listed at 220. Pearl said he's not done growing into his frame either, claiming he could add up to 30 more pounds over the course of his career."
