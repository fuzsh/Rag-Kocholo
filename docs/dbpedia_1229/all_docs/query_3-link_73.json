        "text": "Best Type Of Jumping Spider Terrariums\n\nWhen selecting a terrarium for your jumping spiders, one of the biggest considerations should be the size.\n\nYour terrarium should be at least ten times bigger than the spider, with plenty of open space to move around.\n\nMake sure the terrarium is outfitted with sturdy lids and locks to prevent escape attempts and potential harm to your pet.\n\nFurthermore, you’ll want to look for terrariums with adequate ventilation and a modest amount of humidity, both of which can help keep your pet jumping spider receiving fresh flowing air.\n\nCreate the perfect home for your arachnid with our Customizable Spider Enclosure Kits, designed to meet all their habitat needs.\n\nBest Jumping Spider Substrate\n\nWhen considering the terrarium substrate for your pet jumping spider’s enclosure, look for a natural type such as cypress mulch, vermicompost, coco fiber soil, peat moss, and leaves.\n\nA substrate mix like this will mimic the natural habitat your pet jumper would find in the wild.\n\nYou may also want to add a few hiding places like vivarium wood, small stones, and plants for your pet to explore and keep them busy.\n\nMake sure your substrate is free of pesticides or other chemicals, as these can be harmful to your pet arachnid.\n\nOur Bioactive species-specific soil mixes are specially formulated to meet the needs of various arachnid species, providing an optimal balance of moisture and nutrients.\n\nBest Plants For Jumping Spiders\n\nWhen it comes to terrarium plants, look for plants that are easy to maintain and provide plenty of shelter and hiding spots for jumping spiders.\n\nterrarium moss, mini ferns, and vining plants are all great choices for adding a natural feel to your tank.\n\nMake sure to avoid any plants that could be potentially toxic to your spiders, such as citronella.\n\nOnce more, avoid adding too many living plants as this could create high levels of humidity, which can be harmful to some species of jumping spiders.\n\nProper Pet Jumping Spider Care\n\nTaking care of pet jumping spiders requires more than just food and water.\n\nTo ensure optimal health and well-being for your pet spider, you’ll need to provide the right environment and habitat.\n\nMake sure the vivarium is kept out of direct sunlight and kept at an even temperature.\n\nAdditionally, mist the enclosure with a spray bottle at least twice a week to create humidity and offer retreats and foraging opportunities for your pet jumpers.\n\nHabitat Requirements\n\nHabitat requirements for pet jumping spiders should include a comfortable substrate for them to climb and explore on, as well as appropriate hiding spots for them to go to when stressed.\n\nAdditionally, to provide enrichment for your pet, you’ll want to add branches and tropical plants for your pet to jump between.\n\nFinally, make sure to keep the terrarium uncluttered to provide plenty of space for your jumping spider to move around freely.\n\nHandling\n\nWhen it comes to handling pet jumping spiders, I recommend going slow and being gentle.\n\nAs they can be easily startled, you should always move slowly around your spider and try to avoid sudden movements.\n\nWhen handling your pet arachnid, you may want to wear gloves to ensure your hands are completely covered and to provide a sense of security for your pet.\n\nNever grab your pet jumping spider, and instead use a moistened cotton swab to scoop them up and move them where you would like them to go.\n\nFeeding & Supplementation\n\nIt‘s important to keep your pet jumping spider properly fed.\n\nMost species enjoy small insects such as crickets, locusts, and mealworms. It’s best to feed your pet in the evening when it’s more active.\n\nIt’s also recommended that you gut load the insects to provide your spider with the essential vitamins and nutrients it needs.\n\nFinally, you’ll want to ensure that you’re feeding the spider the right–sized insects, as feeding it too large of an insect can be dangerous.\n\nIf you’re looking for a more detailed approach to feeding these critters, be sure to check out my ultimate DIY jumping spider food guide. I give a more in-depth explanation of the best foods and my favorite recipe.\n\nConclusion\n\nPet jumping spiders are low–maintenance and fun companions that can provide you with hours of enjoyment.\n\nIf you are looking for a unique and interesting pet, these spiders are well worth considering. With the right setup and care, jumping spiders are sure to be a welcome addition to any home.\n\nNot to mention, you don‘t have to worry about taking them for walks or giving them baths. So why not open your home to one of these trendy little creatures and enjoy the amazing acrobatics they put on each day?\n\nCreate the ideal habitat for your arachnids with our species-specific soil mixes and Spider Enclosure Kits. These products provide everything you need for a thriving spider habitat."
