The rapid growth of #geothermal power plants is due to their great potential and environmentally friendly energy source. In its development, #hydrogen is used as #energystorage for several intermittent renewable energy sources. Hydrogen Steam Superheating utilizing hydrogen products can pressure steam as additional fuel to operate steam turbines. The electrolysis method with high-temperature water fluid produces more hydrogen content and is more efficient than ambient temperature water; therefore, it is suitable for producing superheating hydrogen steam by electrolysis using geothermal power plants.

The issue with solar stills is that the temperature of the cover glass is quite high, which consequently reduces the rate of evaporation. Methods to reduce the cover glass temperature involve water cooling, by flowing water and spraying it onto the cover glass. Both of these methods have been shown to reduce the temperature of the cover glass, but they still require additional energy and can decrease the solar radiation energy received by the absorber plate. This research proposes using a water cooling method on the wall that does not require additional energy and can prevent a reduction in the solar radiation energy received by the absorber plate. Experimental and theoretical research was conducted to study the effect of using DSSS.WCW. The results showed a 13.48 % reduction in the cover glass temperature, consequently increasing the temperature difference between the fins and the cover glass by 9.82 °C. The increase in temperature difference resulted in a 13.82 % increase in freshwater productivity theoretically by 2.80 kg/hour and a 13.10 % increase experimentally for the DSSS.WCW by 2.58 kg/hour. In addition, there was a theoretical increase in energy efficiency of 22.29 % and an experimental increase of 22.82 %, along with an increase in exergy efficiency of 15.71 %. The implementation of water cooling on the wall has been shown to enhance the efficiency of the double-slope solar still. In addition, the water cooling method on the wall does not reduce the solar radiation energy that can be received by the absorber plate and does not require additional energy. The results of this research can be applied in remote islands in Indonesia, particularly during the dry season\n\n[Net Zero Hero Monthly Recap – Renewable Energy Program with AMATI Indonesia and GAWIREA (MSIB Kampus Merdeka Batch 6)] This May I learned many new things as a participant in the Independent Study Program from Amati Indonesia and GAWIREA. I took several classes, including: - Ansys Introduction: Acknowledge the basic of projects simulation - Final Idea + Pitching class - No Time to Waste: Advancing Low-Carbon Solutions in Municipal Solid Water Management - Green YOUTH Showlution Additionally, I am interested in the Final Idea + Pitching class, because is the most important class for preparing for Demo Day. This is the final chapter of projects that we have prepared while at PT Amati Indonesia. I hope that the project can solve problems in one of the regions in Indonesia. #KampusMerdeka#MSIB#StudentIndependent#AmatiIndonesia#WallaceaProject#JagaWallaceaJagaIndon#NetZeroHero\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gVU3HGRn Published article: Challenge and Readiness to Implemented Geothermal Energy in Indonesia Author: Endah Murtiana Sari Abstract: Many countries have used various strategies in the effort toward transition to alternative energy as a solution in developing renewable energy. Indonesia is the second largest producer of geothermal energy in the world. The potential of Indonesia lies in the Ring of Fire along with 117 active volcanoes, giving Indonesia high geothermal potential. This research aims to reveal and formulate the potential of geothermal as renewable energy in Indonesia as an alternative energy to be used in the future. The methods in this research are qualitative and quantitative. Through the quantitative method, this research will present secondary data from various organizations as well as data from prior research on geothermal potential in the world. While qualitative method will formulate ideas of several geothermal usages from many countries by using comparison from prior research and literature from journals, books, and other publication sources. Qualitative research results will also come from in-depth interviews with stakeholders that have implemented geothermal energy in Indonesia. The result of this research will illustrate the importance of geothermal energy as an alternative renewable energy in Indonesia to replace crude oil resources as the main natural resource in Indonesia. This research recommends the mapping of resources, requiring technology as a breakthrough in processing geothermal energy to take it directly from the reservoir because of its unorthodox classification based on its source as well the cost and benefit impact on the economy related to consumer mapping to detect early the market changes of energy to geothermal. #Futureenergy #Geothermal #Indonesia #Renewableenergy #Ringoffire #Sustainableenergy #AgriculturalEngineering #AppliedEngineering #ArtificialIntelligence #Automation #AutomationEngineering #BiomedicalEngineering #ControlEngineering #Dynamics #ElectronicsEngineering #EnergyEngineering #EngineeringDesign #EngineeringManagement #EngineeringOptimization #FoundationEngineering #IndustrialEngineering #InformationEngineering #Laser #Machining #MaterialsEngineering #MechanicalEngineering #MechatronicsEngineering #NetworkEngineering #OpticalEngineering #PowerEngineering #ProcessEngineering #QualityEngineering #Sensors #SignalProcessing #SoftwareEngineering\n\nThe introduction of Indonesia’s first-ever marine floating solar power plant, Solar2Wave, aims to reduce dependence on diesel-fueled power plants and provide daily electrical requirements for the people. Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Cranfield University, Universitas Pattimura, Orela Shipyard, PT Gerbang Multindo Nusantara, Achelous Energy, and HelioRec, the masterminds behind the prototype, worked with the vision to expand floating power plants from the shackles of lakes to the expanse of the seas. Throughout the testing stage, from March 2023 to February 2024, the project faced hurdles such as weather complexities and uncontrollable ocean wave conditions. Therefore, the Solar2Wave prototype, funded by Innovate UK, has an inbuilt system to troubleshoot wave-related issues. It consists of 6 monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels, an energy storage system, and is resistant to weathering, all of which would help tap into Indonesia’s vast marine resources. #solarpowerplant #marinefloatingsolarpowerplant #solar2wave #institutteknologisepuluhnopember #cranfielduniversity #universitaspattimura #orelashipyard"
