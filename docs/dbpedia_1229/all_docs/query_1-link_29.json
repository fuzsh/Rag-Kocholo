        "text": "As New York City gears up for the implementation of its Central Business District Tolling Program in 2024, opinions are divided among New Yorkers. Some see it as a necessary step towards reducing traffic congestion and funding transit improvements, while others are concerned about the cost implications. The program, also known as congestion pricing, is set to charge drivers a toll for entering Manhattan south of and including 60th Street. With toll rates varying by vehicle type and time of day, the initiative aims to decrease traffic, improve air quality, and enhance public transportation. In Canada, only Vancouver City is considering a mobility pricing (similar to congestion pricing) for vehicles entering downtown. #NYC #CongestionPricing #TransitImprovement #UrbanPlanning #vancouver #mobilitypricing\n\nA century-long dream comes to fruition! The Biden administration, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg's support, is kick-starting the long-dormant Phase Two of the Second Avenue subway project in Manhattan. This extension will bring Q trains up to East Harlem, benefiting over 100,000 daily riders. The federal government is providing an historic $3.4 billion for this phase, which includes stations at 106th Street, 116th Street, and a new terminal at 125th Street with connections to the 4, 5, 6 trains and Metro North. ‚ÄúIt's going towards a public transit project serving neighborhoods that have been neglected for years ensuring East Harlem has greater access to jobs, health care and other essential services‚Äù said Sen. Chuck Schumer. ‚ÄúThis is uptown Grand Central,\" Congressman Adriano Espaillat said. \"Finally, it's a day of reckoning. Finally, people recognize that this is a community that matters,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said. The project aims to transform East Harlem's transit system, which has faced neglect for decades. It's expected to reduce commute times by up to 20 minutes for many riders. #NYCSubway #SecondAvenueSubway #PhaseTwo #PublicTransit #Infrastructure #BidenAdministration #EastHarlem #MTA #Transportation #TransportationEquity #RacialEquity Several videos and renderings in URL\n\nHow exactly is MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) going to build all these new stations when they have already had to cannibalize the budgets of other #transit projects, like the Campbellton Road and Clifton Corridor light rail proposals, to pay for the Eastside Atlanta BeltLine streetcar scheme? If the Beltline streetcar moves forward, there is no way that these infill stations are built in the City of Atlanta in our lifetimes. Just to be clear, the infill stations make sense to me. The $100-million-plus-per-mile streetcar no longer does, given the Beltline‚Äôs importance as a corridor for those who are #walking or riding #bikes and other #micromobility. https://lnkd.in/e5JTDDGS\n\n‚è± The land is just sitting there... quietly waiting. This could be the North's third most connected #rail station after Piccadilly and Leeds. The linchpin of the #NorthernPowerhouse Rail network. Not only the most logical site for the beginning of a new intercity Castlefield Bypass tunnel via Piccadilly, but also an ideal interchange. üìç Strategically located to improve access to North Manchester, #MediaCityUK and #SalfordQuays, with connections to the #BeeNetwork rail and tram lines, the site is crying out for an interchange station. üöÑ #HS2 should absolutely be completed to Manchester, however in the mean time we have to start sorting out the bottleneck which plans via #ManchesterAirport don't adequately address. We need to remove all the fast services, not just a couple. By starting the new #NPR network here with a more incremental approach, passengers across the north would begin to feel benefits sooner, as will the economy. It's developments like this that would spur on #agglomeration and #redevelopment benefits. #ModularIncrementalism could perhaps be the way forward in these turbulent times? And it might just, with strategic thinking, deliver an even better solution for the #North. üòâ What are your thoughts? #Manchester #Liverpool #Leeds #CrossNorth #NorthOnTrack\n\nResidents & businesses invited to South Main Street Corridor Study Open House March 13! The Town of Wake Forest is in the process of conducting a study to evaluate the access and mobility along the South Main Street/US 1A corridor. Upon completion, the initiative will recommend ways to improve the safety, comfort, access, and multimodal mobility for everyone that uses the corridor, including drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Public input is a major component of the South Main Street Corridor Study. Area residents are invited to attend an open house Wednesday, March 13, from 6-8 p.m. at the front entrance of The Factory, 1839 S. Main St. During the open house, attendees will be presented with two high-level concepts for improving traffic and safety along the South Main Street/US 1A corridor. These concepts are designed to mitigate several of the traffic and safety concerns expressed by the public and transform the corridor into an attractive, green gateway into the heart of Wake Forest. The March 13 session will have an informal, open house-style format, so attendees may drop in anytime from 6-8 p.m. to view displays, ask questions, and share comments. South Main Street/US 1A is an NCDOT-owned and maintained roadway extending from Capital Boulevard/US1 to South Ave, with the study focusing on the roadway between Capital Boulevard/US1 to Dr. Calvin Jones Highway/NC 98 Bypass.‚Äù As one of the major vehicular connections in Town, the corridor is heavily travelled. Uncontrolled access and limited multimodal infrastructure have created significant safety concerns throughout the corridor. The 2019 Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) indicated high levels of crashes on the corridor. Scheduled for completion later this year, the South Main Street Corridor Study has two main goals: 1) Evaluate existing roadway capacity and volume, safety, future traffic growth, impacts to cultural and historic resources, and multi-modal access; and 2) Provide a high-level concept design of the entire corridor with recommended solutions for access management, intersections, and multi-modal connectivity along the corridor. For more information and updates about the South Main Street Corridor Study, visit wakeforestnc.gov and search ‚ÄúSouth Main Street Study‚Äù or contact Long Range Planning Manager Brad West at 919-435-9542 or bwest@wakeforestnc.gov. #TownofWakeForest #WakeForestNC #TOWFplanning\n\nWith all of the talk about the Rozelle Interchange, I think it's important to remember what the community, particularly in the Inner West, were promised at the project's inception. The entire Westconnex was based in part on the premise of placing traffic essentially underground to free up Victoria Road and Parramatta Road as 'boulevards' - with better urban amenity and more public transport. I keep seeing \"7 lanes to 4 now 10 lanes to 4\" causing traffic issues cited in media. Is this not our opportunity to go back to 7, but this time, by returning lanes back to people, and making Victoria Road and Parramatta Road streets again? We seem to be at risk of forgetting that this was to be an integrated solution to improving Sydney's urban fabric. #roads #traffic #trafficmanagement #nswgovernment #cityplanning #urbanplanning #sydney https://lnkd.in/grzWDF2k"
