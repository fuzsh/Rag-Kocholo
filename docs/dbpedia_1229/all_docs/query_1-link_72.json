        "text": "MK Sports Cars was founded by Martin Keenan and has recently moved to Rayne, Essex. It offers the Lotus Seven style kit car MK Indy.[1] The MK Indy is available in four different designs - these are the Indy, Indy R and Indy RR and more recently the RX-5. The kits offer the option of various engines from cars and motorbikes.\n\nThe term \"Indy\" comes from the independent rear suspension which in its design was cutting edge at the time of inception.\n\nThe vehicles models can be identified in the following differing characteristics;\n\nIndy - This is the original iconic design which features outboard front shocks and a square box section space frame chassis. Based on the Ford Sierra, this model used the steering rack, front uprights, steering column, diff, driveshafts and rear uprights from the donor car.\n\nIndy R - Designed for the road and track, this model designed in 2008 using CAD simulation features inboard push rod front suspension and a combination of rounded and square tube for the space frame chassis. Based again on the Ford Sierra, this model also uses the same donor parts as the Indy.\n\nIndy RR - Designed for the race track, this model is the inboard front suspension Indy R model, but differs by having fully rose jointed wishbones for granular adjustments for camber, caster and toe. This is also based on the Ford Sierra.\n\nIndy RX-5 - The latest model in the range, this model was CAD designed in 2017 by Dave Flavell. Based on the Mazda MX-5 or Miata, this model uses all the running gear from the Mazda. The RX-5 features inboard front suspension and a space frame chassis constructed of rounded and square tube. Designed for the road and track, this model uses poly bush fixings for the wishbones rather than the rose joints of the Indy RR. Out of the box, this model boasts 6 degrees of caster and coupled with a 2.4 turn lock to lock \"quick\" steering rack, a very adequate feel on the tarmac.\n\nDimensionally, all models are the same and share the same fibreglass bodywork panels, however, the suspension and donor vehicles make each of the models unique.\n\nMidy - a mid engined sevenesque car.[2]\n\nMK also designed the Spire GT-R, an evolvement of MK's own GT1.[3]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]\n\nMedia related to MK vehicles at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website"
