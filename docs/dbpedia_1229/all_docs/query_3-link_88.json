        "text": "Expansion of Pangi and Keruak Corridors\n\nThis project is focused on the creation of two corridors located in the Kinabatangan floodplain. These include the Keruak Species Corridor and the Keruak Virgin Jungle Reserve.\n\nThe Keruak Species Corridor has been supported by WLT since 2013, and aims to establish a 182-hectare riverine forest corridor to connect two fragmented protected areas near the village of Sukau.\n\nThe Keruak Virgin Jungle Reserve corridor project also involves the purchasing of land to buffer and protect the southwest corner of Pangi Virgin Jungle Reserve.\n\nBoth corridors are located within the Kinabatangan floodplain and their creation will enable species to move freely along the Kinabatangan River and ensure their long-term survival. The projects also tackle the erosion of riverbanks, which will protect local freshwater fisheries to the benefit of local communities for whom the river is a primary socio-economic asset and has been relied upon for centuries to provide people with fish, their main source of protein.\n\nIn addition to 10 permanent staff, HUTAN supports six to ten paid intern positions for month long period to other women from local communities to join the team. As well as learning reforestation methods the trainees participate in a year-long environmental education programme by HUTAN to raise awareness on the need of conserving natural habitat for species.\n\nExplore Aangi and Keruak Corridors in more detail with our interactive map\n\nReforestation at Genting Species Corridor\n\nSince 2019, HUTAN has been working to restore the Genting Species Corridor in the Kinabatangan floodplain in Sabah state. This unique initiative involves the restoration of former palm oil plantations and will expand the Genting Corridor by 45 hectares. In so doing, it will enlarge the Lower Kinabatangan Species Sanctuary. The corridor will also enable species to move freely along the Kinabatangan River. In so doing, these efforts will reduce occurrences of human-species conflicts in the area. The trees planted through this restoration process include those that are native and fast-growing, and are selected to produce fruits and other edible parts for orang-utans and other species.\n\nThis project involves a collaboration and partnership between HUTAN, the Sukau community, the Sabah State Government, and the oil palm-producing company Genting Plantations.\n\nWithout the intervention of this project, this forest habitat would not recover on its own from the effects of oil palm production. The Kinabantangan floodplain has already lost 80% of its natural forest to palm oil plantations. The resulting fragmentation of the remaining habitat has led to around two-thirds of the 215 species of mammals found in the state of Sabah to be considered of conservation concern. It has also caused the isolation of certain species’ populations and disrupts migration routes, particularly for elephants. As a result, there are more frequent encounters between humans and non-human species which can lead to conflicts both in villages and large plantations.\n\nThis project places great value on Kinabatangan’s local communities, the orang sungai (which means ‘river people’ in English) tribe. The reforestation team is comprised of 10 local women from the village of Sukau who oversee planting, maintaining and monitoring seedlings of native tree species. This is significant given that very few women in Kinabatangan villages have permanent jobs.\n\nExplore the Genting Species Corridor in more detail with our interactive map"
