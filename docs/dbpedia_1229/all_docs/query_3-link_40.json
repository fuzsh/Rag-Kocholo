AbeBooks is also a great source of second hand or out of print books.\n\n*Kindle ebooks: Note you do not need a Kindle device to read Kindle editions - there is a Kindle app that will run on any smart device. Visitors from any country can open an account at their nearest Amazon store, even if not based in their country, and download Kindle editions of most books."
