        "text": "Tiger Tours\n\nThe following organizations offer tours to places in Asia where you are likely to see Tigers in their natural habitat. These companies offer small group experiences, support conservation projects, and indicate their trips are environmentally and ethically responsible:\n\nNaturetrek - Tiger Watching\n\nResponsible Travel - Tiger Safaris\n\nNatural World Safaris - Tiger Experiences\n\nRoyle Safaris - Tiger Holidays\n\nAlways bear in mind that sightings of any particular animal in its natural environment are not guaranteed and the experience of guides will greatly enhance your success.\n\nMore Wild Cat Trips\n\nTiger Books\n\nUSA visitors can search for books about Tigers on Amazon - most of the books also have Kindle ebook versions.\n\nUK or Europe visitors can search for books about Tigers on NHBS UK.\n\nFor visitors from other countries, find the name of a book you'd like on either of the above two sites, then search for it on AbeBooks to see if there is a local bookstore in your country that can supply it. AbeBooks is also a great source of second hand or out of print books.\n\nAll visitors can also download a free reading app for Kindle to your smart phone, tablet or computer from Amazon. You can then read any Kindle ebook ordered from Amazon on your own device, regardless of which country you reside in, and there is no need for a Kindle device."
