For example, it can view plots of the stress, f the model. You can also view animations of the model deforming under the applied loads. By performing a simulation study of a manlift, you can identify any areas of the manlift that are overstressed. This information can then be used to improve the design of the manlift to make it safer and more reliable. #study #solidworks #lifting #analysis #fea #finiteelementanalysis #3D #conceptual #structureanalysis #designer #civilstructure #growthupyourskill #steelstructure #motionstudy #animation"
