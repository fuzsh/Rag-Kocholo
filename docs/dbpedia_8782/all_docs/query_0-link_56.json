Taipei was also the capital of the province of Taiwan until 1 Jul 1957 when it was moved to Jhongsing (Zhongxing) New Village.\n\n² The Republic of China (ROC) signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968, and deposited the instrument of ratification on 27 Jan 1970 and was considered a member of the IAEA. After 25 Oct 1971 the ROC was expelled from the UN and the IAEA; The People's Republic of China acceded to the NPT on 9 Mar 1992. The ROC signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (NTBT) on 23 Aug 1963 and deposited the instrument of ratification on 18 May 1964. ROC signed the Outer Space Treaty (OST) 27 Jan 1967 and deposited the instrument of ratification on 24 Jul 1970. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) was signed the ROC in 1972, before it entered into force, but it's signature on this treaty is not officially recognized because Taiwan has not been considered to be a sovereign state. For the same reason, the ROC was not allowed to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) that entered into force in 1997 and has not been permitted to join the Australia Group (AG), Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) or other non-proliferation organizations. In spite of its non-state status, Taiwan's government has repeatedly stated that it will abide by the terms of the BTWC, CWC, NPT, NTBT, and MTCR. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Covenant (ESCR) was signed by the ROC on 5 Oct 1967 but not ratified; on 31 Mar 2009 the ROC finally ratified it, but the deposit was rejected by the UN.\n\n³The People's Republic of China replaced Taiwan in the UN on 15 Nov 1971; the U.S. switched recognition from Taiwan to the People's Republic on 1 Jan 1979. Currently, Taiwan has diplomatic relations with 12 countries: Belize (1989), eSwatini (Swaziland)(1968), Guatemala (1960), Haiti (1956), Marshall Islands (1998),Palau (1999), Paraguay (1957), Saint Kitts and Nevis (1983), Saint Lucia (1984-1997, 2007), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (1981), Tuvalu (1979), and Vatican City (Holy See)(1942); --- Former diplomatic recognitions (since 1971): Bahamas (1989-1997), Botswana (1966-1975), Burkina Faso (1994-2018), Central African Republic (1968-1976, 1991-1998), Chad (1962-1972, 1997-2006), Colombia (1941-1979), Costa Rica (1959-2007), Dominica(1983-2004), Dominican Republic (1957-2018), Ecuador (1947-1980), El Salvador (1961-2018), The Gambia (1968-1974, 1995-2013), Grenada (1989-2005), Guinea-Bissau (1990-1998), Honduras (1965-2023), Jordan (1947-1977), Kiribati (2003-2019), Lesotho (1966-1983, 1990-1994), Liberia (1957-1977, 1989-2003), Macedonia (1999-2001), Malawi (1966-2008),Nauru (1980-2002, 2005-2024), Nicaragua (1962-1985, 1990-2021), Niger (1963-1974, 1992-1996), Panama (1954-2017), São Tomé and Príncipe (1997-2016), Saudi Arabia (1946-1990), Senegal (1969-1972, 1996-2005), Solomon Islands (1983-2019), South Africa (1976-1997), South Korea (1949-1992), Tonga (1972-1998), United Arab Emirates (1973-84), Uruguay (1966-1988), and Vanuatu (2004).\n\nTerritorial Disputes: Taiwan is claimed as province by the People's Republic of China; involved in complex dispute over the Spratly Islands (Nan-sha Ch'ün-tao) in the South China Sea that are thought to have large oil and natural gas reserves, as well as being located amidst prime fishing grounds and busy commercial shipping traffic with China, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, and possibly Brunei, and with China and the Philippines over Scarborough Reef; the Spratly Islands also are in a strategic position for establishing a military presence to monitor activity in the South China Sea; the 2002 \"Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea\" has eased tensions but falls short of a legally binding \"code of conduct\" desired by several of the disputants; the Paracel Islands (Xisha Qundao) are occupied by China, but claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam (Hsi-sha Ch'ün-tao/Quan đao Hoang Sa). In Feb 2017, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reported China had 20 outposts built on reclaimed land in the islands; the Pratas Islands are occupied by Taiwan (Tung-sha Tao), but claimed by China and Vietnam (Dongsha Qundao/Quan dao Dong Sa); in 2003, China and Taiwan became more vocal in rejecting both Japan's claims to the uninhabited Senkaku Islands of the Senkaku-shotō (Diaoyu Tai) and Japan's unilaterally declared exclusive economic zone in the East China Sea where all parties engage in hydrocarbon prospecting; Senkaku-shotō is situated near key shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds, and possibly significant oil and natural gas reserves; the ROC claimed jurisdiction over Mongolia, but under Soviet pressure the ROC recognized Mongolian independence in 1947, however, in 1953 the ROC repudiated this recognition and reasserted its to claim jurisdiction over Mongolia. In 2002, Taiwan announced that it would require Mongolian citizens to produce passports, in effect recognizing them as foreigners.\n\nParty abbreviations:KMT = Chungkuo Kuomin-ang/Zhongguo Guomindang (Chinese Nationalist Party, \"Kuomintang\", nationalist, republican, conservative, anti-Communist, 1 Jun 1931 - 28 Sep 1986 state party, est.23 Aug 1912-Nov 1913, re-formed.10 Oct 1919); MCT = Min-chu Chin-pu-tang/Minzhu Jinbudang (Democratic Progressive Party, social liberal, Taiwanese nationalist, center-left, est.28 Sep 1986);Mil = Military\n\nProvinces\n\nNote: Names are given with Hanyu Pinyin romanization (without diacritics) in parentheses.\n\nTaiwan Province\n\n25 Oct 1945 Taiwan Province Administrative Official Public Ministry.\n\nApr 1947 Taiwan Provincial Government.\n\n1 Jul 2018 Provincial government is de facto dissolved.
