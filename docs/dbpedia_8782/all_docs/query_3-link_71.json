        "text": "Tigerhead mountainA popular spot for first dates and also has well-maintained hiking trails. Watch out for snakes if you're hiking. There are a few snack shops at the top of the mountain.\n\nCong dra bingPronounced tsong draw bing, it is a scallion pancake that the vendor cooks on a griddle and fluffs up before searing on scrambled egg and a variety of toppings like bacon and fresh basil. The traditional sauce they put on top is soy-based, but you can ask for spicy. Absolutely delicious. Usually a daytime snack, sold on the side of the street by SK II downtown or by Nova computer store.\n\n7YunnanA small restaurant chain local to Taoyuan City providing a vast range of Yunnan cuisine (somewhat like a mixture between Thai and Chinese), very affordable and good interiors. Most staff do not speak English, but all of the menus have pictures."
