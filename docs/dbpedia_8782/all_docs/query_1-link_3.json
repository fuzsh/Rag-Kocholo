        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nOften considered an industrial region, Taoyuan City has more foreign laborers working there than any other region of Taiwan. Though it is the second most populated district in Taiwan, it is usually not a major destination for travelers except for those with an overnight stopover at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. Taoyuan and Jhongli are the two largest cities in the district. Away from the crowded plains, in the mountainous area, there is still natural beauty and aboriginal culture to be seen.\n\nTaoyuan district is primarily an industrial district and has few distinctive features. However, if you get stranded at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport overnight and don't want to pay for the airport hotel or travel the extra kilometers into Taipei, you might consider spending the night here. Despite lacking tourist sites, the district does have several large shopping malls, good coffee shops and, due to a large number of overseas workers employed at local factories, also has several cheap South Asian eateries.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nLike many other places in Taiwan, every city and town in Taoyuan can be reached by bus. However, English bus information almost doesn't exist. If you don't understand any Chinese, hiring a cab or renting a car may be your best bet.\n\nThe downtown area is small enough to cover on foot.\n\nTaxi cabs are relatively cheap, starting at around NT$80 plus $5 per 0.3 km.\n\nThe district has its own bus system which is decent and covers the major parts of town, but no where near as convenient as Taipei's MRT/bus system.\n\nThe train station is in the downtown, and fares are more than affordable.\n\nThe new High Speed Railway (HSR) has a stop near the outskirts of town and can shuttle people from Taoyuan to Taipei in around 12 minutes for around NT$120. The HSR covers almost the entire length of Taiwan, but a trip spanning the entire length will cost around NT$2200.\n\nBuses run to other districts as well. A bus trip to Taipei will cost NT$65.\n\nZhongli can be accessed by a number of options. A number of bus companies service the city and there is a train station as well. Travelers can also get to Zhongli via the high-speed rail (HSR). This train provides very fast, very convenient access to and from most larger cities from the north in Taipei along the west coast to the south in Kaohsiung. The Taoyuan station is positioned very close to Zhongli and is connected to the airport by a subway system.\n\nTo get to Longtan from Taipei Main Station, follow these steps: Go to the Taipei Main Bus station. Find a TV screen that shows departures. Look for one that either is directly to Longtan or passes through the community - this will be in both English and Chinese. The main operator will be King Bus. Go to the appropriate company's window and say \"Longtan\" - they'll understand. A one way fare should be NT$82 with King Bus. Ascend to the second floor waiting area and find your company's booth. Look for the \"Long Tan\" departure gate. Wait in line. The buses run frequently (every 15 minutes during peak periods), but are often quite late (sometimes 20 minutes late). Seating is first come, first served, usually with no assigned seats. The bus trip from Taipei to Longtan is almost exactly an hour. Once you pass the toll plaza (included in your ticket, the bus won't stop), it will be another 10 to 20 minutes. The bus will pull over in front of the company's ticketing office in Longtan along the main drag. Disembark. King Bus' stop is across the street from the main terminal. On King Bus there are approximately 3 stops prior to Longtan, but if unsure, your fellow bus riders can help.\n\nLongtan is a small town. You'll be hoofing it unless you possess or rent a scooter. Everything you'll want to see is within a reasonable walking distance, so hailing a taxi is unnecessary.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nLongtan's main attraction is the Tourist pond, a former irrigation pond that the city built a temple island in and surrounded with trees. It is quite a nice spot to people watch, grab a coffee or beer, and relax. Also worth seeing is the Crazy House near the bus depot. There are a 1001 stories about it and its history, but they all involve love won and lost, life blessed and lives destroyed. It was to be a decidedly eccentric mansion, but was stopped 90% through and abandoned. Entry is not permitted, but apparently it is structurally sound for the most part. Don't visit to see it, but see it if you visit. The day market. Nothing special, but the place to pick up food for a walking excursion. Best from 10:00-14:00."
