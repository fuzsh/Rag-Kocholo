        "text": "This article is about the current district formerly a county-administered city. For the current special municipality formerly a county, see Taoyuan, Taiwan. For the district in Kaohsiung, see Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung.\n\nDistrict in Taoyuan City, Taiwan\n\nTaoyuan District (Chinese: 桃園區; pinyin: Táoyuán Qū) is a district of Taoyuan City in northwestern Taiwan. Formerly a county-administered city also known as Taoyuan City (桃園市) before 2014, when the former Taoyuan County was elevated to a special municipality which is now known as Taoyuan City. The municipal seat of Taoyuan City is situated within the district. It is the most populous district among the 13 districts of Taoyuan City, and the second most populous among the districts of Taiwan, with the most populous being Banqiao District in New Taipei City.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan is the native home of the plains tribes of Taiwanese aborigines. Taoyuan's old name was Toahong[1] (Chinese: 桃仔園; pinyin: Táozǐyuán; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Thô-á-hn̂g; lit. 'peach orchard') since there used to be many peach blossoms in the area.\n\nEmpire of Japan\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Japanese rule, the area was part of Toshien Chō (桃仔園廳) established in November 1901. In 1920, it was renamed Tōen Town (桃園街), and incorporated into Tōen District, Shinchiku Prefecture.\n\nRepublic of China\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China, it was reorganized as Taoyuan Town of Taoyuan County. On 21 April 1971, the town was upgraded from an urban township to a county-administered city called Taoyuan City.[2] On 25 December 2014, the city became a district of the newly formed special municipality of Taoyuan City.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan is located on the Taoyuan Plateau, contiguous on the northeast to Guishan District. The Nankan River is Taoyuan's largest river, flowing from the southeast to the northwest.\n\nArea: 34.80 km2 (13.44 sq mi)\n\nElevation: 157 ft (48 m)\n\nPopulation: 464,480 people (February 2023)\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa), with hot summers and mild winters. Precipitation is high throughout the year and is generally higher in the first half of the year. Due to the effect of wind from mainland China, Taoyuan is typically cooler than New Taipei, despite having a lower latitude.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nDalin, Dafeng, Jianguo, Yunlin, Fuan, Fulin, Fenglin, Zhonghe, Zhongxing, Wenhua, Wenchang, Wenming, Beimen, Minsheng, Yongxing, Guangxing, Ximen, Xihu, Wuling, Zhangmei, Nanmen, Nanhua, Zhongshan, Zhongping, Zhongzheng, Zhongcheng, Zhongxin, Zhongyuan, Zhongtai, Zhongsheng, Zhonglu, Zhongde, Wenzhong, Yushan, Taishan, Longshan, Longan, Longgang, Longxiang, Longshou, Longfeng, Zhongpu, Zhongning, Beipu, Yongan, Tongan, Tongde, Zijiang, Xipu, Mingde, Tungpu, Zhangan, Zhangde, Xinguang, Nanpu, Zhuangjing, Ciwen, Xinpu, Ruiqing, Bao'an, Baoqing, Sanyuan, Sanmin, Dayou, Daxing, Chenggong, Bianzhou, Zhongyi, Tungshan, Tungmen, Jingxi, Chunri, Zhaoyang, Guiji, Wanshou and Baoshan Village.\n\nGovernment institutions\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan City Government\n\nTaoyuan City Council\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nWithin Taoyuan, there are 6 senior high schools, 14 junior high schools, 23 primary schools, and an \"intelligence initiation school.\" Taoyuan is also home to a number of buxibans, or cram schools or language schools, which teach additional courses in mathematics, English, science, etc. There are also 10 universities located in Taoyuan.\n\nTaoyuan Main Public Library is the central library of Taoyuan city. It is located in Xianfu Rd, Taoyuan District, near the Taoyuan City Government building.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan was one of the host cities for the Taiwan European Film Festival in 2012.[3]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan District is served by Taiwan Railway Administration's Taoyuan railway station. The current station is expected to be converted to an underground station in 2029. In addition, the future underground Zhonglu railway station is also expected to serve the district in 2030.
