        "text": "Taipei, the modern city with traditional essence\n\nTaipei City is the capital of Taiwan and has various urban features that combine modernity and tradition. With complete living support functions and geographical and transportation advantages, Taipei is suitable for travelers to travel freely within.\n\nExploring Taipei\n\nAs the economic and financial center of Taiwan, the Xinyi District in Taipei City is known as the \"top battlezone for department stores\". In addition to Taipei 101, which was once the tallest building in the world, there are several other department stores and restaurants scattered around, which creates the highest density of department stores in the world. Hence, Xinyi District is definitely a must-see place when planning your trip to Taiwan. You can move through the footbridges and underground passages among the department stores to avoid being exposed to direct sunlight and rainfall while enjoying the fun of shopping in the most relaxed and comfortable state.\n\nIn addition to the busy urban pace, Taipei City also contains elements of humanities, arts, historic spots and cultures. The temples and historical sites with sophisticated sculptures and carvings are perfectly combined with modern-look streets. Famous scenic spots such as the National Palace Museum, Xingtian Temple, Longshan Temple, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and Dadaocheng all fully demonstrate the folklore customs and historical heritage.\n\nAfter visiting the lively business districts and historical buildings in the city, it is also a good choice to visit the suburbs. And don't forget the most popular attraction Jiufen Old Streets which is identical to the scenes of the movie \"Spirited Away\" by the Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki. There you can see the buildings and old streets built along the hillside during the daytime, and at nighttime, you can get a glimpse of the brightly lit scenery under the misty rain while drinking tea in the teahouse that offers a unique taste of the spirit.\n\nThe best travel season\n\nTaipei is in a subtropical region with no significant seasonal differences. The most comfortable travel season is from November to April when the climate will be relatively cool and pleasant. However, due to the influence of the monsoon and tropical climate, it is rather hot and humid throughout the year. Kindly remind you to bring an umbrella or raincoat in case of sudden rain in Taipei.\n\nCity transportation\n\nThe MRT and bus network in Taipei City is very dense. You can choose to buy travel passes according to the number of days of your trip to enjoy your tours in Taipei via public transportation. In addition, smoking is prohibited at every MRT station, and eating, drinking, and chewing gum are also forbidden on the train. So as you can see, Taipei MRT is famous for its tidiness and cleanliness!\n\nSearch for direct flights of STARLUX Airlines to plan a trip to Taipei, and enjoy a safe and high-quality flight experience worth to be treasured in your heart!\n\nFAQ"
