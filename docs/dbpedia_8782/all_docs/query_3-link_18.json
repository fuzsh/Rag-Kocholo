        "text": "T’ao-yüan\n\nTaiwan\n\nT’ao-yüan, special municipality (chih-hsia shih, or zhizia shi), northern Taiwan. Until late 2014 it was the seat of T’ao-yüan county, at which time the county and T’ao-yüan municipality were administratively combined to form the special municipality. T’ao-yüan municipality became a city district in the new and much larger entity.\n\nThe city district is situated 13 miles (21 km) southwest of Taipei special metropolis, in the northern part of the western coastal plain. Developed during the early 18th century, the city grew as an agricultural market centre for the surrounding fertile plain that raises rice and tea. Major industries produce textiles and cement. Clay and iron ore are extracted nearby.\n\nThe proximity to Taipei, Taiwan’s seat of government, has been instrumental in T’ao-yüan’s economic development, including its status as a tourist and recreational centre. Near the city is one of the largest camping areas on Taiwan. The beach resort of Chu-wei (Zhuwei) is 9 miles (14 km) northeast along the Taiwan Strait coast. The north-south freeway and the West Line railway link T’ao-yüan city district with Chi-lung (Jilong, or Keelung) and Hsin-chu (Xinzhu). Taiwan’s chief international airport (opened 1979) is in the northern part of the city district. Area special mun., 471 square miles (1,221 square km). Pop. (2015 est.) city district, 427,145; special mun., 2,105,780.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Kenneth Pletcher."
