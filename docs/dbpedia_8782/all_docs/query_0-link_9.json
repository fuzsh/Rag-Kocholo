Taoyuan District is the seat of the municipal government and which, along with Zhongli District, forms a large metropolitan area. Taoyuan developed from a satellite city of Taipei metropolitan area. Since commuting to the Taipei metropolitan area is easy, Taoyuan has witnessed the fastest population growth of all cities in Taiwan in the past few decades.\n\n\"Taoyuan\" means \"peach garden\" in Chinese, since the area used to have many peach trees. The city is home to many industrial parks and tech company headquarters. Taoyuan International Airport, which serves the capital, Taipei and the rest of northern Taiwan, is located in this city.\n\n1\n\nHistory In ancient times, the Taoyuan plateau was the home of the Taiwanese plains aborigines. In prehistory, the Ketagalan people settled in Nankan. In the early years of Dutch colonization, Spanish colonization, and Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty, there were no large-scale cultivation or industrial activities. During the Qing era, a number of people from Fujian Province and Guangdong province began to immigrate into present-day Taoyuan to develop and farm the land. They planted peach trees, which, when fully bloomed in spring, were so beautiful that the people named the land Toahong (Ê°É‰ªîÂúí; T√°oz«êyu√°n; Th√¥-√°-hnÃÇg; 'peach orchard').\n\n1\n\nEmpire of Japan In November 1901, during Japanese era, a local administrative office, Toshien Ch≈ç (Japanese: Ê°É‰ªîÂúíÂª≥), was established in the area, and renamed T≈çen Ch≈ç (Ê°ÉÂúíÂª≥) in 1905. In 1920, the T≈çen area was incorporated into Shinchiku Prefecture.\n\nDuring the Japanese era, the staged migration policy caused Taoyuan to develop into a city with a variety of cultures. For example, temples and worship paths (currently the Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine) symbolized cultural systems. Butokuden (Ê≠¶Âæ∑ÊÆø) were used to represent military systems, and the old Taoyuan City Office signified political systems.\n\n1\n\nRepublic of China After the transfer from Japan to the Republic of China, the present day-area of Taoyuan City was incorporated under Hsinchu County. In 1950, Taoyuan County was established by separating it from Hsinchu County. On 21 April 1971, Taoyuan City was made the county seat of Taoyuan County. It had 6 cities, 1 urban township and 6 rural townships.\n\nIn June 2009, the Executive Yuan approved the plan to upgrade Taoyuan from a county to a special municipality. On 25 December 2014, Taoyuan County was upgraded into a special municipality of Taoyuan City (Ê°ÉÂúíÂ∏Ç).\n\n1\n\nGeography Taoyuan is located approximately 40 km (25 mi) south-west of Taipei, in northern Taiwan, and occupies 1,220 km¬≤ (470 sq mi). It is made up of low-lying plains, interconnected mountains and plateaus. Its shape has a long and narrow southeast-to-northwest trend, with the south-east in the Xueshan Range and the far end on the shores of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThere are many irrigation ponds at Taoyuan Plateau, which caused Taoyuan to earn the nickname \"Thousand-pond Township\" (ÂçÉÂ°ò‰πãÈÑâ).\n\n1\n\nHoklo As of most of the cities and urban towns of Taiwan, Minnan people (Hoklos) are one of the largest ethnic groups of Taoyuan, most of whom live in northern Taoyuan (ÂåóÊ°ÉÂúí) which comprises the northern districts of Taoyuan, including Taoyuan city centre, Bade, Daxi, Dayuan, Guishan and Luzhu, and the city seat of government, Taoyuan District citycentre.\n\n1\n\nHakka The Hakka are the second-largest ethnic group in the city after the Minnan ethnicity (Hoklo) who won against the Hakkas in clan wars moved to the poor mountainous regions in southern Taoyuan, most of the Hakka peasants live in the rural peasant village areas of southern Taoyuan (ÂçóÊ°ÉÂúí), which includes Zhongli, Pingzhen, Yangmei, Longtan, Guanyin and Xinwu districts. With more than 785,000 Hakka people, Taoyuan hosts the largest Hakka population among all of Taiwan's administrative divisions.\n\n1\n\nWaishengren After the Chinese Civil War, many people from mainland China (unaffectionately referred to as \"Waishengren\") settled in the then-Taoyuan County after the retreat of the nationalist government in 1949. Most of them live in military dependents' villages in Zhongli, Pingzhen and Guishan. Longgang is well known for its immigrants from Yunnan, featuring many Yunnan-style restaurants.\n\n1\n\nAborigines Most Taiwanese aborigines in the city live in Fuxing District, with most of them belonging to the Atayal people.\n\n1\n\nEconomy Taoyuan is one of the Taiwan's top industrial and technological cities. High-tech companies including Quanta, MiTAC, Inotera, Nanya Technology, HTC, CPT and AU Optronics have all opted to build or expand their factories in Taoyuan. Taoyuan has now become a bastion of electronics and semiconductor manufacturing. Over 200 of Taiwan's top 500 manufacturing companies have factories in Taoyuan. Taoyuan has also led Taiwan in terms of industrial output for nine straight years.\n\nThere are now 29 (registered) industrial areas with 3,696 ha (9,130 acres) of non-urban industrial land and 3,131 ha (7,740 acres) of urban industrial land. There are over 6,827 ha (16,870 acres) of land available for factories and industrial use in the city, representing the fact that Taoyuan's development bureau is based on industry and commerce. There are also 9 sites (57 ha; 140 acres) for mixed industrial-commercial use, the most of any county and city in Taiwan.\n\nOn 26 March 2010, China Airlines (Taiwan's government-owned airline) moved into its new headquarters on the grounds of Taipei Taoyuan International Airport and in Dayuan Township in Taoyuan County (now Dayuan District, Taoyuan). EVA Air maintains its headquarters in Luzhu District. Evergreen Airlines Services Corporation, Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corp., and Evergreen Air Cargo Services Corporation, subsidiaries of Evergreen Group, are headquartered in Dayuan.\n\nOn 25 December 2016, The Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency (ASVDA) was inaugurated in northern Taoyuan City, in a governmental effort to foster innovation, promote the Internet of Things (IoT) sector and attract top-class technology talent. The Asian Silicon Valley project aimed to transform Taiwan into an R&D hub for the IoT sector as well as a global centre of entrepreneurship.\n\n1\n\nIndustry and environment A former RCA facility is located in the city.
