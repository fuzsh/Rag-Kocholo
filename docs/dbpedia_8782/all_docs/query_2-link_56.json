        "text": "GOVERNMENT OF TAIWAN\n\nGovernment type: multiparty democracy. Taiwan has an elected president like the United States and an elected unicameral legislature with a prime minister somewhat similar to the one in Great Britain. The president is more powerful than the prime minister, who is appointed by the president and is regarded as the leader of parliament.\n\nCapital: The capital of central administration of Taiwan is Taipei (T’ai-pei — literally, Taiwan North), located in T’ai-pei County in the north. Since 1967, Taipei has been administratively separate from Taiwan Province. Administrative divisions: includes main island of Taiwan plus smaller islands nearby and off coast of China's Fujian Province; Taiwan is divided into 14 counties (hsien, singular and plural), 3 municipalities (shih, singular and plural), and 5 special municipalities (chih-hsia-shih, singular and plural). Counties: Changhua, Chiayi (county), Hsinchu (county), Hualien, Kinmen, Lienchiang, Miaoli, Nantou, Penghu, Pingtung, Taitung, Taoyuan, Yilan, Yunlin. Municipalities: Chiayi (city), Hsinchu (city), Keelung (city) special municipalities: Kaohsiung (city), New Taipei (city), Taichung (city), Tainan (city), Taipei (city)\n\nThe Republic of China's (ROC's) Constitution is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the people: 1) Nationalism; 2) Democracy, and 3) Social Well-being. On January 1, 1947 the Constitution was promulgated and it was put into effect on December 25 of the same year. The National Assembly has amended it three times- in 1992, 1994, and 1997. Some of the major amendments include such measures as the president shall be elected by direct popular vote for a four-year instead of a six year term. On March 23, 1996, the first direct popular election of the president was held.\n\nBranches of Government in Taiwan\n\nThe central government in Taiwan is divided into five branches, which are known as \"Yuan\" meaning house: executive, legislative, judicial, impeachment, and examination affairs. 1) the executive yuan, or cabinet, is lead by the president and vice president. 2) The legislative yuan is a parliamentary legislature led by the prime minister. 3) the Judiciary Yuan is the equivalent of the Supreme Court. 4) the Impeachment ir Control Yuan is a supervisory body. 5) The Examination Yuan, which includes the ministries of examination of personnel. It overseas the system of test for education, licensees and jobs.\n\nExecutive Branch: The President of the Executive Yuan. The executive branch is made up of the Executive Yuan which is headed by the premier and the president. The premier is appointed by the president of the Republic. The heads of various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan make up the ROC Cabinet. Under the Executive Yuan, there are three levels of subordinate organization: the Executive Yuan Council; the eight ministries (interior, foreign affairs, national defense, finance, education, justice, economic affairs, and transportation and communications), the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; and subordinate departments. [Source: Columbus School of Law ]\n\nThe legislative branch is composed of the unicameral Legislative Yuan and the unicamercal National Assembly. The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body in Taiwan. It legislates, examines budgetary bills, reviews audits, and oversees the operation of the Executive Yuan. There are a total of 225 seats in the Legislative Yuan: 168 elected by popular vote; 41 elected on the basis of the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties; 8 elected from overseas Chinese constituencies on the basis of the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties; and 8 elected by popular vote among the aboriginal populations. The National Assembly's primary responsibility is to amend the Constitution and to impeach the president or the vice president. There are 334 seats in the National Assembly. Members are elected by popular vote to serve four year terms.\n\nThe Judicial Yuan is made up of justices appointed by the president with the consent of the National Assembly. It is the highest judicial organization of the state and is responsible for civil, criminal and administrative cases as well as cases involving the discipline of public functionaries. The Council of Grand Justices serves as the main body with 17 grand justices according to Article 3 of the Organic Law of Judicial Yuan. The number has been reduced to 15 through Article 5 of the Additional Articles of the Constitution. The president and the vice present are to be selected from among the members consists of a president, the vice president, a secretary general, and a deputy secretary. The Judicial Yuan also has a panel of 17 justices.\n\nFlag and National Anthem of Taiwan\n\nFlag: red field with white sun with 12 triangular rays in a blue rectangle in the upper hoist side corner. White represents fraternity and the future. Blue stands for equality and the sky. Red signifies liberty and China’s founding fathers. The 12 points of the white sun represent the 12 two-hour periods of the day, symbolizing unceasing progress. The white sun and blue sky symbol has been used since 1895 ; it was later adopted as the flag of the Kuomintang Party. The flag has been in use since 1921 and was adopted by the new national government in 1928. [Source: Library of Congress, March 2005]\n\nNational anthem: name: \"Zhonghua Minguo guoge\" (National Anthem of the Republic of China). Lyrics/music: Hu Han-min, Tai Chi-t'ao, and Liao Chung-k'ai/Cheng Mao-Yun note: adopted 1930; the anthem is also the song of the Kuomintang Party; it is informally known as \"San Min Chu I\" or \"San Min Zhu Yi\" (Three Principles of the People); because of political pressure from China, \"Guo Qi Ge\" (National Banner Song) is used at international events rather than the official anthem of Taiwan; the \"National Banner Song\" has gained popularity in Taiwan and is commonly used during flag raisings. “The Three Principals of People” (San Min Chu I —nationalism, democracy, and social well-being) are attributed to Sun Yat-sen.\n\nNames of Taiwan\n\nFormal Name: Republic of China (ROC, Chung-hua Min-kuo in Chinese); Short Form: Taiwan; former name: Formosa; Term for Citizen(s): Chinese (Hua-jen); Taiwanese (T’ai-wan-jen). noun: Taiwan (singular and plural), note: example — he or she is from Taiwan; they are from Taiwan; adjective: Taiwan (or Taiwanese) [Sources: Library of Congress, CIA World Factbook]\n\nFormosa the name of Taiwan before World War II is of Portuguese origin. Portuguese sailors named present-day Taiwan “Ihala Formosa” (\"Beautiful Island\"). The Chinese later called it Taiwan (\"Terraced Bay\"). During the Japanese occupation between 1985 and 1945, it was known as Formosa.\n\nTaiwan’s formal name, Republic of China, should is not be confused with the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which is the official name for mainland China. There has been some discussion of changing Taiwan’s name to the Republic of Taiwan, a move that would have antagonized Beijing because it implied a declaration of independence. According to several opinion polls in the mid 2000s, 30 percent of Taiwanese at that time wanted to declare independence and rename their country the Republic of Taiwan instead of the Republic of China.\n\nFor a while some people called Taiwan “Free China.” It’s Chinese name was written with characters that translated to “Central, Glorious, Republican Country.” An estimated 150,000 people once showed up for rallies that supported changing the name to Taiwan. As they marched through the streets the protesters chanted, “Taiwan people, Taiwan nation, Use the name Taiwan to join the United Nations.”\n\nBeijing prefers the name “Zhongguo Taipei” (“Zhongguo” which roughly means China’s Taipei, implying that Taiwan is part of the mainland. Taiwanese prefers the name “Zhonghua Taipei” which roughly means Chinese Taipei. (“Zhonghua” means “ethnic Chinese”). Which is used in the Olympics is matter of some debate. The Taiwan, the Republic of China (ROC), currently competes as \"Chinese Taipei\" at the Olympic Games.\n\nDoug Young of Reuters wrote: “Examples of the name game tussle persist nearly everywhere in Taiwan life, most notably in the island's official name, the Republic of China. License plates on many cars also often list their jurisdiction as Taiwan province, reflecting the view of Chiang's Nationalist Party (KMT) that Taiwan is just one of many provinces governed by the Republic of China. The sensitive subject also spills across the Taiwan Strait, with the island often known as Chinese Taipei at international gatherings such as the Olympics due to Beijing's insistence that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of that. Adding to the confusion are disputes over corporate names such as China Airlines, the island's biggest carrier, not to be confused with the mainland flag carrier, Air China. The island's top telecoms carrier, Chunghwa Telecom, also translates literally to \"China Telecom.\" [Source: Doug Young, Reuters, September 21, 2006]\n\nTaiwan's Name Game Struggle Under Chen Shui-ban\n\nIn 2006, then President Chen Shui-ban’s Democratic Progressive Party changed the airport's name from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and made other name changes in an effort to wipe out vestiges of the Kuomintang party. Reuters reported: “Frequent travelers to Taiwan may find themselves scratching their heads next time they fly to the island's main airport in Taipei. With barely a debate or public notice, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party quietly changed the airport's name this month to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, eliminating its previous moniker of Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. [Source: Doug Young, Reuters, September 21, 2006 /]\n\n“The move, puzzling to many outsiders, is just the latest volley in an ongoing verbal war in Taiwan, where names can be loaded words for rival political parties that see their homeland as either part of China or as an independent country. \"This is an identity question,\" said Emile Sheng, a professor of political science at Taiwan's Soochow University. \"We have a Chinese identity versus a Taiwan identity. That's the main cleavage of Taiwanese politics.\" The airport change is a poignant example in the name game, representing at once the addition of \"Taiwan\" and the elimination of Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist general who once ruled all China and then Taiwan after losing the mainland to the Communists and fleeing to the island in 1949. /\n\n“China has considered the island a breakaway province ever since. \"In recent years, there has been an ongoing evolution,\" Premier Su Tseng-chang said in a document detailing the airport's name change. \"We hope that this official name will restore the name that should have been.\" The opposition Kuomintang predictably called the change a colossal waste of money, saying it would cost the government NT$200 million (US$6 million) and private companies US$4 billion for changes in signage and the like. \"Is it worth that?\" said KMT party spokesman Tsai Chin-long. \"We have so many important things, such as corruption and foreign affairs. What are we doing with name changes?\" /\n\n“The pro-Taiwan camp has made various attempts in recent years to change some of the names to evoke Taiwan rather than China, though few have come to fruition. \"There's been a feeling that some of these names should be changed,\" said Bruce Jacobs, a professor of Asian Languages at Australia's Monash University. \"People have wanted this to happen with the big ones like China Airlines.\" /\n\n“The tug-of-war over names also goes down to street level, with some suggesting that thoroughfares bearing names of mainland cities and provinces be changed to give a more local flavor. Soochow University's Cheng said he expects many company names to eventually be changed to better reflect their business scope. But many of the smaller details, such as street names, may be left alone, he added. \"There's a lot of social cost in this,\" he said. \"If you have to change these names, it's going to cause inconvenience in people's lives,\" he said. /\n\nTaiwan’s Constitution\n\nThe Republic of China's (ROC's) Constitution is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the people: 1) Nationalism; 2) Democracy, and 3) Social Well-being. On January 1, 1947 the Constitution was promulgated and it was put into effect on December 25 of the same year. The National Assembly has amended it three times- in 1992, 1994, and 1997. Some of the major amendments include such measures as the president shall be elected by direct popular vote for a four-year instead of a six year term. On March 23, 1996, the first direct popular election of the president was held.\n\nThe ROC Constitution is the supreme law of the land and contains 175 articles in the original text. The Constitution has been amended five times since its initial promulgation. The five amendments are made up of eleven articles that have been consolidated into a single text and is maintained as a separate portion of the Constitution. The term law according to Article 170 of the Constitution means any legislative bill duly passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President. Articles 171 and 172 state that laws and ordinances that contravene the Constitution shall be null and void. [Source: Columbus School of Law]\n\nThe Constitution used in Taiwan was ratified in 1947 by the Kuomintang Party when it still controlled a large chunk of the mainland and was therefore conceived for all of China not just Taiwan. The Taiwanese constitution is outdated and badly in need of reform and revisions. One Taiwanese editor told Newsweek, \"We behave democratically, but without democratic structures. It's a mess.\"\n\nPresident, Prime Minister and Executive Branch of Taiwan\n\nTaiwan has an elected president like the United States and an elected unicameral legislature with a prime minister somewhat similar to the one in Great Britain. The president is more powerful than the prime minister, who is appointed by the president and is regarded as the leader of parliament.\n\nThe president is elected to a four year term. He or she can serve a maximum of two terms. The president is the head of state and the chief of the armed forces and appoints the prime minister . He or she does not have the power to dissolve the legislature unless there is a no confidence vote. Under Taiwan's constitution, the vice president is only a heartbeat away from the presidency, taking over the position if the president cannot serve for any reason. The Cabinet has traditionally resigned en mass before the President is inaugurated.\n\nThe prime minister is appointed by the president with the approval of the legislature. He or she heads the cabinet and runs the day-to-day affairs of government, and doesn’t necessarily have to be from the party or coalition with the most seats in Parliament. The elected president appoints the prime minister, who appoints the entire cabinet, which has eight ministries established under the Constitution and many newer commissions.\n\nThe executive branch is made up of the Executive Yuan which is headed by the premier and the president. The heads of various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan make up the ROC Cabinet. Under the Executive Yuan, there are three levels of subordinate organization: the Executive Yuan Council; the eight ministries (interior, foreign affairs, national defense, finance, education, justice, economic affairs, and transportation and communications), the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; and subordinate departments.
