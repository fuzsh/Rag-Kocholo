Get a pencil and notepad ready!\n\nIf you’re planning a trip to Taiwan and need travel advice, I’ve got a huge amount of Taiwan content on this site. Start with my 50 favorite places in Taiwan and my 50 favorite places in Taipei! If you’re just here for tea info, then read on!\n\nHere’s a discount code for my favorite Taiwanese tea provider, Eco-Cha: if you click this link then select any teas, a 10% discount will be applied at check-out. Eco-Cha supports small-scale farms using sustainable methods and can mail internationally.\n\nBest Tea Tours in Taiwan\n\nThere are some great tea-related attractions that you can explore as day trips from Taipei, which I will cover in detail in this article. This excellent half-day tour focuses mainly on tea plantations in Pinglin, while this full-day tea day tour also includes the Maokong tea growing area in Taipei City.\n\nYou can learn about the different types of Taiwanese tea and tea ceremony in this tea tasting class. If you prefer being on your feet, try this customizable walking tea tour, which takes place in one of my favorite Taipei neighborhoods, Dadaocheng.\n\nIn southern Taiwan, this day tour from Taitung includes a visit to a tea growing area in Luye.\n\nIf you’d like a fully customized tea tour of Taiwan, I recommend Life of Taiwan. They run high end tea tours staying in some of the country’s top hotels, but with high personalized experiences such as meeting tea farms and touring tea farms and enjoying tea ceremony in natural locations. If you contact them, please let then know that Nick sent you over.\n\nThe two main varieties of tea are Camellia sinensis var. sinensis (Chinese tea) and Camellia sinensis var. assamica (Indian tea). Caffeine levels vary in tea, but contrary to what some say, your typical cup of tea has less caffeine that a cup of coffee. Tea may be higher in caffeine by volume, but quite a bit less tea leaves are used than coffee beans to brew a single cup.\n\nWhile the majority of Chinese and Taiwanese teas are unflavored, you may encounter some with flavors, which may be real or artificial. Popular ones include jasmine (茉莉) and lychee (荔枝). Herbal (花草茶), fruit (水果茶) and flower (花茶) teas are also common in China and Taiwan, but are not true teas.\n\nHistory of Taiwanese Tea\n\nTaiwan actually has an indigenous tea that early settlers found growing in the mountains and being used by the aboriginals. Some believe that it may be a tea variety of its own, Camellia formosensis.\n\nCamellia sinensis (Chinese tea) was first brought over to Taiwan in the 19th century from Fujian province in China, where the famous Wuyi tea region is located. Many of Wuyi’s teas are known as yancha (rock tea or 岩茶) after the distinctive rocky terroir they are grown in). Oolong tea was found to grow particularly well in Taiwan after it was planted in the Lugu area of Nantou and in northern Taiwan.\n\nFollowing the First Opium War and Treaty of Tianjin, Taiwan was forced to open its ports to trade with the West. Tea became a major export, and around the time the capital of Taiwan was moved to Taipei, a thriving riverside port called Dadaocheng developed around the tea trade.\n\nThe neighborhood remains one of the best places to experience Taiwan’s tea culture. We’ll introduce some teashops there below.\n\nAfter Taiwan became a Japanese colony in 1895, the Japanese shifted from oolong to black tea production in Taiwan to compete with the British. They planted Camellia assamica (Indian tea) in the Sun Moon Lake area (see my complete article on Sun Moon Lake’s incredible black teas).\n\nThe Japanese also established the Tea Research and Extension Station in 1903, which sought to develop new cultivars and improve or perfect existing ones. To this day, the institution has developed 22 or more new cultivars, some of which are internationally sought and even grown in other countries, such as Thailand. See more details on that in my guide to tea in Thailand.\n\nAfter the Japanese left in 1945, production of black tea dwindled, but a small industry remains, with Ruby Red (TRES tea #18), which is a cross between native Camelia formosensis and Camelia assamica from Burma, often considered the best black tea made in Taiwan, with notes of mint and cinnamon.\n\nThe Push to Go Higher\n\nStarting in the 1980s, the TRES and Taiwanese government began encouraging local farmers to experiment with growing tea at higher altitudes. Little did these early pioneers know that they were onto something that would have a massive impact on the Taiwanese tea industry.\n\nThe oolong tea grown at higher altitudes was found to have an incredible flavor. Lower amounts of oxygen in the air meant that the tea plants grew slower, with flavor chemicals becoming more concentrated in the leaves. Damp air from the sea and misty slopes of the Central Mountain Range were found to produce teas so fine, the name High Mountain Tea was coined.\n\nThe Alishan region was the first testing ground, and even today, Alishan High Mountain Tea remains the most famous. See more details in my guide to Alishan’s teas.\n\nTeas grown at 1000 meters of higher are considered high mountain, and most of Alishan’s teas grown around 1000-2000 meters, especially around Shizhuo village. However, farmers have tried to go even higher in other parts of Taiwan, under the assumption that the higher you go, the better the tea will test. Some of Taiwan’s most expensive teas are grown as high as 2600 meters at Dayuling.\n\nHigh mountain tea farming is known to be bad for the environment, as it leads to deforestation and soil erosion, so the government is even dismantling some of its high mountain tea farms. What’s more, demand for Taiwanese teas far exceeds production, which has even led to the phenomenon of “counterfeit” Taiwanese teas, which are typically grown in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn fact, Taiwan produces such a limited amount of tea that almost none of it is exported. Taiwan actually has to IMPORT a large amount of tea to meet local demand, particularly for bottled and iced tea beverages, which are massively popular among all ages in Taiwan.\n\nThis is why you may find that tea from Taiwan is quite expensive by international standards, and export is mainly limited to small artisanal distributors like Eco-Cha. It’s just really damn good, and there isn’t much of it.\n\nMain Varieties of Tea\n\nThe amount of oxidation (also called fermentation) that tea leaves undergo after being harvested determines the variety of tea. The following are in order from least to most oxidized.\n\nWhite Tea (白茶)\n\nThis is the least processed of all teas and has an extremely mild flavor and light yellow color (the name “white” comes from the tiny silvery-white hairs found on the unopened buds of the plant). White tea comes from Fujian province in China, and as far as I know it is not produced in Taiwan.\n\nGreen Tea (綠茶)\n\nLike white tea, green tea is totally unoxidized, but has a stronger flavor. Green teas tend to be sharp and possess citrus or vegetal undertones. It is believed that by roasting or pan-firing the leaves immediately after harvesting, they retain much of their natural flavor.\n\nChina and Japan produce most green teas. Taiwan produces some green teas, but they are less common than oolongs. Biluochun (碧螺春) is one famous green tea from China that is also grown in Taiwan.\n\nA flavored green tea I’ve come across in Taiwan is sweet osthmanthus green tea (桂花綠茶).\n\nOolong (Wulong) Tea (烏龍茶)\n\nOolongs are semi-oxidized teas, generally ranging from 10% (lighter, closer to a green tea in characteristics) to 80% (darker, more robust, closer to a black tea).\n\nAs such, oolongs are highly varied. They can be steeped multiple times, and each steeping produces different flavors.\n\nOolong teas are by far the most common ones produced in Taiwan today. Taiwan’s oolong teas, especially its high mountain oolong teas, are prized by tea connoisseurs around the world and can fetch astronomical prices.\n\nBlack Tea (“Red Tea” in Mandarin) (紅茶)\n\nBlack tea leaves are fully oxidized, giving them the most robust flavor. They are the most common kind of tea consumed in the West, and produced mainly in India and Sri Lanka, though China does produce some as well.\n\nMany of them are blends, and sometimes flavors are added (for example the addition of oil of bergamot to produce Earl Grey tea). Sun Moon Lake’s black teas are the best in the country, especially Ruby Red #18, while Alishan Black tea is a rarer one.\n\nAnother type of Taiwanese black tea that has become increasingly common in recent years is honey-scented black tea (蜜香紅茶). This is not an added flavor. The honey scent is a natural aroma that results from the bites of little bugs on the leaves, just like the more famous Oriental Beauty (see below).\n\nPu Er Tea (普洱茶)\n\nPu Er tea is a fully fermented and aged tea that is unique to Yunnan province in southwestern China. Pu er is sometimes (but not always!) truly “black” tea, being extremely dark, earthy, and robust in flavor. It often comes packed in large dense round cakes like in the picture below.\n\nPu’er is generally more complex and is largely the domain of serious tea nerds all over the world. There are two main types, sheng (生普洱茶) or “raw” and shou (熟普洱茶), which is artificially fermented. Read more about the differences here.\n\nIt is very easy to find Pu-er tea in Taiwan, but all of it is imported from China.\n\nTaiwanese Oolong Tea: Taiwan’s Best Tea\n\nBaozhong (or Pouchong) “wrapped variety” (包種茶)\n\nYou can from Taipei. Baozhong tea is a personal favorite of mine.\n\nIron Goddess (Tieguanyin) (鐵觀音茶)\n\nDong Ding Tea (凍頂茶)\n\nLiterally “frozen peak tea”, dong ding tea is grown around Lugu, one of the earliest tea growing regions of Taiwan. Like Iron Goddess, it is usually light to medium bodied and roasted, with a flavor profile that I often find to be nutty.\n\nAlishan High Mountain (阿里山高山茶)\n\nAlishan tea is usually around 40% oxidized, so it is light to medium in color. The tealeaves are usually rolled into dense little balls that unfold when you add hot water. It has a creamy mouthfeel that seems to coat the mouth, and a sweet, long-lasting aftertaste.\n\nDayuling (大禹嶺)\n\nShanlinxi (杉林溪)\n\nShanlinxi is yet another high mountain tea region in Taiwan. In travel literature, Shanlinxi National Forest Recreation Area, famous for its waterfalls and autumn foliage, is often translated as “Sun Link Sea”. The characteristic of this tea are roughly similar to Alishan High Mountain Tea.\n\nOriental Beauty (東方美人 or Dongfang Meiren)\n\nDried oriental beauty leaves have white tips, so it is sometimes called “white tipped oolong”. In a market where high mountain oolongs reign supreme (which personally I kind of get bored of sometimes), Oriental Beauty is refreshingly different.\n\nHow to Order Tea from Taiwan\n\nA solid choice for buying Taiwan tea online from anywhere in the world is Eco-Cha, which sells artisanal teas from producers that practice sustainable farming, and has a great tea of the month program. Use this link to browse their teas and get 10% off your Eco-Cha tea order or enter the discount code NKTEA when you check out!\n\nGlobal Tea Hut, an international meditation and tea center run by an American monk and tea expert and headquartered in Taiwan, also has a great tea of the month + tea magazine program. The magazine is extremely informative and I would highly recommend it for tea (and meditation) lovers who want to take their love of a tea to a higher level, but heads up that it is spiritual in nature.\n\nI wrote a whole article about my visit to Global Tea Hut’s meditation center, Tea Sage Hut (no longer open).\n\nWhere to Buy Tea in Taiwan\n\nOne interesting method for buying tea in Taiwan is to visit a tea producing area and buy tea directly from the growers or in local shops in that area.\n\nEasily accessible tea growing areas include Sun Moon Lake, Alishan (Shizhuo village especially), and Luye. Buying tea in this way creates an association in your mind between the tea and your experience in that area, making it all the more enjoyable when you brew it later. See more details about these regions below.\n\nYou can find many stores specializing in Taiwanese tea in all the major cities, many tourist centers (especially Alishan and Sun Moon Lake), and even at the airport and in most grocery stores.\n\nWhere to Buy Tea in Taipei\n\nMy favorite place in Taipei to buy tea in Taipei is the Lin Mao Sen Tea Co 林茂森茶行 (195-3 Chongqing N Rd, MRT Daqiaotou 重慶北路195-3號，捷運大橋頭站). The clerks speak impeccable English and can describe all the characteristics of the teas to you before you buy. There are dozens of varieties on display in large metal barrels, and the main local varieties are sorted according to quality, ranging from very cheap to very expensive.\n\nRight next door, and owned by the brother of Lin Mao Sen, is competing Lin Hua Tai Tea (林華泰茶行). The shop isn’t as fancy looking, but the product seems to be almost identical, with a similar range of qualities and prices.\n\nTea, just like most dried goods and produce in Taiwan, is sold by the jin (斤). One jin is equivalent to 600 grams. For most of the varieties mentioned above, the highest quality goes for NTD4000 (120 USD) per jin, the second goes for 2400 per jin, the third for 1600, and so forth, with the cheapest ones going for as low as NTD60 per jin.\n\nThe lowest quality ones are mostly stems and powder, while the highest ones have the largest concentration of perfect leaves. If you want even lower than the lowest quality, go to your local supermarket and buy a box of teabags. The minimum purchase at Lin Mao Sen is a quarter of a jin, or 150 grams (150 公克). They are also familiar with Western units of measurement.\n\nIt’s interesting to compare the size of a 150g bag of, say, light fluffy baozhong to the same amount of Alishan High Mountain, which is rolled into dense little balls. The bag of baozhong will be about three times as big!\n\nPersonally, I always go for the third or second highest quality. This is still VERY good tea, and I think only a true connoisseur would be able to tell the difference between the top three qualities, yet the price drops enormously between each of them. NT400 (12 USD) gets me a decent-sized 150g bag of (third quality) tea that lasts me for at least a few months, and if I get a few different bags, I’m good for a year.\n\nAnother very interesting place to buy tea in Taipei is Wang Tea (有記名茶) (#26, Lane 64, Section 2, Chongqing North Road, 大同區重慶北路二段64巷26號), which is only a few blocks away from Lin Mao Sen and Lin Hua Tai in historic Dadaocheng area. This tea shop was established over 100 years ago and specialized in Baozhong and high mountain oolongs.\n\nBut the coolest part is that they are the only remaining shop in Taipei where the tea leaves are roasted in the traditional manner over hot coals, right inside the shop!\n\nYou can visit the back room where they do this, and if you are lucky enough to visit during one of the roastings, there will be a wonderful smell. If you want to buy tea there, you can sit down to a private sampling session with an expert.\n\nWang Tea faces Chaoyang Tea Park (朝陽茶葉公園), around which there are several other old tea shops.\n\nYet another excellent tea shop I recently found is Mingxinfang Taiwan High Mountain Tea (茗心坊台灣高山烏龍茶) near Da’an MRT station in Taipei.\n\nThe owner of this tea shop is extremely passionate about tea. He has hand drawn a map of Taiwan’s various tea region elevations, does Chinese calligraphy on every bag of tea he sells, and will happily show you his huge book of tea notes.\n\nWhen I recently visited with my kids, he happily prepared some tea for us and told me all about his unique roasting method. He says that, as a result, his tea stay fresh longer and don’t need to be rinsed (many Taiwanese will “rinse” the leaves with hot water and throw that out before making the first brew).\n\nHeads up that he doesn’t speak much English (we only conversed in Mandarin) but he has a staff member on hand who can, and they are accustomed to foreign guests.\n\nYou can usually find some stalls selling tealeaves at the Taipei Expo Farmer’s Market, which takes place beside Maji Square at Yuanshan MRT station every Saturday and Sunday 10am to 6pm.\n\nFor newbies, Chengpion Tea House (埕畔茶坊) between Taipei Main Station and Dihua Street will run you through the different kinds, complete with tasting. He only asks that you call to book a spot first.\n\nTaipei also has some chain tea shops which sell decent teas, notably Ten Ren’s Tea (天仁茗茶), which has multiple branches in the city.\n\nLast but not least, Jing Sheng Yu (京盛宇) on Yongkang Street (an area famous for its traditional teahouses, see below) sells more modern items like tea bags (but containing quality tea), decaffeinated teas, and cutely designed packaging. You can sample any of their teas before purchasing.\n\nLooking for a place to stay in town? Don’t miss my guide to the best hostels and hotels in Taipei.\n\nTaipei Teahouses\n\nI have recently published a new article on my personal favorite traditional teahouses in Taipei, so head there for even more detailed info than I’ve provide here!\n\nYet another great option is Eighty-Eightea Rinbansyo (八拾捌茶輪番所), also housed in a Japanese era wooden house, but not as pricey as the above two.\n\nIt is conveniently located in Ximending district, in a square that also features a Japanese shinto shrine. A pot of tea with choice of two snacks goes for NT350. Also find places to eat in the area in my Ximen food guide.\n\nMaokong is also a great place in Taipei with many traditional tea houses in rural natural surroundings overlooking Taipei.\n\nFor a non-traditional tea experience in Taipei, Matcha One has the best matcha and matcha desserts in the city, while Coffee Space Coftail does tea and coffee infused cocktails. Many other cocktail bars in Taipei also use traditional Taiwan teas in their cocktails.\n\nIn New Taipei City, Jiufen is a popular old mining village turned into tourist resort town, and a probably the single most popular of the many day trips from Taipei. It’s quite touristy, but also has some historic, incredibly atmospheric teahouses. Amei teahouse is the most famous one (you’ll want to pre-order your tea set online to guarantee a spot) but there are several others.\n\nFind all the details in my guide to Jiufen and information on how to get to Jiufen here.\n\nTea Attractions around Taipei\n\nTerraced tea fields are highly photogenic places, and there are many places in Taiwan, even as easy day trips from Taipei, where you can get up close to admire their simple beauty. Taiwan is also home to several interesting and informative tea centers and museums.\n\nThere are a few tour operators offering tea tours across Taiwan (a simple google seach will help you there, but I can’t recommend one personally). The below tea-related attractions can all be visited on your own, but I’ve mentioned organized tours where they do have them.\n\nTaipei Tea House, Jiuzhuang (舊莊), Nangang District\n\nGetting There: Catch small bus #5 from just in front of Funan Temple (富南宮) near exit 5 of Nangang Exhibition Center MRT. Buses are infrequent, and if I remember correct, the ride takes about 20 minutes.\n\nPinglin Tea Museum (坪林茶業博物館)\n\nGetting There: Bus #923 and green #12 go to Pinglin from just outside Xindian MRT station. The ride takes about 40 minutes. Bicycles can be hired in Pinglin town.\n\nFor another place to try tea-infused foods in Taiwan, see #38 of my recommended things to do in Yilan.\n\nShiding Bagua Tea Plantation (石碇八卦茶園)\n\nFor absolutely stunning panoramic views over the Feicui Reservoir (翡翠水庫), one of two main reservoirs that provides water to greater Taipei, get yourself to this fantastic little spot. The reservoir is also called Qian Dao Hu or “Thousand Island Lake” (千島湖), named after a lake with similar scenery in Zhejiang province, China.\n\nYou can get here by taking the bus towards Pinglin, getting off at the nearest stop, then hiking down to find the trail. A much easier way to visit is by taking the Thousand Island Lake and Pinglin Tea Plantation tour, this tea day tour that also includes Maokong, this one that focuses mainly on the tea plantation only, or this hiking and tea-focused tour.\n\nThe picture-perfect terraced tea fields rolling down to the turquoise waters of the reservoir with mountains rising straight out of the reservoir form a commanding backdrop. It’s worth the trip!\n\nThere’s also a hike in the area that takes in similar views called Yong An Scenic Trail (永安景觀步道).\n\nMaokong (貓空) Tea Houses\n\nMaokong offers Taipei folk (and lots and lots of tourists) the chance to get up into the tea fields via glass-bottom gondola directly from the Taipei Zoo MRT station, and offers dozens of traditional teashops to choose from. The gondola even passes over some tea fields.\n\nArriving at Gondola Station, you can do some hikes in the article with views of tea fields, such as the below pictures, or choose from one of dozens of teaditional teahouses in the area. I introduce my favorites in my Maokong guide.\n\nA great way to visit Maokong is on this full-day tea tour that also includes Pinglin.\n\nVisiting Tea Areas around Taiwan\n\nInterest in tea tourism seems to be growing in recent years (based on the number of tours offered and also emails and questions that I get from readers). However, the tea tourism industry in Taiwan is young, and it is not very easy to visit or stay on tea farms around Taiwan. I have spend a lot of time researching this and trying, and below are what I consider the best options.\n\nShizhuo, Alishan\n\nSun Moon Lake\n\nSun Moon Lake is a gorgeous and popular tourist destination, but the region north of the lake, between Sun Moon Lake and Puli, is also famous for its black teas, especially Ruby Red #18.\n\nHere you can find multiple tea-related sights and activite, most notably the Antique Assam Tea Farm. There is even a tea themed guesthouse, and if you get off the main road and drive up some mountain roads, you can find some beautiful terraced tea farms.\n\nSee my article on Sun Moon Lake tea for all the details about these tea-related attractions. Sun Moon Lake can even be visited as a day trip from Taichung.\n\nLuye, Taitung\n\nHow to Brew Taiwanese Tea\n\nMost locals perform a somewhat simplified execution of the traditional Chinese gongfu tea ceremony (功夫茶) or “skilled tea”. The first step, after bragging about how good your tea is, is to boil some water and add it to some leaves in the small pot to “rinse” or “wash” them, usually for 30 seconds or less.\n\nThe “liquor” from this first round is then poured into the cups and then discarded into the tea tray, which typically has drainage holes. This is done to warm the cups, and after the tea is discarded, drinkers can stick their noses into the empty cups to experience the tea’s aroma. The main purpose of rinsing the tealeaves is to get rid of the bitterness.\n\nNext, more water is added to the pot and the leaves are steeped for about 1 minute (or up to two minutes for some darker oolongs, such as Oriental Beauty tea). Also note that the ideal temperature for brewing tea varies according to the tea. The ideal water temperatures for various teas are as follows (according to the Pinglin Team Museum; information online varies slightly):\n\nIdeal brewing temperatures\n\nIron Goddess, High Mountain Oolong: 100°C\n\nBlack, Pu Er: 95°C\n\nBaozhong: 90°C\n\nGreen Tea, Oriental Beauty: 85°C\n\nOolong teas can be steeped a few times, while pu er tea can be steeped ten or more times. For each subsequent brew, the leaves should be steeped longer. Supposedly, each round brings out different flavors in the tea."
