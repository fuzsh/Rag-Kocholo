FORMOSA.”, in North-China Herald and Supreme Court & Consular Gazette‎[1], volume XLII, number 1137, page 598, columns 2, 3:\n\nThrough all this the Governor has pressed on his railway from Taipei, his new capital, to Kelung. Its completion awaits the boring of the tunnel through the range of hills which hems in the town of Kelung on the south, which is by no means an inconsiderable work ; but Mr. Chalmers expects that the end of another year will see it accomplished. Meanwhile passengers can travel eight miles and back from Taipei for ten cents ; and the passenger tickets are the handsome adhesive stamps which the Governor obtained from England for his new postal service, but which were found not adaptable to his postal regulations and therefore serve a new and unintended purpose ; “a vicissitude,” says Mr. Chalmers, “which is perhaps unique in the history of postage stamps.”[…]\n\nIt is interesting to learn that the progress of Taipei and Kelung is not so far interfering with the prosperity of Twatutia and Tamsui. The former is the open town that has never been formally opened, is the centre of the Formosan tea trade, and is nominally a part of its sea-port Tamsui. Here we read that the foreshore between the foreign hongs and the river has been filled in and bunded by Chinese capitalists, who are covering it with buildings for European residences, godowns and offices. The railway from Taipei to Changhua is to pass through Twatutia, and a bridge is being constructed across the river at the latter spot.\n\n[1891 January 2 [1890 December 1], “POSTHUMOUS HONOURS TO A BRIGADIER-GENERAL.”, in North-China Herald and Supreme Court & Consular Gazette‎[2], volume XLVI, number 1222, page 12, column 1:\n\nIt is asked that in addition to receiving the posthumous honours usually accorded to a Commander-in-chief who died from the effects of services rendered in the field he should have a temple built to perpetuate hiy memory in the city of T'aipei Fu, and that his biography should be compiled by the Court Historians.]\n\n1892 December 9 [1892 October 22], “TYPHOONS IN FORMOSA.”, in North-China Herald and Supreme Court & Consular Gazette‎[3], volume XLIX, number 1323, page 869, columns 1, 2:\n\nJust as the memorialist's writing (apparently on the 6th of September) a tremendous gale has sprung up in Taipei Fu and is doing a good deal of damage to the buildings there.\n\n1893 April 1, “THE CAMPHOR TRADE OF FORMOSA”, in Chemical Trade Journal‎[4], page 210:\n\nUnder new regulations the purchasers of camphor are not allowed to approach the stills for fear of injury from the savages ; but four markets have been selected, viz.: Taipei, Tokoham, and Sokko-k'eng, and in Chung-lu, or middle district, Chipchipkoi and Tohchay, whither all produce is to be taken for sale.\n\n1895 July 15, “Riotous Proceedings in Northern Formosa”, in Bangor Daily Whig and Courier‎[5], volume LXII, number 167, page 2, column 7:\n\nThese things happened at Taipei, the chief town of Northern Formosa, some seventeen miles by rail from Kelung, which the Japanese had captured on the third of June.\n\n(Taihoku was more common in this period)\n\n1896, J.

EUPLOCAMUS SWINHOII Gould.\n\nThis beautiful Pheasant is sometimes brought for sale to Taipei-fu. It is said to be rare in the North of Formosa. A friend of mine was told by the late Mr. Holst that it was very common in the mountains of Central Formosa.]\n\n1902 November, “THE DAI KAI.”, in The Japan Evangelist‎[9], volume IX, number 11, page 358, column 2:\n\nThis latter subject came in quite appropriately as \"the Ministerial Meeting\" was attended by Chinese evangelists from Formosa. One spoke in English, and the other in Chinese, and were able to communicate with their Japanese brethren through Rev. Mr. Kawai, at Taipei, who accompanied them to the Conference and Synod.\n\n1916 April 13, Oswald Kendall, “The Romance of the Martin Connor”, in The Youth's Companion‎[10], volume 90, number 15, page 198, column 2:\n\n\"Thet one in the Formosa Channel was tremenjus.

According to an announcement of the official Chinese News Service, there are to be 8 chief administrative subdivisions of Formosa. Although it is not known that their boundary lines will exactly coincide with those of the provinces under Japanese rule, this is probable. Names of the new hsien (districts), with corresponding Japanese province names in parentheses, are as follows: Taipei (Taihoku); Hsinchu (Shinchiku); Taichung (Taichu); Tainan (Tainan); Kaohsiung (Takao); Hwalienkan (Karenko); and Taitung (Taito). The Pescadores Islands form the eighth hsien. Nine cities will continue to be recognized as municipalities: Taipei (Taihoku); Taichung (Taichu); Tainan (Tainan); Chilung (Kiirun or Keelung); Kaohsiung (Takao); Hsinchu (Shinchiku); Chiayi (Kagi); Changhua (Shoka); and Pintung (Heito).\n\n1946 February 16, “China”, in Foreign Commerce Weekly‎[13], volume XXII, number 7, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, United States Department of Commerce, →ISSN, →OCLC, page 26, column 2:\n\nRecent reports from Taiwan (Formosa), although fragmentary, begin to give a picture of economic conditions following the conclusion of the war. Now officially referred to as Taiwan Province, the island's former Japanese administration is being replaced by Chinese officials with little change, at least as yet, in the administrative pattern. Although there is no indication that ideographs will be changed, Chinese readings rather than Japanese will be followed for place names. Taihoku, for example, will be read in our alphabet as Taipei. This city presumably will continue to be the capital of Taiwan.\n\n1947 February 1, “China”, in Foreign Commerce Weekly‎[14], volume XXVI, number 5, Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, →ISSN, →OCLC, page 14, column 2:\n\nRadiotelephonic communications were established in November 1946 between Taipei and Canton, thus augmenting the line already existing between Taipei and Shanghai.\n\nThe Chinese National Aviation Corporation, which operated air service between Shanghai and Taipei three times a week, has added weekly air service between Foochow and Taipei. The Southwest Aviation Corp. is reportedly planning a Canton-Taipei air service, and damaged Japanese military transport aircraft have been under repair for use on this route.\n\n1948 April, John W. Patton, “Veterinary Education in Formosa and Japan”, in Veterinary Medicine‎[15], volume XLIII, number 4, page 150, column 1:\n\nDuring the 51-year Japanese reign they converted the naturally beautiful land into a relatively modern one. Its Capitol, Taipei, is said to be the most modern and beautiful in all Asia. The telephone system in Taipei, for instance, was almost as large and more modern than the one in Shanghai. Its airfields are the best in the Orient.\n\n1956, “Formosa, China's Island Province—Its Jungle Tribes, Once Savage Head-hunters”, in Lands and Peoples: The World in Color‎[16], volume IV, The Grolier Society, →LCCN, →OCLC, page 233:\n\nJapan in her period of expansion and conquest in the Far East, forced China to cede her the island in 1895, but fifty years later, after World War II, Formosa was returned to China.

James, “Taiwan”, in Doing Business in Asia‎[22], Cincinnati, Ohio: Betterway Books, →ISBN, →LCCN, page 150:\n\nTaipei, Taiwan's capital city and commercial heart, gives the business visitor the distinct impression that Taiwan will succeed in its economic ambitions. It is a lively, energetic city bursting with vitality. Its traffic jams and sprawling growth are characteristic of Taiwan's urgent quest for achievement.\n\n2000, Shui-Bian Chen, “Learning and Transformation”, in David J.

Some people find this news surprising. That the meeting is being hosted by NED is not a surprise at all, but that they chose China's Taipei as the venue may be something of a surprise to some people.[…]\n\nOnce the reader embraces the information found in the report, the obvious answer to any questions as to why Taipei was chosen as the site of this summit will become clear.

Freiberger, “Taiwan From A to Z”, in Taipei in a Day‎[41], →ISBN, →OCLC, page 123, column 1:\n\nA century ago, the cities of Taipei County were rustic faming societies made up of mostly aboriginal tribes.
