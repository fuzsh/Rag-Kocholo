        "text": "Municipality in Taiwan\n\nThis article is about the special municipality formerly known as Taoyuan County. For former county-administered Taoyuan City, see Taoyuan District. For the district in Kaohsiung, see Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung. For the county in Hunan, see Taoyuan County.\n\nSpecial municipality in Republic of China\n\nTaoyuan CityTraditional Chinese桃園市Simplified Chinese桃园市\n\nTranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinTáoyuán ShìBopomofoㄊㄠˊ ㄩㄢˊ ㄕˋGwoyeu RomatzyhTaur'yuan ShyhWade–GilesTʻao2-yüan2 Shih4Tongyong PinyinTáoyuán ShìhYale RomanizationTáuywán Shr̀MPS2Táuyuán Shr̀IPA[tʰǎʊ.ɥɛ̌n ʂɻ̩̂]HakkaPha̍k-fa-sṳThò-yèn-sṳSouthern MinHokkien POJThô-hn̂g-chhīTâi-lôThô-hn̂g-tshī\n\nTaoyuan[I] ( ) is a special municipality located in northwestern Taiwan, neighboring New Taipei City to the north-east, Yilan County to the south-east, and Hsinchu County to the south-west. Taoyuan District is the seat of the municipal government and which, along with Zhongli District, forms a large metropolitan area. Taoyuan developed from a satellite city of Taipei metropolitan area to become the fourth-largest metropolitan area, and fifth-largest populated city in Taiwan. \"Taoyuan\" literally means \"peach garden\" in Chinese, since the area used to have many peach trees. Formerly a county, Taoyuan became the latest new founding special municipality in 2014.\n\nTaoyuan City is home to many industrial parks and tech company headquarters. Due to the city's proximity to Taipei, and the lower cost of living, Taoyuan has had the fastest population growth of any city in Taiwan in recent decades.[5] The city is also home to 116,000 foreign workers, with many coming from Southeast Asia and working in factories or as household caregivers.[6][7] Taoyuan International Airport, which serves the capital, Taipei and the rest of northern Taiwan, is located in this city.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nIn ancient times, the Taoyuan plateau was the home of the Taiwanese plains aborigines. In prehistory, the Ketagalan people settled in Nankan [zh]. In the early years of Dutch colonization, Spanish colonization, and Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty, there were no large-scale cultivation or industrial activities. During the Qing era, a number of people from Fujian Province and Guangdong province began to immigrate into present-day Taoyuan to develop and farm the land. They planted peach trees, which, when fully bloomed in spring, were so beautiful that the people named the land Toahong (Chinese: 桃仔園; pinyin: Táozǐyuán; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Thô-á-hn̂g; lit. 'peach orchard').\n\nEmpire of Japan\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 1901, during Japanese era, a local administrative office, Toshien Chō (Japanese: 桃仔園廳), was established in the area, and renamed Tōen Chō (桃園廳) in 1905. In 1920, the Tōen area was incorporated into Shinchiku Prefecture.\n\nDuring the Japanese era, the staged migration policy caused Taoyuan to develop into a city with a variety of cultures. For example, temples and worship paths (currently the Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine) symbolized cultural systems. Butokuden (武德殿) were used to represent military systems, and the old Taoyuan City Office signified political systems.\n\nRepublic of China\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the transfer from Japan to the Republic of China, the present day-area of Taoyuan City was incorporated under Hsinchu County. In 1950, Taoyuan County was established by separating it from Hsinchu County. On 21 April 1971, Taoyuan City was made the county seat of Taoyuan County. It had 6 cities, 1 urban township and 6 rural townships.\n\nIn June 2009, the Executive Yuan approved the plan to upgrade Taoyuan from a county to a special municipality.[8] On 25 December 2014, Taoyuan County was upgraded into a special municipality of Taoyuan City (桃園市).\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan is located approximately 40 km (25 mi) southwest of Taipei, in northern Taiwan, and occupies 1,220 km2 (470 sq mi). It is made up of low-lying plains, interconnected mountains and plateaus. Its shape has a long and narrow southeast-to-northwest trend, with the southeast in the Xueshan Range and the far end on the shores of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThere are many irrigation ponds at Taoyuan Plateau, which caused Taoyuan to earn the nickname \"Thousand-pond Township\" (千塘之鄉).[9]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan has a humid subtropical climate, with mild to warm winters and hot summers, typical of northern Taiwan.\n\n(The climate data of Taipei City is shown below for reference due to the city's proximity to Taipei.)\n\nEthnic composition\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%1985 1,211,249— 1990 1,355,175+11.9%1995 1,524,127+12.5%2000 1,732,617+13.7%2005 1,911,161+10.3%2010 2,002,060+4.8%2015 2,105,780+5.2%2020 2,252,835+7.0%Source:\"Populations by city and country in Taiwan\". Ministry of the Interior Population Census.\n\nHan Chinese\n\n[edit]\n\nHoklo\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of most of the cities and urban towns of Taiwan, Minnan people (Hoklos) are one of the largest ethnic groups of Taoyuan, most of whom live in northern Taoyuan (北桃園) which comprises the northern districts of Taoyuan, including Taoyuan city centre, Bade, Daxi, Dayuan, Guishan and Luzhu, and the city seat of government, Taoyuan District citycentre.\n\nHakka\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Hakka are the second-largest ethnic group in the city after the Minnan ethnicity (Hoklo) who won against the Hakkas in clan wars moved to the poor mountainous regions in southern Taoyuan, most of the Hakka peasants live in the rural peasant village areas of southern Taoyuan (南桃園), which includes Zhongli, Pingzhen, Yangmei, Longtan, Guanyin and Xinwu districts. With more than 785,000 Hakka people, Taoyuan hosts the largest Hakka population among all of Taiwan's administrative divisions.\n\nWaishengren\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the Chinese Civil War, many people from mainland China (unaffectionately referred to as \"Waishengren\") settled in the then-Taoyuan County after the retreat of the nationalist government in 1949. Most of them live in military dependents' villages in Zhongli, Pingzhen and Guishan. Longgang is well known for its immigrants from Yunnan, featuring many Yunnan-style restaurants.\n\nIndigenous peoples\n\n[edit]\n\nMost Taiwanese indigenous peoples in the city live in Fuxing District, with most of them belonging to the Atayal people. Outside of the Fuxing District, Taoyuan is the one Special Municipality of Taiwan that has no Aboriginal populations, appearing on related maps as empty.[citation needed]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nTaoyuan is one of the Taiwan's top industrial and technological cities. High-tech companies including Quanta, MiTAC, Inotera, Nanya Technology, HTC, CPT and AU Optronics have all opted to build or expand their factories in Taoyuan. Taoyuan has now become a bastion of electronics and semiconductor manufacturing. Over 200 of Taiwan's top 500 manufacturing companies have factories in Taoyuan. Taoyuan has also led Taiwan in terms of industrial output for nine straight years.[citation needed]\n\nThere are now 29 (registered) industrial areas with 3,696 ha (9,130 acres) of non-urban industrial land and 3,131 ha (7,740 acres) of urban industrial land. There are over 6,827 ha (16,870 acres) of land available for factories and industrial use in the city, representing the fact that Taoyuan's development bureau is based on industry and commerce. There are also 9 sites (57 ha; 140 acres) for mixed industrial-commercial use, the most of any county and city in Taiwan.[15]\n\nOn 26 March 2010, China Airlines (Taiwan's government-owned airline) moved into its new headquarters on the grounds of Taipei Taoyuan International Airport and in Dayuan Township in Taoyuan County (now Dayuan District, Taoyuan).[16][17] EVA Air maintains its headquarters in Luzhu District.[18] Evergreen Airlines Services Corporation, Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corp., and Evergreen Air Cargo Services Corporation, subsidiaries of Evergreen Group, are headquartered in Dayuan.[19][20][21]\n\nOn 25 December 2016, The Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency (ASVDA) was inaugurated in northern Taoyuan City, in a governmental effort to foster innovation, promote the Internet of Things (IoT) sector and attract top-class technology talent. The Asia Silicon Valley Development Plan aimed to transform Taiwan into an R&D hub for the IoT sector as well as a global center of entrepreneurship.[22]\n\nIndustry and environment\n\n[edit]\n\nA former RCA facility is located in the city.
