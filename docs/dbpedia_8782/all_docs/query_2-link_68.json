        "text": "Overview of the Top Banks in Taiwan\n\nAs one of the world’s most advanced economies, the top banks in Taiwan have huge assets and strong capabilities. In this article, we’ll take a look at the ranking of the top banks in Taiwan. This list of top banks in Taiwan is a helpful guide for anyone pursuing a banking career in the region.\n\nIn Taiwan, the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Financial Supervisory Commission regulate the banking sector. There are tens of banks and thousands of branches spread across island.\n\nList of Top Banks in Taiwan\n\nSince this article is about banks that accept deposits, we rank the top banks in Taiwan by their assets. This differs from investment banking, which the industry ranks based on M&A or capital raising volume. Taiwan has a limited investment banking scene. While there certainly exist investment banking activities in Taiwan, it’s relatively small compared to the volume in Hong Kong.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the top banks in Taiwan are domestic companies. Postal Remittances and Savings Bank, Bank of Taiwan, CTBC Bank and the Taiwan Cooperative Bank lead the market. Among the top 16 banks in Taiwan, 15 banks are headquartered in Taipei. That shouldn’t be surprising because Taipei is the financial capital of Taiwan. Among all of Taiwan’s cities, Taipei has the most developed transportation infrastructure and most sophisticated financial network. Only 1 bank, the Chang Hwa Bank, is headquartered outside of Taipei.\n\n1. Bank of Taiwan (臺灣銀行)\n\nBOT is the abbreviated name for the Bank of Taiwan. BOT’s predecessor is the Bank of Taiwan Kabushiki-gaisha, which the Japanese established in 1899 during its ruling period. After Taiwan took back governance from Japan, the government changed the bank’s name to Bank of Taiwan. It is Taiwan’s first government-owned bank. As is the case with many other state-owned banks, BOT has the most amount of assets in the industry. It also has the widest presence across the island.

It issued the first credit card and set up the first banking customer service center in Taiwan. It has a wide network of branches across Taiwan and overseas, including US, Canada, Philippines, and Indonesia. CTBC’s headquarters is in Taipei.\n\n3.

It’s a public company trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Like many of its peers, Mega ICBC also established its headquarters in Taipei.\n\n5. First Commercial Bank / First Bank (‎第一銀行)\n\nFirst Commercial Bank (or First Bank) was originally established on November 12, 1899 as Savings Bank of Taiwan. Over the century, it pursued several M&A transactions. Consequently, it merged with Commercial and Industrial Bank of Taiwan, Chia-I Bank and Hsin-Kao Bank to become the First Bank as we know it today. It has hundreds of branches spread across Taiwan and overseas. In terms of total assets and Tier 1 Capital, First Commercial Bank is among the world’s top 250 banks.

Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank (台北富邦商業銀行)\n\nFounded in 2005, Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank is the surviving entity following the merger of Taipei Bank and Fubon Bank. It is the banking subsidiary of Fubon Financial parent company. Fubon Financial has a wide range of businesses in the financial services sector beyond just banking. The bank is one of the top companies in Taiwan but it’s merely a unit within the larger Fubon organization. It is aggressively expanding its operations overseas in Southeast Asia.

E.SUN Commercial Bank (玉山商業銀行)\n\nContrary to what it might seem at first glance, E.SUN’s name does not mean “electronic sun” or “digital sun”. Rather, E.SUN is the English phonetic name of its Chinese name, which means “jade mountain”. Founded in 1992, E.SUN Bank quickly grew to become one of Taiwan’s largest banks. That’s partially because the bank is a subsidiary of the Taiwanese financial giant E.SUN Financial Holding Company. The parent company has operations across banking, securities, investing, and consulting. E.SUN Bank serves retail customers as well as large corporations. E.SUN Bank’s headquarters is in Taipei.\n\n11. Chang Hwa Bank (彰化銀行)\n\nCHB is the abbreviated name for the Chang Hwa Bank.

Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank (上海商業儲蓄銀行)\n\nIn 1915, Chen Guangfu founded the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank. At the time, the bank was operating in Shanghai and became one of Mainland China’s top private banks. Following the defeat of the Chinese Nationalist Party by the Chinese Communist Party during China’s civil war, the bank followed the Chinese Nationalist Party and transferred its assets and operations to Taiwan. Hence, the bank has little presence in Shanghai city despite its namesake. Rather, most of its operations are concentrated in Taiwan. Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank’s headquarters is in Taipei.\n\n13. Taishin International Bank (台新國際商業銀行)\n\nFounded in 1992, Taishin Bank is one of the leading banks in Taiwan.

Taiwan’s postal office not only take mails, but also deposits. Because the postal office has a network of over a thousand post offices across the island, it has the single largest share of Taiwan’s deposit market. However, its services are primarily related to savings and remittance. It doesn’t offer as wide range of financial services as a pure bank.\n\nFull Ranking of Top Banks in Taiwan\n\nHere’s a more complete ranking of the top 30 banks in Taiwan.\n\nPreparing for a Career with the Top Banks in Taiwan\n\nLumovest is the finest institution in the world to learn financial and investment analysis.
