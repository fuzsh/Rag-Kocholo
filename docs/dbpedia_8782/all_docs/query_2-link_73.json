        "text": "As a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean, it is easy and convenient to visit many of Taiwan’s cities and towns. Beyond its capital city of Taipei, Taiwan is a special place filled with amazing scenery, people and food. There are many other cities in Taiwan worth exploring, and the good news is it’s easy to travel around this small island nation. No matter where you go in Taiwan, you are guaranteed to have an amazing time and learn a lot about the culture and history of this beautiful island nation.\n\nTo travel to cities such as Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Hualien or Kaohsiung, use public buses or the MRT metro (only in Taipei and Taichung) to sight-see within these cities. Renting a scooter or car is recommended if you visit smaller cities such as Taitung and Pingtung. You must have an international driver’s licence to rent a scooter or car. Even though smaller cities and towns do not have the convenient public transit as larger cities, they are still worth visiting for amazing food, culture and gorgeous scenic destinations, especially on the east coast (think giant mountains with cliffsides dropping into the Pacific Ocean).\n\nGetting Around Taiwan\n\nTaiwan’s public transportation will take you anywhere you want to visit, with the High-Speed Rail (HSR) on the west coast and Taiwan Railways (TRA) on both the east and west coasts.\n\nThe HSR only operates on the west coast because the east coast of Taiwan is too mountainous to have a high-speed train, and the TRA on the east coast travels significantly slower than the HSR, making it a safe mode of transportation on the east coast.\n\nThe TRA is also more affordable than the HSR, so if you want to save money, you can still take the TRA on the west coast.\n\nHSR round trip tickets can reach up to 3000 NTD, while TRA ticket prices vary on destination but are less expensive than HSR tickets.\n\nYou can also take long-distance buses if you’re on a tight budget, but the trains are faster and more convenient.\n\nCities in Taiwan\n\n20 Taiwanese Cities And Towns To Visit In 2023\n\n1- Taipei\n\nIn the north, Taipei city is the capital of Taiwan.\n\nThis metropolis has fantastic and inexpensive public transportation, great hiking trails in the mountains surrounding the city, art and history museums, a fun nightlife with many clubs and bars to choose from, and of course, great shopping areas for souvenirs or anything else you may need.\n\nNotable destinations include the National Palace Museum, featuring art pieces and artefacts from ancient China, Taipei 101, the tallest building in Taiwan and a beautiful feature in the city’s skyline.\n\nDihua Street is one of the oldest streets in Taiwan and is filled with souvenirs and traditional goods.\n\nElephant mountain is a hike with excellent views of Taipei 101 and the city.\n\nThere are also many night markets, such as Roahe, Shilin and Ningxia.\n\nRecommended tour: Ultimate Taipei Sightseeing Tour\n\n2- Kaohsiung\n\nIn southern Taiwan, Kaohsiung is Taiwan’s largest industrial centre.\n\nKaohsiung has numerous tourist attractions, such as renting a boat and enjoying a nice ride on the Love River, hiking at Shoushan (Mt.
