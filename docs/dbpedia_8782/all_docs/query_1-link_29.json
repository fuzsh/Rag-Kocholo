        "text": "New Taipei City is a special municipality and the most populous city in Taiwan.\n\nLocated in northern Taiwan, the city includes a substantial stretch of the island's northern coastline and surrounds the Taipei Basin, making it the second largest special municipality by area, behind Kaohsiung. New Taipei City is bordered by Keelung to the northeast, Yilan County to the southeast, and Taoyuan to the southwest.\n\nIt completely surrounds Taipei. Banqiao District is its municipal seat and biggest commercial area. Until 2010, the area that roughly corresponds to the present New Taipei City was known as Taipei County.\n\nHistory\n\nArchaeological records show that New Taipei City had been inhabited since the Neolithic period, with artifacts dug in Bali District having shown remains as early as 7000 to 4700 BC.\n\nThe region around New Taipei City area was once inhabited by Ketagalan plains aborigines, and evidence shows that the Atayal had inhabited Wulai District. The earliest recorded migration by people from mainland China dated back as early as 1620, when the local tribes were driven into the mountain areas. Over the years, many of the aborigines have assimilated into the general population.\n\nQing Dynasty\n\nDuring the Qing Dynasty rule of Taiwan, the Han Chinese people began to settle in the area now designated as New Taipei City in 1694 and the number of immigrants from mainland China had further increased. After decades of development and prosperity, Tamsui had become an international commercial port by 1850. British consulate and stores were established in the region, which helped promote the local tea business, resulting in massive tea leaf exports to Europe. In 1875, Shen Baozhen called for the establishment of Taipeh Prefecture. Fujian-Taiwan-Province was declared in 1887 and the present-day New Taipei City area fell under the jurisdiction of Taipeh Prefecture.\n\nJapanese rule\n\nIn 1895, Taiwan was ceded by the Qing dynasty to the Empire of Japan. During Japanese rule, the New Taipei City area was administered under Taihoku Prefecture together with modern-day Taipei, Keelung and Yilan County. Gold and other mineral deposits were discovered at Keelung Mountain, triggering a mining boom in the region.\n\nIn October 1896, the Japanese government divided the mining area around Keelung Mountain into two districts: an eastern district, designated as Kinkaseki, and a western district, designated as Kyūfun. Both districts are now parts of Ruifang District. They also issued regulations barring local Taiwanese mining companies from mining in the area, giving the mining rights to Japanese companies instead.\n\nPost-war\n\nAfter the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in October 1945, from 25 December of the same year, the present New Taipei City area was administered as Taipei County with Banqiao City as the county seat. In July 1949, the size of Taipei County was reduced when Beitou and Shilin townships were put under the jurisdiction of the newly created Caoshan Administrative Bureau, which would later be renamed the Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau. On July 1, 1968, the size of Taipei County was further reduced by 205.16 km2 (79.21 sq mi) when Jingmei, Muzha, Nangang, and Neihu townships, along with Beitou and Shilin, were merged into Taipei City.\n\nThe county afterward had ten county-controlled cities.\n\nOn 25 December 2010, Taipei County was upgraded to a special municipality as New Taipei City consisting of 29 districts with Banqiao District as the municipal seat.\n\nGeography\n\nNew Taipei City is located at the northern tip of Taiwan Island.
