        "text": "Taoyuan is a special municipality in northwestern Taiwan, neighboring New Taipei City, Hsinchu County, and Yilan County. Taoyuan District is the seat of the municipal government and which, along with Zhongli District, forms a large metropolitan area.”Taoyuan” means “peach garden” in Chinese, since the area used to have many peach trees. The city is home to many industrial parks and tech company headquarters. Taoyuan International Airport, which serves the capital, Taipei and the rest of northern Taiwan, is located in this city.\n\nTaoyuan is located approximately 40 km (25 mi) southwest of Taipei, in northern Taiwan, and occupies 1,220 km2 (470 sq mi). It is made up of low-lying plains, interconnected mountains and plateaus. Its shape has a long and narrow southeast-to-northwest trend, with the southeast in the Xueshan Range and the far end on the shores of the Taiwan Strait.There are many irrigation ponds at Taoyuan Plateau, which caused Taoyuan to earn the nickname “Thousand-pond Township”."
