        "text": "These days, it seems like there are historic Japanese-era buildings re-opening in every corner of the country. From top to bottom, the Taiwanese government has invested heavily in the restoration of these buildings and there isn’t a week that goes by that I don’t hear about the opening of something new.\n\nThe sudden onslaught of so many new places to visit certainly isn’t something that one should lament, it keeps me busy, but its admittedly becoming quite difficult to prioritize where and when to visit these historic buildings, converted into historic culture parks.\n\nThis one though was a no-brainer. I’ve been waiting quite a while for these dorms to reopen.\n\nNot only are they close to home, they’re also across the street from a former Martial Arts Hall.\n\nMy visit to the former Longtan Elementary Teachers Dorms was a little like killing two birds with one stone as I got to take new photos of the Martial Arts Hall, and explore the interior while also visiting these beautiful, completely restored dormitories, which if you’re asking me, are pretty damn picturesque.\n\nI’m not going to waste too much time blathering on today, so lets just get into it.\n\nLongtan Teachers Dorms (龍潭國小日式老師宿舍)\n\nHaving recently celebrated its 120th anniversary, Longtan Elementary School (龍潭國民小學) is a proud member of a short list of historic Taiwanese educational institutions that date back to the earliest years of Japanese colonial rule that remain open today.\n\nConstructed in 1899 (明治32年) as a Public School (公校 / こうがっこう) for children between the ages of eight and fourteen, one of the colonial government’s earliest successes was their offer of a formal education, which for the first time in Taiwan’s history was opened up to anyone willing to learn, rather than only those who could afford it.\n\nClasses at Public Schools initially only offered language training in reading (讀書), writing (習字), composition (作文), Math (算術), Music (音樂), and Physical Education (健身), but this is something that changed quickly as the island developed, and larger schools were constructed allowing the education system to become much more refined.\n\nBefore I talk about Longtan Elementary though, I think it’s important that we first talk a bit about the Longtan (龍潭) of the Japanese era, which was considerably different than it is today.\n\nDuring the Japanese-era, The “Taoyuan City” (桃園市) that we know today was merely a district (郡) of what was known as Shinchiku Prefecture (新竹州 / しんちくしゅう).\n\nLocated in the area south of Taipei, or “Taihoku” (台北州廳), Shinchiku Prefecture encompassed much of what we refer to now as Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli (桃竹苗), with the capital of the prefecture located in Shinchiku City (新竹市 / しんちくし).\n\nAs much of Taiwan was yet to have started to develop at the time, the large cities that we know today as Taoyuan (桃園), Zhongli (中壢), Zhudong (竹東) and Miaoli (苗栗), for example were much smaller settlements at the time, so they were merely classified as ‘districts’ (郡) that were subdivisions of the larger prefecture and could have been broken down into towns and villages.\n\nWhen we talk about the administrative area known as Ryutansho, it’s important to note that during the fifty years of Japanese rule, the colonial government redrew Taiwan’s administrative maps on several occasions.\n\nOver that period however, not much changed in terms of Ryutansho’s geography, and the smaller villages and settlements that were within it apart from it being upgraded as a town in the late 1930s.\n\nComing equipped with an Assembly Hall (龍潭庄役場 / りゅうたんしょうやくば), Post Office (龍潭郵便局 / りゅうたんしょうゆうびんきょく), Ryutansho Police Precinct (大溪郡警察課龍潭分室), Martial Arts Hall (龍潭武德殿), and more importantly, the Ryutansho Public School (新竹州龍潭公學校), the downtown area of Ryutansho developed with these important public buildings in mind, and to this day continues to retain much of the urban design left behind by the Japanese.\n\nIn 1899, when the Public School was first opened, it was simply named Ryumoto Public School (龍元公學校 / りゅうもとこうがっこう), but was later expanded and renamed Longtan Public School (龍潭陂公學校) in 1908, and being one the only educational institutions in the area, it played an important role in the development of the village.\n\nThat being said, even though the school has been around for over 120 years, it has continually expanded over that period of time and even now as part of the anniversary celebrations, an entirely new section is being added to the campus. With that in mind, it’s important to note that it wasn’t actually until 1919 (大正8年) that the teachers dormitories started to appear on campus.\n\nInitially there was only one, but as time went by (and the school expanded) several more were constructed next to each other, with a total of seven dormitories constructed by 1938 (昭和13年). Taking almost two decades to build all of them, when you visit today you’ll find a bit of difference in their architectural styles with those constructed between 1928 (昭和3年) and 1938 (昭和1年) in particular showing off the architectural styles of the Showa era.\n\nIf you’re reading this and wondering why anyone would take time out of their day to write an article about dormitories, it’s important to note that these ‘dorms’ aren’t the same as what you’re probably thinking. These “dorms” were constructed like traditional Japanese-style homes and unlike your typical university-style dorm, were relatively comfortable.\n\nThe earliest dorms constructed at the school were pretty basic in that they weren’t all that large and were constructed solely for single teachers. What came later however was much more refined amd were suitable for teachers and their families, and spoke to the commitment that the colonial government had to constructing quality residences for educators.\n\nAccording to records, there were five teachers dorms located along the eastern edge of the campus, but when you visit the culture park today, you’ll notice that there are only three buildings.\n\nThis isn’t because they’ve torn down any of the dorms, they’re all still there.\n\nIt’s simply because the two larger dorms were effectively split into two, while the smaller one was where all the single teachers would have lived.\n\nOfficially #3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 on Nanlong Road (南龍路), there is also a Principal’s Residence (校長宿舍) on the other side of the school’s eastern entrance that has been completely reconstructed, but has yet to re-open to the public. There was likewise another dorm located to the right of the Principals Residence, but it collapsed quite a while ago and the space it occupied is now being used by a newer building as part of the school campus.\n\nTo better explain each of the dorms, I’m going to separate them based on the official map used by the culture park (below) and identify each of the buildings by their address.\n\nI promise that I’m not going to go into too much detail about the specific architectural style of each of the buildings like I usually do. The reason for this is that the subsequent years after the colonial era (in addition to the restoration of the buildings) altered them significantly from their original architectural designs.\n\nThat being said, while the exterior of the buildings doesn’t really do all that much for me, especially with all the ‘cute’ decorations that have been added to the landscaping, the interior of the buildings is absolutely beautiful, and I think the photos should speak for themselves that these dorms would have been really nice to live in.\n\nBefore I get into the differences in the dorms, it’s probably easier to talk about their similarities.\n\nIts important to note that these Japanese style dormitories follow a basic design rule in that each of them, no matter if they’re a single or a shared dwelling, must consist of the following three spaces: A living space (起居空間), a service space (服務空間) and a passage space (通行空間).\n\nThe living space is considerably different than what we’re used to in western standards as what we might consider a “living room” is actually a brilliant multi-functional space where the family can receive guests, hang out, have their meals, drink tea and sleep.\n\nEach of the dorms have been constructed using the irimoya-zukuri (入母屋造) style of design, which basically means that the base of the building is smaller than the roof, the weight of which is supported by a network of trusses (屋架) constructed in the ceiling that help to support the weight of the four-sided sloped hip roof (四坡頂). However, even though the roof of these dorms follows a traditional Japanese architectural design, they obviously can’t be compared to what you’d find on a temple or shrine, which are much more elaborate.\n\nWhen the buildings were restored, the original roof tiles were replaced with plastic-looking black tiles. Similarly, the wooden shitamiita (下見版 / したみいた) siding on the buildings has been completely replaced. The siding is still too new and is quite dark in colour, but as they age the colours will fade and they’ll look more like what you’d expect from a Japanese building of this kind.\n\n#3 Nanlong Road Single Dormitories (獨棟房舍)\n\nLocated on the corner of Nanlong Road (南龍路) and Donglong Road (東龍路), the Number 3 dormitory was the the smallest of all the dorms and was originally used as a shared accommodation for single teachers (獨棟房舍).\n\nThe interior of the building features a couple of rooms, which would have been used as a living space and a service space as mentioned above.\n\nRecords don’t really indicate how many teachers lived inside the dorm, but I can’t imagine they would have crammed a bunch of people inside as the building is considerably smaller than the others.\n\nToday the dorm is used as a Tourist Information Centre (遊客服務中心) and is where you’ll find some helpful people that will assist in introducing you to the culture park.\n\n#5-7 Nanlong Road Family-style Shared Dormitories (雙併二戶建宿舍)\n\nThe Number 5-7 building is a ‘family-style shared dormitory’ that was essentially split into two, which I suppose you could compare to a duplex in the west. This allowed for two families to take up residence within the building, which was split down the middle and featured entrances on both the front and back.\n\nWhen the colonial era ended and the Japanese left Taiwan, the house was occupied for quite some time and several modifications were made to the interior and exterior of the building. That being said, the restoration process was quite successful in returning much of the dorm to its original layout, and the interior is quite beautiful, especially on a sunny day when the wood in the building shines in the sun.\n\nOf the three dorm buildings, the Number 9-11 house is probably the most important with regard to the contemporary use of the dorms - and probably one of the main reasons why they were ultimately protected as heritage sites by the government.\n\nThe dorm was home to author Chung Chao-Cheng and his family both before and after the colonial era in his capacity as an educator at Longtan Elementary School (more on that later).\n\nWhile the other two buildings have been faithfully restored to their original architectural design and layout, this building wasn’t changed very much during the restoration process due to its significance as the home of the iconic author. With this in mind, you’ll notice that there are a number of modifications to the building, including the addition of a cement kitchen and dining room that extends from the far left of the building.\n\nThe sad thing about the life of this famed author is that for much of it, he lived in relative poverty. So, in addition to his teachers salary, he made a little extra cash to support his large family by raising pigs to be sold at the local market as well as birds to be sold as pets. To that effect, when you visit today you’ll still find a pig pen located in front of the house (there aren’t any pigs in it) in addition to some of his old bird cages within the front porch of the building on the opposite site.\n\nThe interior of the building has certainly been fixed up quite a bit, restoring many of the original Japanese elements of the design, but there are quite a few of Chung Chao-Cheng’s personal belongings that have been left in place to help to tell the story of his life.\n\nChung Chao-Cheng (鍾肇政) lived the better part of his life in the Longtan Elementary School Dorms. During his formative years, his father was a teacher at the school, which allowed for his rather large family to stay in the dorms. He then later following in his father’s footsteps and became a teacher at the school, where he ultimately spent much of his professional career.\n\nThat being said, the teaching career of Chung Chao-Cheng is not what he’s best known for.\n\nRising to fame with his novel, “The Dull Ice Flower” (魯冰花) in 1960, Chung was an award-winning author who wrote over one hundred and fifty short stories and forty novels. Known for his promotion of Taiwanese nativist literature (鄉土文學), and his lifelong battle to promote Hakka language and culture.\n\nWith his “Taiwanese Trilogy” (台灣人三部曲), Chung authored one of the most authoritative works on the modern history of Taiwan, highlighting the nativist theme that depicted the Taiwanese people’s struggle for existence, identity and self-determination.\n\nLink: Taiwan Nativist Literature | 台灣鄉土文學論戰 (Wiki)\n\nPart of the ‘translingual generation’, Chung was a speaker of Japanese, Taiwanese, Hakka and Mandarin, but (like everyone else in Taiwan at the time) was forced to speak the latter in his capacity as an educator by the Chinese Nationalist-led government.\n\nThe suppression of Taiwan’s native languages by the Chinese Nationalists was an issue that was near and dear to Chung’s heart and he used his notoriety as an author to become one of the key figures in the Hakka Language Restoration Movement (還我客家母語運動) which fought for the basic right to speak Hakka in public.\n\nChung’s battle resulted in the eventual formation of the Taiwan Hakka Association for Public Affairs (台灣客家公共事務協會) in 1990, the Formosa Hakka Radio Station (寶島客家廣播電台) in 1994, and the Hakka Affairs Council (客家委員會) in 2001.\n\nToday the preservation and promotion of Hakka culture and language is experiencing somewhat of a renaissance all around Taiwan, and Chung Chao-Cheng will forever be recognized as one of the key figures in the struggle to keep Hakka culture alive.\n\nHaving lived in the teachers dorms during the Japanese-era as a child, Chung took a job as a teacher at Longtan Elementary in 1946 (民國39年) and worked there until 1979 (民國68年), during which time he authored many of his most famous literary works.\n\nWhen the Taoyuan City Government registered the dormitories as Protected Historic Buildings (歷史建築) in 2012 (民國101年), plans were made to restore the buildings and open them up to the public. In most cases with these historic properties, the government has to think long and hard to come up with ideas for how to properly use the space, especially after investing so much money on their restoration.\n\nIn this case however, it was a no-brainer.\n\nLink: The Role Of Public-Private Partnerships In Conserving Historic Buildings In Taiwan\n\nHowever, with NT $30,000,000 provided by the Hakka Affairs Council and $10,000,000 from the local government, investment in the restoration of these dorms went well over $1,000,000 USD, so it was never going to be a space that was wasted.\n\nSo even though I’ve titled this article, “Longtan Teachers Dorms”, they’re officially known today as the Chung Chao-Cheng Literary Park (鍾肇政文學生活園區), and includes all of the dorms in addition to the former Martial Arts Hall (龍潭武德殿) across the street from the school.\n\nAnd I’m guessing in the future will also include the recently restored Principal’s dorm.\n\nShowcasing the life and the literary works of Mr. Chung, the culture park is a celebration of his life and allows guests to respectfully enjoy the beautiful Japanese architecture of the buildings, while also learning about this important Taiwanese figure.\n\nCar / Scooter\n\nIf you’re driving a car, simply input the address or the GPS coordinates provided above into Google Maps or your preferred GPS system and you shouldn’t have much trouble finding your way.\n\nIts important to note however that the park is located within the downtown core of Longtan and is near the local wet market, which makes the area quite busy and difficult to find parking.\n\nIf you plan on visiting, you’ll want to take note of the two paid parking lots on Lane #200 of Donglong Road, which is adjacent to the nearby Martial Arts Hall.\n\nIf you’re riding a scooter out to Longtan, you should be able to easily find a parking spot along the road near the hall, but don’t park directly in front as you may end up getting a ticket.\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nIf you’re coming from Taipei, there are a number of options for getting to Longtan.\n\nKuo-Kuang Bus #1820 (國光客運) Taipei (台北) - Chu-dong (竹東)\n\nTaiwan United Bus #5350 (台聯客運) Taipei (台北) - Leofoo Village (六福村)\n\nYalan Bus #1728 (亞聯客運) Taipei (台北) - Longtan (龍潭) - Hsinchu (新竹)\n\nTaoyuan Bus #712 (桃園客運) Yongning MRT Station (捷運永寧站) - Longtan (龍潭)\n\nUnited Bus #709 (統聯客運) Yongning MRT Station (捷運永寧站) - Ping Chen (平鎮)\n\nIf you’re taking the train to Taoyuan, the closest railway stations are the Taoyuan Railway Station and Zhongli Station and from each, you’ll have to transfer to a local bus.\n\nFrom Taoyuan Railway Station (桃園火車站)\n\nTaoyuan Bus #5053 (桃園客運) Taoyuan (桃園) - Longtan (龍潭)\n\nTaoyuan Bus #712 (桃園客運) Yongning MRT Station (捷運永寧站) - Longtan (龍潭)\n\nFrom Zhongli Railway Station (中壢火車站)\n\nZhongli Bus #701 (中壢客運) 804 Hospital (804醫院) - Linkou Hospital (林口長庚醫院)\n\nHsinchu Bus #5671 (新竹客運) Zhongli (中壢) - 804 Hospital (804醫院)\n\nFor these Zhongli Buses, you’ll have to walk from the Railway Station down Chung Cheng Road (中正路) to the Zhongli Police Precinct (中壢分局) to get the bus. The bus stop is located opposite the Japanese-era Police Dorm Culture Park, on Yan-Ping Road (延平路), but is also well worth a visit if you’re there.\n\nWhen I arrived in Taiwan, I wasted little time getting myself a scooter.\n\nWhen you’re not living in Taipei, a scooter is probably one of the most important purchases you’ll make during your time in Taiwan and once I got one, a whole new world of exploration opened up for my friends and myself.\n\nOn one of our earlier scooter expeditions, we set off for a place in Taoyuan to check out the night view of the Taoyuan cityscape on the top of Tiger Head Mountain (虎頭山).\n\nHaving arrived a couple of hours before sunset, we noticed a sign for the Taoyuan Confucius Temple (桃園孔廟) and decided to stop in and check it out. After that we started making our way up towards the mountaintop when I noticed an old stone post on the side of the road that read “Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine” (桃園忠烈祠).\n\nI stopped the convoy scooters and ran up the set of stairs to check out what was at the top.\n\nSurprisingly, I found a beautiful (but somewhat unkept) Japanese-looking shrine.\n\nAs the years passed, I went back to visit quite a few more times and ended up writing a blog about it, which was one of my first on the subject of Japanese Colonial Era buildings.\n\nThen the shrine closed for an extended period of restoration and during those years, I started to write write extensively about other shrines like this around the country, and ended up coming to the conclusion that the information that I offered readers in this one just wasn’t good enough.\n\nSo now I’m back, with an updated version that has more information and new photos.\n\nAnd just to warn you, I’m not going to be brief on the information. This is going to be a deep dive into the history and architecture of this historic shrine.\n\nWhich is why I’m going to be splitting it into two different articles.\n\nBefore I start though, let me take a minute to explain something I think is important.\n\nIf you’re looking for this shrine elsewhere on the web, you’ll find it in most places officially named the “Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine” (桃園忠烈祠). Honestly though, the latter is a role that has significantly diminished in recent years, especially after the current administrative restructuring and period of restoration that took place. So, I’m going to try to refer to it as the “Taoyuan Shinto Shrine” (桃園神社).\n\nThis isn’t a political stance, nor is it a knock on its current role as a Martyrs Shrine, it’s because this shrine is the one of the worlds most well-preserved and most complete Shinto Shrines outside of Japan.\n\nI’d be remiss though if I didn’t mention that one of my projects in recent years has been to visit Taiwan’s Martyrs Shrines and chronicle their history. This isn’t because I have an affinity for war-memorials, it is because the majority of these shrines were once home to some of Taiwan’s largest Shinto Shrines, like this one. If you’d like to learn more about Taiwan’s various Martyrs Shrines, I recommend taking a look at my article about the National Revolutionary Martyrs’ Shrine in Taipei, where I take a deep dive into the history of these shrines and provide links to the other Martyrs Shrines/Shinto Shrines that I’ve already covered.\n\nTaiwan was once home to over two hundred Shinto Shrines of all shapes and sizes but only a handful of these shrines continue to exist. The Taoyuan Shinto Shrine, unlike so many others has been fortunate to have been able to stand the test of time and is now one of the nation’s most significant windows into an important period of its modern history.\n\nAnother thing that you should know is that as of this update, I’ll be splitting the article into two. This part will focus only on the history of the Shinto Shrine and the Martyrs Shrine while the second part will provide an in-depth description of its architectural design how to get there.\n\nI hope that you find all of this interesting enough to read both parts.\n\nTaoyuan Shinto Shrine (桃園神社 / とうえんじんじゃ)\n\nBefore we get into the history of the shrine, we have to talk a bit about a few important events that took place prior to its construction.\n\nDuring the Japanese Colonial Era, Taiwan was divided into eight different administrative districts, Taihoku (台北州), Karenko (花蓮港廳), Taito (台東廳), Takao (高雄州), Tainan (台南州), Taichu (台中州), Hoko (澎湖廳) and Shinchiku (新竹州).\n\nThe “Taoyuan” as we know it today was simply a district within Shinchiku (しんちくしゅう), named Toengai (桃園街 /とうえんぐん) and included these four villages:\n\nRochikusho (蘆竹庄), currently Luzhu District (蘆竹區)\n\nOsonosho (大園庄), currently Dayuan District (大園區)\n\nKizansho (龜山庄), currently Guishan District (龜山區)\n\nHakkaisho (八塊庄), currently Bade District (八德區)\n\nNote: It is interesting to see that the majority of the names of these districts have been kept more or less the same, save for the conversion to Chinese pronunciation.\n\nAs “Toen” at that time was an administrative district under Shinchiku, it didn’t actually require a large Shinto Shrine as the Shinchiku Shrine (新竹神社 / しんちくじんじゃ) had it covered. Smaller neighbourhood shrines, like the Luye Shinto Shrine in Taitung, would have been sufficient and quite a few of them were constructed around the prefecture.\n\nLink: List of Shinto Shrines in Taiwan | 台灣神社列表 (Wiki)\n\nThat was until 1934 (昭和9年), when the colonial government passed a resolution that every village and town should have its own shrine (一街庄一社), which started the process of constructing shrines all over Taiwan, and is why (you’ll see in the link above) most of the larger shrines in Taiwan were constructed between 1934 and 1945.\n\nThis policy of constructing shrines all over Taiwan was the precursor to a much more nefarious decision that the government would take just a few years later to forcibly convert the entire population into Japanese subjects who were loyal to the empire and State Shinto.\n\nOfficially starting in 1936 (昭和11年), the \"Kominka\" policy (皇民化運動), which literally means to “force people to become subjects of the empire,” is more commonly known today as “Japanization” or forced assimilation. This was essentially one of the most desperate attempts by the Japanese, who were embroiled in war across Asia, attempting to expand their empire.\n\nThe policy expanded upon the mere construction of Shinto Shrines to converting or destroying local places of worship, enforcing strict language polices, requiring people to take Japanese names and instituting the “volunteers system” (志願兵制度), drafting Taiwanese into the Imperial Army.\n\nLink: Japanization | 皇民化運動 (Wiki)\n\nThe Taoyuan Shinto Shrine, like so many of its contemporaries around Taiwan was constructed just as these policies started to take root and was tasked with assisting in ‘uniting’ the people and inspiring Japanese patriotism, or the \"Japanese spirit, \" known as Yamato-damashii (大和魂).\n\nWhen the shrine was constructed, it was one of hundreds that were built around the island to help ease the population with their transition into life as citizens of the Japanese empire.\n\nToday, less than a handful of them remain in existence.\n\nPlanning for the Taoyuan Shinto Shrine started in 1935 (昭和10年), and was designed by Haruta Naonobu (春田直信), a well-known architect and founder of the Haruta Architecture Company (春天建設) in Nagoya.\n\nWhile Haruta’s architectural design stuck to a traditional Japanese layout, the buildings at the shrine feature what could be argued a ‘fusion’ of Chinese design that dates back to the Tang Dynasty (唐朝) with that of Japanese Nagare-zukuri (流造) design.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that Japanese architecture has been highly influenced by that of the architecture of the Tang, so it wasn’t very likely an obvious nod on the part of Haruta to design the shrine in this way, which could be argued represented the heritage of the people who lived here prior to the arrival of the Japanese.\n\nThe shrine was constructed facing the south-west and in a direct axis of the Taoyuan Train Station (桃園車站), which showed the importance of the station as the heart of the town and Japanese style urban development.\n\nAs a show of the relationship between Taiwan and the rest of Japan, the shrine was constructed with a mixture of cypress (檜木) from the mountains of central Taiwan as well as Japanese cedar (日本柳杉).\n\nGiven Taiwan’s position as a new addition to the Japanese empire, ‘nation-building’ and the association of a Japanese-style way of life was something that was being pushed on the local people in more ways than one.\n\nLikewise, considering the economy at the time was largely agricultural-based, it was important that the gods enshrined reflected that aspect of life.\n\nToyoke no Omikami (豐受大神 / トヨウケビメノカミ)\n\nThe female deity ‘Toyoke no Omikami’ is a deity that hails from Japanese mythology known simply as the Japanese ‘Goddess of Food,’ but is more specifically referred to as the Goddess of Agriculture and Industry. Residing at the Ise Grand Shrine (伊勢神宮), the goddess is known to provide food for her counterpart, the sun goddess Amaterasu (天照大神).\n\nThe first mention of these four deities was in the “Birth of the Gods” (神生み) section of Japan’s all-important ‘Kojiki’ (古事記), or “Records of Ancient Matters”, a thirteen-century old chronicle of myths, legends and early accounts of Japanese history, which were later appropriated into Shintoism.\n\nEmperor Meiji (明治天皇)\n\nEmperor Meiji was the 122nd Emperor of Japan and one of the most consequential, presiding over an era of rapid change in the country that saw Japan transform from a feudal state with no connection to the outside world to an industrialized world power.\n\nConsidered one of the greatest emperors in Japanese history, the 45 year-long Meiji Era (明治) is fondly remembered for its political, social and economic revolutions, bringing Japan out of the dark and cementing its footing as a major world power.\n\nHaving presided over the Sino-Japanese war that resulted in the Treaty of Shimonoseki (下關條約), Emperor Meiji added Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to his empire in 1895, starting what would become a fifty year of colonial rule of the islands.\n\nUpon his death in 1912 (明治42年), the emperor was deified and the Meiji Shrine (明治神宮) was constructed in his honour, which consequently became one of the most important shrines in Japan, and was constructed using cypress exported from Taiwan.\n\nLink: Meiji Emperor | Meiji Shrine (Wiki)\n\nAs the emperor who oversaw Taiwan’s addition to the empire and the first two decades of its modern development, it should be no surprise that his worship would be included in most of Taiwan’s largest shrines.\n\nPrince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa (北白川宮能久親王)\n\nInterestingly, the Meiji Emperor wasn’t the only member of the Japanese royal family who was enshrined within the Taoyuan Shinto Shrine. Prince Yoshihisa, a western educated Major-General in the Japanese imperial army was commissioned to participate in the invasion of Taiwan after the island was ceded to the empire.\n\nUnfortunately for the Prince, he contracted malaria and died in either modern day Hsinchu or Tainan (where he died is disputed), making him the first member of the Japanese royal family to pass away while outside of Japan in more than nine hundred years in addition to being the first to die in war.\n\nShortly after his death he was elevated to the status of a ‘kami’ under state Shinto and was given the name “Kitashirakawa no Miya Yoshihisa-shinno no Mikoto“, and subsequently became one of the most important patron deities here in Taiwan, as well as being enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine (靖國神社) in Tokyo.\n\nLink: Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa (Wiki)\n\nThe Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine (桃園忠烈祠)\n\nWhen the Japanese surrendered to the allies at the end of the war, control of Taiwan was ambiguously handed over to Chiang Kai-Shek (蔣中正) and the Republic of China.\n\nThe Sino-Japanese War had caused a lot of resentment for the Japanese among the Chinese population and upon arrival in Taiwan, both the leaders of the ROC government in China and the refugees who eventually came to Taiwan had a difficult time understanding why so many people here looked upon their period of Japanese rule with so little disdain.\n\nIn the short time that the Japanese controlled Taiwan, the colonial government developed the island's infrastructure and left the incoming regime with an almost ideal situation as they were more or less given the keys to an already established island. The problem was that the Japanese also provided education to several generations of Taiwanese citizens who ended up not really being big fans of yet another colonial regime swooping in and taking over.\n\nIt goes without saying that Taiwan’s half-century of development under Japanese rule wasn’t entirely altruistic - the colonial power, like all colonial powers benefited greatly from the resources that they were able to extract from Taiwan and the development of the island was meant to help them extract those resources more efficiently.\n\nThe development undertaken by the colonial government over its fifty year rule didn’t just include construction of island-wide infrastructure, but also provided pubic and higher education as well as the opportunity to participate in Japan’s democratic governance.\n\nThis created a class of highly educated citizens, who cherished the ideals of democratic governance.\n\nThis was a stark contrast to the corrupt totalitarian approach to governance that the Chinese Nationalist Party implemented upon arrival in Taiwan resembling the early years of Japanese colonial rule and ultimately instituted a thirty-eight year period of martial law.\n\nThe longest of its kind in the history of the world.\n\nLink: Martial Law in Taiwan | White Terror (Wiki)\n\nAfter Japan’s surrender, the new regime quickly implemented similar “kominka” style policies, like the one mentioned above. These policies included harsh language laws, punishing anyone who spoke Japanese, Taiwanese, Hakka or any of Taiwan’s Indigenous languages. Enforcement of these laws was strict and even though several generations of Taiwanese had only ever known Japanese, they were forced to quietly adapt, else they might receive a knock on the door by the Taiwan Garrison Command (臺灣警備總司令部), better known as the secret police.\n\nAlthough the actual numbers of imprisonment and deaths that resulted from this long period of terror have never been confirmed, it is thought that more then 140,000 people were imprisoned and deaths range from anywhere between 5,000-30,000 people who were accused of being communist spies or their real or perceived opposition to Chinese Nationalist rule.\n\nHowever even though the Chinese Nationalists spared no effort in tearing down any sign of Japanese cultural influence throughout the country, they were also faced with the very real issue of a serious housing shortage caused by bringing more than two million refugees with them from China. So even though tearing down reminders of the previous regime was a priority, they also had to be practical, allowing those refugees to become squatters in anything that provided them with a roof over their heads.\n\nIn 1950 (民國39年), shortly after Taiwan’s so-called ‘restoration’, the Taoyuan Shinto Shrine, like many of the other Prefectural Level Shinto Shrines around the island was officially converted into a “Martyrs Shrine” (忠烈祠) - a War-Memorial dedicated to the remembrance of the fallen members of the Republic of China’s Armed Forces.\n\nAs I mentioned above, one of the saving graces for this shrine was that its original construction mimicked that of Tang Dynasty-style design, so even though it was for all intents and purposes a Japanese Shinto Shrine, it wasn’t all that different from a Chinese style temple.\n\nSo with some slight changes, the shrine was easily converted into the Hsinchu Martyrs Shrine (新竹縣忠烈祠), but was later renamed when the government restructured Taiwan’s administrative districts with Taoyuan finally getting the recognition it deserves, becoming a county.\n\nBy 1972 (民國61年), when the Japanese government broke off official relations with the Republic of China, the government here reacted strongly and instituted a policy of tearing down anything remaining from the Japanese Colonial Era as a retaliatory measure.\n\nLink: Japan-Taiwan Relations (Wiki)\n\nThe Shinto Shrines that remained were for the most part torn down and were replaced with Chinese style Martyrs Shrines.\n\nThe Hualien Shinto Shrine for example was one of the few former Shinto Shrines that retained much its original design well after the Chinese Nationalists took control of Taiwan and converted it into a Martyrs Shrine. When this policy took effect though, it was quickly torn down and replaced.\n\nLink: 去日本化 (Wiki)\n\nThe Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine though oddly remained unscathed.\n\nThere’s no clear reason as to why it was saved from these retaliatory acts of destruction.\n\nThat being said, the Taoyuan County Government drafted plans to tear down the deteriorating Martyrs Shrine in 1985, and had an appetite to completely replace it with a Chinese-style shrine like the nearby Confucius Temple, which was under construction at the time.\n\nThose plans met with staunch disapproval from the locals who protested the destruction of the shrine and fought to have it restored rather than torn down. The county government eventually capitulated to their demands and in 1987, after spending around $250,000 USD (NT8,860,000), the shrine was restored and reopened to the public.\n\nIn the years since, the shrine has been designated as a National Protected Historic Site (國家三級古蹟) and when Taoyuan County was amalgamated into a super city, the newly minted Department of Cultural Affairs (桃園市政府文化局) came up with a long-term plan to create a cultural park on the site.\n\nAfter another two-year period of restoration, the shrine reopened to the public as the Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine and Cultural Park (桃園忠烈祠暨神社文化園區) and has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in town.\n\nLink: Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine and Cultural Park - English | 中文 | 日文\n\nIn addition to honoring the war dead of the Republic of China’s Armed Forces, the shrine is also home to Spirit Tablets (牌位) dedicated to Koxinga (鄭成功), Liu Yongfu (劉永福) and Qiu Fengjia (丘逢甲), three historic figures who are considered important Chinese patriots in Taiwan.\n\nThe Pirate King Koxinga (鄭成功) was a Ming-loyalist who escaped to Taiwan with his fleet and established a kingdom in the south in an attempt to establish a base for which he could help to restore the Ming Emperor. His history is one that is well-told here in Taiwan and there are many places of worship throughout the country in his honour.\n\nLink: Tainan Koxinga Shrine\n\nLiu Yongfu was the commander of the celebrated Black Flag Army (黑旗軍), who later in life became the President of the short-lived Republic of Formosa (臺灣民主國).\n\nQiu Fengjia on the other hand was a Hakka poet, a renowned patriot, and the namesake for Taichung’s prestigious Fengjia University (逢甲大學).\n\nAs I just mentioned, since the most recent period of restoration, the former Shinto Shrine turned Martyrs Shrine has been converted into a “culture park” to showcase the important history of this shrine. Previously administered in conjunction with the nearby Taoyuan Confucius Shrine, today there is a lot more focus, funding and care given to the shrine.\n\nAs the most well-preserved of its size remaining in Taiwan today, it has unsurprisingly become a popular attraction with crowds of weekend travelers and the Taoyuan City Government has done an excellent job ensuring that there is a sufficient amount of literature available to guests who want to learn more about the shrine.\n\nBut even though the vast majority of the people who show up are coming for the Shinto Shrine, we still have to remember that it still serves as the official Martyrs Shrine for Taoyuan.\n\nSo remember to be respectful when you visit!\n\nOne of the most unfortunate aspects of Taiwan’s modern history is that even though it is (for the most part) well-recorded, it hasn’t been very well preserved. What I mean by this is that while history books have lots of information, they mostly just feature diagrams instead of photos as sadly, many of the historic places of interest around the country have long since vanished.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this lack of preservation is that ‘history’ is often dictated by those in power and when you’ve been colonized as many times as Taiwan has, it shouldn’t really be surprising that much of what once existed has already been torn down, most often to better suit the interests of those in charge.\n\nIts all too easy to make scapegoats of the Japanese and the Chinese Nationalists for the damage they caused, but even today, decades after the country has transformed into one of the most stable democracies in Asia, places of historic value continue to disappear, now though, its due to modern development.\n\nSuch is the case that it doesn’t particularly matter if something was constructed by the Spanish, the Dutch, the Qing, the Japanese or the Chinese Nationalists - its open season if its considered to be in the way.\n\nFortunately there are vocal civic groups all over the country that are determined to protect Taiwan’s cultural and historic assets by any means necessary - This doesn’t mean that they always win, but the work these groups are doing now is helping to preserve important pieces of Taiwan’s history for future generations.\n\nThe government has likewise started taking a more proactive approach to the preservation of (some of) Taiwan’s historic properties. In recent years a considerable amount of public funds have been allocated for the restoration and repair of many of these places of interest. Sadly though, these projects don’t seem to be funded equally with poorer areas having a hard time keeping up.\n\nIf you’ve been around for the past few years, you might have noticed that many former buildings constructed during the Japanese Colonial Era have been (or are in the process of being) restored and likewise several of Taiwan’s former Military Dependents Villages have been brought back to life with initiatives to convert them into tourist attractions.\n\nLinks: Mazu New Village (馬祖新村) | Rainbow Village (彩虹村)\n\nI may be somewhat partial, but as far as I’m concerned, there are few places in Taiwan where those efforts have been more obvious than here in Taoyuan. The local government has spent a considerable amount of money renovating and restoring buildings of historic and cultural value.\n\nTaoyuan, which has a reputation as an industrial area, was actually at one time better known for its high concentration of these ‘Military Villages’ and was home to a large portion of Taiwan’s new immigrant population when the Chinese Nationalists fled here after 1949. Only a handful of these villages currently remain though, so the fact that a ‘rich’ area of Taiwan has only committed to saving three of these villages goes to show how dire the situation can be with places of historic significance.\n\nThe three military villages that were lucky enough to be preserved in Taoyuan include Mazu New Village (馬祖新村) in Zhongli, Dawu New Village (大武新村) in Daxi, and Xianguang Second Village (憲光二村) in Guishan. Each of which is currently run under the ‘Military Village Iron Triangle’ project funded by the city government. So far though, only Mazu New Village has been completely restored and reopened the public while the other two are currently undergoing restoration with their official opening dates to be determined within the next few years.\n\nLink: The Taoyuan ‘Military Village Iron Triangle’ (桃園眷村鐵三角)\n\nThe topic of today’s blog post is Guishan’s Xianguang Second Village, which is located a short distance from the downtown core of Taoyuan District. The restoration project on the village started around the end of 2019, but in the few years prior to that, it was opened to the public on a trial basis a few days a week to allow people to check out what the village looked like and learn about its history.\n\nThat being said, in its current state there really isn’t much for most visitors in terms of things to see, learn or enjoy - So if you live outside out Taoyuan, I don’t think a visit to the village is worth a day trip.\n\nIf you’re here because you saw a cool-looking photo on Instagram, you might want to reconsider and wait until it officially opens within the next year or two.\n\nYou probably know that I’m a bit weird by now though, so I made sure to visit the village a couple of times before the restoration project started. The reason for this was not because I wanted some cool instagram photos, but because I wanted to document the condition of the village before construction workers started tearing it apart.\n\nThe photos I’m sharing today in this post are meant to show the village in its abandoned condition before it reopens, which means that you can expect an update to this post a few years from now when it reopens to the public looking new and shiny.\n\nBefore we talk about the village though, lets take a minute to talk about what Military Villages are:\n\nMilitary Villages (眷村)\n\nWhen the Chinese Nationalists retreated to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War (國共內戰) they brought with them over two million refugees, who were in quick need of places to stay.\n\nMost of the people who were able to make the journey from China could only do so because they were part of the social elite or members of the Republic of China Armed Forces.\n\nThe new arrivals learned quickly that the government clearly wasn’t prepared to house them, so plans were made to hastily construct shoddy villages which would serve the purpose of 'temporarily' housing them until they could triumphantly return to their homeland when the communists were defeated.\n\nOr so was the plan..\n\nThe villages which are known as Military Dependents' villages (眷村) were constructed all over Taiwan in the 1940s and 1950s for members of the military and their families.\n\nThe Nationalist dream was that they would only retreat to Taiwan and ‘regroup’ for a short time in order to retake China from the communists. Unfortunately that would never come to pass and these so-called 'temporary' villages became 'permanent' settlements for the less privileged of those refugees.\n\nThe villages though ended up becoming important centres for the preservation of traditional Chinese culture, art, literature and cuisine and many of Taiwan’s older generation grew up in them.\n\nDespite the refugees receiving preferential treatment from the government, the homes were sloppily put together and were property of the state, which meant that the tenants had no possibility of land ownership.\n\nOver the years the tenants did their best to improve their living situations but as Taiwan's economic miracle was taking place, villages started to become abandoned as people sought a better, more comfortable life elsewhere.\n\nLink: Military Dependents’ Villages (Wiki) | Military Villages (Spectral Codex)\n\nAs more and more of the homes were abandoned and left to the elements, the conditions at these villages became an contentious issue of public debate as it seemed that those who remained were living in government-owned slums. The government thus decided to improve the public-housing situation and tear down the majority of the villages, which would be replaced with modern high-rise apartments.\n\nIn recent years though, the people of Taiwan have taken interest in the preservation of the remaining villages and several civil groups have been set up to protect them. These groups have become somewhat of a thorn in the side of the government and (in some cases) the public pressure they have applied has forced the government to come up with alternative plans.\n\nUnfortunately, the future of many of Taiwan’s remaining Military Communities is still undecided - with almost 90% of them having already become a faded memory. Its important that the few that remain are preserved to ensure that these important pieces of Taiwan’s history are preserved for the enjoyment of future generations.\n\nXianguang Second Village (憲光二村)\n\nXianguang Second Village was constructed in 1968 (民國57年) and was the only Military Dependents Village in Taoyuan that was built solely for the housing of the Military Police (憲兵).\n\nNote: The first character in “憲兵” is “xiàn” (憲) which is where the name for this village comes from. Military Police - “憲兵” (xiàn bīng). Xianguang - “憲光” (xiàn guāng)\n\nWhen the initial construction was complete, the village was home to about fourteen narrow rows of homes that were interconnected with each other housing over 100 families.\n\nThe homes were constructed in the typical ‘military village’ style that was common throughout Taiwan, which meant that the space inside was limited and that families lived together in close quarters with little to no privacy.\n\nLater in 1973 (民國62年), a block of four story high rise apartments was added and provided space space for an additional 40 families. The fact that this village showcases both the basic single-floor cramped ‘Military Village’ style of architectural design with the addition of a more modern style, allows it to stand out from the others in terms of what you’ll see when you visit.\n\nAs was the case with pretty much every other military village constructed around the country, people eventually got tired of living in such small (and poorly constructed) residences that they eventually opted to instead make the most of the Taiwanese economic miracle and purchase their own homes elsewhere.\n\nIn 2006, after all of the residents of Xianguang Second Village had already vacated the village, the government designated it as a historic property and started coming up with plans to preserve the site for future use and its inclusion into Taoyuan’s Military Village culture network.\n\nIn the thirteen years since, not much has happened at the village, but as I mentioned above, the restoration project to bring the village back to life has only just started, so it looks like the future of this quaint little village is looking quite promising and will be an attractive destination in the near future!\n\nVisiting the Village and Future Plans\n\nXianguang Second Village opened to the public a few years ago, under the Taoyuan City Government’s “Military Village Culture” initiative but when it first opened, public visits were limited to only two days a week and most of the village was off-limits. In the few years since, they gradually increased the amount of days that people could visit as well as planning a number of activities in order to attract more visitors.\n\nI visited a few years ago when the village first opened to the public and unfortunately arrived only about an hour before they were about to close. I figured that would be enough time to check it out, but when the staff saw me wandering around they decided to approach me and ask if I needed help or a free tour.\n\nI ended up having a long conversation with the friendly ladies who work there but unfortunately that didn’t leave me with much time to take photos as they chatted me up until closing time.\n\nUnlike Mazu New Village (馬祖新村) in nearby Zhongli, this village has yet to receive much attention in terms of fixing it up to make it look nice or giving it much promotion. So when people visit, especially foreigners, the staff get really excited.\n\nAs part of the Taoyuan City Government’s ‘Military Village Iron Triangle’ (桃園眷村鐵三角) mentioned above, it seems like this particular village had to wait in line (for funding) behind the renovation projects on Mazu New Village and Dawu New Village before it got its turn.\n\nIn November 2019, the long-planned three-year renewal project finally started at the village, which will see many of the buildings within completely renovated and transformed into a museum. From what I’ve read, the museum will be dedicated to ‘immigration’ in addition to being used as a space for various events, exhibitions and learning about the history of Taiwan’s Military Villages.\n\nKnowing that the village would undergo this period of renewal, I thought it was best to make an effort to visit and get photos of what the village looked like before work started. Given that I have an interest in urban exploration and exploring places with historic value, it was nice to be able to freely explore the abandoned military village to see what the homes were like in their dilapidated and lived-in states.\n\nI also knew from experience with the Mazu Village in Zhongli that once renovations started, it would difficult to gain access to any of the older buildings.\n\nSuffice to say when it comes to the future plans, all that has been mentioned is that the military village is slated to will become the ‘Xianguang Second Village Immigration Museum’ (憲光二村移民博物館) around 2022 and will focus on the modern history of immigration in Taiwan, especially with respect to all of the military villages in Taoyuan and the diverse ethnic groups of refugees who came here when the Nationalists lost the Chinese Civil War.\n\nI may seem like a broken record by now, but I’m guessing that the situation will be similar to what happened at Mazu New Village with the majority of the village being beautifully renovated and opened to the public with coffee shops, art displays and weekend activities on-site.\n\nOnly one of the buildings ended up being reserved to become the Taoyuan Arts Cinema (桃園光影電影館), so if I’m right, the actual ‘Immigration Museum’ will probably just be a permanent exhibition in one of the buildings while all of the others will be opened for tourism or commercial activities.\n\nWhatever the future holds, I hope that once the renovation project is completed and the village is reopened that whatever they plan to do with the space is well thought out and that it will be put to good use.\n\nAs it is, sections of the village will remain open to the public as the renovation project is underway but it should be obvious that if you plan on visiting before the official re-opening, you’ll be going at a time when there will be quite a bit of construction work going on at the same time.\n\nGetting There\n\nAddress: Lane 138, Datong Road, Guishan District, Taoyuan City. (桃園市龜山區大同路138巷)\n\nXianguang Second Village is located just outside of Taoyuan and is a short distance from the train station - It is a bit of a distance though, so if you’re heading into town and you don’t have a car or scooter, you’ll probably want to take some form of public transportation to get there, instead of walking.\n\nTaking a bus is quite simple, from Taoyuan Train Station (桃園車站) walk to the Tonlin Department Store (統領百貨) where you’ll find a bunch of bus stops to the right of the main entrance. From there get on Bus #137, which (should) come every fifteen to twenty minutes. You’ll want to stay on the bus until you reach the Datong Bus Stop (大同路口) where you’ll get off and walk down the hill to the village.\n\nYou could also easily take a YouBike from the Taoyuan Train Station and park it at the village when you get there, or simply returning it at one of the Youbike stations nearby.\n\nThe village is open to the public every week from Wednesday to Saturday (closed on Sundays / Mondays and Tuesdays) from 9:00 - 12:00 and 1:00 - 5:30.\n\nI would caution you though that in my experience, the hours of operation are quite fickle and once they start the renovation project, it is likely going to much more difficult to visit the village.\n\nIf you plan to visit Taoyuan just to check out this village, I highly recommend that you call first to confirm whether or not the village is actually even open to save yourself from disappointment.\n\nPhone number: 03-319-7132\n\nLinks: 桃園眷村鐵三角｜憲光二村 (Chinese-language only)\n\nWhile you’re in the area, I also recommend taking some time to visit the Taoyuan Confucius Temple (桃園孔廟), Taoyuan Shinto Shrine (桃園神社) and exploring the Tiger Head Mountain (虎頭山) area which are all a short distance away from the village\n\nThe popularity in recent years for the renewal of historic properties like Huashan (華山), Songshan Tobacco Factory (松菸) and Mazu New Village (馬祖新村) as new cultural villages for art and design has most certainly been a welcome turn of events.\n\nThe problem though is that when the rebranding of these villages isn’t well thought out, it makes for a situation where the staff struggle to attract visitors. Over the past couple of years I’ve visited this village on a few different occasions and got the feeling each time that the staff are dedicated to the promotion of the village and its future and (even though they were a bit chatty), they’re always excited to have guests.\n\nKeeping in mind that the village is currently undergoing a renovation process similar to what happened at Mazu Village in Zhongli, I expect that some of these issues will be resolved when the village officially reopens in the next few years.\n\nWhen it does reopen, I hope that I’ll be able to visit again to get photos of the renovated buildings and how they’ve gone about making it more attractive for visitors."
