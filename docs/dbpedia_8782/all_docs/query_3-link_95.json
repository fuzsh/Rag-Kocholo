        "text": "I live about 100m from Yo Der, and a girl who works there has the parking spot next to mine in our apartment block. I lost three of my students to them this semester and by all accounts the kids are really enjoying it at Yo Der. I haven’t actually been inside yet as my daughter is only 3, but we are also considering it for when she is old enough. The facilites look great, it’s only about a year old.\n\nOne possible negative is that the girl I mentioned keeps trying to recruit me every time our paths cross. I get the feeling they are having real trouble keeping foreign teachers as they are only allowed by law to hire foreigners with teaching certificates, or people on JFRV visas. The salary she told me is about 25% less than I’m earning at my current school and as I told her, I don’t think they are ever going to get a great foreign teacher to stay there when they could be earning a lot more for less work elsewhere in Jhongli.\n\nI can’t vouch for this, it’s just what I’ve heard, Shin Shing pay teachers a lot more and the fees are a lot more than Yo Der, which makes me think it’s probably a better school.\n\nAlso I believe TAS is a real international school offering international baccalaureate (sp?) whereas Shin Shing and Yo Der set their own curriculum (i.e. it counts for nothing when applying for places in institutions in other countries). That’s also just what I’ve heard though, in no way a fact.\n\nYour best bet would be to go and check them all out when you have time. That’s what my wife and I are planning to do.\n\nA school is defined by the teacher turnover rate.\n\nTuition for Shin shing, depending on variables is about 200ish per year- 20-25K month. Not bad considering. Four years old\n\nTaoyuan American School is 500K per year. Brand New\n\nRenoir is about 300-400K per year. ABOUT 5 years old. Out by the racetrack in Longtan-acer aspire park.\n\nYo Der I don’t know but if they are skimping on salaries then I think the tuition must be lower.\n\nAll offer extra curricular activities and have a good selection-music/art/pe/swimming/scouting,etc…\n\nThe way I look at it is going to a public school here is similar to that of a public school back home. It’s a public school, there are only so many resources available. Schools are in shoddy conditions, subject material isn’t that in depth, students depth of learning is only relegated to a few subjects that don’t have much relevance in the overall scheme of things. Besides that, if you take extra curricular activities, an chin ban, sports, etc…per month you are paying at least 15 K for tuition, supplies, transportation, etc. To me extra curricular activities are key for children, not sitting in a classroom memorizing endless amounts of info-don’t go there-that’s a whole other topic.\n\nThe good thing about these private schools is the variety of subjects offered-not just math and chinese. Kids are sponges-let them wander and do things!I always thought private schools were great growing up-just our family didn’t have the $$ for it-I want to give my son that chance I never had-but then again-don’t most parents want what’s best for their kids.\n\n[quote=“baberenglish”]A school is defined by the teacher turnover rate.\n\nTuition for Shin shing, depending on variables is about 200ish per year- 20-25K month.

We have only looked at Shin shing so far. Price isn’t bad. Curriculum is ok. Have to check out the others over the next little while. Taoyuan American School is too pricey for me(500K per year). That is the only one in the Taoyuan area that requires a foreign passport, (my son has dual passports)…so I will go over the next while and check them all out. Better to see for yourself rather than rely on others, but talk to the foreigners if you can so you can get the real jist."
