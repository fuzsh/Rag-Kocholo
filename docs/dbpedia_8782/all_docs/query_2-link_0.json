        "text": "This article is about the county in Hunan. For the city in Taiwan formerly known as Taoyuan County, see Taoyuan, Taiwan.\n\nCounty in Hunan, China\n\nTaoyuan County (simplified Chinese: 桃源县; traditional Chinese: 桃源縣; pinyin: Táoyuán Xiàn) is under the administration of Changde, Hunan Province, China. The Yuan River, a tributary of the Yangtze, flows through Taoyuan. It covers an area of 4441 square kilometers, of which 895 km2 (346 sq mi) is arable land. It is 229 km (142 mi) from Zhangjiang Town, the county seat, to Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province. The county occupies the southwestern corner of Changde City and borders the prefecture-level cities of Zhangjiajie to the northwest and Huaihua to the southwest.\n\nThe area of present-day Taoyuan County belonged to the Chu state during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, and was a portion of Linyuan County during the Western Han dynasty. In AD 50, the 26th year of Jianwu, the Eastern Han dynasty was merged with Yuannan County, and administered by the Wuling Prefecture, separating it from Linyuan County. In AD 783, the third year of Sui dynasty, Wuling County was created by annexing the three counties Linyuan, Yuannan, and Hanshou, administered by the Langzhou Prefecture.\n\nIn AD 963, the third year of the Song dynasty, Taoyuan County was officially established by separating a part of Wuling County. It was named after its famous Taohuayuan (桃花源), named after the fable \"Peach Blossom Spring\".\n\nIts capital, Zhanjiang (now Zhanjiang Subdistrict), is situated on the northern bank of Yuan River (Yuanjiang).\n\nAgricultural products include rice, wheat, edible oils, sesame seeds, peanuts, cotton, and tobacco. Manufactured products include machinery, textiles, chemicals, wood products, and leather goods. Local mines extract gold, silver, iron ore, and diamonds.\n\nTaoyuan has 123,000 students enrolled in its elementary schools, middle schools and high schools. 99.99% of children of compulsory education age are enrolled in schools, and 93.2% of children with disabilities are enrolled in schools.\n\nApproximately 2000 high school graduates are admitted to colleges and universities each year.\n\nThe First Middle School of Taoyuan (桃源一中), which includes both a middle school and high school, is the most prestigious school in Taoyuan County.\n\nAccording to the result on adjustment of township-level administrative divisions of Taoyuan county on November 20, 2015, Taoyuan County had 18 towns and 10 townships under its jurisdiction in 2015.[2] Five townships were reorganized as towns on December 28, 2016;[3] Mutangyuan Township was reorganized as a town,[4] Zhangjiang Town ceased to be a separate town, it was incorporated into two subdistricts in December 2017. The county has two subdistricts, 23 towns and four townships under its jurisdiction.[5]\n\nTaoyuan County is in the northwestern portion, ,[6] of Hunan Province. It is 118 km (73 mi) from its northernmost point, LaoPeng village, Reshi Town, to its southernmost point, Shizi Ling, Xuejiachong village, Xi'an Town and 75 km (47 mi) from its easternmost post, Caoxiezhou, Renfeng village, Mutangyuan Township, to its westernmost post, Wanjiahe, Gaofeng village, Niuchehe Township. Its total area is 4,441.22 km2 (1,714.76 sq mi), which is the fourth largest in Hunan Province. 895 km2 (346 sq mi) is arable land, the largest area of arable land in Hunan Province.\n\nThe agricultural landscape consists of: 13.4% alluvial plains of the Yuanjiang River, 49.3% hillocks, and 36.0% hills and mountains.\n\nTaoyuan County is a transition zone from subtropical to north subtropical having a humid subtropical climate with seasonal prevailing winds. All four seasons are distinct.\n\nThe average annual temperature is 17.0 Celsius. The average temperature is 4.8 degrees Celsius in January and 28.4 degrees Celsius in July.\n\nThe average annual precipitation is 146 centimeters (58 inches), gradually decreasing from south to north. The annual average relative humidity is 81%; the annual sunshine length is 1531 hours and frost-free period lasts 284 days.\n\nTaoyuan County has a population of 976,000 composed of a dominant Han ethnic group and twelve other minority ethnic groups of: Hui, Uyghur, Tujia, Man, Dong, Zhuang and Yao. The Uyghur and Hui number more than 3000 people.\n\nAround 5,000 Uyghurs live around Taoyuan County and other parts of Changde.[9][10][11][12] They are descended from a Uyghur leader Hala Bashi, from the Buddhist Uyghurs of Turpan (Kingdom of Qocho), who the Ming dynasty Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang sent to Hunan in the 14th century.[13][14][15] Along with him came Uyghur soldiers from which the Hunan Uyghurs descend. During the 1982 census 4,000 Uyghurs were recorded in Hunan.[16] They have genealogies from the period beginning 600 years ago to the present day. Keeping genealogical records is a Han Chinese custom which the Hunan Uyghurs adopted. These Uyghurs were given the surname Jian by the Emperor; they received a Chinese education.[17] A prominent Hunan Uyghur was Jian Bozan (1898–1968) who was a member of the Chinese Communist Party.[18]\n\nThe Uyghur troops led by Hala were ordered by the Ming Emperor to crush Miao rebellions and were given titles by him. Jian (Chinese: 翦; pinyin: Jiǎn) is the predominant surname among the Uyghur in Changde, and Hunan. Hala Bashi was given the title \"Grand General of South-Pacifying Post of the Nation\" by the Emperor (镇国定南大将军; 鎮國定南大將軍; Zhènguó Dìngnán Dàjiàngjūn)[19][20] Another group of Uyghur have the surname Sai. Hui Muslims from the Hui Huang family of Xujiaqiao and Uyghur Jian family have intermarried in the Hunan area, and the Hui like the Hui Huang family of Xujiaqiao in Taoyuan were also used by the Ming Emperor to crush \"barbarian\" (Miao) revolts and the originally non-Muslim Uyghurs adopted Islam when intermarrying with Hui.[21]\n\nIt is reported that they now number around 10,000 people.[22]\n\nThere is some confusion as to whether Uyghurs in Changde practice Islam or not. Some scholars state that they do not practice Islam. Their genealogies indicate their Uyghur ancestry.[23] Chinese news sources report that they are Muslim.[13] Another report says they are not very religious, and eat pork.[22] Older Uygurs disapprove of this, especially elders at the mosques in Changde, and they seek to draw them back to Islamic customs.[24]\n\nIn addition to eating pork, the Uygurs of Changde Hunan practice other Han Chinese customs, like ancestor worship at graves. Some Uyghurs from Xinjiang visit the Hunan Uyghurs out of curiosity or interest.[25] Also, the Uyghurs of Hunan do not speak the Uyghur language, instead, they speak Chinese as their native language, and Arabic for religious reasons at the mosque.[21]\n\nThe Taoyuan dialect was profoundly influenced by the northern dialect since the path used by government messengers, speaking the northern dialect, travelling to Yunnan and Guizhou from the Song to the Qing dynasty, passed through Taoyuan. It was also influenced by the dialects of central Jiangxi since substantial numbers of people from Jishui, Zhangshu, and Fengcheng of Jiangxi relocated to Taoyuan in succession from the Ming dynasty to the early Qing dynasty.\n\nThere are two types of accents in the Taoyuan dialect, one of which is called the native accent spoken in the central area of Taoyuan, including Zhangjiang Town, Zoushi Town, Qihe Town, Sanyanggang Town, and part of Jianshi Town; the other is called the periphery accent, spoken in the strip area bordering the other counties.\n\nTaoyuan dialect is a fusion of the northern and Jiangxi dialects. Its accent is close to those of the Sichuan, Chongqing, and Hubei dialects. It is categorized as Southwestern Mandarin.\n\nTaoyuan has its unique folk custom characteristics since it is located in a zone neighbouring surviving distinct ethnic groups.\n\nIn cooking, Lei cha (pounded tea), is a \"five flavors soup\" made by smashing a mixture of tea leaves, ginger, corn, meng beans and salt into a powder; it is popular drink in Taohuanyuan area. According to legend, Lei cha protected soldiers from pestilence caused by their inability to acclimatize to the environment in Taoyuan during the Eastern Han period when General Ma Yuan fought southward to Taoyuan.\n\nTaoyuan has unique local operas. Wuling Opera is a popular local opera performed by professionals. Musty Notes received the National Artist Award for its performance and script writing. Nuo opera drama, called a \"living fossil\", is still widespread. The town of Sangyanggang is known as the home of Nuo Opera.\n\nThe Three Bar Drum, Yugu Drum, and string instruments are very popular as well.\n\nSong Jiaoren (Apr 5, 1882 - Mar 22, 1913), a Chinese republican revolutionary, political leader and a founder of the Kuomintang.\n\nLiu Kan (1906 – Mar 03, 1948), posthumously awarded rank of General of the Republic of China Army in 1953, was born in Zhengaotian village, Taohuanyuan Town.\n\nWang Qimei (王其梅; Wáng Qíméi, Dec 27, 1914—Aug 15, 1967), awarded rank of Major General of PLA in 1955, was born in Wangjiaping village, Sanyanggang Town.\n\nJian Bozan (1898-Dec 18, 1968), a prominent Marxist historian, Vice President of Beijing University from 1952 to 1968, was born in Huiwei village, Fengshu Uyghur Autonomous Township.\n\nYou Rizheng (1949 – May 25, 2002), second legislator of Taoyuan County, former mayor of Longtan District, and member of the second Legislative Yuan from 1993 to 1996.\n\nThe Taohuayuan Scenic Area is a park modelled after the Peach Blossom Spring fable, (桃花源), about a land secluded from the outside mortal world depicted as an idyllic shangri-la by Tao Yuanming, (365–427), an Eastern Jin dynasty poet."
