        "text": "I attended LSU online for one class in 2019. I took an accounting course and was planning to take other coursework to enable me to sit for the CPA exam in Ohio. I liked the online option since I work full time and have a family. LSUs online course framework is horribly formatted. You utilize one website for your syllabus and class information, another for reading, another for assignments, and then another one for exams. Yeah, how annoying and confusing is that? Then, you have to pay again to sit... Read More for exams online which are fully proctored- I would assume due to cheating issues in the past. The problem with this is I took one exam and the proctor talked to me a few times through the exam telling me they couldnâ€™t see me or needed me to do this or that - which then affects me time and concentration during the exam. It was entirely rude and hindered me from taking the exam. I knew after that and just the online class integration this university was not for me. I later went to another online school in 2020 and am still attending (now on my 4th class). I would tell anyone to stay away from LSU online. Go elsewhere.\n\nRead Less\n\nI will first start by saying if you're like me and you chose LSU, it is because you most likely grew up seeing the stadium lights, taking drives through campus and being a huge Tigers fan. Campus life is great if you love all of those things, but academic life can be difficult if you do not apply yourself. I studied Kinesiology which was not easy, but it was worth it because Kinesiology is the only degree program that offers anatomy and if you do well you can take a Cadaver lab, which I did. IT WAS... Read More AWESOME! I advise you to study because this degree is not easy nor or the professors. Many of them are grad students who are as nervous as you are so it is important to make sure you study the material because you may not always receive the best lecture. Most tests are conducted in the testing center which can be nerve wrecking because there is someone always hovering over you (there were a lot of incidences of cheating). If you go to a professor for help make sure you know at least a little something about the material. They will start throwing questions at you immediately. They are there to help you understand better not reteach you the material. Overall, choose your professors wisely. Don't take a class that is to early so you skip, because if you don't go to class you will not pass.\n\nRead Less\n\nLouisiana State University is a well-rounded school in academics and in sports. As a Biological Sciences major, I was a part of the College of Science (COS). COS offers many degree programs for undergraduate students such as Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Microbiology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics. If you are interested in research, there are numerous research opportunities at LSU through many different departments. I was able to work with residential life at LSU as my first job... Read More when coming to campus as a desk assistant. I later moved into a resident assistant role where I actually lived in a dorm on a particular floor, where I was responsible for a certain number of residents. I know other people who got involved with research right away, and some who got involved with sports right away. There is no one path to take at this school, and it is really up to you and what you are looking to accomplish.\n\nIf you are a student that is interested in some type of professional school after college, Biological Sciences and Biochemistry curriculum does a great job at preparing students for their perspective entrance exams. There is a general path you could follow if you are unsure about what courses to take, and it gives suggestions for electives to take, but you have full autonomy to choose whatever elective courses you would like (as long as you get your major courses completed and other required courses).\n\nRead Less\n\nLouisiana State University is a great school for an undergraduate degree. It is important for you to become your own advocate at LSU so that you do not get lost in the system. Take advantage of the opportunities LSU provides you: the Career Center, the Recreation Center, the Tutoring Center in Middleton, the SI Sessions, and much more. No two student will have the same experience at LSU but if you are your own advocate, it will be an incredible educational opportunity.\n\nThe COMD Department at LSU... Read More is phenomenal! The teachers are encouraging and supportive, helping each student reach their desired outcome. Any instructor will happily visit with you during office hours and help answer any questions you might have. The department has many opportunities to get involved in research and community service. They prepare students well for graduate school through their rigorous curriculum.\n\nRead Less\n\nThe biological engineering degree program at LSU is a very well rounded curriculum that allowed for a little taste of every discipline of engineering. From thermodynamics and fluids to biomechanics and biological systems, there was a variety that truly made the experience that much better. The department I belonged to was a small, tight knit group that exuded support and motivation. The professors were always around to answer questions or give advice on classes, life, and especially senior design... Read More projects. They also shared personal information and became friends with you. There was a connection between professors and students that didnt seem to exist in other departments according to other engineering students that belonged to larger departments. The difference between our department and other departments is the family feel, in my opinion. In my department, everyone hung out together in the lounge and there was lots of mingling of the different years of students. This promoted growth, success, networking and great social benefits. Having connections for class material or old books or someone who could tutor was that much easier to find when everyone feels part of the team. In our department, I always felt like an engineer in training when working next to my professor. The teaching style they had tremendously helped in my success in school. This department provided me with a foundation unlike any other. And this foundation is perfect for my future degree in the field of orthotics and prosthetics. I highly recommend biological engineering for anyone interested in the body and the fundamentals of engineering. The perspective gained with this knowledge is unlike any other at LSU.\n\nRead Less\n\nMy undergraduate degree at LSU is an indescribable learning experience that is vital to current success and self worth. I met countless new friends, obtained opportunities and really took life by the reigns for the first time, which opened up my eyes to how the world works. Without this experience and additional education after High School, I would not be the person I am today. The EJ Ourso College of Business was remarkable, along with various other degree programs and colleges at the university.... Read More Athletics, student life and location were also some of the best imaginable to a prospective and even graduated college student.\n\nRead Less\n\nLSU was a great experience for me. Academically, I was challenged to push myself in every discipline. From english, to economics, to information systems, to biology, to communication, to music, I learned and grew as a student. Socially, LSU is one of the most fun environments I've ever experienced. It is large enough that there is a group of people that everyone can connect to. Athletics are among the best in the nation and student involvement is to the extreme. Student government, student-led organizations,... Read More religious organizations, and many other social groups are thriving and full of students. Baton Rouge is a great city. Not too big and not too small for me, I found plenty of shopping, restaurants, entertainment, and work opportunities while at LSU. The people at LSU are the highlight. Louisiana culture is marked by hard working people who love life and find a way to make everything fun. LSU is also affordable and in line with other flagship universities. And last but not least, from Lafayette to New Orleans you will find the best food in the world.\n\nRead Less\n\nIf you go in without a plan then by the time you realize you don't want to do what you've been working towards it'll be too late. I started with a major in biology and finished with a bachelors in biology. I added the marine concentration when I realized my only career path with a purely Biology degree was into medicine which my grades weren't up to par for and I wasn't really interested in anyway. There was almost no outreach for post graduate planning as far as I can tell. When I was invited to... Read More a career fair (apparently they have this every year I just didn't know when and where it was until I got an email my jr year) I realized my degree was horrid but it was too late. If I were to start over I would wind up in debt and without a degree for a couple more years. Overall, I just feel that there wasn't enough guidance when it came to formulating a solid career path. It's my own ignorance that led to this waste of time, money and effort but as a first generation college graduate, I hardly feel responsible for mistakenly thinking a degree in a science field would be barely usable.\n\nRead Less\n\nLouisiana State University is a great institution. I absolutely love the program because each class allows me to apply my subject area to whatever we are learning about. There are also a lot of faculty/ staff who are supportive in helping start research and get it published. I had a lot of anxiety about navigating my way through academia and the support I receive is empowering me to accomplish more than I anticipated. There are also a lot of programs and office for students to get involved in, which... Read More have allowed to be completely refresh my resume.\n\nRead Less"
