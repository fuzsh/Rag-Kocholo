        "text": "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Louisiana Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\n\n1. Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institutionâ€™s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists.\n\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists.\n\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\n\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnne Marie Tamburro\n\nDear Ms. Tamburro -\n\nYour Public Records Request was received and forwarded to the appropriate department(s) for the collection of the requested documents.

However, large requests will take longer to collect and process because all requests must be reviewed for exceptions to the Public Records Law by LSU before they can be inspected, copied, and/or reproduced. Notice will be provided to you in all instances where the public nature of the records is in question.\n\nPlease take a brief moment to acknowledge receipt of this response via email.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[LSU]<http://www.lsu.edu/>\n\nJohanna A.
