Some other states have an easy way to find out what individual faculty members make in their public universities (broken down by name), and some universities even have it on their websites.\n\nIs there a central repository for Louisiana Public University faculty salaries that lists individual salaries by name?\n\nI'd like to find out salaries of LSU, Louisiana Tech, and University of Louisiana Lafayette faculty members. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nPosted by tgrbaitn08\n\nMember since Dec 2007\n\n146214 posts\n\nto dandyjohn\n\nquote:\n\nYes and you'll be shocked at how much football coaches get paid!\n\nThat link shows that Coach O got paid $500k in 2019\n\nPosted by UndercoverBryologist\n\nMember since Nov 2020\n\n8077 posts\n\nto tgrbaitn08\n\nquote:\n\nThat link shows that Coach O got paid $500k in 2019\n\nNo wonder he's not putting in the full effort.\n\n(Edit: Are we sure that there's not some sort of accounting frickery going on? Like $500,000 comes from LSU, a state entity. But the other $6,000,000 comes from the Athletic Department, which might be incorporated as a private entity? Just wondering.)\n\nThis post was edited on 10/6/21 at 9:43 am\n\nPosted by Shexter\n\nPrairieville\n\nMember since Feb 2014\n\n14716 posts\n\nto tgrbaitn08\n\nquote:\n\nThat link shows that Coach O got paid $500k in 2019\n\nHe did get a raise in 2020, but something is wrong with that list...\n\nquote:\n\nOrgeron signed a six-year, $42 million extension after LSU went 15-0 in 2019 and won the national championship. He was scheduled to make nearly $9 million in 2020 and his contract calls for a base salary of $6 million. A 5 percent cut means that Orgeron will make $300,000 less than he was scheduled to in 2021.\n\nPosted by UndercoverBryologist\n\nMember since Nov 2020\n\n8077 posts\n\nto Shexter\n\nThey got the number right for Saban at Alabama.\n\nquote:\n\nNick Saban L in 2020 was employed in University of Alabama and had a reported pay of $9,127,934 according to public records. This pay is 15,647 percent higher than average and 21,099 percent higher than median salary in University of Alabama.\n\nPosted by Epic Cajun\n\nLafayette, LA\n\nMember since Feb 2013\n\n33638 posts\n\nto UndercoverBryologist\n\nquote:\n\nAre we sure that there's not some sort of accounting frickery going on?

The rest of his money is paid in bonuses, endorsements, etc, by the TAF and their partners.\n\nPosted by c00per\n\nMember since Aug 2012\n\n115 posts\n\nto AFtigerFan\n\nDoes anyone know how to find the one for Louisiana Tech in Ruston?

Other universities/states have every faculty member’s salary listed. Many even show it per month (faculty are on 9-month contracts and you’ll see their monthly pay. I just haven’t found that for the Louisiana system. I’d probably have to put in a public records request to get the info."
