While I don't have personal experiences to share, I can give you a general overview based on what I know about the program.\r\n\r\nCourses: LSU's economics program offers a Bachelor of Science (BS) and Bachelor of Arts (BA) in economics. The BS has a stronger emphasis on math and quantitative analysis, whereas the BA focuses more on social science perspectives and critical thinking skills. Both tracks require core courses like microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics, but you'll have the opportunity to choose from various electives based on your interests, such as labor economics, international trade, and public finance, among others.\r\n\r\nFaculty: The faculty at LSU consists of highly qualified professors, many of whom hold a Ph.D. in economics or related fields, and have research expertise across a broad range of areas, including environmental economics, industrial organization, and economic development. Make sure to check RateMyProfessors or talk to current students to get a better idea of individual professors' teaching styles and how they might be a good fit for you.\r\n\r\nJob prospects: Graduates with an economics degree from LSU have pursued various career paths, including positions as financial analysts, economic consultants, data analysts, or continuing to further education in graduate school. The diverse skill set obtained throughout your studies, such as critical thinking, data analysis, and problem-solving, makes you an attractive candidate for various industries and employers. To maximize your job prospects, consider engaging in internships, research experiences, or networking opportunities while still in college.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can make use of LSU's career services to help with crafting your resume, searching for job opportunities, or preparing for interviews. Attending on-campus career fairs and networking events can also connect you with potential employers in your field.\r\n\r\nOverall, whether studying economics at LSU is worth it depends on your personal and career goals, as well as your aptitude for the subject. The economics program at LSU offers a strong foundation, but it's always a good idea to explore as many schools and programs as possible to find the best fit. Good luck with your decision-making process!",
