        "text": "This report was published in the 2011 issue of the Bulletin of the AAUP.\n\nThis report finds violations of academic freedom in two cases at Louisiana’s flagship public institution, Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The cases were investigated, and the report written, by a committee of AAUP members chaired by professor of philosophy Debra Nails of Michigan State University. The first case, affecting a nontenured associate professor of engineering, involves freedom in pursuing research, publication, and extramural speech in a politically charged atmosphere. The second case, affecting a tenured professor of biology, involves freedom of a classroom teacher to conduct a course and assign grades.\n\nThe subject of the first case is Ivor van Heerden, a researcher serving since 1992 in a non-tenure-track appointment. For years, his work in coastal erosion and in hurricane- and flood-related issues brought him public prominence and consistently favorable evaluations. The August 2005 onslaught of Hurricane Katrina with its flooding of New Orleans placed van Heerden in a national spotlight that the LSU authorities were initially happy to share. They gave him LSU apparel to wear in media interviews and in September 2005 an LSU campus police officer escorted him and two colleagues through military roadblocks to inspect the flooded areas.\n\nHowever, the attitude of administrators quickly changed after van Heerden found that a main cause of flooding and resulting loss of lives was structural failure of the levees overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Administrators, anticipating cooperation and support from the Corps in hurricane recovery projects, did not appreciate being linked in the newspapers with these findings. They took steps to restrain van Heerden’s public activities, to distance LSU from those activities, and, eventually, to deny him further appointment.\n\nThe Association’s investigating committee concluded that the administration denied van Heerden due process to which he was entitled through length of service, and also violated his academic freedom in a number of ways: by denying him reappointment largely in retaliation for his dissent from the prevailing LSU stance on the levees, by restricting the nature of the research to be done by van Heerden, and by punishing him for exercising his extramural rights as a citizen.\n\nThe subject of the second case is Dominique G. Homberger, a biologist. As a tenured full professor teaching upper-level courses, she was repeatedly commended for teaching excellence, praised particularly for her “rigorous approach” and “demanding coursework.” In spring 2010, in order to “pitch in,” Homberger took on a section of an introductory course for the first time in fifteen years. The grades she assigned for the first test struck the course’s coordinator as too low, and he suggested more leniency. Her mid-term grades, however, were more strongly skewed to grades of D and F. The matter was referred to the college dean, who, without consulting her, relieved Homberger from teaching the course. The coordinator then raised each student’s grade on the first examination before allowing Homberger to enter her grades for a second. When Homberger asked the dean to hear her side of the story and reconsider, he replied that he was receptive to discussion, but that his decision stood.\n\nHomberger filed a complaint with LSU’s Faculty Grievance Committee, which found unanimously in her favor. In response, administrators assured the grievance committee that the senate was “developing an improved policy” on issues relating to student grading. The college dean apologized to Homberger for not having met with her in person to tell her she was being removed from the course—but he did not apologize, as the grievance committee had recommended, for not having consulted her before acting.\n\nThe investigating committee, citing a series of departures from AAUP- recommended standards, concluded that the LSU administration violated Homberger’s right to assign student grades and, in peremptorily removing her from a course that was in process, violated her academic freedom to teach. The committee concluded further that the administration’s imposing the severe sanction of suspension on her, without opportunity for a faculty hearing, denied her the basic protections of academic due process.\n\nDownload the report.\n\nAcademic Freedom and Tenure: Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge1\n\nThis is a report on two distinctly different cases at Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, different in the administrative officers involved and in the matters under dispute but alike in putting core issues of academic freedom to the test. The first case, affecting a nontenured associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in his seventeenth year on the faculty, tested the relationship between freedom of research and publication and freedom of extramural utterance in a politically charged atmosphere. The second case, affecting a tenured full professor in the Department of Biological Sciences in her thirty-first year on the faculty, tested the freedom of a classroom teacher to assign student grades as she sees fit.\n\nLouisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, the state’s flagship university, was founded in 1853 as the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy. It is the dominant unit of the Louisiana State University System, now composed of five institutions, each headed by a chancellor, under the authority of a system president and a board of supervisors. Dr. Michael V. Martin assumed the chancellorship of LSU, Baton Rouge, on August 1, 2008, having previously served as president of New Mexico State University. The system, together with three other Louisiana systems of education, falls in turn under the jurisdiction of a governor-appointed commissioner of higher education and a sixteen-member board of regents.\n\nAs of 2009, LSU, Baton Rouge, enrolled 21,000 undergraduate and 4,000 graduate students in seventeen schools and colleges, with approximately 1,250 fulltime faculty members. Its administration had embarked in 2003 on a seven-year National Flagship Agenda, “focused on how [LSU] could improve its research and educational enterprise to make it more nationally competitive.” Achievement of its goals, necessitating “an increase in resources from a variety of sources— federal, state, and private,” has been hampered by budgetary difficulties facing the state of Louisiana in general and its systems of higher education in particular, though these difficulties have been felt to very different degrees in LSU’s various colleges.2\n\nThe Case of Professor Ivor van Heerden\n\nI. Factual Background (before Hurricane Katrina)\n\nDr. Ivor van Heerden, a coastal geologist and hurricane researcher, received his BSc degree from the University of Natal in his native South Africa and his MS and PhD in marine sciences from Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. His full-time faculty service at LSU began in August 1992, when he received a grant-funded “soft money” appointment in the College of Basic Science as an assistant professor–research. That initial appointment, designated a “summer” research project involving flood management in the Atchafalaya Basin, was on a fiscal-year basis. In July, however, before the appointment began, the director of the Center for Coastal, Energy, and Environmental Resources (CCEER), Professor Charles G. Grout, wrote to assure Professor van Heerden that the position would later be advertised at the associate level as “permanent” and include the academic responsibilities necessary for the nine-month appointment. In the event, the position came through at the associate level with academic responsibilities, but it was permanent only in the sense that no end date was specified. Professor van Heerden began in August 1992 as associate professor–research and retained that rank throughout his LSU career.\n\nApplicable LSU policies exclude “research faculty” from accruing credit toward tenure, and Professor van Heerden’s first five years were to be partially grantfunded, yet his appointment from the outset carried academic responsibilities beyond research. Faculty members who later discussed his situation with the undersigned investigating committee emphasized the irregular nature of his appointment, questioning—as the Faculty Grievance Committee was later to question—just how the provisions of various policy documents could and should apply in his highly atypical case.\n\nAn important aspect of Professor van Heerden’s work throughout his affiliation with LSU was close interaction with and technical assistance to local, state, and federal agencies. In 1994, while continuing full time at LSU, he was appointed assistant secretary of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources to manage the state’s coastal and habitat restoration program, based on a comprehensive environmental management plan he had developed and described in a 1993 report. Under the state’s plan, which provided for multifaceted large-scale restoration, Professor van Heerden was responsible for ensuring the transfer of technology and ideas from academia to local government and to state and federal agencies involved in restoration. From 1992 to 1998, he was director of the Natural Systems Management and Engineering Program at LSU’s CCEER while maintaining his research professorship, dividing his time among a number of projects in his areas of expertise, notably in flood management. In 1995, he authored “A White Paper—The State of Louisiana’s Policy for Coastal Restoration Activities,” which set the official state policy for coastal restoration in Louisiana. In 1997, because he had exceeded the statutory limit of four years for a term appointment at the level of associate professor, his position was reclassified as a “hard-money” appointment under the state’s general fund, although he had already established and would maintain an impressive record of securing grant and contract income. Professor van Heerden continued to be paid by the state’s general fund through the end of his appointment in 2010, a fact that rendered his position an exception to official policies on research-series appointments.\n\nIn February 1998, Professor van Heerden began an appointment with the Louisiana Geological Survey (LGS), heading the River Basins and Wetlands Management Section. Dr. Lynn Jelinski, then vice chancellor for research, sent a team of LSU scientists, including Professors van Heerden and Marc Levitan, to Honduras to conduct assessments after Hurricane Mitch had left more than ten thousand people dead. Their collaboration led to the founding of the LSU Hurricane Center, which figures prominently in this report, under the administrative authority of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Professor Levitan, an associate professor of civil engineering with a specialty in wind engineering, was appointed the center’s director and, from July 2000, Professor van Heerden was its deputy director, with responsibility for developing a “funded research program related to storm impacts on the natural environment” and for carrying out associated administrative and academic duties.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000–01 academic year, Professor van Heerden transferred to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) within the College of Engineering, initially with a ten-month fiscal-year appointment. He sought the transfer, he said, to be able to work more closely with graduate students and to have teaching opportunities unavailable in LGS. In a September 28, 2000, memorandum, the interim vice chancellor and dean of the graduate school stated that the change was intended “to better reflect the services you have been providing to the university and to better take advantage of the expertise you have to offer.” The memorandum also noted that the “position and the funds transferred to CEE will revert to the Office of Research and Graduate Studies at such time as the position is vacated”—a provision that would later be of crucial importance.\n\nThe appointment to the CEE department, which was endorsed by the department’s faculty, required the development of a revised position description, which Professor van Heerden’s new department chair prepared in consultation with the Office of Human Resource Management (HRM). It listed his various duties and responsibilities, assigning the percentage of time to be devoted to each: “program development and supervision” was to occupy 35 percent of his time; “basic and applied research” was to take 30 percent; participation, as needed, in other LSU programs was to take 20 percent; and “technical assistance to state and federal agencies” was to take 15 percent. This same position description remained on record with HRM through 2010.\n\nIn accordance with the 20 percent assignment to other academic programs, Professor van Heerden participated in the establishment of a new undergraduate interdisciplinary minor in disaster science and management in the College of Arts and Sciences and began teaching a core course that he had developed— Hazards, Disasters, and the Environment—in fall 2001. He later taught two graduate seminars as well.\n\nPerhaps no one noticed at the time of Professor van Heerden’s transfer to the CEE department, but this new appointment seems to have placed him in an untenable situation: the guidelines then in effect for research professors in the engineering college made him ineligible for the research professor title he had held since 1992. From the perspective of the college’s administration, research professors’ appointments were term appointments paid from contracts and grants; Professor van Heerden’s eligibility for a term research appointment had long since expired, and, as previously noted, he was now being paid from the state’s general fund. From the perspective of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, which had become responsible for his salary, Professor van Heerden’s position was outside the tenure system, yet it was a continuing position.\n\nHow these very local perspectives and decisions played out under the more general rules of LSU and the LSU System will be discussed below. At the outset, everyone seemed satisfied with the arrangement, and in January 2002 Professor van Heerden assumed additional duties as the founding director of the LSU Center for the Study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes, funded by a five-year, $3.65-million grant from the Louisiana Board of Regents. According to a press release issued at the time, it was to be operated by the Hurricane Center and its purpose was to “consider and evaluate possible hurricane scenarios in an attempt to predict the impact of a hurricane strike, the preparations that should be made to prepare for such a strike, and post-disaster recovery.” Central to the efforts of the two “sister” centers was the development of computer models for predicting hurricane storm surges, models minutely calibrated to local terrain that could provide accurate information on which the public, government agencies, first responders, oil companies, and others could rely in an emergency. The Hurricane Public Health Center, as it came to be known, also examined such hurricane- and flood-related issues as mass evacuations, emergency accommodation for people and their pets, the spread of infectious diseases, contamination of the water supply, and residual contamination of air and soil. The department’s 2002 fall newsletter reported with pride about the “$3.7-million Health Millennia Fund grant.”\n\nProfessor van Heerden’s department chair at this time, Professor George Z. Voyiadjis, was supportive. In a memorandum dated August 15, 2002, he wrote in favor of Professor van Heerden’s being moved to a ninemonth “academic appointment,” describing him as “a solid member of our faculty, [who] conducts research and serves on the committees of four graduate students. He continues to make strong contributions to our departmental research goals as well as carry out [a] vigorous individual research program. Dr. van Heerden is an asset to our department, and we are honored to include him as part of our research personnel.” Professor Voyiadjis also wrote, “[T]his is not a tenuretrack position at this time.” He was later to testify that, although Professor van Heerden was not required to teach classes, he was rated 3.5 on a 4-point scale in undergraduate student evaluations. “I applaud him for that,” he added. For the first half of his decade as a member of the CEE department, Professor van Heerden received consistently positive performance evaluations from his chair, evaluations including recognition of and commendation for the service and teaching aspects of his position. His chair praised his success at research funding but encouraged him to publish more refereed articles in professional journals.\n\nIn November 2003, Professor van Heerden underwent a formal reappointment review by the CEE department faculty. His position description was interpreted as 5 percent administration (the deputy directorship) and 95 percent research. The senior faculty members conducting the review commented on his performance in the traditional categories of instruction, research/scholarship, and service. Professor van Heerden had by then taught his core undergraduate course on disaster science and management three times and had served on the committees of five students—one PhD and four master’s degree candidates—but, noting that “his appointment has no teaching requirement,” the faculty committee did not assess his teaching. He was judged to have an “outstanding level of research funding.” His research output in publications was “less than the norm for the department, but reflects the particular nature of his appointment with its emphasis on advisory and technology transfer activity” (that is, service), an activity judged “notable.” The review recommended his reappointment for three additional years.\n\nWithin the context of Professor van Heerden’s generally positive annual evaluations, conducted by his department chair, a matter of contention was the percentage of effort he was supposed to devote to research. Members of the CEE faculty listed their activities annually and submitted them electronically to the chair, who then provided an overall evaluation and made comments on instruction, research/scholarship, and service/professional activity. The investigating committee noted a variety of inconsistencies and errors, some trivial, some continuing for years before being corrected in Professor van Heerden’s evaluations. When asked about them in his deposition, Professor Voyiadjis testified that he had assistance in these matters and made no great effort to root out mistakes himself, having some thirty-five members of the department to review. Professor van Heerden told the investigating committee that he had conscientiously recorded the correct percentages given in his job description every year, but that Professor Voyiadjis had annually deleted them. Professor Voyiadjis testified that he had changed the percentage of effort in research to 100 percent every year over Professor van Heerden’s objection that instruction, service, and professional activity accounted for 70 percent of his position description. Professor Voyiadjis conceded that Professor van Heerden’s interpretation of his position had been derived from the previous chair, but, he stated, “I explained to him that his coming with the title of Associate Professor of Research . . . [meant] that [his position] is 100 percent research.” On another occasion the chair told him, “My evaluation is solelyon research.” Professor van Heerden’s disputed research percentage was to be pivotal for his case.\n\nA June 2004 evaluation by Professor Voyiadjis observed that Professor van Heerden “is publishing his research work in refereed archival journals at the same time that he is being called upon as a speaker for numerous groups.” That same year the LSU Graduate Council approved Professor van Heerden for a three-year term as an associate member of the university’s graduate faculty, a membership that previous evaluations had identified as important. The documentation supporting the nomination, submitted by Professor Voyiadjis, listed Professor van Heerden’s duties as 20 percent teaching, 30 percent research, and 50 percent administration.\n\nThe College of Engineering, in step with LSU’s 2003 National Flagship Agenda, adopted a new mission statement in September 2004 that appeared to embrace the sort of applied science that the two hurricane centers supported:\n\nTo serve as a center of learning and a source of technical expertise for Louisiana and the Nation by graduating skilled engineers and construction managers well prepared for productive professional careers; to identify and develop new technologies through leading-edge research; and to disseminate and implement these technologies for the benefit of government, industry, and society.\n\nBy letter of March 17, 2005, then-dean of engineering Zaki Bassiouni commended Professor van Heerden’s success in obtaining funding for Gulf Coast hurricane surge modeling, remarking on his “commitment to excellence” and his “dedication to teaching, research, and professional service.” The dean continued, “[T]hrough your professional service and academic outreach, you have extended your own knowledge to enhance the lives of others, in addition to motivating your students to follow your lead.” At the department level, in annual evaluations of June 2004 and again in July 2005, Professor Voyiadjis commended Professor van Heerden “for his effectiveness in obtaining national publicity for LSU’s activities in solving hurricane-related problems.” The LSU Office of Public Affairs touted the university’s “World-renowned Hurricane Experts”:\n\nLSU is home to one of the largest groups of hurricane experts in the nation. These experts will be available to the media for expert comment or analysis throughout the potentially active 2005 season. LSU’s researchers are studying all aspects of hurricanes and tropical storms as part of a comprehensive research effort that will benefit the citizens of Louisiana and the entire Gulf Coast region.\n\nIvor van Heerden was listed among these “hurricane experts,” and he was identified as “associate professor, civil and environmental engineering.”\n\nII. Factual Background (after Hurricane Katrina)\n\nAs Hurricane Katrina approached the coast of Louisiana in late August 2005, both the Hurricane Center and the Hurricane Public Health Center, involving faculty and graduate students from a variety of LSU units and elsewhere, were active around the clock. Professor van Heerden secured permission from the board of regents to turn the public health center’s research funding to “full operational support” in the areas of its scientists’ and engineers’ expertise to assist numerous federal, state, and local agencies that sought advice and support from LSU’s hurricane experts. The models they produced were posted on the public health center’s website and thus were likewise available to the press. The hurricane centers bumped other users from LSU’s supercomputer to run the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) stormsurge models that led to calls for the evacuation of New Orleans published in the Times-Picayune newspaper and made mandatory by Mayor Ray Nagin. Nor were the two centers alone in their efforts. Personnel from all over LSU with disaster resources to contribute stepped forward to help. From Katrina’s landfall on August 29, Professor van Heerden was in a national spotlight that LSU was proud to share. He was given an LSU cap and T-shirt to wear in media interviews, for which he was in constant demand; an LSU tie and lapel pin were provided for his first appearance on Meet the Press. Then-chancellor Sean O’Keefe wrote of those early days, “Experts from LSU’s Hurricane Center as well as researchers on campus in other disciplines provided news agencies with information and insight.”\n\nUniversity resources were placed at Professor van Heerden’s disposal: on September 9, an LSU campus police officer escorted him and two other LSU investigators through military roadblocks for a site visit to the flooded areas of New Orleans. The Army Corps of Engineers had been describing Katrina as a Category 4 hurricane, more massive than the city’s levees had been designed to with stand and had attributed the vast flooding to storm surges that “overtopped” the concrete walls of the levees, undermining the earthen walls below. But what the LSU investigators found—later confirmed by their own further tests and by those of the other official investigative teams—was evidence inconsistent with overtopping: debris lines below the tops of some levees and an absence of scoured trenches on the protected sides of some levee walls. They hypothesized that structural failure of the levees had accounted for most of the city’s flooding and most of its deaths. As word of these findings spread on campus, Vice Provost Charles Wilson sent an e-mail message confirming a meeting to Drs. Harold Silverman and Robert R. Twilley, respectively interim vice chancellor for research and graduate studies and director of the university’s Wetland Biogeochemistry Institute. He wrote, “One of the issues will be Ivor; we must get him on the team and have him change his story.”\n\nBy September 21, enough evidence had accumulated for Professor van Heerden to describe the flooding to the Washington Post as a “catastrophic structural failure” in a front-page article in which LSU’s Hurricane Center featured prominently. LSU’s Hurricane Public Health Center and LSU’s Natural Systems Modeling Laboratory were also mentioned in the article, which was picked up by other news media. By implication, the Army Corps of Engineers—which had been charged by Congress to design and construct a hurricane protection system for the New Orleans area after Hurricane Betsy flooded the city in 1965—bore responsibility for the failed levees. It would be nearly a year after Katrina, however, before the Corps would accept the responsibility laid at its feet by Professor van Heerden.\n\nIn the two weeks following the appearance of the article in the Washington Post, and as criticism of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intensified nationally, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development commissioned LSU to establish a select group of academic and private-sector experts, headed by Professor van Heerden, “to understand, first, what performance was expected of the Greater New Orleans hurricane protection system and, second, to identify causes of failure as part of an effort to improve future performance.”3 The nine-member body of engineers and scientists, officially designated the State of Louisiana Forensic Data Gathering Team, was ubiquitously known as “Team Louisiana.” Its contract with Louisiana’s transportation department was administered by LSU’s College of Engineering. Professor van Heerden was called to testify before the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in his official capacity as head of Team Louisiana.\n\nIn the midst of these developments, and as his media appearances increased, Professor van Heerden began to have serious trouble with his administrative superiors. A confidential memorandum dated October 24, 2005, from one of his senior departmental colleagues, Professor Roy K. Dokka, to Dr. Michael Ruffner, vice chancellor for communications and university relations, complained that the “image o fLSU” was being damaged by “a deluge of irresponsible reports to the media being spewed” by (unnamed) non-tenure-track persons with “NO credentials, training, or experience in the field about which they opine.” The memorandum went on to predict “serious credibility, political, and perhaps, legal liability issues” for LSU, and Professor Dokka reports, “I have been in Washington several times recently meeting with the congressional delegation and federal agencies. In almost every contact, I am asked how so-and-so’s irresponsible behavior is tolerated.” The memorandum ended by opining that LSU “will remain in third-rate category unless the ‘cowboys’ are reined in.”\n\nExternal pressures on university administrators were apparently intense during this time. Professor Raymond B. Seed of the University of California, Berkeley, who headed the National Science Foundation’s investigative team (known as “the Berkeley team”) and who praised the work of Team Louisiana highly, wrote of “extreme Federal pressure” on the LSU administration being exerted over the winter of 2005–06. He wrote that his own university “was also approached in an inappropriate manner . . . but such untoward pressures were simply rebuffed. That, in the end, probably goes right to the heart of what really separates a top-flight university with one of the top colleges of engineering in the nation (and the top-rated Department of Civil Engineering in the nation) from a university like LSU.”4\n\nIn the week following Professor Dokka’s memorandum, an exchange of e-mail messages took place between LSU administrators and university attorneys about Ivor van Heerden and “the image of LSU.”5 The administration declined to allow Professor van Heerden the services of an LSU attorney to assist him with his upcoming US Senate testimony, scheduled for November 2, and he was summoned to a meeting with Vice Chancellor Ruffner. At that meeting, on November 11, Dr. Ruffner was joined by Interim Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Studies Silverman, whose office had financial authority for Professor van Heerden’s position.\n\nSummarizing what had transpired in a memorandum of understanding addressed to the two vice chancellors four days later, Professor van Heerden wrote, “I agreed to no longer talk to the media directly because you stated that my talking to the media was hurting LSU’s chances to obtain federal funds.” Responding the next day, Vice Chancellor Ruffner made an about-face from LSU caps and ties, writing of Professor van Heerden’s contacts with the media, “I do not consider any topic off limits. All I ask is that each person make it clear that opinions are not those of LSU. It is up to each of you to insure that media do not portray your opinions as those of LSU. This is your responsibility if you choose to speak with media.” He continued, “Also, LSU will engage in helping with [the] recovery of Louisiana, not in pointing blame. The chancellor has begun initiatives toward this goal, and it would not be useful to have the university associated, intentionally or not, with efforts aimed at causation.” One such chancellor’s initiative was published that same month, produced by Dr. Ruffner’s office: LSU in the Eye of the Storm. Although the book concentrates on LSU’s considerable contributions to relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Katrina, it attributes the deaths and destruction to a “natural disaster,” in conflict with Team Louisiana’s findings that the greater number of deaths and most of the destruction had resulted from man-made causes. In any event, that an administrator would instruct hurricane scientists not to seek causes of hurricane destruction is difficult for this investigating committee to comprehend, the more so because of the explicit charge that Team Louisiana had received from the state’s department of transportation.\n\nProfessor van Heerden’s November 15 memorandum continued, “Another issue we discussed was complaints LSU had received about me presenting myself as an engineer and talking about engineering issues. . . . I reiterate that I have never claimed to be an engineer.” He also pointed out that he had been invited to give talks in colleges of engineering at various universities where “they did not seem to have an issue with me being a geologist talking about soil issues and foundation failures” or commenting on levees and their construction. According to faculty members in the CEE department, Professor van Heerden, as spokesperson for a team that included professional engineers, inevitably reported the judgments of the engineers on his team when he faulted the Army Corps of Engineers. In vain, the investigating committee reviewed scores of articles and video clips for evidence that Professor van Heerden had misrepresented his training or had indicated that the views he expressed were those of LSU. The committee’s inference is that reporters’ inaccuracies were more likely the result of LSU’s own website search function and its telephone book, both of which abbreviated Professor van Heerden’s title and identified him as a member of the CEE department faculty.6\n\nOther subjects of the meeting, according to Professor van Heerden’s memorandum, were the LSU administration’s introduction of a requirement that he report to five supervisors any and all contacts with the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA)7; that if he spoke with Governor Kathleen Blanco or the senior members of her administration, which they preferred that he not do, then these contacts also were to be reported to his supervisors; and that he was to decline to participate in any of the committees the governor was then establishing, including the Coastal Restoration and Protection Committee on which she had already asked him and two of his colleagues to serve. Professor van Heerden said that when he protested the vice chancellors’ demands, he was reminded that his salary was paid through Dr. Silverman’s office. Finally, the vice chancellors emphasized, and Professor van Heerden accepted, that when he spoke to the media or to Congress henceforth, he was doing so in his capacity as a citizen. It should be noted in this context that Governor Blanco’s administration was Democratic and that criticizing the Army Corps of Engineers, like criticizing FEMA, was widely viewed in Louisiana as a direct attack on the national Republican administration then in office. While the investigating committee has refrained from dwelling on the number of partisan political remarks that feature prominently throughout the documentation of this case, it should be well understood that, in the years following Hurricane Katrina, coinciding with elections in Louisiana, political rhetoric was intense and ubiquitous in the media. Professor van Heerden’s assistance to the administration of Governor Blanco and his opposition to a Republican-led “master plan” for the state’s recovery are central to the events chronicled in this report. It would be misleading to ignore the political nature of what transpired at LSU during those years.\n\nIn the view of this investigating committee, Professor van Heerden’s November 11, 2005, meeting with the two vice chancellors marks a point at which the LSU administration’s deliberate effort to position other faculty members in the roles then occupied by Professor van Heerden became obvious.8 The administration’s plans for a new direction envisioned close cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers, with its deep pockets for recovery funding, and centered on two individuals, Dr. Twilley, director of the Wetland Biogeochemistry Institute, and Dr. Twilley’s supervisor, Vice Chancellor for Research and Economic Development Brooks Keel.\n\nHaving been instructed to report his contacts with the governor, Professor van Heerden duly notified his five supervisors on December 7 that he had been asked to report to the governor’s mansion that afternoon. In his capacity as head of Team Louisiana, he spent several hours assisting Governor Blanco’s preparations for congressional testimony. The next day Dr. Twilley, one of the five stipulated recipients of such notifications, wrote to the head of the state’s Office of Coastal Affairs, saying of Professor van Heerden, “I just want the governor to know that Ivor was not involved in our coastal restoration team that helped the [Corps of Engineers] develop the Chief Engineer’s report, so he does not represent the wider coastal science and engineering community. . . . We just want to make sure that the most qualified individuals from higher education are providing the context that the science and engineering community has been developing.”\n\nAlso in December 2005, Vice Chancellor Silverman, accompanied by other LSU officials, requested a meeting with the executive director of the LRA, Andrew Kopplin, who later testified that he was told that “they had another expert on their faculty who was, in their view, trained in levees and that Dr. van Heerden’s expertise was not in levees but was in a different area; and they felt like the engineering and scientific background of this other individual was superior and that Dr. van Heerden wasn’t qualified in that particular area of expertise.”\n\nNot only did the university administrators intend to put their own people in key positions; they simultaneously pressured CEE department chair Voyiadjis to terminate Professor van Heerden’s position. E-mail messages to Dean Bassiouni dated December 21, 2005, and January 4 and 5, 2006, detail Professor Voyiadjis’s polite stalling tactics. Acknowledging that the dean required his signature “on correspondence you are preparing for the purpose of discharging Ivor” and agreeing to comply, he nevertheless provided a positive list of Professor van Heerden’s contributions in the first e-mail, a suggestion in the second that the terms the dean had stipulated might equally apply to Professor Dokka, and a request in the third that he be given permission first to speak to a lawyer and to Vice Provost Wilson. At about the same time, Professor Voyiadjis took into his confidence a senior faculty member sympathetic to Professor van Heerden, Professor John Pardue, raising the more general issue of avoiding harm to the department and mentioning the document he was expected to sign. Professor Pardue later testified that he had used the information to impress upon Professors van Heerden and Levitan that “the university’s dissatisfaction” had reached a new level and that “they needed to be very aware of that and decide then if they were going to change behavior or progress in another way.” Professor Pardue also testified that he had heard remarks by vice chancellors indicating that they would terminate the van Heerden position shortly.\n\nIt seems to the investigating committee that the LSU administration wanted first to get its ducks in a row. In January 2006, Dr. Twilley wrote confidentially to Dr. Bruce A. Ebersole, chief of the Army Corps of Engineers Flood and Storm Protection Division in its Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory at the Research and Development Center, welcoming the establishment of a “science-client relation to support the coastal forecasting needs of government agencies”—work that Professor van Heerden had been leading since 2002. Dr. Twilley attached a draft Coastal Modeling Initiative that he said was “being discussed at the vice-chancellor level of LSU.” When Dr. Ebersole replied, asking whether he should telephone Professor van Heerden or Professor Hassan Mashriqui, a storm-surge modeler in the LSU Hurricane Center, Dr. Twilley steered him to speak to the latter “about the skill sets necessary to run the ADCIRC model.” Professor Mashriqui stayed quiet about the new partnership, and Dr. Twilley told Hurricane Center Director Marc Levitan that he was not interested in the ADCIRC model Professor van Heerden had used from 2002 to 2005.\n\nDuring the period from 2002 to 2005, Professor van Heerden later testified in court, “[W]e had a Web page and we had shared our storm-surge modeling data with state agencies, the fire chiefs in New Orleans, [and] the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, who manages levees. We had put it up on a Web page. We had always had numerous requests from mayors [and from] chemical companies, for instance, who had hazardous chemicals on the ground and were worried about the potential of flooding; and obviously we always passed [our data] on to the media. And we know from Hurricane Katrina that the connection we had with . . . The Times-Picayune . . . was responsible for many, many more people evacuating than had originally intended to evacuate.” These notification procedures and the involvement of the press will prove relevant to events in summer 2008 and to connections between freedom of research and publication and freedom of extramural speech.\n\nConflicts continued to swirl around Professor van Heerden. Colleagues both sympathetic and unsympathetic told the investigating committee that they knew already by early 2006 that the administration was preparing for “getting rid” of Professor van Heerden. One department member described him as “a freebie to the department,” adding that Professor van Heerden had done nearly everything possible to ensure his own nonreappointment and should have taken more pains to avoid appearing partisan, especially when writing about public policy issues. Authoring articles, this department member added, is harder than basking in the limelight. “Engineers are elitist toward scientists,” he told the investigating committee. “It’s great he brought all that money into the department, but I thought he should play LSU ball or get out.” After Katrina, the investigating committee found, the university applied multiple pressures to ensure that Professor van Heerden would indeed get out.\n\nProfessor van Heerden, however, remained very much in the public eye through the media and was a frequent subject of blogs where complex issues were likely to be interpreted in political terms and where partisan politics colored the comments. After he co-authored a popular book, published in May 2006 on the post-Katrina devastation, The Storm: What Went Wrong and Why during Hurricane Katrina: The Inside Story from One Louisiana Scientist, describing the November 2005 meeting with Vice Chancellors Ruffner and Silverman, the New York Times printed “A Scientist’s Book on Katrina Draws Fire at LSU,”9 including interviews with Drs. Dokka and Ruffner, an article viewed by many as acknowledging that Professor van Heerden’s days at LSU were numbered.10 Dr. Ruffner replied in his official capacity by letter to the New York Times. He claimed that the “engineering faculty and its dean” had requested his and Dr. Silverman’s intervention—a claim sharply denied by Professor van Heerden’s departmental colleagues, who maintained that Professor Dokka’s complaint tothedean hadbeen the single catalyst. Dr. Ruffner also undermined Professor van Heerden’s credibility as a spokesperson about levees: “He is trained in geology and botany, not civil engineering.” Professor van Heerden’s PhD is in marine sciences, and his courses in botany, appearing nowhere on his curriculum vitae, were taken as an undergraduate in South Africa. Dr. Ruffner’s letter noted that Professor van Heerden had agreed not to “speak on matters for which he has no professional credentials or training,” implying that he had previously done so—an implication denied not only by Professor van Heerden but also by his engineering colleagues.\n\nLSU in the Eye of the Storm, for which Dr. Ruffner takes credit,11 casts Katrina as a natural disaster, a point of view opposite Professor van Heerden’s contention in The Storm that the disaster was man-made. The declaration Dr. Ruffner’s letter made in closing, that LSU supports “total freedom of expression,” rang hollow to many members of the faculty. Forty-seven scientists and other faculty members at LSU crafted a strongly worded criticism of Dr. Ruffner’s letter. The New York Times did not print it, but the Advocate did. After describing Professor van Heerden’s credentials, the letter said, “The attempt to muzzle a professor seems to have been motivated by worries that criticism of powerful men and agencies may jeopardize federal funding to LSU. This anxiety loses sight of what is really important, namely, that human error and incompetence caused a good part of Hurricane Katrina’s terrible death and destruction and that recognizing past mistakes is necessary to avoid future ones.” The letter continued, “Universities have a special mission, even a duty, to examine and speak on all matters, especially on those that affect the public. Academic freedom means that faculty members are free to investigate and discuss issues. . . . [A]dministrative attempts to determine the outcome of research by intimidating professors tarnish the institution.”\n\nProfessor van Heerden wrote to Dr. Ruffner in self-defense, without result. Then the director of the Hurricane Center, Professor Levitan, tried to present Dr. Ruffner with numerous documents to elicit a correction and apology in defense of his deputy’s bona fides. Professor Levitan later testified, “I took these materials [to Dr. Ruffner] to show [Professor van Heerden’s] background; I took the materials about our Center for the Study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes where Professor van Heerden had been leading a group of twenty someodd scientists from several campuses for—in fact since 2002—to study the exact situation of a Hurricane Katrina–like storm.” The vice chancellor, he said, refused to look at the materials and kept redirecting the conversation to LSU’s desire to publicize the Hurricane Center, telling Professor Levitan, as he later testified and as he later told the investigating committee, that “van Heerden is a problem and if you guys get rid of him, the university would be much more supportive.” Professor Levitan would remain unwilling to cooperate in the ouster of his colleague. The investigating committee found it ironic that in 2006, in the midst of these post-publication episodes, Professor van Heerden received an LSU book award for The Storm, signed by Dean Bassiouni, “in recognition and appreciation for this scholarly publication.”\n\nIn October 2006, Professor van Heerden’s department chair showed him an October 2005 draft policy for research faculty in the College of Engineering and stated that this document, which Professor van Heerden reports he had not previously seen, would govern his future at LSU.12 Under the new policy, (a) Professor van Heerden would no longer be permitted to teach as part of his assigned academic duties, (b) he would be subject to future renewals of only one year at a time (he had been serving on a renewable three-year contract), and (c) his performance would be judged exclusively on research. The college’s policy in effect when Professor van Heerden had first been appointed associate professor–research had been established in June 1990 and lightly amended by the college policy committee in June 1996. It stipulated that “full-time research personnel,” explicitly including research professors at all ranks, “must be funded exclusively from sources external to the university.” Thus its applicability to Professor van Heerden— like that of its successor policy—can be doubted. In any case, the 1990 policy stated in reference to point (a), above, that “[t]he faculty in the department in which the adjunct appointment resides must approve . . . possible teaching responsibilities,” which had led to Professor van Heerden’s teaching undergraduate and graduate courses. The earlier document is silent on points (b) and (c). Perhaps Professor Voyiadjis had doubts about the applicability of the new policy to Professor van Heerden, for he made no provision for the annual reappointment evaluations required under the new policy’s “renewal process.” Professor van Heerden objected sharply to his chair and to Vice Chancellor Keel, but he received a chilling reply from the latter, who told him that he planned to increase LSU’s support of hurricane research and had appointed Dr. Twilley as an associate vice chancellor of research and economic development “to help lead these efforts at LSU.” He professed his agreement with the notion of 100 percent effort in research for research faculty and publication in “Science-quality journals,” adding that a research faculty member on “hard money” is “a very unusual circumstance” that “we should examine across campus closely next year.”\n\nIn late 2006 and early 2007, Chancellor O’Keefe declined a request by a large number of Professor van Heerden’s supporters, among them scientists and members of the New Orleans community, to endorse their nomination of Professor van Heerden for the 2007 National Wetlands Award, presented annually to “individuals who have excelled in wetlands protection, restoration, and education.” The chancellor was advised by Vice Chancellor Keel, who wrote, “We would not want this award to justify his potentially misguided view of service/science. . . . [W]e need to be careful giving Ivor our ‘official stamp of approval’ in light of some of the negative reactions he has generated.”\n\nTeam Louisiana’s final report became national news in March 2007, renewing criticism of the Army Corps of Engineers. Dr. Keel sent a string of links to stories in the national media to Drs. Twilley and Silverman, asking how the publicity surrounding “Ivor’s ‘Team Louisiana’ report” would “affect our efforts.” Further e-mail correspondence among the administrators, their eyes on “as much as $350 million,” documents their continued attempts to make sure that state and federal legislators and officials “know the difference between Ivor and the rest of LSU.”\n\nProfessor van Heerden was asked to serve as an expert witness in April 2007 by attorneys for the plaintiffs in Katrina-related litigation against the US government and the Army Corps of Engineers. In July, one of the attorneys wrote to his colleagues, copying Professor van Heerden, “I would not be surprised if LSU fires him if he testifies.” The attorney went on to say that he had been informed “several months ago” of the “possibility of Ivor being fired,” but he reported a more recent encounter as well:\n\nJust last week I had lunch with Chancellor O’Keefe. LSU does not want Ivor or anyone else associated with LSU to testify against the Corps. Remember, the hierarchy with LSU now is very Republican oriented. Also, the top fundraiser for LSU’s huge $750-million drive is former Congressman Hinson Moore. In addition, as I told you all, Chancellor O’Keefe is a well-connected Republican, and I am certain that LSU is concerned that if Ivor is identified as being adverse to the Corps and its large corporate, pro-Republican interests, it could have serious adverse [e]ffects for LSU. . . . They just don’t want their people front and center in such politically charged conflicts, especially in a capacity that opposes the current Republican regime.\n\nProfessor van Heerden was eventually able to participate as an ordinary witness, subpoenaed to testify, but not as an “expert.”\n\nDuring the hurricane season of 2007, when Professor van Heerden sought routine supercomputer priority for tracking two “disturbances” at the request of Louisiana’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and the state police, Vice Chancellor Keel replied that his newly appointed associate vice chancellor, Dr. Twilley, would be coordinating all campus requests for the emergency commitment of computer resources. Professor van Heerden’s request was not granted. Dr. Twilley soon established a comprehensive Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment (CERA) unit that excluded Professor van Heerden. Other faculty members associated with Professor van Heerden told the investigating committee that being included on the CERA list did not mean they were actually invited to participate.\n\nVice Chancellor Keel wrote as follows to Professor van Heerden on August 31, 2007, copying Drs. Levitan, Voyiadjis, Bassiouni, Ruffner, and Twilley: “Ivor, my firm recommendation is to NOT make any comments to the press; any media inquiry should be referred to university relations; thanks.” Off campus, a concerted media campaign arose defending the Corps of Engineers and attacking its critics, notably Professor van Heerden, in the New Orleans press. The online affiliate of the Times-Picayune, NOLA.com, was hit with thousands of such posts purporting to be from ordinary citizens of New Orleans (more than seven hundred were traced in a single six-week period in late 2008 and early 2009) that were in fact sent from government computers inside the Corps offices in New Orleans. The campaign continued even after summer 2009, when an internal review, prompted by the affidavit of a former NOLA.com employee, led the Corps commander to announce that the problem had been addressed. Meanwhile, CERA was aggressively pursuing its partnership with the Corps.\n\nAlthough the performance evaluations conducted by Professor van Heerden’s department chair were generally positive during this time, he was repeatedly encouraged to publish more articles in professional journals. When senior faculty met in early 2008 to discuss his reappointment, Professor Voyiadjis “brought up the 100 percent issue,” to which some members of the faculty immediately raised objections. In their view, Professor van Heerden was being squeezed out, and the chair’s intransigence about the research percentage was aiding that effort. During the faculty meeting, Professor Levitan produced in evidence a copy of the van Heerden position description then on file with the university’s human resources office. The result of the meeting was an evenly divided vote among the participating faculty, seven for renewal and seven against. Professor Voyiadjis acknowledged in an e-mail message to Professor van Heerden that his job description had been controversial in the reappointment meeting and, in an attached memorandum through the dean, set out to clarify Professor van Heerden’s job description in CEE. He noted that Professor van Heerden’s “current appointment should reflect limited involvement in service, technology transfer, and outreach” but, referencing the college research personnel policy, added, “The formal job description is 100 percent research.” The statement does not appear in the cited policy or in any other policy that has thus far come to light. The Faculty Grievance Committee, based on its review of the submitted documents and changes in Professor van Heerden’s assigned duties reflected in various annual performance evaluations, found considerable “ambiguity in the job assignment[s] on record” for him over the course of his decade of service in the CEE department.\n\nProfessor Voyiadjis decided to reappoint Professor van Heerden, as he later testified, to “give him the benefit of the doubt and allow him one more year to prove his case.” He did so with the tacit approval of the dean (then Dr. Bassiouni, who retired at the end of that academic year). By memorandum dated April 14, 2008, Professor Voyiadjis notified Professor van Heerden of the renewal of his appointment, but he conveyed the concern of “a number of CEE [department] faculty that you did not demonstrate a journal publication record in your field of specialization commensurate with your appointment as Associate Professor–Research.” The chair advised him that, “during the next year, my expectations would be that you will be active in seeking external funds for your research program and publishing peer-reviewed archival journal publications in science or engineering journals relevant to your research areas.” Professor van Heerden told the investigating committee, however, that he was bumped from some grants as colleagues sought to distance themselves from him under the increasing pressure of his unlikely reappointment.\n\nWhen the hurricane season of 2008 began, CERA, under Dr. Twilley, had authority for storm-surge modeling and liaison with state officials through the new Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP), so Professor van Heerden, still denied access to the LSU supercomputer, made no preparations to do modeling. The CERA models, however, proved unreliable. Professor Levitan, director of the Hurricane Center, testified that when he and the director of the Climate Center approached Dr. Twilley to seek permission for Professor van Heerden to be allowed in the state’s EOC, arguing that his expertise was necessary, “Dr. Twilley relented and agreed to let Ivor participate if it was deemed that—if his services were requested by the state—but [said] that he didn’t want to have anything to do with Ivor; he didn’t want Ivor to be in his office, and [he] made some kind of comment about he might get fired for even allowing Ivor to participate in that limited manner.” When Hurricane Gustav came ashore (landfall September 1), CERA experienced difficulty with its newer ADCIRC model (an Army Corps of Engineers–FEMA model SL15), and the EOC contacted Professor van Heerden for help. At that point, Dr. Twilley turned over priority control of his own smaller computer cluster to the Hurricane Center to run an earlier version of the ADCIRC model that was well tested and stable, namely, the model used during Katrina and Rita that had been refined and customized to southeast Louisiana since 2002. As Professor Levitan testified, “In operations, you don’t go with the state-of-the-art research model that takes a long time and may be cranky, and may or may not work. You go with the model potentially that’s working and running—and you can get results fast.” Power outages in Baton Rouge disrupted the model runs, however, and help came from a Hurricane Center research associate driving back from New York who found a hotel offering high-speed Internet access and ran the successful models from there. Hurricane Ike hit Louisiana only twelve days later (landfall September 13), but CERA had announced that it would not be making model runs, so Professor van Heerden was again asked by the governor’s office to run surge models and provide advice. Receiving additional requests from the state police and the Sea Grant Coastal Advisor, among others, he posted his data on the web, with the governor’s thanks. Dr. Twilley, however, ordered him to remove them, and he did.\n\nDr. Twilley had forbidden the dissemination of data on the web (which had been standard procedure at the LSU Hurricane Center from 2002 to 2005), asserting, as he told the press, that the display of conflicting models confused the public.13 He added that the National Weather Service (NWS) had formally reprimanded LSU for the public release of information that should have gone only to GOHSEP. Because this latter remark could refer only to Professor van Heerden’s posting after Ike, Professor van Heerden wrote to officials at the NWS and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in an effort to track down the reprimand. Bill Read, director of NOAA’s Tropical Prediction Center, replied, “We have neither the desire nor reason to be dictating what other institutions can distribute via the Web. In fact, I encourage other entities involved in hurricane work to make data available, as you all likely have information we are not aware of.”\n\nProfessor van Heerden’s 2009 evaluation for reappointment began, as in 2008, with his submission of materials. Before consideration of his record began, however, he was summoned to an April 9 meeting with Interim Dean of Engineering W. David Constant. Also present were one of the engineering college’s associate deans, Dr. Warren Waggenspack, and Professor van Heerden’s faculty adviser, Professor Charles Delzell. Professor van Heerden was notified orally, as well as by a letter handed to him dated April 3, that he was being issued a terminal appointment for the 2009–10 academic year. Dean Constant’s decision not to reappoint Professor van Heerden, the reasons for which he declined to state, preceded by nearly a month the meetings of the department’s senior faculty on April 27 and May 4, at which further review and a vote on Professor van Heerden’s reappointment were to occur. Irregularities, discussed in detail below in the “Issues” section of this report, included the chair’s decision to hold the senior faculty meetings at all, given the previously issued notice of nonreappointment and the dean’s unexpected presence at the department meeting. Discussion is said to have been minimal. By a vote of eight to four, with four abstentions, the department faculty recommended against Professor van Heerden’s reappointment.\n\nProfessor van Heerden learned only from press reports that he was also being removed as deputy director of the Hurricane Center, effective one month later, and was not told the reasons for that decision either. The grievance committee was later to “note in passing that Dr. van Heerden was not granted the common courtesy of an official notice stating that he had been terminated as deputy director of the Hurricane Center and would no longer receive the $4,000 salary supplement for that position.”\n\nOn May 21, Chancellor Martin received a petition from more than four thousand New Orleans residents asking him to reconsider the action against Professor van Heerden. No response came from anyone in the LSU administration.\n\nAt the end of September, Professor van Heerden’s lawyers filed a grievance on his behalf with the Faculty Grievance Committee, a standing committee of the LSU Faculty Senate, alleging that inadequate consideration had been given to his qualifications, that the adverse reappointment decision was retaliatory and resulted in significant part from considerations that violated his academic freedom, and that he had a claim to the protections of tenure by virtue of the nature and length of his full-time service at the university, which, notwithstanding his title, involved duties that were never limited to research.\n\nIn its December 18, 2009, report on Professor van Heerden’s grievance, the faculty committee addressed, among other matters, his complaint of retaliation and violation of academic freedom. After citing the applicable provisions relating to academic freedom as set forth in the bylaws and regulations of the LSU board, the report “reaffirms the rights of academic freedom as specified [in the board’s policies] . . . as fundamental for an academic staff member. [The committee] strongly supports and advocates the rights of an academic staff member to investigate, publish, and state his or her findings. The committee notes that the appearance of chastising freedom of expression is not to the university’s benefit.” The committee went on to find that “the grievant provides extensive documentation in support of this complaint, with several exhibits. However, the committee feels it does not have the resource base to investigate or address a grievance of this magnitude.” In short, although the committee acknowledged having received an abundance of evidence supporting Professor van Heerden’s allegation (and elsewhere in its report found a “serious breach of normal procedure” in the assessment of his academic performance and described the evaluation process as “biased” and “compromised”), it declined to carry out an investigation of the evidence because the complaint was “beyond [its] capability and resources to address.” (Its declining to do so and its likewise having cited a lack of “expertise or resources” as a basis for declining to reach a judgment on Professor van Heerden’s claim to de facto tenure will be discussed below, in this report’s treatment of the issues presented by this case.) The grievance committee reiterated in its report that it would not take exception to the department’s negative evaluation of Professor van Heerden’s academic performance, since it lacked the authority to render a substantive judgment on the merits of a candidate for reappointment.\n\nThe administration took no action in the case after the grievance committee issued its report, and there were no subsequent communications between the administration and the committee with respect to that body’s findings and conclusions.\n\nOn February 10, 2010, Professor van Heerden’s lawyers filed a wrongful termination lawsuit in Louisiana state court alleging that LSU officials had conducted a “multi-year campaign of retaliatory harassment” against him, culminating in its termination of his services because of his role as a whistleblower in publicly criticizing the Army Corps of Engineers for levee failures in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Named as defendants in the lawsuit were the LSU Board of Supervisors and four LSU administrative officers: then–Vice Chancellor Keel, Associate Vice Chancellor Twilley, then–interim engineering dean Constant; and CEE department chair Voyiadjis. The defendants subsequently removed the case to federal court, where it remains under judicial review.\n\nIII. The Association’s Involvement\n\nThe national Association first became involved in the van Heerden case in early April 2009, soon after press reports appeared about the administration’s action against him. The staff, concerned about the potential implications of his situation for principles of academic freedom, conveyed its interest in the case to his supporters and to the president of the local AAUP chapter. In June, one of Professor van Heerden’s attorneys forwarded to the staff a large binder of documents relating to his appointment history at LSU, his activities and published statements pre- and post-Katrina, and the reactions, both intramural and extramural, to those activities and statements. The staff awaited the results of the LSU grievance process before it wrote to the administration about the Association’s concerns. In its initial letter to Chancellor Martin dated January 28, 2010, the staff pointed out that, under Association-supported standards, Professor van Heerden was completing his twelfth fulltime year at LSU when notified that his services were being terminated and thus, based on the length of his service, should have been afforded the safeguards of academic due process that accrue with tenure.\n\nAs for the findings in the grievance committee’s report, particularly with regard to his allegation of violation of academic freedom, the staff wrote that, “with the LSU faculty committee’s having declined to take a position on whether Professor van Heerden’s evidence called for a formal hearing, it appears that the serious charges he has made thus far stand unrebutted.” The letter urged that the notification of nonretention be rescinded.\n\nThe administration did not respond to the staff’s January 28 letter or to follow-up letters sent on February 25 and March 11, by which time Professor van Heerden had filed suit. On April 5, the Association’s general secretary authorized an investigation. Outside counsel to the university, responding by letter dated June 2, stated that the pendency of litigation prevented the administration from cooperating with the investigation. The Association’s staff subsequently received the transcripts of the May 2010 court hearing on the litigation with the testimony of key administrative officers on their activities in the case, some by deposition. Several of the documents that were admitted as evidence had been obtained by Freedom of Information Act media requests.\n\nThe Association’s undersigned investigating committee, having examined the extensive available documentation, traveled to Baton Rouge on August 26, 2010, stayed for three nights on the LSU campus, and devoted two days to interviews with members of the LSU faculty who had knowledge of the events in the case of Professor van Heerden or that of the separate case of Professor Dominique Homberger. The committee is grateful to all those who were willing to come forward and is disappointed that the administration declined to participate.\n\nIV. Issues in the Case of Professor van Heerden\n\nAnalyzed here are what appear to the investigating committee to be the central issues raised by the LSU administration’s actions to terminate the services of Professor Ivor van Heerden. The analysis is based on available documentary information, supplemented by interviews with members of the LSU faculty and additional conversations, correspondence, transcripts, and news accounts. The standards considered by the committee in assessing the issues are those set forth in the joint 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, derivative Association-supported documents, and official LSU policies.\n\nA. ACADEMIC DUE PROCESS IN PROFESSOR VAN HEERDEN’S CASE\n\n1. His Right under the 1940 Statement of Principles to the Protections of Tenure\n\nDuring his years of LSU service, Professor van Heerden was not considered for tenure. The LSU System’s Ranks, Provisions, and Policies Governing Appointments and Promotions of the Academic Sta , as adopted in 2002, had defined his position (associate professor– research) as not tenure-eligible, and LSU, Baton Rouge, in its applicable local policy statement (PS-36) needed to be consistent with this determination. Professor van Heerden was eligible, however, to apply for promotion and was also eligible to apply for a vacancy in the tenure system when one occurred, but members of the CEE department interviewed by the Association’s investigating committee said of the latter possibility that the department preferred candidates with doctorates in engineering, not in marine sciences, and candidates who would publish in core engineering journals. Many of Professor van Heerden’s publications were technical and government reports, as well as articles that appeared in public-policy journals.\n\nThe 1940 Statement of Principles calls for a probationary period for full-time faculty not to exceed seven years, after which “teachers or investigators should have permanent or continuous tenure, and their services should be terminated only for adequate cause.” Thus, faculty members whose full-time service has exceeded seven years should be protected by the safeguards of academic due process that accrue with tenure in any action to terminate their services. Leaving aside early grant-funded appointments, Professor van Heerden had been a full-time associate professor at LSU for twelve years, nine of them in the College of Engineering’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, when he was told that his appointment would not be renewed. For all of that time, he was paid from state general funds and his position description covered the three traditional areas of teaching, research, and service, in all of which he participated.14 The investigating committee thus finds that under the 1940 Statement of Principles he should have been afforded the protections of tenure in the action taken against retaining him.\n\n2. His Status at LSU as a Research Professor\n\nProfessor van Heerden’s actual status was affected by his chair’s determination that his position was exclusively in research. Perhaps it is not unreasonable to suppose that a faculty member with “research” in his title would be evaluated at 100 percent research. Not unreasonable, but incorrect by LSU System rules, according to which a research professor’s “primary responsibility is conducting research”—not his sole responsibility, as Professor Voyiadjis insisted annually. Moreover, under strict observance of LSU System rules, “research” would not have been part of Professor van Heerden’s title because he was state-funded and had long ago exceeded the statutory limit for term appointments. According to the policy statement on research ranks (PM-23), “Only individuals whose primary responsibility is conducting research or extension education and who often are paid from grant or contract funds are to be appointed to these ranks.” Professor van Heerden’s position description from 1993 to 1998 assigned 35 percent of his time to re-search and from 1998 to 2010 assigned 30 percent to research, so the policy should not have applied to him.15 The investigating committee questions using a term from his title as dispositive against the position description for his rank.\n\nThe investigating committee noted, too, that Professor Voyiadjis had apparently made no attempt over the years to secure a revision of Professor van Heerden’s position description. As to Professor Voyiadjis’s claim that research faculty are required to spend 100 percent of their time on research, in court testimony he cited PS-36 as the source of the100percent research requirement, but PS-36 has no such requirement. On the contrary, PS-36, in its “Criteria for Evaluating Faculty Job Performance,” stipulates that the “weight to be accorded each [area] will be consistent with the mission of the department and with the faculty member’s job duties and work assignments.” But Professor van Heerden’s official duties remained unchanged from 2000 to 2010, while Professor Voyiadjis evaluated only his research. Further, Professor Voyiadjis made comments in all the areas of effort every year, applauding and commending Professor van Heerden’s work in each of these three areas while, as he said, evaluating only research. He testified that he found the quantity of publications in professional engineering journals “below par,” but that “funding and other considerations” increased his research assessment, which was identical to his overall assessment. Moreover, Professor Voyiadjis’s nomination of Professor van Heerden to the graduate faculty lists his work assignment as 20 percent teaching, 30 percent research, and 50 percent administration. After Professor van Heerden’s appointment to a three-year term as an associate member of the graduate faculty in 2004, Professor Voyiadjis wrote in 2005, “He should set a goal of becoming a full member of the Graduate Faculty”;and in 2006, “He also needs to become a member of the Graduate Faculty,” although full membership was restricted to tenure-system faculty members. These comments from his chair establish both that the teaching of graduate students was a part of what the chair deemed a “100 percent research” appointment and that Professor van Heerden should, in the chair’s view, have sought a tenure-system position.\n\nA further provision of PM-23 was overlooked by those who sought to hold Professor van Heerden to it: “If an individual in one of these ranks is temporarily switched from grant or contract funds to permanent funds, that time does not count toward tenure unless specifically approved through channels by the President” (emphasis in original). Professor van Heerden was permanently switched to state general funds in 1997. One reading of the provision is that, were he to have applied for a tenure-system position, he would have had tenure immediately because of his accrual of thirteen years’ service on permanent funds. Another is that PM-23 could not be fairly applied to Professor van Heerden at all, regardless of his title. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that LSU System rules were being arbitrarily or selectively—and surely inconsistently—applied.\n\nThe second internal document cited as pertinent to Professor van Heerden’s status is PS-36. Its description of scholarship encompasses many examples that, in Professor van Heerden’s position description, are listed as either program development or technical assistance to state and federal agencies; one might argue that some 80 percent of his assignment (all but instruction) would be research by that measure, making him appear more subject to the provisions of PM-23 and PS-36. Such an argument, however, would fly in the face of his chair’s understanding of research. Repeatedly, the chair’s annual evaluations noted the extent to which Professor van Heerden was successful in publishing in “refereed archival journals.” One of the members of the department defended what he regarded as the department’s high standard for research, telling the investigating committee that research in engineering “needs to be heavy on equations—equations, that’s what they want to see.”\n\nThe AAUP’s position on the status of a researcher holding academic rank dates back to 1969. Its Report of the Special Committee on Academic Personnel Ineligible for Tenure, approved that year by the Association’s Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure, states that “[w]henever academic institutions designate full-time researchers as faculty members, either by formal appointment or by conferring the titles of instructor, assistant or associate professor, or professor, those researchers should have all the rights of other faculty members, and . . . the AAUP should apply the 1940 Statement of Principles to them as strictly as to anyone else.”\n\nIn its concluding statement, the special committee offered the following as “definitions of acceptable academic practice in American colleges and universities”:\n\n1. The academic freedom of all teachers and investigators with full-time or part-time appointments in a university should have the full protection of the Association.\n\n2. Full-time teachers and investigators who are appointed to the rank of instructor, assistant professor, associate professor, and professor should have the rights and privileges appropriate to their rank, including tenure or the eligibility for tenure after the appropriate probationary period.\n\nWhen a new policy for research faculty in the College of Engineering was approved in November 2005, changing Professor van Heerden’s conditions of service from three-year to one-year appointments, he had already served more than eight years in a full-time faculty position, more than five in the CEE department. The LSU System policy, as adopted in 2002, specifies that associate professors who are not paid from grant or contract funds hold appointments carrying indefinite tenure.\n\nIn sum, Professor van Heerden had a professorial rank, and his position was funded through the state budget. Over his decade of full-time service on the LSU faculty, the position descriptions and other documents relating to his appointment referred to a variety of duties that he carried out. While the LSU administration has maintained that his official position was always designated as “100 percent research,” the investigating committee believes that either the claim is false or “research” is so broad a term as to cover most of Professor van Heerden’s professional activities. The committee finds that designating Associate Professor van Heerden as a researcher did not invalidate his claim under the 1940 Statement, by the time of his removal from LSU’s full-time faculty, to the safeguards of academic due process that accrue with tenure.\n\n3.The Procedures Followed in Terminating His Services\n\nLSU’s procedures for handling matters involving reappointment that were in effect at the time of Professor van Heerden’s appointment to the full-time faculty require, as a first step, that the dean notify “all chairs of the submission timetable for reappointment/nonreappointment recommendations.” Candidates are to be notified of eligibility for reappointment and afforded opportunity to submit a dossier with supporting documentation for the reappointment file. The second step involves review by the department and its formulation of a recommendation. The department chair is responsible for ensuring that all pertinent materials are available to the eligible voting faculty members, who meet to vote on the candidate and provide the chair with an advisory report, to which the candidate “may prepare a formal letter of response for inclusion with the reappointment file submitted for review beyond the department.” The dean will then “review and make reappointment recommendations” following consideration of the recommendation by the departmental faculty. For associate professors and professors, when nonreappointment is recommended, “a conference with the dean will be held in a timely manner. At the conference, the candidate will receive a written statement outlining reasons for her/his recommendation.”\n\nProfessor van Heerden’s reappointment review in spring 2008 appears to have been carried out largely in accordance with the above cited procedures except for the controversy over the existing job description as compared with the chair’s expectation of 100 percent research. Not so in 2009.\n\nAlthough the “30 percent research” portion of the position description says “basic and applied research,” a very large part of Professor van Heerden’s other responsibilities fell under LSU’s description of scholarship. As a matter of principle in any discipline, the weight to be given to various aspects of a faculty member’s research is a judgment call, the prerogative of the chair, the senior faculty, and the peer-review process. According to the Association’s Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, “scholars in a particular field or activity have the chief competence for judging the work of their colleagues.” The investigating committee nevertheless notes that three things made the value of Professor van Heerden’s work vulnerable to existing divisions within the discipline of civil and environmental engineering: his applied research, his science doctorate, and his government reports and publications bearing on public policy. Until the controversy following Katrina, all his work had been welcome as covered by “the particular nature of his appointment with its emphasis on advisory and technology-transfer activity,” in the words of the 2003 review. Whether Professor van Heerden’s research was in fact constrained following the imposition of the 100 percent rule in April 2008, considered separately below, depends on the extent to which his activities counted as applied research. For more than a decade Professor van Heerden had been heavily involved in technology transfer and public policy—consistent with his actual job description—making himself available to government bodies and publishing technical reports as well as articles in public-policy venues. Professor Voyiadjis’s memorandum of April 14, 2008, quoted above, advised Professor van Heerden that he should abandon a great part of what he had originally been appointed to accomplish and a great part of the commitment proclaimed in the college’s mission statement of 2004.\n\nThe investigating committee faults the decisionmaking process as it was carried out in this case. The interim dean offered no plausible explanation in his court deposition for interfering in the department’s review of research faculty or for his rendering a decision on Professor van Heerden’s appointment status before the department met to discuss the record. Dean Constant’s testimony and that of Professor Voyiadjis were in agreement that the chair was not consulted before the decision was made.\n\nTwo members of the review panel performing the department’s reappointment evaluations told the investigating committee that the assessment of Professor van Heerden’s record had not begun when word was received that the dean had already acted to terminate the position, effective one year hence. Professor Voyiadjis nevertheless called a meeting to discuss Professor van Heerden. At the beginning of the meeting, according to those who attended, Professor Voyiadjis was asked, “Why are we doing this?” He replied that the Office of Human Resource Management required it. The Faculty Grievance Committee reported that when it asked Professor Voyiadjis “about the purpose of the faculty annual evaluation subsequent to the dean’s nonrenewal notice, [he] replied that it was to provide feedback to Dr. van Heerden to help in getting his next job.” He later testified that the meeting was held because the process of review was already in motion and needed to be concluded— testimony contradicted by the testimony of Professor Levitan, a member of the department’s Promotion and Tenure Committee.\n\nThe process also was adversely affected by the presence of Interim Dean Constant at the meeting of senior faculty—a fact that particularly exercised the Faculty Grievance Committee, which remarked in its report that the dean’s “presence tainted the proceedings” and was “intimidating to the attending faculty and a serious breach of normal procedure,” concluding that “[a]ny results obtained under such conditions cannot be considered unbiased.” The investigating committee concurs.\n\nFurther, the investigating committee shares the concern of the grievance committee about the fairness of a process in which a dean, whose powers extend over every member of the department, fails to recuse himself at the departmental level. His attendance was widely (and unsurprisingly) perceived as intimidating. It can be argued that Dean Constant’s presence was irrelevant to the outcome of Professor van Heerden’s case because the matter had already been decided when the department met, but the investigating committee gained the impression both from court testimony by administrators and from faculty interviews that the LSU administration feared further backlash from the faculty and the public.\n\nAnother procedural issue related to the decision in Professor van Heerden’s case concerns the matter of providing him with the reasons for that decision. The Association’s Statement on Procedural Standards in the Renewal or Nonrenewal of Faculty Appointments calls for providing reasons upon request, and applicable policies at LSU also call for the affordance of a written statement of reasons in cases of nonreappointment. During the April 9, 2010, meeting in the dean’s office at which he was notified of the decision to issue him a terminal appointment, Professor van Heerden reports the dean’s having refused his repeated requests to reveal the reasons for that decision, telling him only that it was “not performance-related.” According to the December 18 report of the faculty grievance committee, the dean’s explanation was that the LSU requirement regarding reasons was for performance-related evaluations and that the van Heerden nonrenewal involved a position that would not be refilled. Professor van Heerden, however, reports the interim dean as having told him that the funds for the position would stay with the College of Engineering.\n\nIn the court proceedings, Associate Dean Warren Waggenspack testified that the “core mission” of LSU is teaching, that teaching was not a part of Professor van Heerden’s official responsibilities as a research associate professor, and that accordingly Professor van Heerden was not contributing to that mission. The associate dean’s description of the mission of the university, however, does not conform with LSU’s official mission statement.16\n\nWith regard to the testimony of Interim Dean Constant and Associate Deans Waggenspack and Kelly A. Rusch that the decision was based on budgetary constraints, the judge who presided over the May 2010 proceedings on Professor van Heerden’s motion for a preliminary injunction wrote, “Although it became obvious that these witnesses disliked Dr. van Heerden and handled his termination in a very unprofessional manner, the Court found their testimony credible as to the reasons given for terminating him.” If the decision did result from budgetary concerns and involved no performancerelated issues, the dean could simply have informed him of that fact at the time. One explanation for this reticence was offered in the court testimony of Associate Dean Waggenspack. He stated that “when Dr. Constant didn’t give him a reason for the nonrenewal, [Professor van Heerden] made what I viewed as a threat to have [CNN’s] Anderson Cooper show up at the doorstep to ask questions. Once a threat is made, I’m not going to participate in the conversation.” Professor van Heerden himself testified that he had made a statement about CNN because he “foresaw that there would be a media flurry.”\n\nWith respect to the financial grounds for the action against Professor van Heerden, as of this writing, Louisiana and particularly public higher education throughout the state, including LSU, are facing genuine and severe financial difficulties. However, at the time of the van Heerden decision, prior to April 2009, the situation did not appear so dire. Members of the CEE department had not been aware of budgetary constraints. They report that the budgets for the year before and the year after the van Heerden decision were the same. It should also be noted that, throughout most of his time on the LSU faculty, Professor van Heerden had been bringing in substantial outside grants to the university to support the research and related activities in which he and others were engaged.\n\nDean Constant stated in his court deposition of May 2010 that the decision not to reappoint Professor van Heerden was his to make, that no other administrative officers influenced his decision, and, as previously noted, that the decision was motivated solely by the need to eliminate Professor van Heerden’s position in order to meet mandated budgetary constraints and not by performance-related considerations. The interim dean’s statement can be questioned because of statements and developments subsequent to the van Heerden decision. In August 2009, the new engineering dean, Dr. Richard Koubek, announced seven priorities, the seventh of which was “the development of a 3-year budget process that will be used to inform the college decision making as we face budget cuts and/or surpluses in the future.” Members of the CEE department told the investigating committee that the budget had not been reduced the following year, and departmental conversations about how to absorb anticipated future budget cuts began only after Professor van Heerden was gone. Department members added that budget-cutting was still in the “exercise stage” (in August 2010, when interviews with them were held) because the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology offered a degree of protection that other colleges did not have. Members of the department described as false the allegations of administrators that if Professor van Heerden had not been released, someone else would have had to be dropped. Interim Dean Constant testified that not retaining Professor van Heerden, who was entitled to a year of notice and would be paid another year of salary, “didn’t have anything to do with the upcoming budget” but was influenced by concerns about budgets of later years. Associate Dean Waggenspack had testified similarly at the injunction hearing. There was no impact on later college budgets, however, because, as Professor Voyiadjis testified in June 2011, funds for Dr. van Heerden’s position reverted back to the office of the vice chancellor for research and development. Finally, the appointments of other research professors whose LSU service in the department was shorter than that of Professor van Heerden were renewed.17 Financial considerations, the investigating committee came to believe, were not a significant factor in the administration’s decision against retaining Ivor van Heerden.\n\nB. RAMIFICATIONS FOR ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN THE DECISION AGAINST REAPPOINTING PROFESSOR VAN HEERDEN\n\nUnable to accept the repeated assertions of administrative officers that the decision to terminate Professor van Heerden’s services was motivated by financial constraints rather than performance considerations, the investigating committee has assessed his allegations of retaliation and violation of his academic freedom.\n\n1. Freedom to Dissent from an Administration’s Position without Suffering Retaliation\n\nThe “Academic Freedom” section of the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure begins with the premise that “[t]eachers are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of their other academic duties.” The section goes on to refer to college and university faculty members as “citizens, members of a learned profession, and officers of an educational institution.” The Association has consistently maintained that in this last capacity a professor should have the academic freedom to speak out responsibly against administration policies and actions, especially on issues of high public importance and certainly on issues within the professor’s area of academic competence.\n\nThe evidence already noted in this report of hostility from LSU administrators to Professor van Heerden’s public opposition to their position on post-Katrina flooding is abundant. The investigating committee, unimpressed by the administration’s stated reasons for its decision not to retain him, has no doubt that the decision was to a significant extent in retaliation for his opposition.\n\nAs asserted in the Association’s 1994 statement On the Relationship of Faculty Governance to Academic Freedom, faculty members have the right under principles of academic freedom to communicate their views “on matters having to do with their institution and its policies” and “on issues of public interest generally,” and they have this right “even if their views are in conflict with one or another received wisdom.” When Professor van Heerden complained to the Faculty Grievance Committee that the decision against retaining him was retaliatory and in violation of his academic freedom, that body, as stated earlier, acknowledged in its response that academic freedom is crucial for a member of the academic staff and that the evidence supporting the van Heerden allegation was abundant. The grievance committee declined, however, to reach formal findings on the matter, stating that it lacked “the resource base to investigate or address a grievance of this magnitude.”\n\nThe investigating committee asked the grievance committee chair, Professor Pratul Ajmera, why his committee had stopped short of an explicit assessment of the issue and what resource base had been lacking. He replied that requested documents had been supplied readily and that all the witnesses had been cooperative but that his committee believed some aspects of the case required judgments of law and the committee had no means of consulting with attorneys. He added that a number of people named in the grievance were no longer at LSU, thus preventing a full examination of all the disputed facts. The investigating committee suggests that the grievance committee members were perhaps overly modest in thinking that they needed counsel from an attorney at law in order to issue a formal finding on whether the administration had violated Professor van Heerden’s academic freedom by denying him retention in retaliation for his continuing dissent from the prevailing LSU position on post-Katrina flooding. This investigating committee does not hesitate in itself reaching a finding that the LSU administration’s action against Professor van Heerden, largely if not entirely because of his dissent, violated his academic freedom.\n\n2. Freedom to Engage in the Research of One’s Choosing\n\nInterim Dean Constant insisted in his court testimony that Professor van Heerden had criticized the failed levees and resulting New Orleans flooding not in his official capacity on the faculty as a researcher but rather in his capacity as a private citizen. Whether he did so as a private citizen (the investigating committee has argued to the contrary) or as an academic citizen or more narrowly as a researcher, administrative actions in defining his research responsibilities had a negative impact on his academic freedom to determine the kind of research he chose to do.\n\nProfessor van Heerden argues that his freedom as a researcher was constrained when Professor Voyiadjis, his chair, following his reappointment review in 2008, defined the focus of his research and urged him to publish more peer-reviewed scientific papers: “If [you are] reappointed, the emphasis of your research during the upcoming year is intended to be in the broadly defined areas of coastal and hurricane science and engineering, natural disaster response and mitigation, natural systems management and engineering, and coastal restoration consistent with your research qualifications. This research emphasis may change from appointment period to appointment period, depending on the research needs of the Department and the College of Engineering.” The clear implication of his chair’s concluding sentence is that Professor van Heerden’s research areas were to be determined by the department and college on a year-byyear basis—a severe restriction for any scientist accustomed for decades to determining his own research priorities. The list of research possibilities is broad, and much of it is taken from Professor van Heerden’s curriculum vitae, as Professor Voyiadjis later testified. Throughout his career at LSU, Professor van Heerden had not only studied natural-disaster responses and mitigation; he had also participated in those activities, and his participation—as was true in the case of Hurricane Katrina—sometimes led to new avenues of research. Although Professor Voyiadjis may well have been calling for the only research emphases possible to preserve Professor van Heerden’s slender chance of remaining on the LSU faculty, the investigating committee finds that the restriction he imposed constituted a constraint on Professor van Heerden’s academic freedom as a senior research scientist to decide his research priorities.\n\n3. Freedom to Engage in Extramural Utterances\n\nThe 1940 Statement of Principles carries an Interpretive Comment, adopted that same year, saying that a college or university administration which “believes that the extramural utterances of [a faculty member] have been such as to raise grave doubts concerning the teacher’s fitness for his or her position . . . may proceed to file charges. . . . In pressing such charges, the administration should remember that teachers are citizens and should be accorded the freedom of citizens. In such cases the administration must assume full responsibility, and the American Association of University Professors and the Association of American Colleges are free to make an investigation.”\n\nThe Association’s Committee A in 1964 approved an amplified Statement on Extramural Utterances, which includes the following provisions:\n\nThe controlling principle is that a faculty member’s expression of opinion as a citizen cannot constitute grounds for dismissal unless it clearly demonstrates the faculty member’s unfitness for his or her position. Extramural utterances rarely bear upon the faculty member’s fitness for the position. Moreover, a final decision should take into account the faculty member’s entire record as a teacher and scholar. In the absence of weighty evidence of unfitness, the administration should not prefer charges; and if it is not clearly proved in the hearing that the faculty member is unfit to continue, the faculty committee should make a finding in favor of the faculty member concerned.\n\nUnder the policies of the LSU System, academic freedom “includes the right of a member of the academic staff of the University System to exercise in speaking, writing, and action outside the University the ordinary rights of a citizen.” The LSU policies, reiterating a caution included in the 1940 Statement of Principles, also state that “when a member of the academic staff is not officially designated to represent the University System, the staff member must indicate clearly that he or she is speaking as an individual citizen.”\n\nThe activities Professor van Heerden undertook and the statements he made that attracted controversy were so much a part of his normal academic duties—and an extension in order to meet the extraordinary demands related to Hurricane Katrina—that the boundary between freedom of research and publication and freedom of extramural speech is more difficult to establish than it usually is. Even his contact with the journalistic world, often a hallmark of extramural expression, is comp"
