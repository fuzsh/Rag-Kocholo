        "text": "Abstract\n\nSmall-animal models and reverse genetics systems are powerful tools for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication, virulence, and interaction with the host immune response in vivo. Rotavirus (RV) causes acute gastroenteritis in many young animals and infants worldwide. Murine RV replicates efficiently in the intestines of inoculated suckling pups, causing diarrhea, and spreads efficiently to uninoculated littermates. Because RVs derived from human and other non-mouse animal species do not replicate efficiently in mice, murine RVs are uniquely useful in probing the viral and host determinants of efficient replication and pathogenesis in a species-matched mouse model. Previously, we established an optimized reverse genetics protocol for RV and successfully generated a murine-like RV rD6/2-2g strain that replicates well in both cultured cell lines and in the intestines of inoculated pups. However, rD6/2-2g possesses three out of eleven gene segments derived from simian RV strains, and these three heterologous segments may attenuate viral pathogenicity in vivo. Here, we rescued the first recombinant RV with all 11 gene segments of murine RV origin. Using this virus as a genetic background, we generated a panel of recombinant murine RVs with either N-terminal VP8* or C-terminal VP5* regions chimerized between a cell-culture-adapted murine ETD strain and a non-tissue-culture-adapted murine EW strain and compared the diarrhea rate and fecal RV shedding in pups. The recombinant viruses with VP5* domains derived from the murine EW strain showed slightly more fecal shedding than those with VP5* domains from the ETD strain. The newly characterized full-genome murine RV will be a useful tool for dissecting virus-host interactions and for studying the mechanism of pathogenesis in neonatal mice.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/v16050767\n\nView details for PubMedID 38793648\n\nAbstract\n\nHuman parechoviruses (PeV-A) are increasingly being recognized as a cause of infection in neonates and young infants, leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses to severe sepsis and meningitis. However, the host factors required for parechovirus entry and infection remain poorly characterized. Here, using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screens, we identify myeloid-associated differentiation marker (MYADM) as a host factor essential for the entry of several human parechovirus genotypes including PeV-A1, PeV-A2 and PeV-A3. Genetic knockout of MYADM confers resistance to PeV-A infection in cell lines and in human gastrointestinal epithelial organoids. Using immunoprecipitation, we show that MYADM binds to PeV-A1 particles via its fourth extracellular loop, and we identify critical amino acid residues within the loop that mediate binding and infection. The demonstrated interaction between MYADM and PeV-A1, and its importance specifically for viral entry, suggest that MYADM is a virus receptor. Knockout of MYADM does not reduce PeV-A1 attachment to cells pointing to a role at the post-attachment stage. Our study suggests that MYADM is a multi-genotype receptor for human parechoviruses with potential as an antiviral target to combat disease associated with emerging parechoviruses.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-024-47825-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 38658526\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 6893760\n\nAbstract\n\nThe current live rotavirus (RV) vaccines show reduced effectiveness in developing countries, calling for vaccine strategies with improved efficacy and safety. We generated pseudovirus nanoparticles (PVNPs) that display multiple ectodomains of RV viral protein 4 (VP4), named S-VP4e, as a nonreplicating RV vaccine candidate. The RV spike protein VP4s that bind host receptors and facilitate viral entry are excellent targets for vaccination. In this study, we developed scalable methods to produce three S-VP4e PVNPs, each displaying the VP4e antigens from one of the three predominant P[8], P[4], and P[6] human RVs (HRVs). These PVNPs were recognized by selected neutralizing VP4-specific monoclonal antibodies, bound glycan receptors, attached to permissive HT-29 cells, and underwent cleavage by trypsin between VP8* and VP5*. 3D PVNP models were constructed to understand their structural features. A trivalent PVNP vaccine containing the three S-VP4e PVNPs elicited high and well-balanced VP4e-specific antibody titers in mice directed against the three predominant HRV P types. The resulting antisera neutralized the three HRV prototypes at high titers; greater than 4-fold higher than the neutralizing responses induced by a trivalent vaccine consisting of the S60-VP8* PVNPs. Finally, the trivalent S-VP4e PVNP vaccine provided 90-100% protection against diarrhea caused by HRV challenge. Our data supports the trivalent S-VP4e PVNPs as a promising nonreplicating HRV vaccine candidate for parenteral delivery to circumvent the suboptimal immunization issues of all present live HRV vaccines. The established PVNP-permissive cell and PVNP-glycan binding assays will be instrumental for further investigating HRV-host cell interactions and neutralizing effects of VP4-specific antibodies and antivirals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acsnano.4c00544\n\nView details for PubMedID 38353701\n\nAbstract\n\nRotavirus diarrhea-associated illness remains a major cause of global death in children under five, attributable in part to discrepancies in vaccine performance between high- and low-middle-income countries. Next-generation probiotic vaccines could help bridge this efficacy gap. We developed a novel recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus (rLA) vaccine expressing rotavirus antigens of the VP8* domain from the rotavirus EDIM VP4 capsid protein along with the adjuvants FimH and FliC. The upp-based counterselective gene-replacement system was used to chromosomally integrate FimH, VP8Pep (10 amino acid epitope), and VP8-1 (206 amino acid protein) into the L. acidophilus genome, with FliC expressed from a plasmid. VP8 antigen and adjuvant expression were confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blot. Rotavirus na√Øve adult BALB/cJ mice were orally immunized followed by murine rotavirus strain ECWT viral challenge. Antirotavirus serum IgG and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell responses were detected in rLA-vaccinated mice. A day after the oral rotavirus challenge, fecal antigen shedding was significantly decreased in the rLA group. These results indicate that novel rLA constructs expressing VP8 can be successfully constructed and used to generate modest homotypic protection from rotavirus challenge in an adult murine model, indicating the potential for a probiotic next-generation vaccine construct against human rotavirus.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/vaccines11121774\n\nView details for PubMedID 38140179\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10747613\n\nAbstract\n\nFecal-oral pathogens encounter constitutively expressed enteric alpha-defensins in the intestine during replication and transmission. Alpha-defensins can be potently antiviral and antibacterial; however, their primary sequences, the number of isoforms, and their activity against specific microorganisms often vary greatly between species, reflecting adaptation to species-specific pathogens. Therefore, alpha-defensins might influence not only microbial evolution and tissue tropism within a host but also species tropism and zoonotic potential. To investigate these concepts, we generated a panel of enteric and myeloid alpha-defensins from humans, rhesus macaques, and mice and tested their activity against group A rotaviruses, an important enteric viral pathogen of humans and animals. Rotaviral adaptation to the rhesus macaque correlated with resistance to rhesus enteric but not myeloid alpha-defensins and sensitivity to human alpha-defensins. Infection by mouse and human rotaviruses was either resistant to or increased by host enteric alpha-defensins, although the effects of cross-species alpha-defensins did not follow an obvious pattern. Because infection by all rotaviruses tested was resistant to or enhanced by enteric alpha-defensins from their hosts, exposure to alpha-defensins may have shaped their evolution. We then used a genetic approach to identify the viral attachment and penetration protein, VP4, as a determinant of alpha-defensin sensitivity. Our results provide a foundation for future studies of the VP4-dependent mechanism of defensin neutralization, highlight the species-specific activities of alpha-defensins, and focus future efforts on a broader range of rotaviruses that differ in VP4 to uncover the potential for enteric alpha-defensins to influence species tropism. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children. Like other fecal-oral pathogens, rotaviruses encounter abundant, constitutively expressed defensins in the small intestine. These peptides are a vital part of the vertebrate innate immune system. By investigating the impact that defensins from multiple species have on the infectivity of different strains of rotavirus, we show that some rotaviral infections can be inhibited by defensins. We also found that rotaviruses may have evolved resistance to defensins in the intestine of their host species, and some even appropriate defensins to increase their infectivity. Because rotaviruses infect a broad range of animals and rotaviral infections are highly prevalent in children, identifying immune defenses against infection and how they vary across species and among viral genotypes is important for our understanding of the evolution, transmission, and zoonotic potential of these viruses as well as the improvement of vaccines.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/jvi.00962-23\n\nView details for PubMedID 37787534\n\nAbstract\n\nRotaviruses (RVs) preferentially replicate in the small intestine and frequently cause severe diarrheal disease, and the following enteric infection generally induces variable levels of protective systemic and mucosal immune responses in humans and other animals. Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) is a simian RV that was previously used as a human RV vaccine and has been extensively studied in mice. Although RRV replicates poorly in the suckling mouse intestine, infection induces a robust and protective antibody response. The recent availability of plasmid only-based RV reverse genetics systems has enabled the generation of recombinant RVs expressing foreign proteins. However, recombinant RVs have not yet been experimentally tested as potential vaccine vectors to immunize against other gastrointestinal pathogens invivo. This is a newly available opportunity because several live-attenuated RV vaccines are already widely administered to infants and young children worldwide. To explore the feasibility of using RV as a dual vaccine vector, we rescued replication-competent recombinant RRVs harboring bicistronic gene segment 7 that encodes the native RV nonstructuralprotein 3 (NSP3) protein and a human norovirus (HuNoV) VP1 protein or P domain from the predominant genotype GII.4. The rescued viruses expressed HuNoV VP1 or P protein in infected cells invitro and elicited systemic and local antibody responses to HuNoV and RRV following oral infection of suckling mice. Serum IgG and fecal IgA from infected suckling mice bound to and neutralized both RRV and HuNoV. These findings have encouraging practical implications for the design of RV-based next-generation multivalent enteric vaccines to target HuNoV and other human enteric pathogens.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.2214421120\n\nView details for PubMedID 36821582\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that an intranasal dose of 108 TCID50 M2SR (M2-deficient single replication) influenza vaccine protected against highly drifted H3N2 influenza challenge in a subset of subjects who demonstrated ‚â•2-fold increase in microneutralization (MN) antibodies to Belgium2015 (the challenge strain) after vaccination. Here, we describe a phase 1b, observer-blinded, dose-escalation study demonstrating an increased proportion of responders with this signal of immune protection.METHODS: Sero-susceptible subjects ages 18-49 years were randomized to receive two doses (108-109TCID50) of M2SR or placebo administered 28 days apart. Clinical specimens were collected before and after each dose. The primary objective was to demonstrate safety of M2SR vaccines (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03999554).RESULTS: The vaccine was well-tolerated at all dose levels. Against Belgium2015, ‚â•2-fold increases in MN antibodies were noted among 40% (95% CI 24.9-56.7) of subjects following a single 108 TCID50 M2SR dose and among 80.6% (95% CI 61.4-92.3) after 109 dose (P<0.001). A single 109 TCID50 dose of M2SR generated ‚â•4-fold HAI seroconversion against the vaccine strain in 71% (95% CI 52.0-85.8) of recipients. Mucosal and cellular immune responses were also induced.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that M2SR may provide substantial protection against infection with highly drifted strains of H3N2 influenza.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/infdis/jiac433\n\nView details for PubMedID 36350017\n\nAbstract\n\nRotavirus live-attenuated vaccines, both mono- and pentavalent, generate broadly heterotypic protection. B-cells isolated from adults encode neutralizing antibodies, some with affinity for VP5*, that afford broad protection in mice. We have mapped the epitope of one such antibody by determining the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of its antigen-binding fragment (Fab) bound to the virion of a candidate vaccine strain, CDC-9. The Fab contacts both the distal end of a VP5* Œ≤-barrel domain and the two VP8* lectin-like domains at the tip of a projecting spike. Its interactions with VP8* do not impinge on the likely receptor-binding site, suggesting that the mechanism of neutralization is at a step subsequent to initial attachment. We also examined structures of CDC-9 virions from two different stages of serial passaging. Nearly all the VP4 (cleaved to VP8*/VP5*) spikes on particles from the earlier passage (wild-type isolate) had transitioned from the \"upright\" conformation present on fully infectious virions to the \"reversed\" conformation that is probably the end state of membrane insertion, unable to mediate penetration, consistent with the very low in vitro infectivity of the wild-type isolate. About half the VP4 spikes were upright on particles from the later passage, which had recovered substantial in vitro infectivity but had acquired an attenuated phenotype in neonatal rats. A mutation in VP4 that occurred during passaging appears to stabilize the interface at the apex of the spike and could account for the greater stability of the upright spikes on the late-passage, attenuated isolate. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus live-attenuated vaccines generate broadly heterotypic protection, and B-cells isolated from adults encode antibodies that are broadly protective in mice. Determining the structural and mechanistic basis of broad protection can contribute to understanding the current limitations of vaccine efficacy in developing countries. The structure of an attenuated human rotavirus isolate (CDC-9) bound with the Fab fragment of a broadly heterotypic protective antibody shows that protection is probably due to inhibition of the conformational transition in the viral spike protein (VP4) critical for viral penetration, rather than to inhibition of receptor binding. A comparison of structures of CDC-9 virus particles at two stages of serial passaging supports a proposed mechanism for initial steps in rotavirus membrane penetration.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/jvi.00627-22\n\nView details for PubMedID 35924923\n\nAbstract\n\nDengue virus (DENV) NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for viral replication. To gain insights into NS1 functions in mosquito cells, the protein interactome of DENV NS1 in C6/36 cells was investigated using a proximity biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. A total of 817 mosquito targets were identified as protein-protein interacting with DENV NS1. Approximately 14% of them coincide with interactomes previously obtained in vertebrate cells, including the oligosaccharide transferase complex, the chaperonin containing TCP-1, vesicle localization, and ribosomal proteins. Notably, other protein pathways not previously reported in vertebrate cells, such as epigenetic regulation and RNA silencing, were also found in the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Due to the novel and strong interactions observed for NS1 and the epigenetic regulator DIDO1 (Death-Inducer Obliterator 1), the role of DIDO1 in viral replication was further explored. Interactions between NS1 and DIDO1 were corroborated in infected mosquito cells, by colocalization and proximity ligation assays. Silencing DIDO1 expression results in a significant reduction in DENV and ZIKV replication and progeny production. Comparison of transcription analysis of mock or DENV infected cells silenced for DIDO1 revealed variations in multiple gene expression pathways, including pathways associated with DENV infection such as RNA surveillance, IMD, and Toll. These results suggest that DIDO1 is a host factor involved in the negative modulation of the antiviral response necessary for flavivirus replication in mosquito cells. Our findings uncover novel mechanisms of NS1 to promote DENV and ZIKV replication, and add to the understanding of NS1 as a multifunctional protein. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease to humans. Dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for replication and modulation of innate immunity. To gain insights into NS1 functions, the protein interactome of dengue virus NS1 in Aedes albopictus cells was investigated using a proximity biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. Several protein pathways, not previously observed in vertebrate cells, such as transcription and epigenetic regulation, were found as part of the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Among those, DIDO1 was found to be a necessary host factor for dengue and Zika virus replication in mosquito cells. Transcription analysis of infected mosquito cells silenced for DIDO1 revealed alterations of the IMD and Toll pathways, part of the antiviral response in mosquitoes. The results suggest that DIDO1 is a host factor involved in modulation of the antiviral response and necessary for flavivirus replication.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/jvi.00704-22\n\nView details for PubMedID 35652656\n\nAbstract\n\nFecal-oral pathogens encounter constitutively expressed enteric alpha-defensins in the intestine during replication and transmission.

To investigate these concepts, we generated a panel of enteric and myeloid alpha-defensins from humans, rhesus macaques, and mice and tested their activity against group A rotaviruses, an important enteric viral pathogen of humans and animals. Rotaviral adaptation to the rhesus macaque correlated with resistance to rhesus enteric, but not myeloid, alpha-defensins and sensitivity to human alpha-defensins. While mouse rotaviral infection was increased in the presence of mouse enteric alpha-defensins, two prominent genotypes of human rotaviruses were differentially sensitive to human enteric alpha-defensins. Furthermore, the effects of cross-species alpha-defensins on human and mouse rotaviruses did not follow an obvious pattern. Thus, exposure to alpha-defensins may have shaped the evolution of some, but not all, rotaviruses. We then used a genetic approach to identify the viral attachment and penetration protein, VP4, as a determinant of alpha-defensin sensitivity.

While suckling mice prove to be highly useful small animal models of RV infection and pathogenesis, direct visualization tools are lacking to track the temporal dynamics of RV replication and transmissibility in vivo. Here, we report the generation of the first recombinant murine-like RV that encodes a Nano-Luciferase reporter (NLuc) using a newly optimized RV reverse genetics system. The NLuc-expressing RV was replication-competent in cell culture and both infectious and virulent in neonatal mice in vivo. Strong luciferase signals were detected in the proximal and distal small intestines, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. We showed, via a noninvasive in vivo imaging system, that RV intestinal replication peaked at days 2 to 5 post infection. Moreover, we successfully tracked RV transmission to uninoculated littermates as early as 3 days post infection, 1 day prior to clinically apparent diarrhea and 3 days prior to detectable fecal RV shedding in the uninoculated littermates. We also observed significantly increased viral replication in Stat1 knockout mice that lack the host interferon signaling. Our results suggest that the NLuc murine-like RV represents a non-lethal powerful tool for the studies of tissue tropism and host and viral factors that regulate RV replication and spread, as well as provides a new tool to facilitate the testing of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the future.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fimmu.2022.911024\n\nView details for PubMedID 35967392\n\nAbstract\n\nRotavirus (RV)-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), the product of gene segment 5, effectively antagonizes host interferon (IFN) signaling via multiple mechanisms. Recent studies with the newly established RV reverse genetics system indicate that NSP1 is not essential for the replication of the simian RV SA11 strain in cell culture. However, the role of NSP1 in RV infection in vivo remains poorly characterized due to the limited replication of heterologous simian RVs in the suckling mouse model. Here, we used an optimized reverse genetics system and successfully recovered recombinant murine RVs with or without NSP1 expression. While the NSP1-null virus replicated comparably with the parental murine RV in IFN-deficient and IFN-competent cell lines in vitro, it was highly attenuated in 5-day-old wild-type suckling pups in both the 129sv and C57BL/6 backgrounds. In the absence of NSP1 expression, murine RV had significantly reduced replication in the ileum, systemic spread to mesenteric lymph nodes, fecal shedding, diarrhea occurrence, and transmission to uninoculated littermates. The defective replication of the NSP1-null RV in small intestinal tissues occurred as early as 1day postinfection. Of interest, the replication and pathogenesis defects of NSP1-null RV were only minimally rescued in Stat1 knockout pups, suggesting that NSP1 facilitates RV replication in an IFN-independent manner. Our findings highlight a pivotal function of NSP1 during homologous RV infections in vivo and identify NSP1 as an ideal viral protein for targeted attenuation for future vaccine development. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus remains one of the most important causes of severe diarrhea and dehydration in young children worldwide. Although NSP1 is dispensable for rotavirus replication in cell culture, its exact role in virus infection in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time in a pathologically valid homologous small animal model, that in the context of a fully replication-competent, pathogenic, and transmissible murine rotavirus, loss of NSP1 expression substantially attenuated virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract, diarrheal disease, and virus transmission. Notably, the NSP1-deficient murine rotavirus also replicated poorly in mice lacking host interferon or inflammasome signaling. Our data provide the first piece of evidence that NSP1 is essential for murine rotavirus replication in vivo, making it an attractive target for developing improved next-generation rotavirus vaccines better suited for socioeconomically disadvantaged and immunocompromised individuals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/mBio.03208-21\n\nView details for PubMedID 34903043\n\nAbstract\n\nM2SR (M2-deficient single replication) is an investigational live intranasal vaccine that protects against multiple influenza A subtypes in influenza-naive and previously infected ferrets. We conducted a phase 1, first-in-human, randomized, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled study of M2SR safety and immunogenicity. Adult subjects received a single intranasal administration with either placebo or one of three M2SR dose levels (106, 107 or 108 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)) expressing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) (24 subjects per group). Subjects were evaluated for virus replication, local and systemic reactions, adverse events (AE), and immune responses post-vaccination. Infectious virus was not detected in nasal swabs from vaccinated subjects. At least one AE (most commonly mild nasal rhinorrhea/congestion) was reported among 29%, 58%, and 83% of M2SR subjects administered a low, medium or high dose, respectively, and among 46% of placebo subjects. No subject had fever or a severe reaction to the vaccine. Influenza-specific serum and mucosal antibody responses and B- and T-cell responses were significantly more frequent among vaccinated subjects vs. placebo recipients. The M2SR vaccine was safe and well tolerated and generated dose-dependent durable serum antibody responses against diverse H3N2 influenza strains. M2SR demonstrated a multi-faceted immune response in seronegative and seropositive subjects.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/vaccines9121388\n\nView details for PubMedID 34960134\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Current influenza vaccines are strain-specific and demonstrate low vaccine efficacy against H3N2 influenza disease, especially when vaccine is mis-matched to circulating virus. The novel influenza vaccine candidate, M2SR (M2-deficient Single Replication), induces a broad, multi-effector immune response.METHODS: A phase 2 challenge study was conducted to assess efficacy of M2SR vaccine expressing HA and NA from A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2, clade 1). Four weeks after vaccination subjects were challenged with antigenically distinct H3N2 virus (A/Belgium/4217/2015, clade 3C.3b), and assessed for infection and clinical symptoms.RESULTS: Adverse events following vaccination were mild and similar in frequency between placebo and M2SR recipients. A single dose of Bris2007 M2SR induced neutralizing antibody to the vaccine (48% of recipients) and challenge strain (27% of recipients). Overall, 54% of M2SR subjects were infected after challenge, compared to 71% of placebo subjects. The subset of M2SR subjects with a vaccine-induced microneutralization response against the challenge virus had reduced rates of infection after challenge (38% vs. 71% of placebo subjects, P=0.0505) and reduced illness.CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies were protected against infection and illness following challenge with an antigenically distinct virus. This is the first demonstration of vaccine-induced protection against a highly drifted H3N2 challenge virus.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/infdis/jiab374\n\nView details for PubMedID 34323977\n\nAbstract\n\nFollowing Kobayashi and colleagues' seminal paper in 20171, in the past four years the rotavirus (RV) field has witnessed a burst in research and publications based on the use of a fully plasmid-based RV reverse genetics systems and subsequent modifications2,3. However, in most cases, the rotaviral strain under interrogation has been the prototypic simian RV SA11-L2 strain (G3P [2]). Of note, a variety of other weakly-to-modestly replication-competent animal and human RV strains, bioluminescent and fluorescent reporter viruses, and clinical isolates of human RVs have proved hard or impossible to rescue using the original reverse genetics system2,4, highlighting a critical need to further enhance the recovery efficiency and expand the rescue tool kit. A number of further modifications of the initial reverse genetics system have enabled the rescue of other RV strains such as the human RV KU and CDC-9 strains, and a murine RV D6/2-like strain4,5. Here, we discuss future possible modifications of existing RV reverse genetics systems to further increase efficiency based on past experience with the improvement of influenza A virus recovery. The development of RV to accommodate the insertion and expression of heterologous sequences have substantial potential in the design of next-generation RV vaccine candidates and enteric viral vectors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198500\n\nView details for PubMedID 34331991\n\nAbstract\n\nAn entirely plasmid-based reverse genetics (RG) system was recently developed for rotavirus (RV), opening new avenues for in-depth molecular dissection of RV biology, immunology, and pathogenesis. Several improvements to further optimize the RG efficiency have now been described. However, only a small number of individual RV strains have been recovered to date. None of the current methods have supported the recovery of murine RV, impeding the study of RV replication and pathogenesis in an in vivo suckling mouse model. Here, we describe useful modifications to the RG system that significantly improve rescue efficiency of multiple RV strains. In addition to the 11 RVA segment-specific (+)ssRNAs, a chimeric plasmid was transfected, from which the capping enzyme NP868R of African swine fever virus (ASFV) and the T7 RNA polymerase were expressed. Secondly, a genetically modified MA104 cell line was used in which several compounds of the innate immune were degraded. Using this RG system, we successfully recovered the simian RV RRV strain, the human RV CDC-9 strain, a reassortant between murine RV D6/2 and simian RV SA11 strains, and several reassortants and reporter RVs. All these recombinant RVs were rescued at a high efficiency (‚â•80% success rate) and could not be reliably rescued using several recently published RG strategies (<20%). This improved system represents an important tool and great potential for the rescue of other hard-to-recover RV strains such as low replicating attenuated vaccine candidates or low cell culture passage clinical isolates from humans or animals.IMPORTANCE Group A rotavirus (RV) remains as the single most important cause of severe acute gastroenteritis among infants and young children worldwide. An entirely plasmid-based reverse genetics (RG) system was recently developed opening new ways for in-depth molecular study of RV. Despite several improvements to further optimize the RG efficiency, it has been reported that current strategies do not enable the rescue of all cultivatable RV strains. Here, we described helpful modification to the current strategies and established a tractable RG system for the rescue of the simian RRV strain, the human CDC-9 strain and a murine-like RV strain, which is suitable for both in vitro and in vivo studies. This improved RV reverse genetics system will facilitate study of RV biology in both in vitro and in vivo systems that will facilitate the improved design of RV vaccines, better antiviral therapies and expression vectors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.01294-20\n\nView details for PubMedID 32759316\n\nAbstract\n\nOur understanding of how rotavirus (RV) subverts host innate immune signaling has greatly increased over the past decade. However, the relative contribution of each virus-encoded innate immune antagonist has not been fully studied in the context of RV infection in vivo Here, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence that the host IFN-inducible 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) pathway effectively suppresses the replication of heterologous RV strains. VP3 from homologous RVs relies on its 2'-5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain to counteract RNase L mediated antiviral signaling. Using a RV reverse genetics system, we show that compared to the parental strain, VP3 PDE mutant RVs replicated at a lower level in the small intestine and shed less in the feces of wild-type mice and such defects were rescued in Rnasel -/- suckling mice. Collectively, these findings highlight an important role of VP3 in promoting viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo in addition to its well characterized function as the viral RNA capping enzyme.ImportanceRotaviruses are significant human pathogens that result in diarrhea, dehydration, and deaths in many children around the world. Rotavirus vaccines have suboptimal efficacy in low to middle income countries, where the burden of the diseases is the most severe. With the ultimate goal to improve current vaccines, we aim to better understand how rotavirus interacts with the host innate immune system in the small intestine. Here, we demonstrate that the interferon-activated RNase L signaling blocks rotavirus replication in a strain-specific manner. In addition, virus encoded VP3 antagonizes RNase L activity both in vitro and in vivo These studies highlight an ever-evolving arms race between antiviral factors and viral pathogens and provide a new means of targeted attenuation for the next-generation rotavirus vaccine design.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.01952-19\n\nView details for PubMedID 32051268\n\nAbstract\n\nRotaviruses (RV) cause acute severe diarrhea in the absence of substantial intestinal inflammation. They are also highly infectious in their homologous host species. The replication capacity of RV in the small bowel is substantially due to its ability to inhibit different types of interferons (IFNs). Here, we find that during RV infection in vitro, both virus-infected and uninfected bystander cells resist STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF7 induction in response to exogenous IFN. Functionally, cellular transcription in response to stimulation with IFN, but not intracellular dsRNA, was inhibited by RV. Further, IFNAR1 stimulation during RV infection significantly repressed a set of virus-induced transcripts. Regulation of IFN signaling in vivo was studied in suckling mice using the highly infectious murine EW RV strain. Kinetic studies indicated that sustained EW RV replication and IFN induction in the small intestine is accompanied by significant decreases in IFN-stimulated transcripts. LPS-mediated intestinal damage, driven by STAT1-induced inflammation, was also prevented in EW RV-infected mice. Remarkably, by ectopically stimulating either IFNAR1 or IFNGR1 in EW RV-infected mice we could eliminate several intestinal antiviral and inflammatory transcriptional responses to RV. In contrast to homologous RV, infection with a STAT1-sensitive heterologous RV strain induced IFN-stimulated transcripts, inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal expression of STAT1-pY701. Finally, RV strain-specific STAT1 regulation also likely determines the intestinal activation of multiple caspases. The simian RRV strain, but not murine EW RV, uniquely triggers the cleavage of both extrinsic and intrinsic caspases (-8, -9, and -3) in a STAT1-mediated manner. Collectively, our findings reveal efficient re-programing of multiple IFN receptors towards a negative feedback mode of signaling, accompanied by suppression of IFN-mediated antiviral, apoptotic, and inflammatory functions, during natural RV intestinal infection.IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is a highly infectious pathogen that causes severe diarrhea. Replication of RV in the small intestine is restricted to homologous host species, and host range restriction is substantially determined by the interferon response. In this study, we demonstrate that during infection, RV bystander cells resist exogenous IFN-mediated STAT1 signaling and transcription. In a suckling mouse model, ectopically stimulating different intestinal interferon receptors during RV infection eliminates several innate and inflammatory antiviral responses. Different intestinal inflammatory cytokines were also suppressed by homologous RV, as was intestinal damage in response to endotoxin. The ability of RV to suppress IFN-mediated receptors likely impacts intestinal cell homeostasis as the cleavage of multiple intestinal caspases during RV infection is mediated by the IFN-STAT1 signaling pathway. Together, our results provide a mechanism underlying both the remarkable interferon resistance of homologous RV, and its ability to prevent substantial inflammatory damage to the small bowel.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.01775-19\n\nView details for PubMedID 31896593\n\nAbstract\n\nIntestinal microfold (M) cells are a unique subset of intestinal epithelial cells in the Peyer's patches that regulate mucosal immunity, serving as portals for sampling and uptake of luminal antigens. The inability to efficiently develop human M cells in cell culture has impeded studies of the intestinal immune system. We aimed to identify signaling pathways required for differentiation of human M cells and establish a robust culture system using human ileum enteroids.We analyzed transcriptome data from mouse Peyer's Patches to identify cell populations in close proximity to M cells. We used the human enteroid system to determine which cytokines were required to induce M cell differentiation. We performed transcriptome, immunofluorescence, scanning electron microscope, and transcytosis experiments to validate the development of phenotypic and functional human M cells.A combination of retinoic acid and lymphotoxin induced differentiation of glycoprotein 2-positive human M cells, which lack apical microvilli structure. Upregulated expression of innate immune-related genes within M cells correlated with a lack of viral antigens after rotavirus infection. Human M cells, developed in the enteroid system, internalized and transported enteric viruses, such as rotavirus and reovirus, across the intestinal epithelium barrier in the enteroids.We identified signaling pathways required for differentiation of intestinal M cells, and used this information to create a robust culture method to develop human M cells with capacity for internalization and transport of viruses. Studies of this model might increase our understanding of antigen presentation and the systemic entry of enteric pathogens in the human intestine.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1053/j.gastro.2020.03.053\n\nView details for PubMedID 32247021\n\nAbstract\n\nWe previously generated 32 rotavirus-specific (RV-specific) recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from B cells isolated from human intestinal resections. Twenty-four of these mAbs were specific for the VP8* fragment of RV VP4, and most (20 of 24) were non-neutralizing when tested in the conventional MA104 cell-based assay. We reexamined the ability of these mAbs to neutralize RVs in human intestinal epithelial cells including ileal enteroids and HT-29 cells. Most (18 of 20) of the \"non-neutralizing\" VP8* mAbs efficiently neutralized human RV in HT-29 cells or enteroids. Serum RV neutralization titers in adults and infants were significantly higher in HT-29 than MA104 cells and adsorption of these sera with recombinant VP8* lowered the neutralization titers in HT-29 but not MA104 cells. VP8* mAbs also protected suckling mice from diarrhea in an in vivo challenge model. X-ray crystallographic analysis of one VP8* mAb (mAb9) in complex with human RV VP8* revealed that the mAb interaction site was distinct from the human histo-blood group antigen binding site. Since MA104 cells are the most commonly used cell line to detect anti-RV neutralization activity, these findings suggest that prior vaccine and other studies of human RV neutralization responses may have underestimated the contribution of VP8* antibodies to the overall neutralization titer.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1172/JCI128382\n\nView details for PubMedID 31403468\n\nAbstract\n\nEnteroviruses (EVs) comprise a large genus of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses whose members cause a number of important and widespread human diseases, including poliomyelitis, myocarditis, acute flaccid myelitis and the common cold. How EVs co-opt cellular functions to promote replication and spread is incompletely understood. Here, using genome-scale CRISPR screens, we identify the actin histidine methyltransferase SET domain containing 3 (SETD3) as critically important for viral infection by a broad panel of EVs, including rhinoviruses and non-polio EVs increasingly linked to severe neurological disease such as acute flaccid myelitis (EV-D68) and viral encephalitis (EV-A71). We show that cytosolic SETD3, independent of its methylation activity, is required for the RNA replication step in the viral life cycle. Using quantitative affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that SETD3 specifically interacts with the viral 2A protease of multiple enteroviral species, and we map the residues in 2A that mediate this interaction. 2A mutants that retain protease activity but are unable to interact with SETD3 are severely compromised in RNA replication. These data suggest a role of the viral 2A protein in RNA replication beyond facilitating proteolytic cleavage. Finally, we show that SETD3 is essential for in vivo replication and pathogenesis in multiple mouse models for EV infection, including CV-A10, EV-A71 and EV-D68. Our results reveal a crucial role of a host protein in viral pathogenesis, and suggest targeting SETD3 as a potential mechanism for controlling viral infections.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41564-019-0551-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 31527793\n\nAbstract\n\nAnnual vaccination with influenza vaccines is recommended for protection against influenza in the United States. Past clinical studies and meta-analysis, however, have reported conflicting results on the benefits of annual vaccination. B-cell responses elicited following repeat influenza vaccinations over multiple seasons have not been examined in detail. We analyzed the B-cell and antibody responses in volunteers vaccinated yearly with seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) from 2010 or 2011 to 2014. Statistical analyses were designed to help correct for possible bias due to reduced sample size in the later years of the study. We show that after the second annual vaccination the frequency of vaccine-specific plasmablasts and the binding reactivity of plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAb) are reduced and do not increase in subsequent years. Similar trends are observed with the serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody response after each annual vaccination, as well as the binding reactivity of PPAb for the hemagglutinin of influenza A vaccine components, even with changes in the seasonal vaccine components during the study. Our findings indicate a diminished B-cell response to annually repeated TIV vaccination. These results emphasize the need of developing improved strategies to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of annual influenza vaccination.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30496437\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this study, we identified, at the single-cell level, naturally induced cytokine-producing circulating cells (CPCCs) in children with dengue virus (DENV) infection ranging clinically from mild to severe disease. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Œ±) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) CPCCs were detected in children with primary or secondary acute dengue virus (DENV) infection, and the pattern of these cytokines was similar to that seen in the supernatant of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells and partially comparable to that found in plasma. Monocytes, B cells, and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) were the primary CPCCs detected, and the frequency of mDCs was significantly higher in severe disease. B cells isolated from children with dengue spontaneously secreted TNF-Œ±, IL-6, and interleukin 10, and supernatants from cultures of purified B cells induced activation of allogeneic T cells, supporting an antibody-independent function of these cells during DENV infection. Thus, CPCCs could be a new immune parameter with potential use to evaluate pathogenesis in this infection.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29390091\n\nAbstract\n\nRotavirus infections are a leading cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis in children <5 years of age. Despite the global introduction of vaccinations for rotavirus over a decade ago, rotavirus infections still result in >200,000 deaths annually, mostly in low-income countries. Rotavirus primarily infects enterocytes and induces diarrhoea through the destruction of absorptive enterocytes (leading to malabsorption), intestinal secretion stimulated by rotavirus non-structural protein 4 and activation of the enteric nervous system. In addition, rotavirus infections can lead to antigenaemia (which is associated with more severe manifestations of acute gastroenteritis) and viraemia, and rotavirus can replicate in systemic sites, although this is limited. Reinfections with rotavirus are common throughout life, although the disease severity is reduced with repeat infections. The immune correlates of protection against rotavirus reinfection and recovery from infection are poorly understood, although rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin A has a role in both aspects. The management of rotavirus infection focuses on the prevention and treatment of dehydration, although the use of antiviral and anti-emetic drugs can be indicated in some cases.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29119972\n\nAbstract\n\nSTAT1 phosphorylation in response to exogenous IFN administration can be inhibited by rotaviral replication both in vitro and in vivo. In addition many rotavirus strains are resistant to the actions of different IFN types . The regulation of multiple IFN type-mediated antiviral pathways by RVs is not well understood. In this study, we find that during infection in vitro and in vivo RV significantly depletes IFN-type I, II, and III receptors (IFNRs). Regulation of IFNRs occurred exclusively within RV-infected cells and could be abrogated by inhibiting the lysosomal-endosomal degradation pathway. In vitro, IFNR degradation was conserved across multiple RV strains that differ in their modes of regulating IFN induction. In suckling mice, exogenously administered types I, II, or III IFN each induced phosphorylation of STAT1-Y701 within intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of suckling mice. Murine EW strain RV infection transiently activated intestinal STAT1 at 1dpi, but not subsequently at 2-3dpi. In response to injection of purified IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ or -Œª, IECs in EW-infected mice exhibited impaired STAT1-Y701 phosphorylation, correlating with depletion of different intestinal IFNRs and impaired IFN-mediated transcription. The ability of EW murine RV to inhibit multiple IFN types led us to test protection of suckling mice from endotoxin-mediated shock, an outcome that is dependent on the host IFN response. Compared to controls, mice infected with EW murine RV were substantially protected against mortality following parenteral endotoxin administration. These studies identify a novel mechanism of IFN subversion by RV and reveal an unexpected protective effect of RV infection on endotoxin-mediated shock in suckling mice.IMPORTANCE Antiviral functions of types 1, 2, and 3 IFN are mediated by receptor-dependent activation of STAT1. Here we find that RV degrades the types 1, 2, and 3 IFN receptors (IFNR) in vitro In a suckling mouse model, RV effectively blocked STAT1 activation and transcription following injection of different purified IFNs. This correlated with significantly decreased protein expression of intestinal types 1 and 2 IFNRs. Recent studies demonstrate that in mice, LPS-induced lethality is prevented by genetic ablation of IFN signaling genes such as IFNAR1 and STAT1. When suckling mice were infected with RV they were substantially protected from lethal exposure to endotoxin. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying rotavirus regulation of different interferons and are likely to stimulate new research into both rotavirus pathogenesis and endotoxemia.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.01394-17\n\nView details for PubMedID 29070687\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5730789\n\nAbstract\n\nRotavirus, a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis and diarrhoea in young children, accounts for around 215,000 deaths annually worldwide. Rotavirus specifically infects the intestinal epithelial cells in the host small intestine and has evolved strategies to antagonize interferon and NF-Œ∫B signalling, raising the question as to whether other host factors participate in antiviral responses in intestinal mucosa. The mechanism by which enteric viruses are sensed and restricted in vivo, especially by NOD-like receptor (NLR) inflammasomes, is largely unknown. Here we uncover and mechanistically characterize the NLR Nlrp9b that is specifically expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and restricts rotavirus infection. Our data show that, via RNA helicase Dhx9, Nlrp9b recognizes short double-stranded RNA stretches and forms inflammasome complexes with the adaptor proteins Asc and caspase-1 to promote the maturation of interleukin (Il)-18 and gasdermin D (Gsdmd)-induced pyroptosis. Conditional depletion of Nlrp9b or other inflammasome components in the intestine in vivo resulted in enhanced susceptibility of mice to rotavirus replication. Our study highlights an important innate immune signalling pathway that functions in intestinal epithelial cells and may present useful targets in the modulation of host defences against viral pathogens.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28636595\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5787375\n\nAbstract\n\nHuman rotaviruses (RVs) are the leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid induction of heterotypic protective immunity to RV, which provides the basis for the efficacy of licensed monovalent RV vaccines, have remained unknown for more than 30 years. We used RV-specific single cell-sorted intestinal B cells from human adults, barcode-based deep sequencing of antibody repertoires, monoclonal antibody expression, and serologic and functional characterization to demonstrate that infection-induced heterotypic immunoglobulins (Igs) primarily directed to VP5*, the stalk region of the RV attachment protein, VP4, are able to mediate heterotypic protective immunity. Heterotypic protective Igs against VP7, the capsid glycoprotein, and VP8*, the cell-binding region of VP4, are also generated after infection; however, our data suggest that homotypic anti-VP7 and non-neutralizing VP8* responses occur more commonly in people. These results indicate that humans can circumvent the extensive serotypic diversity of circulating RV strains by generating frequent heterotypic neutralizing antibody responses to VP7, VP8*, and most often, to VP5* after natural infection. These findings further suggest that recombinant VP5* may represent a useful target for the development of an improved, third-generation, broadly effective RV vaccine and warrants more direct examination.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28637924\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite the wide administration of several effective vaccines, rotavirus (RV) remains the single most important etiological agent of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide, with an annual mortality of over 200,000 people. RV attachment and internalization into target cells is mediated by its outer capsid protein VP4. To better understand the molecular details of RV entry, we performed tandem affinity purification coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to map the host proteins that interact with VP4. We identified an actin-binding protein, drebrin (DBN1), that coprecipitates and colocalizes with VP4 during RV infection. Importantly, blocking DBN1 function by siRNA silencing, CRISPR knockout (KO), or chemical inhibition significantly increased host cell susceptibility to RV infection. Dbn1 KO mice exhibited higher incidence of diarrhea and more viral antigen shedding in their stool samples compared with the wild-type littermates. In addition, we found that uptake of other dynamin-dependent cargos, including transferrin, cholera toxin, and multiple viruses, was also enhanced in DBN1-deficient cells. Inhibition of cortactin or dynamin-2 abrogated the increased virus entry observed in DBN1-deficient cells, suggesting that DBN1 suppresses dynamin-mediated endocytosis via interaction with cortactin. Our study unveiled an unexpected role of DBN1 in restricting the entry of RV and other viruses into host cells and more broadly to function as a crucial negative regulator of diverse dynamin-dependent endocytic pathways.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.1619266114\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000400358000009\n\nView details for PubMedID 28416666\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5422808\n\nAbstract\n\nType I (IFN-Œ±/Œ≤) and type III (IFN-Œª) interferons (IFNs) exert shared antiviral activities through distinct receptors. However, their relative importance for antiviral protection of different organ systems against specific viruses remains to be fully explored. We used mouse strains deficient in type-specific IFN signaling, STAT1 and Rag2 to dissect distinct and overlapping contributions of type I and type III IFNs to protection against homologous murine (EW-RV strain) and heterologous (non-murine) simian (RRV strain) rotavirus infections in suckling mice. Experiments demonstrated that murine EW-RV is insensitive to the action of both types of IFNs, and that timely viral clearance depends upon adaptive immune responses. In contrast, both type I and type III IFNs can control replication of the heterologous simian RRV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and they cooperate to limit extra-intestinal simian RRV replication. Surprisingly, intestinal epithelial cells were sensitive to both IFN types in neonatal mice, although their responsiveness to type I, but not type III IFNs, diminished in adult mice, revealing an unexpected age-dependent change in specific contribution of type I versus type III IFNs to antiviral defenses in the GI tract. Transcriptional analysis revealed that intestinal antiviral responses to RV are triggered through either type of IFN receptor, and are greatly diminished when receptors for both IFN types are lacking. These results also demonstrate a murine host-specific resistance to IFN-mediated antiviral effects by murine EW-RV, but the retention of host efficacy through the cooperative action by type I and type III IFNs in restricting heterologous simian RRV growth and systemic replication in suckling mice. Collectively, our findings revealed a well-orchestrated spatial and temporal tuning of innate antiviral responses in the intestinal tract where two types of IFNs through distinct patterns of their expression and distinct but overlapping sets of target cells coordinately regulate antiviral defenses against heterologous or homologous rotaviruses with substantially different effectiveness.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005600\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000378156900066\n\nView details for PubMedID 27128797\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4851417\n\nAbstract\n\nIn-depth phenotyping of human intestinal antibody secreting cells (ASCs) and their precursors is important for developing improved mucosal vaccines.

We propose that young age and previous infections could be simple factors that affect this response. Here, we evaluated the primary and secondary responses of circulating ASC in infants (6-12 months old) and children (1-14 years old) infected with dengue showing different degrees of clinical severity. The ASC response was delayed and of lower magnitude in infants, compared with older children. In primary infection (PI), the total and envelope (E) protein-specific IgM ASC were dominant in infants but not in children, and a negative correlation was found between age and the number of IgM ASC (rho = -0.59, P = 0.03). However, infants with plasma dengue-specific IgG detectable in the acute phase developed an intense ASC response largely dominated by IgG and comparable to that of children with secondary infection (SI). IgM and IgG produced by ASC circulating in PI or SI were highly cross-reactive among the four serotypes. Dengue infection caused the disturbance of B cell subsets, particularly a decrease in the relative frequency of na√Øve B cells. Higher frequencies of total and E protein-specific IgM ASC in the infants and IgG in the children were associated with clinically severe forms of infection. Therefore, the ASC response induced by dengue is highly influenced by the age at which infection occurs and previous immune status, and its magnitude is a relevant element in the clinical outcome. These results are important in the search for correlates of protection and for determining the ideal age for vaccinating against dengue.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0161795\n\nView details for PubMedID 27560782\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4999220\n\nAbstract\n\nIn-depth phenotyping of human intestinal antibody secreting cells (ASCs) and their precursors is important for developing improved mucosal vaccines.

Recipients of inactivated influenza vaccine containing the same A(H1N1)pdm09 strain were studied for comparison.During acute infection, robust plasmablast responses to the infecting virus were detected, characterized by a greater PPAb reactivity to the conserved influenza virus nuclear protein and to heterovariant and heterosubtypic hemagglutinins, in comparison to responses to the inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. In A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccinees, the presence of baseline serum neutralizing antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting previous exposure to natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, did not affect the plasmablast response to vaccination, whereas repeated immunization with inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine resulted in significantly reduced vaccine-specific and cross-reactive PPAb responses.Natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination result in very distinct patterns of B-cell activation and priming. These differences are likely to be associated with differences in protective immunity, especially cross-protection against heterovariant and heterosubtypic influenza virus strains.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/infdis/jiu580\n\nView details for PubMedID 25336731\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4366605\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground. The immunological bases for the efficacies of the two currently licensed influenza vaccines, the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), are not fully understood. The goal of this study was to identify specific B-cell responses correlated with the known efficacies of these two vaccines.Methods. We compared the B-cell and antibody responses after immunization with 2010/2011 IIV versus LAIV in young adults, focusing on peripheral plasmablasts at days 6-8 post-vaccination.Results. The quantities of vaccine-specific plasmablasts and plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAb) were significantly higher in IIV recipients than in LAIV recipients. No significant difference was detected in the avidity of vaccine-specific PPAb between the two vaccine groups. Proportionally, LAIV induced a greater vaccine-specific IgA plasmablast response as well as a greater plasmablast response to the conserved influenza nuclear protein than did IIV. The cross-reactive plasmablast response to heterovariant strains, as indicated by the relative levels of cross-reactive plasmablasts and the cross-reactive PPAb binding reactivity, was also greater in the LAIV group.Conclusions. Distinct quantitative and qualitative patterns of plasmablast responses were induced by LAIV and IIV in young adults; a proportionally greater cross-reactive response was induced by LAIV.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/infdis/jiu190\n\nView details for PubMedID 24676204\n\nAbstract\n\nRotavirus gastroenteritis is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in Indian children less than 2 years of age. The 116E rotavirus strain was developed as part of the Indo-US Vaccine Action Program and has undergone efficacy trials. This paper reports the efficacy and additional safety data in children up to 2 years of age. In a double-blind placebo controlled multicenter trial, 6799 infants aged 6-7 weeks were randomized to receive three doses of an oral human-bovine natural reassortant vaccine (116E) or placebo at ages 6, 10, and 14 weeks. The primary outcome was severe (‚â•11 on the Vesikari scale) rotavirus gastroenteritis. Efficacy outcomes and adverse events were ascertained through active surveillance. We randomly assigned 4532 and 2267 subjects to receive vaccine and placebo, respectively, with over 96% subjects receiving all three doses of the vaccine or placebo. The per protocol analyses included 4354 subjects in the vaccine and 2187 subjects in the placebo group. The overall incidence of severe RVGE per 100 person years was 1.3 in the vaccine group and 2.9 in the placebo recipients. Vaccine efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in children up to 2 years of age was 55.1% (95% CI 39.9 to 66.4; p<0.0001); vaccine efficacy in the second year of life of 48.9% (95% CI 17.4 to 68.4; p=0.0056) was only marginally less than in the first year of life [56.3% (95% CI 36.7 to 69.9; p<0.0001)]. The number of infants needed to be immunized to prevent one episode of severe RVGE in the first 2 years of life was 40 (95% CI 28.0 to 63.0) and for RVGE of any severity, it was 21 (95% CI 16.0 to 32.0).

Previously, we demonstrated that homologous RV efficiently inhibits IFN induction in single infected and bystander villous IECs in vivo. Paradoxically, RV also induces significant type I IFN expression in the intestinal hematopoietic cell compartment in a relatively replication-independent manner. This suggests that RV replication and spread in IECs must occur despite exogenous stimulation of the STAT1-mediated IFN signaling pathway. Here we report that RV inhibits IFN-mediated STAT1 tyrosine 701 phosphorylation in human IECs in vitro and identify RV NSP1 as a direct inhibitor of the pathway. Infection of human HT29 IECs with simian (RRV) or porcine (SB1A or OSU) RV strains, which inhibit IFN induction by targeting either IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) or NF-Œ∫B, respectively, resulted in similar regulation of IFN secretion. By flow cytometric analysis at early times during infection, neither RRV nor SB1A effectively inhibited the activation of Y701-STAT1 in response to exogenously added IFN. However, at later times during infection, both RV strains efficiently inhibited IFN-mediated STAT1 activation within virus-infected cells, indicating that RV encodes inhibitors of IFN signaling targeting STAT1 phosphorylation. Expression of RV NSP1 in the absence of other viral proteins resulted in blockage of exogenous IFN-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation, and this function was conserved in NSP1 from simian, bovine, and murine RV strains. Analysis of NSP1 determinants responsible for the inhibition of IFN induction and signaling pathways revealed that these determinants are encoded on discrete domains of NSP1. Finally, we observed that at later times during infection with SB1A, there was almost complete inhibition of IFN-mediated Y701-STAT1 in bystander cells staining negative for viral antigen. This property segregated with the NSP1 gene and was observed in a simian SA11 monoreassortant that encoded porcine OSU NSP1 but not in wild-type SA11 or a reassortant encoding simian RRV NSP1.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.01501-13\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000329194600004\n\nView details for PubMedID 24131713\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3911692\n\nAbstract\n\nRotaviruses (RV) are ubiquitous, highly infectious, segmented double-stranded RNA genome viruses of importance in public health because of the severe acute gastroenteritis they cause in young children and many animal species. They are very well adapted to their host, with symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfections being virtually universal during the first 3 years of life. Antibodies are the major arm of the immune system responsible for protecting infants from RV reinfection. The relationship between the virus and the B cells (Bc) that produce these antibodies is complex and incompletely understood: most blood-circulating Bc that express RV-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) on their surface (RV-Ig) are naive Bc and recognize the intermediate capsid viral protein VP6 with low affinity. When compared to non-antigen-specific Bc, RV-Bc are enriched in CD27+ memory Bc (mBc) that express IgM. The Ig genes used by naive RV-Bc are different than those expressed by RV-mBc, suggesting that the latter do not primarily develop from the former. Although RV predominantly infects mature villus enterocytes, an acute systemic viremia also occurs and RV-Bc can be thought of as belonging to either the intestinal or systemic immune compartments. Serotype-specific or heterotypic RV antibodies appear to mediate protection by multiple mechanisms, including intracellular and extracellular homotypic and heterotypic neutralization. Passive administration of RV-Ig can be used either prophylactically or therapeutically. A better understanding of the Bc response generated against RV will improve our capacity to identify improved correlates of protection for RV vaccines.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/microbiolspec.AID-0011-2013\n\nView details for PubMedID 26184961\n\nAbstract\n\nHomologous rotaviruses (RV) are, in general, more virulent and replicate more efficiently than heterologous RV in the intestine of the homologous host. The genetic basis for RV host range restriction is not fully understood and is likely to be multigenic. In previous studies, RV genes encoding VP3, VP4, VP7, NSP1, and NSP4 have all been implicated in strain- and host species-specific infection. These studies used different RV strains, variable measurements of host range, and different animal hosts and no clear consensus on the host range restriction determinants emerged. We used a murine model to demonstrate that enteric replication of murine RV EW is 1,000 to 10,000 fold greater than a simian rotavirus (RRV) in suckling mice. Intestinal replication of a series of EW √ó RRV reassortants was used to identify several RV genes that influenced RV replication in the intestine. The role of VP4 (encoded by gene 4) in enteric infection was strain specific. RRV VP4 only slightly reduced murine RV infectivity; however, a reassortant expressing VP4 from a bovine RV strain (UK) severely restricted intestinal replication in the suckling mice. The homologous murine EW NSP1 (encoded by gene 5) was necessary but not sufficient for promoting efficient enteric growth. Efficient enteric replication required a constellation of murine genes encoding VP3, NSP2, and NSP3 along with NSP1.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.00619-13\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000321590200005\n\nView details for PubMedID 23698306\n\nAbstract\n\nIt is currently not possible to predict which epitopes will be recognized by T cells in different individuals. This is a barrier to the thorough analysis and understanding of T-cell responses after vaccination or infection. Here, by combining mass cytometry with combinatorial peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we have developed a method allowing the rapid and simultaneous identification and characterization of T cells specific for many epitopes. We use this to screen up to 109 different peptide-MHC tetramers in a single human blood sample, while still retaining at least 23 labels to analyze other markers of T-cell phenotype and function. Among 77 candidate rotavirus epitopes, we identified six T-cell epitopes restricted to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 in the blood of healthy individuals. T cells specific for epitopes in the rotavirus VP3 protein displayed a distinct phenotype and were present at high frequencies in intestinal epithelium. This approach should be useful for the comprehensive analysis of T-cell responses to infectious diseases or vaccines.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nbt.2593\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000321579700019\n\nView details for PubMedID 23748502\n\nAbstract\n\nThe human antibody repertoire is one of the most important defenses against infectious disease, and the development of vaccines has enabled the conferral of targeted protection to specific pathogens. However, there are many challenges to measuring and analyzing the immunoglobulin sequence repertoire, including that each B cell's genome encodes a distinct antibody sequence, that the antibody repertoire changes over time, and the high similarity between antibody sequences. We have addressed these challenges by using high-throughput long read sequencing to perform immunogenomic characterization of expressed human antibody repertoires in the context of influenza vaccination. Informatic analysis of 5 million antibody heavy chain sequences from healthy individuals allowed us to perform global characterizations of isotype distributions, determine the lineage structure of the repertoire, and measure age- and antigen-related mutational activity. Our analysis of the clonal structure and mutational distribution of individuals' repertoires shows that elderly subjects have a decreased number of lineages but an increased prevaccination mutation load in their repertoire and that some of these subjects have an oligoclonal character to their repertoire in which the diversity of the lineages is greatly reduced relative to younger subjects. We have thus shown that global analysis of the immune system's clonal structure provides direct insight into the effects of vaccination and provides a detailed molecular portrait of age-related effects.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/scitranslmed.3004794\n\nView details for PubMedID 23390249\n\nAbstract\n\nThe human antibody repertoire is one of the most important defenses against infectious disease, and the development of vaccines has enabled the conferral of targeted protection to specific pathogens.

The goal of this study was to compare the heterovariant B-cell response induced by the monovalent inactivated 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A[H1N1]pdm09) vaccine with that induced by the 2009 seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (sTIV) containing a seasonal influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A[H1N1]) component in young and elderly adults.Plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAb) from young and elderly recipients of A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine or sTIV were tested for binding activity to various influenza antigens.In A(H1N1)pdm09 recipients, the PPAb titers against homotypic A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were similar to those against the heterovariant seasonal A(H1N1) vaccine and were similar between young and elderly subjects. The PPAb avidity was higher among elderly individuals, compared with young individuals. In contrast, the young sTIV recipients had 10-fold lower heterovariant PPAb titers against the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine than against the homotypic seasonal A(H1N1) vaccine. In binding assays with recombinant head and stalk domains of hemagglutinin, PPAb from the A(H1N1)pdm09 recipients but not PPAb from the sTIV recipients bound to the conserved stalk domain.The A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine induced production of PPAb with heterovariant reactivity, including antibodies targeting the conserved hemagglutinin stalk domain.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/infdis/jis664\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000312886400015\n\nView details for PubMedID 23107783\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3532823\n\nAbstract\n\nIn mammalian cells, the first line of defense against viral pathogens is the innate immune response, which is characterized by induction of type I interferons (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that establish an antiviral milieu both in infected cells and in neighboring uninfected cells. Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family, is the primary etiological agent of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that rotavirus replication induces a MAVS-dependent type I IFN response that involves both RIG-I and MDA5, two cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors. This study reports the isolation and characterization of rotavirus RNAs that activate IFN signaling. Using an in vitro approach with purified rotavirus double-layer particles, nascent single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) transcripts (termed in vitro ssRNA) were found to be potent IFN inducers. In addition, large RNAs isolated from rotavirus-infected cells six hours post-infection (termed in vivo 6 hr large RNAs), also activated IFN signaling, whereas a comparable large RNA fraction isolated from cells infected for only one hour lacked this stimulatory activity. Experiments using knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts showed that RIG-I is required for and MDA5 partly contributes to innate immune signaling by both in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNAs. Enzymatic studies demonstrated that in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples contain uncapped RNAs with exposed 5' phosphate groups. RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylated 5' cap structures were also detected in the in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the rotavirus VP3 enzyme, which encodes both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities, is not completely efficient at either 5' capping or 2'-O-methylation of the 5' cap structures of viral transcripts, and in this way produces RNA patterns that activate innate immune signaling through the RIG-I-like receptors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0069825\n\nView details for PubMedID 23894547\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3720929\n\nAbstract\n\n\"Bulk\" measurements of antiviral innate immune responses from pooled cells yield averaged signals and do not reveal underlying signaling heterogeneity in infected and bystander single cells. We examined such heterogeneity in the small intestine during rotavirus (RV) infection. Murine RV EW robustly activated type I IFNs and several antiviral genes (IFN-stimulated genes) in the intestine by bulk analysis, the source of induced IFNs primarily being hematopoietic cells. Flow cytometry and microfluidics-based single-cell multiplex RT-PCR allowed dissection of IFN responses in single RV-infected and bystander intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). EW replicates in IEC subsets differing in their basal type I IFN transcription and induces IRF3-dependent and IRF3-augmented transcription, but not NF-Œ∫B-dependent or type I IFN transcripts. Bystander cells did not display enhanced type I IFN transcription but had elevated levels of certain IFN-stimulated genes, presumably in response to exogenous IFNs secreted from immune cells. Comparison of IRF3 and NF-Œ∫B induction in STAT1(-/-) mice revealed that murine but not simian RRV mediated accumulation of IkB-Œ± protein and decreased transcription of NF-Œ∫B-dependent genes. RRV replication was significantly rescued in IFN types I and II, as well as STAT1 (IFN types I, II, and III) deficient mice in contrast to EW, which was only modestly sensitive to IFNs I and II. Resolution of \"averaged\" innate immune responses in single IECs thus revealed unexpected heterogeneity in both the induction and subversion of early host antiviral immunity, which modulated host range.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.1212188109\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000312605600104\n\nView details for PubMedID 23188796\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3528539\n\nAbstract\n\nIn order to effectively combat pandemic influenza threats, there is a need for more rapid and robust vaccine production methods. In this article, we demonstrate E. coli-based cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) as a method to rapidly produce domains from the protein hemagglutinin (HA), which is present on the surface of the influenza virus. The portion of the HA coding sequence for the \"head\" domain from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain was first optimized for E. coli expression. The protein domain was then produced in CFPS reactions and purified in soluble form first as a monomer and then as a trimer by a C-terminal addition of the T4 bacteriophage foldon domain. Production of soluble trimeric HA head domain was enhanced by introducing stabilizing amino acid mutations to the construct in order to avoid aggregation. Trimerization was verified using size exclusion HPLC, and the stabilized HA head domain trimer was more effectively recognized by antibodies from pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine recipients than was the monomer and also bound to sialic acids more strongly, indicating that the trimers are correctly formed and could be potentially effective as vaccines.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/bit.24581\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000310465300008\n\nView details for PubMedID 22729608\n\nAbstract\n\nProtective immunity to rotavirus (RV) is primarily mediated by antibodies produced by RV-specific memory B cells (RV-mBc). Of note, most of these cells express IgM, but the function of this subset is poorly understood. Here, using limiting dilution assays of highly sort-purified human IgM(+) mBc, we found that 62% and 21% of total (non-antigen-specific) IgM(+) and RV-IgM(+) mBc, respectively, switched in vitro to IgG production after polyclonal stimulation. Moreover, in these assays, the median cloning efficiencies of total IgM(+) (17%) and RV-IgM(+) (7%) mBc were lower than those of the corresponding switched (IgG(+) IgA(+)) total (34%) and RV-mBc (17%), leading to an underestimate of their actual frequency. In order to evaluate the in vivo role of IgM(+) RV-mBc in antiviral immunity, NOD/Shi-scid interleukin-2 receptor-deficient (IL-2RŒ≥(null)) immunodeficient mice were adoptively transferred highly purified human IgM(+) mBc and infected with virulent murine rotavirus. These mice developed high titers of serum human RV-IgM and IgG and had significantly lower levels than control mice of both antigenemia and viremia. Finally, we determined that human RV-IgM(+) mBc are phenotypically diverse and significantly enriched in the IgM(hi) IgD(low) subset. Thus, RV-IgM(+) mBc are heterogeneous, occur more frequently than estimated by traditional limiting dilution analysis, have the capacity to switch Ig class in vitro as well as in vivo, and can mediate systemic antiviral immunity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.01466-12\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000308740700057\n\nView details for PubMedID 22855480\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3457288\n\nAbstract\n\nAntibodies that neutralize rotavirus infection target outer coat proteins VP4 and VP7 and inhibit viral entry. The structure of a VP7-Fab complex (S. T. Aoki, et al., Science 324:1444-1447, 2009) led us to reclassify epitopes into two binding regions at inter- and intrasubunit boundaries of the calcium-dependent trimer. It further led us to show that antibodies binding at the intersubunit boundary inhibit uncoating of the virion outer layer. We have now tested representative antibodies for each of the defined structural epitope regions and find that antibodies recognizing epitopes in either binding region neutralize by cross-linking VP7 trimers. Antibodies that bind at the intersubunit junction neutralize as monovalent Fabs, while those that bind at the intrasubunit region require divalency. The VP7 structure has also allowed us to design a disulfide cross-linked VP7 mutant which recoats double-layered particles (DLPs) as efficiently as does wild-type VP7 but which yields particles defective in cell entry as determined both by lack of infectivity and by loss of Œ±-sarcin toxicity in the presence of recoated particles. We conclude that dissociation of the VP7 trimer is an essential step in viral penetration into cells.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.00234-11\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000296254100008\n\nView details for PubMedID 21849465\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3187514\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring seasonal influenza epidemics, disease burden is shouldered predominantly by the very young and the elderly. Elderly individuals are particularly affected, in part because vaccine efficacy wanes with age. This has been linked to a reduced ability to induce a robust serum antibody response. Here, we show that this is due to reduced quantities of vaccine-specific antibodies, rather than a lack of antibody avidity or affinity. We measured levels of vaccine-specific plasmablasts by ELISPOT 1 week after immunization of young and elderly adults with inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAbs) were generated from bulk-cultured B cells, while recombinant monoclonal antibodies (re-mAbs) were produced from single plasmablasts. The frequency of vaccine-specific plasmablasts and the concentration of PPAbs were lower in the elderly than in young adults, whereas the yields of secreted IgG per plasmablast were not different. Differences were not detected in the overall vaccine-specific avidity or affinity of PPAbs and re-mAbs between the 2 age groups. In contrast, reactivity of the antibodies induced by the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine toward the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, which was not present in the vaccine, was higher in the elderly than in the young. These results indicate that the inferior antibody response to influenza vaccination in the elderly is primarily due to reduced quantities of vaccine-specific antibodies. They also suggest that exposure history affects the cross-reactivity of vaccination-induced antibodies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1172/JCI57834\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000293495500022\n\nView details for PubMedID 21785218\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3148747\n\nAbstract\n\nFour rotavirus SA11 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants and seven rotavirus RRV ts mutants, isolated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and not genetically characterized, were assigned to reassortment groups by pairwise crosses with the SA11 mutant group prototypes isolated and characterized at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). Among the NIH mutants, three of the RRV mutants and all four SA11 mutants contained mutations in single reassortment groups, and four RRV mutants contained mutations in multiple groups. One NIH mutant [RRVtsK(2)] identified the previously undefined 11th reassortment group (K) expected for rotavirus. Three NIH single mutant RRV viruses, RRVtsD(7), RRVtsJ(5), and RRVtsK(2), were in reassortment groups not previously mapped to genome segments. These mutants were mapped using classical genetic methods, including backcrosses to demonstrate reversion or suppression in reassortants with incongruent genotype and temperature phenotype. Once located to specific genome segments by genetic means, the mutations responsible for the ts phenotype were identified by sequencing. The reassortment group K mutant RRVtsK(2) maps to genome segment 9 and has a Thr280Ileu mutation in the capsid surface glycoprotein VP7. The group D mutant RRVtsD(7) maps to segment 5 and has a Leu140Val mutation in the nonstructural interferon (IFN) antagonist protein NSP1. The group J mutant RRVtsJ(5) maps to segment 11 and has an Ala182Gly mutation affecting only the NSP5 open reading frame. Rotavirus ts mutation groups are now mapped to 9 of the 11 rotavirus genome segments.

We now find that both rotavirus strains trigger antiviral transcriptional responses early during infection and that both transcriptional responses and IFN-Œ≤ secretion are completely abrogated in MAVS/IPS-1(-/-) MEFs. Replication of UK virus could be rescued in MAVS/IPS-1(-/-) MEFs, and synthesis of viral RNA significantly increased early during virus infection. UK virus induced IFN-Œ≤ secretion and transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both RIG-I(-/-) and MDA-5(-/-) MEFs, and neither receptor was essential by itself for the antiviral response to UK rotavirus. However, when receptors RIG-I and MDA-5 were depleted using RNA interference, we found that both contribute to the magnitude of the IFN response. IRF3 was found to be essential for MAVS/IPS-1-directed ISG transcription and IFN-Œ≤ secretion during rotavirus infection. Interestingly, absence of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR led to a profound defect in the capacity of host cells to secrete IFN-Œ≤ in response to virus. Both PKR and IRF3 restricted the early replication of UK as indicated by significant increases in viral RNA in fibroblasts lacking either gene. Despite the loss in IFN-Œ≤ secretion in PKR(-/-) MEFs, we did not observe decreased IRF3- or NF-Œ∫B-dependent early ISG transcription in these cells. Levels of transcripts encoding IFN-Œ±4, IFN-Œ±5, and IFN-Œ≤ were high in infected PKR(-/-) MEFs, indicating that during rotavirus infection, PKR functions at a stage between IFN gene transcription and subsequent IFN-Œ≤ secretion. These findings reveal that activation of the antiviral response by rotavirus is dependent on MAVS/IPS-1 and IRF3 and involves both RIG-I and MDA-5 and that IFN-Œ≤ secretion during rotavirus infection is regulated by PKR.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.02634-10\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000288536100003\n\nView details for PubMedID 21307186\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3126121\n\nAbstract\n\nRotavirus (RV) cell entry is an incompletely understood process, involving VP4 and VP7, the viral proteins composing the outermost layer of the nonenveloped RV triple-layered icosahedral particle (TLP), encasing VP6. VP4 can exist in three conformational states: soluble, cleaved spike, and folded back. In order to better understand the events leading to RV entry, we established a detection system to image input virus by m"
