        "text": "Update 2: an absolutely fabulous interactive map made by parent Beth Day (@thebethocracy on Twitter - she covers Board meetings and is fun to read).\n\nend of update\n\nUpdate 1: Mea culpa, I did indeed get Decatur and Thornton Creek mixed up. Thanks to all for the correction.\n\nend of update\n\nI suspect some who read this post will be irate. Why do this? Because the district seems very hellbent on this effort with no oversight skid marks from the Board.\n\nTo clearly state - I do not believe that closing 20 schools is a good idea. I think they hit on 20 because they thought it might bring in the most savings. But the jury is still out on the savings because the district has not shown its work nor its data. I suspect closing schools and THEN leasing/renting them is the big plan but that means the district really has to keep the buildings up.\n\nBut this district, with its happy talk about \"well-resourced schools\" is NOT acknowledging the pain and yes, grief, that is to come from closing schools. A school is a living organism to those who attend and those who work there. A neighborhood school is an anchor in any area and a closure is troubling.\n\nUpdate added here - In the above paragraph I talk about why closing a school is so hard on its community. Long-time employees, neighbors whose kids went to the school, parents who love the school. But those who feel it most are the student, the children who love their school community. For some schools they will not move as a group - the boundaries will be redrawn to sent some kids to one consolidation school, other kids to another consolidation school.\n\nFrom my own experience in the last Closure&Consolidation, one thing parents should advocate for is that some personnel from the closed building HAVE to be in the new building. If a kid sees a familiar face - the lunch person, the custodian, front office staff - it can make that transition easier. Of course, this may happen anyway as the district will go with whatever the contract is for that group of staff and usually, it's seniority. So you might see some teachers at the consolidated school get bumped out by teachers with seniority at the closed school. Even a principal.\n\nend of update\n\nBefore I dive in, I do want to point out a couple of areas where the district could save money but I have heard zero about these options.\n\n1) The district has non-school land/buildings they could sell like Oak Tree shopping center; it's available in two years. Also Leschi Elementary had a house donated to its use. Why keep that?\n\n2) Charge the City for use of Pre-K space. When this all came about, many of us asked why the district wouldn't charge for space, even a minimal charge. This program has expanded in all directions which is a good thing but SPS needs to find money where they can. The City can do the right thing.\n\nElementary School Review\n\nThere are 29 schools with fewer than 300 students.\n\nThere are 7 schools between 300-325.\n\nIt is not clear if K-8s are part of the closures but I suspect so. And, looking at the numbers, many of them are struggling with enrollment. The district has always been mostly lukewarm on K-8s.\n\nFor some reason, the School Description Dashboard, where I would find current enrollment numbers, is not working. I found current enrollment numbers at OSPI.\n\nHere's the Facilities Master Plan from 2021 for building conditions.\n\nIt's a bit stunning to see on page 27 of the FMP how all the elementary buildings are classified as \"essential.\" This in 2021.\n\nOn page 31 they list sites that SPS leases. I knew about Center School and the capital projects warehouse not \"counseling office space at Lutheran Church\"? I suspect many of Interagency's sites are leased.\n\nCheck out page 20 \"5-Year Growth of K-12 residents per elementary attendance area,\" updated in 2021.\n\nThe elementary buildings with the worst conditions:\n\n1) Sacajawea\n\n2) View Ridge\n\n3) North Beach\n\n4) Wedgwood\n\n5) Salmon Bay at Monroe Building*\n\n6) Catherine Blaine K-8*\n\n7) Lowell\n\n8) Green Lake (renovated?)\n\n9) Sanislo\n\n10) Decatur (renovated)\n\n11) Dearborn Park\n\n12) Beacon Hill\n\n13) Maple\n\n14) Bailey Gatzert\n\n15) McGilvra\n\n16) Sand Point\n\n17) Laurelhurst\n\n18) Graham Hill\n\n19) B.F. Day\n\n20) Broadview Thomson*\n\n21) Lafayette\n\n22) Louisa Boren*\n\n23) Rainier View\n\n24) John Stanford\n\n*K-8\n\nOn page 42-44, there is Appendix E: 2020 School Capacity Charts; it's amazing to see how many elementaries were overenrolled in 2021. To note, MANY of these elementaries have \"right-sized capacity\" between 300-350. This idea of larger buildings is a relatively new one for the district but they seem to have quietly made this decision that elementaries should be bigger long before this point in time.\n\nI made these groupings of schools. Feel free to disagree with me. The number after the name of the school is current enrollment. If you find numerical errors, please do point them out.\n\nNorth NE\n\nI suspect Cedar Park and Sacajawea may be closed. Frankly, many of us didn't think Cedar Park should have been reopened because it was going to be so small but yes, the district spent those capital dollars.\n\nOlympic Hills 486, capacity 520 - A very new building that was built for more students so it's not going to close. Looks like its capacity is 520 so maybe 50 more kids in this building.\n\nThey are also rebuilding John Rogers (188) so between the two of those schools, they can take in many students. My guess would be closing Cedar Park (272) and Sacajawea (229).\n\nTo note, John Rogers (188) is slated to reopen in Fall 2025. I'm surprised but the district's info says it is only being built to hold 500 students.\n\nOn Sacajawea, the district has paid for a design to replace the current building.\n\nOlympic View 357 - Capacity 396. So room for about 40 students.\n\nJames Baldwin 233 - brand new larger building with capacity of 650, could take in K-5 from Broadview Thomson K-8. The two buildings are just under 2 miles apart.\n\nHazel Wolf K-8 732, capacity 658 - newer building, popular school\n\nSouth NE\n\nBetween Laurelhurst and Sand Point, the most underenrolled schools in the region in poor quality buildings, they have 488 students. Wedgwood and View Ridge have 240 extra seats. I'm not sure what they can do here. Portables?\n\nBryant 484 - a generally good school that is popular, updated in 2001. Its capacity is listed at 462 so a rarity here, it's overenrolled.\n\nThornton Creek 455, capacity 660 - Also popular but it's an HCC school.It's an option school. . What will be its eventual fate? Newly updated during BEX IV.\n\nDecatur 188, capacity 286. They could just move these students into Thornton Creek.\n\nWedgwood 355, capacity 478 -building updated in 2023\n\nView Ridge 283 - capacity 400.\n\nLaurelhurst 275, capacity 369, bad building\n\nSand Point - 213, capacity 276, bad building\n\nCentral\n\nHard to tell what they will do here as most of the buildings are over 300 students. Maybe they could move Green Lake to Bagley. But I can't see closing any school here besides that one.\n\nGreen Lake 323 - They have an oldish building BUT they house very specific Special Education services with accompanying equipment.\n\nDaniel Bagley 317 - Low number but a new building for 500 students. Used to have a very popular Montessori program.\n\nMcDonald 475, capacity 471 - a good school but popular for dual language program. It's unclear where that program is headed.\n\nJohn Stanford International School 417, capacity 418- Best enrollment numbers for any international elementary school.\n\nWest Woodland 380, capacity stated as 396 but now much larger - rebuilt in 1991, added 12(!) classrooms in 2021\n\nCascadia 489 - Will stay as HC cohort school but not adding any first graders. Very unclear to me what will happen to this school when this year's first graders leave as fifth graders. (Oddly, Cascadia is not on the district's 2023-2024 Elementary School Attendance Areas map.)\n\nB.F. Day 414 - Another surprise as they are over capacity with listed capacity of 352. Oldest elementary school in the district.\n\nNorth NW\n\nI think they might choose to close Broadview Thomson.\n\nBroadview Thomson K-8 566, capacity 612. I don't see a good future for this school nor most of the K-8s.\n\nViewlands 267- new building that will be filled either with Broadview Thomson or North Beach 367, capacity 438. I can't seem to find the new capacity for Viewlands but it's at least 550. The distance from Viewlands to North Beach is just under 2 miles.\n\nGreenwood 325, capacity 345 - a nice building but a school that has never really been especially popular nor full.\n\nWest NW\n\nClose Licton Springs K-8 and move those K-5 students to Adams. The district may close Salmon Bay and move those K-5 students to fill Loyal Heights and Whitter.\n\nAdams 303, capacity 396\n\nLicton Springs K-8 119 - in an updated building but low numbers. Has been on staff's list for years. You can only wonder if the district had ever truly supported this school, what those numbers would be like.\n\nSalmon Bay K-8 635 - I am hearing from parents here that say the district is underenrolling it. Has been a popular school despite an old building.\n\nLoyal Heights 534 - brand new building for 660 students\n\nWhittier 342, capacity 440- a steady, popular school in a good building.\n\nCentral East\n\nMove McGilvra to Montlake. Move Madrona to Stevens (or vice versa depending on building conditions - these are about 2 miles apart)\n\nMontlake 168- being rebuilt to capacity of 500\n\nSo upsetting to me. Folks, 20+ years ago, it was a VERY different story for Montlake as well as McGilvra. Facilities folks told me - and said this publicly - that both had two of the smallest land areas and simply could never be rebuilt bigger. Fast forward to now and look at what is happening to Montlake. A big school on a small footprint, more students but less playground space.\n\nI suspect either McGilvra 216, capacity 278, or Stevens 152, capacity 283, will move into Montlake. Probably McGilvra as its building is in the worst condition.\n\nLowell 389, capacity 352 is the closest elementary to downtown to the east.\n\nMadrona 218, capacity 390\n\nTOPS K-8 473, capacity 437; another rarity of overenrollment\n\nCentral West\n\nClose Blaine and send most of those K-5 students to Coe and close John Hay and move those students to Queen Anne Elementary.\n\nLawton 325, capacity 396\n\nBlaine K-8 441, capacity 595 (but this is an old building)\n\nMagnolia 441- newly renovated for 460\n\nCoe 447- added 6 classrooms in 2021\n\nQueen Anne Elementary 215 - renovated to fit 500 students in last BEX.\n\nJohn Hay 268\n\nI want to note past history here as well. Those Queen Anne schools used to be packed. When QA Elementary opened, they had a fabulous principal and it was very popular. But district decisions led to some of this decline.\n\nSW North\n\nSo I am a bit baffled here unless the district is going to continue on the path of closing K-8s. In that case, they could move Pathfinder's K-5 students to both Genesee Hill and Fairmount Park. But who is going into Alki? Lafayette may have a bad building but it's full.\n\nAlki 271- being rebuilt to a larger size (500) despite zero parking.\n\nPathfinder K-8 450, capacity 459. Pathfinder rebuilt in 1999.\n\nGenesee Hill 482, capacity 594 (Thank you, Alert Reader)\n\nLafayette 505, capacity 497\n\nFairmount Park 392, capacity 516- new building\n\nGenessee Hill 482, capacity 664 - new building\n\nSW South\n\nWest Seattle could take in Sanislo; I suspect they may close Concord and send students to either Highland Park or Roxhill.\n\nBoren STEM K-8 458, capacity 555- popular and the only elementary STEM in the district. Some updates to the building but not totally renovated. I'd better if the district had bothered to fix this building up, they would be full.\n\nWest Seattle 389- updated in 2022\n\nGatewood 381, capacity 464\n\nSanislo 171\n\nRoxhill 272- renovated in 2018\n\nArbor Heights 514- newish building\n\nHighland Park 285- rebuilt in 1999\n\nConcord International 285- renovated in 2000\n\nNorth SE\n\nContinuing on the path of closing K-8s, they may close Orca and send their K-5 students to almost any school in this region with space\n\nLeschi 295, capacity 324 - A two-story, four classroom addition in May 2022 \"relieves overcrowding.\"\n\nBailey Gatzert 363, capacity 336\n\nBeacon Hill International 349, capacity 407\n\nThurgood Marshall 469, capacity 543- houses an HC cohort - unclear to me if those HCC students will follow Cascadia's path to fifth grade. Rebuilt in 1991.\n\nKimball 415- opened new in 2023 with space for 650 students.\n\nJohn Muir 333, capacity 342- got a fairly recent update of 4 classrooms for Early Learning and childcare. They are not going to close this school.\n\nOrca K-8 357\n\nMaple 408, capacity 468\n\nHawthorne 375, capacity 351\n\nSouth SE\n\nClose Rainier View and those students go to Dunlap. I suspect they will close MLK, Jr and Graham Hill and those students would go to Wing Luke or Rising Star.\n\nI do want to remind readers that twice during the discussion around the Superintendent's Plan, Director Brandon Hersey said that some small schools are vital to \"students furthest from education justice.\" The vibe I get from Jones is that he wants to make the closures as equal throughout the region as possible.\n\nSo either Hersey was doing a CYA for his region or there may be some kind of fight over this region.\n\nDearborn Park International 328, capacity 354 - renovated in 2006\n\nGraham Hill 242, capacity 391- used to have a very popular Montessori program\n\nMLK, Jr 281, capacity 336\n\nWing Luke 315 - brand new building last BEX for 500 students\n\nRising Star 327, capacity 480\n\nDunlap 248, capacity 303 - renovated in 2000\n\nSouth Shore K-8 570, capacity 705 - the most extra-funded school in the district, it may end up being one of the few K-8s left standing.\n\nEmerson 323, capacity 360 - renovated in 2001\n\nRainier View 200, capacity 309"
