        "text": "Jessie M. DePriest ’09\n\nDow Chemical, Texas Hydrocarbons Site Integration Specialist and Feedstocks Planner\n\nWhy did you select Chemical Engineering? I’d done well and enjoyed both Chemistry and Math classes in high school, but I thought majoring in either subject in college would be too boring or take me down a career path I didn’t want. Engineering sounded like a nice mixture of the two and chemical engineering was the only engineering discipline that sounded interesting.\n\nWhat was your experience at Louisiana Tech like? The Chemical Engineering program gave me an immersive experience in what it was like to work in industry, although it took me years of working in the industry to fully appreciate what we were taught and how.\n\nHow has Louisiana Tech prepared you for industry and the workforce? The chemical engineering curriculum gave me a good foundation in working in teams, process safety, and practical application of chemical engineering concepts. I’ve worked with many graduates of prestigious engineering programs who did not receive such an education in their undergraduate studies.\n\nJohn Elmore ’07\n\nShell, Process Safety Manager\n\nWhy did you select Chemical Engineering? I was actually a Mechanical Engineering major in my first quarter, but my dad (who is a ChemE) convinced me to switch in the fall of 2003. I’ve never regretted the change!\n\nWhat was your experience at Louisiana Tech like? I loved (and still love) the Tech community. I had a real connection with not only my friends and classmates but also my professors; I’ll never forget some of the good times working on robotics with Dr. David Hall, playing guitar with Dr. Jim Nelson, or the tough but invaluable classes from Dr. Jim Palmer.\n\nHow has Louisiana Tech prepared you for industry and the workforce? Most importantly my Tech education was practical. I was taught how to think critically, approach problems, and care about developing myself and my skills. The team experiences and presentation practice I had couldn’t be replaced in getting me ready for my 12 years and counting in the petrochemical industry.\n\nHow has your experience at Louisiana Tech opened up opportunities for you? My Tech degree is competitive with any other engineering degrees I’ve worked with. A critical part of my Tech experience was working with people – in industry you never work on problems in a vacuum, so learning how to interact productively with others from different backgrounds and clearly articulate through writing and presenting has made all the difference in my career.\n\nJoel Mertens ’86\n\nInternational Paper at Campti, Louisiana, Fiberline Manufacturing Excellence Leader\n\nWhy did you select Chemical Engineering? I always enjoyed math and science. Also, I wanted to make sure I had a career where I could provide for my family, and my wife wouldn’t have to work unless she wanted to. Chemical Engineering gave me all of that and much more!\n\nWhat was your experience at Louisiana Tech like? My time at Louisiana Tech was great! I learned a lot, made a lot of friends, and had a lot of fun.\n\nHow has Louisiana Tech prepared you for industry and the workforce? Louisiana Tech prepared me well technically for my jobs in industry. The biggest thing Louisiana Tech taught me was how to think and how to solve problems.\n\nHow has your experience at Louisiana Tech opened up opportunities for you? I wouldn’t have had any of the job opportunities in my career without the education and degree that I received from Louisiana Tech."
