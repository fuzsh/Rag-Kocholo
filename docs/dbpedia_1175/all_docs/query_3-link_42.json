        "text": "THE DEPARTMENT NAMES THE 2025 TEACHER AND PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR STATE-LEVEL HONOREES\n\nThe Louisiana Department of Education recognizes that great teachers and school leaders are critical to student success. Annually, the Department, in partnership with Dream Teachers and the Louisiana Association of Principals, recognizes and celebrates some of the state’s most exceptional educators through the Teacher and Principal of the Year programs. These programs provide an opportunity to acknowledge those teachers and leaders who are making exceptional gains with students. Their commitment to student success exemplifies Louisiana’s education profession.\n\nThis year, school systems from all across the state submitted nominations to the state-level Teacher and Principal of the Year process. From this impressive group, the Department is proud to announce the 2025 Teacher and Principal of the Year State-Level Honorees.\n\nThe Louisiana Department of Education recognizes that great teachers and leaders are critical to student success. Annually the department, in partnership with Dream Teachers announces exemplary early childhood teachers and leaders. Eligible candidates are teachers or directors (leaders) in Type III Centers, CCAP Certified Family Child Care Sites, Head Start Centers, or Early Head Start Centers.\n\nThe Early Childhood Teacher and Leader of the Year application process for the 2023-2024 school year has closed. Honorees will be named in March of 2024 and the overall honorees will be named in July 2024. The Early Childhood Teacher and Leader of the Year nomination process for the 2024-2025 school year will open in August of 2024. All applications, materials, and the timelines will be updated and posted in the resources library by June 2024.\n\nAll communities and networks are encouraged to have at least one Early Childhood Teacher and one Early Childhood Leader to apply for the award.\n\nThe Louisiana Exemplary Educator Recognition Program was created to honor and elevate exceptional early- to mid-career teachers, teacher specialists, assistant principals and principals who exemplify Louisiana’s education profession. This program provides an opportunity to honor those educators who offer strong, long-range potential for professional and policy leadership.\n\nThis year, stakeholders across the state submitted recommendations for the 2024 Louisiana Exemplary Educator Recognition Program through a confidential process where the candidates were unaware of their recommendations. From this impressive group, the Department is proud to announce the 2024 Louisiana Exemplary Educators.\n\nIn acknowledgment of being named an Exemplary Educator, these individuals will receive a certificate of recognition, be honored during a Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) meeting and may be invited to participate on advisory boards and task forces. They will also be considered for other state and national recognition programs.\n\nU.S. Senate Youth Program\n\nTwo Louisiana juniors or seniors will be chosen to attend the 62nd annual U.S. Senate Youth Program in Washington D.C. during the week of March 2-9, 2024. Upon completion of all on-site events, these two delegates will each receive a $10,000 education scholarship. Juniors or seniors may qualify to apply through leadership positions they hold during the 2023-2024 school year per the USSYP official criteria for the current academic school year. All student leadership-qualifying positions are subject to the judgment of the state selection administrator and will be verified and confirmed. Students nominated by their principals must submit an application of required USSYP official criteria information to the Louisiana Department of Education by Tuesday, October 3, 2023 at 11:59 p.m..\n\nPlease read the national brochure and Louisiana logistics memo for more information including eligibility requirements and the application process. State finalists will be notified by Thursday, October 26, and delegates and alternates will be informed in mid-December of their selection.\n\nU.S. Presidential Scholars Program\n\nThe U.S. Presidential Scholars Program was established to recognize and honor some of our nation's most distinguished graduating high school students selected on the basis of outstanding scholarship. All high school seniors graduating between January and August 2024, who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents and who attend public, parochial, or independent schools, as well as those who are home-schooled, are eligible. School systems can submit, for LDOE consideration, up to two students in the General Component and up to two students in the Career and Technical Education (CTE) Component. The Department can nominate up to 10 males and 10 females AND up to five additional students for the CTE recognition component. To learn more about the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program and the Commission on Presidential Scholars, please visit http://www.ed.gov/psp.\n\nThis is a recognition program, not a scholarship program. The 2024 U.S. Presidential Scholars will be selected by the Commission on Presidential Scholars and receive the Presidential Scholars Medallion.\n\nIn order to recommend students for nomination to the program, school systems are required to submit to the LDOE a parental release form for each nominated student and complete a JotForm application for each student by 4 p.m. November 6, 2023. It is recommended that school systems review the LDOE evaluation rubric prior to nominating students.\n\nPlease contact jumpstart@la.gov with questions."
