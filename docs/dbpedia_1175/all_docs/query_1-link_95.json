        "text": "Tag: gender bias\n\nNo – #FFS – no – I will not speak at your meeting given the lack of diversity of speakers\n\nSo a few days ago I got asked to do a paid speaking engagement for a meeting\n\nDear Dr. Eisen,\n\nI hope this email finds you well!\n\nWe have a client that’s interested in you speaking at their Autoimmune Conference in New York on March 24, 2017.\n\nDo you have a standard speaking fee/range that I can report back to my client? If you’re able to confirm your availability as well, that would be great!\n\nThe audience would be primarily physicians.\n\nYour consideration is very much appreciated!\n\nSincerely,\n\nSounded nice – getting paid to go to New York. What could go wrong right?. Then I did some Googling to find out about the meeting. Found it – the Interdisciplinary Autoimmune Summit: http://joinias.com. And, as I do for all meeting invites these days, I looked at their speaker line up. For this years and previous years. And well, I was not impressed.\n\nA lot of men. Men men men and men. So I wrote back\n\nApologies for the delay. Was on the traveling science roadshow for a while.\n\nMy speaker fee depends on whether this is a for profit or non profit event, so I would need more details. In addition, I usually ask that all speaker fees get donated to my lab rather than paid to me.\n\nHowever, I have another requirement for speaking at a meeting. The meeting has to have a good representation of diversity for other speakers. Unfortunately, in looking at the 2016 faculty for this conference http://joinias.com/faculty I am distinctly unimpressed. In a quick glance I count 16 male and 3 female speakers for a ~ 15% female speaker level. In order to accept speaking at the 2017 meeting I would need to know more about the other speakers.\n\nSincerely\n\nJonathan Eisen\n\nI got a rapid response\n\nHi Jonathan,\n\nThank you so much for the email, I commend your notions on gender equity!\n\nThe summit seems to bring together a lot of knowledgeable and influential people — I will speak with my client and get some additional details for you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnd then a more detailed one\n\nHello Jonathan,\n\nThey are a for-profit company, HMP Communications Holdings (HMP). HMP is a global hub for healthcare – helping to educate, inform and connect the practitioner community. They do this through the delivery of:\n\n· High-quality, clinically relevant continuing medical education\n\n· Credible, cutting-edge content that informs and inspires\n\n· Live events and online networks that provide practical training and allow professionals to connect with one another\n\nIn regards to gender equality, their team are in the early stages of finalizing topics and reaching out to potential speakers for the IAS 2017 meeting, but can assure you that they’re always seeking to secure the best possible speakers and educators for their events, including folks from all demographics.\n\nThat being said, they would also be interested in any speaker recommendations you may have since they’re so early in the process and always looking to bring new speakers into the fold each year.\n\nThey are happy to address any other details or concerns you have.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nSo I wrote back again\n\nGiven the track record of this meeting, I am not sold with statements like “but can assure you that they’re always seeking to secure the best possible speakers and educators for their events, including folks from all demographics.” They certainly failed in this “all demographics” regard last year and as far as I can tell in previous years.\n\nI would only do this if there was evidence of results in increasing the diversity of speakers.\n\nAnd now the person who invited me is looking into it\n\nHi Jonathan,\n\nUnderstood — I will see what we can do.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSo that is where we stand now. I note. I am writing this up in part to encourage everyone out there to ask about the diversity of speakers for meetings for which you have been invited to speak or that you would like to attend or sponsor. Don’t just say “Yes’ without examining the meeting and the track record of the organizers. We need to take action to stop the underrepresentation of diversity of speakers at meetings.\n\nFor other posts on STEM Diversity see here. See the end of the post for links to articles about how it is possible and why it is important to have reasonable diversity of speakers at meetings.\n\nThe White Men’s Microbiome Congress #YAMMM #Manel #Boycott\n\nSo I got this email this morning inviting me to attend a conference: the Second Annual Human Microbiome Congress in San Diego. (also called the North American Microbiome Congress).\n\nAnd it struck me that all the featured speakers were men.\n\nGreat. So I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, hoping that maybe if I looked at the rest of the speakers it would be better.\n\nSo I had to register on some web site to download the full agenda for the meeting. And there were the featured speakers, rippling with diversity\n\nSo then I went to scroll through the document looking for the other speakers.\n\nOMFG – what a joke.\n\n27 speakers featured. 25 of them male. That comes to a whopping 93% male lineup. In a field where there are a massive number of well known, well regarded female researchers. What a f$&(#()@ joke. This meeting should be boycotted. I am going to write to all the speakers I know and ask them to cancel participating.\n\nUpdate 10/6 1 PM\n\nGot an email from a meeting representative asking me what I thought about the program. I guess I got this because of my signing up to get the program.\n\nAnd I wrote back\n\nI guess we will see where this goes.\n\nUpdate 10/6 1:10 PM\n\nI also have begin writing to people I know who are speaking at the meeting.\n\nI am hoping many of them cancel participating. I will update when I get more answers but so far the two people who have responded have now withdrawn from the meeting.\n\nUPDATE 10/11\n\nThe meeting organizers have responded and appear committed to improving / fixing their diversity issue. See comments here and also the meeting web site.\n\nThat’s the good news.\n\nNow the bad news. A commenter pointed me to the same Group’s European Microbiome Congress. It is a bit better than the US one but not much.\n\nI think this group needs to make a broader statement about diversity than just focusing on one meeting.\n\nFor other posts on STEM Diversity see here.\n\nYet another biased meeting from Oxford Global – their meetings should be shunned #YAMMM #GenderBias\n\nWell, Oxford Global has done it again. They have found a way to be one of the most extremely gender biased conferences around. Their 2016 Genome Editing Congress Speakers. Their web site lists 20 speakers, 19 of which are men. (One of the men is listed twice – I am not sure if that is due to giving two talks or a mistake. So this may be 19 speakers~ 95, 18 of which are men). Regardless that comes to ~ 95% male speakers.\n\nAndre Choulika, CEO Cellectis\n\nGuna Rajagopal, VP – Global Head, Computational Sciences, Discovery Sciences Janssen\n\nLorenz Mayr, VP & Global Head, Reagents & Assay Development Astrazeneca\n\nZheng-Yi Chen, Associate Professor Harvard Medical School\n\nDaniel Anderson, Associate Professor MIT\n\nMarcello Maresca, Associate Principal Scientist Astrazeneca\n\nJohn Doench, Director; Associate Director, Genetic Perturbation Platform Broad Institute\n\nChad Cowan, Associate Professor Harvard\n\nPablo Perez Pinera, Associate Professor University of Illinois\n\nJim Collins, Professor MIT\n\nChannabasavaiah Gurumurthy, Director, Transgenic Core Facility University of Nebraska Medical School\n\nDanilo Maddalo, Senior Scientist and Lab Head Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research\n\nRodolphe Barrangou, Associate Professor North Carolina State University\n\nStephanie Mohr, DRSC Director Harvard Medical School\n\nRobert Howes, Associate Director MedImmune\n\nChannabasavaiah Gurumurthy, Director, Transgenic Core Facility University of Nebraska Medical Center\n\nJames Carothers, Assistant Professor University of Washington\n\nWilliam Theodorus Hendriks, Instructor in Neurology Harvard Medical School\n\nMark Osborn, Assistant Professor University of Minnesota\n\nJeff Chamberlain, Professor University of Washington\n\n1 and 19 were counted at Genome Editing USA Congress #OxfordGlobal.

See for example Oxford Global Sequencing Meetings: Where MEN Tell You About Sequencing #YAMMM and also Time to boycott Oxford Global meetings due to blatant sexism\n\nReally – we need as a community to stand up to these types of meetings. Oxford Global meetings should be boycotted. And the companies that sponsor their meetings are complicit in their gender bias.\n\n———————————————\n\nUPDATE 10/2 12:56 PM – decided to look at another one of their meetings that is linked from this one\n\n2nd Annual Next Generation Sequencing USA Congress\n\n3-4 October 2016, Boston, USA\n\n83 % male speakers.

I made a Storify about it here:\n\nFor other posts on STEM Diversity see here.\n\nNo thanks Precision Medicine #PMWC2017 – I don’t want to go to your $&*@(#@( #manel #yammm #biased meeting\n\nToday I got this email, ostensibly from Keith Yamamoto, who I have interacted with a bit over the years, including in the writing of the NAS “New Biology” report.\n\nSo I decided to check out the meeting site. Precision Medicine World Conference. Hosted by Stanford and UCSF and Duke and Others. And also a “manel”. Also known as a YAMMM (yet another mostly male meeting). A festival in fact of men. So so so many men listed as speakers. Here is my round up.\n\nJust so sick of meetings like this. Apparently Keith Yamamoto and UCSF and Duke and Stanford and all the Sponsors endorse having a meeting where about 1 in 6 of the speakers are women. No thanks. Not interested. I am sure they can all make a litany of excuses. But I am so tired of hearing them. In the end the only way to get some of these groups to change their practices is to boycott their meetings. And to publicly discuss, with the sponsors and speakers and organizers, why their meeting is not OK.\n\nUPDATE 1 – Some responses and discussion on Twitter\n\nCongratulations SynbioBeta #SBBSF16 – you are having a #YAMMMy #manel\n\nWell this is disappointing.\n\nSomeone sent me an announcement for SynBioBeta SF 2016 – SynBioBeta possibly thinking I would go to it. Since it was local I decided to check it out. And, well, the 1st thing I did was to look at the gender balance of the speakers (as much as I could infer from a quick skim). And it did not look good. So I dug into it in more detail.\n\nThey have a speaker page and I went through most of them to make sure my inference of gender was correct (based on looking at the pronouns used to describe them in their speaker bio and also in other web sites). I know this is imperfect but seems potentially a decent estimator. And low an behold when you sum it all up you get 79% male speakers vs. 21% female speakers. They could definitely do better.\n\nAgilent – where men are thought leaders\n\nWell this is disappointing. Was googling for a person and found this Agilent “Thought Leaders Program“. It is described as\n\nThis invitational program promotes fundamental scientific advancements by contributing financial support, products and expertise to the research of influential thought leaders in the life sciences, diagnostics, and chemical analysis.\n\nAlas it might be described better as “Agilent Male Thought Leaders Program”. In my estimation (based on the pronouns used in the descriptions of the people and in Googling around for more information), of the 31 “thought leaders” 28 are male. That comes to a bit more than 90%. It seems like there is some sort of bias here. Agilent should and could do better.\n\nUC Davis Storer Lecture series – since 1963 87% of speakers are male\n\nI wrote this blog post a while ago but never published it partly out of fear for upsetting some of my colleagues. I try to be brave about such things, but I guess I just did not quite get up the poxy. Well, today something came up that stimulated me to write the post.\n\nI got an email announcement for a talk that seems potentially quite interesting. The problem is not the talk. The problem is with the endowed Lectureship that this talk is connected to. So here is the post I have worked on on and off over the last year or more.\n\nUC Davis has an endowed lecture series- the Storer Lectureship in the Life Sciences. It has been running since the 1960s and is a relatively big deal on campus here. The speakers come in, usually give one or two talks (one for the public and one for researchers). They usually have a big dinner (I have gone to a few of these) and the speakers get a decent honorarium (a few thousand dollars) and some sort of gift.\n\nMost years I have been here, I have received a request from the organizers for suggested speakers and every once in a while I have made suggestions, some of which have even led to invitations. Recently, I had suggested a famous colleague who is also a UC Davis alum. Alas, she could not come. The organizers asked if I had any other suggestions and I sent them a list of a few candidates who are both very good, well known and do something related to microbes. The organizers really liked one of the suggestions and asked if I would be willing to invite this person.\n\nSo I started drafting a letter. And as part of drafting a letter I wanted to give examples of past speakers to show how great a set of speakers we had for this series. So I Googled “Storer” and\n\nUC Davis” or something like that and got to the page:\n\nStorer Lectureship in the Life Sciences\n\nAnd that is when I got a bit heartbroken. The speakers have been, well, very male. I note I spent a while looking at descriptions of each speaker that I did not know to try and determine their gender, looking at their web sites if available, or how they were described (e.g., what pronouns were used). I am pretty confident in the assignments though I realize this is an error prone approach. Here is the full list as far as I have put together with the males labelled in yellow and females in green.\n\nOct 5-16, 1963 Ernest W. Caspari University of Rochester Oct 17-31, 1966 Vincent G.

Ugh.\n\nAnd the person I had suggested to invite was male. So I wrote back to the organizers and I wrote:\n\nFrom: Jonathan Eisen\n\nSent: Thursday, June 11, 2015 11:34 AM\n\nTo: XXXCc: XXX\n\nSubject: Abyssmal gender ratio of speakers in the Storer Lectureship series\n\nXXX and XXXX\n\nWith sincere apologies but …\n\nIn preparing a letter of invitation for XXX I decided to include some examples of previous Storer Lecturers. And therein lies the problem On the web sitehttp://www.dbs.ucdavis.edu/seminars_and_events/storer_lecture_list.htmlfrom my count, there are 121 past speakers listed. Of these, 15 appear to be female (from my estimate). That comes to 12%. That is embarassaingly low. I hope my calculations here are wrong.\n\nCan you tell me if the Storer Lectureship has any policies regarding diversity of speakers? If yes, can you provide me with those details.\n\nIf no, I recommend you implement one as soon as possible. Either way, I refuse to have my name affiliated with this series, and will not invite anyone to talk in it, without further information and without some serious attempt to figure out how to do a better job representing the diversity of biologists who could give such talks.\n\nJonathan\n\nThey wrote back with a very detailed response and were very supportive of the concept of increasing diversity of speakers. And they explained some of the efforts they had made in this regard. And they really seem to be trying in some ways. But in the end, their main justification for the lack of diversity was that they were trying to invite already recognized, in essence famous, biologists. People who had won a Nobel or were in the National Academy of Sciences or were HHMI investigators. And this pool, that they had chosen, was skewed in gender balance.\n\nSo I wrote back to them June 18:\n\nAll\n\nThanks very much for the response.\n\nI understand you have some constraints and greatly appreciate that you are committed to trying to improve the diversity of speakers. However, the end result is truly not acceptible in my mind and therefore I believe more needs to be done, urgently, to improve the situation.\n\nWhat are some possible ways to improve the situation?\n\nWell, the number one recommendation I would make would be to not constrain the pool to honorific groups that themselves have severe skews. No we cannot solve those skews and there are many causes for them. But I believe it is a major mistake to use the diversity of those groups (NAS, Nobel, HHMI) as a target. Either invite people to represent diversity well even from a constrained pool, or, open up to a broader pool (there are plenty of incredible scientists who have not gotten HHMI, NAS, or Nobels).\n\nIn addition to opening up the pool and not aiming at such a low bar, there are many things one can do to improve the diversity of speakers. I have written about this extensively as have many others. I can point the committee to some of these articles if interested.\n\nIn the end, whatever the reasons are, the Storer series has ended up with extremely biased gender ratio of speakers. I think it is up to the committee to fix this with a combination of actions. But the first thing I would recommend is to not use the diversity of a set of pools you have chosen as an excuse. We can and should do better and if the pools are the reason, the pools from which you sample need to be changed.\n\nJonathan\n\nThey wrote back, saying they were really committed to achieving better gender balance in the future writing “we are totally committed to the same goals as you in terms of gender balance now and in the future.” And they also wrote that they expected “the final lineup to reflect at least 30 percent or more female” as long as one additional woman (the person I had originally recommended) would come (though I had told them she said she could not). And then they asked if I would reconsider inviting the man who I had been about to invite that had started this whole discussion.\n\nSo I wrote back again July 14:\n\nThanks again for the response. And though I do not want to continue beating a dead horse, I am not convinced we are doing enough in this area. For example, what explains the “at least 30 percent” and how close to 30% will that be. This is important as, for example, the National Science Foundation will not support their people attending meetings if female speakers are at < 33%. I think 30% is, to be honest, just not acceptable in biology. So beofre contributing any more to this series I need to know exactly what is meant by \"we are totally committed to the same goals as you in terms of gender balance now and in the future.”\n\nFor example, here are some questions I would like to know the answers to:\n\nAre you committed to achieving gender balance in the speaker series or just saying you are being more even than before?\n\nAre you committed to researching and using diverse options to ensure diversity of speakers beyond just focusing on who is invited?\n\nAre you interested in understanding why the series has been so undiverse in the past and addressing this directly or just moving forward?\n\nAre you willing to address the lack of diversity in the past publicly and also discuss efforts to improve the diversity?\n\nI would very much like to know more detail about how serious you are to having a diverse series and what you plan to do to achieve this.\n\nWith apologies, but in regard to inviting XXX or XXX. I am sorry but given the past record of this series, which as I said is among the worst I have seen anywhere, I am just not willing to be involved in any way until I see a stronger and more public committment to diversity.\n\nI am happy to help with the series and to help improve the diversity of speakers. But this should be done openly and publicly and forcefully. And without evidence of this, I am unable and unwilling to be involved.\n\nAnd, well, I have not heard from them again. So, I am writing this. For many reasons. But a key one is, I think we need to be more public about such issues. And we just need to fix things that are broken.\n\nSo today I decided to make the post live. I wish I had done this earlier.\n\nSome responses\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fjonathaneisen%2Fposts%2F10154012819435767&width=500\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences – where men choose men to be cheered\n\nSo – I saw multiple posts by colleagues on Facebook and Twitter about gender skew in the newly elected members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
