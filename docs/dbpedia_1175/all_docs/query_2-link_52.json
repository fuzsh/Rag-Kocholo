        "text": "The Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, has announced that Paul Dans, the top official behind the 900-page conservative manifesto known as Project 2025, is stepping down.\n\nBut this staffing change doesn’t mean that the vision to overhaul the federal government laid out in the far-reaching blueprint is ending.\n\nFor one, Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, has made plain that the project’s work will go on.\n\n“When we began Project 2025 in April 2022, we set a timeline for the project to conclude its policy drafting after the two party conventions this year, and we are sticking to that timeline,” he said in a statement. “Project 2025 will continue our efforts to build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels — federal, state, and local. I look forward to leading this team to continued success.”\n\nRead More: ‘Project 2025’ and the Movement That Could Erode Black Equality\n\nAdditionally, to attach too much significance to Dans’ removal — which comes as former President Donald Trump’s campaign seeks to distance itself from Project 2025 — is to overlook the fact that elements of the blueprint have already been implemented.\n\n“Much of what’s in Project 2025 has already been rolled out as an attack on and a justification for undermining social justice and equity-based policies. You can start with the executive order that Trump signed around the time he said to the Proud Boys to stand by,” Kimberlé Crenshaw, a law professor at Columbia University and the University of California, Los Angeles, recently told Capital B.\n\nThat executive order, explained Crenshaw, a pioneering scholar of critical race theory and the co-founder and executive director of the African American Policy Forum think tank, contained some of Project 2025’s key assumptions: “the idea that equity constitutes reverse discrimination, the idea that diversity training and various other tools are un-American, the idea that equity is a zero-sum game.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers and conservative activists have sought to turn these assumptions into policy with fresh determination in the year since the U.S. Supreme Court gutted affirmative action in higher education and invited a more expansive assault on efforts to confront our country’s ongoing history of racial inequality.\n\nThese actors have targeted everything from Black-owned businesses to racially equitable voting maps to medical school diversity recruitment programs, as Capital B previously reported.\n\nArguably, Project 2025 and the convoluted network of players who intentionally or not abet it — GOP elected officials, Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices, the anti-affirmative action crusader Edward Blum, the Federalist Society — illuminate how the conservative movement operates.\n\nIt’s diffuse just enough that someone can claim plausible deniability. They can deflect heat and responsibility, as Trump has been doing in recent months when it comes to Project 2025, even though at least 140 of his closest associates developed it, per a CNN review, and his running mate, U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, has deep ties to Roberts at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nOr someone can signal, more obliquely, for another party to take up the baton, as Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas did via a major 2021 voting rights case. Their concurring opinion was essentially a call for conservative groups to challenge a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act, Melissa Murray, a law professor at New York University, told Capital B last year.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a co-founder of a congressional task force created to combat Project 2025, is urging Americans to keep their eye on the ball. Dans has stepped down, but that doesn’t mean that the manifesto’s threat has evaporated, or that Trump is off the hook.\n\n“Make no mistake: Project 2025 is Donald Trump’s blueprint to enact widespread harm, impacting everyone who calls America home,” she said in a statement. “It was written by Trump allies for a future Trump presidency, and the resignation of its director doesn’t change the fact that it is Trump’s agenda.”"
