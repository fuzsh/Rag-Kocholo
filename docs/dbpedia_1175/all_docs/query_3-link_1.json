        "text": "The Graduate Faculty consists of those members of the teaching and research faculties who have been so designated by the President, upon recommendation of the Graduate Council acting on appropriate nominations. Such designations provide for classification as Members, Associate Members, or Affiliate Members (Research or Professional), according to their qualifications and experience. (The term, “Member,” when capitalized, denotes a Full Member of the Graduate Faculty.)\n\nFaculty members who hold the rank of adjunct professor, adjunct associate professor or adjunct assistant professor in a department offering work for graduate credit are eligible for graduate faculty status as Full Members or Associate Members, depending upon their qualifications.\n\nThe purpose of the Professional Affiliate is to assist with teaching responsibilities within professional Masters degree programs. Thus, all Professional Affiliate Members must demonstrate a knowledge in and practice of the teaching discipline.\n\nThe purpose of the Research Affiliate is to enhance the research expertise within the LSU A&M campus. Thus, all Research Affiliate Members must demonstrate research at the level expected of new Assistant Professors on a tenure-track line."
