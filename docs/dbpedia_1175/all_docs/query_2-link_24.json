        "text": "Instructional Coach\n\nMathematics\n\nI love working with students, teachers, administrators and parents to provide the best learning experience for our students. I have a passion for supporting, coaching and learning with teachers.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI'm originally from Houston TX, but have lived in Illinois, Nebraska, Louisiana, Kansas and now Colorado. I have 2 boys, one lives in Austin, TX and the other lives in Alexandria VA. I also have two grandsons who live in Alexandria VA. My husband is a College Professor teaching Geology currently at the University of Kansas. His job has moved us around a lot and as a result my career spans working in k12 education as a teacher and instructional coach and in university administration as a Dean of Students at the University of Nebraska, an Assistant Dean of Students at Louisiana State University, a Director of Education an Outreach at the University of Kansas, and as a Student Development Coordinator at Southern Illinois University.\n\nEducation"
