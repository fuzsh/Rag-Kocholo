An aurora looks like a beautiful display of lights in the sky. We can also see auroras from space! The name of an aurora changes depending on its location. If you’re in the northern hemisphere, it is called aurora borealis, or northern lights, and if you’re in the southern hemisphere, then it is called aurora australis, or southern lights.
