        "text": "Early risers in Tasmania started the work week with a spectacular aurora, with some seasoned southern lights watchers calling it the best display they have ever seen.\n\nProfessional photography gear or a middle-of-the-night wake-up were not necessary, with many people seeing the pink and green hues lighting up the skies when they rose for work.\n\nThe lights were easily visible to the naked eye from about 5:15am onwards.\n\nPeople who shared photos online said they were taken simply using their smartphones.\n\n\"This morning's display made me think I'm still asleep, dreaming. The colours were so vivid and bright — they were, in my son's words, 'Beautiful, magic sky colours,'\" said Toby Schrapel, who saw the aurora from Judbury in Tasmania's Huon Valley.\n\nAt Midway Point near Hobart, Carmel Gledhill, said she took photos from her driveway using her phone before heading down to the water.\n\n\"My husband woke me up at 5:15am and said very casually, 'Look at this',\" she said.\n\n\"I was in a panic, looking for my professional camera and tripod getting dressed and out the door as quick as I could.\n\n\"My husband and I raced to the water — me dressed and my husband still in his dressing gown.\n\n\"We were so fascinated by the colours and pulses coming out of the sky. My heart is still racing from all the excitement.\"\n\nRobbie Moles took photos from Bellerive, on Hobart's eastern shores.\n\n\"I could see it quite clearly coming down the Brooker Highway over the street lights.\n\n\"But, as I got to Bellerive, I was mesmerised.\n\n\"Strong reds and some purples. Beams looking straight up and it lasted for a while.\n\n\"Huge beams visible on the kunanyi/Mt Wellington webcam too. Definitely the best display I've seen by far.\"\n\nMissed this display? Try tomorrow\n\nBureau of Meteorology meteorologist Luke Johnston said an aurora could occur at any time, but the later timing of this one meant \"it wasn't too difficult for people to get out of bed and look at it\".\n\nMr Johnston said another aurora was likely tomorrow morning.\n\nHe said clear conditions were expected, particularly in southern Tasmania.\n\n\"We may start to get some high-level cloud drifting over on Tuesday, but it doesn't look too terrible,\" he said."
