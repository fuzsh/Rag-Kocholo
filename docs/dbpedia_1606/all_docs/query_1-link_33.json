        "text": "Southern Aurora, Howden, Tasmania\n\nIn northern latitudes, the effect of an aurora is well known. It is given the name aurora borealis (or the northern lights), after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas, by Pierre Gassendi in 1621. The northern lights have had a number of names throughout history. The Cree call this phenomenon the \"Dance of the Spirits\". In Europe, in the Middle Ages, the auroras were commonly believed a sign from God.\n\nLesser known is its southern counterpart, the aurora australis (or the southern lights), which has almost identical features to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone. The aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, South America, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nTasmania, King Island and Southern Victoria are the most likely places to see aurora. However, on August 24, 2005 there was a massive auroral storm seen as far as Armidale in northern NSW. Naturally, the best views of any aurora will be away from the city and bright lights.\n\nObservers in Tasmania are likely to see green glows or sheets of light in the southern sky. Observers in Southern Victoria are more likely to see a red glow in the southern sky, although more spectacular displays are possible.\n\nAurora will generally follow solar flares by about 2 days, and a number of instruments are watching the sun for these outbursts. The solar miniumin occured in 2006 and persisted for some time. While sunspot numbers, and hence flare rates are increasing, sometimes months will go by without an alert, then you have three in a week.\n\nSouthern Aurora seen from Mt Wellington.
