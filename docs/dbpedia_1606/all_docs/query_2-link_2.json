        "text": "Have you ever seen the dazzling, dancing lights of the aurora in the night sky? The closer you are to the North or South Pole, the greater your chances are of seeing this amazing spectacle. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is called an aurora borealis or the northern lights. In the Southern Hemisphere, it is called an aurora australis or the southern lights.\n\nWhat Causes the Aurora?\n\nAuroras are a natural interaction between the Sun and Earth's atmosphere. Our Sun generates a strong solar wind, which carries about one million tons of extremely hot plasma (electrons, protons, and other particles) away from the Sun every second. Earth’s magnetosphere acts like a shield that protects us from most of this constant solar wind, deflecting it around Earth.\n\nDuring a solar storm, such as a solar flare or coronal mass ejection, a large amount of plasma hurls through space at high speeds as part of the solar wind. When this extra solar energy collides with Earth’s magnetosphere, some of the electrically charged particles move down strong magnetic field lines at the North and South Poles and become trapped in Earth's atmosphere. These particles bounce from the North Pole to the South Pole and back again, transferring energy to molecules in Earth’s atmosphere as they go. The colorful, glowing lights of the aurora result when these energized molecules release their extra energy.\n\nWhy Are Auroras Different Colors?\n\nAuroras occur within one of Earth’s upper atmosphere layers, the thermosphere. Solar particles trapped here interact with different types of gas molecules, mostly nitrogen and oxygen, resulting in unique, colored displays of light. Oxygen gives off green and red light, while nitrogen glows blue and reddish-purple. Green-colored auroras are most frequent, resulting from interactions with oxygen molecules at lower altitudes (between 100-300 km or 62-180 mi), while the less commonly occurring red auroras form from interactions with higher altitude (above 300 km or 180 mi) oxygen molecules.\n\nDo Auroras Affect Earth?\n\nAuroras have delighted and inspired curiosity in humans throughout time. The only significant impact to Earth associated with auroras is a possible disruption of radio communications as charged particles from the Sun create a disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field. When the magnetic disturbance is particularly strong, auroras can sometimes be seen farther from the poles, in mid-latitude locations.\n\nOther Planets Have Auroras, Too!\n\nEarth isn’t the only planet that experiences auroras. Any planet with an atmosphere and a magnetic field is likely to have auroras. Spectacular auroras have been observed on Saturn and Jupiter."
