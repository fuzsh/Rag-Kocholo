        "text": "If you're looking for a breathtaking, once-in-a-lifetime experience, then seeing the Southern Lights in New Zealand should be at the top of your bucket list. Just like it's more well-known equivalent in the northern hemisphere (the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis), the Aurora Australis is a natural light display caused by the collision of charged particles with the Earth's magnetic field. New Zealand is one of the best places in the world to see this majestic phenomenon, but what conditions are needed, and when is the best time to go?\n\nSeeing the Southern Lights can involve a little luck - it's a natural phenomenon after all and can be a little unpredictable, just like the weather! But there are locations in New Zealand known to put on spectacular aurora displays when conditions are right, so travelling to the right place, at the right time of year, can maximise your chances of seeing the southern lights for yourself.\n\nWhen is the best time of year to see the Southern Lights in New Zealand?\n\nWhere in New Zealand can you see the Southern Lights?\n\nPeak Aurora activity predicted in 2023-2025\n\n1. The best time of year to see the Southern Lights in New Zealand\n\nThe best time to see the Southern Lights, also known as the Aurora Australis, in New Zealand is during the autumn & winter months of March until September, when the nights are longest and darkest. However, aurora sightings can occur throughout the year, especially during periods of high solar activity. During the equinoxes in March and September, the chance of the aurora being bright is at its maximum thanks to a phenomenon called the Russell-McPherron effect - so you'll notice our Southern Lights by Flight tours are timed to coincide with these dates!\n\n2. Where in New Zealand can you see the Southern Lights?\n\nTo increase your chances of seeing the Aurora Australis, it is important to find a location that is far away from light pollution and has a clear view of the southern horizon. The best places in New Zealand to view the Aurora are in the south, particularly in areas like Stewart Island, the Catlins and the Southern Alps. Another great viewing spot is the Dark Sky Reserve at Lake Tekapo where astronomical experts at the world-renowned Mt John Observatory will educate you on the night sky, as you gaze through telescopes.\n\nStewart Island is the southernmost Dark Sky Sanctuary in the world, and therefore is a fantastic place to spot the Southern Lights. Our small group tour is great to hunt auroras and take amazing astrophotography. Another plus is that you will be one of the few people to see the famous kiwi birds in the wild.\n\n> Read more: Stewart Island Aurora Hunting: Small Group Tour\n\nIn addition to finding a good viewing location, it is important to keep an eye on the weather conditions. Clear skies are necessary for a good viewing experience, so it is best to check the weather forecast and choose a night when there is little or no cloud cover.\n\n3. Peak aurora activity predicted for 2023-2025\n\nAs the aurora australis is a result of solar activity, the intensity of the southern lights follows the 11-year solar cycle of geomagnetic storms. According to NASA's predictions, the next peak of solar activity is expected in 2023-2025, so now is a great time to plan a trip to see the southern lights!\n\nDuring this time, there may be an increase in auroral activity, and the lights may be visible at lower latitudes than usual. You will be able to witness this awe-inspiring and unforgettable experience where the lights appear as ribbons or curtains of shimmering, colorful light that dance across the sky in a natural light show. The colors can vary from green to red to purple, and the lights can move and change shape rapidly or slowly."
