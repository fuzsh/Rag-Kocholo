        "text": "The dancing lights in the night sky are often associated with the Aurora Borealis, but the Aurora Australis, or Southern Lights in the Southern Hemisphere are as brilliant. Auroras in general are the natural phenomenon that occurs when the sun and Earthâs atmosphere interact.\n\nThe Earthâs magnetic field disperses the electrons, protons, and other particles projected by the sun, transferring energy between the two poles and creating a stunning light show with captivating shades of green, blue, purple, and red.\n\nThe best way to view the Southern Lights is to travel away from areas with high light pollution, such as large cities and metropolitan spaces.\n\nWhen traveling below the equatorial line, the closer to the Antarctic Circle in winter, from May to August, the better your chances of viewing the natural light show.\n\nMaking sure you have found a spot free of mountain ranges and clear of trees along the horizon will create better viewing conditions. Traveling to one of the most prominent areas in which to view the Southern Lights will also increase your likelihood of spotting the colors in the night sky.\n\nQueenstown, New Zealand\n\nQueenstown in New Zealand is not just for adventure sports and alpine thrills. The vibrant town is one of the most popular destinations for viewing the Southern Lights because of its access to viewing spots away from the light population and mountain peaks. The colors reflect in the waters of Lake Wakatipu and wash the surface in a rainbow of light.\n\nTasmania, Australia\n\nThe small Australian state of Tasmania has several spots from which to view the Southern Lights, including Bruny Islandâs secluded lighthouse approximately 30 minutes from the islandâs capital city and the top of Mount Wellington, where the higher you travel up the 4,100-foot-tall peak, the more likely you are to have an unobstructed view.\n\nSouth Georgia Island\n\nGetting to South Georgia Island is not easy, but those who travel to one of the worldâs most southerly landmasses at the right time of year are not only rewarded with a unique view of an island encased in ice, but can also find a panoramic view of the Southern Lights.\n\nThat said, no tourist ships travel to this part of the world in winter because of the harsh weather conditions. Scientific research ships are the only way to reach South Georgia Island when the Southern Lights are active.\n\nPatagonia\n\nThe wild and alluring landscape that crosses southern Chile and Argentina hosts exciting displays of the Southern Lights from May to July. As a world-class adventure destination, Patagonia offers an opportunity far from the light pollution of large cities. While the plains are better for viewing the wide expanse of dancing lights without obstruction, few things will compare to witnessing the movement of light over the granite towers of Tierra del Fuego.\n\nThe Falkland Islands\n\nDuring the dark months between April and August, the Falkland Islands become a haven for witnessing the brilliant colors and twisting moves of the Southern Lights. The small group of islands approximately 400 miles from the Argentine coast offers a landscape free of light pollution and supports thriving penguin, elephant seal, and orca populations. The combination of wilderness and remoteness adds to the unforgettable ambiance."
