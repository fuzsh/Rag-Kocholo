Learn more about the meaning, origin, and popularity of the name Aurora.\n\nFact checked by Elizabeth BrownfieldFact checked by Elizabeth Brownfield\n\nAurora is a mystical, romantic name that means \"dawn\" in Latin. An aurora also refers to a natural light display in the Earth's sky called the aurora polaris, or polar lights, which are visible only in high-latitude regions like the North and South Poles. The aurora borealis (the northern lights) and the aurora australis (the southern lights) paint the sky in a dazzling array of colors.\n\nAurora was the Roman goddess of the dawn. Helios, the sun god, and Selene, the moon goddess, were her brother and sister. Aurora rode across the sky each morning before her brother, Helios rode across with the sun. As she rode, she sprinkled dew over the land.\n\nAurora had several children. Some of them were the winds Boreas, Eurus, Notus, and Zephyrus. She also gave birth to the morning star Eosphorus and the evening star Hesperus.\n\nWalt Disney named the protagonist of its 1959 film Sleeping Beauty Aurora. In the original tale that Disney adapted, however, the princess gave birth to two children, naming the girl Aurora (or Dawn, depending on the translation) and the boy Day.\n\nOrigin: The name Aurora is of Latin origin and it is used in the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Romanian, and Finnish languages.\n\nGender: Aurora is historically a feminine noun, having personified an ancient Roman goddess.
