        "text": "Does Antarctica have Northern Lights?\n\nThis is a question I get asked a lot since I lived at the South Pole, Antarctica for a year.\n\nWhile we did see auroras regularly at the bottom of the world, they are not called the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis.\n\nDoes Antarctica Have Northern Lights?\n\nAntarctica doesn’t have Northern Lights, but it does have Southern Lights– also called Aurora Australis.\n\nAlthough many people mistakenly use the term “Northern Lights” to describe all auroras, the names for auroras in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are not the same.\n\nAntarctica Northern Lights VS Southern Lights\n\nSo why aren’t “Antarctica Northern Lights” a thing?\n\nBecause Antarctica is in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nAuroras in the Southern Hemisphere are referred to as the Southern Lights, or Aurora Australis.\n\nThe auroras seen in the Northern Hemisphere in places like Alaska or Finland are called the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis.\n\nRemember: arctic means north, and antarctic means the opposite (south).\n\nGet Your FREE eBook Now!\n\nBy providing your details, you consent to receiving our emails. Unsubscribe any time.\n\nWhen To See The Southern Lights In Antarctica\n\nThe Southern Lights (Aurora Australis) can be seen in Antarctica during the austral winter.\n\nThis is between February and October when the continent experiences its months-long winter.\n\nAt the South Pole, the southernmost point on Earth, there’s no sunlight for six months.\n\nThis is the best time to see the Southern Lights in Antarctica.\n\nDuring the austral summer, the sun is up 24/7 so there’s no darkness to observe any Antarctica auroras.\n\nHow To See The Aurora Australis (Southern Lights)\n\nWant to check out the Aurora Australis?\n\nThe good news is that you don’t have to go all the way to Antarctica to see the Southern Lights!\n\n💡 TIP: You’ll want to be as far away as possible from any light pollution (city lights, headlights, etc.) for the best aurora views\n\nWhere to See the Southern Lights (Besides Antarctica)\n\nWhile generally the farther south you go, the better the Aurora Australis gets, you can still get a glimpse of the beautiful lights at the following destinations:\n\n🇦🇷 Ushuaia, Argentina\n\nUshuaia, known as the world’s southernmost city, is one of the best places to witness the Southern Lights.\n\nLocated at the southernmost tip of South America, it’s the closest point to Antarctica that anyone can be, which makes it a prime Aurora Australis viewpoint.\n\n🇦🇺 Tasmania, Australia\n\nTasmania, Australia is another fantastic location to catch the lights due to its southern latitude and clear, dark skies.\n\nSouth Arm Peninsula and Satellite Island are popular spots for stargazing and astrophotography, making it perfect for seeing auroras as well.\n\n🇳🇿 Stewart Island, New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand’s Stewart Island is located south of the South Island, and is actually the southernmost Dark Sky Sanctuary in the world.\n\nIn fact, the Maori name for the island, Rakiura, means “glowing skies”– a nod to the Aurora Australis visible here.\n\nAurora Australis: What to Expect\n\nWhile seeing the Aurora Australis is indeed exciting, it’s important to keep expectations realistic as what you usually see in person is typically NOT the same as in photographs.\n\nVibrancy\n\nWhen you think of seeing auroras, you probably think of bright green lights in the sky.\n\nWhile this is sometimes true, most often what you’ll see with the naked eye are faint yellow or green cloud-like shapes.\n\nThe reason you’ve seen vivid photos of the Aurora Australis or Aurora Borealis is because photographers are able to take long-exposure shots for more vibrant images.\n\nDoes this mean you won’t get good photos with just a smartphone?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nIt just depends on how strong the auroras are.\n\nJust know that what you’ll see in person will most likely not be the same as in photos.\n\nLocation\n\nIf you’re aurora hunting at the southern tips of South America or Australia, note that they’ll be close to the horizon, not overhead.\n\nOnly in Antarctica will the Aurora Australis be up high in the sky.\n\nLikelihood of Seeing the Auroras\n\nIn order for auroras to be visible, you need low light pollution and clear skies.\n\nJust because the aurora forecasts say there’s a high likelihood of aurora activity, it won’t matter if the weather isn’t cooperating or you’re in an area with a lot of lights.\n\nWhere to See the Southern Lights (Antarctica)\n\nThere are two options for seeing the Southern Lights in Antarctica: through a sightseeing flight or by working at the Antarctic research stations.\n\nSouthern Lights Sightseeing Flights\n\nChimu Adventures and Antarctica Flights are the only companies that offer this exclusive winter sightseeing trip.\n\nWhile you get to set foot on the continent, you will have the rare opportunity to view the Aurora Australis from the sky.\n\nBest Antarctic Stations for Aurora Australis\n\nSince the Aurora Australis forms an “aurora ring” over the magnetic South Pole, the best places in Antarctica to view the lights fall under this perimeter.\n\nThese include the following stations:\n\n🇺🇸 Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station\n\n🇦🇷 Belgrano II Base\n\n🇯🇵 Showa Station\n\nWork in Antarctica\n\nIf you’re dying to see the Aurora Australis, or Southern Lights, in Antarctica you’ll need to get a job in Antarctica.\n\nWorking in Antarctica not only pays you to live there– but it’s the only way to see the Southern Lights in Antarctica while on the continent.\n\nTourist cruises can’t access Antarctica during the dark winter months, and the aurora flights can’t land on the continent or even get close (they only fly to the perimeter of the Antarctic Circle).\n\nBy getting a job at an Antarctic research station, you have the rare opportunity to experience life in Antarctica that no money can buy at the moment.\n\n💡 TIP: Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station is the best station for viewing the Aurora Australis (Southern Lights) because the aurora circle goes directly over the top.\n\nWhat it’s Like Working in Antarctica\n\nI’ve had the opportunity to work two seasons at McMurdo Station and three seasons at the South Pole Station, the last two of which were part of a full-year residency.\n\nTo sum up what it’s like working in Antarctica: it’s hard work, you’ll often be cold, but it’s an experience of a lifetime.\n\nRead More: How I Got Paid to Live in Antarctica\n\nSummer vs. Winter\n\nWorking at an Antarctic research station during the summer is usually the busiest as personnel are often coming and going.\n\nAt McMurdo Station, the population can top out at 1000+ people in the austral summer months (October-February).\n\nThis is the time when most of the research, construction improvements, and resupply happen as it’s the warmest time of the year.\n\nMost stations hunker down during winter as it’s typically too cold to fly.\n\nA skeleton crew sticks around to continue projects but life runs a little slower after the summer population leaves.\n\nThe isolation and darkness often lead to Winterover Syndrome, which is a constellation of behavioral disturbances seen in polar winterover crew.\n\nThis includes absentmindedness, irritability, and depression.\n\nSpending a winter in Antarctica, however, is often a goal for many who go down to the ice (Antarctica), and we carry the “Winterover” title with great pride.\n\nWintering at the South Pole— and being the first woman of Japanese heritage to do so– was definitely a crowning achievement for me.\n\nCruise to Antarctica\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to visit Antarctica as a tourist, taking a cruise is probably your best option.\n\nThere are a variety of cruise lines and excursion operators that offer trips to the White Continent.\n\nHere are some of the most popular Antarctica cruises broken down by category:\n\n⚓️ Luxury: Silversea Cruises\n\n⚓️ Expedition: Lindblad Expeditions\n\n⚓️ Budget: Princess Cruises\n\nVisiting Antarctica: FAQs\n\nStill have some burning questions?\n\nThis next section covers some frequently asked questions about Antarctica.\n\nWhat causes the Aurora Australis in Antarctica?\n\nAuroras are are caused by energized particles from the sun interacting with gasses in the atmosphere.\n\nThe lights occur around the magnetic North and South Poles, which is why you’re more likely to see auroras the farther north or south you are.\n\nWhat are the Northern Lights called in Antarctica?\n\nThe auroras in Antarctica are called the Southern Lights, or Aurora Australis.\n\nThe reason why they’re not called the Northern Lights is because Antarctica is in the Southern Hemisphere, thus the Southern Lights.\n\nThe Northern Lights are auroras in the Northern Hemisphere in areas such as Alaska and the Arctic.\n\nDoes it ever get dark in Antarctica?\n\nYes, Antarctica does experience darkness.\n\nThe length of darkness, however, will depend on where in Antarctica you are located.\n\nAreas above the Antarctic Circle (66° South) experience day and night like most of the world.\n\nBut below the Antarctic Circle there are polar nights, which are the extended periods without daylight.\n\nThe further south you go, the longer the darkness lasts.\n\nFor example, McMurdo Station at Ross Island is located at 77° South and experiences the polar night between April through August.\n\nAt the South Pole (90° South), there is no sun between March and September.\n\nAre there polar bears in Antarctica?\n\nNo, there are no polar bears in Antarctica.\n\nYou’re probably thinking of the Arctic.\n\nAnimals that do live in Antarctica, however, include:\n\nSeals\n\nWhales\n\nSkua birds\n\nPenguins\n\nFinal Thoughts: Antarctica Northern & Southern Lights\n\nAntarctica doesn’t have Northern Lights, but it does have Southern Lights.\n\nThe auroras seen in the Southern Hemisphere where Antarctica is located are correspondingly known as the Southern Lights.\n\nSo the next time you hear someone talk about the “Antarctica Northern Lights,” you’ll know they’re probably referring to the Aurora Australis."
