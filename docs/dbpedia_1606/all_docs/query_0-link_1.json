        "text": "The magnificent light shows, Aurora Australis and Aurora Borealis, are atmospheric phenomenon found near the north and south poles. Unlike the Northern Lights, the Southern Lights are a little more inaccessible and where you choose to view them might depend on how adventurous you're feeling—but the rewards might be far greater.\n\nWhat Is The Difference Between The Southern And Northern Lights?\n\nThe difference between the Southern and the Northern Lights is not just in a name. The Southern Lights, unsurprisingly, can be found in the Southern hemisphere and are called the Aurora Australis. Conversely, the Northern Lights are found in the Northern hemisphere and are called the Aurora Borealis.\n\nThe colors of the lights are also a little different. In the Northern hemisphere the colors are more often green and white, although pink, purple, blues and reds are seen. In the Southern hemisphere, green and pink are really common, with a little blue, red and purple.\n\nThe Lights were given their name in the 17th century, derived from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and in the Northern hemisphere from the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. In the Southern hemisphere, Captain James Cook named them Aurora Australis from the Latin word for southern, during his voyage to the Antarctic in the late 17th century.\n\nFor centuries, no one knew how the lights were created and they were often mystical creations, harbingers of doom and became part of the stories that were passed down by both Aboriginal and Native Indian communities—archaeologists believe there are even cave drawings representing the Lights.\n\nWhat Causes The Southern and Northern Lights?\n\nAs videos from NASA show and explain, a wide range of things actually need to happen in one place to ensure you see the light shows—you need a solar wind of charged particles from the sun, a planet with a magnetic field and an atmosphere that contains oxygen and nitrogen, combined with perfect timing and people in exactly the right place to see it.\n\nThese light shows start life on the surface of the sun. During solar storms, particles become electrically charged and if they make it into our planet's magnetic field, they create the colors as they bump into atoms on the Earth's surface.\n\nThe different colors relate to the different gases found in the atmosphere—green is characteristic of oxygen, although high altitude oxygen can also give off a red color. Blue light can be caused by nitrogen and the purple and pinks are from the mix of the two.\n\nThe Lights move like curtains, often very quickly, in vertical directions, sometimes thousands of miles above the Earth's surface and sometimes possibly just 80 miles above.\n\nAurorae have also been captured on other planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\n\nWhen Can You See The Southern Lights?\n\nThe easy answer is all-year-round, but they will be seen more during Winter (May to August) and during the Spring Equinox (September). As expected, the same is true for the Northern hemisphere when the Northern Lights will be more likely seen in Winter between October and April.\n\nPerfect skies for seeing both sets of lights are clear, cloudless and dark. Some light shows last for up to three hours and are most often seen during the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.\n\nWhere Can You See The Southern Lights?\n\nThe Southern Lights occur mostly over the Southern Ocean and parts of Antarctica. However, during very intense solar activity you can see the Southern Lights over Tasmania and in southern mainland Australia, although they have been seen as far north as southern Queensland.\n\nSo, how can you see the Southern Lights? Adventurers can visit Stewart Island in New Zealand and watch the show at the Rakiura National Park—meaning Glowing Skies in Maori. Even more adventurous travelers could visit South Georgia Island in Antartica but you would need a hardy boat and to get there before the waters becomes inaccessible. Others travelers choose to chance a sighting from the deck of a passing cruise ship but there are no guarantees.\n\nThe Northern Lights are sometimes more well-known by travelers, mostly because they can be seen from more, easier-to-reach places—Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Russia and Norway. There is simply less land mass to see the Aurora Australis from, but that does mean that you might run into fewer people too.\n\nDo You Need Special Equipment In Order To See The Lights?\n\nYou don't need any special equipment to see the Aurora in either hemisphere but some people do pay attention to the levels of geomagnetic activity, monitoring professional sites, such as that of the Australian Space Weather Forecasting Service.\n\nIf you're a keen photographer, you'll need a tripod and a camera that has a manual mode and ideally a long exposure setting, as it takes more light into the lens."
