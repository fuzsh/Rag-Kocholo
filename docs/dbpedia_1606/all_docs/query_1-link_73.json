        "text": "Other than one occurring in the Northern hemisphere and the other in the Southern hemisphere, they also differ in appearances (because of the viewing location, they actually look the same if you see them from the same angle), as you can see in the photos above. Northern lights tend to have those wavy rows of lights (if you are watching almost directly under it, due to the Earth’s tilt angle and your far north location). Southern lights are more commonly seen as a wall of light curtains / pillars due to the angle and distance: eg. Observers in New Zealand are looking at the side angle of the aurora (unless you are in Antarctica, right under the Southern lights, then you would see the wavy rows of lights).\n\nAs for the colors, Northern lights tend to be predominantly in green and white, while Southern lights display more colorful hues, predominantly green and pink. This is also due to the angle where the aurora is seen by the observer. The colors are the result of the reactions of different dominant atoms in Earth’s atmosphere when they are hit by solar wind’s electrons. One thing that these auroras share in common, is that Northern and Southern lights activities occur at the same time, as the earth’s north and south magnetic fields are connected together (conditions and level may vary).\n\nIn other words, you look up at Northern lights and see it from the bottom, thanks to the land being right under it; In the southern hemisphere, the land is further away from the pole / aurora so you look at the Southern lights ‘across the ocean’.\n\nSeasons\n\nAurora can happen anytime. It does not happen more in the winter than during the summer. The reason winter months are seen as the best time to watch aurora, is due to the longer dark hours. Aurora can happen during the day, but you can’t see it with the sun’s out. In short, the winter months give you more dark hours, increasing the chances of aurora happening during the dark. This doesn’t mean you should stop looking out for aurora in the summer. If you get an aurora alert at night, go for it!\n\nMonths\n\nHistorically, auroras appeared more in the months of March-April and September-October. Records show that geomagnetic disturbances are more likely in spring and fall then winter and summer. This is due to the Russell-McPherron Effect, where cracks tend to form in Earth’s magnetosphere during weeks around equinoxes (when the Earth’s equator is facing directly to the Sun), allowing solar wind to spark the aurora lights.\n\nDays\n\nTalking about the dark sky, the moonlight is a huge factor on whether you can see the aurora or not. A full moon can easily drown out most lights from the aurora and the galaxies, making moonless nights the favorite night outs for astronomy photographers. However, even on the full moon night, you might still get hours of complete dark sky, since the moon rises and sets at a different time each day.\n\nHours\n\nThe best hours to see the aurora are obviously during the darkest hours. Astronomical twilight is when the sun is gone (below the horizon) but some of its lights are being scattered and bounced back to an observer on the surface. If you take a nighttime photograph during this twilight zone, the photo might show colorful lights, which many people have often mistaken as aurora (it is actually the light from the hidden sun). Thus, the darkest hours (without considering the moon) are after the evening astronomical twilight ends, and before the morning astronomical twilight begins.\n\nThanks to a passion project, ‘Outside, Looking Up’, developed by Oli Gibbs, we can easily know the exact time of sunset, moonrise, start/end of darkest hours and more useful info in our location, when we plan for our aurora chasing, or even night sky photography trips!\n\nCMEs happen spontaneously, and we cannot predict these solar activities. Since it takes around 2-4 days for the storm to reach the Earth after the ejection occurs, that would be the furthest time ahead we could predict aurora. However, it does not guarantee an aurora display, due to many variations of the reactions between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic fields. The storm may be a direct hit to Earth (even that doesn’t guarantee an aurora), a sideswipe (might create weak aurora), or a complete miss (no aurora). Speed and density of the solar wind, Interplanetary Magnetic Field, Hemispheric Power are some other factors that determine the occurrence of aurora, which we’re not gonna touch in this post, but it shows the level of uncertainty to predict aurora.\n\nSo yeah, you can’t be asking “Will there be an aurora on my vacation in New Zealand next couple weeks?” Nope nopey nope.\n\nArrival of a CME is observed in real-time using data from satellites. It is indicated by a sudden spike in total magnetic field (Bt), Bz, density, and speed all at the same time. This is due to the CME being denser, faster, and more magnetically complex than the background space environment.\n\nMoreover, another way to judge when a CME is on the way is by looking at the low energy protons observed. Low energy protons will often travel out ahead of a CME shock. If we are expecting to see a CME in the next 24 hours or less, we can look for a climb in the low energy protons that are arriving before the shock and then a sudden spike minutes before the shock hits. However, this could also be caused by solar flares (which on their own do not cause aurora), making it tricky to decipher a CME shock.\n\nAnyway, looking for those four components to suddenly spike is a great start when looking for a CME arrival. Glendale App is probably the most accurate aurora app used by many determined aurora chasers. The app also sends you alerts when there are active storms happening. However, as you can see from the bombardment of data displaying in the app, it can get very complicated and overwhelming. Luckily, we have…\n\nYou may have wondered, with all these complications, how would I know if tonight’s a good time to go aurora hunting? Thankfully, Aurora Australis (NZ) Facebook Page is the place to find out! As you can see from the discussion posts, Les Ladbrook, one of the admins and a professional astrophotographer and aurora enthusiast, consistently posts updates regarding aurora activities.\n\nAlmost every evening, he will update about the current condition and put his insights and forecasts based on the various data he observed in Glendale App and other sources. He translates all the complicated data into easy to understand comments. And thanks to him, I managed to capture the aurora successfully multiple times! Also, members in the group will often post the aurora photos right away when they see it, so that’s when you’ll know the lightshow is on.\n\nDo look around the Guides and Featured section of the page, there are many informative guides and tips on forecasting and photographing aurora. I will only touch a little bit on photography below.\n\nFirstly, select the pro mode of your camera (most devices have this option, if not you can download apps like Samsung Expert RAW). You should be able to see different camera settings on the pro mode interface.\n\nSecondly, set the photos to be saved in both RAW and JPEG format. RAW allows more lossless details which you can process/edit later. The RAW photos may look noisy or blurry on your screen but you can later process them (using apps like Snapseed) into clean JPEG images.\n\nNext, set the ISO value to a higher value, somewhere between 1600-3200. This controls camera light sensitivity. Higher values allow aurora colors to be captured by the lens, but setting it too high can result in noisy photos.\n\nThen, set the shutter speed / exposure time, trying somewhere between 15 to 35 seconds. Longer exposure allows more light in. A tripod or something to fix the camera is very important, as any little movement will turn the photo blurry. Also note that aurora ‘moves’, a shorter exposure may capture the interesting pillar lights of the aurora, while a longer exposure will turn it into a flat curtain of lights. You should play around the setting between ISO and shutter speed to find the right balance.\n\nFurthermore, set the focus to max (far), the best option in general for phone astrophotography. You should also try auto focus for comparison.\n\nMoreover, set an appropriate white balance (WB) to represent a true-to-life color range. Or, you can leave it at auto and adjust in editing later. I usually find 4300-4800K work best for me.\n\nLast but not least, set a timer to prevent the camera from capturing the movement when you press the capture button. With the timer, you have a few seconds to let go of the camera in a stable position and let it do its thing.\n\nOn a side note, iPhone users could try their night mode function of the camera. Some managed to take pretty good handheld shots of the aurora using that, while some don’t.\n\nHappy Hunting, Space Cowboy!"
