        "text": "Aurora had never been photographed in New Caledonia, the French island territory in the South Pacific. At least not until May 11, 2024 (May 10 US time) when the above photo of the Southern Lights (aurora australis) was taken from the town of Bouloparis by photographer Frédéric Desmoulins.\n\n\"I could see the red color of the auroras with my naked eye,” Desmoulins told SpaceWeather. “According to the New Caledonian Astronomy Society, these photos are the first for this territory.\"\n\nHe was one of countless people seeing the strongest solar storm in at least two decades from surprisingly varied locations around the world where the spectacle is rarely observed.\n\nThe aurora borealis is the scientific name for the Northern Lights, and its southern sibling is known as the aurora australis or Southern Lights. Both are the products of charged particles from the sun impacting Earth’s magnetic field and being funneled toward the poles where the field is weaker. The closer you are to the poles, the more frequently aurora are visible. Conversely, the closer you are to the equator, the stronger a solar storm (or more scientifically, a geomagnetic storm) needs to be for aurora to be visible.\n\nForbesTo See The Northern Lights Aurora This Weekend, Use Your Phone Camera\n\nThis means we can get a sense of the strongest geomagnetic storms throughout history by tracing accounts of aurora sightings near the equator. This is particularly valuable because the technology we use to measure such storms with more precision have only been available for a few decades.\n\nScientists have long referred to similar stories of lower latitude aurora sightings in the 1800s to place the 1859 Carrington Event and lesser-known but comparable events in 1872 and 1921 in the annals of epic solar storms from the industrial era.\n\nLast week’s New Caledonia sighting puts this month’s storm as the most widely-viewed (in terms of variance in latitude) since 1958. That’s according to researcher Hisashi Hayakawa at Japan's Nagoya University.\n\nHe said the sighting places the naked-eye visibility of the event below 30 degrees of magnetic latitude, which qualifies the May 10th storm for the designation of “Great Storm.”\n\nIt also means that aurora were seen closer to the equator this time around than during even the strong solar storm of 1989 that caused blackouts in Quebec and infrastructure damage elsewhere.\n\nThere were fewer than ten Great Storms in the 20th Century, and we’ve just seen the first of the 21st Century. This doesn’t mean we can’t see the next very soon though. Note that the Carrington Event and another superstorm in 1872 are separated by only 13 years. Great Storms were also observed in consecutive years in 1958 and 1959."
