        "text": "WHY ARE AURORAE IMPORTANT?\n\nInterest in aurorae is manyfold. It ranges from a casual interest in observing the beauty of the spectacle to a problem of system interference that has strategic security implications. Some of these are listed below.\n\nThe Magnificent Aurora\n\nThe emotion that the aurora brings forth in many people is perhaps best expressed by a quote from Donald G Carpenter (USAF Academy) in \"Environmental Space Sciences\":\n\nThe awe-inspiring shimmering aurora is a splashing of radiant colors on the TV screen of our atmosphere. It is part of a cosmic display conceived by God, produced by the Sun, directed by Earth's magnetic field, starring plasma fluxes and released photons, and with makeup by atomic de-ionizations and de-excitation. It is one of the classic beauties of nature, and fortunately its \"run\" will not be limited to a single season.\n\nHistorical Aurora\n\nThe reaction of various peoples in history to auroral displays has depended largely on where they lived. Those people who live near the auroral zones and see frequent aurorae tend to regard it as a benign or even beneficial event. Some Canadian eskimos believed that the aurora was the dance of the animal spirits. In Scandanavian folklore an aurora was thought to enhance the fertility of the Earth, with a promise of an abundance of seeds and a rich harvest, or a large fish catch from the ocean. Chinese and Japanese myths associated it with fertility, and even today Japanese honeymooners travel to Alaska in the belief that a child conceived under the aurora will prosper and be blessed with good luck. Some Alaskan motels are happy to oblige with bedrooms with glass ceilings. On the other hand, in societies where the aurora is only seen infrequently, it has often been seen as a bad omen, particularly as aurorae seen at lower latitudes (closer to the equator) are most often present as red glows. A spectacular aurora seen over middle Europe in 1570 brought forth the following admonition:\n\nWherefore, dear Christians, take such terrible portents to heart and digilently pray to God, that He will soften His punishments and bring us back into His favor, so that we may await with calm the future of our souls and salvation. Amen.\n\nThe drawing below was made of the same aurora, from what is now the west of the Czech Republic.\n\nAURORAL COLOURS\n\nWhen particles precipitate down from the magnetosphere into the auroral zone they encounter ever increasing density of air molecules. Eventually they will strike one of these molecules, transferring energy to it, and leaving it in an \"excited\" state. It only remains in this state for a short while. The excess energy is disposed of by emitting a particle or photon of light. The wavelength, and hence the colour of the emitted light is determined both by the type of air molecule, and the amount of energy it is given in the collision.\n\nUp to an altitude of about 100 km, the Earth's atmosphere is homogeneous, consisting of about 20% oxygen molecules (two atoms of oxygen joined together) and 80% nitrogen molecules (also two atoms of nitrogen joined together). Above 100 km oxygen molecules start to 'dissociate' and so we tend to find increasing concentration of individual oxygen atoms. Even higher, above about 500 km we start to find significant numbers of hydrogen atoms (these come from the Sun rather than the Earth's lower atmosphere).\n\nAlthough most aurora are formed in the altitude range between about 100 and 300 km, sometimes the precipitating particles have energies high enough to penetrate down to 70 km, and in some conditions very high altitude aurorae can form up to around 600 km.\n\nNear the auroral zones green is the most common colour seen in auroral displays. Green aurora tend to occur at altitudes from 100  250 km by oxygen atoms emitting light at 557.7 nanometres. Red aurora are less common and form around 200  500 km from oxygen atoms emitting light at 630 nm. These are often the aurora seen at mid-latitudes following large solar outbursts.\n\nWhen particles are energetic enough to penetrate down to altitudes below 100 km, blue aurora may be seen, and this is produced by nitrogen molecules emitting light at 423.6 and 427.8 nm. Converse to this in altitude, a rare high altitude form of red aurora around 600 km is due to hydrogen atoms emitting light at the hydrogen-alpha wavelength of 656.3 nm.\n\nThe most common auroral colours,\n\nthe elements that produce them, and\n\ntheir wavelengths (nanometres).\n\nOnly nitrogen is in its molecular\n\nform, all the other elements are in\n\natomic form.\n\nOccasionally a yellow colour may be seen in bright aurora. This is due to a combination of red and green auroral emission.\n\nMost faint aurorae show no color to the eye at all, appearing only as white forms. This is not because the aurora is not coloured, but because of how the eye perceives low intensity light. In the retina, the light sensitive part of the eye, on the back wall of the eyeball, there are two types of light sensors: rods and cones. The cones are concentrated near the central field of vision and are used to give high resolution seeing under moderate to high light levels. The rods are spread around the peripheral field of view. These are more sensitive to light than are the cones, and are the sensors used at night and in low light levels. Only the cones are sensitive to color. And thus in low light levels, we are unable to appreciate any color that may be present. Thus we see faint stars and faint aurora as being devoid of colour. A camera however, will reveal any colour that is present.\n\nCLASSIFYING THE AURORA\n\nPeople have categorised aurora in many different ways, according to colour, shape, structure, brightness and energy. However, before discussing any of these classification schemes we should point out a major division between what are called discrete aurora and diffuse aurora.\n\nDiscrete aurora are those that have reasonably well defined boundaries, and are the ones that are most readily seen. Diffuse aurora on the other hand are much fainter and spread out over a wide area. Diffuse aurora can be divided into two sub-categories of pulsating aurora and hydrogen arc aurora. The former undergo fluctuations in brightness with periods of from 1/10 of a second to 20 seconds. The latter is a uniform broadband of light that results from a steady precipitation of protons and electrons from the outer Van Allen radiation belt.\n\nWhen most people talk about the aurora they are referring to the discrete aurora.\n\nAurorae may be classified according to their colour. However, because color is related to brightness when viewing the aurora (see the last paragraph of the last section), this type of classification must be used with caution. This list also only includes the most common auroral colours.\n\nColor TypeDescription AGreen aurora with red tops BGreen aurora with red bottom CPure green aurora DPure red aurora\n\nAurorae occur in a variety of forms. Ground observers use single letters for shape and structure:\n\nShape Structure A  arc D  diffuse B  band F  glowing C  corona H  homogeneous D  drapery P  pulsating G  glow R  rayed R  ray(s) S  surface\n\nThese letters may be combined to describe a specific auroral form:\n\nHA  homogeneous arc RB  rayed bands PA  pulsating arcs FC  glowing corona\n\nAn atlas of auroral forms is a great help in serious auroral observing.\n\nAuroral brightness is specified by an International Brightness Coefficient (IBC) or with a light meter (photometer) that measures in units called kiloRayleighs (kR):\n\nIBCkRDescription I 1 Faint, brightness of milky way.\n\nNo colour apparent. II 10 Brightness of thin moonlit cirrus cloud. III 100 Brightness of moonlit cumulus cloud. IV 1000 Bright as the full moon.\n\nCasts shadows. Very rare.\n\nThe extent of the aurora may also be specified,varying from a small glow or patch to an all sky storm. The aurora section of the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand uses a seven point Storm Intensity (SI) code to indicate the extent of the aurora.\n\nSIAuroral Form 1Glow or Patch 2Arc, Veil or Band 3Rayed Arc, Veil or Band4Ray Bundles 5Active, Moving or Flaming Forms 6Corona 7All Sky Storm\n\nA satellite can also be used to measure the integrated brightness or activity of the aurora by measuring the electron power input to the polar regions. The brightness of the aurora is proportional to the precipitating electron flux, which may vary from 1012 electrons per square metre for a very faint aurora to over 1017 electrons per square metre for a very bright aurora. The power associated with this flux is measured in gigawatts (109W) according to the table below:\n\nActivity Index Power (GW) 1 0  2.5 2 2.5  4 3 4  6 4 6  10 5 10  16 6 16  24 7 24  39 8 39  61 9 61  96 10 96 +\n\nVIEWING & PHOTOGRAPHING THE AURORA\n\nAurora are not often seen in Australia, but observers in Tasmania will see them more frequently than those along the southern coast of the mainland. Scientists in Australian Antarctic bases may see an aurora every dark night, weather permitting.\n\nThe occurrence of moderate intensity aurora tend to follow the sunspot cycle which has a period of about 11 years. Thus when there a lot of sunspots on the Sun we expect to see more aurora further away from the polar zones. However, the really big aurora tend to occur only a very few times during a single sunspot cycle, and they may occur at virtually any time within the cycle.\n\nPeople living in the south of the south island of New Zealand see frequent auroral displays. However, those of us living in mainland Australia are not so lucky. Auroral alerts can be received by email and even by SMS on a mobile phone (see the Auroral Alerts section below), and for anyone who is interested in viewing and imaging the aurora australis this is a very worthwhile service.\n\nFor those interested in photographing aurorae the graph below gives a guide to camera settings. Although it was devised for film cameras, many digital cameras will now allow an ISO \"film speed\" setting to be entered into the camera. Because long exposures are required for all but the brightest aurorae, it will be necessary to mount the camera on a tripod. And of course, with digital cameras, the instant display feature allows another exposure to be taken immediately if the parameters were not set right in the first place.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES\n\nThree current issues in auroral studies relate to the origin of the theta aurora, the reality of coast hugging aurorae, and the nature of sounds sometimes heard from the aurora.\n\nThe Theta Aurora\n\nMost aurora as seen from space take the form of an oval centred on either the north or the south magnetic pole. Occasionally, however, a line appears across a diameter of the oval, forming the greek letter theta, after which this type of aurora is named.\n\nA theta aurora as seen\n\nby the Dynamics Explorer\n\nsatellite.\n\n[NASA-Univ of Iowa]\n\nHow this aurora forms, and the circumstances that lead to its formation are still matters of debate and investigation.\n\nCoast Hugging Aurorae\n\nUp until recently scientists assumed that only the Earth's magnetic field and the upper atmosphere had any effect on auroral formation. However, examination of many satellite auroral images seems to indicate that there is an excess (with respect to expected statistical occurrence) of aurora that seem to line up with coastlines on the Earth's surface below the aurora. Why the Earth's surface topography should influence auroral behaviour is very unclear at this time.\n\nAn aurora \"hugging\" the\n\ncoast of Greenland.\n\n[POLAR satellite image\n\nNASA - Univ of Iowa]\n\nThe strange phenomenon of auroral sounds is discussed in the following section.\n\nAURORAL SOUNDS\n\nFor over 200 years occasional reports have been made by both scientific and lay people about hearing sounds associated with some aurora, usually those that are bright and rapidly varying. The sounds are described as hissing, whooshing, swishing, and sometimes crackling noises. And the amazing part of the reports is that these sounds seem to relate directly to visible changes in the auroral display.\n\nAlthough there appears no doubt that auroral sounds are real, they present science with a conundrum, because even if sound could travel through the near vacuum of the upper atmosphere where aurorae are produced, it would take a minimum of 300 seconds to travel over the distance between the aurora and the observer. And thus the sight and sound should be totally uncorrelated.\n\nThe only possible explanations must involve electromagnetic phenomena, which travel at the speed of light, together with a transduction mechanism which converts the electromagnetic quantity to sound near the observer. Some researchers have proposed that the explanation lies with the electric field associated with auroral particle acceleration, whereas others maintain that electromagnetic radiation (very low frequency radio waves) are emitted by the aurora, and that this signal is rectified/converted into sound energy near the ground. Possible conversion detectors have been suggested as dry pine needles or even frizzy hair on the observer.\n\nIt appears that no-one has recorded this sound or a VLF signal directly associated with it, although VLF signals have been recorded that are related to auroral activity, and also from bright meteors, which might be related to the auroral sound phenomenon. A Finnish group from Sodanklya Geophysical Observatory and the Finnish Meteorological Institute have made attempts in this area of research, and their results indicate a possible connection between VLF signals and auroral sounds, but more work needs to be done in this area.\n\nOTHER PLANETS\n\nThe Earth is not the only place to have aurorae. The Hubble Space Telescope has now photographed aurorae on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. To host aurorae a planet needs an atmosphere and a reasonable magnetic field. The images below show the auroral ovals on the two largest planets in the solar system."
