        "text": "Have you ever looked up at night and seen a shimmering curtain of lights in the sky? If so, you’re pretty lucky! Auroras are only visible at certain times and places on Earth.\n\nWhat do auroras look like?\n\nEarth’s atmosphere contains different types of gases. These gases can emit light when they collide with high-energy particles from the Sun. The colour of the light depends on the type of gas. It also depends on the altitude at which the collisions occur.\n\nGreen is one of the most common colours in auroras. This happens when particles collide with oxygen molecules between 100 and 300 km above Earth. Pink and dark red colours happen when particles collide with nitrogen molecules at about 100 km. Finally, blue and purple are caused by hydrogen and helium. These colours can be hard to see against the dark night sky.\n\nImage - Text Version\n\nShown is a colour photograph of an aurora in the night sky. The lights of the aurora look like several layers of translucent green fabric, fluttering in waves across the sky. They glow brightly closest to the horizon and fade upwards towards the black, starry sky above. The land in the foreground is dark and snow-covered, and scattered with clumps of evergreen trees.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAuroras can be seen from space. Astronauts can get a close up view! You can see it yourself by watching this video taken from the International Space Station.\n\nWhere can you see auroras?\n\nAuroras are typically seen near the Earth’s poles. We call the auroras near the north pole aurora borealis, or northern lights. We call the auroras near the south pole aurora australis, or southern lights.\n\nTry this!\n\nYou can check if you’re likely to see the northern lights using Natural Resources Canada space weather forecast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center has forecasts for both the northern and southern lights.\n\nAurora australis are only visible in a few places on Earth, and some of them are pretty remote. This may be why the southern lights are less well-known. They can be seen from the southernmost parts of Australia and Argentina, as well as New Zealand, South Georgia Island and Antarctica!\n\nDid You Know?\n\nHistorians think the furthest south the northern lights have ever been seen is in Honolulu, Hawaii. That is only 21 degrees north of the equator! This aurora was seen during the great solar storm of 1859. The southern lights may have been seen as far north as Singapore, eight degrees south of the equator.\n\nWhen are they visible?\n\nThis is an important question! Sometimes, people who don’t live in the range of auroras will travel long distances to see them. There is a whole tourist industry devoted to aurora-spotting!\n\nThe northern lights are visible for more days each year the further north you go. The same applies to the southern lights. So, if you live in Nunavut, you could see them between October and April each year. If you’re lucky enough to go to Antarctica, you could see them between March and September, during the Antarctic winter.\n\nHow do they happen?\n\nThe shape of the magnetosphere steers solar particles towards the poles. Here, they form auroral ovals. These are bands of aurora activity. But auroral ovals are not always the same shape or size. Why is this?\n\nThe solar particles travel to Earth in solar wind. These winds push on the magnetosphere on the side of the Earth that faces the Sun. This forms a magnetotail on the night side. The stronger the solar wind, the more an aurora oval will stretch.\n\nImage - Text Version\n\nShown is a colour illustration of solar wind pushing against Earth’s magnetic field lines. A large orange half-circle along the left edge of the image is labelled “Sun.” Earth is a much smaller, green and blue circle in the centre right. The background is dark blue.Thin yellow lines with arrows along them point from the Sun toward Earth. These are labelled “Solar Wind.” Earth is surrounded by a series of pale blue lines that fan out from its North and South Poles. These are labelled “Magnetic Field Lines,” and form a bubble shape. The bubble is slightly flattened on the side closest to the Sun. On the other side, most of these lines form a more rounded bubble. But some of them, around the top and bottom edges, have stretched a lot. They trail off to the right side of the image. These areas are labelled “Magnetotail.” Solar wind lines point into the spaces between some of Earth’s magnetic field lines. These are where they lead to and from the poles. Here, a few dashed yellow lines move towards Earth’s surface. These are labelled “Solar Wind Particles.” Below, dashed yellow lines form rings around the North and South Poles. These are labelled “Auroral Oval.”\n\nDid you know?\n\nSolar winds cause the particles to hit Earth’s upper atmosphere at more than 72 million kilometres per hour.\n\nSometimes, the solar winds can be so strong that they make the magnetic field lines stretch and snap back on the other side of the globe. Like snapping an elastic band, this sends lots of energy to Earth’s poles. This phenomenon, called magnetic reconnection, creates some spectacular auroras! Solar Storms can also cause bursts of auroras.\n\nSolar winds and solar storms cause auroras by starting geomagnetic storms and substorms in Earth’s magnetosphere. Scientists can predict these storms like they predict the weather on Earth. They measure disturbances in the magnetosphere using a scale they call the planetary K index, or Kp. The Kp scale goes from 0 to 9. A forecast below 5 Kp means auroras are not very likely. But a forecast of 8 or 9 Kp could mean a spectacular light show is on the way.\n\nIncredible KP9 Aurora Borealis Capture By Sony FX3 in Calgary Canada (0:29) from 卡尔加里摄影师Rex\n\nDo auroras make a sound?\n\nIn the Sámi language, one of the names for aurora borealis translates as “the light you can hear.” The Sámi language is spoken in Indigenous communities in northern parts of Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia.\n\nIn the 1930s, people in northern Scotland wrote to a local newspaper to report that the aurora made a sound like rusting silk. Many other people and communities have reported that an aurora makes sizzling or popping noises.\n\nScientists were skeptical about these reports for a long time. Because auroras happen so far above Earth, people on the ground should not be able to hear them. But in 2001, scientists recorded sounds during auroras in eastern Finland. They are still working to record and understand auroral sounds, but they think that they are caused by changes in static electricity in our atmosphere. These changes happen because of the disturbances in Earth’s magnetosphere during auroras. Listen to one of the first recordings of auroral sounds below.\n\n(Audio file courtesy Unto K. Laine (Prof. Emeritus), Aalto University)\n\nAuroras: A Source of Fascination\n\nHumans have been fascinated by auroras for as long as we’ve been able to see them. So it’s not surprising that people around the world have been sharing information about them for a long time, in many different ways.\n\nOne of the first written accounts of the auroras was by Assyrian astronomers around 679-655 B.C. But it wasn’t until 1619 that the lights got the name aurora borealis. Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei named them after Aurora, goddess of dawn, and Boreas, god of the north wind in Greco-Roman mythology. Here are a few of the ways Indigenous people in Canada have experienced and learned about the northern lights. Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland was the first person to theorize that auroras were caused by solar storms.\n\nScientists still don’t know everything about auroras, even though they have studied Earth’s magnetic field and solar winds. They still don’t know exactly where the colourful reactions happen. One way they thought they could find out was through the use of satellites.\n\nAuroras certainly are a spectacular light show!"
