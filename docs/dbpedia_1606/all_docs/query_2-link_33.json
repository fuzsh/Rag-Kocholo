        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Aurora\n\nThe name Aurora bears a rich history and has been used for centuries. Aurora is a dainty and feminine name originating from the Latin word meaning “dawn.” Aurora was inspired by the diaphanous ancient Roman goddess of dawn whose tears were believed to turn into morning dew and were associated with light and the morning sky.\n\nThe name Aurora was later adopted by the Spanish, who used it to refer to the natural phenomenon of the Northern Lights. This name gradually became popular in the Western world during the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, the name also started reaching other parts of the world, including Europe, and eventually made its way to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nLeaning into the mystic and ethereal essence of the name, Aurora invokes mystical images of the Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights. Popular in Sweden, Spain, and Italy since the 17th century, Aurora was common in several European nations. Aurore, the French form, has been popular from the 1970s to 1980s, and Avrora in the Russian languages after the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nAurora has carried several variations, rich in history and meaning, such as Avrorka, Ava, Rory, Ara, and Avrora. The phonetic spelling of the name Aurora is “ah-more-uh.” In English, the stress is typically on the first syllable, and the name is pronounced with an “a” sound, as in “are” and “ore,” as in “more.”\n\nThere are many fictional characters named Aurora across different forms of media, including books, movies, and TV shows. One of the most well-known is Princess Aurora from Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty,” a beautiful princess who falls under the spell of an evil fairy and is only awoken from her slumber by the kiss of her prince. Other popular Auroras include the titular character in the 2014 film “Maleficent,” and a character in the hit TV series “Once Upon a Time.” The name Aurora is often associated with grace, beauty, and strength, making it a popular choice for fictional actors.\n\nHow To Pronounce Aurora?\n\n‘Aurora’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Aurora\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Aurora famous with their contributions in various fields.
