        "text": "Bright, beautiful and bedazzling, the Aurora Borealis is a big-ticket bucket list item for pretty much everyone on Earth. Only those who have witnessed the Northern Lights with their naked eyes can truly understand its ethereal magic. But you don’t need to fork out on a ticket to Scandinavia to see the dramatic natural light display IRL. Australia has its very own version, called the Aurora Australis or Southern Lights, and there have been uncommonly early sightings in Tasmania this year.\n\nWhere can I see the Aurora Australis in Australia?\n\nYour best bet for witnessing the Southern Lights is to be as far south as possible. Due to having the cleanest air in the world and being closest to the South Pole, Tasmania is the obvious choice. You’ll want to find a place far away from city lights, so you can see the dancing colours shine brightest in the dark, twinkling skies.\n\nWhere are the best places to see the Aurora Australis in Tasmania?\n\nThe closer you are to the South Pole, the better. Favourite spots include Goat Bluff on the South Arm Peninsula, around 35km southeast of Hobart; Carlton Beach, 40km east of Hobart; and Tinderbox, 20km south of Hobart. On a clear day, the summit of kunanyi / Mount Wellington is another hotspot – just be prepared to brave the chill at 1270m above sea level.\n\nOn the north, Aurora chasers can try the Highland Lakes, the hill beside Highfield Historic Site and Braddons Lookout near Forth. Those looking for the perfect picture should park themselves at Cradle Mountain in the central highlands where they can use Dove Lake to capture the glistening Southern Lights.\n\nWhat is the best time of year to see the Aurora Australis?\n\nLike its northern sister, it’s hard to predict when the Aurora Australis will show up in town. Sightings are fleeting and faint, but are most common during the cooler months (May to August) and during the spring equinox in September. Throughout this period, solar winds are more likely to interact with the Earth’s magnetic field, creating a bright and beautiful light display.\n\nA Southern Lights display generally lasts one to three hours and is typically brightest between 10pm and 2am. If you have a DSLR at home, make sure to bring it along. The faint colour changes can be difficult to see with the naked eye and might only be visible on camera.\n\nHow can I track the Aurora Australis?\n\nYou can keep track of the Southern Lights by following this real-time map or joining this Facebook group that posts current Aurora alerts around Australia.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nHere are 11 of the best things to do while you're in Hobart\n\nHit that double tap: These are Australia’s top 25 most Insta-worthy locations"
