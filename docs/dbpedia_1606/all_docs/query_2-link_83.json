        "text": "The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, appear during the beginning of September in and around Kiruna in the far north of Sweden. The sky comes alive as pink, green and purple streaks dance high above. And by the time winter has fully set in around January, the Northern Lights can be seen throughout Swedish Lapland – the large expanse of land in northern Sweden that covers nearly a quarter of the country. The last glimpses of these undulating rainbows can be caught as late as the end of March or even early April.\n\nThe long winter nights are welcomed by visitors flocking to witness this incredible light show. On clear evenings, the best time to see Northern Lights in Sweden is between 6:00 pm and 2:00 am. However, the most spectacular display usually occurs around 10:00-11:00 pm.\n\nEven though northern Sweden in general – and Abisko in particular – is the best place to experience the Northern Lights, it can be seen elsewhere. In optimal conditions, it’s possible to see the Northern Lights all over the country, all the way down to Skåne's southern tip. And if you're planning a trip within the next few years, you're in luck – we're heading into a peak of a solar cycle, which increases the chances to see the Northern Lights. The ridge is forecast to occur in July 2025, and the Northern Light nights will grow in number every year until then.\n\nWhat are the Northern Lights, and what causes them?\n\nThe Northern Lights are a unique natural phenomenon created when electrically charged particles from the sun collide in the Earth’s atmosphere. The colour variation depends on the kind of gas particles involved – low-lying oxygen causes the most common green colour, red is produced by oxygen higher in the atmosphere and the blueish-purple hue comes from nitrogen.\n\nThe result is a truly magical sight to behold as the vibrant colours snake across the night sky, dancing around as if moving to some unheard music.\n\nMystical explanations\n\nThe Latin name translates to ‘dawn of the north’, Aurora being the Roman goddess of the dawn. Steeped in myth and viewed in awe, these lights have captivated humanity for millennia.\n\nThe Sámi – the indigenous people of Sweden – believed the lights were the souls of the dead. You weren’t to dance, sing or whistle at them for fear they would feel disrespected and the lights would dip down and carry you off to the afterlife. The Vikings, on the other hand, thought that the Northern Lights were the Valkyries taking fallen soldiers to meet Odin, their chief god."
