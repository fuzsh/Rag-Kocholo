        "text": "The term \"aurora borealis\" was arguably first used by a French scientist Petrus Gassendus aka Pierre Gassendi in 1621, in his treatise \"Physics.\" For further discussion, see Siscoe, George. 1986. An historical footnote on the origin of 'Aurora Borealis.' In History of geophysics, volume 2\n\nThe phenomenon itself has been known for a long time in Europe; for example, the ancient Greeks called it \"blazing skies\" or \"flaming sky dragons\" (Hesiod, Theogony).\n\nThe term \"aurora australis\" was arguably first used in 1741 (OED)\n\nNotice that when those terms were coined, they were used as Latin words. In other words, the Latin word \"borealis\" was used, not the name of a Greek god.\n\nCommon sense guess: The northern lights have been known in the west for a much longer time than the southern lights. Maybe the ancient greeks themselves knew of it and named it. The southern lights were discovered (by the west), and thus named, much later, by people who had neither greek nor latin as their first language. Maybe they didn't see a problem in mixing greek and latin terms.\n\nNotice how many of the older scientific terms for animals and plants are a mishmash of greek and latin (now they are a mishmash of just about anything). If following that tradition, a mix of greek and latin to describe another natural phenomenon is perfectly understandable."
