        "text": "You’ll also have opportunities to see the aurora in May (the start of winter) and September (the beginning of spring).\n\nGenerally, unlike the Northern Lights, there’s potential for you to see the Aurora at any point in the year. We’ve even heard of summer sightings in December, January and February.\n\nFor your best chance, check local weather reports, follow the locals’ up-to-the-minute sighting posts on Aurora Facebook groups like Aurora Australis Tasmania Alert, or ask your tour guide for the best, up-to-date information.\n\nHobart’s a big city, and cities usually aren’t the top spots for seeing auroras. However, sometimes you’ve got to work with what you’ve got – especially if you’re limited by time.\n\nYou actually can see the Southern Lights from Hobart’s highest peaks, when the conditions are right. Getting away from the light pollution is key.\n\nOf course, national parks are often the best places to see such natural phenomena as light shows in the sky – given their size, and the lack of pollution.\n\nBut home to rainforest and grasslands, Cradle NP is well worth a visit beyond the Aurora. Expect epic hikes up Cradle Mountain, misty views over Lake St Clair, and unforgettable week-long treks through the wilderness.\n\nThose in search of panorama views come to Mount Nelson in the day for the spectacular vantage point of the River Derwent and the city of Hobart. There’s also a lovely café by the lookout.\n\nOften recommended instead of the better-known Mount Wellington, its also well known that at night – during the right season – its an excellent place to video or photograph the Aurora Australis.\n\nLeaving Tasmania now, we head to New Zealand, where a few locations are known for offering excellent views of the Aurora.\n\nStewart Island is just 1,570 sq km big, and more than 80% of the island is recognised as protected Rakiura National Park. Rakiura means ‘glowing skies’ in Maori, referring to the breathtaking Southern Lights sunsets the island is known for.\n\nStewart Island is also a birders’ paradise: a haven for both seabirds and birds on land. Both here and Ulva Island offer rare sighting opportunities, including the NZ kaka parrot and the Stewart Island brown kiwi.\n\nIts rare you’ll see Southern Lights beyond Tasmania while you’re in Oz, but you do have a chance if you’re in Victoria. You’ll want to be there during peak Australis season, for your best bet.\n\nYou could try nearby Philip Island, easily accessible from Melbourne. Though don’t blame us if you don’t see anything – the island’s known for its glorious penguin parades at sunset, rather than light shows.\n\nJust as the Northern Lights is clearly visible in the Arctic Circle, the same goes for Southern Lights in the Antarctic.\n\nEpic plumes of pink, purple and green dancing across a twinkling night sky will be one of many magical moments if you’re lucky enough to embark on an Antarctic expedition.\n\nIcebergs and untouched natural landscapes make the Aurora just one of several spectacles.\n\nIn the Antarctic Circle, South Georgia is absolutely one of the best places to see the Aurora Australis with your own eyes.\n\nIts one of the world’s southernmost places, with very few manmade distractions, so you can expect that the lights will be at their very brightest and most impressive here.\n\nThe Antarctic winter is the best time to go, so June to September, though you may be able to see the lights in South Georgia as early as March.\n\nPatagonia is the southernmost tip of South America, meaning it is very possible to see the Southern Lights here, too.\n\nThough lesser-known as an Aurora spot, May and July are good months to visit if you’re hoping for a chance of a sighting. If you’re lucky, April and August may produce results – but don’t count on it.\n\nEast of Argentinian Patagonia are The Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory so far around the world, that they’re not typically thought of as one of the best places to witness the Southern Lights in all their glory.\n\nThey actually do provide a pretty good shot – as well as a completely unique travel experience, in many other ways: otherworldly landscapes and penguins galore.\n\nGo between May and August for your best chance of a sighting."
