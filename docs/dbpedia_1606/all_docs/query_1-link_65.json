        "text": "Forget the Northern Lights... here's the Southern Spectacular: Australia's skies are lit up with the fantastic colours of the Aurora Australis\n\nThe Aurora Australis or 'Southern Lights' is best seen in parts of Tasmania on a clear and cold night's sky\n\nIt is the Southern Hemisphere's version of the Aurora Borealis or 'Northern Lights' best seen in North America\n\nThe phenomenon occurs when electrons emanating from the sun and gases in the upper atmosphere collide\n\nThe result is this illuminating spectrum of green, purple, yellow and red lights streaking across the sky\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA collection of brightly coloured lights streaking across Australia's southern skies have been impressing sky watchers in Tasmania in recent months.\n\nThe 'Southern Lights' can also be seen from Southern Victoria, New Zealand and Antarctica usually between March and September. It is the southern Hemisphere's equivalent to the Northern Lights.\n\nThe mesmerising display of light-filled patterns, known as the Aurora Australis, is the result of a combination of natural forces occurring some 100km above the earth's surface.\n\nThe streaks of greens, purples, reds and yellows are formed inside the Aurora Oval. This is where electrons emanating from the sun and gases in the upper atmosphere collide.\n\nThe collisions produce electrical discharges which energise atoms of oxygen and nitrogen, causing the release of the multicoloured light seen in these pictures.\n\nEach colour is representative of a particular distance from the earth's surface, and the reason why Tasmanians are so best placed to view the spectacular light show is because of the state's location to the Earth's South Magnetic Pole."
