        "text": "Everyone has a bucket list. Some people want to scale Killamanjaro, ride a Venetian gondola, or perhaps just publish that novel they've kept on the back burner. There's one thing, though, that is quintessential for any bucket list: seeing the southern lights in Australia.\n\nIt's no easy feat to witness this once-in-a-lifetime experience for yourself. The lights–the polar Aurora–reserve themselves only for intrepid travelers willing to visit Earth's most remote, frigid corners. When you see them in person, you immediately ask yourself one question: what exactly are they?\n\nEveryone knows what the Auroras look like. They're those awe-inspiring celestial light shows common in computer desktop backgrounds. What most don't know is how Mother Nature conjures such vibrant displays.\n\nIn this guide, we'll answer all your burning questions. Continue reading as we pull back the curtain on the Aurora Australis.\n\nWhat Is an Aurora?\n\nAurora is more than just a female name. Its origins go all the way back to the Roman pantheon. Specifically, the goddess of the dawn.\n\nThe name “dawn,” of course, doesn't do it justice. They're undulating curtains of light high up in the sky. They take on many aurora colors: green, yellow, blue, and even red.\n\nThis incredible beauty only occurs near the Earth's poles. As a result, there are two specific auroras. Aurora Borealis is in the north, and Aurora Australis is in the south.\n\nThey aren't just pretty polar lights, either. They were once a component of mythology and religion. Northern Europeans and Native Americans treated them as heavenly manifestations.\n\nWhere Does the Aurora Come From?\n\nThere's nothing mystical or heavenly about the aurora. Thanks to modern science, we understand its inner workings quite well.\n\nIt all begins with the centerpiece of our solar system: the sun. The sun doesn't just provide us with life-giving light. It also bombards us with radiation and electrically charged particles (AKA solar wind).\n\nLuckily, Earth has a magnetic field–a shield–to protect itself. Much of this harmful barrage ricochets right off.\n\nEarth's magnetic poles, however, are like whirlpools. They tend to trap some of these charged particles.\n\nWe call these geomagnetic poles “auroral zones.” As you have already guessed, this is where the aurora lights appear.\n\nWhy Do Auroras Glow Like That?\n\nThose trapped particles have to go somewhere. So, they collide with our atmosphere's molecules: hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, helium, and others.\n\nIn fact, it's thanks to the chemical properties of these elements that auroras produce their colors. Greens, reds, and yellows each result from interactions with atmospheric molecules.\n\nThe result is gorgeous bursts of light. Billions upon billions of nonstop microscopic collisions, to be precise. And voilà, you have an aurora!\n\nYou may be asking why the lights have that characteristic billowing curtain. This is because this collision reaction happens along magnetic lines. For this reason, you most often see aurora lights waving like an ethereal flag.\n\nDo They Have Different Forms?\n\nYes. Most people picture the squiggly lines typical in time-lapse videos. Auroras do take on many different forms, though.\n\nThere are two general categories of auroras: quiet and active auroras. The former is slow-moving, and the latter, obviously, is in constant flux.\n\nHere is a list of some of the configurations that an aurora might take:\n\nArcs\n\nRays\n\nDiffused clouds\n\nVeils\n\nDunes\n\nCan You See Them From Space?\n\nYes! In fact, the crew of the orbiting ISS regularly captures high-altitude video of them. Rest assured, the view from down below is equally spectacular.\n\nWhat About the Southern Lights in Australia?\n\nThe Southern Lights go by the name “Aurora Australis.” Australis means “southern” in Latin. This is opposed to Borealis, which means “northern.”\n\nSimply put, this is the “southern dawn” visible at the southern pole. Aurora Borealis only occurs at the northern pole. Don't get them mixed up before you buy a plane ticket!\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between the Two?\n\nThe primary difference between Aurora Australis and Aurora Borealis is location. The same phenomenon is happening in both places. Whether you're on the North or South Pole, you will get a near-identical spectacle.\n\nHowever, there is one additional factor: accessibility. You mostly hear about the Aurora Borealis from globetrotters. This is because it's much easier to reach.\n\nSimply put, there are more human-accessible locations near the Aurora Borealis. The Australis, on the other hand, makes getting to these ideal vantage points more challenging.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, though, we'll focus on the Australis variant. Trust us; it's well worth seeing it, too.\n\nWhen Is Aurora Australis Visible?\n\nTechnically, you can see the aurora year-round. That said, you shouldn't just go whenever it's most convenient for you. Certain times of the year produce more brilliant, dazzling episodes.\n\nThe intensity of the aurora depends entirely on the activity of solar wind. As it increases, so does the aurora. With enough solar wind, it becomes visible across a larger swath of land.\n\nSolar wind is not always predictable on a day-to-day basis, unfortunately. Also, there are two seasons when auroras are typically the strongest: the spring and fall equinoxes.\n\nWhat Is an Equinox?\n\nThe equinox is a biannual celestial phenomenon. It usually occurs in March and September, once every six months.\n\nWhen it happens, the Earth's poles get daytime and nighttime in similar portions. Roughly 12 hours each.\n\nThe reason for this is that Earth's magnetic poles don't usually align with its geographic ones. Twice a year–during the equinox–they match up perfectly. This ideal position results in an abundance of charged particles–and, therefore, more aurora.\n\nSolar Maximums\n\nThere's another factor that plays into how strong the aurora will appear: solar maximums. Approximately every 11 years, there is a massive surge in solar activity. This is when we see increased CMEs (coronal mass ejections) and solar flares.\n\nPredicting when the next solar maximum arrives is not quite so simple. Scientists suspect July 2025 to be the next most likely date. It's a rough estimate, to be clear, and we could well see it in 2024 instead.\n\nWhere to Go for Aurora Sightseeing\n\nThe key to seeing an aurora is getting close to the “auroral ovals.” These are the rings around the poles where auroras occur, particularly at latitudes of 10 to 20°.\n\nAurora Australis has a number of potential vantage points. You may be able to spot it from the following locations:\n\nAntarctica\n\nNew Zealand\n\nArgentina\n\nChile\n\nAustralia\n\nLocations will vary from place to place. Some of them are more challenging to reach. For example, one would have to venture to Patagonia or Tierra del Fuego in Chile and Argentina.\n\nIn Australia, the best spot would be Tasmania. Other locations range across Victoria's southern coast.\n\nTips for Viewing Auroras\n\nSo you're sold and want to view it with your own eyes. What should you do to prepare? Here we'll provide some tips for your visit to see the Aurora Australis.\n\nGo Remote\n\nThe great thing about the aurora is that you can often see it in places close to home. Some have spotted it on the US-Canada border, as an example. Unfortunately, while worthwhile, it would be a sub-optimal experience compared to a dedicated viewing.\n\nYou need somewhere far, far away from civilization. Remote towns and villages near the auroral oval are ideal. In particular, places with strict adherence to dark sky regulations.\n\nPlan According to the Moon\n\nThe lunar cycle has an effect on the sky's ambient lighting. The aurora may be more visible during specific stages in the lunar cycle.\n\nIdeally, plan your trip when there is a New Moon. The sky is at its darkest, then. If you can't, don't sweat it; the aurora is still visible under a Full Moon.\n\nBe Patient\n\nThe aurora is visible at all times of the night in the auroral zone. Unfortunately, the weather tends to conspire against you. Cloudy, rainy days can easily prevent successful spottings.\n\nYou may have to plan an entire week just to get a handful of successful viewings. So, arrange activities to keep yourself busy in the meantime. Be prepared to wake up at odd hours if necessary for a surprise appearance.\n\nGet Some Aurora Australis Photography\n\nIt's critical that you enjoy the aurora with your own eyes first. Don't let your camera rob the moment from you. Of course, do snap some pictures for posterity.\n\nIdeally, set up a camera on a tripod to automatically take snapshots and video. This allows you to enjoy the experience with your own eyes and still snag a recording.\n\nIf you don't have a fancy DSLR, fear not. Most modern smartphones include a potent Night Mode shooting option. You'll still need a tripod or a steady surface to set it on.\n\nTrack Auroras With Aurora Admin\n\nAuroras are one of those things that should be on everyone's bucket list. The southern lights in Australia are no exception. It takes some dedication and planning, but not a soul regrets an up-front-and-personal viewing."
