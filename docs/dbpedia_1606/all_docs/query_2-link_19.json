        "text": "Auroras are dazzling displays of colored light that sometimes appear in the night sky. They occur in Earth’s far northern and far southern regions. In the Northern Hemisphere such a display is known as aurora borealis, or the northern lights. In the Southern Hemisphere it is called aurora australis, or the southern lights. Auroras are named after Aurora, the ancient Roman goddess of the dawn.\n\nAuroras take many shapes and forms, with arcs and rays of colored light being the most common. The light may also look like shimmering curtains, bands, waves, or clouds. An aurora constantly changes shape as the light moves across the sky. The light also may brighten and fade.\n\nAuroras are caused by the Sun. The Sun sends out a stream of electrically charged particles called the solar wind. The solar wind travels from the Sun toward the Earth at great speed.\n\nThe Earth is a huge magnet surrounded by a magnetic field. The Earth’s magnetic field forces the charged particles in the solar wind toward the planet’s northern and southern polar regions. The particles move downward through the Earth’s upper atmosphere. As they do, they crash into atoms and molecules of gases such as oxygen and nitrogen. These collisions cause the atoms and molecules to give off light. This light is an aurora. An aurora’s colors are determined by the different gases that give off the light."
