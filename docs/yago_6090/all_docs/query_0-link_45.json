        "text": "Pierce Brosnan believes that he and wife Keely Shaye Smith are stronger for all they’ve been through together.\n\n“We like each other a lot. We love each other a lot,” Brosnan, 70, said of the secret to the pair’s relationship during a Tuesday, December 12, interview with Fox News. “And we’ve been down the road, and we’ve seen many, many hardships as families do, as we all do.”\n\nThe actor continued: “But watching someone grow up with you and grow old with you is a very spiritual journey. To watch each other change … whatever it may be, the hair [or] the waist … it’s [about] the love in the heart.”\n\nBrosnan met Smith, 60, in 1994, three years after his first wife, Cassandra Harris, died of ovarian cancer. Prior to Harris’ death, she and Brosnan welcomed son Sean in 1983. (Brosnan also adopted Harris’ daughter, Charlotte, and son, Chris, whom she shared with her late ex.)\n\nRelated: Pierce Brosnan and Wife Keely Shaye Smith's Relationship Timeline\n\nPierce Brosnan‘s life led him to a lasting marriage with Keely Shaye Smith. Brosnan was previously married to Cassandra Harris from 1980 until her death in 1991. Brosnan and Harris welcomed son Sean (born in September 1983), and he adopted Harris’ daughter Charlotte and son Chris, whom she shared with her late ex. Harris died […]\n\nDuring a 2018 interview with Closer, Brosnan opened up about being “lucky enough to find love again” with Smith after losing his first wife.\n\n“We were meant to find each other. I thank God for her every day,” he said. “When Keely looks at me, I go weak. I love her vitality, her passion. She has this strength that I wouldn’t be able to live without.”\n\nBrosnan and Smith tied the knot in Ireland in 2001. They share sons Dylan and Paris, born in 1997 and 2001, respectively. On Tuesday, Brosnan gushed about the “supportive” figure Smith has been for him and his sons.\n\nRelated: Stars Who Have Tragically Lost Their Significant Others Through the Years\n\nMichelle Williams, Lea Michele and more stars have opened up about dealing with their grief following unexpected deaths in their personal lives. The Dawson’s Creek alum met Heath Ledger after they played husband and wife in Brokeback Mountain in 2004. The couple welcomed daughter Matilda the following year. Williams and Ledger called it quits in […]\n\n“Keeley is a journalist, a reporter. She’s an artist in her own right. And as a woman, she has made a family for our sons,” he said. “She allows me to go out into the wild blue yonder and do what I do as a man, as an actor, [she] always has.”\n\nDespite forays into the “blue yonder” for his acting career, Brosnan always carries Smith with him. He subtly honored his wife by wearing his real wedding ring on screen in his 2022 film Black Adam.\n\n“This is our wedding ring and this is a watch that Keely bought me many years ago with an inscription that [reads], ‘Time flies on love’s wings,'” Brosnan told Entertainment Tonight at the movie’s premiere. “I decided to wear it for this character. It seemed appropriate.”\n\nRelated: Lucky Lasses! Famous Irish Celebrities and the Women Who’ve Won Their Hearts\n\nKiss them, they’re Irish! The Emerald Isle is the home of medieval castles, Guinness beer, good luck charms and some of Hollywood’s hottest celebrities. Pierce Brosnan, Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy all hail from Ireland and have made a name for themselves on the big and small screen worldwide. Music icon Bono got his start […]\n\nBrosnan isn’t the only romantic in the relationship. Smith sang her husband’s praises during a joint interview with Closer in 2018.\n\n“Pierce is intelligent, captivating and his real beauty emanates from the soul,” she told the outlet. “And, like a fine wine, he’s aging beautifully.”"
