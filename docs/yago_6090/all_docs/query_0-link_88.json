        "text": "Pierce Brosnan is still in Loverville ‚Äî and he‚Äôs not going anywhere.\n\nThe actor, 70, celebrated his wife Keely Shaye Brosnan‚Äôs 60th birthday by showering her with 60 red roses on her special day.\n\n‚ÄúSixty roses for my brown eyed girl on her 60th birthday,‚Äù Brosnan captioned his Instagram post, which showed a picture of the pair smiling behind the bouquet.\n\n‚ÄúForever happy and blessed was I to be sitting there when you walked around the corner early one morning in Cabo San Lucas @keelyshayebrosnan.‚Äù\n\nFans and celebs alike rushed to the comments section, including Linda Thompson, who wrote, ‚ÄúHappy birthday to the lovely Keely! What a blessed Love you two share! üéÇüíú.‚Äù\n\nThe pair recently celebrated their 22nd wedding anniversary last month, and Keely marked the special occasion with a heartwarming Instagram post of the pair‚Äôs nuptials in Ireland.\n\n‚ÄúHappy Anniversary @piercebrosnanofficial,‚Äù she wrote on August 5. ‚ÄúThank you for always being up for this adventure called life.‚Äù\n\nIn the caption, Keely wrote the wedding date, as well as April 8, 1994 ‚Äî the day they met.\n\nAnd the proud wife also marked her hubby‚Äôs 70th birthday in May with a sweet snap of the ‚ÄúJames Bond‚Äù actor standing in front of a floral field.\n\n‚ÄúHappy Birthday my darling @piercebrosnanofficial ü•Ç Wishing you a blessed, bountiful and adventurous new trip around the sun. It‚Äôs not how old you are ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs how bold you are in life. I love you with all my heart,‚Äù she wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nSince getting hitched in 2001, the couple went on to welcome two kids together; sons Dylan, 26, and Paris, 22.\n\nPierce is also a dad to three children he shared with his first wife, Cassandra Harris, who tragically died from cancer in 1991.\n\nWhile Pierce and Keely‚Äôs sons prefer to share little of their lives in the public eye, the proud sons gushed over their famous father in a British GQ cover shoot in October 2022.\n\nThe siblings gushed about their dad in the interview, calling the ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù star the ‚Äúnicest guy‚Äù they know.\n\nFor more Page Six you love‚Ä¶\n\nListen to our weekly ‚ÄúWe Hear‚Äù podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n‚ÄúI always thought he had a lot of friends, growing up because people would come up to him in the street, and ‚Ä¶ he talk[ed] to everyone for a really long time,‚Äù Dylan told the magazine, noting that he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútell anyone‚Äù who his father is.\n\nHe went on to reflect on their normal childhood spent between Los Angeles and Hawaii homes.\n\n‚Äú[We were] a bunch of kids running around a forest, looking for something to do, riding bicycles down the street, going to caves and swimming and surfing and stuff,‚Äù he explained."
