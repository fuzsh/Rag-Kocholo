        "text": "Post by Valeri Petrofsky on\n\nDid Brosnan and Zimbalist hate each other? The biography I have read on Brosnan says that he didn't get on with her and that he stopped his fan club when they showed a picture of Zimbalist and him on the cover of the fan magazine. And I read that Cassie told Zimbalist that Remington Steele was just a stepping stone in Brosnan's career. So that probably didn't help things! Also that Zimbalist said that when the show is over \"All anyone will remember is that Pierce Brosnan starred in it\" (Which is exactly what happened!)shows just how insecure she felt when theymade the show.\n\nIt's a shame they didn't get on, as they has great chemistry on screen. My personal opinion is that Zimbalist was pissed off that she managed to have a co-star who was probably the best looking guy on the planet and so was going to get all the attention. Pretty as Zimbalist was, she was not extra special, and had no chance of stepping out of the shadow of Brosnan, a shadow that he still casts thanks to re-runs of Remington Steele!\n\nValeri Petrofsky\n\nPS\n\nI also read in Empire Magazine that Zimbalist has never watched a Bond film and \"probably never will\". Personal taste., or just another dig at Brosnan?\n\nPost by IcyCalm on\n\nI absolutely don’t think it’s possible for Pierce Brosnan to hate anybody - it’s just not in him. Or to even hold a grudge any longer than 5 minutes. We know today he looks back on RS with great fondness. Nevertheless, I’ll bet Stephanie’s attitude towards him wore him down a bit, by the end of the series. Wasn’t he quoted after RS as saying he wanted to make a war movie or something, with no women for a change?\n\nJust as there is a great deal of PB in Remington Steele, I suspect there was a lot of SZ in Laura Holt. I try hard to separate the role from the actress in my mind, but after hearing the subtle digs she’s directed towards PB over the years, surely his gentlemanly patience was tested. Sometimes their fights looked disconcertingly real to me, a legitimate opportunity to vent frustration. Watch some 4th season episodes like “Steele in the Running” where he barely speaks above a monotone. (On the other hand, there’s the wonderful 4th season “Beg. Borrow or Steele” where they interact superbly under unusual circumstances.) And I think he had a lot of wicked fun taping \"Bonds of Steele.\" I haven’t seen the 5th season since it was first-run, so I’d like to view it now, with all this in mind.\n\nHe said they met over lunch once to discuss reprising their roles but decided against it. Perhaps they each went home and re-lived some tough moments on the set. Ah, what a tremendous coup an RS remake would have been for us! (An even better one for SZ, career-wise, I should think.)\n\nLast April as I sat and watched “Laws of Attraction,” admiring his boyishly tanned complexion under that long glorious hair, I thought, good lord - its Remington Steele! He must have finally dumped that tedious Laura Holt, assumed yet another name, gone to school and became a successful lawyer! Hmmm, still attracted to the same type of girl, I see, “impossible challenge” and all that. Ha.\n\n-IcyCalm\n\nPost by Valeri Petrofsky on\n\nDid Brosnan and Zimbalist actually meet up after the series and discuss doing a reunion show? When was this? Is their a link to an interview where he talks about it? I'm surprised I must say, as Brosnan has said how Remington cost him Bond and with all the stress that must have caused, plus having a co-star that seemed a pain the *rse, I'm amazed he has met up for lunch with her. I reckon that Cassie didn't like Zimbalist and so that probably didn't help (I remember Brosnan saying in a quote that Zimbalist was spoiled)\n\nOh, I think Brosnan is quite capable of hating someone, take the Christian Brothers in ireland who Pierce said beat him, he's said he hates them in the past, and I bet he hates MTM for calling him back for Steele. By the way I saw Brosnan interviewed on \"The Big Breakfast\" on channel 4 here in England when he was promoting \"The World is Not Enough\" and Lisa Tarbuck, the host, asked him, \"Did losing out to Bond rubbish Remington Steele for you?\". Brosnan nodded and then started his long recollection of how he lost out and had to go back to the series.\n\nValeri Petrofsky\n\nPost by IcyCalm on\n\nHe said he discussed RS with her, on one of the American \"biography\" shows. I'll see if I can precisely locate it within my personal VCR tape library. (What a delightful challenge.) It was a very short remark.\n\nOn Inside Actor's Studio he did say, when asked, that his least favorite word was \"hate.\" Perhaps after weathering such uncommonly awful times in his life, PB realizes to hate isn't worth the bother. The damage to one's karma alone .... Of course it's probably quite healthy to hate the Hitlers of the world, etc., but let's not visit Philosophy 101. At any rate, his altruism alone should render the whole subject academic.\n\nStill, he's had to have felt the strong desire to throttle some people! For invading his privacy, career ripoffs, etc., etc. - he's certainly had enough just cause! I don't suppose he'll ever forget losing Bond in '86. It was messing around with fate. The whole world felt for him, I remember it well. The roles he took then, Taffin and Petrofsky: humorless and violent, perfect excuses to kick and punch out one's inner aggressions.\n\nThat's why I'm so bent out of shape over losing Bond again this year. A veritable Mobius Loop of fate. (I'm trying to get over it - if he can do it, so should I.)\n\n-IcyCalm\n\nPost by Myrtle Groggins on\n\nAnd we don't usually have to kiss our co-workers, do we?\n\nWhen I met Stephanie, I mentioned that I was a longtime fan, and a huge fan of Remington Steele. She said, \"That was so long ago!\". Then I reminded her that I've been a fan of Daddy Zimbalist since the first run of 77 Sunset Strip and we both laughed and agreed that was indeed much longer ago than Remington Steele.\n\nShe's always gracious and she looks so darn cute in person, so much better than in candid shots we see nowadays.\n\nI really can't see how holding a grudge for either of them for more than 20 years would be a good thing. Unfortunately, SZ like Laura Holt, was dismissed by many people as second banana on RS, although not by me, because I always thought she was darned impressive. Still, that's gotta hurt, even in the longterm and especially when the first season DVDs appeared without her on the cover.\n\nedited to say: I just realized I'm now a Secret Agent!! It's taken FIVE years to become one.\n\nPost by Elizabeth R on\n\nHow could anyone watch Remington Steele and not appreciate that it might be the only show in which BOTH characters/actors were so absolutely vital?? SZ WAS Laura Holt! How many women, including myself wanted to be exactly like her? She was beautiful, fabulous, smart, super athletic, and funny! What keeps me coming back to the show is that I love her so much. In fact, we love PB more for loving SZ and not some bimbo with Farah Fawcett hair. I think it's criminal that she has not been remembered as she should but I think that was her choice. PB got a publicist, he tooted his own horn, he marketed himself as a movie star and he succeeded (and aren't we happy!). But SZ always wanted to be in theater, the arts etc. I was so excited to hear that they were considering a new movie in 2005. Sad that there hasn't been more said on the subject. I really hope they can both enjoy their work the way we have. They should be so proud for what they gave us.\n\nPost by Elizabeth R on\n\nShe had the same publicist? Really? Because in all the interviews I can find, she seems to have actively stayed away from the whole Hollywood shtick. Militantly so, while Pierce was playing it up as much as he could for the work that would come after. As for Pierce only wanting to do a cameo... I read an interview in 2005 (I can find it somewhere) in which he was really excited about it and thought that there would be enough of a fan base for it to do really well. Uh... hello! Look at us! I wonder how many of us there are anyway.\n\nAs for them hating each other: I don't believe it. I think it was like that kid in 2nd period who you hated but had some chemical reaction to that you couldn't explain. He was married. She was single. She wanted recognition, he wanted to make it in the movies but -- man -- if all that frustration didn't come out in some fabulous chemistry: not to mention intimacy. I've never really seen the like of it.\n\nPost by pajarynjah on\n\nHello what a wonderful lot of comments that has been written here. The truth of the matter is that Remington Steele was the best of its kind back in the 80's. Where else could you get a female role that had such a spunky, attractive, atheletic, no nonsense, very smart, yet caring character such as Laura Holt's, played beautifully I might add by Stephanie Zimbalist. Pierce Brosnan on the other hand played the handsome, tall, dark, yet mysterious Remington to perfection. As for Stephanie and Pierce hating or disliking each other that is utter rubbish.\n\nI have the all the dvds and in the extras on one disc Pierce says this and I quote. \" There was this beautiful, brown eyed girl, who was a real pistol and people thought we didn't get on, but in fact we did. There was a great trust between us, we both had our own styles of acting and there was this one upmanship between us which was written in the characters.\" Not word perfect but close enough. I can imagine Stephanie getting a bit toey with the succes that came Pierce's way, but she never wanted stardom, the way Pierce did. He has said over the years that he was happy he didn't get Bond back in 1986 because he was too young and he needed to mature and grow into his face. There is no doubt that there was absolute chemistry of some type between the two characters. You only have to watch episodes like Steele Away with Me( he enjoyed her company), Vintage Steele(best kiss in the all the series and Pierce really meant that kiss). Grappling Steele(he looks at her a lot) Forged Steele (the scene where they walk along the street and talk about why she didn't see him in prison), he touches her back before stepping on the pavement, then does the same thing as the round the corner on the way back. Breathe of Steele( steals looks at her all the time). Lofty Steele(he's all over her like a rash, but from a distance). If you want to see the genuine chemistry then series one is the go. Series 5 should never have been made as there seems to be a nothingness and a hollow feel to the shows. You can sense something isn't quite right between them. Pierce also said on other extras that it his character wanted to jump her bones each week and that was his mission. Anyway for what it's worth I love all the shows and I have much more to say on the subject and would welcome some feedback or comments.\n\nPost by SecondWind on\n\nHi, I also seriously doubt that they ever hated each other. That whole thing was just blown out of proportion. But 'Brosnan and Zimbalist hate each other' makes by far a better story, than 'Brosnan and Zimbalist (surprise!) like each other'. Their chemistry was awesome and I doubt very much, that even great actors like Pierce and Stephanie could fake such a thing. I believe they both were very much like Steele and Laura - they were just the perfect match, but still bickering with each other from time to time... I have first seen RS as a kid, when it started airing in Germany around 1985. I didn't get the clever dialogue then, but the great chemistry between the characters was clearly visible. RS is still my very favourite series until today, it's timeless! Like many, I'm also not really happy with how the 5th season turned out, although it had it's moments. You can really tell, that everybody was called back from other engagements and everything was done in a rush. But would you really have wanted the last episode of season 4 to be the last of the series ?\n\nThere's a very nice recent interview with Stephanie Zimbalist (looking magnificent, BTW). Check out what she has to say about the issue:\n\nwww.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2011/02/the_subject_was_roses_preview.html\n\nPost by laurenga on\n\nHi!\n\nI also think that Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist had great onscreen chemistry playing Laura and Steele. Whatever opinions they might or might not have had about each other at the time, their characters were just perfect as a couple.\n\nI first discovered RS as a very little child, and there were many things I didn't understand about the characters and the dialogues (for example, I didn't realize Steele wasn't really \"Steele\" until I watched reruns a few years later), but I guess even then I sensed the chemistry between the two main characters. Every time they reran the series on TV I was captivated by this chemistry once again; though I think I didn't fully understand what it was until an even later rerun when I was a teenager.\n\nI loved reading the interview with Stephanie Zimbalist, and the comment about Pierce Brosnan. I think she has described him as a sweet, nice man in other interviews before, which is lovely."
