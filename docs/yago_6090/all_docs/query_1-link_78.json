With my fingers. With my hands, actually.”\n\nDuring the interview with British GQ Pierce also gushed about his two model/musician sons Dylan, 25, and Paris, 21.\n\nThe star wrote at the time: \"Friends offered her surgery to reduce her weight. But I strongly love every curve of her body.\"\n\nHe went on: \"She is the most beautiful woman in my eyes. And also because she had our five children.\n\n\"In the past, I truly loved her for her person, not only for her beauty, and now I’m loving her even more that she is my children’s mother.\n\n\"And I am very proud of her, and I always seek to be worthy of her love,\" he finished.\n\nThe October issue of British GQ is available via digital download and on newsstands on 27th September."
