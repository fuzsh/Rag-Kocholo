        "text": "I am the oldest of three children, by 9 years. Because of this, I have had the opportunity to see my younger sister and brother evolve from small babies, to funny kids, to intelligent and erudite adolescents.\n\nBeing the oldest, I was able to share with them many of my favorite television shows and movies, and have also had the chance to watch and learn about what entertains them as well. Some of the best and most hilarious conversations I’ve ever had have been with those two.\n\nSeeing my siblings grow has also taught me the power of influence. From the time I decided on my major and started making films, I turned to the two closest people to me and made them stars in my class assignments. Since they were still little, it was difficult to direct them at times, but the blooper reels from these projects have turned into precious family memories for me.\n\nAnd this past year, I had the pleasure of watching movies that my brother and sister created for their class assignments. Their wit and intelligence were on full display through the whole thing, and I have never been more proud to hear the words “Can I show you the movie I made?”\n\nThe production of Remington Steele was able to benefit from family ties in a very similar way. Both Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist had the pleasure of acting alongside his wife Cassandra Harris, and her father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., in multiple episodes of Steele. They were featured in recurring roles throughout the series as people from Steele’s past with a knack for showing up and getting him in trouble with Laura, the law, or both.\n\nHarris was the first to appear on the show, as an old flame in the season 1×5 episode Though Shalt Not Steele. In her role as Felicia, she tries to convince Steele to abscond with a painting that the agency has just been hired to protect, and return to his life of crime.\n\nBrosnan and Harris met in 1978, the year she starred in her first film, The Greek Tycoon(1978), and the same year that her marriage to second husband Dermot Harris would come to an end. They were married in 1980, and the year after that, both Harris and Brosnan’s screen acting careers took off.\n\nWithout Harris, Remington Steele as we know it may not even have existed, for it was at her urging, following the success of Manions of America (his first major role), that the family traveled to LA for Brosnan to try and find work. Even with two young children, she sensed that there was a talent to be capitalized on, and she was correct.\n\nThough her character of Felicia makes a comeback in the first two episodes of season four, Steele Searching part 1+2, Harris actually appears as an entirely different, but similar character on the show at the end of season 2.\n\nIn Woman of Steele (episode 2×20), she plays another previous girlfriend Anna Simpson, who, up until their “chance” meeting, Steele had believed to be dead.\n\nHer character serves as a representation of Steele’s past, and furthers the romantic story line between he and Laura. While Steele tries to free Anna from the grip of a supposed swindler, Laura once again finds herself up against a person from the past he refuses to share with her.\n\nWhile Harris and Brosnan were both relatively new to fame when Remington Steele began airing, such was not the case for guest star Efrem Zimbalist Jr., father of Stephanie Zimbalist.\n\nAppearing as Daniel Chalmers in 6 different episodes throughout the 5 seasons of Steele, Zimbalist Jr. was a veteran of the small screen, with his first recurring appearance on the TV show Maverick in 1957.\n\nHis first major role after that was on the Warner Brothers show, 77 Sunset Strip, as detective Stu Bailey.While Sunset was memorable, it was his role as Inspector Lewis Erskine on The F.B.I. that made Zimbalist Jr. a household name.\n\nRunning for 9 full seasons, from 1965-1974, he not only made his mark on the procedural television landscape, but also the F.B.I. itself, becoming close personal friends with J.Edgar Hoover until his death in 1972. On Steele, however, his character is the exact opposite of Erskine.\n\nWe are first introduced to Daniel Chalmers in episode 1×21, Sting of Steele, a direct send up of The Sting (1973), the classic heist movie starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford.\n\nChalmers is Steele’s former mentor, in town to gain Steele’s help in protecting him from a crooked casino owner that has followed him across the world seeking vengeance for getting swindled by Chalmers.\n\nIn keeping with the screwball comedy roots of the show, the casino owner has already hired Laura and the Steele Agency to find Chalmers and bring him to justice. Laura’s mother (played by Beverly Garland) also makes an appearance, and finds herself on the receiving end of Chalmers’ affections, much to Laura’s dismay.\n\nChalmers also appears in season four’s two part opener, Steele Searching, working in tandem with Cassandra Harris’ Felicia to keep Steele away from California, and Laura,by extension.\n\nBoth Harris and Zimbalist Jr. were excellent additions to the Remington Steele narrative, and excellent pieces to the puzzle of Steele’s history. Harris did such a great job as a force pulling Steele away from Laura, that it took me a few viewings to look past my dislike of her characters and appreciate her acting.\n\nThough I still find myself confused as to why the writers would write her in as another character before switching her back, I can accept the significance of casting Brosnan’s wife as his former lovers, and how clever that would seem.\n\nAs for my siblings, I have definite plans to cast them in projects I will create in the future. My only hope is that one day, they will consider me to play a role in their projects as well.\n\nSet photos of Pierce Brosnan, Stephanie Zimbalist, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., and Cassandra Harris.\n\nsources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efrem_Zimbalist_Jr.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0956544/awards?ref_=nm_awd\n\nhttp://pbfiles.net/steele/gallery.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Remington_Steele_episodes#Season_1_.281982.E2.80.9383.29"
