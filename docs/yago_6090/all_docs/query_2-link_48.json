        "text": "Not sure true love really exists? Just look at Pierce Brosnan and his wife Keely. 30 years on, they're still as loved-up as ever.\n\nArguably one of our favourite celebrity couples, the Irish-born 007 actor first met the American journalist back in 1994.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nThe couple, who share two sons named Dylan and Paris, tied the knot seven years later at Ballintubber Abbey, Co Mayo.\n\nOn Tuesday, Keely shared a carousel of adorable throwback photos of herself and Pierce throughout the years, writing: '4-8-94 was my lucky day. How could I have know as I walked around the corner and into your life that my destiny was about to change forever?'\n\n'Thanking my lucky stars that I had the courage to introduce myself to you and forever grateful for the connection and family we share three decades later. Happy 30th Anniversary! @piercebrosnanofficial âœ¨ Time flys on loves wings.'\n\nPierce sweetly commented: 'Thank God for you my dear Keely, you have given me wings to fly. Love you dearly.'\n\nBefore they met, the Louth man was married to actress and former Bond girl Cassandra Harris for 11 years, from 1980 until she tragically died in 1991 after a battle with ovarian cancer.\n\nPierce got a second chance at love when he met then-30-year-old journalist Keely Shaye Smith in Mexico in April 1994. Keely had flown out to interview American actor Ted Danson and ended up at a party in Cabo San Lucas where she met her future husband."
