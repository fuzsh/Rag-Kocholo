        "text": "Pierce Brosnan’s estranged son, Christopher Brosnan, made a rare public outing nearly 20 years after his father “cut [him] off” over the latter’s struggle with addiction.\n\nChristopher, 51 — who worked as an assistant director on Pierce’s movies “Tomorrow Never Dies,” (1997) “The World Is Not Enough” (1999) and “Robinson Crusoe” (1997) — was photographed Friday exiting a Waitrose grocery store in London.\n\nThe filmmaker was seemingly alone as he ran the errand.\n\nAlong with a solemn facial expression, Christopher sported a red hoodie beneath an olive green puffer vest, which he paired with navy blue joggers and gray Converse sneakers.\n\nThe UK native’s shaggy brown hair popped out from beneath his navy blue flat cap, which he wore backward.\n\nHe held his phone in one hand and a reusable Waitrose bag in the other as he walked slightly hunched down the street.\n\nChristopher’s biological parents are Pierce’s first wife, Cassandra Harris, and her ex-husband Dermot Harris.\n\nPierce, 71, adopted both Christopher and his late sister, Charlotte Brosnan, after Dermot died in 1986.\n\nAt the time, Pierce — who was the fifth actor to play the fictional secret agent James Bond in the film series — was married to Cassandra, who passed away in 1991 after a battle with ovarian cancer.\n\nPierce and Cassandra had one child together: son Sean Brosnan, 40.\n\nThe Irishman went on to marry his current wife, Keely Shaye Brosnan, in 2001, and they welcomed two sons: Dylan Brosnan, 27, and Paris Brosnan, 23.\n\nChristopher’s drug abuse, overdose and run-ins with the law forced Pierce to distance himself.\n\n“Christopher is still very lost. Shockingly so. I know where he is, but he’s having a hard life,” his dad lamented to Playboy magazine in 2005.\n\n“I can only have strong faith and believe he will recover. He has tested everybody in this family but none more so than himself. He knows how to get out. He doesn’t want to.”\n\nPierce called the ordeal “painful,” adding that it had caused him to “shut down.”\n\n“You never completely cut them off,” he noted, “but I have cut Christopher off. I had to say, ‘Go. Get busy living, or get busy dying.’ He has my prayers.”\n\nDespite their estrangement, Pierce included Christopher in a Father’s Day Instagram post in 2022."
