        "text": "Pierce Brosnan reveals heartache of losing both his wife and daughter to ovarian cancer.\n\nThe 62-year-old Irish actor lost his wife Cassandra Harris to the disease in 1991 after 11 years of marriage.\n\nThe couple have a son, Sean, 33, together, and raised Cassandra's children Charlotte and Christopher, 44, together.\n\nCharlotte tragically passed away from the same disease as her mother 22 years later in 2013.\n\nSpeaking about the loss of two of his family members to cancer, Pierce told Esquire magazine: 'I don't look at the cup as half full, believe me. The dark melancholy Irish black dog sits beside me from time to time.'\n\nThe actor also revealed that keeping his faith helped him get through the loss of the two women.\n\n'That's all you have left when your heart is just a dark hole at four in the morning and you have the weight of the world on your shoulders.'\n\n'No one can escape life's pain. That's life,' the grieving actor heartbreakingly revealed.\n\nPierce got re-married to Keely Shaye Smith in 2001, and the pair have two children together, Dylan 20, and 16-year-old Paris."
