        "text": "Read More\n\nThe couple’s famous friends, like actress Rita Wilson, chimed in on the comments to offer their support. Wilson, a breast cancer survivor, writes, “Happy happy Anniversary, lovebirds!”\n\nBrosnan’s Ovarian Cancer Losses\n\nThe actor's first wife, Cassandra Harris, passed from ovarian cancer in 1991. And in 2013, Pierce and Cassandra's daughter, Charlotte, died of the same disease. Cassandra was 43 when she passed, and her daughter was even younger Charlotte passed at the too-young age of 41.\n\nOvarian cancer has been called \"the cancer that whispers,\" due to its hard-to-detect symptoms. Dr. Beth Karlan, a gynecologic oncologist at UCLA Medical Center, explains in an earlier interview, \"What we've found from multiple studies, it's this constellation of symptoms,\" she said. \"If that's really happening and you're experiencing it every day, and they seem to be crescendo-ing, getting worse, even if that goes on for only two weeks, you should call your doctor.\"\n\nOvarian cancer symptoms may include:\n\nFeeling full earlier/decrease in appetite\n\nFeeling bloated\n\nChanges in bowel habits\n\nPain in the pelvis\n\nUrinary symptoms, such as an urgent need to go\n\nExtreme fatigue\n\nAbdominal swelling\n\nPain during sex\n\nOvarian Cancer: The Cancer That Whispers\n\nWhen a Spouse Has Cancer\n\nA spouse’s cancer diagnosis can feel devastating, as can losing a spouse to cancer. Many people find therapy or support groups to be a helpful component when grieving the loss of a spouse or loved one.\n\nActress and melanoma survivor Jill Kargman believes that a cancer diagnosis can be very telling for a romantic relationship. She says in an earlier interview, \"I think cancer is a great way to find out if you're with the love of your life or a shithead.\"\n\n\"I think it presses the fast forward button on getting to the bottom of that answer, because a lot of people in middle age are kind of at a crossroads, waiting for their kids to fly the coop,\" says Kargman. \"And I think if you're with someone who is not supportive and kind of emotionally checked out or doesn't tell you you're still beautiful with that, this might not be your person.\"\n\nJill Kargman on Relationships and Cancer"
