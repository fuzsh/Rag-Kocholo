        "text": "Pierce Brosnan has opened up about losing his wife Cassandra Harris and daughter Charlotte to ovarian cancer and the challenges of growing up without a father figure.\n\nThe former 007 was married to Cassandra for 11 years before she died in 1991. They had one son Sean, 33, and the Irish actor adopted her two children Charlotte and Christopher, 44.\n\nHe lost Charlotte to the same disease in 2013. Ovarian cancer also claimed the life of his longtime producing partner Beau St Clair last year.\n\nHe told Esquire: \"I don’t look at the cup as half full, believe me.\n\n\"The dark, melancholy Irish black dog sits beside me from time to time.\"\n\nThe Remington Steele star previously told how his faith helped him \"survive the pain\" of losing both.\n\nAt the time of Charlotte's death, he said: \"That's all you have left when your heart is just a dark hole at four in the morning and you have the weight of the world on your shoulders.\n\n\"No one can escape life's pain. That's life.\"\n\nThe Co Meath native has been has been married to former journalist Keely Shaye Smith since 2001. The couple have two kids together, Dylan (20) and Paris (16).\n\nThe ex-James Bond actor also opened up about his challenging relationship with his dad Tom, who left the family soon after he was born.\n\nThe 63-year-old recalled in the candid interview how he had only met him once - when he was back in Ireland filming Remington Steele in 1984.\n\nHe said: \"My fatherly instincts are purely my own. They relate back to no one, because there was no one.\n\n\"I only met Tom the once, I had a Sunday afternoon with him. A story about this and that, had a few pints of Guinness, and we said goodbye.\n\n\"I would have loved to have known him. He was a good whistler and he had a good walk….That’s as much as I know about him.”"
