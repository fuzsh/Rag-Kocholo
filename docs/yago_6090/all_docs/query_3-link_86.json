        "text": "PIERCE Brosnan's estranged son, Christopher, was spotted amid a rare public outing 20 years after he was allegedly \"cut off\" by his father.\n\nChristopher, who publicly struggled with addiction, was spotted Friday while exiting a grocery store.\n\nThe actor, 51, was wearing a red hoodie underneath an olive green puffer vest with navy blue joggers and gray Converse sneakers.\n\nPhotos show Christopher carrying a grocery bag from a Waitrose store in London.\n\nThe UK native, who had a solemn expression, wore his shoulder-length hair tucked under a navy blue flat cap, which he wore backward.\n\nPhotos of the reclusive Brosnan showed him walking with a slight hunch as he carried a reusable Waitrose bag in one hand and his phone in the other.\n\nChristopher was born to Cassandra Harris, and her ex-husband Dermot Harris but was later adopted by the James Bond star in 1986 when Dermot died.\n\nIn addition, the \"Mamma Mia\" actor, 71, also adopted Christopher's late sister — Charlotte Brosnan — when Brosnan married Cassandra in 1980.\n\nChristopher worked with his famous father on several iconic films such as “Tomorrow Never Dies,” (1997) “The World Is Not Enough” (1999), and “Robinson Crusoe” (1997).\n\nTensions between father and son ran high when Christopher's drug abuse, overdose, and run-ins with the law forced the Hollywood actor to distance himself.\n\nIn 2005, the \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" actor spoke about his estranged son.\n\n“Christopher is still very lost. Shockingly so. I know where he is, but he’s having a hard life,” he told Playboy Magazine.\n\n“I can only have strong faith and believe he will recover. He has tested everybody in this family but none more so than himself. He knows how to get out. He doesn’t want to.”\n\nAccording to Brosnan, the entire ordeal was \"painful\" saying that experience made him \"shut down.\"\n\n“You never completely cut them off,” he noted, “but I have cut Christopher off. I had to say, ‘Go. Get busy living, or get busy dying.’ He has my prayers.”\n\nIn 2022, it appeared that both father and son had mended their bond as Christopher paid tribute to his dad in a touching Father's Day post.\n\n“My love forever to you dear sons, Paris, Dylan, Sean, and Christopher,” he captioned a photo of him with the first three.\n\n“Thank you deeply for your love on this Father’s Day.”\n\nIt comes after Pierce Brosnan was pictured looking unrecognizable recently as he prepared for his latest role.\n\nWearing an Adidas tracksuit and white trainers, the 70-year-old looked a world away from his usual dapper roles.\n\nHe was in character as Brandan Ingle, an Irish-born boxing trainer, as he filmed the movie Giant.\n\nBrosnan was filming on location in Yorkshire, northern England, home to cult boxer 'Prince' Naseem Hamed, who Ingle helped train to stardom."
