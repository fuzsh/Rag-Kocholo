Brosnan never knew his father (a carpenter), who upped and left when he was an infant. After Thomas abandoned the family, his mother moved to London to find work as a nurse and provide for her son.\n\nFor most of his childhood, Brosnan lived with his grandparents and grew up in County Meath, which he considers his home. He would later describe this period as a happy but relatively solitary childhood.\n\nGrowing Up in Politically Turbulent Times\n\nBrosnan’s mother made the courageous decision to go away to London on her own when being Catholic was a dangerous thing. She endured plenty of hardship as an unmarried Irish Woman in the city.\n\nBut May was determined to make a better life for herself and her son. She worked hard, making up for the absence of a father figure in her son’s life. May visited once or twice a year to meet her son and his grandparents.\n\nAn Unhappy School Life\n\nWhen his grandparents passed away, Brosnan lived with an uncle and aunt. Soon enough, his relatives no longer had room for him. A young Brosnan ended up boarding at a less-affluent part of town. During this time, he attended a school run by the De La Salle or Christian brothers, whom he would later call “bitter” and “dreadful human beings.”\n\nHe said he had learned nothing from the brothers except shame. A young Brosnan despised his education, particularly the institution’s hypocrisy and cruelty towards children.\n\nHe Leaves Ireland\n\nOn August 12, 1964, Brosnan left Ireland to reunite with his mother, who now lived in Scotland. She had married William Carmichael, a World War II veteran, and the couple lived in an idyllic Scottish village called Longniddrie. Brosnan and Carmichael warmed up to each other, and he quickly became the father figure the boy never had.\n\nAn 11-year-old Brosnan watched a James Bond film for the first time with his new dad. A few years later, the family moved back to London, where Brosnan attended Elliott School in Putney, West London.\n\nHis Move From Ireland to England\n\nLife in England was remarkably different for a boy accustomed to a quiet life in rural Ireland. From a small school with about seven classrooms to one with over 2,000 children, city life proved surreal for a young Brosnan.\n\nThings moved incredibly fast. Brosnan’s deep sense of being an outsider intensified since his schoolmates never let him forget he was Irish. “Irish” was, in fact, the nickname they gave him at school.\n\nHe Worked Unconventional Jobs Before Finding Theater\n\nBrosnan left school at age 16, wanting to become an artist. He enrolled in Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design to train in commercial illustration. In 1969, Brosnan walked into the Oval House for training and chanced on an intriguing workshop.\n\nA fire eater was training his women students to put flames across his chest. Brosnan was fascinated, immediately signing up to learn how to be a fire eater! His smoking hot act eventually caught the attention of a circus worker who hired him for three years. The same agent fixed him up at a drama center that would kickstart his acting career.\n\nBrosnan Finds His Calling\n\nAfter a wildly successful stint as a fire eater, the talented Brosnan trained for three years at the Drama Center in London. Becoming an actor would have the most profound impact on his life.\n\nEven when he was starting, acting, for Brosnan, was freedom — his avenue into a new life. He was deeply passionate about the craft and enjoyed it. Brosnan knew he was born to do this, and soon enough, the world would know it too.\n\nHe Meets Cassandra Harris\n\nShortly after leaving drama school, Brosnan met Australian actor Cassandra Harris at a mutual friend’s house, and the two hit it off. Brosnan wanted to spend more time with her. He never planned to woo her, but their chemistry was undeniable.\n\nThe duo began dating and bought a small house together in Wembley. Brosnan and Harris married in December 1980 and 3 years later, welcomed a third member of the family – their son, Sean, who later became an actor.\n\nBrosnan’s Early Acting Career\n\nAfter graduating from the Drama Center, Brosnan took up an acting assistant stage manager job at the York Theater Royal. He made his acting debut in “Wait Until Dark” (1976). Six months later, the distinguished playwright Tennessee Williams selected Brosnan for the UK premiere of “The Red Devil Battery” (1977).\n\nBrosnan portrayed the role of McCabe, and his stellar performance became the talk of London. Williams reportedly sent Brosnan a telegram after the show with just these words — \"Thank God for you, my dear boy.\"\n\nOn Working With Tennessee Williams\n\nWhat was it like working with Tennessee Williams? Brosnan recounted how the part did not work out for another actor. He received a call saying Tennessee Williams wanted to see him immediately. Brosnan ran out of his flat and onto a bus.\n\nHalfway there, he got off the bus and ran since it was moving too slowly. Brosnan finally got to Williams’s apartment and read through two powerful scenes. Despite his heart pounding, Brosnan decided to let it fly – and he got the job.\n\nHis Early Film Career\n\nBrosnan’s acting career continued to take off after his phenomenal stage debut, and it was not long before the actor caught the eye of film directors. He eventually moved to films and made brief appearances in movies such as “The Long Good Friday” (1980) and “The Mirror Crack'd” (1980).\n\nBrosnan also made his foray into British television around this time. Some of his early works include appearances on “The Professionals” (1980), “Play for Today” (1970-1984), and “Murphy’s Stroke” (1980).\n\nHard Times\n\nPierce and Cassandra lived with Harris’s three children from her previous marriage – whom Brosnan later adopted when their father died. He worried about making ends meet and providing for his family. During this period, he supplemented his income by appearing in television films and working in a company called West End Productions.\n\nThings began looking up when Harris was offered the role of a Bond girl in “For Your Eyes Only” (1981). The couple took a bank loan and moved to Southern California, after which Brosnan auditioned for several TV roles.\n\nPierce Brosnan – U.S. TV Phenomenon\n\nBrosnan’s career as a TV star took off in earnest with a leading role in the popular miniseries “Manions of America” (1981). The series showcased the story of an Irish farmer who immigrated to America following the Great Famine in England. In 1982, the actor followed this up with a stellar performance in a Masterpiece Theater documentary on Lady Nancy Astor – the first woman MP in the British Parliament.\n\nBrosnan’s memorable performance as Robert Gould Shaw II earned him a 1985 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nBrosnan as the Charming Remington Steele\n\nThe actor moved to Southern California in 1982, marking the start of his massive popularity in the United States. Brosnan played the leading role in the NBC detective series “Remington Steele” (1982), winning hearts and legions of fans as the charming detective.\n\nThat same year, the Washington Post prophetically noted how the actor could be a shoo-in to play a young James Bond. “Remington Steele” wrapped up in 1987, and Brosnan continued appearing in several films such as “The Fourth Protocol” (1987), “The Deceivers” (1988), and “The Lawnmower Man” (1992).\n\nHe Meets His Father\n\nBrosnan briefly reunited with his father while he was filming for “Remington Steele” in Ireland. The two met at the hotel Brosnan was staying in at the time. The meeting was very public and did not allow them to reconnect as much as Brosnan would have liked.\n\nHe later expressed regret that he could not meet his father privately on his terms. Although circumstances were not ideal, it was a reunion for the ages.\n\nThe Rise of Pierce Brosnan\n\nThe ‘90s saw the actor consolidate his career in film. In 1992, he shot an NBC pilot called “Running Wilde,” where he played a reporter. The pilot featured Jennifer Love Hewitt as his daughter, but it unfortunately never aired.\n\nIn 1993, he played a supporting role in the hugely popular film “Mrs. Doubtfire.” The actor also appeared in several other films, including “Death Train” (1993) and “Night Watch” (1995), a thriller set in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Makings of James Bond\n\nBrosnan and James Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli first met on the sets of “For Your Eyes Only.” Roger Moore had played James Bond, and Broccoli was looking for another actor to inherit the role. On meeting Brosnan, the producer reportedly said that he might have found his guy – provided Brosnan could act.\n\nFilm circles were also abuzz about Brosnan inheriting another Roger Moore role – that of Simon Templar. The whispering and gossip continued, but nothing concrete happened on either front.\n\nBrosnan Declines the Role of 007\n\nCasting for the next James Bond kicked off in earnest by the later ‘60s. In 1986, producers approached Timothy Dalton for the role, but the actor declined due to ongoing commitments. Broccoli screen-tested several other actors without any success.\n\nOn learning that “Remington Steele” was about to end, Broccoli offered the role to Brosnan. The publicity ended up reviving “Remington Steele,” and Brosnan had to decline the role of James Bond.\n\nBrosnan Becomes the Fifth James Bond\n\nSince Brosnan was not available, Broccoli once again offered the James Bond role to Timothy Dalton, who subsequently appeared in “The Living Daylights” (1987) and “License to Kill” (1989). A third Dalton film was in the works, but producers had to cancel it over legal issues.\n\nWith that, the James Bond franchise went on a six-year hiatus. When producers finally began working on “Golden Eye,” they wrote the film with Dalton in mind, but the actor turned it down. The producers reverted to Plan A, and in June 1994, they announced Brosnan as the fifth actor to play 007.\n\nA Second Chance at Love\n\nBrosnan and Harris spent 17 beautiful years together until she tragically passed away in 1991. Brosnan found love again in 1994 when he met journalist Keely Shaye Smith during a trip to Mexico. The two crossed paths by chance and started dating shortly after.\n\nAfter dating for three years, the happy couple welcomed a son, Dylan Thomas, in January 1997. Five years later, Smith gave birth to their second child, Paris Beckett. The pair finally tied the knot at Ballintubber Abbey, Ireland, in 2010.\n\n“Golden Eye” and Brosnan’s Debut as James Bond\n\nBrosnan made his debut as James Bond in “Golden Eye” (1995) to tremendous critical and commercial acclaim. Critics praised the actor for his natural wit and charm, calling him “a decided improvement” over his predecessor, Timothy Dalton.\n\n“Golden Eye” was the first of a four-film franchise starring Brosnan as 007. It grossed a whopping $350 million worldwide and became the most successful Bond film.\n\nSubsequent Bond Movies and Other Projects\n\nApart from playing the iconic role of 007, Brosnan also formed a film production company during this period. The actor partnered with Beau St. Clair in 1996 and founded “Irish DreamTime.” In 1999, the company released its first project, “The Thomas Crown Affair,” which received rave reviews from fans and critics alike.\n\nBrosnan obviously returned as Bond in the blockbusters “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997) and “The World Is Not Enough” (1999). In 2002, Brosnan portrayed James Bond for the fourth time in “Die Another Day.” Would the actor appear in a fifth Bond film? When interviewed, Brosnan revealed he was keen to do another.\n\nHe Appears in Several Films\n\nWhen Brosnan accepted the role of James Bond, he asked EON Productions to allow him to work on other projects between the Bond movies. Subsequently, Brosnan appeared in other mainstream movies – including the ones he produced.\n\nFor every Bond film, the actor appeared in at least two other movies. Some of his appearances during this period included Tim Burton’s “Mars Attacks” (1996), “Dante’s Peak” (1997), and “Grey Owl” (1999).\n\nA Fifth Bond Film — Will He or Won’t He?\n\nSoon after “Die Another Day” was released, media speculation was rife about whether Brosnan would reprise the role of James Bond for the fifth time. The actor was hopeful since there was precedent. Sean Connery had previously done six Bond films. Brosnan also knew that one actor playing the same role for too long wasn’t the best idea.\n\nCase in point, Roger Moore, who played James Bond until age 58 – earning him flak from critics and fans. Still, Brosnan remained enthusiastic and touched by the overwhelming public support for a potential fifth film.\n\nPierce Brosnan, OBE\n\nIn 2003, Brosnan received an honorary OBE from the late Queen Elizabeth II for \"outstanding contribution to the British film industry.\" Brosnan was not eligible to receive full OBE honors owing to his Irish citizenship. This honor is unfortunately reserved only for citizens of the Commonwealth countries.\n\nShortly after, Brosnan also received honorary degrees from two institutions — the Dublin Institute of Technology in 2003 and the University College Cork in 2004.\n\nThe 007 Video Games\n\nDuring his time with the James Bond film franchise, Brosnan appeared not only in the films but also in several Bond video games. Game creators used Brosnan’s likeness for “Nightfire.” He became the face of James Bond in the popular video game while Maxwell Caulfield voiced the character.\n\nIn 2004, Brosnan starred in another Bond game called “Everything or Nothing.” The game used his likeness and voice work for the character.\n\nBrosnan Is “Finished” With Bond\n\nThroughout 2004, fans hoped to hear confirmation that Brosnan would reprise the role for the fifth time. Nobody could have anticipated what was coming. Rumors spread about negotiations breaking down. Producers allegedly wanted to bring in someone new, possibly younger, but continued denying the claims.\n\nIn July 2004, Brosnan officially announced that he was quitting, stating that he was moving on to new things and the role was another lifetime ago. Many people correctly presumed this statement was an outcome of failed negotiations.\n\nHe Was Fired Without Ceremony\n\nBrosnan’s feelings about not reprising the role of James Bond emerged a few months later. In October 2004, Brosnan revealed that the producers had fired him — completely blindsiding the actor who, until then, believed negotiations were proceeding as planned.\n\nBrosnan posted on his website about the end of his tenure as Bond but looked forward to seeing Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. Craig officially took over the role of 007 on October 14, 2005.\n\nWhy He Was Fired\n\nThe dismissal from the Bond films came as a shock to Brosnan. He was filming in the Bahamas when his agent called to say negotiations for the fifth Bond film had stopped. A few days later, Brosnan and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson spoke on the phone. They said they were sorry. He had been a great James Bond.\n\nA shocked Brosnan slowly realized he had been kicked to the curb. Some sources believed the negotiations fell apart because Brosnan asked for too much money. The producers decided to take a new approach to the character, with Daniel Craig playing a grittier 007.\n\nPost-Bond Film Appearances\n\nLife after Bond was far from quiet for the inimitable Pierce Brosnan. He appeared in several films, playing roles distinctly unlike the character that had come to define him. Brosnan played Daniel Rafferty in “Laws of Attraction” (2004) – his first big film appearance after the Bond franchise.\n\nBrosnan received critical acclaim for the role. The next film, “After the Sunset” (2004), opposite Salma Hayek, did not do as well and it received overwhelmingly negative reviews from fans and critics.\n\nHe Becomes a U.S. Citizen\n\nBrosnan became a citizen of the United States in 2004 but chose to retain his Irish citizenship. During an interview, Brosnan shared that Irishness would forever be in his blood. He said the Irish spirit defines who he is as a man, father, and actor.\n\nWhen a fan asked if it annoyed him that people thought he was English, the actor responded that it did not bother him. Yet, it amused him how a dyed-in-the-wool Irishman like him could be confused for an Englishman!\n\nThe Politics of Pierce Brosnan\n\nWhen he’s not acting, Brosnan is a vocal advocate for numerous causes. He supported John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential elections and he is also an outspoken advocate for many controversial issues. Among the matters closest to him is environmental conservation.\n\nThe actor has worked closely with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). He also partnered with the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) to prevent the construction of a proposed salt factory at Laguna San Ignacio.\n\nOne Of His Best Performances Yet\n\nBrosnan next appeared in a film called “The Matador” (2004). The film – a critical and commercial success – saw Brosnan play Julian Noble – a cynical assassin who encounters a traveling salesman in a bar. Critics went so far as to call his performance the best of his career yet.\n\n“The Matador” earned Brosnan a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical Comedy. He eventually lost to Joaquin Phoenix, who won the award for “Walk the Line” (2005).\n\nA Series of Hits And Misses\n\nBrosnan's next film was “Seraphim Falls” (2006) in which he starred alongside fellow Irish actor Liam Neeson. Set in post-Civil War America, the film appeared to be an homage to old Western films, with the plot focusing on a bounty hunt for a Union soldier.\n\nThe film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006 and was released in US theatres for limited screenings in 2007. It received lukewarm reviews, despite the combined acting prowess of Brosnan and Neeson, who critics described as “fine adversaries” on screen.\n\nPierce Brosnan, the Artist\n\nMost people know that Brosnan trained as an artist early on but shifted to acting, which was his true calling. But the actor took up painting again during his first wife’s battle with a severe medical condition. After withdrawing from acting to care for her, Brosnan began painting as therapy.\n\nHe continued painting even after Harris’s death. Profits from sales of his artwork have gone to a trust that supports environmental, women’s health, and children’s charities. To honor his wife’s memory, Brosnan is a passionate advocate for cancer awareness, serving as a spokesperson for various breast cancer charities and fundraisers.\n\nBrosnan Campaigns for Marine Conservation and Wins\n\nIn 2007, Brosnan won a significant fight in the battle for the environment. The actor, with fellow celebrities such as Halle Berry, Daryl Hannah, and Cindy Crawford, successfully campaigned against the proposed Cabrillo Port Liquefied Natural Gas facility. The proposed plan to build the facility off the coast of Malibu posed grave threats to marine life in the area.\n\nAfter reviewing the proposal, the State Lands Commission denied permission for construction. In May 2007, then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger officially vetoed the facility.\n\nPierce Brosnan Cannot Sing!\n\nIn 2008, Brosnan starred alongside Meryl Streep in “Mamma Mia!,” the film adaption of the ABBA musical. He played Sam Carmichael, one of the three men who could be Sophie’s (Amanda Seyfried) father. Brosnan allegedly trained for the role by singing karaoke while walking up and down the coast for weeks.\n\nHe followed it up with rehearsals in New York. Still, however, his singing was sadly not up to par with his acting talents. Critics disparaged his vocal abilities or lack thereof, saying that his singing sounded like a wounded raccoon or a water buffalo.\n\nHe Opens Up About Life After Losing His First Wife\n\nFollowing his first wife’s passing, the actor opened up about coping with loss. In a 2008 interview, Brosnan explained that he began to view everything differently after his wife was diagnosed with her illness — from everyday routine to how he viewed life.\n\nHe shared how the family cherished every moment with her, and how she was incredibly positive and energetic until the very end.\n\nBrosnan’s Troubles With an Indian Breath Freshener Brand\n\nIn 2016, Brosnan found himself embroiled in an unlikely controversy with an Indian brand called “Pan Bahar.” The actor had featured in an advertising campaign for “pan masala,” a traditional Indian post-meal breath freshener. The mixture usually contains spices, seeds, herbs, and nuts wrapped in betel leaf. His involvement became controversial because pan masala consumption had never been considered a healthy habit in India.\n\nMany experts linked pan masala consumption to tobacco addiction which could cause medical conditions. Brosnan issued an apology, saying the company had never disclosed the harmful effects of pan consumption.\n\nHis Daughter, Charlotte, Passes Away\n\nIn 2017, Brosnan's daughter Charlotte tragically passed away from the same disease that had taken her mother, Cassandra, in 1991. Charlotte was 41 and left behind her husband, Alex, and two children, Isabella and Lucas.\n\nA year earlier, Brosnan had opened up about starring in “Love Is All You Need” (2012). It was a hauntingly personal film where he played a widower in love with a hairdresser suffering from a disease.\n\nOn Being a Family Man\n\nDuring a 2018 interview with Closer, Brosnan shared his views on finding the right partner. He opened up about being a married man for most of his life, and that’s how he liked it. Contrary to his 007 persona, Brosnan had always been a one-woman man.\n\nHe shared how he’s all about trusting and following his heart and relying on a strong woman in his life. His equally smitten wife said that the best part about Brosnan was his intelligence and beautiful soul.\n\nHis Take on a Female 007\n\nIn 2019, Brosnan caused a stir for endorsing the idea of a female 007. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter if he thought men should get out of the way, he agreed unequivocally – saying the guys had done it for over four decades. A female 007 would be exhilarating.\n\nBut Brosnan believed the idea might not see the light of day under the present custodians of Ian Fleming’s character. He was referring to Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of EON Productions.\n\nHis Foray Into OTT\n\nBrosnan’s next appearance was for a supporting role in Netflix’s “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,” (2020). The film was supposed to coincide with the 2020 contest but production stalled. Given his infamous performance in “Mamma Mia!,” some quarters were keen to know if he would sing again.\n\nBrosnan’s singing had been so memorable that it earned him the 2009 Razzie for worst supporting actor. In an interview for the Guardian in 2020, Brosnan good-naturedly quipped that he was “crestfallen” at not getting the chance to sing on screen again.\n\nOn Mrs. Doubtfire and Robin Williams\n\nDuring a 2020 interview, Brosnan shared how he found the strength to keep acting after his wife died. Landing a role in “Mrs. Doubtfire” (1993) was a pivotal moment. Any actor would want to look back and have a handful of films they were proud to participate in.\n\n“Mrs. Doubtfire” was that film for Brosnan. He spoke fondly of the late Robin Williams, who greeted him in a makeup trailer in full Mrs. Doubtfire makeup!\n\nOn Working With Roman Polanski\n\nIn 2010, Brosnan portrayed the role of a fictional British Prime Minister accused of war crimes in Roman Polanski’s “The Ghost Writer.” Brosnan took on the part due to Polanski’s body of work as a director and artist.\n\nIn an interview decades later, the actor was asked whether he would make the same choices. He said he did not know. Back then, he did not allow the director’s personal life to influence his artistic choices. Things were different today.\n\nHe Stars in “Cinderella”\n\nIn 2021, Brosnan played the role of King Rowan in “Cinderella” – Amazon Prime’s bold retelling of an ancient tale. In an online interview, Brosnan shares how he loved the fresh take on his character. The actor believed producers had taken an old story and created something empowering and beautiful for the modern woman.\n\nThe musical featured the likes of Camilla Cabello, Idina Menzel, and Billy Porter. Despite the star-studded cast, there were sadly no takers for the girl power version of “Cinderella.”\n\nHis Advice to Daniel Craig\n\n“No Time to Die” (2020) was Daniel Craig’s fifth outing as Bond, with previous films being “Casino Royale” (2006), “Quantum of Solace” (2008), “Skyfall” (2012), and “Spectre” (2015). During a 2021 interview, Craig revealed that Pierce Brosnan’s advice saw him through every Bond film.\n\nAll he said was, “Enjoy it. It’s a ride.” Craig quickly realized that was all he could do while embodying the iconic role. Brosnan also congratulated Daniel at a watch party for the film, saying he had done a magnificent job.\n\nHe Defends His Wife Against Body Shaming\n\nBrosnan has never shied away from expressing his love for his wife. And he does not take kindly to people bullying her. Social media trolls discovered this the hard way when he defended Smith from fat shaming online. A Facebook user shared two before and after pictures of the couple, with some comments suggesting weight loss surgery for the mother of two.\n\nShockingly, the comments advocating surgery came from friends and family. The user deleted the post, but not before Brosnan rose to his wife’s defense. He wrote how he always sought to be worthy of her love, calling her “the most beautiful woman.”\n\nJames Bond Joins the DC Universe\n\nIn 2022, the DC Extended Universe announced the release of the highly anticipated “Black Adam” movie, with Dwayne Johnson in the starring role. Pierce Brosnan was joining the DCEU as the magical superhero, Doctor Fate. The former 007 is no stranger to action-oriented work. But his role as the Kent Nelson incarnation of Doctor Fate was intriguing.\n\nProducers knew Brosnan was perfect for the part. “You need a special actor to play, basically, a legend. Dr. Fate is a very powerful being, so you need someone like Pierce who can play powerful without it being overly done,” said director Jaume Collet-Serra.\n\nPierce Brosnan Is Unrecognisable in “The Rifleman”\n\nIn 2022, online publications released the first pictures from the set of Brosnan’s new film, “The Rifleman.” Brosnan plays an 89-year-old World War II veteran who escapes from his care home in Northern Ireland. His character journeys to France to pay his respects to his wife, who lost her life during the war.\n\nPictures showed Brosnan in facial prosthetics and a balding, grey wig for the part. The film is based on a true story about Bernard Jordan, who made the pilgrimage to France in 2014.\n\nHere We Go Again...\n\nOK, so it's been a few years now, but we think it's worth mentioning that Pierce Brosnan didn't only star in \"Mamma Mia!.\" He also starred in the long-awaited sequel, \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,\" which came out ten years later.\n\nWhat was cool about this sequel was that a lot of the cast from the first movie returned, while a bunch of new additions also came along for the ride the second time around. And while there is no confirmation, Pierce has said that he'd be more than happy to sign up if a third installment was in the works.\n\nHe Was in That Eurovision Movie\n\nIf Pierce Brosnan has proven anything since his Bond years were over, it's that he can make an audience laugh. His comedic chops were certainly not a skill that most people associated with him until recently. In 2020, the seasoned veteran starred alongside the likes of Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams in the hilarious comedy based on the Eurovision Song Contest, aptly titled \"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.\"\n\nIn this funny flick, Brosnan plays Erick Erickssong, the father of Ferrell's character Lars. Don't ask us how Brosnan could ever play Ferrell's dad in a movie, but we must say, it does work.\n\nTurning to Prestige TV\n\nIn this day and age, starring in a TV show is just as respectable as leading a blockbuster movie. So it should come as no surprise that Pierce Brosnan wanted to try his luck in prestige TV when he landed the lead role in the series \"The Son.\" This show is set in the 1800s and is about a young boy who is adopted by Comanches and ends up becoming a notorious oilman.\n\nBrosnan got the opportunity to star alongside the likes of Henry Garrett and Zahn McClarnon, while also working with top-tier TV directors such as Daniel Sackheim and Tom Harper. Although the show only ran for two seasons, it developed a pretty dedicated fan base, with many urging for the show to return for a third season.\n\nEntering the World of Netflix\n\nAnother piece of evidence of Pierce Brosnan's ability to crack jokes was on full display when he showed up for the funny Netflix movie \"The Out-Laws.\" It basically follows this soon-to-be-wed couple, with the girlfriend asking the boyfriend to meet her parents (played by Brosnan and Ellen Barkin).\n\nIt is soon revealed though that they are a duo of criminals who rob banks in their free time. There is no denying that the film had all the makings to be a classic. Alas, it wasn't, but it was watched by a lot of people on Netflix. And that's a win these days.\n\nEnjoying His Home Country\n\nWhenever Pierce Brosnan gets a chance to return to his home country of Ireland, he will make it happen. Of course, in an ideal world, he'd simply go back there for some relaxation and to hang out with loved ones. But sometimes, he also gets the opportunity to work during his time on the Emerald Isle.\n\nTake this instance, for example, when Brosnan was filming one of his more recent movies, \"The Four Letters of Love.\" This photo was taken on Mullaghderg Beach and it signified the end of filming for the movie. Of course, he got the chance to have a romantic moment with Keely along the way.\n\nAn Active Member of the Acting Community\n\nWorking in Hollywood can help you build all kinds of friendships, and while Pierce Brosnan and Jessica Chastain being friends wouldn't have been on our bingo card, it happens to be a reality. Brosnan was pleased to watch Chastain performing in the critically acclaimed play \"A Doll's House\" on Broadway.\n\nHe was so impressed with her performance that he just had to praise her in person. \"Jessica you are luminous and spellbinding as Nora in this dream of a production. Each and every cast member an inspiration adding to the alchemy of what we do as actors,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Heartfelt thanks for a breathtaking performance and night to remember!\"\n\nPainting with Paris\n\nAs we previously mentioned, Pierce Brosnan has taken a lot of comfort from painting over the years. So much so that it has taken him down some interesting avenues. And you know what they say - like father, like son.\n\nWell, this could not be any truer as far as Pierce and his son Paris are concerned. Paris has taken after his father in that respect for sure, embracing his passion and skill with a paintbrush. The two love nothing more than having painting sessions together and often come up with some truly captivating pieces of work. He's taught his son well.\n\nHis Pride and Joy\n\nPierce and Keely are so proud of everything their children have achieved and are always first in line to sing their praises. Here, we see the happily married couple showing off their son Paris during his graduation at Loyola Marymount University School of Film & Television.\n\nThe couple is convinced that Paris has got what it takes to follow in his father's footsteps and take the world of acting and entertainment by storm. \"Go into the world with a brave heart and create stories that will make the world a better place,\" Brosnan wrote. We can definitely see Paris carrying on the Brosnan family legacy in a big way.\n\nTurning 70 in Style\n\nMany people who celebrate their 70th birthday might have a party of some kind. But this is Pierce Brosnan we're talking about. The iconic superstar decided to do things a little differently for this major milestone in his life.\n\nDuring the week of his 70th, Brosnan opened up an exhibition of some of his latest art, which he titled \"So Many Dreams.\" As far as Pierce was concerned, there was no other way that he would have wanted to celebrate this big day of his, and apparently, there was a pretty big turnout. And of course, Keely was by his side every step of the way.\n\nTraveling With His Boy\n\nTruth be told, Pierce Brosnan has always been a lover of traveling and exploring new places. Of course, this comes with the territory of playing James Bond. 007 is always doing missions in multiple countries in any given film. So it makes sense to see Brosnan continuing that tradition later on in life.\n\nHere, we can see the seasoned actor posing in front of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Italy, alongside his beloved boy, Paris. As you can see, his son has the same kind of gravitas when it comes to striking a pose in front of the camera. And while the weather wasn't amazing that day, Pierce was just grateful to be on vacation with his son.\n\nDon't Sleep on \"Fast Charlie\"\n\nThe movie showbiz is very unpredictable. Sometimes, you shoot for the stars and splash the cash on a truly terrible movie like \"Black Adam.\" And other times, you show up for a low-budget action thriller like \"Fast Charlie\" that has the most limited of runs at the theater. Pierce Brosnan starred in both of these movies, the latter of which turned out to be a much better-received project.\n\n\"Fast Charlie\" is about a hitman who survives a hit on him, seeking revenge along the way. It's surprising how good this film actually is, with great performances from Brosnan and Morena Baccarin. While it didn't do so well commercially, the critics absolutely loved it.\n\nSome Legal Trouble in Yellowstone\n\nWhile Pierce Brosnan was always a bit of a maverick as 007, we had no idea that he's also had some close shaves with the law, and as recently as 2024. Brosnan was charged with illegally entering the thermal area at Yellowstone National Park. Apparently, the actor found his way into the Mammoth Terraces where there are plenty of hot springs.\n\nWhile he's not the first to break such rules, Brosnan is certainly one of the most famous culprits of this minor crime. He pleaded not guilty. At the time, he had been filming the movie Unholy Trinity with Samuel L. Jackson. nearby in Montana. Speaking of which...\n\nAn Unholy Alliance\n\nAt the time that this was written, \"Unholy Trinity\" still hadn't reached the theaters. But when you consider the fact that this is a movie pitting Pierce Brosnan up against the one and only Samuel L. Jackson in a Western epic, how could you not turn it down?\n\nAnd when you consider the fact that other stars such as Ethan Peck and David Arquette are involved, we imagine that this will be a home run. Of course, this is the movie we were referring to that Pierce got into a little trouble while he was off-set in Yellowstone National Park. We hope that run-in with the law doesn't cause any bad publicity that hinders the movie's success. Only time will tell.\n\nBeing a Grandfather\n\nIt's strange to think that the man who once played Bond and was busy getting the girl and stopping the bad guys is now a grandfather. Actually, Pierce Brosnan has four grandkids to his name, and he loves them all in equal measure. In 2023, Brosnan welcomed his fourth grandchild into the world, a beautiful boy by the name of Jaxxon Elijah Brosnan.\n\nJaxxon is the son of Pierce's boy Sean and his wife Sanja, who are also parents to Marley May. But Brosnan also has two older grandchildren from his late daughter Charlotte - Isabella and Lucas. He tries to dedicate as much time to all of them as possible.\n\nA Couple of Models\n\nIt's not strange for actors to do a bit of modeling on the side, whether it be for a fragrance or a fashion label of some kind. And Pierce Brosnan has been in plenty of photoshoots over the years. Not to mention the fact that he's often been considered to be one of the most well-dressed men of his generation. And it seems like the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\n\nTogether, Pierce and his son Paris have done modeling together for the casual sportswear fashion label Paul & Shark. Here, the father-son duo poses for the Father and Son Tale shoot, \"where the deliberately neutral indoor setting places the profound essence of such an authentic relationship of complicity at the center of the story.\""
