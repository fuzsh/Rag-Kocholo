        "text": "Pierce Brosnan has never been shy about declaring his love for his wife, Keely Shaye Smith, who still leaves him 'weak' at the knees decades into their marriage.\n\nNow his anniversary post to his 'darling' sweetheart Keely, 60, has left fans positively swooning. Taking to Instagram, Irish actor Pierce, 71, paid tribute to his wife of 23 years and mother of two of his sons, praising her as his 'beautiful brown-eyed girl'.\n\nThe James Bond icon wrote: \"Happy 23rd anniversary my darling Keely. My beautiful brown-eyed girl, my north, my south, my east and west. All my love, should I fall behind wait for me.\"\n\nThe post included nostalgic throwback pics, as well as more recent snaps, showcasing how their love for each other has stayed strong amid plenty of grief and heartbreak. Here, the Mirror takes a look at Pierce and Keely's love story, from their romantic first meeting to their joy at 'growing old' side by side...\n\nRomantic first meeting\n\nIn 1991, Pierce lost his first wife, the Australian actress Cassandra Harris to ovarian cancer. She was just 43 years old at the time of her passing and left behind their three children, Charlotte, Christopher, and Sean. This was a dark time for Pierce, who'd loved his first wife dearly, but in 1994, love illuminated his life once more.\n\nPierce and Keely first locked eyes in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico in 1994, where then-TV correspondent Keely had been sent to interview Cheers icon Ten Danson. The pair crossed paths at a party, and sparks soon flew. Remembering her first impression of Pierce during a 2001 interview with People magazine, lovestruck Keely revealed: \"He was captivating. Tall, dark and handsome–everything that everybody would immediately be attracted to. He had this mischievous sparkle in his eyes. I thought, 'Wow! Wow!'\"\n\nA few days later, the future spouses had their first-ever date - holding hands under the stars just as though they were in their very own Hollywood movie. Keely remembered: \"We sat down under the stars and he held my hand. There were fireworks going off over our heads, and Kenny Loggins was singing. We talked until three in the morning. I understand why women find him sexy because he is an appealing man. He really likes and appreciates women.\"\n\nPierce was of course equally bowled over by Keely. In a 2018 interview withCloser, Pierce admitted he still felt 'weak' around his strong wife, divulging: \"I had a great marriage which sadly had its own ending, and I was lucky enough to find love again. We were meant to find each other. I thank God for her every day. When Keely looks at me, I go weak. I love her vitality, her passion. She has this strength that I wouldn't be able to live without.\"\n\nHe proceeded to declare: \"I'm one of those guys who believes you need a strong woman in your life. I found a great woman in Keely. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.\"\n\nParenthood\n\nIn 1997, Pierce and Keely welcomed their first child together, a son named Dylan in 1997, followed by another son Paris in 2001. Making time for his children is especially important for Pierce, whose own father left the family home when he was very young.\n\nSpeaking openly with the Gentleman's Journal in 2021, Pierce shared: \"I cherish family very much. I cherish being a father. I did not grow up with a father figure or with a solid family. There was deep fracture, a certain isolation and an aloneness which wielded the wonderful power of my imagination. I had to get by on my own sensing and intuition. So I value and love the family.\"\n\nFairytale wedding\n\nThe lovebirds said 'I do' at the majestic Ballintubber Abbey in Ireland's County Mayo in 2001, and 23 years down the line, they are every bit as smitten. In celebration of their anniversary, Keely too penned an adoring tribute to her hubby, alongside some gorgeous wedding snaps, writing: \"You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest person I have ever known.\n\n\"Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together. May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flies on love's wings.\"\n\nGrowing old together\n\nPierce has previously shared his joy at 'growing old' side by side with his beloved Keely, while sharing the secret to their happy marriage. In December 2023, Pierce told Fox News: \"We like each other a lot. We love each other a lot. And we've been down the road, and we've seen many, many hardships as families do, as we all do.\"\n\nHe continued: \"But watching someone grow up with you and grow old with you is a very spiritual journey. To watch each other change … whatever it may be, the hair, the waist. But it's the love in the heart.\"\n\nStrength during tragedy\n\nIn June 2013, Pierce suffered yet another terrible tragedy after losing his daughter Charlotte to ovarian cancer - the same illness that killed her mother. Mum-of-two Charlotte was only 41 years old when she passed away, just two years younger than Cassandra had been. The painful parallels of these incalculable losses were not lost on bereaved dad Pierce.\n\nOpening up about Charlotte and Cassandra's deaths during a 2014 Stand Up To Cancer telethon, Pierce reflected: \"To watch someone you love have his or her life eaten away bit by bit by this insidious disease, that kind of sorrow becomes an indelible part of your psyche.\n\n\"I held the generous, strong, beautiful hand of my first wife Cassie as ovarian cancer took her life much too soon. And just last year, I held the hand of my funny, wonderful daughter Charlotte before she too died from this wretched, inherited disease.\"\n\nThrough his intense grief, caring wife Keely has been there for Pierce every step of the way, and he credits her with helping to mend his broken heart. Shedding some light on Keely's healing influence in a 2013 interview with the Mail Online, Pierce shared: \"Keely has always been kind and compassionate and encouraged me to mourn Cassie. [...] I've always been a positive thinker. I suppose Keely is my North Star, always looking out for me.\""
