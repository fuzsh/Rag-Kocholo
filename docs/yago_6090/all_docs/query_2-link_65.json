        "text": "Pierce Brosnan’s daughter Charlotte has died of ovarian cancer, the same disease that took her mother, Cassandra Harris, in 1991. She was 41.\n\n“On June 28 at 2 p.m. my darling daughter Charlotte Emily passed on to eternal life, having succumbed to ovarian cancer,” Brosnan, 60, said in a statement to People. She was surrounded by her husband, her two children and her two brothers.\n\nCharlotte had battled the disease for three years.\n\nPHOTOS: Notable deaths 2013\n\n“Charlotte fought her cancer with grace and humanity, courage and dignity. Our hearts are heavy with the loss of our beautiful dear girl,” said the man who had played James Bond four times.\n\n“We pray for her and that the cure for this wretched disease will be close at hand soon. We thank everyone for their heartfelt condolences.”\n\nCharlotte and Christopher, Harris’ children from a previous marriage, were adopted by Brosnan in 1980, when the actor married their mother, according to Parade. They had son Sean, 29, together.\n\n“The Thomas Crown Affair” and “Remington Steele” actor married his current wife, Keely Shaye Smith, in 2001. They have two children together: Dylan, 16, and Paris, 12.\n\n“The worst thing that could have happened to me happened,” Brosnan told Parade in 1995, speaking of Harris’s death. “Only the loss of a child must be more devastating.”\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times\n\nBrosnan talked to the Daily Mirror about his 2012 film, “Love Is All You Need,” earlier this year. It’s about a widower who falls in love with a hairdresser struggling with cancer, and he said his personal experience fueled his performance.\n\n“I went through it all, very publicly,” Brosnan said of his wife Cassandra’s death. “Such things draw a mark across your heart and it’s always a part of your life.\n\n“To watch someone you love have their life eaten away — bit by bit, by this insidious and horrid disease — becomes an indelible part of your psyche.”\n\nCharlotte is survived by her husband, Alex Smith, and her children, Isabella, 15, and Lucas, 8.\n\n[For the record, 12:15 July 2: This post originally said Brosnan was in two James Bond films. In fact, he played the character four times.]\n\nALSO:\n\nKyra Sedgwick cuts off fingertip in clash with kale\n\nHenry Cavill, Kaley Cuoco reportedly dating, having ‘a great time’\n\nJennifer Lopez apologizes for serenade of Turkmenistan president\n\nFollow Christie D’Zurilla on Twitter and Google+.
