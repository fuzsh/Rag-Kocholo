        "text": "Pierce Brosnan has shared a sweet birthday tribute to his wife Keely in a rare acknowledgment of his low-key personal life.\n\nThe Irish actor took to Instagram on Monday to celebrate the birthday of his wife, Keely Shaye Smith, to whom he has been married for over twenty years.\n\nPierce posted a candid shot of the American filmmaker making a refreshing beverage after a dip in the water, much to the delight of his 1.6m followers. The tropical photo provides a rare insight into the celebrity couple's private relationship, which dates back to a chance encounter at a party in 1994.\n\nPierce, now 68, captioned the image, \"My beautiful luscious love Keely on her 58th trip around the sun yesterday ‚Ä¶apres swim, making coconut water.üí•‚ù§Ô∏èüí•‚ù§Ô∏èüí• Happiest of birthdays it was! üí•üí•üí•.\" The adorable shout-out comes just a month after Pierce Brosnan celebrated his 20th wedding anniversary with a romantic tribute to his beloved wife.\n\nThe birthday message was quickly noticed by fans, who didn't waste time sharing their kind words with Keely. Many were quick to celebrate the husband and wife duo's long-lasting relationship, which now spans the course of three decades.\n\n\"So nice and refreshing to see a totally natural picture, I love it‚Äîyou two are couple goals üòç‚ù§Ô∏è Keeley is truly beautiful x,\" one follower wrote.\n\n\"Happy birthday!! Blessings for such a beautiful couple!\" another well-wisher commented.\n\nWho is Pierce Brosnan's wife?\n\nPierce married Keely Shaye Smith back in August 2001, in a church ceremony at the historic Ballintubber Abbey in County Mayo, Ireland. The pair immediately connected after meeting in the mid-'90s at a party in Mexico and quickly embarked on an exciting long-distance romance.\n\n\"Wherever I went in the world I missed her, and I‚Äôd send her tickets to come so we could be together. We just seemed to fit,\" Pierce told People magazine. ‚ÄúI found a great woman in Keely Shaye. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.‚Äù\n\nPierce and Keely have two sons together, Dylan, 24, and Paris, 20. The transatlantic couple resides primarily in Malibu but also owns residences in Hawaii and Ireland.\n\nWho was Pierce Brosnan's first wife?\n\nPierce was married to the late Cassandra Harris, from 1980 until her death in 1991. The Australian actress, best known for her role in the 1981 Bond film, For Your Eyes Only, died of ovarian cancer four years after she was first diagnosed. She and Pierce had one son together, Sean Brosnan.\n\nCassandra also had two children, Charlotte and Christopher, from a previous marriage, who were both adopted by Pierce after their father died. Charlotte tragically also lost her life to ovarian cancer in 2013 at the age of 42."
