        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Actress Cassandra Harris Brosnan, wife of television star Pierce Brosnan, died Saturday of complications from cancer, a family spokesman said. She was 39.\n\nThe Australian-born former model, who had waged a four-year battle with ovarian cancer, died at the USC-Norris Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, spokesman Dick Guttman said.\n\nA tall beauty who was featured in Lord Partrick Lichfield's book 'The World's Most Beautiful Women,' Brosnan starred with Roger Moore in the James Bond film 'For Your Eyes Only.'\n\nShe met her Irish-born husband after she arrived in England to join the National Theatre following a television and film career in Australia.\n\nThe couple moved to Los Angeles following his casting in the 'Remington Steele' television series.\n\nHer acting in Hollywood -- where she concentrated on rearing the couple's three children -- was limited primarily to her recurring role as Steele's ex-mistress and expert conwoman, Felicia.\n\nBrosnan, whose picture appeared on the covers of British Vogue and other publications, began her acting career as a child in her native Sydney at the Independent Theatre, which also launched the careers of Peter Finch and Dame Judith Anderson.\n\nIn addition to her performances at England's National Theatre, she starred in such British television productions as 'All Out of Kangaroo Valley' and 'Dick Barton.'\n\nIn addition to her husband, she is survived by their three children, Charlotte, 19, Christopher, 18, and Sean William, 7."
