        "text": "Last Tuesday, I finished my final presentation on Romans and other New Testament concepts. This concluded the last 10 months that I have spent in the Watermark Community Church Institute growing my desire for the Lord, refining my gifts and skills, and being more thoroughly equipped in understanding and application of Doctrine. I have learned a ton this last year, but the one thing I am more sure of now than ever is how much more I have to learn. Some amazing people have invested time and wisdom into me this year, and I wanted to share a few things from them that I will be taking with me: - Contentment, security, and detachment from your own self image is one of the greatest qualities you can bring to a team and an organization. - It’s easy to think you don’t have an identity problem until the thing you had put your identity in is taken away from you. - Know who you are. Be who you are. Like who you are. - Don’t presume you deserve to be treated a certain way. - Sift through feedback, even if you don’t like the way it was delivered. - Gratitude and teachability are vital attitudes to carry toward your employer/manager. - Building trust is everything - relationally, spiritually, and professionally. - Be a dead end for gossip. What you say and think about other people matters greatly. - Use your gifts to serve not impress. - Engage with people in their story. - There are countless sources of discouragement in this life. An encouraging word to a friend or teammate is powerful. - Excellence: Doing the best we can, with what we have. - Learn from the lessons of the people around you as much as your own. - God will give mission, purpose and contentment wherever he leads us. - And lastly, Proverbs 18:22 - “He who finds a wife [who pays for our bills for the first 6 months of marriage], finds a good thing.” Thank you Macy Westover! More career updates to come!"
