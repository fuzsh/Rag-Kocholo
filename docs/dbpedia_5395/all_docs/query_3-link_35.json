        "text": "By me\n\nOn the whole, I normally do not get much in the way of opportunity to scribble about the operational aspects of flying (and aviation in general) here in Croatia. Most of the time our pedestrian aviation scene simply doesn’t produce any material worth writing home about, while the country’s mostly pleasant terrain and climate – despite my regular rantings 😀 – also leave little in the way of excitement 🙂 .\n\nOn 30 July however, my hand was suddenly forced into action by the arrival of cyclone Melisa, another in an increasingly unusual string of low pressure systems to hit the region of late. Having made landfall on a broad front between the Adriatic towns of Pula and Zadar, Melisa had initially seemed to be a strong – but otherwise generally harmless – rainstorm, which would leave behind the occasional flooded street, but little else. However, news reports from Zadar had quickly revealed that this was no usual event, with the nearby island of Silba receiving 218 liters of rain per square meter in just 24 hours – an amount it normally gets in three months!\n\nThe red flags here in Zagreb were already beginning to come up by the time the cyclone had crossed the Velebit mountain range, having been replenished along the slopes by a strong, moist southern wind. Increasing in strength, the core of the storm had started turning slowly towards the city, prompting the Zagreb Airport (ZAG/LDZA) met office to issue a series of increasingly pessimistic TAFs – culminating in the dreaded +TSGR, thunderstorms with heavy hail…\n\nThough the hail had failed to materialize (at the airport at least), the torrential downpour that followed was about to launch ZAG into a world of issues. One of the day’s METAR reports perhaps best illustrates just what was going on out there:\n\nLDZA 301300Z 22038G48KT 0400 R05/0400VP2000N R23/0050VP2000N +TSRA FEW013 BKN030CB 17/16 Q1006 BECMG 05010KT 9999 NSW FEW015 SCT030\n\nIn normal-person speak, this reads out to:\n\nmeasurement taken at Zagreb Airport on the 30th of the month at 13:00 UTC (15:00 local)\n\nwind from 220 degrees, speed 38 knots (70 km/h), gusting to 48 knots (89 km/h)\n\nmeteorological visibility 400 meters\n\nRunway Visual Range (RVR) down RWY 05 varying between 400 and more than 2000 meters, no significant change\n\nRVR down RWY 23 varying between 50 and more than 2000 meters, no significant change\n\nthunderstorm with heavy rain\n\nfew clouds at 1300 ft above ground, CBs covering 6/8 to 7/8 of the sky at 3000 ft above the ground\n\ntemperature 17 Centigrade, dew point 16 Centigrade\n\nQNH 1006 hPa\n\nweather imminently turning into a wind from 050 degrees, speed 10 knots (18 km/h), visibility greater than 10 km, few clouds at 1500 ft above ground, scattered clouds at 3000 ft above ground (they’d missed badly with this one!)\n\nThe first thing to go wrong was the runway midpoint transmissometer (one of three such units that measure RVR). This was not all that unexpected to be honest, since they also have a tendency to fail during heavy snows (and are an endless source of amusement during the winter 😀 ). Pretty soon however, the downpour became so severe that all operations were stopped dead in their tracks, eventually leading to the full closure of the airport (on top of the fact that even before the storm hit, flights were being delayed by 30 minutes due to anti-hale rocket activity in the area).\n\nHowever, the worst was yet to come. Several minutes later, I was informed by a colleague – who’d been listening in on the tower and ops frequencies – that ZAG had suffered a “complete technical failure”. Tuning to the tower myself, I was to discover that pretty much the entire airspace surveillance system was down; Approach Control, Area Control, the works. Effectively, the whole of the Croatian ATC – with the exception of the individual Towers – had suddenly gone completely blind.\n\nThe issue that had caused the problem was later reported to be a leak in the Area Control Center main building, which had allowed rainwater to make it down into the surveillance system’s power supply, shorting it out instantly and plunging the ACC into darkness. While still unconfirmed officially, this had already sparked some local controversy, especially given that the building was purpose-built (at great cost) and commissioned only nine years ago…\n\nEDIT: the cause was later revealed to not be just a mere leak, but a torrent of water that had suddenly flooded the master electronics room (located under the main ACC building). Subsequent reports had put the depth of the water there at between 1 and 1.5 meters…\n\nA far more immediate problem though was the effect this failure was having on the flow of traffic through the country. Unlike its larger neighbors, Croatia has only one FIR – Flight Information Region, the area in which ATC provides its services – which covers its entire territory, and which is further subdivided into six “sectors” for easier management. However, all of these sectors are controlled and managed centrally from the same location, the ACC building at ZAG. With it out of the picture, there was no means to provide any form of control within the country’s airspace, leading Eurocontrol to impose the so called “zero flow rate” *.\n\n* a common misconception is that a zero flow rate is equal to airspace closure. This is not so. When the airspace is closed outright, no flight is allowed to operate in it, be it an airliner, bizjet, private, IFR, VFR, training or any combination thereof. With a zero flow rate on the other hand, Eurocontrol’s Central Flow Management Unit (CFMU) simply does not approve any IFR flight plans that cross the target airspace. So, while the big birds were not allowed in, I could have taken my Skyhawk and gone flying without problems (apart from the rain obviously 🙂 ).\n\nActivated at 13:40 UTC (15:40 local), the restriction was initially specified to last until 15:40 UTC, but was in the event extended to 16:40 and then finally 17:00. With the ACC restored to a minimal operational status, the restriction was lifted at 17:03, allowing traffic to resume using Croatian airspace. However, with the impetus being the get up and running as quickly as possible, the ACC had resumed operations with just three of its six sectors operational, each running at just 25% capacity – with expected effects on delay times…\n\nWithin the hour, all six sectors would be up and running, though still at just 25% of their nominal capacity. However, as the technicians worked their spanners off in the ACC, delays had started steadily dropping up until 21:00 UTC (23:00 local) when they dropped below the 15 minute mark and Croatia became grey again 😀 .\n\nOther effects and consequences:\n\nUnsurprisingly, Hungary had borne the brunt of the traffic diverted around Croatia. The high volume of aircraft suddenly crowing their airways – combined with the cyclone’s continued northward path – would cause a cascade effect, causing delays on par with those experienced in Croatia at the start of the storm (glowing bright red on the Network Situation snapshot). However, with only the west of the country affected, things had soon stabilized and delays dropped back to more manageable levels 🙂 .\n\nBack at ZAG, other buildings had also suffered during the downpour. Drainage canals swamped by the sheer volume of water were responsible for the partial flooding of TWY F, ZAG’s only parallel taxiway and the only way to get to the RWY 23 without backtracking along the runway. The passenger terminal had suffered the same fate, though I’m told the flooding was on a very small scale and quickly taken care of…\n\nBy me\n\nAll photos me too, copyrighted\n\nWhile our placid little airfield generally deserves the epithet of “the airfield at the edge of town” – despite what has been written here over the years 😀 – it does occasionally have its bright moments. Due to the relatively poor condition of its grass runway – among other issues – precluding the landing of any “serious” fixed wing aircraft, these tend to occur only when something rotary is in town, like the previously photographed US Navy Knighthawk or Bundespolizei Super Puma.\n\nHowever, while these very welcome one-of visitors do make for a pleasant change of tempo – often becoming major attractions in their own right – they hadn’t really prepared us for the miniature assault fleet that had pitched up camp on the military apron between 8 and 12 September… 🙂\n\nJackal Stoned\n\nIn town to participate in the annual Jackal Stone multinational military exercise – this year starting on 13 September – this fleet had included no less than four transport helicopters (nothing to sneeze at when Lučko is concerned!), and even a supporting Cessna Caravan that had occasionally popped into the field on general transport business. And while their numbers alone were enough the cause widespread interest, their composition – once confirmed by a quick search on the Net – had elevated them to “must photograph at all costs” status :D.\n\nThe “less interesting” pair – using the term lightly – were two already familiar US Navy Sikorsky MH-60S Knighthawks, pretty much identical to the example that had visited us a couple of months back, save for being equipped with turret IR cameras on their noses.\n\nFar more interesting by any measure – objective or otherwise – were the “big guns”, two US Army Boeing MH-47G Chinooks. Significantly more potent than the stock transport CH-47s, the MH-47G is a dedicated special operations model, conceived and designed on the back of lessons learned during special forces deployments and insertions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The rarest – and among the newest – of all Chinooks, these models carry virtually no external markings (apart from faint titles and an incredibly-difficult-to-find serial) and sport a distinctive matte black finish that makes them impossible to photograph effectively in all but early morning light 🙂 (which had presented a slight problem for yours truly, since none of them had actually operated during the early morning).\n\nOf course, being the hopeless GA enthusiast that I am, both of these incredible – and incredibly rare – machines were overshadowed somewhat by a brief, five-minute visit of one of my favorite prop singles, the Cessna Caravan :D. The first one I’ve ever seen in person – which says much about the traffic at Lučko – this specific example belongs to the military U-27 family, operated in this instance by the US Army. Based on the stock 208B Grand Caravan, the U-27 differs mostly in its more spartan interior fittings – suited to its military transport role – and the absence of the imposing cargo pod seen on many civil versions…\n\nBy me\n\nAll photos me too unless otherwise stated, copyrighted\n\nWhile this year’s game of Lučko Roulette – trying to fly your aircraft out before the field closes due to bad weather 😀 – has been generally successful, the constraints of the limited apron capacity at Zagreb Intl. meant that a few aircraft (notably those with a hangar above their heads) have nevertheless remained at the field. Faced with the prospect of them sitting idle in sub-zero temperatures until the runway melts and dries out – which can take awhile – the “flight ops department” of Aeroklub Zagreb had once again decided to clear out its hangar and give everything in there a thorough shakedown :).\n\nWhile at first it may seem a bit pointless to fire up the engine, proverbially rev the bolts off it, and turn it off again without going anywhere, the procedure does have a host of beneficial effects. Primarily and most importantly, it allows the engine to periodically clear itself of all the deposits and substances that can (and will) accumulate in its piping and systems during a long stay on the ground. If left to settle firmly over the winter, these substances – the most common being carbon deposits on the spark plugs – can seize and/or severely damage the engine when it is finally started; but, if anticipated during these shakedown runs, they can be easily removed by simply revving the engine to raise the temperatures in the cylinders until the deposits burn away and the engine starts to run smoothly.\n\nThe same also applies to the oil system – which, on the face of it, is the very system that allows the engine to run in the first place. And while winter temperatures in Zagreb rarely go below -15 Centigrade – well above the temperature at which winter-grade oil thickens dangerously and freezes – the system itself has a number of moving parts (the most important being the oil pump) that are also susceptible to the above stated. Running the engine at a higher throttle setting allows the pump(s) to run up to speed and warm up, breaking off any deposits on their blades and bearings. In addition, the flow of oil through the system picks up any impurities that might have settled on the bottom of the pipes and deposits them on the (removable) oil filter, thus cleaning out the entire system.\n\nThe fuel system too needs some attention, mostly to purge it of water deposits that – inevitably 😀 – form in its low points. Being heavier and thicker than Avgas, water tends to sink and collect at the bottom of fuel tanks and pipes – and if ingested into the cylinders in a large enough quantity can cause a lot of (very expensive!) damage. By its very nature, water is incompressible; and when it winds up in the part of the engine DESIGNED to compress, something has to give… which is usually the piston 😀 (however, there are systems that inject water into the cylinders on purpose – but this is on a controlled and measured basis. These systems – usually known as Anti Detonation Injection, or ADI – squirt a small amount of water into the inlet pipes, which then absorbs excess heat in the cylinder and prevents uncontrolled spontaneous ignition, as well as providing a significant increase in power… as seen on the P-47 Thunderbolt 🙂 ). Thankfully, the unwanted water can be easily removed from the system by draining the bottom of the fuel tank using a special valve, as well as dumping the contents of the pipes at the low point of the system – usually just after the fuel selector normally mounted on the cabin floor – using a small lever in the engine bay.\n\nLess visible benefits of these high-power runs also include recharging of the battery, which will – again inevitably 🙂 – discharge or even go flat after awhile (as had happened to our Piper Warrior). The ready supply of electricity from the alternator allows too for a check of the aircraft’s other electrically-powered systems, such as the radios, flaps (where available), lights and so on…\n\nHowever, before all of that, you first have to take care of one small detail – pushing everything out into the open :D. Normally this is not a problem – but our efforts that day were a tad complicated by the inch or two of fresh snowfall from the night before… 🙂\n\nBy me\n\nAll photos me too, copyrighted\n\nHaving been warming the chair with my ATPL studies for a good part of the month – not the most fulfilling of activities I must say, especially since it’s 35 Centigrade outside… and probably more inside – I was naturally through the roof when my name finally came up on the multi-engine training roster :). Eager to fly (and photograph :D) any day of the week, I was doubly excited this time, since I’d finally get to try my hand at the university’s sole Piper Seminole – in a nutshell my first Piper, first low-wing and first twin 🙂 (greetings from fixed-gear Cessna land!).\n\nThe aircraft in question is 9A-DZG, a trusty 1978 normally-aspirated Seminole that has pretty much passed through the hands of almost every multi-engine qualified pilot in Croatia in the last few years. Powered by two 180 HP Lycoming O-360s, it may not be the most exciting or high performing aircraft in the world – but after half a dozen Skyhawks, it is pretty much the top of the line :D.\n\nTraining-wise, first up was the Multi Engine Class rating, done under VFR (thankfully we’ve been having some excellent VMC lately). This pretty much revolves around the most important skills multi-engine aircraft require – the ability to fly on only one of those engines. As well as zone work – to familiarize ourselves with the aircraft and its handling characteristics – the course includes a broad range of “one engine inoperative” (OEI) situations, such as in cruise, during landing, during takeoff, after takeoff and on go-around. Lacking any navigation elements (such as IFR flying), we could have done the course at Lučko or Pleso – but given that they do have a lot of traffic nowadays, and OEI ops tending to disrupt the normal traffic flow, we decided to head somewhere else, most often the coast :).\n\nTo compensate for the increased transit time, time we could spend on honing our OEI skills, we usually flew in pairs of two students, where one would fly outbound and do his/her training, after which we’d land and swap places. The other student would then do a similar set of exercises and fly the return leg, while the backseater would observe and learn… and in my case, snap a photo or two :D.\n\nBy me\n\nAll photos me too, copyrighted\n\nWhile idly browsing the BBC News website a few days ago, I came across an interesting article featuring Mr. Tim Peake, the first UK resident accepted into the European Space Agency (ESA) as an astronaut-trainee. A former Royal Army helicopter pilot, he has made a rather unusual jump into spaceflight, becoming part of new multinational European crew – currently undergoing microgravity and zero G training – slated to man the expected 2013-2014 mission to the International Space Station.\n\nAlongside Mr. Peake’s fantastic personal achievement, the centerpiece of the article – posted here – was the unusual Airbus A300 used for the group’s training, getting a new lease on life as a zero G simulation platform. And having had the great privilege of visiting the said aircraft at last year’s Paris Air Show, I thought I could just as well do a short feature on it, to break my single-engine piston trend of late :).\n\nOperated by the French company Novespace on behalf the government space agency Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) and ESA, F-BUAD is a very interesting Airbus. A very rare first-generation A300B2-103 from 1973, it is the third A300 – and the third Airbus of any sort – ever produced. The first production-standard A300, it is also the oldest Airbus aircraft still flying, which is, given its current age and mission, a more than impressive testament to the design’s durability and reliability.\n\nSince the BBC article explains its mission and flight profile in greater detail than I could achieve here – including a handy graph that says a thousand words 🙂 – I’ll skip that and head straight for the juicy bits: the photos :D.\n\nAnd finally, to illustrate how all of this comes together, I’ve found three suitable YouTube videos – the first of which was played in the aircraft itself at Paris – that show what no amount of words can :):\n\nBy me\n\nAll photos me too, copyrighted as usual\n\nLooking back through all the articles I’ve posted here, I saw I’d made quite a few boastful promises about topics that in the end never materialized :). So, still waiting for something to happen here in the present, I’ve decided to clear my topic backlog, starting of with my first true air-to-air photo experience – banner towing :).\n\n1. Fly-by-wire\n\nWhile banner towing in flight seems – and is – a pretty straightforward affair, down on the ground, getting the thing airborne, is a different story altogether. Despite popular myth, taking off with the banner attached causes more problems than it solves, particularly on uneven grass runways such as at Lučko – where it would promptly be torn off and shredded, not to mention all the adverse effects it would cause for the unlucky towplane.\n\nTo get around this problem, somebody somewhere at some point had borrowed a WW2 method – why not snag the banner inflight? To quote Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear, “How hard can it be?” :D. The idea is that the banner’s tow cable is suspended between two poles at some height above ground, usually about 2-3 meters. The towplane would then, trailing a hook on another cable, come down low and snag the banner, lifting it off the ground as it climbs away. Those of you who have seen images of Dakotas picking up troop transport gliders during WW2 will immediately see the similarities.\n\nAfter a successful snag and climb away, the rest of the flight becomes routine – with careful monitoring of the engine temperature gauges that is. Despite most banners weighing not more than 20-ish kilograms altogether, their large surface area creates a lot of drag. This necessitates a higher throttle setting and if not flying fast enough for sufficient engine cooling, it’s not really that difficult to overtemp the engine.\n\nWith the mission completed, the banner is then dropped from the aircraft during a slow, low pass. The release itself depends on the hook and tow mechanism, but in our case the whole cable – all the way from the attachment hook below the tail – is jettisoned, to be untangled and separated on the ground. This leaves the aircraft free to perform a normal, unencumbured landing.\n\n2. A skiing competition, a casino and some fog\n\nWhile all of the above is fine and dandy, back in the winter of 2008 my aeroclub had gotten a bit ambitious :). The mission was to tow the largest banner ever towed in Croatia, measuring 5 x 30-something meters. Doesn’t sound like much the first time you hear it, but in effect that’s a 150 square meter airbrake – more than three times the surface area of my apartment!\n\nThe venue was the Snow Queen skiing competition held on the northern slopes of the Medvednica mountain between 15. and 17. February 2008. And the customer – a large casino near Šentilj, on the border between Slovenia and Austria. Connection – I see none, but it didn’t matter since it got us up in the air with no questions asked :).\n\nFortunately for our towplane, the temperatures had plummeted during the weekend, down to around -15 Centigrade at the altitude at which we had expected to do our run. (round 2,000 ft) With such a draggy mass behind it, and the requirement to fly at 70-75 knots so people on the ground could actually read what was being towed, engine cooling was a serious issue, so the lower the outside temp, the better.\n\nNow, the original plan was to do a run on the 15th, with DMJ acting as the towplane and DMM – with me on board – acting as the photo ship to immortalize the whole event :). However, even before leaving the ground we had run into a small problem…\n\nPretty soon however we ran into problem #2. The ski track which we were supposed to fly over – a track very popular with local skiers – is quite narrow and tucked away between two mountain crests. To follow it, we’d have to fly up the through, climbing continuously, in formation and poor visibility, with one aircraft that was underpowered and another that was barely hauling itself as it was. Realizing conclusively that it would all end in a pretty big accident, we turned round and scurried back toward Zagreb, to try and at least save some of the mission there.\n\nSo far so good as far as the towing was concerned, but my photo session was turning into a bit of a mess. The poor visibility and light, coupled with the turbulent downdraft from the mountain, meant I couldn’t really do much with my unstabilized telephoto lens, so to conserve fuel, we turned for home, leaving DMJ to fly two more short runs above town.\n\n3. Cold, cold, cold!\n\nWhile the results of the first run were mildly disappointing to say the least, the designated god of aviation – Murphy 😀 – allowed us to make it all up on the 17th, when the weather finally cleared. Beautifully clear skies, still air, visibility one can only hope for and an even lower temperature were just too good to pass up, so we saddled up and full of optimism decided to give it another shot…\n\nBecause the shoot was going so well, Mr. Murphy decided to intervene again and as we neared the ski track, our coordination sort of broke down :). The problem was that to get good shots, we had to fly to the left, above and somewhat in front of DMJ. This meant that my photopilot couldn’t see DMJ because I was in the way, DMJ couldn’t see us because it’s wing was in the way, and the need to maneuver around hills and keep station above the track meant that our graceful aerial ballet quickly degenerated into a left-footed cha-cha-cha as we tried to keep our little formation together.\n\nWith my hands trembling and my skin cracked from the cold – -17 C at 70 knots in propwash without gloves, absolute genius on my part – and our mission completed (relatively, given there were few spectators out :D), we set course for home. As before, DMJ went to do a circuit of the town, while we proceeded directly to Lučko, so I could catch a shot from the ground as well 🙂 (I was having a photo field day).\n\nUnfortunately, getting some “inside” photos from the towplane is a bit difficult and impractical – mostly because both crew are busy with other things… and there’s honestly not much to see; most of the time the banner itself is outside the the crew’s field of view, so it pretty much looks far better from the outside :). I’m also hoping to get a good, systematic sequence of the pickup, but that will have to wait for some warmer weather… 🙂"
