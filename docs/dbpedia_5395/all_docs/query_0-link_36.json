There are several situations that the parcel will be returned to the shipping company’s country of origin warehouse:\n\n1. We will contact the client ASAP once we receive any notification from our shipping company that your parcel is stuck in the customs due to any custom clearance reasons. If the client does not provide any necessary information within 48 HOURS that is required by the customs (such as tax payment) in a timely manner. The parcel will be returned to the shipping company’s country of origin warehouse. If the client wants to re-ship the parcel, you may need to pay an additional fee (according to the bill from our shipping company). If you decided not to get the parcel at your own discretion, you may need to carry the burden for return shipping cost (according to the bill from our shipping company). We will refund retail price(not included extra shipping cost if paid when you placed your order) after the deduction of the return shipping cost.\n\n2. We will contact the client ASAP once we receive any notification from our shipping company that either delivery address or phone number is incorrect. However, if the client does not reply to our inquiry promptly, it will lead to the failure of the parcel delivery. The client may need to carry the burden of additional cost for re-delivery.\n\n3. After customer received the product, if it is not related to product quality problem and the customer wants to return the product, the customer needs to request it within 7 days upon product/parcel arrival, and the customer needs to cover the return shipping cost. Once we received the product in our warehouse, we will issue a refund for the product cost via Stripe.\n\n4. If it appears as \"Delivered\" on courier's website (e.g.: DHL) for more than 1 (one) month, the delivery details on courier's website will be deleted. The courier will not provide any compensation to us for these order, that's why we can't provide any refund if the client does not inform us to investigate the parcel via email 1 (one) month after it has been \"Delivered\" on courier’s website.\n\n5. To avoid return of shipment, customers are required to provide full name in the information form. The cost of the return will be the responsibility of the customers if the name in the form is incomplete.\n\nfantastic build quality, nice weight to it. I didnt like the red keycaps with the the gray. I think its a much more retro look with all the white and gray. Thanks to Womier for including extra gray switches!\n\nThe LEDs are nice although VIA is hyped up to be the best software yet there is no easy way to set a solid color in VIA. Womier's hardware control to the rescue though! Just follow the manual for solid color LEDs if that is something you like too.\n\nCame in 7 days as well so amazing shipping! For other Canadians like me, FYI there are no customs charges or import duties.\n\nWhen I saw the presentation of this product on Instagram, I blindly pre-ordered it, trusting that it would be a keyboard similar to the Rainy75 but at a lower price, but I didn't expect it to be even better, the physical texture, the keycaps, the switches, the weight, all of the dazzle great quality, about the sound, its clacky/creamy, but my unit came with the dragon artisan keycap and when I installed this on the space bar, the sound of it changed radically but for the better, I loved it, I only have one complaint about In this product, idk if its only my unit but, the stabilizers for some reason have different heights and the keys look and feel a little higher on one side than the other, it's a little annoying but you get used to it, everything else is excellent.\n\nLove this keyboard so much.\n\nI'm comparing it to the NyPhy Halo75 V1. It's heavier which makes the switches and keycaps really pop with a very pleasant sound. Love the typing experience, the typing angle ..hell, I'm really enjoying it. If this passes the test of time as well, it's an amazing product.\n\nHonestly I don't think this is inferior to the NyPhy Halo V1 in any way, if anything else it surpasses it at only half the price.\n\nPurchased this beauty at 100 EUR and I'm not looking back. You've got yourself a customer Womier, looking forward for other products as well :)\n\nKeep up the good work!"
