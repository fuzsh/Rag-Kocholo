        "text": "Lower than 30 mg/g\n\nA result in this range is considered “normal” or “at goal”.\n\nThis result puts you at the lowest risk for getting kidney failure or having a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) because of albuminuria.\n\nYou may be asked to repeat this test within 3 to 6 months to confirm your results are accurate.\n\n30 to 299 mg/g\n\nA uACR in this range is considered “moderately increased”.\n\nIf you have not previously had a result in this range, you will likely be asked to repeat this test within 3 to 6 months to confirm your results are accurate.\n\nHaving a confirmed result in this range puts you at a higher risk for getting kidney failure or having a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke).\n\nHaving a confirmed result in this range twice in 3-6 months may mean you have kidney disease (even if your eGFR is above 60).\n\n300 mg/g or higher\n\nA uACR in this range is considered “severely increased”.\n\nIf you have not previously had a result in this range, you will likely be asked to repeat this test within 3 to 6 months to confirm your results are accurate.\n\nHaving a confirmed result in this range puts you at a significantly higher risk for getting kidney failure or having a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke).\n\nHaving a confirmed result in this range twice in 3-6 months may mean you have kidney disease (even if your eGFR is above 60).\n\nOther tests\n\nIf your uACR is much higher than the target range, extra tests may be recommended to get more information about what may be causing your albuminuria. These tests may include:\n\nKidney biopsy - especially if there is a concern for glomerular disease. This test can help find out what caused your kidney disease and how much damage to the kidneys has already happened.\n\nImaging tests - especially if there is a concern for kidney cancer, kidney stones, or structural problems within the kidney. These tests include things like an ultrasound or CT scan. These produce a picture of your kidneys and urinary tract.\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to lower your overall risk for developing complications, starting with targeting the most likely cause for your albuminuria.\n\nAngiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)\n\nAvailable for use in the US since the early 1980s.\n\nACE inhibitors have generic names ending in “-pril”. Examples include benazepril (Lotensin), lisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil), quinapril (Accupril), and ramipril (Altace).\n\nARBs have generic names ending in “-sartan”. Examples include irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar), olmesartan (Benicar), and valsartan (Diovan).\n\nUsually the most preferred starting treatment for albuminuria.\n\nMost are available as low-cost generic options.\n\nPeople should not mix medications from these classes. In other words, use an ACE inhibitor OR an ARB, not both together.\n\nMore information can be found on the ACE inhibitors & ARBs page.\n\nSodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors\n\nAvailable for use in the US since the early 2010s.\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors have generic names ending in “-flozin”. Examples include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance).\n\nThese medicines were originally developed to help lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Later studies found they also offer kidney protection benefits.\n\nSome SGLT2 inhibitors are also FDA-approved for use in people with chronic kidney disease and/or heart failure, even if they do not have type 2 diabetes (usually at lower doses). This does not apply to all SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nCurrently, there are no generic SGLT2 inhibitor options approved for use in the US.\n\nMore information can be found on the SGLT2 inhibitors page.\n\nNon-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs)\n\nAvailable for use in the US since the early 2020s.\n\nThe only nsMRA available in the US is finerenone (Kerendia).\n\nThis medicine is only FDA-approved for people who have albuminuria AND type 2 diabetes. The effects of this medicine in people without diabetes is being tested in clinical trials.\n\nCurrently, there are no generic nsMRA options approved for use in the US.\n\nMore information can be found on the nsMRAs page.\n\nNutrition\n\nAsk your kidney dietitian, diabetes care & education specialist, or healthcare provider about your nutritional needs. Fortunately, the steps you may already be taking to help manage any other health conditions you may have (high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure) can help with albuminuria too.\n\nFor general guidance on nutrition, click the link that best matches your situation:\n\nNutrition for people with stage 1-4 kidney disease\n\nNutrition and kidney failure\n\nNutrition for children with chronic kidney disease\n\nExercise\n\nRegular exercise is important for a healthy lifestyle. For general guidance on exercise recommendations, visit the Staying fit with kidney disease page.\n\nOther steps\n\nSome additional steps that can help you lower your uACR levels and lower your risk for a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) include (not all recommendations will apply to everybody):\n\nStop smoking and/or using tobacco products.\n\nWork toward losing extra weight through a balanced diet and physical activity.\n\nLimit how much alcohol you drink.\n\nQuestions to Ask\n\nWhen was the last time I had a uACR test?\n\nWhat were the results of my last uACR test?\n\nWhat steps can I take today to lower my uACR level into the goal range and lower my risk of complications?\n\nWhat are my other risk factors for having a cardiovascular event in the future?\n\nWhat actions can I take today to improve my kidney health and decrease my cardiovascular risk?"
