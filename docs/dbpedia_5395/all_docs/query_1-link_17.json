        "text": "Some personal reflections on archaeology, 25 years after the first meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists in 1995. This is a talk I gave at the online meetings of the European Association of Archaeologists in August 2020. It was part of a session convened by Felipe Criado-Boado and Kristian Kristiansen, who had been organizers of the meetings in Santiago de Compostela in 1995. They asked contributors to reflect upon 25 years of change in European Archaeology. I have been immensely influenced by the extraordinary leadership and vision of Felipe and Kristian, by the welcoming humanism of so many members of the EAA. My talk explores how we might conceive an archaeology that is centered upon community, collegiality, dialogue, in working with what remains of the past to build a better future.\n\n“Contemporary Archaeology” deals with sites, features and finds from the period after the beginning of industrialisation, obtained through excavation and documentation using techniques and methods applied in all fields of archaeology. The topic and the comparatively ‘young’ period in focus are not completely new for archaeological monument preservation, even if they are explicitly considered in only a relatively few monument protection laws. It has long been common practice in many places across Europe to protect, preserve, and research monuments of the recent past—simply because they are there. This is both a challenge and an opportunity for archaeological heritage management, considered in the 2023 EAC symposium papers. Archaeological heritage preservation gains weight because it is accompanied by a special interest from the public and, thus, can develop opportunities to participate in political education. The material remains of war and terror lead us to the limits of archaeology and beyond: they become evidence, crime scenes, and anchors for commemoration and political education.\n\nThis PDF is a simplified version of the original article published in Internet Archaeology under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC BY) Unported licence.
