        "text": "I will try to write down some general divers info about Croatia, the rules, waters, temperature, waypoints, tides, waves, depths and other stuff for anyone wanting to come and experience the Adriatic sea.\n\nRULES\n\n1. If you are diving with a diving center which will organize diving you will need:\n\n- your divers card from CMAS, PADI, SSI, NAUI, IANTD\n\n2. If you want to dive by yourself you will need\n\n- your divers card from CMAS, PADI, SSI, NAUI, IANTD\n\n- Ministry card from Harbor master (323 Euro per year sold in all Harbor master offices)\n\nDiving is not permitted at the following locations:\n\n1. In the areas of internal sea waters encompassing harbors, accesses to harbors, anchorage and the areas\n\nwith a heavy traffic.\n\n2. In the strict and special sea reservates, natural parks and other protected sea and undersea areas.\n\n3. Near anchored warships and protected military facilities at the coastal edge on the distance of no less than 100 meters.\n\n4. Brijuni, Krka national parks.\n\nSEA TEMPERATURE\n\nThe Adriatic Sea has a very stable annual change of the surface temperature. The average annual temperature is 11°C. During the winter, the sea is the coldest and the surface temperature is about 7°C; very seldom, it can drop below that too. In the spring, the sea becomes warmer, and the surface temperature rises to 18°C. In the summer the surface of the sea reaches a very high temperature, of up to 22 to 25°C, and in the southern Adriatic and Istria up to 27°C. In the Adriatic, thermoclines, i.e. parts of the water column of the same temperature, are very well distinguished. The thermocline is most evident during the summer, and, in the winter, the isothermal process arises, i.e. equaling of the temperature throughout the water column. In the summer, we can notice the first thermocline at the depth of 3 to 5 m, the next one is at about 12 m, and yet another one at 18 metes, while below 30 m the temperature is mostly constant throughout the year\n\nVISIBILITY\n\nIn Northern Adriatic visibility is not as clear as in mid or south Adriatic\n\nbecause of influence of the river Po and flowering of the sea.\n\nIn Mid and South Adriatic visibilities is excellent sometimes more than 50 meters\n\nDIVING SEASON\n\nDiving season starts during May and finishes in October, but the highest season is during July and August. Best months for divers which do not enjoy rushes and hard night life are during June & September.\n\nTIDES\n\nIn the Adriatic, the high and low tides have relatively small amplitudes. In the southern part, the difference is rarely above some forty centimeters, while in the northern part it is somewhat bigger, so that it comes to 1 meter in Istria and the Gulf of Trieste. In some narrow channels and bays, the high tide can grow considerably during a strong sirocco. That phenomenon is characteristic for big and deep bays of the southern Adriatic. The tides are of a mixed type, which means that their rhythm is semidiurnal during the new and full moon and of a daily type during the first and the last quarter. Their amplitudes are very irregular.\n\nSEA CURRENTS\n\nSea currents occur under the influence of winds, the difference in pressure, temperature, and the differences in salinity. With respect to the direction, they can be horizontal or vertical. There are also bottom currents which appear as the consequence of moving of water from warmer areas to colder ones, during which the surface layer gets cold and descends towards the seabed. Currents are weakly observable in the Adriatic.The speed of currents changes in particular areas, but it also depends on time periods. The average speed of currents is about 0.5 knots, but they can also reach the speed of 4 knots.\n\nWAVES\n\nWaves occur primarily as the consequence of the blowing of winds. The bigger the reach, i.e. the surface across which the wind blows, the higher the waves will be. Their strength depends on the configuration and the exposure of the coast. In that way, mixing of the surface layer with water from the deep is enabled, and the interaction between the atmosphere and the sea. We distinguish the crest and the trough of a wave. The length of the wave is the distance between two troughs. Most often, heights of waves in the Adriatic are between 0.5 and 1.5 metres, and they very rarely exceed 5 metres.\n\nDEPTH & FLAGS\n\nThe area in which diving is performed must be visibly marked with an orange or red buoy or a diving flag. The maximum approved depth for sport and recreational diving is 40 meters\n\nDIVING FEDERATIONS VALID IN CROATIA\n\nBISAC - The British Sub - Aqua Club\n\nCMAS - World Underwater Federation (Confederation Mondiale des Activites Subaquatiques)\n\nIANTD - International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers\n\nNAUI - National Association of Underwater Instructors\n\nPADI - Professional Association of Diving Instructors\n\nSSI - Scuba School International\n\nTemporary diving qualifications are not valid.\n\nHARBOR MASTERS IN CROATIA:\n\nPula Obala maršala Tita 18 ++385 (0)52 222 037\n\nRijeka Senjsko pristanište 3 ++385 (0)51 211 660\n\nZadar Liburnska obala 8, P.P.226 ++385 (0)51 211 660\n\nSenj Obala kralja Zvonimira 12, P.P.1 ++385 (0)53 881 301\n\nŠibenik Obala oslobodenja 8, P.P.51 ++385 (0)22 217 378\n\nSplit Obala Lazareta 1, P.P.31 ++385 (0)21 341 438\n\nPloče Trg kralja Tomislava 24 ++385 (0)20 679 008\n\nDubrovnik Obala S.

The largest islands are Krk, Cres and Brac. There are 66 inhabited islands.\n\nMoney: Kuna .\n\n1 Euro = 7.5 kuna\n\n1 US $ = 6.5 Kuna (this is written and valid in July 2018)\n\nCredit cards: Most hotels, restaurants and shops accept credit cards (American Express, Diners Club, Eurocard/Mastercard and Visa).\n\nElectricity: 220V, 50Hz\n\nWater: Tap water is drinkable throughout Croatia.\n\nCountry telephone code for Croatia is +385.\n\nTime zone: GMT plus one hour in winter and GMT plus two in summer.\n\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR WHILE DIVING IN CROATIA\n\nBecause of Natural differences between North Adriatic, Mid Adriatic and South Adriatic, Croatia offers big variety of great places for diving.\n\nNorth Adriatic\n\nNorth Adriatic, because of river Po (which comes in to the Adriatic in Venice, Italy) which has during thousands of years been pumping sand and mud in to the sea, so the depths are low, mostly down to 40 meters which is great for wreck diving. The most famous wreck is for sure Baron Gauch of coast from Rovinj and Pula.\n\nUnderwater nature is nice on some islands as Losinj where you can find lots of different interesting underwater spaces and also the last large community of good dolphins (tursiops truncatus) in the North Adriatic inhabits the waters of Losinj.\n\nBiggest problem in North Adriatic for divers is low visibility caused by flowering of the sea, which happens in some parts of the year.\n\nBest diving locations are fare from the diving centers so the boat trips to and from diving locations are up to one hour, but worth a trip.\n\nMost famous places to dive are Rovinj (cave in the island, Baron Gauch), Pula (National park Brioni, Baron Gauch), Lošinj (bio diversity, wracks, caves), Cres (wracks, caves).\n\nMid Adriatic and South Adriatic\n\nFrom Kornati National park all the way down to Dubrovnik Adriatic is famous for huge dropoffs which on some places go from surface all the way down to more than 100 meters depth. For best diving sites you usually have to go on islands as Kornati, Vis, Korcula, Lastovo with the exception of coastal area of Rogoznica. On these cliffs there are huge number of caves, cracks, corals, Gorgonia fans and different fish life. You can also find a huge number of wrecks but only a smaller number is on accessible depths for recreational divers. Underwater visibility is much better than in North Adriatic sometimes up to 50 meters.\n\nMost famous places to dive are National park Kornati (dropoffs), Rogoznica(dropoffs, eco dive, wrecks, caves), Hvar (dropoffs), Vis (dropoffs, wrecks, caves), Lastovo (dropoffs, wrecks, caves), Korcula (dropoffs, wrecks, caves), National park Mljet (bio diversity, dropoffs).\n\nI will write on specific locations in a new thread, this is more of a general info."
