        "text": "Dialysis is a type of treatment that helps your body remove extra fluid and waste products from your blood when the kidneys are not able to. Dialysis was first used successfully in the 1940's and became a standard treatment for kidney failure starting in the 1970s. Since then, millions of patients have been helped by these treatments.\n\nDialysis can be done in a hospital, a dialysis center, or at home. You and your doctor will decide which type of dialysis and which place is best, based on your medical condition and your wishes.\n\nHemodialysis (HD)\n\nIn hemodialysis, a dialyzer (filtering machine) is used to remove waste and extra fluid from your blood, and then return the filtered blood into your body. Before starting hemodialysis, a minor surgery is needed to create a vascular access site (opening into one of your blood vessels), usually in your arm. This access site is important to have an easy way to get blood from your body, through the dialyzer, and back into your body. Hemodialysis can be done at a dialysis center or at home. Treatments usually last about four hours and are done three times per week. Some people may need more time for treatments based on their specific needs.\n\nImage Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\n\nPeritoneal Dialysis (PD)\n\nIn peritoneal dialysis, your blood is filtered inside your own body instead of using a dialyzer machine. For this type of dialysis, the lining of your abdomen or belly area (also called the peritoneum) is used as a filter. Before starting peritoneal dialysis, a minor surgery is needed to place a catheter (soft tube) in your belly. During each treatment, your belly area is slowly filled with dialysate (a cleansing fluid made from a mixture of water, salt, and other additives) through the catheter. As your blood flows naturally through the area, extra fluid and waste products are pulled out of the blood vessels and into the belly area by the dialysate (almost like a magnet). After a few hours, the fluid mixture is drained from your belly using the same catheter and bag that was used at the beginning of the treatment. Peritoneal dialysis can be done almost anywhere if you have the supplies required to perform the treatment.\n\nTwo of the most common types of peritoneal dialysis are:\n\nContinuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD)\n\nAutomated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD)\n\nThe supplies and equipment needed, duration of each treatment (also known as an exchange), and number of treatments per day will differ depending on the type of PD you are using and your medical condition. More information about these treatments can be found on the NKF Peritoneal Dialysis AtoZ page.\n\nDialysis is a very effective treatment option for clearing waste products and extra fluid from your blood. However, it does not fully replace all the kidney’s functions, so it is not considered a cure for kidney disease or kidney failure.\n\nAll types of dialysis are equally effective, but your medical condition and personal preferences may match one treatment approach better than others. You and your doctor will discuss this and decide which type of dialysis and which place is best. You may also find it helpful to talk with other people who are living with dialysis to learn from their experiences.\n\nThe following steps can help increase the effectiveness of your dialysis treatments:\n\ncomplete your treatments according to your prescribed schedule\n\nfollow your customized eating plan recommended by your kidney dietitian\n\nget as much physical activity as possible to boost your strength and heart health\n\ntalk with your dialysis provider and pharmacist about any medications, supplements, or herbal products you are taking or are considering starting\n\ntalk with your dialysis team about any concerns or side effects that you may have\n\nImpact on regular routine\n\nMost people on dialysis are able to keep a regular routine except for the time needed for treatments. Dialysis often makes people feel better because it helps clear the waste products that have built up in the blood between treatments. However, some people report feeling tired after dialysis, especially if they have been getting dialysis treatments for a long time.\n\nPeople receiving dialysis treatments also need to be mindful of what they eat. The specific meal plan recommended for you may vary depending on which type of dialysis you receive. Work with your kidney dietitian to create a meal plan that fits your routine and lifestyle.\n\nTraveling is also a possibility for people on dialysis. Dialysis centers are in every part of the United States and many other countries. The treatment is standardized. You must make an appointment for dialysis treatments at another dialysis center before you go. The staff at your current center may help you make the appointment. Visit the NKF Travel Tips AtoZ page for more information.\n\nMany people on dialysis can go back to work after they have gotten used to dialysis. However, if your job has a lot of physical labor (heavy lifting, digging, etc.), you may need to look for a different type of work. Visit the NKF Working with Kidney Disease AtoZ page for more information.\n\nIt will likely take you and your family some time to get used to including dialysis treatments into a new routine.\n\nCosts\n\nDialysis treatments are very expensive. However, most people with kidney failure are eligible for Medicare when they start dialysis. This means the federal government pays 80 percent of all dialysis costs. Private health insurance or state Medicaid programs may also help with the costs. Visit the NKF resource on insurance options for people on dialysis or with a kidney transplant to learn more.\n\nDiscomfort\n\nYou may have some discomfort as the needles are put into your access site. Over time, people usually get used to being around these needles and equipment. The dialysis treatment itself is painless.\n\nLife Expectancy\n\nLife expectancy on dialysis varies depending on your other medical conditions, how well you follow your treatment plan, and various other factors. The average life expectancy on dialysis is 5-10 years. However, many patients have lived well on dialysis for 20 or even 30 years. Talk to your healthcare team about how to take care of yourself and stay healthy on dialysis."
