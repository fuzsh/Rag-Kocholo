        "text": "Australian Eastern Daylight Time\n\nAustralian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT) is observer in New South Wales (except Broken Hill and Lord Howe Island), Victoria, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Canberra AEDT is equal to Coordinated Universal Time plus 11 hours (UTC +11). During a summer time period, these locations move from AEST to Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT), and clocks are advanced to UTC +11.\n\nDaylight saving or summer time is commonly expressed as AEDT (Australian Eastern Daylight Time). In periods of daylight saving an hour is added to the Local Standard Time.\n\nThe regulation of time is a State Government responsibility. Changes to the period of daylight saving may be made by regulation. Legislation to harmonise daylight saving in NSW with the south-eastern states and the ACT was passed by the NSW Parliament on 23 October 2007.\n\nHistory of daylight saving in New South Wales\n\nDaylight saving operated nationally for single summer during World War I from 1 January 1917 to 25 March 1917 and during World War II for three summers in a row, starting on 1 January 1942. Daylight saving was re-introduced for third time in New South Wales on 31 October 1971 after New South Wales Parliament passed the Standard Time Act 1971. A referendum held on 1 May 1976 proposed that daylight saving should be on a permanent basis. The ballot paper stated: \"At present there is a period commonly called 'daylight saving' by which time is advanced by one hour for the period commencing on the last Sunday in October in each year and ending on the first Sunday in March in the following year. Electors were then asked to answer YES or NO to the question: Are you in favour of daylight saving? 1,882,770 electors were in favour, 868,900 were against and 35,507 votes were informal.\\\" The period of daylight saving is prescribed by the Daylight Saving Regulations 2008, made under the Daylight Saving Act 2007. Since April 2008, daylight saving has been synchronised across Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT and South Australia, although South Australia remains half an hour behind throughout the year due to the observance of Australian Central Standard Time.\n\nWhich is correct Daylight Savings or Daylight Saving (with or without the 's' at the end)? The correct spelling in Australia is without the 's'.\n\nAEDT representations, usage and related time zones"
