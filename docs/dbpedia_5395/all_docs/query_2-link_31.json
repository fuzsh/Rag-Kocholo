        "text": "BDS (hereinafter referred to as “BDS”, “we” or “us”) is committed to maintaining the privacy of every current, former and prospective member of BDS and its member organisations, whether natural or legal persons, and the visitors and users of this website (each, a “User” and collectively, the “Users” or “you”). We recognise that you entrust personal data to us, and we wish to assure you that we take seriously our responsibilities in protecting and safeguarding the same.\n\nThis Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we process personal data that we collect on this website (the “Site”) or that is otherwise provided to us by the Users. This Policy may be updated at any time. Such updates will be effective from the date of the uploading of the revised Policy to the Site or its communication to you. Please ensure that you regularly read the latest version of this Policy.\n\nCOLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATAWe may collect personal data about you when you use this Site, or when you apply for or use other services offered by BDS, in the following ways:\n\nWe may collect personal data about you from applications, forms or questionnaires you may complete or agreements you enter into with us or in the course of you establishing or maintaining a customer relationship with us.\n\nIf you register to our courses we will ask you to provide us with certain personal data about yourself. This data may include your name, company name, title, address, country of residence, e-mail address, telephone number, and account number.\n\nFurther data may be collected by BDS as a result of the use of cookies (see Section 5 below).\n\nUSE OF PERSONAL DATA\n\nPersonal data collected about you in accordance with Section 1 above may be used to verify your identity and eligibility, to provide information to you in your field of interest that we believe may be of interest to you, to record your interest in services that we offer, and to respond properly to your requests for information. Furthermore, we may use such personal data to contact you in order to announce new services or events (including by way of telephone, e-mail, SMS, or fax), for service improvement studies or for internal research.\n\nBDS may use the personal data stored about you jointly with its national member societies and other closely affiliated organisations. In cases where we believe that additional services may be of interest to you, we may share your personal data with business partners of BDS to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the applicable law. We may also disclose this information to firms that perform services on our behalf to the extent permitted by applicable law. These service providers are required to provide for adequate protection of your personal data and to use it only for the purposes set out in this Policy.\n\nBDS may, in accordance with the respective requirements under the applicable law and solely for the purpose mentioned in this Policy, transfer your personal data to other jurisdictions. Except for the purposes set out in this Policy, we do not sell, rent or otherwise disclose to any third party any personal data about the Users, except with such person’s consent or as otherwise permitted or required by law.\n\nWe will store your personal data, in accordance with the applicable law, for so long as such data is needed for the purposes set out in this Policy.\n\nDATA SECURITY\n\nWe restrict access to personal data we store about you to those employees or other parties who need access to such data in order to provide services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data, including firewalls, individual passwords and encryption and authentication technology, and take all other necessary and adequate administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard the same against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification and to ensure its integrity.\n\nPlease note, however, that data transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody. BDS cannot guarantee, and is not responsible for, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks. When disclosing any personal data via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. In particular, while individual data packets are often encrypted, the names of the sender and recipient are not.\n\nEven if both the sender and recipient are located in the same country data may also be transmitted via such networks to other countries regularly and without controls, including countries that do not afford the same level of data protection as your country of domicile.\n\nYour data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorised parties. We do not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your data during its transfer via Internet. Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.\n\nINFORMATION RIGHTS\n\nUpon written request to BDS, Head Office FILIDA TRAVEL, Dore Pfanove 7, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia will notify you of all the personal data it stores about you. You may also request that any incorrect or incomplete personal data stored about you be corrected or that the personal data hold stored about you be deleted.\n\nCOOKIES\n\nIn addition to the ways of data collection set out in Section 1, we may also collect personal data about you by sending cookies to your computer. Cookies are strings of information that are sent out by a website and saved in your computer. We may use session specific cookies and “web bugs” to automatically collect data about website usage when you visit this Site, including your IP address, “click-stream” data regarding the portions of the site that you visit and the information or other services you obtain or input (including domain name, Internet service provider, protocol, browser type, operating system etc.) (“Usage Information”). This information is collected primarily for purposes of administering the Site, compiling demographic information and monitoring usage and performance of the Site. If you turn off the cookie function you may not receive all the information on this Site.\n\nWe may use cookies or web bugs on such portions of our Site to collect Usage Information, and to facilitate your movement within the Site (e.g. remembering passwords during a session and recording the country you may have elected as your country of residence). You can set your internet browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, some pages may not work properly and you do this at your own risk.\n\nLINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES\n\nThis Site may contain hyperlinks to other websites that are not operated or monitored by BDS. These other websites are not subject to this Policy and we are not responsible for their content or for the policies they apply to the treatment of personal data. We recommend that you read the policies used by these websites, and check how these websites protect your personal data and whether they are trustworthy.\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION\n\nThis Policy shall in all respects be governed by Croatian law. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Zagreb, Croatia."
