        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to the United States in the near future, you may want to exchange some of your money for U.S dollars, the country’s official currency. The international symbol for the currency is USD.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is also known colloquially as a “buck.”\n\nThis post has everything you need to know about converting euros to U.S. dollars, including where to secure the best exchange rates and how to avoid paying high fees on your conversion.\n\nHow to Convert Euros to U.S. Dollars\n\nCalculating the conversion of euros to U.S. dollars is fairly simple. You can either use a calculator or do it by hand.\n\n1. Use a Currency Calculator\n\nUsing a currency conversion calculator is often the easiest way to get an estimate when you’re converting currency. Since exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis, using a calculator can ensure your math is correct.\n\nKeep in mind that exchanging currency often comes with added fees that a conversion calculator won’t be able to predict. For instance, credit card companies and ATM networks usually charge a 1% conversion fee on all foreign transactions. Individual merchants may also charge supplemental fees if you ask them to convert the price of an item to your home currency at checkout.\n\n2. Calculate it Manually\n\nThe other option is to do the calculation manually using a simple mathematical formula. However, in order to do this, you need to know the current exchange rate. At the time of writing, €1 EUR is worth $0.99 USD.\n\nOnce you know that information, multiply the amount you have in USD by the current exchange rate. The resulting number will show you the amount in dollars you have to spend on your trip.\n\nManual Currency Conversion Example\n\nLet’s say you have €1,000 EUR and would like to figure out how many U.S. dollars you have for a trip to the United States. Using the current exchange rate, the formula for your conversion would look like this:\n\n€1,000 EUR x 0.99 = $999 USD\n\nHow to Buy U.S. Dollars\n\nWhen you’re ready to buy USD, it’s a good idea to plan ahead to ensure that you pay the fewest fees. Here are three ways to get the currency you need while minimizing the fees you’ll be charged:\n\nExchange at a bank or credit union before your trip: Heading to your bank before your trip is often the most cost-effective way to exchange currency. Since you have an existing relationship with them, your bank is likely to give you the best exchange rates and charge the lowest fees. For example, Germany’s Norddeutsche Landesbank charges a fee worth 2% of the payment amount.\n\nUse your bank’s ATM abroad for withdrawals where possible: Similarly, if you need to exchange more money while you’re on your trip, try to find an in-network ATM. For example, Spain’s Banco Santander also has branches in the United States. Most banking apps have an “ATM locator” feature to help you find the closest option, and using an ATM affiliated with your bank can help you avoid excess fees.\n\nOrder currency online: If your bank doesn’t offer online shipping, you can also use a third party to get currency delivered to your door. However, be aware of added costs with some of these vendors. For instance, Ireland’s No. 1 Currency Exchange advertises that it doesn’t charge an exchange fee. However, you’ll pay €9.95 for shipping on orders worth less than €750.\n\nWhat to Avoid When Exchanging Currency\n\nExchanging currency at the airport: While exchanging currency at the airport is unquestionably convenient, these kiosks often offer some of the worst exchange rates while charging some of the highest fees.\n\nNext Up:"
