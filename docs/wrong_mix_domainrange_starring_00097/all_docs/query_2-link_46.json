        "text": "Winona Ryder is no stranger to 80s and 90s nostalgia. But even in this era of constant reboots, she never thought she'd be re-visiting her role as suburban sweetheart Kim Boggs from 1990’s Edward Scissorhands. Yet when Cadillac came calling with an environmentally-friendly Super Bowl ad for their LYRIQ hands-free driving feature, Ryder slipped back into that blonde wig to play mom to Timothée Chalamet’s Edgar Scissorhands. The young actor, who has drawn plenty of comparisons to Johnny Depp, the original film's star, factored into her decision as well.\n\n“I loved the idea of getting to work with Timothée, who I’m such a fan of,” she told Vanity Fair. The film's original director, Tim Burton, wasn’t involved in the making of the spot, though he did give both the commercial and Ryder his explicit approval: “It’s rare when a work you’re proud of continues to live on and evolve with the times, even after 30 years. I’m glad to see Edgar coping with the new world! I hope both fans and those being introduced to Edward Scissorhands for the first time enjoy it.”\n\nDie-hard Chalamet fans were first tipped off to the actor's potential involvement in a Scissorhands project when he posted a snippet of the iconic Danny Elfman score in an Instagram video. Ryder herself said she was stunned when she first saw him in costume: “It was quite a moment. Very surreal and also just a very, very sweet moment for me. I was really blown away by him and everyone’s work putting the character together. He is such a beautiful guy, so talented, so incredibly kind and unique. Really the perfect person to embody that character.”\n\nThough the original film ends with Edward and Kim parting ways and Kim explaining that she never saw Edward again, this Cadillac ad gives the haunting fairytale a slightly different, more upbeat ending. As if there were any doubt, given his slice-and-dice appendages, Chalamet is officially playing Edward Scissorhands’ son, Edgar. But Edward doesn't get mentioned by name in the ad, nor is Johnny Depp’s name anywhere to be found in Cadillac's marketing material.\n\nStill: the idea of Cadillac's “Super Cruise” hands-free driving feature and a tortured boy with scissors for hands is a match made in advertising heaven. \"We love the creative concept of Super Cruise and the LYRIQ opening up Edgar's world and bringing confidence to his daily life,\" said Melissa Grady, Cadillac chief marketing officer. “At a time when people are looking for an escape from the challenges of the past year, it was a privilege to revisit the beloved story of Edward Scissorhands in a fresh, modern way and showcase Cadillac's electric future during the biggest game of the year.”\n\nAs for navigating the scissors themselves, Chalamet was apparently a quick study. Ryder said she didn't need to offer up any advice to him as Edgar cut his way through pineapples, footballs, his mom's hair, and more before drving off into the sunset to the sound of Elfman's famous score. “It was a pretty special thing to be able to revisit again,” Ryder said. “Even if just for a little while.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Stanley Tucci on His Love Story With Colin Firth\n\n— Why We Can’t Let Media Executives Reward Trump’s Cronies\n\n— The Hidden History of the Mary Pickford Cocktail\n\n— Thank You, Leslie Jones, for Making the News Feel Bearable\n\n— Cover Story: The Charming Billie Eilish\n\n— A Complete Beginner’s Guide to WandaVision\n\n— Gillian Anderson Breaks Down Her Career, From The X-Files to The Crown\n\n— From the Archive: Douglas Fairbanks Jr. on the Real Mary Pickford\n\n— Not a subscriber?
