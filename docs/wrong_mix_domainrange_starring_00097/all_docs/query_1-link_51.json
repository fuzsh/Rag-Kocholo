        "text": "Important film projects, big names on agenda\n\nBy Steven Rosen\n\nDenver Post Movie Critic\n\nSept. 5 - After a busy summer, Hollywood plans to relax for the rest of the year. Only 143 movies are scheduled for release between September and the end of December - a rate of better than one per day.\n\nThat number, which was compiled by Associated Press, includes independent-American and foreign-language films as well as such high-profile, big-studio projects as Jim Carrey's \"Man on the Moon,'' Tom Hanks' \"The Green Mile,'' and Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas' \"Random Hearts'' (which opens this year's Denver International Film Festival).\n\nIf past events repeat, some on the list never will actually see the dark of movie theaters. Others will open elsewhere but never make it here. But even considering all that, there is still a phenomenal number of movies - and many that sound interesting - coming our way.\n\nAssuming you can't see everything, what should you plan to see? Here's a subjective guide to 32 Movies That Matter. If you see them all, that's roughly two movies per week. Sounds reasonable, doesn't it? All release dates are for Denver and are tentative and appear in parentheses:\n\n\"For Love of the Game'\n\n- Why it matters: As an action-movie superhero ( \"The Postman,'' \"Waterworld''), Kevin Costner has become a joke. But as an aging athlete ( \"Bull Durham,'' \"Field of Dreams,'' \"Tin Cup''), he has instant credibility. Here he plays a struggling, veteran Detroit Tigers pitcher suddenly on the verge of a great achievement. (Sept. 17) \"Mumford'\n\n- Why it matters: Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan excels at ensemble pieces about \"our times'' - \"The Big Chill,'' \"The Accidental Tourist,'' \"Grand Canyon.'' This could be another; it's about the impact of a small-town psychologist on his clients. Loren Dean, Alfre Woodard and Robert Stack are among the large cast. (Sept. 24)\n\n\"Jakob the Liar'\n\n- Why it matters: After following his Oscar-winning role in \"Good Will Hunting'' with cloying, maudlin performances in \"What Dreams May Come'' and \"Patch Adams,'' Robin Williams tries to get serious again in this Holocaust story about a man who invents hopeful radio news bulletins for those trapped by the Nazis. (Sept. 24)\n\n\"American Beauty'\n\n- Why it matters: This black comedy about a troubled family has attracted attention as a mainstream \"Happiness'' with risky performances by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. (Oct. 1)\n\n'Guinevere'\n\n- Why it matters: Canadian actress Sarah Polley ( \"Go,'' \"The Sweet Hereafter'') has a star-making role in this Sundance-acclaimed, bittersweet comedy about a young woman's infatuation with an older man (Stephen Rea). Jean Smart's supporting role is Oscarcaliber. (Oct. 1)\n\n'Three Kings'\n\n- Why it matters: George Clooney finally got respect as a movie actor with last year's \"Out of Sight.'' Now he stars in a \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre''-like drama set in Iraq during the Gulf War. Director David O. Russell made the much-admired \"Flirting With Disaster.'' (Oct. 1)\n\n'Random Hearts'\n\n- Why it matters: Kristin Scott Thomas was wonderful playing opposite the older Robert Redford in \"The Horse Whisperer.'' Hopefully she can do the same with Harrison Ford in Sydney Pollack's romantic drama. (Oct. 8)\n\n'Happy, Texas'\n\n- Why it matters: At Sundance, this had everyone laughing at Steve Zahn's comic performance as an escaped con posing as a gay, small-town pageant organizer. (Oct. 8)\n\n'Fight Club'\n\n- Why it matters: Do you want tough, foreboding films about violence? David Fincher ( \"Seven,'' \"The Game'') specializes in them. In this tale of underground \"fight clubs,'' he has a great cast - Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. (Oct. 15)\n\n'The Story of Us'\n\n- Why it matters: Bruce Willis had his frayed acting credibility restored with \"The Sixth Sense.'' In this romantic comedy co-starring Michelle Pfeiffer and directed by Rob Reiner, he tries to maintain it. (Oct. 15)\n\n'Bringing Out the Dead'\n\n- Why it matters: Martin Scorsese returns home - the mean streets of New York - in this drama about a troubled ambulance medic. Nicolas Cage stars; Paul Schrader ( \"Taxi Driver'') adapted Joe Connelly's novel. (Oct. 22)\n\n'The Straight Story'\n\n- Why it matters: Director David Lynch was the toast of Cannes for turning his back on his past movies like \"Eraserhead'' and \"Blue Velvet'' to make this heartfelt, based-on-truth story about an old man riding his lawn mower to visit an ill brother. With Richard Farnsworth. (Oct. 22)\n\n'The Music of the Heart'\n\n- Why it matters: Just as the market for ironic teen-horror films has collapsed, \"Scream'' director Wes Craven shifts gears with this drama about a violin instructor in East Harlem. Oscar-perennial Meryl Streep stars with Gloria Estefan and Angela Bassett. (Oct. 29)\n\n'The Insider'\n\n- Why it matters: Al Pacino plays a \"60 Minutes'' producer pressured by CBS to not run a critical anti-tobacco story. Christopher Plummer plays Mike Wallace. Director Michael Mann's ( \"Heat'') film, about the inner workings of TV journalism, is based on a real scandal. (Nov. 5)\n\n'American Movie'\n\n- Why it matters: Not since \"Crumb'' has there been such a creepy yet funny documentary about dysfunction. The movie chronicles Wisconsin filmmaker Mark Borchardt's attempt to make a move no matter how bad it is. (Nov. 19)\n\n\"Sleepy Hollow'\n\n- Why it matters: Director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp, who teamed on \"Edward Scissorhands'' and \"Ed Wood,'' tackle Washington Irving's spooky tale. With Christina Ricci. (Nov. 19)\n\n\"Tumbleweeds'\n\n- Why it matters: Janet McTeer's acting is Oscar-worthy as a mom escaping from a bad relationship. Kimberley Brown plays her young daughter; Gavin O'Connor wrote and directed. (Nov. 19)\n\n'End of Days'\n\n- Why it matters: Arnold Schwarzenegger returns from heart surgery and tries to reclaim his title as Ah-nold, premier action hero. \"Niagara, Niagara's'' Robin Tunney co-stars. (Nov. 24) \"Toy Story 2' - Why it matters: We'll all be curious just how big this can't-miss Disney Thanksgiving offering is. (Nov. 25)\n\n\"Cradle Will Rock'\n\n- Why it matters: Director Tim Robbins delves into American cultural history in this Cannes-unveiled tale about Orson Welles' attempt to stage a left-wing musical in 1937. The cast includes Susan Sarandon, Vanessa Redgrave, Emily Watson and Bill Murray. (Dec. 10)\n\n'Magnolia'\n\n- Why it matters: The story is a secret, but it is Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up to \"Boogie Nights.'' And it has Tom Cruise in its ensemble cast. Consider the possibilities! (Dec. 10)\n\n\"The Green Mile'\n\n- Why it matters: Tom Hanks, who can do no wrong, stars in it.\n\nAnd like 1994's hit \"The Shawshank Redemption,'' Frank Darabont directed from a Stephen King story about prison life. (Dec. 17)\n\n\"The Cider House Rules'\n\n- Why it matters: John Irving adapts his own novel for Lasse Hallstrom's film starring Tobey Maguire, Michael Caine and Cahrlize Theron. (Dec. 17)\n\n\"Man on the Moon'\n\n- Why it matters: This study of the late bizarre comedian Andy Kaufman stars Jim Carrey in his first role since \"The Truman Show,'' with direction by \"The People vs. Larry Flynt's'' Milos Forman. (Dec. 25)\n\n\"The Talented Mr. Ripley'\n\n- Why it matters: A thriller based on a Patricia Highsmith nov el previously made into the French classic \"Purple Noon,'' this has a young cast to die for - Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, Jude Law and Philip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nDirector Anthony Minghella is following up \"The English Patient.'' (Dec. 24)\n\n\"Hanging Up'\n\n- Why it matters: Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow are sisters reunited by concern for their father (Walter Matthau). Keaton directed from a screenplay by Delia and Nora Ephron. (Dec. 25)\n\n\"Any Given Sunday'\n\n- Why it matters: Oliver Stone's taste for bone-crunching violence has the perfect subject in this football tale starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Ann-Margret and Charlton Heston. (Dec. 25)\n\n\"Daddy and Them'\n\n- Why it matters: Writer-director-star Billy Bob Thornton tries to prove \"Sling Blade'' was no fluke. The good cast includes Laura Dern, Diane Ladd and Brenda Blethyn. (Dec. 25)\n\n\"Snow Falling on Cedars'\n\n- Why it matters: Australian di rector Scott Hicks, who made \"Shine,'' returns with this adaptation of David Guterson's novel about a racially-charged murder on an island near Seattle. The cast includes Ethan Hawke, Sam Shepard, Max Von Sydow and James Cromwell. (Jan. 7)\n\n\"Angela's Ashes'\n\n- Why it matters: Frank McCourt's memoir of his Irish upbringing gets a respectful adaptation from Alan Parker, with Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle. (Jan. 7)\n\n\"The Hurricane'\n\n- Why it matters: Denzel Washington plays Rubin \"Hurricane'' Carter, a real-life boxer wrongfully sent to prison for a triple murder.\n\nCarter eventually was released. (Jan. 14)\n\n\"Dogma'\n\n- Why it matters: No film will be more controversial than Kevin Smith's profane comedy about his religion, Catholicism.\n\nIts original distributor, Miramax Films, chose not to release it. The cast includes Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, and Alanis Morissette as God. (Release not yet set)"
