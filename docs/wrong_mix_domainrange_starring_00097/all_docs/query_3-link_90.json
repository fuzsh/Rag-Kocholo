        "text": "It's one of the great actor-director partnerships of modern cinema: Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have made seven films together, beginning with Edward Scissorhands in 1990, taking in Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow and Sweeney Todd, and hitting the financial jackpot with the recent Alice in Wonderland. The pair have now embarked on their eighth film, an adaptation of the 1960s TV \"gothic soap opera\" Dark Shadows.\n\nDepp, currently the world's highest-earning film actor, will take on the role of vampire Barnabas Collins, the character credited with reviving the fortunes of the original TV show, which ran daily in the US between 1966 and 1971, clocking up over 1,200 episodes. Collins, originally played by actor Jonathan Frid, was a 175-year-old vampire who was released from his coffin in the show's 211th episode. Depp has reportedly been obsessed with the character since watching the series as a child.\n\nThe mooted adaptation has been around for a considerable period, with Depp attached for the past three years, according to Variety. But with no sign of audiences' thirst for vampire movies being slaked any time soon, producing studio Warner Bros has set production to begin early next year after Depp finishes work on the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Mash-up author Seth Grahame-Smith (of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter renown) will write the script."
