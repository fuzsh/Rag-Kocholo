        "text": "Tim Burton‘s incredible career will be celebrated in an upcoming four-part documentary series, and Deadline reports this morning that the project is headed to the Cannes market.\n\nDirected by Tara Wood, the documentary is currently untitled, and Deadline reports that Wood Entertainment is handling sales at the aforementioned Cannes market.\n\nInterview subjects for the doc include Burton collaborators Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, Jenna Ortega, composer Danny Elfman, Christopher Walken, Danny DeVito, Mia Wasikowska, and Christoph Waltz.\n\nThe docuseries is said to feature new interviews and never-before-seen footage.\n\nDeadline details, “The series promises ‘an otherworldly, dream journey into the mind’ of the man behind Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, Wednesday, and many other indelible projects.”\n\n“Tim continues to build his aesthetic, the Burton-esque style, derived from a wealth of art, cinematic and literary genres,” a press release notes. “The documentary explores how Burton brings his vision to life through his own joyous idiosyncrasy and his ability to meld the ominous and the frightful with a sense of whimsy. Tim’s films are just the tip of the iceberg.”\n\n“In the making of this doc, Tim’s creative family, a gaggle of creative genius, met me with open hearts and enthusiasm to share their profound insights into Tim’s unique, magical world,” Tara Wood said. “And it has been a truly inspiring, joyous and life-changing experience. Whatever you do or where you come from, Tim’s story will inspire you.”\n\nFrom Blumhouse Television, the documentary series “Worst Roommate Ever” highlights harrowing tales of seemingly harmless roommates turning into real-life nightmares for their unsuspecting victims, and that series (which airs on Netflix) was based on a New York Magazine article by William Brennan. Blumhouse is now turning that same article into a movie.\n\nVariety reports this week that Paul Feig (Ghostbusters: Answer the Call, A Simple Favor) will direct the upcoming feature film thriller for Blumhouse.\n\nThe website details, “Feig’s film will follow a newly single woman who finds a “seemingly perfect gentleman” to sublet a spare room in her home. However, she quickly discovers that his lies extend beyond providing a fake name and falsified application.\n\n“She has unwittingly invited a serial squatter into her home and he’s not going to leave without a fight.”\n\nStephen Susco (Unfriended: Dark Web) wrote the screenplay.\n\nFeig will produce with his producing partner Laura Fischer, alongside Jason Blum.\n\n“Jason and I have been trying to find the perfect project to collaborate on for years and this story is tailor-made to deliver the scares, thrills, emotion and comedy of dread that both he and I like to entertain audiences with,” Feig said in a statement. “In other words, I couldn’t be happier to have Jason as the best roommate ever for this film.”\n\n“Worst Roommate Ever resonates so much because as the internet has connected so many of us, it also makes it easier than ever to lie about who you are. But then the story is jaw-dropping and keeps you on the edge of your seat,” Blum said in a statement. “Paul is the perfect director for this because his work always manages to strike a balance between the dark and the light, and I’m very excited to see everything he will bring to this story.”\n\nYou can stream two seasons of “Worst Roommate Ever” on Netflix now."
