        "text": "Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American fantasy romance film directed by Tim Burton. It was produced by Burton and Denise Di Novi, written by Caroline Thompson from a story by her and Burton, and starring Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Anthony Michael Hall, Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, Alan Arkin, and Vincent Price. It tells the story of an unfinished artificial humanoid who has scissor blades instead of hands that is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter.\n\nBurton conceived Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Caroline Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros. declined. Edward Scissorhands was then fast tracked after Burton's critical and financial success with Batman. The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman, and was Vincent Price's last major role.\n\nEdward Scissorhands was released to a positive reception from critics and was a financial success, grossing over four times its $20 million budget. The film received numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and the Saturn Awards, as well as winning the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work.\n\nStoryline[]\n\nPlot[]\n\nA scientist (Vincent Price) builds an animated human being -- the gentle Edward (Johnny Depp). The scientist dies before he can finish assembling Edward, though, leaving the young man with a freakish appearance accentuated by the scissor blades he has instead of hands. Loving suburban saleswoman Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for Peg's teen daughter (Winona Ryder). However, despite his kindness and artistic talent, Edward's hands make him an outcast.\n\nGenres[]\n\nRomance\n\nCult film\n\nFantasy\n\nDrama\n\nMotion Picture Rating[]\n\n13 (Argentina)\n\nPG (Australia)\n\n6 (Austria)\n\nLivre (Brazil)\n\nB (Bulgaria)\n\nPG (Canada)\n\n13+ (Canada) (Québec)\n\nG (Canada) (re-rating, Québec)\n\nTE (Chile)\n\nT (Colombia)\n\n12 (Czechia)\n\n11 (Denmark)\n\nK-3 (Finland) (2007, Blu-ray cover)\n\nK-10 (Finland) (1991, cut)\n\nK-12 (Finland) (1991, uncut)\n\nTous publics (France)\n\n6 (Germany)\n\nK-8 (Greece)\n\nI (Hong Kong)\n\n12 (Hungary)\n\n12 (Iceland)\n\nU (India)\n\nSU (Indonesia)\n\nPG (Ireland)\n\nPG (Israel)\n\nT (Italy)\n\nG (Japan)\n\nPG12 (Japan) (2010)\n\nU (Malaysia)\n\nB (Mexico)\n\nMG6 (Netherlands)\n\nPG (New Zealand)\n\nG (Nigeria)\n\n11 (Norway) (Blu-ray rating)\n\n9 (Norway) (2019)\n\n10 (Norway) (1991, cut)\n\n14 (Peru)\n\nG (Philippines)\n\n7 (Poland)\n\nM/12 (Portugal)\n\n12+ (Russia)\n\nG (Saudi Arabia)\n\nPG (Singapore)\n\nPG (South Africa)\n\n12 (South Korea)\n\nA (Spain) (ICAA)\n\n11 (Sweden) (cut)\n\nGP (Taiwan)\n\nG (Thailand)\n\n7+ (Turkey)\n\nPG (UK) (slightly cut)\n\n12 (UK) (2007, Blu-ray, uncut)\n\nTV-PG (USA) (LSV, TV Rating.)\n\nTV-14 (USA) (cable rating)\n\nPG-13 (USA)\n\nZA (Ukraine)\n\nPG-13 (United Arab Emirates) (self-applied)\n\nP (Vietnam)\n\n6 (West Germany)\n\nImages[]\n\nCast and Crew[]\n\nDirector[]\n\nTim Burton\n\nWriting Credits (WGA)[]\n\nTim Burton (story) &\n\nCaroline Thompson (story)\n\nCaroline Thompson (screenplay)\n\nCast[]\n\nJohnny Depp - Edward Scissorhands\n\nWinona Ryder - Kim\n\nDianne Wiest - Peg\n\nAnthony Michael Hall - Jim\n\nKathy Baker - Joyce\n\nRobert Oliveri - Kevin\n\nConchata Ferrell - Helen\n\nCaroline Aaron - Marge\n\nDick Anthony Williams - Officer Allen\n\nO-Lan Jones - Esmeralda\n\nVincent Price - The Inventor\n\nAlan Arkin - Bill\n\nSusan Blommaert - Tinka (as Susan J.

Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing Edward Scissorhands on the scale of \"an E.T.-sized blockbuster,\" but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. \"We have to let it find its place. We want to be careful not to hype the movie out of the universe,\" he reasoned. Edward Scissorhands had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. Edward Scissorhands eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film is considered a box office success. The New York Times wrote \"the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were together in real life at the time (1989–1993), gave the film teen idol potential, drawing younger audiences.\"\n\nCritical response[]\n\nThe film has a 7.9 rating on IMDb and a 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nCompany Credits[]\n\nProduction Companies[]\n\n20th Century Fox (presents)\n\nDistributors[]\n\n20th Century Fox (1990) (USA) (theatrical)\n\n20th Century Fox (1991) (UK) (theatrical) (as 20th Century Fox Film Co.
