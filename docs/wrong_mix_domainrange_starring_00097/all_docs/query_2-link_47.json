        "text": "As the cameras continue to roll in the UK under the direction of Tim Burton, the sequel to 1988 cult fantasy comedy horror ‘Beetlejuice’ is adding to its cast.\n\nSo far, the movie’s ensemble has been a mix of returning cast from the original movie and some new additions as the story moves forward into the present day.\n\nThe original, as you may know, saw a couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) getting into an accident while driving home to their dream house. When they realize that A) they’re now dead and B) that their house has been sold to an extremely annoying new family (including Lydia Deetz, played by Winona Ryder, who forms a bond with them), they engage the services of a “bio-exorcist” from the Netherworld. Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) promises to rid them of the frustrating new dwellers, but his chaotic style ends up threatening everyone.\n\nWho is starring in ‘Beetlejuice 2’?\n\nKeaton and Ryder are back alongside Catherine O’Hara, who played Delia Deetz’, Lydia’s stepmother) with ‘Scream’s Jenna Ortega (who starred for Burton in the recent Netflix hit ‘Addams Family’ spin-off ‘Wednesday’) playing Ryder’s daughter and Monica Bellucci (reportedly as Betelgeuse’s wife) and Justin Theroux as new recruits.\n\nAnd Willem Dafoe is joining them to play a ghostly police officer, according to Giant Freakin’ Robot.\n\nRelated Article: Monica Bellucci Joins ‘Beetlejuice 2’, Reportedly as the Title Character’s Wife\n\nThe ‘Beetlejuice’ sequel so far\n\n1988’s ‘Beetlejuice’ saw the spirits of a deceased couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) harassed by an unbearable family (Jeffrey Jones as Charles Deetz, Catherine O’Hara as Delia Deetz and Ryder as Charles’ daughter, along with various assistants and hangers-on) that has moved into their home, and hire a malicious spirit (Keaton’s Betelgeuse, which is how his name is spelled) to drive them out.\n\nBut when Betelgeuse’s malicious chaos becomes too much, the ghostly couple team up with Lydia to try and stop him. Famously, he’s summoned by saying his name three times.\n\nBurton enjoyed making ‘Beetlejuice’ enough that in 1990 hired Jonathan Gems to write a sequel called ‘Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian’, which would have seen the Deetz’ head to the island nation to open a resort, only to build on the burial ground of an ancient Hawaiian Kahuna. The spirit comes back from the afterlife to cause trouble, and Betelgeuse’s services are once more reluctantly required.\n\nThe idea languished in development for nearly a decade, going through different scripts and potential writers (including ‘Heathers’ Daniel Waters, who instead went to work on ‘Batman Returns’ for Burton and Kevin Smith, who turned down the idea in favor of the similarly doomed ‘Superman Lives’), before ending its limbo status in apparent failure around 1997.\n\nYet after years of official silence, Warner Bros. decided to try again, hiring Seth Grahame-Smith to write a script that would set the story in contemporary times with Ryder and Burton back. But even that didn’t turn into anything, despite Mike Vukadinovich re-writing the script.\n\nThe current version boasts a script from ‘Wednesday’ creators and Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.\n\n‘Beetlejuice 2’ should be in theaters on September 6th, 2024.\n\nOther Movies Similar to ‘Beetlejuice 2:’\n\n'Gremlins' (1984)\n\n'The Witches of Eastwick' (1987)\n\n‘Beetlejuice' (1988)\n\n'Edward Scissorhands' (1990)\n\n'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993)\n\n'The Frighteners' (1996)\n\n'Sleepy Hollow' (1999)\n\n'The Others' (2001)\n\n'Corpse Bride' (2005)\n\n'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' (2007)\n\n'Shutter Island' (2010)\n\n'Frankenweenie' (2012)\n\n'Dark Shadows' (2012)"
