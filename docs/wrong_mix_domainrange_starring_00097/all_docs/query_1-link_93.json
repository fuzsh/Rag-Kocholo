        "text": "There is an alternate universe out there where film collections are filled with movies that might have been but never were. In this collection there are copies of Ridley Scott’s I AM LEGEND with Arnold Schwarzenegger, THE LORD OF THE RINGS directed by John Boorman and starring The Beatles(!), Vincent Ward’s ALIEN 3, with Luddite monks in space and Edgar Wright’s version of ANT MAN. The crown jewel in this parallel dimension would be SUPERMAN LIVES, directed by Tim Burton and starring Nicolas Cage. Released in the alternate 1997, it would have been a radical take on the character, an insanely budgeted blockbuster where Burton’s unique approach to visual design would have run riot and Cage would have played a weirder, more human take on the Man of Steel. As with many of these unmade masterpieces, SUPERMAN LIVES was just too original, too odd and imaginative to ever get past the politics of Hollywood. This is the story of an unmade film that could have been at once a disastrous vision of a director run amok and a brilliantly original take on the superhero genre.\n\nSUPERMAN: THE MOVIE(1978) and its sequel SUPERMAN II (1980) not only launched the iconic hero on the big screen but also showed Hollywood that the previously mocked superhero film could be a viable blockbuster success. Brilliantly capturing the innocent, All American persona of Superman and a carefully balanced mixture of campy tone and sincere emotions and powered by Christopher Reeve’s definitive take on the Man of Steel and his alter ego Clark Kent the films dominated the public’s opinion of the character. However, after two further sequels of diminishing quality and the phenomenal success of Tim Burton’s dark and sexy BATMAN films, Superman seemed to disappear from the minds of audiences.\n\nThen Jon Peters arrived on the scene. Peters began his career in Hollywood as a hairdresser to the stars (Warren Beatty’s womanising character in SHAMPOO was apparently based on Peters) before using his relationship with Barbara Streisand to become a movie producer. Famous for his bullish personality and ego, he often butted heads with his directors with his constant creative “suggestions”, most famously when he insisted on inserting a bizarre scene in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK, where Jack Nicholson turns into a giant monster, much to the annoyance of director George Miller(MAD MAX). His biggest success as producer was with 1989’S BATMAN, which he exerted a considerable amount of creative control. He made the smart decision to select a young up and coming director in Tim Burton, who’s dark and offbeat visual style took the superhero genre into edgy new directions. He also was instrumental in the choice of Michael Keaton in the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne. This was an incredibly controversial choice at the time as Keaton was famous for his comedy roles like BEETLEJUICE and MR MOM and seemed an unlikely choice for a superhero. When the film was released, fans forgot all about the controversy when they saw Keaton’s performance. Personally, I still think he is the best cinematic Batman: he brings a coiled fury and sense of humour to his Caped Crusader and has a sense of barely suppressed mania that makes him convincing as a guy who would dress up as a bat and beat up criminals. Also the logical argument that Peters and Burton give for Keaton’s casting holds water; that a more muscular and conventional action man would not need to dress up as Batman. However, the slight and unimposing Keaton would need to become Batman to terrify hardened criminals. Some of Peter’s other decisions were more questionable. His insistence on shoehorning pop songs by Prince (admittedly most of them are typically catchy) into the film disrupts the dark, Gothic tone and takes away from Danny Elfman’s incredible score; his insistence on changing the ending at the last minute was the cause of the film’s haphazard storytelling. Thankfully some of his more outlandish ideas were nixed, chiefly his idea to have the Batsuit covered in Nike symbols and his desire to change the iconic “I’m Batman” line to “I’m Batman, motherfucker!” On his next big project, Peters was determined to get his way and he soon found his next property: Superman.\n\nPeters bought the rights to Superman and set up the project with Warner Brothers. Looking to build on the success of the BATMAN films and the sudden resurgence in popularity of the character of Superman, thanks to both the Dean Cain/Teri Hatcher TV series LOIS & CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN and the then recent comic book series The Death of Superman, the studio started getting things moving. Using the same storyline as The Death of Superman comic series, the new film would feature Superman, who has been on Earth for some time. He would be killed in a battle with a murderous space alien called Doomsday leaving the planet at the mercy of evil Kryptonian cyborg Brainiac. Superman would be resurrected and rescue his adopted home world. The first draft was written by Gregory Poirer (with the working title SUPERMAN REBORN)but that was soon rejected. Things really began to kick into gear when the studio commissioned a script by Kevin Smith, writer/director of indie comedy dramas CLERKS, MALLRATS and CHASING AMY and die hard comic book fan. Smith pitched his take to Peters who insisted on his own parameters for the new script. These were:\n\n1) Superman would not be seen in his suit\n\n2) He would not be seen flying\n\n3) Superman would fight a giant spider in the third act.\n\nA bemused Smith challenged Peters on his bizarre parameters but Peter’s insisted. According to Smith, Peters said the traditional suit was “too faggy” (this comment angered Smith, whose brother is gay, Peters denies he said this). He also felt that scenes of Superman flying around, catching people were “bullshit”. His insane idea to feature a scene where Superman fights a giant spider came from a childhood memory of seeing KING KONG, specifically the scene where the giant gate is opened up and Kong is revealed for the first time. He wanted a scene where a door opens and a giant, terrifying spider is revealed and Superman was to fight him to the death. With these parameters in mind Smith set about writing his script.\n\nKevin Smith’s SUPERMAN LIVES\n\nSmith wrote two drafts of the script and these were the basis for the subsequent versions. He changed the title from SUPERMAN REBORN to SUPERMAN LIVES (Smith said the original title was so cynical it might as well have been called SUPERMAN REBRANDED). In his draft, Superman has been Earth’s protector for several years. He still carries on his persona of Clark Kent, although Lois Lane knows who he really is and they are in a long term relationship. Lex Luthor sends a signal into space and summons Brainiac, a Kryptonian supercomputer that absorbs the energy of all it comes into contact. Brainiac arrives and blocks out the Sun, robbing Superman of the solar energy that is the source of his powers. Brainiac unleashes Doomsday, an unstoppable alien that fights Superman as the Earth is plunged into darkness. Superman uses his last ounce of strength to defeat Doomsday and dies in Lois’s arms. The world is in mourning when Luthor and Brainiac plot to take over the planet. Superman’s body vanishes, teleported to the Fortress of Solitude, his Arctic hideaway. He is revived by a Kryptonian cyborg The Eradicator, who was sent to Earth by Superman’s father Jor-El to protect the Last Son of Krypton. Superman discovers that he has no powers and in one great scene (that was later used in Sam Raimi’s SPIDER-MAN 2) he rescues a family from a fire, giving him his first taste of fear and proving his innate heroism. The Eradicator can change into an armoured suit and Superman wears this for much of the second act, forming a typically Kevin Smith buddy comedy duo with the robot. Eventually the Eradicator sacrifices himself to destroy the Shadowcaster and a repowered Superman attacks Brainiac’s ship to rescue the captured Lois. Superman battles a Thegnarian Snare Beast (Peters’ giant alien spider) defeating it and Brainiac. In a triumphant final scene Superman returns to Earth with Lois bringing sunlight back to the planet.\n\nSmith has called his script for SUPERMAN LIVES “fan fiction” and that’s exactly how it reads. (The screenplay is available to read online.) Smith fills his script with cameos and references to other DC characters including Deadshot and even an appearance by Batman himself on a screen during Superman’s funeral (Smith intended for Keaton to play the role in this scene, despite having been replaced by Val Kilmer for BATMAN FOREVER). It contains Smith’s trademark comedic dialogue but obviously lacks the raunchiness for which he is famous. It does feel like a compromised work, some of Peters’ suggestions are in there but breezed over, most obviously in the very brief giant spider fight and in his description of Superman’s suit. (Smith simply writes “Superman, Uh 90’s style”). The most impressive element of the screenplay is the tone Smith creates. It is almost the Marvel style before there was such a thing. Upbeat and funny without being campy and full of action, Smith’s take would have been a perfect slice of feel good summer entertainment. Most importantly, Smith seems to understand the essence of Superman and using his knack for dialogue finds the right “voice” for the character, capturing both his heroism and his down to earth, boyish humour. Smith was also offered the chance to direct but as anyone who has seen his films will know, putting it mildly, he is not much of a visual stylist. Smith felt that he didn’t have the technical skills or the inclination to make such a special effects and action driven film. Peters offered the director’s chair to Smith’s friend Robert Rodriguez (DESPERADO, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, SPY KIDS) who is much more of an action specialist. Rodriguez loved the script and thought it would be a great, feel good summer movie but knew that it would be like that no matter who directed it. Feeling that he would be little more than a hired gun, Rodriguez passed. The hunt was on for a new director, someone who could handle the visual aspect of the film and bring a unique spin to the character. Enter Tim Burton.\n\nAfter the phenomenal success of BATMAN, Burton became almost his own brand. EDWARD SCISSORHANDS perfectly cemented his style: kooky, Gothic imagery, an offbeat sense of humour and most importantly, a poignant, sympathetic view of an outsider. Burton then made BATMAN RETURNS, one of the strangest, raunchiest and surprisingly touching blockbusters of all time. After producing the stop motion classic THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, Burton had become a household name and one of the most powerful directors in Hollywood. However, ED WOOD, his heartfelt depiction of the filmmaker dubbed by many as the worst of all time, was a critical hit but was a commercial flop. MARS ATTACKS!, his next film was a disaster. Despite some funny moments and inventive design the film is unusually cold and nasty for Burton and audiences stayed away in droves. Burton was in the first real low point of his career and needed a sure thing for his next film. Then Warner Brothers came calling with Smith’s script for SUPERMAN LIVES. From the studio’s point of view it was logical: Get the guy who had made the studio over half a billion dollars and kick started the comic book movie genre with the first two BATMAN films. Burton, besides the more cynical motivation that he needed a hit film, wanted to break away from his reputation for dark and twisted visuals and felt like SUPERMAN would give him a chance to experiment with a lighter, sunnier style. He also connected emotionally with the story of Superman, an alien stranded on Earth, a sympathetic outsider, the ultimate Burton hero.\n\nBut who would play the Man of Steel? Kevin Smith’s script not only led to Tim Burton signing on as director but also attracted the interest of the hottest Hollywood stars. Daniel Day-Lewis was considered but wasn’t interested. Paul Goss, star of the then popular TV comedy DUE SOUTH and John Cusack were discussed. Tim Burton apparently favoured British actor Ralph Fiennes, at that point riding high on the successes of SCHINDLER’S LIST and QUIZ SHOW.\n\nThen the news was announced: Nicolas Cage was to be the new Superman/Clark Kent.\n\nWait, what?\n\nNowadays Cage has become something of a joke. His Brandoesque taste for oddball method acting has slipped into caricature and a series of flop films has tarnished his movie star credentials. But in the late Nineties Cage was in the form of his life. After starting out in comedies like RAISING ARIZONA, MOONSTRUCK and HONEYMOON IN VEGAS, Cage had worked with David Lynch in his nightmarish, Wizard of Oz/lovers on the run mash up WILD AT HEART, demonstrating that he was an actor unafraid to take risks. He won the Best Actor Oscar in 1996 for his tragic portrayal of a suicidal alcoholic in Mike Figgis’ LEAVING LAS VEGAS and had convinced as an action hero in films like THE ROCK and FACE/OFF. Cage was one of the hottest actors around but he was an odd choice for Superman. He is not the traditional, square-jawed All American guy you picture when you think of the Man of Steel. He is about as far away from Christopher Reeve as you can get. However, it is precisely why Burton selected him. Burton has been described as a de-constructivist, someone who is always looking to subvert the traditional way of thinking. Nic Cage wanted to play Superman as more human, a little of the wall, as an outsider longing to fit in. Like much of the ideas in SUPERMAN LIVES it could have been brilliant, a more relatable, vulnerable take on Superman or a disaster, Cage at his worst, over the top, obtuse and full of annoying tics. Unfortunately we will never know.\n\nSo it seemed like everything was all set for SUPERMAN LIVES: an exciting script by an idiosyncratic writer, a visionary director and an Oscar-winning star. What could go wrong? In short: Everything.\n\nEND OF PART ONE\n\nI’ve split this article into two due to its length.
