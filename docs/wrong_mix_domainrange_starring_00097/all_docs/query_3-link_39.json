        "text": "Smith has taken everyday occurrences, added humor and a bit of obscenity and crafted them into scripts. Smith has then taken these scripts and directed, and produced full-length films in which he also acted. After the film was fully shot, Smith then edited all of his films (with the exception of “Mallrats”). Because of all of the work that Smith single-handedly put into his independent films that ended up drawing a huge crowd of fans, he can surely be called an auteur.\n\nA film director controls a film's dramatic and artistic aspects, and over a number of their films, they produce recurrent themes or characteristics of style seen throughout their creations by the use of repeated subject matter, being referred to as their 'preoccupations'. When a director's style is recognizable, they are considered an ' auteur', denoting that they influence their films so strongly, to the extent that they are considered a kind of author of their movies. This is supported by the quote \"Over a group of films a director must exhibit certain recurrent characteristics of style, which serve as his signature.”, from Andrew Sarris, a Prevailing Film Critic of the Late 1900's, whom pioneered the auteur theory. Many directors were reviewed by Andrew Sarris, namely established and popular director Tim Burton, who is deemed as an auteur, particularly for his preoccupation with Gothic Horror literature, and its common elements. Some of his famous movies of the last fifty decades, include 'Alice In Wonderland', 'Edward Scissor Hands' and 'Big Fish'. Burton's preoccupations are prominent in all previously mentioned films.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is a 52-year-old Caucasian male from Knoxville, Tennessee. He is credited for writing 23 films, acting in 34, producing 21, and directing 17. Quentin Tarantino is considered an auteur because the roles he plays in the making of every single film he is involved in. The Oxford Dictionary defines an auteur as “a film director who influences their films so much that they rank as their author. Every film by Quentin Tarantino is permeated by his unique and recognizable style from start to finish.\n\n“A true film auteur is someone who brings something genuinely personal to his subject, instead of producing something tasteful, accurate but lifeless rendering of the original material,” a quote by Francois Truffaut. Auteur Theory was bold and risky for Francois Truffaut and Orson Welles to carry out throughout their film, but doing so led to having a wider audience and creating impressive memorial films. This New Wave of cinema had inspired many film makers to go outside the box and has led to the creation of idolizing films. An example would be Tim Burton, who has created many loved fantasy films from his unique out-there approach to directing. Auteur Theory has really shown us the importance of creating subjects of work that really reflect\n\nIn an article for The Atlantic titled “Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom' Opens Cannes on a Sweet Note” (2012), Paris-based film critic Jon Frosch argues that the refreshing adolescent romance in Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom displays an intimate side of the director that manages to overcome the “dollhouse aesthetic” and pedantic cinematography of the 65th Cannes Film Festival opening film. By pairing brief narration of the film with personal opinion, Frosch illustrates how his attitude towards Moonrise Kingdom transitions from skeptical during the initial scenes, to intrigued when Anderson characterizes his two quirky protagonists, then to impressed when witnessing a revived take on the classic kiss, and finally to a forfeiting acceptance upon realizing Anderson has delivered a uniquely eccentric yet heartwarming film. Frosch analyzes\n\nThe essay film, as contextualized in this course by Agnès Varda and Ross McElwee, has been defined by many traits, perhaps most notable in the physical presence of said directors in their films; at times on screen, at times in voiceovers, sometimes a combination of thereof. Over the span of several class meetings, this particular trait (the film maker’s presence a la Varda and McElwee) and its implications became the epicenter of most discussions, as well as the assumed baseline by which other directors would be critiqued. In this paper, the argument advanced is that by the standard(s) that emerged from the class’ discussions and evaluations of the aforementioned directors, Errol Morris—specifically in his films The Thin Blue Line and The Fog of War—technically is not an essayistic film maker. However, this stance also states that Morris is a film-essayist by other means, in that Morris simply implements Laura Rascaroli’s thoughts on reflectivity and subjectivity in a form dissimilar to Varda and McElwee.\n\nThe dictionary defines an Auteur as a filmmaker whose individual style and complete control over all elements of production give a film its personal and unique stamp. The auteur theory states, the director that overseas all the audio and visuals elements of a film is considered it’s author. Even though the definition of an auteur has been highly debated since the 1940’s, the director is the one that brings a film to life and uses it as an opportunity to express their views on the matter in discussion. The auteur I choose to study was Martin Scorsese, a highly acclaimed director behind some of the most iconic films ever made. After he left his job as a teacher at NYU, Scorsese released his first feature film Who’s that knocking at my door?.\n\nAfter viewing and an examination of one of Paul Thomas Anderson success film ‘Magnolia’, I have analysed that Anderson uses multiple themes involving regret and loneliness in the film which is connected to auteur theory. What I am going to examine is: How were the themes and the characters are related? How did Anderson’s film techniques affect in the film? And why did Anderson use his similar style within the film? These questions are to give an understanding that focuses mainly on auteur theory in the film.\n\nAn auteur is a filmmaker whose movies are characterized by their creative influence. Garry Marshall is an American filmmaker, he has directed more than 15 films in his career. Garry Marshall’s films The Princess Diaries, Valentines Day and Overboard share a common theme of love and a genre of romance and comedy, he likes to use the same actors in his films and have the common plot of a double twist. Garry Marshall likes to keep to the same character persona and film techniques but these generalized similarities are not obvious to the audience, therefore Garry Marshall is not a recognizable Auteur.\n\nIt might be apparent when watching the credits at the end of a movie that there are a lot of people who partake in the development in what you just watched. Although a director can’t usually create and perform all the aspects involved when making a film, the Auteur Theory focuses on the idea that the director is the true author, and creditable for the final look of the film. Auteur Theory is a philosophy of film created by Francois Truffaut, a film director and critic, in 1959. “Truffaut noted that ‘the directors are, and wish to be, responsible for the scenarios and dialogues that they illustrate.’” said in Society for Cinema & Media Studies by Donald E. Staples. Auteurism was considered to flow in film work from France to England over\n\n“… As far as I know, there is no definition of the auteur theory in the English language, that is, by an American or British critic” (Sarris 1962) was the opening line to Andrew Sarris’s famous “Notes on the Auteur Theory in 1962” essay. This essay is what brought the “auteur theory” in to the spotlight in the USA. And to today, this theory is still in hot debate. Trying to figure out whether or not the director is the lone “auteur” of a film is a tough claim to make. In an article for Slate Magazine, Doree Shafrir talks about why a writer cannot be an auteur in “Bored of Directors.” In his film blog, Fredrik Fevang posted an article about misconceptions of auteur theory critics titled “Dan Schneider and James Berardinelli's misconception\n\nThe idea of auteurship is one that is surrounded by the domineering presence of the white male, with little exception: a simple Google search of “film auteurs” produces thousands of results of websites listing off the likes of Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and David Lynch. However, one early female filmmaker—who, like too many other important women of the past, has been mostly buried by history—stands above the rest. Often viewed in the same regard as male contemporaries such as D. W. Griffith, Lois Weber used her platform as a universally acclaimed creator (at the time) to make socially conscious films that advocated the underprivileged. Although her works are heavily influenced by her belief in Christian charity, they never seem to steer into the dreaded “preachy” territory that so many other religiously motivated films fall victim to.\n\nThe question at hand states, “In evaluating a film, should we interpret and evaluate it by considering how the film is the creative work of a single author or auteur?” (Yenter, “Essay Information”). Understanding my claim requires an understanding of what an auteur is. The original “auteur theory” is the idea that the director is the sole author of the film. There are three different strategies that are typically used to argue for the theory of single authorship.\n\nThe concept behind the Auteur Theory suggests the artist have complete control over their artistic vision as a result of the writer and/or director working outside of the studio system in an arthouse context. In classical Hollywood, the director was essentially an employee often with limited control over the types of film they made, strips they had and casts they worked with (Thomas, AJ. 2015). The Auteur Theory becomes a challenging concept for the director him/herself. Within that context, the idea of expressing a personal vision becomes more complex as the director has more of a limited capacity over controlling the elements to make that vision. Authorship in this sense is the idea of how the director expresses that perspective within the\n\nThe debate about the definition of auteur has been going on since the 1940’s, the original writers of the theory consist of a group of French cinema enthusiasts such as; Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol. The theory first emerged in their magazine Cahier du cinema. It was in this magazine that they wrote the basis of the theory. As John Caughie explains “Traditionally, the reference to the auteur in French film criticism had identified either the author who wrote the script, or, in the more general sense of the term, the artist who created the film. In the work of Cahiers the latter sense came to replace the former, and the auteur was the artist whose personality was 'written' in the film” (Caughie, 1981). Also many of them believed in that the auteur should be the audio-visual voice who uses the cinema to show a personal statement and also depict their version of reality. Alexandre Astruc and the writers of Cahiers André Bazin and François Truffaut"
