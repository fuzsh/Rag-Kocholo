        "text": "“I believe that a screenplay is a distinct form with very specific rules. It’s meant to seduce the reader.”\n\nCaroline Thompson\n\nScreenwriter/director Caroline Thompson was born in Washington, D.C., grew up in Maryland, and is yet one more person educated in Massachusetts (Radciffe College, Harvard University and Amherst). Her credits include The Addams Family, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpus Bride, and her first produced script Edward Scissorhands.\n\n“I wrote Edward (Scissorshands) really fast, the first draft in three weeks...I never took a meeting at the studio. I never had studio notes. Nothing…One funny thing is that I’ve gone from being called weird—that’s how my work was described before Edward Scissorhands—to being called imaginative…I’m always interested in outsider/insider themes. Edward is a perfect example of an outsider because he’s different and they’re pleased as all get out that he’s different because it relieves their boredom. But then fundamentally he’s too different and so they reject him…The other thing that interests me is metaphors. I love Edward Scissorhands because having these scissors for hands is a perfect metaphor for not being able to have contact."
