It could be thematic, it could be visually, anything ...\n\nFor me, it is Tim Burton\n\nThe man has made the same type of film (it seems) over and over and over. In side the mans head is this bizarre world of worms and claymation characters and big top circus tents.\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory - Have not seen it, do not want to see it, looks like more crap\n\nBig Fish - A cute film but more of the same\n\nPlanet of the Apes - Crap\n\nSleepy Hollow - Finally a legitimate film from Burton minus the comic book\n\nfantasy land. I wish he would would do more serious Horror\n\nMars Attacks! - Crap and more comic book crap at that. I don't want to see a comic book come to life. Sin City is an exception based purely on technique (Green screen)\n\nEd Wood - His best film ever made. Filmed as if were in 1959, Beautifully done.\n\nBatman Returns - Crap\n\nEdward Scissorhands - Nice film, but more of the same with outrageous set designs, bizarre characters, and that damn Elfman music.\n\nBatman - Burton defines what was wrong with the Franchise from Day 1. After that, we have to sit through 3 more absurd comic book land films. Thank god Nolan comes around and makes it legitimate.\n\nBeetle Juice - Original, fun, dark. And unfortunately the beginning of the same thing over and over and over.\n\nPee-wee's Big Adventure - A cute, fun (Kid's film?) that shows us the beginning of Burton's childbrain\n\nCan the guy make a normal effin Movie without the gimmicky fantasy land he seems to be trapped in ?\n\nI'm tired of this guys Schtick.\n\nJohn_Hudson said:\n\nI'm not talking about the hype or popularity of a director.

Elfman's score for Batman is one of my favorites.\n\nBatman Returns - I don't like this one as much as the original, but it still kicks the hell out of \"Batman Begins\" in my opinion.\n\nEdward Scissorhands - Damn! You didn't like this film?!!! I adore it. I think it's one of Burton's best, if not THE best by him.\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory - I watched this on a jet coming back from aussie. I wasn't expecting much. I liked it. It wasn't as good as the original, but in other ways it had its own unique voice.\n\nSleepy Hollow - Greatness\n\nEd Wood - Great in some odd way.\n\nPlanet of the Apes - Crap\n\nBig Fish - I dig it, though not his best\n\nPee Wee - This is probably mostly from Paul Reuben and Phil Hartman's head than anything else. It's fun.\n\nBeetle Juice - not the best, but I still like the vibe\n\n===========================================\n\nI'm sick and tired of M. Night Shyamalama-ding-dong\n\nHis movies are well made but the layer of hype I get sick of hearing is how \"deep\" the guy is. His entire family consists of doctors...yeah he had it really rough. I just see him as some spoiled rich kid that's now even richer because people are buying his pseudo \"deep\" BS.\n\nI loved the Sixth Sense. I was very excited about M. Night showing up on the scene after that film. I was very stoked to go see \"Unbreakable\". I even argued why it didn't suck after the film was over with my friends. Then I realized after \"Signs\" I was getting hypnotized into the Shyamalama-ding-dong self indulgent world. I didn't see the Village for quite a while, when I did it pissed me off to no damned end. End, end, end, what's that unfamiliar word? It didn't have an ending.\n\nI refuse to see Lady in the Water. I gather from the reviews many people are tired of this director's shtick. I think he could do a great job it he would start doing other writers work. I'd would probably go see his version of Harry Potter with some level excitement. I think on a technical level he's a good director.\n\n==============================================\n\nI don't like anything associated with Jerry Bruckheimer. It makes me physically ill. I hate his corny, one liner films with some equally corny composer hired to do the score. I hate his CSI shows on TV and anything like them. I like to call him Jerry Bruckhymen because he is a pu&#@ - MEOW!!!\n\nA joke ? Universally junk ?

Box-office success doesn't mean much. Most films that do fantastic financially are usually not worth seeing. Kids and teenagers pump up the bulk of box-office.\n\nJohn_Hudson said:\n\nA joke ?

The only movies I didn't think were that good were King Arthur and Gone In 60 Seconds. King Arthur was OK. Coulda been better IMO. But 60 Seconds was bad IMHO. Enemy of the State, both Pirates, Armageddon, National Treasure, and the rest of the list were good films.\n\nOne director I'm tired of... Uwe Boll LMAO. oh and Eli Roth both just suck IMO"
