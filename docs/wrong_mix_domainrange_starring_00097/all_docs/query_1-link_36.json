He is the recipient of multiple accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, and has been nominated for three Academy Awards and two BAFTA awards. He is regarded as one of the world’s biggest film stars. He is the tenth highest-grossing actor worldwide, as films featuring him have grossed over US$3.7 billion at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide. He has been listed in the 2012 Guinness World Records as the world’s highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million. He was inducted as a Disney Legend in 2015. In addition to acting, Depp has also worked as a musician. He has performed in numerous musical groups, including forming the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires along with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry.\n\nDepp made his film debut in Wes Craven‘s 1984 supernatural horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street, before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street (1987–1990).

Pistone in Donnie Brasco (1997), with Al Pacino; author J.M. Barrie in Finding Neverland (2004), with Kate Winslett; and Boston gangster Whitey Bulger in Black Mass (2015).\n\nOther notable films include John Waters‘s Cry-Baby (1990), Don Juan DeMarco (1995), with Marlon Brando and Faye Dunaway, Jim Jarmusch‘s Dead Man (1995) with Gary Farmer and an ensemble including John Hurt; Terry Gilliam‘s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), with Benicio Del Toro; Sleepy Hollow (1999), with Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Christopher Lee, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken; Robert Rodriguez‘s Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), with Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Mickey Rourke, and Willem Dafoe; Secret Window (2004), with John Turturro; Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Corpse Bride (2005), Michael Mann‘s Public Enemies (2009), with Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Stephen Dorff, and Stephen Lang; Alice in Wonderland (2010) and its 2016 sequel, The Tourist (2010), Rango (2011), with Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Harry Dean Stanton, Ray Winstone, Timothy Olyphant, Stephen Root, and Ned Beatty; Dark Shadows (2012), Into the Woods (2014), and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018), with Eddie Redmayne.\n\nDepp also plays pirate Captain Jack Sparrow in the swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003–present), who’s co-stars have included Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly, Kevin McNally, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce, Stelan Skarsgård, Naomi Harris, Chow Yun-Fat, Penélope Cruz, Ian McShane, and Javier Bardem.\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.\n\n(*seen originally in theaters)\n\n(**seen rereleased in theaters)"
