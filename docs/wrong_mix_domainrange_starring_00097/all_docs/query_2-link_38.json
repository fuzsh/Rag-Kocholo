        "text": "As you know, Johnny Depp's Mortdecai opened with just $4.13 million this weekend, which means the $60m Lions Gate Entertainment /Odd Lot Films production is in a bit of trouble. This is Johnny Depp's fifth straight underperforming film as a leading man since Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which did not remotely disappoint all the way to a $1.045 billion worldwide gross back in May of 2011.\n\nSince then we've seen The Rum Diary ($5.1m debut/$23.9m worldwide cume on a $45m budget), Dark Shadows ($29.6m/$245.5m/$150m), The Lone Ranger ($29.2m/$260.5m/$215m), Transcendence ($10.8m/$103m/$100m) and now Mortdecai. That running tab counts neither his unrecognizable cameo in Kevin Smith's Tusk ($1.8m) nor his glorified cameo in Walt Disney's quite successful Into the Woods ($155m worldwide and counting off a $60m budget). The notion that Johnny Depp is in a box office slump implies that Johnny Depp was once an \"open the movie by yourself\" box office draw in the first place. Truth be told, in terms of opening a movie by himself mostly due to his presence, Johnny Depp is not and never was that kind of movie star.\n\nJohnny Depp's career as an actor can be divided in three parts. You have what amounts to a prologue, from 1984 to 1990, where he got his start in A Nightmare On Elm Street and Platoon, and found teen idol stardom on television in Fox's 21 Jump Street. In 1990 he took his first out-and-out leading film roles in John Waters's Cry Baby and Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. Mr. Waters is not exactly \"Mr. Box Office\" so it is not a surprise that the teen idol deconstruction earned just $8 million. But Edward Scissorhands was a critically-acclaimed smash hit, operating as what is likely the defining \"one for you, one for me\" pattern that was popular for awhile in Hollywood as Tim Burton cashed in all of his Batman chips on the quirky fairy tale. The film earned $86m worldwide on a $20m budget. After Edward Scissorhands, Mr. Depp was free from the confines of teen idol TV and was more-or-less a leading man.\n\nStarting in 1993 with Benny and Joon (a much-liked character comedy that was more talked about than seen and earned $23 million), Depp would spend the next ten years basically doing the exact opposite of \"movie star\" movies. Depp spent 1993 to 2003 mostly starring in odd, quirky, and just-plain weird movies that were all-but-explicitly intended to repel traditional box office success and conventional movie stardom. What's Eating Gilbert Grape ($10m), Tim Burton's career-peak Ed Wood ($5.8m), Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas ($10m), and Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man ($1m), were appreciated, but they were not box office hits. Borderline attempts at more conventional plays like Nick of Time ($8m) and The Astronaut's Wife ($19m) fizzled. Now Don Juan de Marco ($68m) and Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate ($58m, but on a $38m budget) did okay overseas. But outside of the superb Al Pacino/Johnny Depp mob drama Donnie Brasco ($124m worldwide in 1997) and Tim Burton's terrific comeback vehicle Sleepy Hollow ($206m worldwide in 1999), for which Burton had to fight Paramount in order to cast Depp over someone more bankable like Brad Pitt, Depp spent pretty much the entire 1990's being tagged as \"box office poison\" for starring in precisely the kinds of films that mainstream audiences wouldn't want to see. It was almost a badge of honor and made him a favorite among film critics and film nerds.\n\nThe 2000's offered a solid hit the form of Chocolat (a towering $152 million worldwide gross, although that was as much due to the Weinstein Oscar machine as it was for Depp's supporting role) and near-misses in the form of Ted Demme's Blow ($83m on a $53m budget) and the Hughes Brothers' adaptation of Alan Moore's Jack the Ripper graphic novel From Hell ($74m on a $35m budget, which means it probably did make money in the end). Enter Jack Sparrow in July 2003. In what was basically a colorful supporting role in Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl (he was Han Solo to Orlando Bloom's Luke Skywalker), Depp basically did his \"quirky\" thing in a scene-stealing turn in a big-budget Walt Disney movie based on a theme park attraction. The picture earned rave reviews and opened with $73 million over its first five days, eventually earning $305m domestic and $654m worldwide, by far Depp's biggest hit ever. Depp certainly deserved some credit for the opening and especially for the legs, but he was part of a big package (which included a fresh-off The Two Towers Orlando Bloom) and one component of what was a surprisingly good popcorn movie in a summer where much of the output had let us down.\n\nTwelve years later, after a brief post-Pirates run at financial and artistic respectability, what we see are a stream of Pirates sequels, Tim Burton-directed fantasies and nearly everything else which qualifies as a disappointment or flop. He was part of an ensemble cast that powered Robert Rodriguez's Once Upon A Time In Mexico to a $22 million debut in October 2003 and he arguably deserves sole credit for the Stephen King adaptation The Secret Window's $18m debut weekend in March of 2004. Finding Neverland was a slow Miramax Oscar play which earned $116m worldwide without a single weekend over $4m. After that, he gave us two Tim Burton films which were relative smash hits in 2005 and a barn-burning Pirates of the Caribbean sequel in 2006. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a hardcore commercial play for Burton and Depp, and it was a perfect mix of star+director+concept that earned a $53m debut weekend and $474m worldwide gross off a $150m budget. The Corpse Bride was another Depp/Burton combo, this time in stop-motion animation, which merited a $19m debut weekend and $117m worldwide gross. And of course Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest pulled off a record-shattering $135m opening weekend, $421m domestic total, and $1 billion worldwide back when that wasn't a yearly expectation.\n\nWhile Johnny Depp deserves the lion's share of the credit for every Pirates of the Caribbean sequel, it is still a matter of audiences wanting to see Depp as Sparrow as opposed to wanting to see Depp in any old movie. In between Pirates sequels, he made three more Tim Burton films, Sweeney Todd ($152m worldwide), Alice in Wonderland ($1 billion worldwide), and Dark Shadows ($245m worldwide, on a $150m budget). He made one of his few explicitly commercial live-action hits in 2009 with the Michael Mann gangster drama Public Enemies, which teamed Depp with post-Dark Knight Christian Bale and earned $214m worldwide. He teamed up with Angelina Jolie for The Tourist in 2010, which stiffed in America ($17m debut, $67m domestic total) but earned a rousing $210m overseas. He re-teamed with Gore Verbinksi for the terrific Rango, but the animated film's $38m debut weekend came during a period in early 2011 when a bunch of animated features (Rio, Hop, etc.) were knocking it out of the park and the film's $245m global take was considered (unfairly?) a disappointment compared to its $135m budget. 2011 offered us Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides which powered itself to $1b worldwide thanks to Depp's signature character and the still-novel 3D for overseas audiences (it earned $241m here, $804m over there).\n\nBut it's been a post-Pirates run of relative disappointments (Dark Shadows, The Lone Ranger) and outright bombs (The Rum Diaries, Transcendence, Mortdecai). As odd as it is to argue that an actor who has three $1 billion hits and four $900m+ global hits isn't a \"movie star,\" but I would argue the situation is more complicated. Johnny Depp is an actor who when placed in the right situation (a Pirates film or a Tim Burton fantasy) can (usually) deliver big grosses. Even putting Johnny Depp in Gore Verbinski's The Lone Ranger or Tim Burton's Dark Shadows didn't quite pan out, although I would argue both films were over-budgeted. And put Johnny Depp in anything outside of those specific circumstances, and it's a risky bet if not an outright unwise bet. Films that wholly depended on Johnny Depp to sell them (The Rum Diary, Mortdecai, almost anything prior to Sleepy Hollow) were outright flops more often than not. Films that counted on Johnny Depp and another would-be movie star (think Christian Bale or Angelina Jolie) were risky bets that usually ended up disappointing in relation to budget. Johnny Depp was box office poison before Sleepy Hollow and Pirates of the Caribbean, and I would argue that his pull hasn't improved that much beyond a very specific window of \"star+concept\" or more specifically \"star+director+concept.\"\n\nNow for the record, that I am proclaiming that Johnny Depp is not a movie star in the \"box office\" sense does not mean that I am declaring him to be a bad actor or a bad person. I would imagine that few well-known film actors would care less about whether they fit into the narrow and uber-rare category of \"face on the poster\" movie stars than Mr. Depp. I have been a fan of his going back to his 21 Jump Street days, and I have seen the likes of Ed Wood, Don Juan DeMarco, Nick of Time, and The Ninth Gate, on their opening weekends in very empty theaters. He is, in the right project (say Into the Woods, which is sitting at $155m worldwide on a $60m budget), a potent added value element. He is, in the right combination (say a starring role in a Tim Burton fantasy), a genuine draw in a classic example of star+concept. But audiences have never raced out to see the new Johnny Depp movie purely because Johnny Depp was in it in the way they did for Will Smith or Tom Cruise in their prime. Johnny Depp wasn't a box office draw before Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl and I would argue we still isn't much of one outside the very narrow window of what constitutes bankability for the longtime performer.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. outside of Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes is not a bankable movie star. Brendan Fraser was only a movie star in the Mummy movies. And Chris Hemsworth isn't worth much outside of playing Thor. And so it is the same with Johnny Depp, worth his weight in gold when playing Jack Sparrow and teaming with Tim Burton but otherwise at-best an added value element. Johnny Depp doesn't need career rehab or intervention. He has always marched to the beat of his own drummer, and I imagine films like Mortdecai are very much what he'd like to do with his time in between Pirates sequels and periodic \"serious\" pictures like the upcoming ensemble Whitey Bulger biopic. There was a time when Johnny Depp was considered box office poison and I truly wanted Burton to cast Brad Pitt in Sleepy Hollow because Burton (post Ed Wood and Mars Attacks!) badly needed a safe hit. Even over a decade after Curse of the Black Pearl, I would still argue he has little drawing power on his own, little ability to get audiences to see a film that they otherwise wouldn't be interested in. That's not a knock against him, because I don't think Mr. Depp ever wanted to be the next Tom Cruise. He is perfectly happy being Johnny Depp, take him or leave him."
