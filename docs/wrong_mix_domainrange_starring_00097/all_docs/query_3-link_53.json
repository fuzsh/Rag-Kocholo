It's been years coming and now it is really happening.\n\nListen to Shannon Holly mornings on 94.3 The Point and download our free 94.3 The Point app.\n\nWe've been waiting Kevin!!! Many versions of the script were considered but now it's gonna be lights, camera action! He took to IG to to post about it:\n\n“Passion is key to any creative endeavor, but patience and persistence are just as essential,”\n\n1994 was a good year for convenience stores and now that we are in reboot mode like never before Kev knew it was time to pick up the pen during the pandemic. It wouldn't be Clerks if it was filmed anywhere else so Kevin is keepin' it real by doing it in his home state. We see you...originally from Red Bank, growing up in Highlands. I love that he always shouts us out."
