I'd love to see what the master of Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown does with that much cash in the bank. After all, why should Mann adapt a TV show at such a ridiculous budget, only for people to find it wonderfully empty? Give the guy a break, all child-rape aside...\n\n#202 Post by Antoine Doinel » Sun Feb 04, 2007 1:45 am\n\nI don't care about Polanski's child rape conviction or whatever. It just boggles my mind that even in the face of such financial and critical disasters of Alexander, Miami Vice and The New World that there are still people with money to burn.\n\nI have nothing against the idea itself, but given that this will easily have to top $150-200 to break even, which will undoubtedly NOT happen (if Superman Returns couldn't recoup, I don't see what chance this has) it will ultimately affect funding for future Polanski projects.\n\nTwo things are going to happen here. Either Polanski will stick to his vision and deliver the film he wants to, but that will die in multiplexes. Or, his investors wanting a guarantee on return will saddle him with an A-list Hollywood cast, driving expenses up further and demand more explosions.\n\nIn either scenario, I don't see this ending well.\n\n#203 Post by Matt » Sun Feb 04, 2007 12:01 pm\n\nAntoine Doinel wrote:I don't care about Polanski's child rape conviction or whatever.

At 69 on Metacritic, and at 59% on Rotten Tomatoes, it's not exactly the stinker you imply either.\n\nAnd what is it that you have against Colin Farrell movies anyway?\n\nBut yeah, I can't really imagine why anyone would put Polanski at the helm of a huge historical epic either.\n\n#204 Post by Antoine Doinel » Sun Feb 04, 2007 12:14 pm\n\nI guess the point I was trying to drive at with The New World (which didn't even come close to breaking even incidentally) is that period pieces in general have a hard time at the box office.\n\nBut I think we can all agree that having Polanski at the helm of Pompeii is a puzzling choice at best.\n\n#205 Post by DrewReiber » Sun Feb 04, 2007 8:24 pm\n\nMatt wrote:But yeah, I can't really imagine why anyone would put Polanski at the helm of a huge historical epic either.\n\nI guess everyone forgot about Pirates.\n\n#206 Post by Antoine Doinel » Sun Feb 04, 2007 11:23 pm\n\nDrewReiber wrote:\n\nMatt wrote:But yeah, I can't really imagine why anyone would put Polanski at the helm of a huge historical epic either.\n\nI guess everyone forgot about Pirates.\n\nIt's the exception that proves the rule.\n\nAlso, it's not as if POTC is being billed as some kind of historically-accurate-political-thriller about an aqueduct (yawn). It's a theme park ride promotion stretched into a franchise. I'm sure there are plenty of Disney marketing executives sending their kids to college on bonuses alone.\n\nIf they cast Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley maybe I'll reign in my cynicism. Maybe.\n\n#207 Post by exte » Mon Feb 05, 2007 1:31 am\n\nYou didn't click the link in his post did you?\n\n#208 Post by Antoine Doinel » Mon Feb 05, 2007 10:31 am\n\nNo --- but I kinda wish I hadn't.

Roman Polanski's PIRATES\n\nThe film was one of the biggest financial and critical flops of its kind and one of the pirate movies responsible for making the subgenre equivalent to box office rat poison (and Cutthroat Island 9 years later) until just recently. It cost $40 million and only made around $1 in the US. If memory serves, it was one of the most infamous flops of the 1980's.\n\nSee what I mean? Everyone forgot.\n\n#210 Post by jorencain » Mon Feb 05, 2007 1:14 pm\n\nI haven't seen any mention on here of Gregg Araki's new film, \"Smiley Face\".

His music video credits include Johnny Cash's \"Hurt,\"Audioslave's \"Cochise\" and Fiona Apple's \"Criminal.\"\n\nReuters/Hollywood Reporter\n\n#216 Post by Antoine Doinel » Thu Feb 08, 2007 3:36 pm\n\nReading that, I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry.\n\n#217 Post by DrewReiber » Fri Feb 09, 2007 1:27 am\n\nUniversal isn't in the business of making movies unless it's a big CGI monster making lots of noise. At least we were spared Halo.\n\n#218 Post by Antoine Doinel » Fri Feb 09, 2007 2:23 am\n\nI'm just puzzled as to why Mark Romanek is involved at all, unless after he's done with Wolfman, Universal will green light whatever personal project he has next on his slate.\n\nDoes this mean A Cold Case with Tom Hanks is no more?\n\n#219 Post by Andre Jurieu » Tue Feb 13, 2007 12:05 pm\n\njorencain wrote:I haven't seen any mention on here of Gregg Araki's new film, \"Smiley Face\".

I'm wondering if he constantly high-five's himself on being cast in a Gregg Araki movie.\n\n#220 Post by flyonthewall2983 » Tue Feb 13, 2007 1:07 pm\n\nGrace is Gone looks like it could be a winner."
