        "text": "The entertainment industry is still being shaken up months after both the Writer’s Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild began their strike. With now more shows and live programs beings postponed.\n\nThe most recent being the popular gameshow Jeopardy!, which was supposed to start its Tournament of Champions is now postponed after contestants refused to cross picket lines. Another large example is the Emmy’s one of the largest award ceremonies in the world is now postponed as well.\n\nWell, this story from NJ.com may be more fuel to the fire as popular streaming service Netflix is looking to hire an AI with a potential salary of 300k to 900k! The AI will take the role of a product manager based out of their headquarters in Los Gatos California or somewhere along the west coast.\n\nThis is one of the main concerns of the strike as AI technology continues to advance more and more companies are implementing this new technology in order to cut costs on having actual people.\n\nThis is a prime example of why this issue is center stage for the WGA as Netflix already uses AI technology for a number of functions like maintaining their user experience. This includes selecting the thumbnail art or curating users’ recommendations based on their specific tastes.\n\nThe company also uses AI to determine which programs are successful or not. As of right now, it’s unknown if this product manager will be directly involved or impacted in the creation or any content creation.\n\nI’m very interested to see what Netflix’s plan is as they haven’t commented on the specifics of the AI’s role. Though more importantly how do you pay an AI program? Do they have direct deposit or are they a check type of employee? All jokes aside the SAG and WGA strike has been going on since early May."
