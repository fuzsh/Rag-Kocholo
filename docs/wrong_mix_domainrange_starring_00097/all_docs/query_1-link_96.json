        "text": "Screenplay Genre: Fantasy / Romance\n\nMovie Time: 105 minutes\n\n1. INCITING INCIDENT\n\nWhen local Avon seller Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) fails to make any profits in her neighborhood, she visits a medieval mansion located on a hill above town and discovers Edward (Johnny Depp), who is an artificial man with scissors-like blades for hands. Touched by Edward's loneliness, Peg declares, \"I think you should come home with me.\" (00:12:43)\n\n2. LOCK IN (End of Act One)\n\nEven though Edward is accepted by Peg's husband, Bill (Alan Arkin), and her son, Kevin, it's not until a backyard barbeque where the rest of the neighborhood finally meets the mysterious Edward. Everyone seems to welcome him opening, especially the neighborhood housewives, who begin maneuvering to get Edward to come over to their houses to trim the bushes. Edward as an entrepreneur begins. (00:35:26)\n\n3. FIRST CULMINATION (Midpoint)\n\nJim (Anthony Michael Hall), along with Kim (Winona Ryder), convinces Edward to break into Jim's house, but the alarm goes off, trapping Edward inside. Neither Jim nor Kim comes clean about the truth, and Edward is arrested, but later released when a psychological examination reveals that his isolation had allowed him to live without a traditional sense of ethics. (1:04:35)\n\n4. MAIN CULMINATION (End of Act Two)\n\nSeeing Jim's van speeding toward Kevin, Edward tackles Kevin to safety; however, Edward accidentally cuts Kevin with is scissor blades and Jim begins to beat up Edward as a mob of angry people gather. Kim tells Edward to run as the police and a mob literally hunt Edward back to his creator's mansion (1:28:28).\n\n5. THIRD ACT TWIST\n\nAfter Kim reunites with Edward at his mansion, Jim arrives and attempts to kill his rival. Though Edward is beaten initially, Kim comes to his aid, threatening Jim to \"Stop it, or I'll kill you myself.\" But when Jim reacts by violently slapping Kim across the face, Edward stabs Jim in the heart with his scissor fingers, pushing him out the mansion window. Jim falls to his death. (1:33:36)"
