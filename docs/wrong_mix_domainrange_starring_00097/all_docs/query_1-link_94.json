        "text": "Well, 2014 has been pretty sensational in terms of cinema. The year has been littered with an array of modern classics, featuring many memorable performances, and seeing acclaimed directors such as Wes Anderson, David Fincher, Clint Eastwood, Kevin Smith and Luc Besson releasing works, that will, in later years, be considered integral to their back catalogues.\n\nGranted, I have not managed to see every release since January, and critically hailed movies such as Interstellar, Inherent Vice, Paddington and The Imitation Game have yet to be digested, so I’m unable to comment. I was also intrigued with Darren Aronofsky’s Noah due to his indisputably solid track record and the reviews of the bizarre / fantastical content. Alas, I have not yet obtained a copy.\n\nHaving been suitably impressed with many films this year such as Transcendence, Godzilla, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies and Need for Speed, they never really threatened to penetrate the top 10. I’ve been genuinely blown away by the years Sci-Fi releases, and in terms of comedy, The Inbetweeners 2 and A Million Ways to Die in the West have tickled me in all the right (comedic) places.\n\nIt’s been incredibly hard to finalise the top 10, with films drifting in and out, jumping spaces and getting substituted. There were plenty of, what I consider, really great films that got left hanging. Namely, Luc Besson’s Lucy was phenomenally entertaining, in an off-the-wall, bonkers, no holds barred way. As a huge Spike Jonze fan, I found Her to be an enchanting story of relationships and technology. Edge of Tomorrow was one of Tom Cruise’s finest films to date. X-Men: Days of Future Past was a top end entry into an already magnificent film series. Sin City: A Dame To Kill For was perfectly complimentary to it’s sister film from 2004 and The Lego Movie was one of the funniest family films of the millennium.\n\nAny other year, these would have featured without question in a top 10 round up, but unfortunately it’s a pretty impenetrable, water tight list.\n\nBefore we crack on with the formalities. I would like to give an honorable mention to the American horror comedy from April, that was far more enjoyable than it should have been:\n\nZombeavers\n\nFear not. There will be no spoilers. Let’s begin with…\n\n10. Guardians of the Galaxy\n\nDirector: James Gunn\n\nStarring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Salanda, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel\n\nSimilarly to Iron Man in 2008 and Thor in 2011, a relatively lesser know Marvel collective were introduced to the big screen with pretty spectacular results. Outselling the lackluster Amazing Spiderman 2, Guardians was the most critically acclaimed and highest grossing Marvel film of the year. With the perfect blend, of science-fiction, fantasy, action and comedy. This comic book romp holds it’s own in an already crowded superhero genre. Although, not my favourite Marvel, or superhero film, of 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the finest Marvel adaptations to date.\n\n9. Nightcrawler\n\nDirector: Dan Gilroy\n\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, Bill Paxton\n\nA fantastic character piece showcasing Jake Gyllenhaal’s finest performance to date. Nighcrawler is a dark drama centered around the unsettling world of American news media. Reminiscent of films such as Drive and American Pyscho, Gyllenhaal’s superb performance carries the film, as the unstable and unpredictable Lou Bloom as he works his way up within the industry.\n\n8. Captain Ameirca: The Winter Soldier\n\nDirector: Anthony & Joe Russo\n\nStarring: Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Redford\n\nQuite simply, the finest Marvel film to date. Chris Evan’s reprises his role as the old fashioned hero, adapting to life in the modern world. The movie plays out, mostly, as a conspiracy drama with innumerable plot twists throughout. Interspersed with some of the most realistic and well executed action set pieces of the genre, The Winter Soldier is the most intelligent and thought provoking of all it’s Marvel predecessors, and has evolved a classic comic book character, into a modern cinematic icon.\n\n7. Muppets Most Wanted\n\nDirector: James Bobin\n\nStarring: Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell, Tina Fey\n\nAfter reestablishing the Muppets in 2011 to wide success and acclaim, a sequel was only natural. Receiving some less than favourable reviews and under performing at the box office, in comparison to it’s predecessor, I found Muppets Most Wanted to be the superior film. Whereas The Muppets was charming and humorous with a great soundtrack. I didn’t find it as “laugh out loud” funny as the sequel. Brett McKenzie’s musical numbers are as witty as they are catchy, and the film features fantastic (supporting) roles from Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell and Tina Fey that had me laughing like a drain from start to finish.\n\n6. The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nStarring: Ralph Fiennes, F.Murray Abraham, Tony Revolori, Jeff Goldblum\n\nThe next thousand words of this post could be taken up listing the insanely impressive ensemble cast that feature in Wes Anderson’s latest. The cast list for this comical farce, reads like a who’s who of American popular cinema. With so many supporting players and with such a high energy and fast pace, the film definitely had the potential to overwhelm itself and go off the rails. However, Anderson controls proceedings beautifully, centering the entire piece around Ralph Feinnes, who gives a comedy masterclass performance. Along with Anderson’s expert directing, each joke is timed and filmed to perfection. Hilarity ensues throughout and The Grand Budapest Hotel could definitely be considered as Anderson’s finest work.\n\n5. Under The Skin\n\nDirector: Jonathan Glazer\n\nStarring: Scarlett Johansson\n\nWithout a doubt, the strangest film I’ve seen this year. Set in Glasgow, Scarlett Johansson plays an inscrutable “woman” driving through the city in a van, picking up men from the streets. Once seducing them and taking them back to her apartment, all manor of strange and horrific events unfold. A combination of candid camera filming and surreal special effect visuals, the film is mysterious, eerie and bizarre throughout, culminating in a breathtaking final act.\n\n4. Frank\n\nDirector: Lenny Abrahamson\n\nStarring: Michael Fassbender, Domhall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal\n\nIf you asked me half way though the year, this film would have been number one with a bullet. Michael Fassbender gives a fantastic central performance, as the title character, in an unbelievable role. Hidden behind the infamous Frank head, he manages to convey heart, compassion, empathy and humour, without the use of his face. Using the iconic Frank Sidebottom image, the classic character is superimposed into a film about a fictitious avant-garde art band. Musically similar to acts such as Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band, the film follows Frank’s band from the recording of their debut album, to a music festival in Texas, after accumulating cult status online.\n\n3. Gone Girl\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nStarring: Rosamund Pike, Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry\n\nA darkly comic thriller featuring a stellar cast. The film is a razor sharp, edge of your seat tale, with twists, turns, laughs, gore and genuinely shocking moments. It’s incredibly hard to discuss Gone Girl without giving anything away, as for me, knowing nothing of the plot, heightened my enjoyment of the film significantly. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike’s onscreen chemistry, as a married couple with a “complicated” relationship is completely engaging. With a surprisingly sinister supporting role from Neil Patrick Harris, the film is a modern classic and is one of, director, David Fincher’s finest works.\n\n2. Tusk\n\nDirector: Kevin Smith\n\nStarring: Justin Long, Michael Parks, Hayley Joel Osment, Genesis Rodriguez\n\nBased on a discussion from Smith’s Podcast, Tusk is a low budget Canadian body horror comedy. Having read a surreal advert on the website GumTree.com the initial idea for the film was conceived. The post advertised a vacant room in a house in Bristol England, and offered, potential tenants the chance to live there, rent free, on the understanding that they would, for a few hours a day, dress and act as a walrus, to satisfy the landlord’s fascination with the sea creature. Smith and collaborator Scott Mosier discussed this advertisement in depth and it became the main inspiration behind this unusual, yet brilliant movie.\n\n1. Jersey Boys\n\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\n\nStarring: John Lloyd Young, Vincent Piazza, Christopher Walken\n\nMy favourite film of the year. Not the most critically acclaimed, not the most warmly received by fans, not the highest grossing and not the most widely seen film of 2014. Nevertheless, Jersey Boys was a sheer delight from start to finish. Director Clint Eastwood, of whom I am a huge fan, loosely adapts the stage musical, of the same name, onto the big screen. Differing from regular musicals, all the songs (mostly) are within context of the drama and diegetic on screen. Chronicling the rise to stardom of Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons, Eastwood captures the look and feel of the 1950’s / 60’s superbly. The relatively unknown leads in the film, do an incredible job of tackling some of the most famous and vocally challenging songs in popular music history. The whole film plays out brilliantly with dashes of comedy and knowing “nods and winks” to the audience throughout.\n\nAll in all. A pretty marvelous year for film. Not too many duds to speak of. Although, I was significantly underwhelmed by The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I found this to be a real shame, as I’d enjoyed Andrew Garfield’s first outing as ‘Spidey’ enormously. I felt The Amazing Spider-Man was the best installment of the series so far, so I had (misplaced) high hopes for the sequel.\n\nDespite Spidey 2’s many flaws, without doubt, or fear of contradiction, the worst film, I had the misfortune of sitting though this year was, the Michael Bay produced, CGI toshfest that was: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nHaving taken something I, as a child, held quite dearly in my heart, and perverting it into some humourless Megan Fox glamour shoot, is unforgivable. I advise everyone with a soul, to avoid this garbage at all costs and seek out the original trilogy. Back to the good old days of, simply, blokes in rubber suits, bashing each other around.\n\nMy favourite actress of the year has be Scarlett Johansson, for a ridiculous amount of fantastic performances, Her, Captain America, Lucy and Under the Skin.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal, gave my favourite lead acting performance of the year as Lou Bloom in Nightcrawler.\n\nFinally, my favourite director of the year is, Wes Anderson. The Grand Budapest Hotel, was simply, the best example of Wes Anderson being as “Wes Anderson” as he possibly could be.\n\nI’ve been a big fan of Tim Burton’s work for as long as I can remember. Having yet to see one of his latest films Dark Shadows, I’ve followed the reviews and promotional material with intrigue. Under performing at the box office and receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film didn’t quite set the world alight, despite it’s infamous director, all star cast and appealing trailers.\n\nHaving generated over a billion dollars worldwide with Alice in Wonderland, only two years earlier, it’s strange how a director, I would consider a modern auteur, can vary his output yet retain a distinctive cinematic presence in everything he does. Naturally, some projects are more personal and reflective of his visionary flare than others, but all of Burton’s back catalog contain elements of his stylistic approach to directing.\n\nThroughout his career he has had hits and misses, flops and blockbusters, big budgets, small budgets, critical praise and less than enthusiastic reviews. Dark Shadows, appears to have gone through the same journey as my favourite Tim Burton films. The troubling box office figures, the confused critics, the inexplicable reason to under perform, despite (on paper) having all the right components.\n\nSo before entering the comically dark world that lies within the frames of Dark Shadows, in anticipation, I have knocked up my alternative top 5 Tim Burton films.\n\nI’ve tried to avoid Burton’s biggest Hollywood blockbusters, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, his Batman installments and the underwhelming reboot of Planet of the Apes, collectively generating near to 2.5 billion dollars at the box office.\n\nI’ve also tried to avoid films, which you’d probably be familiar with due to their cult status such as Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and the Burton conceived and produced Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nI’ve gone for the films that are just slightly hidden outside the mainstream. The films that are a little bit stranger, darker and not as familiar to an average cinema going audience. Hopefully there’s a couple you’ve not seen and will potentially seek out, but for now, here’s my…. alternative top 5 Tim Burton films.\n\n5. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)\n\nNot generally the first film that springs to mind when asked to name a Johnny Depp / Tim Burton collaboration, Sweeney Todd was an incredibly bold film for Tim Burton. As well as being his only film to be rated 18 in the U.K, the film was almost entirely sung and stayed faithful to the musical source material throughout.\n\nSo not only has Tim Burton significantly reduced his audience by making an adult only production, he’s not been compromised in the structure of the films musical roots. Containing fantastic performances throughout, and some of the greatest on screen gore Burton has ever directed, Sweeney Todd struggled to engage it’s audience in the way his previous teamups with Johnny Depp had. It would be a few years before an audience would fully get behind a film in which the vast majority of the script is sung. I’m referring of course to 2012’s Les Misérables.\n\n4. Big Fish (2003)\n\nAfter the anticipation of Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, I felt somewhat deflated after seeing it. Assuming this would be the perfect vehicle for Burton’s unique creative style, encompassing fantasy, darkness, off beat comedy and weird and wonderful creatures the end result was a tad vanilla. Obviously compromised by the production company, the film seemed rather uneventful and bland compared to what it could have been. Even the 3D seemed forced.\n\nWhat had sparked this anticipation (amongst other works) was Big Fish. A beautifully crafted love story, told in flashback, sees our hero Ed Bloom navigating his way around fantastical landscapes whilst interacting with a myriad of magical characters. Again, not quite dominating the box office in the way his next film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and his previous film Planet of the Apes had, Big Fish is a fabulously joyful and vibrant installment to his filmography.\n\n3. Mars Attacks! (1996)\n\nTerrifying me as a 9 year old, I revisited this homage to classic B-Movie sci-fi in my adult years, and fell in love with the creatures that once tortured my fragile, child’s mind. Completely off the wall and featuring some of the strangest cameos in the history of cinema, this film is littered with a-list talent, delivering ridiculous lines sincerely and sharing the screen with comically sinister Martian invaders.\n\nDespite the insanely brilliant cast list, the film was considered a box office bomb barely breaking even with it’s 100 million dollar budget. It’s dark and bonkers in all the right places, and Burton’s fondness of classic science fiction is accompanied beautifully by (consistent member of the Tim Burton stable) Danny Elfman’s original score.\n\n2. Frankenweenie (2012)\n\nNo stranger to the beautifully cinematic art of stop motion animation, Tim Burton has championed the genre and been involved with numerous projects as both a director and a producer. Notably, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride and James and the Giant Peach. Based on a short Burton had produced and directed in 1984, the full length adaptation of Frankenweenie is a wonderfully inventive take on the Frankenstein tale.\n\nAgain, going against all convention and producing a “children’s” film in purely black and white was a lovely touch, and completely in-keeping with the tone and the many “nods and winks” towards classic horror cinema.\n\nNot having the same cult status as The Nightmare Before Christmas or the familiarity with the source material as James and the Giant Peach and not performing particularly well at the box office in comparison to Corpse Bride, Frankenweenie is my favourite of Tim Burton’s animated features, and, as a dog owner, I found it profoundly moving .\n\n1. Ed Wood (1994)\n\nAfter directing the two biggest superhero films of all time, completely reinventing a teen icon in a critically acclaimed art-house film and producing what is now considered as a Christmas classic, Tim Burton had taken the cinematic world by storm.\n\nHe no doubt had his choice of scripts, stars and producers to work with, and brilliantly decided to do a black and white biopic of an obscure film director from the 1950’s. The newly established Johnny Depp portrays Edward D. Wood Jnr, who is generally considered to be the worst film director of all time, directing one of the ‘worst’ films of all time, Plan 9 From Outer Space.\n\nThe film explores Wood’s relationship with aging actor Bella Lugosi (brilliantly portrayed by Martin Landau in an Oscar winning performance), his passion for film-making and his sexuality as a hetrosexual transvestite. With a superb supporting cast featuring, Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette the film is moving, hilarious and beautifully shot. The whole legend surrounding Ed Wood is fascinating, and this is by far Tim Burton’s finest work and Johnny Depp’s greatest performance.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed my list, and hopefully there’s a couple of films you’ll seek out and enjoy. All that remains is to settle in and absorb everything Dark Shadows has to offer, and who knows….. I may have to rehash the list.\n\nI was first introduced to Ellen Page through her portrayal of Treena Lahey in the cult Canadian mockumentary Trailer Park Boys.\n\nAged only 14 at the time, she spent the decade of the noughties building up an incredibly impressive portfolio of work in television and film. Going from a bit part on a low budget Canadian TV show, she was worked her way up to starring in Hollywood blockbusters grossing hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAs well as her action / adventure blockbuster appearances, she has very much been a key ambassador of contemporary indie cinema gaining critical praise for almost all of her roles and even a 2007 Academy Award nomination.\n\nShe’s been my favourite actress for a long while now. As well as sharing an affinity for all things Canadian, human rights views on LGBT matters and a year of birth we also both have exceptional taste in film. Granted she takes the time to make them, whereas I simply have to watch them and write an unpopular blog.\n\nEveryone will presumably be familiar with Page’s performances in the X-Men series, but I’ve selected a top five that is based a bit more around her low key work. There may even be a couple of films that have slipped under your radar.\n\nAnyway, without further ado, here’s my top 5 Ellen Page films:\n\n5. Whip It\n\nYear: 2009\n\nRole: Bliss Cavendar / Babe Ruthless\n\nDrew Barrymore’s directorial debut was in the form of a comedy – drama centering around Ellen Page’s character Bliss and a roller derby team with which she becomes involved.\n\nDespite it’s slight predictability the film was an excellent coming-of-age story, exploring the more niche and quirky pastime of roller derby.\n\nFeaturing excellent performances all around and a great soundtrack, Page carries the whole film magnificently, doing what she does best, playing the young outsider role in a very reserved and believable way.\n\n4. Juno\n\nYear: 2007\n\nRole: Juno Macguff\n\nThe role that gained Ellen Page an enormous amount of notoriety in Hollywood, the title character from 2007’s Juno.\n\nThis low budget indie comedy – drama was a huge hit, winning an Oscar for, first time screenwriter Diablo Codey. The movie also scored a nomination for best picture and nominations for director Jason Reitman and star Ellen Page.\n\nThe story follows Juno, a teenager attempting to deal with an unplanned pregnancy. With an excellent supporting cast featuring, Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and J.K Simmons, Ellen Page’s screen presence is completely engaging throughout. She manages to portray the role of a know-it-all teenager, who struggles to retain composure excellently. Wanting to appear emotionally impenetrable whilst dealing with a series of life changing events, the scenes in which her guard is momentarily let down are genuinely touching.\n\n3. Super\n\nYear: 2010\n\nRole: Libbie / Boltie\n\nThere’s been a recent run of low budget indie films about normal citizens adopting superhero personas: Kick Ass 1 & 2, Super, The Green Hornet, Defendor and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\n\n2010’s Super is definitely one of the high watermarks of the genre. Offbeat comedy interspersed with spurts of extreme violence, the stellar ensemble cast all give top notch performances. In particular, Ellen Page’s fanatic Libby is infatuated with Rain Wilson’s pseudo hero The Crimson Bolt, to the point which she appoints herself his sidekick, Boltie. Doing what Page does best, she adds an eccentric quirk to the characters persona that appears completely naturalistic and genuine.\n\n2. Inception\n\nYear: 2010\n\nRole: Ariadne\n\nWith a budget bigger than the combined budget of the four other films featured on this list six times over, Chris Nolan’s sci-fi heist mind funk was one of the biggest films of 2010. Universally praised, the movie thematically explores the mind, dreams and the boundaries between fantasy and reality.\n\nTied together in an extremely intricate and intelligent way, Ellen Page has the leading female role. As part of Leonardo DiCaprio’s specialist team of extractors, Page plays the architect, creating dreamscapes for the others to navigate around.\n\nDescribed by Chris Nolan as being “the perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond her years.”\n\nDefinitely a change from Ellen Page’s usual role, she brings pure class to the ensemble.\n\n1. Hard Candy\n\nYear: 2005\n\nRole: Hayley Stark\n\nA tense and gripping thriller from writer / director David Slade. Ellen Page plays the vigilante heroine, confronting and torturing an online sexual predator played by Patrick Wilson.\n\nThe film is ruthless in it’s depiction of events, with excellent direction from Slade, opting for a more psychological and subtle approach.\n\nPage shines in the lead role and proves what a powerful and dominant on-screen presence she can be, expanding her range further and carrying one of the best films of the year, and one of the best modern horror films to date.\n\nConclusively, Ellen Page’s appeal, for me, is the ability to authentically convey character’s eccentricities without seeming they are forced or misplaced.\n\nThe trouble with a lot of contemporary actresses attempting to appear “quirky”, is occasionally let down by the writing, but is sometimes taken too far and blown out of proportion to the point that, the character becomes unrealistic and a cliched caricature. Far removed from the “Manic Pixie Dream Girl” roles, Ellen Page seems to embrace her own quirks and transform them in to perfectly rounded characters that are, believable, engaging, entertaining and memorable.\n\nTo celebrate the release of Frank earlier this year, I have decided to concoct a Michael Fassbender top 10.\n\nMichael Fassbender has been my favourite actor for a long time now, and I look forward to any project he is involved with.\n\nNominated for 3 BAFTA’s, 2 Golden Globes and an Oscar, Fassbender’s films range from mainstream science-fiction / fantasy epics to stripped down, low budget character dramas.\n\nNo matter what the role, Michael Fassbender always brings a unique and brilliant presence to the screen adding depth to more mainstream projects, and in some cases single-handedly carries an entire film.\n\nI have arranged this top 10 based on Fassbenders performances as apposed to the film as a whole, although, I am a big fan of every film on this list, and would recommend them all.\n\n10. 1: Life on the Limit\n\nYear: 2013\n\nRole: Himself (narrator)\n\nAn offbeat selection to kick off the list. Not strictly an acting role, however, this film is a personal preference that I would definitely champion. After 2010’s Senna and 2013’s Rush I became briefly obsessed with Formula 1 racing.\n\nAfter doing some reading up on the history of the sport and enjoying a number of BBC documentaries and films, I was highly anticipating the release of 1: Life on the Limit.\n\nI find the insight into the drivers psyche fascinating, and Michael Fassbender’s flawless narration compliments this engaging film superbly.\n\n9. X-men: Days of Future Past\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRole: Eric Lehnsherr / Magneto\n\nBryan Singer’s welcomed return to the X-Men franchise was the second prequel installment and second outing of Fassbender’s Magneto.\n\nBringing his own weight and gravitas to the character Ian McKellen had spent fourteen years fine-tuning, Fassbender is occasionally sidelined by Hugh Jackman’s iconinc Wolverine, however shines as the classic anti-hero.\n\nBalancing comedic banter with high-octane fantasy action, the film masterfully juggles the themes whilst simultaneously juggling time frames and character screen time.\n\n8. X-Men: First Class\n\nYear: 2011\n\nRole: Eric Lehnsherr / Magneto\n\nAn origins tale of Magneto and Professor X’s friendship and political duality, showcases all of Fassbenders finest characteristics. E.g. a brooding intensity and the ability to appear charming and collected, with an undercurrent of uncontrollable rage and forcefulness laying deep within the character.\n\nThis film is higher on the list than it’s ‘bigger’ sequel, as, not only did I prefer it, but it gives the actors more time to develop the characters and gives a more thorough insight into their personalities.\n\nMichael Fassbender particularly excels in the role, and appears to take the character more seriously than the film requires. Take for example the scene, where Magneto is getting to grips with his powers and trying to hone them under Xavier’s guidance. There is some serious ACTING going on in that scene. In a very good way.\n\n7. A Dangerous Method\n\nYear: 2011\n\nRole: Carl Jung\n\nPart of, what I refer to as, David Cronenberg’s ‘Viggo Mortensen Triology’ (A History of Violence, Eastern Promises and A Dangerous Method) Michael Fassbender more than holds his own in the leading role.\n\nAdapted from a 2002 stage play and based on a true story, Fassbender and Mortensen play two psychologists Jung and Freud, who have a turbulent professional relationship which is exacerbated by a mutual love interest played by Keira Knightly.\n\nHis portrayal of the troubled psychiatrist was a masterclass in character acting as Jung was propelled through a journey of dark psychoanalysis, bondage and academic feuds.\n\n6. Inglorious Basterds\n\nYear: 2009\n\nRole: Lieutenant Archie Hicox\n\nMy first proper exposure to the genius that is Michael Fassbender. I had previously seen him in 300 but it wasn’t until Tarantino’s pseudo World War 2 Epic that I really got a sense of his screen presence.\n\nWith no real knowledge of who he was or his previous work, I thought his segment of the film was by far the best installment. The sequence in the basement bar, was one of Tarantino’s best works and Fassbender carried the whole thing.\n\nIf you consider acting ability, imagine being Irish, acting as an Englishman who is posing as a German. Not only posing as a German, but impressively communicating German with a hint of doubt in your regional Germanic accent, which is used as a plot device.\n\nLets see Brad Pitt do that.\n\n5. Prometheus\n\nYear: 2012\n\nRole: David\n\nRidley Scott’s hugely underrated first installment of the Alien prequels. With an absolutely stellar ensemble cast featuring Noomi Repace, Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, Sean Harris and of course Michael Fassbender, I thought was a fantastically innovative and thought provoking sci-fi blockbuster.\n\nFassbender’s David is the ships butler. An artificial intelligence unit designed to be indistinguishable from humans. The character is marvelously crafted and the classic existential sci-fi themes of paranoia, questioning identity and whether robots have thoughts or feelings are all addressed whilst Fassbender is again requested to appear vacant and charming, whilst a potential dark, evil agenda may be underlying.\n\n4. Hunger\n\nYear: 2008\n\nRole: Bobby Sands\n\nEvidently Michael Fassbender has an incredibly fruitful working relationship with artist turned director Steve McQueen. Starring in all three of McQueen’s acclaimed feature length films, their first collaboration was on Hunger. The factual tale of Bobby Sands and the IRA hunger strike of 1981.\n\nFassbender’s physical degeneration is something to behold, as well as his ruthless portrayal of Sands. Featuring a scene that McQueen films as a 17 minute shot, of a conversation between Michael Fassbender and Liam Cunningham. The scene has become iconic in modern cinema.\n\n3. Shame\n\nYear: 2011\n\nRole: Brandon Sullivan\n\nFassbender was McQueen’s first and only choice for the leading role in this dark drama.\n\nDespite being a film about sexual addiction, the movie is completely\n\nanti-erotic and treats the addiction as seriously as any other. Fassbender’s complex character lives in a lonely world built around routine and self degradation.\n\nHis life is complicated further with the arrival of his troubled sister, played by Carey Mulligan, who turns up unannounced and forces him to confront his addiction.\n\nSimilarly to Hunger, Shame, demands an extremely physical performance from Michael Fassbender as well as an engaging emotional collapse, resulting in a finale of bizarre and tortured sexual exploration.\n\n2. Twelve Years a Slave\n\nYear: 2013\n\nRole: Edwin Epps\n\nDefinitely Fassbender’s most unlikable screen character. Edwin Epps is the epitome of unpredictable, unsympathetic, derranged cruelty.\n\nPart of the supporting ensemble from the Oscar winning Twelve Years a Slave, Michael Fassbender’s Oscar nominated performance is the most powerful of his career.\n\n1. Frank\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRole: Frank\n\nMy favourite film of the year so far. Frank is a movie loosely based on a Northern English comedian, played as an American by a German / Irish actor, fictitiously portrayed as the lead singer and driving force behind an avant-garde art band with an unpronounceable band name. Naturally it didn’t have mainstream release.\n\nShown wearing the novelty Frank head for 99% of the run time, it’s pretty mind blowing how Michael Fassbender is able to generate such heart and warmth towards the character. You are engrossed with Frank and are made to laugh and empathise with him throughout the whole film.\n\nAlso the song I Love you More performed by Fassbender in the film immediately resonated with me, in the same way Radiohead’s Creep did all those years ago. Powerful stuff.\n\nWell, that was my list. If it is not proof enough that Michael Fassbender is the greatest actor of this generation, I would love to know of anyone else who is capable of portraying such a wide range of emotions…. without the use of their face.\n\nTerry Gilliam’s latest film The Zero Theorem is due to be released this December. A dramatic Sci-Fi / fantasy starring Christoph Waltz centring on a computer hacker struggling to discover the meaning behind human existence, due to constant interruptions from Management. Sounds pretty quintessentially Gilliam ey? I can’t wait either.\n\nIn tribute to one of my favourite directors forthcoming release, I’ve knocked up a painstakingly watertight top 5 for your consideration. Having directed a modest eleven feature length movies to select from it really was an arduous task to arrange a top five, as there are no weak links. Many argue that Gilliam’s least ‘Gilliam’ film would be 2005’s The Brothers Grimm, however for my money it’s still a thoroughly enjoyable piece with traces of Gilliam essence sprinkled liberally throughout.\n\nAs a personal rule I’ve excluded any Monty Python projects. I’m a huge Python fan, therefore incredibly biased, and in the interest of fairness, the Python films were a six man collaboration, and for an appraisal of Terry’s solo work I feel his ‘non-Python’ efforts should be the movies to assess.\n\nHere we go.\n\n5. Tideland (2005)\n\nTo suggest this is Gilliam’s ‘strangest’ film would be a bold statement, in the vein of selecting a Motörhead song as the ‘heaviest’. For me it’s definitely Terry’s darkest outing as a filmmaker. Visually and thematically the film never shy’s away from the appalling situations in which our heroine, Jeliza-Rose (played brilliantly by child actor Jodelle Ferland), finds herself in. The dark and depressing home life Jeliza-Rose is subjected to is twisted into a childlike fantasy world, and the entire film is a reflection of a child’s overactive imagination responding to atrocities she can’t completely comprehend. To form an opinion on Tideland would involve (in my opinion) at least three viewings. If you can make it through the two hours of Gilliam’s nightmareish drama and still come out the other side entertained and intrigued… the rest of this list will be a doddle.\n\n4. Brazil (1985)\n\nAny film academics feel free to scream at this point. Brazil, perhaps Gilliam’s most acclaimed, respected and revered masterpiece so low down the list? That’s just the way it goes I’m afraid. There is absolutely no doubt that Brazil is a definite masterpiece, but there isn’t a film you could pluck from this top 5 that could be suggested otherwise.\n\nThe absolute cream of the British acting crop do their turn in this fantastical, dramatic sci-fi flick. Featuring Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Jim Broadbent, Peter Vaughn and Michael Palin in supporting roles whilst Jonathan Pryce and Kim Greist lead the proceedings. Perhaps the most memorable role belongs to Robert De Niro in a cameo as an eccentric, renegade, air conditioning specialist.\n\nWithout spoiling too much of the plot the film deals with a number of subjects in a totalitarian future world, and cleverly blends comedy, science fiction and drama. A film obsessed with ‘paperwork’, see’s at the beginning, an internal error in the system, leading to a chain reaction of events involving our leading man Jonathan Pryce. A quiet, unadventurous man who is content in his own dreamworld of flying, vast landscapes and the ‘perfect’ woman finds himself thrown into this labyrinth of conspiracy and mystery. Gilliam’s quips on, normally bland, subjects such as plastic surgery are hilariously outrageous and the only thing more impressive than the myriad of ‘beefs’ Gilliam had with the state of the world in 1985, is the visual styling, as every frame is filled with ingenious imagery, costume and special effects.\n\n3. Twelve Monkeys (1995)\n\nThis was in fact the first Terry Gilliam film I had the pleasure of seeing, around it’s VHS release date of 1997. A pretty heavy viewing for a ten year old to indulge in, however the film’s always stuck with me and I have very nostalgic memories of watching it. Of course I didn’t understand the intricacies of the plot at such an early age but the visuals and the soundtrack had a profound effect on me. I had never seen anything as striking as the brash white colour scheme of the institution James Cole (Bruce Willis) was being held in, and the soundtrack was so bold and piercing that it haunted me for weeks afterwards. The camera angles Gilliam uses to film Brad Pitt (at his looniest) were so abnormal and significantly different to any Bruce Willis Hollywood film I had seen previously. I was baffled.\n\nOf course revisiting the film as a teenager and an adult, you really get to terms with the fantastically non-linear plot of time travelling to prevent the end of the world. A high-concept that is handled with such restraint and skill focusing more on the characters and the complexity of time travel than it does on the action. Again like all of Gilliam’s films, the visual style is unbelievably memorable, particularly for me, and it remains, one of everyone involved’s finest two hours and nine minutes.\n\n2. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009)\n\nThe first time I saw this film, I was completely charmed by it. The film, even before watching it, already meant a lot to me, due to the tragic loss of Heath Ledger, who’s praises I could not sing more highly. Hearing about it was for me, one of those moments when you remember every detail of where you were and what you were doing. Instead of the generation previous to mine remembering where they were when Kennedy was shot, for me it’ll be remembering where I was when I heard Heath Ledger had passed away. Losing Heath midway through production, Gilliam enlisted the help of Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law to fill in the blanks. Twisting the story slightly to justify why a character was suddenly being portrayed by four different actors was an ingenious move and would have still worked brilliantly regardless of circumstance.\n\nA classic Victorian, travelling sideshow, with a twist of the bizarre and supernatural is set brilliantly against a backdrop of modern (unreceptive) Britain. A stranded man suffering from amnesia known only as Tony (Heath Ledger) is recruited to ‘jazz up’ their act to appeal to a wider audience. With comically sinister undertones involving a backdated deal with the Devil (Tom Waits), or should it be Tom Waits (the Devil), see’s the film flit between, fantasy, reality, the supernatural, the grim and the comical, all ending with a climactic revelation. Some of Gilliam’s best animation is present throughout the film and is clearly a nod to his earlier Monty Python years (but with vastly superior production technology). The film does dart around at some speed between it’s fantastical segues, but with a grim and realistic portrayal of modern Britain you always feel grounded and safe within the film. I REALLY loved this movie.\n\n1. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)\n\nAs I’m sure was the case for most students, this film was pretty much on a continuous loop from age 15 – 22. It’s a perfect film. Seriously, can you honestly think of anything that’s wrong with Fear and Loathing?\n\nI first saw the movie having never read any (or even heard of) Hunter S. Thompson. Within about thirty seconds of the film opening, that all becomes irrelevant. Approaching the film with no knowledge of Hunter Thompson, 1960’s American politics, the effects of narcotic / hallucinogenic drugs and even struggling to comprehend a large percentage of the dialogue, for some reason, didn’t matter. It just flies at you at a hundred miles an hour, immerses you in the most bizarre but also beautiful colours and visuals, serenades you with such poignant philosophies, delivered with such attention to eccentric detail and pumps in a soundtrack that you wish was the soundtrack to your life. This is just a small percentage of the quirky offbeat treats that lie in store. You can watch the film a hundred times and still strip away layers you didn’t know existed, finding a whole other mess of brilliance just waiting underneath.\n\nGilliam is a true genius filmmaker, and you’d be in great company selecting any film from the list. There’s not really a bad sounding element to any aspect of his latest film and you’ll be sure to hear my thoughts, after I’ve digested every frame of it.\n\nUntil then….\n\nYou can’t stop here….\n\nThis is bat country.\n\nFor years I’ve been surrounded by Lord of the Rings fans. My partner, the majority of my friends and most of my academic peers during my studies are pretty mad on LOTR.\n\nFirstly, I have no knowledge of the books, so this post is specific to the Peter Jackson film adaptations. I’ve seen The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King numerable times. In both their cinematic format and extended DVD editions. For the purpose of continuity though I’ll be writing in terms of the extended editions, which seem to be the preferred viewing for the majority of fans.\n\nSecondly, I don’t wish to offend anyone in this post, my aim is not to bad mouth the movies. I’ve always felt out of the loop regarding these films, like the penny just wasn’t dropping for me as to why they’re almost universally adored and showered with accolades. So I thought if I write my thoughts and theories down, that might help me channel a more concise overview and see if there are any like minded people out there. Either way, please don’t take offence and send me abusive messages. Yeah right, like that’ll happen.\n\nI’ll start on a positive. I don’t hate them. After the wonderful Clerks 2 debate regarding Star Wars vs. Lord of the Rings, this has often been a topic of conversation with some of my friends. A usually comical, but if alcohol’s involved, almost certainly passionate back and forth will ensue about which trilogy is the more superior yada yada yada. Particularly on May the 4th, just gone, an argument raged between myself and a good friend of mine. In retrospect, I was far too aggressive and rude, so many apologies for that, if he’s reading. It did get me thinking though. Why aren’t I absolutely in love with everything about this film franchise? I mean I’ve watched them all repeatedly, in the presence of fans, but it just doesn’t seem to have the same renascence with me. Like I said, I don’t hate them by any means, but chances are I could list 100 films or more I’d rather be watching.\n\nThis isn’t going to be the most coherent or flowing piece of writing I’ve ever done by the way. I’m finding it hard to express my grievances and it’s a little all over the place. The points are there though, so bear with me.\n\nI remember comedian Steve Merchant discussing his underwhelmed feeling after seeing the LOTR trilogy. His theory was, that when people defend the battle sequences of the film they are praising the direction from Jackson. However Merchant goes on to say, where as others class it as world class direction, he see’s it as good time management. I couldn’t agree more. There’s no denying the epicness of the films, but without substance it’s almost meaningless. That’s what I don’t take away from the films, substance.\n\nArguably, the plot is rather straight forward, the fellowship have to guard a ring, get it safely from point A to point B and destroy it, thus saving the day. In a nutshell, that’s the plot. Of course the film is about the journey. I don’t have a problem with that, it’s just, the journey seems like 12 hours worth of hiking and repetitive set pieces.\n\nEveryone walks.\n\nNew set of characters are introduced.\n\nMild peril, slight adventure, daring escape.\n\nEveryone walks.\n\nNew set of characters.\n\nMild peril… and so on.\n\nWhen you have a 12 hour long saga about a journey, where the initial plot can be summarised in a sentence, the entertainment and hook of the films must come from the character development, acting, dialogue and action.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’ve no problem with minimal plot. I’m a big fan of Paul Thomas Anderson for example. However, his use of dialogue and the way he uses his actors is so inventive and intelligent, you almost don’t need a plot at all to enjoy his ambient film making.\n\nThe dialogue in LOTR’s, I assume most, if not all, is lifted from the novels. It’s not funny or particularly witty. I don’t find it intriguing in anyway. There don’t seem to be any surprises or twists, or anything even coming close to a Chris Nolanesque reveal in the story. The edge of my seat wasn’t visited once during the 12 hour slug around Middle Earth. My heart stayed firmly in my chest, not once gracing my throat and I just let the story play out.\n\nThere were moments of mild peril and adventure interspersed with the journey, but the story and dialogue were just kind of flat. My friends and I are big fans of quoting and referencing films, but in a 12 hour trilogy there just isn’t a lot of memorable dialogue. Aside from a few Gollum one liners, it’s pretty stale.\n\nNow I’m sure you’re all screaming, no no no, it’s all about the subtext. Which yes, I admit there are a few interesting themes running through the movies. However, I’m a big fan of films, and any theme you could throw at me that’s not Tolkien specific, I could give you an example of a film that explores more interestingly. A film I would rather be watching than LOTR.\n\nThe acting in the film is fine. I mean I’m not a huge Elijah Wood fan and Orlando Bloom couldn’t act his way out of a paper bag, but Ian McKellen hams it up nicely bringing his thespian talents to Middle Earth and I’ll watch Christopher Lee in anything. The characters just don’t appear to be interesting enough for the actors to utilize their talents though. At the 76th academy awards, where Return of the King pretty much cleaned up there wasn’t a single nomination in an acting category. It could be argued this was due to an ensemble cast situation, but if they really wanted to, anyone could have been nominated in the supporting actor / actress category. I absolutely love Viggo Mortenssen, but let’s be honest, they almost settled on Stuart Townsend for the role of Aragorn. When you have to come in and act in a role that potentially could have been performed by Stuart Townsend, you’re not going to have to strain yourself too much. I revisited the trilogy after seeing Mortenssen in David Cronenberg’s A History of Violence, Eastern Promises and A Dangerous Method. A much superior triple bill in my opinion. I was completely blown away by how brilliant Mortenssen is in the films, so I though, this must be it, this must be why everyone loves LOTR so much. I went to revisit LOTR and I thought, okay, the story and the dialogue didn’t grip me, the action set pieces get a bit boring, people must love it for the acting. I’ll rewatch them and really focus on the subtleties of the performance. It’s fine. That’s all I can say about the acting, it’s fine, it’s standard, that’s it. It just made me really wish I was watching Viggo Mortenssen in a Cronenberg film. I really wished I was watching Peter Jackson’s Bad Taste, Braindead or The Frighteners, and I really wished I understood why this 12 hour epic doesn’t affect me.\n\nPeople have argued that because I like Star Wars, I’m not sophisticated enough to enjoy LOTR, as it’s intended for adults. I would argue that any film franchise that has a PG / 12 rating isn’t geared towards adults. I mean any film rated 12 isn’t necessarily a kids film. Chris Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy are extremely intelligent, thought provoking and explore themes of an adult nature. If you were however to cite an adult take on Medival Fantasy, I would refer you to the series Game of Thrones.\n\nGame of Thrones was a big inspiration behind this post, as for years I thought it was simply the Medival Fantasy genre that I didn’t connect with, therefore, this was the reason why I didn’t connect with Lord of the Rings. However I’m a huge Game of Thrones fan, all the elements I cited as being Lord of the Rings weakest points, it seems to bask in. The dialogue is sharp, witty, humorous and intelligent leaving the audience gripped. The surprises, twists and reveals are astounding and the acting, especially Peter Dinklage is perfect. The themes, storylines and plot twists are are juggled together expertly, and in a single series of Game of Thrones (significantly shorter than LOTR’s total running time), you get, perhaps the best character development on television today.\n\nSo help. Why don’t I love or even highly rate these films? I’m a big Viggo Mortenssen fan, I love Peter Jackson’s early directorial work and now it would seem I enjoy stories set within the Medieval Fantasy genre. So is it a masterpiece? Or does the epicness of these movies refer only to the budget and the running time?\n\nPart 2. One, Two, Freddy’s Coming for You…\n\n1982 – 1992\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nA Wes Craven twist on the slasher genre. Adding a sinister psychological element to the mix Craven merges imagination, dreams and reality masterfully, and introduces audiences to one of the most charismatic antagonists in horror history.\n\nFreddy Kruger’s approach to preying on his victims is particularly sadistic as he psychologically torments them to the point of delirium, before exacting physical brutality. The idea of falling asleep being the danger is profoundly effective, as there is absolutely no escaping the inevitable.\n\nNot only does the film broach a number of classic slasher film themes, e.g. Teenage sexual exploration. It also utilises some extremely innovative filming techniques to emphasise dreamscape. For example when the character of Tina is being mutilated in her sleep, we see her elevated (in the real world), as if possessed and flung around an entire room in a severely brutal manner. The idea of being attacked during a dream is such a fantastic horror concept, because, not only can the protagonists witnessing these atrocities not explain what is happening. They also cannot do anything to stop it.\n\nThis was the first in a long running series of sequels, spin offs and remakes (some more successful and entertaining than others). Nothing since has ever captured the magic of Craven’s original and Robert Englund’s creepy, charismatic performance was integral in the films genius, representing a different form of slasher film killer that focused more on psychological torment than brutal silent villains.\n\nThe Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)\n\nA tremendously ambitious project for a horror film, the Serpent and the Rainbow stars Bill Pullman as an anthropologist sent to Haiti to investigate a drug used in voodoo practices for a pharmaceutical company. As with a number of Craven’s works, the film is loosely based on a true story.\n\nFirstly, Bill Pullman is very good in the central role. The film is narrated by Pullmans character throughout and exposition is set up and explained. This never appears patronising towards the audience though and, in fact, is an interesting insight into other cultures, religions and ancient practices. It perhaps could be best described as a horrifying and non-family friendly Indiana Jones episode.\n\nThe film takes it’s time to tell the story and also takes it’s time between horrific interludes. This effectively enhances the horror, and Pullman’s slow deterioration of his minds well-being throughout the film builds the tension, making his interactions with the Haiti locals nail-biting, as the threat of violence and impending dread helps the film build to a climactic crescendo of some of the most bizarre ritualistic horror in 1980’s cinema.\n\nWhereas films such as the Saw and Hostel series deal with torture in a gratuitous, stupid and uninspired fashion. The Serpent and the Rainbow is an intelligently written and directed horror film, making the torture sequences seem all the more threatening, as they actually mean something.\n\nThe People Under the Stair (1991)\n\nIn a lot of the reviews and write ups for The People Under the Stairs, the film’s categorised as a comedy/horror. I’ll be straight with you, I’ve seen the film a handful of times and never laughed once. In fact, out of Wes Craven’s entire body of work, this often overlooked addition is, for me, the most unsettling of his films since Last House on the Left. The intense creepiness of the film is portrayed through the parents of Alice, credited simply as ‘Man’ and ‘Woman’.\n\nThe film pretty much entirely takes place in Alice’s house, which is shown to be an impenetrable fortress (at the hands of her parents), and when their home-life is invaded by a group of con-artist thieves and their young helper, things begin to escalate in a sustained, intensely creepy and perversely weird manner.\n\nObviously no film in the history of cinema could have misjudged comic elements and interludes as severely as Last House on the Left, but if the People Under the Stairs is intended to be a comedy, the idea of the circumstances in which the films anti-heroes find themselves being represented funny, simply adds to the creepy undercurrent of the entire piece. If it’s dark humour, it’s dark to the point of pitch black, therefore not entirely visible.\n\nIt’s definitely one of my favourite Craven films, and if anyone found it funny, I’d love to know!\n\nPart 3 to follow…."
