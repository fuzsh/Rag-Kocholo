That one being Tusk, the precursor to this film and the first film in the True North trilogy. Though I'm more than aware of its story enough to know that they aren't related. With exception of overlapping characters. So, you can jump right in without missing to much, if really anything at all. I'm not sure what it is about Kevin Smith's writing, but I can always get into his films. No matter how strange and cheesy the plot gets and this one gets plenty of both.
