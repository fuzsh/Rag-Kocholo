        "text": "I haven’t been playing sax that long, but I am frequently inspired by the historic trailblazers that paved the way to modern jazz music. Perhaps my most significant inspiration to continue to improve my musicianship is legendary saxophonist Charlie “Bird” Parker. Charlie Parker is a jazz icon, and his story needs to be shared. I believe he was the figure who contemporized the music toward what we now know. His work single-handedly paved the way for even more complex writing in music and more sophisticated improvisation. So let’s see what made Bird a jazz giant and why he motivates me.\n\n(Taken from the Library of Congress.)\n\nBird was born on August 29th, 1920, in Kansas City on the Kansas side. He grew up in a low-income family, with his father being a stage performer and his mother being a chambermaid. Through musical lessons, Parker grew fond of playing and eventually joined the marching band playing the Baritone. Later though, Parker received his first alto saxophone for Christmas, and that saxophone would be the instrument of his choice. As a youth, he loved going to the various jazz clubs around the city, particularly around 12th and Vine Street. His fondness for music grew so much that he dropped out of high school in 1935. Afterward, he tried his hands at playing at the jazz and nightclubs, turning himself into a little local celebrity and eventually joining up with youth bands, including pianist Jay McShann whom he toured in Chicago and New York City with. During his tenure with McShann, he also gained his famous moniker of “Yardbird”, most commonly shortened to just “Bird.” Eventually, Parker chose to stick around in the Big Apple, where his career would continue to soar to new heights. That’s one of the aspects I like about Parker: his passion for improving. By dropping out of high school, he fully engaged himself in doing something he loved, which is a quality I admire. Parker’s drive to improve has helped me overcome challenging situations in my short career as a saxophonist. And for that, I’d like to bring you to an anecdote in his story.\n\nI want to share a famous and possibly mythical anecdote about Parker. In 1937 at age 16, Charlie Parker decided to give a shot at his craft in front of professional musicians. It was at a nightclub, and performing that night was Count Basie’s orchestra, with drummer Jo Jones on stage. There was a line of performers that night, and Parker knew it was his time. He stepped onstage and began soloing until he lost the tune and, eventually, the time. Everything stopped. Silence. At this moment, Jones picked up his cymbal and famously threw it to the ground to shame the teen. Bird walked out of the club that night amidst the audience’s jeers. Afterward, he disappeared. He entered what many musicians call the “woodshed,” a term used to describe a place where we can improvise and practice to our heart’s content in isolation. Charlie Parker was gone for ten months, devoting himself to music, practicing 15 hours a day! When he returned to the scene in the fall, many remarked he had become a “changed musician.” It’s this event which speaks to me. He went beyond being resilient in this situation: he single-handedly turned this setback into a motivator to improve his craft and turn himself into someone renowned and respected. I faced a similar problem a couple of months ago. I took inspiration from Parker during that event and used that to improve myself, and I continue to look back to that event to motivate me. I feel that without Parker, I wouldn’t get myself past other setbacks in my life. It’s a lesson about resilience I think all of us could learn.\n\nIt’s his dedication to his craft that helped him have a revelation. In 1939, Parker was soloing on the song “Cherokee” with guitarist William Fleet when he had an epiphany. He said he had gotten bored with the typical chord changes you would use to get to the following note. In his words, he “came alive.” Up to this point, jazz was diatonic, meaning the basic melodies and harmonies used traditional major and minor scales. This is what upset Parker. He realized that all of the notes in the chromatic scale could lead to any note melodically. Thus, instead of a typical chord progression to the following note, Parker would add “substitute” chords from the chromatic scale to get to the next note. And oh, did Parker utilize this idea to the fullest extent. It’s common to see in transcriptions of Parker’s solos or hear in recordings of his music myriads of 16th notes littered with accidentals. Take a listen to some of his recordings on “Cherokee,” “Bloomdido,” or “Ornithology,” to name a few pieces, if you wish to hear his style in action. This simple revelation expanded the palette vastly of what the jazz soloist could accomplish. This forms the basis of a complicated form of jazz called Bebop.\n\nIn the 1940s, Parker became quite famous in the New York City jazz scene as many young musicians, including Thelonious Monk and Dizzy Gillespie, were intrigued by his style. In particular, Parker formed a good friendship with Gillespie as they performed with groups led by Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine. In their downtime, they honed their newfound soloing and improvisation skills, continuing to pioneer Bebop and push it toward the mainstream. Eventually, in 1945, Parker and Gillespie broke off and formed their quintet: the very first Bebop-centric quintet. Parker and his band toured throughout the country, where he spread Bebop’s profound influence across the nation. In New York, a jazz club was named in his honor: “Birdland.” Birdland would become perhaps the most famous of the nightclubs of 1950s jazz, a true testament to Bird’s impact. Although not at the original address, you can still visit the club today to see a band play.\n\n(A photo of the Birdland Jazz Club.)\n\nUnfortunately, the 1950s were the twilight years of his career. He had been suffering from heroin addiction and many other mental and physical health problems. Parker had suffered many divorces as well as the death of his daughter. When he returned to New York, he was arrested for heroin possession in 1951 and revoked his cabaret card for 15 months, meaning he couldn’t play in any of the city’s nightclubs. When his card was returned, his reputation was tarnished, so many clubs, including Birdland, refused to get him a gig. He later died of pneumonia and complications relating to his longtime substance abuse while resting in the Stanhope Hotel on March 12, 1955.\n\nShortly after his death, a Beat-era poet named Ted Joans and a few others scribbled the famous words “BIRD LIVES!” with chalk across the various walls and fences of Greenwich Village, a meaningful representation of his legacy. In a way, Bird still does live on knowing the successes of the craft he hallmarked, watching over the musicians who continue to analyze and perform his style. He lives on as perhaps the most seminal figure in jazz music and a key figure in my life.\n\n(Bird Lives graffiti.)\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/musicians/charlie-parker\n\nhttps://charlieparkermusic.com/about/\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Charlie-Parker\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/art/bebop\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/17/charlie-parker-cymbal-thrown\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6_kbDGIBdc"
