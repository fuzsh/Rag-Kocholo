        "text": "(1920–55). The legendary jazzman known as Bird had a profound influence on an entire generation of jazz performers, and musicians still pay tribute to his innovative bop style. After the death of Charlie Parker, hipsters wrote BIRD LIVES graffiti on city sidewalks and walls. The celebrated nickname is short for Yardbird—a reference to his appetite for fried chicken or, according to other sources, his habit of hanging out in the alleys behind jazz clubs to play his alto saxophone when he was too young and inept to be allowed inside.\n\nCharles Parker, Jr., was born on Aug. 29, 1920, in Kansas City, Kan. In 1927 his family moved to Kansas City, Mo., which was the center of a blues-based style of jazz (see Jazz). He played the tuba in the high school band, but his mother thought it looked funny and bought him an alto saxophone. Because he taught himself how to play it, he used all 12 keys and developed great facility. By the age of 16, he had a wife and child and was earning $1.25 a night as a musician.\n\nBird has been credited with inventing the harmonic changes that bop brought to jazz. He claimed that he had become bored with playing the same arrangements night after night. Soon after he moved to New York City in 1939, Bird found the changes when he started playing the upper parts of the chords.\n\nBird’s remarkable gifts as an improviser at after-hours clubs brought him an offer to participate in jam sessions at Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem in late 1941. He developed the shape of bop with such artists as Thelonious Monk and Dizzy Gillespie. Beginning in 1945, Bird made many recordings, including his first with Dizzy and his first with Miles Davis on trumpet. As a result of drug addiction, he broke down while recording ‘Lover Man’ in Los Angeles in July 1946 and was confined to Camarillo State Hospital.\n\nIn 1949–51 Parker made three trips to Europe. He was admitted to Bellevue Hospital in New York City in September 1954 after a suicide attempt. His last public appearance was at Birdland, a club in New York City named for him. He died in New York City on March 12, 1955.\n\nParker described his music simply as “playing clean and looking for the pretty notes.” He often created new pieces based on the harmonies of popular songs. Such works as ‘Anthropology’, written with Gillespie and based on George Gershwin’s ‘I Got Rhythm’, became jazz standards. Some of his most popular songs are ‘Parker’s Mood’, ‘Confirmation’, ‘Ornithology’, ‘Billie’s Bounce’, and ‘Now’s the Time’."
