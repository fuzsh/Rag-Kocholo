        "text": "PORT JERVIS - Charlie Parker Jr.’s ashes sit in an urn in the living room of his sister Anna Decker’s apartment, next to a second urn holding their mother’s ashes.\n\nParker died March 19 after Port Jervis police shot him. Beverly Parker, their mother, who had been ill, died at the end of May.\n\n“She cried every day until she died, thinking it was her fault that Charlie got shot,” Decker said.\n\nA grand jury and a separate administrative investigation by the Orange County District Attorney’s Office and New York State Police cleared the officers who fired on Parker of any criminal wrongdoing, ruling that the shooting was justified under the state’s Penal Law. The family is working with lawyer Michael Sussman on a civil suit. Decker said this isn’t about money. She promised her mother she would pursue justice for Charlie.\n\nMORE: Orange County DA's Office will investigate police shooting of Port Jervis man\n\nMORE: Grand jury, district attorney clear police officers who fatally shot Port Jervis man\n\nPort Jervis police Chief William Worden said that now that the grand jury investigation is complete, his department will conduct an internal review to determine if the officers acted \"within the scope of departmental policy.\" That's standard for these cases, he said, and can take months.\n\nStruggling with alcohol and mental illness\n\nDecker said Parker had struggled with his mental illness and alcohol use, but by March he'd been doing well. He had stopped drinking and was in treatment for his mental health. He was working and caring for their mom at her apartment on Railroad Avenue.\n\nThis is Decker’s account of the night of March 19.\n\nDecker said she had visited her mom with her son Dominick, now 5, and headed home. Just a few minutes later, she said, her mom called, telling her Charlie was acting up and police were on the way. In the past, Beverly Parker had called police for help with Charlie, and they would talk to him and calm him down.\n\nIn the two minutes or so it took Decker to drive to her mother’s place, the encounter between Parker and police went bad.\n\nDecker said that as she arrived, she heard shots and someone counting. She said she saw Charlie lying face-up on the ground, with police standing near him. She said she ran up to them, asking what happened, why no one was helping her brother. She said she heard Charlie say her name. A detective or officer took her to a cruiser and began asking her questions. She says she never saw anyone perform CPR or attend to Parker.\n\nDecker said she and her mother thought at first that police had used a Taser on Parker, and they didn’t learn he’d been shot and that he was dead until they got to the hospital. She said that police should have tried harder to calm Charlie down.\n\n\"I told the cops that night, ‘Please investigate, because it doesn’t sound right,’ ” she said. She’s frustrated that there’s no video footage, and that investigators on the case kept asking people who knew Charlie if he was violent.\n\nI think he was really upset with himself because he started drinking those two nights,” Decker said, questioning if he could have been steady on his feet with a blood alcohol concentration of .205% and his prescription antidepressants still in his system. “He shouldn’t have gone out with that knife. But I think he was following their orders.”\n\nDistrict Attorney's investigation\n\nOrange County District Attorney David Hoovler reiterated the account of the night produced by his office’s investigation of the shooting: Beverly Parker called to ask for help with her son, who was a psychiatric patient who was off his medication, and had a knife. He said the five officers arrived within five minutes of the 9:07 p.m. call. Beverly Parker met them at the door and pointed out her son sitting in the living room just inside the door, holding a knife, which he put to his own throat. Hoovler said the officers, two of them trained in crisis intervention, talked to him, trying to de-escalate the situation. Parker told them the only way he’d drop the knife was if they shot him, Hoovler said.\n\nDecker said her mother heard him say that once. She said police knew Charlie got dramatic.\n\nHoovler said police stayed outside, telling Parker to drop the knife, even when Parker retreated out of sight into the home, and then returned.\n\n“They tried to talk him down, and he escalated it,” Hoovler said. \"I understand why the family would be upset. But they tried to de-escalate, and he was having no part of it.”\n\nHoovler said Parker came to the threshold, knife raised above his head in his right hand, hesitated, but then lunged or charged toward the officers. In the space of maybe a second, Hoovler said, one officer fired a Taser, missing Parker with one prong so it did nothing; and officers Jesse Clune and Andrew Haniuk fired their guns.\n\nHoovler said CPR was performed on Parker, substantiated by police accounts, medical items documented at the scene and a civilian witness who saw an officer bent over Parker.\n\nWhether the officers were properly supervised or whether they properly de-escalated — issues that might arise in a civil case — have no bearing under the law on whether a shooting is justified, Hoovler said.\n\nPolice to receive specialized training\n\nThis spring Hoovler will provide police with special training on use of force and de-escalation involving people with mental illness.\n\n“You’re asking police to treat a symptom of society that’s very difficult to deal with,” Hoovler said. “In police use of force cases, they’re damned if they do and damned if they don’t,” and likely to face civil liability either way.\n\nDecker wonders if things would be different if she’d gotten there first that night, or if police waited long enough to give her a chance to intervene.\n\n“Charlie had his problems, but he didn’t deserve what he got,” Decker said. “They couldn’t do something different?”\n\nhyakin@th-record.com"
