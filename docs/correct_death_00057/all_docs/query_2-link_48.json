        "text": "Charles Parker, Jr. (August 29, 1920 – March 12, 1955), also known as “Yardbird” and “Bird”, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer.[1]\n\nParker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop,[2] a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and improvisation. Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Many Parker recordings demonstrate his virtuoso playing style and complex melodic lines, sometimes combining jazz with other musical genres, including blues, Latin, and classical.[citation needed]\n\nParker acquired the nickname “Yardbird” early in his career;[3] this and its shortened form, “Bird”, which continued to be used for the rest of his life, inspired the titles of a number of Parker compositions, such as “Yardbird Suite“, “Ornithology“, “Bird Gets the Worm“, and “Bird of Paradise”. Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual rather than just an entertainer.[4]\n\nBiography\n\nChildhood\n\nCharles Parker, Jr. was born in Kansas City, Kansas and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, the only child of Charles and Addie Parker. He attended at Lincoln High School[5] in September 1934, but withdrew in December 1935, just before joining the local musicians’ union.[why?]\n\nParker began playing the saxophone at age 11, and at age 14 he joined his school’s band using a rented school instrument. His father, Charles, was often absent but provided some musical influence; he was a pianist, dancer and singer on the T.O.B.A. circuit. He later became a Pullman waiter or chef on the railways. Parker’s mother Addie worked nights at the local Western Union office. His biggest influence at that time was a young trombone player who taught him the basics of improvisation.[citation needed]\n\nEarly career\n\nIn the late 1930s Parker began to practice diligently. During this period he mastered improvisation and developed some of the ideas that led to bebop. In an interview with Paul Desmond, he said that he spent 3 to 4 years practicing up to 15 hours a day.[6]\n\nBands led by Count Basie and Bennie Moten undoubtedly influenced Parker. He played with local bands in jazz clubs around Kansas City, Missouri, where he perfected his technique, with the assistance of Buster Smith, whose dynamic transitions to double and triple time influenced Parker’s developing style.\n\nIn 1938, Parker joined pianist Jay McShann‘s territory band.[7] The band toured nightclubs and other venues of the southwest, as well as Chicago and New York City.[8][9] Parker made his professional recording debut with McShann’s band.\n\nAs a teenager, Parker developed a morphine addiction while in hospital after an automobile accident, and subsequently became addicted to heroin. He continued using heroin throughout his life, which ultimately contributed to his death.\n\nNew York City\n\nIn 1939 Parker moved to New York City, to pursue a career in music. He held several other jobs as well. He worked for nine dollars a week as a dishwasher at Jimmie’s Chicken Shack, where pianist Art Tatum performed.[10]\n\nIn 1942 Parker left McShann’s band and played for one year with Earl Hines, whose band included Dizzy Gillespie, who later played with Parker as a duo. Unfortunately, this period is virtually undocumented, due to the strike of 1942–1943 by the American Federation of Musicians, during which time few professional recordings were made. Parker joined a group of young musicians, and played in after-hours clubs in Harlem, such as Clark Monroe’s Uptown House and Minton’s Playhouse. These young iconoclasts included Gillespie, pianist Thelonious Monk, guitarist Charlie Christian, and drummer Kenny Clarke. The beboppers’ attitude was summed up in a famous quotation attributed to Monk by Mary Lou Williams: “We wanted a music that they couldn’t play”[11] – “they” referring to white bandleaders who had usurped and profited from swing music.[citation needed] The group played in venues on 52nd Street, including Three Deuces and the Onyx. While in New York City, Parker studied with his music teacher, Maury Deutsch.[citation needed]\n\nBebop\n\nAccording to an interview Parker gave in the 1950s, one night in 1939 he was playing “Cherokee” in a jam session with guitarist William “Biddy” Fleet when he hit upon a method for developing his solos that enabled one of his main musical innovations. He realized that the twelve tones of the chromatic scale can lead melodically to any key, breaking some of the confines of simpler jazz soloing.\n\nEarly in its development, this new type of jazz was rejected by many of the established, traditional jazz musicians who disdained their younger counterparts. The beboppers responded by calling these traditionalists “moldy figs“. However, some musicians, such as Coleman Hawkins and Tatum, were more positive about its development, and participated in jam sessions and recording dates in the new approach with its adherents.\n\nBecause of the two-year Musicians’ Union ban of all commercial recordings from 1942 to 1944, much of bebop’s early development was not captured for posterity. As a result, it gained limited radio exposure. Bebop musicians had a difficult time gaining widespread recognition. It was not until 1945, when the recording ban was lifted, that Parker’s collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, Bud Powell and others had a substantial effect on the jazz world. (One of their first small-group performances together was rediscovered and issued in 2005: a concert in New York’s Town Hall on June 22, 1945.) Bebop soon gained wider appeal among musicians and fans alike.\n\nOn November 26, 1945, Parker led a record date for the Savoy label, marketed as the “greatest Jazz session ever”. Recording as Charlie Parker’s Reboppers, Parker enlisted such sidemen as Gillespie and Miles Davis on trumpet, Curly Russell on bass and Roach on drums. The tracks recorded during this session include “Ko-Ko“, “Billie’s Bounce” and “Now’s the Time“.\n\nShortly afterward, the Parker/Gillespie band traveled to an unsuccessful engagement at Billy Berg’s club in Los Angeles. Most of the group returned to New York, but Parker remained in California, cashing in his return ticket to buy heroin. He experienced great hardship in California, eventually being committed to Camarillo State Mental Hospital for a six-month period.\n\nAddiction\n\nParker’s chronic addiction to heroin caused him to miss gigs and lose work. He frequently resorted to busking on the streets, receiving loans from fellow musicians and admirers, and pawning his saxophones for drug money. Heroin use was rampant in the jazz scene, and the drug could be acquired easily.\n\nAlthough he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker’s behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain when he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, and he began to drink heavily to compensate. A recording for the Dial label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track, “Max Making Wax”. When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, “Lover Man“, producer Ross Russell physically supported Parker. On “Bebop” (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts, “Blow!” at him. Charles Mingus considered this version of “Lover Man” to be among Parker’s greatest recordings, despite its flaws.[12] Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve.\n\nWhen Parker was released from the hospital, he was clean and healthy. Before leaving California, he recorded “Relaxin’ at Camarillo” in reference to his hospital stay. He returned to New York, resumed his addiction to heroin and recorded dozens of sides for the Savoy and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his so-called “classic quintet” including Davis and Roach.[citation needed]\n\nCharlie Parker with Strings\n\nA longstanding desire of Parker’s was to perform with a string section. He was a keen student of classical music, and contemporaries reported he was most interested in the music and formal innovations of Igor Stravinsky and longed to engage in a project akin to what later became known as Third Stream, a new kind of music, incorporating both jazz and classical elements as opposed to merely incorporating a string section into performance of jazz standards. On November 30, 1949, Norman Granz arranged for Parker to record an album of ballads with a mixed group of jazz and chamber orchestra musicians.[13] Six master takes from this session comprised the album Charlie Parker with Strings: “Just Friends“, “Everything Happens to Me“, “April in Paris“, “Summertime“, “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was“, and “If I Should Lose You“.\n\nJazz at Massey Hall\n\nIn 1953, Parker performed at Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada, joined by Gillespie, Mingus, Powell and Roach. Unfortunately, the concert clashed with a televised heavyweight boxing match between Rocky Marciano and Jersey Joe Walcott, so it was poorly attended. Mingus recorded the concert, resulting in the album Jazz at Massey Hall. At this concert, Parker played a plastic Grafton saxophone.[citation needed] At this point in his career he was experimenting with new sounds and materials. Parker himself explained the purpose of the plastic saxophone in a May 9, 1953 broadcast from Birdland and did so again in a subsequent May 1953 broadcast. Parker is known to have played several saxophones, including the Conn 6M, the Martin Handicraft and Selmer Model 22. He is also known to have performed with a King “Super 20” saxophone. Parker’s King Super 20 saxophone was made specially for him in 1947.[citation needed]\n\nDeath\n\nParker died on March 12, 1955, in the suite of his friend and patron Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter at the Stanhope Hotel in New York City, while watching The Dorsey Brothers‘ Stage Show on television. The official causes of death were lobar pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, but Parker also had an advanced case of cirrhosis and had suffered a heart attack. The coroner who performed his autopsy mistakenly estimated Parker’s 34-year-old body to be between 50 and 60 years of age.[14]\n\nSince 1950, Parker had been living with Chan Berg, the mother of his son Baird (who lived until 2014)[15] and his daughter Pree (who died as an infant of cystic fibrosis). He considered Chan his wife although he never formally married her, nor did he divorce his previous wife, Doris, whom he had married in 1948. This complicated the settling of Parker’s estate and would ultimately serve to frustrate his wish to be quietly interred in New York City.\n\nIt was well known that Parker never wanted to return to Kansas City, even in death.[citation needed] Parker had told Chan that he did not want to be buried in the city of his birth; that New York was his home. Dizzy Gillespie paid for the funeral arrangements[16] and organized a lying-in-state, a Harlem procession officiated by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., as well as a memorial concert, before Parker’s body was flown back to Missouri, in accordance with his mother’s wishes. Parker’s widow criticized Parker’s family for giving him a Christian funeral even though they knew he was a confirmed atheist.[17] Parker was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Missouri, in a hamlet known as Blue Summit, located close to I-435 and east Truman road.\n\nParker’s estate is managed by CMG Worldwide.\n\nMusic\n\nParker’s style of composition involved interpolation of original melodies over existing jazz forms and standards, a practice known as contrafact and still common in jazz today. Examples include “Ornithology“, also known as “How High The Moon” and “Yardbird Suite“, the vocal version of which is called “What Price Love”, with lyrics by Parker. The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material.\n\nWhile tunes such as “Now’s The Time”, “Billie’s Bounce”, “Au Privave“, “Barbados”, “Relaxin’ at Camarillo”, “Bloomdido“, and “Cool Blues” were based on conventional twelve-bar blues changes, Parker also created a unique version of the 12-bar blues for tunes such as “Blues for Alice“, “Laird Baird”, and “Si Si”. These unique chords are known popularly as “Bird Changes“.[citation needed] Like his solos, some of his compositions are characterized by long, complex melodic lines and a minimum of repetition although he did employ the use of repetition in some tunes, most notably “Now’s The Time”.\n\nParker contributed greatly to the modern jazz solo, one in which triplets and pick-up notes were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones, affording the soloist with more freedom to use passing tones, which soloists previously avoided. Parker was admired for his unique style of phrasing and innovative use of rhythm. Via his recordings and the popularity of the posthumously published Charlie Parker Omnibook, Parker’s identifiable style dominated jazz for many years to come.\n\nOther well-known Parker compositions include “Ah-Leu-Cha“, “Anthropology”, co-written with Gillespie, “Bird Gets the Worm“, “Cheryl”, “Confirmation”, “Constellation”, “Donna Lee“, “Moose the Mooche“, and “Scrapple from the Apple“.\n\nMiles Davis once said, “You can tell the history of jazz in four words: Louis Armstrong. Charlie Parker.”[18]\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Charlie Parker discography\n\nAwards and recognitions\n\nGrammy Award\n\nCharlie Parker Grammy Award History[19] Year Category Title Genre Label Result 1974 Best Performance By A Soloist First Recordings!
