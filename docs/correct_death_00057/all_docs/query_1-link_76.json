        "text": "CHITTENDEN, Vt. (WCAX/Gray News) - Firefighters in Vermont are mourning the loss of one of their own after he died in the line of duty Monday evening.\n\nThe Chittenden Volunteer Fire Department said Capt. Charlie Parker died after fighting a barn fire.\n\nAuthorities said crews were called to the fire around 5 p.m. Monday.\n\nAfter the fire was put out, they said Parker returned the tanker to the station and was later found unresponsive by another firefighter.\n\nLifesaving efforts began immediately but were unsuccessful.\n\nParker was a member of the department for more than 40 years.\n\nChittenden Assistant Fire Chief Conrad Zeller said the loss creates a big hole within the department and the wider community.\n\n“He did it the right way even if it wasn’t the easy way. He’s going to be missed,” Zeller said. “He was really committed to his family and the fire department. We joked around. Charlie’s nickname was ‘Chittenden Charlie.’”\n\nZeller said there are no funeral plans yet, but the department plans to escort Parker’s body home on Wednesday."
