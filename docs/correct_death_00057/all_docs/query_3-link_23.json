        "text": "Theater director David Saint lists his East Village penthouse with huge terrace for $5M\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nTheater director and producer David Saint is parting ways with his East Village home of 12 years. Saint, a longtime artistic director and producer of the 2021 film \"West Side Story,\" bought the penthouse at 123 Third Avenue for just over $3,864,000 in 2012. The home, which offers two bedrooms and a landscaped wraparound terrace, is asking $4,995,000.\n\nsee the terrace\n\nThis $9.75M East Village duplex has Cape Cod-style charm topped by a rooftop cottage\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nAs one of Manhattan's coveted properties with quaint rooftop cottages and cabins, the duplex condo at 72 East 1st Street isn't merely a quirky curiosity. The two-floor-plus-studio apartment has all of the perks of penthouse living. The thoroughly renovated home, asking $9,750,000, has the feel of an English country manor throughout, while offering modern style and convenience in its details and construction. At its apex, a Cape Cod-style shingled cottage and terrace provide a unique outdoor experience, in a neighborhood that's as urban as it gets.\n\nGet a closer look at this rare NYC refuge\n\nFor $1.7M, this compact Village loft is a sleek, seamless machine for city living\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nWhat this high-floor corner loft in the International Tailoring Company Building at 111 Fourth Avenue lacks in floor space, it makes up in well-designed form and function. The three-room co-op, asking $1,695,000, has been freshly renovated with an architect's expert eye; the result is sophisticated rather than small. Breathtaking city skyline vistas through massive loft windows–and 13-foot ceilings–add a definite boundless quality to the picture.\n\nSee how it all fits\n\nAnthony Rapp of ‘Rent’ lists East Village condo for $3.85M\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nAnthony Rapp, who played the leading role of Mark Cohen in Broadway's \"Rent,\" has put his East Village condo on the market for $3.85 million. Located within the luxury boutique building 32 East 1st Street, the actor's three-bedroom, three-bath home features designer-crafted details across roughly 1,500 square feet. According to the New York Post, Rapp, who also starred in the comedy \"Dazed and Confused,\" bought the apartment for $3.57 million in October 2021.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n$899K eco-friendly East Village co-op has a 400-plant green wall\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nLiving more sustainably can start at home, as seen in this East Village apartment. The eco-conscious two-bedroom co-op at 315 East 12th Street features formaldehyde-free cabinets, doors made of recycled plastics, and at the center, a living wall with 400 plants, which purify the air and create a sense of well-being. Asking $899,000, the apartment is efficient, with hidden closets, sliding doors, a Murphy bed, and a dining area with a table that pops up from the floor.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nLive in a former sculptors’ studio in a historic East Village carriage house for $8K/month\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nWe've all envied those charming celebrity carriage houses in the Village–like Taylor Swift's Cornelia Street home–but we also know they cost millions to own. Built in 1892, this quaint brick building at 249 1/2 East 13th Street was once the studio of sculptors Karl Bitter and Giuseppe Moretti (Bitter created the East Doors for the Trinity Church and medallions on the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Moretti, the \"Vulcan,\" the world's largest cast iron statue), and is often referred to as an important part of neighborhood history. You can now rent the entire home for $8,000 per month.\n\nCarriage house tour, this way\n\nThis $2.5M loft in a former East Village synagogue once belonged to photographer William Wegman\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nNow on the market for $2,500,000, this East Village loft at 431 East 6th Street is one of three in a building with a history that's in keeping with its colorful downtown neighborhood. Available for the first time in 40 years, the apartment, belonging to model and interior designer Maria Von Hartz, represents the latest incarnation of what was once an abandoned synagogue. The building, which is a tenancy-in-common property, was purchased in the 1980s by a group of artists who transformed the abandoned house of worship into beautiful loft homes. Among these artist-owners was celebrated photographer William Wegman of whimsical Weimaraner fame.\n\nTake a look inside"
