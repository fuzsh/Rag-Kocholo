        "text": "Reviews\n\nBrian Priestley has not just chased but captured the elusive Bird, illuminating the turbulent life and marvelous music with human and musical insight.\n\nDan Morgenstern, Director, Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies, and author of Living with Jazz\n\nBrian Priestley is one of the most accomplished jazz historians, critics, and biographers, and Chasin’ the Bird is an indispensable gem – an ideal introduction to a major figure in 20th century music and an inventive interpretation of Parker’s life and art that will also engage veteran jazz lovers. The comprehensive discography is a major bonus, making this a handbook every Bird chaser will relish.\n\nGary Giddins, author of Weather Bird and Tain’t What You Do\n\nAn absorbing and serious-minded biography.\n\nChris Parker, Vortex website\n\nBrian Priestley’s Chasin’ the Bird: The Life and Legacy of Charlie Parker serves as the best overall book on Parker since Gary Giddens’ photo-driven Celebrating Bird.\n\nNew York Sun\n\nPriestley’s revised and updated biography… offers valuable insights to Bird’s career, mainly because it is seen through the prism of his music… This volume makes a valuable contribution to jazz literature… A useful addition to the Parker library.\n\nDown Beat\n\nEven if you’ve read other books on Parker, you’ll gain some fresh perspective from this one. And if you’ve never read a book on Parker, you’d be well-advised to make this the first. Though Priestley is clearly a fan, he writes about the good in a clear-headed way and writes about the bad unflinchingly.\n\nKansas City Star\n\nEasily enjoyed in a single sitting, with your favorite Parker record… Well served by the breadth of Priestley’s musical knowledge and his tenacious desire for accuracy.\n\nNew York Times Book Review"
