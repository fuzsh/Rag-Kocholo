        "text": "Charlie Parker\n\nBorn on 29 August 1920 in Kansas City, Charlie Parker - or 'Bird' as he famously became known - began learning the alto saxophone as a child. After serving his apprenticeship with local musicians, he began experimenting with some of the harmonic concepts that led to the development of bebop, which would ultimately change the course of jazz.\n\nBebop was a dynamic and seemingly new form of jazz with a new approach to rhythm that used extended harmonies, complex substitute chords and chromatic intervals as the basis of improvisation. When Parker made his first live appearances on the legendary 52nd Street in New York City in early 1945 with the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, they were to establish an audience for bebop. This led to the recording of the classics 'Groovin' High', 'All The Things You Are' and 'Salt Peanuts'. In the months that followed, Parker started playing with the trumpeter Miles Davis and their earliest collaboration produced 'Now's The Time' and Parker's saxophone tour de force, 'Koko'.\n\nAfter a residency in Los Angeles, which helped establish bebop in the west, Parker returned to New York in Easter 1947 and, over the next year or so, set down a remarkable sequence of recordings that are amongst the finest in jazz. This includes 'Scrapple From the Apple', the slow blues 'Parker's Mood' and one of the saxophonist's most accomplished ballad performances, 'Embraceable You'. In the autumn of 1948, Parker signed an exclusive contract with Norman Granz, which produced 'Just Friends', Parker's best-selling record ever. He continued to record superb pieces in the early 1950s, including 'Star Eyes', 'Lover Man' and 'Night And Day'. Despite his innovations though, his dependence on hard drugs and alcohol destroyed him. Worn out by years of abuse, he died on 12 March 1955, aged just 34.\n\nCharlie Parker was the supreme creative figure of his time and has remained a major influence on many jazz musicians since. The bonus album features many of the artists, who along with Parker, helped develop the dynamic form of jazz known as bebop - including Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, trumpeter Fats Navarro and trombonist Jay Jay Johnson.\n\nMusicians\n\nCD1: Charlie Parker\n\n01 Tiny Grimes Quintette Feat Charlie Parker: Red Cross (1944)\n\n02 Dizzy Gillespie Sextet Feat Charlie Parker: Groovin' High (1945)\n\n03 Dizzy Gillespie &;amp Charlie Parker: All The Things You Are (1945)\n\n04 Dizzy Gillespie & Charlie Parker: Salt Peanuts (1945)\n\n05 Charlie Parker's Reboppers: Now's The Time (1945)\n\n06 Charlie Parker's Reboppers: Koko (1945)\n\n07 Charlie Parker Septet: Ortnithology (1946)\n\n08 Charlie Parker Quartet: Cool Blues (1947)\n\n09 Charlie Parker Quintet: Embraceable You (1947)\n\n10 Charlie Parker Quintet: Scrapple From The Apple (1947)\n\n11 Charlie Parker All Stars: Parker's Mood (1948)\n\n12 Charlie Parker: Repetition (1948)\n\n13 Charlie Parker: Out Of Nowhere (1950)\n\n14 Charlie Parker: Just Friends (1949)\n\n15 Charlie Parker: Bloomdido (1950)\n\n16 Charlie Parker: Star Eyes (1951)\n\n17 Charlie Parker: Au Privave (1951)\n\n18 Charlie Parker: My Little Suede Shoes (1951)\n\n19 Charlie Parker: Lover Man (1951)\n\n20 Charlie Parker: Blue For Alice (1951)\n\n21 Charlie Parker: Night And Day (1952)\n\n22 Charlie Parker: Confirmation (1953)\n\nCD2 - Bonus CD: The Rough Guide to Bebop\n\n01 Coleman Hawkins & His Orchestra: Woody'N You (1944)\n\n02 Dizzy Gillespie All Stars: Bebop (1945)\n\n03 Dizzy Gillespie Septet: A Night In Tunisia (1946)\n\n04 Dizzy Gillespie & His Orchestra: Things To Come (1946)\n\n05 Kenny Clarke And His 52nd Street Boys: 52nd Street Theme\n\n06 Miles Davis All Stars: Little Willie Leaps\n\n07 Thelonious Monk: In Walked Byd (1947)\n\n08 Thelonious Monk: Round Midnight (1947)\n\n09 Fats Navarro: Barry's Bop (1947)\n\n10 Fats Navarro: Nostalgia (1947)\n\n11 Dexter Gordon Quintet: Dexter's Riff (1947)\n\n12 Dizzy Gillespie & His Orchestra: Manteca\n\n13 Tadd Dameron With Fats Navarro: Lady Bird (1948)\n\n14 Miles Davis: Move (1949)\n\n15 Jay Jay Johnson's Boppers: Teapot (1949)\n\n16 Bud Powell: Bouncing With Bud (1949)\n\n17 Bud Powell: You Go To My Head (1949)\n\n18 Sonny Stitt & Bud Powell Quartet: All God's Chillun Got Rhythm (1949)\n\n19 Charlie Parker & Dizzy Gillespie: Hot House (1953)"
