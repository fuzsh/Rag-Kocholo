Once the coffin was almost\n\ndropped. Then the body was sent to Kansas City, where Bird had\n\nrequested that it not go, for burial. Some musicians, such as Gail\n\nBrockman, came from as far away as Chicago for the funeral services.\n\nOther New York-based musicians were conspicuous by their absence.\"\n\nThe remains were recently moved from one spot in KC to another more\n\nprominent one in KC, if I recall correctly.\n\nYou are correct that Doris Parker went against Bird's wishes, though.\n\nMike\n\nfitz...@eclipse.net\n\nhttp://www.eclipse.net/~fitzgera\n\nSpeaking as one who made the scene, Doris was a good woman.\n\nNot one of you guys was there, then, that I know of. But ... I was.\n\nand I knew Doris, Bird and Chan.\n\nEveryone gets born, goes through life, has experiences, dies, gets\n\ntalked about.\n\nSo ... what?!!\n\nDoris P. was good. May she rest in peace now. You guys just don't\n\nknow.\n\nBe decent. Let her be.\n\nnown.\n\nShe acted against Bird's wishes? After he died? Actually, I only knew\n\nthe living.\n\nDead is dead. Many people even leave wills which successfully get\n\ncontended. Doctors and hospital staffs are notorious for going against\n\npatient's wishes. This is not to excuse it, but ... pointing out facts\n\nof life.\n\nBird's death, like many deaths, left great emotional turmoil behind.\n\nWhile predictable ... it was also unbelievable at the time. Our hero\n\n.. gone.\n\nAs for Bird's wishes ... while I certainly do not know the inside story\n\n(nor do I pretend to) ... you've got to know that Bird had a VERY\n\nchildish side to him. And of course I'm not talking about the music.\n\nIn his music ... Bird was the Great Master. No doubt about it. Bird was\n\nin charge of things. Bird was in control. Bird was beautiful.\n\nSomebody said \"I live in my art; not in my life\". Bird lives for us in\n\nhis art.\n\nBut in his life, Bird ... poor Bird ... was a mix-up. When it comes to\n\n\"Bird's wishes\" ... you've got to understand ... Bird could be very\n\nwishy-washy. And often was.\n\nEvents like his funeral and burial and so forth, could not and did not\n\nplease everybody. It's what happened.\n\nnown."
