        "text": "A CLAP OF THUNDER HERALDED THE PASSING OF CHARLIE \"BIRD\" PARKER. Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter, who gave Parker refuge and comfort during his final days in her suite in the Hotel Stanhope on 5th Avenue in New York, recalled, \"At the moment of his going, there was a tremendous clap of thunder. I didn't think about it at the time, but I've thought about it often since; how strange it was.\" One musician speculated that Parker disintegrated into \"pure sound.\"\n\nCharlie Parker had lived life to its fullest. Robert Reisner, a friend of Parker and author of Bird: The Legend of Charlie Parker, observed, \"Charlie Parker, in the brief span of his life, crowded more living into it than any other human being. He was a man of tremendous physical appetites. No one had such a love of life, and no one tried harder to kill himself....\" Dr. Richard Freymann, the attendant physician during Parker's final days at the Stanhope Hotel, judged him fifty-three years old. He was thirty-four at the time of his death.\n\nParker's early death came as no surprise to those who knew him well. After becoming hooked on heroin at the age of sixteen, he struggled with drug addiction, alcohol abuse and mental illness for the rest of his life. Over the years, his massive consumption of alcohol and drugs ravaged his already fragile physical and mental health.\n\nNevertheless, during his short life, Parker changed the course of music. Like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and John Coltrane, he was a pioneering composer and improviser who pioneered a new era of jazz and influenced subsequent generations of musicians.\n\nParker's brilliance and charisma also inspired dancers, poets, writers, filmmakers and visual artists. Jack Kerouac emulated Parker's improvisational style in his poem \"Mexico City Blues\". Clint Eastwood paid homage to Parker's tortured genius with his film Bird. In 1984, the Alvin Ailey Dance Company celebrated Parker with For \"Bird\" With Love. Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat honored Parker with many artworks including Charles the First. In 2015, an opera based on his life Charlie Parker's YARDBIRD made its debut at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia. Parker's vast influence continues today with hip-hop artists and other kindred musical spirits sampling his music, confirming that BIRD LIVES!"
