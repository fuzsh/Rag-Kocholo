        "text": "Son of [father unknown] and [mother unknown]\n\n[sibling(s) unknown]\n\nProfile last modified 15 Apr 2024 | Created 22 Nov 2015\n\nThis page has been accessed 1,695 times.\n\nBiography\n\nCharles Parker Jr. is Notable.\n\nCharlie Parker Jr. was a legendary Grammy Award–winning jazz saxophonist who, with Dizzy Gillespie, invented the musical style called bop or bebop.[1]\n\nHe was born in Kansas City, Kansas, on August 29, 1920,[2] the only child of Charles Parker Sr. and Addie Bailey. His father was an African-American stage entertainer, and his mother was a maid-charwoman of Native-American heritage. Charlie moved with his parents to Kansas City, Missouri when he was seven years old. At the time, the city was a lively center for African-American music, including jazz, blues and gospel.\n\nParker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and improvisation. Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Parker acquired the nickname \"Yardbird\" early in his career. This and its shortened form, \"Bird\" continued to be used for the rest of his life, inspiring the titles of a number of Parker compositions, such as \"Yardbird Suite\", \"Ornithology\", \"Bird Gets the Worm\", and \"Bird of Paradise.\" Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual rather than just an entertainer.\n\nIn 1936, he married his childhood sweetheart, Rebecca Ruffin.[3]\n\nHe died on March 12, 1955, in New York City[4] and is buried in Lincoln Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri.[5]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Charlie Parker at Wikipedia\n\n↑ Military: \"U.S., World War II Draft Cards Young Men, 1940-1947\"\n\nNational Archives at St. Louis; St. Louis, Missouri; WWII Draft Registration Cards for New York City, 10/16/1940 - 03/31/1947; Record Group: Records of the Selective Service System, 147\n\nAncestry Sharing Link - Ancestry Record 2238 #195284295\n\nName: Charles Parker; Gender: Male; Race: Negro (Black); Age: 21; Birth Date: 29 Aug 1920; Birth Place: Kansas City, Kansas; Registration Date: 16 Feb 1942; Registration Place: New York City, New York; Employer: J McShann; Height: 5 6; Weight: 176; Complexion: Dark brown; Hair Color: Brown; Eye Color: Brown; Next of Kin: Rebecca Wife.\n\n↑ Marriage: \"Missouri, U.S., Marriage Records, 1805-2002\"\n\nMissouri State Archives; Jefferson City, MO, USA; Missouri Marriage Records [Microfilm]\n\nAncestry Sharing Link - Ancestry Record 1171 #2127163\n\nCharles Parker Jr (20) marriage to Rebecca Ruffin on 25 Jul 1936 in Jackson, Missouri, USA.\n\n↑ Death: \"New York, New York, U.S., Death Index, 1949-1965\"\n\nNew York City Department of Health, courtesy of www.vitalsearch-worldwide.com.
