        "text": "All free performances will be open to the public, first come, first served, and subject to venue capacity limits.\n\nIn response to the increasing spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, all guests of the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival SummerStage events at Marcus Garvey Park on August 27, 28 and 29, will be required to show either proof of full COVID-19 vaccination (final dose by August 14) or a negative PCR test within the last 72 hours in order to enter.\n\nLearn more about acceptable documentation, mask guidelines, and other safety protocols here.\n\nThis performance will be livestreamed on CharlieParkerJazzFestival.org.\n\n—\n\nThough his legacy would come to be defined by his indelible contributions to bebop, the Charlie Parker with Strings albums were Charlie Parker’s best-selling recordings during his lifetime, featuring the legendary saxophonist’s takes on standards like Gershwin’s “Summertime” and Klenner & Lewis’ “Just Friends.” They’re performed here by the Donald Harrison Quartet and the Harlem Symphony Orchestra. Harrison, a New Orleans-born alto saxophonist (and former member of Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers), is leading this ensemble in honor of Parker, while the strings come courtesy of the HSO, comprising graduates of the country’s top conservatories and music schools, such as The Julliard School, New England Conservatory, Manhattan School of Music, Eastman School of Music, and Indiana University. Harrison, and company will also debut two new works in styles of music he created. The new works will showcase his signature Nouveau Swing and Quantum jazz styles which are both heavily influenced by Charlie Parker. The show will kick off with a festival-debut performance by Shenel Johns, a dynamic jazz songstress who has performed at venues like Museum of Modern Art, Dizzy’s Club, Minton’s Playhouse, Blue Note Jazz Club and alongside the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis."
