        "text": "The Apollo Theater presents the New York premiere of Charlie Parkerâ€™s Yardbird April 1, an opera that recounts his life and music. Performances play through April 3.\n\nParker, who was recently inducted into the Apollo's walk of fame, has a special history with the Harlem theatre; it is where he developed the bebop style and conducted a handful of bold musical experiments. One of such performances produced the 1950 album Charlie Parker with Strings, a recording meant to bridge the gap between jazz and classical music.\n\nComposed by Daniel Schnyder with librettist Bridgette Wimberly, Charlie Parker's Yardbird stars Lawrence Brownlee in the title role. The Apollo production is being co-produced with Opera Philadelphia, which staged the sold-out world premiere last June. The New York debut reunites Brownlee with much of the original cast alongside maestro Corrado Rovaris and the Opera Philadelphia Orchestra. The company will again be joined by stage director Ron Daniels.\n\nSet in the famed Birdland Jazz Club on March 12, 1955, the day Parker died, the opera offers a rare and intimate look into the soul of the great saxophonist as he composes his final masterpiece."
