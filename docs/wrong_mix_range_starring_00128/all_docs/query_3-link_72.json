        "text": "Still funny! Jonah Hill, Emma Stone and more Superbad stars have continued with their thriving careers since the comedy filmâs 2007 premiere.\n\nThe coming-of-age movie, written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, was based on the duoâs experience growing up in Vancouver, Canada. The onscreen besties â played by Hill and Michael Cera â embarked on a series of hilarious escapades that involved partying, romance and more teen tropes.\n\nThe creative team behind the film initially feared the content would be too much for some viewers. âI thought that when we showed Superbad to audiences, we would start an ongoing debate about how dirty should the movie be,â producer Judd Apatow told Entertainment Weekly in August 2007. âAnd at the very first screening, nobody in the audience had any issue with anything in the movie in the numbers that would make you change it. I couldnât believe it. I thought we would be debating so many set pieces and language and cutting things. And there was nothing.â\n\nHill recalled that he and Cera âwerenât allowed to go to the first test screening in case something went horribly wrong.â The Moneyball star added: âI remember the second everyone called me and emailed me at the same time. Judd sent me a few emails, one being like, âItâs crazy, itâs awesome. Everyone loved it.ââ\n\nThe actors were encouraged to improvise on the set â after much preparation. âWe did rehearsals for a month beforehand where weâd hang out at Sethâs house and we did a bunch of table reads,â Cera explained. âI felt like I knew it really well, and we were so comfortable around each other.â\n\nHill, for his part, leaned into the opportunity despite the pressure. âI think a lot of it is being so scared not to do it, you just do it,â he said. âIf someone put you in that position and thereâs cameras around and you didnât do it, youâd feel so sâtty.â\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nIn sharing more behind-the-scenes secrets years later, Apatow credited the film for Stoneâs iconic red hair color, which she has sported various shades of over the years. âThere was a concern that [Stone] had the same color hair as Martha MacIsaacâs,â he revealed to Vanity Fair in August 2022. âAnd I said, âWell, maybe it could be like red or something.â So we dyed her hair red, which I think she had never done before. And since then, she has cursed me because now people love her with red hair and sheâs had to live with that for a lot of her adult life.â\n\nScroll through the gallery below to find out what the cast of Superbad has been up to since the movieâs release (hint: theyâre killing it after all these years)!\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowrGx0ZuYnWWTlsC1edahnKudXZa%2FpnnToZyyZZ6kxHA%3D"
