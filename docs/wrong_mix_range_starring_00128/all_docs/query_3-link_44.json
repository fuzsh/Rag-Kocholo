        "text": "Since his early days acting in Superbad and a bunch of other Judd Apatow films, Jonah has gone on to be a more ~serious~ actor. He even earned an Oscar nom for his crazy AF role in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"Do you know how many foods are shaped like dicks?! The BEST kinds!\"\n\nEveryone's favorite soft-spoken Canadian star pretty much hasn't stopped working since Superbad. His next big role is Robin in The Lego Batman Movie, which hits theaters next month.\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"One name? ONE NAME?! Who are you...Seal?\"\n\nSuperbad was Christopher's very first professional acting role and many people at the time argued that ~McLovin~ actually stole the show. I mean, we still think of him as McLovin, so...\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"Old enough...to party.\"\n\nMany years before winning the role of a lifetime...twice (that role being Ryan Gosling's onscreen lady love), Emma made her feature film debut in Superbad. Emma has since earned an Oscar nom for her role in Birdman and she's also been winning a shit-ton of awards recently for her part in La La Land. NBD.\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"My older brother says the nastiest shit, like, he called me 'hymen' until I was 12.\"\n\nPost-Superbad Martha has acted in A LOT of TV shows. Most recently she voiced characters for Family Guy. Martha will reunite onscreen with her Superbad pal Emma Stone in the upcoming tennis biopic Battle of the Sexes.\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"Could you get me a bottle of Goldslick vodka?\"\n\nObviously, you probably best know Bill from his SNL days. Since then, he's been involved with about a bajillion TV and film projects from Documentary Now! to Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He next displays his talents in the upcoming Power Rangers reboot in March.\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"I'm really sorry that I blocked your cock.\"\n\nSuperbad was Seth Rogen's first feature film writing credit and since then he's gone on to write and star in a number of other huge comedy hits like Pineapple Express, This Is the End, and Sausage Party. He'll reteam with pal James Franco in the upcoming Zeroville.\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"So, we have an African Jew wearing a hoodie...\"\n\nErica is another Judd Apatow regular having also acted in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Step Brothers, and This Is 40. She most recently had a part in Veep, too!\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"I said he looked like you...do you look like an African Jew?!\"\n\n'90s kids will probably remember Joe from MTV's The State. Everyone else will probably know him from Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Both are awesome, so that's okay. Joe's next feature reunites him with fellow The State alum David Wain for A Futile and Stupid Gesture.\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: \"I'm gonna be totally honest with you...I have a warrant out for a totally nonviolent crime. Okay? There.\"\n\nBefore he stepped out of his big brother's shadows, Dave had small parts in Superbad and Charlie St. Cloud. Now, he's all over the place with starring roles in the 21 Jump Street and Now You See Me franchises. Dave has a crap-ton of other film projects lined up, too, including The Lego Ninjago Movie.\n\nSuper awesome Superbad line: (Seth: \"Hey Greg, why don't you go piss your pants again?\") \"That was, like, eight years ago, asshole.\""
