        "text": "Superbad is out in the UK this week and I recently spoke to the three lead actors in the film: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.\n\nI spoke about the comedy in the film, the rise of producer Judd Apatow, what ‘McLovin’ is, how this is different from other teen movies and a good deal of other stuff too.\n\nOne of the funniest comedies to come out this year it follows three high school geeks as they struggle to buy booze for a party at which they hope to get laid. But after one of them comes up with a bad fake ID their evening spirals out of control.\n\nSeth Rogen (who you may have seen in Knocked Up earlier this summer) stars in a supporting role as a cop and he also co-wrote the script with Evan Goldberg. Judd Apatow produces whilst Greg Mottola directs.\n\nListen to the interview here:\n\n[audio:https://www.filmdetail.com/podcast/get.php?fla=podcast-2007-09-14-26432.mp3]\n\nTo subscribe to the Interview Podcast via iTunes just click the image below:\n\nSuperbad is out now at UK cinemas"
