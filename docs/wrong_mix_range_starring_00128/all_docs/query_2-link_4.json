They go on the run, accidentally ending up in a local film studio where they get mistaken for extras and soon become involved in a succession of comic misadventures.\n\nReg Varney as Wilfred Stone\n\nNorman Rossington as Jack Foster\n\nSue Lloyd as Angel Montgomery\n\nDennis Price as Dracula, actor\n\nJulie Ege as April\n\nPatrick Newell as Generous Jim\n\nDavid Lodge as Graham\n\nAnouska Hempel as Suzi Eckmann\n\nAubrey Morris as director\n\nBill Fraser as TV studio doorman\n\nBob Todd as security man\n\nJack Haig as security man\n\nMelvyn Hayes as ambulance man\n\nJohn Clive as hotel waiter\n\nJohnny Briggs as assistant director\n\nJohn Levene as assistant director\n\nDavid Prowse as actor\n\nPenny Meredith as harem girl\n\nDebbie Russ as Tiger (reprising her role from the TV series Here Come the Double Deckers)\n\nPeter Stephens as director\n\nThe film was shot on location in central London and Slough,[4] and at Pinewood Studios (as \"Starwood Studios\") with sets designed by the art director Lionel Couch.\n\nThe film features the song \"Let's Go to the Movies\", by Glen Mason and Keith Miller.\n\nThe film was a box-office disappointment.[5]\n\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Beginning comparatively painlessly with a hectic car chase and one or two promising scenes at 'Starwood Studios', the latest Harry Booth comedy eventually settles down to a tedious mixture of masochism and drag, with most of the emphasis on the former. Reg Varney's cockney stoicism is not completely without charm, but the script's gags seem to consist almost entirely of a succession of violent incidents in which, for example, he has a periscope stuck up his behind or is crippled by an explosion. There is barely any attempt to generate humour from anything except pain, and even the occasional departures from this basic approach are mechanical and witless. Still, in the present state of the industry, one cannot help admiring the brazen wish-fulfilment in the film's portrayal of a thinly disguised well-known British studio, which appears to be shooting at least twelve features simultaneously.\"[6]\n\nLeslie Halliwell called the film \"Painful British farce\".[7]\n\nThe Radio Times Guide to Films gave the film 1/5 stars, writing: \"This British comedy has minimal laughs. Reg Varney and Norman Rossington are waiters on the run from debt collectors who take refuge in a film studio, a scenario which leads to some amazingly unfunny sequences . It's enough to make the Carry On films seem as witty as Oscar Wilde.\"[8]"
