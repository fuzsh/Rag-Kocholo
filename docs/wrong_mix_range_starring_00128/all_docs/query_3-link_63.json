        "text": "Continuing with the proud American tradition of the crude high school comedy is Superbad, which was co-written by Seth Rogen and produced by Judd Apatow, who were also apart of the highly successful Knocked Up, as star and writer/director respectively.\n\nThis film stars Michael Cera and Jonah Hill as Evan and Seth, two lifelong, porn obsessed friends who are due to attend different colleges at the end of the year. Not wanting to graduate as virgins, they make it their mission to get laid before the end of the year.\n\nWhen an opportunity arises in the form of a house party, Evan and Seth let it be known that they will supply the alcohol â via their geeky friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who has obtained a fake ID with the moniker âMcLovinâ â in the hopes that said gesture will secure them a night of drunken debauchery. Yet getting to the party becomes a struggle, as the boys must contend with forces on opposite sides of the law.\n\nSuperbad reminds somewhat of Richard Linklaterâs seminal 1993 teen classic Dazed and Confused, since both films focus on the adventures of a group of teenagers on a quest to get drunk and laid. However, a major difference between the two is that this film can be extremely immature, due to some pretty vulgar language, a number of gross out scenarios, and an unhealthy obsession with dicks and fellatio.\n\nYet Superbad is also a surprisingly sweet film about male friendship and comradeship as two lifelong friends are drawn into different directions.\n\nSaid friends are played very well by Cera and Hill, Cera especially nailing his awkward shtick down pat. However, the films best moments belong to Christopher Mintz-Plasse and his dealings with a pair of crazy police officers played hilariously by Bill Hader and Seth Rogen.\n\nGoing back to the Dazed and Confused comparison; it is interesting to compare the lives of teenagers on a generational level. Yet the conclusions reached from these comparisons are quite sad."
