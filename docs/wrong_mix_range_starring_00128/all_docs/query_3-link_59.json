        "text": "Everett Collection\n\n\"I am McLovin.\" It's been 10 years since those iconic words were first uttered onscreen by Christopher Mintz-Plasse in \"Superbad.\"\n\n\"Superbad\" centered on a night of debauchery for two high school seniors. Silly yet witty, the film is filled with one liners and hilarious scenes that have made it a comedy classic.\n\nWith its debut, \"Superbad\" brought the careers of Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, and Emma Stone to the next level. In honor of the big anniversary, let's take a look at some super great movies these actors have made in the last 10 years:\n\nMichael Cera\n\n2007: Juno\n\nCera won hearts as the sensitive boyfriend who helped Ellen Page navigate her pregnancy in this teen flick. It was the highest grossing film of all of the best picture Oscar nominees in 2008.\n\n2008: Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\n\nIn this teen rom-com, Cera sweeps Kat Dennings off her feet with an epic night in New York city, writing songs and singing in the rain. Not surprisingly, the soundtrack is killer.\n\n2010: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\n\nCera has to defeat his love interest's exes in extreme ways in this comic book adaptation. The actors who played in Cera's band \"Sex Bob'Omb\" in the movie rehearsed extensively before the shoot to look legit.\n\n2013: Arrested Development\n\nCera reprised the role of George Michael Bluth on the reboot of this beloved sitcom about a very dysfunctional family. The show's fourth season became one of the first original Netflix productions to be nominated for an Emmy. There's another season on the way.\n\n2015: Sausage Party\n\nCera voiced anxiety ridden hot dog Barry in this dirty cartoon spoof on the world of supermarket foods. It beat out \"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\" to become the highest grossing R rated cartoon of all time.\n\n2017: The Lego Batman Movie\n\nCera played a very enthusiastic Robin to Will Arnett's brooding Batman in this Lego adventure. Will Arnett and Michael Cera also starred in \"Arrested Development\" together.\n\nJonah Hill\n\n2010: Get Him to the Greek\n\nHill played a straight shooter chasing Russell Brand's wild rockstar around the world in this popular comedy. The film is a spinoff to the 2008 comedy \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\"\n\n2011: Moneyball\n\nHill and Brad Pitt star in this true story of partners revamping the Oakland A's roster and budget in the 90s. Shifting from his usual comedic fare, Hill got his first Oscar nomination for the role.\n\n2012: 21 Jump Street\n\nHill starred alongside Channing Tatum as a pair of slacker cops who are sent on assignment to a high school. The first movie did so well that a sequel, \"22 Jump Street,\" came out in 2014.\n\n2013: The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nHill partied up a storm with Leonardo Dicaprio in this biopic about the scandalous life of Wall Street banker Jordan Belfort. The actors snorted crushed Vitamin B tablets for scenes that involved cocaine. Hill claimed that he got bronchitis from the inhalation.\n\n2015: War Dogs\n\nHill and Miles Teller brought to life the true story of two men who were given a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to provide weapons to American allies in Afghanistan. Hill put on a large amount of weight for the role.\n\nSeth Rogen\n\n2008: Pineapple Express\n\nRogen and James Franco play a man and his marijuana dealer who wind up on the run from a gang of criminals. Rogen and Franco starred for the first time together in the TV series \"Freaks and Geeks\" in 1999 and went on to do several other projects together after \"Pineapple Express.\"\n\n2008: Zack and Miri Make a Porno\n\nRogen and Elizabeth Banks star as two friends who decide to make a cheap porno to get some extra cash, only to fall in love in the process. A portion of the plot is based on director Kevin Smith's experience filming \"Clerks,\" which was done on a low budget like the characters have in the film.\n\n2013: This Is The End\n\nRogen starred alongside many of his comedy pals including Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and James Franco in this spoof on apocalyptic movies. According to Rogen, 50% of the movie was ad-libbed.\n\n2014: Neighbors\n\nIn this unique take on college movies, family man Seth Rogen fights the unruly fraternity next door, which is run by Zac Efron. The film became the 4th largest R rated comedy of all time and spawned a successful sequel, \"Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.\"\n\n2015: Steve Jobs\n\nStepping outside of the comedy realm, Rogen starred as tech pioneer Steve Wozniak in this Steve Jobs biopic. Rogen met extensively with the original Steve Wozniak to depict him in an accurate way.\n\nEmma Stone\n\n2009: Zombieland\n\nStone joins Jesse Eisenberg on his quest to survive a post-zombie infestation America in this twisted comedy. Evan Rachel Wood and Megan Fox reportedly turned down Stone's role of Wichita.\n\n2011: Easy A\n\nIn her first big screen starring role, Stone plays a clean cut high school student who plays the gossip game to enhance her social standing. The movie's plot is loosely based off of the famous book \"The Scarlet Letter.\"\n\n2012: The Amazing Spider-Man\n\nStone played Gwen Stacey to Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man in this update of the superhero classic. The twosome had such great chemistry that they wound up dating for 3 years after filming.\n\n2014: Birdman\n\nThough she had shown her acting chops before, Stone truly gained the attention of critics with her role as Sam, the tortured daughter of Michael Keaton's Birdman. She earned her first Oscar nomination for the film."
