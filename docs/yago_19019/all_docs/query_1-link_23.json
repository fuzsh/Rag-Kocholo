        "text": "Abstract: A few years ago, when the Russian writer and lecturer-provocateur Tat'iana Tolstaia was endorsing the \"truth\" of Francine du Plessix Gray's book on Soviet women, she penned this grim portrait of Western feminists rapping on the collective door of Soviet women and grilling them in the \"cold, rigid manner\" of bug inspectors: \"How do your men oppress you? Why don't they wash the dishes? Why don't they prepare the meals? Why don't they allow women into politics? Why don't women rebel against the phallocracy?\"(1) As comforting as it might be to dismiss this image as typical Tolstoyan reductionism, a less extreme version of it recurs in the commentary of Ol'ga Lipovskaia, the editor/publisher of the journal Zhenskoe chtenie (Women's reading). Lipovskaia remarks on Western feminists' bewildered, sometimes alienating contacts with Soviet women -- the \"real confusion of purposes and activities\" manifest in various official meetings between the two groups, Western women's one-track insistence on the value of their own agendas, the problem with effectively translating the most basic Western terms like \"feminism,\" \"emancipation,\" and \"gender\" for a slogan-weary Soviet audience.(2) In much the same way, this powerful opposition conditioned Soviet women's very different approach to another Western target -- the objectification and commodification of women. Over the years the state promoted political icons of Soviet womanhood (the good mother, the heroic shockworker) that invoked carefully maternal and/or maidenly chaste constructions of femininity; these icons implicitly defined and critiqued \"bourgeois\" constructions that cultivated a fashionable beauty or sexual desirability. At the same time, the state's material neglect of the domestic sphere also limited the production of specialized goods and services for women, including fashion and beauty products. These kinds of goods were obtainable mainly through illegal means and Party connections; they were coveted as emblems of unusual status, even subversive display. To a certain extent, therefore, Soviet women construed the image of the commodified woman as a goal rather than a target, an image valorized by both political censure and material lack. Of course, the commodification of Soviet women did reproduce the degradation and exploitation more explicit in its Western forms; Soviet women were as susceptible as any other group to a manipulative \"beauty myth.\" Yet in the absence of a capitalist market their extreme preoccupation with \"looking feminine\" (read bourgeois feminine) and obtaining hard-to-get makeup and stylish clothes also signified a personalized triumph over state-imposed norms and consumer priorities. Among her peers, the Soviet woman who managed a bourgeois feminine image without bourgeois advantages (in her context, Party ties) was admirable and enviable for her pragmatic ingenuity -- her savvy and daring in manipulating various \"private\" and even illegal connections. As Elizabeth Waters remarks in an article on Soviet beauty contests, such attitudes very likely help fuel the current enthusiasm for beauty pageants and the seemingly unruffled public response to the new capitalist exploitation of women.(15) She notes the \"political statement encoded\" in these contests and ascribes their visibility to \"the long-frustrated desire for Western style, the sudden emergence of the market, and the freedom granted by glasnost to break old taboos, to explore femininity and sexuality.\" At least in this transitional period, the market value recently tagged on women's beauty and sexual desirability still resonates with an unofficial desire, a past quest in which women did not simply consume a prescribed ideal, but exercised their own creativity and constructed their own \"unofficial\" (if still convention-bound) self-image."
