        "text": "Citation preview\n\nLITERATURE OF THE HOLOCAUST edited by ALAN ROSEN\n\nLITERATURE OF THE HOLOCAUST\n\nDuring and in the aftermath of the dark period of the Holocaust, writers across Europe and the United States sought to express their feelings and experiences through their writings. This book provides a comprehensive account of these writings through essays from expert scholars, covering a wide geographic, linguistic, thematic, and generic range of materials. Such an overview is particularly appropriate at a time when the corpus of Holocaust literature has grown to immense proportions and when guidance is needed in determining a canon of essential readings, a context to interpret them, and a paradigm for the evolution of writing on the Holocaust. The expert contributors to this volume, who negotiate the literature in the original languages, provide insight into the inﬂuence of national traditions and the importance of language, especially but not exclusively Yiddish and Hebrew, to the literary response arising from the Holocaust. alan rosen is most recently the author of The Wonder of Their Voices: The 1946 Holocaust Interviews of David Boder (2010) and the Sounds of Deﬁance: The Holocaust, Multilingualism, and the Problem of English (2005), editor of Approaches to Teaching Wiesel’s Night (2007), and co-editor of Elie Wiesel: Jewish, Moral, and Literary Perspectives (2013). He lectures regularly on Holocaust literature at Yad Vashem’s International School for Holocaust Studies and other Holocaust study centers. His current book project is entitled “Killing Time, Saving Time: Calendars and the Holocaust.” Born and raised in Los Angeles, educated in Boston under the direction of Elie Wiesel, he lives in Jerusalem with his wife and four children.\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

This collective endeavor has beneﬁted from the advice and labor of many, including Robert Gordon, Yisrael Cohen, Sheila Jelen, Nehemia Polen, Martin Farren, Beate Müller, Simone Gigliotti, David Patterson, Florent Brayard, David Roskies, and Elie Wiesel. My wife, Ruth, again shared her exceptional scholarly and editorial skills. My orientation toward Holocaust literature is indebted to many as well. A class with Maurice Natanson was revelatory; conversations with Raul Hilberg and Emil Fackenheim pivotal; with Terrence Des Pres inspiring; with Irving Halperin nurturing. My conversations over the years with important writers have been indispensable; I thank all, and mention especially Aharon Appelfeld, Ilona Karmel, Cynthia Ozick, and Elie Wiesel. In addition to the volume’s contributors, I am similarly indebted to decades of conversations with literary scholars of the Holocaust, including Alvin Rosenfeld, Lawrence Langer, Geoffrey Hartman, and Sidra Ezrahi. My debts to students are equally great and ongoing: at Boston University, Bar-Ilan University, the International School for Holocaust Education, Yad Vashem, as well as at the sites of many guest lectures and seminars in Israel, Europe, and North America. All the volume’s contributors have worked intensively and shared generously, and I am grateful to them for their efforts and for what I have learned from them. I thank the staff of the Yad Vashem library, always essential companions to this my scholarship. The library’s director, Dr. Rob Rozett, actively promotes a nurturing atmosphere. Linda Bree, Maartje Scheltens, and the other Cambridge University Press staff have been thoughtful, resourceful, and sensitive to the special demands of this subject. alan rosen tammuz, 5772/july 2012 xii\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Premised on the laws of light and optics, this opening sentence sets forth the novel’s memorial mandate: to bring before the reader’s (and narrator’s?) eyes the light that continues to radiate from the Holocaust’s no longer living victims.1 But stars have also held a special attraction for Holocaust literature because of the insignia, the Star of David, that Jews were forced to wear in order to set them apart from the general population. “Today two harsh decrees reached us. First, the Star of David decree,” writes Warsaw diarist Chaim Kaplan on November 30, 1939. Like many, Kaplan turned the decree inside out: with the prospect of the ‘Star of David’ insignia soon to be afﬁxed not only to clothing but to Jewish businesses, he conjectures that “everywhere we turn we shall feel as if we were in a Jewish kingdom.” Strikingly, Kaplan concludes the star-burdened entry by pondering the role of the Jewish poet in a time of catastrophe: “A poet who clothes adversity in poetic form immortalizes it in an ever lasting monument.”2 The Cambridge Literature of the Holocaust aims to pick up where Kaplan’s meditation left off, surveying how, during the war and in its aftermath, writers – some of whom were gifted poets, some journeyman diarists like Kaplan, and some merely children – clothed the ever-intensifying adversity in a stunning variety of literary forms. The “adversity” – what we now call the Holocaust (or, in its Hebrew counterpart, the Shoah), the notorious attempt by Nazi Germany to destroy European Jewry – grew in its proportions as the months and years went on. Accelerated persecution of Jews began in Germany in 1933, encompassed Austria and Czechoslovakia in the late 1930s, and then, with the German invasion of Poland in September, 1939, expanded to Eastern Europe and, progressively, to all areas of Europe that came under German occupation. 1\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

But they most always were accompanied by brutality and privation, and, in time, by exclusion (utilizing the Star of David insignia), plunder, deportation, and murder. Arenas of terror invented to carry out this program came to dot the European landscape. First established in Germany in 1933, concentration camps dealt ruthlessly with many types of prisoners; Jews eventually came to form a major constituency. Once the war began in 1939, ghettos, which eventually numbered close to a thousand, soon were established to isolate the Jews of Eastern and Central Europe. Special work battalions and camps exploited the labor of the prisoners, whom Benjamin Ferencz called “less than slaves.” When, in 1941, Germany broke its treaty with the Soviet Union and invaded its former ally, it accompanied its invasion with mass executions of Russian, Ukrainian, and Baltic Jewries. Finally, the death camps operating in German-occupied Poland from late 1941 until 1945 were designed to murder large transports of Jews upon arrival. The transports from ghettos or communities to these camps were carried out mainly in cattle-cars under crowded and primitive conditions. The decimation of European Jewry unfolded largely parallel to the events of World War II. But, in contrast to the ugly hostilities waged between that war’s armed combatants, the Holocaust targeted civilians – Jewish men, women, and children – for enslavement, humiliation, and murder. This sad chronicle provides the setting, backdrop, and coordinates for much, if not all, of Holocaust literature. History has played a dominant role in establishing the Holocaust’s factual and interpretive coordinates. This volume chronicles not the history of the Holocaust, but rather the wartime and postwar response in literature to the victims’ plight. Some of this literature was written by victims who eventually perished, some by the minority of victims who gratefully survived, and some either by contemporaries who, in Israel, England, the Americas, or elsewhere were not on the scene, or who were born after the events took place. As this collection hopes to show, literature too has made its special contribution. A few words may be in order to suggest, even in a limited and foreshortened way, the speciﬁc vocation of literature in regard to the Holocaust. If history has sought objectivity, a dispassionate assemblage of the facts of when, where, and how the events unfolded, literature has been shamelessly subjective, offering ardently personal perspectives on what transpired. Emotion was not to be avoided, but rather intensiﬁed. In a related sense, if history has generally concerned itself with the macro level – the group, the institution, the movement – literature has focused on the individual. It is via the individual that empathy comes to the fore. The\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

History is measured by the transparency of its language, the degree to which the reader follows the chronicle of events without noticing the language in which they are rendered. Historian Saul Friedlander’s The Years of Extermination, for example, provides a window on the events of this era, at its best when the window itself goes unnoticed. In contrast, literature aims to make the language conspicuous, to thicken it, as it were, and by doing so to make the reader aware of the means used to create the effect. At times ﬁgurative language – image, symbol, metaphor (“dead stars,” for example) – achieves this end. At other times, tone or voice, sarcasm or indignation, guide the reading: “A Jewish policeman? Oh, I can’t believe my eyes!” writes Peretz Opoczynski from the Warsaw ghetto in late 1941, addressing his fellow ghetto residents with, as David Roskies reminds us, a distinctly blended intonation borrowed from Yiddish storytelling at its ﬁnest.3 History would rarely choose such a register to chronicle the ghetto’s immense deprivation. Or again, it is the prerogative of language to double back on itself. So Paul Celan’s eerily famous lines, “Black milk at daybreak we drink it at evening / we drink it at midday and morning we drink it at night / we drink and we drink,” pivot around a compulsive act of drinking, senseless except in the quiet violence of the reiterated act. Prose does this as well, with its own capacity to meditate on language’s tested powers in the midst of carnage. Hungarian survivor Elie Wiesel reports on a scene of selection at Auschwitz: Every few yards, there stood an SS man, his machine gun trained on us. Hand in hand we followed the throng. An SS came toward us wielding a club. He commanded: “Men to the left! Women to the right!”\n\nUp until this point, the memoir, like many before and many after, depicts the anguished moment of arrival in which families were torn apart. But then the author brings to the fore the role language plays: Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight simple, short words. Yet that was the moment when I left my mother.4\n\nGuns, clubs, commands: the tools of the enemy may wreak death and destruction on the remnants of Hungarian Jewry, but in Wiesel’s revisiting of this scene, an astonishingly few words cause the greatest damage. The enemy’s unexceptional words do not fade away. They are retrieved out of the past and put on display, so that the reader may appreciate their explosive force. The window thus clouds over, the words take on a heavy substance of\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Indeed, the fruitful interplay between the two can be noted by the fact that the mission statement for the Warsaw ghetto chroniclers, including diarists and reportage, was set forth by a historian, Emanuel Ringelblum – who was himself guided by a previous generation’s determination to have individual Jews record the facts. As Ringelblum recognized and advocated, for the victim to unﬂinchingly record the facts in the appalling ﬂux of ghetto life and death took a rare form of literary resolve. History enters here through another door as well, since the history of Holocaust literature ﬁgures prominently in this collection. The volume’s ﬁrst two essays, by David Roskies and David Patterson respectively, inaugurate this approach, making wartime writing a point of departure. Such a strategy might seem obvious. Yet it is not uncommon for surveys or critical studies of Holocaust literature to presume that the war years gave rise to little of any literary substance; from this vantage point, the real career of Holocaust literature took off in the postwar years, in the form of the memoirs written by former inmates of concentration camps. Indeed, a focus on the camps, the conditions of which allowed for little in the way of actual composition (though see Roskies on the Sonderkommandos and Gilbert on songs), posited the postwar years as a natural beginning for literary reﬂection and the memoir as the genre that set the standard. But the war years actually yielded a bounty of writing in all genres, much of which was lost in the convulsive uprootings of wartime Europe. Yet a portion did survive. To be sure, literature authored in ghettos, in hiding, and under other circumstances of privation may demand its own hermeneutic, one that recognizes the fragmented, groping view of events that could not help but shape these productions. This recognition is stimulated by Roskies’ and Patterson’s inventories of these essential, and often essentially courageous, writings. Most of the volume’s other essays, even while working independently, follow their lead. In some cases, they start from what Leona Toker precisely formulates as “the ﬁrst literary record of the shocked realization of the nature of atrocities.” This realization did not always come directly, nor was the literary record necessarily straightforward. Indeed, oblique entry, what Sheila Jelen shrewdly refers to as “writing around the Holocaust,” was\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

In other cases, the story of literary response to the Holocaust picks up in the early postwar period. Whether wartime or postwar, the starting point has been chosen in order to retrieve earlier responses, many of which have remained obscure. Decade by decade, the essays try to show the often devious route by which a Holocaust literature has unfolded (see, for instance, the contributions of Rita Horváth and Jeffrey Mehlman). This circuitous development obtained especially, but not only, in countries ruled for years by communist governments whose terms of engagement with the Holocaust were such that, as Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska notes, “the meanderings of state censorship created a situation in which certain topics appeared and disappeared.” More generally, Holocaust literature’s terms of engagement have oscillated between two poles. On the one hand, it has angled for comparison, for something familiar, or familiar enough, for the reader who was not on the scene to latch onto, to enable, in Wiesel’s formulation, one who was (fortunately) not there to feel “as if” they had been.6 “I saw a ﬂood once in the mountains,” begins Rachel Auerbach, writing in the wake of the Great Deportation in Warsaw in the summer of 1942. The ﬂood offers an analogy, a metaphor, a basis of comparison; it demonstrates the resolute search for terms. Yet even while stepping outside the actual sphere of the events, it delineates an approach to them: the “I saw” establishes a standard for chronicle, for description, for anguish, for assessment. The ﬂood is not conjured; it is witnessed.7 But not every writer felt analogy even roughly suitable. The diary of the Polish physician Zygmunt Klukowski records a scene of plunder in the aftermath of an October 1942 roundup of Jews; the sense of scandal gathers momentum word by word, sentence by sentence: From the wide-open Jewish apartments people grab everything they can lay their hands on. Shamelessly they carry loads of poor Jewish belongings or merchandise from the shops . . . Altogether the spectacle is unbelievable, hard to describe. Something equally terrifying, horrible, has never been seen or heard about, by anyone, anywhere.\n\nTo chronicle what is said to be without analogy, to be unprecedented and unparalleled – “never been seen or heard about, by anyone, anywhere” – has a riveting force of its own. In this case, the force is intensiﬁed because Dr. Klukowski is describing the violation not (or at least not directly) of people but of possessions. At the center of the debacle are the things that “people grab” and “carry” in a manner that dislodges them from the life of the Jews to whom they belonged.8 If the spectacle of plundering “belongings or\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Holocaust literature oscillates between these poles, seeking analogies in nature (ﬂoods or dead stars) or history (previous catastrophes), while (often at the same time) detailing the failure to ﬁnd them. The chapters that follow survey a variety of literary responses to the Holocaust, subsuming individual writers within the larger patterns of national literatures, language groups, or speciﬁc kinds of writing. Yet this approach is meant to expand the repertoire of names, carving out a larger space for authors who have little notoriety outside of their speciﬁc time and place, together with those whose accomplishments have reached further. Of wartime writers, the only one who remains widely known is Anne Frank, the Dutch teenage diarist who perished in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and whose stature as a writer has become greater in recent years. But other wartime diarists – the above-mentioned Chaim Kaplan, Abraham Lewin, Victor Klemperer, Moshe Flinker – have also had increased exposure, as scholarly and popular awareness of contemporary responses to the plight of wartime Jewry has circulated more widely. Certain postwar writers, survivors all, have pondered the Holocaust for decades on end, experimenting with a range of genres or inventing others to meet their needs. Elie Wiesel’s Yiddish memoir of his Hungarian family’s deportation in 1944, ﬁrst published in 1956, details the illusion of well-being that dogged his community even after most of European Jewry had been murdered. But it focuses on the nurturing relationship developed by father and son as they together try to endure the rigors of Auschwitz, a winter death march to Germany, and the radical privations of Buchenwald. Relocating to the United States, he chose French as his main literary language and produced over the next decades essays, novels, memoirs, and plays, most of which have dealt with the survivor’s struggle in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Eventually, the struggle of the children of survivors has come to share center stage with that of the survivors. To foster an apt commemorative idiom, Wiesel has also invented a skeletal form that he refers to as “dialogues.” His writing shares features with the austere universe of the French existentialist writers, but it also draws deeply from the well of Jewish history and tradition, joining the angst of ethical dilemma with the world of Jewish learning, law, and mysticism. Like Wiesel, Primo Levi, an Italian Jewish survivor who wrote about the Holocaust from multiple vantage points over a forty-year period, moved from a devastating memoir of deportation to Auschwitz to the more ﬂexible\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Indeed, both Wiesel and Levi have been drawn to the essay as a supple means to fuse storytelling with ethical inquiry. Abraham Sutzkever penned his own memoir of the Vilna ghetto. But his particular achievement came in lyric poetry, ﬁrst in the ghetto and then, after the war, continuing for some ﬁve decades in the very different surroundings of Tel Aviv. His hundreds of lyrics and prose poems have cultivated an unsentimental imagery and idiom of commemoration. As editor of the journal The Golden Chain, he also played a consummate mentoring role, creating a post-catastrophe venue for sophisticated Yiddish literature, a portion of which was dedicated to the Holocaust. His counterpart on the continent was Paul Celan, who, based from 1948 on in Paris, fashioned German lyric poetry into a rigorous, if elliptical, Holocaust vocabulary. His short prose meditations on the poetic vocation after the Holocaust revealed the deliberation that shaped his dark aesthetic and the Jewish Eastern European sensibility that underlies the verse steeped in contentious allusion to European letters. The demons of clinical depression drove him to suicide at the age of ﬁfty, the merciless complement to a life lived in service to versifying the Holocaust. Jorge Semprun and Charlotte Delbo, non-Jewish resistance ﬁghters deported to Buchenwald and Auschwitz (then Ravensbrück) respectively, crafted innovative memoirs in French and continued in later writings to explore the nature of time, memory, and literature. Born and bred in Spain, Semprun’s multiple postwar recountings of his Buchenwald internment not only stretch literary form but double back on themselves, challenging their perspective and the version of truth it implies. Delbo, for her part, angled between reportage, lyrical prose, and austere drama to commemorate the women with whom she was deported and to search for the pristine words to do so. Rachel Auerbach, Vasily Grossman, Aharon Appelfeld, and Imre Kertész, writers who shaped the Holocaust’s literary idiom in their respective countries and languages, receive attention in the essays that follow; other writers, such as the novelists Margo Minco from Holland and Danilo Kiš from Serbia, do not, which speaks not to their accomplishments but rather to the organizational constraints of a volume such as this. “Blessed is [God],” writes Rabbi Baruch Rabinowitz, a religious leader of the Munkacs community in prewar Hungary, “Who sent His angels to accompany me every single day. Even when little separated me from death, I was saved – and not by natural means.”9 Religious writing constitutes an\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Most literary study of the Holocaust has favored the secular genres, presuming that only when traditional religious belief is absent or aborted can artistry ﬂourish. But just as one would not think of early modern England without the martyrology of John Foxe, the sermons of John Donne, or the lyrics of the metaphysical poets, so did the response of many Jews come via traditional forms of religious writing. Like the English examples, they are no less literary for being so. Some emerged almost straight from the killing ﬁelds. Rabbi Shimon Huberband’s chronicle of the war’s ﬁrst year, written in Warsaw shortly after the events unfolded, serves not only as an elegy to the Jews lost but also as a tribute to the indefatigable effort of Poland’s religious Jews to persevere in their observance of tradition; the somewhat later incantatory report from the pen of Rabbi Moshe Rothenberg takes both elegy and tribute to another level of desperation. The Warsaw ghetto sermons of Rabbi Kalonymous Kalman Shapira, or the crisis-pitched Torah commentary of Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman and Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Ehrenreich, display the disciplined vehicle of religious preaching up against unfathomable cruelty. Postwar religious responses – memoirs, poems, letters, essays, tales, and stories – have been equally dedicated to ﬁnding an idiom steeped in faith while sufﬁciently able to inventory the often inexhaustible list of losses. These traditional responses do not shy away from extracting from the welter of destruction meaningful lessons and from viewing the victims through the prism of sacriﬁce, martyrdom, and a call for divine vengeance. Indeed, the most basic unit of all Holocaust literary commemoration may be the synagogue memorial plaques formulaically listing the names of murdered family members, each of which is followed by the Hebrew abbreviation ‫הי \"ד‬, “may God avenge his (or her) blood.” Above all, this literature, cataloging atrocity and defamation, nonetheless testiﬁes to miraculous interventions at every fateful turn of the road. This rhetoric marches to a different drummer than most of the better-known examples of Holocaust literature. But to ignore it ﬁlters out the articulate sensibility of the devout that has fashioned its response through an ensemble of its own literary media. Yiddish, Hebrew, German, Ladino, Italian, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, and of course, English: the languages in which the story of the Holocaust is told shape the story that emerges. This multilingual premise regarding Holocaust storytelling mirrors the social make-up of prewar Europe; the choice of language among European Jews was never neutral. The lingua franca of most of pre-World War II East and Central European Jewry was\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

It was transported east when Jews were driven out of those Central European lands. Groomed as a vital literary language in the nineteenth century, Yiddish served interwar Jewry as a language of learning, letters, politics, culture, and daily affairs. Yet its primacy in all these realms was challenged (or complemented) by a surge in the popularity of vernacular tongues, and also by the Zionist’s resurrected claims for Hebrew. The story of Ladino runs along a parallel track. Spoken by the Jews of medieval Spain, peppered with Hebrew and Aramaic words, written in its own particular nuance of Hebrew characters, Ladino traveled with ﬁfteenth-century Spain’s expelled Jews to places of refuge in the Balkans, Turkey, Palestine, and North Africa. The language became a portable homeland in these lands of expulsion, binding descendants of refugees together centuries later. Ladino remained the lingua franca in some communities, such as Salonika, in the twentieth century, and, as Judith Roumani recounts, nurtured a legacy of its own literary forms. During the Holocaust, contention over languages intensiﬁed: idealistic calls for a return to Jewish languages competed with realistic defections to the vernacular. Speaking a ﬂawless German, Polish, or Ukrainian could help one escape the persecutor’s net. In the main arenas of terror, Jews forged their own tongues: coded communication in the ghetto, a fabricated jargon in the camps. For some, the choice of a language to write in was a choice of a universe of meaning. So Moshe Flinker, hiding with his sizable religious family in Brussels and pining for a future as a diplomat in Israel, penned the bulk of his diary in Hebrew, occasionally turned to his native Dutch, and ﬁlled the back pages with Arabic grammar exercises. In Lodz, another youthful diarist – whose name and fate remain unknown – was less ideologically wed to any speciﬁc tongue but rather shuttled to and fro among four: Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, and English.10 Other writers chose a language of composition – and then felt called upon to choose again, the rapidly changing circumstances compelling them to switch from one language to another. When the Great Deportation of Warsaw Jewry to Treblinka began in summer 1942, diarist Abraham Lewin exchanged Yiddish for Hebrew; poet Yitzhak Katzenelson did the same when penning his elegy to this devastation; and chronicler Rachel Auerbach traded Polish for Yiddish. Such changes attest to facility and diglossia, the ability to maneuver in more than one tongue, and the changing need to do so in the tongue that mattered most. The shift to a different tongue at a decisive\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

In the war’s aftermath, language continued to be marked by these wartime struggles. A certain swath of English-language Holocaust literature comprises, as Lillian Kremer reminds us, “a tapestry of autobiographical writing by refugees and survivors who have abandoned their birth languages.” Some abandoned, yet others, as Jan Schwarz details persuasively, cleaved to what had been intimately owned since their earliest days. Chava Rosenfarb’s weary assessment catches the postwar tone unnervingly well: “If writing is a lonely profession, the Yiddish writer’s loneliness has an additional dimension. His readership has perished. His language has gone up with the smoke of the crematoria.”11 But not entirely. Rosenfarb, Sutzkever, and other Eastern European Jews refused to heed the writing on the wall and continued to ply their lonely trade in Yiddish, widening its tonality to try to accommodate even the Holocaust’s vast losses. Others refused in a different fashion, as Stuart Taberner sketches in relation to postwar German literature, to let the enemy set the linguistic terms. So Paul Celan, carrying from his native Czernowitz a quiver of languages, chiseled his ever-diminishing poems in German, not granting the perpetrators the possibility of forcing him to abandon his mother tongue but rather crafting it to sing in a voice precisely counter to theirs. Still others opted for an adopted tongue, either to establish a buffer between the war’s devastating events and their recollection of them, or to recruit a speciﬁc tongue to better probe the Holocaust’s overwhelming legacy – or both. Thus, Elie Wiesel has said that French provided him with a “refuge” – but he also believed it offered the challenge of addressing the Holocaust, the most irrational event, in French, the most rational of languages, the heir of Cartesian philosophy. For Wiesel, the collision of the irrational with the rational sculpted an appropriate idiom of Holocaust witness.12 France itself was only a temporary refuge for Yiddish poet Yitzhak Katzenelson, who in 1944 sought the proper terms to gauge the disappearance of Eastern European Jewry. “Rising over Lithuanian or Polish towns,” he wrote in the ﬁnal canto of his epic poem, The Song of the Murdered Jewish People, “the sun will never ﬁnd / A radiant old Jew at the window reciting Psalms.”13 The light of dead stars and the unrequited rays of an ever-seeking sun are necessarily the lamps by which we read Holocaust literature. The volume’s essays endeavor to guide us both in what to read and how to go about doing it.\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Roskies\n\nDiaries Certain genres come to the fore under certain historical circumstances, and diaries, we know, are especially prevalent in wartime. “Everyone” wrote diaries, historian Emanuel Ringelblum reported in 1943, “journalists, writers, teachers, community activists, young people, even children.”1 And although most of those written in the Warsaw ghetto were destroyed during the Great Deportation, a signiﬁcant number did survive: diaries written on the run, in a safe house, a monastery, an underground bunker, a loft, a pit, a labor camp, a transit camp – diaries in every European language. In the Jew-Zone, the ghetto often served as a buffer against the truth: ghetto diarists were preoccupied with themselves or their fellow Jews and barely able to account for the behavior of the Germans. Not so the Hebrew pedagogue Chaim Kaplan, who began keeping a diary in 1933 and renamed it Megilat yisurin (in English, Scroll of Agony) on July 29, 1940, to signal a shift in perspective from the individual to the sacerdotal. Kaplan consistently reports on German actions, and he consistently employs Scripture to underscore the desecration of God’s covenant and the daily degradation of God’s chosen. “How has Warsaw, the royal, beautiful, and beloved city become desolate!” he writes on the ﬁrst day of the Jewish year 5700 (in the Western calendar, September 14, 1939). Biblical analogies eventually fail him, as death itself ceases to have meaning, especially after Kaplan introduces a sinister conﬁdant in the person of Reb Hirsch. “My Hirsch cannot be budged from his opinion,” Kaplan writes on June 16, 1942. “A catastrophe will befall us at the hands of the Nazis and they will wreak their vengeance on us for their ﬁnal downfall,”2 Whether Hirsch was a real person or a literary invention, we will never know. His role, however, is clear: he is Kaplan’s alter ego, his naysayer, the speaker of unspeakable truths. Hirsch’s prophecy of doom, which proves to be accurate (the Great Deportation is a month away), anticipates the diary’s last, truly eschatological sentence, 15\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Roskies\n\nwritten in the diarist’s own voice: “If my life ends, what will become of my diary?” In the Vilna ghetto, the voice of Zelig Kalmanovitsh – as beﬁtted a founder of the famed YIVO Institute – was that of a public intellectual. In Yiddish, he lectured on Peretz and Ahad Ha’am and delivered an occasional sermon. But Kalmanovitsh kept his diary in Hebrew, replete with scriptural and Talmudic passages to underscore his return to the fold. He believed that history would revere the memory of the people of the ghetto. “Your least utterance will be studied,” he prophesied in 1942, “your struggle for man’s dignity will inspire poems, your scum and moral degradation will summon and awaken morality.”3 Most stunning was the voice of Ringelblum, whose every waking hour was dedicated to preserving the inner Jewish dialogue: between past and present, the elite and the folk, Hebrew and Yiddish. Oblivious to the conditions outside his underground bunker, he completed his most sustained piece of historical research, Polish-Jewish Relations During the Second World War, after Polish Jewry was no more. The work was written in Polish for a Poland that no longer had any Jews.\n\nThe art of ghetto reportage Diarists recorded what they experienced, heard, and dreamed. But the reporter’s job was to cover every late-breaking development and draconian measure, on a beat where “images succeeded one another with cinematic speed.”4 The daily assignment was to write about a whole people in extremis, through the prism of the unique social organism that was the ghetto, as if for a deadline sometime in the future, when the war was over, and these writings would see the light of day. In the ghettos in years 1–4, reportage was the bedrock of shared communication. Like song and epic poetry, reportage was not a stand-alone genre designed merely to transcribe or testify or record. It presupposed a collective audience, schooled in a very particular mental curriculum. No subject was too terrible for the reportorial pen, as long as there was room in the horriﬁc present for some reference to a shared past. Reportage was a game of déjà vécu, even if the purpose of the analogy, or allusion, was to underscore the irreparable break between the familiar past and the unbearable present. Peretz Opoczynski was a seasoned reporter before the war, becoming the scribe of urban poverty and neglect in Warsaw. Working as a letter carrier in the Warsaw ghetto by day – an unnerving and thankless job that he described in one of his ﬁnest reportorial ﬁctions – he managed to produce carefully wrought vignettes of ghetto life in the early 1940s by describing a\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Welcomed in 1941 by the ghetto population as the ﬁrst in Poland’s history, the Jewish letter carrier eventually must bear witness to the people’s despair. Yet in the voices that greet and ridicule him at his debut on the ghetto streets, he picks up on something not heard since the days of the greatest of Jewish humorists, Sholem Aleichem: “A Jewish mailman? Oh, I can’t believe my eyes! Tell me, who are you looking for? At what address? We’ll show you, you won’t have to waste time looking. Jews, will you get a load of this: we’ve got a Jewish mailman, just exactly as if we were in Palestine!”5 This ironic sense of living “in Palestine” pervades the writings of many ghetto chroniclers, for whom the analogy is always sardonic. Echoing the monologues of Sholem Aleichem allows Opoczynski to conjure up a shtetllike environment where Jews are all on intimate terms with one another, and then to use this model of solidarity as a foil for unmasking the shmendrikes, the self-hating assimilationist Jews, the corruption, and the apathy that takes hold of the ghetto population. Thanks to the modern Yiddish classics, Opoczynski had a rich and adaptable model of the shtetl (a small town with a large Jewish population in Central and Eastern Europe) as collective hero – or antihero – especially in time of crisis. Oskar Rosenfeld became a refugee for the second time when, in November 1941, he and ﬁve thousand other Jews were deported from Prague to the Polish industrial city of Lodz, which had been renamed Litzmannstadt after a Nazi general on April 11, 1940. Thanks to his credentials and impeccable German, Rosenfeld landed a secure job working on the ofﬁcial ghetto chronicle, but on February 17, 1942, he also began keeping a combination diary and literary journal, of which twenty out of twenty-two notebooks would survive. Three days into his writing – after describing the ﬁrst public hanging in the ghetto, dutifully recorded by a German ﬁlm crew – he described the ghetto landscape, a panorama in snow that turned subjective at the mention of the children: Bleak and barren roads, partly snowed in and partly covered with mud, stretch between houses dotting the landscape. Stunted trees and bushes extend their meager trembling branches toward the sky. Throngs of children in rags cross the streets, their yellow, weatherworn faces furrowed, weary. At times a ﬂeeting smile appears on one of those faces, sometimes one [pair] of those bloodless lips begins to sing. At times these children throw snowballs like children everywhere in freedom. Nobody can tell what the morrow will bring. What will happen with all of us? . . . And yet, everybody wants to live, “to live it,” to know that this life was not completely senseless after all.6\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Roskies\n\nLife on this barren soil where nothing can grow has already turned adults into innocent children. No one knows what tomorrow will bring, or even if there will be a tomorrow. Only innocent children, “like children everywhere,” think there will be a tomorrow. All roads leading out of the ghetto have been destroyed, so there remains only the slimmest hope of communicating with the people who live in freedom. The Jews in the ghetto write to sustain a future that they know will exist – if at all – without them. Josef Zelkowicz from Lodz also led a double life. His day job, working alongside Rosenfeld, was to report on the productivity of the dizzying array of workshops and makeshift factories in which every able-bodied ghetto Jew was forced to work – and on the social assistance needed by the sick, the old, and the unemployed. Some of these reports are dry as dust, but many have the tone of an omniscient narrator, free to formulate broad, transcendent truths and generalizations and free to pass judgment on the sordid conditions of the ghetto. When not reporting on the carpenter’s strike in the winter of 1941, or the removal of forty-six patients from the psychiatric ward in the ghetto and their subsequent deportation, Zelkowicz penned the reportage “TwentyFive Live Chickens and One Dead Document.” It was the true story of a murderous guard at the ghetto fence known as “Red-haired Janek,” a pureblooded Christian Pole who passes himself as a Volksdeutsch, or ethnic German, a veritable VIP. This time, however, Janek’s deal to smuggle twenty-ﬁve chickens into the ghetto had fallen through, so he plotted revenge against his Jewish partner by shooting and killing twenty-four innocent Jews in reprisal. Schooled in Jewish historical memory, Zelkowicz understood the treacherous workings of memory through time. To signal that knowledge, he framed the story of the live chickens and the dead document within a double frame, the ﬁrst an epigraph, in Aramaic: “Through a cock and a hen Tur Malka was destroyed ([Babylonian Talmud,] Tractate Gittin 57a).” “Tur Malka” was another name for Jerusalem, and Zelkowicz expected his readers to remember the rabbinic legend that blamed the catastrophic Jewish rebellion against Rome on a banal incident with a cock and a hen. Roman soldiers had seized these animals from a Jewish wedding procession, the Jews beat the soldiers up, and the emperor thought a rebellion had broken out. Zelkowicz’s point is that if such a trivial event could have had such disastrous consequences then, it could happen again. The Germans were no less cruel than the Romans. Wearing two hats – that of the criminal investigator and that of the keeper of Jewish historical memory – Zelkowicz raised the stakes, for if the Lodz ghetto were analogous to Jerusalem, then\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Another ghetto reporter was Leyb Goldin, who had worked as a professional translator of European literature before the war. His sole surviving work from the Warsaw ghetto is the masterful 1941 “Chronicle of a Single Day,” in which he breaks himself up into two voices: Arke, the cynical superintellectual and one-time revolutionary, and his stomach. Arke knows about the malleability of time not only from reading The Magic Mountain but also from having done time before the war, in solitary conﬁnement. But the war has been going on for two years, “and you’ve eaten nothing but soup for some four months, and those four months are thousands and thousands of times longer for you than the whole of the previous twenty months – no, longer than your whole life until now.”7 Starvation time is further broken down into three uneven segments: before the single bowl of soup handed out each afternoon at precisely the same hour, during the soup, and after the soup. Ghetto time deﬁes all clockmakers, including those we call writers.\n\nThe search for historical meaning To the Jews of Eastern Europe, schooled in collective memory, the search for ancient analogies always began with the Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible. Faced with a catastrophe of unprecedented scope, both ubiquitous and inescapable, Jewish writers and chroniclers reached into the fund of Jewish collective memory for historical archetypes. Yitzhak Katzenelson organized and presided over public readings of the Hebrew Bible in his own rhymed Yiddish translations, in which he sought to demonstrate that the Prophets had never been more alive, more relevant. The most ambitious publication of the underground press in the Warsaw ghetto was his Job: A Biblical Tragedy in Three Acts, of which Dror published about 150 copies on June 22, 1941, the day that Germany declared war on the Soviet Union. Gracing the cover was Shloyme Nusboym’s illustration of Job crouched on the ground, nursing his wounds. While Job focused on the existential and erotic struggle of the individual Jew, By the Waters of Babylon: A Biblical Folk Drama in Four Acts described the plight of the nation and ended with a verse translation of Ezekiel’s vision of the dry bones. Working by analogy, trying things on for size, comparing and contrasting present and past – these practices did not always lead to an experience of déjà vu. “The tragedy is tremendous,” Rosenfeld recorded in Notebook E, in midsummer 1942:\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Roskies Those in the ghetto cannot comprehend it. For it does not bring out any greatness as in the Middle Ages. This tragedy is devoid of heroes. And why tragedy? Because the pain does not reach out to something human, to a strange heart, but is something incomprehensible, colliding with the cosmos, a natural phenomenon like the creation of the world. Creation would have to start anew, with berajshit [the ﬁrst word of the Hebrew Bible]. In the beginning God created the ghetto.8\n\nGhetto chroniclers were the ﬁrst to perceive the outlines of something new: the birth of a new archetype of destruction. Was the measure of this new catastrophe the distance, the unbridgeable gap, between the spiritual superiority of prior generations and the demoralization of their own? Did everyday acts of heroism count as Kiddush Hashem or only as acts of extraordinary self-sacriﬁce? The ghetto poets were divided on this point, with one school of thought represented by Yitzhak Katzenelson in Warsaw and the other by Abraham Sutzkever in Vilna and SimkheBunem Shayevitsh in Lodz. Polish Jewry, Katzenelson resolved in year 4 of the war, was heir to a model of heroism perfected over millennia of exile in which the supreme act of self-sacriﬁce was performed “with no weapons and no spurs.” “And if this Jew spills any blood,” he proclaimed, “it is only his own.”9 A supreme instance of this type of Jew was the Rebbe of Radzyn, the scion of an illustrious Hasidic dynasty. In order to bring a trainload of Jews to burial, the Radzyner spurned efforts to buy him safe passage. “The Song of the Radzyner” was the last and longest epic poem that Katzenelson wrote in the Warsaw ghetto. It was an epic of the old school, about a named ﬁgure who was larger than life and who, like Rabbi Akiva and the ten martyred rabbis, turned private deﬁance into a supremely public act. Katzenelson’s hero, moreover, was as fearless of death as of the pathos of God – a diminished, powerless God. The Radzyner redeﬁned the meaning of martyrdom as absolute devotion to the people of Israel. In the Vilna ghetto, even schoolchildren got into the act. The ghetto’s history club put Herod on trial in front of an invited audience, and ﬁfteenyear-old Isaac Rudashevski argued the case against him as a criminal, a Roman collaborator, and an agent of assimilation. After heated debate, the court declared Herod guilty. Sutzkever, meanwhile, immortalized the everyday courage of the teacher, Mira Bernshteyn, who plied her trade before an ever-dwindling class. The curriculum they were studying, according to Sutzkever, was I. L. Peretz’s tale of triple martyrdom, “Three Gifts,” which extolled the moral imagination of every man and woman and their courage to go beyond the letter of the law.\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Vi tayer iz far im atsind der frilingl der bloyer, – Dos bliml mitn shvartsapl fun gold! Mayn shokhn trogt zayn ondenk on badoyer: Der friling otemt in zayn layb – er hot azoy gevolt . . . Vilner geto, 29stn may 1943 (Flower For wanting to smuggle a ﬂower through the gates my neighbor paid the price of seven lashes. Now these blue petals with their nucleus of gold are such a precious sign of spring returning. My neighbor bears his scars with no regrets: Spring breathes through his ﬂesh, with so much yearning. Vilna ghetto, May 29, 1943)10\n\nResistance is ﬁrst and foremost an act of volition: for wanting to smuggle a ﬂower into the ghetto, a Jew receives seven lashes but is rewarded for “so much yearning” by having his pain transmuted into life-giving breath. Written in honor of spring, this poem ends with the spring coming alive within his neighbor’s body, which bears its scars “with no regrets.” Resistance is no less an act of the imagination – a spontaneous, creative response to cruelty and horror. Standing in for the precious ﬂower, the standard of beauty that cannot be falsiﬁed, is this perfectly crafted poem built on two sets of rhymes: the feminine rhymes toyer, bloyer, and badoyer and the masculine rhymes batsolt, gold, and gevolt. One set is in ethereal, mystical blue and the other in earthly, material gold – two opposing realms yoked together through the mysterious power of rhyme. The “neighbor” remains anonymous because he is Every-Jew, Everypoet, everyone willing to risk all in order to uphold an absolute standard that cannot be breached. Faced with an enemy that deﬁles and destroys, “these blue petals with their nucleus of gold” represent that which is most precious on earth, as in heaven. Not a Jewish stance, to be sure, but like religious faith, it demands a supreme act of self-transcendence. Simkhe-Bunem Shayevitsh completed the process of deﬁning martyrdom broadly. The mass deportations from the Lodz ghetto resumed on February 22, 1942, and Shayevitsh began writing a 448-line epic poem called\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Roskies\n\n“Lekh-lekho” (Go forth), in which God’s command to Abraham in Genesis 12 is transformed into an intimate, remarkably muted conversation between a father and his beloved eight-year-old daughter, Blimele (meaning little ﬂower). Shayevitsh was a ﬁrst-generation secular poet in whose library “lie holy books, / worldly books, my manuscripts. / Isaiah hobnobs with Goethe, / Reb Jonathan Eybeschuetz with Tuwim . . . And Yesenin wants to get drunk / and urinate in public, / but suddenly he sees Abraham / leading Isaac to Mount Moriah.”11 The intrusion of that “but suddenly” on the home and hearth of one ghetto family awaiting the expulsion order is the theme of this great poem; the attempt of an otherwise powerless father to draw out a semblance of meaning by redeﬁning the biblical covenant in a collapsing universe. As they ascend this new Moriah, where no angel will intercede to stay the knife, the father instructs his daughter to face death with a smile, to defy the enemy with the indomitable spirit of the Jews.\n\nTime after “Am I the last poet in Europe?” Sutzkever asked himself at the end of June 1943. “Do I sing for the dead, do I sing for the crows?” The answer he arrived at was a study in realms of opposition forcibly wrenched together: “I am drowning in ﬁre, in swamps, in brine, / Entrapped by yellow badged hours.”12 There were only two ways to escape from the yellow-badged hours: one was through the coming of spring, the regenerative cycle of nature, which for Sutzkever was always linked to the process of artistic creation; the other was through armed revolt. In his wartime poetry, Sutzkever tracks a paradigm shift that occurred in modern Jewish times. The new Jew, machine gun in hand, ﬁghting as a Jew – the longed-for Jewish army ﬁnally ﬁghting under its ancient banner – was born in 1943. From Sutzkever we learn that the labor pains attending that birth were terrible. “Abrasha” Sutzkever joined the United Partisans’ Organization (known as the FPO from its name in Yiddish), under the command of Itsik Vittenberg, soon after its founding. In midwinter 1943, Liza Magun, the FPO’s main courier and liaison to the Jewish underground in other ghettos, was caught and executed by the Gestapo. (Magun was to the resistance movement in Vilna what Tosia Altman and Zivia Lubetkin were to it in Warsaw.) More than a tragic loss and strategic setback, Magun’s death made clear to Sutzkever that the FPO was fated to ﬁght alone, because the ghetto population was utterly indifferent. Standing before his fellow partisans, who were gathered legally at a memorial ceremony for Magun, Sutzkever\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Nowhere is the distance between poet and audience, between the one and the many, more pronounced than here, in “Lid tsu di letste” (“Song for the Last”). The farther apart the prophet is from the people, the greater the tension inside him between rage and sorrow, loathing and lamentation: I beat my skull on stones to ﬁnd consolation for you in the fragments, you, the last, for I, too, am a letter in your book, my sun, too, is spring’s leprous outcast.13\n\nDeeper than the divide between the prophet and the people that refuses to hearken to his word is the gap between the different time zones that the two inhabit. The poetic prophet, alive to the cycles of nature, sees the ﬁrst signs of spring. Yet just as the natural world is about to be reborn, the ancient cycle of a great and sorely tested people is about to be closed forever. Time has run out on this people, thunders the prophet, because so much of it has been squandered: “Millions at a time you were no one’s, / but believed in your individuality.” Even “when a thousand years of enmity / has walled the light out completely,” it produced no palpable response, no protest, no vision for the future.14 By the end of 1943, year 4 of the war, metonymy became myth for the Jews who remained alive inside the Jew-Zone, most of whom were now alone: hiding alone, dying alone, ﬁghting alone. For the young who took up arms, there were only three choices: go down ﬁghting in a symbolic last stand against the Germans, turning the ghetto into a latter-day Masada; join a Soviet partisan brigade, where Jewish ﬁghters were not always welcome; or forge whatever alliances were possible with the local underground in order to go on ﬁghting as Jews. Mordecai Tenenbaum-Tamaroff belonged in the ﬁrst group. The Sutzkevers belonged in the second. Szymek (Shimshon) and Gusta Draenger belonged in the third. Each group left behind a literary legacy in multiple voices and tonalities. The diary, last letters, and calls to arms issued by Tenebaum-Tamaroff in Warsaw and Białystok were lovingly collected, translated, and published by the surviving members of his Zionist movement. Sutzkever continued to date his poetry written in the Narocz forest, even as he edited and augmented his ghetto corpus for eventual publication. The return to the life-giving forest quickened his poetic spirit. “Stretch your hands out,” he exulted in perfect rhyme: To that whiteness: In its cold and burning Veins\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Roskies You’ll feel returning The redeeming life It contains.15\n\nYet surrounded at the same time by so much emptiness and enmity, he suddenly perceived the most terrifying of all metonymies: And if my people shall remain only a number, I adjure it: that from my memory it disappear. And may all the graves be buried deeper And may no dust remain of the years.16\n\nThe Great Deportation Metonymy and myth are the two basic means of symbolic shorthand. One is punctual, bare-bones, a world in miniature, which draws on the acute observation of present reality. The other is the punctual rendered transtemporal, a primal plot that recurs again and again, a foundational map of the future. Myth is rooted in collective memory; it is the alphabet used in the grammar of remembrance. What happened inside the Jew-Zone in year 4 of the war is that metonymy became myth. As one ghetto after another was liquidated – the smaller ones ﬁrst, then the major ones – an entire people was reduced to bits and scraps, last letters, a few photographs, and piles of abandoned clothing. As the old, the inﬁrm, the mothers and children were cast into the inferno, and all the strategies for survival failed, those few still left alive cast about for something – anything – that might represent the many, if only as a mnemonic. In the face of total destruction, every memento took on lasting signiﬁcance. For Rachel Auerbach, one of Ringelblum’s closest associates, the part that stood for the whole had been the soup kitchen at 40 Leszno Street, where writers and intellectuals like Goldin received their daily ration – the kitchen Auerbach ran with selﬂess devotion and described with scholarly rigor for the Oyneg Shabes. But of what use was memorializing the social service network in Europe’s largest ghetto after its liquidation? In the course of six weeks, 235,741 people were rounded up in one spot, the notorious assembly point called Umschlagplatz, and shipped off in cattle-cars to die in a place called Treblinka. A whole city of Jews, a city within a city, masses on masses of people – men, women, and children – were gone. The work of the Oyneg Shabes was temporarily suspended. The only task that remained for the surviving members of the staff was to chronicle the Great Deportation. But where should they begin from: the perspective of the dead or that of the living?

No less fearful was the fate of those still alive, as brilliantly captured by the metonymy of Perle’s dog tag, number 4580, issued to the “ChosenPeoplish” Jews, those thirty thousand who survived the Great Deportation just long enough to work as slave-labor. An empty number with no history was all that remained of a lifetime of collective dreams and personal ambitions. Perle’s number was, he saw, a sign of the Apocalypse. The Polish-language poet Władysław Szlengel likewise adopted multiple perspectives. A popular cabaret poet in the ghetto and a one-time member of the Jewish police, Szlengel decided at the beginning of year 4 that it was time to sort through his papers and compose a last will and testament with the sardonic title of “Co czytałem umarłym” (“What I Read to the Dead”). To set the antisentimental tone, Szlengel began by recalling a prewar Soviet ﬁlm about trapped sailors on a sunken submarine. The last survivor, about to suffocate, had scrawled a ﬁnal message that afﬁrmed his faith that he was dying for a higher cause. But speaking for the Warsaw Jews, Szlengel could take no such comfort: With all my being I feel that I am suffocating as the air in my sunken boat slowly gives out. [Unlike the Soviet sailor] the reasons I am in this boat have nothing to do with heroism. I am here against my will, and without any reason or guilt. But here I am, in the boat. And although I am no captain, I still think that I should at least write the chronicle of those who have sunk to the bottom. I don’t want to leave behind only statistics. Through my poems, sketches and writings I want to enrich (a bad word, I know) the historical record that will be written in the future. On the wall of my submarine I scrawl my poem-documents. To my companions I, a poet of ad 1943, am reading my scribblings.17\n\nAmong these “poem-documents” is one that recapitulates the methodical murder of Polish Jewry with absolute metonymic precision. “Things” tracks the six stages of the cross – not of one exemplary martyr or of the entire Jewish people, but of their “furniture, tables and chairs, / suitcases and bundles,” as the owners are dispossessed and moved to ever more desolate and restricted quarters; forced, by station 4, to move “along a Jewish road / with no big bundles or little bundles, / no furniture or chairs”; reduced to carrying “a small suitcase and a knapsack, / no need for anything else,” as they are marched off in even rows of ﬁve to the blockhouses reserved for slave-labor and ﬁnally, to their deaths, leaving behind their “abandoned\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

In their Second Coming, however, the “Jewish things” return in a grand and vengeful procession of materia mnemonica, retracing the Via Dolorosa of a martyred people. Like Szlengel casting about for some disastrous analog, Auerbach begins her own requiem for the dead in 1943 by recalling a ﬂood she once saw in the mountains. Facing the raging waters from afar, she was close enough to see the gaping mouths of the helpless victims, but not to hear their cries. Just so, standing on the far side of the river of time, she is close enough to recall the catastrophe in every detail, but far enough away to conduct a search for meaning: “And that’s how the Jewish masses ﬂowed to their destruction in the time of the deportations. Sinking as helplessly into the deluge of destruction.”19 To make this leap from a natural to a historical disaster, Auerbach substitutes a “deluge of destruction” for a ﬂood in the mountains to signify the primeval ﬂood. Likening the Great Deportation to a ﬂood in no way implies that she accepts the biblical belief that an act of God is a sign of divine retribution. On the contrary: the ﬂood analogy means for Auerbach that the evil descended on the Jews from on high like a force of nature, fatally inevitable. The dead were blameless! Auerbach proceeds to put ﬂesh on the dialectic of destruction by drawing a composite portrait of her people, recalling them group by group: the children and the youth; the women and the men; the idealists and assimilationists; even the underworld, a distinct and especially vital branch of Polish Jewry; the grandmothers and grandfathers; and ﬁnally the pietists and the beggars. Exhausted by the effort to recall each group of Jews individually, despairing of the possibility of ever completing the litany of losses, Auerbach makes her account of the ﬂood more personal – and more gendered. She turns to an incident that happened to her while riding the Warsaw streetcar, the jarring moment that birthed this very work. Sitting opposite her was a Polish Catholic woman, her head thrown back, talking to herself. Seeing and hearing that bereaved mother crying, like one mad or drunk, reminded Auerbach of another woman who seemed drunk or mad with personal grief: Hannah in Shiloh, crying her heart out before God, because she is childless (1 Sam. 1). But as a Jew living on Aryan papers, Auerbach cannot cry in public. What can she do? She can sit down and write her chronicle. She can return to the ancient rite of Jewish mourning, to the recitation of yizkor:\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

For such a person to take pen in hand at that time was an act of profound selfawareness. At that precise moment, a unique form of confessional diary was born. Time in this diary ﬂows forward and backward; events are both recorded as they happen and reﬂected on after the fact. The diarists have a terrible secret to confess, forcing them to backtrack to the time of the slaughter. However irrational, they blame themselves for being absent when the roundup occurred, for believing the false promises, for failing to secure a hiding place. They confess to having abdicated their role as father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, or sister, their own survival predicated on the death of their loved ones. “Everywhere [I turn],” wrote Grete Holländer on October 31, 1943, “I encounter only dead people. Am I really still alive?”21 Never far from Holländer’s thoughts were her young daughter, Sonja, entrusted to a gentile couple, and “the terrible day” her husband, Marek, was taken from her, not to mention the four hundred women from the Czortków Lager who were taken away before her very eyes. Giving voice to her “unspeakable anger” at their murder, she began keeping a diary in pencil in notebooks typically used by schoolchildren.22 To write, from that moment on, was for her to work through overwhelming loss and a crushing burden of guilt. In diaries such as hers, time was split in two: time before and time after. The moment of truth in these confessional diaries was the moment of moral complicity, of radical self-confrontation, which each diarist reached by a different route. In the ﬁrst days of the Great Deportation, Abraham Lewin abruptly switched the language in which he kept his ghetto diary from Yiddish to Hebrew. Then, on the day his wife, Luba, was rounded up in Umschlagplatz and shipped off to her death, Lewin began a new calendrical and moral reckoning. Interspersed with the terrible news that reached him hour after hour, which he labored to put into chronological sequence for the sake of future generations, were ﬂashes of self-blame. “The\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Roskies\n\nŚwieca family has perished,” he reported at the end of a lengthy entry dated the eve of Rosh Hashana in 1942: He [Mr. Świeca] gave himself up after seeing how his wife and two children were taken. Initially he went with us to Gęsia Street, later he went back, gave himself up and was sent away. I feel a great compassion and admiration for this straightforward person. Strong in mind as well as strong in body. I think that Luba would have done the same, but I didn’t have enough strength to die together with her, with the one that I loved so much.23\n\n“Where shall I start?” asks Stanisław Adler, hiding on the Aryan side of Warsaw. “There is an overpowering desire burning in me to put in writing as speedily as possible all that has happened to us in these years of war, especially that which I, myself, have been witness to in the last six months. Even now I am terriﬁed that the dangers which threaten me from all sides might prevent me from ﬁnishing this manuscript.”24 Feeding Adler’s panic is the knowledge that all his writing thus far “has turned out to be a Penelope’s web”: the border police burned his diary from the ﬁrst months of the war; his reconstructed notes were also destroyed when he was interned in the Warsaw ghetto, and everything he wrote inside the ghetto he “had to leave for the wolves to devour” when he escaped to the Aryan side. “Against a logic which I cannot satisfy,” he goes on to explain, and against a literary tradition which I consciously ignore, I feel almost impelled to start from the end of my story. This is not because it is my intention to begin with the impact of my personal experiences, but because I feel the need to vindicate myself. Instead of an axe or a club I am now holding a pen in my hand. I am alive and living here, and not lying in trenches in an unequal battle or in one of the collective graves of Warsaw Jewry.25\n\nThe specter of one’s loved ones points to an essential feature of these confessional diaries: they labor to recreate what no longer exists. Their point of departure is when “my real life began to end.” On the very day – May 22, 1943 – that Yitzhak Katzenelson arrived from Warsaw at the transit camp in Vittel, France, accompanied by his surviving son, seventeen-yearold Zvi, the poet and playwright began to keep a diary. Instead of bringing him and his son closer together, he recorded, the catastrophe had driven them further apart; both were going mad, in different ways. That distance, in turn, intensiﬁed Katzenelson’s bereavement for three of the murdered millions, whose names – Hannah, his wife, and Bentsikl and Binyomin, their sons – he repeated like an incantation. Two weeks passed before he wrote another word in the diary. On July 21, the dam burst, with the\n\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

From then on, Katzenelson backtracked to the slaughter, as if reliving it in real time, back to the liquidation of the Little Ghetto with all its orphans, who had performed the plays he had written for their beneﬁt; back to the discovery that his loved ones had been taken to Treblinka; back to the cellar at Karmelicka 9, on the eve of the ﬁrst armed resistance; back to ﬁnding his works strewn about the abandoned ghetto streets. Each diarist inhabited a private hell. Each labored to reconstruct a paradise lost. Everything about these diaries was fraught with tension – especially the question of what language to write them in. “Ikh mit mayn zun Tsvi,” Katzenelson began his diary in Yiddish. “Ani im Tsvi beni,” he translated the words and continued in Hebrew. As simple a phrase as “I and my son Zvi” was for the diarist a statement of faith, because in all the surrounding rooms and apartments, Polish Jews, the last of the last, were making a point of speaking . . . in Polish. What was it that moved both Katzenelson and Lewin to switch from one Jewish language to another? Did writing in Hebrew automatically elevate one’s private testimony to a metahistorical plane? Ensure the document’s eternality? Render it more conspiratorial? Insert a psychological buffer zone? Or all four? Whatever the reasons, the confusion of languages signaled an attendant confusion of addressee. Who was this document intended to reach? Who was still left to decipher its contents? When the outside horror penetrates the inner defenses and refuses to let go is when the confessional diary is born.\n\nThe last to die: the Sonderkommando In the end the Germans created Auschwitz-Birkenau – the last stop, the ﬁnal destination. The transport from Luna, which included Zalmen Gradowski and his family, arrived on December 8, 1942.

Roskies\n\nbuild, Gradowski had been handpicked for the thousand-member Sonderkommando: men who oversaw the murder of their own people, gave them instructions about where to undress and where to leave their belongings, shaved their heads, and led them to the baths; men whose job it was to pull the dead from the gas chambers, pry open their mouths to extract their gold teeth, and feed the bodies into the ovens; men whose own days were numbered, as he was to number the twenty-two months spent in their company and to mourn their liquidation, counting himself among the last 191 survivors. They were quartered in a special block, ate what no one else was allowed to eat, and saw what no one else was allowed to see. Gradowski was not content merely to chronicle events. He wished also to contextualize them and anticipate the reader’s response. Possessed of literary ambitions, with an iterative style and apostrophes to nature that betrayed his debt to Polish romanticism, Gradowski kept circling back to the question of Jewish passivity. To the postwar reader who sat out the war in the Free Zone, Gradowski addressed his “notes” from the underground, whose purpose was to explain how the people of Israel could have vanished so quickly from the soil of Europe. Were they merely casualties of the war? Were they destroyed by some natural disaster? And why did they, each individual and the millions in the aggregate, allow this to happen? As he labored to reconstruct the tortuous journey from ghetto to concentration and death camp, Gradowski dwelt on the myriad ways a person condemned to death could misread the signs. Of everything he witnessed in those twenty-two months, what stood out in his memory above all else was not the “courageous young man from a Białystok transport [who] had attacked some guards with knives, wounded several of them severely and was shot trying to ﬂee” or the incident of the “Warsaw Transport” before which he bowed his head in deep respect, singling out “the splendid young woman, a dancer from Warsaw, . . . who snatched a revolver from [Walter] Quackernack, the Oberscharfürer of the ‘Political Section’ in Auschwitz and shot the Referat-führer, the notorious Unterscharführer [Josef] Schillinger.”27 Rather, it was the fate of the Czech family transport: such intelligent and resourceful Jews, who had been allowed to live together, were duped together, and were gassed together on Purim, March 7, 1944. To “The Czech Transport” Gradowski dedicated his most sustained work, in which he tried to understand not only the psychology of the murdered, but also the psychology of the mass murderers. His literary means were limited, but his insights were not. The Germans were engaged in a mythic, life-and-death struggle with the demonic Juden.
