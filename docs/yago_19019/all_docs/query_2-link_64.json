The sanitary conditions were appalling, there were no medicines or dressings available, which really put our skills as doctors to a test when trying to provide the patients with relative peace, warmth or the ability to lie down rather than stand for hours on end during roll-calls or do backbreaking work. It meant a lot. Besides, we had a chance to help – at least for a while – the elderly, the less resilient, the young. We hired fifteen and sixteen-year-old girls as nurses and they performed their duties with commendable devotion and enthusiasm.\n\n— Aglajda Brudkowska, MD\n\nOn the fourth day of the Jewish Uprising, April 22, 1943, I was sent to Lublin to the so-called Luftschutzplatz in a transport of maybe 2,000 people captured at the ghetto. From there, after 8 days of selection and distribution of the prisoners to the camps in Treblinka, Trawniki, Poniatowa and at Majdanek, I was sent to Majdanek where I stayed until September 22, 1943. At the time, I ran the malarial disease block – for Greek women, and I was also the chief gynecology surgeon for the entire Majdanek infirmary.\n\n— Alina Brewda, MD\n\nC\n\nCetnarowicz Halina\n\nCzernichow Luba\n\nF\n\nFerszt Fajga\n\nFolman Maryla née Orzeł\n\nG\n\nGiebartowska Eugenia\n\nGlobus Anna\n\nGrigoriewna Maria\n\nGrodzieńska-Dubrow Maria née Tylko\n\nGrodzińska Irena\n\nŁ\n\nŁuczak Jadwiga\n\nM\n\nMarder Maria\n\nMins Salomea\n\nN\n\nNajburzanka (Najbużanska)\n\nNarkiewicz-Jodko Hanna\n\nNiedek Anna Jadwiga\n\nNieszczyńska Antonina\n\nNikoforowa Antonina Aleksandrowna\n\nP\n\nPawlenko Nadia\n\nPerzanowska Stefania\n\nPlutecka-Levitoux Irena\n\nPrzeworska\n\nR\n\nRubin Irena\n\nS\n\nSimbircewa Lidia\n\nS\n\nTrojanowicz Tatjana\n\nW\n\nWaleria s.\n\nWdowińska Józefa\n\nWdowińska Antonina née Berger\n\nŻ\n\nŻeńczykowska Daromiła\n\nback to panel04.
