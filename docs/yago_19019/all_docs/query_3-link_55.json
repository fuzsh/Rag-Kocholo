        "text": "This article is devoted to the issue of revitalisation and revival of traditional musical instruments in Poland in the context of music competitions. Research on revival activities in Poland is rare, as is research on the phenomenon of traditional music competitions. Meanwhile, over the last nine decades, traditional music competitions have become the main environment for the public presentation of traditional music and stimulating the revival and revitalisation of individual musical phenomena. In this area, I have been conducting my own participant observations and archival research for over two decades. I understand the revival phenomenon itself and the activities that constitute it after Caroline Bithell and Juniper Hill (2013). The distinction between the terms revitalisation and revival is based on that made by Ingrid Åkesson (2006) and Ulrich Morgenstern (2019). In the text I discuss the issue of revitalisation of the Podhale bagpipes and the revival of the hurdy-gurdy. I also show that the phenomenon of the revival of musical tradition is accompanied by processes of depreciation of the role, importance or presence of other instruments, such as the accordion or clarinet. I also show the important role of the activism of leading figures among both researchers and lovers of traditional music, as well as musicians and instrument builders.\n\nThe first part of this thesis reframes Chopin’s art of piano fingering through the lens of the neglected (yet all too often reviled) pedagogical repertoire of the early nineteenth century. In doing so, it readdresses some largely unquestioned truisms regarding Chopin’s own approach to finger choice, as well as issues of influence, originality and innovation. This line of inquiry ultimately uncovers a need to rekindle research on Clementi’s and Hummel’s fingering practices—Chopin’s pianistic models after all. These pedagogues’ didactic music offers today’s players not just another indirect means for study of Chopin’s approach to piano technique and performance, but direct access to a rich repository of techniques of expression in themselves which, absent fingering indications, we would probably never know existed. Extended case studies then draw on the Chopin Etudes as the best possible illustration of these issues, using the many currently available primary sources: autograph manuscripts, manuscript copies, early editions, and student annotated scores. These case studies do not, however, provide any sort of ‘performance guide’ to the Etudes (much less of a prescriptive bent), but focus rather on the phenomenology of the original fingerings in context. That is, they explore interrelationships between musical composition (or improvisation), the gestural by- products of finger choice, and the player’s own expressive intent. The aesthetic stance taken throughout is that any congruent use of these historical fingerings arises to a very high degree from the player’s own individual rhetorical disposition and involvement, all of which should help override aprioristic (or Werktreue) ideas of performance outcome. Such an historically involved approach should thus provide alternatives to those pianists wishing to engage in historicist yet also highly personal performance of Chopin’s music.\n\nReception of Chopin and his Music in Polish Society. In spite of the fact that Chopin is regarded as the greatest Polish composer neither his life, nor his music is well known by the mass audience in Poland. The paper presents the results of empirical study on the reception of Chopin in Polish society. The collected data allowed for examination of Polish listeners’ attitudes toward Chopin and the criteria used by respondents to evaluate his music. We also try to investigate the way people perceive Chopin. The specificity of Polish culture and mass culture are the background of the explanation why there is little interest on Chopin’s works in Poland\n\nMany volumes have already been written about the Polishness of Chopin’s music and about his influence on composers of various nationalities active in the Romantic and later periods. In this text the author looks at how Chopin was viewed by 20th-century Polish composers regarding two aspects: 1) how they interpreted his music in the context of its links to Polishness and 2) whether and how they took on his musical concepts in their own oeuvres. This will allow to shed some light on the reception and resonance (to use the terminology of Mieczysław Tomaszewski, a distinguished expert on Chopin and 20th-century Polish music) of the figure and music of Chopin in Polish music of the previous century. There will be examined an extremely patriotic public speech given by Paderewski in 1910, as well as Szymanowski’s opinions from the 1920s. Moreover, the politically driven celebrations of Chopin Year in 1949 will be recalled. The special attention will be put on the musical genres associated ...\n\nThis study approaches the compilation of piano pieces known under the general title Játékok (or Games), which was written by the Hungarian composer György Kurtág. Started in 1973, the set reflects the political context of Hungary under Soviet domination, as well as its posterior dissolution, also revealing the composer’s sensitivity and openness to create in a moment of historical and aesthetic transition. In analyzing how the collection achieved a synthesis between the radical experiments of the avant-garde and the canonic repertoire, it focus on the cultural symbols he manipulates within his music, juxtaposing elements from several layers of tradition. The concept of musical games unfolds in different ways. They can be analyzed as performative games, in which ‘playing’ is interpreted as the more obvious act of performing the pieces, but also related to the idea of ‘playfulness’, therefore treating the piano almost as a toy, exploring all possibilities of movement. Another even larger group is represented by those pieces treated as compositional and/or cultural games. Here, the composer is ‘playing with tradition, alluding to other composers, artists and historical practices, and by consequence also relocating the cultural meaning embedded in those borrowings. This research concludes focusing on the private games, in which people, colleagues and facts from the composer’s personal life stimulate his own composition. The last section analyses the process of transmutation from a pedagogical series to the increasing exposure of his private world and frequent references to loss, identifying certain recurrent patterns occurring already in the first volumes."
