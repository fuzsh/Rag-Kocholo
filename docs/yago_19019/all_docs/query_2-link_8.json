        "text": "American novelist Martha Ellis Gellhorn was born in St. Louis, MO, in 1908 to a well-to-do family. She traveled widely in Europe, where she met and married her first husband, a French journalist named Marquis Juvenel. In 1934 her first novel, \"What Mad Pursuit\", was published. She later worked on a newspaper in Albany, NY, and struck up an acquaintance with Harry Hopkins, who was in charge of the US government's Emergency Relief Administration, and he commissioned her to do a survey of people who were on relief in urban industrial areas. After she turned in the results of that survey, she used parts of it as the basis for her next novel, \"The Trouble I've Seen\", for which famed author H.G. Wells wrote the introduction.\n\nShe was in Spain during the civil war in the late 1930s, covering it for a US magazine, when she met writer Ernest Hemingway. They became fast friends, and it was rumored that she was the inspiration for the lead character in his novel \"The Fifth Column\". Hemingway did dedicate his novel \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" to her, and in 1940, after Hemingway obtained a divorce from his second wife--Gellhorn was by this time divorced from her husband--he married her.\n\nShe had been covering Czechoslovakia and Finland on assignment for \"Collier's Weekly\" magazine, and in 1941 she traveled to the Far East for the magazine (one of her journeys took her on the infamous Burma Road). Her novel \"A Stricken Field\", published in 1940, was about Czech refugees driven out of the country after it was taken over by Nazi Germany. The next year she published a book of short stories, \"The Heart of Another\", about the effects of the war on the people in Europe.\n\nMartha Gellhorn died of cancer Feb. l6, 1998, in London, England.\n\nDaphne Du Maurier was one of the most popular English writers of the 20th Century, when middle-brow genre fiction was accorded a higher level of respect in a more broadly literate age. For her services to literature, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969, the female equivalent of a knighthood. Thus, she achieved a trifecta of sorts, as her father and her husband were both knights.\n\nShe was born on May 13, 1907 in London, the second daughter of the famous actor-manager Gerald du Maurier, who himself was knighted in 1922, and the actress Muriel Beaumont. Her grandfather was the famous anglo-French writer George L. Du Maurier, the creator of Svengali in his 1894 novel \"Trilby\". (She was also cousin to the Llewelyn Davies boys, through her grandfather Gerald. The boys were the inspiration for the boys in J.M. Barrie' Peter Pan, der Traumelf (1924) and his Neverland works.) Her husband was also famous: Frederick A. M. Browning, the WWII Commander \"Boy\" Browning renowned as the \"father of the British airborne forces.\" He helped plan and execute Operation Market Garden, an airborne operation that put Allied troops into Germany and the Netherlands, an ultimately unsuccessful venture chronicled in Cornelius Ryan's Die Br√ºcke von Arnheim (1977). During the Second World War, Boy Browning achieved the rank of Lieutenant General and a knighthood. Browning's quote that Arnheim was a bridge too far later became famous as a book title and ultimately a movie title. Daphne published her first short story in 1928; her first novel, \"The Loving Spirit\", was published in 1931, and her last, \"Rule Britannia\", forty-one year later. In between, she achieved her greatest success with the novel Rebecca (1940), which was adapted by Alfred Hitchcock into a classic film that won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. Another novel, Wenn die Gondeln Trauer tragen (1973), adapted by Nicolas Roeg, is also considered a classic film in Britain.\n\nAlong with \"Rebecca\", she had great successes with her novels Riff-Piraten (1939) and Der Pirat und die Dame (1944), both of which were adapted into movies. The three novels were set in Cornwall, where she lived. In addition to multiple non-fiction books, Daphne Du Maurier also wrote three plays (including an adaptation of \"Rebecca\").\n\nShe died on April 19, 1989, in Par in her beloved Cornwall, five weeks shy of her 82nd birthday."
