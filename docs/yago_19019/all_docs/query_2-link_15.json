        "text": "An atmospheric and at the same time realistic romance drama with elements of comedy.\n\nThe screenplay is based on a humoresque by Stefania GrodzieÅska, a Polish stage and cabaret legend.\n\nAccurate and witty life observations and the unique atmosphere of the late 1950s are the film's strongest points.\n\nCheated on by her husband, Anna goes alone on a holiday to Zakopane, where she meets some people who she befriended there in the previous years. It turns out that everyone knows her secret. The lonely, unhappy woman attracts the attention of Andrzej, a handsome ladies' man. Initially, Anna rejects him, but after some time and yet another disappointment she decides to give her unfaithful husband a taste of his own medicine, especially that she and Andrzej take a genuine liking to each other. Eventually, the woman chooses not to have an affair with him, thus passing on a chance for a moment of happiness. However, her faithfulness goes unrewarded: while her husband does come to Zakopane, he does it only because he is meeting his new lover there.\n\n\"Rainy July\" is a film of a beginning and an end: it features the last on-screen appearance of popular actor Jan Kurnakowicz, whose career began before WWII, as well as the first major role played by Barbara Krafftówna, a distinguished film and theatre actress known, among other achievements, for her brilliant appearance in \"How to Be Loved\"."
