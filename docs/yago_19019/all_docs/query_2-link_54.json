Through the stories and the names\n\nThat they have heard, they will remember Them...\n\nMy Brother will live in their hearts,\n\nIn the images of their children and their grandchildren.\n\nBut this is not the same!\n\nHe was murdered when so young, in the prime of life\n\nThis cannot be returned!!! - Today is His birthday\n\nAnd He is no more here for so long - no trace was left.\n\nAnd winds will blow His scattered ashes\n\nUntil the end of world!...\n\nIs it proper that I sign my other name, which exists and lives?\n\nIs it me?\n\nDid I have Him? Had I a Brother once?! So many years ago...\n\nSo it seems according to the dates, the numbers of the days, the months...\n\nThey come back year by year, appear\n\nWithout the dearest.\n\n30.11.1982"
