It is only in October 1946 that these cases became subject to district courts, and, beginning in 1949, they passed under the jurisdiction of appeals courts. This change of jurisdiction reveals problems that arose since the beginning of the process of adjudicating crimes committed by Poles against Jews during the war3 because there was a clear tendency by the courts to treat such murders in a dismissive manner. For example, in the proceedings in the district court in Siedlce examined by Kornbluth, only nine of the thirty-nine accused of crimes committed against Jews were sentenced and only one man received the life sentence.4 This unusually low conviction rate for sentencing Polish criminals-anti-Semites has also been fully reflected in the research I have carried out for the purposes of this book. The results of this research show that over 80 percent of the cases conducted under the August decree against persons who had committed crimes against Polish citizens of Jewish origin during World War II ended with acquittals or with sentences in the lower sentence ranges. On the basis of subsequent research, it is estimated that in the years 1944–1960, 21,000 convictions were issued under the August decree, mainly concerning the crimes perpetrated by Poles against Jews; on the other hand, military courts, which had the job of combatting anti-state underground activities, issued 54,000 convictions, and that was in a much shorter period between 1945 and 1949.5 In September 1947, the Department of General Prosecutorial Supervision (pol. Wydział Ogólnego Nadzoru Prokuratorskiego) condemned “the 1\n\n2\n\nChapter 1\n\ncatastrophic state of the judicial system” in the country and stressed that the sentences passed against the war criminals were too mild and denounced the prosecutor’s office for not appealing the verdicts.6 In addressing this issue, Andrew Kornbluth adds the following comment in the text cited above: Jerzy Sawicki, a leading member of the prosecution team at the Nuremberg trials and at several most significant trials of war criminals in Poland, and Arnold Gubiński, deputy prosecutor and plenipotentiary for prosecuting people suspected of collaboration, stated that “the disproportionately low and inexplicable” convictions for crimes committed against Jews are proof that “verbalistic logic” hides behind the actions of members of the judiciary, which allows them to avoid confronting certain aspects of occupation “reality.” They pointed out that the narrow interpretation of the decree applied by the Supreme Court makes it almost impossible to punish those complicit in murder. At a council of judges in 1949, the chairman of the Supreme Court’s Criminal Division attributed the soft sentences to “a whispered anti-Soviet propaganda” and blamed the denouncing [. . .] of Polish citizens of Jewish nationality on “subconscious antiSoviet and anti-Semitic instincts” that characterize, in his opinion, “the older generation of judges.”7\n\nIt is necessary to point to yet another extremely interesting aspect of the postwar judicial reality in Poland. Namely, the communist authorities were well aware of and sought to limit their unpopularity in Polish society, for example, by trying at all costs to avoid the suspicion that they in any way were favoring the Jews who survived the extermination. In effect, an unwritten practice was adopted that, even when punishing war criminals where Poles were to be taken to account, the communist authorities tolerated moderation in sentencing. And all this was done to avoid deepening the hostility of society that was already negatively disposed toward the communists who had been suppressing the Polish resistance movement. As a result, many Polish criminals avoided punishment after the war. Hostility toward the communist authorities was also present in the judges’ corps itself which, due to staff shortages after the war, was drawn mainly from members of the prewar judiciary who were strongly imbued with nationalist ideology. This view was clearly expressed by Władysław Grzymała, the prosecutor from Siedlce, who in his memoirs wrote that “being less resourceful, the more honest Jews perished” during the war and those who survived were mere “riffraff” that sought revenge on the Poles and Poland. In effect, he also described actions undertaken in collusion with judges that were aimed at clearing of charges the defendants he was not convinced were guilty.8\n\nHow History Was Written\n\n3\n\nHow was the defense of the criminals conducted most often in the Polish justice system after the war? Kornbluth describes one commonly used legal stratagem that allowed the Polish torturers to avoid accountability. To wit, the courts that refused to convict the Poles accused of participating in the murder of Jews most often referred to article 2 of the decree, that is, to the following paragraph: Whoever in aiding the government of the German state or its allied states acted in a different manner or in other circumstances than envisaged in art. 1 to the detriment of the Polish State, a Polish legal person, persons from the civilian population or military persons or prisoners of war shall be punished to a prison term not less than 3 years or for life or by death penalty.\n\nThis article provided an alternative solution regarding Art. 1 of the decree, which called for an absolute sentence of death for the named crimes and, thus, made it possible to circumvent the death sentence to the benefit of the accused. In practice, the whole mechanism looked as follows: when considering, for example, the case of several Poles who voluntarily denounced or captured Jews, the Poles were convicted under Art. 2 and in the lower sentence ranges of at most a few years in prison. The Supreme Court, on the other hand, upheld these kinds of judgments because it deemed that the accused did not participate in the act of murder itself. As one can see, this kind of literal interpretation drastically reduced the chances of anyone being prosecuted and convicted. Overall, the decisions of the courts from the postwar period with regard to the murders of Jews by people of Polish nationality looked like apologias for the crimes in which the perfidy of the criminal acts was diminished and their premeditation negated, the evidence against the defendants was treated with skepticism, and favorable evidence of doubtful value was considered credible. In this manner, an alternative history of the occupation was created: in this narrative, the accused became victims of the Nazis as people who had no influence over the course of events in which they participated with such zeal.9 It should also be noted that the drastically low sentencing rate in convicting the Polish criminals was the result of the weakness of the Polish state after the war. The proximate cause of this weakness was the civil war that raged inside the country at least until the end of the 1940s; in the forests, especially in the Lublin and Białystok regions, strong partisan units were in operation, conducting armed attacks against communist militia posts and security offices, intimidating the local population, and carrying out death sentences against members of the new authorities and the civilians who collaborated with them. This coincided with the peak in the wave of trials against Polish criminals under the August decree that rolled through the Polish courts. As\n\n4\n\nChapter 1\n\nis well known since times immemorial, the state of anarchy is not conducive to the rule of law. Incidentally, this anarchic situation engendered another phenomenon that contributed to the fact that many Polish criminals-anti-Semites avoided punishment after the war: a lack of witness protection, especially of Jewish witnesses, by militiamen, who were themselves at the time targets of antiCommunist partisan attacks. Most often, Jewish witnesses to the crimes committed by Polish anti-Semites filed testimonies against the Poles in front of law enforcement authorities in the years 1944–1945; however, when in 1946–1949 the prosecutions based on these testimonies were prepared and the trials commenced, these witnesses were usually absent because they either emigrated from Poland after being intimidated by their tormentors or were killed by them. As an example, it suffices to bring up the story of the Dorogoj family, which is discussed in this book in the chapter on the crime in Radziłów. The judges did not take properly into account written testimonies, giving credence instead to the testimonies they could hear personally during the trials, and these testimonies—submitted by Polish neighbors—were usually favorable to the accused. Besides, the very state of the Polish law enforcement agencies of that era was deplorable, which contributed directly to the small number of indictments lodged against the Polish criminals. The investigations were carried out haphazardly, without due diligence, by the “people’s” investigators— often people who had just completed refresher courses and had not the necessary knowledge and experience to properly collect the evidence of crimes, hear the witnesses, or efficiently conduct trials. As a result, the collected trial evidence was in general easy to refute by lawyers for the accused, especially considering the fact that the witnesses to the crimes were fleeing the country or were killed and that the accused were solidly supported by the Polish members of the communities from which they came. Another manifestation of the negligence and omissions in these trials was the fact that the defendants usually appeared in courts while at liberty, which violated the basic principles of professional court proceedings, especially given that the defendants were accused of very grave crimes. Of course, this gave them the opportunity to intimidate the witnesses and to obstruct the case—the opportunity they eagerly exploited. It should also be remembered that the Polish witnesses to the crimes who testified at these trials were not usually guiltless either and so had no interest in testifying against their neighbors who, if convicted, would repay them in kind. We should also not forget the consequences of the amnesty announced in 1956 by Edward Ochab after he assumed the post of First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers’ Party, which proved detrimental to the Polish historical consciousness. The amnesty ordered that\n\nHow History Was Written\n\n5\n\nall pending criminal investigations under the August decree be closed and prohibited the opening of new ones, with the exception of murder cases. In practice, this amnesty closed the path for conducting any investigations against Polish criminals. In the words of Władysław Gomułka from 1945, “wise politics is capable of forgetting.”10 Twenty years later, heeding the words of Comrade “Wiesław,” Waldemar Monkiewicz, a young junior prosecutor from the District Prosecutor’s Office in Białystok assigned by the prosecutor general to the District Commission for the Investigation of Nazi War Crimes in Białystok, threw himself with zeal into a campaign of erasing the memory of Polish participation in the Holocaust during World War II and rewriting history from scratch. Of course, he was not alone in this quest: a whole group of prosecutors was involved, including Janusz Morat and Eugeniusz Kukiełka. However, Monkiewicz was the most active among them, and in time, as a reward for his achievements, he was promoted to the highest positions in the Commission. What did this process consist of? Generally speaking, in the 1960s, the witnesses to the Polish crimes committed against the Jewish people in the summer of 1941 were summoned again to the prosecutor’s office or the Commission and persuaded to provide testimony that placed direct responsibility for the crimes solely on the Germans. This made it possible to summarize Polish history with the cliché of “exclusive Nazi perpetrators” and to conceal Polish participation in the Holocaust, which was in full accordance with the then historical policy of the communist camp, in general, and of the Polish People’s Republic, in particular, that is, with the narrative that placed the guilt on the Germans from capitalist West Germany—not on our “own” members of the proletariat—for the crimes based on anti-Semitism on the territory of the Polish state. The manner of such interviews and the methods of “persuasion” used in their course by the communist junior prosecutors, including Waldemar Monkiewicz, were recalled by a “Rzeczpospolita” journalist, who after several years spoke with a participant of such a hearing: After the war, people were summoned from Radziłów for interviews to Białystok. My source could not say who interrogated them and when. He himself was also summoned. He testified that the extermination was carried out by Poles. The interrogator objected violently. “So why did you call me if you know better?” asked my interlocutor. Then the interrogator allowed him to proceed with his version, after which he was advised to keep it to himself. The trial took place in Ełk. “I did not testify truthfully in front of the court,” he admitted.11\n\nMuch light on the manner in which prosecutor Monkiewicz conducted the interrogations is shed by the testimony given by Polish woman, Julia Sokołowska, who was an eyewitness to the crime in Jedwabne. A few years\n\n6\n\nChapter 1\n\nafter the war, when a UB (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa, eng. Security Office) officer interrogated her, she made the following statement: Julia Sokołowska: A Polish Woman and Jedwabne Resident January 25, 1949, Interrogator—an Officer of the District Public Security Office in Łomża When the Germans entered the Polish territory, after a few days, the inhabitants of Jedwabne together with the Germans began to murder Jews, killing more than 1,500 people of Jewish nationality.12 I stress that I did not see the Germans beating Jews; the Germans even brought three Jewish women to the gendarmerie post and ordered me to make sure they were not murdered, so I locked them up and gave the key to a German. [. . .] Polish people bestially tormented the Jews; the Poles stood on the sides and beat them. Jews were murdered in the following manner: first, they were driven to the market and were beaten there. Later, they were given the Lenin monument, which was placed on poles; then the Jews were ordered to carry it for about four hours while the Poles walked around and made sure that the Jews would not escape. At eight o’clock, the Jews were driven outside the town, where they were herded into the barn of Bronisław Śleszyński, and there the above-mentioned Jews—over one and a half thousand people—were burned. In this murder participated those I saw myself: the leader of this action was Marian Karolak; he held a rubber truncheon and urged all the Poles to murder the Jews; I saw with my own eyes as he tortured the Jews, drove them out of apartments to the market, and beat them frightfully. Józef Wasilewski was also involved; he held a rubber truncheon, chased the Jews to the market, and viciously abused them; he is now somewhere near Szczecin. Eugeniusz Kalinowski had a stick, chased the Jews to the market, and savagely abused them. At that time, I worked as a cook at the gendarmerie post, and I saw Kalinowski report to the gendarmerie commandant, asking for weapons, because the Jews did not want to go. The commandant jumped to his feet and said, “I will not give you weapons, and do what you want.” Then Kalinowski turned back and hurried out of town to the place where the Jews were being herded; I did not see what happened later. Karol Bardoń also tormented the Jews; he had a rubber truncheon; he tortured the Jews the worst. I also saw many farmers and various people participate in this. Antoni Danowski was there; he had a rubber truncheon; he herded and drove the Jews into the barn; he tormented them. Antoni Komilski had his sleeves rolled up; I heard from Jurek Danowski that Antoni Komilski killed one\n\nHow History Was Written\n\n7\n\nJew in the field. Rogalski also played an active role in the murder of the Jews. I saw for myself as in the above-mentioned market he beat the Jews with a stick and chased them to the market and into the barn. He tormented the Jews until they were burnt. I saw with my own eyes as he stood in the market with a stick; he was about fifty years old; and he remained there until the Jews were driven into the barn and burned; then he went home. I also saw Marian Żyluk as he stood not far from the church and held something in his hand, but I did not see what it was. Stefan Lipiński stood with a stick and drove the Jews, beat them there, captured them until they were burned, and robbed a lot of property that belonged to the murdered Jews. Kazimierz Karwowski also took part in driving, beating, and herding into the barn until the Jews were burned in the barn; he also robbed many things in the barn that were left by the Jews they murdered. Józef Kobrzyński and his father took an active part in murdering the Jews; they drove them to the market and beat them with sticks; they helped to chase them to the barn, and there they burned them; they looted many things left by the Jews they murdered.\n\nHowever, when twenty-five years later Julia Sokołowska was interrogated by Waldemar Monkiewicz, he managed to manipulate her to the extent that she filed a testimony that was totally inconsistent with the previous one. Julia Sokołowska: A Polish Woman and Jedwabne Resident April 10, 1974, Interrogation by Waldemar Monkiewicz When the Germans attacked the Soviet Union and occupied Jedwabne, a German gendarmerie post was established in Jedwabne.13 This took place at the end of June 1941. The gendarmes hired me to work as a cook. I prepared for them 8 dinners a day. On July 10, 1941, in the morning, the police station commandant of a name unknown to me, medium height, gray-haired, slim, round-faced, told me that I should prepare 240 dinners. I told him that I did not have such a kettle. The commandant said that I would manage somehow. As a result, I had plenty of work. I noticed that that day a great many gendarmes drove in from other posts. Together with the local gendarmes, there were 240 people. They were gendarmes from Łomża, Kolno, and probably Stawiski. I did not know the names of those gendarmes. Of the local ones, I recall Hoffman, about 30, medium height, slim, dark blond, long face, and Radke, about 30, slim blond. On July 10, 1941, in the afternoon hours, I left the kitchen for a moment and went for smoked meats to butcher Olszewski. I observed that the gendarmes had gathered a large number of local Jews at the Jedwabne market.\n\n8\n\nChapter 1\n\nThere were men, women, and children, from the oldest to the youngest. The German gendarmes ate the dinners that I had prepared, and then I saw them drive the Jews outside the town along the Przestrzelska Street. A barn that belonged to Śleszyński stood there near the Jewish cemetery. I did not see the very moment when the Jews were being driven into this barn. The gendarmes brought three young Jewish girls to my kitchen and ordered me to guard them; next they placed them in a separate room; I do not know what purposes they served, but the commandant took care of them. I heard from the residents of Jedwabne—I do not remember from whom—that the gendarmes drove all the Jews to Śleszyński’s barn and burned them there alive. The fact is that only a few Jews remained alive. Soon, these Jews were taken to the ghetto in Łomża. Their number was more than 50. Together with these Jews, during the absence of the commandant, the three Jewish girls mentioned by me were taken from the station. One of them was called Ibramówna, the second Ismanówna, the third—I do not know what. They were 18-20 years old. None of them have been heard from since.\n\nOne does not need to be particularly familiar with the principles of forensic science to know that the testimonies submitted soon after the events are more reliable, and the extent of the distortions that prosecutor Monkiewicz was able to persuade Julia Sokołowska to make in her 1970s-era testimony is shocking. Indeed, the people he interrogated were almost always willing to ascribe to the Germans the blame for crimes committed against the Jews. There are numerous examples of the prosecutor’s manipulative investigative tactics in the files of the Commission, examples of testimonies that witnesses provided under his influence, including the role of the Germans that grew from one testimony to another; in these testimonies, the German role in Jedwabne grew in time to the size of an SS (Schutzstaffel, eng. Protection Squadron) battalion from Białystok or of Masurian Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) transported by the SS from town to town to pose as Poles and organize pogroms. The number of such testimonies manufactured primarily by him, but also by other prosecutors, reaches tens or even hundreds—and it is only for lack of space that I do not quote them all here. As an example, I will at least present the list of the perpetrators of the crimes in Bzury and Skała that was “established” by prosecutor Monkiewicz; how far these findings deviate from truth can be ascertained after reading the chapter on Szczuczyn And the Surrounding Area, in which I describe what took place in the small town and the surrounding villages. And so, Monkiewicz’s14 list included only German names: 1. Werner Fromm—SS-Gruppenführer and general major of the police, commandant of the SS and police in the Białystok district in 1941–1943;\n\nHow History Was Written\n\n9\n\n2. Otto Helwig—SS-Gruppenführer and general major of the police, commandant of the SS and police in the Białystok district from 1943 until the end of the occupation; 3. Hans Leberecht von Bradow—Colonel of the Gendarmerie Kommandeura Orpo in Białystok; 4. Eugen Dorsch—SS-Brigadeführer SS-president [?] of the police in Białystok; 5. Rachor—a kreisskommisar in Grajewo; 6. Kruspel—a kreisskommisar in Grajewo; 7. Gloksvert—director of the Gestapo post in Augustów, which oversaw the Grajewo district; 8. Beer—amtskommisar in Szczuczyn until 1942; 9. Leimann—amtskommisar in Szczuczyn from 1942 to the end of the occupation; 10. Radko—deputy amtskommisar in Szczuczyn; 11. an unidentified by name commandant of the gendarmerie post in Szczuczyn; 12. Paul—a gendarme of the gendarmerie post in Szczuczyn; 13. other gendarmes of unknown name. And here is an excerpt from the justification of an application for the prosecution of perpetrators authored by prosecutor Monkiewicz: In June, Germany attacked the Soviet Union, occupying the region of Białystok, including the Grajewo district. In Białystok, they formed “Bezirk Białystok” (administrative region). Grajewo and the area of the Grajewo district became part of this administrative unit. From the beginning, an absolute policy of extermination was implemented with respect to the local Polish as well as the Jewish populations. It was executed by all occupation authorities, including the regional authorities, such as amtskommisars and German gendarmerie posts. [. . .] The greatest number of victims was the result of the crime they committed near the village of Bzury. The gendarmes murdered 27 Jewish women there; later they murdered still other people from the village of Bzury.15\n\nIn the investigation S36/03/Zn from 2008, Jerzy Kamiński, a prosecutor from the IPN (Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, eng. Institute of National Remembrance) Branch in Białystok, upheld the main findings of prosecutor Monkiewicz and placed the responsibility for the crimes in Bzury, at the cemetery in Skaje, and other crimes in this area on the Germans. However, prosecutor Radosław Ignatiew (from the same institution) rejected these conclusions and resumed the investigation of the crimes against the Jews from Bzury.16 Regarding the decision to discontinue this investigation, dated February 22, 2013, he wrote:\n\n10\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe above facts indicate that the findings that were adopted in the S36/03/Zn investigation regarding the perpetrators of the murders of the Jewish women as “people of German origin” were based on erroneous premises. It was also wrongly assumed that the victims were executed with firearms. Such manner of loss of life does not follow from the content of the protocols of the testimony of the witnesses interrogated in the years 1970–1971 that can be found in the files of the said investigation. Accepting such conclusion only on the basis of witnesses’ declarations that the German perpetrators were allegedly armed (incidentally without specifying the weapons), therefore, should be regarded as an unjustified supposition. Also, the date of the crime as well as the number of victims did not correspond to the truth.\n\nProsecutor Ignatiew should be praised for the honesty and courage he had shown in criticizing the findings of a colleague from the prosecutor’s office. However, this does not give me peace as a citizen because one fair-minded prosecutor cannot substitute for the work of the remaining investigators. I had an opportunity to personally meet prosecutor Ignatiew and his chief, prosecutor Zbigniew Kulikowski, from the IPN Branch in Białystok, hence I know that they are courageous and uncompromising in seeking the truth. I want to express here my special thanks to prosecutor Zbigniew Kulikowski above all for his loyalty to the prosecutorial ethos. And I also thank him for the long conversations we had each time I came to Białystok to examine the files. The advice he gave me then and his kind comments are priceless. This book is based on my analysis of the material collected by the prosecutors of the investigative division of the IPN Branch in Białystok as well as on my own research of the files I discovered. A part of the cited documents can be found in the edition of archival materials Wokół Jedwabnego (Reflections on Jedwabne) edited by Paweł Machcewicz and Krzysztof Persak,17 although in my own research work, I practically did not use this source, generally using original files. The condition of the files was generally very bad, especially when it came to paper files, notebooks, investigative and court materials. Of course, I had sometimes—rarely—difficulties in reading the record of individual words or sentence phrases, which resulted not only from the poor quality of the original court records but also from such mundane circumstances as the handwriting of the person writing the files as well as the fact that the person misheard something or wrote something down incorrectly. In the second edition of the book, I gave up the anonymization of the names of the perpetrators and the Jewish victims, listening to the voices, especially from the circles of the survivors, to restore the identity of the murdered. At the same time, I admit that the decision to anonymize the names of the victims, which I made when preparing the first edition of the book, was a mistake and that I regret it. Let\n\nHow History Was Written\n\n11\n\nme also announce that I have thoroughly checked all the Jewish surnames appearing in the book to avoid possible errors and misspellings. Nevertheless, I often had to rely on their entry in archival files, usually written by clerks who had no knowledge of the sound of Jewish surnames and who did so by “ear.” By this, I mean that any errors, if any in the text, may have arisen at the stage of writing down the reports after the war and I am not responsible for them. In my work, I used eleven main research sources, that is, files of the trials that were conducted in the Polish courts under the so-called August18 decree. I have examined the files of over 700 cases, the testimonies of Jewish and Polish witnesses collected after the war, Jewish memoirs written by survivors of the extermination, and the documentation of the proceedings conducted by the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland. I have also used the dispatches and reports prepared for the Polish government in London by the Home Army, German archives Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufklärung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen (Research Center for National Socialist Crimes) in Ludwigsburg, Soviet archives, including the archives of the NKVD (Narodnyi Kommissariat Vnutrennykh Del, eng. People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs) handed over to Polish investigators after 1989, materials from the investigations conducted by the Investigative Division of the IPN Branch in Białystok, and the testimonies of witnesses recorded after 1989. I have adopted the premise that I should study sources multidimensionally, examining the discussed problems from different perspectives—historical, documentary, political, moral, and psychological. The historical approach was relatively clear. Considering the time that has elapsed since 1945, it cannot be claimed that it would be useless to reconstruct the historical context—the many situations and the biographical and ideological facts that led to the extermination of Jews in the summer of 1941 and in later years in Poland and whose result was a relentless anti-Semitic campaign in the areas of Polish Podlasie that was carried out by the Nazis with the participation of the organizational structures of the Polish nationalist underground. I believe that the documentary aspect is fundamental among those that I had to present, even though I did not always have complete, fully legible archival materials at my disposal. For example, this was the case with the data regarding the Jedwabne crime—the data were extensive, but at the same time very contradictory; I had less data regarding the Szczuczyn pogrom and even less about the massacre of Jews in Suchowola, and so on. It is only by comparing data and patiently reproducing the information drawn from different testimonies that I was able to obtain a sufficiently faithful picture of what actually happened. On the basis of this picture, I could also attempt to answer the question of why it happened at all and what\n\n12\n\nChapter 1\n\nmechanisms guided the human actions. Photographs are an integral part of the extermination story presented in this book. They constitute a separate, somewhat more basic structure of the narrative, the next level of the terrifying image that emerges from the story. This is because as Susan Sontag wrote: To remember is more often not only to recall a story but also to be able to associate an image with it. Even a writer as adapt in the modernist and serious literature of the nineteenth century as W.G. Sebald decided to weave photographs in between his stories—photographs depicting the mourning of lives lost, lost nature-scapes, and lost cityscapes. Sebald was not simply elegiac—he was a fighting author of elegy. By remembering, he wanted the reader to remember as well. Tormenting photos should not lose the power to shock. But they are not worth much when it comes to understanding. Stories can help us understand. Photographs have a different function—they haunt us. Take one of the unforgettable pictures from the war in Bosnia, which the foreign correspondent for The New York Times, John Kifner, described with the words, “The picture is strong and belongs to the most memorable pictures of the Balkan War. The Serbian volunteer casually kicks a dying Muslim woman in the head. This picture says it all.” Of course, a picture does not say it all.19\n\nThat is why the other keys used in this book—politics, morality, e­ motions— have no lesser importance, only a different value, depending on the community being addressed. The political perspective can be useful because I am addressing the young generation, which often knows nothing about the past or about its shadows. For the older generations that also have not been tainted with the stamp of Nazism, it may be a useful moral illumination that will prompt reflection, arouse doubts, and even feelings of guilt. As for emotions, there are many harrowing passages in this book that are not fit to be read by a true scientist who investigates that which can be captured in reproducible experiments in the laboratory. Following Bruno Bettelheim, one may state: It is undoubtedly easier to overlook reality when facing it means undertaking an initiative which is as unpleasant as difficult. To admit that one is ignoring reality for selfish reasons would engender feelings of guilt. In order not to feel guilt, one avoids doing certain things and denies the existence of facts.20\n\nThis is precisely what happens in the case of Polish anti-Semitism and Polish participation in deportations, persecution, and extermination: facts and a scientific approach to the issue are negated to preserve the “myth of innocence” that has been inculcated with the aid of the “history of good feelings” that was written for short-term political goals.\n\nHow History Was Written\n\n13\n\nA few years ago, I faced the question of when should one study? Now, immediately, if possible. Much time has been irretrievably lost since the end of World War II, something which is difficult to justify today. One may only attempt to understand. Actions such as the “investigations” by prosecutor Waldemar Monkiewicz in the 1970s that were aimed at falsifying Polish participation in the Holocaust and, more broadly, the actions of the Polish communists aimed at concealing the crimes of the political opponents from prewar Polish right to preserve the image of worker-peasant sacrifice and hide the image of worker-peasant crime, and, finally, the actions of Polish historians after 1989 that were driven by similar motives engender not only opposition but also the thought that no further delay can be tolerated. The last witnesses of the tragic Polish history are leaving us. Let anniversaries be celebrated and international congresses, scientific roundtables, and specialist symposia be organized. These are good opportunities to confirm that the memory of what has passed will remain, even though in time the witnesses to the events will pass away. But even if much has been written, documented, or analyzed in previous years, there will still remain the need to preserve the past events in memory to make the continuation of research possible. It is only when the attention of the public opinion is directed to certain facts that one can say that the memory of those who had perished has been properly honored. That is the goal that has served as my beacon. Why should we study? This appears to be a rhetorical question. However, only few people understand that it is necessary to fight not only against time, which obscures everything, levels, and destroys, but also with man who desires to forget sad events. And we must also fight against our civilization, which is preoccupied with the present day while avoiding the problems of both the past and the future. Nazism, regardless of the form in which it manifested itself, should still be examined and considered, if only because historically it did not end in 1945. Research should be carried out not only because neo-Nazism appears in the modern world but also because what we call Nazism is a part of us, it is— potentially—in us, in each of us. It can only be fought by knowing exactly what was done under its name so that no one could say as before: we did not know, we did not believe it, it seemed impossible. Speaking about the extermination, Bettelheim wrote: It is understandable that one wants to avoid looking at the reflection of the deep experiences that appear on the face of someone who managed to survive, someone who was a witness to destruction, someone as a defenseless victim. We need to understand and introduce into our vision of the world the fact that\n\n14\n\nChapter 1\n\nsuch terrible experiences lead to an avoidance of confrontation, to the negation of some of the troubling aspects of the problem.21\n\nInstead of reacting to facts as soon as the first signs of Nazi persecution appeared—the signs of what developed rapidly—people used many pretexts to deny everything to feel safe: Negation is the first, the most primitive, the least useful, the most ineffective of all forms of psychological defense used by man. When a situation is potentially destructive, it becomes the most dangerous defense because it prohibits making the right decision that could protect us from real danger. So, negation leaves the individual completely powerless in the face of a danger one needs to defend against.22\n\nThe negation of the existence of the towns of death has for decades functioned in the same way. What happened in the Białystok region in the summer of 1941 in Jedwabne, Radziłów, Szczuczyn, Rajgród, and dozens of other places was horrid, almost unimaginable. However, only by knowing the facts will we be able to confront that part of our nature that might be tempted to return to the actions undertaken by those people, those Poles, of that era as direct participants—or the more or less interested bystanders—in a singular tragedy that transcends human understanding. When after the end of the war many Germans declared that they never suspected that concentration camps existed (about which they read daily in newspapers), [. . .] it was either a patent lie or a desire not to know anything, even though they could have easily learned the truth. They preferred (subconsciously) to ignore this truth.23\n\nThis book arose primarily to make continued lying and ignorance impossible.\n\nNOTES 1.

Catholic totalism was the fundamental idea among the thinkers of the National Radical Camp (ONR) and the National Party (SN); it was also employed by the principal leaders of the entire Polish nationalist right wing. On its basis, this movement built a conceptual dichotomy involving the good totalitarianism— which, in their understanding, was desirable for Poland—and of “a religious and Catholic totalitarianism,” which they contrasted with “the totalitarianism of the state” in the Soviet1 or fascist style. The ONR activists referred to themselves as “totalitarian” thinkers and activists. In their manifestos, they wrote: “Neither parliamentary democracy nor a class system nor a total party system but a hierarchical organization can constitute a lasting force.”2 Illustrative in this regard is an article that appeared in “Ruch Młodych” (The Youth Movement), a journal of the interwar extreme right, under the title Totalizm nie jest sprzeczny z katolicyzmem3 (Totalism Is Not Contrary to Catholicism). There, the following view is expressed: “As long as it represents an idea consistent with Catholicism, totalism in our times is desirable.”4 The Catholic totalists put these ideas into practice during their practical education work with young people, encouraging them, for example, to perform the fascist greeting—the so-called “Roman salute”—in front of the Polish flag during summer camps for children, Fig. 2. 1. Moreover, as described by eminent Polish historians Jerzy J. Terej5 and Jan Józef Lipski,6 the program of the National Radical Camp called for the construction of a hierarchically organized society and state, headed by a leader atop the totalitarian-state hierarchy. ONR and National Democracy (pol. 17\n\n18\n\nChapter 2\n\nFigure 2.1 Summer Camps Organized by S.S.

Such an attitude also led them to relish attacking liberal Christian circles (albeit few in number in the Second Polish Republic) that grew out of the Christian personalism trend, often calling them crypto-masons, Jews, communists, and so on. Of course, the totalism of USSR Communists, as being detached from Catholicism, and the fascist totalism that was celebrating its triumphs in Germany, as bearing neo-pagan features, were also treated by the Catholic totalists from the ONR and the nationalist circles with great reserve. This restrained attitude, however, varied over time and depended on current political events. The idea of Catholic totalitarianism was just as emphatically expressed by the activists of the national camp in the program to build the Catholic State of the Polish Nation, which was supposed to be a religious state, that is, a state\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n19\n\ncontrolled by “a unified worldview” and a single Catholic elite and party. The words uttered by the National Democratic activist and chairman of the Rzeszow National Party district, Witold Nowosad, at Jasna Góra, after the famous oath of academic youth on May 24, 1936, are of great significance: We want to fight for the City of God, a country that was extolled so eloquently by great Saint Augustine 1,500 years go. [. . .] We want to fight for the reign of Christ the King on Earth. [. . .] We want to [. . .] bring the Kingdom of Christ to Great Poland, for which we fight. [. . .] We are calling on Jasna Góra to the Most Holy Mother [. . .] to help us create out of our Fatherland the CATHOLIC COUNTRY OF THE POLISH NATION!!! For us, God and Nation are inseparable ideals, and that generation in Poland that to our ruin would want to separate these ideals will be wretched and even accursed.7\n\nThis ideological declaration is a testimony to a fundamentalist approach to religion and its place in the social, political, and cultural life of the future totalitarian society that the Polish nationalist of the interwar period wanted to build in Poland. Of course, it is also clear that totalitarianism, regardless of the adjective used to describe it, always remains a totalitarianism in which violence touches all but the obedient and conformist servants of the regime. Mainly for this reason, the nationalist circles in Poland, including the ONR, had difficulties proving that the propagation of totalitarian ideas remains in line with the integrationist ideas of the Catholic church; fortunately, such attempts evoked strong resistance among the progressive and personalist church circles of the time. The right-wing publicist Wojciech Wasiutyński deplored this situation: “Using the campaign against totalism, attempts were made to drive a wedge between the nationalists and the Church.”8 The Catholic thinkers closely allied with the falangists and the nationalists were, nevertheless, great enthusiasts of the ideas they proclaimed. According to them, Catholicism faced a unique historical opportunity to become a religion of a national movement that drove toward political victory in interwar Poland. Nationalism and Catholicism were to become the foundation of both the new political movement and the future state built by this movement. The falangists themselves also clearly indicated that the ideology that was to become the “spirit” of their movement and the future system was Catholic and nationalistic in nature. Jan Józef Lipski claimed that the framework of the totalitarian idea expressed by the National Radical Camp circles and the nationalists consisted in the following: first, power within the state and society should be fully concentrated in the hands of members of the National Party and the National Radical Camp; second, this power was to be exercised exclusively by the apparatus of state violence; third, the political system of such a Catholic state was to assume a one-party character and be associated with the dictatorship of one party controlled by the Political Organization of the Polish Nation;\n\n20\n\nChapter 2\n\nfourth, Polish society and the national ruling party were to be organized hierarchically in military fashion with the chief dictator at the head; fifth, the so-constructed state apparatus was to use force, terror, and propaganda toward the citizenry; sixth, the state was to confer upon itself the right to create economic and social plans that were binding on all the citizens; seventh, the state sanctioned only one single Catholic ideology that fulfills the historical mission of the Polish nation. Only at the very end, using its apparatus of ideological terror, the state was to turn to the nation for its support, which by no means was a precondition for the existence of the thus-constructed Poland but rather a consequence of the terror, indoctrination, and censorship imposed by the state upon its citizens. In the area of youth education, the national circles patterned themselves on the Nazi and Soviet models: The conviction about the possibility of transforming and improving the psychology of not just an individual but also of a social group, which is the nation, through conscious and planned educational activity [. . .], emerges in such endeavors as fascist, hitlerite, or Soviet education.9 Kierck rightly observes (in the Nationalpolitische Erziestur) that a student must be simply instilled with certain strictly defined ideals and religious, national, and social dogmas.10\n\nNext, national camp thinkers turned this type of image of state and social reality that was built upon the ideas of Catholic integrism and totalitarianism into a ruthless critique of democracy and the parliamentary system. They subjected parliamentary democracy to relentless criticism, although they themselves extolled that bizarre political creature they called Catholic National Democracy that would be created, according to their plan, through an overthrow organized by a small group of terrorists—fighters from the ONR—or as a result of an all-right national uprising. Indeed, as a rule, the national ideologues rejected parliamentary elections as a means for attaining power in a state, which manifested itself in the boycotts of the general election that were organized by national party activists in the 1930s. The uprising was to be started with the goal of realizing the people’s desire to build a Catholic, nationalist Poland. These desires, as was obvious to the nationalists, could not be fulfilled in general elections due to the actions of the groups that exercised real, yet secret, power in the Polish and the world democracy—that is, the Jews and the communists, whom they hated. Incidentally, this is the place where such a clear anti-Semitic element first appeared in the national ideology. Ultimately, it is only after assuming power by coup or armed uprising that the nationalists planned to “gain the support” of the nation by using\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n21\n\nterror and censorship against the nation.11 According to the ideologues of the movement, an alternative to such a “national democracy”—a clearly evil and ruinous one for Poland—was parliamentary democracy, which was “evil” for being the construct of dark Jewish-Masonic forces that wielded the behindthe-scenes control over the Polish nation and its political elections. In his book on the ONR ideology, Lipski wrote that to gain an approximate understanding of the falangist worldview, it is enough to read any article by third-rate extreme-right political writers who best expressed “the worldview of an ordinary ONR club-wielding goon.” That is, it is not necessary to read the works of intellectuals such as Wojciech Wasiutyński, Marian Reutt, or Włodzimierz Sznarbachowski, who with beautifully sculpted and learned phrases could obscure the entire ideological picture. However, if we read ordinary, everyday articles in “Falanga” and “Sztafeta” or in the magazines published by the National Party in Podlasie, we will find there a description of the modern world as seen with “the rightist eyes,” that is, a world ruled by “Jewish political work organizations,” meaning the rule by secret Jewish, Masonic, and other organizations whose external manifestations were democracy and liberalism.12 Mussolini stated that “fascism is an organized, centralized, and authoritarian democracy” [. . .]. Speaking about national socialism, Goebbels said: “The national revolution has given the Germans the most noble form of modern, European democracy. [. . .] Why should the monopoly for the use of the name democracy belong only to Blum or Lloyd George and not, for example, to Mussolini or Hitler?”13\n\nThe above quotation points to one more interesting aspect of the intellectual chaos among the nationalists. They promoted the idea of equality of members of the Polish nation but only within the hierarchical governing structure of that nation (which, in any case, was bestowed by the party)—the dictatorship of the national party established through a coup. In a word, the equality of all was to be a condition for the existence of the Catholic totalitarian state; at the same time, however, the place occupied by an individual in this “egalitarian hierarchy” (sic) was to be determined through an arbitrary decision of an ONR party activist. Of course, this hierarchy of society and party—after all, society was to be ruled by one Catholic party united body and soul with the nation—was to be established by the national activists themselves who, by definition, were obviously the best sons and daughters of the Commonwealth. Therefore, in their political plans, an individual could gain a position in the social hierarchy exclusively by being nominated by a superior figure in the rightist establishment. Clearly, a hierarchy built upon the superior-subordinate relationship\n\n22\n\nChapter 2\n\nwas presumed never to face the problem of a subordinate being more rational and capable than the superior, Lipski observed. The idea presented by the nationalists, of course, also assumed that not only individuals but also entire nations are in such a hierarchical relationship, which led them to conclude that Poles can dominate Jews and Ukrainians like superiors over subordinates. This was the argument typical of German nationalists but also, as a rule, of European romantics, who opposed the rule of enlightenment and rational electoral law by pointing to its soullessness and a lack of intrinsic mystical spirituality as well as pure folk justice. The German nationalists contrasted this with the “souls of the blond Germanic beasts” that did not require democratic voting, while the ND and ONR contrasted this with the spiritual perfection of a Catholic Pole. Moreover, the criticism of democracy and parliamentarism in the National Radical Camp’s version was linked to the criticism of the most important ideas in democracy, that is, the political pluralism—both custom based and moral—and tolerance. Since in their model of the totalitarian and religious state the nationalists assumed that it must be the depository of the only “absolute truth,” that is, Catholic and national, they considered the pluralism of ideas as the gravest sin of democracy in the Second Polish Republic, which had to be eradicated as soon as possible. For the same reasons, Polish rightwing nationalists detested the next foundation of a democratic state governed by the rule of law, that is, “the rule of the people.” They called it scornfully as “a governments by public opinion,” which in their understanding meant the rule by “dumb and contemptible” burghers, which, by the way, was a criticism of liberalism drawn from both the Marxist as well as the German romantic and Catholic ideas. The nationalists also criticized democracy for its anarchy as well as for its extolling the national faults of the Polish nobility such as “litigiousness” and “factiousness.” In their opinion, only a totalitarian state whose strength derives from its police apparatus can deal with the anarchy of the democrats. It is a matter of concern that as early as the 1930s, as a condition for destroying their hated democracy, the nationalists proposed to solve the so-called Jewish question with force—getting rid of Jews as a natural, in their opinion, backbone of democracy. Similarly, on the eve of the war, they demanded that “the democratic agencies” in Poland be destroyed.14 There are organized, stable, economically powerful, deliberate Jewish, communist, and Masonic forces whose reason for existence is to prevent the psychological and civilizational uniformity of the Nation.15 The three hostile forces are Jewry, Communism and Masonry [. . .]. Jewry [. . .] is superior to the other two forces in Poland.16\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n23\n\nOf course, the “Jewish” structures of public life described by the main nationalist ideologies17 refer to Jewish Masonry, that is—according to ND and ONR activists—the de facto structure responsible for the form of democracy in interwar Poland. At the same time, the ONR often used concepts synonymous with “masonry” to also attack non-masonic organizations with which they competed in the political arena and which derived mainly from the sanation camp. Therefore, they often referred to “the government of secret organizations.”18 The sentence “Democracy—a Jewish nineteenth century bastard”19 expresses the essence of ONR’s thinking regarding the critique of democracy. The criticism of both liberalism and communism was similar in basic outline; the nationalists presented both of these movements as emanations of “Jewishness.” Built upon such an ideological foundation and expressed through totalitarian as well as anti-democratic and anti-Semitic demands, a fierce criticism of capitalism arose within the nationalist circles of the Second Polish Republic as a system economically bad in every respect because, springing up from Jewish foundations, it is detrimental to healthy Christian social relations and destructive to the spirit of Aryanness.20 For this reason, the falangists and the ND members happily proclaimed the demise of this dangerous Jewish economic system and intended to actively contribute to its destruction. According to the nationalists, capitalism was to be replaced by an economic system based on . . . national love. Of course, Aryan love for Aryans, Poles for Poles, and Catholics for Catholics. The plan was under no circumstances to encompass strangers, dissenters, and certainly Jews within this circle of redemptive love. Moreover, in such love-based Polish society organized along military lines, its main goal was to fulfill the needs of the working masses and not the generation of profits. According to the nationalists, love, hierarchy, and obedience are the embodiment of the idea of Catholic integralism in real life. “Capitalism is immoral.”21 And here is an admonition that was taken for granted by the right-wing circles of the Second Polish Republic: “In the capitalist system, Jews always win.”22 Moreover, the destructive Jewish influences were purported to manifest themselves in their ruinous role, a striving to bring about the destruction of the noble and idealistic Polish “spirituality.” According to the ND, this was evident in the materialism that was destructive to the “Polish soul”—whose emanation was capitalism—that was ascribed to the Jews. They declared an open war against it and the Jews. People interested in the Jewish question know that the old culture of Israel was thoroughly materialistic.23 Anyone who wants to destroy the capitalist system must be an anti-Semite.24\n\n24\n\nChapter 2\n\nIn the capitalist system, Jewry will always do well. [. . .] The motto of the Polish working masses is to destroy Jewry along with capitalism! And it is not a class but a national struggle. It is Poles fighting Jews!25\n\nAnother ideological foundation of the nationalist circles represented by the ND and, in particular, the National Radical Camp was their proclaimed racism.26 The primacy of racism in national ideology was declared by Roman Dmowski who, in one of his articles, famously declared that he is not a “true chauvinist” because he places the white race above “the Negro barbarian” race even if the white people belonged to a nation hostile to the Polish nation.27 Dmowski also stressed the role of instinct—a biological, hence a racial factor—in which he perceived the essence of the national bond.28 An individual who has for generations been integrally interconnected with his nation in a certain wide sphere of activities does not have his own will but must submit to the collective will of the nation, of all of its generations, that is expressed through inherited instincts.29\n\nThe thesis of the father of the Polish national ideology was also creatively developed by other nationalists and ideologists of the National Radical Camp, who in their statements underscored that the civil and legal differences between a Pole and non-Pole should be contrasted with the biological and racial differences between “a Jew” and “an Aryan.” Marian Reutt and Jerzy Hagmajer used such a typology that was typical of the ONR circles. At the same time, “an Aryan”—identified with a Pole—was depicted exclusively in contrast to the Jew—“a non-Aryan.” Moreover, in ND literature, Polishness was for all intent and purposes defined only in opposition to “Jewishness.” The only proper discriminant of Polish identity in the totalitarian ideology of the Polish right-wing circles was the hated “figure of the Jew.” It is extremely interesting that the ideologues of this totalitarian doctrine did not perceive in this mental construction, constituting Polishness, the role of the Semite. The racist ideology of the National Democrats and the ONR also required the creation of a language for its expression.30 Here, it is only worth to quote Lipski, who observed that the term “Aryans” served as a special category in this racist newspeak. This word had a distinct evaluative quality for ONR activists. It was never used in a context bespeaking of its negative connotations. That which was Aryan was by definition always good, heroic, and sublime! To be Aryan, therefore, meant at least to possess many good qualities. Its register included the notion that only the Aryan could create art and poetry that served his Aryan nation.31 By referring to biological conditions, the constructed racist tool of ideological differentiation between Jew and Aryan made it also possible for\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n25\n\nthe Polish right wingers to strengthen their beliefs in their own all-Polish greatness. In their view, such greatness was supposed to ensue from the well-proven fact that the Aryan Germans were de facto descended from the Polabian Slavs, whom they assimilated, which purportedly led the Germanic race (and this is particularly interesting) to . . . insanity. At the same time, they were also descended from . . . the Jews and, therefore, have never been pure Aryans. And, the purest of all the Aryans and the most Aryan of Aryans were, of course, only the Poles. Lipski rightly observed that truly breakneck intellectual acrobatics is required first to recognize the superiority of the Slavs over the Germans and then to proclaim that the assimilation of both nations contributed to the madness of the Germanic race. The theory of Professor Samuel Weinbaum from the Jewish University in Jaffa that was promoted on the pages of Katowice’s “Kuźnica,” one of the organs of the ONR, requires similar intellectual acrobatics. On the basis of this theory, Falanga’s ideologues began to claim that the Germans and their Germanic ancestors were colonized by seventeen thousand Jews around 127 B.C., for which they deserve the deep contempt of the Polish Aryans. Besides the patent absurdity of this thesis, it is worth noting that Polish anti-Semites were not inhibited in promoting the theory of a professor from a Jewish university. The totalitarian ideologies of the Polish nationalists were ready to assimilate every fiction and every absurdity. The racism openly proclaimed by the Polish nationalists became problematic for the national movement after the publication of Pius XI’s encyclical Mit brennender Sorge because the national movement wanted at the same time to be regarded Catholic to attain power with the support of the clergy. Therefore, the movement found it difficult to hold and propagate racist and anti-Semitic views after the appearance of an encyclical that directly condemned such views. Nationalist publicists extricated themselves from this quandary by introducing another vague differentiation called “racist antiSemitism” into their terminology—which they suddenly began to reject after the release of the encyclical—and “economic anti-Semitism” as well as “religious anti-Semitism,” which they began to promote with even greater zeal. Of course, for the average club-wielding goon from the Białystok region, this kind of distinction was of no importance as long as the whole ideology was aimed at the Jews. Another reason for the nationalists’ hatred of Jews, at least in the perspective of their continually stressed Catholicism, was the argument that pointed to them as “Christ killers”: “They killed Christ, and now they want to fashion a protective shield out of his teachings.”32 The nationalists tried to show that their anti-Semitism was very much compatible with the Catholic spirit, invoking most of all the person and the teachings of Pope Paul IV. They also widely invoked the tradition of the Polish Church and, especially,\n\n26\n\nChapter 2\n\nthe Wieluń synod resolution of 1420 that forbade Christians to socialize and trade with Jews and prohibited Jews to acquire houses and hire Christians as servants.33 The relationship between the nationalists and the Catholic Church was probably best described by one of the ideologues of the movement, Władysław J. Grabski: “How can we express our appreciation for the service of the Polish priests to the nation? Because their unrecognized work has been protecting customs and guarding the purity of the race.”34 The relationship constructed in this manner between the anti-Semitism of the National Democrats and the ONR on the one side and the Catholic Church on the other did not hamper the brass-knuckled, club-wielding members the Polish right-wing circles. It was quickly grasped that since “Jewry is evil” in the metaphysical and moral sense, it is precisely the catholicity proclaimed by the falangists that compels them to fight this evil. Thus, they formulated a program of Catholicism backed up with fists raised against Jews. Love is also the mother of hatred—the hatred of evil. Being a Christian does not mean being an incompetent who allows evil to spread. And, living in diaspora, the Jewish nation spreads evil everywhere and sows destruction.35 Catholic youth cannot fall for deceptive humanitarianism.36\n\nThe position of the ONR members regarding the relationship between German fascism and Catholicism became complicated after the appearance of the Pius XI encyclical and with the rising political tension between the Third Reich and Poland. The earlier enthusiastic apologias of Nazism were replaced by its cautious criticism. Instead, Polish fascists and national socialists continually proclaimed their high regard for the Catholic religion, as Olgierd Grott splendidly presented in his work.37 He analyzed the publications of the National Socialist Party that were representative of the entire Polish fascist community and demonstrated that they expressed high approval for Christianity and faith in Christ38 and the desire to eradicate everything that “does not comport with the Polish and Christian character of Poland,”39 meaning, of course, Jewry and Communism. The concept of the Pole-Catholic was very clearly present in the consciousness of PNS (Partia Narodowych Socjalistów, eng. National Socialist Party) supporters. The party also perceived the fight with religion as an attempt to destroy the Polish nation, a struggle consciously undertaken, naturally, by Jews.40 An equally engaged attitude toward religion and the Catholic Church can be found in the program and the writings of another National Socialist party—the Radical Movement of Healing (Radykalny Ruch Uzdrowienia)—which since 1937 operated under the name of the National-Radical Healing Movement (Narodowo-Radykalny\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n27\n\nRuch Uzdrowienia). In his writings, its leader—Józef Kowal-Lipiński—was much more emotional in expressing his views on Catholic religion.41 From the end of the 1930s, within the national movement, especially among the radicals of the ONR, there was a growing conviction that to solve the Jewish question, it is necessary to imitate Hitler’s Germany,42 notwithstanding the unifying encyclical announced by the Pope. “We believe that it is necessary to familiarize ourselves with the German experience regarding the Jewish question and use it to draw conclusions appropriate to the Polish situation.”43 Such a positive assessment of Hitlerism and its criminal attitude toward Jews was related to certain lunatic concepts in the area of foreign policy that the nationalists wanted to implement after taking over the government in Poland. According to these concepts, relations with fascist Germany were to be based on a strategic partnership aimed at crushing Jews in both countries. After exterminating Jews, the Polish nationalists planned to defeat the “Nazi neo-paganism” in the Third Reich and, as in Poland, achieve the victory of “Catholic integralism.” Afterward, together with the Catholic and, as in Poland, totalitarian Germans, they planned to jointly attack and defeat Bolshevik Russia. Moreover, even the eventual collapse of the Third Reich in conflict with Poland would not mark the end of the march of anti-Semitism in Europe. In that situation, the sacred torch of anti-Semitism was to be carried on by the brave men of the ONR. [Jews] assume that Hitler’s defeat will mean an automatic end to anti-Semitism. Vain and stupid hopes [. . .]. That war will not save you.44 The Jewish question is the most important. [. . .] Today, as never before, there is an opportunity to solve it.45\n\nThe date of this declaration is significant. “Today” refers to July 30, 1939, that is, one month before the outbreak of the war that led to a near-total destruction of Jews in Poland and in Europe. In this respect, the plans of the German and Polish anti-Semites coincided. Moreover, the “solution of the Jewish question” in Poland and Europe was viewed as a prelude to the destruction of communism in Russia because of the obvious (to Polish nationalists) alliance between communists and Jews.46 However, it was completely not the case that the anti-Semitic rhetoric within those circles intensified with the approach of World War II. In fact, it was always intransigent toward Jews. It is worth to quote excerpts of an anti-Jewish program published in Warsaw in 1891 on the pages of “Głos” to which the ideologues of the National Democracy referred to repeatedly\n\n28\n\nChapter 2\n\non many occasions. Anti-Semitic and chauvinistic ideological schemes can be found not only in the literature of the National Radical Camp itself or the National Party but also in the organs and publications even loosely associated with the structures of both parties such as Katowice’s “Kuźnica (The Forge)” owned by the ONR-Phalange press, “Młoda Polska (The Young Poland), “Pro Christo”47 of Marian priests, “Komunikat SARP (SARP Communiqué),” which for a time was taken over by the Falangists, the daily “Jutro (Tomorrow),” and the right-wing periodicals, for example, “Podlasiak (resident of Podlasie/Podlachia)” or “Rózga Podlaska (Podlasian Twig).” Let one of the first issues of “Rózga Podlaska” serve as a sample of such a text. It is difficult to imagine an example that better defines “hate speech”: The most despicable and the most gangrenous, rotten, spoilt race in the world is the Jewish race, and in its aspirations, it is the most vile and brutal. . . . Jews—they are the outcasts of humanity! Jews—they are the dregs of nations! Jews, you are so sordid, you have deserved punishment ever since you appeared on earth. You call yourselves a chosen people—indeed, it is Satan who chose you as a tool for spreading evil and the sins of degradation . . . You are a tribe eternally creeping, closed within itself—an abject animal . . . It is enough for me to look at the crowds of Jews milling in the streets to get the impression that I am looking at large swarms, a huge morass of stinking mud and stool . . . It is enough for me to look at a head of a sidelock-wearing, animal hair-covered Jew, at those hungry tiger eyes full of vindictiveness bordering on insanity, at those pursed lips which seem about to open like the abyss of a crater and spew the lava of invective on everything that believes in the cross and that is Polish! Jews—they are liars! Jews—they are blood-sucking leeches! There has never lived a nation under the sun more vengeful and greedier of murder and blood than the Jews. Filled with all manner of anger, avarice, envy, and hatred, the Jews are our plague, our burden, our misfortune.48\n\nThe language of such pronouncements may seem artificial to the modern reader; however, similarly written manifestos are not uncommon in the press of this type. The syntactic similarity of the article to a prayer (numerous repetitions, especially in the last sentence) and the changing addressee of the statements (once Jews, once countrymen) is striking. The accumulation of comparisons and words with negative attributes (plague, burden,\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n29\n\nunhappiness, hatred, anger, avarice, envy, invective, murders) reinforces the full of contempt and hatred tenor of the article.49 Jan Józef Lipski wrote that chauvinism and nationalism were the fundamental concepts on which both the ONR and the broadly understood Polish National Democratic movement were based. Polish chauvinism and nationalism presumed the quest to dominate other nations within its sphere of interests, which, of course, had to lead to conflicts with those nations. At the same time, the basic criterion for resolving such conflicts was, according to Polish nationalism and chauvinism, the raison d’être and interest of one’s own nation. However, it does not follow from even the most extreme interpretations of the concepts of nationalism and chauvinism that the so-defined “enemy nation” must be biologically exterminated or deprived of national identity. In this sense, the anti-Semitism presented by the Polish extreme right—if only considered in the light of the statements quoted above about disposing of the Jews—was a particular type of nationalism and chauvinism, and it must be discussed separately. In the nationalism and chauvinism of the Polish national right, anti-Semitism played a special role. It recognized the impossibility of both denationalization of Jews and their subordination. According to ONR activists, the unsuitability of Jews to denationalization or subordination derived from the very nature of Jewish culture, which made Jews separate and unable to assimilate both in the psychological and the cultural-moral dimensions. For this reason, Jews were thought to be organically incapable of living within the structures of any state; at the same time, they dreamed of ruling the world, which made them most dangerous to the functioning of the Polish state. This thesis was clearly voiced by Jan Olechowski, a prose writer and poet associated with the “Falange”: “The Jewish question is above all an ethical question. The Jewish ethics of the Talmud and the Jewish psychology are not only foreign to the Polish spirit but, above all, also absolutely harmful.”50 In the right-wing literature, the Jewish culture—due to its inherent materialism—also became a depository of moral evil and an exponent of all “moral decay,” similar to the Jewish art which, according to right-wing aesthetes (?), possessed no value. From here, there was but a single step to identifying Jews and their culture with Satanism and eschatological evil because Satanism has for centuries been associated with the cult of the materialistic element. And indeed, Polish right-wing writers made such a step by tying Judaism to Satanic religion. There is a spirit of Satanism in Judaism [. . .].51 The Satanic root of Evil is the organized and fanatical international Jewish mafia.52\n\n30\n\nChapter 2\n\nIn addressing this issue, Jan Józef Lipski wrote the following: The transfer of the issue to the metaphysical plane with the accompanying undertones of horror and the Manichean division of the world into that which is Jewish—and, therefore, in its essence evil—and that which is non-Jewish and endangered by the Satan and his servant—the Jew—had a number of socio-technical and propagandistic benefits: a simplified picture of reality that saturated its psychological coloration with concepts and attitudes that were familiar to every Pole-Christian since childhood and were rooted in myths conveyed in thousands of sacral works of art that depicted the devil and reached deep into the subconscious. Such transfer served as a good starting point for an emotional mobilization around the program of a political group, and it provided the grounds and the justification for acts of hatred and violence.53\n\nHaving thus prepared the metaphysical ground by identifying Jews with the forces of darkness, the ONR ideologists proceeded to justify excluding Jews from all state and public activities and depriving them of access to offices and work in public administration, opportunities to engage in political activity and study, and, finally, of all other civil rights, even the right to run a business. Moreover, all evil that the nationalists discerned in their surrounding reality derived from this “devil’s brood”—the Jews. Besides, identifying Jews with metaphysical evil allowed the national circles to point to their link with Masonic organizations that were equally “bad” for being anti-Catholic and to blame the Jewish-Masonic alliance for conniving in and secretly directing party activities in Poland and the world. This was one of the main motifs present in the literature of the nationalists from the interwar period. In addition to Bolesław Piasecki, Wasiutyński and Reutt excelled in forming similar theses. After establishing the relationship between the Jews, evil, and the Satan and next with masonry, the right-wing literature needed to describe the relationship between the Jews and communists, a relationship whose existence was completely obvious to Polish nationalists and was beyond discussion. Of course, right-wing ideologues were irreconcilable enemies of communism at least since 1920; at the same time, however, they claimed that just like fascism it could be used as a model for the political workings of Catholic totalism in Poland. Even more amazingly, ONR ideologues were at the same time supporters of Stalin’s dictatorship. They justified this by citing his defeat of the “Trotskyite Jew” and, in the internal struggle for power in the Soviet camp, for pushing internationalist Jews in the Bolshevik Party aside, thereby proclaiming Russia’s break with the policy of global communist-Jewish revolution in favor of the idea of building communism in one country.\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n31\n\nOf course, the negative attitude of the right to communism, if only because of the latter’s hostility toward the Catholic religion, remained unshakeable. In general, according to “Falange” writers, Marxism derived from the “Jewish spirit” and the tradition of Judaism, but there were also those who were convinced that Marxism arose specifically to dismantle and destroy the Aryan states in Europe.54 At the same time, ONR supporters explained the conflict between the “Jewish democratic capitalism” and the equally Jewish Marxism by claiming that communism was nothing but “capitalism turned into a state,”55 so basically they were the same, that is, both were ruled by the same Jews (!). Moreover, the nationalized capitalism, that is Marxism, even more than “pure” capitalism itself, embodied, according to the National Democrats, the “Jewish spirit” because it expressed so typical to the Jewish culture love of law and administration that were reflections of the love of the Talmud and the rabbinate in Judaism. In total, “Jews today as in any age constitute a unity, are guided by one policy, and strive toward a single goal [. . .]. This goal is to rule the world.”56 As a consequence of these findings, the ideologists of the Polish right formulated a thesis that Jews are Poland’s greatest enemy because they are the largest and the most dangerous “internal” invader of the Poles. Dmowski was the first to express this view in 1902 in an article titled Myśli nowoczesnego Polaka (The Thoughts of a Modern Pole) that was published in “Przegląd Wszechpolski (All-Poland Review).” In this article, he concluded that Jews are an “internal enemy” of the Poles, more dangerous than political invaders, that is, the Germans and the Russians. Despite all, we must compare the struggle against Jewry to a struggle against invaders.57 Name-calling about club-wielding goons or bandits is useless. The same people were called insurgents and Polish terrorists. [. . .] Was there a Russian occupation? There was. Is there a Semitic occupation? There is.58\n\nIn view of the “Jewish invasion,” the Polish nationalists had to make but a small step from here to declare the necessity of fighting Jews, that is the occupiers of Poland, and inscribe this fight within the Polish tradition of heroic battles against external invaders. This also allowed them to acknowledge that the destruction of the Nazi Germany was not in Poland’s interest and, finally, (although these views were not widely shared even within so greatly anti-Semitic political circles) that even Nazi occupation would be in the Republic’s interest since it would allow the “Jewish question” to be solved once and for all.\n\n32\n\nChapter 2\n\nYoung Polish nationalism has been fighting for a long time for an international solution to the Jewish question.59 In view of our internal politics and, in particular, due to the possibility of solving the Jewish question on the international scale, it is desirable for as many nationalistic countries as possible to emerge in Europe.60 Poland is not interested in the slightest in the destruction of the Nazi regime in Germany; on the contrary, the existence of this regime is entirely in Poland’s interest.61 It is true that the Jewish question is an international issue; it is true that it cannot be solved entirely by one nation, but it is not true that no state and no nation cannot solve it alone. The solution of the Jewish question in one or another country is onerous and difficult to implement, but it is not impossible.62\n\nThe editors of “Młoda Polska” (Young Poland), a publication of the Young Poland Union that had close ties to Ozon, the ONR, and nationalist circles spoke in a similar, anti-Semitic tone. They emphasized the civilizational and cultural dissimilarity of Jews, which, in the authors’ opinion, had a destructive effect on the Polish state. Having accepted the view of the destructive influence of the Semitic culture on the Polish culture, the nationalists called for the vetting of artists and writers and for cutting them off from the cultural life of the Republic. It will be necessary to completely cut the Jews off from culturally influencing Poles: bar Jews from all Polish social associations, schools of every level and type, all public and teaching posts, the army, the theater, the cinema, the radio, the trade unions and publishing houses, and the Polish press as well as to externally isolate the Jewish press and the books of Jewish authors.63\n\nIn the opinion of the National Democrats, not only the works of Jewish artists were in danger of being thoroughly permeated with Jewish decadence but also of the Polish artists who were brought up under the influence of Jewish books, paintings, and films. That is why, according to the rightists, it was so necessary to separate Jews from Aryan Poles by, for example, creating ghettos. The nationalists from the ONR circles also explicitly praised the Nuremberg Laws that introduced Nazi and anti-Semitic laws in Germany. According to Ignacy Chrzanowski, upon receiving the news of Hitler’s rise to power, Dmowski “jumped for joy,” not concealing his “admiration and envy towards Nazi Germany for its war against Jews” and wishing to emulate “the complete German revolution” in Poland.64\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n33\n\nThe Nuremberg Laws are the final stage of the Nazi Jewish policy, endowing it with a legal framework. Pursuant to these laws, Jews were closed inside ghettos and will not be able to cause division within the German nation. Such legislation is modeled on the legislation of the era with the wisest policy towards Jews—the Middle Ages—and the teaching of the Catholic Church.65\n\nMoreover, ONR activists proudly bestowed upon themselves priority in formulating anti-Semitic principles, which, they claimed, were even ahead of those in Nazi Germany. Anti-Semitism in Ruch Młodych (The Youth Movement) existed much earlier than the anti-Jewish program in the NSDAP.66 Jews will be removed from Poland and their property will be taken away by law. [. . .] The first stage will be the removal of Jewry from Polish society. [. . .] Jews will be deprived of political rights and the right to participate in all Polish social associations and the right to serve in the Polish army. They will be deprived of the right to participate in Polish enterprises, the right to employ Poles, and the right to work for Poles. Polish schools will be free of Jews, Polish cultural life will be closed to them.67 Jews [. . .], as an element decidedly hostile and divisive to the nation, should absolutely have no political rights. No Jew can be a citizen of the Polish state.68 Jews must be isolated by subjecting them to special laws.69\n\nPolish nationalists also had no desire for any form of assimilation with the Jewish people (of which, in any case, Jews, according to them, were incapable) because this would lead to—in their opinion—the mixing of races. The racism of this political milieu has once again revealed itself: “Assimilation should be strongly opposed.”70 Marriage with a Pole does not make a Jewish woman Polish and such marriage should be severely prohibited under the penalty of the loss of all civil rights: One can see couples on the streets: a Polish Kasia, Małgosia, or Jasia with a typically Nordic face with this or that “dandy” who cannot be recognized behind his Semitic, sparrow-hawk shnoz [. . .]. Polish women, where is your dignity? Where is you sense of solidarity in the fight to maintain the national identity of our society; after all, you are meant to be the mother of Polish children!71\n\n34\n\nChapter 2\n\nLikewise, baptism and acceptance of Christianity did not protect Jews in Catholic Poland from persecution and the loss of rights. According to the nationalists, baptism did not change a Jew into a Pole, that is, a Jewish Christian was still a Jew in the national and racial sense and, as such, had to be persecuted. The nationalists also demanded the removal of Jews from universities and public schools and also wanted to conduct racial vetting of professors and teachers. They introduced their laws at every opportunity. For example, they took over control of the Association of the Architects of the Republic of Poland (pol. Stowarzyszenie Architektów Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej) and introduced the anti-Semitic principle of numerus nullus into its statute.72 The same happened at the Union of Christian Musicians (pol. Związek Muzyków Chrześcijańskich). Such actions demonstrated what they would be capable of if they were to assume real power in the Polish state. The nationalists demanded that Jews be deprived of property without compensation. In fact, this demand sanctioned the program of “widespread plunder,” analogous to that pushed forward by the Nazis in the Third Reich. The submission of such a demand on the eve of World War II is frightening, especially from the perspective of time—knowledge of the ethnic cleansing and plunder that took place in the Bialystok region in 1941. Of course, the nationalists did not consider such actions to be plunder but rather an act of exacting historical justice because, it must be remembered, they believed that Jews have been plundering Poland for centuries. This demand was presented at a meeting of Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły with members of the ONR in 1937, when the ruling sanation camp was trying to reach an entente with the nationalists.73 Trade boycott of Jewish merchants was also an element of the anti-Semitic strategy; it was promoted especially by the ND circles; however, this soon ceased to satisfy extreme falangists. Dmowski added: The Jewish people are undeniably parasites on the social body of the country in which they live. But it is in this very character that an explanation of the considered phenomenon should be sought. A healthy, strong body, functioning normally according to the laws of nature is the least suitable substrate for the development of parasites.74\n\nIn 1936, the National Party and the National Radical Camp adopted the strategy of inciting anti-Jewish riots, thereby accepting the use of terror as a tool of political struggle in the country. The target of the attacks was to be Jews, including those who accepted Christianity or came from mixed families.75 “We apply [. . .] and will apply force, coercion, and violence, and our conscience assumes responsibility for our actions with confidence and courage. This is an essential element of our totalism.”76 The rallies of Polish nationalists were also dominated by symbols borrowed directly from the Nazi NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche\n\nNationalism in Interwar Poland\n\n35\n\nArbeiterpartei, National Socialist German Workers’ Party). Polish nationalists wore uniforms modeled on those of the NSDAP and were, like that party’s militants, armed with clubs, knives, brass knuckles, and firearms. They also borrowed the fascist-Nazi greeting, the so-called “Roman salute”, a gesture of the raised, straightened, right arm, which was performed even during the funeral of the National Democracy leader Roman Dmowski in 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II and just before the Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Fig. 2.2. One should ponder the great confluence of the demands discussed above and those of the National Socialists in Nazi Germany. The essence of the nationalists’ program, however, was not to implement these changes after the ND and the ONR took power, that is, after the “breakthrough,” as it was called in their literature. After the breakthrough, the task of dealing with Jews was to rest on the shoulders of the state apparatus of violence, but “before the breakthrough,” the responsibility for implementing the demands rested—literally—on the shoulders of ONR militants. They were to use terror and brutal force to push Jews into ghettos and then to compel them to emigrate. Did they assume that there would be fatalities as a result of such actions? Of course. Within the ONR circles, there were those who on several occasions advocated an explicit plan to exterminate some Jews and to sterilize and exile others from the Catholic State of the Polish Nation. The genocide of Jews was to be carried out based on the model of the Armenian genocide by the Turks, which was the way ONR political writers envisaged the process.\n\nFigure 2.2 Members of the National Party at the Funeral of Roman Dmowski, January 7, 1939, in Warsaw. Ownership: Public Domain.\n\n36\n\nChapter 2\n\nThey must leave either gradually [. . .] to establish a new “hatchery” or at a gallop after suffering painful injury—for example, by being half-sterilized—the manner is up to us. Armenians in Turkey play the role of Jews. [. . .] Ataturk told himself that it is better to commit one grand barbarism with a positive result than a series of suppressed riots. Therefore, when after the victory over the Greeks one more slaughter of Armenians began in eastern Turkey, he not only did not interfere but even declared that Turkey was for the Turks. [. . .] If he proposed to the Armenians to leave in peace [. . .], they would have replied that they do not want to leave and have no place to go [. . .]. The Turkish way is the best!77 Nalewki awaits disinfection [. . .], entire buildings, blocks, streets must be razed [. . .]. We should not spare boiling water because everything is dirty, spit-covered, Jew-infested, and mangy. [. . .] And if all these black republicans, cockroaches, gaberdine-clad democrats, and bedbugs want to spread out across the whole capital—I will give one more advice [. . .] surround Nalewki with a high wall.78\n\nAnd here is the most blunt, unvarnished statement of the thesis for the program to physically exterminate Jews:79 In relation to internal enemies—the foreign and Jewish propaganda—the physical means of destruction and separation is the only expedient and proper means.80 [. . .] This is the ghetto; here tzadikim live and are venerated; here and in every little town, a generation of venomous, rabid, fanatic goy-hating Jews is growing up. And we have all this in hand—in the strong Warsaw fist. Just squeeze and the heart will stop beating.81 Currently, the Germans have embarked upon the final liquidation of Jewry at home [. . .].
