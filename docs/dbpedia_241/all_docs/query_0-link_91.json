Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy at Broadview, Sask. is rapidly increasing during the winter, rising by 1.7 kWh, from 1.1 kWh to 2.8 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during the winter is 1.0 kWh on December 18.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter at Broadview, Sask.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter at Broadview, Sask.DecJanFeb0.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWh4.5 kWh4.5 kWh5.0 kWh5.0 kWh5.5 kWh5.5 kWh6.0 kWh6.0 kWhFallSpringDec 181.0 kWhDec 181.0 kWhDec 11.1 kWhDec 11.1 kWhFeb 282.8 kWhFeb 282.8 kWhFeb 11.7 kWhFeb 11.7 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Broadview, Sask. are 50.383 deg latitude, -102.683 deg longitude, and 1,936 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Broadview, Sask. is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 56 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,939 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (561 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (1,430 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Broadview, Sask. is covered by cropland (98%), within 10 miles by cropland (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (84%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather at Broadview, Sask., based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nBroadview, Sask. has a weather station that reported reliably enough during the analysis period that we have included it in our network. When available, historical temperature and dew point measurements are taken directly from this weather station. These records are obtained from NOAA's Integrated Surface Hourly data set, falling back on ICAO METAR records as required.\n\nIn the case of missing or erroneous measurements from this station, we fall back on records from nearby stations, adjusted according to typical seasonal and diurnal intra-station differences. For a given day of the year and hour of the day, the fallback station is selected to minimize the prediction error over the years for which there are measurements for both stations.\n\nThe stations on which we may fall back include but are not limited to Yorkton Municipal Airport; Indian Head; Estevan Regional Aerodrome; Weyburn Automatic Weather Reporting System; Roblin Man; Melita, Man; Shoal Lake Airport; and Regina University.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
