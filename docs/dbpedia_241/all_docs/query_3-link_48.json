        "text": "July 29, 2024 – Project Awarded\n\nFollowing the July 8th Council meeting, the City’s project team, representatives from Alton Tangedal Architect (the project consultants) and project personnel from PCL Construction met to begin reviewing options to reduce the scope of work and overall project budget. The primary focus was on cosmetic items, including sandblasting and painting, blue room rubber flooring, protective netting, ceiling patching, and the arena sound system. Further investigation into refrigeration system adjustments, electrical and mechanical revisions, and potential changes to the dehumidification system was completed, however substantial cost savings were unable to be identified. A direct connection between the City and PCL’s internal insurance division was also made in order to explore project insurance options and costing.\n\nPotential changes to the project scope and budget savings was presented to Council at the July 29, 2024 Council meeting, and while approximately $130,000.00 in savings was identified it was decided to proceed with awarding the project to PCL Construction as originally tendered. As many of the proposed project changes would be required in the near future, City Council was unanimous in including these items in the overall project now, saving on future costs, down times, and potential impact to operations.\n\nThe Kinsmen Arena Ice System Upgrades project has been awarded to PCL Construction Management Inc., with a contract cost of $3,925,615.66, including PST and excluding GST. Construction on the project is scheduled to begin in January 2025, and be completed by September 2025, in time for the start of the 2025-2026 ice season.\n\nThe Kinsmen Arena will operate normally from September through December of 2024.\n\nJanuary 2023 - Consultants Engaged\n\nThe City is now proceeding with the Kinsmen Arena Upgrades Project, and has engaged Alton Tangedal Architect LTD from Regina to lead a team of consultants to design and coordinate the work required at the Kinsmen Arena, as approved by City Council:\n\nStructural Engineering: Brownlee Beaton Kreke,\n\nMechanical Engineering: RJ England Consulting Ltd\n\nElectrical Engineering: Rittenburg and Associates Ltd\n\nRefrigeration Engineering: Accent Refrigeration Systems\n\nGeotechnical Engineering: Clifton and Associates\n\nFebruary 2023 - Planning Discussion with Yorkton Minor Hockey\n\nMembers of the City’s project team met with representatives from Yorkton Minor Hockey to begin conversations on project implementation and timelines. The Kinsmen Arena is the primary home of Yorkton Minor Hockey programming, and as such there will be significant impact to hockey programming during project construction. It is anticipated that the Kinsmen Upgrades Project could take up to 10 months to complete, and it was important that Administration and Yorkton Minor Hockey take a proactive and collaborative approach to planning the project to minimize the impact to operations to the best ability. Preferred project timelines and implementation dates were provided by Yorkton Minor Hockey and will be shared with the project consultants and further planning and project design continue.\n\nMarch/April 2023 - Geotechnical Study\n\nA geotechnical survey of the ground conditions underneath the arena slab is planned for April 2023, once the ice has been taken out at the end of the season. This survey will further inform the project timeline planning, as it will assist with identifying how much excavation is required as part of the arena slab replacement.\n\nThe following is a summary of the studies and direction related to the Kinsmen Arena Ice System Upgrades Project. Many other community and Council discussions and project team meetings took place but have not been included here.\n\nMarch 2010 - Kinsmen Arena Conceptual Planning\n\nStantec Consulting completed a conceptual plan for improvements to the Kinsmen Arena which included a new lobby, renovated dressing rooms and other minor upgrades. The estimated budget was $3.5 million. Council deferred any decision until the completion of the 2020 strategic plan.\n\nAugust 17, 2011 - Kinsmen Arena Building Envelop Inspection\n\nConcerns regarding high levels of humidity and early ice bookings triggered an investigation into the building envelope and mechanical systems within the arena at the Kinsmen Arena. Associated Engineering conducted preliminary inspections and assessments related to mechanical systems and humidity impacts on the building.\n\nApril 20, 2012 - Kinsmen Arena Air Quality & Asbestos Survey\n\nCanadian Indoor Air Quality conducted an Asbestos Survey of the Kinsmen Arena. Areas identified as containing asbestos were appropriately marked to ensure that if they were ever required to be disturbed, it would be done appropriately safe. Asbestos was also identified in the exterior wall insulation.\n\nJune 6, 2012 - Kinsmen Arena Building Systems Assessment\n\nAssociated Engineering completed an in-depth, visual and physical assessment of building systems in the arena (arena only). Recommendations totaling $1.14 million were provided to address the negative impact of the humidity in the arena proper.\n\nJune 2012 - Council Direction: Kinsmen Arena 10 Year Plan\n\nCouncil directed Administration to plan for the replacement of the Kinsmen Arena so that it would be available to the public in 10 years-time and to bring forward capital projects that would ensure its use until that time.\n\nNovember 27, 2012 - Kinsmen Arena Inspection\n\nAssociated Engineering was asked to continue their assessment and completed a multi-discipline visual inspection of the remainder of the building. The conclusion was “that the arena could be left as is, and still function as it does, however the deterioration will continue, resulting in the facility becoming sub-standard and possibly unusable.” The total estimated improvement costs (including items from June 6, 2012 above) was set at $3.1 million.\n\nFebruary 14, 2013 - Kinsmen Arena Air Quality & Mold Assessment\n\nCanadian Indoor Air Quality conducted an Environmental Mold Assessment of the Kinsmen Arena, which showed no air quality issues, however some areas had significant contamination which required remediation. Their conclusion was that dehumidification and improvement to the exterior envelope of the building should be addressed in order to control mold growth.\n\n2013 - Kinsmen Arena Roof Vents Sealed\n\nRoof vents were sealed at the Kinsmen Arena to reduce mix of warm, humid air with cold dry air, which creates humidity concerns, as per Associated Engineering recommendation, and Council direction from 2012.\n\n2014 - Kinsmen Arena New Doors\n\nNew doors installed in the arena envelope at the Kinsmen arena to reduce mix of warm, humid air with cold dry air, which creates humidity concerns, as per Associated Engineering recommendation, and Council direction, from 2012.\n\n2015 - Kinsmen Arena Gable End Wall Removal\n\nGable end walls, which were wet and mouldy, were removed at the Kinsmen Arena and replaced and seal, as per Associated Engineering recommendation, and Council direction, from 2012.\n\nThis was the end of the work required to meet Council’s direction from 2012 which was to plan for new facility to ready in 2022 and ensure the Kinsmen Arena could be maintained sufficiently until a new facility was ready.\n\nAdditional significant resources were required beyond these minor improvements, however investing these resources into a deteriorating facility, and for which direction for the planning had been provided, was not a priority.\n\nFocus then shifted to the arena at the Gallagher Centre, due to a request by the Yorkton Terriers to modernize their dressing room facilities. This, combined with the previous direction to plan for the replacement of the Kinsmen Arena, triggered consideration of locating the Kinsmen Arena at the Gallagher Centre which resulted in the Gallagher Centre Renewal Project. Details and timelines on this project Gallagher Centre Renewal Project can be found on the News and Notices section of our website"
