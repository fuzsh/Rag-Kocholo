        "text": "The main emphasis of the MEWS project was to predict the hygrothermal responses of several wall assemblies that are exposed to North American climate loads, and a range of water leakage loads. Researchers used a method based on both laboratory experimentation and 2-D modeling with IRC&#39;s benchmarked model, hygIRC. This method introduced built-in detailing deficiencies that allowed water leakage into the stud cavity-both in the laboratory test specimens and in the virtual (modeling) &quot; specimens &quot;-for the purpose of investigating water entry rates into the stud cavity and the drying potential of the wall assemblies under different climate loads. Since the project was a first step in investigating a range of wall hygrothermal responses in a parametric analysis, no field study of building characteristics was performed to confirm inputs such as water entry rates and outputs such as wall response in a given climate. Rather, ranges from &#39;no water entry and no response&#39;...\n\nThere is an increase in the use of hygrothermal models to complete the performance evaluation of walls assemblies, either in respect to design of new assembles or the retrofit of existing wall assemblies. To this end there are guides available in which is provided information on moisture loads to wall assemblies. This includes, for example, Criteria for Moisture-Control Design Analysis in Buildings given in ASHRAE 160, Assessment of moisture transfer by numerical simulation provided in EN 15026, and NRC’s “Guidelines for Design for Durability of the Building Envelope”. The designer of a new assembly or evaluator of an existing wall is tasked with having to determine what moisture loads to apply to the wall and where to apply this load within the assembly. Typically there is little or no information that is readily available regarding moisture loads to walls and thus the suggested hourly moisture load, as given in ASHRAE 160, is 1% by weight of the total driving rain load to the wall...\n\nMoisture problems within the building shell can be caused by a number of factors including excess interior moisture, bulk water intrusion, capillary action from concrete to wood connections, and through wetted building materials such as siding wetted from rain splash back. Depending on the temperature of the surfaces and the permeability of the materials, that moisture may get trapped inside of the walls and could potentially lead to mold growth and/or decay of the buildings materials. High-R wall assemblies are gaining popularity due to programs promoting high performance building shells for both new construction and retrofit activities. While the reduction in heat transfer is desirable from an energy standpoint, decreased heat transfer also results in decreased drying potential. With the increasing thickness of walls, moisture related failures could become much bigger problems. To evaluate the potential for moisture problems in high R-value walls, the project team conducted a comb..."
