        "text": "This future-looking information comes with an associated uncertainty, as fully described for each design value element in the CRBCPI.\n\nIn brief, Tier 1 variables are those for which there is generally high or very high confidence in the future projections for a given level of global warming. These variables reflect the well-understood thermal response of the climate to external radiative forcing of the Earth system.\n\nheating degree days\n\nhourly design temperatures (January 2.5% dry bulb, January 1% dry bulb, July 97.5% dry bulb, and July 97.5% wet bulb)\n\nTier 2 variables are those for which there is generally medium confidence in the future projections for a given level of global warming.\n\nannual total precipitation and annual total rainfall\n\nannual maximum 1-day rain (50-yr return period)\n\nannual maximum 15-min rainfall (10-yr return period)\n\nTier 3 variables are those for which there is low or very low confidence in the future projections for a given level of global warming.\n\nannual total precipitation and annual total rainfall\n\nannual maximum 1-day rain (50-yr return period)\n\nannual maximum 15-min rainfall (10-yr return period)\n\nAdditional guidance on the use of the Design Value Explorer and the associated data can be found in the Learning Zone and under the ‘About’ tab in the tool on PCIC’s website.\n\n*Historical values are derived from records prior to 2008 for most variables. At two locations (Pine Falls, MB and Boiestown, NB), historical values were provided by PCIC as these locations had problematic or missing data."
