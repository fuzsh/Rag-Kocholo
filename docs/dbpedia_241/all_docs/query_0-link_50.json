        "text": "NEW YORK -\n\nNearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling Monday as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down by 2.1 per cent in midday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 763 points, or 1.9 per cent, as of 12:20 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.4 per cent.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan’s Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4 per cent for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8 per cent lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2 per cent and bitcoin dropped below US$55,000 from more than US$61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped one per cent.\n\nThat’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70 per cent during the morning from 3.88 per cent late Friday and from 5 per cent in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.93 per cent.\n\nDownload the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\n\n“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25 per cent probability of that, up from 15 per cent, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.”\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and “a market that was ahead of itself.”\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 2.8 per cent, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 3.7 per cent Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6 per cent. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia's gain for the year to nearly 104 per cent from 170 per cent in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies are the market’s biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nFollow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former U.S. president Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach, Matt Ott and Christopher Rugaber contributed."
