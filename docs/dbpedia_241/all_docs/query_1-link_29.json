        "text": "The Saskatchewan Agriculture weekly crop report says some cereal crops are being harvested for feed in very dry areas. Rain over the long weekend would help later-seeded crops with head and pod filling, but it may be too late for early-seeded crops.\n\nThere was little to no rain last week with the largest amounts at Hafford and St. Walburg in the 15 millimetre range.\n\nProvincial cropland topsoil moisture has fallen to 41 per cent adequate, 49 per cent short and 10 perc ent very short. Pasture conditions are rated four per cent excellent, 37 per cent good, 42 per cent fair, 15 per cent poor and two per cent very poor.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture produces maps which provide an indication of where the problem areas are located. Below the maps, you can read the region-by-region report.\n\nSOUTHEAST (Estevan, Weyburn, Carnduff, Broadview, Lumsden and Regina areas)\n\nMany producers in the region are preparing harvest equipment and desiccating pulse crops. A few producers are just starting to harvest earlier seeded pulses along with cereals that are being harvested for feed. Haying is nearing completion with no second cut anticipated due to the lack of moisture.\n\nMinimal rain was received over the past week with two mm being the most recorded in the Esterhazy and Tantallon areas, while the rest of the region received no rainfall.\n\nWith the persistent dry and hot conditions, topsoil moisture continues to decline. Currently, cropland topsoil moisture is rated as 34 per cent adequate, 57 per cent short and nine per cent very short. Hayland topsoil moisture is reported at 28 per cent adequate, 62 per cent short and 10 per cent very short. Pasture topsoil moisture is 25 per cent adequate, 57 per cent short and 18 per cent very short. Pasture conditions are declining within the region with the continued lack of moisture and high temperatures.\n\nCurrently, 30 per cent of pastures are rated as good, 44 per cent fair, 21 per cent poor and five per cent very poor. Heat and lack of moisture have been the main causes of crop damage over the past week but producers indicate that gophers, grasshoppers and aphids are still persisting. Wind has also caused lodging in some crops throughout the region, but overall minor damage was reported.\n\nSOUTHWEST (Assiniboia, Gravelbourg, Maple Creek, Moose Jaw, Swift Current, Central Butte and Craik areas)\n\nMany producers in the region are preparing harvest equipment and desiccating pulse crops. A few producers are just starting to harvest earlier seeded pulses along with cereals that are being harvested for feed. Haying is nearing completion with no second cut anticipated due to the lack of moisture.\n\nMinimal rain was received over the past week with two mm being the most recorded in the Esterhazy and Tantallon areas, while the rest of the region received no rainfall. With the persistent dry and hot conditions, topsoil moisture continues to decline. Currently, cropland topsoil moisture is rated as 34 per cent adequate, 57 per cent short and nine per cent very short.\n\nHayland topsoil moisture is reported at 28 per cent adequate, 62 per cent short and 10 per cent very short. Pasture topsoil moisture is 25 per cent adequate, 57 per cent short and 18 per cent very short. Pasture conditions are declining within the region with the continued lack of moisture and high temperatures. Currently, 30 per cent of pastures are rated as good, 44 per cent fair, 21 per cent poor and five per cent very poor. Heat and lack of moisture have been the main causes of crop damage over the past week but producers indicate that gophers, grasshoppers and aphids are still persisting. Wind has also caused lodging in some crops throughout the region, but overall minor damage was reported.\n\nWEST CENTRAL (Biggar, Kerrobert, Kindersley, Rosetown and Delisle)\n\nProducers in the region are preparing harvest equipment with some pulse desiccation occurring. Overall, limited harvest progress was reported for the region but there are a few reports of early seeded cereals being harvested over the past week. Haying operations continue but producers indicate that a second cut is unlikely due to the lack of moisture.\n\nMinimal rain was received over the past week with eight mm being the most recorded in the Macrorie area followed by four mm in the Conquest area. Most of the region received smaller amounts to no rainfall over the past week.\n\nTopsoil moisture continues to decline with the persistent hot and dry conditions. Currently, cropland topsoil moisture is rated as 44 per cent adequate, 51 per cent short and five per cent very short. Hayland topsoil moisture is reported at 45 per cent adequate, 47 per cent short and eight per cent very short. Pasture topsoil moisture is 40 per cent adequate, 49 per cent short and 11 per cent very short.\n\nPastures are being impacted within the region by the continued lack of moisture and high temperatures. Currently, five per cent of pastures are rated as in excellent condition, 44 per cent are good, 45 per cent are fair and six per cent are in poor condition.\n\nHeat and lack of moisture are the main causes of crop damage over the past week. Wind has also caused lodging in some crops throughout the region with up to moderate damage reported. Moderate damage has also been reported from grasshoppers and aphids in areas within the region. Gophers continue to be reported, but with overall minor crop damage occurring.\n\nEAST CENTRAL (Yorkton, Preeceville, Foam Lake, Leroy, Davidson, Lanigan and Saskatoon)\n\nWith the higher temperatures and drier conditions accelerating crop advancement, producers are preparing harvest equipment. Limited amounts of harvest have started within the region. Haying operations continue but producers indicate that a second cut is unlikely due to the lack of moisture.\n\nMinimal rain was received over the past week with five mm being the most recorded in the Stalwart area. The Ituna area received three mm and the Hyas and Yorkton areas received two mm. The majority of the region received no rainfall over the past week.\n\nTopsoil moisture continues to decrease with the persistent hot and dry conditions. Currently, cropland topsoil moisture is rated as 49 per cent adequate, 48 per cent short and three per cent very short. Hayland topsoil moisture is reported at 58 per cent adequate, 40 per cent short and two per cent very short. Pasture topsoil moisture is 46 per cent adequate, 52 per cent short and two per cent very short.\n\nThe continued lack of moisture and high temperatures are impacting pastures within the region. Currently, 10 per cent of pastures are rated as in excellent condition, 45 per cent good, 39 per cent fair and six per cent are in poor condition.\n\nHeat and lack of moisture are the main causes of crop damage over the past week. Wind has also caused lodging in some crops throughout the region with up to moderate damage reported. Moderate damage has also been reported from aphids in a few areas within the region. Grasshoppers and gophers continue to be reported but with overall minor crop damage occurring.\n\nNORTHEAST (Hudson Bay, Nipawin, Tisdale, Melfort, Humboldt, Kinistino and Prince Albert)\n\nWith the higher temperatures and drier conditions accelerating crop advancement, producers are preparing harvest equipment. No harvest activity has been reported for the region. Haying operations continue but producers indicate that a second cut is unlikely due to the lack of moisture.\n\nMinimal rain was received over the past week with five mm being the most recorded in the Nipawin area. The Carrot River, Hague and Duck Lake areas all received three mm. The majority of the region received smaller amounts to no rainfall over the past week.\n\nTopsoil moisture continues to decrease with the persistent hot and dry conditions. Currently, cropland topsoil moisture is rated as 55 per cent adequate, 44 per cent short and one per cent very short. Hayland topsoil moisture is reported at 55 per cent adequate, 44 per cent short and one per cent very short. Pasture topsoil moisture is 54 per cent adequate, 45 per cent short and one per cent very short.\n\nThe continued lack of moisture and high temperatures are impacting pastures within the region. Currently, five per cent of pastures are rated as in excellent condition, 43 per cent are good, 42 per cent are fair and 10 per cent are in poor condition.\n\nCrop damage over the past week was mainly due to the lack of moisture and heat. Wind has also caused lodging in some crops throughout the region, but overall minor damage was reported. Moderate damage has also been reported from aphids in a few areas within the region.\n\nNORTHWEST (Blaine Lake, Spiritwood, Canwood, Glaslyn, Meadow Lake and Maidstone areas)\n\nWith the higher temperatures and drier conditions accelerating crop advancement, producers are preparing harvest equipment. No harvest activity has been reported for the region. Haying is nearing completion with no second cut anticipated due to the lack of moisture.\n\nRainfall was variable within the region with the Hafford area receiving the highest amount at 15 mm. The St. Walburg area received 14 mm followed by the North Battleford area at nine mm. Most other areas within the region received rain but in smaller amounts over the past week.\n\nTopsoil moisture continues to be impacted by the persistent hot and dry conditions. Currently, cropland topsoil moisture is rated as 50 per cent adequate, 43 per cent short and seven per cent very short. Hayland topsoil moisture is reported at 41 per cent adequate, 50 per cent short and nine per cent very short. Pasture topsoil moisture is 51 per cent adequate, 39 per cent short and 10 per cent very short.\n\nPastures are being impacted within the region by the continued lack of moisture and high temperatures. Currently, two per cent of pastures are rated as in excellent condition, 47 per cent good, 32 per cent fair and 19 per cent poor condition.\n\nHeat and lack of moisture are the main causes of crop damage over the past week. Wind has also caused lodging in some crops throughout the region with up to moderate damage reported. Grasshopper and aphid damage were reported in a few areas within the region over the past week but overall with minor crop damage occurring."
