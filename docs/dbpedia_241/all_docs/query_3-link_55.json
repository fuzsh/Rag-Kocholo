        "text": "Luxury Vinyl Floors in Yorkton, SK\n\nLuxury vinyl flooring is a great choice when traditional options like tile or hardwood flooring simply aren’t the best fit for you and your home. With its affordable price, durability, and easy keeping, luxury vinyl flooring brings you the best of both worlds.\n\nAt Carpet One Floor & Home in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, we know that whether you’re building or renovating your home, it’s important to find the right flooring for your lifestyle and budget. Whether you are just starting the process or ready to buy, our luxury vinyl flooring guide has got you covered on everything you should know before you buy.\n\nWhat is Luxury Vinyl Flooring?\n\nLuxury vinyl flooring is a newer flooring option that uses new manufacturing techniques and materials that feature the look and feel of all your favourite looks.\n\nThrough high-definition images of real wood and tile, luxury vinyl flooring offers realistic replications of popular flooring styles like hardwood, stone, and tile. Luxury vinyl flooring provides a versatile, durable flooring option that is water-resistant and easy to maintain compared to its traditional counterparts.\n\nLuxury Vinyl Tile (LVT) and Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP) are two types of luxury vinyl floors mainly differentiated by their shape and size. The beauty of luxury vinyl flooring is that it can be replaced individually if they become damaged. That means you won’t have to rip up your entire floor if only one tile or plank is damaged.\n\nWhat is Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT)?\n\nAuthentic tile appearance and feel\n\nSame style, colours, patterns, and textures as traditional tile\n\nWarmer and softer to the touch\n\nMore cushioned underfoot\n\nCrack resistant\n\nIndividual pieces that can be installed separately\n\nCan be grouted for an authentic looks\n\nWhat is Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP)?\n\nAuthentic hardwood appearance and feel\n\nWear-resistant\n\nMoisture resistant\n\nRequire less maintenance\n\nDo not need to be refinished\n\nCan install in bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and more\n\nIs Luxury Vinyl Flooring Waterproof?\n\nWhile all luxury vinyl offers some level of moisture protection, luxury vinyl flooring also comes in fully 100% waterproof options, so you can rest assured humidity and spills won’t ruin your floors.\n\nMoisture-resistant floors can eventually sustain damage from too much water and humidity exposure. However, waterproof luxury vinyl flooring has a rigid core structure that prevents the planks from shrinking and expanding. Watertight seams and a spill-repellent surface further prevent leaks from moving below the floor.\n\nMeanwhile, a durable wear layer prevents stains and blemishes and makes your vinyl easy to clean. These beautiful floors can even be installed in basements and bathrooms where moisture can be a problem.\n\nHow Is Luxury Vinyl Flooring Installed?\n\nWhen it comes to installation, luxury vinyl tile and plank usually require less installation time and can often be installed as a floating floor.\n\nFloating floors are not permanently attached to the subfloor. Instead, they are placed together like a puzzle over the subfloor. This method isn’t recommended when installing luxury vinyl flooring under cabinetry since it can make it difficult to remove broken or damaged tiles or planks.\n\nDepending on your current flooring and the condition of your subfloor, your sales professional will make a recommendation on how to install your new vinyl flooring. Our in-house team of installers will help make this entire process seamless and help work around your schedule.\n\nWhere Else Can I Install Vinyl Floors?\n\nLuxury vinyl is an ideal flooring choice if you’re working on a new kitchen orbathroom design and want something affordable, easy to care for, and durable.
