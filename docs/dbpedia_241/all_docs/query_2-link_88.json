The grand total of the loans, after the decrease from $1,155,000,000 to $1,430,000,000 during the week,compares with $3,243,000,000 a year ago on July 16 1930. In the condition statements of the Federal Reserve banks themselves the changes for the week are not very important, but are along the same lines as in previous weeks. The holdings of acceptances purchased in the open market have further declined during the week, dropping from $91,788,000 July 8 to $70,408,000 July 15, making it again evident that the Federal Reserve banks are unable to add to their holdings of acceptances, notwithstanding that they are ready to purchase them on a discount basis of only 1% per annum. The discount holdings show very little change for the week, the present amount for the 12 Reserve institutions being $161,803,000 as against $162,386,000 last week. Holdings of Government securities have been further increased in the amount of about $10,000,000, raising the total from $667,953,000 July 8 to $677,853,000 July 15. The effect of these changes is to leave the total of the bill and security holdings, reflecting the amount of Reserve credit outstanding, about $11,000,000 less than a week ago, the amount July 15, at $921,157,000, comparing with $932,102,000 July 8. The amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation has further decreased this week and now is $1,716,621,000 as against $1,736,922,000 last week. Gold reserves have also declined, and at $3,409,149,000 July 15 compare with $3,427,905,000 on July 8. The stock market this week has suffered a further decline, but considering the acute situation which developed in Germany and Central Europe, and the many grave features connected therewith, the de dines have been relatively slight. On Saturday last, though the course of prices was somewhat irregular, the general trend was downward, but not in a very pronounced way. On Monday, after the series of unfavorable developments in Germany which marked the week-end, the market opened with losses of 2 to 3 points in the active specialties as compared with the closing figures on Saturday, but the greater part of these losses was recovered before the end of the day, leaving the net changes, as a rule, quite small. On Tuesday the market, while more or less unsettled, did not display any great changes. On Wednesday, however, it was decidedly weak, with heavy losses all around, but with a rally before the close in which a portion of the early losses was regained. The German situation wore a very unfavorable look, and the Bank of Germany raised its discount rate from 7% to 10% and the legal reserve ratio was lowered from 40% to 30%. On Thursday rallying tendencies were again in evidence after some further breaks in different stocks, leaving, in most cases, fractional advances for the day. The German situation looked more assuring, and the Bank of England avoided an advance in its discount rate. On Friday the tone improved still further. As indicated in the remarks further above in this article, trade and industry have continued depressed, and the situation in Europe was such as to promise little relief in that respect. Steel operations suffered a further shrinkage and the price of copper dropped [VoL. 133. to the extraordinarily low figure of 7 c. per pound. / 1 2 The railroad list has,been under pressure nearly all through the list. The Inter-State Commerce Commission began its hearings on Wednesday on the petition of the railroads for a 15% advance in rates, and the indications were that the hearings would be long-drawn-out, and that there would hence be much delay in reaching a decision, thus postponing the advance in rates to a late date in the year, if the carriers in the end actually succeed in getting any advance. The local traction properties were weak on the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the 5c. fare. Call loans on the Stock Exchange again continued without change at 11 2% all through the / week. German bonds suffered sharp declines. The market was quite inactive most of the time and only 46 stocks established new low records for the year during the week, while six stocks recorded new highs for the year. Trading has again been quite light. At the halfday session on Saturday last the sales on the New York Stock Exchange were 592,840 shares;.on Monday they were 1,282,920 shares; on Tuesday,1,105,260 shares; on Wednesday, 2,605,100 shares; on Thursday, 1,517,143 shares, and on Friday, 1,271,5:50 shares. On the New York Curb Exchange the sales on Saturday were 117,040 shares; on Monday they were 300,277 shares; on Tuesday, 254,269 shares; on Wednesday, 479,358 shares; on Thursday, 234,235 shares, and on Friday, 258,605 shares. As compared with Friday of last week, prices are lower all around. General Electric closed yesterday at 4114 against 43 on Friday of last week; Warner / / 1 2 Bros. Pictures at 7 against 7/ Elec.

The earlier results were dwarfed in recent days as the question of business trends was, of course , forgotten crisis waxed and spread, becoming finally a world- 340 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE wide affair that involved and dominated all markets and all countries. The current week has undoubtedly been the most trying in recent financial history. Statesmen and financiers everywhere gave their undivided attention to the difficulties, and conferences followed each other in rapid succession in such centers as Berlin, London, New York, Paris and Basle. Numerous obstacles to satisfactory and sufficient aid presented themselves as these conferences progressed, and it was made fairly plain during the week that the basis for improvement will have to be laid within the Reich and the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe immediately involved with her. It seems obvious that any reasonable measures for helping Central Europe financially will be taken later by such centers as New York and London,and possibly Paris as well, but such steps clearly depend on the progress within the Reich and especially on political stability. The financial fundamentals of the German situation are not difficult to grasp, however involved the ramifications and the political consequences. German borrowing in other capital markets has proceeded at a tremendous pace in recent years, almost entirely on a short term basis owing to the difficulty of floating long term obligations. Funds thus secured by German public and private corporations have supplied the money needed not only within the Reich itself, but also the sums required for reparations payments. The short term debt, which probably approximated $2,000,000,000, placed Germany in a vulnerable position, since there has been no opportunity to build up satisfactory reserve's of gold and foreign exchange holdings since the crash of 1923. That crash itself is an important factor in the present situation, as the memory of it is keen in German minds. The flight from the mark that resulted in the present situation of Germany is due both to the demand for foreign currencies by fearstricken Germans who recalled vividly their worthless holdings of German securities and currency eight years ago, and the withdrawals of their short term credits by foreign investors. The signal for the withdrawals was given, it must be remarked, by the German Government itself. Chancellor Bruening and Foreign Vinister Curtius advertised rather too well, during their visit to London early in June, the precarious state of affairs produced in the Reich by the world-wide economic depression and the heavy reparations burden. Pleas then made, together with the German Government decree imposing heavier taxes, started an immense export of capital which finally exceeded the capacities of the financial institutions of the Reich. The relief planned by President Hoover and announced by him June 20 in the form of a proposal for a one-year suspension of all payments on intergovernmental debts would doubtless have sufficed to allay apprehensions and permit a gradual adjustment of the problem if it had been accepted immediately. French objections and attempts to secure political gains as the price of acceptance delayed the application of the plan and general agreement was not achieved until July 6. The capital withdrawals from Germany, starting as a trickle, had attained avalanche proportions by that time and apparently nothing could stop them. A $100,000,000 credit extended the Reichsbank on June 25 by the Federal Reserve Banks, the Bank of England, the Bank of France and the B. I. S., was quickly exhausted, and [VoL. 133. a long standing $50,000,000 credit in this market extended to the Gold Discount Bank, a subsidiary of the Reichsbank, was used up early last week. Dr. Hans Luther,President of the Reichsbank,attempted late last week and early this week to negotiate an additional credit of up to $500,000,000, according to the reports, but in this he was unsuccessful, and the closing of the German exchange's and the German banks was perhaps the only resource remaining at the immediate command of the Reich Government. Regarding the actual course of the negotiations conducted by Dr. Luther in his attempt to secure international aid extremely little is definitely known publicly, but it may be surmised that he received little encouragement anywhere. The Reichsbank President arrived in London by airplane July 9 and he conferred with Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England,as the two bank heads journeyed to the Continent together. Their ultimate destination was Basle, where the regular meeting of B. I. S. directors was scheduled for Monday, but Dr. Luther changed his plans several times before proceeding finally to the Swiss city. He conferred July 10 with Governor Clement Moret, of the Bank of France, at a meeting in Paris, and it appears from reports that the earlier French political demands were reiterated and perhaps even amplified in the course of this discussion. Dr. Luther's appeal to the French central bank for aid received the sympathetic attention of M. Moret, accounts said, and late in the same day he again stated his case to P. E. Flandin, French Minister of Finance. His final conference of the day was with Louis Franck, Governor of the Bank of Belgium, who flew from Brussels to Paris to meet him. Technical difficulties in the way of raising the amounts needed by Germany were brought forward, it was said, but these were not considered formidable. Emphasis was placed, reports to the New York \"Times\" and New York \"Herald Tribune\" stated, rather on the political guarantees by Germany that would have to accompany French participation in any extension of credit. These, it was said on the basis of unofficial reports, would take the form of pledges that Germany would abandon her projected customs union with Austria, and also suspend construction of the 10,000-ton armored cruisers known as \"pocket battleships.\" Reports of last Saturday revealed little save complications, some of the statements, indeed, being distinctly contradictory. Through all the dispatches ran a vein of pessimism, induced by a growing realization that aid probably would not be forthcoming and would be too late even if finally extended. Dr. Luther returned to Berlin by airplane, reaching the German capital Saturday afternoon and immediately proceeding to a Cabinet meeting over which Chancellor Heinrich Bruening presided. The gathering continued until early Sunday, with no definite conclusions reached, but it was suggested in press accounts that the Cabinet would reject the French political demands. It was also stated that the Bruening Government debated the declaration of a moratorium on all private debts and the closing of the German securities and commodity exchanges for a time. At the request of the German Government, United States Ambassador Frederic M. Sackett was said to have cabled an urgent appeal for aid to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. The impression prevailing in some quarters that the Bruening Government had appealed to President Hoover was JULY 18 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE 341 denied late in the day by Acting Secretary of State issued after the meeting, stated merely that Dr. von William R.

An official announcement, issued by Premier Blanquier in Santiago Thursday, declared a moratorium on the foreign debt until Aug. 1, and also called for sacrifices at home.

Instead of sending out debt obligations, the Government will deposit in local banks the necessary amounts when due, in the equivalent of Chilean currency, as a demonstration of its purpose at the same time to guarantee effective payment.

FINANCIAL CHRONICLE The Bank of Germany in its statement for the second quarter of July shows a loss in gold and bullion of 55,664,000 marks. Gold now aggregates 1,366,092,000 marks, which compares with 2,618,731,000 marks the previous year and 2,036,240,000 marks two years ago. Increases appear in bills of exchange and checks of 121,837,000 marks and in advances of 161,530,000 marks, while reserve in foreign currency declined 246,620,000 marks. Deposits abroad remain unchanged at 117,688,000 marks. Notes in circulation rose 51,390,000 marks, raising the total of the item up to 4,161,710,000 marks. Circulation last year stood at 4,186,916,000 marks and the year before at 4,347,461,000 marks. Other daily maturing obligations decreased 35,648,000 marks, while other liabilities went up 28,280,000 marks. Below we furnish a comparison of the various items for the past three years: cial paper has been in sharp demand, but the supply of satisfactory paper has been insufficient to meet the requirements of the market. Rates for choice names of four to six months' maturity remain at 2%. Names less well known and shorter choice names are still quoted at 2Y 2@2%7. 0 The demand for prime bank acceptances has been moderately brisk this week, orders coming mostly from the Central and far West. The supply of paper was limited and business was greatly hampered on that account. Rates were unchanged, as the one dealer who reduced his quotations late last Friday by 18 of 1% cancelled all reductions on Monday. The / quotations of the American Acceptance Council continue at: For bills up to 90 days,17 bid, /8% asked; 0 for four months' bills, 1/ bid, 1% asked; for five 18% and six months, 1%7 bid and 1y 0 4% asked. The Federal Reserve banks suffered a further decrease in their holdings of acceptances during the week from $91,788,000 to $70,408,000. Their holdings of acceptances for foreign correspondents dropped further from $302,020,000 to $289,851,000. Open market rates for acceptances also remain unchanged, as follows: REICHSBANK'S COMPARATIVE STATEMENT. Changesfor Week. July 15 1931. July 15 1930. July 15 1929. Assets— Reichsmarks. Retchsmarks.

Call loans on the Stock Exchange were quoted at the undeviOng figure of 11 27, both renewals and new / 0 loans being arranged at this level. Banking house funds were available in every session in the outside, / or \"Street\" market, where a uniform rate of 114% / 0 was named, or a concession of 147 from the official charge. Business was transacted on a small scale, as demand for funds remained small with the supply very great. Indicative of the trend was the record low cost Treasury borrowing by means of discount iof bills. An issue of $50,000,000 was bid for Wednesday, and an average rate on a bank discount basis of 0.49% resulted for the 90-day obligations. This contrasts with a sale of similar bills two weeks earlier at an average rate of 0.625%. Brokers' loans on stock and bond collateral, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, declined $25,000,000 for the week to Wednesday night. Gold movements for the same weekly period consisted of imports of $103,000. There were no exports, but the stock of earmarked gold increased $8,500,000, which is equivalent to an export. The daily statement issued yesterday reflected an export of $1,000,000 gold to Italy. Dealing in detail with call loan rates on the Stock Exchange from day to day, there was again no devia/ tion at any time from the figure of 11 270, this having been the quotation both for new loans and for renewals on every day of the week. The market for time money has continued dull. An occasional transaction in 90-day money has been recorded, but all other maturities have been at a standstill.

In Wednesday's trading on a wild market sterling collapsed, selling as low as 4.833 for cable transfers, the lowest price witnessed since April 1925, just prior to the amalgamation of British currency. At the same time the London check rate on Paris dropped to 122.70, the lowest since January 1927. Wednesday's rate compares with closing quotations on Friday of last week of 4.863/i for demand and 4.86 11-16 for cable transfers, which rates also prevailed on Saturday last. The range this week has been from 4.83 to 4.863/ for bankers' sight bills, compared with 4.863 to 4.86% last week. The range for cable transfers has been from 4.833 to 4.86 11-16, compared with 4.863/ to 4.86 11-16. A few weeks ago, and up until Saturday, a rather confident opinion prevailed in the market that the Bank of England might reduce its rate of rediscount to 2% from 2 2%, but with the demoralization of the market on Monday this attitude was entirly re- JULY 18 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE versed and London dispatches indicated that the Bank of England would in all probability materially increase its rediscount rate on Thursday of this week as a result of heavy losses of gold by London to France, Holland, Belgium and Switzerland. However, developments overnight on Wednesday and throughout Thursday were so favorable, especially as affecting the course of financial matters in Germany, that the Bank of England made no change in its rediscount rate. Sterling exchange recovered on Thursday on average 178c. from Wednesday's close in the New York market, with trading extremely active. Despite this recovery, the London check rate on Paris continued against London, with a range of 123.25 to 123.45. The range for sterling cable transfers in New York on Thursday was from 4.843/i to 4.85% and on Friday from 4.845 to A 4.85 5-16. The gold export point to Paris is estimated by London banks at 123.88. The export point for gold from London to New York was estimated here on Monday at 4.853. Hence the prevailing rates for sterling exchange throughout the greater part of the week have justified the expectation of a heavy gold movement from London to New York. As a matter of fact, a large shipment of gold is reported to have been engaged by New York banks and subsequently cancelled. The cancellation of the shipment is believed to have been the result of moral suasion on the part of banking authorities here, who have been making every endeavor to relieve the world financial tension. Leading bankers on this side are strongly averse to receiving gold from London, regardless of the actual price of foreign exchange. The extremely sharp drop in sterling is the result of heavy withdrawals by European centres of their short-term balances which are generally kept in London. Everywhere there seemed to be a rush of capital to the dollar and the franc. The level calm with which London accepted the situation did much to clear up the crisis in sterling on Thursday. The Bank of England refused to raise its rediscount rate, in the assurance that the exchange would improve by itself and that the Bank is strong enough to withstand considerable pressure. The Bank of England worked in close co-operation with the banks and acceptance houses in London to prevent any possible difficulties in consequence of foreign withdrawals. Gold losses during Thursday amounted to about £5,000,000 despite the improvement in the exchange, of which £3,000,000 were sold in gold bars and £2,000,000 were set aside. The metal was for French, Dutch and Belgian account. That sterling should suffer so severely in a crisis largely of external origin and significance results from the fact that London is a repository for huge amounts of foreign funds. The MacMillan committee, which on July 13 published its report on British finance and industry, estimated that foreign deposits in London three months ago totaled more than £400,000,000, leaving London a debtor, after deducting foreign acceptances, of about £150,000,000 in the amount of about £250,000,000. French and German interests hold large volumes of bills and other short-term securities. It is believed that in the present crisis bills were sold largely for German account to enable the Germans to meet obligations in New York, thus causing further strength in dollars against sterling. There was extreme excitement and anxiety around noon on Thursday in the London market when the official 347 electric indicators erroneously flashed that the Bank of England rate had been increased to 4%. Dealers had previously been convinced that there would be no change in the rate and consequently prices had been marked up on the London Stock Exchange. When the figure 4% appeared on the indicators brokers and jobbers were astounded, but fortunately concluded that a mistake had been made. Dealing was suspended for a few minutes, when a warning was issued that a confirmation should be awaited, and great relief was felt on the flashing of the official \"no change\" announcement. News of the supposed change had been flashed around the world befo-e the error was discovered. Up to the close of the market here on Thursday no official exp-anation of the incident had been issued. Momy rates are -months' slightly firmer in London. On Thursday 2 , :ly; 4% previou. bills were 2 5-16% against 21 3 -months' bills 2%% against 2 4:-16@2%%; 4 -months' months' bills 2 9-16% against 29/8%, and 6 bills 29% against 2 9-16%. The Bank of England statement for the week ended July 15 shows a decrease in gold holdings of £611,052, the total standing at £165,199,894, which compares with £156,371,428 on July 16 1930. On Saturday the Bank of England bought £6,183 in gold bars and received £2,000 in sovereigns from abroad. On Monday the Bank sold £500,213 in gold bars, received £250,000 in sovereigns from abroad, and exported £83,000 in sovereigns. On Tuesday the Bank bought £657,313 in gold bars, receiV6d £6,500 in sovereigns from abroad, released £300,000 in sovereigns, exported £4,000 in sovereigns and sold £881,329 in gold bars. On Tuesday British bullion dealers reported that £550,000 South African gold available in the open market was secured for Continental account at a price of 84s. 119d. per ounce. The balance of £300,000 was taken later, also for Continental account. The £881,329 gold bars which the Bank sold was also taken for the Continent, but bullion brokers were unable to identify the source of the £657,313 gold bars received by the Bank and the destination of the £300,000 sovereigns which was released from earmark. On Wednesday the Bank of England sold £863,883 in gold bars and earmarked £2,000,000 and received £1,002,000 in sovereigns from abroad; exported £25,000 in sovereigns and set aside £2,000,000. On Thursday the Bank of England sold £3,000,000 in gold bars and set aside £2,000,000. On Friday the Bank of England sold £1,554,393 in gold bars, released £200,000 in sovereigns and exported £62,000 in sovereigns. At the Port of New York the god movement for the week ended July 15, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank o\" New York, consisted of imports of $103,000, chiefly from Latin America. There were no gold exports. There was an increase of $8,501Y,000 in gold earmarked for foreign account. The earmarking is believed to have been for the Bank of France. In tabular form the gold movement at the Port of New York for the week ended July 15, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was as follows: GOLD MOVEMENT AT NEW YORK, JULY 9 -JULY 15, INCL. Exports. Imports. $103,000 chiefly from Latin America I None. Net Change in Gold Earmarked for Foreign Account. Increase: 88,500,000. On Friday the New York Reserve Bank reported a shipment of $1,000,000 gold to Italy. During the week ended July 15 approximately $1 26%000 of 348 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE gold was received at San Francisco, of which $800,000 came from Japan and $468,000 from China. Canadian exchange continues at a discount. On Saturday Montreal funds were at 7-32 of 1% discount. On Monday Montreal improved to 3-16 of 1% but dropped on Tuesday to 5-16 of 1%. On Wednesday Montreal funds were at%of 1% discount on Thursday at 9-32 of 1% discount, and on Friday at 11-32 of 1% discount. Referring to day-to-day rates, sterling exchange on Saturday last was in demand. Bankers' sight was 4.86 7-16@4.863,; cable transfers 4.86%@ 4.86 11-16. On Monday the market was demoralized over the German situation. Sterling broke sharply. The range was 4.843/@4.85 13-16 for bankers' sight 2 and 4.85 3-16@4.86 for cable transfers. On Tuesday the market was highly irregular with sterling under pressure. The range was 4.85%@4.85 9-16 for bankers' sight and 4.85%@4.859 for cable transfers. On Wednesday, under severe pressure abroad, sterling collapsed to 4.833 for cable transfers. The range was 4.83@4.85 for bankers' sight and 4.833 @4.853 for cable transfers. On Thursday sterling was firmer and in strong demand. The range was 4.843'1@4.85% for bankers' sight and 4.84%@4.85% for cable transfers. On Friday the range was 4.84 5-16@4.8531 for bankers' sight and 4.84%@ 4.85 5-16 for cable transfers. Closing quotations on Friday were 4.847 for demand and 4.851 for cable 4 % transfers. Commercial sight bills finished at 4.84%; 60-day bills at 4.82; 90-day bills at 4.81; documents for payment (60 days) at 4.82, and seven day grain bills at 4.84 5-16. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4.84%. Exchange on the Continental countries has been largely demoralized in consequence of the financial crisis in Germany. German marks have fluctuated widely during the week, cable transfers going as low as 21.00 in the New York market in Wednesday's trading, which was 2.72% points below final quotations for Berlin marks on Friday of last week and 2.82 points under par, which is 23.82. At times on Wednesday marks were quoted as low as 20.75. Quotations for marks throughout the week, however, have been largely nominal, and, so far as could be ascertained, there were practically no transactions in the currency either in New York or in any foreign centre. On Wednesday the Reichsbank increased its rate of rediscount from 7 to 10% and at the same time raised its rate on Lombard loans from 7% to 15%. On Wednesday the Reichsbank announced that it had lowered its minimum legal cover for note circulation from 40 to 30%, making possible the emission of approximately 1,000,000,000 reichsmarks additional circulation to meet demands for currency looked for at the opening of the banks of Germany on Thursday. The increasingly grave condition of the German exchange situation has been traced here from week to week since the end of May. At the present juncture the situation became extremely critical on Saturday last, when the Berlin Boerse opened weak after it became known that Dr. Hans Luther, President of the Reichsbank, had met with no success,in his Paris negotiations for a large central bank loan to the Reichsbank. There was a tremendously heavy demand for foreign exchange in Germany on Saturday, with the result that spot marks were forced below the gold shipping point in the leading centres. In London the mark broke to [VoL. 133. 20.525 marks to the pound and in New York to 23.70, equaling the till then low point for the year. Even so, on Saturday a quotation of 23.693/i was made in New York, but to all appearances no business was done at that figure. The Reichsbank statement as of July 15 showed a decline in reserves of gold and foreign exchange for the week of 8.00% to 35.8% from 43.8%. Up until Wednesday the legal minimum was 40%, with which this statement must be compared. Future statements are to be compared with the new legal minimum of 30%. On July 7 the Reichsbank had gold reserves of 1,421,756,000 reichsmarks against a note circulation of 4,110,418,000 reichsmarks, giving actual gold cover of 34.5%. The new law requires a minimum cover, gold and foreign exchange, of 30%. The crisis was intensely aggrevated by the failure of the Darmstaedter und Nationalbank, the fourth largest bank in Germany, which closed its doors on Monday, July 13. The Chairman of the board of Darmstaedter, Jacob Goldschmidt, stated that one-third of all withdrawals of foreign credits from private banks in Germany in the past three months, totaling 650,000,000 marks ($154,700,000), had been taken out of the Darmstaedter Bank. Mr. Goldschmidt is reported to have said: \"The bank could have withstood the strain if foreign credits had been forthcoming. The bank has been accused of concealing its condition, but the Reichsbank had full knowledge of the situation. Now we are trusting that the Reich's Guarantee Liquidation Commission may enable the Darmstaedter und National bank to meet its present obligations and effectuate a reorganization.\" This bank failure started runs on all the German banks on Monday and the resultant rush to withdraw further foreign funds from Germany compelled the Government to declare a bank holiday on Tuesday and Wednesday pending the formulation of plans for establishing a dictatorial bank control. On Thursday the banks were allowed to reopen and a special supervisor was named. The banks were reopened to pay out currency for salaries and • for other essential purposes. From Monday until Thursday the worst was feared. A moratorium applying to internal and external banking operations was generally expected. However, this measure was avoided. Finance Minister Dietrich stated on Thursday: \"In agreement with the Reichsbank I consider it a matter of course to make interest and sinking fund payments on long-term loans of German debtors.\" Herr Hermann Schmitz, director of the I.G. Farbenindustrie (the dye trust), was appointed by the Government as GovernorCommissioner of Business and Finance, entrusted with the supervision of all banks. Details of the Reich's emergency decrees governing the crisis will be found on another page. The measures taken by the German Government to keep the financial situation under control met with a favorable reception in banking circles both here and abroad and calmed the fears of troubled investors, who had been inclined to repatriate their balances held abroad. The outlook showed material improvement on Thursday, so that German cable transfers were quoted 22.75, up 175 points from the close of the market on Wednesday. It is fully expected that there will be a steady improvement in the rate from now on. The low quotations for marks this week, which were at all times far below shipping points for gold from Berl'n JULY 18 19311 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE 349 to other centers, are, as stated above, largely nominal week.
