        "text": "Hardwood flooring adds character and value to your home.

There are a variety of product options available for every lifestyle and budget, including engineered hardwood floors that are the perfect fit for the harshest SK winters!\n\nAre There Different Styles of Hardwood Flooring?\n\nHardwood flooring comes in an array of styles, colours, and sizes, so the limits are almost endless.\n\nThe different styles are characterized by distinctive features like:\n\nPlank Length\n\nPlank Width\n\nWood Grain\n\nColour\n\nShine Level\n\nTexture\n\nEach hardwood flooring option has different strength levels and levels of wear resistance. There are modern and traditional hardwood flooring options, including minimalist, smooth-grained looks, as well as rustic and distressed.\n\nWhich Species of Wood Are Used in Flooring?\n\nWe proudly offer several species of hardwood flooring in our local flooring store.\n\nAll our products are Floor Score Certified to add to your assurance of quality. They are all legally harvested products and follow the regulatory rules for sustainable harvest.\n\nOur most popular types of hardwood flooring include:\n\nWhite Oak\n\nRed Oak\n\nMaple\n\nHickory\n\nBirch\n\nOur products come from all over the world, so you’ll also see a fewexotic hardwood species as well. We carry widths from 3” to 9” and everything from fine finish through to rustic.\n\nBest Hardwood Trends\n\nCurrently, one of our most popular hardwood flooring options is cozy, country-style wood.\n\nHardwood flooring companies are taking advantage of technology that allows them to transform fresh lumber into rustic, time-worn pieces. For unique looks, be sure to consider exotic wood flooring types like bamboo and cork.\n\nBamboo has a light hue and sophisticated patterns of dark markings.\n\nCork has a natural, rustic look.\n\nOur flooring experts and designers will help you choose the hardwood style that best fits your overall decor vision.\n\nWhat’s The Difference Between Solid and Engineered Hardwood?\n\nToday there are two main types of hardwood – solid and engineered.\n\nEach offers its benefits and drawbacks that are important to consider when shopping for new floors.\n\nSolid hardwood flooring is your traditional hardwood option, made of a single, solid piece of wood that is on average about ¾\" thick. Naturally beautiful and adding to your property value, solid hardwood can be refinished multiple times. However, it’s vulnerable to excessive moisture and cannot go below grade.\n\nEngineered hardwood flooring is a newer type of hardwood often mistaken for laminate. Made in layers, it’s stable, water and humidity resistant, kid and pet friendly, and uses less wood to manufacture. Engineered hardwood can even be installed below grade.\n\nDoes Humidity Affect Hardwood?\n\nYes, humidity isn’t hardwood flooring’s friend!\n\nWhile we can get past a bad hair day, humidity can cause permanent damage to hardwood flooring, so it’s best to avoid it as best as you can. This means checking the humidity level of your room, which our in-house team of installers can do during our free at-home estimates.\n\nBoth cold, dry winters and hot, humid summers can have negative effects on hardwood, including:\n\nWarping\n\nBuckling\n\nCupping\n\nChipping\n\nExpanding\n\nContracting\n\nIf you have climate control systems you should be all set, or you can also choose to install engineered hardwood floors.\n\nWhere Should Hardwood Floors Be Installed?\n\nThanks to modern innovation, you can install today's hardwood floors in a wide range of spaces in your home or business.\n\nSolid hardwood flooring is best suited for dry areas like bedrooms, living rooms, and other above-ground spaces.\n\nEngineered hardwood flooring can be installed both below and above-ground in places like kitchens, basements, hallways, and entryways. There's also 100% waterproof engineered hardwood, which can handle kitchens and bathrooms and other high humidity, moisture-prone rooms without worry.\n\nShould I Have My Floor Professionally Installed?\n\nNo matter the type of flooring, we always recommend professional installation, especially for hardwood flooring.\n\nOur installers will work with you every step of the way and answer any questions you have. They will prepare the subfloor, making sure it is dry, flat, and free of imperfections. This step is very important because you don't want there to be moisture underneath the hardwood planks, which will cause damage over time.\n\nSolid hardwood can be installed using two different methods, nail or glue-down. These types of installations are permanent, and your floor won’t shift. Engineered hardwood floors come in floating floor systems, meaning you won’t need any adhesives since the planks click together.\n\nIs There Quality Hardwood Flooring Near Me?\n\nYes! At Carpet One Floor & Home, we offer the best hardwood flooring in Yorkton, Saskatchewan. Our experts are here to listen to your wood flooring ideas and help you find a style you love."
