        "text": "The alfalfa weevil ( Hypera postica Gyllenhal, Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest of alfalfa crops. Chemical control measures are inefficient, but the larvae are often infested by parasitoid wasps of the genus Bathyplectes Förster (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), which offer a potential biological control strategy. The development of effective biological control requires the identification of parasitoid species, but conventional methods involve the rearing of parasitoids to the puparium stage for morphological confirmation. Here we designed a PCR method in which two pairs of primers are used to detect and identify Bathyplectes curculionis Thomson and Bathyplectes anura Thomson larvae in a faster way. We compared conventional rearing to the new method as a means to determine the parasitism rates caused by each species in Spain during the 2019 and 2020 seasons. In 2019, the PCR method detected five times as many B. curculionis events and twice as many B. anura events. Similarly, in 2020, the PCR method detected seven times as many B. curculionis events and twice as many B. anura events. High mortality of H. postica larvae was recorded in 2020 due to an epizootic attack by the fungus Zoophthora phytonomi Arthur (Zygomycetes: Entomophthorales), explaining the lower overall rate of parasitism and the widespread death of the larvae. Statistical analysis confirmed that the PCR method is more sensitive than conventional rearing for the detection of target parasitoids. However, only rearing can confirm the effective parasitism or the presence of unexpected species. We therefore recommend the use of both methods in parallel when evaluating host–parasitoid systems.\n\nIntroduction: Species of Mesochorus are found worldwide and members of this genus are primarily hyperparasitoids of Ichneumonoidea and Tachinidae. Objectives: To describe species of Costa Rican Mesochorus reared from caterpillars and to a lesser extent Malaise-trapped. Methods: The species are diagnosed by COI mtDNA barcodes, morphological inspection, and host data. A suite of images and host data (plant, caterpillar, and primary parasitoid) are provided for each species. Results: A total of 158 new species of Mesochorus. Sharkey is the taxonomic authority for all. Conclusions: This demonstrates a practical application of DNA barcoding that can be applied to the masses of undescribed neotropical insect species in hyperdiverse groups.\n\nThe alfalfa weevil Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest of alfalfa worldwide. In Spain, insecticide sprayings are mainly used for control with low efficacy. As a potential more sustainable control method, we determined the effectiveness of an alfalfa winter cutting for reducing pest populations in the spring and its interaction with parasitism rate due to Bathyplectes spp. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). Forty-two commercial fields were split in two parts and one was mowed during winter. Larval abundance in each part of the field was sampled by sweep netting in 2019 and 2020 before the first alfalfa spring cutting, when damage is caused. The rates of parasitism due to Bathyplectes anura (Thomson) and Bathyplectes curculionis (Thomson) were estimated by rearing larvae in the laboratory. Winter cutting significantly reduced the spring larval weevil populations and favored the rate of larval parasitism. Our results suggest that winter cutting can be a useful cultural method for alfalfa weevil control that has potential to be a component of an integrated pest management program.\n\nBackground: Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered an important cause in the global biodiversity loss and their role was recognised by the Convention on Biological Diversity which included IAS among the Aichi Biodiversity Targets to be reached by 2020. For fast and accurate identification of IAS, DNA barcoding arises as an optimal method. Here we focus on alien Ponto-Caspian amphipods in the Belarusian part of the Central European invasion corridor and their identification through DNA barcoding. Nine species of Ponto-Caspian amphipods are known to have invaded the water bodies of Belarus: Chelicorophium curvispinum, Chelicorophium robustum, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, Dikerogammarus villosus, Echinogammarus ischnus, Echinogammarus trichiatus, Obesogammarus crassus, Obesogammarus obesus, and Pontogammarus robustoides. Despite a well-developed checklist of alien amphipods for Belarus, the presence of additional IAS (such as Echinogammarus trichiatus, Dikerogammarus bispinosus, Chelicorophium mucronatum, or Chaetogammarus warpachowskyi) might go undetected due to misidentification (especially in early developmental stages) or cryptic speciation. Results: Barcodes were obtained from 395 specimens, representing nine species (100 %) of alien amphipods of Belarus. Mean intraspecific divergences were 0.16 %, while average congeneric sequence divergences were 20.35 %. BIN assignments corresponded perfectly with current species boundaries in 89 % of these species. Amphipods identified as E. ischnus were separated into two BINs. Deep divergences (> 3 %) were noted for Ch. curvispinum: mean intraspecific distance was 2.40 %, while maximum intraspecific distance reached 5.89 % (an indication of potential cryptic species). DNA barcoding confirmed the misidentification of D. bispinosus and the presence of E. trichiatus in Belarus. Significance: This is the first effort to provide a molecular inventory of alien Ponto-Caspian amphipod species known from the Belarusian part of the Central European invasion corridor. Moreover, the results of this study will be used to update the national checklist of alien amphipods of Belarus."
