        "text": "A-9.1.1.1.(1) Application of Part 9 to Seasonally and Intermittently Occupied Buildings. The Vancouver By-law does not provide separate requirements which would apply to seasonally or intermittently occupied buildings. Without compromising the basic health and safety provisions, however, various requirements in Part 9 recognize that leniency may be appropriate in some circumstances. With greater use of “cottages” through the winter months, the proliferation of seasonally occupied multiple-dwelling buildings and the increasing installation of modern conveniences in these buildings, the number and extent of possible exceptions is reduced.\n\nThermal Insulation\n\nArticle 9.25.2.1. specifies that insulation is to be installed in walls, ceilings and floors which separate heated space from unheated space. Cottages intended for use only in the summer and which, therefore, have no space heating appliances, would not be required to be insulated. Should a heating system be installed at some later date, insulation should also be installed at that time. In the case of row units intended for intermittent winter use, the walls between the dwelling units may at times separate heated space from unheated space. In this case, the installation of insulation might be considered.\n\nAir Barrier Systems and Vapour Barriers\n\nArticles 9.25.3.1. and 9.25.4.1. require the installation of air barrier systems and vapour barriers only where insulation is installed. Dwellings with no heating system would thus be exempt from these requirements.\n\nInterior Wall and Ceiling Finishes\n\nThe choice of interior wall and ceiling finishes has implications for fire safety. Where a dwelling is a detached building, there are no fire resistance requirements for the walls or ceilings within the dwelling. The exposed surfaces of walls and ceilings are required to have a flame-spread rating not greater than 150 (Subsection 9.10.17.). There is, therefore, considerable flexibility, even in continuously occupied dwellings, with respect to the materials used to finish these walls. Except where waterproof finishes are required (Subsection 9.29.2.), ceilings and walls may be left unfinished. Where two units adjoin, however, additional fire resistance requirements may apply to interior loadbearing walls, floors and the shared wall (Article 9.10.8.3., and Subsections 9.10.9. and 9.10.11.).\n\nPlumbing and Electrical Facilities\n\nPlumbing fixtures are required only where a piped water supply is available (Subsection 9.31.4.), and electrical facilities only where electrical services are available (Article 9.34.1.2.).\n\nA-9.3.2.1.(1) Grade Marking of Lumber. Lumber is generally grouped for marketing into the species combinations contained in Table A-9.3.2.1.(1)A. The maximum allowable spans for those combinations are listed in the span tables for joists, rafters and beams. Some species of lumber are also marketed individually. Since the allowable span for the northern species combination is based on the weakest species in the combination, the use of the span for this combination is permitted for any individual species not included in the Spruce-Pine-Fir, Douglas Fir-Larch and Hemlock-Fir combinations.\n\nFacsimiles of typical grade marks of lumber associations and grading agencies accredited by the Canadian Lumber Standards (CLS) Accreditation Board to grade mark lumber in Canada are shown in Table A-9.3.2.1.(1)B. Accreditation by the CLS Accreditation Board applies to the inspection, grading and grade marking of lumber, including mill supervisory service, in accordance with CAN/CSA-O141, “Softwood Lumber.”\n\nThe grade mark of a CLS accredited agency on a piece of lumber indicates its assigned grade, species or species combination, moisture condition at the time of surfacing, the responsible grader or mill of origin and the CLS accredited agency under whose supervision the grading and marking was done.\n\nCanadian lumber is graded to the NLGA “Standard Grading Rules for Canadian Lumber (Interpretation Included),” published by the National Lumber Grades Authority. The NLGA rules specify standard grade names and grade name abbreviations for use in grade marks to provide positive identification of lumber grades. In a similar fashion, standard species names or standard species abbreviations, symbols or marks are provided in the rules for use in grade marks.\n\nGrade marks denote the moisture content of lumber at the time of surfacing. “S-Dry” in the mark indicates the lumber was surfaced at a moisture content not exceeding 19%. “MC 15” indicates a moisture content not exceeding 15%. “S-GRN” in the grade mark signifies that the lumber was surfaced at a moisture content higher than 19% at a size to allow for natural shrinkage during seasoning.\n\nEach mill or grader is assigned a permanent number. The point of origin of lumber is identified in the grade mark by use of a mill or grader number or by the mill name or abbreviation. The CLS certified agency under whose supervision the lumber was grade marked is identified in the mark by the registered symbol of the agency.\n\nA-Table 9.3.2.1. Lumber Grading. To identify board grades, the paragraph number of the NLGA rules under which the lumber is graded must be shown in the grade mark. Paragraph 113 is equivalent to WWPA rules and paragraph 114 is equivalent to WCLIB rules. When graded in accordance with WWPA or WCLIB rules, the grade mark will not contain a paragraph number.\n\nA-9.3.2.8.(1) Non-Standard Lumber. The NLGA “Standard Grading Rules for Canadian Lumber (Interpretation Included)” permit lumber to be dressed to sizes below the standard sizes (38 × 89, 38 × 140, 38 × 184, etc.) provided the grade stamp shows the reduced size. This Sentence permits the use of the span tables for such lumber, provided the size indicated on the stamp is not less than 95% of the corresponding standard size. Allowable spans in the tables must be reduced a full 5% even if the undersize is less than the 5% permitted.\n\nA-9.3.2.9.(1) Protection from Termites.\n\nFigure A-9.3.2.9.(1) -A\n\nKnown termite locations\n\nNote to Figure A-9.3.2.9.(1) -A\n\nFigure A-9.3.2.9.(1) -B\n\nClearances under structural wood elements and visibility of supporting elements where required to permit inspection for termite infestation\n\nA-9.3.2.9.(3) Protection of Structural Wood Elements from Moisture and Decay. There are many above-ground, structural wood systems where precipitation is readily trapped or drying is slow, creating conditions conducive to decay. Beams extending beyond roof decks, junctions between deck members, and connections between balcony guards and walls are three examples.\n\nA-9.3.2.9.(4) Protection of Retaining Walls and Cribbing from Decay. Retaining walls supporting soil are considered to be structural elements of the building if a line drawn from the outer edge of the footing to the bottom of the exposed face of the retaining wall is greater than 45° to the horizontal. Retaining walls supporting soil may be structural elements of the building if the line described above has a lower slope.\n\nFigure A-9.3.2.9.(4)\n\nIdentifying retaining walls that require preservative treatment\n\nRetaining walls that are not critical to the support of building foundations but are greater than 1.2 m in height may pose a danger of sudden collapse to persons adjacent to the wall if the wood is not adequately protected from decay. The height of the retaining wall or cribbing is measured as the vertical difference between the ground levels on each side of the wall.\n\nA-9.4.1.1. Structural Design. Article 9.4.1.1. establishes the principle that the structural members of Part 9 buildings must\n\ncomply with the prescriptive requirements provided in Part 9,\n\nbe designed in accordance with accepted good practice, or\n\nbe designed in accordance with Part 4 using the loads and limits on deflection and vibration specified in Part 9 or Part 4.\n\nUsually a combination of approaches is used. For example, even if the snow load calculation on a wood roof truss is based on Subsections 9.4.2., the joints must be designed in accordance with Part 4. Wall framing may comply with the prescriptive requirements in Subsections 9.23.3., 9.23.10., 9.23.11. and 9.23.12., while the floor framing may be engineered.\n\nDesign according to Part 4 or accepted good engineering practice, such as that described in the “Engineering Guide for Wood Frame Construction” (CWC Guide), published by the Canadian Wood Council, requires engineering expertise. The CWC Guide contains alternative solutions and provides information on the applicability of the Part 9 prescriptive structural requirements to further assist designers and building officials to identify the appropriate design approach. The need for professional involvement in the structural design of a building, whether to Part 4 or Part 9 requirements or accepted good practice, is defined by provincial and territorial legislation.\n\nA-9.4.1.1.(3) Structural Design for Lateral Wind and Earthquake Loads. The only explicit treatment of structural loads in Section 9.4. is for gravity; wind and earthquake loads are dealt with implicitly in Part 9. There is, therefore, a tendency to assume that wind and earthquake loads do not need any particular consideration in the design of Part 9 buildings.\n\nIn most cases this is true: the majority of low-rise, wood-frame buildings have a great deal of structural redundancy and continuity and have more than enough capacity to resist lateral loads due to wind and earthquake. For example, in a traditional house configuration, even if there are a few large openings in the exterior walls for windows and sliding doors, the many interior partitions act as braced or sheathed wall panels and provide adequate lateral stability.\n\nHowever, not all Part 9 buildings have configurations or details that will provide adequate resistance to lateral loads. For example, newer houses may have few interior partitions and very large openings in the exterior walls. Mercantile buildings might be long and narrow with almost entirely windowed walls on the ends and few structurally attached interior partitions. In such cases, wind and earthquake loads do have to be taken into consideration.\n\nFigure A-9.4.1.1.(3) -A\n\nMercantile building with little resistance to lateral loading\n\nMany buildings have been constructed, and some still are, with the lowest level exterior walls as short, wood-frame knee- or pony-walls. In the past, these were often constructed with no lateral bracing and with no interior partitions. See Figure A-9.4.1.1.(3)-B. These walls must be braced or sheathed to resist lateral loads from earthquakes. In higher load regions, they should be sheathed. In all regions, storeys with knee-walls should be considered as storeys for the purpose of determining building height and the application of the Part 9 structural requirements.\n\nFigure A-9.4.1.1.(3) -B\n\nCrawl space knee-wall with little resistance to lateral loading\n\nDesign Required\n\nIn cases where lateral load design is required, the “Engineering Guide for Wood Frame Construction” (CWC Guide) provides acceptable engineering solutions as an alternative to Part 4. The CWC Guide also contains alternative solutions and provides information on the applicability of the Part 9 prescriptive structural requirements to further assist designers and building officials to identify the appropriate design approach.\n\nA-9.4.2.1.(1) Application of Simplified Part 9 Snow Loads. The simplified specified snow loads described in Article 9.4.2.2. may be used where the structure is of the configuration that is typical of traditional wood-frame residential construction and its performance. This places limits on the spacing of joists, rafters and trusses, the spans of these members and supporting members, deflection under load, overall dimensions of the roof and the configuration of the roof. It assumes considerable redundancy in the structure.\n\nBecause very large buildings may be constructed under Part 9 by constructing firewalls to break up the building area, it is possible to have Part 9 buildings with very large roofs. The simplified specified snow loads may not be used when the total roof area of the overall structure exceeds 4 550 m2. Thus, the simplified specified snow load calculation may be used for typical townhouse construction but would not be appropriate for much larger commercial or industrial buildings, for example.\n\nThe simplified specified snow loads are also not designed to take into account roof configurations that seriously exacerbate snow accumulation. This does not pertain to typical projections above a sloped roof, such as dormers, nor does it pertain to buildings with higher and lower roofs. Although two-level roofs generally lead to drift loading, smaller light-frame buildings constructed according to Part 9 have not failed under these loads. Consequently, the simplified calculation may be used in these cases. Rather, this limitation on application of the simplified calculation pertains to roofs with high parapets or significant other projections above the roof, such as elevator penthouses, mechanical rooms or larger equipment that would effectively collect snow and preclude its blowing off the roof.\n\nThe reference to Article 9.4.3.1. invokes, for roof assemblies other than common lumber trusses, the same performance criteria for deflection.\n\nThe unit weight of snow on roofs, γ, obtained from measurements at a number of weather stations across Canada varied from about 1.0 to 4.5 kN/m3. An average value for use in design in lieu of better local data is γ = 3.0 kN/m3. In some locations the unit weight of snow may be considerably greater than 3.0 kN/m3. Such locations include regions where the maximum snow load on the roof is reached only after contributions from many snowstorms, coastal regions, and regions where winter rains are considerable and where a unit weight as high as 4.0 kN/m3 may be appropriate.\n\nA-9.4.2.3.(1) Accessible Platforms Subject to Snow and Occupancy Loads. Many platforms are subject to both occupancy loads and snow loads. These include balconies, decks, verandas, flat roofs over garages and carports. Where such a platform, or a segregated area of such a platform, serves a single dwelling unit, it must be designed for the greater of either the specified snow load or an occupancy load of 1.9 kPa. Where the platform serves more than one single dwelling unit or an occupancy other than a residential occupancy, higher occupancy loads will apply as specified in Table 4.1.5.3.\n\nA-9.4.2.4.(1) Specified Loads for Attics or Roof Spaces with Limited Accessibility. Typical residential roofs are framed with roof trusses and the ceiling is insulated.\n\nResidential trusses are placed at 600 mm on centre with web members joining top and bottom chords. Lateral web bracing is installed perpendicular to the span of the trusses. As a result, there is limited room for movement inside the attic or roof space or for storage of material. Access hatches are generally built to the minimum acceptable dimensions, further limiting the size of material that can be moved into the attic or roof space.\n\nWith exposed insulation in the attic or roof space, access is not recommended unless protective clothing and breathing apparatus are worn.\n\nThus the attic or roof space is recognized as uninhabitable and loading can be based on actual dead load. In emergency situations or for the purpose of inspection, it is possible for a person to access the attic or roof space without over-stressing the truss or causing damaging deflections.\n\nA-Table 9.4.4.1. Classification of Soils. Sand or gravel may be classified by means of a picket test in which a 38 mm by 38 mm picket bevelled at the end at 45° to a point is pushed into the soil. Such material is classified as “dense or compact” if a man of average weight cannot push the picket more than 200 mm into the soil and “loose” if the picket penetrates 200 mm or more.\n\nClay and silt may be classified as “stiff” if it is difficult to indent by thumb pressure, “firm” if it can be indented by moderate thumb pressure, “soft” if it can be easily penetrated by thumb pressure, where this test is carried out on undisturbed soil in the wall of a test pit.\n\nA-9.4.4.4.(1) Soil Movement. In susceptible soils, changes in temperature or moisture content can cause significant expansion and contraction. Soils containing pyrites can expand simply on exposure to air.\n\nExpansion and Contraction due to Moisture\n\nClay soils are most prone to expansion and contraction due to moisture. Particularly wet seasons can sufficiently increase the volume of the soil under and around the structure to cause heaving of foundations and floors-on-ground, or cracking of foundation walls. Particularly dry seasons or draw-down of water by fast-growing trees can decrease the volume of the soil supporting foundations and floors-on-ground, thus causing settling.\n\nFrost Heave\n\nFrost heave is probably the most commonly recognized phenomenon related to freezing soil. Frost heave results when moisture in frost-susceptible soil (clay and silt) under the footings freezes and expands. This mechanism is addressed by requirements in Section 9.12. regarding the depth of excavations.\n\nIce Lenses\n\nWhen moisture in frost-susceptible soils freezes, it forms an ice lens and reduces the vapour pressure in the soil in the area immediately around the lens. Moisture in the ground redistributes to rebalance the vapour pressures providing more moisture in the area of the ice lens. This moisture freezes to the lens and the cycle repeats itself. As the ice lens grows, it exerts pressure in the direction of heat flow. When lenses form close to foundations and heat flow is toward the foundation—as may be the case with unheated crawl spaces or open concrete block foundations insulated on the interior—the forces may be sufficient to crack the foundation.\n\nAdfreezing\n\nIce lenses can adhere themselves to cold foundations. Where heat flow is essentially upward, parallel to the foundation, the pressures exerted will tend to lift the foundation. This may cause differential movement or cracking of the foundation. Heat loss through basement foundations of cast-in-place concrete or concrete block insulated on the exterior appears to be sufficient to prevent adfreezing. Care must be taken where the foundation does not enclose heated space or where open block foundations are insulated on the interior. The installation of semi-rigid glass fibre insulation has demonstrated some effectiveness as a separation layer to absorb the adfreezing forces.\n\nPyrites\n\nPyrite is the most common iron disulphide mineral in rock and has been identified in rock of all types and ages. It is most commonly found in metamorphic and sedimentary rock, and especially in coal and shale deposits.\n\nWeathering of pyritic shale is a chemical-microbiological oxidation process that results in volume increases that can heave foundations and floors-on-ground. Concentrations of as little as 0.1% by weight have caused heaving. Weathering can be initiated simply by exposing the pyritic material to air. Thus, building on soils that contain pyrites in concentrations that will cause damage to the building should be avoided, or measures should be taken to remove the material or seal it. Material containing pyrites should not be used for backfill at foundations or for supporting foundations or floors-on-ground.\n\nWhere it is not known if the soil or backfill contains pyritic material in a deleterious concentration, a test is available to identify its presence and concentration.\n\nReferences:\n\n(1) Legget, R.F. and Crawford, C.B.

Loads on Foundations. The prescriptive solutions provided in Part 9 relating to footings and foundation walls only account for the loads imposed by drained earth. Drained earth is assumed to exert a load equivalent to the load that would be exerted by a fluid with a density of 480 kg/m3. The prescriptive solutions do not account for surcharges from saturated soil or additional loads from heavy objects located adjacent to the building. Where such surcharges are expected, the footings and foundation walls must be designed and constructed according to Part 4.\n\nA-9.5.1.2. Combination Rooms. If a room draws natural light and natural ventilation from another area, the opening between the two areas must be large enough to effectively provide sufficient light and air. This is why a minimum opening of 3 m2 is required, or the equivalent of a set of double doors. The effectiveness of the transfer of light and air also depends on the size of the transfer opening in relation to the size of the dependent room; in measuring the area of the wall separating the two areas, the whole wall on the side of the dependent room should be considered, not taking into account offsets that may be in the surface of the wall.\n\nThe opening does not necessarily have to be in the form of a doorway; it may be an opening at eye level. However, if the dependent area is a bedroom, provision must be made for the escape window required by Article 9.7.1.2. to fulfill its safety function. This is why a direct passage is required between the bedroom and the other area; the equivalent of at least a doorway is therefore required for direct passage between the two areas.\n\nA-Table 9.6.6.1. Glass in Doors. Maximum areas in Table 9.6.6.1. for other than fully tempered glazing are cut off at 1.50 m2, as this would be the practical limit after which safety glass would be required by Sentence 9.6.6.2.(3).\n\nA-9.6.6.3.(1) Mirrored Glass Doors. Standard CAN/CGSB-82.6-M covers mirrored glass doors for use on reach-in closets. It specifies that such doors are not to be used for walk-in closets.\n\nA-9.6.6.6.(1) Double Glazing for Glass Doors and Glass in Doors. Where a door consists of a large area of glass held in a frame, for example, sliding patio doors, the glass is considered to be glass in a door and would be required to be double glazed. Only where a door is solid glass and has no frame would the glass not be required to be double glazed.\n\nA-9.6.8.1. Forced Entry Via Glazing in Doors and Sidelights. There is no mandatory requirement that special glass be used in doors or sidelights, primarily because of cost. It is, however, a common method of forced entry to break glass in doors and sidelights to gain access to door hardware and unlock the door from the inside. Although insulated glass provides increased resistance over single glazing, the highest resistance is provided by laminated glass. Tempered glass, while stronger against static loads, is prone to shattering under high, concentrated impact loads.\n\nFigure A-9.6.8.1.\n\nCombined laminated/annealed glazing\n\nLaminated glass is more expensive than annealed glass and must be used in greater thicknesses. Figure A-9.6.8.1. shows an insulated sidelight made of one pane of laminated glass and one pane of annealed glass. This method reduces the cost premium that would result if both panes were laminated.\n\nConsideration should be given to using laminated glazing in doors and accompanying sidelights regulated by Article 9.6.6.1., in windows located within 900 mm of locks in such doors, and in basement windows.\n\nUnderwriters' Laboratories of Canada have produced a document ULC-S332, “Burglary Resisting Glazing Material,” which provides a test procedure to evaluate the resistance of glazing to attacks by thieves. While it is principally intended for plate glass show windows, it may be of value for residential purposes.\n\nA-9.6.8.5.(1) Door Fasteners. The purpose of the requirement for 30 mm screw penetration into solid wood is to prevent the door from being dislodged from the jamb due to impact forces. It is not the intent to prohibit other types of hinges or strikeplates that are specially designed to provide equal or greater protection.\n\nA-9.6.8.7.(1) Hinged Doors. Methods of satisfying this Sentence include either using non-removable pin hinges or modifying standard hinges by screw fastening a metal pin in a screw hole in one half of the top and bottom hinges. When the door is closed, the projecting portion of the pin engages in the corresponding screw hole in the other half of the hinge and then, even if the hinge pin is taken out, the door cannot be removed.\n\nA-9.6.8.9. Solid Blocking. Solidly blocking between a door frame and framing and horizontal blocking in the stud space will help to prevent the door frame from being forcibly spread and therefore disengaging the door latch. It is recommended that, after blocking, the door frame cannot be spread more than 7 mm.\n\nA-9.6.8.10.(1) Resistance of Doors To Forced Entry. This Sentence designates standard ASTM F 476, “Security of Swinging Door Assemblies,” as an alternate to compliance with the prescriptive requirements for doors and hardware. The annex to the standard provides four security classifications, with acceptance criteria, depending on the type of building and the crime rate of the area in which it is located. The NBC has only specified Grade 10, the minimum level. The annex suggests the following guidelines be followed when selecting security levels for door assemblies:\n\nGrade 10: This is the minimum security level and is quite adequate for single-family residential buildings located in stable, low-crime areas.\n\nGrade 20: This is the low–medium security level and is designed to provide security for residential buildings located in average crime-rate areas and for apartments in both low and average crime-rate areas.\n\nGrade 30: This is the medium–high security level and is designed to provide security for residential buildings located in higher than average crime-rate areas or for small commercial buildings in average or low crime-rate areas.\n\nGrade 40: This is the high security level and is designed for small commercial buildings located in high crime-rate areas. This level could also be used for residential buildings having an exceptionally high incidence of semi-skilled burglary attacks.\n\nAll these grades satisfy the By-law and can be considered for use where a higher level of security is desired or warranted.\n\nAll these grades satisfy the Code and can be considered for use where a higher level of security is desired or warranted.\n\nA-9.7.1.2.(1) Escape Windows from Bedrooms. Sentence 9.7.1.2.(1) generally requires every bedroom to have at least one window or door opening to the outside that is large enough and easy enough to open so that it can be used as an exit in the event that a fire prevents use of the building’s normal exits. The minimum unobstructed opening specified for escape windows must be achievable using only the normal window operating procedure. The escape path must not go through nor open onto another room, floor or space.\n\nhere a bedroom is located in a basement, an escape window or door must be located in the bedroom. It is not sufficient to rely on egress through other basement space to another escape window or door.\n\nWindow Height\n\nThe Article does not set a maximum sill height for escape windows; it is therefore possible to install a window or skylight that satisfies the requirements of the Article but defeats the Article’s intent by virtue of being so high that it cannot be reached for exit purposes. It is recommended that the sills of windows intended for use as emergency exits be not higher than 1.5 m above the floor. However, it is sometimes difficult to avoid having a higher sill: on skylights and windows in basement bedrooms for example. In these cases, it is recommended that access to the window be improved by some means such as built-in furniture installed below the window.\n\nFigure A-9.7.1.2.(1)\n\nBuilt-in furniture to improve access to a window\n\nA-9.7.1.2.(2) Bedroom Window Opening Areas and Dimensions. Although the minimum opening dimensions required for height and width are 380 mm, a window opening that is 380 mm by 380 mm would not comply with the minimum area requirements. (See Figure A-9.7.1.2.(2))\n\nFigure A-9.7.1.2.(2)\n\nWindow opening areas and dimensions\n\nA-9.7.1.4.(1) Double Glazing. In a cold climate such as Canada's, windows which separate heated space from unheated space or the exterior must be at least double glazed to prevent the accumulation of significant amounts of condensation on the inside surface of the glazing. Although glazing materials are generally unharmed by such condensation, the water can run down and damage the materials in the window frame and in the wall below the window. Water accumulating in these materials can also lead to the growth of moulds.\n\nBecause of the potential for damage to the structure, this measure is required in any heated building, whether or not there is normally human occupancy.\n\nA-9.7.1.5. Height of Window Sills above Floors or Ground. The primary intent of the requirement is to minimize the likelihood of small children falling significant heights from open windows. Reflecting reported cases, the requirement applies only to dwelling units and generally those located on the second floor or higher of residential or mixed use buildings where the windows are essentially free-swinging or free-sliding.\n\nFree-swinging or free-sliding means that a window that has been cracked open can be opened further by simply pushing on the openable part of the window. Care must be taken in selecting windows, as some with special operating hardware can still be opened further by simply pushing on the window.\n\nCasement windows with crank operators would be considered to conform to Clause (1)(b). To provide additional safety, where slightly older children are involved, occupants can easily remove the crank handles from these windows. Awning windows with scissor hardware, however, may not keep the window from swinging open once it is unlatched. Hopper windows would be affected only if an opening is created at the bottom as well as at the top of the window. The requirement will impact primarily on the use of sliding windows which do not incorporate devices in their construction that can be used to limit the openable area of the window.\n\nThe 100 mm opening limit is consistent with widths of openings that small children can fall through. It is only invoked, however, where the other dimension of the opening is more than 380 mm. Again, care must be taken in selecting a window. At some position, scissor hardware on an awning window may break up the open area such that there is no unobstructed opening with dimensions greater than 380 mm and 100 mm. At another position, however, though the window is not open much more, the hardware may not adequately break up the opening. The 450 mm height off the floor recognizes that furniture is often placed under windows and small children are often good climbers.\n\nA-9.7.2.1.(1) Window Standard. CSA Standard CAN/CSA-A440, “Windows,” includes a window classification system that rates the assembly according to airtightness, watertightness and wind load resistance. The ratings achieved by each window are marked on the window and indicate the level of performance that can be expected. Sentence 9.7.2.1.(1) references this standard and its companion document entitled CAN/CSA-A440.1, “User Selection Guide to CSA Standard CAN/CSA-A440-00, Windows,” to assist specifiers, manufacturers and general users in identifying the window ratings appropriate for a particular building, based on its geographic location and height.\n\nA-9.7.3.2.(1) Maximum Glass Area. Tables A-9.7.3.2.(1)A., A-9.7.3.2.(1)B. and A-9.7.3.2.(1)C. may be used to select glass thickness for windows subject to the following restrictions:\n\nThe building has essentially uniform distribution of openings, i.e., no large opening, such as a loading door.\n\nThe building height is 12 m or less from grade to the uppermost roof.\n\nThe building is not in an exposed location such as a hilltop or the shore of a large body of water.\n\nThese tables are based on standard CAN/CGSB-12.20-M. In many cases, glass design based on these tables will be conservative due to conservative assumptions on which the tables are based. More exact design using the standard directly could result in reduced glass thickness.\n\nA-9.7.6.1.(1) Resistance of Windows to Forced Entry. Although this Sentence only applies to windows within 2 m of adjacent ground level, certain house and site features, such as balconies or canopy roofs, allow for easy access to windows at higher elevations. Consideration should be given to specifying break-in resistant windows in such locations.\n\nThis Sentence does not apply to windows that do not serve the interior of the dwelling unit, such as windows to garages, sun rooms or greenhouses, provided connections between these spaces and the dwelling unit are secure.\n\nOne method that is often used to improve the resistance of windows to forced entry is the installation of metal “security bars.” However, while many such installations are effective in increasing resistance to forced entry, they may also reduce or eliminate the usefulness of the window as an exit in case of fire or other emergency that prevents use of the normal building exits. Indeed, unless such devices are easily openable from the inside, their installation in some cases would contravene the requirements of Article 9.7.1.2., which requires every bedroom that does not have an exterior door to have at least one window that is large enough and easy enough to open that it can be used as an exit in case of emergency. Thus an acceptable security bar system should be easy to open from the inside while still providing increased resistance to entry from the outside.\n\nA-9.8.4. Step Dimensions. The By-law distinguishes three principal types of stair treads and uses the following terminology to describe them: rectangular treads are found in straight-run flights; angled treads are found in curved flights; winders are a special type of angled tread described in Appendix Note A-9.8.4.5. See Figure A-9.8.4.\n\nFigure A-9.8.4.\n\nTypes of treads\n\nA-9.8.4.5. Winders. Where a stair must turn, the safest method of incorporating the turn is to use a landing. Within a dwelling unit, however, where occupants are familiar with their environment, winders are an acceptable method of reducing the amount of floor area devoted to the stair and have not been shown to be more hazardous than a straight run of steps. Nevertheless, care is required to ensure that winders are as safe as possible. Experience has shown that 30° winders are the best compromise and require the least change in the natural gait of the stair user; 45° winders are also acceptable, as they are wider. The By-law permits only these two angles. Although it is normal By-law practice to specify upper and lower limits, in this case it is necessary to limit the winders to specific angles with no tolerance above or below these angles other than normal construction tolerances. One result of this requirement is that winder-type turns in stairs are limited to 30° or 45° (1 winder), 60° (2 winders), or 90° (2 or 3 winders). See Figure A-9.8.4.5.\n\nFigure A-9.8.4.5.\n\nWinders\n\nA-9.8.4.6. Tread Projection and Leading Edge of Steps. A sloped or beveled edge on nosings or leading edges of steps will make the tread more visible through light modeling. The sloped portion of the leading edge must not be too wide so as to reduce the risk of slipping of the foot. To reduce the risk of tripping, the leading edge must not reduce the effective tread depth to less than the required minimum tread depth less 15 mm. Similarly, the projection of the tread behind the nosing can also cause tripping, particularly during a person's ascent. Figure A-9.8.4.6. illustrates the various dimensional requirements stated in Sentences 9.8.4.6.(1) and 9.8.4.3.(2).\n\nFigure A-9.8.4.6.\n\nTread depth and treatment of leading edge\n\nA-9.8.6.3.(1) Dimensions of Landings. Figure A-9.8.6.3.(1) illustrates various landing configurations.\n\nFigure A-9.8.6.3.(1)\n\nLanding configurations\n\nA-9.8.7.2. Continuity of Handrails. The guidance and support provided by handrails is particularly important at the beginning and end of ramps and flights of stairs and at changes in direction such as at landings and winders.\n\nThe intent of the requirement in Sentence (1) for handrails to be continuous throughout the length of the stair is that the handrail be continuous from the bottom riser to the top riser of the stair. The required handrail may start back from the bottom riser only if it is supported by a newel post installed on the bottom tread. (See Figure A-9.8.7.2.)\n\nFor stairs or ramps serving a single dwelling unit, the intent of the requirement in Sentence (2) for handrails to be continuous throughout the length of the flight is that the handrail be continuous from the bottom riser to the top riser of the flight. Once again, the required handrail may start back from the bottom riser only if it is supported by a newel post installed on this line. (See Figure A-9.8.7.2.) With regard to stairs serving a single dwelling unit, the handrail may terminate at landings.\n\nIn the case of stairs within dwelling units that incorporate winders, the handrail should be configured so that it will in fact provide guidance and support to the stair user throughout the turn through the winder.\n\nFigure A-9.8.7.2.\n\nContinuity of handrails at the top and bottom of stairs and flights\n\nA-9.8.7.3.(1) Termination of Handrails. Handrails are required to be installed so as not to obstruct pedestrian travel. To achieve this end, the rail should not extend so far into a hallway as to reduce the clear width of the hallway to less than the required width. Where the stair terminates in a room or other space, likely paths of travel through that room or space should be assessed to ensure that any projection of the handrail beyond the end of the stair will not interfere with pedestrian travel. As extensions of handrails beyond the first and last riser are not required in dwelling units (see Sentence 9.8.7.3.(2)) and as occupants of dwellings are generally familiar with their surroundings, the design of dwellings would not generally be affected by this requirement.\n\nHandrails are also required to terminate in a manner that will not create a safety hazard to blind or visually impaired persons, children whose heads may be at the same height as the end of the rail, or persons wearing loose clothing or carrying items that might catch on the end of the rail. One approach to reducing potential hazards is returning the handrail to a wall, floor or post. Again, within dwelling units, where occupants are generally familiar with their surroundings, returning the handrail to a wall, floor or post may not be necessary. For example, where the handrail is fastened to a wall and does not project past the wall into a hallway or other space, a reasonable degree of safety is assumed to be provided; other alternatives may provide an equivalent level of protection.\n\nA-9.8.7.3.(2) Handrail Extensions. As noted in Appendix Note A-9.8.7.2., the guidance and support provided by handrails is particularly important at the beginning and end of ramps and flights of stairs and at changes in direction. The extended handrail provides guidance and allows users to steady themselves upon entering or leaving a ramp or flight of stairs. Such extensions are particularly useful to visually-impaired persons, and persons with physical disabilities or who are encumbered in their use of the stairs or ramp.\n\nA-9.8.7.4. Height of Handrails. Handrails that do not meet the height criteria for required handrails may be installed, provided they are in addition to the required handrails.\n\nA-9.8.7.5.(2) Handrail Sections. Handrails are intended to provide guidance and support to stair users. To fulfil this intent, handrails must be “graspable.” Acceptable handrail sections include, but are not limited to, those shown below.\n\nFigure A-9.8.7.5.(2)\n\nHandrail sections\n\nA-9.8.7.7. Attachment of Handrails. Handrails are intended to provide guidance and support to the stair user and to arrest falls. The loads on handrails may therefore be considerable. The attachment of handrails serving a single dwelling unit may be accepted on the basis of experience or structural design.\n\nA-9.8.8.1. Required Guards. The requirements relating to guards stated in Part 9 are based on the premise that, wherever there is a difference in elevation of 600 mm or more between two floors, or between a floor or other surface to which access is provided for other than maintenance purposes and the next lower surface, the risk of injury in a fall from the higher surface is sufficient to warrant the installation of some kind of barrier to reduce the chances of such a fall. A wall along the edge of the higher surface will obviously prevent such a fall, provided the wall is sufficiently strong that a person cannot fall through it. Where there is no wall, a guard must be installed. Because guards clearly provide less protection than walls, additional requirements apply to guards to ensure that a minimum level of protection is provided. These relate to the characteristics described in A-9.8.8.3., A-9.8.8.5.(1) and (2), A-9.8.8.5.(3) and A-9.8.8.6.\n\nExamples of such surfaces where the difference in elevation could exceed 600 mm and consequently where guards would be required include, but are not limited to, landings, porches, balconies, mezzanines, galleries, and raised walkways. Especially in exterior settings, surfaces adjacent to walking surfaces, stairs or ramps often are not parallel to the walking surface or the surface of the treads or ramps. Consequently, the walking surface, stair or ramp may need protection in some locations but not in others. (See Figure A-9.8.8.1.) In some instances, grades are artificially raised close to walking surfaces, stairs or ramps to avoid installing guards. This provides little or no protection for the users. That is why the requirements specify differences in elevation not only immediately adjacent to the construction but also for a distance of 1 200 mm from it by requiring that the slope of the ground be within certain limits. (See Figure A-9.8.8.1.)\n\nFigure A-9.8.8.1.\n\nRequired locations of guards\n\nA-9.8.8.1.(4) Protection Around Swimming Pools. Fences and gates enclosing swimming pools are intended to prevent unsupervised people and especially children from gaining access to a pool. The protective barrier may be located at the property boundary and may comprise building walls, gates and other barriers that meet guard requirements.\n\nA-9.8.8.2. Loads on Guards. Guards must be constructed so as to be strong enough to protect persons from falling under normal use. Many guards installed in dwelling units or on exterior stairs serving one or two dwelling units have demonstrated acceptable performance over time. The loading described in the first row of Table 9.8.8.2. is intended to be consistent with the performance provided by these guards. Examples of guard construction presented in Chapter SG7 of the Supplementary Guidelines to the 1997 Ontario Building Code meet the criteria set in the National Building Code for loads on guards, including the more stringent requirements of Sentences 9.8.8.2.(1) and (2).\n\nThe load on guards within dwelling units, or on exterior guards serving not more than two dwelling units, is to be imposed over an area of the guard such that, where standard balusters are used and installed at the maximum 100 mm spacing permitted for required guards, 3 balusters will be engaged. Where the balusters are wider, only two may be engaged unless they are spaced closer together. Where the guard is not required, and balusters are installed more than 100 mm apart, fewer balusters may be required to carry the imposed load.\n\nA-9.8.8.3. Minimum Heights. Guard heights are generally based on the waist heights of average persons. Generally, lower heights are permitted in dwelling units because the occupants become familiar with the potential hazards, and situations which lead to pushing and jostling under crowded conditions are less likely to arise.\n\nA-9.8.8.5.(1) and (2) Risk of Falling through Guards. The risk of falling through a guard is especially prevalent for children. Therefore the requirements are stringent for guards in all buildings except industrial buildings, where children are unlikely to be present except under strict supervision.\n\nA-9.8.8.5.(3) Risk of Children Getting Their Heads Stuck between Balusters. The requirements to prevent children falling through guards also serve to provide adequate protection against this problem. However, guards are often installed where they are not required by the Code; i.e., in places where the difference in elevation is less than 600 mm. In these cases, there is no need to require the openings between balusters to be less than 100 mm. However, there is a range of openings between 100 mm and 200 mm in which children can get their heads stuck. Therefore, openings in this range are not permitted except in buildings of industrial occupancy, where children are unlikely to be present except under strict supervision.\n\nA-9.8.8.6. Risk of Children Climbing Over Guards. Guards are sometimes constructed with horizontal or near-horizontal members between balusters such that a ladder effect is achieved; this can be very tempting for young children to climb, thus exposing themselves to risk of falling over the guard. Such construction is not permitted for required guards in buildings of residential occupancy.\n\nA-9.9.4.5.(1) Openings in Exterior Walls of Exits.\n\nFigure A-9.9.4.5.(1)\n\nProtection of openings in exterior walls of exits\n\nA-9.9.8.4.(1) Independent and Remote Exits. Subsection 9.9.8. requires that some floor areas have more than one exit. The intent is to ensure that, if one exit is made untenable or inaccessible by a fire, one or more other exits will be available to permit the occupants to escape. However, if the exits are close together, all exits might be made untenable or inaccessible by the same fire. Sentence 9.9.8.4.(1) therefore requires at least two of the exits to be located remotely from each other. This is not a problem in many buildings falling under Part 9. For instance, apartment buildings usually have exits located at either end of long corridors. However, in other types of buildings (e.g. dormitory and college residence buildings) this is often difficult to accomplish and problems arise in interpreting the meaning of the word “remote.” Article 3.4.2.3. is more specific, generally requiring the distance between exits to be one half the diagonal dimension of the floor area or at least 9 m. However, it is felt that such criteria would be too restrictive to impose on the design of all the smaller buildings which come under Part 9. Nevertheless, the exits should be placed as far apart as possible and the Part 3 criteria should be used as a target. Designs in which the exits are so close together that they will obviously both become contaminated in the event of a fire are not acceptable.\n\nA-9.9.9.1.(1) Travel Limit to Exits or Egress Doors. In clause (b), an exit doorway near adjacent ground level means the exit door is located not more than one storey above or below the adjacent ground level.\n\nA-9.10.1.2.(8) Installation of Sprinkler, Standpipe and Hose Systems. Some provisions captured by the cross-reference to Subsection 3.2.5. go beyond the intended application of the cross-reference. Provisions in Subsection 3.2.5. that apply to other than sprinkler, standpipe or hose systems — for example, the provisions regarding access for firefighting purposes — do not apply to Part 9 buildings.\n\nSimilarly, in the context of the cross-reference, Subsection 3.2.5. applies only where sprinkler, standpipe or hose systems are installed in a Part 9 building, whether the installation is voluntary or for the purpose of complying with the provisions in Part 9. Provisions in Subsection 3.2.5. that identify buildings or spaces in which these systems are to be installed do not apply: for example, Article 3.2.5.9. on standpipes.\n\nA-9.10.1.3.(1) Commercial Cooking Equipment. Part 6 refers to NFPA 96, “Ventilation Control and Fire Protection of Commercial Cooking Operations,” which in turn references “Commercial Cooking Equipment.” However, the deciding factor as to whether or not NFPA 96 applies is the potential for production of grease-laden vapours and smoke, rather than the type of equipment used. While NFPA 96 does not apply to domestic equipment for normal residential family use, it should apply to domestic equipment used in commercial, industrial, institutional and similar cooking applications where the potential for the production of smoke and grease-laden vapours exceeds that for normal residential family use.\n\nA-9.10.3.1. Fire and Sound Resistance of Building Assemblies. The following tables may be used to select building assemblies for compliance with Article 9.10.3.1. and Subsection 9.11.2.\n\nTables A-9.10.3.1.A. and A-9.10.3.1.B. have been developed from information gathered from tests. While a large number of the assemblies listed were tested, the fire-resistance and acoustical ratings for others were assigned on the basis of extrapolation of information from tests of similar assemblies. Where there was enough confidence relative to the fire performance of an assembly, the fire-resistance ratings were assigned relative to the commonly used minimum ratings of 30 min, 45 min and 1 h, including a designation of “< 30 min” for assemblies that are known not to meet the minimum 30-minute rating. Where there was not enough comparative information on an assembly to assign to it a rating with confidence, its value in the tables has been left blank (hyphen), indicating that its rating remains to be assessed through another means. Future work is planned to develop much of this additional information.\n\nThese tables are provided only for the convenience of By-law users and do not limit the number of assemblies permitted to those in the tables. Assemblies not listed or not given a rating in these tables are equally acceptable provided their fire and sound resistance can be demonstrated to meet the above-noted requirements either on the basis of tests referred to in Article 9.10.3.1. and Subsection 9.11.1. or by using the data in Appendix D, Fire-Performance Ratings. It should be noted, however, that Tables A-9.10.3.1.A. and A-9.10.3.1.B. are not based on the same assumptions as those used in Appendix D. Assemblies in Tables A-9.10.3.1.A. and A-9.10.3.1.B. are described through their generic descriptions and variants and include details given in the notes to the tables. Assumptions for Appendix D include different construction details that must be followed rigorously for the calculated ratings to be expected. These are two different methods of choosing assemblies that meet required fire ratings.\n\nFigure A-9.10.3.1. -A\n\nSingle layer butt joint details\n\nNotes to Figure A-9.10.3.1. -A\n\nFigure A-9.10.3.1. -B\n\nDouble layer butt joint details\n\nNotes to Figure A-9.10.3.1. -B\n\nA-9.10.4.1.(4) Mezzanines Not Considered as Storeys. Mezzanines increase the occupant load and the fire load of the storey of which they are part. To take the added occupant load into account for the purpose of evaluating other requirements that are dependent on this criteria, their floor area is added to the floor area of the storey.\n\nA-9.10.9.6.(1) Penetration of Fire-Rated Assemblies by Service Equipment. This Sentence, together with Article 3.1.9.1., is intended to ensure that the integrity of fire-rated assemblies is maintained where they are penetrated by various types of service equipment.\n\nFor buildings regulated by the requirements in Part 3., fire stop materials used to seal openings around building services, such as pipes, ducts and electrical outlet boxes, must meet a minimum level of performance demonstrated by standard test criteria.\n\nThis is different from the approach in Part 9. Because of the type of construction normally used for buildings regulated by the requirements in Part 9, it is assumed that this requirement is satisfied by the use of generic fire stop materials such as mineral wool, gypsum plaster or Portland cement mortar.\n\nA-9.10.9.16.(4) Separation between Dwelling Units and Storage or Repair Garages. The gas-tight barrier between a dwelling unit and an attached garage is intended to provide protection against the entry of carbon monoxide and gasoline fumes into the dwelling unit. Building assemblies incorporating an air barrier system will perform adequately with respect to gas tightness, provided all joints in the airtight material are sealed and reasonable care is exercised where the wall or ceiling is pierced by building services. Where a garage is open to the adjacent attic space above the dwelling unit it serves, a gas-tight barrier in the ceiling of the dwelling unit will also provide protection. Unit masonry walls forming the separation between a dwelling unit and an adjacent garage should be provided with two coats of sealer or plaster, or covered with gypsum wallboard on the side of the wall exposed to the garage. All joints must be sealed to ensure continuity of the barrier. (See also Sentences 9.25.3.3.(3) to (8).)\n\nA-9.10.12.4.(1) Protection of Overhang of Common Roof Space.\n\nFigure A-9.10.12.4.(1)\n\nProtection of overhang of common roof space\n\nA-9.10.12.4.(3) Protection at Soffits. The materials required by this Sentence to be used as protection for soffit spaces in certain locations do not necessarily have to be the finish materials. They can be installed either behind the finishes chosen for the soffits or in lieu of these.\n\nA-9.10.13.2.(1) Wood Doors in Fire Separations. CAN4-S113 provides construction details to enable manufacturers to build wood core doors that will provide a 20 min fire-protection rating without the need for testing. The standard requires each door to be marked with\n\n(1) the manufacturer's or vendor's name or identifying symbol,\n\n(2) the words “Fire Door,” and\n\n(3) a reference to the fire-protection rating of 20 min.\n\nA-9.10.15.1.(1) Application of Subsection 9.10.15. Subsection 9.10.15. applies to the spatial separation between buildings of residential occupancy where there is no dwelling unit above another dwelling unit. Such buildings include detached houses, semi-detached houses (doubles) and row houses, where there is no dwelling unit above another dwelling unit.\n\nA-9.10.15.4.(2) Staggered or Skewed Exposing Building Faces of Houses. Studies at the National Fire Laboratory of the National Research Council have shown that, where an exposing building face is stepped back from the property line or is at an angle to the property line, it is possible to increase the percentage of glazing in those portions of the exposing building face further from the property line without increasing the amount of radiated energy that would reach the property line in the event of a fire in such a building. Figures A-9.10.15.4.(2)-A, A-9.10.15.4.(2)-B and A-9.10.15.4.(2)-C show how Sentences 9.10.15.4.(1) and (2), and 9.10.15.5.(1) and (3) can be applied to exposing building faces that are stepped back from or not parallel to the property line. The following procedure can be used to establish the maximum permitted area of glazed openings for such facades:\n\nCalculate the total area of the exposing building face, i.e. facade of the fire compartment, as described in the definition of exposing building face.\n\nIdentify the portions into which the exposing building face is to be divided. It can be divided in any number of portions, not necessarily of equal size.\n\nMeasure the limiting distance for each portion. The limiting distance is measured along a line perpendicular to the wall surface from the point closest to the property line.\n\nEstablish the line in Table 9.10.15.4. from which the maximum permitted percentage area of glazed openings will be read. The selection of the line depends on the maximum area of exposing building face for the whole fire compartment, including all portions, as determined in Step 1.\n\nOn that line, read the maximum percentage area of glazed openings permitted in each portion of the exposing building face according to the limiting distance for that portion.\n\nCalculate the maximum area of glazed openings permitted in each portion. The area is calculated from the percentage found applied to the area of that portion.\n\nTable 9.10.15.4. is used to read the maximum area of glazed openings: this means that the opaque portion of doors does not have to be counted as for other types of buildings.\n\nFigure A-9.10.15.4.(2) -A\n\nExample of determination of criteria for the exposing building face of a staggered wall of a house\n\nFigure A-9.10.15.4.(2) -B\n\nExample of determination of criteria for the exposing building face of a skewed wall of a house with some arbitrary division of the wall\n\nNote to Figure A-9.10.15.4.(2) -B\n\nFigure A-9.10.15.4.(2) -C\n\nExample of determination of criteria for the exposing building face of a skewed wall of a house with a different arbitrary division of the wall\n\nNote to Figure A-9.10.15.4.(2) -C\n\nA-9.10.18.6.(1) Fire Alarm, Fire Detection and Smoke Detection Devices and Systems. A number of provisions captured by the cross-reference to Subsection 3.2.4. address issues already addressed in Subsection 9.10.18. and so are not applicable to Part 9 buildings. For example, Articles 9.10.18.2. and 9.10.18.8. identify the Part 9 buildings where fire alarm systems are required, so Article 3.2.4.1. does not apply.\n\nNote that, because the cross-reference relating to sprinkler systems in Sentence 9.10.1.2.(8) refers only to Subsection 3.2.5., the requirements of Subsection 3.2.4. regarding electrical supervision and monitoring do not normally apply to sprinkler systems in Part 9 buildings. However, where a sprinkler system is installed in lieu of heat and smoke detectors according to Sentence 9.10.18.3.(3), electrical supervision and monitoring of the sprinkler system must comply with the provisions in Subsection 3.2.4.\n\nA-9.10.19.2.(1) Location of Smoke Alarms. There are two important points to bear in mind when considering where to locate smoke alarms in dwelling units:\n\nThe most frequent point of origin for fires in dwelling units is the living area.\n\nThe main concern in locating smoke alarms is to provide warning to people asleep in bedrooms.\n\nThus a smoke alarm located in the living area and wired so as to sound another smoke alarm located near the bedrooms is the ideal solution. However, it is difficult to define exactly what is meant by “living area.” It is felt to be too stringent to require a smoke alarm in every part of a dwelling unit that could conceivably be considered a “living area” (living room, family room, study, etc.). Sentence 9.10.19.2.(1) therefore addresses these issues by requiring at least one smoke alarm on every storey and setting a maximum distance that any point on a floor level can be from a smoke alarm. Thus, in a dwelling unit complying with Sentence 9.10.19.2.(1), every living area will probably be located within a reasonable distance of a smoke alarm. Nevertheless, where a choice arises as to where on a storey to locate the required smoke alarm or alarms, one should be located as close as possible to a living area, provided the requirement for proximity to bedrooms is also satisfied.\n\nRegarding location of smoke alarms in bedroom areas, generally the most economical choice will be to locate one alarm in a hallway serving several bedrooms. However, in a small dwelling where the bedrooms may be close to cooking areas, placing one alarm inside each bedroom may be a better choice as it makes them less prone to false alarms.\n\nA-9.10.20.3.(1) Fire Department Access Route Modification. Deleted.\n\nA-9.10.22. Clearances from Gas, Propane and Electric Ranges. CSA C22.1, “Canadian Electrical Code, Part 1,” referenced in Article 9.34.1.1., and CAN/CSA-B149.1, “Natural Gas and Propane Installation Code,” referenced in Article 9.10.22.1., address clearances directly above, in front of, behind and beside the appliance. Where side clearances are zero, the standards do not address clearances to building elements located both above the level of the range elements or burners and to the side of the appliance. Through reference to the Canadian Electrical Code and the Natural Gas and Propane Installation Code and the requirements in Articles 9.10.22.2. and 9.10.22.3., the VBBL addresses all clearances. Where clearances are addressed by the VBBL and the Canadian Electrical Code or Natural Gas and Propane Installation Code, conformance with all relevant criteria is achieved by compliance with the most stringent criteria.\n\nFigure A-9.10.22.\n\nClearances from ranges to walls and cabinetry\n\nA-9.11.1.1.(1) Sound Transmission Class Ratings. The specified STC rating of 50 is considered the minimum acceptable value, but many builders prefer to design for STC 55 or more in high quality accommodation.\n\nAnother reason to choose assemblies rated higher than STC 50 is that the STC ratings of assemblies are based on laboratory tests, but the sound transmission of any assembly as constructed in the field may be significantly less than its rating. This can be due to sound leaks, departures from design, poor workmanship or indirect (flanking) transmission paths overlooked in design. To provide a margin of safety to compensate for these, builders often select wall and floor systems that have been rated at least 5 points higher than the design STC rating in laboratory tests.\n\nSound leaks can occur where one wall meets another, the floor, or the ceiling. Leaks may also occur where the wall finish is cut for the installation of equipment or services. Avoid back-to-back electrical outlets or medicine cabinets. Carefully seal cracks or openings so structures are effectively airtight. Apply sealant below the plates in stud walls, between the bottom of drywall sheets and the structure behind, around all penetrations for services and, in general, wherever there is a crack, a hole or the possibility of one developing. Sound-absorbing material inside a well-designed wall decreases sound transmission. It has another advantage; it also helps to reduce the effects of leaks due, perhaps, to poor workmanship.\n\nIndirect or flanking transmission arises where the parts of a building are rigidly connected together and where cavities in hollow walls or floors, or continuous lightweight layers connect apartments. Sound travels in cavities, as vibration along surfaces and through walls, ceilings and floors to adjacent rooms. Many paths other than the direct one through the party wall or floor may be involved. To achieve good sound insulation, transmission along flanking paths must be minimized by introducing breaks and resilient connections in the construction. Some examples of bad and good details are shown in A-9.11.1.1.(1)\n\nChanges to constructions should not be made without consultation with someone competent in the field of acoustical design. Adding extra layers of drywall to walls in an attempt to reduce sound transmission, can actually increase it if done incorrectly. For example, attaching drywall on resilient channels directly to an existing wall or ceiling usually increases low frequency sound transmission. Adding an additional layer of drywall inside a double layer wall will also seriously increase sound transmission. Adding blocking inside walls to reduce the risk of fire spread should be done so it does not increase vibration transmission from one part of a wall or floor to the other.\n\nFigure A-9.11.1.1.(1)\n\nCross-section through wall/floor junctions\n\nTo verify that acoustical privacy is being achieved, a field test can be done at an early stage in the construction; ASTM E 336 will give a complete measurement. A simpler and less expensive method is ASTM E 597, “Determining a Single Number Rating of Airborne Sound Insulation for Use in Multi-Unit Building Specifications.” The rating provided by this test is usually within 2 points of the STC obtained from ASTM E 336. It is useful for verifying performance and finding problems during construction. Alterations can then be made prior to project completion.\n\nImpact Noise\n\nSection 9.11. has no requirements for control of impact noise transmission. Footstep and other impacts can cause severe annoyance in multi-family residences. Builders concerned about quality and reducing occupant complaints will ensure that floors are designed to minimize impact transmission. A recommended criterion is that bare floors (tested without a carpet) should achieve an impact insulation class (IIC) of 55. Some lightweight floors that satisfy this requirement may still cause complaints about low frequency impact noise transmission. Adding carpet to a floor will always increase the IIC rating but will not necessarily reduce low frequency noise transmission. Good footstep noise rejection requires fairly heavy floor slabs or floating floors. Impact noise requirements are being considered for inclusion in future versions of the BCBC.\n\nMost frequently used methods of test for impact noise are ASTM E 492, “Laboratory Measurement of Impact Sound Transmission Through Floor-Ceiling Assemblies Using The Tapping Machine,” or ASTM E 1007, “Field Measurement of Tapping Machine Impact Sound Transmission Through Floor-Ceiling Assemblies and Associated Support Structures.”\n\nMachinery Noise\n\nElevators, garbage chutes, plumbing, fans, and heat pumps are common sources of noise in buildings. To reduce annoyance from these, they should be placed as far as possible from sensitive areas. Vibrating parts should be isolated from the building structure using resilient materials such as neoprene or rubber.\n\nA-Table 9.12.2.2. Minimum Depths of Foundations. The requirements for clay soils or soils not clearly defined are intended to apply to those soils that are subject to significant volume changes with changes in moisture content.\n\nA-9.12.2.2.(2) Depth and Insulation of Foundations.\n\nFigure A-9.12.2.2.(2)\n\nFoundation insulation and heat flow to footings\n\nA-9.12.3.3.(1) Deleterious Material in Backfill. The deleterious debris referred to in this provision includes, but is not limited to:\n\norganic material and other material subject to decomposition and compaction, which could have an adverse effect on grading around the building,\n\nmaterials that will off-gas and have the potential to pose a health hazard, and\n\nmaterials that are incompatible with materials used in the foundations, footings, drainage materials or components, or other elements of the building whose required performance would be adversely affected.\n\nA-9.13.4. Exclusion of Soil Gas. Outdoor air entering a dwelling through above-grade leaks in the building envelope normally improves the indoor air quality in the dwelling by reducing the concentrations of pollutants and water vapour. It is only undesirable because it cannot be controlled. On the other hand, air entering a dwelling through below-grade leaks in the envelope may increase the water vapour content of the indoor air and may also bring in a number of pollutants which it picks up from the soil. This mixture of air, water vapour and pollutants is sometimes referred to as “soil gas.” One pollutant often found in soil gas is radon.\n\nRadon is a colourless, odourless, radioactive gas that occurs naturally as a result of the decay of radium. It is found to varying degrees as a component of soil gas in all regions of Canada and is known to enter dwelling units by infiltration into basements and crawl spaces. The presence of radon in sufficient quantity can lead to increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nThe potential for high levels of radon infiltration is very difficult to evaluate prior to construction and thus a radon problem may only become apparent once the building is completed and occupied. Therefore various sections of Part 9 require the application of certain radon exclusion measures in all dwellings. These measures are\n\nlow in cost,\n\ndifficult to retrofit, and\n\ndesirable for other benefits they provide.\n\nThere are two principal methods of excluding soil gas:\n\nSealing the interface between the soil and the occupied space, so far as is reasonably practicable. Sections 9.13. and 9.18. include requirements for soil gas barriers in crawl spaces. Providing control joints to reduce cracking of foundation walls and airtight covers for sump pits are other measures which can help achieve this objective. The requirements provided in Articles 9.13.4.3., 9.13.4.5., and 9.13.4.7. are described in Appendix Notes A-9.13.4.3., 9.13.4.5. and 9.13.4.7., and A-9.13.4.5.(1) and (2).\n\nEnsuring that the pressure difference across the soil/space interface is positive (i.e., towards the outside) so that inward soil gas flow through any remaining leaks will be prevented. The requirements provided in Article 9.13.4.6. are described in Appendix Note A-9.13.4.6.\n\nA-9.13.4.1.(4) Subfloor Depressurization in Houses with Preserved Wood Foundations. Standard CAN/CSA-S406, “Construction of Preserved Wood Foundations,” requires that a polyethylene sheet ground cover be installed under all floors-on-ground in buildings with preserved wood foundations. The use of a subfloor depressurization system may be acceptable with such constructions, seeing as the standard doesn't mention otherwise, but the polyethylene sheet ground cover is an unconditional requirement of that standard. The polyethylene sheet cannot be forfeited in houses intended to conform to the standard and the depressurization system would have to be installed under the ground cover membrane.\n\nA-9.13.4.3., 9.13.4.5. and 9.13.4.7. Soil Gas Barriers. The requirements provided in Article 9.13.4.3., Soil Gas Control in Walls, Article 9.13.4.5., Soil Gas Barriers, and Article 9.13.4.7., Sealing of the Perimeter and Penetrations, are illustrated in Figures A-9.13.4.3., 9.13.4.5. and 9.13.4.7.-A and A-9.13.4.3., 9.13.4.5. and 9.13.4.7.-B.\n\nThe requirement in Sentence 9.13.4.7.(2) regarding sealing of penetrations of the slab also applies to hollow metal and masonry columns. Not only the perimeters but also the centres of such columns must be sealed or blocked.\n\nFigure A-9.13.4.3., 9.13.4.5. and 9.13.4.7. -A\n\nDampproofing and soil gas control at foundation wall/floor junctions with solid walls\n\nThe requirement in Sentence 9.13.4.7.(3) regarding drainage openings in slabs can be satisfied with any of a number of proprietary devices that prevent soil gas entry through floor drains. Some types of floor drains incorporate a trap that is connected to a nearby tap so that the trap is filled every time the tap is used. This is intended to prevent the entry of sewer gas but would be equally effective against the entry of soil gas.\n\nFigure A-9.13.4.3., 9.13.4.5. and 9.13.4.7. -B\n\nDampproofing and soil gas control at foundation wall/floor junctions with hollow walls\n\nA-9.13.4.5.(1) and (2) Polyethylene Soil Gas Barriers under Slabs-on-Ground. Floors-on-ground serving all types of occupancies other than garages must be constructed to reduce the potential for entry of radon or other soil gases. In most cases, this will be accomplished by placing 0.15 mm polyethylene under the floor.\n\nFinishing a concrete slab placed directly on polyethylene can, in many cases, cause problems for the inexperienced finisher. A rule of finishing, whether concrete is placed on polyethylene or not, is to never finish or “work” the surface of the slab while bleed water is present or before all the bleed water has risen to the surface and evaporated. If finishing operations are performed too early, such as before all the bleed water has risen and evaporated, surface defects such as blisters, crazing, scaling and dusting can result. This is often the case with slabs placed directly on polyethylene. The amount of bleed water that may come to the surface and the time required for this to happen is increased from that of a slab placed on a compacted granular base. The excess water in the mix from the bottom portion of the slab cannot bleed downward and out of the slab and be absorbed into the granular material below, because of the polyethylene. Therefore, all bleed water, including that from the bottom of the slab, must now rise through the slab to the surface. Quite often in such cases, finishing operations are begun too soon and surface defects result.\n\nOne solution that is often suggested is to place a layer of sand between the polyethylene and the concrete. However, this is not an acceptable solution for the following reason: it is unlikely that the polyethylene will survive the slab pouring process entirely intact. Nevertheless, the polyethylene will still be effective in retarding the flow of soil gas if it is in intimate contact with the concrete; soil gas will only be able to penetrate where a break in the polyethylene coincides with a crack in the concrete. The majority of concrete cracks will probably be underlain by intact polyethylene. On the other hand, if there is an intervening layer of a porous medium, such as sand, soil gas will be able to travel laterally from a break in the polyethylene to the nearest crack in the concrete and the total system will be much less resistant to soil gas penetration.\n\nTo reduce and/or control the cracking of concrete slabs, it is necessary to understand the nature and causes of volume changes of concrete and in particular those relating to drying shrinkage. The total amount of water in a mix is by far the largest contributor to the amount of drying shrinkage and resulting potential cracking that may be expected from a given concrete. The less total amount of water in the mix, the less volume change (due to evaporation of water), which means the less drying shrinkage that will occur. To lessen the volume change and potential cracking due to drying shrinkage, a mix with the lowest total amount of water that is practicable should always be used. To lower the water content of a mix, superplasticizers are often used to provide the needed workability of the concrete during the placing operation. High water/cementing materials ratio concretes usually have high water content mixes. They should be avoided to minimize drying shrinkage and cracking of the slab. The water/cementing materials ratio for slabs-on-ground should be no higher than 0.55.\n\nA-9.13.4.6. Soil Gas Control by Depressurization. As noted in Appendix Note A-9.13.4., one method of excluding soil gas from below-grade living space is to ensure that the pressure difference across the soil/space interface is positive (i.e., towards the outside) so that inward soil gas flow through any leaks will be prevented. This requires consideration of the air pressure on the inside of the envelope and the pressure within the soil. Each is affected by quite different factors.\n\nThere is a safe range for the interior pressure in a house. The upper limit is primarily due to the need to minimize outward leakage of the warm, moist interior air through leaks in the building envelope. The lower limit depends on the type of combustion heating equipment present in the house, as discussed in Appendix Note A-9.33.1.1.(2). It also follows from the need to avoid drawing in soil gas, as discussed in Appendix Note A-9.13.4.\n\nControlling the entry of soil gas by house or basement pressurization is therefore problematic, since it could lead to exfiltration-caused condensation problems in the building envelope. This leaves the option of reducing the pressure outside the envelope as the most practical method of achieving the desired outward pressure difference.\n\nSubfloor depressurization systems have been found to be very effective for controlling soil gas entry into houses. At least in areas which are prone to higher than normal radon levels, or other ground pollutants, this practice is recommended.\n\nArticle 9.13.4.6.provides for depressurization as an alternative to the installation of polyethylene below floor slabs. Using this option, a vent pipe for use with a subfloor depressurization system is installed through the floor but is only connected if soil gas levels are found to be excessive.\n\nRadon testing must be performed on the house and Chief Building Official. Since the radon level in a house can vary significantly during the year, the test should be of sufficient duration to provide a reasonable indication of the concentration. The minimum period for testing should be three months or as recommended by the Chief Building Official. The preferred testing location is centrally in the basement or the main floor for houses without basements.\n\nThe current Canadian Action Level for radon, as specified by Health Canada, is 800 Bq/m3 (see H46-2/90-156E, “Exposure Guidelines for Residential Indoor Air Quality”). If the results of the test indicate a concentration exceeding the Canadian Action Level, the rest of the sub-slab depressurization system must be installed. (It may be noted that Canadian and U.S. action levels are likely to differ.)\n\nInstallation of the sub-slab depressurization system requires that the pipe cast through the slab to the sub-slab space be uncapped and connected to a ventilation system exhausting to the outside. Exhaust pipes passing through unheated spaces should be insulated. The exhaust fan should be located outside the occupied space where noise will not be a nuisance. It is also best to locate the fan as close to the final outlet end of the ventilation system as possible so that the pressurized portion of the system downstream of the fan will not be located in or adjacent to the living space. If the pressurized portion of the system were to pass through the living space, then any leak in the system would have the potential to spill high concentration soil gas into the living space, thus exacerbating the situation the system was intended to correct. The fan should be of a type suitable for the application and capable of continuous operation.\n\nSince radon concentration of the vent gases can become quite high, soil gases collected by the sub-slab depressurization system should be vented at the roof level. Therefore, it may be desirable to take some simple steps to facilitate future installation of the system. This could include locating the slab vent pipe below a suitable interior partition, through which the vertical riser could be run, and pre-drilling the partition top and bottom plates, particularly those not accessible from a basement or attic.\n\nThe house should be re-tested for radon after completion of the depressurization system.\n\nA-9.14.2.1.(2)(a) Insulation Applied to the Exterior of Foundation Walls. In addition to the prevention of heat loss, some types of mineral fibre insulation, such as rigid glass fibre, are installed on the exterior of basement walls for the purpose of moisture control. This is sometimes used instead of crushed rock as a drainage layer between the basement wall and the surrounding soil in order to facilitate the drainage of soil moisture. Water drained by this drainage layer must be carried away from the foundation by the footing drains or the granular drainage layer in order to prevent it from developing hydro-static pressure against the wall. Provision must be made to permit the drainage of this water either by extending the insulation or crushed rock to the drain or by the installation of granular material connecting the two. The installation of such drainage layer does not eliminate the need for normal waterproofing or dampproofing of walls as specified in Section 9.13.\n\nA-9.15.1.1. Application of Footing and Foundation Requirements to Decks and Similar Constructions. Because decks, balconies, verandas and similar platforms support occupancies, they are, by definition, considered as buildings or parts of buildings. Consequently, the requirements in Section 9.15. regarding footings and foundations apply to these constructions.\n\nA-9.15.1.1.(1)(c) and 9.20.1.1.(1)(b) Flat Insulating Concrete Form Walls. Insulating concrete form (ICF) walls are concrete walls that are cast into polystyrene forms, which remain in place after the concrete has cured. Flat ICF walls are solid ICF walls where the concrete is of uniform thickness over the height and width of the wall.\n\nA-9.15.2.4.(1) Preserved Wood Foundations – Design Assumptions. Tabular data and figures in CAN/CSA-S406, “Construction of Preserved Wood Foundations,” are based upon the general principles provided in CAN/CSA-O86, “Engineering Design in Wood,” with the following assumptions:\n\nsoil bearing capacity: 75 kPa or more,\n\nclear spans for floors: 5 000 mm or less,\n\nfloor loadings: 1.9 kPa for first floor and suspended floor, and 1.4 kPa for second storey floor,\n\nfoundation wall heights: 2 400 mm for slab floor, 3 000 mm for suspended wood floor,\n\ntop of granular layer to top of suspended wood floor: 600 mm,\n\nlateral load from soil pressure: equivalent to fluid pressure of 4.7 kPa per metre of depth,\n\nground snow load: 3 kPa,\n\nbasic snow load coefficient: 0.6,\n\nroof loads are carried to the exterior wall,\n\ndead loads:\n\nA-9.15.3.4.(2) Footing Sizes. The footing sizes in Table 9.15.3.4. are based on typical construction consisting of a roof, not more than 3 storeys, and centre bearing walls or beams. For this reason, Clause 9.15.3.3.(1)(b) stipulates a maximum supported joist span of 4.9 m.\n\nIt has become common to use flat wood trusses or wood I-joists to span greater distances in floors of small buildings. Where these spans exceed 4.9 m, minimum footing sizes may be based on the following method:\n\n(a) Determine for each storey the span of joists that will be supported on a given footing. Sum these lengths (sum1).\n\n(b) Determine the product of the number of storeys times 4.9 m (sum2).\n\n(c) Determine the ratio of sum1 to sum2.\n\n(d) Multiply this ratio by the minimum footing sizes in Table 9.15.3.4. to get the required minimum footing size.\n\nExample: A 2-storey house is built using wood I-joists spanning 6 m.\n\n(a) sum1 = 6 + 6 = 12 m\n\n(b) sum2 = 4.9 x 2 = 9.8 m\n\n(c) ratio sum1/sum2 = 12/9.8 = 1.22\n\n(d) required minimum footing size = 1.22 x 350 mm (minimum footing size provided in Table 9.15.3.4.) = 427 mm.\n\nA-9.17.2.2.(2) Lateral Support of Columns. Because the NBC does not provide prescriptive criteria to describe the minimum required lateral support, constructions are limited to those that have demonstrated effective performance over time and those that are designed according to Part 4. Verandas on early 20th century homes provide one example of constructions whose floor and roof are typically tied to the rest of the building to provide effective lateral support. Large decks set on tall columns, however, are likely to require additional lateral support even where they are connected to the building on one side.\n\nA-9.17.3.4. Design of Steel Columns. The permitted live floor loads of 2.4 kPa and the spans described for steel beams, wood beams and floor joists are such that the load on columns could exceed 36 kN, the maximum allowable load on columns prescribed in CAN/CGSB-7.2, “Adjustable Steel Columns.” In the context of Part 9, loads on columns are calculated from the supported area times the live load per unit area, using the supported length of joists and beams. The supported length is half of the joist spans on each side of the beam and half the beam span on each side of the column.\n\nDead load is not included based on the assumption that the maximum live load will not be applied over the whole floor. Designs according to Part 4 must consider all applied loads.\n\nA-9.18.7.1.(4) Protection of Ground Cover in Warm Air Plenums. The purpose of the requirement is to protect combustible ground cover from smoldering cigarette butts that may drop through air registers. The protective material should extend beyond the opening of the register and have up-turned edges, as a butt may be deflected sideways as it falls.\n\nA-9.19.1.1.(1) Venting of Attic or Roof Spaces. Controlling the flow of moisture by air leakage and vapour diffusion into attic or roof spaces is necessary to limit moisture-induced deterioration. Given that imperfections normally exist in the vapour barriers and air barrier systems, recent research indicates that venting of attic or roof spaces is generally still required. The exception provided in Article 9.19.1.1. recognizes that some specialized ceiling-roof assemblies, such as those used in some factory-built buildings, have, over time, demonstrated that their construction is sufficiently tight to prevent excessive moisture accumulation. In these cases, ventilation would not be required.\n\nA-9.20.1.2. Seismic Information. Information on spectral response acceleration values for various locations can be found in Appendix C, Climatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada.\n\nA-9.20.5.1.(1) Masonry Support. Masonry veneer must be supported on a stable structure in order to avoid cracking of the masonry due to differential movement relative to parts of the support. Wood framing is not normally used as a support for the weight of masonry veneer because of its shrinkage characteristics. Where the weight of masonry veneer is supported on a wood structure, as is the case for the preserved wood foundations referred to in Sentence 9.20.5.1.(1) for example, measures must be taken to ensure that any differential movement that may be harmful to the performance of masonry is minimized or accommodated. The general principle stated in Article 9.4.1.1., however, makes it possible to support the weight of masonry veneer on wood framing, provided that engineering design principles prescribed in Part 4 are followed to ensure that the rigidity of the support is compatible with the stiffness of the masonry being supported and that differential movements between the support and masonry are accommodated.\n\nA-9.20.8.5. Distance from Edge of Masonry to Edge of Supporting Members.\n\nFigure A-9.20.8.5.\n\nMaximum projection of masonry beyond its support\n\nA-9.20.12.2.(2) Corbelling of Masonry Foundation Walls.\n\nFigure A-9.20.12.2.(2)\n\nMaximum corbel dimensions\n\nA-9.20.13.9.(3) Dampproofing of Masonry Walls. The reason for installing sheathing paper behind masonry walls is to prevent rainwater from reaching the interior finish if it should leak past the masonry. The sheathing paper intercepts the rainwater and leads it to the bottom of the wall where the flashing directs it to the exterior via weep holes. If the insulation is a type that effectively resists the penetration of water, and is installed so that water will not collect behind it, then there is no need for sheathing paper. If water that runs down between the masonry and the insulation is able to leak out at the joints in the insulation, such insulation will not act as a substitute for sheathing paper. If water cannot leak through the joints in the insulation but collects in cavities between the masonry and insulation, subsequent freezing could damage the wall. Where sheathing paper is not used, therefore, the adhesive or mortar should be applied to form a continuous bond between the masonry and the insulation. If this is not practicable because of an irregular masonry surface, then sheathing paper is necessary.\n\nA-9.21.3.6.(2) Metal Chimney Liners. Under the provisions of Article 1.2.1.1. of Division A, masonry chimneys with metal liners may be permitted to serve solid-fuel-burning appliances if tests show that such liners will provide an equivalent level of safety.\n\nA-9.21.4.4.(1) Location of Chimney Top.\n\nFigure A-9.21.4.4.(1)\n\nVertical and horizontal distances from chimney top to roof\n\nA-9.21.4.5.(2) Lateral Support for Chimneys. Where a chimney is fastened to the house framing with metal anchors, in accordance with CSA A370, “Connectors for Masonry,” it is considered to have adequate lateral support. The portion of the chimney stack above the roof is considered as free standing and may require additional lateral support.\n\nA-9.21.5.1.(1) Clearance from Combustible Materials. For purposes of this Sentence, an exterior chimney can be considered to be one which has at least one surface exposed to the outside atmosphere or unheated space over the majority of its height. All other chimneys should be considered to be interior.\n\nA-9.23.1.1. Constructions Other than Light Wood-Frame Constructions. The prescriptive requirements in Section 9.23. apply only to standard light wood-frame construction. Other constructions, such as post, beam and plank construction, plank frame wall construction, and log construction must be designed in accordance with Part 4.\n\nA-9.23.1.1.(1) Application of Section 9.23. In previous editions of the Code, Sentence 9.23.1.1.(1) referred to “conventional” wood-frame construction. Over time, conventions have changed and the application of Part 9 has expanded.\n\nThe prescriptive requirements provided in Section 9.23. still focus on lumber beams, joists, studs and rafters as the main structural elements of “wood-frame construction.” The requirements recognize—and have recognized for some time—that walls and floors may be supported by components made of material other than lumber; for example, by foundations described in Section 9.15. or by steel beams described in Article 9.23.4.3. These constructions still fall within the general category of wood-frame construction.\n\nWith more recent innovations, alternative structural components are being incorporated into wood-frame buildings. Wood I-joists, for example, are very common. Where these components are used in lieu of lumber, the requirements in Section 9.23. that specifically apply to lumber joists do not apply to these components: for example, limits on spans and acceptable locations for notches and holes. However, requirements regarding the fastening of floor sheathing to floor joists still apply, and the use of wood I-joists does not affect the requirements for wall or roof framing.\n\nSimilarly, if steel floor joists are used in lieu of lumber joists, the requirements regarding wall or roof framing are not affected.\n\nConversely, Sentence 9.23.1.1.(1) precludes the installation of pre-cast concrete floors on wood-frame walls since these are not “generally comprised of ... small repetitive structural members ... spaced not more than 600 mm o.c.”\n\nThus, the reference to “engineered components” in Sentence 9.23.1.1.(1) is intended to indicate that, where an engineered product is used in lieu of lumber for one part of the building, this does not preclude the application of the remainder of Section 9.23. to the structure, provided the limits to application with respect to cladding, sheathing or bracing, spacing of framing members, supported loads and maximum spans are respected.\n\nA-9.23.3.1.(2) Standard for Screws. The requirement that wood screws conform to ANSI/ASME B18.6.1, “Wood Screws (Inch Series),” is not intended to preclude the use of Robertson head screws. The requirement is intended to specify the mechanical properties of the fastener, not to restrict the means of driving the fastener.\n\nA-9.23.3.3.(1) Prevention of Splitting. Figure A-9.23.3.3.(1) illustrates the intent of the phrase “staggering the nails in the direction of the grain.”\n\nFigure A-9.23.3.3.(1)\n\nStaggered nailing\n\nA-9.23.4.2. Span Tables for Wood Joists, Rafters and Beams. In these span tables the term “rafter” refers to a sloping wood framing member which supports the roof sheathing and encloses an attic space but does not support a ceiling. The term “roof joist” refers to a horizontal or sloping wood framing member that supports the roof sheathing and the ceiling finish but does not enclose an attic space.\n\nWhere rafters or roof joists are intended for use in a locality having a higher specified roof snow load than shown in the tables, the maximum member spacing may be calculated as the product of the member spacing and specified snow load shown in the span tables divided by the specified snow load for the locality being considered. The following examples show how this principle can be applied:\n\n(a) For a 3.5 kPa specified snow load, use spans for 2.5 kPa and 600 mm o.c. spacing but space members 400 mm o.c.\n\n(b) For a 4.0 kPa specified snow load, use spans for 2.0 kPa and 600 mm o.c. spacing but space members 300 mm o.c.\n\nThe maximum spans in the span tables are measured from the inside face or edge of support to the inside face or edge of support.\n\nIn the case of sloping roof framing members, the spans are expressed in terms of the horizontal distance between supports rather than the length of the sloping member. The snow loads are also expressed in terms of the horizontal projection of the sloping roof. Spans for odd size lumber may be estimated by straight line interpolation in the tables.\n\nThese span tables may be used where members support a uniform live load only. Where the members are required to be designed to support a concentrated load, they must be designed in conformance with Subsection 4.3.1.\n\nSupported joist length in Tables A-8, A-9 and A-10 means half the sum of the joist spans on both sides of the beam. For supported joist lengths between those shown in the tables, straight line interpolation may be used in determining the maximum beam span.\n\nTables A-1 to A-16 cover only the most common configurations. Especially in the area of floors, a wide variety of other configurations is possible: glued subfloors, concrete toppings, machine stress rated lumber, etc. The Canadian Wood Council publishes “The Span Book,” a compilation of span tables covering many of these alternative configurations. Although these tables have not been subject to the formal committee review process, the Canadian Wood Council generates, for the CCBFC, all of the Bylaw's span tables for wood structural components; thus By-law users can be confident that the alternative span tables in “The Span Book” are consistent with the span tables in the By-law and with relevant By-law requirements.\n\nSpans for wood joists, rafters and beams which fall outside the scope of these tables, including those for U.S. species and individual species not marketed in the commercial species combinations described in the span tables, can be calculated in conformance with CAN/CSA-O86, “Engineering Design in Wood.”\n\nA-9.23.4.2.(2) Numerical Method to Establish Vibration-Controlled Spans for Wood-Frame Floors. In addition to the normal strength and deflection analyses, the calculations on which the floor joist span tables are based include a method of ensuring that the spans are not so long that floor vibrations could lead to occupants perceiving the floors as too “bouncy” or “springy.” Limiting deflection under the normal uniformly distributed loads to 1/360 of the span does not provide this assurance.\n\nNormally, vibration analysis requires detailed dynamic modelling. However, the calculations for the span tables use the following simplified static analysis method of estimating vibration-acceptable spans:\n\nThe span which will result in a 2 mm deflection of a single joist supporting a 1 kN concentrated midpoint load is calculated.\n\nThis span is multiplied by a factor, K, to determine the “vibration-controlled” span for the entire floor system. If this span is less than the strength- or deflection-controlled span under uniformly distributed load, the vibration-controlled span becomes the maximum span.\n\nThe K factor is determined from the following relationship:\n\nFigure A-9.23.4.2.(2)\n\nwhere\n\nA, B = constants, the values of which are determined from Tables Table A-9.23.4.2.(2)A. or B., G = constant, the value of which is determined from Table A-9.23.4.2.(2)C., Si = span which results in a 2 mm deflection of the joist in question under a 1 kN concentrated midpoint load, S184 = span which results in a 2 mm deflection of a 38 x 184 mm joist of same species and grade as the joist in question under a 1 kN concentrated midpoint load.\n\nFor a given joist species and grade, the value of K shall not be greater than K3, the value which results in a vibration-controlled span of exactly 3 m. This means that for vibration-controlled spans 3 m or less, K always equals K3, and for vibration-controlled spans greater than 3 m, K is as calculated.\n\nNote that, for a sawn lumber joist, the ratio Si/S184 is equivalent to its depth (mm) divided by 184.\n\nDue to rounding differences, the method, as presented here, might produce results slightly different from those produced by the computer program used to generate the span tables.\n\nAdditional background information on this method can be found in the following publications:\n\nOnysko, D.M.

A beam may be considered to be laterally supported if wood joists bear on its top flange at intervals of 600 mm or less over its entire length, if all the load being applied to this beam is transmitted through the joists and if 19 mm by 38 mm wood strips in contact with the top flange are nailed on both sides of the beam to the bottom of the joists supported. Other additional methods of positive lateral support are acceptable.\n\nFor supported joist lengths intermediate between those in the table, straight line interpolation may be used in determining the maximum beam span.\n\nA-Table 9.23.4.3. Spans for Steel Beams. The spans are based on the following assumptions:\n\nSimply supported beam spans\n\nLaterally supported top flange\n\nYield strength 350 MPa\n\nDeflection limit L/360\n\nLive load = 1.9 kPa\n\nDead load 1.5 kPa\n\nA-9.23.4.4. Concrete Topping. Vibration-controlled spans given in Table A-2 for concrete topping are based on a partial composite action between the concrete, subflooring and joists. Normal weight concrete having a compressive strength of not less than 20 MPa, placed directly on the subflooring, provides extra stiffness and results in increased capacity. The use of a bond breaker between the topping and the subflooring, or the use of lightweight concrete topping limits the composite effects.\n\nWhere either a bond breaker or lightweight topping is used, Table A-1 may be used but the additional dead load imposed by the concrete must be considered. The addition of 51 mm of concrete topping can impose an added load of 0.8 to 1.2 kPa, depending on the density of the concrete.\n\nThe spacing of joists in the span tables can be conservatively adjusted to allow for the increased load by using the spans in Table A-1 for 600 mm spacing, but spacing the joists 400 mm apart. Similarly, floor beam sp"
