This week's developments have served to show that we have here in the United States problems quite as urgent and quite as complicated as those which are besetting Europe. It is important to bear this in mind, because these latter have been occupying attention to the exclusion of almost everything else in recent weeks. Nor are these domestic problems found alone in the trade depression which has been afflicting the country now for almost two years. The present week the agricultural situation, with the dire distress in which the farming classes find themselves as a result of the low market values ruling for their products, has suddenly been thrust to the front again and the country has been made painfully aware that foreign affairs must not be our concern to the exclusion of these home troubles, • especially as they are now taking a greatly aggravated form. Both wheat and cotton have taken a further plunge downward, and from levels which might have been supposed were on a rock bottom basis, so extremely • depressed have they been. And the occasion for the further decline in both cases has been that nature is proving so bountiful, a circumstance which ordinarily would be occasion for rejoicing. According to present promise both the winter wheat crop, now being harvested, and the growing cotton crop seem likely to prove much larger than had been expected. Except in times like the present, such a prospect would be received with great satisfaction as indicating a sure basis for trade revival since in the last analysis trade and everything else depends to a • preponderating degree upon the outcome of the labors of the farming classes. The cotton estimate of the Bureau of Agriculture . at Washington made its appearance on Saturday financial NO. 3451 last, and almost immediately the price of the staple collapsed, though cotton trading had ceased except in one of the minor cotton markets. The Bureau's estimate of the wheat crop and of the grain crops generally was given publicity on Monday, and it, too, was followed by a further weakening in market prices. To be sure, a downward tendency would be the normal, natural result of a yield larger than expected. In these instances, however, the declines reached the proportions of a severe break, and went far beyond what would ordinarily have been the case. The explanation is found in the circumstance that the operations of the Federal Farm Board have introduced a wholly artificial element in the situation, and because of this ever-present depressing agency, anything of an unfavorable nature is sure to be given an exaggerated importance in any event. The long and short of the matter is that the Farm Board has accumulated immense masses of both wheat and cotton,and these immediately loom up as the controlling factor in the situation, whenever the news or developments of the day takes an unfavorable turn. The Farm Board itself will not see it in that light, but is all the time giving advice and making suggestions of one kind or another which have nothing to recommend them, ignoring the fact that it itself and its doings and operations constitute the chief disturbing factor in the situation. We deal with the details of the grain and cotton estimates further along in this article and will comment here merely upon their bearing upon the general economic situation. As each new downward turn occurs in the market value of these two staple commodities it becomes palpably evident that the unfortunate agricultural situation constitutes a depressing influence separate and apart from the general depression in trade, though it unquestionably accentuates such depression, and this depression in turn makes the lot of the agricultural classes all the harder. The trouble this week has been that the Department of Agriculture estimated the yield of spring and winter wheat combined in this country at 894,000,000 bushels, or 24,000,000'bushcls more than its estimate a month earlier on July 1, which is, after all, not a very prodigious increase, being an addition of only 2.8%. Even as compared with the crop harvested last year, which reached 863,000,000 bushels, the increase is no more than 31,000,000 bushels, or less than 4%. It happens that the winter wheat crop is of unusual size, while the spring wheat crop is exceptionally small, and in this contrast we see how nature often balances things, a deficiency in one quarter being made good in another quarter. The winter wheat crop is put at 775,180,000 bushels, and at that figure it is the largest winter wheat crop 1004 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE [VOL. 133. on record.

Last year's harvest of winter and ruling only a trifle above 50y c. a bushel even wheat was 612,268,000 bushels as compared with after the recovery in price during the last few days. It seems like stating a plain truth to say that exwhich the present year's prospective yield of 775480,000 bushels shows an increase of, roughly, cept for the operations of the Federal Farm Board wheat would to-day be selling somewhere between 163,000,000 bushels. spring wheat crop is esti- $1.25 and $1.50 a bushel, the supplies of the Farm On the other hand, the mated at only 118,402,000 bushels, or the smallest Board having in the meantime found lodgment in the production of spring wheat since the Government ultimate channels of distribution and consumption, began making separate estimates back in 1910.

As compared benefit to the farmer from its operations. About the with this, the present year's crop of only 118,000,000 only comment that seems pertinent to the occasion bushels shows a loss of 133,000,000 bushels, while as is that there are none so blind as those who will compared with the five-year average from 1925 to not see. But cotton furnishes an even more striking 1929, inclusive, which average was 274,000,000 bushels, the loss the present year is 156,000,000 example of the ill effects of the operations of the bushels. Continued and widespread drouth, with Farm Board. The latter has seen fit to make a most extremely high temperatures, is accountable for the extraordinary proposition to the planters the present week. It asks him to plow under every third row falling off. But a circumstance which is entirely overlooked planted to cotton; in other words, to reduce the prosis that the Canadian wheat crop has been reduced in pective yield by one-third. The occasion for this even greater degree and for entirely the same rea- , extraordinary suggestion is that the Agricultural sons, namely, unparalleled and prolonged drouth Bureau at Washington, in its estimate of the size •and extremely high temperatures. In Canada the of the growing crop, puts the prospective yield at spring wheat crop is the important crop, the winter 15,584,000 bales, Which is over 1,500p0 bales in wheat production being relatively small. This latter excess of the highest private estimates. The result last year yielded only 21,022,000 bushels, and the was that the market broke very badly, as already present year is estimated only a little larger, or 23,- stated, future options selling at the lowest figures 341,000 bushels. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics, since 1905 on Monday, and the spot price of middling from which these figures of the winter wheat crop in upland cotton in this market touching 6.75c. on Canada are derived, makes no attempt to estimate Thursday, but with the price yesterday a little higher the probable yield of spring wheat, which, as already at 6.95c. It is this state of things which induced the stated, is the main wheat crop in Canada, but puts Federal Farm Board on Wednesday to make a new the condition extremely low and says the grain crops but different attempt to stabilize cotton prices. of the prairie provinces are the lowest since the James C.

Here, then, there is a loss in the message. The hope was expressed that by these spring wheat yield of the United States and of means 4,000,000 bales of an estimated production of Canada in the prodigious sum of 300,000,000 bushels. 15,584,000 bales might be destroyed.

In return for the co-operation suggested which a sharp rise in prices would be a certainty, the Board pledges itself not to sell the 1,300,000 even though it be offset, as happens in this instance, bales owned by the Cotton Stabilization Corp. beby an increase of 163,000,000 bushels in the winter fore July 31 1932, and to urge cotton co-operatives wheat crop of the United States.

And this action was taken, the daily papers 000,000 bushels of wheat which everyone knows must say, after a day filled with conferences of the Farm sooner or later come upon the market. This operates Board and after the Department of Agriculture had as an ever-present depressing influence, and in a. issued a detailed defense of its crop forecast totaling doubled way,first because it is an accumulated stock 1,500,000 bales more than private forecasts. We learn from the newspapers that this plan of of wheat in sight of the whole world, and secondly, the Farm Board has met with a cold reception. And and still more, because it acts as a deterrent on speculation, no one caring to engage in speculation for a well it might. What is it the planters are asked to rise while it remains uncertain When and how the do? In compliance with the request of the Farm Government means to dispose of its large holdings of Board, they have already reduced their acreage to the grain. Accordingly, we find September wheat the extent of 10%.

Its estimate in 1929 was 717,000 bales too present week there must have been a large use of the high.

Obviously, however, at that rate it will not 1006 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE take long to use up the whole $125,000,000 of the credit, though we see it suggested that some domestic bills may have been turned over to the Reserve banks because of the call for currency in connection with the local bank failures in New Jersey and in New York. But, in addition, the Federal Reserve banks have also further greatly enlarged their holdings of United States Government securities, raising the total from $680,631,000 Aug. 5 to $727,961,000 Aug.12,involving further inflation of Reserve credit in amount of over $47,000,000. The discount holdings, representing direct borrowing by the member banks, have also slightly further increased, rising from $188,575,000 to $194,980,000. The result altogether is that total bill and security holding representing the volume of Reserve credit outstanding, have risen from $941,582,000 last week to $1,064,781,000 this week, showing an inflation of credit in the large sum of $123,199,000, all in a single week. Federal Reserve notes in circulation have increased during the week from $1,772,672,000 to $1,829,301,000, while gold reserves have risen from $3,429,037,000 to $3,449,182,000. One item in these Federal Reserve returns remains as much an enigma as before. We refer to the foreign bank deposits. These have been increasing with great rapidity in recent weeks, and the present week show a further addition in amount of no less than $48,106,000, bringing the total of these foreign bank deposits up to the extraordinary amount of $180,483,000. At this figure comparison is with only $5,676,000 as recently as June 17. No explanation as to the nature of the growth in this item has come from the Federal Reserve officials, but the general supposition has been that it was due to the action of the Bank of France in converting its holdings of bankers' acceptances into cash and depositing the proceeds with the Federal Reserve Bank. And, as apparently confirming this view, it was found that the bills purchased by the Federal Reserve banks for their foreign correspondents had decreased in about the same amount, the item having fallen in the interval from $378,717,000 on June 17 to $225,852,000 Aug.5. The further increase in foreign bank deposits of $48,106,000 the present week cannot be explained in that way,the total of the bills purchased for foreign correspondents having shrunk only $5,678,040 during the week. An explanation of the real meaning and significance of this great expansion in foreign bank deposits ought now to be forthcoming from the Federal Reserve authorities. There is little to be said regarding the figures of brokers' loans this week beyond noting that the contraction in these loans still continues, there having been a further decrease the past week of $17,000,000, bringing the amount of these brokers' loans down to $1,329,000,000 as against $1,346,000,000 a week ago and $3,155,000,000 12 months ago on Aug. 13 1930. In the different categories of loaning, loans for own account by the reporting member banks in New York City decreased during the week from $960,000,000 to $936,000,000, while loans for account of out-of-town banks increased from $222,000,000 to $230,000,000, and loans \"for account of others\" fell from $164,000,000 to $163,000,000. The stock market this week showed a decidedly improved tone. It manifested a great deal of irregularity in the fluctuations from day to day. Weakness, however, on one day was quickly followed by [Vox. 133. renewed strength the next clay, and if often lookect as if the market was receiving considerable support,. a feature previously absent. At the half-day session. on Saturday last the market was haavy, though not actually weak,except in the case of the railroad list. On Monday the victory achieved by the Bruening. Government in Germany over radicalism in the Prussian elections on Sunday was a favorable feature calculated to promote an upward tendency, but as against this the great break in the cotton market• caused by the large crop estimate of the Agricultural Bureau, given out after the close of trading_ on Saturday, worked in the opposite direction and proved a great drag on the market, as a result of which large and extensive declines occurred throughout the whole list. On Tuesday, however, the market sharply recovered, as it appeared that the German situation was steadily improving, besides which news of the signing by the powers of the protocol officially proclaiming the Hoover moratorium and of the reduction in the discount rate of the Bank of • Germany from 15% to 10%, proved stimulative • factors, prices all through the list moving up in very substantial fashion. The rise continued in the morning of Wednesday, but was followed by a sharp downward reaction in the closing hour of the day, under which a part of• the gains of the previous day were lost. On Thursday, however, the market straightened up again, and the rise in prices was resumed,though only in a moderate way. On Friday the advance continued along broad lines. The railroad stocks continued depressed in the early part of the week, as for so long past, but developed more or less strength as the week advanced, and buying orders also appeared to be more in evidence. Only 60 stocks reached new low figures for the year during the week, while 26; stocks touched new high levels. There was no deviation during the week in the call loan rate on the / Stock Exchange from 11 2%, the figure so long prevailing. Trading has been on a somewhat larger scale. At the half-day session on Saturday the sales on the New York Stock Exchange were 295,280 shares; on Monday they were 707,346 shares; on Tuesday, 1,602,880 shares; on Wednesday, 1,259,180 shares; on Thursday, 1,379,180 shares; on Friday,'1,830,240 shares. On the New York Curb Exchange the sales on Saturday were 89,645 shares; on Monday, 153,315 shares; on Tuesday, 274,445 shares; on Wednesday, 214,635 shares; on Thursday, 197,135 shares, and on Friday, 259,765 shares.

The condition of corn on Aug. 1 was 76.3% •of normal, against 83.7% on July 1, a decline of 7.4 points for that month. The condition of the crop harvested last year, which was far from satisfactory, was 62.0% of normal on Aug. 1 1930, while the ten-year average Aug. 1 condition was 79.7%. Production of corn this year is now estimated at 2,775,301,000 bushels, against an estimate of 2,967,953,000 bushels indicated on July 1, this year. The loss during July was 192,652,000 bushels. A part of this loss may easily be recovered before the harvest. Last year, however, conditions continued unfavorable and the yield, which on Aug. 1 was indicated at 2,211,823,000 bushels, showed a decline to 2,093,352,000 bushels in the final harvest.

The acreage in cultivation this year was 41,491,000 acres, and with the average abandonment after July 1, for the past ten years, the probable area to be picked this year is indicated at 40,129,000 acres against 45,218,000 acres last year. The yield last year was 13,931,937 bales, and was well up with the average of the two preceding years. The crop of 1926 was the largest ever reported, being 17,977,374 bales. Of the ten states of large production seven report prospects of a larger yield this year than in 1930. For the three important Atlantic Coast states, Georgia and the two Carolinas, a reduction in the crop for this year compared with 1930 is now shown. For Texas and the Gulf States a much larger yield is now indicated. The same is true of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee. The Department says that reports indicate that weevil damage in the Western section of the cotton belt will be somewhat larger than last year. In the Southeastern States it may equal that of last year which was not heavy. AUG. 15 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE a harder tendency appeared. The industrial section showed few points of interest and changes were unimportant. Greater cheerfulness prevailed Wednesday, owing to the formal agreement on technical aspects of the intergovernmental debt suspension proposal and the favorable overnight reports of the New York market. British funds were up early in the day but lost most of their gains before the close. British industrial stocks were featured by a rise in the textile issues and firmer tendencies in motor shares. The Anglo-American trading favorites responded to the rise at New York. The London market developed strength Thursday, owing chiefly to the circulation of a rumor that the Government was considering a 10% tariff on all manufactured goods. This report was interpreted favorably and British industrial stocks advanced, although no confirmation could be obtained. British funds made headway on an advance in sterling exchange. International stocks developed weakness on reports of uncertainty in New York. Dealings yesterday were quiet, with British funds slightly lower, while industrial stocks remained firm. The Paris Bourse was influenced Monday,like all other markets, by the recession in cotton prices, which outweighed the Prussian plebiscite in importance for the time being. After modest initial strength, prices dropped sharply and almost all stocks showed substantial losses at the end of the session. Weakness again prevailed Tuesday, but trading was of such small proportions that little significance was attached to the decline. Although France produces no cotton, the decline in the price of this commodity occasioned further uneasiness, it was said, owing to the effects on world economy. Support was lacking on the Bourse in this situation and prices of stocks drifted slowly lower. A slight recovery followed Wednesday, partly as a result of the lowering of the Reichsbank discount rate from 15 to 10%. Trading remained small, but prices advanced generally. Thursday's session was one of the dullest ever witnessed on the Bourse, dispatches said. Execution of a few orders in the first few minutes was followed by a long period in which no transactions whatever were recorded. The stocks that were traded in generally showed lowered quotations. The Bourse was again dull yesterday, but prices were somewhat improved. Final steps for placing in formal effect the proposal of President Hoover for a one-year suspension of all payments on intergovernmental debts were taken in London, Tuesday, by the committee of technical experts appointed to arrange the details. After discussions over a period of three weeks, two main documents were signed. The first of these, according to an official announcement by the State Department in Washington, is a report containing the recommendations of the experts to the interested governments relating not only to the program of repayments of suspended reparations by Germany, but to repayment of other amounts suspended during the year by other European governments. The second document is a protocol, or formal agreement, relating solely to German reparations payments. \"Subject to formal ratification by their legislative bodies,\" the statement said, \"the following governments have indicated their willingness to accept the President's proposal: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, 1009 Japan, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and also, as regards relief debts due, the governments of Holland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Switzerland. The position of Greece and Yugoslavia is not yet finally determined, and certain difficulties remain to be overcome before the question of their acceptance is settled.\" Provisions of the protocol, it was indicated, are to be made retroactive, 60 as to make the suspension of payments effective as of July 1 1931. Under its terms, generally speaking, all suspended payments become unconditional obligations of the debtor governments to be repaid over a 10-year period beginning July 1 1933, with interest at 3%. The text of the agreement, which is reprinted in full in subsequent pages of this issue, discloses that the suspended German annuity is to be repaid by 10 equal annuities of 117,831,000 reichsmarks, each installment to be divided into 12 monthly payments due the 15th of each month. The Washington statement indicated that all other suspended intergovernmental payments are to be treated in exactly similar fashion. The report of the experts, an Associated Press dispatch from London said,states that it would have been much better if the procedure of repayment of suspended obligations could have been simply a postponement until 1932 of payments due in 1931, until 1933 of payments due in 1932, and so on. \"A different method was contemplated in the FrancoAmerican agreement of July 6,\" the experts' report is quoted as saying,\"and in view of the importance of reaching an agreement without delay, those governments which are not parties to the Franco-American agreement have agreed to adopt the method of repayment contemplated in that agreement.\" Two annexes attached to the protocol, and not so far made available, are said officially to deal with such matters as the form of the bonds to be delivered to the reparations receiving countries on account of suspended unconditional reparations loaned to the German railways and the method of handling existing contracts for deliveries in kind within the spirit of the President's proposal. \"The recommendations and the protocol,\" the State Department announcement said, \"cover questions arising between European governments. There is no occasion, therefore, for the American Government participating in the report or signing the protocol. Our Government is gratified at the progress made in giving practical effect to the suspension program suggested by President Hoover on June 20.\" The United States was represented at the London discussions only through an observer,Hugh S.Gibson,Ambassador to Belgium. Efforts to achieve a better understanding among the heads of European governments will continue, according to indications given at Rome last Saturday, immediately after the conclusion of the visit to the Italian capital of Chancellor Bruening and Foreign Minister Curtius, of Germany. After discussions of world economic problems and disarmament matters with their Italian hosts during the two-day visit, invitations were issued by the German Ministers for a similar stay at Berlin by Premier Mussolini and Foreign Minister Dino Grandi. The invitation was accepted, dispatches said, but no date was set for the trip. This, however, will probably be made in September. The conversations at Rome, it 1010 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE - was indicated in reports, related largely to the disarmament conference which is to be held at Geneva next February, and to economic questions of mutual interest. The sole official statement on the visit, issued after the meeting ended, stated merely that \"the necessity has been recognized of establishing active and mutually trustful collaboration by all governments to overcome the present difficulties.\" The four statesmen agreed, it was said, that every effort must be made for favorable and effective results at the disarmament conference \"in the interests of peace and the economic and moral life of the world.\" Paris reports of Thursday indicated that Premier Laval and Foreign Minister Briand will visit Berlin late in August, in order to return the visit made to Paris by Chancellor Bruening and Dr. Curtius last month. It was suggested that the conversations between the French and German statesmen will be of an informal friendly nature covering all questions concerning the two nations. Extraordinary efforts for the speedy balancing of the British budget were started this week by the Cabinet committee which began early in the month to study the report of the special governmental economy committee, submitted to the House of Commons July 31. Much perturbation was caused by the statement of the special committee that a budget deficit of £120,000,000 may develop next year unless stringent measures of economy are adopted. London reports this week indicated that the question was assuming the proportions of a grave domestic crisis. It was rumored in the British capital last Sunday that the MacDonald Cabinet might attempt a coalition of all parties in order to overcome the difficulty. It appeared, subsequently, that common action will be soughtfor placing the nation's finances on a sounder basis. Stanley Baldwin, leader of the Conservative opposition, and his lieutenant, Neville Chamberlain, conferred at 10 Downing Street with the Labor Cabinet committee early Thursday, and Sir Herbert Samuel, leader of the Liberal faction during the illness of David Lloyd George, also discussed the matter with the Labor Government heads later in the day. There were rumors for a while that a 10% tax on imports might be imposed to meet the difficulty, but these were scoffed at in official quarters. All the party leaders were said to be agreed that the substitution of tariffs for economies would not meet the situation, and it was indicated late Thursday that the aim will be realized through drastic curtailment of expenditures. In order to balance the budget equal sacrifices and efforts by all sections of the community will be demanded, it was said. A full Cabinet meeting was called for next Wednesday to formulate plans for dealing with the situation. Although Parliament stands adjourned until Oct. 20, it appears likely that the members will be called together under special powers in September to enact necessary legislation. The much debated question of the present political temper of the German people was answered in a most satisfactory manner last Sunday, when a plebiscite in Prussia disclosed that the extremist parties have made no gains since the elections Id last September and have, in fact, lost a little of their strength. The election in the largest of the German States was purely a test of party strength, engineered by the National-Socialists, or Fascists, with [VoL. 133. the support of the Communist and other extreme groups. In the national elections of last September startling gains were made by these elements, and the threat of their accession to power in the event of further increases in popularity was one, of the chief reasons for the flight of capital from Germany that began immediately after the general election. It was widely assumed that the severity of the economic crisis in Germany, and especially the recent financial difficulties, had added. markedly to the number of Fascists and Communists in. the Reich. The Prussian election of last Sunday does not appear to bear this out, as the number of voters who registered their approval of the Fascist-Communist plans made up a smaller aggregate than these groups were able to muster last September. On the other hand, only a few hundred thousand voters expressed active opposition to the Hitlerites and Communists, by voting against the proposition. Directly involved in the election was the question of dissolution at once of the Prussian Diet. A favorable vote on this proposal of the extremist groups would have meant the holding of a State election only six months before this eveut is due in any case. An earlier test of strength was desired by the Fascists, who secured the support of Communist and other parties shortly before the election. Prussia was chosen for the test on the old principle that \"he who controls Prussia controls the Reich.\" The Stahlhelm (Steel Helmet) organization of reactionary war veterans supported the move actively, and the necessary petition signed by 10% of the voters was easily obtained in order to force an election. Success for the extremist groups would have meant the end of the 10-year rule of the Socialist, but moderate, Premier Otto Braun, and it might also have been followed by political chaos in Germany as a whole, as a further election throughout Germany on the question of Reichstag dissolution, would surely have followed. The election held in accordance with the plans of the Fascist and Communist leaders is therefore of great significance to all of Germany,and perhaps to all the world. Under German electoral laws a favorable vote of half the eligible electorate is required to effectuate any project on which a special election is called. Close to 27,000,000 persons in Prussia are entitled to vote, so that about 13,500,000 affirmative ballots were needed for the success of the Fascist-Communist plans. Less than 10,000,000 affirmative votes actually were cast, or 37% of the electorate, as against the 50% required. The groups that aimed to overthrow Premier Braun thus failed by more than 3,500,000 votes to achieve their object. Almost equally significant is the fact that the parties sponsoring the election of last Sunday received almost 2,500,000 more votes in the general election of last September, among the same electorate, than they did in the present balloting. This indicated sober second thoughts among many voters who cast \"protest\" votes in favor of the extremists last September, and it showed, moreover, that the rigorous financial measures and tax reforms of the Bruening Government are not so unpopular as many observers had supposed. The campaign that preceded the election was an extremely heated one, with both sides employing forces at their command in a rather ruthless fashion. Prussian newspapers were forced by the Braun Government of that State to print a manifesto condemn- AUG. 15 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE ing the plebiscite, and the effect of this measure was merely to arouse antagonism among all elements, _regardless of party affiliations. President von Hindenburg intervened and demanded a modification of the Prussian decree of press censorship and control, and some of the sting of Premier Braun's action was thus removed. The election itself was marked by rioting in Berlin and disorders in many other centers, about 14 people being killed and many wounded. Order was readily restored Monday, however, and gratification was expressed in all responsible quarters over the results of the balloting. A simple ceremonial at Berlin, Tuesday, in which the twelfth anniversary of the Constitution of the German Republic was celebrated, gained in impressiveness from the defeat of the extremist groups. In London and Paris the outcome of the test occasioned feelings of extreme relief. In Washington, Administration officials abandoned their customary rule of avoiding comment on the domestic affairs of foreign countries and also expressed great satisfaction over the results. Negotiations for the sale to Germany, on liberal credit terms, of substantial amounts of the cotton and wheat now held by the Federal Farm Board have been unsuccessful so far. There seems to be little likelihood that anything will be accomplished in this fashion. The \"suggestion\" conveyed to the German Government through United States Ambassador Frederic M. Sackett resulted in an offer, last week, for purchase by the German Government of 600,000 bales of cotton from the Board, with an option on an additional 200,000 bales. Berlin reports indicated that the cost of the cotton would be computed on the basis of average prices of the New York, Liverpool and Bremen cotton exchanges, payment to be made in three years with the credit bearing 41 2% interest. / It was indicated in Washington,late last week, that this offer had been rejected by the Farm Board, which declared that it could not comply with the terms. \"In addition to other •difficulties,\" a Farm Board statement said, \"the original suggestion of Ambassador Sackett five weeks ago provided for a minimum price which would have contributed materially to stabilizing the price of cotton and would have made it possible for the Board to offer participation to the holders of new crop cotton. The fall in prices since that time, due in part to the situation in Central Europe, has necessarily led to the elemination by the German Government of that feature of its offer.\" Further examination of the matter was promised. Berlin dispatches of last Saturday remarked that a plan had been presented by Germany to American negotiators for the purchase by the Reich of 600,000 tons (about 22,000,000 bushels) of the Farm Board's wheat. The May option price was suggested as a basis for the transaction, with delivery to be made in 1932. The plan of payment was not disclosed. Although no official statement has been made in Washington regarding this proposal, it was remarked in reports this week that the prospects for effecting the sale were not considered bright. Relaxation of the financial crisis in Germany proceeded swiftly this week, as measure after measure for the restoration of customary financial procedure was taken by the authorities. Conditions within Germany begin to approach those obtaining before 1011 the huge flight from the mark depleted the gold and foreign exchange holdings of the Reichsbank and engulfed the entire country in the most perilous credit crisis the world has witnessed in a decade. There is much doubt, however, regarding the time of repayment of the foreign creditors who hold shortterm German obligations. Study of this question and of the immediate further credit needs of Germany was started at Basle last Saturday by the international committee of bankers named by the B. I. S. in accordance with the recommendations of the London conference of seven governments. In the meantime an excellent effect has been occasioned by the formal approval on the part of all the powers involved of the technical measures necessary for the operation of the one-year intergovernmental debt holiday proposed on June 20 by President Hoover. • Restrictions ;upon banking within Germany were completely removed last Saturday, when withdrawals from the savings banks up to 300 marks were permitted without notification. The institutions were prepared to exercise their right of requesting 30 days' written notice for larger withdrawals, but this procedure proved unnecessary. Resumption of normal savings bank payments was accompanied by rather larger withdrawals at some Berlin institutions than were noted when the commercial banks again made full payments, but banks in the provinces reported good results and began to ship currency to the Reichsbank. The Berlin runs soon ended, and in the current week financial transactions have been conducted on an orderly and normal basis. Encouraged by these developments and by a steady improvement in the position of the Reichsbank, the central council of the German central bank decided, Tuesday, to lower the discount rate from 15% to 10%, and the rate on collateral loans from 20% to 15%. A statement issued at the time by the Reichsbank authorities indicated that the present rates are still regarded as excessive and that every effort will be made to reduce them further. Restrictions on foreign exchange dealings by the importers and exporters of the Reich,applied Aug.6 under an emergency decree, were removed Aug. 7 owing to numerous protests against application of the rigorous rules. Complete freedom for the foreign trade of the country was restored by a decree of the Bruening Government. Discussions of the B. I. S. committee of bankers on German credits were started at Basle last Saturday under the chairmanship of its American member, Albert H. Wiggin, Chairman of the Board of the Chase National Bank. Other members of the committee are Walter Layton of Britain, Dr. Carl Melchoir of Germany, Alfredo Beneduce of Italy, Emile Moreau of France, Emil Francqui of Belgium, Dr. R. G. Bindschaedler of Switzerland, T. Tanaka of Japan, 0. Rydbeck of Sweden, and C. E. ter Muelen of Holland. This \"committee of ten\" rapidly completed its task of organizing and arranging its procedure, and consideration of the actual problem was started last Sunday with a two-hour exposition of the Reich's situation by Dr. Itelchoir. The early negotiations, dispatches said, concerned chiefly the means of prolonging existing short-term credits to Germany. It was decided Tuesday, after preliminary exchanges, to call a meeting at Basle of all the interested bankers. Representativesof the creditor banks in many countries indicated they would attend, it was said, and a delegation from the Reichsbank, empowered to act for the debtors, also agreed 1012 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE I:VoL. 133. Sunday. Martial law was proclaimed in the Provinces of Havana and Pinar del Rio, and the Mexican Congress voted in extra session to grant Senor Machado authority to extend the military rule throughout the country. A strict censorship was established on news from the interior, but it nevertheless appeared that the movement was spreading and that thousands had joined the opposition, headed by former President Mario G. Menocal, Col. Carlos Mendieta and Dr. Mendez Penate. Sporadic fighting occurred at numerous points, with the authenticated casualties by Thursday amounting to 36 dead and 53 wounded. The revolt centered, according to some accounts, in the Province of Santa Clara, and President Machado went to the 'battle front\" Thursday in a reputed effort to negotiate with the revolutionary leaders and bring about a truce.

New York and London bankers, who extended about80% of the outstanding short-term credits in Germany held by foreign interests, were said to have reached substantial agreement Tuesday on the terms of extension. It was suggested in a Basle report to the New York \"Times,\" on the basis of unofficial estimates, that the amount involved totals $750,000,000, of which $450,000,000 was advanced by American bankers. Representatives of the New York banks chiefly concerned—the Chase National Bank,the National City Bank,the Guaranty Trust Co., and the International Acceptance Bank, Inc.—met at the Federal Reserve Bank Wednesday and empowered Mr. Wiggin to act for tifem in the negotiations.

Money dealers reported that the oversupply characteristic of the market for many months now was not so great as usual early in the week, but the market nevertheless retained all its previous aspects. Funds were offered freely at all times, and an overflow from the Stock Exchange into the unofficial street market was reported every day, so far as call loans are concerned. Demand loan quotations on the Stock Exchange were 13/2% throughout, while in the outside market transactions were arranged at 1%, or a concession of M% from the ,official rate. A Treasury bill issue of $60,280,000, awarded Thursday, reflected a very slight tightening of the money market, apparently because of expectations that funds may be in greater demand during the autumn. The 91-day bills were sold by the Treasury at an average rate on a bank discount basis of 0.63%. Issues of similar maturities and approximately similar amounts marketed one, two and three weeks ago resulted in rates, respectively, of 0.56%, 0.51% and 0.46%. Brokers loans against stock and bond collateral were down $17,000,000 in the statement of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week to Wednesday night. Gold movements in the same period consisted of imports of $2,972,000 and exports of $17,000. There was a net increase of $5,000,000 in the stock of gold held earmarked for foreign account. Dealing in detail with call loan rates on the Stock Exchange from day to day, there was again no deviation at any time from the figure of 13/2%, this having been. the quotation both for new loans and for renewals on every day of the week. Time money has continued in the doldrums. Virtually no business was transacted. What little was to be had, was at special concession as all quotations are nominal. A Quotations continue at lh@11 % for 30, 60, and 90 days; the rate for four months is 13/2@,1% %,and for five and six months 1%@2%. The market for prime commercial paper continued brisk, most of the demand coming from New England points, and some of the larger nearby cities. The paper, available was insufficient to meet the requirements and sales were restricted on that account. Rates for choice names of four to six months' maturity continue at 19@2%. Names less well known and shorter choice names are 23'@23/2%. The German Bank statement for the first week of August records an increase in gold and bullion of 1,726,000 marks. The total of bullion now stands at 1,365,024,000 marks, as compared with 2,619,025,000 marks last year and 2,148,318,000 marks the year before. Increases are shown in reserve in foreign currency of 60,889,000 marks, in bills of exchange and checks'of 57,591,000 marks, in silver and other coin of 15,361,000 marks and in notes on other German banks of 4,657,000 marks. The total of deposits abroad now is 65,548,000 marks. Notes in circulation show a decline of 78,131,000 marks, reducing the total of the item to 4,385,601,000 marks. Circulation last year was 4,398,293,000 marks and The market for prime bank acceptances quieted the year before 4,472,149,000 marks. Advances, down to a considerable extent, more bills were avail- able and at times exceeded the demand. Rates remain unchanged. The quotations of the American Acceptance Council continue at: For bills up to 90 days, 1% bid, y% asked; for four months' bills, A 13/8% bid, 1% asked; for five and six months, 13 % bid and 13'% asked. The Federal Reserve banks showed a big increase in their holdings of acceptances during the week, namely from $66,074,000 to $135,738,000. Their holdings of acceptances for foreign correspondents fell from $225,852,000 to $220,174,000.

The market has been quiet and reasonably steady. On several occasions this week there was evidence of a demand for sterling, especially in the early part of the week. Frequently when the rate showed signs of weakness there were heavy purchases of sterling bills, which might reasonably be taken to indicate that the market was receiving support from official sources. The range this week has been from 4.85 1-32 to 4.8594 for bankers' sight A bills, compared with 4.84 9-16 to 4.857 last week. • The range for cable transfers has been from 4.853.1 to 4.85 13-16, compared with 4.84 15-16 to 4.86 1-16 a week ago. Sterling continues weak against francs and several of the other European currencies, noticeably against Holland and Switzerland, but at every dip of the London check rate on Paris it was apparent that the Bank of France was giving sufficient support to the pound to keep it just above the export point for gold from London to Paris. Despite the fact that exchange both here and in France indicates official support, bankers can find no evidence that the Bank of England has drawn very heavily on the credit for $250,000,000 recently arranged for the British central bank by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of France. London dispatches assert that while the Bank of England has again lost gold this week, the heavy withdrawals of funds by the Continent are diminishing. At all events the London money market seems more confident as to the immediate outlook for sterling. The improved outlook in the German credit situation is also a factor reacting favorably upon sterling exchange. The sharp decline in cotton and grain prices is also regarded as a favorable factor since the drop in commodity prices should greatly lessen the autumn drain on London, which usually begins toward the end of August. Some weeks ago it was thought that sterling had every chance of going to full dollar parity, but with the German crisis and the heavy withdrawals of funds from London by the Continental banks fulfillment of this prospect has become unlikely. For many weeks before June 1 the opinion was frequently voiced in London that the Bank of England would make every endeavor to build up its gold holdings to something in excess of £160,000,000 to provide safely against the seasonal autumn drain, but this policy bankers seemed agreed must also be abandoned and the Bank of England will do well if it faces the autumn with bullion totaling £150,000,000. Tourist expenditures will be helpful to the pound for a few weeks longer, but this demand also will drop off sharply during September. This week the Bank of England shows a loss in gold holdings of £1,523,527, the total standing at £133,304,228, which compares with £154,105,312 on Aug. 13 last year. On Saturday the Bank of England sold £311,066 in gold bars, released £650,000 in sovereigns, and exported £20,000 in sovereigns. On Monday the Bank of England sold £307,747 in gold bars, received £200,000 from abroad, exported L72,000 in sovereigns, and bought £1,702 in gold bars. On Tuesday there were approximately £950,000 South African bar gold available in the open market. Of this amount £550,000 had already been sold on forward account to France. Approximately £30,000 to £40,000 was taken by India and the trade. It is believed that the remainder went to the Bank of England. The Bank is believed to have bought this balance of bars for one of the central banks and released an equivalent amount of sovereigns previously earmarked. On Wednesday the Bank of England released £200,000 in sovereigns, sold £6,885 in gold bars, received £2,842 in sovereigns from abroad, and exported £4,000 in sovereigns. On Thursday the Bank received £3,575 in sovereigns and exported £3,000 in sovereigns. On Friday, the Bank exported £10,000 sovereigns and bought £22 foreign gold coin. At the Port of New York the gold movement for the week ended Aug. 12, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consisted of imports of $2,972,000, of which $2,841,000 came from Mexico and $131,000 from other Latin American countries. Exports were $17,000 to France. There was an increase of $5,000,000 in gold earmarked for foreign account. In tabular form the gold movement at the Port of New York for the week ended Aug. 12, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was as follows: GOLD MOVEMENT AT NEW YORK,AUG.6-AUG. 13,INCLUSIVE Exports. imports. $17,000 to Frtuace $2,841,000 from Mexico 131,000 from other Latin American countries $2,972,000 total $17,000 total Net Change in Gold Earmarked for Foreign Account. Increase: $5,000,000 During the week approximately $7,500,000 gold was received at San Francisco from Japan and $580,000 from China. Yesterday the New York Reserve bank reported the receipt of ,000,000 of gold from Argentina and of $1,000,000 from Uruguay. An additional $7,500,000 was received at San Francisco from Japan. AUG. 15 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE Canadian exchange continues easy and at a discount. On Saturday Montreal funds were marked 5-16 of 1% discount, and on Monday and the remainder of the week at 11-32 of 1% discount. Referring to day-to-day rates, sterling exchange on Saturday last was quiet with a tendency toward firmness. Bankers' sight was 4.85 1-32@4.853; cable transfers 4.853'@4.85%. On Monday sterling was in demand. The range was 4.85 5-32@4.85 9-16 for bankers' sight and 4.85 17-32@4.853 for cable % transfers. On Tuesday sterling was steady, inclined to firmness. Bankers' sight was 4.85 5-16@4.85%; cable transfers 4.85 11-16@4.85%. On Wednesday the pound continued in demand. The range was 4.853/@4.85% for bankers' sight and 4.85%@ 2 4.85 13-16 for cable transfers. On Thursday the market was steady. The range was 4.85%@4.85 9-16 for bankers' sight and 4.85%@4.85 13-16 for cable transfers. On Friday the range was 4.853/2@ 4.85 9-16 for bankers' sight and 4.853( for cable transfers. Closing quotations on Friday were 4.853/ for demand, and 4.85% for cable transfers. Commercial sight bills finished at 4.85 5-16; 60-day bills 3 2 at 4.813/; 90-day bills at 4.79%; documents for payment (60-days) at 4.811 and seven day grain bills A at 4.843/s. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4.85 5-16. Exchange on the Continental countries is quiet and rates show little change from a week ago. German marks continue to be nominally quoted. To all appearances the German situation shows every prospect of improvement and money rates have declined in Berlin. On Tuesday the Reichsbank reduced its discount rate from 15% to 10% and its rate on collateral loans from 20% to 15%. In a statement accompanying the announcement of the cut in the rate the council of the Reichsbank pointed out that the excessive Bank rate was adopted only in view of the financial crisis and as it had amply fulfilled hopes by speeding up money circulation after the reopening of the banks without any material increase in the banks' creditors or the amount of money circulated, there was no need of maintaining the higher rate longer. At the time of the reduction in the rediscount rate, the discounted paper held by the Reichsbank had diminished by $29,000,000 and the amount of currency in circulation had declined by $25,000,000 owing to the restoration of normal banking conditions last week. The statement added that the Reichsbank directorate realized that the new 10% rate was still extremely high and regarded it as one of the bank's chief tasks to do everything in its power to effect a further lowering of the rate. The policy of the Reichsbank in discounting bills for only 10 days as long as the 15% rate was in force showed that Dr. Luther was determined to lower the rate within 10 days after its adoption on July 31. On Saturday last all municipal and other public savings banks resumed full payments. These institutions total approximately 2,600. Their action followed similar resumption by private banks on Wednesday of last week. The outcome of the Prussian plebescite to dissolve the Diet is hailed in banking circles as a victory for Chancellor Bruening and the conservative forces in Germany. Plans are being made to reopen the Berlin Boerse on Wednesday, though this action may have to be ,flelayed. 1015 French francs are quiet in the New York market. The franc is especially strong with respect to nearly all other currencies. The Bank of France statement for the week ended Aug. 8 reports a new record of gold holdings, with bullion reserves at 58,556,751,063 francs, which compared with 46,656,473,849 francs on Aug. 9 1930. All other Continental exchanges are quiet in this market. Thus far the Continentals continue to receive support through tourist requirements, although these are much less than in other years. The tourist support will help the European exchanges for only a few weeks longer, for as a seasonal matter these requirements drop off after the first week of September and come to an end in October, when exchange turns against Europe and in favor of the United States. The London check rate on Paris closed at 123.94 on Friday, against 123.88 on Friday of last week. In New York sight bills on the French centre finished at 3.91%, against 3.91 7-16 on Friday of last week; cable transfers at 3.91%, against 3.91 9-16, and commercial sight bills at 3.91 11-16, against 3.91 3-16. Antwerp belgas finished at 13.92 for bankers' sight bills and at 13.923/ for cable transfers, against 2 13.923/2 and 13.93. Berlin marks are nominally quoted 23.75, against 23.70. Italian lire closed at 5.23 for bankers' sight bills and at 5.231 for cable 4 transfers, against 5.22% and 5.23. Austrian schillings closed at 14.053/2, against 14.05; exchange on Czechoslovakia at 2.963, against 2.963j; on Buchare§t at 0.593/2, against 0.593/2; on Poland at 11.213/2, against 11.20, and on Finland at 2.511 2, against / 2.515 . Greek exchange closed at 1.293 for bankers' % % sight bills and at 1.293' for cable transfers, against 1.291% and 1.29%. Exchange on the countries neutral during the wax presents no new features. The Scandinavian currencies are steady, although ruling much below dollar parity. The Scandinavian units have a strong tendency to move in sympathy with the variations in the sterling rate. Holland guilders and Swiss francs are exceptionally firm, as money from London and several European centres will continue strongly attractive to Holland and Switzerland until the difficulties surrounding sterling exchange and the German financial situation are fully resolved. It is believed that much Spanish money is also seeking Holland and Switzerland. Spanish pesetas continue at weak levels, as they are completely under the influence of the political situation in Spain. Developments in Spain do not warrant much confidence in the future of the peseta. Stabilization is apparently more remote than in the closing months of the monarchy, when it appeared as though definite steps were being taken to accomplish this object.

The German situation continues to present •con. flicting currents, with apparent evidences of economic recovery and political stability crossed by economic and political uncertainty and apprehen•sion. The failure of the plebiscite held on Aug. 9 was widely acclaimed as a signal victory not only for the Prussian Government, the dissolution or continuance of the Prussian -Diet Ming the issue on And. 15 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE which the referendum was held, but also for the Bruening Government of the Reich, which had openly opposed the plebiscite and would have suffered a moral rebuff if it had succeeded. The immediate result, of course, is decisive, and the Diet, instead of being repudiated and a special election made necessary in November, will run its normal course until May 1932. A scrutiny of the vote, on the other hand, does not leave the prospect for the future quite so clear. The State of Prussia, with an area somewhat less than three-fifths of that of the Reich, had in 1925 a population of 38,109,922. The percentage of voters to population, as elsewhere in Germany, is high, the number of voters at the present time being approximately 26,899,000. In the election last September the National Socialists polled in Prussia 3,967,379 votes, the Communists 3,141,547, the Nationalists 1,968,658 and the People's Party 1,004,118. All four of these parties, it was believed, would support the plebiscite, and in addition five smaller parties representing between them upwards of 2,000,000 votes. Altogether, the opponents of the Diet appeared able to command some 12,000,000 votes out of the approximately 13,500,000, or a bare majority of the total vote of the State, needed to make the plebiscite effective. The vote actually cast on Sunday fell considerably short of 10,000,000. Detailed figures of the voting are not available, but Berlin dispatches report that the Communist vote fell off considerably from what was expected, and that the support of the People's Party was only nominal. As the Constitution takes account only of the affirmative votes cast in a plebiscite, and as less than 500,000 voters took the trouble to vote in the negative, it is apparent that the plebiscite was defeated by the stayat-home vote. Whether those who refrained from voting are "
