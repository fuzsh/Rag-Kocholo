        "text": "Winnipeg just experienced one of the most extreme months ever seen since records began in 1872.\n\nWith every single day posting above-normal temperatures and an average mean temperature of 3.1°C, it was the warmest November on record. In fact, much of Manitoba recorded its warmest November this year. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, Brandon, Emerson, Portage, Sprague, Flin Flon, Thompson, The Pas and Swan River all had their warmest November on record. The month was marked by both a lack of cold and frequent bouts of record warmth.\n\nEvery single day was warmer than normal in Winnipeg, a streak that began in late October. Up to December 7th, we have now had 48 consecutive days of above normal temperatures.\n\nWarmest November on Record: The Numbers\n\nRankAverage\n\nDaily High (°C)Average\n\nDaily Mean (°C)Average\n\nDaily Low (°C) 17.2 (2016)3.1 (2016)-1.1 (2016) 27.1 (2009)1.3 (1899)-3.2 (1923) 36.4 (1999)1.3 (1923)-3.3 (1899) 45.8 (1899)1.0 (1981)-3.3 (1922) 55.8 (1923)0.9 (2001)-3.5 (1981) 65.7 (2001)0.8 (2009)-3.6 (1917) 75.5 (1981)0.6 (1999)-3.7 (1953) 85.3 (1939)0.5 (1917)-3.9 (2001) 95.2 (1904)0.2 (1922)-4.3 (1918) 104.6 (1917)0.1 (1953)-4.3 (1944)\n\nThe average mean temperature of 3.1°C in Winnipeg in November was an impressive 7.7°C above the 1981-2010 normal of -4.6°C. It also broke the old record by a margin of 1.8°C! The old record being 1.3°C in 1899 and 1923. It is quite significant to break a monthly record by this significant a margin. To give a perspective, March 2012 had only exceeded the previous warmest March by 0.6°C and September 2009 exceeded the previous warmest September by 0.9°C. The last time we broke a monthly record by this kind of margin was in January 2006 when we exceeded the previous warmest January by 3.2°C! The following graph of November mean temperature per year since 1872 shows how much this year was an outlier!\n\nBrandon also had it warmest November on record with an average mean temperature of 2.0°C, breaking the old record of 0.7°C in 1917 and 1953. This gave a record margin of 1.3°C, again the greatest since January 2006. It was also 7.6°C above the 1981-2010 normal of -5.6°C.\n\nTemperatures were especially warm early month with highs regularly in the double digits. Winnipeg exceeded 10°C on 10 occasions, tied with 1981 and 2009 for second most on record in November. Record was 11 days above 10°C in 1904. The monthly maximum was 18.8°C on the 9th, smashing the old record of 14.4°C in 1923 and 1930. It was also the latest date on record to reach or exceed 18°C since 1872. In total, two record highs, three record high minimums and one tied record high occurred in November, and they are listed below.\n\nDateRecord TypeNew RecordOld Record Nov. 6High Maximum16.7°C16.7 (Tied 1975) Nov. 6High Minimum7.4°C5.6°C (1906 / 1922) Nov. 9High Maximum18.8°C14.4°C (1923) Nov. 9High Minimum4.8°C2.8°C (1969) Nov. 12High Maximum13.6°C13.2°C (1981) Nov. 24High Minimum0.1°C0.0°C (1988)\n\nMany locations across southern Manitoba reached 20°C during the warm spell and many more than once. In fact, Baldur, Ste. Rose, McCreary, Portage la Prairie, Deerwood and Boissevain all saw three days exceed 20°C. The maximum recorded temperature was 22.7°C in Ethelbert and Alonsa. 20°C highs occurred in southern Manitoba November 4th, 5th, 6th and 9th. The latest known occurrence of 20°C in Manitoba was on November 17, 2001 when Morden reached 21.0°C.\n\nIn general, November simply featured a distinct lack of cold conditions. This helped Winnipeg break the following records:\n\nOnly 5 days dipped below -5°C, breaking the old record of 7 days in 1899.\n\nOnly one day dipped below -10°C, tied with 1912, 1923, 1981 and 2001 for the least on record.\n\nOnly 18 days dipped below freezing, breaking the old record of 20 days set in 2015. Normal is 28 days.\n\n28 days exceeded the freezing mark, tied with 2009 for 2nd most. Most was 29 days in 1899.\n\n4 days exceeded 15°C, tied with 1903 and 1981 for most on record.\n\n2nd Warmest Fall on Record\n\nWith an average mean temperature of 8.0°C, it was the 2nd warmest fall on record in Winnipeg. The warmest was in 1963 when we averaged 8.6°C (1963 had featured the warmest October on record).\n\nRankDaily High (°C)Daily Mean (°C)Daily Low (°C) 115.0 (1963)8.6 (1963)3.3 (2016) 213.2 (1923)8.0 (2016)2.9 (1931) 313.0 (1948)7.9 (1931)2.3 (1953) 412.8 (1931)7.5 (1923)2.3 (1963) 512.8 (2009)7.3 (1953)2.0 (1922) 612.8 (2016)7.3 (2009)2.0 (2015) 712.6 (1920)7.3 (2015)1.9 (1923) 812.6 (2011)7.2 (1948)1.7 (1914) 912.6 (2015)7.1 (1914)1.7 (2009) 1012.4 (1914)7.1 (1920)1.5 (1920) 1112.2 (1953)7.0 (1922)1.5 (1944) 1212.1 (1994)6.8 (1994)1.5 (1994) 1312.1 (2001)6.8 (2011)1.4 (1908) 1412.0 (1906)6.6 (2004)1.4 (1948) 1512.0 (1938)6.5 (1940)1.3 (1940) 1611.9 (1899)6.3 (1908)1.3 (1954) 1711.9 (1922)6.3 (1962)1.2 (1934) 1811.9 (2004)6.3 (2001)1.2 (1981) 1911.7 (1940)6.2 (1899)1.2 (2004) 2011.5 (1962)6.2 (1981)1.1 (1912) 2111.5 (2005)6.1 (1906)1.0 (1962) 2211.3 (1908)6.1 (2005)1.0 (2011) 2311.3 (1909)5.9 (1944)0.9 (1968) 2411.3 (1990)5.9 (1998)0.8 (1983) 2511.3 (1998)5.8 (1904)0.7 (1949) 2611.3 (1999)5.7 (1938)0.7 (2005) 2711.2 (1952)5.7 (1954)0.6 (1956) 2811.2 (1981)5.7 (1968)0.6 (1960) 2911.2 (1987)5.6 (1912)0.5 (1904) 3011.1 (1897)5.6 (1943)0.5 (1928)\n\nWe reached 2nd warmest mainly due to the warmest November on record. However, September was also warm with an average of 14.4°C, tied with 2005 for 19th warmest September. October was also above normal with an average mean temperature of 6.6°C, 1.5°C above normal.\n\nRecord Humidity\n\nAverage dewpoint temperatures were also at a record high this November and fall. In fact, they were shockingly anomalous in November. Dewpoint temperatures averaged 0.3°C in November in Winnipeg, obliterating the previous record of -2.9°C set last year. It’s one thing to break a monthly record two years in a row, but to break the previous year’s record by 3.2°C is just another story!\n\nRankHighest Average Dewpoint (°C)Lowest Average Dewpoint (°C) 10.3 (2016)-14.9 (1985) 2-2.9 (2015)-13.9 (1996) 3-3.0 (1981)-12.6 (2014) 4-3.2 (2009)-12.3 (1978) 5-3.9 (1962)-12.3 (1995) 6-3.9 (2001)-11.9 (1986) 7-4.0 (1954)-11.7 (1955) 8-4.0 (1999)-11.3 (1959) 9-4.2 (1953)-11.3 (1966) 10-4.3 (1983)-11.3 (1976) 11-4.7 (1987)-10.7 (1991) 12-4.8 (1956)-10.1 (1989) 13-4.8 (2005)-9.4 (1982) 14-5.0 (1980)-9.3 (1973) 15-5.0 (2004)-9.1 (1965) 16-5.1 (1994)-9.0 (1990) 17-5.1 (2011)-8.9 (1993) 18-5.2 (2008)-8.8 (2003) 19-5.5 (1998)-8.5 (2013) 20-5.5 (2010)-8.4 (1972)\n\nThe graph below shows very well how out of bounds this year was in terms of average dewpoint temperature in November. In fact, it was almost two and a half standard deviations above the 1981-2010 normal of -7.4°C.\n\nAverage dewpoints were also at a record high for the fall season. The September to November average was 4.4°C, breaking the old record of 3.6°C in 2009.\n\nA total of 18 record high and high minimum dewpoint records were broken throughout the fall season from September to November: 12 in November, 5 in October and 1 in September. Not a single record low dewpoint occurred. This included a record high dewpoint of 12.3°C on November 6 which was also an all-time high dewpoint temperature for November since 1953. The previous record was 11.1°C on November 5, 1956.\n\nDateRecord TypeNew RecordOld Record Nov. 4High Maximum9.7°C9.5°C (1981) Nov. 5High Minimum2.2°C1.7°C (1956) Nov. 6High Maximum12.3°C9.4°C (2000) Nov. 6High Minimum4.9°C1.4°C (1977) Nov. 7High Maximum10.8°C10.4°C (1977) Nov. 9High Maximum7.7°C6.1°C (2010) Nov. 23High Minimum-0.4°C-1.5°C (2001) Nov. 24High Minimum-0.2°C-0.7°C (1988) Nov. 28High Minimum-1.0°C-1.1°C (1998) Nov. 29High Maximum3.4°C2.1°C (1998) Nov. 29High Minimum-1.5°C-2.3°C (1987) Nov. 30High Minimum-2.1°C-2.8°C (1962)\n\nPostponed First Snowfall\n\nThanks to warm conditions (and a bit of luck), Winnipeg did not see its first snowfall accumulation of the season until November 22, the latest date on record to see our first measurable snowfall of the season. A measurable snowfall is a snowfall of at least 0.2 cm. This broke the old record of November 21 in 1963 and was more than a month later than the 1981-2010 normal of October 18.\n\nRankDate of First Measurable Snowfall (≥ 0.2cm)Year 1November 222016 2November 211963 3November 201953 4November 191931 5 tie\n\n5 tieNovember 18\n\nNovember 181880\n\n2015 7November 171890 8November 161977 9November 151903\n\nWinnipeg also went 225 days without measurable snowfall (Apr 11 to Nov 21), the 3rd longest snow-free period since 1872. The longest such period was 232 days in 1998.\n\nAfter a prolonged period of hot and humid weather across Southern Manitoba, a frontal wave pushing eastwards triggered numerous severe thunderstorms across southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba. None was worse than a thunderstorm that exploded over southwestern Manitoba and rapidly developed into a massive supercell thunderstorm. After a short while, this storm organized and produced its first tornado; this would end up being just one of numerous touchdowns over the course of the following 3 hours. The tornadoes this supercell thunderstorm produced were staggering in their intensity; perhaps most notably was the tornado it produced near Tilston, Manitoba whose size and power shocked even veteran storm chasers.\n\nPre-Storm Setup\n\nForecasters knew days ahead of time that Monday had the potential to be a significant day across southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba. A cold front that had pushed eastwards across the Prairies over the prior couple days stalled out over the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border on Sunday as a strong jet crashing in over the west coast dug into the upper-level trough, deepening and tilting it while the upper-level ridge built over eastern Manitoba in response. This allowed even more heat and moisture to build over the region at the end of a week that had already seen dew points regularly above 20°C with temperatures climbing into the upper 20’s or low 30’s. On Monday, a shortwave ejected out of the trough and lifted northeastwards, temporarily reversing the cold front and transforming the boundary into a nearly-stationary warm front. As the shortwave moved through the region, it triggered the thunderstorms and began to sweep the frontal wave off to the east-northeast.\n\nOn Sunday, it was already looking conditionally likely for tornadogenesis in any thunderstorms that developed over southwestern Manitoba. Pulled directly from the PASPC Significant Weather Discussion:\n\nSIGNIFICANT WEATHER DISCUSSION ISSUED BY THE PRAIRIE AND ARCTIC STORM PREDICTION CENTRE OF ENVIRONMENT CANADA AT 2:00 PM CDT SUNDAY JULY 26 2015.\n\n[…]\n\nEastern Prairies… The light southerlies are bringing even more heat and humidity. Most areas, especially the Red River Valley, look to be a degree or two warmer today and that will push humidex values into the low fourties today. A heat warning as thus been issued for the Red River Valley and Central Interlake. As of 18Z values are already between 36 and 38. The heat continues Monday but should be below 40 in most localities.\n\nMeanwhile, the cold front from the low in Central Saskatchewan will lie along the Manitoba/Saskatchewan border by early afternoon today at which point its eastward progression begins to slow dramatically. This feature will be the focus of nearly all severe weather potential for the next 48 hours. Ahead of the front in Southern Manitoba, MLCAPE values increase to 2000 to 2500 J/kg this afternoon with 30-40 knots of deep layer shear. While the jet maxima remains well to the west, there are still 40 knot southwesterlies at 500mb and 40 knot southerlies at 850mb pushing in from the Dakotas. This could produce a few more supercells as it did Saturday over Alberta and Western Saskatchewan. However, continued warm air advection all the way up to 700mb makes most of the south capped for the day – particularly so in the extreme southeastern corner. Terrain and remnant outflow interactions closest to the front make the Westman and Interlake areas the most likely to see severe thunderstorms but overall the risk looks moderate this afternoon and early evening if the cap breaks.\n\nA new low pressure system develops rapidly late Sunday in Eastern Montana bringing strong easterly winds in the low levels to the International Border areas in Southeast Saskatchewan and Southern Manitoba Monday afternoon. Hodographs have impressively veering profiles with up to 55 knots of deep layer shear accompanied by 2500 J/kg MLCAPE. This has potential to develop tornadic supercells, with forecast 0-3KM EHI values of 4+ and SIGTOR of up to 2 in the area with even higher values south of the border. However, this is all very conditional at the moment, as strong thunderstorm development today or tonight could shift boundaries somewhat or consume much of the instability over the area. Cloud cover in general could also be an issue for daytime heating, both from remnant overnight cells but also from the upper level jet closing in from the west. Finally, the same strong low level advections are building a very strong cap of -100 J/kg or stronger. Once again, regardless of daytime activity, this same setup is promising for severe elevated convection for Manitoba south of the Interlake and the Estevan area Monday night.\n\n[…]\n\nIt was clear that there was going to be a heightened and dangerous severe weather potential on Monday. By Monday afternoon, things had become even more clear:\n\nSIGNIFICANT WEATHER DISCUSSION ISSUED BY THE PRAIRIE AND ARCTIC STORM PREDICTION CENTRE OF ENVIRONMENT CANADA AT 2:00 PM CDT MONDAY JULY 27 2015.\n\nEastern Prairies… This afternoon looks like a repeat of yesterday for heat and humidity in the Red River Valley and East. Temperatures are already in the high twenties with dewpoints in the low twenties, making it feel like the mid thirties as of early this afternoon. The heat warning has thus been issued for the area for one more day.\n\nThe main weather story is the rapid development of the low pressure system in Eastern Montana. While there was uncertainty yesterday about the placement and motion of the low, nocturnal thunderstorm activity in the warm sector was very quiet, and satellite has borne out the extremely sharp and digging trough over the west predicted by most models. Surface analyses early this morning shows the low placement as forecast and is bearing out the early stages of northwestward movement and deepening as well. Ongoing convection leftover from this morning has weakened substantially and will continue to move northward with the rapid lifting of the warm front and the tilting of the jet.\n\nThus, many of the conditions potentially preventing the development of more significant severe weather in southeast Saskatchewan and Southwest Manitoba have been removed. Over the Montana low itself, skies are partly cloudy so it does look like many areas will see some sun today. A plume of 20 degree dewpoints is expected to wrap around the low, intersecting steepest mid level lapse rates with good surface convergence at the warm front about the Carlyle area early this afternoon. Hodographs here now have even more impressively veering profiles compared to yesterday, still with up to 55 knots of deep layer shear accompanied by 2500 J/kg MLCAPE. Thus, the potential for tornadic supercells continues to rise for the afternoon hours. 0-3 KM EHI are currently 5+ with SIGTOR values still climbing towards 1 early this afternoon. Models are in excellent agreement, with values quickly falling off below 0.5 in about 150km radius on all sides. As a result, a tornado watch has been issued for the Carlyle region for this afternoon. The threat for tornadoes will likely persist in extreme southeastern regions until the early evening hours.\n\nAll that remains is the capping inversion, which is weaker but still present – again weakest around Carlyle with only -20 J/kg MLCIN by 21Z, and rapidly increasing to -100 J/kg to the northeast and northwest. A few models trigger afternoon storms about these upper features and surface outflow, but still in the same area. The HRRR and 4km NAM seem to delay the onset of the convection until 00Z or 01Z this evening by which time the upper ridging has pushed eastwards into Manitoba. At any rate, supercell development will be rapid where it occurs and quickly transition into a much larger linear system building north and east. All this warrants a moderate to high risk of severe thunderstorms with potential for tornadoes, significatn large hail, winds and rain in an area bounded by Coronach, Broadview and Pilot Mound. A slight risk is warranted northeast to the Regina area and north to Yorkton, where likely more elevated storms could still pose a wind, hail and rain threat into the evening. Severe thunderstorm watches may need to be expanded for these regions later today if such threats become slightly more probable.\n\n[…]\n\nBy midday Monday, it was clear that most of the factors that would work against severe thunderstorm development did not materialize, and a significant threat for tornado-producing supercells existed in Southeastern Saskatchewan and Southwestern Manitoba.\n\nTouchdown: Tilston, Manitoba\n\nThe primary supercell that became the main focus for Monday evening initiated near Carnduff, SK at around 7:00PM CDT. It was relatively weak initially, wrestling with a couple other storm cells trying to initiate nearby as it moved onto the Manitoba side. As it passed by Gainsborogh and Pierson, the cells merged and organized and rapidly intensified. The first funnel cloud developed near Edward, MB:\n\nThe funnel formed and dissipated a few times as the low-level inflow organized, and then reformed and developed into a significant tornado near Tilston:\n\nThe tornado continued to grow in size & intensity as it continued northeastwards. As the supercell continued to organize itself, extremely impressive velocities began to show up on doppler RADAR:\n\nDespite the height of the RADAR beam in the storm at this time, this velocity couplet1 clearly indicated a major event underway. As it progressed to the northeast, the storm developed into a large, multi-vortex tornado:\n\nTerrifying Intensity\n\nThere’s no question that this tornado was one of the more powerful tornadoes in Canadian history.2 While the tornado was on the ground near Tilston, it grew into a massive circulation that had multiple tornadoes embedded within it:\n\nShortly after this stage, the tornado became rain-wrapped.3 Tracking various reports alongside the velocity couplet visible on doppler RADAR, the tornado-producing portion of the storm appears to have tracked from just southeast of Tilston north-northeastwards to between Reston and Cromer. It then took a slight jog eastwards and tracked along a line from between Pipestone and Scarth to east of Virden to just south-southeast of Crandall. After this point, the circulation weakens and the storm loses it’s organized tornado-producing capacity.\n\n[map autofit=”1″ disable_scrollwheel=”1″] [pin tooltip=”Carnduff, Saskatchewan” description=”The storms that eventually developed into the massive tornado-producing supercell initiated just east of Carnduff, SK.”]Carnduff, Saskatchewan[/pin] [pin tooltip=”Tilston, MB” description=”Just outside of Tilston, MB was where a massive multi-vortex tornado that shocked storm chasers touched down on Monday evening.”]Tilston, Manitoba[/pin] [pin tooltip=”Reston, MB” description=”The large, multi-vortex tornado passed just west of Reston, MB.”]Reston, Manitoba[/pin] [pin tooltip=”Cromer, MB” description=”The large, multi-vortex tornado was seen southeast of Cromer, MB.”]Cromer, Manitoba[/pin] [pin tooltip=”Pipestone, MB”]Pipestone, Manitoba[/pin] [pin tooltip=”Scarth, MB”]Scarth, Manitoba[/pin] [pin tooltip=”Virden, MB”]Virden, Manitoba[/pin] [pin tooltip=”Crandall, MB”]Crandall, Manitoba[/pin] [/map]\n\nThe thunderstorm’s circulation was not completely consistent throughout, though, and showed signs of cycling. This means that instead of one tornado being on the ground for a long time, it likely produced several tornadoes and had periods with no tornado present. There is no question, though, that when it was on the ground, it was a historic event. A simple sign of how intense it was? Reed Timmer, someone who has made a living off planting himself in the middle of some of the largest tornadoes the United States has seen, showed noticeable anxiety as his team got close to this tornado. As a caution, this video contains strong language.\n\nClean-Up Underway\n\nLittle in the way of damage was observed on Monday night; with the tornado occurring so late in the day. There were a few early indicators that this tornado was very strong, including asphalt ripped right off a bridge:\n\nCome Tuesday morning, though, more signs began to roll in of the damage:\n\nFor now, the clean-up continues for the few people that were affected by it and the rest of us can be thankful that, somehow, this long-tracked tornadic thunderstorm managed to miss almost all population centers in the region.\n\nEnvironment Canada Rates Tilston Tornado High-End EF2\n\nAt 5:38PM CDT on Wednesday, July 29th 2015, Environment Canada issued a preliminary rating of a high-end EF2 to the Tilston tornado:\n\nAWCN11 CWWG 292238\n\nWEATHER SUMMARY FOR SOUTHERN MANITOBA ISSUED BY ENVIRONMENT CANADA AT 5:38 P.M.

Here’s how the day unfolded in his own words.\n\nStorm Chase Log – July 27, 2015\n\nby Matthieu Desorcy\n\nWell, it was quite the chase day in southeast Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba. It all started off leading into the weekend when models began showing some tornado potential and there was fairly good consistency between runs in the region of concern. A few of us, including another AWM member – Scott Kehler, decided to take the day off make the drive out west and go chasing.\n\nOn the morning of July 27th, our group left Winnipeg around 10:30AM make our way to southeast Saskatchewan, where we expected storms to initiate. The setup looked promising from the get-go early in the morning as most of the MCS activity stayed well north of our target area and little cloud prohibited surface heating from happening, allowing the warm front to lift into southeast Saskatchewan. Not knowing exactly which town we were targeting, we headed down along highway 2 all the way to Souris to start off where we had our usual chase day lunch – Subway. Knowing that the cap would hold strong until early evening, we weren’t in a huge rush to get to southeast Saskatchewan. We made a quick analysis which revealed by early afternoon the warm front was already across the border and was visible as a fine line on Foxwarren radar as well as Glasgow radar, stretching from southwest to northeast. We then decided to head to Redvers, SK, which was located just south of the warm front.\n\nInflow winds were gusting into the storm at a speed of an estimated 70-80km/h – the strongest inflow I’ve ever felt.\n\nWhen we arrived in Redvers it was obvious the warm front was nearby – the wind came from the east southeast and the air felt “chillier” than just to the south in Carievale, SK. After observing several attempts of towering cumulus trying to break the cap, then moving north of the warm front and dying off near Redvers the setup suddenly wasn’t looking too promising. The cap was holding strong. Resisting the urge to relocate to another area further southwest we held strong in Redvers while getting a nice suntan and living from radar scan to radar scan.\n\nIt suddenly started to get exciting in the mid-evening. A few radar echoes began to show up south of Carnduff, SK near the international border which gave us hope the disturbed area would be able to get its act together and break the cap. In addition to the new echoes on radar, we observed some high level cirrus which implied that ascent was beginning to take place, associated with a shortwave we had identified earlier, moving into the region. This would give storms the extra push they needed to break the cap.\n\nEchoes steadily strengthened from scan to scan and finally it was obvious that the storm had broken the cap – it had tops exceeding 50,000 feet. We watched the storm as it grew and slowly moved northwards, organizing itself and finally producing the first wall cloud of the day – the chase was on. Around 7:30PM the wall cloud really beefed up in the same area – a bowl formed and one side of the wall cloud was rising rapidly into the updraft. After watching it for a good 20 minutes the storm had appeared like it gusted itself out, the wall cloud disappeared and the base was higher. Taking advantage of the opportunity and knowing that nothing was imminent, we relocated to a location just north of Gainsborough, SK. Here we watched it for another 20 minutes as the supercell cycled wall clouds and produced what appeared to be a funnel.\n\nAs the storm slowly moved north northeast it moved away from us – we once again repositioned, this time on the Manitoba side, to the southeast of the storm not too far from Pierson, MB. This is when we noticed that things were really getting serious and potentially dangerous for surrounding communities. Minot radar showed that the storm had really tightened up its rotation. Once we were able to stop and take a close look at the storm. We noticed that a tornado was already in progress – and a large one that that, around 8:30pm northwest of Melita. We watched it for a good 20 to 30 minutes in the middle of nowhere in southwestern Manitoba northwest of Melita, snapping pictures amazed at what we were seeing a wedge tornado, here in the province of Manitoba. Inflow winds were gusting into the storm at a speed of an estimated 70-80km/h – the strongest inflow I’ve ever felt. It was obvious that the storm was moving away from us so we decided to move once again, this time to the north of Melita. By this time (9:20pm) we could not see the tornado anymore but the tornado could have been rain-wrapped. We cautiously watched the storm from the comfort of our car as cloud to ground lightning intensified and positive strikes coming out of the anvil peppered the area just to our north. By this time it was getting dark and the circulation would have been rain-wrapped – we watched the storm for a while longer and decided to call it a day as it was getting too dangerous to chase in the dark.\n\nThis was one of the stronger storms any of us had ever seen in person and will be a chase to remember for a long time to come!\n\nChase Diary #2: Justin Hobson\n\nIn addition to Matt, friend of the site Justin Hobson was also out chasing that day. Here’s what he experienced:\n\nTilston, MB Chase Log\n\nby Justin Hobson\n\nWe started the day in Oxbow, Saskatchewan where we dealt with tropical conditions as temperatures shot up near 30 degrees with dew points in the low 20’s. A deepening low pressure system was located to the southwest of us over northeast Montana and winds increased out of the east throughout the afternoon. A warm front was anchored from the southwest to the northeast across extreme southeast Saskatchewan and storms started to fire around 6 pm where they then rapidly intensified. There was some cell interaction going on at first due to the forcing that came in but one supercell was able to survive and latch on to the warm front around 8 pm (Manitoba time) where it became tornadic over the next 2-3 hours.\n\nWe caught a glimpse of a brief rope tornado while driving around 8:25 pm. We kept heading north where we then witnessed a violent stovepipe tornado at about 8:30 pm. This stovepipe then transitioned into a multi-vortex tornado which then got wrapped in rain where it appeared to have dissipated. We then repositioned ourselves for the new occlusion just to the northeast of the old circulation. Shortly after, we saw another tornado develop which started off as a large cone. This cone tornado quickly wedged out and grew to about 1/2 mile in size. This wedge lasted for a few minutes before becoming rain-wrapped as the sun set. It then continued to move to the northeast very slowly for another hour or so towards the Virden/Oak Lake area. What a day!"
