        "text": "Ontario – and more specifically – Waterloo Region, will finally get some reprieve from the scorching sun today while the rest of the country will get to experience warm, summer conditions.\n\nRain is the forecast for most of today, just ahead of the weekend. But Environment Canada expects warm, sunny temperatures to resume for the following days, and likely for the rest of the summer.\n\n570 News Weather Specialist John Wilson is calling for all advisories to end. There will be a few scattered showers and a chance of a weak thundershower this morning, then the clouds begin to clear by evening. The guaranteed high will be a manageable 24 degrees. The humidity will be high this morning, but drop later in the day.\n\nAs for tonight, look for partly cloudy skies and a low of 16.\n\nThen for the weekend, Saturday and Sunday will be sunny with low humidity, and highs around 27 degrees.\n\nSpeaking of the weekend, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist David Phillips says by this weekend everyone across the country will have a “taste of summer.”\n\nHe says British Columbia and the prairies will finally see wall to wall sun.\n\nThey need it after heavy rains drenched parts of the Prairies over the past month, producing destructive floods and ruined crops.\n\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper surveyed some of the flood damage in Yorkton, Saskatchewan yesterday where one-thousand homes were damaged.\n\nRain is in the forecast for Ontario today, but warm, sunny temperatures will likely continue for the rest of the summer."
