        "text": "What Is Sleep Apnea?\n\nLeading you to better health\n\nDo you…\n\nSnore?\n\nStop breathing in your sleep?\n\nWake up feeling unrested?\n\nFeel exhausted during the day?\n\nStruggle with your weight?\n\nOften feel depressed or irritable?\n\nThe video below will show you how to properly use your ApneaLink Air Home Sleep Testing Device.\n\nIf you have any further questions you can email us or give us a call at 1-877-738-8702\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, you may have sleep apnea. Not only can it affect your relationships and career, if left untreated, you’re at greater risk for car accidents, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, even sudden death.\n\nThe good news? Sleep apnea IS treatable and you’ve come to the right place.\n\nWe can set you in the right direction and explain your options.\n\nStop Suffering\n\nSleep apnea is treatable and you’ve come to the right place.\n\nWe can empower you to live symptom-free and improve your respiratory health.\n\nEpworth Sleepiness Scale\n\nHow likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast to feeling just tired?\n\nThis refers to your usual way of life in recent times.\n\nAuto CPAP Titration\n\nIf you are on CPAP therapy, chances are that your pressure hasnʼt been re-assessed in quite some time.\n\nPlease click here to learn more or call if you have any questions.\n\n30 Day Mask Guarantee\n\nWhen you purchase a mask from Prairie Oxygen, you have 30 days from the date of purchase to exchange your mask for a credit towards a different product.\n\nThis gives you recourse should unforeseen mask problems arise. If you are having difficulty achieving a proper fit with your mask.\n\nSleep Apnea Sufferers\n\nare more likely to report having…\n\nDiabetes\n\n2.5 Times\n\nMore Likely\n\nHeart Disease\n\n2.2 Times\n\nMore Likely\n\nHypertension\n\n1.8 Times\n\nMore Likely\n\nMood Disorder\n\n2.5 Times\n\nMore Likely\n\nCPAP FAQs\n\nMy pressure feels too high. Can you adjust them for me?\n\nWe cannot adjust pressures without a prescription. Your pressures were specifically designed for you by a specialist to ensure your therapy works for you. You will need to contact your respirologist or your family doctor to discuss a pressure change.\n\nMy CPAP Machine is saying that the SD Card is invalid. How do I fix this?\n\nThere are two options on the bottom of the screen asking to erase the SD card. Select YES by turning the knob on the right hand side of the screen to highlight it, and push the button on the top of the knob to select it. It will take a few minutes for the machine to reformat the card. It is NOT erasing the data, only reformatting it.\n\nWhy do I have water gurgling in my tubing?\n\nThe room temperature is colder than the humidity that is moving through the tubing. This creates a buildup of condensation that passes over the corrugation inside the tubing, causing the noise you are hearing.\n\nTry pulling the tubing underneath the blankets on the bed so it is somewhat insulated from the cold air.\n\nPurchase (or make) a tubing wrap to cover the tubing to help insulate it.\n\nResmed S9, ResMed Airsense, Respironics System One Machine, and Respironics Dream Station offer a heated tubing that prevents this from happening.\n\nI changed the filter on my machine, why is there still a message saying to change filter?\n\nThe machine has a built in reminder for changing the filter that will come up every 3 months. You need to change the filter on the generator. Acknowledge that you have done so by hitting the button on the right side of the screen (two little checkmarks) to reset the reminder to come up again in three months.\n\nHow can I stop my mask from leaking?\n\nAdjust the Velcro on the headgear accordingly: i.e. if air is blowing into your eyes, adjust the top straps. Be sure the straps are adjusted as evenly as possible.\n\nGive the mask a good cleaning as oils from your skin may build up on the cushion, which may make it slip and allow air to escape.\n\nThe cushion on your mask may be worn out and need replacing. They are constantly under pressure and break down over time due to oils and bacteria. Masks should be replaced annually and cushions after six months if they are no longer sealing.\n\nI was told I can use CPAP Wipes for daily cleaning. Can I use any kind of wipes?\n\nCPAP wipes are made specifically for masks. Silicone is not tolerant of antibacterial agents or bleach, and lotions will add extra oils to the cushion, resulting in the mask not sealing properly. Most other wipes have got one, or a combination of these products in them. Please use wipes designed for CPAP masks, as they will not degrade the silicone, and shorten the life of your mask.\n\nWhy do I feel bloated in the mornings?\n\nYou are taking more air in then you are exhaling. The air then needs to go somewhere so it travels to your stomach and causes this discomfort. The mask seal should be checked, and if this is still a problem a request can be made for a prescription to turn on the EPR on your CPAP machine. This is a comfort option to allow the individual to exhale easier.\n\nHow do I obtain a download before my next doctor's appointment?\n\nPlease bring in your machine and we will be happy to download the data from it. We can either send it to the doctor for you, OR you may take a copy with you. Newer machines such as Resmed Airsense 10 and Respironics Dream Station have wifi, and can be downloaded without having to bring in your machine.\n\nI use a Nasal or Pillows mask and I am getting a dry mouth. Will I have to use a full face mask?\n\nNot necessarily. You can try one of two things, or a combination of both:\n\nTry turning up your humidity. This will hydrate your nasal passages, as well as keep your saliva glands hydrated.\n\nUse a chinstrap. This will hold your jaw up and allow for less or no air leakage from your mouth.\n\nWhy is my machine making a loud sound?\n\nMore often than not, the machine is not a problem, it is the mask. Because of the tubing running from the mask to machine, it may sound as though the noise is coming directly from the machine. Try readjusting the mask. If that does not work, please contact us.\n\nI am going through an entire tank of water. Why is this happening?\n\nYour machine works by drawing in room air to give you the pressure that will keep your airway open. It also is drawing in humidity from the air. If your room is dry, as it often is in the winter, the machine will compensate and go through more water in a night. (The reverse is true as well, you will normally go through less water in the summer). Please keep your humidity at a level that is comfortable for you, and refill the chamber should it be necessary. It is more important to ensure proper humidity than to extend the amount of time you have water in the chamber.\n\nI was told I need a full face mask, but my friend has one that is much smaller and only for the nose. Why was I not given this option?\n\nWhen we are fitting you for a mask, we most concerned about your quality of sleep, and are very conscientious of what will suit you best. A pillows or nasal mask will work for many people, but if you are a mouth breather by day, your jaw will likely drop at night and the air will rush out of your mouth, which means it is not holding your airway open as it should. As well, it will be very loud, and your mouth will be very dry upon waking. A full face mask will ensure you are able to breathe through BOTH your mouth and nose.\n\nWhy are my chest and lungs sore?\n\nIn the first few weeks of treatment, your chest muscles need to become accustomed to exhaling against the pressure from the machine. It is very much like running a soccer field for the first time in 20 years, and feeling tight in the chest area the next day. This pain should go away within time. You may also consider getting an EPR (epiratory pressure relief) for comfort exhaling."
