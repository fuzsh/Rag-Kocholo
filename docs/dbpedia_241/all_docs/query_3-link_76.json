        "text": "Our weather has been hell here lately. I just picked my bike (1995 CR250) up two weeks ago and the weather has gone down hill since. No snow left, but the temperature has generally been below 10 degrees celcius. I want to go riding, but am reluctant right now, as I don't know if jetting should be changed.\n\nSo can anybody tell me what the general guidelines are when it comes to jetting for a particular temperature. The bike is most likely jetted for our typical summer day here, which would be around 20c.\n\nIn COLDER weather, the bike tends to run LEANER, so the adjustment is to go RICHER.\n\nIn WARMER weather, the bike tends to run RICHER, so the adjustment is to go LEANER.\n\nWhen in doubt, always stay on the richer side. Thats a spark plug vrs a top end. And always warm the bike up for a while before going riding.\n\nI understand what would need to be done and what change does what. The thing I'm not sure about is at what point I would need to change it. If, say, the bike was jetted perfectly and normally ridden between 15-20c and it was 5c out, would it be enough difference to warrant a jetting change?\n\nAll bikes are different for this, some are finiky and feel off as soon as there is a 2-3 degree change, my 03CR250 is like this. Some other bikes are less finiky and will tolerate even up to 10 degree change and still run perfect, my friend's 02YZ250 comes to mind. Use the jetting chart in your manual to guide you for the interval when you rejet. 5*C is very cold. You definitely have to rejet if you want to ride at that temp.\n\nTiylu said:\n\nIn COLDER weather, the bike tends to run LEANER, so the adjustment is to go RICHER.\n\nIn WARMER weather, the bike tends to run RICHER, so the adjustment is to go LEANER.\n\nWhen in doubt, always stay on the richer side.

And always warm the bike up for a while before going riding.\n\nThis is EXACTLY right. :thumb:\n\nI was out today with my 03 CR 250, and it was about 5-8ÂºC mark, and I check my plug after about 25 min. and it looked fine. I'm in Melfort so our weather is pretty much the same, but like someone said it seems every bike is diffrent, I would just check the plug after about 20 min of riding to make sure it isn't to light. I'm sure glad they pushed back the first race of the SMA series in North Battleford from April 25, to May 2. Gives a little more time to warm up. Bman do you race? If so what class.\n\nHumidity also has a large effect on jetting requirements. More humidity makes the bike require less fuel, as there is less oxygen available. Less humidity requires more fuel. Basically, if your temp drops and the air becomes more dry, you will need to go quite a bit richer on your jetting. Hot weather/high humidity will require leaner jetting.\n\nNope, I don't race. I actually just got back into riding. I had a couple years off after I traded my last bike towards my summer cruiser. Now I have the cash to ride again.\n\nI ride a lot of trails around town, but also intend to go to the Yorkton track and do some jumping."
