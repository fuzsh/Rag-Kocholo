        "text": "SEEING SIGNS OF BLACK MOULD AT HOME AFTER FLOOD OR WATER DAMAGE?\n\nYou experienced a flood, or water damage in your home, you mopped it up and called it a day. But there is likely water in places you cannot access. Damage to flooring and walls can be evident, manifested as warping, or blistering of paint or wallpaper. Alternatively, they may seem dry on the surface, but are actually damp beneath.\n\nMoisture, in walls, ventilation systems, carpets, furnishings and more, for any length of time, leads to mould growth. Your belongings will start to emit a foul odour, and those living in the house could fall ill.\n\nThe importance of taking quick action after flooding in your home cannot be overstated.
