        "text": "INTRODUCTION TO THE MARKET\n\nIn 2010, Donald M. Berwick, Thomas W. Nolan, and John Whittington, published a now-famous report titled, \"The Triple Aim: Care, Health, And Cost\", which laid a framework for improving the value of health care in the United States via the simultaneous pursuit of three aims: improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita costs of health care. The paper added a third pillar, patient experience, to Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg’s previously established definition of value-based care (VBC), which introduced to the world in his 2006 publication, “Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results,” using a simple equation:\n\nPatient Value =\n\nPatient-Relevant Outcomes / Costs Per Patient to Achieve These Outcomes\n\nEver since these two reports initially defined VBC, fixing the healthcare value problem in the USA has become an increasingly hot topic across the industry, especially as organizations like The Commonwealth Fund began measuring and reporting, in 2014, the dire state of affairs in our nation relative to other parts of the world:\n\nThe United States reportedly ranked last across eleven developed countries based on various value-based measures: quality, per capita cost, access, efficiency, equity, and healthy lives. With the total US healthcare spending exceeding $3.8 Trillion in 2019, there is a pressing need to reduce cost but maintain quality. To fix the problem, providers and payors began working to address the healthcare value problem in three main ways:\n\nAlignment of Incentives: Payors and providers began to contract with each other in new ways, moving away from fee-for-service towards reimbursement linked to improving cost, quality, and patient experience\n\nLongitudinal Care: Payors and providers began to invest in programs focused on improving care across a continuum versus treating point-in-time ailments on an encounter-by-encounter basis\n\nInnovations in Technology: Payors and providers began to invest more heavily in technology aimed at improving performance across value-based contract and care coordination program measures\n\nTo achieve VBC, data is of penultimate importance to track patient-oriented outcomes. Arguably, with the rise of novel machine learning algorithms, better technology management services, the integration of novel health monitoring devices, and interoperability of data flow from EHRs and other health portals, it is now possible to better tie patient outcomes with cost spent on their care. The recognition that value can be grouped to specific patient needs has changed the approach towards achieving VBC with medical services. This activity has spurred the development and rapid growth of three new healthcare vendor and provider market segments:\n\nValue-Based Care Vendors: These vendors primarily sell solutions to payors and providers to improve contractual performance across three domains:\n\nRisk Adjustment: Focused on increasing risk-based reimbursement through specific & accurate diagnostic hierarchical condition coding (HCC) coding\n\nQuality: Focused on increasing care outcomes and associated reimbursement through performance against the defined Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), Medicare Stars, and other quality measures\n\nPopulation Health: Focused on reducing per member per month costs through longitudinal, data-enabled, clinical workflows while improving performance across Medical Loss Ratio- & Capitation-based contractual measures\n\nCare Coordination Vendors: These vendors primarily sell solutions to payors and providers to support four main types of programs:\n\nCare Management: Focused on enhancing coordination of care, eliminating duplication & waste, and helping patients and caregivers more effectively manage their health conditions by coordinating care teams\n\nDisease Management. Focused on disease-specific care interventions and communications for defined patient populations with specifically defined conditions & needs\n\nTransitions of Care: Focused on coordinating care for patients as they move from one healthcare setting to another such as when a patient is discharged from an inpatient hospital to their home\n\nUtilization Management: Focused on eliminating waste in healthcare by evaluating the efficiency, appropriateness, and medical necessity of treatments, services and procedures provided to patients on a case-by-case basis\n\nRisk-Bearing, Tech-Enabled Providers: This new wave of next generation providers has four main characteristics:\n\nInvestment into Technology: Focused on building care delivery and reimbursement models around VBC and care coordination technology that helps optimize performance across risk-based contracts and quality/cost measures\n\nRisk-Bearing Entities: Focused on entering into a higher ratio of VBC contracts versus fee-for-service contracts with payors when compared to “traditional” primary care providers, these providers then use value-based care and care coordination technology to drive performance across their risk-based contracts\n\nHome Health: Although it is not a strict requirement, these providers often focus on caring for and tracking their members not only in their offices but also in their homes\n\nVirtual Care: Again, it is not a strict requirement, but these providers often use remote patient monitoring and/or telehealth capabilities to enhance to track and care for their patients no matter where they are which has seen expansive growth given the Covid-19 Pandemic\n\nWhile these three new technology market segments are distinct from one another in a myriad of ways, they also share enough similarities that it is very common for one organization to offer capabilities in one or more of the three areas. Considering the possible overlap of these technology innovations and possibility for consolidation of services, progressive companies are looking to offer multiple options. Companies will likely advance one key area or expand to other markets, as seen with a series of acquisitions and partnerships formed in the past decade.\n\nThis market research report highlights a select handful of key incumbent and emerging pioneers in each of these new market segments and offers insights on the three sectors with recent advancements in investments, changing landscape, and factors impacting growth.\n\nKEY TRENDS / EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, regulatory environment, and evolving consumer preferences have served as a catalyst for advancing the development of multiple health industries within the United States. All three sectors are assessing how the pandemic has shifted health care needs and have begun integrating new services (e.g., telehealth) to maintain relevance. Multiple companies are expanding their services digitally to their members and pivoting away from a reliance on direct face-to-face care. With a drop in volume of direct patient care, providers and organizations who primarily contracted under fee-for-service (FFS) payment schemes saw decreased revenue, and placed a larger focus on their VBC contacts and other revenue generating services or cost-minimization tools (e.g., care coordination). Nonetheless, all three sectors have seen major changes as highlighted below:\n\nMarket drivers for adoption\n\nValue-Based Care\n\n● 5% of the US population accounts for 50% of national healthcare spending. Adoption of VBC will be further developed to address the most resource-intensive populations.\n\n● 60-70% of total US health spending will be tied to quality and value by 2025.\n\n● CMS’s Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) forces all providers to choose a reimbursement program that includes value-based incentives to receive full federal insurance payment in 2019 for quality & cost measures from 2017 dates of service.\n\n● CMS’ alternate payment programs such as their bundled payment programs require providers to deliver lower cost & higher quality care for business model continuity.\n\nCare Coordination\n\n● Up to 80% of medical errors are related to lack of communication in patient care coordination.\n\n● The Pathway to Success and Promoting Interoperability programs proposed by CMS have created a regulatory tailwind for care coordination organizations. The pandemic has required HCOs to increase staff for care coordination services.\n\n● New reimbursement codes for remote patient monitoring and chronic condition management have created new revenue opportunities for providers.\n\nTech-Enabled Providers\n\n● Consumer demands due to the pandemic have increased the demand for direct-to-consumer digital health companies that provide on-demand clinical services (e.g., lab testing, prescriptions, disease management).\n\n● Telehealth acceptance and utilization has increased by more than 150% since the onset of the pandemic.\n\n● CMS interoperability rules require core provider & payer systems to share data with third-party apps with appropriate consents, making it easier for tech-forward providers to access the data they need in workflow.\n\nOverall solution area maturity\n\nValue-Based Care\n\n● Despite increasing value-based reimbursement under government contracts, the top three commercial insurers still report that 35% - 60% of their agreements are tied to fee-for-service.\n\n● This percentage is expected to drop to 30% - 40% of payments tied to FFS models by 2025.\n\n● Much progress has been made since 80% - 90% of payments were tied to FFS five years ago; however, the evolution of patients under VBC contracts is only one piece to the puzzle.\n\n● Core provider workflow systems (e.g. EHR and RCM platforms) still need to evolve to support new care delivery needs since deliver high-value care during potentially longer but fewer encounters requires new features than were required under FFS models.\n\nCare Coordination\n\n● The 21st Century Cures Act and CMS Interoperability Rules have effectively forced core provider and payor (e.g. EHR & core claims admin, respectively) tech vendors to start sharing data with standalone care coordination platforms where HIPAA consents are in place, which has increased maturity of the segment.\n\n● HIPAA remains a barrier though, even under new CMS Interoperability Rules, since engaging the patient to sign off on sharing their medical data can be a challenge for care coordination vendors.\n\nTech-Enabled Providers\n\n● This segment is the least mature of the three segments covered in this whitepaper.\n\n● VBC & Care Coordination software vendors evolved first and then tech-forward providers increasing began building new business models around these tech stacks with the goals to enter into and perform against risk-based contracts\n\n● Several of the first wave of companies from this segment are now expanding steadily into new markets (as seen in our company snapshots),including ChenMed and VillageMD\n\n● Expansion into new technology capabilities such as remote patient monitoring (RPM) remain on the horizon as providers evolve their platforms.\n\nEquity investment & M&A activity, , market sizing, and projected compound annual growth rates (CAGRs)\n\nValue-Based Care\n\n● The Covid-19 Pandemic caused one subset of the VBC market, the global value-based payment market, to decrease in size from $1.66B to $1.52B from 2019 to 2020, which is expected to by 2023 to $3B with a CAGR of 25.81%.\n\n● VC investments in the value-based care segment set records in 2019, with funding up 80% since 2018 and 300% since 2014.\n\n● Signify Health went public via IPO on the NYSE in February 2021 raising $564m at a valuation of $5.3b\n\n● Bright Health and Oscar Health raised $500m and $225m Series E financing rounds in the private markets, respectively\n\nCare Coordination\n\n● The care management software market, arguably the largest subset of the larger care coordination market, is expected to hit $3B by 2022, with a projected CAGR of 15.4%, and the overall care management solutions market (inclusive of services in addition to software) projected to reach $19.28B by 2023 with a CAGR of 16.1%\n\n● GE Healthcare’s Care Coordination department was spun off by Veritas Capital in July 2018 and was rebranded as Virence Health\n\n● PatientPing, a platform that automates care coordination notifications between providers & care managers, raised $60m in a Series C at a $218m valuation in 2020.\n\n● Wellframe, a care coordination platform backed by BlueCross BlueShield Ventures, raised $20m at a $104m valuation in early 2020.\n\nTech-Enabled Providers\n\n● With the ongoing pandemic investment in companies focused on telehealth services has risen dramatically with a recent report mentioning that global telehealth market size was USD 61.40 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 559.52 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 25.2% during the forecast period\n\n● Partnerships with employer programs and other health care businesses have increased, such as VillageMD’s partnership with Walgreens that included an $1B investment.\n\n● One Medical entered the public market raising $245M\n\n● Telemedicine investments nearly tripled in Q1 2020 with $788M in VC funding compared to $220M during the previous year\n\n● Cityblock Health achieved unicorn status as of early 2021 when they raised $160m at a $1b valuation\n\n● In 2020, Somatus raised $64m in their Series C to improve their kidney care delivery operations\n\nWillingness to buy/invest in focus area by customers\n\nValue-Based Care\n\n● The pandemic has required HCOs to innovate and VBC has allowed them more flexibility and stability compared to fee-for-service, which was a challenge due to decreased elective procedures during the early stay-at-home period.\n\n● Stark and Anti-Kickback Laws passed under the Trump administration may come under scrutiny of the Biden administration, which may create regulatory barriers to investment growth trajectory in the VBC segment.\n\n● Further moves towards reimbursement reform by CMS make VBC more attractive for investment than FFS productivity-based technologies.\n\nCare Coordination\n\n● The emergence of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard by HL7 and regulatory tailwinds to adopt it through 21st Century Cures Act legislation will set the table for increased investment activity in the care coordination segment over the next five years.\n\n● Care coordination vendors themselves have reached late-stage maturity as it related to creating longitudinal health datasets; however, they will need to make increasingly growing investments into technology that leverages AI/ML to better process data and remain competitive.\n\n● EHRs and other patient management platforms are adding care coordination tools that interoperate with other EHRs and core clinical workflow systems, which may make it hard for standalone care coordination vendors to compete for share of provider IT budgets.\n\nTech-Enabled Providers\n\n● Amazon and other larger commercial companies continue to explore tech-enabled primary care delivery, including Amazon’s exploration via Amazon Care (despite the Berkshire deal falling through).\n\n● Walmart and Oak Street Health are collaborating to expand clinics together in a new Fortune 100 partnership\n\n● Michigan Blue Cross Blue Shield demonstrated their interest in investing in the space in early 2020 when they partnered with ChenMed to create six primary care clinics for seniors.\n\n● Iora Health demonstrated VC interest in the space when they raised their $350m Series F at a $692m valuation in early 2020.\n\nVBC, care coordination, and tech-enabled provider organizations will see drastic changes in addressing the needs of dynamically changing patient populations in the United States. The digitalization of services, health consumerism, and increased data access in real-time will impact how companies will work with their patients, provider networks, payors, and partners. As the US government undergoes changes and organizations explore best practices for the implementation of new technologies, current incumbent companies are likely to expand offerings across the three segments while other new players also enter the market, especially in the comparatively immature tech-enabled provider space.\n\nVENDOR OVERVIEW\n\nCompanies in these three sectors are growing at increasingly fast trajectories due to regulatory, pandemic-related, and consumer-preference tailwinds , which have all escalated in the past year due . Many vendors have been exploring VBC for over a decade, but new startups with easier access to data due to CMS Interoperability Rules are steadily coming to the market, posing new competition for current incumbents, which had larger barriers to accessing data when they first got started. Most companies are now turning towards remote services or improved direct-patient care mechanisms in order to evolve their care models going forward in a post-epidemic world.\n\nExpansion into the VBC, care coordination, and tech-enabled provider markets has led to many companies developing proprietary data analytic engines to analyze health data across many normalized data sources (e.g., clinical, pharmacy and medical claims) to identify and stratify member risk for intervention. Some VBC and Care Coordination vendors conduct their own interventions with employed care teams and providers through physical or remote visits, effectively acting as a tech-enabled providers, while other companies partner with third-party primary care or specialist care provider offices to conduct member interventions. Both models have become increasingly attractive to employers as a means to engage with their employees earlier and prevent job loss or time out of work, reducing self-insured medical and pharmacy costs to improve overall financial performance.\n\nThis report covers an assortment of pioneers in each of the three covered market segments, including both emerging players and incumbents, highlighting their business operations, services, target markets, and how they have responded to pandemic-related headwinds. Profiled vendors include: Evolent Health, AdvantMed, Matrix Medical Network, Signify Health, CareCentrix, Medecision, Quantum Health, Crossover Health, VillageMD, ChenMed, SteadyMD, and Oak Street Health.\n\nEVOLENT HEALTH\n\nEvolent Health was founded in 2011, in Arlington, VA, and went public in 2015 via an IPO. As of March 2021, the company was valued at a market cap of $1.73b. Evolent acquired the VBC & Care Coordination company, Valence Health, in 2016 for $219M to expand its care coordination and VBC capabilities in Medicaid and pediatric risk populations. Their business focuses on selling technology and services to providers and payers with offerings in each of the care coordination, value-based care, and next-generation tech-enabled provider segments.\n\nEvolent Health’s business is broken into three core solution areas. Evolent Care Partners offers solutions for independent providers to engage in performance-based contracts, aided by population health tools and care coordination resources, enabling their clients to perform oncost and quality measures. New Century Health delivers specialty care services, targeting cardiology and oncology providers, accepting fully-delegated contractual risk for decreasing client costs, which it aims to improve through specialty benefit & clinical programs. Evolent Health Services offers payor and provider clients with administrative and clinical tech-enabled support, including but not limited to outsourced pharmacy benefit management, risk adjustment, quality, population health management, care management, disease management, utilization management, and actuarial services.\n\nEvolent has several branded tools in their platform focused on reducing total cost of care, improving risk-adjusted revenues, and improving quality outcomes through both clinical and administrative workflows. Their proprietary solutions include: CarePro (specialty care management and clinical decision support platform), Identifi (population health performance management platform), and Precision Pathways (point of care decision support and analysis tool offering evidence-based clinical pathways).\n\nEvolent Health’s recent 2020 Investor & Analyst Day report highlighted that their use of tech-enabled services to build clinical value by enabling payer-provider relationships, and current competition with Livongo and Progyny. Their Q2 revenue for 2020 was ~$239M with 3.1M patients and 35+ partners on the platform. Recently, they added new customers including Centene Corp, Emblem Health, Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, Molina Healthcare. and Passport Health Plan. Seth Blackley, a co-founder of Evolent Health, was made CEO as of October 2020. They recently published a peer-reviewed analysis titled, “Effective Care Management by Next Generation Accountable Care Organizations”, in The American Journal of Managed Care that showed how a complex care management program that Evolent implemented at five Next Generation accountable care organizations (ACOs) reduced all-cause inpatient admissions and total medical expenditures for participating beneficiaries.. Patients (n= 1897) were identified via predictive risk stratification through proprietary ML models and enrolled as needed into the programs, resulting in a 21% reduction in all-cause inpatient admissions and a 22% reduction in total medical expense, demonstrating the value of centrally-staffed Evolent Chronic Care Management (CCM) programs.\n\nADVANTMED\n\nAdvantmed is a privately held company that was founded in 2005 out of Santa Ana, CA, which offers on value-based solutions, specifically risk adjustment and quality improvement solutions, to health plans and risk-bearing entities. The company delivers industry-leading coding accuracy, medical record retrieval, and patient and provider engagement rates through their solutions. Advantmed has a suite of risk adjustment solutions (analytics, record retrieval, coding, claims/data validation, and health assessments) and quality solutions (measurement reporting, record retrieval, HEDIS abstraction, and member engagement). They recently received certification from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) for the Integrated Healthcare Association’s (IHA’s) Align. Measure. Perform. (AMP) measure set.\n\nAdvantmed’s core platform is called ELEVATE!. The platform integrates risk adjustment and quality improvement operations, analytics, and work flows for their customers to have real-time insights. It facilitates medical record reviews and health assessments (at home or in clinic) that help clients close their members’ Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) gaps in care to improve risk adjustment factor scores and quality measure performance. The platform also helps clients submit risk adjustment data (RAPS,EDPS, and EDGE) and quality measure data (HEDIS) to federal program sponsors. They have not published any research highlighting the impact of their platform aside from internal data reports for marketing, which indicate a 90% chart retrieval rate, a 30% improvement in risk score accuracy and a 20-30% increase in health assessment completion rates.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, Advantmed had to expand their solutions into the telehealth sector to maintain their health assessment program’s competitive position. This included expanding a suite of HIPAA-compliant software across mobile devices and computers to allow clinicians to interact with their patients.\n\nAdvantmed leadership includes Akash Patel who has served as founder and CEO for the past fifteen years. He had served as a CFO previously in the tech space in California.\n\nMATRIX MEDICAL NETWORK (CCHN)\n\nCommunity Care Health Network, LLC (CCHN) was founded in 2001 in Scottsdale, AZ, and operates as Matrix Medical Network (MMN). They are offer value-based care solutions to health insurance companies and risk-bearing providers, primarily offering in-person and virtual health risk assessments aimed at closing risk adjustment and quality gaps in care for their clients’ members. They were acquired by Providence Service Corporation (PRSC), now ModivCare, in 2014 for $400M, and still operate as Matrix Medical Network, fitting into ModivCare’s larger portfolio of US-focused social services companies reimbursed by government programs.\n\nMatrix provides a broad spectrum of services across four distinct lines of business, including Matrix Clinical Care (offers comprehensive home & virtual health assessments aimed at closing care gaps), Matrix Clinical Solutions (offers workplace health solutions from testing to clinical care), Matrix Clinical Trials (offers decentralized trial solutions), and Matrix Clinical Labs (offers diagnostic and clinical testing services via a CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory). For more than twenty years, the organization’s network of approximately five thousand clinical has met individuals wherever they are to assess their health and safety, identifying and closing care gaps in the process. Their core business model involves selling health assessments to government-sponsored health insurance companies or providers in value-based contracts to help improve revenue through accurate risk adjustment and quality reporting. The company also offers quality improvement programs (diabetes care intervention, corporate wellness, community assessments), chronic condition management (CCM), post-acute transitions, and worksite services to risk-bearing entities.\n\nRecently Matrix, in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic, launched a new employee health and wellness service for companies with critical operations still functioning during the pandemic. The program focuses on a multi-disciplinary approach for on-site assessments based on the latest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and state regulations, creation of protocols to address safety gaps, and continuous management of Covid-19 guidelines/regulations. Matrix rolled out these services with several notable recent partnership announcements, including: 1) a collaboration with Tyson Foods to deliver vaccination education and coordination; 2) a collaboration with Fenway Health to deploy mobile health clinics to participate in ongoing Covid-19 clinical trials; and 3) a collaboration with AstraZeneca to accelerate a clinical trial in the US for AZD7442, AstraZeneca's long-acting monoclonal antibody (LAAB) combination for the potential prevention of COVID-19 whereby Matrix Clinical Solutions will meet eligible volunteers where they live and work with a fleet of Mobile Health Clinics and skilled clinicians.\n\nWalt Cooper was the previous CEO who left in October 2019 before joining Precision Health Solutions as their new CEO. Mr. Cooper was replaced by Keith Henthorne, the previous founder of Auditz, LLC, a healthcare services organization that used sophisticated proprietary technology to help healthcare providers identify and recover payments, which was sold to TransUnion in 2016. Matrix’s parent company, ModivCare, desires to ramp up in-home and telehealth assessments as a core component of its business per a Q4 earnings call. There has been limited research from Matrix demonstrating their clinical impact, cost savings, or value-improvement at large; peer-reviewed journal articles are available from members of the network, including articles that discuss:\n\n1) early advanced care planning and anticipatory decision making as a strategy to improve managing uncertainty around common decisions;\n\n2) a day in the life of a Nurse Practitioner who performs in-home physical exams;\n\n3) the need for increased home-based primary care visits; and\n\n4) comprehensive foot care education in home-based settings\n\nSIGNIFY HEALTH\n\nSignify Health (Dallas, Tx) was founded in 2017, after a merger between CenseoHealth and Advance Health, to expand value-based care and tech-enabled provider capabilities with a focus on in-home health evaluations (IHEs) and complex care management. On February 11, 2021, Signify Health went public with their initial IPO (SGFY) at a valuation of $7.12B, raising $564M. Signify Health’s main business operations focus on selling various value-based and care coordination services to six main segments:\n\n1) Payors: Signify Health partners with health plans in risk-based arrangements to offer in-home health evaluation services, episodes of care programs, and clinical as well as social care coordination\n\n2) Providers: Signify Health partners with providers to offer episodes of care, transition to home, and clinical as well as social care coordination programs\n\n3) Employers: Signify Health partners with employers to implement episodes of care payment programs with guaranteed prices, better quality, and seamless coordination around sites of care for a wide range of conditions and procedures\n\n4) Biopharma: Signify Health partners with biopharma companies to provider support for running effective clinical trials and help commercialize their life-change therapies by bringing clinical and social services into the home\n\n5) Community Organizations: Signify Health partners with community-based organizations to help them safely collaborate with social service partners, as well as the broader health ecosystem, to improve the lives of the families they serve\n\n6) Health Plan Members: Signify Health helps keep individuals and families safe and healthy in their homes by supporting those that support them: their health plans, doctors, nurses, and social workers. .\n\nPer Signify Health’s S-1, as of early 2021, they served 47 Medicare Advantage plans as well as over 9,000 providers and 200 community-based organizations, offering their in-home evaluations and payment models around individual episodes of care (e.g., surgical care). Their S-1 also demonstrates that their “episode payment platform managed $6.1 billion of spend under the Medicare Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCI-A”) program in 2019, and the BPCI-A episodes we managed which were initiated in the last quarter of 2019 resulted in approximately 15% greater discharges home from acute-care facilities and approximately 10% lower readmissions when compared to the historical performance of our provider partners for similar episodes”. Risk factors identified for Signify Health in the IPO filing included risks that the COVID-19 pandemic may slow down the demand for and/or the ability to deliver in-home assessments as well as the risk that the company may be required to offer virtual assessments with reduced fees due to the pandemic.. As such, their business is reliant on attaining and retaining customers. They are trusting technological innovations to help them with this, such as their proprietary analytics and cloud-based software platforms.\n\nSignify Health proprietary platforms target IHEs primarily but also social care coordination and biopharma services (e.g., patient support platforms and clinical trials support). Their episodes of care services target Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced Model Participants (BPCI-A), commercial payors, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), transition to home model participants, and Chronic Care Management (CCM) companies. The company markets and sells several technologies, including, Episode Connect, which helps manage episodes of care programs, provide actionable insights, and use predictive analytics to identify risks.\n\nSince the creation of Signify Health, Kyle Armbrester has held the CEO role. Kyle came from AthenaHealth where he was SVP Chief Product Officer from 2011-2018. The company rapidly grew in 2020 and opening an additional 750 positions across its business. It is increasingly playing a role with pharma for remote study inclusion.\n\nCARECENTRIX\n\nCareCentrix was founded in 1996 and is based in East Hartford, CN. The company has several offerings across the care coordination and value-based care market segments. Their business operations are focused upon home health benefit management solutions for coordination of cost-effective care including post-acute, home nursing, infusion, sleep, respiratory, wound, and home medical equipment (DME) care. They have a network of 8,000 home healthcare providers across the US and manage 17.5M members. Through advanced analytics, the companies helps its health plan customers determine the appropriate site for post-acute care, and provides support and coordination for patients and their families throughout care transitions, including to and from Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) and through home health, home DME, home infusion, and home sleep services.\n\nSeveral CareCentrix proprietary platforms are focused on:\n\n1) creating Intelligent Pathways to guide patients to the ultimate site of care, or their homes.\n\n2) engaging patient and caregivers, coordinating care transitions, improving clinical outcomes, and doing all that they can to help patients health and age at home.\n\n3) continually finding new ways to break down the silos across the care continuum, capturing savings for their health plan clients along the way.\n\nCareCentrix’sHomeSTAR Program focuses on risk assessments, coaching, and care coordination based on protocol-driven interventions.

The Village Medical brand provides primary care for patients at traditional free-standing clinics, Walgreens co-located clinics, as well as in the home and via virtual visits through a proprietary technology solution.\n\nVillageMD, a subsidiary Village Medical, currently operates traditional free-standing clinics in highly accessible neighborhood locations, where patients and providers live and work.. In November 2019, Village Medical opened one of its first full-service, state-of-the-art primary care clinics co-located at Walgreens in Houston and has since opened more. Village Medical at Walgreens integrates the pharmacist as a critical member of VillageMD’s physician-led, multi-disciplinary team. This integrated model has never been more important—6 in 10 Americans today live with at least one chronic condition requiring multiple daily medications. Outside of their owned medical group, Village Medical, VillageMD also maintained a network of independent, affiliated primary care physicians that operate as partners for success in value-based healthcare under the VillageMD Affiliate Physicians subsidiary..

The company operates as a next generation, tech-forward primary care provider with advanced care coordination and value-based care workflow and program capabilities. Their business offerings focus on delivering senior care utilizing concierge-style, high-touch medicine, using their own medical, care management, and technology resources to differentiate. ChenMed has a specific strategic focus on serving Medicare patients, primarily contracting in risk-based models with private Medicare Advantage health plans. The company is currently in network with twenty Medicare Advantage health insurance plans. ChenMed’s value-based contracting model allows them to remain financially healthy in serving small patient panel sizes through higher tough care delivery models where other fee-for-service providers would likely struggle due to lower volumes..\n\nThe company operates under three principal brands, including Chen Senior Medical Care (FL), Dedicated Senior Medical Center (FL, OH, TN, PA, MO), and JenCare Senior Medical Center (GA, IL, KY, LA, VA). ChenMed’s three brand operations provide similar services for their members, albeit with differing providers. Services include primary care, onsite diagnostics testing, medications directly given to patients during visits, and door-to-door transportation. Due to the VBC approach, they staff separate medical specialists on-site, such as cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, dermatologists. Their care teams also includes social workers, skilled nursing and wound care providers, and acupuncturists and the company also offers pacemaker checks, imaging services (e.g., sonography, X-rays) and nuclear stress tests in their services. If care cannot be provided on-site, the medical team will coordinate the referral process. During the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, conduced 90% of their visits virtually using Sitka's video software platform for telemedicine. They initiated a strategy to keep in contact with their elderly patients and support them, using their branded Love Calls to help combat loneliness and isolation. Even during the ongoing pandemic, they have expanded, offering almost one hundred practice locations.\n\nChristopher Chen, MD has served as CEO of the company since 2009 and Gordon Chen, MD currently serves as CMO. Both of their spouses also maintain leadership roles across the company. The Chen family has been highly involved in academic research and is closely involved with the University of Miami. They have collaborated to publish several peer-reviewed studies. One such 2018 study highlights the value of ChenMed’s high-touch primary care model, demonstrating $87 per member per month in total medical costs for Medicare Advantage (MA) patients in the ChenMed model versus $121 per member per month for similar MA patients in a traditional PCP model. These results are staggering, especially given higher utilization of primary care visits & preventive medications for patients in the ChenMed model versus the standard PCP program that ChenMed was compared to. The same study also showed reduced hospital admissions from ChenMed’s programs versus ‘traditional primary care’. More recently, ChenMed evaluated the use of both Propeller Health electronic medication monitors (EMMs) to monitor short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) use and as well as a smartphone app to track use trends and receive feedback from COPD patients. The pilot demonstrated a significant reduction in SABA use and increased SABA-free days among Medicare-eligible COPD patients. Further, patients readily adopted the digital platform and demonstrated strong engagement and retention rates at 6 and 12 months. It is not clear whether or not ChenMed continues to employ Propeller Health’s digital health tools in caring for their COPD patients (they probably do); however, it is encouraging that ChenMed takes an academic approach to validating the impact of technologies on patient outcomes and costs before scaling them out. From the two studies that were reviewed in this article, it is clear that ChenMed has found success in using technology and new clinical programs to achieve high-value healthcare for their patients.\n\nSTEADYMD\n\nSteadyMD is a relatively new health startup focused on delivering a modern approach to primary care. Their doctors only see a limited number of patients so they can spend more time with each.

SteadyMD focuses on offering preventative care services, such as labs, screenings, urgent care, chronic condition management, and primary care medicine. If a SteadyMD provider thinks a patient needs to be seen directly for testing, referrals are made to a local specialist, urgent care facility or testing lab (e.g., Quest, LabCorp). Their clinical services cover pediatric medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, and functional medicine with each appointment spanning an hour in length if needed. Members can set up appointments for same-day needs and can chat via text with their provider on-demand.

With the onset of the pandemic, Oak Street expanded their telehealth services and used their vans to transport food to impacted patients at risk of going hungry.\n\nOak Street Health originally started taking on Medicare patients via fee-for-service contacts but transitioned to primarily value-based contracts via Humana in the mid-2010s. The company produced revenues of $556M in 2019. Oak Street Health PCPs managed care for 85K patients as of March 2020 with two-thirds under capitation-based and/or at-risk agreements. As most of their revenue is tied to VBC contracts, the pandemic has not impacted their operations as much as fee-for-service providers were impacted by reduced volumes.\n\nOak Street has not published any peer-evaluated studies regarding their impact; the company claims in their S-1 IPO filing that they have cut hospitalizations and ED visits by 50% for their patient population. The company has achieved significant revenue all while spending significant cash to fund capital expansions.\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\nRuss Cobb, VP Enterprise Technology Marketing\n\nTrey Rawles, Director Market Intelligence (Emerging Technologies)\n\nLaura Griffith, VP Market Intelligence\n\nAs of 2021, Change Healthcare is powering nine of out of the twelve leading value-based care and care coordination companies profiled in this report through a variety of solutions, including but not limited to: 1) Payment Accuracy; 2) Medical Network; 3) Decision Support; 4) Rx Benefit Admin; 5) VBC Transformation Services; 6) Value-Based Payments Analytics; 7) Communications & Payments\n\nTo learn how your value-based care, care coordination, or tech-enabled provider organization can leverage Change Healthcare data & workflows in ways like digital health pioneers are, please send me a direct message on LinkedIn to discuss strategic partnerships.\n\nABOUT CHANGE HEALTHCARE\n\nChange Healthcare (Nasdaq: CHNG) is a leading independent healthcare technology company, focused on accelerating the transformation of the healthcare system through the power of the Change Healthcare Platform.
