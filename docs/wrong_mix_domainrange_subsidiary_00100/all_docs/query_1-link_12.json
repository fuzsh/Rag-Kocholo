        "text": "System-on-a-chip solution provider National Semiconductor Corp. (Santa Clara, CA) has received company-wide quality certification to the QS-9000 standard.\n\nDet Norske Veritas (DNV; Oslo, Norway), an internationally recognized and accredited quality certification organization, confirmed the certification. QS-9000 assessors from DNV inspected National's five manufacturing sites as well as the company's corporate headquarters to assure that all of its operations and procedures meet the stringent requirements set forth in the QS-9000 documentation.\n\nThe QS-9000 certification is an outgrowth of the international ISO-9000 certification, which National already achieved, but goes beyond that standard to assess actual performance to rigid quality specifications that emphasize continuous quality process improvement and close working relationships with customers."
