        "text": "Our Standard Marine Consoles have been designed to meet today's needs for a compact, open architecture, human-machine interface workstation. The heart of the console is a PC or VME formal computer situated in the console base. Using industry standard formats allows for easy adoption of new computer technologies during the ships life-cycle.\n\nThe console is a modular design allowing multi-console configurations to be readily assembled. A range of connection segments are available that allow unique configurations to be develped to suit customer needs. These segments may also be used to house traditional insturmentation or communications equipment. Our systems engineering staff works with the customer to achieve the optimum design integration for the application. The console's light weight and compact size make it ideal for upgrade and backfit applications where traditional operator consoles are being replaced. The single screen console is completely deck-mounted while the dual screen configuration requires the fitting of a top brace. The console can be completely installed and mainained from the front allowing the unit to be installed close to bulkheads, freeing up space in congested compartments.\n\nFeatures:\n\nCompact ergonomic design\n\nLight weight\n\nFront access\n\nPC or VME processor options\n\nUS Navy MIL SPEC compliant using COTS equipment\n\nDual monitor configuration available\n\nAdvanced Modular Construction:\n\nLightweight - Aluminum and composite materials\n\nCompact size - Easily fits into small/congested compartments\n\nAdaptable - Provisions for hosting traditional controls and instrumentation\n\nModular design - Permits multiple-bay console workstation to be assembled\n\nShock Qualified\n\nSpecification:\n\nColor display- High resolution (1600x1200/UXGA), 20.1\" LCD\n\nInput devices - Standard keyboard and 2\"/50mm trackball\n\nProcessor - PC or 6U VME format\n\nSound - 2W speaker\n\nNetwork - Two or more 10/100/1000Mbps copper or fiber optic ethernet ports\n\nOptions Available:\n\nTouch screen\n\nHardwired emergency stop push-buttons\n\nExternal shock mounts\n\nColor to customer specificatios\n\nLCD upgrade to 23\" (1920x1080 / full HD)\n\nElectrical Charteristics:\n\nPower consumption: 300W typ\n\nVoltage: per NATO STANAG 1008 limits - 24 VDC nominal; or 115/230 VAC, 50/60 Hz\n\nDimensions and Weight:\n\nHeight: 1.4m (55\")\n\nWidth: 0.7m (28\")\n\nDepth: 1.0m (39\")\n\nWeight: 170kg (375 lb.)\n\nEnvironmental Characteristics:\n\nOperating temperature: 0oC to +50oC\n\nNon-operating temperature: -20oC to +70oC\n\nHumidity: up to 95% R.H. condensing\n\nVibration: MIL-STD-167-1, 4-25 Hz\n\nShock with isolators: MIL-S-901D Grade A, Class II\n\nShock without isolators: 15g\n\nEnclsoure degree of protection: IP 23\n\nEMI: MIL-STD-461E for surface ships\n\nReliability:\n\nMTTR < 30 minutes (front access)\n\nMTBF > 6,600 hours\n\nQualification:\n\nMIL-STD-167-1 (Vibration)\n\nMIL-S-901D (Shock)\n\nMIL-STD-461E (EMI)\n\nMIL-STD-810F (Temperature and Humidity)"
