        "text": "EAC/Marine was born to automation and M2M (machine-to-machine) applications. This EAC Box PCs are essentially embedded fanless PCs configured for a various application of processing and input / output (I/O) control task.\n\nIt combines different processor with extensive and flexible I/O support both for connection requiring RS232/422/485 serial ports with isolation and auto-direction function, as well as digital I/O Ports, standard USB connections and gigabit ethernet. Good thermal engineering means no fan and therefore no ventilation holes.\n\nFeatures :\n\nIntel Atom Dual Core D2550-1.86GHz\n\nDesign for industrial automation\n\nMachine-to-machine application\n\nRobust aluminium housing for anti-shock and vibration\n\nFanless design\n\nHigh-efficiency thermal design w/ seal construction\n\n1.5 KV DC power isolation-resistance\n\nDNV Certified\n\nIntel Atom Dual Core D2550 1.86 GHz processor, RS232/422/485 serial ports with isolation and auto-direction function, two RJ45 Gigabit and GPIO fulfilling the most of demands. Our controllers feature fanless design for high-efficiency thermal conduction without ventilation holes, robust aluminium housings for anti-shock and vibration, and power isolation-resistance solutions. Our Marine Box PC can also be used in vehicles, stationary, and in harsh and outdoor environments.\n\nAs a result, Winmate provides all of Panel PC products with DNV Certification (Det Norske Veritas), the Norwegian foundation internationally certifying materials, components and systems relevant to safe operation and quality of ships."
