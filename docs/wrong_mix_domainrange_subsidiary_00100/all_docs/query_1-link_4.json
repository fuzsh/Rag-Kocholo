        "text": "Norwegian multinational semiconductors manufacturer\n\nNordic Semiconductor ASA (formerly known as Nordic VLSI) was founded in 1983 and is a Norwegian fabless technology company with its headquarters in Trondheim, Norway. The company specializes in designing ultra-low-power wireless communication semiconductors and supporting software for engineers developing and manufacturing Internet of Things (IoT) products.\n\nThe company's primary SoC and SiP hardware products support wireless technologies, protocols, and standards like Bluetooth LE and BLE mesh, Wi-Fi, Thread, Zigbee, Matter, LTE-M and NB-IoT, KNX IoT, as well as the 5G standard technology DECT NR+ and 2.4 GHz ISM band communication. nRF Connect SDK (software development kit) integrates Zephyr RTOS and lets developers build size-optimized software.\n\nEnd-user applications and products include consumer electronics; wireless headphones and LE audio gear; wireless mobile phone accessories (\"Appcessories\"); wireless gamepad, mouse, and keyboard; intelligent sports equipment; wireless medical and healthcare; remote control; wireless voice-audio applications (e.g., voice over IP); security; wireless navigation hardware; and toys. In addition, industrial and commercial IoT applications include health, asset tracking, metering (gas/water/electricity), smart home and building automation.[4]\n\nNordic Semiconductor has been ISO 9001 certified by Det Norske Veritas (DNV) since 1996, and the certificate was upgraded to ISO 9001-2000 in 2001. In 1996, Nordic Semiconductor was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange's SME list.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNordic Semiconductor was initially founded in 1983 as Nordic VLSI (NVLSI) in Trondheim, Norway by four post-graduates from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Initially, the company focused on the design of mixed-signal application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) within the Nordic region. In 1996, the firm went public on the Norwegian stock exchange, where it still trades as of 2023 .\n\nIn 1998, NVLSI released its first wireless standard products in the 433 MHz ISM band. In 2003 NVLSI was renamed Nordic Semiconductor, often known as Nordic Semi, to reflect the company's focus on ultra-low-power wireless devices. The same year saw the release of Nordic Semiconductor's first wireless devices at 2.4 GHz. Since 2003, Nordic Semiconductor has maintained a clear focus on wireless products for the 2.4 GHz band and has seen its devices used in a wide range of branded consumer electronic products.[citation needed]\n\nNordic Semiconductor products support short-range low-power wireless through Bluetooth LE, Thread, Zigbee, and proprietary 2.4 GHz protocols; and low-power cellular IoT through LTE-M and NB-IoT.\n\n2012 saw the release of the third generation of ultra-low-power wireless products. This family of products is named the nRF51 series, and incorporates the ARM Cortex-M series microcontrollers at their core.[5]\n\nIn 2015 Nordic Semiconductor introduced new 2.4 GHz ISM band SoC series, the nRF52 Series with ARM Cortex-M4 as their core.[6]\n\nIn January 2018, Nordic Semiconductor introduced its first cellular product, the nRF91 series.[7] With the nRF9160 system in a package (SiP), the company expanded from Bluetooth LE and short-range radio applications into cellular network solutions. The main focus is on cellular IoT by supporting LTE-M and NB-IoT.\n\nIn November 2019, Nordic Semiconductor introduced a flagship SoC containing dual-core ARM Cortex-M33 processors and a multi-protocol radio stack (NFC/BLE/BLE mesh/Zigbee/Thread/others), the nRF53 series.[8]\n\nIn 2022, Nordic Semiconductor unveiled a low-power, dual-band Wi-Fi 6 companion chip, the nRF70 Series. ICs compatible with the nRF7002 include the nRF52 and nRF53 Bluetooth SoCs and the nRF91 cellular SiP, although Nordic claims that the device can also be used with non-Nordic host devices.[9]\n\nIn August 2023, it was announced Nordic Semiconductor had entered into an agreement to acquire the IP portfolio of San Diego-headquartered artificial intelligence and machine learning company, Atlazo.[10]\n\nIn October 2023, Nordic Semiconductor announced the second product, nRF54L Series, in its fourth generation of Bluetooth® Low Energy Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) family, the nRF54.[11]\n\nIn December 2023, Nordic Semiconductor announced that after 22 years at the helm, Sven-Torre will step down from the role of CEO. He will be replaced by Vegard Woollan,[12] the co-inventor of the AVR microcontroller architecture.\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nNordic Semiconductor designs and produces SoC, SiP, and connectivity solutions for the ISM bands at 5 GHz, 2.4 GHz and 868/915 MHz bands. The products operate on low power, enabling wireless and IoT applications to use little battery and run on harvested energy.[13]\n\nCurrent products[when?] include SoCs incorporating the ARM Cortex-M0, ARM Cortex-M4[14] and ARM Cortex-M33[15] microcontroller cores.\n\nPopular products include the nRF24L01+ and the nRF24LE1, both using the lightweight and proprietary \"Enhanced ShockBurst\" protocol stack in 2.4 GHz ISM band. The nRF24L01+ is a simple transceiver with some logic to implement the protocol stack and is connected to a microcontroller via an SPI bus, while the nRF24LE1 can be seen as an nRF24L01 and a microcontroller in the same chip.'\n\nCellular IoT\n\n[edit]\n\nnRF91 Series SiP\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nRF9160 SiP expanded Nordic Semiconductor's lineup from mainly focusing on Bluetooth LE and other short range wireless protocol SoCs into the realm of connected devices using the cellular network for internet connectivity. The series offers LTE-M and NB-IoT connectivity.[16]\n\nWi-Fi\n\n[edit]\n\nnRF70 Series\n\n[edit]\n\nA Wi-Fi companion IC is designed to provide Wi-Fi connectivity and functionality to existing Nordic products. Unlike other Nordic solutions, the first product, nRF7002, is strictly for connectivity.\n\nMulti-protocol\n\n[edit]\n\nnRF54 Series SoC\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nRF54 Series SoC makes it possible to reduce BOM, replacing external components through a highly integrated SoC with multiple ARM_Cortex-M#Cortex-M33 processors running up to 320 MHz in conjunction with RISC-V coprocessors. nRF54H20 touts efficient processing, ultra-low power radio, and minimal sleep currents, multiprotocol radio with 10 dBm TX power, -100 dBm RX sensitivity for Bluetooth LE and -104 dBm for 802.15.4., PSA Level 3 certification, secure boot, secure firmware update, secure storage, and protection against physical attacks. In EEMBC ULPMark-CM benchmarking, configured for maximum processing efficiency, the nRF54H20 scores 170 with 515 CoreMark.[17] Configured for maximum processing performance, the nRF54H20 scores 132 with 1290 CoreMark.[18] Compared to the nRF54H Series' GlobalFoundries 22FDX® (22 nm) process, nRF54L Series features a new hardware architecture fabricated using TSMC’s 22ULL® (22 nm) process technology.[19]\n\nnRF53 Series SoC\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nRF5340 SoC is the world's first dual-core ARM Cortex-M33 SoC (128MHz + 64MHz), released in 2020. This is Nordic's new generation of wireless SoCs with a separate processor core to handle connectivity, thus freeing up resources for handling more demanding applications on the main processor's core without compromising on the connectivity.[20]\n\nnRF52 Series SoCs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nRF52 Series SoCs was the second short-range wireless SoCs from Nordic Semiconductor, building on their experience developing the nRF51 Series. The nRF52 series, especially the nRF52840 and nRF52833, is very successful and exists in millions of popular consumer devices in the world today, among them wireless mice, keyboards and audio devices. The popularity of Nordic's nRF52 series allows Nordic Semiconductor to maintain a 40% worldwide market share in the Bluetooth LE segment.[21]\n\nThe nRF52833 SoC features a 64 MHz ARM Cortex-M4. This SoC supports an extended temperature range of -40˚C to 105˚C. The SoC has a 1:4 RAM to Flash storage ratio (128 KB : 512 KB). Being a wireless-focused chip, the nRF52833 is equipped with an output power of +8 dBm.[22]\n\nnRF51 Series SoCs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nRF51 Series SoCs was the first short-range wireless SoC series from Nordic Semiconductor; it was superseded by the nRF52 Series SoCs.\n\nPower management (nPM)\n\n[edit]\n\nDedicated Power Management ICs (PMIC) can achieve better performance and efficiency, and handle higher load capacities than smaller manufacturing processes and internal regulators. nPM Series supports power management, battery charging, and state-of-charge prediction using integrated battery current, voltage, and temperature measurements for precision estimation.\n\nRange extenders (nRF21)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe transmit (TX) output power and the receiver sensitivity directly influence the link budget of a connection. An RF front-end module (FEM) increases the range at which two wireless devices can communicate while enhancing link robustness. nRF21540 RF FEM can boost wireless range up to 10x.\n\nCloud services\n\n[edit]\n\nnRF Cloud is a platform for IoT cloud services for the nRF Series of wireless devices, including location services and Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA).\n\nDevelopment software\n\n[edit]\n\nnRF Connect SDK is a software development kit for the nRF Series of wireless devices. [23]\n\nWireless technologies and protocols\n\n[edit]\n\nNordic Semiconductor provides hardware and software for several wireless technologies and protocols.[24]\n\nCellular IoT (LTE-M/NB-IoT)[25]\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices use existing cellular networks, such as those used for mobile phones, to communicate over long distances and through walls and other barriers with greater flexibility and coverage than other wireless communication technologies.\n\nDECT NR+[26]\n\nDECT Next Generation is an evolution of the DECT standard that allows any company or organization to build its own private 5G network and run and optimize as they wish.\n\nWi-Fi[27]\n\nBy maximizing Wi-Fi’s low-power potential, Wi-Fi can be introduced in applications such as sensor networks, smart speakers, security cameras, home appliances, robot vacuums, and more.\n\nBluetooth Low Energy[28]\n\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless personal area network technology designed for use with low-power devices.\n\nBluetooth LE Audio[29]\n\nA new Bluetooth audio standard designed to reduce power consumption and improve the performance and functionality of Bluetooth audio devices such as wireless headphones and speakers.\n\nBluetooth Direction Finding[30]\n\nBluetooth Mesh[31]\n\nMatter for smart home applications[32]\n\nMatter uses Thread, Wi-Fi, Ethernet and Bluetooth LE to make it possible for developers to create secure and interoperable products for the major smart home ecosystems.\n\nThread[33]\n\nZigbee[34]\n\nANT+\n\n2.4 GHz proprietary\n\nAmazon Sidewalk[35]\n\nApple Find My network[36]\n\nIndustry associations\n\n[edit]\n\nNordic Semiconductor is a member of the ANT+ Alliance, Bluetooth Special Interest Group, KNX Association[1], Thread Group[2], Connectivity Standards Alliance[3], Wi-Fi Alliance, GSMA[4], and the Zephyr Project[5].\n\nNordic Semiconductor has announced a collaboration with Qualcomm, NXP, Bosch and Infineon, to launch a joint company focused on RISC-V.[37]\n\nClones\n\n[edit]\n\nSome clones of Nordic Semiconductor's chips can be found on the market, such as the SI24R1[38][39] and the BK2421.[40] They often demonstrate inferior receiver sensitivity and higher power consumption, although they may add additional features such as higher maximal transmission power.[citation needed]\n\nLocations\n\n[edit]\n\nNordic Semiconductor is headquartered in Trondheim, Norway.
