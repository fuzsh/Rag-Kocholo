        "text": "Modulight announced recently a set of single-emitter based OEM laser systems ideal for medical and industrial applications. The sub-systems produce up to 1.5 W optical power and cover most of the conventional wavelengths between 635 nm and 1550 nm. Standard configuration is based on Modulight Butterfly module line-up options and includes integrated laser driver, controller, cooling, and external modulation interface. Customizable options include, but are not limited to, wavelength, power, and output specification, control interface, form factor, and various operating parameters.\n\nCurrently the following wavelengths and maximum powers are offered with standard configurations:\n\n635 nm, 500mW;\n\n650/665 nm, 750 mW;\n\n808 nm, 1.5 W;\n\n940/980 nm, 1.5 W;\n\n1470/1550 nm, 500 mW.\n\n'We are excited about this new release. This is clearly yet another way for us to lower the threshold of using our lasers. By presenting a standard OEM system level platform for single-emitter lasers, our customers benefit from existing versatile design, in-house customization capability from chip to system level, and very large wavelength range from 630nm to 1650nm. We have supplied a number of custom OEM systems already for a few years, but we believe that a standard solution will enable larger customer base within equipment manufacturer market. The OEM systems have been designed to enable simple integration interface both mechanically and electrically.' comments Sampsa Kuusiluoma, Modulight's Product Line Manager for Integrated Laser Solutions.\n\nAbout Modulight, Inc.\n\nModulight, Inc. provides value-added solutions to optical applications for industrial, communication, medical, space, and defense industries. Modulight products include various types of lasers from visible to infrared wavelengths with output power levels from milliwats to over hundreds of watts. Modulight provides also laser solutions from design and manufacturing of laser diodes to OEM-based optical sub-systems and turnkey laser systems. Modulight owns and operates a semiconductor fab in Tampere, Finland and has fully owned subsidiary Modulight USA located in San Jose, California."
