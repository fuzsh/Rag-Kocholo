By clicking \"Accept\" you consent to our use of cookies.\n\nFrom Michelle (Robinson) Obamaâs childhood in the South Shore community through Barack Obamaâs years of teaching at the University of Chicago Law School, and their historic 2008 election night celebration in Grant Park, The Barack Obama Foundation story starts in Chicago.\n\nMrs. Obama, then Michelle Robinson, grew up in a two-story house on Euclid Avenue in Chicagoâs South Shore community, and attended elementary school down the street. Her father, Fraser, was a city pump operator and a Democratic precinct captain. Her mother, Marian, was a secretary at the Spiegel catalog, who later stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother, Craig.\n\nThe years (1985-1988) President Obama spent working as a community organizer on the South Side were âthe best education I ever had,â he recalls. As the executive director of the Developing Communities Project (DCP) in the Roseland neighborhood, Obama helped set up a job training program, a college-prep tutoring program, and a tenantsâ rights organization in the Altgeld Gardens housing projects.\n\nIn 1989, President Obama took a summer internship at a top Chicago law firm, Sidley &amp; Austin, where a young associate named Michelle Robinson was assigned to be his adviser and show him around. He remembers, \"I asked her out. She refused. I kept asking. She kept refusing. Finally, I offered to quit my job, and at last she relented.\"\n\nBarack Obama taught on the University of Chicago Law School faculty for 12 years until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004. Michelle Obama provided leadership in several senior administrative roles at the University and its medical center.\n\nIn October 3, 1992 Barack and Michelle Obama celebrated their wedding day at the South Shore Cultural Center. Of President Obama's vows on that day, Mrs. Obama remembers: \"Barack didn't pledge riches, only a life that would be interesting. On that promise he delivered.\"\n\n1992 was an election year, and Barack Obama became the director of Illinois Project Vote!, an organization focused on registering minority voters. That year, a huge turnout among African Americans forever altered Chicagoâs electoral landscape, and a 31-year-old lawyer became a rising political star.\n\nThe State of Illinois elected Barack Obama to the Illinois State Senate in November 1996. He became a leading legislator on a wide range of issues, passing nearly 300 bills aimed at helping children, the elderly, labor unions, and the poor.\n\nâ I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible.â\n\nâThen Illinois State Senator Barack Obama, 2004\n\nSenator Barack Obama, stood on the steps of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois on February 10, 2007 and declared his candidacy for President of the United States. Next to him on that day were his wife, Michelle, and daughters, Sasha and Malia. He told listeners that day, ââ¦ this campaign canât only be about me. It must be about us â it must be about what we can do together.â\n\nâ So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.â\n\nâPresident-elect Barack Obama, November 2008\n\nâ This is the highlight in Chicagoâs history to have the first African American president hail from Chicago and have a president from Chicago. Itâs the first time since John F. Kennedy that a president comes from an urban community like ours. Thatâs a long way. We donât have to educate him about all the urban problems. He knows them all first hand.â\n\nâMayor Richard Daley, November 2008\n\nâ Tonight in the election, you the American people reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come.â\n\nâPresident Barack Obama, November 2012"
