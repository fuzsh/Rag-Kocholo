        "text": "Former first lady Michelle Obama revealed this month she “couldn’t stand” ex-President Barack Obama for about a decade when the couple’s two daughters were young.\n\nDuring a roundtable interview with Revolt TV, Michelle discussed the challenges of raising two young daughters as the power couple was advancing their careers — and the strain it put on the marriage.\n\n“We don’t talk about how much work is required and how hard it is even when you are madly in love with the person, even when everything works out right,” she said.\n\n“People think I’m being catty by saying this: It’s like, there were 10 years where I couldn’t stand my husband. And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.”\n\nMichelle conveyed the tough balance between raising the girls while ­dealing with their own hectic schedules.\n\n“And for 10 years while we’re trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who’s doing what and what, I was like, ‘Ugh, this isn’t even,’ ” she explained.\n\n“And guess what? Marriage isn’t 50/50, ever, ever.\n\n“There are times I’m 70, he’s 30. There are times he’s 60, 40, but guess what: 10 years — we’ve been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30 — it’s just how you look at it. And people give up … ‘five years; I can’t take it.’ ”\n\nMalia and Sasha Obama were 10 and 7, respectively, when their father was elected president.\n\n“Little kids, they’re terrorists. They have demands. They don’t talk. They’re poor communicators. They cry all the time,” she said.\n\n“They’re irrational. They’re needy. And you love them. And so you can’t blame them, right? … So you turn that ire on each other.”\n\nThroughout the ups and downs, the former first lady suggested she still respected and admired her spouse. She stressed it’s important to know “your person.”\n\n“Do you like him? I mean you could be mad at him, but do you still look at him and go, ‘I’m not happy with you, but I respect you,’ ” she said. “ ‘I don’t agree with you, but you’re still a kind, smart person.’ ”\n\nMichelle has been promoting her second book, “The Light We Carry,” which was published in November.\n\nWhile speaking about the book last month, she said she felt pressure to wear her hair straight.\n\nMichelle said Americans “weren’t ready” for her natural hair, as they were still “getting adjusted” to having a black first family in the White House.\n\n“They tripped out when Barack wore a tan suit,” she added, recalling the controversy he faced in 2014 when he sported the unusual-for-a-president duds.\n\nThe Obamas have raked in millions from book deals and appearances. Their net worth is estimated to be at least $70 million.\n\nThe couple signed a joint deal in 2017 for their memoirs for about $65 million.\n\nThey also cut a production deal with Netflix estimated to be worth around $50 million."
