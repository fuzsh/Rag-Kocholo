        "text": "Seven years after leaving the White House, Michelle Obama (60) is opening up about her emotional transition, sharing how she found a sense of happiness and freedom.\n\nIn a candid podcast with her friend, Melinda French Gates, the former American first lady described the strange yet liberating period following her and former president Barack Obama's departure.\n\n“You take the final helicopter ride, our very last ride on Air Force One. We took a quick vacation to Palm Springs, so the day after we were out of [Washington] DC, we were in another place so it felt like we were on vacation, but then when we came back to our new home, it was odd,” she said.\n\n“It was odd coming down a different street and parking through a different set of barricades – because we still had barricades, we still had Secret Service,” she added\n\nREAD MORE | This is how Michelle and Barack Obama continue to make money\n\nThe Obamas entered the White House in 2009 and departed in 2017 after the end of Barack's second term.\n\n“We made the decision to stay in Washington, because the girls were in school and their lives were in DC,” Michelle said.\n\nThough she still had certain privileges, such as protection from the Secret Service, Michelle says she had to adapt to a new, more ordinary life, which she welcomed.\n\n“I had a front door that I could open where people would walk up to visit and ring the doorbell.\"\n\nREAD MORE | Michelle Obama opens up about the weight gain and hot flushes of menopause: ‘It was like somebody put a furnace in my core’\n\nMichelle also discussed the challenges of raising her daughters, Malia (26) and Sasha (23), under the scrutiny of the public eye. She emphasised that one of the most important lessons she wanted to teach them was the ability to stand up for themselves.\n\n“They are watched. They had to learn how to balance the unwanted attention, but do it politely. To build their own lives in the spotlight and not be eaten up by it,” she said."
