        "text": "[2013: Opening remarks while presenting the Academy Award for Best Picture] These nine movies took us back in time and all around the world. They made us laugh, they made us weep, they made us grip our armrest a little tighter. They taught us that love can endure against all odds and transform our lives in the most surprising ways. And they reminded us that we can overcome any obstacle if we work hard enough, and dig deep enough, and find the courage in ourselves. These lessons apply to all of us, no matter who we are, or what we look like, or where we come from, or who we love, but they are especially important for our young people. Every day, through engagement in the arts our children learn to open their imaginations, to dream just a little bigger, and to strive every day to reach those dreams. And I want to thank all of you tonight, for being here to fulfill that vitally important work.\n\n[a special Thanksgiving thought, 2013] Miiitary families don't complain. They're proud of their service and more than willing to make the sacrifices that come with it. And no matter how tough it gets, because they're so strong and resilient they somehow keep everything together. They succeed in their jobs, run their households and even find time to serve their communities. So I'm feeling tremendously thankful and I hope you'll join me in working to serve them as well as they've served our country."
