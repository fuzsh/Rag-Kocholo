        "text": "Barack Obama gushed over his “beautiful” and “funny” wife, Michelle, on their 31st wedding anniversary.\n\n“Happy anniversary, sweetheart! @MichelleObama,” the former president, 62, wrote on social media alongside a rare personal photo of the pair standing together in front of a large field.\n\nHe went on to call Michelle, 59, “brilliant, kind, funny, and beautiful.”\n\n“I’m lucky to call you mine,” he added.\n\nMichelle also celebrated the Oct. 3 occasion with a separate post showing the longtime couple smiling in front of a city backdrop.\n\n“31 years, and a lifetime to go,” the “Becoming” author captioned the casual pic. “I love going through life with you by my side, @BarackObama. Happy anniversary, honey! ❤️.”\n\nThe couple — who share two daughters, Malia, 25, and Sasha, 22 — tied the knot in 1992 at the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.\n\nDespite their gushy messages, Michelle has been open about navigating the ups and downs of marriage.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nSpeaking at a Revolt TV panel in December 2022, the former first lady admitted that she “couldn’t stand” her husband, for the first 10 years of their marriage because she was shouldering most of the domestic duties.\n\n“People think I’m being catty saying this. It’s like, there were 10 years where I couldn’t stand my husband,” she confessed. “And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.”\n\nMichelle explained that her feelings turned to “ire” when Barack managed to find time to play golf or travel for work while she attempted to balance her career as a lawyer while being a mother.\n\n“And for 10 years, while we’re trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who’s doing what and what, I was like, ‘Ugh, this isn’t even,’” she recalled.\n\n“And guess what? Marriage isn’t 50/50 — ever. There’s sometimes I’m 70, he’s 30, but guess what? We’ve been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30.”\n\nThe couple was last spotted together in early September at the US Open in Queens, NY."
