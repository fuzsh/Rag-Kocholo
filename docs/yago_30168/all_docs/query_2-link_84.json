        "text": "Barack and Michelle Obama, the former First couple, have given each other a warm tribute in celebration of their 31st wedding anniversary.\n\n“Happy anniversary, sweetheart!” the former POTUS wrote own Instagram under a photo of him and Michelle both wearing blue. “@MichelleObama, you’re brilliant, kind, funny and beautiful — and I’m lucky to call you mine.”\n\nAdditionally, the former First Lady also shouted out her husband, saying, “31 years, and a lifetime to go. I love going through life with you by my side, @BarackObama. Happy anniversary, honey!\n\nLast year, the pair celebrated their 30th anniversary by sharing memorable photos from over the years.\n\nBarack shared a carousel of images, including a black and white flick of him and his bride smiling and embracing each other. He also showed the two of them near rocky hills as he posed with his head on her shoulder, as well as their names written in the sand.\n\n“Miche, After 30 years, I’m not sure why you look exactly the same and I don’t,” he jokingly captioned the Instagram post at the time. “I do know that I won the lottery that day — that I couldn’t have asked for a better life partner. Happy anniversary, sweetheart!\n\nAccording to The Obamas, the couple married in 1992 after three years of dating. They first met in Chicago when Michelle was assigned to mentor Barack during his summer internship at a law firm.\n\nMichelle opened up a bit about her marriage to Barack in her 2022 book The Light We Carry. In the novel, the 59-year-old admitted that the couple has endured some challenging times not only as a couple, but as parents to their two daughters, Sasha and Malia.\n\n“People often reach out to me seeking relationship advice,” she wrote. “They ask how we have managed to stay both married and unmiserable for 30 years now. I want to say, ‘Yes, truly, it’s a surprise to us, too, sometimes!’ And really, I’m not joking. We have our issues, of course, but I love the man, and he loves me now, still, and seemingly forever.”\n\nShe added, “Our love is not perfect, but it’s real and we’re committed to it.”\n\nThe Let’s Move! creator also spoke on the challenges of raising two growing daughters while living in The White House, to which Barack further addressed while visiting CBS Mornings in May.\n\n“When our girls were growing up, that was priority number one, two, three, and four,” he explained. “And so, I did not fully appreciate, I think, as engaged of a father as I was, the degree of stress and tension for her [Michelle], knowing that not just me and Michelle were under scrutiny and in this strange environment, but that we were raising our daughters in a kind of situation that just wasn’t normal.”\n\nHe added, “Let me just say this: it sure helps to be out of the White House. And to have a little more time with her.”\n\nHappy Anniversary to The Obamas!"
