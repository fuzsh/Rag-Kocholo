        "text": "Credit: Gotham/GC Images/Getty Images\n\nBarack Obama and Michelle Obama: A Timeline of Their Relationship\n\nWhen Michelle Obama met Barack Obama in 1989 at the Chicago law firm where they both worked, it was not exactly love at first sight — even though he was quite popular around the office. “In my experience, you put a suit on any half-intelligent Black man and white people tended to go bonkers,” Michelle wrote in her 2018 memoir, Becoming. “I was doubtful he’d earned the hype.” Barack, on the other hand, was infatuated from the very beginning. He repeatedly asked Michelle out, but she rebuffed him multiple times before finally agreeing. The couple went on their first date that summer and tied the knot in 1992. Michelle and Barack welcomed daughters Malia and Sasha in 1998 and 2001, respectively. The Obama family’s lives changed forever in 2008 when Barack was elected as the 44th president of the United States. He entered office in 2009, and began his second term in 2013. Although his presidency came to an end in 2017, Barack’s relationship with Michelle has continued to fascinate fans.

This year, while we appreciate all your well-wishes, what we’d really love is for each of you to reach out to one person in your life who might not vote. Help them get registered. Help them make a plan to cast their ballot. Send them to iwillvote.com to get started. Happy anniversary, Miche. Love you.\"\n\nMichelle shared her own tribute to her husband on Instagram, writing, \"28 years with this one. I love @BarackObama for his smile, his character, and his compassion. So grateful to have him as a partner through everything life throws at us. And this year, we have a request for you — pick one person in your life who might not vote and make sure they do. … Love you, Barack.\"\n\nCredit: Charles Dharapak/AP/Shutterstock\n\nNovember 2020\n\nBarack opened up to Gayle King in an interview for CBS Sunday Morning in November 2020 about why fans won’t see him “suddenly” working at the White House with President-elect Joe Biden. “There are probably some things I would not be doing, because Michelle would leave me,” he joked when asked if he would serve in Biden’s cabinet. “She’d be like, ‘What? You’re doing what?’” The former president explained that he is “mindful of the sacrifices” his wife made while he was serving as head of state. He added: “The good news is that for whatever reason, she has forgiven me … sort of. She still reminds me, occasionally, of what she put up with.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Barack Obama/Instagram\n\nOctober 2022\n\nThe Becoming author shared a throwback photo from her wedding day as the pair marked 30 years of marriage. \"Happy anniversary to the man I love! These last 30 years have been an adventure, and I'm grateful to have you by my side. Here's to a lifetime together. I love you, @BarackObama! ❤️😘,\" she gushed via Instagram.\n\nBarack penned an anniversary tribute of his own, writing: \"Miche, After 30 years, I'm not sure why you look exactly the same and I don't. I do know that I won the lottery that day—that I couldn't have asked for a better life partner. Happy anniversary, sweetheart.\"\n\nCredit: REVOLT / Youtube\n\nDecember 2022\n\nThe former first lady got candid in a round table discussion with Revolt TV about her relationship with her husband. She revealed that she reached a point where she “couldn’t stand” him while their “kids were little.”\n\n\"And for 10 years while we're trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who's doing what and what, I was like, 'Ugh, this isn't even,'\" Michelle admitted. \"And guess what? Marriage isn't 50/50, ever, ever.\"\n\nShe added: \"There are times I'm 70, he's 30. There are times he's 60, 40, but guess what? 10 years — we've been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30 — it's just how you look at it.”\n\nCredit: SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nMichelle revealed during an appearance on the “On Purpose With Jay Shetty” podcast that her marriage to Barack has never been perfect. “I don't want people looking at me and Barack like hashtag couple goals and not know that no, no, there are some broken things that happen even in the best of marriages,” she said, noting that the pair still get into arguments but have learned how to bounce back quicker.\n\n“It's the choice to figure it out, not to quit when it gets hard,” Michelle explained. “So yeah, I said something that I didn't mean to say, right? Year five, we might've had hurt feelings and it would have taken days to rectify it. Year 30, it's like, ‘Ah, there she goes again, or there he goes again.’ I know how to talk to him about it and when, because we've practiced it.”\n\nThe author confessed that she and Barack have “made a lot of mistakes” and have “gotten it wrong,” but that’s why they’ve lasted. “After 31 years, we're getting better at it and it gets better and better and better,” Michelle added."
