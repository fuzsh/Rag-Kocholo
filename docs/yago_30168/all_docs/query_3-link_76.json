        "text": "Vote blue or kiss democracy goodbye\n\nIn the June 27 letters, Jeffrey Greek stated that he intends to vote for Michelle Obama for president. He stated her qualifications and that she would probably be a good president.\n\nThere’s only one problem: She has no chance of winning.\n\nAnd a vote not cast for Joe Biden means Donald Trump needs one less vote to win.\n\nDid we not learn anything from Ralph Nader in 2000? In all likelihood, votes for Nader helped elect George Bush.\n\nTrump vs. Biden? Debate's over: I want to elect Michelle Obama president.\n\nIn 2016, votes for the Green Party’s Jill Stein cost Hillary Clinton the election, and gave us four years of the worst president in history.\n\nThis time around, if Donald Trump wins, it will be the end of our democracy. (see \"Project 2025\").\n\nWhat happened in the immunity case? Trump's sentencing in New York hush money case delayed over Supreme Court immunity ruling\n\nThere won’t be any real elections in 2028. Or maybe we’ll have “show” elections like in Russia, where Putin won 88% of the vote in 2024.\n\nOr maybe Trump, with \"scotus\" granted immunity (I refuse to capitalize \"scotus\"), will have any legitimate competition killed.\n\nVote blue or kiss our democracy goodbye.\n\nJohn Tripp, Westerville\n\nThe enemy is trying to get back in\n\nAt lunchtime on September 11, 2001, two friends and I were walking around our work campus as we always did. But this day we walked in silence with the images of the World Trade Center's collapsing twin towers burned in our minds.\n\nAn enemy is again attacking our nation, only now the enemy is domestic.\n\nIt’s in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is striving desperately to, again, get into the White House.\n\nOn July 1, the U.S. Supreme Court proved that the enemy is there, too, by stating the former president — the twice impeached, adjudicated sexual abuser, business fraud, convicted felon and an accused insurrectionist — is above the law.\n\nEverything you need for the election: How to register to vote in Ohio ahead of Election Day 2024\n\nWe must dissent. Please get registered and use your power, your vote in November, to stop the fascist MAGA Republicans from destroying our democracy and our rule of law. Because no less than the attackers on 9-11, that is their goal.\n\nRichard D. Back, New Albany\n\nRespect the community\n\nDear Columbus council members: slow down or reset the clock.\n\nWhen individual construction projects are given months to years for deliberations and re-submissions, why is Columbus's massive overhaul of its zoning code allowed only 60 days for public comment?\n\nAt the Zone In hearing June 27, city officials acknowledged they cannot make changes to parcels on the Zone In map, nor add new parcels or remove parcels from the map.\n\nOpinion: 'People say Columbus has lost all its historic charm.' Zone In would wipe away more of it.\n\nThey claimed the laws they put in place would require another mailing campaign, two meetings and another 60 days for comment about the changes. And they just can't have that.\n\nI support Monica Tuttle's testimony and encourage you to watch the meeting on YouTube.\n\nI would like to add, why even bother giving us the option to react to the zoning map when you'll refuse to address any changes? You say you'll revisit any changes in a later phase of the zoning overhaul. But, pawning that off to a later phase means throwing these issues away.\n\nIf 60 more days is what's required for the public to have a voice in actually changing our new zoning proposal, then that's what must be.\n\nMichael Feist, Columbus\n\nPerfect moment to retire Biden from politics\n\nThe presidential debate revealed the nature and depth of the crisis in national leadership.\n\nTo prevent the ominous and growing probability of a second Donald Trump presidency, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris must recognize that notwithstanding their service over the past three years, they simply do not command the popular support required to win what should be a cakewalk.\n\nLaughable cartoons on the debate: Trump vs. Biden debate: 10 cartoons about first presidential debate\n\nBiden should retire — now. Harris should serve out the term but not seek re-election.\n\nThey should use their leverage to negotiate a national unity ticket with a Democratic governor or senator for president and invite Liz Cheney to partner as candidate for vice president.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention has the latitude to broker such a ticket, and traditional conservative Republicans have the leverage to offer the same alternative to the Republican National Convention.\n\nIt is a golden moment for Joe Biden to demonstrate the wisdom he brought to the office three-and-one half years ago. The courage of an honest look in the mirror and selflessness to put pride to the side are required for the hard realities of the moment.\n\nJohn A. Begala, Granville\n\nSupreme Court fighting for Trump\n\nWow. I never realized the U.S. Constitution could be amended so easily.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court — including two Justices who have demonstrable conflicts of interest and three who were appointed from the petitioner — has decided that contrary to Article 2, Section 4 of our Constitution, presidents are in fact above the law and immune from prosecution for their “official acts.”\n\nThat’s not what three of the six (John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh) said under oath in their confirmation hearings, but hey, sworn testimony is irrelevant, right?\n\nCalling for a member of Congress to be tried before a military tribunal? Stopping a Justice Department investigation of your friends and political allies?\n\nBlackmailing foreign governments to undermine your political opponents? Hiding classified documents in your home’s bathroom? Using your office to settle personal grievances?\n\nTrump said, \"Sure, why not?\"\n\nThis Supreme Court has become the plaintiff’s ally in the case of “Donald J. Trump v. United States.” Oh, yes, it has.\n\nSteve Abbott, Columbus\n\nA man that never ate from a paper plate\n\nContrary to the June 30 story, \"How rich is your member of Congress,\" being rich is not a qualification for public office.\n\nResponsible government requires the commitment to promote and protect the people being represented. It was disheartening to read, again, that money is what matters in the upcoming election.\n\nThe money behind politicians: How central Ohio members of Congress, candidates got rich: stocks, books and concrete\n\nAmelia Republican David Taylor may be the favorite for District 2 according to wallet, but he is opposed to women's reproductive rights, has no agenda to actually support the rural residents of District 2 and his platform is, \"Whatever Trump says.\"\n\nThe $1.2 million he spent in the primary didn't go toward any goods, services, transportation, health care or job development for the region. Taylor is enthralled by a man who never ate from a paper plate, never visited a national park, never picked a tomato and thinks veterans are suckers.\n\nSamantha Meadows ran unopposed, spent just $9,000 on the primary, but spends her time traveling to every county in the 8,000-square-mile district, talking to individuals, groups and organizations, gathering endorsements from working people, retired people and people who believe women can make their own health care decisions.\n\nShe is invested in the people of southern Ohio. More than a favorite, that makes her the choice.\n\nPat Lawrence, Hillsboro\n\nWill the real Lady Justice please stand up?\n\nLady Justice no longer wears her blindfold. She has pulled up a corner so she can wink at future presidents who are now above the law.\n\nErnie Hartong, Columbus"
