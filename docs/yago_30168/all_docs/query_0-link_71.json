        "text": "Former President Barack Obama and wife Michelle's romance dates long before they stepped into the White House (or even started political careers for the matter!). They met as corporate law co-workers, quickly fell in love, and have quite literally become our definition of #MarriageGoals ever since. Between their early days in Chicago to their time in the Oval Office and beyond, here is a complete timeline of Barack and Michelle Obama's relationship.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama met in 1989 while Barack was a summer associate at her law office. That summer they went on their first date and tied the knot three years later in 1992.\n\nIn 1998 and 2001, the couple became parents to daughters Malia and Natasha (Sasha) Obama, respectively.\n\nThey became the 44th president and first lady of the United States when Barack won the 2008 presidential election.\n\nAfter spending eight years in the White House, the Obama family moved back to Chicago but still stay active in the political scene. In 2017, they celebrated 25 years of marriage.\n\n1989: Co-workers in Chicago\n\nWhen Barack began working at law firm Sidley Austin LLP in 1989, he was assigned Michelle (née Robinson) as his mentor. Michelle recalled to ABC News in 2008, \"Because I went to Harvard and he went to Harvard, and the firm thought, 'Oh, we'll hook these two people up.'\"\n\nJuly 1, 1989: Kisses Over Ice Cream\n\nIt wasn't long into his time at the law firm that Barack asked Michelle out on a date (one month in, to be exact!). However, Michelle found the action to be \"completely tacky\" and refused. She did, of course, eventually give in and on July 1, 1989 the pair went out for ice cream and the night ended with a kiss. \"On our first date, I treated her to the finest ice cream Baskin-Robbins had to offer, our dinner table doubling as the curb. I kissed her, and it tasted like chocolate,\" Barack told O Magazine in 2007. Michelle on the other hand once said, \"We clicked right away…by the end of the date, it was over…I was sold.\"\n\nJuly 31, 1991: Barack's Restaurant Proposal\n\nOn July 31, 1991, Barack and Michelle went out to Gordan's Restaurant in Chicago to celebrate Barack passing the bar exam. But the night turned into more than just a dinner date—there was a proposal! Michelle explained the simple, romantic engagement in her book Becoming: \"As we were reaching the end of the meal, Barack smiled at me and raised the subject of marriage. He reached for my hand and said that as much as he loved me with his whole being, he still didn't really see the point. Instantly, I felt the blood rise in my cheeks. It was like pushing a button in me—the kind of big blinking red button you might find in some sort of nuclear facility surrounded by warnings signs and evacuation maps. Really? We were going to do this now?\"\n\nShe continued, \"Eventually, our waiter came around holding a dessert plate, covered by a silver lid. He slid it in front of me and lifted the cover. I was almost too miffed to even look down, but when I did, I saw a dark velvet box where the chocolate cake was supposed to be. Inside was a diamond ring. Barack looked at me playfully. He'd baited me. It had all been a ruse. It took me a second to dismantle my anger and slide into joyful shock. He'd riled me up because this was the very last time he would invoke his inane marriage argument, ever again, as long as we both should live.\"\n\nOctober 3, 1992: A Very '90s Wedding\n\nOne year later, the couple wed on October 3, 1992, at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.
