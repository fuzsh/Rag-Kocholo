The Obamas are celebrating a major milestone. On this day 25 years ago, Barack H. Obama married Miss Michelle Robinson. And today, October 3, 2017, the former First Lady marked the occasion in the sweetest way.

Mrs. Obama posted a photo of the couple on their wedding day on Twitter and Instagram with a caption that read: “Happy 25th anniversary ‪@barackobama‬. A quarter of a century later, you’re still my best friend & the most extraordinary man I know. I [love] you.”
