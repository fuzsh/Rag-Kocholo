In an author's note to ''A Dream Play,'' his own favorite of all his works, August Strindberg indicated that he had tried to imitate ''the logical shape of a dream.'' In a dream and in the play, ''the imagination spins, weaving new patterns, a mixture of memories, experiences, free fancies, incongruities and improvisations. The characters split, double, multiply, evaporate, condense, disperse, assemble.''

A cornerstone of modern expressionist drama, ''A Dream Play'' is one of the most difficult plays to realize on stage and one of the most rarely produced. Perhaps what is needed is for a visionary director to dream it, or to film it. In her adroit, unmannered production at the Open Space Theater, Susan Einhorn has left much of the play to the audience's imagination.

For obvious reasons, she overlooks the author's astonishing stage directions, such as the final image: ''As the castle burns, the bud on the roof bursts open into a giant chrysanthemum.'' On this stage, there are no boats shaped like a dragon, terraced casinos or long green waves lapping into Fingal's Cave. The central symbol, ''the rising castle,'' which was Strindberg's original title for the play, is somewhere behind the audience. The actors pretend to see it, and if you strain your senses, you can ''see'' it, too, growing from the mire.

The stress is on the text, as translated from the Swedish by Elizabeth Sprigge, and the story of the descent of Indra's daughter from heaven to earth to discover the secret of man's sorrow. Mankind is represented by three stand-ins for Strindberg, an officer, a lawyer and a poet. Characters and places are suddenly transformed, the present converges with the future and scenes are jump-cut. The fact that only eight actors are playing dozens of roles embellishes the dreamlike aspect of the evening. The theatergoer's attitude should be to ignore exegesis and to let the play wash over one.
