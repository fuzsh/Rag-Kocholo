        "text": "The aim of this article is to explore embodied practices of memory in Strindberg’s drama A Dream Play from a dance perspective. It is demonstrated that a profound exploration of this hitherto underexplored perspective can provide a fuller and more critically productive understanding of the drama. Even if in recent years international Strindberg studies has moved away from narrowly text-oriented and biographical approaches to his work, and toward multimedia, visual and multisensory aspects of it, dance and choreography are still rare topics within the field. In the article we first look at how Strindberg employed dance in the dramatic text for A Dream Play, and then expand on his dance contexts. Thirdly, we turn to a TV version of A Dream Play from 1980 to explore in particular how the waltz, an immensely popular dance form in Strindberg’s time, evokes and embodies cultural memories in the production. What is presented in the article draws on and further expands our work within the p...\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards in particular, much significance has been given to theatre that is themed around the dual relationship between the mind and exposing the hidden memory, or re-animating what has been erased from memory. The aim of this paper is to uncover and defend the existence and future existence of a dystopic world in terms of how the mind relates it with reality in two post-modern plays, Escaped Alone (2016) and Far Away (2000), by one of British theatre’s most prominent of playwrights Caryl Churchill. Churchill, who is familiar negative direction that the world within which she lives is going, makes mention of a world that is leaning towards an unpredictable chaos by putting violence, death, and political events at the forefront. Within the frame of Jeanette Malkin’s Memoy-Theatre theory, the notion of the hidden memory emerges as Churchill uses the art of over-representation. In Far Away, how memory is changed and re-created as well when and how it affects the persona i...\n\nIn many ways, Strindberg&#39;s works are among the most paradoxical in modern literature. Violently misogynistic, they nevertheless reveal a man who worships Woman, cannot live without her, loathing her as Mistress but adoring her as Mother; almost brutal in the violence of their emotions, they are at the same time gentle in the irony of their humour; totally unorthodox in their theology, they are profoundly religious; even when most naturalistic (as in Froken Julie: Miss Julie), they are highly symbolic. The leading practitioner of naturalistic drama is also the father of the theatre of the absurd. However unlike his works might appear to one another, and whatever the seeming contradictions and inconsistencies among the various ideas espoused and championed by Strindberg at different points in his career, his themes remained the same: his own life, the struggle for dominance between the sexes, psychological domination through the power of suggestion, the problem of the existence of..."
