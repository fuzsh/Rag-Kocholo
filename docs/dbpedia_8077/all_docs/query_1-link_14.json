        "text": "Debates about how August Strindberg's A Dream Play (Ett Drömspel, 1901) relates to early film form have often focused on establishing historical notions of media specificity, prevalent in both cinema and theatre scholarship. By contextualizing a Dream Play in relation to Georges Méliès early \"dream film\" cinema and situating it in a historical context that bridges Paris with Stockholm, this chapter challenges some of the ideological investments that have kept theories of stage and screen separate. The philosophical line drawn about medium specificity in theatre and early cinema assumes a firm binary between theatre/performance/stage practice as verbal and early cinema/film/recording/projection as visual. Similarly, such reductionist arguments assume that stage practice, understood to be immediate, embodied and ephemeral, is distinct from the cinema, understood to be technologically mediated and repeatable. By the same token, a wide variety of terms were used to describe early cinematic cameras and projectors, many drawing upon etymologies of sight and writing, along with words signaling magic, light, theatre, kinetics and embodied experiences. These include the laterna magica, kinetoscope, theatrograph, bioscope, vitascope, cinematograph, kinematograph, Ouimetoscope, vitagraph and Mutoscope. These terms signal the belief in a conceptual overlap and amalgamation of a variety of representational forms. This is also true of terms in various languages for cinema as a location for motion-picture projection: for instance, 'Biograf ' in Swedish; 'Kino' in German and Norwegian; 'movie theater' in American English. This chapter historicizes and challenges many of the historical assumptions of stage and screen cultures through comparative case studies of Strindberg's drama and Méliès's fillms. In August Strindberg and Visual Culture: The Emergence of Optical Modernity in Theater, Text, and Image. Ed. by Anna Westerstahl Stenport, Eszter Szalczer, and Jonathan Schroeder. London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2018. 95-112.\n\nWritten in Denmark in French in 1887–88, Swedish author August Strindberg's novel A Madman's Defense (Le Plaidoyer d'un fou) was first published in an 1893 German translation and subsequently released in a manicured French version in 1895. The German version was taken to court on indecency charges in Vilhelmine Berlin, the French version became a scandal, and Strindberg never authorized the novel for publication in Sweden. Although A Madman's Defense helped cement Strindberg's reputation at home and abroad as a paranoid misogynist, it also provides a complementary trajectory for understanding the emergence of European transnational prose modernism. In its conception, publication, and reception, A Madman's Defense straddles both national and linguistic borders; its plot involves travel trajectories that link Sweden with the continent, and Stockholm with Paris. This novel tells a story of adultery, divorce, and lesbian desire, while tracing, through a first-person voice, the narrator's professed descent into madness. One thematic emphasis links transgressions of public and private with specific architectural manifestations. This article traces these architectural manifestations and argues that, as the narrator appears increasingly irrational, boundaries of nation, of public and private, and of gendered conventions disintegrate in ways that illustrate how literary setting becomes a vehicle of modernist literary experimentation. The article discusses specific locations through which this transformation is effected, including a bourgeois apartment, a railway station, a library, and a tourist boarding house. It also links Strindberg's writing about divorce and lesbian desire with nineteenth-century French literary texts, including those of the 1880s, and with Henrik Ibsen's plays and legacy in Paris during the 1880s and 1890s.\n\nIn many ways, Strindberg&#39;s works are among the most paradoxical in modern literature. Violently misogynistic, they nevertheless reveal a man who worships Woman, cannot live without her, loathing her as Mistress but adoring her as Mother; almost brutal in the violence of their emotions, they are at the same time gentle in the irony of their humour; totally unorthodox in their theology, they are profoundly religious; even when most naturalistic (as in Froken Julie: Miss Julie), they are highly symbolic. The leading practitioner of naturalistic drama is also the father of the theatre of the absurd. However unlike his works might appear to one another, and whatever the seeming contradictions and inconsistencies among the various ideas espoused and championed by Strindberg at different points in his career, his themes remained the same: his own life, the struggle for dominance between the sexes, psychological domination through the power of suggestion, the problem of the existence of...\n\nSpecial Issue of _Scandinavian Studies_.

Both were broadcast live and favorably received by contemporary critics. A recurrent reaction was that television finally “did justice” to these plays from the early 20th century; implying, as did Raymond Williams in his 1974 book on television, that Strindberg’s later drama somehow “anticipated” television. This claim is explored in relation to various thematic and formal expressions of temporality in both plays (motifs of enclosed spaces, telephones, clouds, and faces and the dialectics of progress and repetition) and the specificities of television (the “management of liveness,” “mobile privatization,” monitoring, etc.). The type of historicity involved in the claim that art may anticipate oncoming media technology is related to Walter Benjamin’s notion of pre- and post-history."
