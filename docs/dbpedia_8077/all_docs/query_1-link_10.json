        "text": "August Strindberg may not have had the snooze alarm in mind when he wrote ''A Dream Play'' in 1901, but maybe Robert Wilson did when he undertook to design and direct it. The thought was the first thing that occurred to me the morning after seeing the show at the Howard Gilman Opera House of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where it runs through Sunday.\n\nMy fitful wakening featured an eerie dream involving a child swimming happily in a sea of warm oil (interpretations, please?) -- the dream was interrupted by news radio, then resumed with an imagistic stagger -- as if a few frames from the film had been excised. The dream held no (apparent) thematic connection to Strindberg's spiritual plaint, in which the daughter of a Hindu god visits Earth for a taste of human experience and comes away stunned by the paradoxes of mortality.\n\nBut the experience of emerging from and sinking back into helpless reverie was remarkably similar to that of watching this languorously paced production, which was first performed in 1998 by Mr. Wilson and the Swedish theater company Stockholm's Stadsteater. Its 13 tableaus -- with Mr. Wilson's striking surrealistic stage pictures, carefully orchestrated music, and sound effects and actors in thrall to a rigorously stylized choreography -- are separated by dissolves or abrupt blackouts; they describe as a whole a fragmented narrative that is as unsettling and resonant as sleep interrupted by reality, and vice versa.\n\nThis is faithful to the intent of the playwright who, a year after the publication of Freud's ''Interpretation of Dreams,'' presented ''A Dream Play'' and provided an explanatory note that ''the author has tried to imitate the disconnected but apparently logical form of a dream.''\n\n''Anything can happen,'' Strindberg wrote. ''Everything is possible and likely. Time and space do not exist; on an insignificant basis of reality, the imagination spins and weaves new patterns: a blending of memories, experiences, free inventions, absurdities and improvisations.'' It is only the single consciousness of the dreamer, ''who does not judge, does not acquit, simply relates,'' he explained, that unifies the events and images.\n\nIn the play, the young woman, who is called Agnes -- and is played here by Jessica Liedberg with the fierce physical control of a slow-motion gymnast -- proceeds through a series of interlocking social scenarios in the company of three different men -- an officer, lawyer and poet -- witnessing and experiencing the frustrations of human intercourse. The secondary characters include a Cerberus-like doorkeeper at a theater, a mad glazier, an aging bill poster with an inordinate attachment to fishing equipment, a ballet dancer, an opera singer, a blind man and a band of loony academics.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
