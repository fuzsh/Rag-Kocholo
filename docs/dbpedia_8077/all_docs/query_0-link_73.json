        "text": "Since the 1980s, new approaches to theatre historiography, the study of what Sue-Ellen Case has called the “convergence of history and theory,” have begun to arise in a challenge to generally accepted principles of theatre history, such as the supremacy of independent facts, the autonomy of dramatic texts, and the hierarchy of text, performance, and culture. The French critic and philosopher Michel Foucault has pointed out that the grouping and ordering of events into historical periods creates a “space of reference,” which lends some events a heightened meaning, while obscuring or submerging others. In a substantial challenge to traditional methods of theatre history, historiographers influenced by this view have begun to examine the theoretical underpinnings of historical periodization. In theatre theory, Thomas Postlewait has investigated the often unarticulated assumptions by which theatre historians isolate a group of historical events and designate them with period names.Many scholars now center their attention on historical discontinuity: searching for ruptures in the historical narrative, focusing on dynamics which lend instability rather than stability to historical periods, and reconceptualizing temporal historical narratives into spatial relationships. For example, from a perspective of discontinuity, a play is conceived not simply as a fixed entity created at some moment in history, but as a representation of layers of historical influences; likewise, a theatre building is not simply a material location in space, but a physical expression of historically emergent architectural styles and sociopolitical circumstances, and a performance is not simply a translation of a text to the stage, but a collage of past and emergent cultural and aesthetic processes.\n\n7.

With the exception of Bertolt Brecht, who serves feminist critics with strategies for their own political and artistic endeavors, modernist writers, from Sue-Ellen Case's perspective, draw on Freudian biases in conceiving their characters and place the male as a sexual subject in contrast with the female as the sexual “other.” (Case, Feminism, 123–124.) Recently, scholars have pursued a number of strands in the complex issue of modernists' attitudes toward gender and sexuality. These include Andreas Huysen's discussion of the contradictions inherent in the direct, forceful male misogyny in writers such as Strindberg and Eugene O'Neill and the modernists' attempt to put themselves in the role of the female and to use feminine imagery. Others have commented on the modernist hostility toward modern metropolises such as Berlin as dangerous feminine territory.

There is no evidence that this scenic realization was meant to be used in a realistic manner, with action restricted to the areas representing the locations on the stage. Strindberg's other suggestions for simplifying the set included the use of projections or a system of arches with backcloths behind them. However, as Gösta Bergman reports, the director Albert Ranft did not follow Strindberg's suggestions for the production at the Svenska Teatern. Instead, he commissioned the scene designer Grabow to produce a realistic set picture to stay within the realm of pictorialism.

According to this suggestion, the scenes of Act I would be stacked stage right, the scenes of Act II in the middle, and the scenes of Act III stage left, in front of the backdrop of the castle. In the draft of the play which Strindberg used as the basis for the sketches, the sequence from the castle to the first cave scene comprised Act I, the sequence from the Lawyer's chamber to the Mediterranean, Act II, and the repeated scenes of the cave, theatre corridor, and the castle, Act III. The prelude in heaven was not considered in the sketch."
