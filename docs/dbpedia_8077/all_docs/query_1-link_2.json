        "text": "A Dream Play, fantasy play in 14 scenes by August Strindberg, published in Swedish as Ett drömspel in 1902 and first produced in 1907. Presented as a dream, this fluid tableau of human foibles is a poignant lament that humans are to be pitied.\n\nAs the play opens, the daughter of the Vedic god Indra arrives on Earth with the intention of determining if human complaints are justified. She encounters a host of tormented characters and herself is enmeshed in a wrenching marriage. Only the Poet, who has created the dream, seems unaffected by human suffering."
