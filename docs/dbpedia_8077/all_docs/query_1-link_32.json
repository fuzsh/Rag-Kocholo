        "text": "Amidst a fascination with alchemy, eastern thought and Christian mysticism, August Strindberg wrote one of his most enigmatic and emotional plays. This adaptation focuses on the epic nature of Strindberg’s work. Witnessing each of these characters less like visions of some impending future, but more as creatures from a collective mythology that explores love, suffering, struggle, and above all, the ability to acknowledge that what defines us also confines us. Using Theater Mitu’s Whole Theater approach, this piece energizes the text with acrobatic physicality, modernist design and an impactful live music score, as well as strains of Japanese Butoh, Noh, and Indian Kathakali."
