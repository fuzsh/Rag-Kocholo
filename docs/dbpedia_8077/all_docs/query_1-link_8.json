        "text": "In the preface to Dream Play, Strindberg explained that he was seeking to imitate the shape and content of a dream. Written in 1901, when Strindberg was 52, the play was the culmination of his interest in dreams and the supernatural that had begun in the 1890s.\n\nWhen he was living in Paris in 1896, he became involved in a particular brand of occultism involving mysticism, ghosts, exorcisms and black magic. He was especially interested in the idea that people had astral bodies or dream selves that existed independently of their ordinary personalities. He began a diary called The Occult Diary, which he kept for 22 years, and in which he recorded strange coincidences, dreams, clairvoyant experiences, the flights of birds, the movement of dogs, cats and spiders, significant playing cards and the numbers on railway tickets. Dream entries included a severed head that began to speak, being threatened by a railway worker's son who had teeth like fish hooks, and seeing the Venus di Milo in a coffee cup. Dreams also started to work their way into his plays, mainly as subjects for conversation between his characters. In The Pelican, Assir tells his teacher that he had a dream about an old man who showed him a piece of paper with meaningless words written on it. He then held the paper up to the light and discovered that there was another text visible, like a water mark, which contained important truths.\n\nIn 1896 he also became interested in the 18th-century physicist, anatomist and psychical researcher, Emanuel Swedenborg, who experienced visions in which angels and dead people spoke to him, and who attached great mystical significance to dreams. Later, Strindberg studied Edgar Allen Poe's treatment of dreams in his stories, and in 1899 he read Rudyard Kipling's story The Brushwood Boy, about a man and a woman who meet in each other's dreams.\n\nStrindberg's diary of dreams was more connected to his passion for occultism and mysticism than to psychology. But he was curious enough about the subject in 1896 to read William James's essay Principles of Psychology, written in 1890. He had not read Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams, published in 1900, when he wrote A Dream Play a year later (it was performed in 1907). There are many modern Freudian analyses of the play that suggest phallic towers or vaginal flowers but there is no evidence that these readings reflect Strindberg's intentions. And although certain events in the play chime with some of Freud's categorisations of dreams, such as the scene in which the dreamer revisits his mother 10 years after her death, there are no direct dream parallels.\n\nA Dream Play is a series of episodes in one long dream that, as Strindberg's preface states, all take place inside one person's consciousness. The play opens inside the dream and there is no framing device to guide you to who the dreamer is. My aim with this new production, like Strindberg's, has been to put a dream on stage. Choosing a dreamer was the first challenge. The actors and I then started to construct the dreamer's waking world and to imagine what may have sparked their dreams.\n\nSo why do we dream? According to Freud, dreams are wish fulfilments or a means of giving unacceptable impulses and thoughts a healthy outlet. We looked at how different religions such as Islam, Judaism, Christianity and those of the ancient Greeks diagnosed dreams as messages from God or gods. Some contemporary scientists claim that dreaming is just random and chaotic brain activity; some suggest that dreams provide us with a practice run at dealing with threats in the waking world; others see dreaming as a process by which we eliminate unneeded information from our memories.\n\nIn order to find a theatrical language with which to communicate a dream, we studied our own and others' dreams. We took dreams from Freud's book and also Jung's work, both of which set us many staging challenges, such as men giving birth or wild horses galloping through upper-floor flats and leaping out of windows. Our own dreams were no easier to stage: there were angels with suitcases of dead babies, bombs under tables, terrorists in toilets, lobsters with testicles, teeth spilling out of mouths, amputations, flying and weddings that were funerals. We decided only to select material that we could stage without having to use clunky theatrical conventions.\n\nWe noticed that many people dream in black and white, that it is often difficult to read language in dreams and that emotions are experienced intensely. In dreams people can fly; they can be shot at and not die; they can be unable to move or be heard when faced with a life-threatening situation. We observed how the waking world can inform a dream, and stumbled on a rash of unpleasant dreams in which people thought they had woken up when they had not.\n\nStrindberg's original dreams include a flying schoolboy, an anxiety dream of returning to the classroom as an adult and not being able to do sums, a wedding that was a suicide pact and a man waiting at a stage door for a woman who never arrives and who ages 60 years in 10 minutes. There are passages in the play that are more specific to Strindberg's own past, such as the dreamer's visit to his dead mother (Strindberg's mother died in 1862 when he was 13). However, there are also passages that felt more like scenes from a play than sequences from a dream, and I began to make judicious cuts to the non-dreamlike material. This might seem like a travesty of Strindberg's original but I felt there was a tension in some scenes between his aim of staging a dream, and the theatrical limitations of his day, such as demands for a linear narrative or crude stage machinery.\n\nAfter two months we finally created a performance that combines much of the original text with other dream material. Although it is a slightly different shape to that first imagined by Strindberg, it has at its heart the same impossible aim: to put a dream on stage. As Strindberg wrote: \"Everything can happen, everything is possible and probable. Time and place do not exist; on an insignificant basis of reality the imagination spins, weaving new patterns; a mixture of memories, experiences, free associations, incongruities and improvisations. The characters split, double, multiply, evaporate, condense, disperse, assemble. But one consciousness rules over them all, that of the dreamer; for him there are no secrets, no illogicalities, no scruples, no laws.\""
