        "text": "August Strindberg in America, 1963–1979: A Bibliographical Assessment\n\nBirgitta Steene\n\nFrom the very beginning, Strindberg’s reputation in America has rested on a somewhat ambivalent interest in his dramatic works among playwrights, theater directors, and drama critics alike. In a doctoral dissertation from 1959 dealing with Broadway productions of Strindberg’s plays, Ralph Haugen lists thirty productions of twelve of Strindberg’s works between 1912 and 1956.1 Not very many of these seem to have been first-rate stagings and the critical reception, especially of the earlier ones, was mostly negative: Strindberg was considered crude, pessimistic, and archaic. Yet his plays obviously had an impact on a number of American playwrights. John Gassner, in an article on the influence of Strindberg in the United States, has pointed out that: “in one way or another, American playwrights were bound to become aware of Strindberg’s work, which was too powerful to be ignored despite the dearth of adequate productions of his plays in this country.”2\n\nGassner saw Strindberg as the father of the modern psychological drama and as an important catalyst in the American theater. His impact was not only technical but above all one of dramatic temperament. His boldness, intensity, and integrity of feeling account, according to Gassner, for his lasting interest to such American playwrights as O’Neill, Tennessee Williams, William Inge, and Edward Albee. As several of the articles and dissertations in this bibliography indicate, critics have become well aware of the parallels between Strindberg’s stagecraft and the works of twentieth-century American playwrights.\n\nEgil Törnqvist has noted that during the period 1893–1909 only eleven articles had been written in the United States about Strindberg.3 But the playwright’s death in 1912 resulted in an upsurge of interest so that by 1919 one hundred and fifty articles had appeared on the Swedish dramatist in America. Translations of his works increased during the same period, the first sizable edition being that of Scribner from 1912 to 1916 with Edwin Björkman as the translator of the eighteen plays.4 From the beginning, then, Strindberg’s reception in the United States reflects an interest in his work in both academic and theatrical circles. Today the volume of Strindberg scholarship published in the United States continues to grow. New translations of his works are still forthcoming. Productions of his plays, although not overwhelming in number, nevertheless indicate that he is securely ensconced among the group of modern classics whose works are a challenge to the living theater.\n\nIn 1962, to mark the fifty years since Strindberg’s death, the Swedish playwright became the first continental dramatist to be honored by a special issue of the journal Modern Drama. The occasion emphasized once more that in America (as elsewhere outside Sweden) Strindberg is primarily known as a writer for the stage. This is reflected in translations of his works, where his plays outnumber many times his novels, and in the concentration of scholarly articles dealing with his literary production.\n\nOne of the most talked about early productions of a Strindberg play was the Provincetown Theatre rendering of The Spook Sonata (The Ghost Sonata) in 1924. In the years to follow, however, it was almost entirely Strindberg’s naturalistic dramas that were performed in the United States, especially The Father, Miss Julie, Creditors, and The Dance of Death. A look at the production list for the period covered by this bibliography (1963–79) would indicate that these are still the plays that dominate the Strindberg repertory in America. A notable exception is the 1977 production of The Ghost Sonata at the Yale Repertory Theater, which elicited very favorable reviews from such leading drama critics as Harold Clurman and Jack Kroll.5 Perhaps American theaters will soon follow the trend among recent Strindberg scholars in the United States and center more of their attention on Strindberg’s post-Inferno plays. Most dominant are those studies that examine the cultural and intellectual background of these dramas, and articles that trace motifs and themes in one or more of Strindberg’s works. Numerous references are also made to Strindberg’s impact on the Theater of the Absurd, noting the importance of his dramatic language and symbolistic stagecraft.\n\nThe bibliography that follows is intended to bring up to date the American part of the excellent bibliographies of Esther H. Rapp and Jackson R. Bryer from 1951 and 1962 respectively.6 For the most part, only books and articles either originally published in the United States or written by Americans in other English-language publications have been included. The listings fall into four major categories: Translations, Books, Articles, and Dissertations.\n\nA. Translations\n\nA great many translations of Strindberg’s works were done in the 1950s and early 1960s, among them Walter Johnson’s pioneer translations of several of the historical plays; Arvid Paulson’s edition of Strindberg’s letters to Harriet Bosse; and Elizabeth Sprigge’s Double-day edition of six plays.

Allen, James L., Jr. “Symbol and Meaning in Strindberg’s Crime and Crime.” Modern Drama, 9 (1966), 62–63.\n\nClaims that Strindberg’s Crime and Crime (Brott och brott) can only be understood through study of certain major symbolic motifs, such as the concept of original sin and the felix culpa (the fortunate fall). The title refers to two kinds of crime: (1) those never repented and (2) those atoned for through penance.\n\n49. Bandy, Stephen C. “Strindberg’s Biblical Sources for The Ghost Sonata.” Scandinavian Studies, 40 (1968), 200–209.\n\nSees the structure of The Ghost Sonata as a series of tightly interlocking allusions to incidents recorded in the Bible and relates the Milkmaid, Hummel, and the Student to specific episodes and people in the Bible.\n\n50.

Only in his dream-plays did Strindberg find an artistic form that completely merges with his message.\n\nSee also entry no. 127.\n\n51.

Bailey.\n\n54. Block, Haskell. “Strindberg and the Symbolist Drama.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 314–22.\n\nArgues that Strindberg’s symbolist affinities in the 1890s were religious rather than literary in origin. A symbolist playwright like Maeterlinck “was not so much a model for Strindberg as an incitement to continued exploration of his own occultism.”\n\n55. Borland, Harold H. “The Dramatic Quality of Strindberg’s Novels.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 299–305.\n\nA study of the dramatic quality of The Red Room, The People of Hemsö, and By the Open Sea. Although no common denominator can be found for Strindberg’s three novels, all of them display a strong dramatic sense, a view of life as conflict and encounter.\n\n56. Boyd, Ursel D. “Friedrich Dürrenmatt und sein Drama Play Strindberg.” Germanic Notes, 3:3 (1972), pp. 18–21.\n\nDiscusses Dürrenmatt’s “adaptation” of Strindberg’s Dance of Death in terms of theatrical motifs, plot and mise-en-scène.\n\n57. Bronsen, David. “The Dance of Death and the Possibility of Laughter.” Drama Survey, 6 (1967), 31–44.\n\nSees the Dance of Death as a macabre tragedy, grotesque mime, and farce. These modes complement each other and create a drama of uneasy tension.\n\n58. Carlson, Harry G. “Ambiguity and Archetypes in Strindberg’s Romantic Organist.” Scandinavian Studies, 48 (1976), 256–71.\n\nSees the complex archetype of the Great Mother as a possible unifying element in the novella The Romantic Organist.

Carlson. A challenge to the biographical approach to the Swedish playwright.\n\nSee also entry no. 79.\n\n61. ___ “The Unknown Painter of Myth.” Scandinavian Review, 64:3 (Sept. 1976), pp. 32–38.\n\nPresentation of Strindberg as a graphic artist.

Dear, Irving. “Strindberg’s Dream Vision: Prelude to Film.” Criticism, 14 (1972), 253–65.\n\nA discussion of Strindberg’s “dream mode” as a filmic conception of experience, expressing itself in his concern with objectifying subject states and in his emphasis on objects and actions in themselves.\n\n64. DePaul, Brother C.F.X. “Bergman and Strindberg: Two Philosophies of Suffering.” College English, 26 (1965), 620–30.\n\nMostly an analysis of Bergman but with reference to such “Strindbergian” themes as suffering, atonement, and estrangement.\n\n65. Dukore, Bernard. “Strindberg: The Real and the Surreal.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 331–34.\n\nA brief discussion of two California productions of Strindberg’s The Dance of Death and Creditors, which leads the author to advocate the creation of “a uniquely Strindbergian style … wherein would exist a mutual transformation of the real and the surreal.”\n\n66. Flaxman, Seymour L. “The Debt of Williams and Miller to Ibsen and Strindberg.” Comparative Literature Studies (Special Advance Issue, 1963), pp. 51–60.\n\nTraces the dramaturgy of Williams back to Strindberg’s major plays.\n\n67. Fletcher, John. “Bergman and Strindberg.” Journal of Modern Literature, 3 (1973), 173–90.\n\nSingles out such parallels between Strindberg’s and Bergman’s work as the blurring of dream and reality, of past and present; the preoccupation with Christian morality; and the black-and-white mood. Sees Bergman as a disciplined artist, Strindberg as a diffuse and unfocused one. Bergman is a late modernist, Strindberg a late Romantic.\n\n68. Freedman, Morris. “Strindberg’s Positive Nihilism.” In Freedman, Morris, ed. Essays in the Modern Drama. (Boston: Heath, 1964), pp. 56–63. Reprinted from Drama Survey, 2 (1963), 288–96.\n\nA brief discussion of The Father, Miss Julie, Easter, and A Dream Play to show the development from characters who are “unable to yield to the requirements of reality” to those who can bind their nature and accept resignation. The development is one from destructive despair to positive nihilism.\n\n69. Goodman, Randolph. “Playwriting with a Third Eye: Fun and Games with Albee, Ibsen and Strindberg.” Columbia University Forum, 10: 1 (Spring 1967), pp. 18–22.\n\nSuggests Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler as a model for Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? but argues that Strindberg’s life and work inspired Ibsen’s drama.\n\n70. Grabowski, Simon. “Unreality in Plays of Ibsen, Strindberg and Hamsun.” Mosaic, 4:2 (Winter 1972), 63–76.\n\nDiscusses briefly A Dream Play as a journey from cosmic reality to material earth-dream. The dreamer is “a supra-personal, supra-objective eye with a claim to total planetary awareness.”\n\n71. Hamilton, Mary G. “Strindberg’s Alchemical Way of the Cross.” Mosaic, 7:4 (Summer 1974), pp. 139–53.\n\nDemonstrates how alchemy contributes to the major themes, images, structural technique and character development of To Damascus.\n\n72. Hartman, Murray. “Strindberg and O’Neill.” Educational Theatre Journal, 18:3 (Oct. 1966), pp. 216–31.\n\nDefines certain parallels in Strindberg’s and O’Neill’s lives: an Oedipal obsession, misogyny, rebelliousness against middle-class complacency. Both playwrights were restless experimenters with dramatic technique.\n\n73. Hauptman, Ira. “Strindberg’s Realistic Plays.” Yale Theatre, 5:2 (1974), pp. 87–94.\n\nA discussion of The Father and Miss Julie as a gradual shrinking of Strindberg’s dramatic universe, with nothing objective over which to fight, and no sense of an objectified society in which victory can have more than purely personal implications.\n\n74.

After the seduction, the floral and alcoholic symbolism is maintained and culminates in Miss Julie’s Lake Como fantasy.\n\n75.

Holtan, Orley I. “The Absurd World of Strindberg’s The Dance of Death.” Comparative Drama, 1 (1967), 199–206.\n\nIdentifies a number of themes in The Dance of Death: isolation, imprisonment, boredom, gratuitous cruelty, the meaninglessness of existence and sees the play as a grotesque combination of the comic and the tragic.\n\n77. Jarvi, Raymond. “Strindberg’s The Ghost Sonata and Sonata Form.” Mosaic, 5:4 (Summer 1972), pp. 69–84.\n\nA detailed analysis of the musical (sonata) structure of Strindberg’s drama, concluding that The Ghost Sonata might be placed between the first and second movements of Beethoven’s D-minor Piano Sonata.\n\n78. ___ “Ett drömspel: A Symphony for the Stage.” Scandinavian Studies, 44 (1972), 28–42.\n\nConsiders A Dreamplay a symphony for dramatic ensemble and an analogy to a sonata for orchestra, i.e., an extensive composition that treats the full orchestra as a single dynamic instrument.\n\nSee also entry no. 138.\n\n79. ___ and Harry G.

Johannesson, Eric O. “Syndabocken: Strindberg’s Last Novel.” Scandinavian Studies, 35 (1963), 1–28.\n\nConsiders Strindberg’s best fiction to be the short novels The Romantic Organist, Alone, The Roof-Raising [Roofing] Feast, and The Scapegoat, in which he could maintain a consistent tone and sense of atmosphere.

Also discusses four individual scenes from the film that are directly derivative of the play.\n\n85. ___ “Strindberg’s Folkungasagan and Bergman’s Det sjunde inseglet: Medieval Epic and Psychological Drama.” Scandinavica 27:1 (May 1979), pp. 21–34.\n\nPostulates a fundamental tension in both works between the “epic” and the “psychological” and investigates the ways in which this tension permeates setting, character, plot, visual motifs, and music.\n\n86. Johnson, Walter. “Creditors Reexamined,” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 278–90.\n\nChallenges the Swedish biographical approach to Strindberg’s drama and analyzes the play as a psychological ménage à trois, a marriage drama of universal interest.\n\n87. ___ “Gustaf Adolf Revised.” Scandinavian Studies for Henry Goddard Leach. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1965, pp. 236–46.\n\nDiscusses the cuts and changes suggested by Strindberg to make his long historical drama Gustaf Adolf more stage-worthy.\n\n88. Kaufman, K. J. “Strindberg: The Absence of Irony.” Drama Survey, 3 (1964), 463–76.\n\nArgues that in Strindberg, the normal boundaries between thought and act, interior and exterior reality, past and present are blurred or denied. He wrote gripping but incomplete plays, based on “a devastated vision of an absurd, divinely abandoned world.”\n\n89. Kaufman, Michael W. “Strindberg’s Historical Imagination: Erik XIV.” Comparative Drama, 9 (1975–76), 318–31.\n\nA reading of Erik XIV, not as a historical drama but “as a drama about history,” revealing Strindberg’s view of the past as “discontinuous, fragmented, and chaotic, where the only principles of order inhere in the mind of the individual perceiver.\n\n90. Lapisardi, Frederick S. “The Same Enemies: Notes in Certain Similarities between Yeats and Strindberg.” Modern Drama, 12 (1969), 146–54.\n\nAmong the similarities noted are: a desire to found an intimate theater; the use of national “sagas” as bases for plays; an influence from the Orient and the occult; their interest in the drama of Maeterlinck.\n\n91. Lawson, Stephen R. “Strindberg’s Dream Play and Ghost Sonata.” Yale Theatre, 5:2 (1974), pp. 95–102.\n\nA brief discussion of two of Strindberg’s post-Inferno plays in which an omnipresent dualism is noted; like Keats, Strindberg has an oxymoronic vision of life.\n\n92. Lewis, Leta Jane. “Alchemy and the Orient in Strindberg’s Dream Play,” Scandinavian Studies, 35 (1963), 208–22.\n\nAnalysis of a Dream Play with emphasis on concepts and symbols originating in Strindberg’s enthusiasm for alchemy and the Orient.\n\n93.

Lyons, Charles R. “The Archetypal Action of Male Submission in Strindberg’s The Father.” Scandinavian Studies, 36 (1964), 218–32.\n\nTraces the archetypal images in The Father of the demonic female and the apocalyptic male who succumbs to a demonic vision of the world and is destroyed by it.\n\n95. McNamara, Brooks. “Scene Design: 1876–1965. Ibsen, Chekhov, Strindberg.” Tulane Drama Review, 13:2 (T42), (Winter 1968), pp. 77–91.\n\nIllustrated discussion of productions of [There Are] Crimes and Crimes, The Father, Mother[ly] Love, and Miss Julie.\n\n96. Madsen, Børge Gedsø. “Naturalism in Transition: Strindberg’s ‘Cynical’ Tragedy The Bond.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 291–98.\n\nDiscusses Strindberg’s drama from 1892 as a work too subjective and one-sided to gratify entirely as a naturalistic drama. In addition its anthropomorphic references link The Bond with the post-Inferno period.\n\n97. Mays, Milton A. “Strindberg’s Ghost Sonata: Parodied Fairy Tale on Original Sin.” Modern Drama, 10 (1967), 189–94.\n\nArgues that The Ghost Sonata takes as its main structural mode the fairy tale, but is a parody of this literary genre in that Strindberg demonstrates the inevitable consequences of original sin.\n\n98. Milton, John. “A Restless Pilgrim: Strindberg in The Inferno.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 306–313.\n\nSees Strindberg in Inferno “as Everyman in a world of duality.” Strindberg makes conscious use of his personal experience to build a fable of modern man whose life is governed by the metaphor of coincidence. Swedenborg’s spiritualism comes to his aid but Strindberg is caught between two methods of structure—the logical and the nonlogical, frustrations Strindberg turns into art. Inferno is a record of the conditions of the artist.\n\n99. Oster, Rose-Marie. “Hamm and Hummel: Beckett and Strindberg on Human Condition.” Scandinavian Studies, 41 (1969), 330–43.\n\nA comparison between Beckett’s and Strindberg’s view of man as a tormented and tormenting creature in a shabby world, summed up in images of mud and enclosures.\n\n100. Parker, Gerald. “The Spectator Seized by the Theatre: Strindberg’s The Ghost Sonata.” Modern Drama, 15 (1972), 373–86.\n\nContends that in The Ghost Sonata language becomes a spectacle in itself, designed to act “physically” upon the spectator, rather than a means of rational discourse. In this sense Strindberg anticipates the drama of Ionesco.\n\n101. Paulson, Arvid. “The Father: A Survey of Critical Opinion of August Strindberg’s Tragedy and Leading American Performances of it During the Past Half Century.” The Strindberg Reader. Translated and edited by Arvid Paulson. New York: Phaedra, 1968, pp. 437–49. First published in Scandinavian Studies for Henry Goddard Leach.

Plasberg, Elaine. “Strindberg and the New Poetics.” Modern Drama, 15 (1972), 1–14.\n\nA discussion of The Dance of Death as “a mixture of hornpipes and funerals,” i.e., as an example of an impure dramatic genre, with special focus on the difficulties this creates for a director. Sees the play as “a caricature of tragedy,” representing the modern theater’s perspective on incongruity.\n\n104. Raphael, Robert. “Strindberg and Wagner.” Scandinavian Studies for Henry Goddard Leach. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1965, pp. 260–68.\n\nFocuses attention on Wagnerian features in Swanwhite and points out stylistic and thematic (Caritas or Love through Empathy) similarities between Wagner’s and Strindberg’s works.\n\n105.

Scobbie, Irene. “Strindberg and Lagerkvist.” Modern Drama, 7 (1964),126–34.\n\nA comparison between Strindberg’s To Damascus and Lagerkvist’s Sista mänskan, both of which employ a supernatural force as the antagonist, an emphasis on mood rather than analysis, and abstracted characters.”\n\n108. Sehmsdorf, Henning K. “August Strindberg’s Swanwhite and Scandinavian Folk Poetry: Idea and Form.” The Barat Review, 1:2 (June 1966), pp. 98–104.\n\nArgues that the basic characteristic of Strindberg’s stylistic method in Swanwhite is the transformation of certain formal traits of the folktale (scenery, plot, imagery) into forms functioning as symbols which serve to put forth the main idea of the play, Caritas, the Great Love.\n\n109. Senelick, Laurence. “Strindberg, Antoine and Lugné-Poë: A Study in Cross Purposes.” Modern Drama, 15 (1973), 391–402.\n\nAn analysis of Strindberg’s reception on the Parisian stage. Although produced by the leading theater experimenters in the French capital, Strindberg never became a widely discussed playwright in Paris.\n\n110. Sharp, Corona. “Dürrenmatt’s Play Strindberg.” Modern Drama, 13 (1970),276–83.\n\nA discussion of Dürrenmatt’s version of Strindberg’s The Dance of Death. Strindberg explores the motivation of marital warfare. Dürrenmatt studies only the battle tactics themselves.\n\n111. Sprinchorn, Evert. “The Logic of A Dreamplay.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962),352–65.\n\nA Freudian reading of A Dreamplay that sees the veiled sexual imagery, such as the castle and Fingal’s cave, as a unifying structural force in the drama.\n\n112. ___ “Strindberg and the Greater Naturalism.” Tulane Drama Review, 13:2 (Winter 1968), pp. 119–29.\n\nDiscusses Strindberg’s reaction against “lesser” or photographic Naturalism as presented in the essay “The Battle of the Brains” and calls him “a renewer of synthetic decor” and symbolic sets.\n\n113. ___ “Winning an Audience for Strindberg.” American Swedish Historical Foundation Yearbook (Philadelphia: American Swedish Historical Society, 1972), pp. 23–30.\n\nCalls for a less ponderous approach to the staging of Strindberg and a revision of him as a mad and melacholy Swede. Suggests that one way to save Strindberg in the theater would be to let glamorous actresses and handsome actors play the leading roles.\n\n114. ___ “The Zola of the Occult: Strindberg’s Experimental Method.” Modern Drama, 17 (1974), 250–66.\n\nExamines Strindberg’s intention of becoming “a Zola of the occult” after his Inferno period. The method he used was to examine his so-called hidden or subliminal self, thereby allowing us to follow step by step the process of his conversion. Emphasizes the importance of Kierkegaardian and Swedenborgian concepts.\n\n115. ___ “Hell and Purgatory in Strindberg.” Scandinavian Studies, 50 (1978), 371–80.\n\nMaintains that Swedenborg’s concept of devastation, i.e., a process where our external state is stripped and our internal self made visible, provides Strindberg with a dramatic device, whereby he can depict conversion on the stage.\n\nSee also entry nos. 7, 14, 15, 22, 31.\n\n116.

Stockenström, Göran. “The Journey from the Isle of Life to the Isle of the Dead: The Idea of Reconciliation in The Ghost Sonata.” Scandinavian Studies, 50 (1978), 133–49.\n\nArgues that The Ghost Sonata is representative of the whole body of chamber plays in maintaining an outer movement from reality to unreality, which has its thematic analogue in the dramatization of three spiritual stages: illusion, unmasking and resignation, all of which are part of a process of reconciliation.\n\n118. Syndergaard, Larry E. “The Skogsrå of Folklore and Strindberg’s The Crown Bride.” Comparative Drama, 6 (1972–73), 310–22.\n\nDiscusses the organic function of the skogsrå—midwife figure in Strindberg’s drama. It is a psychologically more complex figure than the skogsrå of folklore and affects four principal aspects of the play: plot, character, expressionist technique, and theme.\n\n119. Taylor, Marion A. “A Note on Strindberg’s The Dance of Death and Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Papers on Language and Literature, 2 (1966), 187–88.\n\nA brief comparison between the marital/sexual conflict in Strindberg’s and Albee’s plays.\n\n120.

Y (the silent woman) is the stronger at the end of the play. Törnqvist supports this with reference to Strindberg’s biography.\n\n121 ___. “Miss Julie and O’Neill.” Modern Drama, 19 (1976), 351–64.\n\nBoth the drama Miss Julie and Strindberg’s preface had an impact on O’Neill’s work, especially his Electra trilogy.

Vincentia, Sister, M.O.P. “Wagnerism in Road to Damascus.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 335–43.\n\nArgues that To Damascus shows analogies with the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk and displays a frequent borrowing from both music and dance. Other Wagnerian features are a symbolic use of folklore; a rhythmic use of language; and an emphasis on mise-en-scène in evoking a mood.\n\n123. Vowles, Richard B. “A Cook’s Tour of Strindberg Scholarship.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 256–68.\n\nAn introduction to Modern Drama’s commemorative issue in December 1962.\n\n124 ___. “Strindberg’s Isle of the Dead.” Modern Drama, 5 (1962), 366–78.\n\nA presentation of four dramatic fragments left by Strindberg and a translation of one of them.\n\n125.
