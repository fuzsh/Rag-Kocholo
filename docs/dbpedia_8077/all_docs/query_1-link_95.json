        "text": "A DREAM PLAY\n\nThe background represents a forest of gigantic hollyhocks in bloom. They are white, pink, crimson, sulphureous, violet; and above their tops is seen the gilded roof of a castle, the apex of which is formed by a bud resembling a crown. At the foot of the castle walls stand a number of straw ricks, and around these stable litter is scattered. The side-scenes, which remain unchanged throughout the play, show conventionalised frescoes, suggesting at once internal decoration, architecture, and landscape.\n\nEnter THE GLAZIER. and THE DAUGHTER.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. The castle is growing higher and higher above the ground. Do you see how much it has grown since last year?\n\nTHE GLAZIER. [To himself] I have never seen this castle before---have never heard of a castle that grew, but---[To THE DAUGHTER, with firm conviction] Yes, it has grown two yards, but that is because they have manured it---and it you notice, it has put out a wing on the sunny side.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Ought it not to be blooming soon, as we are already past midsummer?\n\nTHE GLAZIER. Don't you see the flower up there?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes, I see! [Claps her hands] Say, father, why do flowers grow out of dirt?\n\nTHE GLAZIER, [Simply] Because they do not feel at home in the dirt, and so they make haste to get up into the light in order to blossom and die.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Do you know who lives in that castle?\n\nTHE GLAZIER. I have known it, but cannot remember.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I believe a prisoner is kept there---and he must be waiting for me to set him free.\n\nTHE GLAZIER. And what is he to pay for it?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. One does not bargain about one's duty. Let us go into the castle.\n\nTHE GLAZIER. Yes, let us go in.\n\nThey go toward the background, which opens and slowly disappears to either side.\n\nThe stage shows now a humble, bare room, containing only a table and a few chairs. On one of the chairs sits an officer, dressed in a very unusual yet modern uniform. He is tilting the chair backward and beating the table with his sabre.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Goes to the officer, from whose hand she gently takes the sabre] Don't! Don't!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Oh, Agnes dear, let me keep the sabre.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. No, you break the table. [To THE GLAZIER.] Now you go down to the harness-room and fix that window pane. We'll meet later.\n\n[THE GLAZIER goes out.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You are imprisoned in your own rooms---I have come to set you free.\n\nTHE OFFICER. I have been waiting for you, but I was not sure you were willing to do it.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. The castle is strongly built; it has seven walls, but---it can be done!---Do you want it, or do you not?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Frankly speaking, I cannot tell---for in either case I shall suffer pain. Every joy that life brings has to be paid for with twice its measure of sorrow. It is hard to stay where I am, but if I buy the sweets of freedom, then I shall have to suffer twice as much---Agnes, I'll rather endure it as it is, if I can only see you.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What do you see in me?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Beauty, which is the harmony of the universe---There are lines of your body which are nowhere to be found, except in the orbits of the solar system, in strings that are singing softly, or in the vibrations of light---You are a child of heaven------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. So are you.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Why must I then keep horses, tend stable, and cart straw?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. So that you may long to get away from here.\n\nTHE OFFICER. I am longing, but it is so hard to find one's way out.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But it is a duty to seek freedom in the light.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Duty? Life has never recognised any duties toward me.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You feel yourself wronged by life?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Yes, it has been unjust------\n\nNow voices are heard from behind a 'partition, which a moment later is pulled away. THE OFFICER and THE DAUGHTER look in that direction and stop as if paralysed in the midst of a gesture.\n\nAt a table sits THE MOTHER, looking very sick. In front of her a tallow candle is burning, and every little while she trims it with, a pair of snuffers. The table is piled with new-made shirts, and these she is marking with a quill and ink. To the left stands a brown-coloured wardrobe.\n\nTHE FATHER. [Holds out a silk mantilla toward THE MOTHER and says gently] You don't want it?\n\nTHE MOTHER. A silk mantilla for me, my dear---of what use would that be when I am going to die shortly?\n\nTHE FATHER. Do you believe what the doctor says?\n\nTHE MOTHER. Yes, I believe also what he says, but still more what the voice says in here.\n\nTHE FATHER. [Sadly] It is true then?---And you are thinking of your children first and last.\n\nTHE MOTHER. That has been my life and my reason for living---my joy and my sorrow\n\nTHE FATHER. Christine, forgive me---everything!\n\nTHE MOTHER. What have I to forgive? Dearest, you forgive me! We have been tormenting each other. Why? That we may not know. We couldn't do anything else---However, here is the new linen for the children. See that they change twice a week---Wednesdays and Sundays---and that Louise washes them---their whole bodies---Are you going out?\n\nTHE FATHER. I have to be in the Department at eleven o'clock.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Ask Alfred to come in before you go.\n\nTHE FATHER. [Pointing to THE OFFICER] Why, he is standing right there, dear heart.\n\nTHE MOTHER. So my eyes are failing, too---Yes, it is turning dark. [Trims the candle] Come here, Alfred.\n\nTHE FATHER goes out through the middle of the wall, nodding good-bye as he leaves.\n\nTHE OFFICER goes over to THE MOTHER.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Who is that girl?\n\nTHE OFFICER, [Whispers] It is Agnes.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Oh, is that Agnes?---Do you know what they say?---That she is a daughter of the god Indra who has asked leave to descend to the earth in order that she may find out what the conditions of men are---But don't say anything about it.\n\nTHE OFFICER. A child of the gods, indeed!\n\nTHE MOTHER. [Aloud] My Alfred, I must soon part from you and from the other children---But let me first speak a word to you that bears on all the rest of your life.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Sadly] Speak, mother.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Only a word: don't quarrel with God!\n\nTHE OFFICER. What do you mean, mother?\n\nTHE MOTHER. Don't go around feeling that life has wronged you.\n\nTHE OFFICER. But when I am treated unjustly------\n\nTHE MOTHER. You are thinking of the time when you were unjustly punished for having taken a penny that later turned up?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Yes, and that one wrong gave a false twist to my whole life------\n\nTHE MOTHER. Perhaps. But please take a look into that wardrobe now------\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Embarrassed] You know, then? It is------\n\nTHE MOTHER. The Swiss Family Robinson---for which------\n\nTHE OFFICER. Don't say any more!\n\nTHE MOTHER. For which your brother was punished---and which you had torn and hidden away.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Just think that the old wardrobe is still standing there after twenty years---We have moved so many times, and my mother died ten years ago.\n\nTHE MOTHER. Yes, and what of it? You are always asking all sorts of questions, and in that way you spoil the better part of your life---There is Lena, now.\n\nLENA. [Enters] Thank you very much, ma'am, but I can't go to the baptism.\n\nTHE MOTHER. And why not, my girl?\n\nLENA. I have nothing to put on.\n\nTHE MOTHER. I'll let you use my mantilla here\n\nLENA. Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't do!\n\nTHE MOTHER. Why not?---It is not likely that I'll go to any more parties.\n\nTHE OFFICER. And what will father say? It is a present from him------\n\nTHE MOTHER. What small minds------\n\nTHE FATHER. [Puts his head through the wall] Are you going to lend my present to the servant girl?\n\nTHE MOTHER. Don't talk that way! Can you not remember that I was a servant girl also? Why should you offend one who has done nothing?\n\nTHE FATHER. Why should you offend me, your husband?\n\nTHE MOTHER. Oh, this life! If you do anything nice, there is always somebody who finds it nasty. If you act kindly to one, it hurts another. Oh, this life!\n\nShe trims the candle so that it goes out. The stage turns dark and the partition is pushed back to its former position.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Men are to be pitied.\n\nTHE OFFICER. You think so?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes, life is hard---but love overcomes everything. You shall see for yourself.\n\n[They go toward the background.\n\nThe background is raised and a new one revealed, showing an old, dilapidated party-wall. In the centre of it is a gate closing a passageway. This opens upon a green, sunlit space, where is seen a tremendous blue monk's-hood (aconite). To the left of the gate sits THE PORTRESS. Her head and shoulders are covered by a shawl, and she is crocheting at a bed-spread with a star-like pattern. To the right of the gate is a billboard, which THE BILLPOSTER is cleaning. Beside him stands a dipnet with a green pole. Further to the right is a door that has an air-hole shaped like a four-leaved clover. To the left of the gate stands a small linden tree with coal-black trunk and a few pale-green leaves. Near it is a small air-hole leading into a cellar.[[1]]\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Going to THE PORTRESS] Is the spread not done yet?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. No, dear. Twenty-six years on such a piece of work is not much.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And your lover never came back?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. No, but it was not his fault. He had to go---poor thing! That was thirty years ago now.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [To THE BILLPOSTER] She belonged to the ballet? Up there in the opera-house?\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. She was number one---but when he went, it was as if her dancing had gone with him---and so she didn't get any more parts.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Everybody complains---with their eyes, at least, and often with words also------\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. I don't complain very much---not now, since I have a dipnet and a green cauf------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And that can make you happy?\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. Oh, I'm so happy, so---It was the dream of my youth, and now it has come true. Of course, I have grown to be fifty years------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Fifty years for a dipnet and a cauf------\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. A green cauf---mind you, green------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [To THE PORTRESS] Let me have the shawl now, and I shall sit here and watch the human children. But you must stand behind me and tell me about everything.\n\n[She takes the shawl and sits down at the gate.\n\nTHE PORTRESS. This is the last day, and the house will be closed up for the season. This is the day when they learn whether their contracts are to be renewed.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And those that fail of engagement------\n\nTHE PORTRESS. O, Lord have mercy! I pull the shawl over my head not to see them.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Poor human creatures!\n\nTHE PORTRESS. Look, here comes one---She's not one of the chosen. See, how she cries.\n\nTHE SINGER enters from the right; rushes through the gate with her handkerchief to her eyes; stops for a moment in the passageway beyond the gate and leans her head against the wall; then out quickly.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Men are to be pitied!\n\nTHE PORTRESS. But look at this one. That's the way a happy person looks.\n\nTHE OFFICER enters through the passageway; dressed in Prince Albert coat and high hat, and carrying a bunch of roses in one hand; he is radiantly happy.\n\nTHE PORTRESS. He's going to marry Miss Victoria.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Far down on the stage, looks up and sings] Victoria!\n\nTHE PORTRESS. The young lady will be coming in a moment.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Good! The carriage is waiting, the table is set, the wine is on ice---Oh, permit me to embrace you, ladies! [He embraces THE PORTRESS and THE DAUGHTER. Sings] Victoria!\n\nA WOMAN'S VOICE FROM ABOVE. [Sings] I am here!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Do you know me?\n\nTHE OFFICER. No, I know one woman only---Victoria. Seven years I have come here to wait for her---at noon, when the sun touched the chimneys, and at night, when it was growing dark. Look at the asphalt here, and you will see the path worn by the steps of a faithful lover. Hooray! She is mine. [Sings] Victoria! [There is no reply] Well, she is dressing, I suppose. [To THE BILLPOSTER] There is the dipnet, I see. Everybody belonging to the opera is crazy about dipnets---or rather about fishes---because the fishes are dumb and cannot sing!---What is the price of a thing like that?\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. It is rather expensive.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Sings] Victoria! [Shakes the linden tree] Look, it is turning green once more. For the eighth time. [Sings] Victoria!---Now she is fixing her hair. [To THE DAUGHTER] Look here, madam, could I not go up and get my bride?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. Nobody is allowed on the stage.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Seven years I have been coming here. Seven times three hundred and sixty-five makes two thousand five hundred and fifty-five. [Stops and pokes at the door with the four-leaved clover hole] And I have been looking two thousand five hundred and fifty-five times at that door without discovering where it leads. And that clover leaf which is to let in light---for whom is the light meant? Is there anybody within? Does anybody live there?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. I don't know. I have never seen it opened.\n\nTHE OFFICER. It looks like a pantry door which I saw once when I was only four years old and went visiting with the maid on a Sunday afternoon. We called at several houses---on other maids---but I did not get beyond the kitchen anywhere, and I had to sit between the water barrel and the salt box. I have seen so many kitchens in my days, and the pantry was always just outside, with small round holes bored in the door, and one big hole like a clover leaf---But there cannot be any pantry in the opera-house as they have no kitchen. [Sings] Victoria!---Tell me, madam, could she have gone out any other way?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. No, there is no other way.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Well, then I shall see her here.\n\nSTAGE PEOPLE rush out and are closely watched by THE OFFICER as they pass.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Now she must soon be coming---Madam, that blue monk's-hood outside---I have seen it since I was a child. Is it the same?---I remember it from a country rectory where I stopped when I was seven years old---There are two doves, two blue doves, under the hood---but that time a bee came flying and went into the hood. Then I thought: now I have you! And I grabbed hold of the flower. But the sting of the bee went through it, and I cried---but then the rector's wife came and put damp dirt on the sting---and we had strawberries and cream for dinner---I think it is getting dark already. [To THE BILLPOSTER] Where are you going?\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. Home for supper.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Draws his hand across his eyes] Evening? At this time?---O, please, may I go in and telephone to the Growing Castle?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What do you want there?\n\nTHE OFFICER. I am going to tell the Glazier to put in double windows, for it will soon be winter, and I am feeling horribly cold. [Goes into the gatekeeper's lodge.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Who is Miss Victoria?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. His sweetheart.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Right said! What she is to us and others matters nothing to him. And what she is to him, that alone is her real self.\n\nIt is suddenly turning dark.\n\nTHE PORTRESS. [Lights a lantern] It is growing dark early to-day.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. To the gods a year is as a minute.\n\nTHE PORTRESS. And to men a minute may be as long as a year.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Enters again, looking dusty; the roses are withered] She has not come yet?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. No.\n\nTHE OFFICER. But she will come---She will come! [Walks up and down] But come to think of it, perhaps I had better call off the dinner after all---as it is late? Yes, I will do that.\n\n[Goes back into the lodge and telephones.\n\nTHE PORTRESS. [To THE DAUGHTER] Can I have my shawl back now?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. No, dear, be free a while. I shall attend to your duties---for I want to study men and life, and see whether things really are as bad as they say.\n\nTHE PORTRESS. But it won't do to fall asleep here---never sleep night or day------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. No sleep at night?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. Yes, if you are able to get it, but only with the bell string tied around the wrist---for there are night watchmen on the stage, and they have to be relieved every third hour.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But that is torture!\n\nTHE PORTRESS. So you think, but people like us are glad enough to get such a job, and if you only knew how envied I am------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Envied?---Envy for the tortured?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. Yes---But I can tell you what is harder than all drudging and keeping awake nights, harder to bear than draught and cold and dampness---it is to receive the confidences of all the unhappy people up there---They all come to me. Why? Perhaps they read in the wrinkles of my face some runes that are graved by suffering and that invite confessions---In that shawl, dear, lie hidden thirty years of my own and other people's agonies.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It is heavy, and it burns like nettles.\n\nTHE PORTRESS. As it is your wish, you may wear it. When it grows too burdensome, call me, and I shall relieve you.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Good-bye. What can be done by you ought not to surpass my strength.\n\nTHE PORTRESS. We shall see!---But be kind to my poor friends, and don't grow impatient of their complaints.\n\n[She disappears through the passageway. Complete darkness covers the stage, and while it lasts the scene is changed so that the linden tree appears stripped of all its leaves. Soon the blue monk's-hood is withered, and when the light returns, the verdure in the open space beyond the passageway has changed into autumnal brown.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Enters when it is light again. He has gray hair and a gray beard. His clothes are shabby, his collar is soiled and wrinkled. Nothing but the bare stems remain of the bunch of roses. He walks to and fro] To judge by all signs, Summer is gone and Fall has come. The linden shows it, and the monk's-hood also. [Walks] But the Fall is my Spring, for then the opera begins again, and then she must come. Please, madam, may I sit down a little on this chair?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes, sit down, friend---I am able to stand.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Sits down] If I could only get some sleep, then I should feel better---[He falls asleep for a few moments. Then he jumps up and walks back and forth again. Stops at last in front of the door with the clover leaf and pokes at] This door here will not leave me any peace---what is behind it? There must be something. [Faint dance music is heard from above] Oh, now the rehearsals have begun. [The light goes out and flares up again, repeating this rhythmically as the rays of a lighthouse come and go] What does this mean? [Speaking in time with the blinkings of the light] Light and dark---light and dark?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Imitating him] Night and day---night and day! A merciful Providence wants to shorten your wait. Therefore the days are flying in hot pursuit of the nights.\n\nThe light shines unbrokenly once more.\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER enters with his dipnet and his implements.\n\nTHE OFFICER. There is the Billposter with his dipnet. Was the fishing good?\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. I should say so. The Summer was hot and a little long---the net turned out pretty good, but not as I had expected.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [With emphasis] Not as I had expected!---That is well said. Nothing ever was as I expected it to be---because the thought is more than the deed, more than the thing.\n\nWalks to and fro, striking at the wall with the rose stems so that the last few leaves fall off.\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. Has she not come down yet?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Not yet, but she will soon be here---Do you know what is behind that door, Billposter?\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. No, I have never seen that door open yet.\n\nTHE OFFICER. I am going to telephone for a locksmith to come and open it. [Goes into the lodge.\n\n[THE BILLPOSTER posts a bill and goes toward the right.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What is the matter with the dipnet?\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. Matter? Well, I don't know as there is anything the matter with it---but it just didn't turn out as I had expected, and the pleasure of it was not so much after all.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. How did you expect it to be?\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. How?---Well, I couldn't tell exactly------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I can tell you! You had expected it to be what it was not. It had to be green, but not that kind of green.\n\nTHE BILLPOSTER. You have it, madam. You understand it all---and that is why everybody goes to you with his worries. If you would only listen to me a little also------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Of course, I will!---Come in to me and pour out your heart. [She goes into the lodge.\n\n[THE BILLPOSTER remains outside, speaking to her. The stage is darkened again. When the light is turned on, the tree has resumed its leaves, the monk's-hood is blooming once more, and the sun is shining on the green space beyond the passageway.\n\nTHE OFFICER enters. Now he is old and white-haired, ragged, and wearing worn-out shoes. He carries the bare remnants of the rose stems. Walks to and fro slowly, with the gait of an aged man. Reads on the posted bill.\n\nA BALLET GIRL comes in from the right.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Is Miss Victoria gone?\n\nTHE BALLET GIRL. No, she has not gone yet.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Then I shall wait. She will be coming soon, don't you think?\n\nTHE BALLET GIRL. Oh, yes, I am sure.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Don't go away now, for I have sent word to the locksmith, so you will soon see what is behind that door.\n\nTHE BALLET GIRL. Oh, it will be awfully interesting to see that door opened. That door, there, and the Growing Castle---have you heard of the Growing Castle?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Have I?---I have been a prisoner in it.\n\nTHE BALLET GIRL. No, was that you? But why do they keep such a lot of horses there?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Because it is a stable castle, don't you know.\n\nTHE BALLET GIRL. [With confusion] How stupid of me not to guess that!\n\nA MALE CHORUS SINGER enters from the right.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Has Miss Victoria gone yet?\n\nTHE CHORUS SINGER. [Earnestly] No, she has not. She never goes away.\n\nTHE OFFICER. That is because she loves me---See here, don't go before the locksmith comes to open the door here.\n\nTHE CHORUS SINGER. No, is the door going to be opened? Well, that will be fun!---I just want to ask the Portress something.\n\nTHE PROMPTER enters from the right.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Is Miss Victoria gone yet?\n\nTHE PROMPTER. Not that I know of.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Now, didn't I tell you she was waiting for me!---Don't go away, for the door is going to be opened.\n\nTHE PROMPTER. Which door?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Is there more than one door?\n\nTHE PROMPTER. Oh, I know---that one with the clover leaf. Well, then I have got to stay---I am only going to have a word with the Portress.\n\nTHE BALLET GIRL, THE CHORUS SINGER, and THE PROMPTER gather beside THE BILLPOSTER in front of the lodge window and talk by turns to THE DAUGHTER.\n\nTHE GLAZIER. enters through the gate.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Are you the locksmith?\n\nTHE GLAZIER. No, the locksmith had visitors, and a glazier will do just as well.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Yes, of course, of course---but did you bring your diamond along?\n\nTHE GLAZIER. Why, certainly!---A glazier without his diamond, what would that be?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Nothing at all!---Let us get to work then.\n\n[Claps his hands together.\n\nALL gather in a ring around the door.\n\nMale members of the chorus dressed as Master Singers and Ballet Girls in costumes from the opera \"Aïda\" enter from the right and join the rest.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Locksmith---or glazier---do your duty!\n\nTHE GLAZIER goes up to the door with the diamond in his hand.\n\nTHE OFFICER. A moment like this will not occur twice in a man's life. For this reason, my friends, I ask you---please consider carefully------\n\nA POLICEMAN. [Enters] In the name of the law, I forbid the opening of that door!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Oh, Lord! What a fuss there is as soon as anybody wants to do anything new or great. But we will take the matter into court---let us go to the Lawyer. Then we shall see whether the laws still exist or not---Come along to the Lawyer.\n\nWithout lowering of the curtain, the stage changes to a lawyer's office, and in this manner. The gate remains, but as a wicket in the railing running clear across the stage. The gatekeeper's lodge turns into the private enclosure of the Lawyer, and it is now entirely open to the front. The linden, leafless, becomes a hat tree. The billboard is covered with legal notices and court decisions. The door with the four-leaved clover hole forms part of a document chest.\n\nTHE LAWYER, in evening dress and white necktie, is found sitting to the left, inside the gate, and in front of him stands a desk covered with papers. His appearance indicates enormous sufferings. His face is chalk-white and full of wrinkles, and its shadows have a purple effect. He is ugly, and his features seem to reflect all the crimes and vices with which he has been forced by his profession to come into contact.\n\nOf his two clerks, one has lost an arm, the other an eye.\n\nThe people gathered to witness \"the opening of the door\" remain as before, bid they appear now to be waiting for an audience with the Lawyer. Judging by their attitudes, one would think they had been standing there forever.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER, still wearing the shawl, and THE OFFICER are near the footlights.\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Goes over to THE DAUGHTER] Tell me, sister, can I have that shawl? I shall keep it here until I have a fire in my grate, and then I shall burn it with all its miseries and sorrows.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Not yet, brother. I want it to hold all it possibly can, and I want it above all to take up your agonies ---all the confidences you have received about crime, vice, robbery, slander, abuse------\n\nTHE LAWYER. My dear girl, for such a purpose your shawl would prove totally insufficient. Look at these walls. Does it not look as if the wall-paper itself had been soiled by every conceivable sin? Look at these documents into which I write tales of wrong. Look at myself---No smiling man ever comes here; nothing is to be seen here but angry glances, snarling lips, clenched fists---And everybody pours his anger, his envy, his suspicions, upon me. Look---my hands are black, and no washing will clean them. See how they are chapped and bleeding---I can never wear my clothes more than a few days because they smell of other people's crimes---At times I have the place fumigated with sulphur, but it does not help. I sleep near by, and I dream of nothing but crimes---Just now I have a murder case in court---oh, I can stand that, but do you know what is worse than anything else?---That is to separate married people! Then it is as if something cried way down in the earth and up there in the sky---as if it cried treason against the primal force, against the source of all good, against love---And do you know, when reams of paper have been filled with mutual accusations, and at last a sympathetic person takes one of the two apart and asks, with a pinch of the ear or a smile, the simple question: what have you really got against your husband?---or your wife?---then he, or she, stands perplexed and cannot give the cause. Once---well, I think a lettuce salad was the principal issue; another time it was just a word---mostly it is nothing at all. But the tortures, the sufferings---these I have to bear---See how I look! Do you think I could ever win a woman's love with this countenance so like a criminal's? Do you think anybody dares to be friendly with me, who has to collect all the debts, all the money obligations, of the whole city?---It is a misery to be man!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Men are to be pitied!\n\nTHE LAWYER. They are. And what people are living on puzzles me. They marry on an income of two thousand, when they need four thousand. They borrow, of course---everybody borrows. In some sort of happy-go-lucky fashion, by the skin of their teeth, they manage to pull through---and thus it continues to the end, when the estate is found to be bankrupt. Who pays for it at last no one can tell.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Perhaps He who feeds the birds.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Perhaps. But if He who feeds the birds would only pay a visit to this earth of His and see for Himself how the poor human creatures fare---then His heart would surely fill with compassion.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Men are to be pitied!\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes, that is the truth!---[To THE OFFICER] What do you want?\n\nTHE OFFICER. I just wanted to ask if Miss Victoria has gone yet.\n\nTHE LAWYER. No, she has not; you can be sure of it---Why are you poking at my chest over there?\n\nTHE OFFICER. I thought the door of it looked exactly------\n\nTHE LAWYER. Not at all! Not at all!\n\nAll the church bells begin to ring.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Is there going to be a funeral?\n\nTHE LAWYER. No, it is graduation day---a number of degrees will be conferred, and I am going to be made a Doctor of Laws. Perhaps you would also like to be graduated and receive a laurel wreath?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Yes, why not. That would be a diversion, at least.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Perhaps then we may begin upon this solemn function at once---But you had better go home and change your clothes.\n\n[THE OFFICER goes out.\n\nThe stage is darkened and the following changes are made. The railing stays, but it encloses now the chancel of a church. The billboard displays hymn numbers. The linden hat tree becomes a candelabrum. The Lawyer's desk is turned into the desk of the presiding functionary, and the door with the clover leaf leads to the vestry.\n\nThe chorus of Master Singers become heralds with staffs, and the Ballet Girls carry laurel wreaths. The rest of the people act as spectators.\n\nThe background is raised, and the new one thus discovered represents a large church organ, with the keyboards below and the organist's mirror above.\n\nMusic is heard. At the sides stand figures symbolising the four academic faculties: Philosophy, Theology, Medicine, and Jurisprudence.\n\nAt first the stage is empty for a few moments.\n\nHERALDS enter from the right.\n\nBALLET GIRLS follow with laurel wreaths carried high before them.\n\nTHREE GRADUATES appear one after another from the left, receive their wreaths from the BALLET GIRLS, and go out to the right.\n\nTHE LAWYER steps forward to get his wreath.\n\nThe BALLET GIRLS turn away from him and refuse to place the wreath on his head. Then they withdraw from the stage.\n\nTHE LAWYER, shocked, leans against a column. All the others withdraw gradually until only THE LAWYER remains on the stage.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Enters, her head and shoulders covered by a white veil] Do you see, I have washed the shawl! But why are you standing there? Did you get your wreath?\n\nTHE LAWYER. No, I was not held worthy.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Why? Because you have defended the poor, put in a good word for the wrong-doing, made the burden easier for the guilty, obtained a respite for the condemned? Woe upon men: they are not angels---but they are to be pitied!\n\nTHE LAWYER. Say nothing evil of men---for after all it is my task to voice their side.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Leaning against the organ] Why do they strike their friends in the face?\n\nTHE LAWYER. They know no better.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Let us enlighten them. Will you try? Together with me?\n\nTHE LAWYER. They do not accept enlightenment---Oh, that our plaint might reach the gods of heaven!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It shall reach the throne---[Turns toward the organ] Do you know what I see in this mirror?---The world turned the right way!---Yes indeed, for naturally we see it upside down.\n\nTHE LAWYER. How did it come to be turned the wrong way?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. When the copy was taken------\n\nTHE LAWYER. You have said it! The copy---I have always had the feeling that it was a spoiled copy. And when I began to recall the original images, I grew dissatisfied with everything. But men called it soreheadedness, looking at the world through the devil's eyes, and other such things.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It is certainly a crazy world! Look at the four faculties here. The government, to which has fallen the task of preserving society, supports all four of them. Theology, the science of God, is constantly attacked and ridiculed by philosophy, which declares itself to be the sum of all wisdom. And medicine is always challenging philosophy, while refusing entirely to count theology a science and even insisting on calling it a mere superstition. And they belong to a common Academic Council, which has been set to teach the young respect---for the university. It is a bedlam. And woe unto him who first recovers his reason!\n\nTHE LAWYER. Those who find it out first are the theologians. As a preparatory study, they take philosophy, which teaches them that theology is nonsense. Later they learn from theology that philosophy is nonsense. Madmen, I should say!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And then there is jurisprudence which serves all but the servants.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Justice, which, when it wants to do right, becomes the undoing of men. Equity, which so often turns into iniquity!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What a mess you have made of it, you man-children. Children, indeed!---Come here, and I will give you a wreath---one that is more becoming to you. [Puts a crown of thorns on his head] And now I will play for you.\n\nShe sits down at the keyboards, but instead of organ-notes human voices are heard.\n\nVOICES OF CHILDREN. O Lord everlasting!\n\n[Last note sustained.\n\nVOICES OF WOMEN. Have mercy upon us!\n\n[Last note sustained.\n\nVOICES OF MEN. [Tenors] Save us for Thy mercy's sake!\n\n[Last note sustained.\n\nVOICES OF MEN. [Basses] Spare Thy children, O Lord, and deliver us from Thy wrath!\n\nALL. Have mercy upon us! Hear us! Have pity upon the mortals!---? O Lord eternal, why art Thou afar?---Out of the depths we call unto Thee: Make not the burden of Thy children too heavy! Hear us! Hear us!\n\nThe stage turns dark. THE DAUGHTER rises and draws close to THE LAWYER. By a change of light, the organ becomes Fingal's Cave. The ground-swell of the ocean, which can be seen rising and falling between the columns of basalt, produces a deep harmony that blends the music of winds and waves.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Where are we, sister?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What do you hear?\n\nTHE LAWYER. I hear drops falling------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Those are the tears that men are weeping---What more do you hear?\n\nTHE LAWYER. There is sighing---and whining---and wailing------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Hither the plaint of the mortals has reached---and no farther. But why this never-ending wailing? Is there then nothing in life to rejoice at?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes, what is most sweet, and what is also most bitter---love---wife and home---the highest and the lowest!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. May I try it?\n\nTHE LAWYER. With me?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. With you---You know the rocks, the stumbling-stones. Let us avoid them.\n\nTHE LAWYER. I am so poor.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What does that matter if we only love each other? And a little beauty costs nothing.\n\nTHE LAWYER. I have dislikes which may prove your likes.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. They can be adjusted.\n\nTHE LAWYER. And if we tire of it?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Then come the children and bring with them a diversion that remains for ever new.\n\nTHE LAWYER. You, you will take me, poor and ugly, scorned and rejected?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes---let us unite our destinies.\n\nTHE LAWYER. So be it then!\n\nCurtain.\n\nThough the author says nothing about it here, subsequent stage directions indicate a door and a window behind the place occupied by THE PORTRESS. Both lead into her room or lodge, which contains a telephone.\n\nA floating wooden box with holes in it used to hold fish.\n\nAn extremely plain room inside THE LAWYER's office. To the right, a big double bed covered by a canopy and curtained in. Next to it, a window. To the left, an iron heater with cooking utensils on top of it. CHRISTINE is pasting paper strips along the cracks of the double windows. In the background, an open door to the office. Through the door are visible a number of poor clients waiting for admission.\n\nCHRISTINE. I paste, I paste.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Pale and emaciated, sits by the stove] You shut out all the air. I choke!\n\nCHRISTINE. Now there is only one little crack left.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Air, air---I cannot breathe!\n\nCHRISTINE. I paste, I paste.\n\nTHE LAWYER. That's right, Christine! Heat is expensive.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Oh, it feels as if my lips were being glued together.\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Standing in the doorway, with a paper in his hand] Is the child asleep?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes, at last.\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Gently] All this crying scares away my clients.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Pleasantly] What can be done about it?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Nothing.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. We shall have to get a larger place.\n\nTHE LAWYER. We have no money for it.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. May I open the window---this bad air is suffocating.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Then the heat escapes, and we shall be cold.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It is horrible!---May we clean up out there?\n\nTHE LAWYER. You have not the strength to do any cleaning, nor have I, and Christine must paste. She must put strips through the whole house, on every crack, in the ceiling, in the floor, in the walls.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Poverty I was prepared for, but not for dirt.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Poverty is always dirty, relatively speaking.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. This is worse than I dreamed!\n\nTHE LAWYER. We are not the worst off by far. There is still food in the pot.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But what sort of food?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Cabbage is cheap, nourishing, and good to eat.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. For those who like cabbage---to me it is repulsive.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Why didn't you say so?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Because I loved you, I wanted to sacrifice my own taste.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Then I must sacrifice my taste for cabbage to you---for sacrifices must be mutual.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What are we to eat, then? Fish? But you hate fish?\n\nTHE LAWYER. And it is expensive.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. This is worse than I thought it!\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Kindly] Yes, you see how hard it is---And the child that was to become a link and a blessing---it becomes our ruin.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Dearest, I die in this air, in this room, with its backyard view, with its baby cries and endless hours of sleeplessness, with those people out there, and their whinings, and bickerings, and incriminations---I shall die here!\n\nTHE LAWYER. My poor little flower, that has no light and no air------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And you say that people exist who are still worse off?\n\nTHE LAWYER. I belong with the envied ones in this locality.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Everything else might be borne if I could only have some beauty in my home.\n\nTHE LAWYER. I know you are thinking of flowers---and especially of heliotropes---but a plant costs half a dollar, which will buy us six quarts of milk or a peck of potatoes.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I could gladly get along without food if I could only have some flowers.\n\nTHE LAWYER. There is a kind of beauty that costs nothing---but the absence of it in the home is worse than any other torture to a man with a sense for the beautiful.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What is it?\n\nTHE LAWYER. If I tell, you will get angry.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. We have agreed not to get angry.\n\nTHE LAWYER. We have agreed---Everything can be over-come, Agnes, except the short, sharp accents---Do you know them? Not yet!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. They will never be heard between us.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Not as far as it lies on me!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Tell me now.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Well---when I come into a room, I look first of all at the curtains---[Goes over to the window and straightens out the curtains] If they hang like ropes or rags, then I leave soon. And next I take a glance at the chairs---if they stand straight along the wall, then I stay. [Puts a chair back against the wall] Finally I look at the candles in their sticks---if they point this way and that, then the whole house is askew. [Straightens up a candle on the chest of drawers] This is the kind of beauty, dear heart, that costs nothing.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. With bent head] Beware of the short accents, Axel!\n\nTHE LAWYER. They were not short.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes, they were.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Well, I'll be------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What kind of language is that?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Pardon me, Agnes! But I have suffered as much from your lack of orderliness as you have suffered from dirt. And I have not dared to set things right myself, for when I do so, you get as angry as if I were reproaching you---ugh! Hadn't we better quit now?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It is very difficult to be married---it is more difficult than anything else. One has to be an angel, I think!\n\nTHE LAWYER. I think so, too.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I fear I shall begin to hate you after this!\n\nTHE LAWYER. Woe to us then!---But let us forestall hatred. I promise never again to speak of any untidiness---although it is torture to me!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And I shall eat cabbage though it means agony to me.\n\nTHE LAWYER. A life of common suffering, then! One's pleasure, the other one's pain!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Men are to be pitied!\n\nTHE LAWYER. You see that?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes, but for heaven's sake, let us avoid the rocks, now when we know them so well.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Let us try! Are we not decent and intelligent persons? Able to forbear and forgive?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Why not smile at mere trifles?\n\nTHE LAWYER. We---only we---can do so. Do you know, I read this morning---by the bye, where is the newspaper?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Embarrassed] Which newspaper?\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Sharply] Do I keep more than one?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Smile now, and don't speak sharply---I used your paper to make the fire with------\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Violently] Well, I'll be damned!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Why don't you smile?---I burned it because it ridiculed what is holy to me.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Which is unholy to me! Yah! [Strikes one clenched fist against the open palm of the other hand] I smile, I smile so that my wisdom teeth show---Of course, I am to be nice, and I am to swallow my own opinions, and say yes to everything, and cringe and dissemble! [Tidies the curtains around the bed] That's it! Now I am going to fix things until you get angry again---Agnes, this is simply impossible!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Of course it is!\n\nTHE LAWYER. And yet we must endure---not for the sake of our promises, but for the sake of the child!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You are right---for the sake of the child. Oh, oh---we have to endure!\n\nTHE LAWYER. And now I must go out to my clients. Listen to them---how they growl with impatience to tear each other, to get each other fined and jailed---Lost souls!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Poor, poor people! And this pasting!\n\n[She drops her head forward in dumb despair.\n\nCHRISTINE. I paste, I paste.\n\nTHE LAWYER stands at the door, twisting the door-knob nervously.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. How that knob squeaks! It is as if you were twisting my heart-strings------\n\nTHE LAWYER. I twist, I twist!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Don't!\n\nTHE LAWYER. I twist!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. No!\n\nTHE LAWYER. I------\n\nTHE OFFICER. [In the office, on the other side of the door, takes hold of the knob] Will you permit me?\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Lets go his hold] By all means. Seeing that you have your degree!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Now all life belongs to me. Every road lies open. I have mounted Parnassus. The laurel is won. Immortality, fame, all is mine!\n\nTHE LAWYER. And what are you going to live on?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Live on?\n\nTHE LAWYER. You must have a home, clothes, food------\n\nTHE OFFICER. Oh, that will come---if you can only find somebody to love you!\n\nTHE LAWYER. You don't say so!---You don't---Paste, Christine, paste until they cannot breathe!\n\n[Goes out backward, nodding.\n\nCHRISTINE. I paste, I paste---until they cannot breathe.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Will you come with me now?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. At once! But where?\n\nTHE OFFICER. To Fairhaven. There it is summer; there the sun is shining; there we find youth, children, and flowers, singing and dancing, feasting and frolicking.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Then I will go there.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Come!\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Enters again] Now I go back to my first hell---this was the second and greater. The sweeter the hell, the greater---And look here, now she has been dropping hair-pins on the floor again. [He picks up some hair-pins.\n\nTHE OFFICER. My! but he has discovered the pins also.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Also?---Look at this one. You see two prongs, but it is only one pin. It is two, yet only one. If I bend it open, it is a single piece. If I bend it back, there are two, but they remain one for all that. It means: these two are one. But if I break---like this!---then they become two.\n\n[Breaks the pin and throws the pieces away.\n\nTHE OFFICER. All that he has seen!---But before breaking, the prongs must diverge. If they point together, then it holds.\n\nTHE LAWYER. And if they are parallel, then they will never meet---and it neither breaks nor holds.\n\nTHE OFFICER. The hair-pin is the most perfect of all created things. A straight line which equals two parallel ones.\n\nTHE LAWYER. A lock that shuts when it is open.\n\nTHE OFFICER. And thus shuts in a braid of hair that opens up when the lock shuts.\n\nTHE LAWYER. It is like this door. When I close it, then I open---the way out---for you, Agnes!\n\n[Withdraws and closes the door behind him.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Well then?\n\nThe stage changes. The bed with its curtains becomes a tent.\n\nThe stove stays as it was. The background is raised. To the right, in the foreground, are seen hills stripped of their trees by fire, and red heather growing between the blackened tree stumps. Red-painted pig-sties and outhouses. Beyond these, in the open, apparatus for mechanical gymnastics, where sick persons are being treated on machines resembling instruments of torture.\n\nTo the left, in the foreground, the quarantine station, consisting of open sheds, with ovens, furnaces, and pipe coils.\n\nIn the middle distance, a narrow strait.\n\nThe background shows a beautiful wooded shore. Flags are flying on its piers, where ride white sailboats, some with sails set and some without. Little Italian villas, pavilions, arbors, marble statues are glimpsed through the foliage along the shore.\n\nTHE MASTER OF QUARANTINE, made up like a blackamoor, is walking along the shore.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Meets him and they shake hands] Why, Ordström! Have you landed here?\n\nMASTER OF Q. Yes, here I am.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Is this Fairhaven?\n\nMASTER OF Q. No, that is on the other side. This is Foulstrand.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Then we have lost our way.\n\nMASTER OF Q. We?---Won't you introduce me?\n\nTHE OFFICER. No, that wouldn't do. [In a lowered voice] It is Indra's own daughter.\n\nMASTER OF Q. Indra's? And I was thinking of Varuna himself---Well, are you not surprised to find me black in the face?\n\nTHE OFFICER. I am past fifty, my boy, and at that age one has ceased to be surprised. I concluded at once that you were bound for some fancy ball this afternoon.\n\nMASTER OF Q. Right you were! And I hope both of you will come along.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Why, yes---for I must say---the place does not look very tempting. What kind of people live here anyhow?\n\nMASTER OF Q. Here you find the sick; over there, the healthy.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Nothing but poor folk on this side, I suppose.\n\nMASTER OF Q. No, my boy, it is here you find the rich. Look at that one on the rack. He has stuffed himself with paté de foie gras and truffles and Burgundy until his feet have grown knotted.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Knotted?\n\nMASTER OF Q. Yes, he has a case of knotted feet. And that one who lies under the guillotine---he has swilled brandy so that his backbone has to be put through the mangle.\n\nTHE OFFICER. There is always something amiss!\n\nMASTER OF Q. Moreover, everybody living on this side has some kind of canker to hide. Look at the fellow coming here, for instance.\n\nAn old dandy is pushed on the stage in a wheel-chair, he is accompanied by a gaunt and grisly coquette in the sixties, to whom THE FRIEND, a man of about forty, is paying court.\n\nTHE OFFICER. It is the major---our schoolmate!\n\nMASTER OF Q. Don Juan. Can you see that he is still enamored of that old spectre beside him? He does not notice that she has grown old, or that she is ugly, faithless, cruel.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Why, that is love! And I couldn't have dreamt that a fickle fellow like him would prove capable of loving so deeply and so earnestly.\n\nMASTER OF Q. That is a mighty decent way of looking at it.\n\nTHE OFFICER. I have been in love with Victoria myself---in fact I am still waiting for her in the passageway------\n\nMASTER OF Q. Oh, you are the fellow who is waiting in the passageway?\n\nTHE OFFICER. I am the man.\n\nMASTER OF Q. Well, have you got that door opened yet?\n\nTHE OFFICER. No, the case is still in court---THE BILLPOSTER is out with his dipnet, of course, so that the taking of evidence is always being put off---and in the meantime the Glazier has mended all the window panes in the castle, which has grown half a story higher---This has been an uncommonly good year---warm and wet------\n\nMASTER OF Q. But just the same you have had no heat comparing with what I have here.\n\nTHE OFFICER. How much do you have in your ovens?\n\nMASTER OF Q. When we fumigate cholera suspects, we run it up to one hundred and forty degrees.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Is the cholera going again?\n\nMASTER OF Q. Don't you know that?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Of course, I know it, but I forget so often what I know.\n\nMASTER OF Q. I wish often that I could forget---especially myself. That is why I go in for masquerades and carnivals and amateur theatricals.\n\nTHE OFFICER. What have you been up to then?\n\nMASTER OF Q. If I told, they would say that I was boasting; and if I don't tell, then they call me a hypocrite.\n\nTHE OFFICER. That is why you blackened your face?\n\nMASTER OF Q. Exactly---making myself a shade blacker than I am.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Who is coming there?\n\nMASTER OF Q. Oh, a poet who is going to have his mud bath.\n\nTHE POET enters with his eyes raised toward the sky and carrying a pail of mud in one hand.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Why, he ought to be having light baths and air baths.\n\nMASTER OF Q. No, he is roaming about the higher regions so much that he gets homesick for the mud---and wallowing in the mire makes the skin callous like that of a pig. Then he cannot feel the stings of the wasps.\n\nTHE OFFICER. This is a queer world, full of contradictions.\n\nTHE POET. [Ecstatically] Man was created by the god Phtah out of clay on a potter's wheel, or a lathe---[sceptically], or any damned old thing! [Ecstatically] Out of clay does the sculptor create his more or less immortal masterpieces---[sceptically], which mostly are pure rot. [Ecstatically] Out of clay they make those utensils which are so indispensable in the pantry and which generically are named pots and plates---[sceptically], but what in thunder does it matter to me what they are called anyhow? [Ecstatically] Such is the clay! When clay becomes fluid, it is called mud---C'est mon affaire!---[shouts] Lena!\n\nLENA enters with a pail in her hand.\n\nTHE POET. Lena, show yourself to Miss Agnes---She knew you ten years ago, when you were a young, happy and, let us say, pretty girl---Behold how she looks now. Five children, drudgery, baby-cries, hunger, ill-treatment. See how beauty has perished and joy vanished in the fulfilment of duties which should have brought that inner satisfaction which makes each line in the face harmonious and fills the eye with a quiet glow.\n\nMASTER OF Q. [Covering the poet's mouth with his hand] Shut up! Shut up!\n\nTHE POET. That is what they all say. And if you keep silent, then they cry: speak! Oh, restless humanity!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Goes to Lena] Tell me your troubles.\n\nLENA. No, I dare not, for then they will be made worse.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Who could be so cruel?\n\nLENA. I dare not tell, for if I do, I shall be spanked.\n\nTHE POET. That is just what will happen. But I will speak, even though the blackamoor knock out all my teeth---I will tell that justice is not always done---Agnes, daughter of the gods, do you hear music and dancing on the hill over there?---Well, it is Lena's sister who has come home from the city where she went astray---you understand? Now they are killing the fatted calf; but Lena, who stayed at home, has to carry slop pails and feed the pigs.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. There is rejoicing at home because the stray has left the paths of evil, and not merely because she has come back. Bear that in mind.\n\nTHE POET. But then they should give a ball and banquet every night for the spotless worker that never strayed into paths of error---Yet they do nothing of the kind, but when Lena has a free moment, she is sent to prayer-meetings where she has to hear reproaches for not being perfect. Is this justice?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Your question is so difficult to answer because---There are so many unforeseen cases THE POET. That much the Caliph, Haroun the Just, came to understand. He was sitting on his throne, and from its height he could never make out what happened below. At last complaints penetrated to his exalted ears. And then, one fine day, he disguised himself and descended unobserved among the crowds to find out what kind of justice they were getting.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I hope you don't take me for Haroun the Just!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Let us talk of something else---Here come visitors.\n\nA white boat, shaped like a viking ship, with a dragon for figure-head, with a pale-blue silken sail on a gilded yard, and with a rose-red standard flying from the top of a gilded mast, glides through the strait from the left. He and She are seated in the stern with their arms around each other.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Behold perfect happiness, bliss without limits, young love's rejoicing!\n\nThe stage grows brighter.\n\nHE. [Stands up in the boat and sings]\n\nHail, beautiful haven,\n\nWhere the Springs of my youth were spent,\n\nWhere my first sweet dreams were dreamt---\n\nTo thee I return,\n\nBut lonely no longer!\n\nYe hills and groves,\n\nThou sky o'erhead,\n\nThou mirroring sea,\n\nGive greeting to her:\n\nMy love, my bride,\n\nMy light and my life!\n\nThe flags at the landings of Fairhaven are dipped in salute; white handkerchiefs are waved from verandahs and boats, and the air is filled with tender chords from harps and violins.\n\nTHE POET. See the light that surrounds them! Hear how the air is ringing with music!---Eros!\n\nTHE OFFICER. It is Victoria.\n\nMASTER OF Q. Well, what of it?\n\nTHE OFFICER. It is his Victoria---My own is still mine. And nobody can see her---Now you hoist the quarantine flag, and I shall pull in the net.\n\n[The MASTER OF QUARANTINE waves a yellow flag. THE OFFICER. [Pulling a rope that turns the boat toward Foulstrand] Hold on there!\n\nHE and SHE become aware of the hideous view and give vent to their horror.\n\nMASTER OF Q. Yes, it comes hard. But here every one must stop who hails from plague-stricken places.\n\nTHE POET. The idea of speaking in such manner, of acting in such a way, within the presence of two human beings united in love! Touch them not! Lay not hands on love! It is treason!---Woe to us! Everything beautiful must now be dragged down---dragged into the mud!\n\n[HE and SHE step ashore, looking sad and shamefaced.\n\nHE. Woe to us! What have we done?\n\nMASTER OF Q. It is not necessary to have done anything in order to encounter life's little pricks.\n\nSHE. So short-lived are joy and happiness!\n\nHE. How long must we stay here?\n\nMASTER OF Q. Forty days and nights.\n\nSHE. Then rather into the water!\n\nHE. To live here---among blackened hills and pig-sties?\n\nTHE POET. Love overcomes all, even sulphur fumes and carbolic acid.\n\nMASTER OF Q. [Starts a fire in the stove; blue, sulphurous flames break forth] Now I set the sulphur going. Will you please step in?\n\nSHE. Oh, my blue dress will fade.\n\nMASTER OF Q. And become white. So your roses will also turn white in time.\n\nHE. Even your cheeks---in forty days!\n\nSHE. [To THE OFFICER] That will please you.\n\nTHE OFFICER. No, it will not!---Of course, your happiness was the cause of my suffering, but---it doesn't matter---for I am graduated and have obtained a position over there---heigh-ho and alas! And in the Fall I shall be teaching school---teaching boys the same lessons I myself learned during my childhood and youth---the same lessons throughout my manhood and, finally, in my old age---the self-same lessons! What does twice two make? How many times can four be evenly divided by two?---Until I get a pension and can do nothing at all---just wait around for meals and the newspapers---until at last I am carted to the crematorium and burned to ashes---Have you nobody here who is entitled to a pension? Barring twice two makes four, it is probably the worst thing of all---to begin school all over again when one already is graduated; to ask the same questions until death comes------\n\nAn elderly man goes by, with his hands folded behind his back.\n\nTHE OFFICER. There is a pensioner now, waiting for himself to die. I think he must be a captain who missed the rank of major; or an assistant judge who was not made a chief justice. Many are called but few are chosen---He is waiting for his breakfast now.\n\nTHE PENSIONER. No, for the newspaper---the morning paper.\n\nTHE OFFICER. And he is only fifty-four years old. He may spend twenty-five more years waiting for meals and newspapers---is it not dreadful?\n\nTHE PENSIONER. What is not dreadful? Tell me, tell me!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Tell that who can!---Now I shall have to teach boys that twice two makes four. And how many times four can be evenly divided by two. [He clutches his head in despair] And Victoria, whom I loved and therefore wished all the happiness life can give---now she has her happiness, the greatest one known to her, and for this reason I suffer---suffer, suffer!\n\nSHE. Do you think I can be happy when I see you suffering? How can you think it? Perhaps it will soothe your pains that I am to be imprisoned here for forty days and nights? Tell me, does it soothe your pains?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Yes and no. How can I enjoy seeing you suffer? Oh!\n\nSHE. And do you think my happiness can be founded on your torments?\n\nTHE OFFICER. We are to be pitied---all of us!\n\nALL. [Raise their arms toward the sky and utter a cry of anguish that sounds like a dissonant chord] Oh!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Everlasting One, hear them! Life is evil! Men are to be pitied!\n\nALL. [As before] Oh!\n\nFor a moment the stage is completely darkened, and during that moment everybody withdraws or takes up a new position. When the light is turned on again, Foulstrand is seen in the background, lying in deep shadow. The strait is in the middle distance and Fairhaven in the foreground, both steeped in light. To the right, a corner of the Casino, where dancing couples are visible through the open windows. Three servant maids are standing outside on top of an empty box, with arms around each other, staring at the dancers within. On the verandah of the Casino stands a bench, where \"Plain\" EDITH is sitting. She is bare-headed, with an abundance of tousled hair, and looks sad. In front of her is an open piano.\n\nTo the left, a frame house painted yellow. Two children in light dresses are playing ball outside.\n\nIn the centre of the middle distance, a pier with white sailboats tied to it, and flag poles with hoisted flags. In the strait is anchored a naval vessel, brig-rigged, with gun ports. But the entire landscape is in winter dress, with snow on the ground and on the bare trees.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER and THE OFFICER enter.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Here is peace, and happiness, and leisure. No more toil; every day a holiday; everybody dressed up in their best; dancing and music in the early morning. [To the maids] Why don't you go in and have a dance, girls?\n\nTHE MAIDS. We?\n\nTHE OFFICER. They are servants, don't you see!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Of course!---But why is Edith sitting there instead of dancing?\n\n[EDITH buries her face in her hands.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Don't question her! She has been sitting there three hours without being asked for a dance.\n\n[Goes into the yellow house on the left.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What a cruel form of amusement!\n\nTHE MOTHER. [In a low-necked dress, enters from the Casino and goes up to EDITH] Why don't you go in as I told you?\n\nEDITH. Because---I cannot throw myself at them. That I am ugly, I know, and I know that nobody wants to dance with me, but I might be spared from being reminded of it.\n\nBegins to play on the piano, the Toccata Con Fuga, Op. 10, by Sebastian Bach.\n\nThe waltz music from within is heard faintly at first. Then it grows in strength, as if to compete with the Bach Toccata. EDITH prevails over it and brings it to silence. Dancers appear in the doorway to hear her play. Everybody on the stage stands still and listens reverently.\n\nA NAVAL OFFICER. [Takes ALICE, one of the dancers, around the waist and drags her toward the pier] Come quick!\n\nEDITH breaks off abruptly, rises and stares at the couple with an expression of utter despair; stands as if turned to stone.\n\nNow the front wall of the yellow house disappears, revealing three benches full of schoolboys. Among these THE OFFICER is seen, looking worried and depressed. In front of the boys stands THE TEACHER, bespectacled and holding a piece of chalk in one hand, a rattan cane in the other.\n\nTHE TEACHER. [To THE OFFICER] Well, my boy, can you tell me what twice two makes?\n\nTHE OFFICER remains seated while he racks his mind without finding an answer.\n\nTHE TEACHER. You must rise when I ask you a question.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Harassed, rises] Two---twice---let me see. That makes two-two.\n\nTHE TEACHER. I see! You have not studied your lesson.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Ashamed] Yes, I have, but---I know the answer, but I cannot tell it------\n\nTHE TEACHER. You want to wriggle out of it, of course. You know it, but you cannot tell. Perhaps I may help you.\n\n[Pulls his hair.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Oh, it is dreadful, it is dreadful!\n\nTHE TEACHER. Yes, it is dreadful that such a big boy lacks all ambition------\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Hurt] Big boy---yes, I am big---bigger than all these others---I am full-grown, I am done with school---[As if waking up] I have graduated---why am I then sitting here? Have I not received my doctor's degree?\n\nTHE TEACHER. Certainly, but you are to sit here and mature, you know. You have to mature---isn't that so?\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Feels his forehead] Yes, that is right, one must mature---Twice two---makes two---and this I can demonstrate by analogy, which is the highest form of all reasoning. Listen!---Once one makes one; consequently twice two must make two. For what applies in one case must also apply in another.\n\nTHE TEACHER. Your conclusion is based on good logic, but your answer is wrong.\n\nTHE OFFICER. What is logical cannot be wrong. Let us test it. One divided by one gives one, so that two divided by two must give two.\n\nTHE TEACHER. Correct according to analogy. But how much does once three make?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Three, of course.\n\nTHE TEACHER. Consequently twice three must also make three.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Pondering] No, that cannot be right---it cannot---or else---[Sits down dejectedly] No, I am not mature yet.\n\nTHE TEACHER. No, indeed, you are far from mature.\n\nTHE OFFICER. But how long am I to sit here, then?\n\nTHE TEACHER. Here---how long? Do you believe that time and space exist?---Suppose that time does exist, then you should be able to say what time is. What is time?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Time---[Thinks] I cannot tell, but I know what it is. Consequently I may also know what twice two is without being able to tell it. And, teacher, can you tell what time is?\n\nTHE TEACHER. Of course I can.\n\nALL THE BOYS. Tell us then!\n\nTHE TEACHER. Time---let me see. [Stands immovable until one finger on his nose] While we are talking, time flies. Consequently time is something that flies while we talk.\n\nA BOY. [Rising] Now you are talking, teacher, and while you are talking, I fly: consequently I am time. [Runs out.\n\nTHE TEACHER. That accords completely with the laws of logic.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Then the laws of logic are silly, for Nils who ran away, cannot be time.\n\nTHE TEACHER. That is also good logic, although it is silly.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Then logic itself is silly.\n\nTHE TEACHER. So it seems. But if logic is silly, then all the world is silly---and then the devil himself wouldn't stay here to teach you more silliness. If anybody treats me to a drink, we'll go and take a bath.\n\nTHE OFFICER. That is a posterus prius, or the world turned upside down, for it is customary to bathe first and have the drink afterward. Old fogy!\n\nTHE TEACHER. Beware of a swelled head, doctor!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Call me captain, if you please. I am an officer, and I cannot understand why I should be sitting here to get scolded like a schoolboy------\n\nTHE TEACHER. [With raised index finger] We were to mature!\n\nMASTER OF Q. [Enters] The quarantine begins.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Oh, there you are. Just think of it, this fellow makes me sit among the boys although I am graduated.\n\nMASTER OF Q. Well, why don't you go away?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Heaven knows!---Go away? Why, that is no easy thing to do.\n\nTHE TEACHER. I guess not---just try!\n\nTHE OFFICER. [To MASTER OF QUARANTINE] Save me! Save me from his eye!\n\nMASTER OF Q. Come on. Come and help us dance---We have to dance before the plague breaks out. We must!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Is the brig leaving?\n\nMASTER OF Q. Yes, first of all the brig must leave---Then there will be a lot of tears shed, of course.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Always tears: when she comes and when she goes---Let us get out of here.\n\nThey go out. THE TEACHER continues his lesson in silence.\n\nTHE MAIDS that were staring through the window of the dance hall walk sadly down to the pier. EDITH, who has been standing like a statue at the piano, follows them.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [To THE OFFICER] Is there not one happy person to be found in this paradise?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Yes, there is a newly married couple. Just watch them.\n\nTHE NEWLY MARRIED COUPLE enter.\n\nHUSBAND. [To his WIFE] My joy has no limits, and I could now wish to die------\n\nWIFE. Why die?\n\nHUSBAND. Because at the heart of happiness grows the seed of disaster. Happiness devours itself like a flame---it cannot burn for ever, but must go out some time. And this presentiment of the coming end destroys joy in the very hour of its culmination.\n\nWIFE. Let us then die together---this moment!\n\nHUSBAND. Die? All right! For I fear happiness---that cheat! [They go toward the water.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Life is evil! Men are to be pitied!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Look at this fellow. He is the most envied mortal in this neighbourhood.\n\nTHE BLIND MAN is led in.\n\nTHE OFFICER. He is the owner of these hundred or more Italian villas. He owns all these bays, straits, shores, forests, together with the fishes in the water, the birds in the air, the game in the woods. These thousand or more people are his tenants. The sun rises upon his sea and sets upon his land------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Well---is he complaining also?\n\nTHE OFFICER. Yes, and with right, for he cannot see.\n\nMASTER OF Q. He is blind.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. The most envied of all!\n\nTHE OFFICER. Now he has come to see the brig depart with his son on board.\n\nTHE BLIND MAN. I cannot see, but I hear. I hear the anchor bill claw the clay bottom as when the hook is torn out of a fish and brings up the heart with it through the neck---My son, my only child, is going to journey across the wide sea to foreign lands, and I can follow him only in my thought! Now I hear the clanking of the chain---and---there is something that snaps and cracks like clothes drying on a line---wet handkerchiefs perhaps. And I hear it blubber and snivel as when people are weeping---maybe the splashing of the wavelets among the seines---or maybe girls along the shore, deserted and disconsolate---Once I asked a child why the ocean is salt, and the child, which had a father on a long trip across the high seas, said immediately: the ocean is salt because the sailors shed so many tears into it. And why do the sailors cry so much then?---Because they are always going away, replied the child; and that is why they are always drying their handkerchiefs in the rigging---And why does man weep when he is sad? I asked at last---Because the glass in the eyes must be washed now and then, so that we can see clearly, said the child.\n\nThe brig has set sail and is gliding off. The girls along the shore are alternately waving their handkerchiefs and wiping off their tears with them. Then a signal is set on the foremast---a red ball in a white field, meaning \"yes.\" In response to it ALICE waves her handkerchief triumphantly.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [To THE OFFICER] What is the meaning of that flag?\n\nTHE OFFICER. It means \"yes.\" It is the lieutenant's troth---red as the red blood of the arteries, set against the blue cloth of the sky.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And how does \"no\" look?\n\nTHE OFFICER. It is blue as the spoiled blood in the veins---but look, how jubilant Alice is.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And how Edith cries.\n\nTHE BLIND MAN. Meet and part. Part and meet. That is life. I met his mother. And then she went away from me. He was left to me; and now he goes.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But he will come back.\n\nTHE BLIND MAN. Who is speaking to me? I have heard that voice before---in my dreams; in my youth, when vacation began; in the early years of my marriage, when my child was born. Every time life smiled at me, I heard that voice, like a whisper of the south wind, like a chord of harps from above, like what I feel the angels' greeting must be in the Holy Night------\n\nTHE LAWYER enters and goes up to whisper something into THE BLIND MAN's ear.\n\nTHE BLIND MAN. Is that so?\n\nTHE LAWYER. That's the truth. [Goes to THE DAUGHTER] Now you have seen most of it, but you have not yet tried the worst of it.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What can that be?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Repetition---recurrence. To retrace one's own tracks; to be sent back to the task once finished---come!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Where?\n\nTHE LAWYER. To your duties.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What does that mean?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Everything you dread. Everything you do not want but must. It means to forego, to give up, to do without, to lack---it means everything that is unpleasant, repulsive, painful.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Are there no pleasant duties?\n\nTHE LAWYER. They become pleasant when they are done.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. When they have ceased to exist---Duty is then something unpleasant. What is pleasant then?\n\nTHE LAWYER. What is pleasant is sin.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Sin?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes, something that has to be punished. If I have had a pleasant day or night, then I suffer infernal pangs and a bad conscience the next day.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. How strange!\n\nTHE LAWYER. I wake up in the morning with a headache; and then the repetitions begin, but so that everything becomes perverted. What the night before was pretty, agreeable, witty, is presented by memory in the morning as ugly, distasteful, stupid. Pleasure seems to decay, and all joy goes to pieces. What men call success serves always as a basis for their next failure. My own successes have brought ruin upon me. For men view the fortune of others with an instinctive dread. They regard it unjust that fate should favour any one man, and so they try to restore balance by piling rocks on the road. To have talent is to be in danger of one's life, for then one may easily starve to death!---However, you will have to return to your duties, or I shall bring suit against you, and we shall pass through every court up to the highest---one, two, three!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Return?---To the iron stove, and the cabbage pot, and the baby clothes------\n\nTHE LAWYER. Exactly! We have a big wash to-day, for we must wash all the handkerchiefs------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Oh, must I do it all over again?\n\nTHE LAWYER. All life is nothing but doing things over again. Look at the teacher in there---He received his doctor's degree yesterday, was laurelled and saluted, climbed Parnassus and was embraced by the monarch---and to-day he starts school all over again, asks how much twice two makes, and will continue to do so until his death---However, you must come back to your home!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I shall rather die!\n\nTHE LAWYER. Die?---That is not allowed. First of all, it is a disgrace---so much so that even the dead body is subjected to insults; and secondly, one goes to hell---it is a mortal sin!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It is not easy to be human!\n\nALL. Hear!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I shall not go back with you to humiliation and dirt---I am longing for the heights whence I came---but first the door must be opened so that I may learn the secret---It is my will that the door be opened!\n\nTHE LAWYER. Then you must retrace your own steps, cover the road you have already travelled, suffer all annoyances, repetitions, tautologies, recopyings, that a suit will bring with it------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. May it come then---But first I must go into the solitude and the wilderness to recover my own self. We shall meet again! [To THE POET] Follow me.\n\nCries of anguish are heard from a distance. Woe! Woe! Woe!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What is that?\n\nTHE LAWYER. The lost souls at Foulstrand.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Why do they wail more loudly than usual to-day?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Because the sun is shining here; because here we have music, dancing, youth. And it makes them feel their own sufferings more keenly.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. We must set them free.\n\nTHE LAWYER. Try it! Once a liberator appeared, and he was nailed to a cross.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. By whom?\n\nTHE LAWYER. By all the right-minded.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Who are they?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Are you not acquainted with all the right-minded? Then you must learn to know them.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Were they the ones that prevented your graduation?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Then I know them!\n\nCurtain.\n\nOn the shores of the Mediterranean. To the left, in the foreground, a white wall, and above it branches of an orange tree with ripe fruit on them. In the background, villas and a Casino placed on a terrace. To the right, a huge pile of coal and two wheel-barrows. In the background, to the right, a corner of blue sea.\n\nTwo coalheavers, naked to the waist, their faces, hands, and bodies blackened by coal dust, are seated on the wheel-barrows. Their expressions show intense despair.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER and THE LAWYER in the background.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. This is paradise!\n\nFIRST COALHEAVER. This is hell!\n\nSECOND COALHEAVER. One hundred and twenty degrees in the shadow.\n\nFIRST HEAVER. Let's have a bath.\n\nSECOND HEAVER. The police won't let us. No bathing here.\n\nFIRST HEAVER. Couldn't we pick some fruit off that tree?\n\nSECOND HEAVER. Then the police would get after us.\n\nFIRST HEAVER. But I cannot do a thing in this heat---I'll just chuck the job------\n\nSECOND HEAVER. Then the police will get you for sure!--- [Pause] And you wouldn't have anything to eat anyhow.\n\nFIRST HEAVER. Nothing to eat? We, who work hardest, get least food; and the rich, who do nothing, get most. Might one not---without disregard of truth---assert that this is injustice ---What has the daughter of the gods to say about it?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I can say nothing at all---But tell me, what have you done that makes you so black and your lot so hard?\n\nFIRST HEAVER. What have we done? We have been born of poor and perhaps not very good parents---Maybe we have been punished a couple of times.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Punished?\n\nFIRST HEAVER. Yes, the unpunished hang out in the Casino up there and dine on eight courses with wine.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [To THE LAWYER] Can that be true?\n\nTHE LAWYER. On the whole, yes.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You mean to say that every man at some time has deserved to go to prison?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You, too?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Is it true that the poor cannot bathe in the sea?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes. Not even with their clothes on. None but those who intend to take their own lives escape being fined. And those are said to get a good drubbing at the police station.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But can they not go outside of the city, out into the country, and bathe there?\n\nTHE LAWYER. There is no place for them---all the land is fenced in.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But I mean in the free, open country.\n\nTHE LAWYER. There is no such thing---it all belongs to somebody.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Even the sea, the great, vast sea------\n\nTHE LAWYER. Even that! You cannot sail the sea in a boat and land anywhere without having it put down in writing and charged for. It is lovely!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. This is not paradise.\n\nTHE LAWYER. I should say not!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Why don't men do something to improve their lot?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Oh, they try, of course, but all the improvers end in prison or in the madhouse------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Who puts them in prison?\n\nTHE LAWYER. All the right-minded, all the respectable------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Who sends them to the madhouse?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Their own despair when they grasp the hopelessness of their efforts.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Has the thought not occurred to anybody, that for secret reasons it must be as it is?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes, those who are well off always think so.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. That it is all right as it is?\n\nFIRST HEAVER. And yet we are the foundations of society. If the coal is not unloaded, then there will be no fire in the kitchen stove, in the parlour grate, or in the factory furnace; then the light will go out in streets and shops and homes; then darkness and cold will descend upon you---and, therefore, we have to sweat as in hell so that the black coals may be had---And what do you do for us in return?\n\nTHE LAWYER. [To THE DAUGHTER] Help them!---[Pause] That conditions cannot be quite the same for everybody, I understand, but why should they differ so widely?\n\nA GENTLEMAN and A LADY pass across the stage.\n\nTHE LADY. Will you come and play a game with us?\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. No, I must take a walk, so I can eat something for dinner.\n\nFIRST HEAVER. So that he can eat something?\n\nSECOND HEAVER. So that he can------?\n\nChildren enter and cry with horror when they catch sight of the grimy workers.\n\nFIRST HEAVER. They cry when they see us. They cry------\n\nSECOND HEAVER. Damn it all!---I guess we'll have to pull out the scaffolds soon and begin to operate on this rotten body------\n\nFIRST HEAVER. Damn it, I say, too! [Spits.\n\nTHE LAWYER. [To THE DAUGHTER] Yes, it is all wrong. And men are not so very bad---but------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But------\n\nTHE LAWYER. But the government------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Goes out, hiding her face in her hands] This is not paradise.\n\nCOALHEAVERS. No, hell, that's what it is!\n\nCurtain.\n\nMeans literally \"wordspout.\"\n\nFingal's Cave. Long green waves are rolling slowly into the cave. In the foreground, a siren buoy is swaying to and fro in time with the waves, but without sounding except at the indicated moment. Music of the winds. Music of the waves.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER and THE POET.\n\nTHE POET. Where are you leading me?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Far away from the noise and lament of the man-children, to the utmost end of the ocean, to the cave that we name Indra's Ear because it is the place where the king of the heavens is said to listen to the complaints of the mortals.\n\nTHE POET. What? In this place?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Do you see how this cave is built like a shell? Yes, you can see it. Do you know that your ear, too, is built in the form of a shell? You know it, but have not thought of it. [She picks up a shell from the beach] Have you not as a child held such a shell to your ear and listened---and heard the ripple of your heart-blood, the humming of your thoughts in the brain, the snapping of a thousand little worn-out threads in the tissues of your body? All that you hear in this small shell. Imagine then what may be heard in this larger one!\n\nTHE POET. [Listening] I hear nothing but the whispering of the wind.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Then I shall interpret it for you. Listen. The wail of the winds. [Recites to subdued music:\n\nBorn beneath the clouds of heaven,\n\nDriven we were by the lightnings of Indra\n\nDown to the sand-covered earth.\n\nStraw from the harvested fields soiled our feet;\n\nDust from the high-roads,\n\nSmoke from the cities,\n\nFoul-smelling breaths,\n\nFumes from cellars and kitchens,\n\nAll we endured.\n\nThen to the open sea we fled,\n\nFilling our lungs with air,\n\nShaking our wings,\n\nAnd laving our feet.\n\nIndra, Lord of the Heavens,\n\nHear us!\n\nHear our sighing!\n\nUnclean is the earth;\n\nEvil is life;\n\nNeither good nor bad\n\nCan men be deemed.\n\nAs they can, they live,\n\nOne day at a time.\n\nSons of dust, through dust they journey;\n\nBorn out of dust, to dust they return.\n\nGiven they were, for trudging,\n\nFeet, not wings for flying.\n\nDusty they grow---\n\nLies the fault then with them,\n\nOr with Thee?\n\nTHE POET. Thus I heard it once------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Hush! The winds are still singing.\n\n[Recites to subdued music:\n\nWe, winds that wander,\n\nWe, the air's offspring,\n\nBear with us men's lament.\n\nHeard us you have\n\nDuring gloom-filled Fall nights,\n\nIn chimneys and pipes,\n\nIn key-holes and door cracks,\n\nWhen the rain wept on the roof:\n\nHeard us you have\n\nIn the snowclad pine woods\n\nMidst wintry gloom:\n\nHeard us you have,\n\nCrooning and moaning\n\nIn ropes and rigging\n\nOn the high-heaving sea.\n\nIt was we, the winds,\n\nOffspring of the air,\n\nWho learned how to grieve\n\nWithin human breasts\n\nThrough which we passed---\n\nIn sick-rooms, on battle-fields,\n\nBut mostly where the newborn\n\nWhimpered and wailed\n\nAt the pain of living.\n\nWe, we, the winds,\n\nWe are whining and whistling:\n\nWoe! Woe! Woe!\n\nTHE POET. It seems to me that I have already------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Hush! Now the waves are singing.\n\n[Recites to subdued music:\n\nWe, we waves,\n\nThat are rocking the winds\n\nTo rest---\n\nGreen cradles, we waves!\n\nWet are we, and salty;\n\nLeap like flames of fire---\n\nWet flames are we:\n\nBurning, extinguishing;\n\nCleansing, replenishing;\n\nBearing, engendering.\n\nWe, we waves,\n\nThat are rocking the winds\n\nTo rest!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. False waves and faithless! Everything on earth that is not burned, is drowned---by the waves. Look at this. [Pointing to pile of debris] See what the sea has taken and spoiled! Nothing but the figure-heads remain of the sunken ships---and the names: Justice, Friendship, Golden Peace, Hope---this is all that is left of Hope---of fickle Hope---Railings, tholes, bails! And lo: the life buoy---which saved itself and let distressed men perish.\n\nTHE POET. [Searching in the pile] Here is the name-board of the ship Justice. That was the one which left Fairhaven with the Blind Man's son on board. It is lost then! And with it are gone the lover of Alice, the hopeless love of Edith.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. The Blind Man? Fairhaven? I must have been dreaming of them. And the lover of Alice, \"Plain\" Edith, Foulstrand and the Quarantine, sulphur and carbolic acid, the graduation in the church, the Lawyer's office, the passageway and Victoria, the Growing Castle and the Officer---All this I have been dreaming------\n\nTHE POET. It was in one of my poems.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You know then what poetry is------\n\nTHE POET. I know then what dreaming is---But what is poetry?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Not reality, but more than reality---not dreaming, but daylight dreams------\n\nTHE POET. And the man-children think that we poets are only playing---that we invent and make believe.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And fortunate it is, my friend, for otherwise the world would lie fallow for lack of ministration. Everybody would be stretched on his back, staring into the sky. Nobody would be touching plough or spade, hammer or plane.\n\nTHE POET. And you say this, Indra's daughter, you who belong in part up there------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You do right in reproaching me. Too long have I stayed down here taking mud baths like you---My thoughts have lost their power of flight; there is clay on their wings---mire on their feet---and I myself---[raising her arms] I sink, I sink---Help me, father, Lord of the Heavens! [Silence] I can no longer hear his answer. The ether no longer carries the sound from his lips to my ear's shell the silvery thread has snapped---Woe is me, I am earthbound!\n\nTHE POET. Do you mean to ascend---soon?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. As soon as I have consigned this mortal shape to the flames---for even the waters of the ocean cannot cleanse me. Why do you question me thus?\n\nTHE POET. Because I have a prayer------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What kind of prayer?\n\nTHE POET. A written supplication from humanity to the ruler of the universe, formulated by a dreamer.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. To be presented by whom?\n\nTHE POET. By Indra's daughter.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Can you repeat what you have written?\n\nTHE POET. I can.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Speak it then.\n\nTHE POET. Better that you do it.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Where can I read it?\n\nTHE POET. In my mind---or here.\n\n[Hands her a roll of paper.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Receives the roll, but reads without looking at it] Well, by me it shall be spoken then:\n\n\"Why must you be born in anguish?\n\nWhy, O man-child, must you always\n\nWring your mother's heart with torture\n\nWhen you bring her joy maternal,\n\nHighest happiness yet known?\n\nWhy to life must you awaken,\n\nWhy to light give natal greeting,\n\nWith a cry of anger and of pain?\n\nWhy not meet it smiling, man-child,\n\nWhen the gift of life is counted\n\nIn itself a boon unmatched?\n\nWhy like beasts should we be coming,\n\nWe of race divine and human?\n\nBetter garment craves the spirit\n\nThan one made of filth and blood!\n\nNeed a god his teeth be changing------\"\n\n---Silence, rash one! Is it seemly\n\nFor the work to blame its maker?\n\nNo one yet has solved life's riddle.\n\n\"Thus begins the human journey\n\nO'er a road of thorns and thistles;\n\nIf a beaten path be offered.\n\nIt is named at once forbidden;\n\nIf a flower you covet, straightway\n\nYou are told it is another's;\n\nIf a field should bar your progress,\n\nAnd you dare to break across it,\n\nYou destroy your neighbour's harvest;\n\nOthers then your own will trample,\n\nThat the measure may be evened!\n\nEvery moment of enjoyment\n\nBrings to some one else a sorrow,\n\nBut your sorrow gladdens no one,\n\nFor from sorrow naught but sorrow springs.\n\n\"Thus you journey till you die,\n\nAnd your death brings others' bread.\"\n\n---Is it thus that you approach,\n\nSon of Dust, the One Most High?\n\nTHE POET.\n\nCould the son of dust discover\n\nWords so pure and bright and simple\n\nThat to heaven they might ascend------?\n\nChild of gods, wilt thou interpret\n\nMankind's grievance in some language\n\nThat immortals understand?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I will.\n\nTHE POET. [Pointing to the buoy] What is that floating there?---A buoy?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes.\n\nTHE POET. It looks like a lung with a windpipe.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It is the watchman of the seas. When danger is abroad, it sings.\n\nTHE POET. It seems to me as if the sea were rising and the waves growing larger------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Not unlikely.\n\nTHE POET. Woe! What do I see? A ship bearing down upon the reef.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What ship can that be?\n\nTHE POET. The ghost ship of the seas, I think.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What ship is that?\n\nTHE POET. The Flying Dutchman.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Oh, that one. Why is he punished so hard, and why does he not seek harbour?\n\nTHE POET. Because he had seven faithless wives.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And for this he should be punished?\n\nTHE POET. Yes, all the right-minded condemned him------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Strange world, this!---How can he then be freed from his curse?\n\nTHE POET. Freed?---Oh, they take good care that none is set free.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Why?\n\nTHE POET. Because---No, it is not the Dutchman! It is an ordinary ship in distress. Why does not the buoy cry out now? Look, how the sea is rising---how high the waves are---soon we shall be unable to get out of the cave! Now the ship's bell is ringing---Soon we shall have another figure-head. Cry out, buoy! Do your duty, watchman! [The buoy sounds a four-voice chord of fifths and sixths, reminding one of fog horns] The crew is signalling to us---but we are doomed ourselves.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Do you not wish to be set free?\n\nTHE POET. Yes, of course---of course, I wish it---but not just now, and not by water.\n\nTHE CREW. [Sings in quartet] Christ Kyrie!\n\nTHE POET. Now they are crying aloud, and so is the sea, but no one gives ear.\n\nTHE CREW. [As before] Christ Kyrie!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Who is coming there?\n\nTHE POET. Walking on the waters? There is only one who does that---and it is not Peter, the Rock, for he sank like a stone------\n\nA white light is seen shining over the water at some distance.\n\nTHE CREW. Christ Kyrie!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Can this be He?\n\nTHE POET. It is He, the crucified------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Why---tell me---why was He crucified?\n\nTHE POET. Because He wanted to set free------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Who was it---I have forgotten---that crucified Him?\n\nTHE POET. All the right-minded.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What a strange world!\n\nTHE POET. The sea is rising. Darkness is closing in upon us. The storm is growing------\n\n[THE CREW set up a wild outcry.\n\nTHE POET. The crew scream with horror at the sight of their Saviour---and now---they are leaping overboard for fear of the Redeemer------\n\n[THE CREW utter another cry.\n\nTHE POET. Now they are crying because they must die. Crying when they are born, and crying when they pass away!\n\n[The rising waves threaten to engulf the two in the cave.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. If I could only be sure that it is a ship------\n\nTHE POET. Really---I don't think it is a ship---It is a two-storied house with trees in front of it---and---a telephone tower---a tower that reaches up into the skies---It is the modern Tower of Babel sending wires to the upper regions---to communicate with those above------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Child, the human thought needs no wires to make a way for itself---the prayers of the pious penetrate the universe. It cannot be a Tower of Babel, for if you want to assail the heavens, you must do so with prayer.\n\nTHE POET. No, it is no house---no telephone tower---don't you see?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What are you seeing?\n\nTHE POET. I see an open space covered with snow---a drill ground---The winter sun is shining from behind a church on a hill, and the tower is casting its long shadow on the snow---Now a troop of soldiers come marching across the grounds. They march up along the tower, up the spire. Now they have reached the cross, but I have a feeling that the first one who steps on the gilded weathercock at the top must die. Now they are near it---a corporal is leading them---ha-ha! There comes a cloud sweeping across the open space, and right in front of the sun, of course---now everything is gone---the water in the cloud put out the sun's fire!---The light of the sun created the shadow picture of the tower, but the shadow picture of the cloud swallowed the shadow picture of the tower------\n\nWhile THE POET is still speaking, the stage is changed and shows once more the passageway outside the opera-house.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [To THE PORTRESS] Has the Lord Chancellor arrived yet?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. No.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And the Deans of the Faculties?\n\nTHE PORTRESS. No.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Call them at once, then, for the door is to be opened------\n\nTHE PORTRESS. Is it so very pressing?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes, it is. For there is a suspicion that the solution of the world-riddle may be hidden behind it. Call the Lord Chancellor, and the Deans of the Four Faculties also.\n\n[THE PORTRESS blows in a whistle.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And do not forget the Glazier and his diamond, for without them nothing can be done.\n\nSTAGE PEOPLE enter from the left as in the earlier scene.\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Enters from the background, in Prince Albert and high hat, with a bunch of roses in his hand, looking radiantly happy] Victoria!\n\nTHE PORTRESS. The young lady will be coming in a moment.\n\nTHE OFFICER. Good! The carriage is waiting, the table is set, the wine is on ice---Permit me to embrace you, madam! [Embraces THE PORTRESS] Victoria!\n\nA WOMAN'S VOICE FROM ABOVE. [Sings] I am here!\n\nTHE OFFICER. [Begins to walk to and fro] Good! I am waiting.\n\nTHE POET. It seems to me that all this has happened before------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. So it seems to me also.\n\nTHE POET. Perhaps I have dreamt it.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Or put it in a poem, perhaps.\n\nTHE POET. Or put it in a poem.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Then you know what poetry is.\n\nTHE POET. Then I know what dreaming is.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. It seems to me that we have said all this to each other before, in some other place.\n\nTHE POET. Then you may soon figure out what reality is.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Or dreaming!\n\nTHE POET. Or poetry!\n\nEnter the LORD CHANCELLOR and the DEANS of the THEOLOGICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, MEDICAL, and LEGAL FACULTIES.\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. It is about the opening of that door, of course---What does the Dean of the Theological Faculty think of it?\n\nDEAN OF THEOLOGY. I do not think---I believe---Credo------\n\nDEAN OF PHILOSOPHY. I hold------\n\nDEAN OF MEDICINE. I know------\n\nDEAN OF JURISPRUDENCE. I doubt until I have evidence and witnesses.\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. Now they are fighting again!---Well, what does Theology believe?\n\nTHEOLOGY. I believe that this door must not be opened, because it hides dangerous truths------\n\nPHILOSOPHY. Truth is never dangerous.\n\nMEDICINE. What is truth?\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. What can be proved by two witnesses.\n\nTHEOLOGY. Anything can be proved by two false witnesses---thinks the pettifogger.\n\nPHILOSOPHY. Truth is wisdom, and wisdom, knowledge, is philosophy itself---Philosophy is the science of sciences, the knowledge of knowing, and all other sciences are its servants.\n\nMEDICINE. Natural science is the only true science---and philosophy is no science at all. It is nothing but empty speculation.\n\nTHEOLOGY. Good!\n\nPHILOSOPHY. [To THEOLOGY] Good, you say! And what are you, then? You are the arch-enemy of all knowledge; you are the very antithesis of knowledge; you are ignorance and obscuration------\n\nMEDICINE. Good!\n\nTHEOLOGY. [To MEDICINE] You cry \"good,\" you, who cannot see beyond the length of your own nose in the magnifying glass; who believes in nothing but your own unreliable senses---in your vision, for instance, which may be far-sighted, near-sighted, blind, purblind, cross-eyed, one-eyed, colour-blind, red-blind, green-blind------\n\nMEDICINE. Idiot!\n\nTHEOLOGY. Ass! [They fight.\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. Peace! One crow does not peck out the other's eye.\n\nPHILOSOPHY. If I had to choose between those two, Theology and Medicine, I should choose---neither!\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. And if I had to sit in judgment on the three of you, I should find---all guilty! You cannot agree on a single point, and you never could. Let us get back to the case in court. What is the opinion of the Lord Chancellor as to this door and its opening?\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. Opinion? I have no opinion whatever. I am merely appointed by the government to see that you don't break each other's arms and legs in the Council---while you are educating the young! Opinion? Why, I take mighty good care to avoid everything of the kind. Once I had one or two, but they were refuted at once. Opinions are always refuted---by their opponents, of course---But perhaps we might open the door now, even with the risk of finding some dangerous truths behind it?\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. What is truth? What is truth?\n\nTHEOLOGY. I am the truth and the life------\n\nPHILOSOPHY. I am the science of sciences------\n\nMEDICINE. I am the only exact science------\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. I doubt------ [They fight.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Instructors of the young, take shame!\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. Lord Chancellor, as representative of the government, as head of the corps of instructors, you must prosecute this woman's offence. She has told all of you to take shame, which is an insult; and she has---in a sneering, ironical sense---called you instructors of the young, which is a slanderous speech.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Poor youth!\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. She pities the young, which is to accuse us. Lord Chancellor, you must prosecute the offence.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Yes, I accuse you---you in a body---of sowing doubt and discord in the minds of the young.\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. Listen to her---she herself is making the young question our authority, and then she charges us with sowing doubt. Is it not a criminal act, I ask all the right-minded?\n\nALL RIGHT-MINDED. Yes, it is criminal.\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. All the right-minded have condemned you. Leave in peace with your lucre, or else------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. My lucre? Or else? What else?\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. Else you will be stoned.\n\nTHE POET. Or crucified.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I leave. Follow me, and you shall learn the riddle.\n\nTHE POET. Which riddle?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What did he mean with \"my lucre\"?\n\nTHE POET. Probably nothing at all. That kind of thing we call talk. He was just talking.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. But it was what hurt me more than anything else!\n\nTHE POET. That is why he said it, I suppose---Men are that way.\n\nALL RIGHT-MINDED. Hooray! The door is open.\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. What was behind the door?\n\nTHE GLAZIER. I can see nothing.\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. He cannot see anything---of course, he cannot! Deans of the Faculties: what was behind that door?\n\nTHEOLOGY. Nothing! That is the solution of the world-riddle. In the beginning God created heaven and the earth out of nothing------\n\nPHILOSOPHY. Out of nothing comes nothing.\n\nMEDICINE. Yes, bosh---which is nothing!\n\nJURISPRUDENCE. I doubt. And this is a case of deception. I appeal to all the right-minded.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [To THE POET] Who are the right-minded?\n\nTHE POET. Who can tell? Frequently all the right-minded consist of a single person. To-day it is me and mine; to-morrow it is you and yours. To that position you are appointed---or rather, you appoint yourself to it.\n\nALL RIGHT-MINDED. We have been deceived.\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. Who has deceived you?\n\nALL RIGHT-MINDED. The Daughter!\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. Will the Daughter please tell us what she meant by having this door opened?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. No, friends. If I did, you would not believe me.\n\nMEDICINE. Why, then, there is nothing there.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You have said it---but you have not understood.\n\nMEDICINE. It is bosh, what she says!\n\nALL. Bosh!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [To THE POET] They are to be pitied.\n\nTHE POET. Are you in earnest?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Always in earnest.\n\nTHE POET. Do you think the right-minded are to be pitied also?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. They most of all, perhaps.\n\nTHE POET. And the four faculties, too?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. They also, and not the least. Four heads, four minds, and one body. Who made that monster?\n\nALL. She has not answered!\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. Stone her then!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. I have answered.\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR. Hear---she answers.\n\nALL. Stone her! She answers!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Whether she answer or do not answer, stone her! Come, prophet, and I shall tell you the riddle---but far away from here---out in the desert, where no one can hear us, no one see us, for------\n\nTHE LAWYER. [Enters and takes THE DAUGHTER by the arm] Have you forgotten your duties?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Oh, heavens, no! But I have higher duties.\n\nTHE LAWYER. And your child?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. My child---what of it?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Your child is crying for you.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. My child! Woe, I am earth-bound! And this pain in my breast, this anguish---what is it?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Don't you know?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. No.\n\nTHE LAWYER. It is remorse.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Is that remorse?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes, and it follows every neglected duty; every pleasure, even the most innocent, if innocent pleasures exist, which seems doubtful; and every suffering inflicted upon one's fellow-beings.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. And there is no remedy?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Yes, but only one. It consists in doing your duty at once------\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. You look like a demon when you speak that word duty---And when, as in my case, there are two duties to be met?\n\nTHE LAWYER. Meet one first, and then the other.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. The highest first---therefore, you look after my child, and I shall do my duty------\n\nTHE LAWYER. Your child suffers because it misses you---can you bear to know that a human being is suffering for your sake?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Now strife has entered my soul---it is rent in two, and the halves are being pulled in opposite directions!\n\nTHE LAWYER. Such, you know, are life's little discords.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. Oh, how it is pulling!\n\nTHE POET. If you could only know how I have spread sorrow and ruin around me by the exercise of my calling---and note that I say calling, which carries with it the highest duty of all---then you would not even touch my hand.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. What do you mean?\n\nTHE POET. I had a father who put his whole hope on me as his only son, destined to continue his enterprise. I ran away from the business college. My father grieved himself to death. My mother wanted me to be religious, and I could not do what she wanted---and she disowned me. I had a friend who assisted me through trying days of need---and that friend acted as a tyrant against those on whose behalf I was speaking and writing. And I ha"
