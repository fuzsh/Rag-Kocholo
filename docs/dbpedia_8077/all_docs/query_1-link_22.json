        "text": "Strindberg’s Ett drömspel and Peder W. Cappelen’s Sverre. Berget og Ordet: Two Dreams of Love\n\nHenning K. Sehmsdorf\n\nI\n\nOne measure of the importance of Strindberg is the continued impact of his work on contemporary dramatists. The Norwegian Peder W. Cappelen, author of some twelve plays, is one example. In an unpublished letter (dated 17 April 1979) he acknowledges that Strindberg, next to Shakespeare, is the dramatist who has meant most to him in his own development as a playwright. In particular Cappelen mentions the influence of Ett drömspel (A Dream Play) on Sverre. Berget og Ordet (Sverre. The Mountain and the Word) (1977), an influence that is immediately apparent to the reader. Cappelen’s drama, like Strindberg’s, is a “dreamplay”—polyphonic in structure, steeped in mythological imagery, and focused on the theme of love. But the essential differences between the two plays are equally obvious. Whereas the mythological idiom of Strindberg’s play derives mostly from Hindu sources, Cappelen’s is largely Christian. Strindberg develops a profoundly pessimistic view of human existence in which matter tyrannizes spirit, and love is hopelessly doomed to failure; Cappelen adopts the view that spirit can, and indeed must, sanctify matter. Strindberg means by “love” mostly physical passion (eros), whereas Cappelen means compassion (agape). In Strindberg’s drama mankind is seen as caught in a “dreamplay” initiated by the gods; in this dreamlike illusory existence man looks to woman for redemption but finds his spirit bound to the earth by physical attraction (Maya). In Cappelen’s play, by contrast, dream is the source from which the hero derives strength to sustain his spiritual battle in the historical world of space and time. In Ett drömspel dream sequences are structured polyphonically to express a unifying theme. In Sverre. Berget og Ordet the dream sequences are focused in the central protagonist of the play. Here the unity of character is as important as the unity of theme. And, finally, Strindberg’s protagonists are allegorical and symbolic throughout, whereas Cappelen makes use both of allegorical figures and of characters derived from history. The title figure of this play is one of the most famous kings of medieval Norway, Sverre the priest, whom some have thought of as a saint and others have reviled as a devil.\n\nII\n\nAs Harry Carlson has pointed out in his study Strindberg och myterna (Strindberg and Myths), Ett drömspel constitutes “an incomparable synthesis of elements taken from many sources—Hindu, Greek and biblical mythology, Mahayana Buddhism, Gnosticism, courtly traditions, and the Tales of One-thousand and One Nights.”1 But the controlling mythological framework is clearly derived from Hinduism—a Hinduism, however, as perceived through the radically pessimistic reading of Indian metaphysics by Schopenhauer. Strindberg by and large shared the German philosopher’s view of the world as “a place for atonement, a kind of penal colony.”2 Thus, in Ett drömspel Strindberg develops a mostly negative view of human existence as incapable of redemption through love. Agnes, the daughter of the god Indra, takes on human form in order to experience for herself the cause of human suffering. She attempts three relationships with three different men, but each founders on the irreducible polarity between body and spirit. Agnes eventually retreats to the higher regions from which she has descended, having learned from bitter experience to detach herself from the body and its passion.\n\nInasmuch as Agnes is able to achieve distance from that part of herself that craves “passionate” possession of the material world, she exemplifies the illumined soul Hindu myth speaks of. But in presenting her liberation as possible only through radical removal of the spirit from the physical self, this “klädnad … av blod och smuts” (“dress … of blood and filth”),3 the dramatist gives expression to his own despair rather than to Hindu tradition. All higher religions envision an existence beyond the life of the body, but “illumination” (“grace” in the Christian context) is a function of a changed perspective rather than the shedding of the physical self (disembodiment). Hindu scripture speaks of a liberated individual as one able to live in the material world while maintaining his spiritual freedom. In the Upanishads we find the image of the swan that drinks the milk of the world, but ingests only the cream (the spiritual essence) and not the whey (illusory matter). Analogously, Christian thought makes the reference to the believer who is “in the world” but not “of the world.”\n\nClearly, in Strindberg’s play this religious perspective is not allowed for. Love for him is always a physical force engendering an experience of passion in the original Latin sense of the word (passio from pati, passus), meaning suffering. Love taken in this sense seduces men and women into believing in the possibility of happiness, into nurturing the dream of a partnership in marriage, of creating one being out of two, of achieving unity and security in a transient, manifold world. But in Strindberg’s experience, the lofty ideal of love’s poetry invariably fails before the prose of the everyday tyranny of the trivial. To speak in the language of Hindu myth, the veil of illusion (Maya) is always rent. It would thus appear that the suffering engendered by passionate love is also a teacher, a guide toward detachment from all material being. But again, while erotic love seems to instruct the soul to rise above matter, it paradoxically holds it fast in the round of creation at the same time. Suffering is balanced by desire. Characteristically, Strindberg seeks the cause for the fateful imprisonment of the human soul in this cycle among the gods themselves. Referring to the Hindu myth of creation, he relates how in the beginning of time Brahma permitted himself to be seduced by Maya, that is, by matter, thus creating the universe of space and time in which we exist. One conclusion Strindberg seems to draw from this is that the gods themselves are responsible for the “fall” of the spirit. “Detta det gudomliga urämnets beröring med jordämnet var himlens syndafall.”4\n\nFurthermore, whereas the descendants of the gods, the human race, may struggle to be freed of matter, they are held fast by the paradoxical power of physical love:\n\nMen, för att befrias ur jordämnet, söker Bramas avkomlingar försakelsen och lidandet … Där har du lidandet såsom befriaren … Men denna trängtan till lidandet råkar i strid med begäret att njuta, eller kärleken … förstår du än vad kärleken är, med dess högsta fröjder i de största lidanden, det ljuvaste i det bittraste!5\n\nIII\n\nThe mythological world we meet in Cappelen’s play is essentially different from that found in Ett drömspel, not so much because it is mostly derived from a Christian context rather than Hindu, but because it is based on a radically different concept of love. Echoing the well-known passage from Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians, Chapter 13, the two children who throughout the play function as a mirror to Sverre’s inner struggle, identify themselves with the very core of Christ’s teaching.\n\nJenta: Vi er tro!\n\nGutten: Håp!\n\nBegge: Kjærlighet!6\n\nIt is clear that love in this context does not mean eros, love born of physical desire, but agape, which is identified with the very essence of God. Christianity makes love of God the motive of obedience to His will; and its correlative, love toward men, or compassion, is made the basis of all ethics. An important difference between Christian belief and the Hindu myth is that in the context of the former, God is always conceived of as personal, a benevolent being who directly commands mankind to live by His law of love; Hindu myth conceives of the divine essence in its highest manifestation as pure spirit without personal form. For the Hindu, compassion arises not least from the sympathetic understanding of man’s natural propensity to cling to the forms, rather than the essence, of reality. In Strindberg’s play, the god-being Agnes feels pity for mankind clinging to the ecstasy and, no less, to the suffering engendered by erotic love; but there is almost no expression of compassion between the men and women holding each other captive with their desire and their hate.\n\nFor Sverre the problem of love is not primarily one of physical passion, but he is no stranger to the power of eros either. Consistent with the tradition of the historical king known from the saga, Cappelen introduces Sverre as a young man living happily on the Færoe Islands with his betrothed, a woman by the name of Astrid who bears him several children. Although we have no way of knowing whether the decision to forsake the love of his youth in order to pursue the crown of Norway required great personal sacrifice of Sverre, historians have noted that the king was rather atypical in refusing to compensate his loss by keeping mistresses. Lest this fact be taken as an indication of narrow-minded puritanism, it should also be mentioned that the saga shows that Sverre had complete sympathy for the common man who would rather make love to “den munnfagre Ingunn” (“Ingunn with the beautiful mouth”) than fight the king’s war.\n\nCappelen follows the saga closely in these matters, but in his interpretation, Sverre’s decision to leave Astrid and their children becomes an important element in the king’s moral and religious development. In the play, Astrid, though physically separated from Sverre, continues to represent what the king in his isolated position lacks the most: personal warmth, intimacy, and tenderness—everything that the dramatist renders with the untranslatable term “nærvær” (roughly “presence”).7 But Astrid also continually confronts the king with a challenge. In moments of reflection as well as of crisis, she appears to call on him not to lose sight of his capacity for human sympathy and gentleness in the face of brutality and indifference. In the final act of the play for example, where we find Sverre in his last and most difficult struggle to resist the urge to exact a justified revenge from the defeated enemy, Astrid returns in a dream vision to bring him his children. In keeping with the dramatic device of letting certain figures represent multiple characters (a device Cappelen derives from Strindberg), Sverre and Astrid’s children are played by the same boy and girl who since the opening scenes of the play have functioned as a kind of mirror to Sverre’s thoughts. Here the identification of these two children with Sverre’s own may be taken to indicate that the king has learned to transmute the natural love he bears for his biological children into an all-encompassing sympathy so that his own children are in these returned to him. Thus, in contrast to Strindberg, Cappelen interprets erotic love as capable of guiding the individual to personal growth rather than enslaving him.\n\nThe secret of Sverre’s ability not only to win his political fight, but also to grow in spirit, is his radical orientation to what he perceives to be the will of God. When the children ask him why he is no longer a priest, Sverre answers that perhaps God thought that he could serve Him better as king (46). The hypothetical “perhaps” in this answer goes to the heart of Sverre’s quest. What is the will of God? Sverre is sufficiently certain of his divine command to exercise faith, hope, and charity: he is always committed “to choose the higher or harder path” (19). But how does he know that God wills the priest to cast off his vestments and “seek Him in Norway” in the role of warrior and king? Sverre’s enemies accuse him of being an impostor. They reject the claim that he is a son of king Sigurd Munn and charge that his true ally is not God but Satan. Most historians, however, take at face value Sverre’s own words reported in the king’s saga and quoted almost verbatim by Cappelen:\n\n… skulle Sverre selge seg til djevelen\n\nFor dette usle rikes skyld? Gi sjel\n\nOg sjelehjelp for å bli konge her?8\n\nThese are the words of a genuinely religious man for whom the spiritual significance of life is always the primary consideration. Sverre’s quandary arises from the impossibility of knowing for certain whether it is God’s will to unseat Magnus Erlingsson from power. Magnus saw himself as the vicar of Saint Olaf, rex perpetuus Norvegiae, and the founder of the Norwegian church. Magnus was the first Scandinavian king to be crowned and annointed by a bishop and therefore looked upon his kingship as a sacrament. Hence Sverre’s claim to the throne put him in opposition not only to the ruling king but also to the Church, for which the Pope excommunicated both him and all his supporters. Sverre based his claim on the law of St. Olaf that only heirs descended through the male line were entitled to the throne. Magnus, the son of Sigurd the Crusader’s daughter Kristina, was thus, in Sverre’s eyes, the real impostor, his rule illegal and offensive to God. But it appears that the personal power of Sverre’s commitment derives not so much from legal claims but rather from a continuous dialogue with God in dream visions and, not least, in prayerful silence:\n\nJenta:\n\nHvordan kan du vite hva Gud virkelig vil?\n\nSverre:\n\nJeg lytter etter stemmen Hans.\n\nJenta:\n\nNår hører du den?\n\nSverre:\n\nNår alt\n\nEr taust. Guds røst er lav, den drukner lett\n\nI skrålet fra de tusen stemmer som\n\nVil lokke deg på djev’lens vei.9\n\nCappelen makes use of three of Sverre’s prophetic dreams recorded in the saga. The first dream occurs before Sverre’s mother has revealed to him his royal birth. The young Sverre dreams of an eagle so great that it covers the whole of Norway and he intuits that the eagle is himself. The dramatist combines the other two dreams into a single terrifying vision. Sverre dreams that the prophet Samuel anoints his hands with the power of hate needed to defeat his enemies; but when Sverre begs Samuel to be anointed also with the power of love, he is denied and commanded instead to devour a human body:\n\nDrømmeskikkelsen: Du skal ete, og du vil ete; for det vil Han som rår for alt.\n\nSverre: Jeg kan ikke!\n\nDrømmeskikkelsen: Du må. Om du skall fylle det kall, som dine hender er salvet til. Du må, om du vil vinne fram.10\n\nThe horrible truth is that once Sverre eats as commanded, he can no longer control himself. He is possessed by a bestial desire to eat the whole body including the head, but the dream figure stops him. The dream expresses a profound conflict within Sverre: how to be obedient to God’s will in restoring the rightful ruler to Norway’s throne usurped by an impostor and at the same time be obedient to Christ’s command to love even one’s enemy. Sverre’s quandary is manifested by various other images, for instance, the children enacting the fight of the Crusaders against the pagans holding sacred Jerusalem captive. Their play makes amply clear that God’s warrior can indeed be as godless in his violence as his pagan enemy (21,39). Another poignant expression for Sverre’s struggle to find a synthesis for the various roles required of him is the inscription on his royal seal: “Suerus rex Magnus; ferus ut leo, mitis ut agnus” (28). The images of the furious lion and mild lamb are derived from the New Testament, where the former is identified with the battling, and the latter with the triumphant but merciful, Christ.\n\nHistorians generally agree that nowhere did Sverre demonstrate his humanity more fully than at the siege of Tunsberg, which gave the final blow to Sverre’s opponents. The saga tells us that Sverre successfully appealed to his men not to kill the enemy forced by hunger and cold to abandon their mountain stronghold. The king personally nursed the enemy leader, Reidar Sendemann, back to health but could not himself recover from the enormous deprivations suffered under the siege. He died shortly thereafter. In Cappelen’s play the king’s impending death is adumbrated in the visionary promise of Astrid that they will soon be reunited in the forest of their youth:\n\nHør Sverre, du er framme nå, og snart\n\nEr veien slutt. Da møtes vi påny.11\n\nCappelen has chosen Sverre’s battle for the mountain at Tunsberg as the focal image of the play. Like the castle in Ett drömspel the mountain in Cappelen’s play becomes a symbol of a larger reality. The castle and its accessory buildings (towers, prisons, fortifications) appear frequently in Strindberg’s works. In Ett drömspel the image represents on one level the immaturity of The Officer being held captive; whereas on another, more general level, it symbolizes the world of matter imprisoning the human spirit. When Agnes gives up her body to return to the pure world of spirit, the castle burns while a great chrysanthemum bursts into bloom above it, echoing the Hindu myth that the universe flowers at the moment the illumined soul detaches itself from the transitory and forms of material being. But as is consistent with Strindberg’s metaphysical pessimism, the god-being leaves humanity behind, unredeemed. The Officer, The Lawyer, The Poet, remain captives of the paradoxes of their existence. As the castle burns it lights up the ground to show “en vägg av människoansikten, frågande, sörjande, förtvivlade.”12\n\nIn Cappelen’s play the mountain has multiple meanings. On one hand, it is a physical place, the actual site of a decisive historical battle (A.D. 1201–1202) between King Sverre and the Bagler Party. On the (A.D. 1201–1202) other hand, the mountain symbolizes a spiritual battleground and as such represents an inner reality:\n\nVed dette berg skal hver og én ta opp\n\nSitt valg med Gud. Han ser det er et berg\n\nI deg: et berg av hat og void og is;\n\nDen fienden vil Han du skal vinne på!13\n\nThat mountain can grow, just like the castle in Strindberg’s play, its increase in mass symbolizing violence, hate, and indifference feeding on itself. But once the mountain has been conquered, it takes on a different symbolic significance. It becomes a “mountain of joy,” mons gaudii, or “Feginsbrekka,” as it is called in the historical sources that refer to the slope from which the Crusaders caught the first glimpse of sacred Jerusalem lying before them. In Sverre’s saga the term is used to name the hills (Steinbergene) outside of Nidaros from which Sverre beheld the shrine of St. Olaf on the day (A.D. 1179) of the first important battle in his struggle to win Norway’s crown. In Cappelen’s play “Feginsbrekka” is identified with the presence of God:\n\nGud er nær,\n\nOg under deg er landet heilt i ro.14\n\nRepeatedly throughout the play the children ask Sverre to take them to “Feginsbrekka,” which he promises, praying that it will not “be washed away by blood” (61). But instead of bloodshed, the siege of Tunsberg ends in peace. The play concludes with Sverre taking the children to show them “the mountain of joy.” Matter has been sanctified by the spirit of compassion.\n\nIV\n\nWe must also consider briefly how in each play the idea of life as a dream is related to the dramatic structure. Gunnar Brandell and others have pointed out that the perception of life’s illusory or dreamlike nature can be found in Strindberg’s works as early as the 1880s. This perception was deepened by the so-called Inferno crisis and may well be the reason why Strindberg later referred to the first play he wrote after the crisis, Till Damaskus (To Damascus) (1898), as his “first dream play.” But it is one thing to say that life is a dream, meaning that it is illusory or nightmarish, quite another to conceive of dramatic technique based on the alogical aesthetic of nocturnal dreams. In the note prefacing Ett drömspel Strindberg developed his concept of the dream on which he modeled the dramaturgy of his play. Dream images may appear incoherent, he says, but they express patterns of meaning. Ordinary space and time do not exist; past, present, future, different physical locations interfuse each other. Persons double, split, expand and contract. And, finally, dream experiences are focused in the “dreamer,” who acts as a narrator but does not evaluate or interpret the dream.\n\nThe last statement is probably the most crucial and has caused considerable discussion and disagreement among interpreters of Strindberg. How is that unifying consciousness, the dreamer, actually represented in the play? Is it Strindberg’s alter ego, The Poet? Is it Agnes? Or is it perhaps an abstract “bisexual psyche projecting its extended experience of life through a number of dramatis personae?”15 In staging Ett drömspel in 1970, Ingmar Bergman opted for the first reading, locating the dream in the mind of The Poet, who remained seated at a table on stage during the entire play. It would seem that Bergman’s interpretation is justified by what the play has to say on the relation of poetry to dream and reality:\n\nDiktaren: … Vad är dikt?\n\nDottern: Ej verklighet, men mer än verklighet … ej dröm, men vakna drömmar.…16\n\nBut Carlson points out that Bergman’s solution in effect “demythologizes” the play.17 If we take seriously the metaphysical model given in Ett drömspel as an aesthetic representation of the dream nature of existence resulting from the seduction of the spiritual principle of creativity (Brahma) by the material principle (Maya), then we must conclude that the illusory dream is indeed the god’s dream. The dream amounts to the illusory forms woven by the seductress before the eyes of the god held captive by her spell.18 Furthermore, not only the god dreams, but the human personae populating the divine dream, dream of each other. In the play we are thus dealing not with a single (divine) consciousness in which all the dream sequences are made to focus, but with at least four others who project themselves and each other in their dreams, namely, Agnes, The Officer, The Lawyer, and The Poet.\n\nIn this metaphysical model effectively represented through the dramatic structure and technique of Ett drömspel, The Poet has a special role to play. On one hand, the ontological status of poetry, too, has been assimilated to that of the dream because The Poet, like all human beings, is a captive of Maya. And yet, by virtue of his heightened sensibility and the power of his imagination, The Poet is able to catch glimpses of the potential freedom of the soul. He is a dreamer but he dreams “vakna drömmar” (“wide-awake dreams”). And furthermore, although The Poet’s visions cannot liberate the soul, at least they give comfort and encouragement to humanity:\n\nDiktaren: Och mänskobarnen tro att vi diktare blott leka … hitta på och finna upp!\n\nDottern: Väl är det, min vän, ty eljes skulle världen läggas öde av brist på uppmuntran. Alla skulle ligga på rygg och titta åt himlen; ingen skulle ta i tu med plog och spade, hyvel eller hacka.19\n\nTurning to Sverre. Berget og Ordet, we see that consistent with the different underlying mythos, dream finds another kind of expression in the dramatic structure of this play. It has been said of the historical Sverre that “his destiny was the realization of a dream.”20 The king was an intensely practical man who kept both feet firmly planted on the earth, but he was also a dreamer, a visionary, who just as firmly believed in the primacy of spirit over matter—and acted accordingly. The action of the play is thus unified thematically by Sverre’s religious vision.\n\nBut the action also consists of dreams in the specific and concrete sense, and in contrast to Ett drömspel, there can be little doubt about who the dreamer is in this play. Possibly due to the influence of Bergman’s stage version of Strindberg’s drama, Cappelen locates the dream sequences comprising the action in the mind of Sverre, who is seen kneeling in prayer before a cross during most of the play. What Cappelen calls “drømmesyn” (“dream visions”) are thus the images passing before the inner eye of the king as he responds to the spiritual challenge posed by the historical siege at Tunsberg.\n\nAs in Ett drömspel, ordinary space and time have been suspended in Sverre’s “dream visions.” The action takes place both before Tunsberg in the years 1201–1202 and 25 years earlier at Kirkubø on the Færoe Islands, as well as at various other times and different places in Norway and Sweden. The fact that Sverre is seen kneeling in prayer may be taken either to suggest his prayerful and meditative stance throughout the protracted struggle he fought with himself, not only during the long winter of 1201–1202, but during all the years since first raising his claim to the Norwegian throne; or it may be taken, more literally, to suggest that the action represents memories of past experiences, thoughts, and feelings flashing through Sverre’s mind during an hour of decision.\n\nAnother important aspect of time in Cappelen’s play is the passage of the seasons. In Ett drömspel hours, months, and years pass instantaneously. Trees sprout green leaves only to lose them but a moment later. Characters change from youth to old age in no time at all. On the other hand a minute may seem as long as a year. Altogether the imagery suggests that neither the actual seasons nor time measured by the clock corresponds meaningfully to human experience. In Sverre. Berget og Ordet by contrast, the imagery of the changing seasons serves as a primary vehicle to express the development of character.\n\nWhen Sverre began the siege before Tunsberg he was in the fifty-first year of his life, but it was also his last year because he did not survive his victory for more than a few weeks. Consequently at the beginning of the play we find him in the prime of his life, symbolized by the seasonal correlative of summer. Decline and death are as yet held at bay:\n\nJenta: Gå, gå høst og død\n\nVi jager deg med sommergrein.…21\n\nBut as the siege lengthens into winter, the hardships suffered take their toll. Sverre’s soldiers clamor for relief from hunger and the cold; they demand that Sverre lift the siege or take the mountain by force, sparing none of the enemy. In his despair Sverre’s dream of Astrid for a moment turns into possessive jealousy. He envisions her with another man and calls her a bitch and a whore. And finally, giving in to his soldiers, the king condemns a deserter to death and, watching his execution, collapses in agony.\n\nIt is during this most difficult phase that two allegorical figures are introduced: “coldness,” represented by Bishop Nikolas, the leader of Sverre’s enemies; and “violence.” Through these allegorical figures the season of winter is identified with indifference, hatred, and revenge. Yet the imagery also makes clear that beneath snow and ice there awaits new life. Christmas, the day of the birth of Christ, occurs during the darkest period of the year but it carries with it the promise that the light will return. And Sverre does win the struggle over himself and over his soldiers. When the enemy comes down from the mountain, Sverre offers peace and water from a spring identified with the name of St. Olaf. The year is reborn and so is hope. Astrid returns bearing green branches and bringing Sverre’s children:\n\nAstrid: Tidshjulet snurrer Sverre, og nå har\n\nDet dreiet rundt.22\n\nThe image of the turning wheel of time, once more, suggests a number of possibilities. Most obviously it refers to the renewal of spring after the change of the seasons. The context also strongly suggests that the image of the wheel that has turned points to the completion of Sverre’s life work. The burden will now be lifted from his shoulders and he will return to Kirkubø—in death. But finally, the turning wheel may refer to the hope, Sverre’s dream, that the victory achieved at Tunsberg will usher in a new era, fulfilling the command of Christ to replace the law of an “eye for an eye” with a law of compassion.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Sv., p. 39. “The Dream Figure: Ycu shall eat, and you want to eat; for He who governs all wishes it so. Sverre: I cannot! The Dream Figure: You must. If you are to follow the call for which your hands are anointed. You must, if you would triumph.”\n\n11. Sv., p. 67. “Sverre, you have arrived now, and soon / The path will end, Then we shall meet again.”\n\n12. SS, p. 330. “… a wall of human faces, questioning, sorrowing, despairing.”\n\n13. Sv., pp. 69–70. “At this mountain, everyone shall take up / His choice with God. He sees there is a mountain / In you: a mountain of hate and violence and ice; / That enemy He wants you to defeat!”\n\n14. Sv., p. 25. “God is near, / And under you the country is at peace.”\n\n15. Birgitta Steene, The Greatest Fire: A Study of August Strindberg (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1973), p. 99.\n\n16. SS, p. 301. “The Poet: What is poetry? The Daughter: Not reality, but more than reality … not dreaming, but waking dreams.…”\n\n17. Carlson, pp. 183–84.\n\n18. It may be relevant to point out that this model is not consistent with the mainstream of Hindu philosophy. According to the Upanishads, Brahma is the spellbinder and Maya his creation: “He is the Magician, Maya His magic spell, the universe is the illusion projected by Him on Himself as the only substantial background.” Swami Nirvedananda, Hinduism at a Glance, 4th edition (Calcutta: Ramakrishna Mission, 1969), p. 173.\n\n19. SS, p. 301–302. “The Poet: And the children of man think we poets only play … invent and make up! The Daughter: And that is good, my friend; otherwise the world would be laid waste for lack of encouragement. Everyone would lie on his back looking up at the sky; no one would put his hand to the plow and spade, plane or hoe.”\n\n20. Paasche, p. 216.\n\n21. Sv., p. 13. “Go, Go autumn and death / We chase you with summer boughs.”\n\n22. Sv., p. 67. “The wheel of time is spinning, Sverre, and now / it has come round.”"
