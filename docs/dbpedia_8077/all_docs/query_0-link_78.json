        "text": "PROLOGUE\n\nThe background represents cloud banks that resemble corroding slate cliffs with ruins of castles and fortresses.\n\nThe constellations of Leo, Virgo, and Libra are visible, and from their midst the planet Jupiter is shining with a strong light.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER OF INDRA stands on the topmost cloud.\n\nTHE VOICE OF INDRA [from above].\n\nWhere are you, daughter, where?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nHere, father, here.\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nYou’ve lost your way, my child—beware, you sink—\n\nHow got you there?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nI followed from ethereal heights the ray\n\nOf lightning, and for car a cloud I took—\n\nIt sank, and now my journey downward tends.\n\nO, noble father, Indra, tell what realms\n\nI now draw near? The air is here so close,\n\nAnd breathing difficult.\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nBehind you lies the second world; the third\n\nIs where you stand. From Cukra, morning star\n\nYou have withdrawn yourself to enter soon\n\nThe vapoury circle of the earth. For mark\n\nThe Seventh House you take. It’s Libra called:\n\nThere stands the day-star in the balanced hour\n\nWhen Fall gives equal weight to night and day.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nYou named the earth—is that the ponderous world\n\nAnd dark, that from the moon must take its light?\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nIt is the heaviest and densest sphere\n\nOf all that travel through the space.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nAnd is it never brightened by the sun?\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nOf course, the sun does reach it—now and then——\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nThere is a rift, and downward goes my glance——\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nWhat sees my child?\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nI see—O beautiful!—with forests green,\n\nWith waters blue, white peaks, and yellow fields——\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nYes, beautiful as all that Brahma made—\n\nBut still more beautiful it was of yore,\n\nIn primal morn of ages. Then occurred\n\nSome strange mishap; the orbit was disturbed;\n\nRebellion led to crime that called for check——\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nNow from below I hear some sounds arise—\n\nWhat sort of race is dwelling there?\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nSee for yourself—Of Brahma’s work no ill\n\nI say: but what you hear, it is their speech.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nIt sounds as if—it has no happy ring!\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nI fear me not—for even their mother-tongue\n\nIs named complaint. A race most hard to please,\n\nAnd thankless, are the dwellers on the earth——\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nO, say not so—for I hear cries of joy,\n\nHear noise and thunder, see the lightnings flash—\n\nNow bells are ringing, fires are lit,\n\nAnd thousand upon thousand tongues\n\nSing praise and thanks unto the heavens on high—\n\nToo harshly, father, you are judging them.\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nDescend, that you may see and hear, and then\n\nReturn and let me know if their complaints\n\nAnd wailings have some reasonable ground——\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nWell then, I go; but, father, come with me.\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nNo, there below I cannot breathe——\n\nTHE DAUGHTER.\n\nNow sinks the cloud—what sultriness—I choke!\n\nI am not breathing air, but smoke and steam—\n\nWith heavy weight it drags me down,\n\nAnd I can feel already how it rolls—\n\nIndeed, the best of worlds is not the third——\n\nTHE VOICE.\n\nThe best I cannot call it, nor the worst.\n\nIts name is Dust; and like them all, it rolls:\n\nAnd therefore dizzy sometimes grows the race,\n\nAnd seems to be half foolish and half mad—\n\nTake courage, child—a trial, that is all!\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. [Kneeling as the cloud sinks downwar.\n\nI sink!\n\nCurtain.\n\nTHE DREAM PLAY\n\nThe background represents a forest of gigantic hollyhocks in bloom. They are white, pink, crimson, sulphureous, violet; and above their tops is seen the gilded roof of a castle, the apex of which is formed by a bud resembling a crown. At the foot of the castle walls stand a number of straw ricks, and around these stable litter is scattered. The side-scenes, which remain unchanged throughout the play, show conventionalised frescoes, suggesting at once internal decoration, architecture, and landscape.\n\nEnter THE GLAZIER and THE DAUGHTER.\n\nTHE DAUGHTER. The castle is growing higher and higher above the ground. Do you see how much it has grown since last year?\n\nTHE GLAZIER. [To himself] I have never seen this castle before—have never heard of a castle that grew, but—[To THE DAUGHTER, with firm conviction] Yes, it has grown two yards, but that is because they have manured it—and if you notice, it has put out a wing on the sunny"
