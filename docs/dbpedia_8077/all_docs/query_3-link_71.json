        "text": "Shaw described Ibsen and Strindberg as \"the giants of the theatre of our time\". Even today we are haunted by their presence, as this year's theatre schedules prove. The two men were not exactly best buddies and still arouse fierce, partisan passions. Henrik Ibsen actually kept a portrait of his arch enemy, August Strindberg, in his study after 1895; he dubbed it \"Madness incipient\". For his part, Strindberg attacked the \"swinery\" of A Doll's House and claimed in 1892 that his 10-year war against Ibsen \"cost me my wife, children, fortune and career\".\n\nIt is tempting to see the two men as inherently antithetical. On the one hand, Ibsen: sane, progressive, rational, formal. On the other, Strindberg: neurotic, reactionary, religious, fragmented. Michael Meyer, translator and biographer of both,wrote: \"Ibsen's characters think and speak logically and consecutively: Strindberg's dart backwards and forwards. They do not think, or speak, ABCDE but AQBZC.\"\n\nI see the two men as violent, necessary opposites, who between them laid the foundations of modern drama. From Ibsen we learned about the interaction of private and public, the beauty of structure and the idea of the dramatist as spokesperson: \"What he lives through,\" Ibsen once said, \"all of his countrymen live through together with him.\" From Strindberg we learned about sexual madness, fluidity of form and the power of dreams. Far more than Chekhov, whose symphonic realism is impossible not to admire but fatal to emulate, the two playwrights have shaped our drama: Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, John Osborne and Harold Pinter, Caryl Churchill and Sarah Kane are all hugely indebted to them, even when apparently rejecting their influence.\n\nAlthough by taste and temperament I prefer Ibsen, he seems the harder figure to grasp. That may be partly because of a fatal 1891 photograph that shows a quasi-biblical patriarch glaring out at us from behind mutton-chop whiskers. But it is also partly because of a caricature idea of the plays all too accurately summed up by Tyrone Guthrie in A Life in the Theatre: \"High thinking takes place in a world of dark-crimson serge tablecloths with chenille hobbles, black horsehair sofas, wall brackets and huge intellectual women in raincoats and rubbers.\"\n\nBut that image reflects bad, old Ibsen stagings; today a whole host of directors have freed us from the tyranny of furniture and shown us that Ibsen can be spare, ironic, witty and sexy. What also perennially strikes me about Ibsen is his raging modernity. As long as human beings - and not just women - are trapped by an imprisoning domesticity, A Doll's House will arouse shivers of recognition. His rarely seen play Pillars of Society demonstrates the dangers of sacrificing public safety to private profit. And watching Tony Blair dismissing his critics on Newsnight recently, I was reminded of Dr Stockmann in An Enemy of the People, and his unshakable belief that \"the minority is always right\".\n\nIbsen is still our contemporary. But I suspect we talk too much about his themes and not enough about the immaculate nature of his form: because the \"well-made play\" is now a dirty word, we tend to think of Ibsen as locked into a dated, 19th-century formula. In reality, Ibsen reminds us that structure is meaning and that there is a moral and aesthetic thrill in the moment of revelation.\n\nFor a classic example, take Brand. The hero is a fanatically uncompromising preacher who flames \"like the sword of God\". But at the play's exact mid-point he is faced with an agonising choice: unless he leaves his mountain fastness and flies south, his child will die. His first instinct is to flee. At which point the local doctor says: \"So merciless towards your flock, so lenient towards yourself.\" That one line, rich in multilayered irony since the doctor actually approves Brand's double standard, becomes the pivot on which the whole play turns.\n\nThe standard argument against Ibsen is that, compared with Strindberg, he is dry, sexless and lacks fantasy. But the more Ibsen I see, the more ridiculous the charge looks. Indeed, it is precisely because he fights against his own buttoned-up nature and the puritanical constraints of his time that the sexuality in Ibsen is so strong. There is a moment in A Doll's House when Nora brandishes a silk stocking in front of the adoring Dr Rank that is electrifyingly erotic. And, far from being prosaically naturalistic, Ibsen's plays reveal a constant, unresolved tension between realism and symbolism. If Pinter writes about \"the weasel under the cocktail cabinet\", Ibsen constantly reveals the troll lurking in the drawing room, as when Nora dances the wild tarantella that releases her sexual demons.\n\nEven if for me Ibsen is second only to Shakespeare, I concede that Strindberg takes us into areas that the sage of Skien does not easily penetrate. You only have to read the preface to Miss Julie to see that Strindberg envisioned the kind of theatre we all now recognise: one that banished needless intervals, removed painted props and scenery, simplifed mask-like make-up and was based on a collaborative intimacy. If we could have, he wrote, \"first and foremost a small stage and a small auditorium, then perhaps a new drama might emerge and the theatre might once again become a place for educated people\".\n\nStrindberg also wrote about sex with absolute realism, dramatising the compound of love, hate, fury and desire that characterises random couplings and permanent relationships. If Ibsen caught the tensions of the night before, Strindberg revealed the acrid taste of the morning after. Miss Julie is always seen as a play about class in which a servant's rise is accompanied by a mistress's fall. But the really radical thing about this 1888 tragedy is that Strindberg puts on stage something never heard before: the ugly sound of post-coital recrimination. After their midsummer night's fling, Miss Julie and her valet both dream of romantic flight but turn on each other like tigers. \"So what shall we do?\" asks Jean. \"Go away,\" says Miss Julie. \"To torment each other to death?\" he instinctively enquires.\n\nThe idea of sex as a battleground and marriage as a lifelong torment is partly what makes Strindberg seem so modern: there is a straight line connecting plays like The Dance of Death and The Father with Osborne's Look Back in Anger and Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? But, in his late plays, Strindberg also captures the phantasmagoric nature of existence far more explicitly than Ibsen. In A Dream Play, the daughter of the god Indra acquires earthly form in order to understand the reasons for humanity's misery. In Storm, a dying old man sees fragments of his past life in subliminal lightning flashes.\n\nMy own sense of Strindberg's modernity was enhanced a few years back when I directed his play The Stronger in tandem with Pinter's The Lover. In The Stronger, a married woman confronts a female friend in a cafe; slowly it dawns on the prattling wife that the latter's conspicuous silence means that she was her husband's lover. With economic mastery, Strindberg leaves you questioning whether it is the implacably lonely mistress or the nervously surviving wife who is the stronger of the two. This seemed to me then, and still does, to connect directly to Pinter, who poses exactly the same questions: whether power is an integral part of sex and whether infidelity, real or imagined, is the best way of sustaining marriage.\n\nEven though we still ignore large swathes of their work, Ibsen and Strindberg are the two indispensable props of modern drama. As Eric Bentley once wrote, Strindberg \"lived out all the phases of modern militancy and modern defeatism\" and seemed to embrace everything from juvenile radicalism to a final mystical mix of science and occultism. But if I had to seize on any one quality that made him seem our contemporary, it would be his astonishing sexual candour. Ibsen seems more cloaked and guarded, yet his plays address issues that still obsess us today: the conflict between reality and illusion, heredity and environment, individual self-fulfilment and society, the life and the work. I can't imagine modern drama without either of the Scandinavian masters."
