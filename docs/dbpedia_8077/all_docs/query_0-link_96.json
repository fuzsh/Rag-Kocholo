        "text": "Performances Run July 19 – August 12\n\n“I’ve seen what you can never see… I’ve seen the way she is when you’re not there.”\n\n(Lenox, MA) – Shakespeare & Company presents August Strindberg’s dark comedy Creditors, adapted by critically acclaimed playwright David Greig and directed by Nicole Ricciardi of last season’s hit show 4000 Miles. In this production of what Strindberg calls his “most mature work,” three characters must face their past, confronting love, debt, and deception. Performances run from July 19 – August 12 in the Elayne P. Bernstein Theatre.\n\n“August Strindberg often noted that he wrote plays to work things out in his own life,” said director Nicole Ricciardi. “His interest lay in ‘revealing the unconscious through the language of the conscious.’ I’m drawn to projects for a similar reason: to bring something from my unconscious to my conscious. I first saw Mr. Greig’s adaptation of Creditors in 2008. I recall recognizing myself, at moments, in all three of the characters. For who among us hasn’t committed oneself to another, be it a friend or a lover, and lost something in the process? In some way, we all know the cost of love.”\n\nNicole Ricciardi returns for her sixth season at Shakespeare & Company after last season’s sell-out 4000 Miles. Past credits include The Taming (2017), The How and the Why (2016), and Cassandra Speaks (2013). The cast features Shakespeare & Company veterans Jonathan Epstein (Gustav), Ryan Winkles (Adolph), and Kristin Wold (Tekla). The creative team includes John McDermott (Set Design), James W. Bilnoski (Lighting Design), Deborah A. Brothers (Costume Design), Amy Altadonna (Sound Design), and Maegan Alyse Passafume (Stage Manager).\n\nStrindberg is once again the master of the psychological chess match that is inhabiting each other’s minds in this stunning translation by David Greig, recipient of the prestigious John Whiting Award. For Strindberg the cost of love runs deep, honesty is a disguise and everyone owes something to someone.\n\nTickets for Creditors are available online at shakespeare.org or by calling Shakespeare & Company’s box office at (413) 637-3353. The Elayne P. Bernstein Theatre is air-conditioned and wheelchair accessible. Shakespeare & Company is located at 70 Kemble St. in Lenox, Massachusetts. In addition to Creditors, the Company’s 2018 Summer Season includes three Shakespeare plays: Macbeth, As You Like It, and Love’s Labor’s Lost; plus Heisenberg by Laurence Olivier Award winner Simon Stephens; Mothers and Sons by Tony Award-winning playwright Terrence McNally; and HIR by Pulitzer Prize finalist Taylor Mac.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nPRODUCTION: Creditors\n\nPLAYWRIGHT: August Strindberg\n\nADAPTOR: David Greig\n\nDIRECTOR: Nicole Ricciardi\n\nSET DESIGNER: John McDermott\n\nLIGHTING DESIGNER: James W.

MFA, Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nABOUT AUGUST STRINDBERG\n\n(Playwright) Johan August Strindberg was a Swedish author and playwright whose work engaged the concepts of naturalism and expressionism. He was born in Stockholm on January 22, 1849, to an unsuccessful shipping agent and a maidservant. He attended the University of Uppsala, but he would often leave to act at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, teach, or write plays. He left Uppsala permanently in 1872 to work as a journalist and a librarian at the Royal Library in Stockholm. In 1879, Strindberg published his novel “The Red Room,” making him famous in Sweden. His play Master Olof, a historical drama published in 1872, was finally performed in 1881, and he wrote several plays criticizing social conventions in Sweden, including Lucky Peter’s Travels (1882), The Father (1887), Miss Julie (1888), Creditors (1888), The Stronger (1888), and Playing With Fire (1892). During the 1890s, Strindberg suffered from psychological and emotional stress, which he described in his novel “Inferno,” that culminated in his adoption of mysticism. The post-“Inferno” period was more productive for Strindberg. He wrote thirty-six plays from 1898 to 1909, including To Damascus (1898), a trilogy, Gustav Vasa (1899), Erik The Fourteenth (1899), Easter (1900), The Dance of Death (1900), A Dream Play (1901), Queen Christina (1901), Storm (1907), The Ghost Sonata (1907), and The Great Highway (1909). He died in Stockholm on May 14, 1912.\n\nABOUT DAVID GREIG\n\n(Adaptor) David Greig is an acclaimed and award-winning playwright, whose plays include The Events (Traverse, Scotland, and Young Vic), The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart (Tron, National Theatre of Scotland), Midsummer (Traverse, Soho, and Tricycle), Dunsinane (RSC at Hampstead and National Theatre of Scotland), Damascus (Traverse, Scotland, and Tricycle), Outlying Islands (Traverse and Royal Court), The American Pilot (RSC), Pyrenees (Paines Plough), The Cosmonaut’s Last Message to the Woman He Once Loved in the Former Soviet Union (Donmar Warehouse and Paines Plough), and The Architect and Europe (Traverse).
