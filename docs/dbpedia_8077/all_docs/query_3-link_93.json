        "text": "One of the most important figures of 19th century drama, Swedish August Strindberg’s 1888 play Miss Julie is a rich, complex work open to begetting different interpretations. The play is only one act and set mostly in a kitchen on a midsummer’s eve with three main characters who become Miss Julie, the daughter of the Count, footman Jean and cook Christene. An upper class, noble character Julie’s wish to get out of the class and sexual constraints of the society results in a flirtation followed by a sexual intimacy that brings about her tragic doom in a scene of hypnosis at the end of the play. As the night proceeds, the relationship between Julie and Jean turns into a power battle and presents a rich pattern that could be analyzed within stylistic features and devices. The play allows exploring how power relations between characters are indicated in speech acts, turn-taking, dramatic irony and other features of conversational structure especially uncovering who is in control or how one builds up power over one another. A stylistic analysis of their interactions acknowledges the exchange of power between them the degree to which Jean imposes a set of gradually growing attitudes of authority and the degree to which Julie endeavors to resist with her social status privilege. In that battle of power Julie’s descend or ‘fall’ from upstairs to the kitchen is replaced by Jean’s authoritarian rise which is in accordance with the rise of the sun. Therefore the aim of this study is to adopt a closer look on how the strength gained by social status or personal characteristics clash and change hands in the course of the play which could be revealed with reference to power in various forms as Miss Julie’s social power over Jean because she is from upper class clashes with Jean’s personal power over her as he is confident, proud and ambitious.\n\n“Miss Julie via Manda Björling 1906-1912: embodiment, conceptual blending, and reception.” Theater Symposium. Vol. 27. Official journal of the Southeastern Theatre Conference (SETC). Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama Press, 2019. 53-67. At the time of its premiere in the capital city of Stockholm in 1906, August Strindberg’s Miss Julie was already eighteen years old and familiar to audiences only as a published text and not through performance. It was, therefore, already a “historical” text, although this early production heralded the birth of the Intimate Theatre and marked the beginning of this play’s remarkably long career on Swedish and international stages throughout the Twentieth Century. As a text and in performance, Miss Julie requires critical study informed by cognitive science, particularly with respect to conceptual blending, conceptual metaphor, and theories of emotion. The composing of Miss Julie was the result of embodied processes of conceptual blending arising from Strindberg’s circumstances, relationships, emotions and milieu. The characters, especially Miss Julie, are potential embodiments of socio-cultural notions of gender, class, and hereditary, even racialized, traits and dispositions. The 1906 production particularly emphasizes the issue of the performer’s body in relation to the text, and especially the actor’s physicality being compared with the fictive body of the character. What was it for a (gendered) body to perform as Julie for a (gendered) audience more familiar with their own embodied “blends” of the character? This paper applies a cognitive approach in analyzing primary sources detailing audience responses to Manda Linderoth-Björling in the title role. Accompanying the reception of Björling is an issue that emerges in nearly all subsequent productions of Miss Julie, namely the effects of contemporary actors embodying an historical text.\n\nIn 2012 we published the first English-language edition of Didaskalia. We now present the second issue, containing a selection of texts printed in our magazine between 2011-2013. The articles and interviews chosen for publication present the key phenomena in Polish theater, as well as the current academic interests and methodological approaches to theater history and today’s theater in contemporary theater studies. We begin with texts that deal with the reinterpretation of the Jerzy Grotowski’s work. Grotowski, Women, and Homosexuals: Marginal Notes to the “Human Drama” might be seen as an extension of Agata Adamiecka-Sitek’s reflections on gender in Grotowski’s theater contained in the “The Gender of the Performer” (co-written by Weronika Szczawińska), found in the previous English-language issue. This time the critic analyzes Apocalypsis cum figuris (chiefly based on the recording of the performance), demonstrating the dramatization of the misogynist discourse of psychoanalysis and male homosexuality in the play. This work polemicizes with interpretations to date, and serves as a point of departure for discussions on Grotowski’s work and the methodology of researching the history of theater contained in Adamiecka-Sitek’s correspondence with Leszek Kolankiewicz. In the following part we publish texts dealing with the issue of “negative performativity,” which appeared in Didaskalia in the context of works by Judith Halberstam and Bojana Kunst. Joanna Jopek transplants this concept in the context of Polish visual and performative art by Oskar Dawicki, Joanna Rajkowska, and Cezary Bodzianowski, indicating the anti-political, critical potential of failure that it contains. An important point of reference in her study is a pair of interviews with Oskar Dawicki. In these conversations the author less illuminates the process of making the film Perfomer (devoted to his work) than gives extremely different responses to the same questions, continuing his game with the image of the artist. Part Three, on the other hand, is entirely devoted to new Polish theater, though it closely corresponds with the issues raised in the preceding sections. In the article “Embarrassing Performances by Losers: Counterhistories of Political Theater,” Marcin Kościelniak focuses on counterhistory theater projects, putting forward the thesis that they “are most insightful in our day in realizing the postulates of political art and are creating the most fascinating and vital movement in Polish theater.” Isolating three models of writing counterhistories for stage, the author analyzes projects by duos of dramaturgs and directors: Paweł Demirski and Monika Strzępka, Jolanta Janiczak and Wiktor Rubin, and Marcin Cecko and Krzysztof Garbaczewski. His theoretical reflections are supplemented by a conversation with Justyna Wasilewska on her work on the title role in Marcin Cecko and Krzysztof Garbaczewski’s Balladyna. The subject of creating the image of the artist returns in two more texts, where it is shifted into media discourse and its impact on the reception of art. In her article “Covered/Uncovered: Memory Games in the Promised Theater” Małgorzata Dziewulska examines promotional strategies in theaters and the media discourse that accompanied two chronologically remote premieres: Jerzy Jarocki’s Dream of the Sinless of 1979 and Krzysztof Warlikowski’s (A)pollonia of 2009. She points out that the discrepancy between the advertisements for the performances before the premiere and the final form of the plays affected the content of the reviews, and ultimately modified the plays themselves. Monika Kwaśniewska, in turn, analyzes Jan Klata’s strategies of self-depiction, tracing his statements in the media. Kwaśniewska wonders what happened to make Klata (presently the director of the National Stary Theater in Krakow) the face of the new political theater, thereafter evolving into the “specialist on Polishness,” an “expert” on national issues. The subject of the texts in the final section is the phenomenon of the choir in contemporary theater. The texts by Ewa Guderian-Czaplińska and Agata Łuksza on two projects by Marta Górnicka at the Theater Institute in Warsaw – [‘hu:r kobj+] (“[ˈkɔːrəs əv wɪmən]”) (a play made with amateurs, dealing with the place of women in culture) and Requiemmachine (a performance that uses pieces by Władysław Broniewski to comment on the neo-liberal labor model) – are summed up by a conversation with the artist. In the interview “I Sing the Body Electric” Marta Górnicka speaks of the concept of the choir, created by individuals. She calls the language in her play a kind of speech cleansed of psychology, recalling the sound of a computer or a machine. The director relates the process of creating a choir, and the work in creating a new actor/performer through training sessions during rehearsals. The motif of the theatrical chorus branches out into various themes, lending itself to feminist, historical, political, and aesthetic reflections, concerning the phenomenon of musicality in the theater.\n\nBy the beginning of modernity, a new horizon was composed by the middle class who abrogated hierarchy and monarchy by viewing social identity through the lens of the economy, hence capitalism emerged and social identity became vitally dependent on economic power. Traumatic effects of social stratification and social conflicts leading to tremendous endeavor to bridge a gap between high and lower classes of society were of the most important purposes of Marxist writers. It should be mentioned that Carl Marx defined the scaffolds of the society in relation to struggle between high and lower strata of the society. Marxism is defined during the history as a plethora of conflicts between major classes of the society who are suppressing majority and suppressed minority to at conflict leads to a social change. Strindberg's play “Miss Julie” is a naturalistic tragedy but it also includes social stratification and social conflicts between two classes of the society with symbolic characters in a symbolic setting. Court's house, the setting of the play, symbolizes a capitalist society in which Miss Julie and John belong to different classes of the society. John is a waiter and Miss Julie is the mistress of the house and symbol of a high-class person. What is outstanding in this play is the hidden structure of the play, emerging through detail and tone, is based on the special relationship between class and sex. Strindberg juxtaposes these two characters who are the symbol of different classes by strings of Marxism in the play. Strindberg also put strings of the idea that if a person from aristocrat family makes a relationship with a lower class one, it would be taken as her fall down and if a person makes relation with a higher class of the society it works as a ladder to better his position in society. As in the play, John who is aware of his position always warned Julie about the dangers of their relation and always care about his position when he refused to call Julie ''Dear''. As John used this relation as a mean to improve his status in society he symbolically rebelled against the capitalist society which led to another capitalism at the end of the play. This paper respectively is going to delve into the Marxism, social stratification and shed light on the social conflicts in Strindberg's play “Miss Julie”."
