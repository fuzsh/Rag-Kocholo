        "text": "Strindberg’s Ett drömspel and Hofmannsthal’s Die Frau ohne Schatten\n\nRochelle Wright\n\nThe central theme of both August Strindberg’s Ett drömspel (A Dream Play, 1902, premiered 1907) and Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s libretto to Die Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman without a Shadow, 1916, premiered 1919) is the quest for what is essentially human. The structural frameworks of the two theatrical pieces are correspondingly similar. In both the play and the opera, the character who is the central bearer of the theme, Indra’s Daughter and The Empress respectively, is the daughter of a spirit-lord who descends to earth from a higher realm in order to experience earthly life and ultimately to form a judgment about it.1 The main characters in both works are initiated and educated through suffering to come to the realization that true humanity and fulfillment of the self are achieved only through transcendence of the individual ego.\n\nSince the most obvious difference between Ett drömspel and Die Frau ohne Schatten is the dimension of music—the latter work was of course set by Richard Strauss—it deserves initial mention that Strindberg intended his play to be performed to musical accompaniment, and such has often been the case. Although Strindberg’s own musical suggestions, most of them excerpts from works by Beethoven,2 generally have been ignored, the Göteborg production of 1916, for instance, featured music by the well-known Swedish composer Wilhelm Stenhammar.3 Many commentators, beginning with the author, have remarked on the musical structure of the play itself.4 Its various thematic strands function like a musical theme with variations, whereas Indra’s Daughter’s refrain, “Det är synd om människorna” (“human beings are to be pitied”), may be compared to a leitmotif. Furthermore, Strindberg’s text has inspired not one, but two operas. Julius Weismann’s Ein Traumspiel, in three acts with an orchestral prelude, was written in 1922–24 and premiered in Duisburg the year following its completion. Weismann also set two other Strindberg plays, Svanevit (Schwanenweiß or Swanwhite) and Spoksonaten (Die Gespenstersonate or The Ghost Sonata).5 The contemporary Australian composer Malcolm Williamson borrowed Strindberg’s central symbol for the title of his The Growing Castle. Premiered in Wales in 1968, the opera has been performed both in Sweden and the United States.6 Although neither work shows sign of entering the standard operatic repertory, the prominent critic Walter Berendsohn has suggested that Weismann’s Strindberg operas might succeed in the playwright’s native land,7 and Williamson’s opera received generally favorable reviews, particularly in the United States.8 A comparison of the interrelationship between text and music in the operas based on Ett drömspel with that of the Hofmannsthal-Strauss collaboration must, however, remain beyond the scope of this study.\n\nBoth Strindberg and Hofmannsthal drew their inspiration in part from Eastern tradition; the god Indra and Strindberg’s fascination with the life-as-dream topos in Ett drömspel derive from Hinduism and Buddhism respectively, while Hofmannsthal wove many motifs from the Thousand and One Nights into his Oriental tapestry.9 Yet neither author emphasizes the Eastern elements; for Strindberg they provide an overall structural framework, whereas for Hofmannsthal they serve to place the story in a kind of never-never land. Thus it is appropriate that the figures most directly associated with the East, the spirit-lords Indra and Kaikobad, remain absent from the stage and aloof from the main dramatic action. In Ett drömspel, only Indra’s voice is heard, and that solely in the prologue to the play, added as a clarification for the premiere; Kaikobad in Die Frau ohne Schatten communicates his will through messengers and other-worldly voices. Indra and Kaikobad both serve as abstract, remote representations of absolute justice or moral law; it is left to the other characters to demonstrate the workings of such laws in the human sphere.\n\nThrough Indra’s Daughter, Ett drömspel examines the human condition from virtually every possible perspective. The spirit-child is present in every scene of the play, but she is not merely a passive observer, nor does she, like Christ, descend to earth in order to save or transform it. Instead, it is her function to learn through experience and suffering as well as observation just how difficult life is. Variations on certain basic truths are presented over and over again in Ett drömspel. One such theme is the disparity between illusion and reality, between expectation and fulfillment. The Officer is perhaps more fortunate than the other figures in the play in that the real Victoria never appears to destroy his imaginative picture of her, while The Billboard Paster, in contrast, is disappointed that his fishnet is not the precise shade of green he had envisioned. Another related thematic strand is the near impossibility of harmonious relationships with other people, for no human act can satisfy everyone. As The Officer’s Mother says: “Hu, detta livet! När man handlar vackert, så finns det alltid någon för vilken det är fult … gör man en gott, gör man en annan ont.”10 Or as Indra’s Daughter phrases it later in the play: “Här äro mina barn! En och en äro de snälla, men bara de råka ihop, så kivas de och bli till dämoner.”11\n\nThe key problem for human beings is thus the restraint of the individual ego to make possible communication and cooperation with others. The nightmarish scenes of married life between The Lawyer and Indra’s Daughter, scenes that are strongly reminiscent of Strindberg’s treatment of marriage in his earlier naturalistic plays, are the most crucial illustrations of this difficulty and of the disillusionment that so often is an intrinsic part of human relations. Although their union begins with high ideals and hopes, all too soon the harmony is shattered by harsh words. Whatever brings one partner pleasure gives the other pain. That there is no escape from this marital hell is represented by Kristin’s incessant pasting. Clearly, Strindberg uses married life as a focal point in his presentation of human beings’ dissatisfaction with earthly life. As she undergoes both the hardships and the less frequent joys of existence, Indra’s Daughter expresses her verdict on the human condition in the phrase she repeats like a refrain throughout the play: “Det är synd om människorna.”\n\nDie Frau ohne Schatten does not present a panoramic picture of life on earth, as Ett drömspel does, yet certain scenes in the Hofmannsthal libretto show striking affinities to Strindberg’s play and illustrate a similar perception of human existence. It is significant that both Indra’s Daughter and The Empress, who are at home in a higher, spiritual realm, first experience the descent to earth in terms of physical oppressiveness and suffocation. Indra’s Daughter says:\n\nNu sjunker molnet, det blir kvavt, jag kvävs …\n\nDet är ej luft, men rök och vatten som jag andas …\n\nSå tungt, den drar mig nedåt, nedåt,\n\noch nu jag märker ren dess krängning,\n\nden tredje världen är dock ej den bästa …12\n\nThe Nurse, describing what awaits The Empress and herself in the third and lowest of the realms differentiated in Die Frau ohne Schatten (the others are that of The Emperor and Kaikobad’s sphere), exclaims:\n\nBei den Menschen!\n\nGrausts dich nicht?\n\nMenschendunst\n\nist uns Todesluft! …\n\nUns riecht ihre Reinheit\n\nnach rostigem Eisen\n\nund gestocktem Blut\n\nund nach alten Leichen!13\n\nSimilarly, the next few lines of this speech could apply to Indra’s Daughter’s experiences on earth as well as to the initial perception of the Empress:\n\nDich ihnen vermischen,\n\nhausen mit ihnen,\n\nhandeln mit ihnen,\n\nRede um Rede,\n\nAtem um Atem,\n\nerspähn ihr Belieben,\n\nihrer Bosheit dich schmiegen,\n\nihrer Dummheit dich bücken,\n\nihnen dienen!\n\nGrausts dich nicht?14\n\nThe Empress’ realization in Act II of mankind’s suffering and disharmony—“Wehe, womit ist die Welt der Söhne Adams erfüllt!”15—is also a close echo of Indra’s Daughter’s refrain, “Det är synd om människorna.”\n\nIndra’s Daughter learns both through direct experience and through observation of others that the fundamental dilemma of human existence is the conflict between egocentric demands and the desire for true harmony with others. The functions of observer and participant are to a large degree divided between two characters, The Empress and The Dyer’s Wife, in Die Frau ohne Schatten, but both characters eventually come to the same conclusion that Indra’s Daughter reaches. As in the Strindberg play, the treatment of marriage is of central importance in establishing this theme. The married life of The Dyer and his wife has many points of correspondence with that of The Lawyer and Indra’s Daughter. Here is illustrated, once again, the difficulty of communication and the gap between expectation and fulfillment. Both Indra’s Daughter and The Dyer’s Wife feel chained to a life that is somehow beneath them and that prevents them from fulfilling their true selves. The Dyer’s Wife sees her husband as an animal plodding about his daily tasks. She constantly repeats, “Verstehst du mich?,” knowing that he does not, and laments that he cannot fathom “die Tiefe und das Geheimnis.”16 Although Indra’s Daughter asks only for a touch of physical beauty to brighten her home and make life bearable, The Dyer’s Wife demands nothing less than spiritual beauty and significance. She cannot understand her husband’s simple, physical joy in providing for his family or his pride in his work, and because she is uncertain that life is worth living, she rejects the idea of bearing his children. Both The Lawyer in Ett drömspel and Barak in Die Frau ohne Schatten are in turn so preoccupied with the demands of the here-and-now that they fail to understand or sympathize with the yearnings of their wives for beauty and a higher meaning in life.\n\nThe important difference between the marriage in Strindberg’s play and that of The Dyer and Dyer’s Wife is that stagnation and sterility are doomed to continue eternally in the relationship of The Lawyer and Indra’s Daughter, but Hofmannsthal’s couple grows through catharsis to a new awareness of what each means to the other. In desperation, The Dyer’s Wife threatens to sell her shadow, thus forever alienating her from the human race and dooming her to childlessness. Barak, in fury, tries to kill her, but is prevented from doing so by his brothers. Suddenly, The Wife sees her husband in a new light, that of mighty lord. By putting herself totally in his power and by transcending her egocentric demands, she makes possible a reconciliation. Barak too is filled with remorse. As Act III opens they sit, each unaware of the other’s presence, in an underground prison, each avowing the new faith of love and tenderness they will bring to marriage if only they find each other again. When the Voice from Above tells them: “Auf, geh’ nach oben / der Weg ist frei!”17 the audience knows that they have endured their trial and passed the test.\n\nThe Empress too must be tested. Before she truly can become human, an act that is symbolically represented by the acquisition of a shadow, she must learn what it is that distinguishes true humanity from self-interest. Gradually she realizes that she cannot sacrifice another’s happiness in order to attain her goal, and three times she refuses the shadow of The Dyer’s Wife: “Ich will nicht den Schatten: / auf ihm ist Blut.”18—even when it appears that only by taking it can she save The Emperor from being turned into stone. Thus, like Indra’s Daughter, The Empress is educated through suffering, both her own and that of others, to reach an understanding of what true humanity entails. In both Ett drömspel and Die Frau ohne Schatten the implication is that happiness and beauty in life cannot be striven for directly but are achieved only through total self-abnegation.\n\nThe structural frameworks of Ett drömspel and Die Frau ohne Schatten, like their thematic content, are comparable in significant ways. As the title indicates, the unity in Strindberg’s play lies in the dream image. In his famous introduction, two paragraphs that have always, since the first edition, been printed with the play, Strindberg explains this in detail. His technique is to string together a series of pictures, images that are connected only through association and imagination. Both the stage setting and the figures in the play contribute to the creation of a new reality based on dream consciousness. Images and situations melt into one another in Ett drömspel just as they do in a dream. Often, continuity is provided by the presence of a single stage prop that alters function as the scene changes. Thus a tree becomes a clothes hanger, the organ becomes Fingal’s Cave, and the door with the four-leaf clover turns into a safe. Because dream logic permits inconsistencies, characters may enter and exit through walls, age prematurely and then grow young again, or carry on conversations with those already dead. Characters too lose their distinctive boundaries of personality and fade into one another; they frequently remain unnamed and are identified only by their functions or professions in order to stress their lack of individual contour. The three primary male characters, The Officer, The Lawyer, and The Poet, each of whom, together with Indra’s Daughter, dominates the play, may thus be interpreted as representing three aspects of the same personality. As has been mentioned before, Indra’s Daughter herself alternates between observing humanity and participating in life, moving without pause or explanation from one role to the other. The dream logic is not even always consistent with itself—the same character may be both a participant in a dream and a dreamer—but this is fully in keeping with Strindberg’s introductory paragraphs if one assumes that the unifying consciousness is that of the author, or alternately, the reader/audience.\n\nThe roots of Die Frau ohne Schatten lie in the fairy tale; Hofmannsthal was in fact so captivated by the subject matter of the libretto that he wrote a Märchen version of the story. Significantly, a number of parallels may be drawn between what is permitted within the logic of a dream and within that of the fairy tale. In both, cause and effect are often suspended or distorted. Association replaces logic. The reader or audience willingly accepts magical events and transformations. Only in a fairy tale or a dream could jewels appear out of the air or a sword leap into the hand of the person who wishes to use it. Several times during the course of the opera, as in Strindberg’s play, the setting miraculously is transformed: a bed appears for The Empress in The Dyer’s home, the earth opens to swallow up The Dyer and his Wife, walls disappear to reveal a cave, which vanishes in turn. Several of the supernatural beings can disappear or change shape at will, and The Emperor is nearly turned into stone. A more associative use of the shape-changing motif occurs when the fish The Dyer’s Wife is frying suddenly become the voices of her unborn children. This is reminiscent of the song of the winds and the waves in Ett drömspel, where in a similar manner a human lament is voiced through a non-human agency.\n\nIn Die Frau ohne Schatten, moreover, the realm of the spirits, the magical world, is specifically identified by The Dyer’s Wife with dream consciousness. When the image of The Youth is first made to appear before her by The Nurse, she realizes that her innermost thoughts have been given material form, and exclaims: “O Welt in der Welt! O Traum im Wachen!”19 The Youth appears a second time when the Nurse persuades her to imagine him:\n\n… ein Knabe fast,\n\nder meiner nicht achtete— …\n\nmit hochmütigem Blick—\n\nund des ich gedachte\n\nheimlich, zuweilen,\n\num Träumens willen!20\n\nThe magic thus brings to life the previously unacknowledged unconscious desires of The Dyer’s Wife, just as dreams may do.21\n\nAs in Ett drömspel, the characters in Die Frau ohne Schatten, with the exception of Barak, are unnamed, thus stressing their allegorical and symbolic function rather than their individuality. Just as The Officer, Lawyer, and Poet may be interpreted as facets of one personality, The Empress and Dyer’s Wife (and to a lesser degree, The Emperor and Barak) may be seen as two sides of the same coin: both women must learn through suffering what true love and true humanity entail, and in the end both are rewarded with a shadow and the capacity to bear children. Hofmannsthal explained the function of this juxtaposition in a letter to Strauss, written in 1913 while work on the opera was in progress: “Es sind elf bedeutende, fast pantomimisch prägnante Situationen—durch ihre Verbindung aber—indem in ihnen zwei Welten, zwei Menschenpaare, zwei Konflikte einander wechselweise ablösen, einander spiegeln, einander steigern und schließlich einander aufheben—ist ein Ganzes hergestellt.22\n\nIn both Ett drömspel and Die Frau ohne Schatten, the dream or magic serves not only to provide structural unity or further the plot, but also to unite the work in a symbolic whole. In his post-Inferno period, Strindberg came more and more to believe that life itself is a dream from which the only awakening may be death. In Ett drömspel, dream, reality, and poetic creation ultimately blend together. In Fingal’s Cave, Indra’s Daughter wonders whether she has dreamed all her experiences on earth. The Poet replies:\n\nDet har jag diktat en gång!\n\nDottern: Då vet du vad dikt är …\n\nDiktaren: Då vet jag vad dröm är … vad är dikt?\n\nDottern: Ej verklighet, men mer än verklighet … ej dröm, men mer än drömmar …23\n\nA later exchange illustrates the same sort of fusion between dream and reality:\n\nDiktaren: Mig tyckes att jag upplevat detta förr …\n\nDottern: Mig även.\n\nDiktaren: Kanske jag drömt det?\n\nDottern: Eller diktat det, kanske?\n\nDiktaren: Eller diktat det.\n\nDottern: Då vet du vad dikt är.\n\nDiktaren: Då vet jag vad dröm är.\n\nDottern: Mig tycks att vi stått någon annanstans och sagt dessa ord förr.\n\nDiktaren: Då kan du snart räkna ut vad verklighet är.\n\nDottern: Eller dröm.\n\nDiktaren: Eller dikt!24\n\nIt is within the context of this blurring of the distinctions between reality, dream, and poetic creation that one must examine the central theme of Ett drömspel, the apparently pessimistic theme that Indra’s Daughter repeats like a refrain throughout the play: “Det är synd om människorna.” This perception is further elaborated in The Poet’s Lament to Indra:\n\nJorden är icke ren,\n\nJorden är icke ren,\n\nlivet är icke gott,\n\nmänniskorna icke onda,\n\nicke goda heller.\n\nDe leva som de kunna,\n\nen dag om sänder.\n\nStoftets söner i stoft vandra,\n\nav stoft födda\n\ntill stoft varda de.\n\nFötter att trampa fingo de,\n\nvingar icke.\n\nDammiga bliva de,\n\när skulden deras\n\neller din?25\n\nThe apparent pessimism of Strindberg’s theme is nevertheless tempered by a note of resignation, perhaps even of hope, through the symbolism of the play. Although much emphasis is placed on the misery of mankind, represented by the burden of guilt that The Lawyer and The Porteress, with her shawl, must shoulder, and although only emptiness lies behind the mysterious door that was alleged to hide the secret of life, the dominant symbol of Ett drömspel (other than Indra’s Daughter herself) is the growing castle. It frames the play; it is present in the first scene, and Indra’s Daughter returns to it at the end. The castle represents earthly life; it exists, as The Daughter tells The Officer in the first scene, so that one should long to escape from it. However, although the castle grows up from dung, it produces a beautiful golden chrysanthemum. When the castle is burned and earthly existence comes to an end, the chrysanthemum, symbolizing the soul, bursts into flower. Thus, in Strindberg’s world view, release from the suffering of earthly life, from the confines of the individual ego, from the dream that we perhaps have created ourselves, comes only through death. Strindberg was not an orthodox Christian, but he clearly believed death to be the deliverer.\n\nHofmannsthal was preoccupied with the life-as-dream topos throughout his artistic career. In the early poems “Terzinen über Vergänglichkeit” (“Terze rime on Transitoriness”) the third and final poem concludes: “Und drei sind Eins: ein Mensch, ein Ding, ein Traum.”26 His most complete expression of this concept is in Der Turm (The Tower), a reworking of Calderón’s La vida es sueño (Life is a Dream), a work Strindberg also admired. In an essay from 1903 entitled “Die Bühne als Traumbild” (“The Stage as Dream Image”), Hofmannsthal called the stage “der Traum der Träume” (“the dream of dreams”) and continued:\n\nWer das Bühnenbild aufbaut, muß wissen, wie, er muß daran glauben, vollgesogen muß er damit sein, daß es auf der Welt nichts Starres gibt, nichts was ohne Bezug ist, nichts was für sich allein lebt. Seine Träume müssen ihn das gelehrt haben, und er muß die Welt so sehen; die Kraft des Träumens muß groß in ihm sein und er muß ein Dichter unter den Dichtern sein. Sein Auge muß schöpferisch sein, wie das Auge des Träumenden, der nichts erblickt, was ohne Bedeutung wäre.… Wer die Bühne aufbauen wird, muß durchs Auge gelebt und gelitten haben. Tausendmal muß er sich geschworen haben, daß das Sichtbare allein existiert, und trausendmal muß er schaudernd sich gefragt haben, ob denn das Sichtbare nicht, vor allen Dingen, nicht existiert.27\n\nHofmannsthal thus explicitly connects the poet’s ability to perceive the hidden significance of things with dream consciousness. Like Strindberg, he sees the interwovenness of the creative act, the dream, and reality, although he does not go so far as to fuse them completely, as Strindberg does. In fact, the symbolism of Die Frau ohne Schatten clearly differentiates reality, the purely human sphere, as being separate from and in some respects morally superior to the realm of the spirits, the world of magic and the dream. The relationship between The Empress and The Nurse illustrates this distinction. The Nurse belongs entirely to the spirit world, although she is only a servant there. In order to acquire a shadow for her mistress, she is willing to use any and all methods, showing no compassion for the suffering she causes mere human beings. In contrast, The Empress gradually rejects this amorality, and as she learns the true sympathy for others that will earn her the right to a shadow, she also distances herself more and more from The Nurse. As a sign of her full commitment to becoming human, she symbolically breaks off her ties with the world from which she came by telling The Nurse to leave her forever. It is important to remember, however, that The Nurse herself is being tested by Kaikobad and fails the test. Her lack of compassion is punished; she is doomed to wander forever in the world of men.\n\nThe Empress, like Indra’s Daughter, has discovered that life among human beings can be full of hardship and disharmony, but she is also aware that it is rich and fraught with significance:\n\nMit welchem Preis\n\nsie alles zahlen,\n\naus schwerer Schuld\n\nsich wieder erneuen,\n\ndem Phönix gleich,\n\naus ewigem Leben\n\nsich immer erhöhen—\n\nkaum ahnen sies selber—28\n\nIn Ett drömspel, it is death that leads to eternal life, and Indra’s Daughter, freed from the confines of her mortal body, returns to the realm of the spirits from which she came. In Die Frau ohne Schatten, The Empress freely chooses permanently to become a member of the human race, and renewal is symbolized by the Unborn Children, the product of the love between husband and wife that becomes “… die Brücke überm Abgrund aufgespannt / auf der die Toten wiederum ins Leben gehn.”29 At the end of the opera The Dyer and Dyer’s Wife stand on a golden bridge, a materialization of the image in the song of The Watchmen and a symbolic equivalent to the golden chrysanthemum in Ett drömspel, while The Emperor and Empress are near the waterfall that in like manner represents the self-renewing power of life. Both couples have risen to a new level of perception, of their own relationships but also of marriage and humanity in general, and they are justly rewarded.\n\nHofmannsthal was aware of Strindberg as early as 1893, when a letter from his friend Richard Beer-Hofmann mentions having attended a performance of Gläubige (Fordringsägare or Creditors).30 There are brief, sporadic references to the Swedish writer in Hofmannsthal’s correspondence over the ensuing decades. In “Aufzeichnungen zu Reden in Skandinavien” (“Notes for Speeches in Scandinavia”) (1916) Hofmannsthal devotes a short paragraph to Strindberg before moving on to a more detailed discussion of the plays of Ibsen.31 That the Austrian was specifically familiar with Strindberg’s post-Inferno plays is indicated in a 1923 essay on Eugene O’Neill in which Hofmannsthal comments: “Und was Strindbergs Stücke zusammenhält, ist … nicht die erzählbare Anekdote, sondern ihre Atmosphäre zwischen Wirklichkeit und Traum.”32 The German premiere of Ett drömspel took place in Berlin in 1916, the same year the libretto version of Hofmannsthal’s Die Frau ohne Schatten was published; Strindberg’s play was not performed in Vienna until 1922;33 however, Emil Schering’s German translation of Ett drömspel (Ein Traumspiel) appeared simultaneously with its publication in Sweden. Considering Hofmannsthal’s cosmopolitan orientation and his extensive knowledge of and wide readings in foreign literatures, together with his awareness of Strindberg’s preeminent importance on the Swedish literary scene, it would be highly surprising had he not been familiar with the text of Strindberg’s masterpiece when it first became available to the German reading public, in other words well before the idea for Die Frau ohne Schatten was conceived.\n\nThe parallels in overall framework, dramatic structure, characterization, and theme between Ett drömspel and Die Frau ohne Schatten nevertheless do not demonstrate direct influence so much as an affinity between the two authors and similarities in their approaches to writing for the stage. It is noteworthy that both Strindberg and Hofmannsthal were acutely aware of dramatic tradition. Both wrote morality plays following the medieval model—Strindberg’s Till Damaskus (To Damascus) trilogy, Hofmannsthal’s Jedermann (Everyman) and Das Salzburger große Welttheater (The Salzburg World Theater)—and Strindberg, like Hofmannsthal in Die Frau ohne Schatten, turned to the fairy tale for his inspiration in plays such as Lycko-Pers resa (Lucky Per’s Journey) and Svanevit. Modern psychologists have often shown that both the dream and the fairy tale may reveal the inner significance of human experience by appealing to the unconscious rather than the conscious mind. Strindberg and Hofmannsthal seem to have reached the same conclusion intuitively, realizing that the truth about major philosophical and existential questions may best be approached through symbolism and allegory rather than strict realism, through synthesis rather than analysis. Both Ett drömspel and Die Frau ohne Schatten demonstrate that such metaphysical speculations may exert a timeless and universal appeal on the stage.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Fischer, 1957), p. 159 (hereafter Dramen III). “Among human beings! / Don’t you shudder? / The smell of human beings / is the breath of death to us! … / To us their purity smells / of rusty iron, / and stagnant blood, / and of old corpses!”\n\n14. Dramen III, 159–60. “To mix with them / lodge with them, / deal with them / word for word, / breath for breath, / discover their pleasures, / conform to their evil, / bow to their stupidity, / serve them! / Don’t you shudder?”\n\n15. Dramen III, 204. “Woe, what kind of world do the sons of Adam inhabit!”\n\n16. Dramen III, 199. “Do you understand me?” “… the depth and the secret.”\n\n17. Dramen III, 214. “Arise, ascend, / the way is free!”\n\n18. Dramen III, 209–10. “I do not want the shadow: / there is blood on it.”\n\n19. Dramen III. 173. “O world within the world! O waking dream!”\n\n20. Dramen III, 183ff. “… a boy almost, / who paid me no regard— … / with arrogant glance— / of whom I thought / secretly, occasionally, / for the sake of dreaming!”\n\n21. Since dream or fairy-tale logic permits magical transformations to take place on stage, producing either Ett drömspel or Die Frau ohne Schatten calls for considerable imagination and ingenuity on the part of the director and set designer.\n\n22. Letter from Hugo von Hofmannsthal to Richard Strauss, 20 January 1913, in Richard Strauss-Hugo von Hofmannsthal: Briefwechsel, ed. Willi Schuh (Zurich: Atlantis, 1952), p. 203. “There are eleven significant, almost pantomimically incisive situations—but it is their combination—in which two worlds, two pairs of beings, two interwoven conflicts, mutually alternate with each other, reflect each other, enhance each other, and eventually find their equilibrium—which gives unity to the whole work.”\n\n23. SS, p. 301. “Daughter: I’ve dreamed that … / Poet: I put it into poetry once … / Daughter: Then you know what poetry is … / Poet: Then I know what dreaming is … What is poetry? / Daughter: Not reality, but more than reality … not dreaming, but waking dreams.”\n\n24. SS, p. 311. “Poet: I seem to have lived through this before … / Daughter: I, too. / Poet: Perhaps I dreamt it? / Daughter: Or composed it, perhaps? / Poet: Or composed it. / Daughter: Then you know what poetry is. / Poet: Then I know what dreaming is. / Daughter: It seems to me we’ve stood elsewhere saying these words before. / Poet: Then you can soon determine what reality is! / Daughter: Or dreaming! / Poet: Or poetry!”\n\n25. SS, pp. 298–99. “The earth is not clean, / life is not good, / human beings not evil, / nor are they good. / They live as they can, / one day at a time, / The sons of dust wander in dust, / born of dust / they return to dust. / They have feet to walk, / but not wings. / They become dusty. / Is the blame theirs / or yours?”\n\n26. Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gedichte und Lyrische Dramen in Gesammelte Werke (Stockholm: Bermann-Fischer, 1946), p. 19. “And three are one: a person, a thing, a dream.”\n\n27. Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Prosa II in Gesammelte Werke (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1951), pp. 63, 66. “Whoever creates the setting for the stage must know how, he must believe in, must be completely absorbed by, the fact that there is nothing inflexible in the world, nothing that is without reference, nothing that lives for itself alone. His dreams must have taught him that and he must see the world in this way; the power of dreaming must be great in him and he must be a poet among poets. His eye must be creative, like the eye of a dreamer, which perceives nothing without meaning.… Whoever is to create for the stage must have lived and suffered through the eye. A thousand times must he have sworn that the visible alone exists, and a thousand times must he have asked himself, shuddering, whether the visible does not, above all, not exist.”\n\n28. Dramen III, 222. “At what price / they pay everything, / and again renew themselves, / out of deep guilt, / like the Phoenix, / from eternal life / they always rise— / hardly knowing it themselves—”\n\n29. Dramen III, 180. “… the bridge spanned over the abyss / on which the dead once again return to life.”\n\n30. Letter from Richard Beer-Hofmann to Hugo von Hofmannsthal, 5 July 1893, in Hugo von Hofmannsthal-Richard Beer-Hofmann: Briefwechsel, ed. Eugene Weber (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1972), p. 21.\n\n31. Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Prosa III in Gesammelte Werke (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1952), p. 350. In 1916 Hofmannsthal traveled to Scandinavia on a quasi-official lecture tour to promote cultural contact and general goodwill. While in Stockholm he attended a performance of his own Elektra, with Harriet Bosse, Strindberg’s third wife, in the title role, and was much impressed with her skill as an actress. Although this occurred after the completion of the libretto version of Die Frau ohne Schatten, it is an interesting coincidence that Bosse was the model and inspiration for Indra’s Daughter in Ett drömspel. Cf. Algot Werin, “Hofmannsthal und Schweden,” in Nerthus III, Nordisch-deutsche Beiträge, ed. Steffen Steffensen (Düsseldorf: Eugen Diederichs Verlag, 1972), p. 177.\n\n32. Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Prosa IV in Gesammelte Werke (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1955), p. 200. “And what holds Strindberg’s plays together is … not the narrative tale, but rather their atmosphere between reality and dream.”\n\n33. Ollén, Strindbergs dramatik, pp. 416–18."
