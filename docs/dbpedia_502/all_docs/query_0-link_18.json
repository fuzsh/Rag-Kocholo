A taxonomic revision of a more broadly circumscribed Conostegia is presented here. In total, 77 species of Conostegia are recognized. One species from Ecuador, Conostegia ortizae is described as new. Twenty-nine new combinations are proposed for the species of Clidemia and Miconia that fall inside Conostegia. Two new names are proposed for the two species for which the epithet was previously occupied in Conostegia. An infrageneric classification of Conostegia is proposed recognizing three sections based on the results of the molecular phylogeny. This taxonomic revision includes ample documentation of the anatomy and morphology of most species in the genus, taxonomic descriptions, a dichotomous key, and distribution maps for all species.\n\nKeywords: Conostegia, Melastomataceae, monograph, Neotropics\n\nIntroduction\n\nConostegia D. Don, a genus in the tribe Miconieae (Melastomataceae), is most famous for the calyptrate calyx of the flowers of its species. The group was revised by Schnell (1996) who recognized 42 species, but this thorough revision unfortunately was never published. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences from four chloroplast and two nuclear ribosomal spacers found Conostegia not to be monophyletic but identified a core Conostegia clade (Kriebel et al. 2015). This Conostegia clade identified contains all species sampled of Conostegia, in addition to some species of Clidemia D. Don and Miconia Ruiz & Pav. most of which are narrowly endemic taxa from Costa Rica and Panama. Ancestral state reconstruction of the calyptra onto the resulting molecular phylogeny of Conostegia provided evidence for the multiple origins of this structure albeit with different anatomical characteristics in each origin (Kriebel et al. 2015). The main objective of this revision is to provide a detailed taxonomic account guided by these recent findings. For this purpose, a broadened circumscription of Conostegia is here proposed. This revision also includes the proposal of an infrageneric classification, extensive documentation of the anatomy and morphology in the genus, a key for the identification of its species, descriptions, phenological graphs, diagnostic illustrations for most species and distributional maps.\n\nSome authors have suggested that the best solution to the problem of lack of monophyly of many genera of the tribe Miconieae (Michelangeli et al. 2004; Goldenberg et al. 2008; Martin et al. 2008) is to lump all of them into a giant expanded genus Miconia, which could then be recognized by the presence of berry fruits (Ionta et al. 2012; Ionta and Judd 2012; Judd and Ionta 2013; Judd and Majure 2013; Majure and Judd 2013a, 2013b). These publications recommended and have started to divide the expanded Miconia into sections. Thus, the tribe Miconieae, in their view contains a single genus with about 1800 species divided into an uncertain number of sections. Given that most sections recognized to date are as small as three taxa, it is reasonable to believe the number of sections that will have to be recognized is quite large. This problem also applies with the large number of genera that would have to be created to accommodate all species within Miconieae. The case of Conostegia is different in that sampling for phylogenetic and morphological studies include most of its species, something far from happening for a group as large as the Miconieae. Using sections is problematic because taxonomic databases and herbaria usually do not include infrageneric classifications in their organization. These authors argue that lumping all taxa into Miconia will result in taxonomic stability because most species were already included in Miconia, and that fewer taxonomic changes will have to be made than if separate genera are recognized. An aspect that is less mentioned is how many new names would have to be created to accommodate species in all genera being lumped into a broadly circumscribed Miconia. In other words, what is more unstable, to create new combinations or to create altogether new names? For example, including all species of Conostegia in Miconia would require 30 new names, whereas including its species in an expanded Conostegia requires only two new names. I roughly calculated the number of new names required to accomodate all species of the Miconieae in the genus Miconia and came up with the number 354 new names. This means that the epithet of those taxa will change all together. It is not clear how to measure taxonomic stability, but I argue that that amount of new names is unnecessary and will result in high nomenclatural instability. The last phylogeny of the Miconieae included two genes for 449 species (Goldenberg et al. 2008), which represents around 25% of the tribe. Greater sampling both of molecular data as well as species would be desirable when so many nomenclatural changes are being considered. If more data results in better supported clades, these could be considered as the genera to recognize. This point was emphasized by Goldenberg and collegues (2008) who cautioned on making major taxonomic realignments since they would be “premature” based on their results. Some authors on the other hand are choosing the alternate route and recognizing genera within the Miconieae such as Killipia and Leandra s.s. (Posada-Herrera and Mendoza-Cifuentes 2013; Reginato 2014).\n\nThe recognition in this study of a broad Conostegia is based on the best sampled and only phylogenetic study of Conostegia which places all species in a clade within the Miconieae, and since most currently recognized species fall in this clade, and most can easily be recognized by the presence of the calyptra, it is deemed more useful to broaden Conostegia than to lump its species in a giant Miconia. Lastly, the species of Clidemia and Miconia that fall within Conostegia are almost all endemic to Costa Rica and Panama evidencing the strong and useful geographic component that together with morphology can be used in identifying species of this group.\n\nTaxonomic history\n\nThe idea of separating a group of calyptrate species in the Melastomataceae was first suggested by Bonpland (1806-1816), who intended to group them into the new genus Calyptres, but never validly published the name. Subsequently, and apparently following Bonpland’s idea, David Don (1823) formally described the genus Conostegia emphasizing the presence of the calyptrate calyx. The name derives from conus (meaning ‘cone’) and tectum (meaning ‘roof’). Don (1823) included nine species in his concept of Conostegia all of which were known as Melastoma at the time, namely Melastoma calyptrata Desr., Melastoma extinctorum Bonpl., Melastoma glabratum Sw., Melastoma montanum Sw., Melastoma procera Sw., Melastoma xalapense Bonpl. and the following three species which were undescribed at the time and each followed in Don’s publication: Melastoma superbum Bonpl., Melastoma cucullata Pav. ex D. Don, and Melastoma holosericea Steud. Ex Triana (Schnell 1996). Don (1823) did not choose a type because this was not customary at the time, but he provided a description, diagnosis and discussion of the affinities of Conostegia to Miconia. Schnell (1996) informally designated Melastoma procera as the type of Conostegia.\n\nThe combinations of Don’s species to Conostegia were done by Candolle (1828) but the latter author credited the names in Conostegia to Don. Candolle (1828) provided descriptions for sixteen species of Conostegia and was one of only two monographers to provide an infrageneric classification in Conostegia. He organized the genus into two sections. The first section Eriostegia DC. contained only one species that had been described as Melastoma mutisii Bonpl. and was proposed as Conostegia mutisii (Bonpl.) DC. The globose, hispid and abrupt apex of the calyptra characterized this section. Melastoma mutisii was eventually included in the capsular fruited genus Centronia (Triana, 1872) and very recently included in Meriania (Mendoza-Cifuentes & Fernández-Alonso, 2012). The second section he called Euconostegia and characterized it based on the shape of the calyptra, which was abruptly acuminate and also hispid. The next worker to treat Conostegia was Naudin (1850) who provided detailed descriptions for 11 species and cited an additional seven names. Most of these taxa are currently recognized in Conostegia. Naudin (1850) did not provide an infrageneric classification for Conostegia. After Naudin, Triana (1872) treated 23 species of Conostegia in his monograph of the family which included detailed descriptions for seven of them. Most of those taxa are also recognized today. Lastly, before a break in the revision of the genus that would last about 100 years, Cogniaux (1891) treated 34 species of Conostegia. Later Schnell (1996) provided the only detailed classification within Conostegia in which he recognized 42 species and divided them in three subgenera (Conostegia, Lobatostigma and Ossaeiformis) and further divided subgenus Conostegia into six sections (Axiliflora, Conostegia, Dasystegia, Notostegia, Parvistigma and Tomentostegia). Unfortunately Schnell’s work was never published. The genus had always been thought of as a morphologically distinct group (Bonpland 1806-1816; Don 1823; Almeda 1990; Schnell 1996) and in one of the few thorough revisions of the taxonomy of genera with terminal inflorescences, Judd and Skean (1991) concluded that Conostegia was likely monophyletic. After the work of Schnell (1996), the most comprehensive study that included species of Conostegia has been that for the Flora Mesoamericana by Almeda (2009). The latter study followed very closely the work of Schnell (1996).\n\nPhylogeny and infrageneric classification\n\nThe most recent hypothesis of relationships in Conostegia based on DNA sequences from four chloroplast and two nuclear ribosomal regions, resolved the genus as paraphyletic with species of Clidemia and Miconia nested inside (Kriebel et al. 2015). Nonetheless, all species of Conostegia fall in a major clade regardless of the type of analysis conducted (concatentation vs. concordance). A summary of the relationships within Conostegia based on the hypothesis derived from the concatenated analysis is presented in Figure . These results also show the paraphyly of Schnell’s (1996) subgenus Conostegia since the species of his subgenus Lobatostigma form a clade nested inside of it. With respect to Schnell’s sectional classification of subgenus Conostegia his groups are not monophyletic except sections Parvistigma and Tomentostegia. For this reason, the subgeneric classification adopted here includes only sections corresponding to the three major clades in Conostegia identified by both concatentation and concordance analyses and proposed as Conostegia sections Australis, Conostegia, and Geniculatae, respectively (Fig. ). Section Australis has calyptrate calyces that break at one side, abundant sclereids in the hypanthium, mucilage in the ovary, exserted styles, lack of filament geniculation, and all but one species sampled lack a vascular cylinder in the style. Even then, the cylinder in Conostegia ortizae has a single vascular bundle (unlike species in section Conostegia which have more). Species in section Conostegia are almost unique within the genus in that their styles are not exserted (flowers not herkogamous). This short style is only shared with some populations of Conostegia monteleagreana in section Australis and the clade composed of Conostegia osaensis, Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata and Conostegia xalapensis within section Geniculatae. An additional character almost unique to section Conostegia and not shared with any of the latter short-styled taxa is the presence of a vascular cylinder within the style. Additional characteristics of section Conostegia include the abundant sclereids in the hypanthium and presence of ovary mucilage (shared with section Australis). Based on anatomy and morphology, section Australis and section Conostegia are quite similar. These two sections also share the frequent pleiostemonous condition and the lack of an evident filament geniculation. The two groups differ in that species of section Conostegia do not have exserted styles, and all have vascular cylinders in the style whereas species of section Australis have exserted style and all but one species lack the vascular cylinder in the style. Lastly, many species in section Australis have an “anther shoulder” that species of section Conostegia lack. Section Geniculatae can be recognized by the lack of calyptra in most of its species. Only the following taxa have a calyptra: Conostegia cinnamomea, Conostegia osaensis, Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, and Conostegia xalapensis. The calyptra of these species differs from those of the other two sections in that they lack sclereids. Additional characteristics of section Geniculatae include the filament geniculation, the exserted style (in most of its species), small flower size, diplostemonous flowers of most of its species, and the frequently papillose seed testa. Lastly, it is noteworthy that many of the species in this section have leaves that are strongly plinerved and frequently asymmetric. Also, see the Biogeography section for remarks on the marked geographical patterns at the sectional level.\n\nChromosome numbers\n\nChromosome counts have been reported for the following 13 species of Conostegia: Conostegia arborea, Conostegia colliculosa, Conostegia consimilis, Conostegia galdamesiae, Clidemia hammelii, Conostegia icosandra, Conostegia montana, Conostegia oerstediana, Conostegia setosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, Conostegia superba, Conostegia schlimii, and Conostegia xalapensis (Solt and Wurdack 1980, Almeda and Chuang 1992, Schnell 1996, Almeda 2013). In all reported counts the haploid number was n=17, which is believed to be the base number of the tribe Miconieae (Almeda 2013).\n\nBiogeography\n\nOf the three main clades (sections) of Conostegia, the smallest one, Australis, is noticeable for its species being primarily South American, i.e., Conostegia apiculata, Conostegia centronioides, Conostegia dentata, Conostegia extinctoria, Conostegia lancifolia, Conostegia ortizae and Conostegia rubiginosa. This is almost the only clade to contain species endemic to South America except for Conostegia ecuadorensis and Conostegia foreroi of section Geniculatae. Other species of section Australis (e.g. Conostegia lasiopoda and Conostegia tenuifolia) reach southern Central America and are common in that region, but none of the species in section Australis ranges beyond Nicaragua and none are present in the Caribbean. The only species of section Australis to reach an oceanic island is Conostegia lasiopoda, which occurs on Cocos Island in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSection Conostegia is mostly restricted to Central America and the Caribbean. Roughly speaking there are three distinct areas where endemic species of this section occur. The area with the most endemics is southern Central America (Costa Rica and Panama). The mountains in these two countries include the volcanic ranges in Costa Rica and the Talamanca mountains that start in Costa Rica and end in Panama, harboring endemics such as Conostegia bigibbosa, Conostegia chiriquensis, Conostegia fragrantissima, Conostegia macrantha, Conostegia micrantha, Conostegia muriculata, Conostegia oerstediana, Conostegia pittieri, Conostegia rhodopetala, and Conostegia vulcanicola. Some of these species reach their northernmost distribution on volcanoes of Nicaragua and some also reach the lowlands of these three countries. The second area of endemism for species of section Conostegia is in northern Central America, both in the mountains of southern Mexico as well as in some lower-elevation and drier valleys. Some of these northernmost endemics include Conostegia arborea, Conostegia caelestis, and Conostegia jaliscana. Lastly the third area of endemism, which could potentially be divided into two, are the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Cuba (where the endemic Conostegia lindenii grows), and the island of Jamaica where three endemics occur (Conostegia balbisiana, Conostegia procera, and Conostegia pyxidata).\n\nSection Geniculatae stands out biogeographically because most of its species (80%) are endemic to the southern Central American countries of Costa Rica and Panama. The rest of the species occur in northern Central America with endemics of that area including Conostegia fulvostellata, Conostegia oligocephala, and Conostegia plumosa. Other species of section Geniculatae (e.g. Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, and Conostegia xalapensis) are more-or-less widespread in Central America reaching South America. Just like in section Australis, only one species of section Geniculatae (i.e., Conostegia ombrophila) reaches an oceanic island, i.e. Cocos Island in the Pacific.\n\nOngoing work in the tribe Miconieae to obtain a dated phylogeny will provide a time calibrated hypothesis that will enable a thorough biogeographical analysis of Conostegia.\n\nNatural history\n\nHerbivory\n\nMany insects especially in the orders Coleoptera, Homoptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera have been documented interacting with species of Conostegia. Herbivory mostly of the leaves of species of Conostegia by larvae of Lepidoptera has been well documented in Costa Rica. The data base of lepidopteran herbivores of Janzen and Hallwachs (2013) from northern Costa Rica includes around 4420 records of 134 Lepidoptera species in 84 genera of 27 families reared from species of Conostegia. Conostegia xalapensis stands out for the large number of species feeding on it. Other lepidopteran species can induce galls such as as species in the family Momphidae (Fig. ). Hymenopterans have been documented parasitizing larvae in some of these galls, and some have been named after Conostegia. Chrysonotomyia conostegiae Hansson parasitizes Momphidae larvae in galls of Conostegia xalapensis as well as larvae of gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) (Hansson 2004). Another hymenopteran herbivore also named after Conostegia is Allorhogas conostegiae Marsh and Shaw (Chavarría et al. 2009). This is one of the few phytophagous braconid wasps that has ever been reported (Chavarría et al. 2009). It was reared from the fruits of Conostegia xalapensis. During this study, beetles of the family Curculionidae were frequently encountered in flowers of Conostegia species. As a result of pickling flowers in the field, several of these beetles remained at the bottom of the pickle jars of different species (Fig. ). The beetles appear to be of the genus Phylothrox sp. (Curculioninae: Acalyptini) (Franz 2006). Other curculionid beetles that have been reared from Conostegia include one species of the genus Anthonomus from Conostegia oerstediana (Chacón-Madrigal et al. 2012). In another family of the beetles, the Chrysomelidae, two species of the genus Margaridisia have been found, one in Conostegia schlimii and one in Conostegia xalapensis (Flowers and Janzen 1997). From these studies it is clear that much is to be learned about Conostegia species and their herbivores.\n\nFloral biology\n\nFloral longevity in the Melastomataceae has not been thoroughly studied. Stratton (1989) documented floral longevity in Monteverde, Costa Rica, and included nine species of Melastomataceae. He found the mean floral longevity for the family to be 1.24 days. This study included three species of Conostegia. This short floral life span is expected in flowers of the family because most are buzz pollinated (Renner 1989). Plants that are buzz pollinated tend to be homogamous (offer pollen reward at the same time they receive it) because the lack of rewards such as nectar inhibit them from being dichogamous. Dichogamous plants such as protandrous ones that reward nectar can change the position of the sexual organs through time and offer a reward in both male and female phases. Because melastomes are generally not dichogamous, their flowers need not live as long as those that change sexual expression.\n\nFloral scent has been noted on several specimen labels of several species of Conostegia. To obtain some descriptive statistics on scent production within Conostegia, I compiled information from both the Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad, Costa Rica (INB) and The New York Botanical Garden herbarium for all Melastomataceae. In total, about 52,000 specimens were databased which had label information. Of this total, 389 specimens had some report of fragrance after searching with key words “olor”, “odor”, “scent”, “aroma”, “fragr”, and “cheiro”. Some 60 of the specimens with some report of scent are in the Conostegia.\n\nSchnell (1996) noted that some species such as Conostegia montana and Conostegia oerstediana can have fragrant or odorless populations. Indeed more thorough observations are needed to assess the systematic significance and distribution of floral scent in Conostegia. Also, for taxa with scented flowers, it remains to be determined where the scent is being emitted. I have perceived strong pleasant scent emission in flowers of Conostegia cuatrecasii, Conostegia macrantha and Conostegia oerstediana.\n\nReproductive biology\n\nWithin Conostegia, at least two species are known to be self-compatible, Conostegia montana (Tanner, 1982) and Conostegia oerstediana (Schnell, 1996) (Table ). Another species (Conostegia macrantha) is reported to be self-incompatible (Renner 1989). The main way in which species within Conostegia are thought to avoid self pollination is through herkogamy (Renner 1989). Herkogamy is the spatial separation of sexual parts within flowers and is usually manifested within Conostegia by its species having exserted styles. This type of herkogamy falls within the “homomorphic” type of flower in the classification of Webb and Lloyd (1986). Within the homomorphic type they belong to the “ordered” type in which there is usually a single contact between the pollinator with the stigma and stamens. Lastly, within the “ordered” type, flowers with exserted styles fall in the “approach” category in which the stigma is placed forward in the pollinator’s path. Two species, Conostegia fragrantissima and Conostegia pittieri are unusual in that they appear always to have their style bent opposite the stamens. A third species Conostegia schlimii also can have its style bent away from the stamens. Although this position of the style is uncommon in Conostegia, it is present in several other groups of Melastomataceae (e.g. Kriebel 2015). The evolution of the giant stigma appears to correspond to a different kind of flower altogether. Taxa with giant stigma tend to have large flowers with spreading petals and with the large stigma probably functioning as a large bullseye for the bee to touch when approaching the flower. This kind of flower fits those termed “dish-blossoms” in the classification of Webb and Lloyd (1986), characterized by having many stamens and a large central stigmatic region. They were considered as having “homomorphic, ordered type” flowers like the others but which may be of the “unordered” type in which the pollinator may contact the stigma and anthers several times and in no particular order. It should be noted that there is a second hypothesis (besides avoiding self pollination and promoting outcrossing) for the evolution of herkogamy (Webb and Lloyd 1986). This second hypothesis proposes that herkogamy evolved as a way to avoid interference between the function of the stamens and that of the style (Webb and Lloyd 1986; Fetscher 2001; Barrett 2002).\n\nTable 1.\n\nSpeciesFamilyGenusSpeciesCompatibility systemSource Conostegia bracteata Halictidae Augochlora Augochlora sp.?R.

Roubik pers. comm.\n\nAll species within section Conostegia and a few within section Geniculatae have consistently short styles. Flowers that lack a distance between the anthers and the stigma may be called non-herkogamous flowers. Recently the term plesiogamous was proposed for this flower type (Nesom 2012). This term derives from the Greek, plesios, meaning near, alluding to the proximity of the stamens and stigma (Nesom 2012). The evolution of plesiogamy has occurred at least twice within Conostegia (Kriebel et al. 2015) and is known to have evolved in other clades of Melastomataceae (e.g., Miconia section Hartigia).\n\nLittle has been published on the pollination of Conostegia. Renner (1989) did not report any bee observations for Conostegia in her review of melastome reproductive biology. However, because of their poricidal yellow anthers they are all thought to be buzz pollinated, and some observations of buzz pollination are available (Schnell 1996). Throughout the present study, photographs of potential pollinators were gathered in the following Costa Rican localities (province in parenthesis): Escazú (San José), San Miguel Arriba de Grecia (Alajuela), La Selva Biological Station (Heredia), and the Osa Peninsula (Puntarenas). In the larger flowered taxa which tend to occur at higher elevations, bees of the genus Bombus as well as an unidentified genus were observed buzzing the flowers of Conostegia pittieri and Conostegia oerstediana. At lower elevations, bees of the genus Melipona were observed buzzing the flowers of Conostegia cinnamomea, Conostegia schlimii, and Conostegia subcrustulata. Also at lower elevations, a species of Auglochlora (family Halictidae) was observed buzzing the flowers of Conostegia bracteata, Conostegia consimilis, Conostegia grayumii, and Conostegia setosa. Photographs taken in Ecuador by Darin Penneys of a flowering tree of Conostegia ortizae also show a halictid bee buzzing the flowers. In the lowlands of Costa Rica, species in the orchid bee genus Euglossa have been observed buzzing the flowers of Conostegia bracteata and Conostegia subcrustulata (Fig. , Table ). During this study it was observed that in small flowered species with exserted styles such as Conostegia cinnamomea and Conostegia grayumii, the bees cover the stigma with their abdomen before buzzing the flower (Fig. ). These taxa tend to have their flowers facing downward which appears to force the bees into this position. On the other hand short styled species such as Conostegia bracteata and Conostegia subcrustulata have their flowers positioned horizontally and the bees grasp the stamen but do not cover the stigma. In large flowered species such as Conostegia oerstediana, the flower tends to be either upright or horizontally positioned and the stigma tends to bend downwards potentially being landed on or touched by the abdomen of large bees. Pollen thieves of the genus Trigona were also encountered both eating the anthers as well as sticking their tongues into the anther pores of Conostegia oerstediana (Fig. ). Pollen robbing by Trigona bees has been well documented in the Melastomataceae (Renner 1983). In summary, the poricidal anther dehiscence, and the observation of only bees visiting flowers of species in all three of the major clades of Conostegia suggests that most if not all of the species are buzz pollinated by bees.\n\nDispersers\n\nSeeds of species of Conostegia are mostly dispersed by birds (Schnell 1996). Seed dispersal in Conostegia volcanalis by the rodents Peromyscus aztecus and Reithrodontomys fulvescens has also been reported (Vázquez et al. 2004). Two cases of fruit dispersal by bats have also been documented, one by Hylonycteris underwoodi dispersing Conostegia xalapensis (Castro-Luna and Sosa, 2009) and one by an unidentified species of bat dispersing Conostegia oerstediana (Harvey, 2000). Bats are thought not to be important dispersal agents of melastomes (Schnell 1996).\n\nOf the known bird-dispersed species, Harvey (2000) documented sixteen species of birds feeding on Conostegia oerstediana and one species feeding on Conostegia xalapensis in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Loiselle and Blake (1990) found seeds of Conostegia subcrustulata to be the most common in fecal samples of birds in second-growth forest at La Selva, Costa Rica. Loiselle and Blake (1990) also found that red-capped manakins, white collared manakins and scarlet rumped tanagers to have a special preference for the fruits of Conostegia subcrustulata. To attract birds dispersers, species of Conostegia have purple berries that contrast with the foliage (Schnell 1996). Some species such as Conostegia monteleagreana and Conostegia rhodopetala have red to pink inflorescence branches that may provide further contrast with the color of the berries. The display of the berries in taxa with terminal inflorescences contrasts with that of taxa with axillary inflorescences. These two different types of fruit display result in different guilds of bird dispersers (Schnell 1996).\n\nSchnell (1996) noted that the presence of berries on individuals of Conostegia is infrequent both in herbarium specimens and in the field. He suggested that the reason for this pattern might have to do with optimizing limited resources through selective fruit abortion, as has been documented in many families of flowering plants (Stephenson 1981). Then, the few berries that are actually produced are quickly dispersed.\n\nSchnell (1996) recognized two fruiting patterns in Conostegia. In the first one, plants produce berries directly after flowering. This behavior results in the presence of flowers and fruits on the same inflorescence/infructescence. Species with this fruiting type include Conostegia lasiopoda, Conostegia macrantha, Conostegia montana, Conostegia rhodopetala, Conostegia setosa, and Conostegia subcrustulata. The second type of fruiting behavior is that in which fruiting occurs several months after flowering. Examples of species with this second type of fruiting behavior are Conostegia pittieri and Conostegia rufescens.\n\nLastly, Schnell (1996) hypothesized that there are three possible advantages gained from bird dispersal: (1) displacement of seeds over a range of distances; (2) improved habitat selection; and (3) enhanced seed germination after passage of seeds through the gut. With respect to the first hypothesis, he found evidence that dispersal distances are modest. This is because retention of seeds by birds of species with small berries and small seeds tends to be short (Levey 1987). As for the second hypothesis of reaching suitable sites, Schnell (1996) could not find support, but noted that little is known about the behavior of birds after fruit ingestion. Lastly, Schnell (1996) found some evidence to suggest that germination is not enhanced by passage of seeds through the birds gut as demonstrated by Ellison et al. (1993).\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nIn total about 2000 sheets were studied for this revision from the following herbaria: CAS, CR, INB, NY, PMA, and USCG. In addition, digital images were studied from the following herbaria: BM, COL, F, GH, MO, P, and US. About 665 specimens were collected during the study of the group on several trips to Costa Rica, and one trip each to both Guatemala and Panama. In order to produce maps, many specimens were georeferenced and additional ones identified by experts (mainly Charles Schnell and Frank Almeda) added to improve the distribution maps. The maps and phenology diagrams were made using the R package monographaR (Reginato 2016).\n\nLeaf and floral anatomy\n\nLeaves and floral buds were fixed in 70% ethanol in the field and at maximum two weeks later were brought into the lab and fixed in formalin-acetic acid-ethanol (FAA; 3.7% formaldehyde; 5% glacial acetic acid; 50% ethanol), vacuum-infiltrated overnight, and then stored in 70% ethanol. For light microscopy, fixed material was dehydrated through an alcohol-toluene series in a Leica TP-1020 automatic tissue processor, and embedded in Paraplast X-tra (Fisher Healthcare, Houston, Texas, USA). The samples were sectioned at 10 µm with an AO Spencer 820 rotary microtome (GMI Inc. Minnesota, USA). Sections were stained with Johansen’s safranin (Johansen 1940) (2% w/v in 50% ethanol) and 0.5% Astra Blue in 2% tartaric acid w/v in distilled water (Maácz and Vágás 1961; Kraus et al. 1998) and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). Sections were viewed and digitally photographed with a Zeiss Axioplan compound microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200C digital camera with ACT-1 software.\n\nScanning electron microscopy\n\nTo thoroughly document trichomes, floral parts, and seeds, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used. For the study of floral parts, flowers collected in the field were brought to the lab and transferred to acetone via an ethanol-acetone series, and then dried by critical point, mounted on aluminum stubs with adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA), sputter coated with gold palladium in a Hummer 6.2 sputter coater (Anatech, Springfield, VA, USA), and examined and photographed in a Jeol JSM-5410 LV Scanning Electron Microscope operated at 10 kV. Seeds were cleaned in water prior to sputter coating and SEM.\n\nSpecies plates\n\nBoth photographs of living plants and dissections of material in spirit are used to illustrate the species treated in this revision. For preserved material, floral structures were photographed under a Nikon SMZ1500 stereoscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200F camera connected to a computer and using the software ACT-1. The plates were prepared with GIMP (The GNU Image Manipulation Program).\n\nResults\n\nMost species of Conostegia are in Central America (Fig. ) with the highest density being in southern Central America (Fig. ). I was fortunate to receive material and images of live plants from South American countries as well as the Caribbean Islands, which encompasses the whole range of Conostegia except for a disjunct population of Conostegia icosandra in Bahia, Brazil. They mostly occur in lowland rainforest and cloud forest habitats. The preferred elevational ranges are shown are shown in Figure .\n\nFlowering phenology\n\nThe flowering phenology of species of Conostegia was tallied using herbarium label data. In total, the flowering time for 1420 specimens was recorded. To best visualize in a comparative manner the phenology of each species, circular histograms were produced (Figs – ). This assessment of phenology should be taken with caution since it is based on herbarium specimens which can often be the result of easy accessibility to collecting sites and other collecting biases such as sampling error and good weather conditions. Furthermore, realistic patterns of phenology are obscured for broadly distributed species as well as local patterns, which are best studied at the population level. Schnell (1996) reported a pattern present in species such as Conostegia bracteata, Conostegia montana, Conostegia setifera, and perhaps Conostegia balbisiana in which flowering begins around March and finishes in September. Schnell (1996) called this an example of the normal “out-of-season low-frequency flowering” which might be favored in individuals in high light environments. Schnell (1996) also noted the year-long flowering of weedy species and hypothesized that these longer flowering times might be selected for longer fruiting seasons which might permit more colonization. A second possible non-exclusive explanation proposed by Schnell (1996) is that because of their weedy habit they tend to receive more light allowing them more energy for reproduction. Lastly, Schnell (1996) suggested the possibility that there are collection biases and that these habitats are more frequently visited by collectors. In addition, some species show very marked seasonality. For example, Conostegia caelestis and Conostegia osaensis only flower between March and June. Conostegia oligocephala has a similarly narrow pattern being recorded in flower from May to July. Conostegia brenesii in the cloud forests of Costa Rica only flowers during the rainy season from July through September. Conostegia grayumii, Conostegia incurva, Conostegia pendula, Conostegia povedae, and Conostegia subpeltata appear to follow a similar pattern of rainy-season flowering from July through October. Another possible pattern includes Conostegia allenii and Conostegia calocoma both of which only flower from January through July.\n\nHabit\n\nSpecies of Conostegia are all terrestrial shrubs or trees. Some of the tallest trees in the tribe Miconieae are found in Conostegia, with Conostegia osaensis reaching about 25 meters in height. Schnell (1996) noted a bimodal distribution of height classes and growth forms in which species were either large trees able to compete with canopy trees such as (e.g., Conostegia volcanalis and Conostegia rufescens), or fast-growing shrubs that seldom grow higher than 2–3 m. He further suggested that the shrubby growth habit had evolved more than once. In addition, I have observed Conostegia rufescens growing both as a large tree and as a shrub. The latter was observed in Cerro Jefe, Panamá, and in the lower parts of Braulio Carrillo National Park in Costa Rica. In Braulio Carrillo, which harbors forests over a wide elevational range, I also observed Conostegia rufescens as a taller tree in the cloud forest. The pattern of tall trees is especially evident in the giant stigma group with a clear independent origin in Conostegia osaensis and probably also in Conostegia schlimii, which can also become a tall tree. The trunk of some species such as Conostegia bernoulliana and Conostegia oerstediana, can have flaky bark but in most taxa it is smooth. The smallest species are those previously described in Clidemia, such as Conostegia subpeltata and Conostegia trichosantha, which grow in the understory mostly of cloud forests. Twigs vary from terete and slender to somewhat quadrangular and robust. Particularly the species with thick twigs such as Conostegia bigibbosa and Conostegia macrantha, tend to have lenticels on the nodes.\n\nLeaves\n\nLeaves are opposite and generally decussate as is the case in most species in the family. In one species, Conostegia henripittieri, they are always strongly anisophyllous. Most species of sections Australis and Conostegia have leaves with nerved venation and species in section Geniculatae tend to be strongly plinerved. Variation in leaf morphology among species is most evident in section Geniculatae with one peltate species (Conostegia peltata) and a subpeltate species (Conostegia subpeltata), as well as species with sessile leaves (Conostegia dissitiflora) or strongly attenuate leaf bases (Conostegia consimilis). In addition, many species of section Geniculatae tend to have asymmetric leaf venation. In Conostegia grayumii for example, almost every leaf is asymmetrical at the base.\n\nLeaf anatomy\n\nThirty leaves of 26 species within Conostegia were collected in the field, fixed in FAA, and then sectioned as explained above. Leaves of all Conostegia studied are hypostomatic. The cuticle is generally inconspicuous but sometimes can be relatively thick as in Conostegia rhodopetala (Fig. ). The mesophyll is dorsiventral (Figs , ), and druses were present in all species, usually near the adaxial or abaxial leaf epidermis. The size of the druses varies. Some species such Conostegia tenuifolia have more space in the mesophyll. Leaf thickness varied but in general leaves were thinner in section Geniculatae (Fig. ). At least two types of coriaceous leaves were found. Populations of Conostegia montana from Cerro Jefe, Panama, have a very thick mesophyll and are the most evidently coriaceous leaves encountered in this survey. The other thick-leaved species were found to have a hypodermis one cell layer thick. This hypodermis is found only in Conostegia montelagreana in section Australis and in the species of the giant stigma clade (species sampled were Conostegia bigibbosa, Conostegia icosandra, Conostegia oerstediana, and Conostegia pittieri) where it appears to have evolved in their common ancestor (Fig. ). Mentink and Baas (1992) reported the presence of a hypodermis in Conostegia subcructulata but sections done for this study failed to locate a hypodermis in that this species (Fig. ). In the Melastomataceae the function of the hypodermis has been suggested to be related to water storage in epiphytic species (Reginato et al. 2009) or protecting the palisade parenchyma against solar radiation in terrestrial species (Ely et al. 2005). The spongy mesophyll was usually not lignified except in some species, such as Conostegia ombrophila and Conostegia schlimii.\n\nThe petioles in Conostegia bigibbosa and some Costa Rican and Guatemalan populations of Conostegia montana have two protuberances at the apex of the petiole on the abaxial surface. Scanning electron micrographs of these protuberances evidenced a glabrous area with some stomata suggesting that they might be extrafloral nectaries. However, anatomical sections in Conostegia bigibbosa did not indicate the presence of carbohydrates. Cross sections of petioles show variation in shape from rounded to somewhat heart shaped, grooved or flat adaxially as in Conostegia consimilis, Conostegia schlimii, Conostegia tenuifolia, and Conostegia bernoulliana (Fig. ). Five to nine amphicribal bundles are present, forming an interrupted arc. The lowermost bundles tend to be larger as in Conostegia rufescens, Conostegia subcrustulata and Conostegia schlimii, (Fig. ). Smaller bundles are sometimes present inside the primary arc as in Conostegia bernoulliana, Conostegia bracteata, Conostegia rufescens, and Conostegia tenuifolia (Fig. ). Petioles are mostly unlignified but sclereids are present in some species, but besides the sclereids, petioles were mostly unlignified. Some lignification of the petiole was observed in Conostegia rufescens and Conostegia schlimii.\n\nLeaf domatia\n\nThree types of domatia occur in Conostegia. In two species, Conostegia dentata and Conostegia setosa, the domatia are of the formicarium type which house ants and are manifested as large swellings at the base of the leaf. The other two types are both mite domatia, present at the base of the leaf on the abaxial side at the point of divergence between the midvein and the primary lateral veins. The general classification of domatia used here follows Jacobs (1966). The first kind of mite domatium is the tuft mite domatium present in Conostegia procera (Fig. ). This species always has these structures, which are densely covered by stipitate stellate to dendritic trichomes. This type of domatium is also seen in some but not all specimens of Conostegia hirtella. The second type of mite domatium is the pocket domatium which literally looks like a pocket formed by a membrane (Fig. ). Some pocket domatia are further called vesicular domatia because they are inflated. Pocket domatia are present in only the clade comprising Conostegia ecuadorensis, Clidemia hammelii, and Conostegia ombrophila. Among the species having pocket domatia, Conostegia ecuadorensis is unique in that there are domatia present on both the innermost pair of primary lateral veins as well as on the outermost pair of lateral veins.\n\nIndument\n\nTrichomes in Conostegia are quite diverse and variable (Fig. ). This may not come as a surprise since trichomes in the Melastomataceae have been said to be the most diverse in the angiosperms (Wurdack 1986). In many cases trichome morphology is easy to describe, such as with simple or lepidote trichomes. Difficulty in describing trichomes arises with the vast variation in dendritic trichomes, and with the gradations from dendritic to stellate. Wurdack (1986) noted that all types in the family are multicellular and, of the 46 trichomes types he recognized, 14 were recorded in species of Conostegia sensu Schnell (1996). Schnell (1996) discussed trichomes in Conostegia extensively noting that Conostegia species tend to have a mixture of trichomes and that variation within a species is extensive. I have noted extreme variation in Conostegia icosandra, which can be densely hirsute in the northern part of its range. Conostegia superba has also caused confusion because in the mainland specimens tend to be glabrous or almost so, but in the Dominican Republic they can be quite pubescent except for the floral buds. As noted by Schnell (1996), and even now taking the phylogeny into account, it is evident that similar trichomes have evolved independently within Conostegia. One example involves the interdependent evolution of stipitate trichomes of Conostegia brenesii and Conostegia caelestis. Schnell (1996) divided the trichomes of Conostegia into the three general groups recognizable based on the work on Wurdack (1986): 1) tiny glands, 2) elongate simple hairs, and 3) a series of eight potentially intergrading kinds of stellate and branching hairs. Schnell (1996) stated that continuous variation among these eight groups made it difficult to describe them. I agree with Schnell and recommend that into the future, a quantitative method should be developed to describe and perhaps discretize these complicated dendritic to stellate trichomes. In the meantime, I have chosen to document the trichomes in a similar way as Wurdack (1986) did, with extensive Scanning Electron Micrographs (Figs – ). Apparently all taxa have minute glands on the abaxial leaf surface, and their shape is variable and may prove to be taxonomically informative. Their small size makes them difficult to describe, especially in species with dense pubescence on the leaf abaxial surfaces. To compliment Wurdack’s (1986) initiative for Conostegia, I placed special attention on documenting these minute glands as much as possible.\n\nAll species with discolorous leaves are in section Geniculatae. However, this character has evolved independently a number of times within the section and not all discolorous leaves are the result of the same type of trichome. In some cases such as Conostegia xalapensis the dense indument on the abaxial surface is made up of stellate trichomes with long, thin arms, whereas in closely related Conostegia osaensis they are lepidote. Many species in section Geniculatae have an orange-colored indument of dendritic to stellate trichomes on the stems, especially towards the apex, which are less common in the other sections or if present do not tend not to form a conspicuous orange covering.\n\nInflorescence\n\nInflorescences in Conostegia are variable among species as in most clades of Miconieae (Michelangeli et al. 2004). Most species have terminal erect panicles with many flowers, but the inflorescence can be deflexed. In some species previously described in Miconia as well as in some species traditionally placed in Conostegia such as Conostegia cinnamomea and Conostegia muriculata, the inflorescence can be evidently deflexed. Axillary or pseudolateral inflorescences tend to have fewer, smaller flowers and are present mainly in those taxa previously described in Clidemia. Some small-flowered taxa do have many flowers such as Conostegia consimilis. Bracts are usually early deciduous in sections Australis and sections Conostegia except in species such as Conostegia monteleagreana which has persistent bracts subtending the floral glomerules. On the other hand, many species in section Geniculatae have bracts and bracteoles that are persistent and fused at the base, forming an inconspicuous nodal collar. Inflorescence branches are particularly thin, wiry, and delicate in several species within section Geniculatae such as Conostegia cinnamomea, Conostegia grayumii, and Conostegia ombrophila. It was the presence of this type of inflorescence, as well as the similar bracteoles amongst other characters that prompted Schnell (1996) to state that the similarities between Conostegia cinnamomea and Conostegia brenesiana are “little short of uncanny, involving almost every character, even to minute details”.\n\nAccessory branches in inflorescences are common in Conostegia, especially in taxa with relatively long terminal inflorescences. Although it is tempting to use the presence of these accessory branches in the systematics of the group, they are absent in some specimens, and in such cases it is difficult to tell if they fell off or were not there to begin with. Accessory branches are consistently absent in most species of section Geniculatae\n\nPedicels in Conostegia are also variable among species and major clades. In particular, species within section Conostegia can have quite long pedicels, as previously noted by Judd and Skean (1991). These pedicels can further elongate as the flowers develop into fruits. Pedicels are absent (flowers sessile) in some species such as Conostegia monteleagreana in section Australis and Conostegia colliculosa and Conostegia povedae in section Geniculatae. Schnell (1996) noted that in certain species the pedicels are clustered at the end of the inflorescence branches. This clustering is such that the pedicels appear to arise from the axils of other pedicels hence naming these taxa in his section Axilliflora Schnell -ined (see figure of Conostegia superba for an example). Species in this section do not form a clade as evidenced by the molecular phylogeny where Conostegia monteleagreana falls in a different clade than Conostegia cuatrecasii, Conostegia rhodopetala, and Conostegia superba (Fig. ; see also Kriebel et al. 2015). Nonetheless, Schnell (1996) himself noted that the species of section Axilliflora did not sort out into clear groups.\n\nFlowers\n\nFloral buds in calyptrate species of Conostegia are noticeable because of their calyx tends to fall as a unit at anthesis. Calyptrate calyces have arisen independently at least 15 times just in the Neotropical genera of the family and can be variously shaped (Fig. ) (Schnell 1996). In the Miconieae, five genera have at least some species with a calyptra namely: Conostegia, Mecranium, Miconia, Tetrazygia and Tococa (Schnell 1996). Schnell (1996) considered floral buds to be the most useful structures not only to identify species at the generic level but also within Conostegia. In general terms their size and shape can be taxonomically useful, as well as the presence of warts or different types of indument on the hypanthium. The apex of the buds can also be helpful for identifying some species. An apiculate calyptra for example, is present in several distinct species from different geographical areas. In South America, the aptly named Conostegia apiculata is readily distinguished. In northern Central America, the distinctively apiculate calyptra of Conostegia arborea is not easily confused with others; the same is true of Conostegia pittieri in the mountains of Costa Rica and western Panama, but in this area there are other species that can have somewhat apiculate calyptras (e.g. Conostegia tenuifolia and Conostegia rhodopetala).\n\nPhylogenetic and anatomical analyses have revealed that the calyptra evolved at least three times within Conostegia (Kriebel et al. 2015). This is a surprise because most workers previously thought the calyptrate calyx was shared by all species in the genus (Judd and Skean 1991; Schnell 1996) even referring to Conostegia as monophyletic without phylogenetic analyses of any kind (Judd and Skean 1991). Schnell (1996) did point to the possibility of the independent origin of the calyptra in Conostegia cinnamomea, and stated that because these structures had evolved in the family there was possibly a selective force driving their evolution. The adaptive value of the calyptra remains unknown.\n\nThe calyptra of species in sections Australis and Conostegia are very similar in that they have conspicuous sclereids and no calyx teeth nor appendages (Fig. ). The sclereids for the most part form a layer or two throughout the hypanthium and calyptra (Fig. ). The main difference in the calyptra of these two sections is that in section Australis, the calyptra ruptures at one side and/or breaks into pieces in all species observed in the field (Fig. ). In section Conostegia all evidence points to a cleanly circumscissle calyptra which Judd and Skean (1991) and Schnell (1996) believed was the case in all species of Conostegia. Independent origins of the calyptra are also seen in Conostegia cinnamomea, which has a very thin calyptra, and in the clade comprised of Conostegia osaensis, Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, and Conostegia xalapensis. The calyptra in this latter clade lacks evident sclereids (Fig. ). Although most species have a glabrous calyptra on the inside, three closely related species, i.e. Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa and Conostegia xalapensis tend to have stellate trichomes inside the calyptra.\n\nWithin section Geniculatae, sclereids are mostly absent from the hypanthium and calyx. Some scattered sclereids are seen in the hypanthium of Conostegia schlimii. In the floral anatomy of this section there are two general patterns that are absent in sections Australis and Conostegia. First, in several species of Geniculatae there is a lining of druses around the ovary (Fig. ). Second, several species have a distinctly bicolored anatomy where the ovary tissue stains red, indicating some lignification but the rest of the hypanthium stains blue. In fewer specimens of section Geniculatae the hypanthium stains either totally red or entirely blue. For further anatomical differences between the ovaries in section Geniculatae and the other two sections Australis and Conostegia, see below under the Gynoecium section.\n\nAnother unusual characteristic of the calyx of non-calyptrate species in section Geniculatae is the presence of an irregularly rupturing calyx in several of them (Fig. ). This type of calyx is usually translucent. An example of the anatomy of the translucent calyx of Conostegia friedmaniorum is presented next to the calyx of Conostegia schlimii (a species without a translucent calyx) (Fig. ). In all cases of species with this type of calyx, because it ruptures, the calyx lobes are irregularly shaped. The calyx teeth in calyptrate taxa are difficult to assess. In sections Australis and most calyptrate species of Geniculatae they appear to be totally absent and anatomical sections failed to reveal them. In Conostegia cinnamomea, anatomical sections did evidence their presence. On the other hand, within the clade of Conostegia osaensis, Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, and Conostegia xalapensis one sees what seem to be inconspicuous calyx teeth in Conostegia subcrustulata. Schnell (1996) included the aforementioned clade (except Conostegia osaensis which was undescribed at the time) in his section Tomentostegia. In his description of that section, Schnell (1996) described the calyx lobes as fused and usually with free teeth or prolonged appendages. Assessing if these teeth or appendages are homologous to calyx teeth is difficult. To complicate things even more, in Conostegia osaensis, which is the sister clade, the calyx teeth appear to be at the level of the torus as is common in species of section Geniculatae and more generally in most species of the tribe Miconieae.\n\nFlowers in the species traditionally treated in Conostegia also stand out among genera of Miconieae because most of them are pleiostemonous, meaning that they have more than double the number of stamens than petals (Fig. ). Other pleiostemonous taxa do exist within the Miconieae, but they are not thought to be closely related to Conostegia. There is one pleiostemonous species that has been named in Conostegia, Conostegia inusitata, which appears not to be closely related to the other named taxa in the genus. This suggestion comes from a nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence (Kriebel, unpublished data) of an undescribed and closely related species to Conostegia inusitata, which Schnell (1996) proposed as the new species Florbella wurdackii. The genus Florbella was proposed by Schnell to accommodate these two species, but it has yet to be published. Inclusion of this DNA sequence in phylogenetic analyses of Miconieae suggests it is more closely related to a clade of mostly Peruvian species of Miconia than to species of Conostegia. The concept of Conostegia included in the present treatment includes many diplostemonous species, particularly those previously described as Clidemia and Miconia. These diplostemonous taxa are almost completely restricted to section Geniculatae (Fig. ), with a few diplostemonous taxa also found in section Conostegia (e.g. Conostegia setosa).\n\nCorolla\n\nThe corolla in Conostegia varies dramatically in size, shape and number of parts among species (Figs , ) and sometimes also within species. Petal number can range from 4 to 12. Petal shape is quite variable among species and in general they tend to be asymmetric with notable exceptions e.g. in some species in section Geniculatae. Many species especially in section Australis and section Conostegia tend to have strongly asymmetrical petals. The posture of the petals is usually spreading with some species (particularly small-flowered ones) having reflexed petals. Petals are always imbricate in bud and overlap in a counter-clockwise fashion (Schnell 1996). At anthesis petals are usually imbricate in large flowered taxa but the overlap tends to decrease as the flowers get smaller. Petal margins are for the most part entire but in many large-flowered taxa they can have a more membranous texture on one side (Fig. ). Petal apices are mostly rounded, truncate, or emarginate, and in a few species they can be narrowly rounded to acute. One species (Conostegia consimilis) was originally described in the genus Leandra because of its acuminate petals. Petal bases are not evidently clawed, except in Conostegia schlimii.\n\nWhite is the most common petal color found in Conostegia with a few species having pink to purple petals such as Conostegia bigibbosa, Conostegia cuatrecasii, and Conostegia muriculata. In a few taxa like Conostegia fragrantissima the white petals can have a red band at the base. Translucent petals can be found in different clades as well, and although it is tempting to think this might be related to floral size because several small-flowered taxa have them, some species with large petals have translucent petals as well (e.g. Conostegia lasiopoda). Most species have glabrous petals but at least one has conspicuously papillose petals (Conostegia papillopetala). Petal surfaces tend to be smooth in translucent petaled taxa and with rounded papillose cells in white-flowered species (Fig. ). Although this difference in petal cells is evident also in micrographs (Fig. ), intermediates exist and further study is needed to determine their possible systematic utility. In a few species, the petals persist after all other floral parts have fallen (of which Conostegia pittieri might be the most notable example).\n\nAndroecium\n\nThe androecium in Conostegia consists of 8–52 isomorphic stamens. The basic arrangement of the stamens consists of five of them inserted opposite the sepals and five of them opposite the petals like most species in the Melastomataceae. Increase in the number of stamens are common, even predominant in sections Australis and Conostegia. These increases result in pleiostemony, and were the subject of a recent floral developmental study (Puglisi 2007; Wanntorp et al. 2011) which found two ways in which Conostegia species increase in stamen number: 1) by having a large stamen in alternipetalous position with small ones in antipetalous position; or 2) by a process called dedoublement where the stamens split in two (Puglisi 2007; Wanntorp et al. 2011). There appears to be no clear pattern indicating evolutionary relationships, with taxa with either of these developmental pathways being more closely related to another with the opposite pathway.\n\nThe posture of the stamens can go from erect, to forming a more or less a 45-degree angle between the filament and the anther (Fig. ). Species with stamens that form an angle tend to have at least slightly bilaterally symmetric androecia. This condition is common in sections Australis and Conostegia as well as in the clade composed of Conostegia osaensis, Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, and Conostegia xalapensis within section Geniculatae. Bilateral symmetry in Conostegia appears also to be related to interactions between the stamen and style during development at least partly the result of the increase in number of stamens. Species in section Geniculatae, excluding the clade mentioned above, have stamens that cleanly surround the style and are radially symmetric, yet the flowers of these species might still have slight bilateral symmetry as a result of a gently curving style. In at least two species, Conostegia fragrantissima and Conostegia pittieri, the stamens are bent away and opposite the style.\n\nThe filaments are mostly white to translucent. Sections Australis and Conostegia lack a clear geniculation towards the apex of the filament, whereas in section Geniculatae the geniculation is present in almost every species, except perhaps in Conostegia fraterna (Figs – ). It is significant that the molecular phylogeny of Kriebel et al. (2015) placed species traditionally recognized in Conostegia such as Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata and Conostegia xalapensis in Geniculatae and that the latter three species which were studied from field-collected floral material have an evident filament geniculation. This morphological character thus supports their placement within section Geniculatae. It has to be considered that some variation does exist. For example, the micrograph of Conostegia xalapensis (Fig. ) does not show the evident geniculation very well whereas the photographs of the pickled stereoscope images of the same specimen do. In general, Conostegia xalapensis shows an evident geniculation. Although most species which have filament geniculations present them towards the apex of the filament, in one species, Conostegia brenesiana, the geniculation is in the middle of the filament.\n\nAnthers in Conostegia are almost exclusively yellow to sometimes orange (i.e. Conostegia fragrantissima) with some taxa having hues of pink towards the apex in some populations (i.e. Conostegia rufescens). In some species particularly in section Australis the anthers can be cream colored. Anthers in Conostegia lack evident staminal appendages with at the most, some species (e.i., Conostegia bernoulliana) having an inconspicuous dorsal bump on the anther connective. The only structure that resembles an anther appendage in Conostegia is present in most species of section Australis. In these taxa, the anther base is briefly prolonged below the junction of the filament and anther thecae (Fig. ). This character was recently documented in some species of Tococa (Michelangeli 2005) and Pachyanthus (Bécquer 2008). The documentation of this type of anther base in Conostegia is relevant because it had not been used before in the systematics of the group, and although lost in some species, helps to identify species in section Australis.\n\nAnther shape in Conostegia varies a lot even when considering only the species treated traditionally in the genus. This is in contrast to what has been previously stated in the literature. In their taxonomic studies of the Miconieae, Judd and Skean (1991) remarked that the non-appendaged anthers characteristic of Conostegia are ovoid, tapered to the apex, and open by a small apical pore. These anther characters lead to conclude that the genus did not evolve from within Miconia, since members of the latter genus show various modifications of either pore or connective structure. We now know that Conostegia is phylogenetically nested within the Miconieae, and furthermore that anthers of its species can be ovoid, oblong, linear, or variations on these shapes (Schnell 1996; Fig. ). They are definitely not all ovoid. Also, they can be recurved or arcuate making them diffciult to describe. In addition, it is not very useful to say that a small pore characterizes the anthers of Conostegia. In fact, most species of Miconieae have small anther pores corresponding to their buzz pollinated syndrome, and for this reason this type of pore was coded as plesiomorphic by Judd and Skean (1991). Even if the size of the pore proves useful in the systematics of Conostegia, continuous measurements would have to be employed to determine their utility. The shape of the anther apices and anther pores is quite variable in Conostegia and merits further research. This will require careful placement of critically point dried anther apices on stubs and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Some of the variation seen in the pores has to do with the deeply channeled anthers in the ventral surface. In some taxa this deep channel reaches the pore area but in others it does not. Conostegia brenesiana stands out because of its very small anther thecae with broad pores which can resemble anthers in Miconia section Cremanium. In most species the pores are terminal to ventrally inclined. Dorsally inclined pores can be found in some species of section Geniculatae, and are especially evident in Conostegia cinnamomea (Figs , ).\n\nWith respect to the anatomy of the anthers, the sporangia in each anther theca were found to have two general arrangements. In species of section Australis and Conostegia they tend to be positioned side by side. On the contrary, in section Geniculatae they tend to be more-or-less superposed. All anthers were found to have druses. In some species such as Conostegia lasiopoda and Conostegia oerstediana, the druses are present in the staminal connective, endothecium and anther septum (Fig. ). In others, they are mostly restricted to the septum like in Conostegia tenuifolia. Species in section Geniculatae tend to have druses on the proximal half of the outer side of the anthers (as in Conostegia fraterna, Conostegia friedmaniorum, Conostegia ombrophila, and Conostegia subcrustulata) (Fig. ).\n\nPollen of species in the Melastomataceae has been rarely documented in taxonomic treatments. This may be because the few studies that have been done have revealed little variation (reviewed in Renner 1993). For the species studied, Renner (1993) summarized the pollen as small, tricolporate, radially symmetrical, and isopolar; occasionally grains may have 4, 5 or more colpi, and some grains are dicolporate or heteropolar. Faint to distinct pseudocolpi (or subsidiary colpi, in the terminology of Patel et al. 1984) are usually present. The surface sculpture is smooth and striate to rugulate or rugulate-verrucate. Polyads and tetrads are known from Tococa spadiciflora and Miconia melanotricha (Patel et al. 1984). In the case of Conostegia, Roubik and Moreno (1991) provided the only images known to me of the anatomy of pollen of Conostegia species (including Conostegia shattuckii as Miconia shattuckii). I have found that the pollen characteristics of Conostegia agree with Renner’s (1993) general description for the family; this is shown in micrographs provided for several species (Fig. ).\n\nGynoecium\n\nThe gynoecium can have from 4 to 25 carpels (Schnell 1996). Placentation is axillary as in most Melastomataceae (Renner 1993). The placenta in most Conostegia protrudes into the locule, either in laminar fashion with the ovules attached at the sides, or it is peltate with a clear stipe (Fig. ). Intermediates are present, and in a few cases (e.g. Conostegia xalapensis), the placenta looks like the peltate kind but lacks a clear stipe. Species of sections Australis and Conostegia have inferior ovaries, and in some species of section Conostegia the ovary can be elevated into an evident collar around the style base. Species in these two sections all have glabrous ovary apices. In contrast, species of section Geniculatae tend to have ovaries about two thirds inferior and several species have glandular-pubescent ovary apices. A collar around the style base is usually absent in section Geniculatae. Species of sections Australis and Conostegia have a glabrous torus whereas species in section Geniculatae can have a glabrous or glandular-puberulent torus. In one species, Conostegia osaensis, the torus is beset with lepidote trichomes.\n\nA significant discovery of this study is the deep blue stain recorded in anatomical sections inside the ovary of species in sections Australis and Conostegia (Fig. ). On the other hand, this staining is absent in section Geniculatae. Staining with Ruthenium red has provided evidence that the substance in question is mucilaginous pectin, and field tests and photographs by Reinaldo Aguilar of with Conostegia bernoulliana in the Osa Peninsula have demonstrated that the berries are sticky as would be expected from the presence of mucilage.\n\nConostegia can be said to have the highest diversity in style and stigma morphology in the whole Melastomataceae (Fig. ). Most notable is the presence of crateriform lobed stigmas in several species (Figs , ). These crateriform stigmas are unique to a subclade of Conostegia, although in some species the crater is reduced to almost absent but the lobes mostly remain present. Besides these obvious outliers, the diversity is still pronounced, ranging from short, stout, straight or apically hooked styles, to long, straight or gently curving styles. Stigmas can be punctiform, truncate, or variously enlarged (Fig. ). Styles in Conostegia can be exserted or not. Biologically, this exertion corresponds to the maintenance of herkogamy (see Reproductive Biology section). Although the posture of the style appears to be taxonomically informative, this posture can vary through time within the same individual in some species. In species with exserted styles, two general trends are noticeable. The first trend, seen in species of section Australis as well as Conostegia schlimii of section Geniculatae, is one in which the flower is either facing upward, or horizontally and thus the style is erect or horizontal. In both these similar postures, the style tends to surve gently towards the apex resulting in a more or less S shape. The other trend in species with exserted styles is almost the norm in species of section Geniculatae and involves deflexed styles. It should be noted that in this revision, exemplary flowers of all sections are presented in erect position for convenience (see Figs through 43), but in the taxonomic treatment, images of live flowering plants display the natural posture of the flowers.\n\nThere are two main clades where the style is not exserted beyond the stamens (not herkogamous). The first corresponds to section Conostegia and the other to the clade comprised of Conostegia osaensis, Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, and Conostegia xalapensis. Aside from the crateriform and or lobed stigma clade, which are derived from section Conostegia, all remaining taxa with a short style appear to have either a straight style or one that bends upward below the stigma. Within section Conostegia, style posture appears to change in most of its members, particularly in the crateriform or lobed stigma clade. The few observations of species in this group (Stratton 1989; Schnell 1996) suggest their flowers can last about two days. During this time the style bends downward usually blocking numerous stamens. Preliminary experiments (Kriebel unpublished data) show that if the style is removed, the stamens can unveil normally and that if the stamens are removed the style still bends (see photographs in section on Reproductive biology).\n\nIn the styles of the Conostegia clade, another outstanding aspect involves the presence of a stele within for their entire length (Figs , ). Specifically, section Conostegia and convergently Conostegia ortizae in section Australis present this phenomenon. This stele is unknown in the rest of the Melastomataceae. Schnell (1996) was the first to document the stele in two species which are phenotypically divergent but belong to section Conostegia. This character is helpful to confirm the hypothesis, derived by optimizing morphological traits on the molecular phylogeny, that the calyptra and short style seen in the clade composed of Conostegia osaensis, Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, and Conostegia xalapensis must have evolved independently from the similar morphology seen in section Conostegia. No species including the ones just mentioned of section Geniculatae were found to have a vascular cylinder inside the style. These results also coincide with Schnell’s (1996) observations of a lack of a cylinder in Conostegia subcrustulata. The stele found in the style of Conostegia ortizae, in general, differs from those in species of section Conostegia because it has fewer vascular traces.\n\nFruits\n\nFruits of most species traditionally recognized as Conostegia have a truncate apex produced by the dehiscence or breaking of the calyptra. In addition, some have a prominent ovary apex that is retained in the berry and can be highly elevated in fruit (Fig. ). Fruits of some species such as those of Conostegia oerstediana have a pleasant taste.\n\nSeeds\n\nAlmost all species of Conostegia have small seeds averaging about 0.5 mm in length and varying in number from hundreds to thousands in a single berry. The most significant deviation from this pattern is observed in the clade comprised of Conostegia osaensis, Conostegia plumosa, Conostegia speciosa, Conostegia subcrustulata, and Conostegia xalapensis, where seeds are fewer in number and average about double in length.\n\nSeeds in Conostegia are mostly ovoid except for section Geniculatae where several species have pyramidal seeds (Figs – ) (Ocampo and Almeda 2013). In some cases like Conostegia brenesiana most seeds are pyramidal but ovoid seeds can sometimes be found in the same fruit. Angles are absent except for some species in section Geniculatae that can be strongly angled. The lateral symmetrical plane is ovate in sections Australis and section Conostegia and frequently triangular in section Geniculatae. Tubercles on the seed surface are evident in in section Geniculatae and in Conostegia monteleagreana of section Australis but are absent in section Conostegia.\n\nThe conclusion of this study is that despite the difficulty in coding seed characters, species of section Australis and section Conostegia have very similar seeds in being ovoid and smooth, whereas there is a lot of variation in seed morphology is in section Geniculatae, with ovoid to pyramidal seeds that frequently have angles and tubercle-like cells present just on the angles or covering the whole seed.\n\nTaxonomic treatment\n\nConostegia\n\nKeywords: Plantae, Myrtales, Melastomataceae\n\nD.

Flowers diplostemonous or pleiostemonous, 4-12-merous; calyx calyptrate or not, if calyptrate with or without calyx teeth and the calyptras varying from very thin to very thick, glabrous to pubescent like the hypanthium and with or without sclereids, if the calyx not calyptrate, fused in some species and rupturing irregularly at anthesis into irregular lobes, in non calyptrate species the calyx lobes mostly inconspicuous and similar to the calyx teeth, not conspicuous except in Conostegia incurva; petals reflexed or generally spreading, linear-oblong to broadly obovate, the apex acute to rounded, evidently clawed at the base at least on one species (Conostegia schlimii), mostly glabrous, in at least one species conspicuously papillose (Conostegia papillopetala), translucent to mostly white, in a few species pink or purple, the petals cells on the adaxial surface mostly rounded in species with colored petals and flattened in species with translucent petals. Stamens 8 to ca. 52, arranged neatly around the style in diplostemonous taxa and less neatly but similarly in most pleiostemonous taxa, a few species with the stamens bent to one side of the flower (i.e., Conostegia fragrantissima and Conostegia pittieri), filaments translucent white to white, with or without an evident geniculation near the apex, the connective not prolonged nor appendaged, the filament anther insertion transitioning smoothly or with a “shoulder” or abrupt step, anthers linear, oblong, elliptic or ovate, apically rounded or acute, basally acute, rounded or sagittate, yellow, less frequently whitish or with pinkish hues, laterally compressed, with druses in the endothecium, the pore oriented totally upward, somewhat ventrally inclined or less frequently dorsally inclined, usually small, broad in one species (Conostegia brenesiana), anther sporangia positioned laterally or more or less superposed. Ovary from almost superior to usually totally inferior, 4–25 locular, the placentas within each locule laminar, triangular or peltate, with or without mucilage inside; the style exserted beyond the stamens or not, cylindrical and linear, to shaped as an inverted crateriform cone, when linear, sometimes gently bending to abruptly bending below the stigma, hollow or with a stele within, the stigma lobed or not, papillose. Berries small to large, mostly purple, sweet and usually pleasant to human taste; seeds mostly numerous ad small (ca. 0.5 mm long), few and large in a few species, largest in Conostegia osaensis (ca. 1.5 mm long), ovoid to pyramidal, sometimes evidently angular, the testa smooth in most species, tuberculate all over in some, and in fewer still, with the tubercles restricted to the angles.\n\nSpecies concepts in this revision for the most part follow the morphological species concept as defined by Cronquist (1978) in which species are “the smallest groups that are consistently and persistently distinct, and distinguishable by ordinary means.” It is a problematic concept partly because defining “distinct” is subjective and varies across organisms. Nonetheless, it is the most common species concept applied to plants (McDade 1995), and an effort was made to recognize only species that appear distinct. This author views species as hypotheses that are subject to testing. Thus the reader should be aware that some species may someday prove to be synonymous with others, and some species complexes might prove to be made of cryptic species in need of recognition. Properties of other species concepts are desirable, such as defining species based on monophyly (e.g. the phylogenetic species concept), but the lack of enough representative specimens in the phylogenetic analyses of many species, as well as appropriate molecular markers to ascertain clades (species) with confidence, and inherent biological processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, preclude much of its use in the present treatment. In this monograph when a negative measurement is given for the distance between the anther and the stigma, this means that the anthers are below the stigma for that length.\n\nKey to the sections and species of Conostegia\n\n1Sepals not fused into a calyptra, sometimes rupturing late at anthesis into irregular lobes, calyx teeth present at the level of the torus or slightly above; flowers diplostemonous (sect.
