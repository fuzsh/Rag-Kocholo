        "text": "At its most foundational level, mathematics is all about play. If youâ€™ve ever sat down and observed children play, you might notice they are great experimenters. They love to pick up new toys and see how they work- and in doing so, often naturally explore mathematical concepts through play.\n\nHere are six ways that your children can use Connetix to explore mathematical concepts.\n\nConnetix magnetic tiles enable children to experiment with units of measurement through play, expand their understanding and reasoning around measurement, including making direct and indirect comparisons about the length or weight of two or more designs.\n\nAs Connetix tiles come in a variety of sizes, shapes and weight, they naturally encourage children to explore and play with units of measurement.\n\nPlay ideas:\n\nCreate two towers and compare which is taller? Shorter?\n\nCreate two boxes out of Connetix squares and ask children to fill them with objects. Identify which box is heavier/lighter\n\nKids naturally love to fill items in an open container. Our 24 piece motion pack is being used in the picture to store items in a train container.\n\nChildren love to explore and experiment with different tiles to make all kinds of creations. Because two-dimensional and three-dimensional concepts can be quite abstract, Connetix magnetic tiles make the perfect at-home resource to play with different shapes to see how they can work together. Connetix allow children to explore and create both 2D and 3D shapes through play, allowing them to use their innate curiosity and imagination to experiment with different tiles and create complex creations.\n\nPlay ideas:\n\nTrace around different Connetix shapes on a large piece of paper or whiteboard. Ask children to solve the puzzle by finding each matching shape. Discuss the different features of each shape.\n\nGive children a stack of Connetix equilateral triangles and see what they create (do they create a flatly pattern? Do they create pyramids?) Repeat this with all the other shapes in your Connetix collection and discuss the different features of each shape.\n\nOur 100 piece creative pack makes an excellent gift for your creative toddler while expanding their reasoning with shapes that follow foundational mathematical standards.\n\nThe ability to describe the position and movement of an object is a foundational mathematical skill. Connetix magnetic tiles make it easy for your child to experiment with different creations to expand their vocabulary around position and movement.\n\nChildren are natural tinkerers. Thatâ€™s what makes the Connetix brand so fun! As your child learns how the magnetic tiles work, they will instantly begin raising the stakes to see what they can build and even incorporate some of their favourite toys into the mix.\n\nPlay ideas:\n\nEncourage children to observe and explain what and how they build, explaining how/why an object moves from one place to another.\n\nCreate a box out of Connetix square tiles. Ask children to put an object inside the box, behind the box, on top of the box, beside the box, underneath/below the box. This activity can be explored with any Connetix creation and encourages children to become familiar with positional language.\n\nOur 92 piece ball run pack is an excellent option for children learning about location and transformation.\n\nChildren love to make inferences about the world around them, and Connetix is an excellent tool for developing their natural curiosity around interpreting data. They can use Connetix magnetic tiles to arrange data by colour, shape, size, or numerical values.\n\nPlay idea:\n\nSort your Connetix collection of tiles by size, shape, and/or colour. This can be explored on the floor, or add in some extra fun by finding vertical magnetic surfaces like a fridge or garage door.\n\nThe Connetix 62 piece starter pack is an excellent choice for developing an understanding of interpreting data.\n\nAsk any mathematician what makes them unique from other thinkers, and they may just say their ability to recognise patterns. Mathematics is routed in patterns, from the Fibonacci sequence to data analysis.\n\nConnetix magnetic tiles are perfect for recognising and creating patterns. The simple design of shapes and colours of different sizes helps children classify tiles before they know they are doing it.
