        "text": "The SLM®800 reaches peak performance when paired with the SLM®HUB, a fully-automated handling station. This integrated solution features automated transport of build cylinders with dedicated locations for pre-heating and cooling in an inert atmosphere. The SLM®HUB also removes manual powder handling from the production process with a centralized powder supply and a powder removal chamber that rotates and vibrates the finished substrate plate to automatically separate unused powder from the finished part, recycling it back to the sieving station for reuse in future builds. All machines connected to the SLM®HUB are fed metal powder through vacuum technology from the central powder station creating a completely closed-loop powder management system under an inert gas atmosphere.\n\nUp to five SLM®800 systems can be modularly connected to and operated from a single SLM®HUB. With a build cylinder magazine (BCM) multiple build cylinders can be handled in parallel to optimize machine uptime and scale to full production."
