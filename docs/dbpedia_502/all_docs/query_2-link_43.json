        "text": "What is a calibration tool?\n\nA calibration tool is a device used to verify and adjust the accuracy of measuring instruments. Calibration tools are essential in maintaining the accuracy of instruments used in many industries, including process industries.\n\nList of process calibration tools\n\nFluke and Fluke Calibration offer a complete line of bench and field calibration equipment for the process industries. The lineup includes accurate and dependable bench instruments as well as handheld, rugged tools designed for you to carry into the field. Whether for bench or field use, these calibration tools are multi-functional and easy to use, rugged, reliable, accurate, and dependable.\n\nMultimeters- used to measure voltage, current, and resistance, among other electrical signals\n\nCalibrators - used to simulate and measure various process signals such as temperature, pressure, and flow\n\nPortable field calibrators, mA Loop calibrators\n\nPressure calibrators\n\nTemperature calibrators\n\nElectrical calibrators\n\nPressure gauges - used to measure pressure\n\nTemperature probes - used to measure temperature\n\nFlow meters - used to measure flow rate\n\nInfrared thermometers - used to measure temperature from a distance\n\nOscilloscopes - used to measure electrical waveforms\n\nRegular calibration of these instruments is essential to maintain measurement accuracy and ensure the quality of the final product.\n\nWhat is process calibration?\n\nProcess calibration is the practice of checking, adjusting, and setting the accuracy of measuring instruments in process industries. Industries where the final product, once manufactured, can’t be separated into its individual components, such as pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, electrical power, and semi-conductors. Calibrations can occur in a calibration laboratory, out in the plant, or in the field using both bench and field calibration practices.\n\nWho calibrates process instrumentation?\n\nProcess calibration professionals can include metrologists, instrumentation and control (I&C) or electrical and instrumentation technicians, electrical technicians, or engineers. Some of these professionals work in a metrology lab. Others work in an instrument shop, and still others work out on the plant floor.\n\nCalibrating examples\n\nProcess calibration workload may include test and measurement equipment such as multimeters or portable field calibrators. It may also include process instruments and sensors, such as pressure or temperature transmitters, pressure gauges, temperature sensors, and electrical meters. Electrical, temperature, pressure, or a combination of parameters may need to be measured and adjusted. This calibration step is so these instruments remain accurate and meet any required industry or company standards.\n\nHow to use a calibration tool?\n\nTo use a calibration tool, identify the instrument you need to calibrate and the standard to which it will be compared. Then, follow the instructions provided with the calibration tool to adjust the instrument until it meets required accuracy standards. This is a process you will want to repeat regularly to ensure your instruments are accurate and reliable.\n\nList of the most frequently tested instruments for process calibration?\n\nProcess calibration tools are designed to test and calibrate a wide range of process signals and equipment. So once you have the tools you’ll need, you can head into the lab or out into the field to test some of the most frequently tested signals and equipment, which include:\n\nTemperature sensors and controllers\n\nPressure sensors and controllers\n\nFlow meters and controllers\n\npH and conductivity sensors and controllers\n\nLevel sensors and controllers\n\nControl valves\n\nAnalytical instruments such as gas chromatographs, spectrophotometers, and mass spectrometers\n\nElectrical and electronic equipment such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, and signal generators.\n\nSelecting a calibrator\n\nPressure Calibrator\n\nWhen selecting a pressure calibrator, you first need to understand the specifications of the device to be calibrated, the unit or device under test (UUT or DUT). Once you know the accuracy and uncertainty of the DUT, you can decide which type of pressure calibration instrument can be used most effectively in your work environment. Once you know which categories of instruments will meet your measurement uncertainty needs and will operate in your environment, you can determine which models in those categories can be used to calibrate your pressure devices, based on pressure measurement mode (absolute, gauge, differential), test medium (gas, oil, water) and pressure measurement range. Most calibration procedures require you to compare the device you’re testing with a calibration standard at multiple pressure points across the tested device’s range. While some have built-in pressure generation and/or control, so the standard you’re using may not need it. Finally, automate any part of the calibration process you can. It helps reduce mistakes, standardize procedures, make better measurements, and increase productivity.\n\nTemperature Calibrator\n\nCalibrating a temperature sensor requires understanding the thermometer being calibrated, such as the electrical signal it outputs or its physical characteristics. Determine the temperature range it is used over and what accuracies are required. Finally, figure out what kind of location you need to work in, a laboratory, or it may need to be calibrated in the field, or even in-situ. Knowing all of these parameters will lead you to select the temperature calibration tool that will work for your specific needs.\n\nSelecting an Industrial Temperature Calibrator »\n\nSelecting a Dry-Well Temperature Calibrator »\n\nBuying the Right Temperature Calibration Bath »\n\nHow to Choose a Calibration Bath »\n\nElectrical Calibrator\n\nAn electrical calibrator or tester should meet all the test equipment functions you need to calibrate. The calibrator should also have better performance than the required test specifications of the workload – the rule is that you typically want a calibrator with four, or more, times better performance than what you’re testing. Thoroughly analyze the specifications of your workload and the calibrator you choose. You can typically check the manufacturer’s recommended specifications for the tested equipment and the calibrator.\n\nMeasurement and sourcing\n\nThe calibration process typically involves both measurement and sourcing. Use a precision source to test a measurement instrument, and a precision measurement device to test a sourcing instrument.\n\nRelated reference materials\n\nProcess Calibration Tools: Temperature Applications »\n\nProcess Calibration Tools: Pressure Applications »\n\nThe Electronic Deadweight Tester: A Modern Replacement for the Conventional Deadweight Tester »\n\nBetter Ways to Troubleshoot Automation and Process Control Loops »"
