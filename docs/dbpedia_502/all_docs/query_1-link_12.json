        "text": "Notes\n\nPM200 gauge mode modules support absolute mode measurement when used with a barometric reference module. Instrumental uncertainty for gauge mode modules used in absolute mode by addition of a barometric reference module is calculated as the uncertainty of the gauge mode module root sum squared with the uncertainty of the barometric reference module. Uncertainty for gauge mode assumes routine zeroing which is default operating mode when used in a chassis. Uncertainty for absolute mode modules includes 1-year zero stability. This specification can be reduced to 0.05 % FS if the PM200 module is zeroed on a continuing basis to remove the 1-year zero stability component.\n\nThis module can be used as a barometric reference module.\n\nCompatible with 2271A and 6270A.\n\nCompatible with 2271A, 6270A and 8270A.\n\nCompatible with 2271A, 6270A, 8270A and 8370A.\n\nCompatible with 8270A and 8370A.\n\nCompatible with 8370A."
