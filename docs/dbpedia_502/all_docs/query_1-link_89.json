        "text": "Type Material: Temminck (1824: 36–38) based his description of Didelphis quica on an unknown number of specimens from various museums, presumably including one or more examples collected by Johann Natterer, whose information about the species was prominently acknowledged (“Nous devons à M. Natterer la connaissance plus exacte de cette espèce qu'il a envoyée au musée impérial de Vienne . . .”). In a published catalog of Natterer's mammals, Pelzeln (1883: 110–111) listed two specimens of D. quica, male and female, collected in 1818 at “Sapitiba” (= Sepetiba) near Rio de Janeiro. Of these, Hershkovitz (1959) designated the female as lectotype, apparently sight unseen. Unfortunately, this specimen is no longer in Vienna, where only the male topotype (NMW 7687/ST 1012) can now be found. The female may have been exchanged or gifted to Temminck, whose cabinet was subsequently transferred to the Leiden museum (formerly the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, now the Naturalis Biodiversity Center; S. Engelberger, personal commun., 26 November 2014), but no specimen currently in Leiden can be positively identified as Hershkovitz's lectotype (S. van der Mije, 25 November 2014).\n\nIn the absence of any compelling evidence to the contrary, we accept Hershkovitz's (1959) lectotype designation as valid. Although the specimen in question appears to have been lost (or to be unidentifiable), the fixation of the type locality is sufficient for confident application of Temminck's epithet to the Atlantic Forest species of southeastern Brazil. The male topotype mentioned above (consisting of the mounted skin and extracted skull of a very old animal with much-faded pelage and teeth worn away almost to the roots) is not taxonomically informative, but other examined specimens of Philander from the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro (in the AMNH and ZMB; see below) exhibit all the diagnostic traits that we attribute to P. quica in the description that follows.\n\nDistribution and Sympatry: Sequenced material and examined specimens that we assign to Philander quica are from rainforested tropical and subtropical landscapes in southeastern Brazil, northeastern Argentina (Misiones), and eastern Paraguay (fig. 9). Although P. quica is the only species of Philander known to occur throughout this biome (the Mata Atlântica of Brazilian authors), it might occur sympatrically with P. canus along its margins, where Atlantic rainforests come into contact with (or grade into) the gallery formations and semideciduous forests apparently preferred by the latter species. Additionally, the range of P. quica might contact that of P. opossum somewhere along the coastline between Bahia and Rio Grande do Norte.8 Published records of this species from the Cerrado, the Chaco, and western Amazonia (in Patton and da Silva, 1997, 2008; Hershkovitz, 1997) are based on misidentifications (see Remarks, below).\n\nDescription: Dorsal pelage short (usually <14 mm) and uniformly grayish, sometimes indistinctly darker along the midline but never with a distinctly blackish middorsal stripe (fig 10); fur of crown (between the ears) usually grizzled gray but sometimes blackish; pale preauricular spot absent or indistinct; ventral fur pale, usually self-whitish or -yellowish, sometimes with broad lateral zones of gray-based hairs on the throat and between the fore- and hind legs, but apparently always self-colored in the midline (fig. 11); pinnae pale (unpigmented) basally, but abruptly blackish distally; dorsal pelage of hind feet often indistinctly darker laterally than medially, but never distinctly blackish or with blackish markings; scaly part of tail usually onethird to slightly less than one-half white distally. Skull (fig. 12A, D) substantially smaller than those of most congeneric species (except P. canus). Nasal bones neither conspicuously elongated nor very short (about 47% of condylobasal length on average), not extending posteriorly to or between postorbital processes. Third upper premolar (P3) labial cingulum incomplete, apparently never extending to anterior base of crown; crown length of upper molar series 12.3 ± 0.4 mm (sexes combined; observed range 11.4–13.2 mm, N = 40); enameled lingual surfaces of upper molars smooth, not crenulated; pre- and postcingula consistently absent; lower molar posterior cingulids absent.\n\nPhylogeography and Geographic Variation: Our phylogenetic analysis of 28 cytochrome-b sequences of Philander quica spanning some 10 degrees of latitude (from the Braziltoian state of Bahia in the north to the Argentinian province of Misiones in the south) provides scant evidence of phylogeographic structure (fig. 13). This lack of genetic differentiation with distance is accompanied by an absence of conspicuous geographic variation in morphology. In effect, this appears to be a genetically and phenotypically homogeneous taxon.\n\nComparisons: Philander quica closely resembles P. canus, which is similar in size (tables 7, 8); also has uniformly grayish dorsal pelage and self-whitish, -yellowish, or -buffy ventral fur (figs. 10, 11); and is not visually distinctive in any aspect of cranial appearance (fig. 12). Chemisquy and Flores (2012) suggested that these taxa could be distinguished by the width of the postorbital constriction (least postorbital breadth in our terminology), but the samples we measured exhibit broad overlap in this dimension (e.g., 7.8–8.8 mm in P. quica males versus 7.4–8.4 mm in P. canus males). Philander quica and P. canus also have broadly overlapping distributions in the plane of the first two principal components that we computed from craniodental measurements of both taxa (not shown), a result consistent with our impression that these species are metrically very similar. Instead, qualitative morphological comparisons are more informative.\n\nIn side-by-side comparisons, the molars of Philander quica appear to have somewhat less well-developed anterolabial cingula, narrower protocones, deeper ectoflexi (especially on M3), and longer postmetacristae than those of P. canus, but the single most useful dental trait that distinguishes these taxa is the morphology of P3. Whereas the third upper premolar of P. canus always has a complete labial cingulum that extends along the entire base of the tooth from anterior to posterior (fig. 14A), the labial cingulum of P3 is incomplete in P. quica, apparently never extending anteriorly past the middle of that tooth (fig. 14B). Unfortunately, we have not found any external trait by which these species can be reliably identified in the field.\n\nClose comparisons between Philander quica and our new species, P. pebas, seem unnecessary given their widely separated geographic distributions (fig. 9), large genetic and morphometric distances (appendices 3, 4), and salient qualitative differences (table 6).\n\nBy contrast, Philander quica and P. opossum merit comparison because they are externally similar (with uniformly grayish dorsal fur and mostly self-colored ventral fur) and might eventually be found to occur sympatrically in eastern Brazil (see above). Although same-sex univariate comparisons (table 9) reveal some overlap in all measured craniodental dimensions, principal-components analysis indicates that these species have discrete multivariate distributions (fig. 15A). Because the axis of species discrimination is approximately perpendicular to the more or less parallel axes of within-species variation, and because these axes are oblique to PC1 and PC2, we computed size and size-independent shape factors to obtain vectors with more interpretable coefficients (fig. 15B; table 10). The latter suggest that, independent of general-size allometries, P. opossum has longer but narrower nasals, a longer palate, and much larger molars than P. quica.\n\nDifferences in nasal shape between Philander quica and P. opossum are subtle but useful for visual identification of skulls: expressed as a percentage, the ratio NB/NL is about 25% on average in P. quica versus about 22% in P. opossum. Additionally, the shorter/broader nasals of P. quica never extend posteriorly to or between the postorbital processes, whereas the longer nasals of P. opossum often (in about two-thirds of examined specimens) extend to or between the postorbital processes. Whereas P. quica always has an incomplete labial cingulum on P3 (fig. 14B), the labial cingulum of P3 is narrowly complete (ending along the entire base of the tooth when unworn) in about 28% of examined specimens of P. opossum. Externally, P. opossum has better-defined preauricular spots and more saturated (consistently buffy) underparts than P. quica (which usually has whitish or yellowish ventral fur), and P. opossum tends to have a more extensively white-tipped tail (over half the specimens we examined have tails that are about ⅔ white) than P. quica (in which most specimens have tails that are ≤ ½ white). In side-by-side comparisons, the furred basal portion of the tail is visibly longer in P. opossum than in P. quica; unfortunately, this trait is difficult to quantify due to the absence of a definite anterior landmark for relevant measurements.\n\nRemarks: Most recent authors have used the binomen Philander frenatus for this species following Patton and da Silva (1997), but the holotype of frenatus was collected in eastern Amazonia, and we treat that name as a junior synonym of P. opossum (see appendix 5).\n\nHershkovitz (1997) used the trinomen Philander opossum quica for material that we refer to P. quica, P. canus, and P. pebas. He mapped the range of P. o. quica as including much of the Cerrado, Pantanal, and western Amazonia, but none of his material from Peru, Bolivia, or central Brazil corresponds to P. quica as recognized in this report. Hershkovitz (1997) regarded Didelphis myosuros Temminck, 1824, as a synonym of P. o. quica and designated a lectotype for this purpose, but his lectotype designation is invalid because Pohle (1927) had previously designated a lectotype for D. myosuros, which is currently recognized (e.g., by Gardner and Dagosto, 2008) as a subspecies of Metachirus nudicaudatus (Geoffroy, 1803).\n\nAccording to Patton and da Silva (1997) this species—which they called Philander frenatus (see above)—occurs in the Brazilian state of Goiás, but they did not list any examined specimens from Goiás, and all the specimens of Philander that we examined from that state are unambiguously referable to P. canus (see below). Subsequently, Patton and da Silva (2008) mapped the range of P. “frenatus” as extending to the Chaco biome in the Argentinian province of Formosa, but the marginal record in question is based on AMNH 256980, a juvenile specimen that we reidentified as P. canus.\n\nThe status and relationships of Thomas's azaricus has long been unsettled. Whereas Cabrera (1958) and Patton and da Silva (1997) treated this nominal taxon as a valid subspecies of P. opossum, Hershkovitz (1997) assigned it to the synonymy of P. o. quica, and Patton and da Silva (2008) included it in their synonymy for P. frenatus. Recently, Chemisquy and Flores (2012) analyzed a cytochrome-b sequence from a topotype of azaricus and found that it belonged to the Atlantic Forest haplotype group that they called P. frenatus. We examined the type series of azaricus and an additional 13 topotypes for this report; all of these specimens (21 in total) are unambiguously assignable to P. quica, exhibiting the craniodental traits of that species as diagnosed above.\n\nThe identity of Didelphys superciliaris Olfers, 1818, which Patton and da Silva (1997, 2008) listed as a synonym of Philander frenatus, cannot now be determined. Both epithets were first published as nomina nuda by Illiger (1815), but their availability dates from Olfers (1818), who based his descriptions on material that he examined in Berlin (see appendix 5). However, whereas the application of frenatus can now be established based on an extant holotype, no type material of superciliaris is known to survive. Because the collections that Olfers examined in Berlin included specimens collected in both eastern Amazonia and southeastern Brazil, (Voss and Angermann, 1997; see also appendix 5), the lost type of superciliaris could have come from either place: if from the former region, the name would be a junior synonym of P. opossum; if from the latter, then it would be a senior synonym of P. quica. Because superciliaris has not, to our knowledge, been recognized as a valid taxon for almost two centuries, it would seem pointless to use this name to replace quica, the application of which is undisputed. Therefore, to fix the application of Didelphys superciliaris Olfers for the species that occurs in eastern Amazonia, we select as neotype a specimen in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 203348) consisting of the skin and skull of an adult male collected by personnel from the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz on 6 December 1960 near “Capim” (= São Domingos do Capim; 1°40´S, 47°47´W; Paynter and Traylor, 1991) at Km 92 on highway BR 14, Para, Brazil.\n\nHabitats: Within the Atlantic Forest biome or ecoregion (Mata Atlântica), Philander quica seems to be eurytopic, occurring in a wide range of vegetation types including mature lowland rainforest (formerly the dominant climax vegetation of southeastern Brazil; Por, 1992), submontane forest, secondary growth, agricultural fields, and coastal restinga scrub (Cerqueira et al., 1993; Bergallo, 1994; Bonvicino et al., 1997; Passamani et al., 2000; D'Andrea et al., 2007).\n\nSpecimens Examined (N = 66): Brazil—Espírito Santo, Engenheiro Reeve (BMNH 3.9.4.110); Minas Gerais, Serra de Caparaó (AMNH 8052–8053, 61851–61853); Paraná, Parque Nacional do Iguaçu (MVZ 197401), Roca Nova (BMNH 3.7.1.108–3.7.1.110); Rio de Janeiro, Barreira (ZMB 38069, 38072, 38073, 38076, 38091), Rio de Janeiro (AMNH 133106, 133107; ZMB 38063), Sepetiba (NMW 7687/ST 1012); Rio Grande do Sul (BMNH 84.2.8.29); Santa Catarina, Hansa (BMNH 29.6.6.71), Jaraguá (NMW B2529), Teresópolis (NMW 1671–1675); São Paulo, Boracéia (MVZ 182777; USNM 460503), Fazenda Intervales (MVZ 182066, 183246, 183247), Iguape (USNM 542920), Ilha de Sebastião (MVZ 182067), Ilha do Cardoso (FMNH 141589, 141590), São Sebastião (BMNH 2.4.6.37–2.4.6.40), Ypanema (NMW 2636, 2638, 2640). Paraguay—Central, “Caroreni Viejo” (not located; ZMB 44285); Paraguarí, Sapucaí (BMNH 2.11.7.14, 2.11.7.48, 3.2.3.32–3.2.3.37 [type series of azaricus]; USNM 121412–121422, 121457, 121458), “Ipitimi” (= Ybytymí; ZMB 91277); San Pedro, Tacuatí (USNM 293133).\n\nType Material: The holotype (by original designation, FMNH 19347) consists of the skin and skull of an adult male collected by W.H. Osgood and M.P. Anderson on 4 August 1912. Although the skin is well preserved, the skull is broken and incomplete (the left zygomatic arch, the left squamosal, and the left bulla are all missing).\n\nDistribution and Sympatry: Sequenced specimens and other examined material that we refer to Philander canus have been collected in central and western Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, eastern Peru, northeastern Colombia, and Venezuela (fig. 9). Although we have not examined specimens from northeastern Peru (Loreto), eastern Ecuador, or southeastern Colombia (Caquetá, Putumayo), future collecting may eventually fill in this geographic hiatus. Philander canus occurs sympatrically with P. andersoni in southern Venezuela (at El Platanal in Amazonas state), with P. mcilhennyi in eastern Peru (e.g., at Balta, in Ucayali department) and western Brazil (at Sobral, in Acre state), and with P. pebas in eastern Peru (e.g., at Balta, in Ucayali department).\n\nDescription: Dorsal pelage short (usually <14 mm) and uniformly grayish, usually without any trace of darker middorsal pigmentation; fur of crown (between the ears) usually grizzled gray; pale preauricular spot often present; ventral fur continuously self-whitish, -cream, or -buffy, at least along the midline, but sometimes with broad lateral zones of graybased hairs; pinnae pale (unpigmented) basally, but blackish distally; dorsal pelage of hind feet usually pale, but sometimes indistinctly darker over lateral metatarsals (never distinctly marked with black); scaly part of tail usually <½ white distally but seldom <¼ white. Nasal bones short (about 46% of condylobasal length on average), never extending posteriorly to or between postorbital processes. Unworn third upper premolar (P3) apparently always with complete labial cingulum extending along entire base of tooth; crown length of upper molar series 13.0 ± 0.4 mm (sexes combined; observed range 12.2–14.1 mm, N = 99); enameled lingual surfaces of upper molars smooth, not crenulated; pre- and postcingula consistently absent; lower molar postcingulids absent.\n\nPhylogeography and Geographic Variation: Our phylogenetic analysis of 32 sequences of Philander canus reveals no comprehensible phylogeographic structure, with haplotypes from northern populations (in Colombia and Venezuela) mixed in among those from central Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina (fig. 16). Uncorrected sequence divergence at the cytochrome-b locus among haplotypes that we assign to P. canus is only about 0.8% despite the very wide geographic dispersion of collecting localities. Although we have not statistically tested for geographic variation in morphology among our samples, this appears to be another phenotypically rather uniform species despite modest sample differences in pelage pigmentation (some populations tending to have self-whitish or -cream underparts, whereas others have self-buffy ventral fur).\n\nComparisons: Morphological comparisons of Philander canus with P. quica have already been described (see above) and comparisons with P. pebas will be described subsequently (see below). It remains to compare this species with members of the P. opossum complex, which—as defined earlier in this report—includes P. opossum, P. andersoni, and P. mcilhennyi.\n\nPhilander canus is superficially similar to P. opossum, with which it has long been associated as a subspecies or synonym (e.g., by Cabrera, 1958; Patton and da Silva, 1997, 2008; Gardner, 2005; Chemisquy and Flores, 2012; Hice and Velazco, 2012). Although the geographic ranges of P. canus and P. opossum are not currently known to come into contact, it seems plausible that these species are sympatric or parapatric in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso, Tocantins, and southern Para, where Cerrado vegetation comes into contact with southeastern Amazonian rainforest. Philander canus is substantially smaller, on average, than P. opossum in several same-sex univariate comparisons (table 11), notably in condylobasal length (CBL), nasal length (NL), least interorbital breadth (LIB), least postorbital breadth (LPB), palatal length (PL), and maxillary toothrow (MTR). Despite some overlap in observed ranges for all dimensions, measured samples of these species have nonoverlapping multivariate distributions (fig. 17), and general-size-adjusted shape coefficients indicate that nasal morphology accounts for much of the observed divergence (table 12). Visual comparisons suggest that the posterior portion of the nasals of P. canus are typically much broader than those of P. opossum, do not extend as far posteriorly, and lack the deep posterolateral notches that are often present in the latter species (fig. 18). Philander canus and P. opossum both have uniformly grayish dorsal fur, mostly pale hind feet, and self-colored ventral fur, but tail pigmentation might be useful for field identification. Whereas the scaly part of the tail is almost always <½ white in specimens of P. canus, the scaly part of the tail is typically ≥½ white in specimens of P. opossum, and this modal difference might be expected to become even more pronounced in sympatry.9\n\nPhilander canus is much smaller, on average, than either P. andersoni or P. mcilhennyi, from which it also differs in nasal shape as described and illustrated above (all members of the P. opossum complex have long, narrow nasals that are often laterally notched and often extend posteriorly to or between the postorbital processes). Large generalized distances (appendix 4) suggest that multivariate ordinations of P. canus with either P. andersoni or P. mcilhennyi would show nonoverlapping distributions, but we have not performed those analyses because these species are easy to tell apart by other characters. The dorsal pelage pigmentation of P. canus (uniformly gray; fig. 10) is quite unlike that of P. andersoni (with a distinctly blackish middorsal stripe) and P. mcilhennyi (some specimens of which are completely blackish). The self-whitish, -cream, or -buffy underparts of P. canus likewise contrast with the mostly gray-based ventral pelage of P. andersoni and the almostblackish ventral fur of P. mcilhennyi (fig. 11). Whereas the hind feet of P. canus are covered dorsally with pale fur, the hind feet of P. andersoni and P. mcilhennyi are either completely blackish or have black metatarsals and abruptly whitish digits. Lastly, the scaly part of the tail is almost always <½ white in P. canus but apparently always ≥½. white in P. andersoni and P. mcilhennyi.\n\nRemarks: As understood herein, Philander canus includes the nominal taxa crucialis, mondolfii, and olrogi. The latter are represented in our molecular analyses by: (1) a CYTB sequence we obtained from a Bolivian specimen (AMNH 260034) that was collected near the type locality of crucialis and that resembles the holotype of crucialis in qualitative and morphometric traits; (2) two CYTB sequences, one from a Colombian specimen (KU 123943) and another from a Venezuelan specimen (KU 120245) that were part of Lew et al.'s (2006) original material of mondolfii; and (3) CYTB sequences that we obtained from two specimens (AMNH 261271, 261272) that were part of Flores et al.'s (2008) original material of olrogi. All these specimens conform to our morphological diagnosis of P. canus, so the conclusion that the nominal taxa in question are conspecific seems straightforward, but brief comments on each synonym are appropriate.\n\nThomas (1923) described crucialis on the basis of a single specimen, which he compared only with azaricus (= P. quica; see above). Later, with more Bolivian material at hand for comparison with topotypical specimens of Osgood's species, he (Thomas, 1928) judged crucialis and canus to be indistinguishable. We agree.\n\nLew et al. (2006) described mondolfii based on several dozen specimens from Colombia and Venezuela that the authors compared carefully with other species of Philander known to occur in or near those countries, including P. andersoni, P. deltae, P. “fuscogriseus” (= P. melanurus), and P. opossum, but they did not compare mondolfii with P. canus. Although we have not examined the holotype or paratypes of mondolfii—all currently inaccessible in Venezuelan museums—we did examine 16 specimens that were part of Lew et al.'s (2006) original material. These specimens (AMNH 16951, 30709, 30711–30714, 133119, 133120, 136163, 136167–136169, 139221; KU 120233, 120245, 123943) so closely resemble the type of P. canus and other referred material from eastern Peru that we could not find any phenotypic basis for retaining mondolfii even as a subspecies.\n\nFlores et al. (2008) described olrogi on the basis of seven specimens from Bolivia and Peru. Although we have not seen the holotype, we examined the skull of a paratype (AMNH 246441) as well as several other specimens that were part of Flores et al.'s (2008) original material (AMNH 261269–261272). Despite careful study, we confess ourselves unable to consistently distinguish these specimens from material that the authors referred to P. opossum canus. Although they reported a principal-components analysis that was said to support the recognition of olrogi as a distinct taxon, canus and olrogi have overlapping distributions in their illustrated results (Flores et al., 2008: fig. 5). In the absence of compelling evidence for the phenotypic distinctness of these genetically indistinguishable nominal taxa, we interpret the allegedly diagnostic traits of olrogi to be aspects of intraspecific morphological variation within P. canus.\n\nCabrera (1958: 35) listed nigratus as a synonym of canus (which he ranked as a subspecies of P. opossum), but the holotype (BMNH 0.7.7.62) and other material that we refer to nigratus10 are larger animals (LM = 14.7–16.4 mm) with much darker dorsal fur, completely gray-based ventral fur, blackish feet, shorter white tail-tips (less than ¼ of the tail is unpigmented in most specimens), and an incomplete labial cingulum on P3. Although we do not know whether nigratus is a valid species, its phenotype more closely resembles those of species in the P. opossum complex than that of P. canus.\n\nHershkovitz (1997) used the name Philander opossum quica for many specimens that we refer to P. canus, including all the material he listed from central Brazil (Goiás, Mato Grosso) and Bolivia; among the material that he listed from eastern Peru are specimens that we refer to both P. canus and P. pebas. The “dichromatism” that he (Hershkovitz, 1997: 49) noted among specimens of “P. o. quica” from Balta (in the Peruvian department of Ucayali) is the result of sympatry rather than polymorphism: of the six specimens in question that we examined, three (LSUMZ 12006, 12008, 12009) are P. canus and the others (LSUMZ 12007, 12010, 14011) are P. pebas (see Specimens Examined for both taxa, below; a third congener, P. mcilhennyi, also occurs at Balta).\n\nThe western Amazonian specimens that Patton et al. (2000) referred to Philander opossum canus include examples of both P. canus and P. pebas. Of the five that we were able to examine— the others having been returned to Brazil—four (MVZ 190343–190346) are P. pebas; only one (MVZ 190347, from the state of Acre, near the Peruvian border) is actually P. canus. The central Amazonian specimens that Nunes et al. (2006) identified as P. canus are also examples of P. pebas.11 The only other material of P. canus that we have seen from the Brazilian Amazon (besides the MVZ specimen from Acre) is a small series collected many years ago along the lower Rio Madeira (in Amazonas state) and a single specimen from the upper Madeira (in Rondônia).\n\nHabitats: The geographic range of Philander canus extends over a wide range of biomes or ecoregions (including the Cerrado, Chaco, Pantanal, Llanos, and Amazonia), and it is possible that the species occurs in a corresponding variety of habitats, but definite ecological information associated with collected specimens is hard to find. Other species of Philander are known to live in rainforest, so collection records from biomes dominated by savanna vegetation and/or dry forest (e.g., the Cerrado, Chaco, and Llanos) seem anomalous, but the literature on Cerrado mammals provides a few relevant observations.\n\nIn the Cerrado landscapes of eastern Bolivia, Philander canus is apparently restricted to tall evergreen gallery forests and does not seem to occur in the savannas and dry forests that cover much of the landscape (Emmons et al., 2006). In the Cerrado of central Brazil, P. “opossum” (presumably P. canus) is also said to be a gallery-forest species (Mello and Moojen, 1979; Redford and Fonseca, 1986; Alho, 2005), but in one report of a multiyear trapping study P. “opossum” was said to prefer gallery forest but to occur frequently in other local habitats, including open grassland, shrub savanna, and dry forest (Alho et al., 1986). Following Pulliam's (1988) ecological terminology, we conjecture that gallery forests are probably the source habitat for P. canus in Cerrado landscapes, whereas open formations (including dry forests) are likely to be sink habitats. In the Chaco of northern Argentina, Philander “opossum” (presumably P. canus) is also said to occur in gallery forests (Huck et al., 2017).\n\nInformation about the habitat distribution of Philander canus appears to be unavailable from trapping studies in the Pantanal and Llanos, but we suspect that it is largely restricted to gallery forests in those ecoregions as well. Nevertheless, Lew et al.'s (2006) summary of macrohabitats where Philander “mondolfii” (= P. canus) has been collected in Venezuela (including lowland and submontane rainforest, semideciduous forest, and tree savannas) suggest that it has broad ecological tolerances, at least where other sympatric congeners are not known to occur.\n\nWe have not found any published accounts of where specimens that can definitely be identified as Philander canus have been collected in Amazonia. Although the natural climax vegetation throughout this enormous ecoregion can be broadly characterized as lowland rainforest, local disturbance (e.g., from lateral migration of rivers within their meander belts) and edaphic factors can result in a surprising diversity of natural vegetation types at many Amazonian localities (Pires and Prance, 1985; Puhakka and Kalliola, 1995), and anthropogenic habitats are also scattered throughout the region. The geographic distribution of Amazonian collection localities for P. canus provides no habitat clues, because these localities are not clustered around savanna enclaves, human settlements, or other obvious landscape features. The known Amazonian range of P. canus broadly overlaps those of P. andersoni, P. mcilhennyi, and P. pebas, so it would be reasonable to suppose that competitive interactions with sympatric congeners might restrict the habitat occupancy of this species to some extent, but the information compiled for this report is entirely inadequate even for conjecture.\n\nSpecimens Examined (N = 154): Bolivia—Beni, Arruda (FMNH 114701), Camiaco (AMNH 210402), Casarabe (AMNH 261269–261272; MSB 55854), 8 km N Exaltación (AMNH 210403), Magdalena (FMNH 114714), Mamore River (AMNH 210409), 4 km SE Palacios (210410), Puerto Caballo (AMNH 210411), Puerto Siles (AMNH 210413, 210414), Rio Tijamuchi (AMNH 261273), San Joaquin (FMNH 114685, 114694, 114707); Pando, Bella Vista (MSB 57006, AMNH 262413); Santa Cruz, 7 km E aserradero Moira (EBD 8736), 6 km W Asención (MSB 55855), Ayacucho (USNM 390564), Becerra (390565), 2 km N Chapare River mouth (AMNH 210416), 2 km SE Cotoca (MSB 59887), Estancia Cachuela Esperanza (AMNH 260034, MSB 55073), Hamecas (AMNH 135887), La Laguna (MSB 55856), 3 km SE Montero (AMNH 263964, MSB 67025), Palmar (USNM 390562), San Miguel Rincón (AMNH 260037, MSB 55074, 55075), 10 km N San Ramon (AMNH 261277, 261278), Santa Cruz de la Sierra (BMNH 47.11.22.15 [holotype of crucialis]), 15 km S Santa Cruz (AMNH 263966, MSB 58517), 7 km N Santa Rosa (AMNH 246441 [paratype of olrogi]), near Warnes (USNM 390005, 390009–390012).
