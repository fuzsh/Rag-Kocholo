        "meta_description": "Background Faunal change is a basic and fundamental element in ecology, biogeography, and conservation biology, yet vanishingly few detailed studies have documented such changes rigorously over decadal time scales. This study responds to that gap in knowledge, providing a detailed analysis of Digital Accessible Knowledge of the birds of Mexico, designed to marshal DAK to identify sites that were sampled and inventoried rigorously prior to the beginning of major global climate change (1980). Methods We accumulated DAK records for Mexican birds from all relevant online biodiversity data portals. After extensive cleaning steps, we calculated completeness indices for each 0.05° pixel across the country; we also detected ‘hotspots’ of sampling, and calculated completeness indices for these broader areas as well. Sites were designated as well-sampled if they had completeness indices above 80% and >200 associated DAK records. Results We identified 100 individual pixels and 20 broader ‘hotspots’ of sampling that were demonstrably well-inventoried prior to 1980. These sites are catalogued and documented to promote and enable resurvey efforts that can document events of avifaunal change (and non-change) across the country on decadal time scales. Conclusions Development of repeated surveys for many sites across Mexico, and particularly for sites for which historical surveys document their avifaunas prior to major climate change processes, would pay rich rewards in information about distributional dynamics of Mexican birds.",

        "text": "Data reduction and cleaning\n\nInitial data downloads totaled tens to hundreds of thousands of records from Mexico from each of the data portals, reaching millions from GBIF (although the GBIF numbers are largely from eBird and aVerAves, which come in greatest part from post-1980; Fig. 1, Table 1). We expected considerable redundancy between data sources, in the form of situations in which the same species was collected or recorded at the same place on the same day, so we embarked on a lengthy process of data reduction and cleaning. Without a doubt, some mistakes were made, and some information was lost, but this effort aimed to detect and highlight the major features of Mexican bird DAK, rather than all of the details. That is, we focused on sites that had the most information available, and explicitly excluded information for less-well-known sites.\n\nA first step was to concatenate all four datasets into a single, larger dataset, and to reduce the set of fields to the essential three suites of fields mentioned above: species (we retained order, family, genus, and species, to permit identification of the most difficult names), date collected (year, month, and day), and place (latitude and longitude, when available, and state, municipality, and specific locality). We filtered these records to remove all those records from years after 1980. The initial total of 2,598,478 records distilled to 845,658 (a 67.5% reduction) that both (1) had dates and (2) were not from after 1980.\n\nFrom this set, we extracted 10,762 unique combinations of order, family, genus, and species, which included diverse name combinations, and required considerable work to distill to a consistent suite of names corresponding to the birds of Mexico. We avoided the temptation to attempt to take the taxonomic treatment to a newer authority list (e.g., Gill & Donsker, 2014; Navarro-Sigüenza & Peterson, 2004; Peterson & Navarro-Sigüenza, 2006) because taxonomic splitting, which has dominated recent years of taxonomic work, would cause considerable confusion of names applied to older records. Hence, we reduced the initial, highly redundant set of names to 1,027 names that coincided with the taxonomy of the American Ornithologists’ Union (AOU, 1998), except that we merged Empidonax traillii and E. alnorum, in light of very frequent confusion in identification (Heller et al., 2016). This step was achieved based on long years of experience with Mexican bird taxonomy, plus occasional consultation of the literature (Monroe & Sibley, 1993; Peters, 1931–1987) and online (http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/) resources.\n\nA second step was to summarize date information as a concatenation of year, month, and day (e.g., 1964_7_16). Records with dates for which all three time elements were missing were removed from analysis, but records with partial dates (e.g., year and month, but not day) were treated as a unique time event. All data management was carried out in OpenRefine (http://openrefine.org), which permitted many important initial steps of combining similar names, and in Microsoft Access, which permitted development of customized queries for further refinement.\n\nData analysis\n\nPerhaps the most difficult-to-manage of the fields was that of ‘place.’ Here, we used a three-step process that aimed to retain a maximum of locality information, yet avoid the massive and prohibitive task of full georeferencing of all records for which no geographic coordinates were available. Hence, (1) we used the 502,935 records that had latitude-longitude data in a first-pass analysis that aimed to identify single sites that were well inventoried, and to identify somewhat broader ‘hotspots’ of sampling (details provided below). Next (2), we used locality names associated with the records falling in the hotspots to probe the data lacking georeferences, and thereby rescued >54,000 records. Finally (3), we inspected the remaining data records—those lacking georeferences—to identify additional sites that merited analysis (five such additional, un-georeferenced sites indeed proved to be relatively well-inventoried, such that this step was important; see below). In this way, the number of localities that needed to be georeferenced was minimized, and yet we managed to include the great bulk of Mexican DAK in our analyses.\n\nStep 1: Here, we aimed to develop first analyses of the 502,935 records from the original data set that carried latitude-longitude coordinates, both to identify individual pixels (0.05° resolution) that were well-inventoried, and to identify concentrations (“hotspots”) of sampling that may or may not prove to be well-inventoried. We first filtered this data set to retain only the records that were within 0.05° (5–6 km) of the administrative outline of Mexico—this step left 499,794 (99.4%) records for initial analysis. This initial data set was further reduced to 481,409 (95.7%) that came from 1980 or before.\n\nWe then created a shapefile with square elements of 0.05° for Mexico, and eliminated pixels that were >0.05° from the administrative boundaries of Mexico. We then used a spatial join to count numbers of records in each polygon; numbers of records per cell ranged from nil to as high as 15,464 (a pixel centered on Chilpancingo, Guerrero). We used optimized hot spot analysis (implemented in ArcGIS, version 10.2) to identify concentrations of sampling effort across the country—we used the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic (Hot Spot Analysis tool), and focused only on hotspots (0.05° grid squares) significant at the highest (99%) confidence level. We isolated these well-sampled suites of pixels as a separate shapefile, and then merged pixels in contiguous sets as preliminary hypotheses of broader hotspots of sampling, which we enriched with more records in step 2 (see below).\n\nWe also used the initial data set to develop an identification of single 0.05° pixels that were well-inventoried, as follows. The 481,409 pre-1980 records remaining after clipping to the country boundaries reduced to 277,249 (57.6%) unique combinations of species × date × pixel. We calculated Sobs as the number of species that have been recorded from each pixel, N as the total number of unique combinations of species × date from each pixel (and thus we set a base spatial resolution as that of the 0.05° grid, such that co-occurrences of species within these pixels are assumed to be sympatric), and a and b as the numbers of species recorded exactly once and exactly twice, respectively, from each pixel. We then used these data to calculate, for each pixel, the Chao2 estimator of expected species richness, with its associated adjustment for small sample sizes (Colwell, 1994–present), as (1) S exp = S obs + N − 1 N a a − 1 2 b + 1 . Completeness was then calculated as C = Sobs / Sexp. To avoid including occasional localities with small sample sizes and artificially ‘complete’ inventories, we further removed all pixels for which N < 200. We summarized these calculations in a table, which we then imported into ArcGIS and joined to the grid shapefile for visualization.\n\nStep 2: This step aimed to assess the fairly large portion of the data that lacked georeferences (195,371 records), and ‘rescue’ relevant data for further enrichment of the hotspot analysis. That is, in Step 1, we used georeferenced occurrence data to identify hotspots of sampling, but many more occurrences were documented in records lacking such data. Hence, here, first, we used the merged hotspot shapefile to associate the original occurrence data (i.e., records with georeferences) to hotspots, and identified key locality names among those occurrence data. (e.g., the Comitán hotspot included localities such as “La Trinitaria”, “El Triunfo,” “Lagunas de Montebello,” “Las Margaritas,” and “Santa Rosa”). Finally, we used those names to probe the non-georeferenced data records (checking, of course, that offset distances were not >5 km), and thereby rescued 54,369 records that were added to the hotspot-based analyses. Inventory statistics and completeness values were then recalculated for each hotspot just as they were calculated in Step 1 for each pixel.\n\nStep 3: This final step involved review of the remaining non-georeferenced records, even after the rescue of Step 2. That is, Step 2 focused on non-georeferenced records that corresponded to already-identified pixels and hotspots, and that could be used to enrich the existing (georeferenced) data from those sites. This third step, however, involved a look at the remaining data to see if additional well-known sites could be identified.\n\nWe assembled the raw locality descriptors, and tallied numbers of records associated with each; we did some minor cleaning and synonymizing of minor variants on locality descriptors to maximize numbers of records for each locality. Finally, we developed completeness indices (as described above) for each of the non-georeferenced localities that had a raw sample size (i.e., unique combinations of locality descriptor, year/month/day, and species) of ≥200 records. Because the focus of these exercises is on detecting the few well-inventoried sites, rather than characterizing the overall sampling landscape, no biases are introduced by this rescue step. All localities meeting an arbitrary criterion of completeness, C ≥ 0.8, were then georeferenced and included among well-known sites."
