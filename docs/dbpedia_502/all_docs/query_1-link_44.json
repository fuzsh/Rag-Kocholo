        "text": "September 2024\n\nDo Residents Believe that Onchocerciasis Transmission Was Eliminated? Results of A Post-Treatment Surveillance Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Survey in Three Foci of Uganda\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Lauri Bernard, Annet T. Khainza, Edson Byamukama, Moses Katabarwa, Jenna Coalson, Gregory S. Noland, and Frank O. Richards Jr.\n\nDecription: In Uganda, 15 of 17 foci have interrupted transmission of onchocerciasis (river blindness) and stopped mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. This 2016 study describes the results of a knowledge, attitude, and practices survey regarding river blindness among participants (N = 1,577) 3–5 years after ivermectin MDA was halted in three foci: Imaramagambo halted in 2012, Kashoya-Kitomi in 2013, and Mt. Elgon in 2011. The study showed high levels of composite knowledge (focus-specific range: 66.8–81.2%) related to river blindness transmission, signs, symptoms, and treatment. However, 38.1% of respondents did not know that blackflies transmitted river blindness. Notably, 72.2% claimed they had not been informed why MDA was stopped, 56.3% did not believe river blindness had been eliminated, and 83.1% wanted ivermectin MDA to resume. During the 3–5 year post-treatment surveillance period, only 27.7% (438 of 1,577) reported being informed of what to do once treatments stopped, with the most knowledgeable hailing from the Mt. Elgon focus (47.9%). This study reinforces the need for programs to intensify health education and information dissemination when MDA is stopped. Programs must remind residents that although biting insects may persist, they no longer transmit river blindness. Incorporating messages about the elimination of river blindness into community health education campaigns can help improve the community’s perceptions related to the disease’s absence and the ending of a long-standing MDA intervention.\n\nSeptember 2024\n\nIntegrated Serosurveillance for Onchocerciasis, Lymphatic Filariasis, and Schistosomiasis in North Darfur, Sudan\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Jenna E. Coalson, Gregory S. Noland, Andrew W. Nute, Erica Brook Goodhew, Diana L. Martin, Zeinab Abdalla, Isam Zarroug, Soheir Gabralla, Hassan Ahmed Hassan Ahmed Ismail, William Evan Secor, Elizabeth Kelly Callahan, Angelia M. Sanders, Balgesa Elshafie, and Scott D. Nash\n\nDescription: Sudan is endemic for multiple neglected tropical diseases, including trachoma, onchocerciasis (OV), lymphatic filariasis (LF), and schistosomiasis (SCH). In 2019, dried blood spot samples were collected for a baseline trachoma serosurvey in three localities (El Seraif, Kotom, and Saraf Omrah) in North Darfur State. None were classified previously as OV- or LF-endemic, although low levels of SCH had been identified in all three. Approximately 30 households from 25 communities in each locality were selected by multistage cluster random sampling. Collections of DBSs were analyzed by multiplex bead assay for antibodies to multiple pathogens. This paper presents data on OV (Ov16), LF (Wb123, Bm14, Bm33), and SCH (soluble egg antigen [SEA], Sm25) antibodies among 8,322 individuals from 2,119 households. The survey-adjusted seroprevalence estimates for Ov16 were <0.3% in all localities. Lymphatic filariasis–antigen seroprevalences were discordant. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 4.6–6.0% (Wb123), 0.99–1.4% (Bm14), and 29.2–33.3% (Bm33). Schistosomiasis seroprevalence estimates among school-aged children ranged from 2.7–8.0% (SEA) and 10.9–15.6% (Sm25). Ov16 seropositivity was low and supported the localities’ classification as nonendemic. The results suggested LF exposure, but discordance between antigens, challenges defining seropositivity thresholds, and the absence of programmatic guidance based on antibody serology alone for Wuchereria bancrofti indicate a need for remapping surveys to confirm transmission. Schistosomiasis antibody levels were high enough to warrant further mapping to guide treatment decisions. The lack of gold standards limited interpretation of results, particularly for LF, but in resource-challenged areas, integrated serological surveillance offers the possibility of efficient monitoring of exposure to multiple diseases.\n\nSeptember 2024\n\nScorecard Approach to Eliminate Onchocerciasis in Venezuela\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Oneida Camacho, Carlos Botto, Dalila Ríos, Benny Barrios, Sharly Ceballos, Oscar Noya-Alarcón, Miguel Fernández, Yseliam Tovar, Nestor J. Villamizar, Lindsay Rakers, Frank Richards, and María Eugenia Grillet\n\nDescription: In the Americas, onchocerciasis has been eliminated in 11 of 13 endemic foci by mass administration of ivermectin. The remaining at-risk population resides in a contiguous cross-border transmission zone located in the Amazon jungle in northwest Brazil and southern Venezuela, known as the Yanomami Focus Area. Here, we describe the development and implementation of a data-driven tool, called the Scorecard Approach (SCA), for the 393 communities that comprise the Venezuela South Focus. The SCA was first applied in 2018 and is reassessed on an annual basis. This operational strategy seeks to prioritize communities with low ivermectin coverage while taking into account the nature and variation of other epidemiological and logistical variables. Numeric scores are assigned for each factor and added together to yield a composite score for each community that is categorized as high, medium, or low priority. In this way, the SCA serves as a valuable and comprehensive strategy for planning, monitoring, and maximizing programmatic efficiency. In addition, it has allowed the country to face the main challenges of this endemic area: its remoteness, its large areas of territory to cover, the semi-nomadic nature of the Yanomami people, and their continuous cross-border movements. For 2022, the SCA categorized 54 (13.7%), 108 (27.5%), and 231 (58.8%) communities as high, medium, and low priority, respectively. The results presented here show that prioritizing communities at risk and with greatest needs increases the feasibility of interrupting the transmission of onchocerciasis by 2025 in the last endemic focus in the Americas.\n\nSeptember 2024\n\nProgress Toward Onchocerciasis Elimination in Brazil\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: João Luiz Pereira de Araujo, Dalila Ríos, Maria Eugenia Grillet, Alda Maria da Cruz, Lindsay Rakers, Frank Richards, Heriberto Francis Schuertz, and Sandra Maria Barbosa Durães\n\nDescription: The single onchocerciasis-endemic focus in the remote Amazon rainforest is shared by Brazil and Venezuela and affects primarily the indigenous Yanomami people. Regional elimination of onchocerciasis is challenged by the magnitude and inaccessibility of this area. In Brazil, 272 onchocerciasis-endemic communities are operationally organized through 21 health centers (“polos bases”). Mass drug administration of ivermectin began in 1995, with 36 effective biannual rounds (≥85% coverage of the eligible population) through 2022. The national onchocerciasis program maintains community-level monitoring to prioritize treatment activities and epidemiological surveys. The Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas and the WHO onchocerciasis elimination guidelines have helped Brazil move toward its goal of stopping ivermectin treatment by 2025 and verifying transmission elimination by 2030. Additional challenges to the Brazilian onchocerciasis program include cross-border movements and insecurity due to illegal mining and inter-community conflicts. The new government in Brazil offers hope given its commitment to the equity of indigenous people and preservation of the Amazon environment.\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nThe Interruption of Transmission of Onchocerciasis in Abia, Anambra, Enugu, and Imo States, Nigeria: The Largest Global Onchocerciasis Stop-Treatment Decision to Date\n\nPublished by Pathogens. Authors: Cephas Ityonzughul, Adamu Sallau, Emmanuel Miri, Emmanuel Emukah, Barminas Kahansim, Solomon Adelamo, George Chiedo, Samuel Ifeanyichukwu, Jenna E. Coalson, Lindsay Rakers, Emily Griswold, Chukwuemeka Makata, Fatai Oyediran, Stella Osuji, Solomon Offor, Emmanuel Obikwelu, Ifeoma Otiji, Frank O. Richards Jr., Gregory S. Noland Abstract: Onchocerciasis causes severe morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. Abia, Anambra, Enugu, and Imo states of Nigeria were historically classified meso- or hyperendemic and eligible for ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA). After ≥25 years of annual and biannual MDA, serological and entomological assessments were conducted to determine if Onchocerca volvulus transmission was interrupted. Dried blood spots collected in October 2020 from ≥3167 children 5–9 years old in each state were screened for O. volvulus-specific Ov16 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, 52,187 Simulium damnosum heads (≥8845 per state) collected over 12 months between 2021 and 2022 were tested by pooled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for O-150 DNA. Among seven seropositive children, four were found for follow-up skin snip PCR to confirm active infection. Three were negative and the fourth was excluded as he was visiting from an endemic state. The final seroprevalence estimates of each state had 95% upper confidence limits (UCL) < 0.1%. All fly pools were negative by O-150 PCR, giving a 95% UCL infective fly prevalence < 0.05% in each state. Each state therefore met the World Health Organization epidemiological and entomological criteria for stopping MDA effective January 2023. With 18.9 million residents eligible for MDA, this marked the largest global onchocerciasis stop-treatment decision to date.\n\nOct. 4, 2023\n\nA Tribute to the Global Health Legacy of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter (PDF)\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; 109(4), 2023, pp. 713–714 doi:10.4269/ajtmh.23-0641.\n\nAuthors: Kashef Ijaz and Julie Jacobson.\n\nAbstract: The global public health legacy of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Rosalynn Carter cannot be overstated. For more than 50 years, they have leveraged the power of their characters and connections to advance public health in the United States and around the world.\n\nMay 2023\n\nOnchocerciasis in Nigeria 1: History of Control Efforts (PDF)\n\nPublished by the Nigerian Journal of Parasitology, Special Issue No. 1, May 2023.\n\nAuthors: B. E. B. Nwoke, Nse Akpan, Vitaliano Cama, Uwem Ekpo, Alamveabee Idyorough, Margaret A. Mafe, Hayward Mafuyai, Emeka Makata, Emmanuel Miri, Kenneth Opara, and Frank O. Richards.\n\nNigeria is the most endemic country for onchocerciasis in the world and accounts for about 40% of the global cases. With about 50 million persons in over 40,000 communities at risk, it has been recognized as a communicable disease that is not only a social problem but also a major threat to productivity and the economy of the country. It is especially prevalent among the poor rural farmers, ‘‘people at the end of the road’’ living around the vector breeding sites who produce the bulk of our food and industrial raw materials.\n\nNov. 30, 2022\n\nTwo Nigerian States (Plateau and Nasarawa) Have Eliminated Transmission of Human Onchocerciasis—A Report of Post-ivermectin Mass Drug Administration Surveillance\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; 108(1), 2022, pp. 37–40 doi:10.4269/ajtmh.22-0491.\n\nAuthors: Emmanuel S. Miri, Abel Eigege, Barminas Kahansim, Kenrick Nwodu, Yohana Sambo, Bulus Mancha, Solomon Adelamo, John Umaru, Jonathan Kadimbo, Jacob Danboyi, Hayward Mafuyai, Emeka Makata, Nse Akpan, Joel Akilah, Michael Igbe, Jenna Coalson, Lindsay Rakers, Emily Griswold, Thomas R. Unnasch, B. E. B. Nwoke, Gregory S. Noland, and Frank O. Richards, Jr.\n\nTransmission of Onchocerca volvulus (causing “river blindness”) was interrupted in two states of Nigeria (Plateau and Nasarawa) in 2017 in accordance with 2016 WHO guidelines. Ivermectin mass drug administration was halted in January 2018, and posttreatment surveillance activities were conducted over a 3-year period. Vector Simulium damnosum s.l. flies were collected during the 2019 (39 sites) and 2020 (42 sites) transmission seasons.\n\nJune 24, 2021\n\nReaching the Criteria to Stop Onchocerciasis Mass Drug Administration: Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda Pave the Way (PDF)\n\nPublished by USAID’s Act to End NTDs | East program, led by RTI International, as part of the Act to End NTDs | East Technical Brief Series.\n\nAuthors: Upendo Mwingira (RTI International); Alyssa Jordan (RTI International), Moses Katabarwa (The Carter Center), Frank Richards (The Carter Center)\n\nThis brief describes how Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda addressed these steps, providing examples for other country programs working to stop OV MDA. To eliminate human onchocerciasis transmission of the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus (OV), endemic countries undertake a multi-step process. One of the most challenging steps for endemic countries is breaking the cycle of transmission to the point where MDA can be stopped. This special publication and accompanying toolbox were launch during an expert virtual event (PDF) on June 24, 2021.\n\nJan. 11, 2021\n\nOptimization Of Slash And Clear Community-Directed Control Of Simulium Damnosum Sensu Stricto In Northern Uganda\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Benjamin Jacob, Denis Loum, Denis Munu, Thomson Lakwo, Edson Byamukama, Peace Habomugisha, Eddie W. Cupp, and Thomas R. Unnasch\n\nOnchocerciasis, caused by infection with Onchocerca volvulus, has been targeted for elimination by 2030. Currently, onchocerciasis elimination programs rely primarily on mass distribution of ivermectin. However, ivermectin alone may not be sufficient to achieve elimination in some circumstances, and additional tools may be needed. Vector control has been used as a tool to control onchocerciasis, but vector control using insecticides is expensive and ecologically detrimental.\n\nSept. 21, 2020\n\nAssessing Hypoendemic Onchocerciasis in Loa loa Endemic Areas of Southeast Nigeria\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Lindsay J. Rakers, Emmanuel Emukah, Barminas Kahansim, Bertram E. B. Nwoke, Emmanuel S. Miri, Emily Griswold, Emmanuel Davies, Cephas Ityonzughul, Chukwuma Anyaike, Perpetual Agbi and Frank O. Richards\n\nThe parasitic infection onchocerciasis has a devastating impact on quality of life. Spread by repeated bites of black flies of Simulium species, Onchocerca volvulus larvae can mature into adult worms that group together to form nodules under the skin, from which fertilized females release embryos (microfilariae, or “mf”), which cause eye disease that can lead to blindness and skin disease with maddening itching. Because the black fly vector breeds near well-oxygenated fast-flowing water, the disease is often colloquially referred to as “river blindness.” Nigeria has the greatest number of onchocerciasis cases among the 31 endemic countries.\n\nAug. 10, 2020\n\nElimination of Simulium neavei-Transmitted Onchocerciasis in Wambabya-Rwamarongo Focus of Western Uganda\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Moses N Katabarwa, Peace Habomugisha, Annet Khainza, David Oguttu, Edson Byamukama, James Katamanywa, Thomson Isingooma, Fredrick Bwenume, Christine Nahabwe, Monica Ngabirano, Paul Akampurira, Lauri Bernard, Thomas R Unnasch, Frank Richards\n\nWambabya-Rwamarongo onchocerciasis focus is one of the eight foci Uganda verified using the WHO verification guidelines. The approach for elimination was twice yearly treatment with ivermectin for every round, treating at least 90% of all the eligible population. This was in combination with vector elimination using Abate® since elimination nationwide policy was launched.\n\nMarch 30, 2020\n\nHistorical Elimination of Onchocerciasis from Victoria Nile Focus in Central Uganda Verified Using WHO Criteria\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; 102(6): 1411–1416. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.20-0064\n\nAuthors: Moses N Katabarwa; Peace Habomugisha; Annet Khainza; David Oguttu ; Edson Byamukama; James Katamanywa; Christine Nahabwe; Monica Ngabirano; Paul Akampurira; Lauri Bernard; Thomas R Unnasch; and Frank Richards.\n\nUganda has verified elimination of seven onchocerciasis foci since 2007 when the nationwide onchocerciasis elimination policy was launched. However, the Victoria Nile focus (which was eliminated in the early 1970s) had not been verified. The objective of this study was to verify this focus to the WHO verification guidelines and bring it in line with recently eliminated foci. Vector control with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was the main intervention used at the Victoria Nile from the 1950s to the 1970s. Historical fly collection sites along River Nile were identified for recent fly collection.\n\nMarch 30, 2020\n\nPost-Treatment Surveillance for Lymphatic Filariasis in Plateau and Nasarawa States, Nigeria: Results of Transmission Assessment Surveys\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; 102(6): 1404–1410. doi:10.4269/ajtmh.20-0020\n\nAuthors: Abel Eigege, Gregory S. Noland , Solomon E. Adelamo, Kenrick Nwodu ,Adamu Sallau , John Umaru, Bulus S. Mancha, Emmanuel Davies, Jacob Danboyi, Jonathan A. Kadimbo , Yisa A. Saka, Ifeoma Anagbogu, Emmanuel S. Miri. and Frank O. Richards Jr.\n\nFollowing the halt of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis (LF), the WHO recommends at least 4 years of post-treatment surveillance (PTS) to confirm that transmission recrudescence or importation does not occur. The primary means of evaluation during PTS is repeated transmission assessment surveys (TASs) conducted at 2- to 3-year intervals after TAS-1 stop-MDA surveys. This study reports the results of TAS-2 and TAS-3 surveys in Plateau and Nasarawa states (pop. 6.9 million) of Nigeria divided into a minimum of seven evaluation units (EUs) per TAS.\n\nMarch 6, 2020Data-driven Modelling and Spatial Complexity Supports Heterogeneity Based Integrative Management for Eliminating Simulium Neavei Transmitted River Blindness (PDF)\n\nPublished by Nature Research Scientific Reports.\n\nAuthors: Edwin Michael, Morgan E. Smith, Brajendra K. Singh, Moses N. Katabarwa, Edson Byamukama, Peace Habomugisha, Thomson Lakwo, Edridah Tukahebwa, and Frank O. Richards\n\nConcern is emerging regarding the challenges posed by spatial complexity for modelling and managing the area-wide elimination of parasitic infections. While this has led to calls for applying heterogeneity-based approaches for addressing this complexity, questions related to spatial scale, the discovery of locally-relevant models, and its interaction with options for interrupting parasite transmission remain to be resolved.\n\nMarch 2020The Interruption of Transmission of Human Onchocerciasis by an Annual Mass Drug Administration Program in Plateau and Nasarawa States, Nigeria (PDF)\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Frank O. Richards, Jr., Abel Eigege, John Umaru, Barminas Kahansim, Solomon Adelamo, Jonathan Kadimbo, Jacob Danboyi, Hayward Mafuyai, Yisa Saka, Gregory S. Noland, Chukwuma Anyaike, Michael Igbe, Lindsay Rakers, Emily Griswold, Thomas R. Unnasch, B. E. B. Nwoke, and Emmanuel Miri\n\nPlateau and Nasarawa states in central Nigeria were endemic for onchocerciasis. The rural populations of these two states received annual ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) for a period of 8–26 years (1992–2017). Ivermectin combined with albendazole was given for 8–13 of these years for lymphatic filariasis (LF); the LF MDA program successfully concluded in 2012, but ivermectin MDA continued in areas known to have a baseline meso-hyperendemic onchocerciasis. In 2017, serological and entomological assessments were undertaken to determine if MDA for onchocerciasis could be stopped in accordance with the current WHO guidelines.\n\nFeb 6, 2020\n\nThe Galabat-Metema Cross-border Onchocerciasis Focus: The First Coordinated Interruption of Onchocerciasis Transmission in Africa\n\nPublished by PLOS | Neglected Tropical Diseases.\n\nAuthors: Moses N.

Smith, Shakir Bilal, Thomson L. Lakwo, Peace Habomugisha, Edridah Tukahebwa, Edson Byamukama, Moses N. Katabarwa, Frank O. Richards, EddieW. Cupp, Thomas R. Unnasch & Edwin Michael\n\nAttention is increasingly focusing on how best to accelerate progress toward meeting the WHO’s 2030 goals for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). For river blindness, a major NTD targeted for elimination, there is a long history of using vector control to suppress transmission, but traditional larvicide-based approaches are limited in their utility. One innovative and sustainable approach, “slash and clear,” involves clearing vegetation from breeding areas, and recent field trials indicate that this technique very efectively reduces the biting density of Simulium damnosum s.s.\n\nJuly 15, 2019\n\nCommentary 1: The Positive Influence the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas Has Had on Africa Programs\n\nPublished by Infectious Diseases of Poverty.\n\nAuthors: Frank O.

Higazi, David Oguttu, Zerihun Tadesse, Emmanuel Miri, Nabil Aziz, Peace Habomugisha and Moses Katabarwa.\n\nA recent article \"Is onchocerciasis elimination in Africa feasible by 2025: a perspective based on lessons learnt from the African control programmes\" in Infectious Diseases of Poverty claimed that undue influence on African programs by concepts developed by the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program of the Americas (OEPA) is detrimental to stopping mass drug administration (MDA) in Africa. This claim is made despite a record year for MDA stoppage in four African countries of > 3.5 million treatments in 2018, far exceeding any past OEPA or African Program for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) stop MDA success.\n\nMay 2019Comparison of Reported and Survey-based Coverage in Onchocerciasis Programs over a Period of Eight Years in Cameroon and Uganda (PDF)\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Moses N. Katabarwa, Emily Griswold, Peace Habomugisha, Albert Eyamba, Edson Byamukama, Philippe Nwane, Annet Khainza, Lauri Bernard, Paul Weiss, and Frank O. Richards\n\nMass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin must reach a high treatment coverage (90% of the eligible population) if onchocerciasis is to be eliminated. Questions have been raised as to whether reported treatment figures reaching such high coverage are reliable. Sample surveys are proposed as the method of choice for “validating” reported coverage figures. The purpose of this study was to compare the district-level MDA coverage reported by programs with contemporaneous surveys of randomly selected respondents living in those same districts.\n\nNov. 19, 2018Substantiating Freedom from Parasitic Infection by Combining Transmission Model Predictions with Disease Surveys (PDF)\n\nPublished by Nature Communications.\n\nAuthors: Edwin Michael, Morgan E.

Richards\n\nStopping interventions is a critical decision for parasite elimination programs. Quantifying the probability that elimination has occurred due to interventions can be facilitated by combining infection status information from parasitological surveys with extinction thresholds predicted by parasite transmission models. Here we demonstrate how the integrated use of these two pieces of information derived from infection monitoring data can be used to develop an analytic framework for guiding the making of defensible decisions to stop interventions.\n\nCommentary 2: Elimination of Onchocerciasis in Africa by 2025: The Need for a Broad Perspective\n\nPublished by Infectious Diseases of Poverty.\n\nAuthors: Ed Cupp, Mauricio Sauerbrey, Vitaliano Cama, Mark Eberhard, Patrick J.

Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease targeted for elimination. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidelines for the verification of onchocerciasis elimination that include entomological and epidemiological criteria. The latter require demonstrating with statistical confidence that the infection prevalence in children is less than 0.1%, necessitating an assay with a high degree of specificity. We present an analysis of the performance of the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA) version of the Ov16 ELISA when used under operational conditions.\n\nAug. 27, 2018Community-directed Vector Control to Supplement Mass Drug Distribution for Onchocerciasis Elimination in the Madi Mid-North Focus of Northern Uganda (PDF)\n\nPublished by PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.\n\nAuthors: Benjamin G. Jacob, Denis Loum, Thomson L. Lakwo, Charles R. Katholi, Peace Habomugisha, Edson Byamukama, Edridah Tukahebwa, Eddie W. Cupp, Thomas R. Unnasch\n\nOnchocerciasis a neglected tropical disease that historically has been a major cause of morbidity and an obstacle to economic development in the developing world. It is caused by infection with Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted by black flies of the genus Simulium. The discovery of the potent effect of Mectizan (ivermectin) on O. volvulus microfilariae and the decision by its manufacturer to donate the drug for onchocerciasis spurred the implementation of international programs to control and, more recently, eliminate this scourge.\n\nJune 21, 2018Evaluation of Treatment Coverage and Enhanced Mass Drug Administration for Onchocerciasis and Lymphatic Filariasis in Five Local Government Areas Treating Twice Per Year in Edo State, Nigeria (PDF)\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Emily Griswold, Abel Eigege, Cephas Ityonzughul, Emmanuel Emukah, Emmanuel S. Miri, Ifeoma Anagbogu, Yisa A. Saka, Saliu Kadiri, Solomon Adelamo, Paul Ugbadamu, Clement Ikogho, and Frank O. Richards\n\nThe western region of Edo state in southern Nigeria is highly endemic for onchocerciasis. Despite years of mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin (IVM), reports suggest persistently high prevalence of onchocerciasis, presumably because of poor coverage. In 2016, twice-per-year treatment with IVM (combined with albendazole for lymphatic filariasis in the first round where needed) began in five local government areas of Edo state. We undertook a multistage cluster survey within 3 months after each round of MDA to assess coverage.\n\nMay 10, 2018In Southern Nigeria Loa Loa Blood Microfilaria Density is Very Low Even in Areas with High Prevalence of Loiasis: Results of a Survey Using the New LoaScope Technology (PDF)\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Emmanuel Emukah, Lindsay J.

In a district in Cameroon where L. loa infection is highly endemic, more than 16,000 participants were tested with the LoaScope; testing led to the identification of 340 persons at high risk for serious adverse events and their exclusion from ivermectin treatment. Proper use of the LoaScope cell-phone device can help avoid adverse reactions to ivermectin in areas where Loa loa infection is known to exist.\n\nOct. 11, 2017Evaluation of Community-directed Operation of Black Fly Traps for Entomological Surveillance of Onchocerca Volvulus Transmission in the Madi-Mid North Focus of Onchocerciasis in Northern Uganda (PDF)\n\nPublished by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nAuthors: Denis Loum, Charles R.

The launch of this collection coincides with the 41st anniversary of one of the most successful Private-Public-Partnership for health in Africa and describes all facets of the successes leading to the effective control of river blindness: partnerships, funding, distribution strategies, monitoring and evaluation, lessons learned, and advocacy. This partnership is unique in the involvement of a broad range of financial, scientific, and operational partners, with crucial roles played by a private sector drug donation and by a network of 15 NGOs.\n\nOver the past two decades, these factors have been replicated and other companies have initiated donation programs of drugs to support other control and elimination efforts for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). OCP and APOC have been so successful that blindness caused by onchocerciasis is no longer a public health problem in most of the countries. The Partnership now reaches more than 100 million people annually across Africa to control the disease. Today, billions are treated worldwide for NTDs and even larger partnerships have formed to improve collaboration and to ensure that the world's poorest populations have access to medicines for NTDs and strengthened health systems to improve health and fight poverty.\n\n40 Years of the APOC Partnership (PDF)\n\ninfo:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003562\n\nAuthors: Jean-Baptist Roungou, Laurent Yameogo, Chris Mwikisa, Daniel A.

Where the infections are co-endemic, ivermectin treatments cannot be stopped until both infection transmission cycles are broken. This report follows a previous determination that the LF transmission cycle had been interrupted in five districts (LGAs in Nigeria) but evidence was needed on the status of the onchocerciasis transmission cycle prior to halting MDA.\n\nApril 24, 2014\n\nTwice-Yearly Ivermectin for Onchocerciasis: The Time is Now\n\nPublished by The Lancet Infectious Diseases.\n\nAuthors: Moses Katabarwa, Frank Richards.\n\nThe evidence for successful interruption of onchocerciasis transmission from the Americas, and Sudan and Uganda in Africa, provides clear justification for African onchocerciasis programmes to move rapidly from annual to twice-yearly treatment with ivermectin, at least in some areas. At a minimum, twice-yearly dosing should be instituted where annual mass drug administration has not interrupted transmission after 10 years, or in new areas that have never been treated with ivermectin so as to hasten interruption of transmission. These minimum standards are in line with the new policies of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control for onchocerciasis elimination with several African countries (including Nigeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Sudan) having stated a goal of eliminating the disease by 2020.\n\nApril 4, 2014\n\nThe impact of Merowe Dam on Simulium hamedense vector of onchocerciasis in Abu Hamed focus - Northern Sudan\n\nPublished by Parasites & Vectors, doi:10.1186/1756-3305-7-168.\n\nAuthors: Isam MA Zarroug, Arwa H Elaagip, Sara A Abuelmaali, Hanan A Mohamed, Wigdan A ElMubarak, Kamal Hashim, Tong Chor M Deran, Nabil Aziz, and Tarig B Higazi.\n\nAbu Hamed, the northernmost onchocerciasis focus in the world, is located along the River Nile banks in the Nubian Desert. Merowe Dam, the largest hydropower project in Africa, was built west of Abu Hamed focus in 2009. The impact of the Dam on onchocerciasis and its black fly vectors in Abu Hamed focus was measured in this study. The artificial lake of the Dam flooded all the breeding sites in the western region of the focus and no aquatic stages and/or adult black fly activity were established in the study area upstream of the Dam. The Dam seems to have positive impact on onchocerciasis and its black fly vectors in Abu Hamed focus.\n\nApril 1, 2014\n\nThe Disappearance of Onchocerciasis Without Intervention in Tigray Region in Northwest Ethiopia\n\nPublished by Pathogens and Global Health.\n\nAuthors: M.

In a study conducted in 1981 showed that onchocerciasis was endemic in the villages of Baaker, Bewal, Heligen, Umhager, and Humera town of Kafta Humera District in Mi'irabawi Zone of Tigray Region, northwestern Ethiopia. Compared to the baseline survey conducted 28 years previously, nodule prevalence among adults had decreased from 2.0% to 1%, and microfilaria rate from 24.6% to 0% (P < 0.0001). In children, no nodules were observed, and microfilaria prevalence was 0% (compared to 2.8% in 1981, P < 0.05). Absence of infection in adults and children indicated that onchocerciasis transmission had disappeared without MDA or entomological intervention.\n\nMarch 31, 2014\n\nTransmission of Onchocerca Volvulus by Simulium Neavei in Mount Elgon Focus of Eastern Uganda Has Been Interrupted (PDF)\n\nPublished by the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 2014 doi:10.4269/ajtmh.13-0501.\n\nAuthors: Moses Katabarwa,* Tom Lakwo, Peace Habomugisha, Stella Agunyo, Edson Byamukama, David Oguttu, Richard Ndyomugyenyi, Ephraim Tukesiga, Galex Orukan Ochieng, Francis Abwaimo, Ambrose Onapa, Dennis W.

Follow-up assessments which took place in 2005, 2006, and 2011 consisted of skin snips for microfilariae (mf) and palpation examinations for nodules.\n\nJan. 3, 2013\n\nDisease Eradication\n\nPublished by the New England Journal of Medicine, Vol 368 No. 1.pp. 53-64. Doi:10.1056/NEJMra1200391\n\nAuthor: Donald R. Hopkins.\n\nSince the last case of naturally-occurring smallpox in 1977, there have been three major international conferences devoted to the concept of disease eradication. Several other diseases have been considered as potential candidates for eradication, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has targeted only two other diseases for global eradication after smallpox. In 1986, WHO's policy-making body, the World Health Assembly, adopted the elimination of dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) as a global goal, and it declared eradication of poliomyelitis a global goal in 1988. Although both diseases now appear to be close to eradication, the fact that neither goal has been achieved after more than two decades, and several years beyond the initial target dates for their eradication, underscores the daunting challenge of such efforts, as does the failure of previous attempts to eradicate malaria, hookworm, yaws and other diseases. \"Disease Eradication\" was published as part one of \"A Global View of Health – An Unfolding Series.\"Read the overview of the series >\n\nJuly 6, 2012\n\nTransmission of Onchocerciasis in Wadelai Focus of Northwestern Uganda Has Been Interrupted and the Disease Eliminated (PDF)\n\nPublished byt the Journal of Parasitology Research,volume 2012 (2012), article ID 748540, 7 pages.

In the Americas, the initial focus on elimination of ocular morbidity has shifted to interruption of transmission, and the program has refined both the process leading up to interruption of transmission as well as the critical period following cessation of mass drug administration to document that there is no recrudescence of transmission.\n\nFeb. 1, 2012\n\nLymphatic filariasis in western Ethiopia with special emphasis on prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti antigenaemia in and around onchocerciasis endemic areas\n\nPublished by Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg.

The African Program for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) joined The Carter Center in supporting North Cameroon from 1998 to 2003. APOC was designed to substantially financially support delivery of an annual dose of ivermectin through community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) for 5 years. The objective was to establish a mechanism for sustained delivery of an annual dose of ivermectin, thereby achieving reduction of prevalence and transmission to a point where onchocerciasis would no longer be of public health or socioeconomic concern.\n\nDec. 1, 2011\n\nCost-Effectiveness of Triple Drug Administration (TDA) With Praziquantel, Ivermectin and Albendazole For the Prevention of Neglected Tropical Diseases in Nigeria\n\nPublished by the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, 105(8).

Annual mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin (for onchocerciasis), albendazole (for STH and with ivermectin for LF) and praziquantel (for schistosomiasis) is the WHO-recommended treatment strategy for preventive chemotherapy. Separate delivery rounds for distribution of these drugs have been the usual approach to MDA. All three drugs, however, have now been shown to be clinically and programmatically safe for co-administration with what has come to be known as triple drug administration (TDA). We examined the cost savings of converting from separate delivery rounds to TDA in two states in Nigeria.\n\nOct. 25, 2011\n\nOnchocerciasis in the Americas: From Arrival to (Near) Elimination (PDF)\n\nPublished by Parasites & Vectors, 2011, 4:205. doi:10.1186/1756-3305-4-205.

The success of this public health program is due to a robust public-private partnership involving national governments, local communities, donor organizations, intergovernmental bodies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations and the pharmaceutical industry. The lessons learned through the efforts in the Americas are in turn informing the program to control and eliminate onchocerciasis in Africa.\n\nSeptember 2011\n\nElimination of human onchocerciasis: History of progress and current feasibility using ivermectin (Mectizan®) monotherapy\n\nPublished by Acta Tropica, 2011 doi:10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.08.009\n\nAuthors: Ed W. Cupp, Mauricio Sauerbrey, and Frank O.

For these reasons, the drug was donated by the Merck Company for regional control programs in Africa and the Americas. Recurrent treatment with ivermectin at semi-annual intervals also impacts adult worms and result in loss of fecundity and increased mortality.\n\nNov. 1, 2010\n\nEmergence of Onchocerca Volvulus From Skin Mimicking Dracunculiasis Medinensis (PDF)\n\nPublished by the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 83(6), 2010, pp. 1348-1351.\n\nAuthors: Mark L.

Below the threshold, communities are considered hypoendemic and mass treatment is not recommended. As policy begins to shift from control to elimination, hypoendemic areas' role in maintaining Onchocerca volvulus needs re-examination. The study determined whether independent transmission occurs in a hypoendemic area in the north region of Cameroon.\n\nApril 1, 2010\n\nTraditional Kinship System Enhanced Classic Community-Directed Treatment With Ivermectin (CDTI) for Onchocerciasis Control in Uganda (PDF)\n\nPublished by Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene104 (2010) 265–272.\n\nAuthors: Moses N.

In the same districts having onchocerciasis we found LF (as determined by blood antigen testing in adult males) in 90% of 149 villages with a mean prevalence of 22.4% (range 0-67%). Similarly, SH, as a mean prevalence in school age children of 24.4% (range 0-87%). Health education and treatment interventions for SH resulted in 52,480 cumulative praziquantel treatments, and 159,555 combined onchocerciasis and LF treatments (with ivermectin and albendazole) as of the end of 2000. Treatments for onchocerciasis and LF were separated by at least 1 week from treatments for SH. There was no negative impact on the coverage of the onchocerciasis program by the addition of LF and SH activities.\n\nDec. 1, 2001\n\nControl of Onchocerciasis Today: Status and Challenges\n\nPublished by Trends in Parasitology, 2001 doi:10.1016/S1471-4922(01)02112-2\n\nAuthors: Frank O. Richards Jr., Boakye Boatin, Mauricio Sauerbrey, and Azodoga Sékétéli.\n\nThe filarid parasite Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of human onchocerciasis (river blindness), an infection characterized by chronic skin and eye lesions. There are three regional programs currently dedicated to controlling onchocerciasis in the endemic areas of Africa and the Americas: the Onchocerciasis Control Programme of West Africa, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control and the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas. All three programs use periodic mass treatment with the microfilaricidal drug ivermectin with differing strategic purposes and, as a result, face different challenges to reach their goals.\n\nDec. 1, 2001\n\nThe Carter Center's Assistance to River Blindness Control Programs: Establishing Treatment Objectives and Goals for Monitoring Ivermectin Delivery Systems on Two Continents (PDF)\n\nPublished by the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2001; 65:108-14.\n\nAuthors: F.

As part of an international global partnership to control onchocerciasis, The Carter Center's Global 2000 River Blindness Program (GRBP) assists the ministries of health in ten countries to distribute ivermectin (Mectizan®, donated by Merck & Co.). The GRBP priorities are to maximize ivermectin treatment coverage and related health education and training efforts, and to monitor progress through regular reporting of ivermectin treatments measured against annual treatment objectives and ultimate treatment goals (e.g., full coverage, which is defined as reaching all persons residing in at risk villages who are eligible for treatment). Since the GRBP began in 1996, more than 21.2 million ivermectin treatment encounters have been reported by assisted programs. In 1999, more than 6.6 million eligible persons at risk for onchocerciasis received treatment, which represented 96% of the 1999 annual treatment objective of 6.9 million, and 78% of the ultimate treatment goal in assisted areas.\n\nNov. 1, 2001\n\nOn the Road with President Carter: Targeting River Blindness\n\nPublished by The Carter Center\n\nAuthor: President Carter\n\nDuring November 2001, former President Jimmy Carter attended the 11th annual InterAmerican Conference on Onchocerciasis in Mexico City, which brought together high-level representatives from the six onchocerciasis- or river blindness-endemic countries in the Americas to discuss recent findings that, under certain conditions, it is feasible to eliminate river blindness in the Americas. Occurring mostly in Africa, the disease also threatens about 540,000 people in Mexico, Guatemala, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil.\n\nMay 1, 2001\n\nInvolvement of Women in Community-Directed Treatment With Ivermectin for the Control of Onchocerciasis in Rukungiri district, Uganda: a knowledge, attitude and practice study (PDF)\n\nPublished by Tropical Medicine & Parasitology, Vol. 95, No. 5, 485-494 (2001).\n\nAuthors: Katabarwa, M.N., Habomugisha, P., Ndyomugyenyi, R., and Agunyo, S. Published in Annals of\n\nA study of knowledge, attitudes and practice was carried out in the Rukungiri district of Uganda, in order to investigate the involvement of women in community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI), for the control of onchocerciasis. The data analysed came from interviews with 260 adult women (one from each of 260 randomly-selected households in 20 onchocerciasis-endemic communities), community informants, and participatory evaluation meetings (PEM) in eight communities. The women who had been treated with ivermectin in 1999 generally had more knowledge of the benefits of taking ivermectin, were more likely to have attended the elevant health-education sessions and were more involved in community decisions on the method of ivermectin distribution than the women who had not received ivermectin in that year. There were fewer female community-directed health workers (CDHW) than male CDHW in the communities investigated. The reasons for not attending health-education sessions, not participating in community meetings concerning the CDTI, and the reluctance of some women to serve as CDHW were investigated.\n\nFeb. 1, 2001\n\nCommunity-Directed Health (CDH) Workers Enhance the Performance and Sustainability of CDH Programmes: experience from ivermectin distribution in Uganda (PDF)\n\nPublished by Annals of Tropical Medicine & Parasitology, Vol. 95, No. 3, 275-286 (2001).\n\nAuthors: M.N.

Authors: Katabarwa, N. M.; Richards, F.O. Jr.; and Ndyomugyenyi, R.\n\nIn rural Ugandan communities where onchocerciasis is meso- or hyper-endemic, conrol of the disease is now being carried out using a strategy of community-directed programmes for the annual distribution of ivermectin to all persons eligible to take the drug. For these programmes to achieve their annual target coverage of at least 90% of the population eligible to take ivermectin, and to continue to sustain themselves for 10-15 years or more, even after external donor funding ceases, it has been found essential to replace the initial community-based strategy, imposed from outside, by a community-directed strategy developed by the community members themselves. Furthermore, it is essential for success that full use be made of the traditional social system, which is very strong in all rural communities in Uganda. This system is based on patrilineal kinships and clans, governed by traditional law, and in it women play an important role. If this system is ignored or by-passed by governmnet health personnel or by the sponsors and promoters of the programme, the communities are likely to fail to reach their targets.\n\nNov. 27, 1999\n\nMonetary incentives and community-directed health programmes in some less-developed countries\n\nPublished by Lancet. 1999: 354: 1909.\n\nAuthors: Katabarwa M, Mutabazi D, Richards F.\n\nNew campaigns on community-based treatment or control measures are being launched against several major endemic diseases in less-developed tropical countries.\n\nAugust 1999\n\nRapid epidemiological mapping of onchocerciasis (REMO) in areas of Uganda where Simulium neavei sl is the vector\n\nPublished by East Africa Medical Journal. 1998: 76(8).\n\nAuthors: Katabarwa M, Onapa A, Nakileza B.\n\nThis study was undertaken to test whether rapid epidemiological mapping of onchocerciasis (REMO) was suitable for mapping of onchocerciasis in foci where Simulium neavei sl is the primary vector.

Jacox\n\nThe decision in 1987 by the pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co. to provide Mectizan® (ivermectin) free of charge to river blindness control programs has challenged the international public health community to find effective ways to distribute the drug to rural populations most affected by onchocerciasis. In the Americas, PAHO responded to that challenge by calling for the elimination of all morbidity from onchocerciasis from the Region by the year 2007 through mass distribution of ivermectin. Since 1991, a multinational, multiagency partnership (consisting of PAHO, the endemic countries, nongovernmental development organizations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as academic institutions and funding agencies) has developed the political, financial, and technical support needed to move toward the realization of that goal.\n\nApril 1998\n\nProblems and perspectives of managing an onchocerciasis control programme\n\nPublished by Annals Trop Med Parasitol. 1998: 92: S121-128.\n\nAuthors: Miri E.\n\nThe onchocerciasis control programme in Plateau state (now Plateau and Nasarawa states), Nigeria, was one of the pioneering Mectizan-distribution projects in Nigeria.
