        "text": "Small mammals from the ChelemhÃ¡ Cloud Forest Reserve, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMatson, Jason O.; OrdÃ³Ã±ez-Garza, NictÃ©; Woodman, Neal; Bulmer, Walter; Eckerlin, Ralph P.; Hanson, J. Delton\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe surveyed the small mammals of remnant mixed hardwood-coniferous cloud forest at elevations ranging from 2,100â2,300 m in the ChelemhÃ¡ Cloud Forest Reserve, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. Removal-trapping using a combination of live traps, snap traps, and pitfall traps for 6 days in January 2007 resulted in 175 captures of 15 species of marsupials, shrews, and rodents. This diversity of small mammals is the highest that we have recorded from a single locality of the 10 visited during eight field seasons in the highlands of Guatemala. Based on captures, the most abundant species in the community of small mammals isÂ Peromyscus grandisÂ (nÂ = 50), followed byÂ Handleyomys rhabdopsÂ (nÂ = 27),Â Heteromys desmarestianus(nÂ = 18),Â Reithrodontomys mexicanusÂ (nÂ = 17),Â Handleyomys saturatiorÂ (nÂ = 16),Â Sorex veraepacisÂ (nÂ = 15), andÂ Scotinomys teguinaÂ (nÂ = 13).

From 1997 to 2001 a total of 142 bird species were recorded between 2000 and 2400 masl in cloud forest and agricultural clearings on MontaÃ±a Caquipec (Alta Verapaz, Guatemala). The bird community is described based on line transect counts within the forest. Pooling census data from undisturbed and disturbed forest, the Gray-breasted Wood-Wren (Henicorhina leucophrys) was found to be the most abundant species, followed in descending order by the Common Bush-Tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus), the Paltry Tyrannulet (Zimmerius vilissimus), the Yellowish Flycatcher (Empidonax flavescens), the Ruddy-capped Nightingale-Thrush (Catharus frantzi), and the Amethyst-throated Hummingbird (Lampornis amethystinus). Bird communities in undisturbed and disturbed forest were found to be similar (Serensen similarity index 0.85), indicating low human impact. Of all recorded species, approximately 27% were Nearctic-Neotropical migratory birds. The most abundant one was the Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla). The MontaÃ±a Caquipec is an important area for bird conservation, which is indicated by the presence of four species listed in the IUCN Red List (Highland Guan Penelopina nigra, Resplendent Quetzal Pharomachrus mocinno, Pink-headed Warbler Ergaticus versicolor, Golden-cheeked Warbler Dendroica chrysoparia), and 42 Mesoamerican endemics, of which 14 species are endemic to the Central American Highlands.

Quan; Flores BeltetÃ³n, O. G.; Barillas, M.; Mota ChavarrÃ­a, M. A.; GirÃ³n Mazariego, J. R.; Devoli, G.; Lauritzen, S. E.; Christen, M.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nOn 4 January, 2009, more than 5 million cubic metres of limestone and calcareous breccias detached from the \"Los Chorros\" hill and travelled along a tributary ravine of the Chixoy river in the municipality of San CristÃ³bal Verapaz, department of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. At the time of this landslide, several persons were crossing roads and foot trails downstream of the release area. As of 14 January, authorities had reported 38 casualties, 50 missing and 5 injured persons. Along the landslide path, a 1.2 km segment of the 7W National Highway was destroyed, cutting the sole access route between San CristÃ³bal Verapaz and the western department of QuichÃ© where numerous inhabitants of Alta Verapaz commute to work, especially during the coffee harvest season from October to March (with its peak on January). In response to this disaster, the Guatemalan government established four priorities: search and rescue activities, relief aid to victims and their families, evacuation of villages at risk and selection and construction of a temporary access route and a permanent road. In an attempt to provide additional elements to decision-makers of the Guatemalan authorities, this report is aimed to characterise the context of this landslide from a geosciences perspective. Preliminary assessments of the 4 January event and of other potentially unstable zones identified in the surrounding areas are also performed. The first accounts of ground instabilities in this area date back to 1590 when a 4.0 MS earthquake was associated with the collapse of a karst cave. In 1881, a Guatemalan newspaper reported that the San CristÃ³bal (Chichoj) lagoon was created after a ground subsidence was triggered by an earthquake. In 1983, after less than one year of operations, a ~50 m segment of the 26-km long pressure tunnel in the Chixoy hydro electrical project was damaged due to an anhydrite karst produced during tunnel operations. In response to this event, repair and strengthening works were\n\nPaleomagnetism of San Cristobal Island, Galapagos\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCox, A.\n\n1971-01-01\n\nIsla San Cristobal, the most easterly of the Galapagos Islands, consists of two parts: a large volcano constitutes the southwest half of the island and an irregular apron of small cones and flows makes up the northeast half. As some of the younger flows on the flanks of the large volcano are reversely magnetized, the minimum age of the volcano is 0.7 my, which is the age of the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal boundary. The true age is probably several times greater. The cones and flows to the northeast are all normally magnetized. The between-site angular dispersion of virtual poles is 11.3?? - a value consistent with mathematical models for the latitude dependence of geomagnetic secular variation. ?? 1971.\n\n77 FR 29633 - Alta Wind VII, LLC, Alta Wind IX, LLC, Alta Wind X, LLC, Alta Wind XI, LLC, Alta Wind XII, LLC...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-05-18\n\n...

Regional earthquakes generated by the underthrusting and subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate are the most prominent seismic feature in Central America. Earthquakes in the vicinity of the volcanoes occur on faults that appear to be related to volcano formation. Faulting near Fuego and Pacaya volcanoes in Guatemala is more complex due to motion on a major E-W striking transform plate boundary 40 km north of the volcanoes. Volcanic activity produces different kinds of seismic signatures. Shallow tectonic or A-type events originate on nearby faults and occur both singly and in swarms. There are typically from 0 to 6 A-type events per day with b value of about 1.3. At very shallow depths beneath Pacaya, Izalco, and San Cristobal large numbers of low-frequency or B-type events are recorded with predominant frequencies between 2.5 and 4.5 Hz and with b values of 1.7 to 2.9. The relative number of B-type events appears to be related to the eruptive states of the volcanoes; the more active volcanoes have higher levels of seismicity. At Fuego Volcano, however, low-frequency events have unusually long codas and appear to be similar to tremor. High-amplitude volcanic tremor is recorded at Fuego, Pacaya, and San Cristobal during eruptive periods. Large explosion earthquakes at Fuego are well recorded at five stations and yield information on near-surface seismic wave velocities (??=3.0??0.2 km/sec.). ?? 1983 Intern.

Recent seismicity (2013-2016) along the 280 km long SCT, known as a Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator (STEP) fault, highlights the tearing process and ongoing development of the plate boundary. The region's earthquakes reveal two key characteristics. First, earthquakes at the western terminus of the SCT, which we interpret to indicate the Australia plate tearing, display disparate fault geometries. These events demonstrate that plate tearing is accommodated via multiple intersecting planes rather than a single through-going fault. Second, the SCT hosts sequences of Mw â¼7 strike-slip earthquakes that migrate westward through a rapid succession of events. Sequences in 1993 and 2015 both began along the eastern SCT and propagated west, but neither progression ruptured into or nucleated a large earthquake within the region near the tear. Utilizing b-value and Coulomb Failure Stress analyses, we examine these along-strike variations in the SCT's seismicity. b-Values are highest along the youngest, western end of the SCT and decrease with increasing distance from the tear. This trend may reflect increasing strain localization with increasing displacement. Coulomb Failure Stress analyses indicate that the stress conditions were conducive to continued western propagation of the 1993 and 2015 sequences suggesting that the unruptured western SCT may have fault geometries or properties that inhibit continued rupture. Our results indicate a displacement-driven fault maturation process. The multi-plane Australia plate tearing likely creates a western SCT with diffuse strain accommodated along a network of disorganized faults. After â¼90 km of cumulative displacement (â¼900,000 yr of plate motion), strain localizes and faults align, allowing the SCT to host\n\nFinite Element Analysis of Patella Alta: A Patellofemoral Instability Model.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatson, Nicole A; Duchman, Kyle R; Grosland, Nicole M; Bollier, Matthew J\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis study aims to provide biomechanical data on the effect of patella height in the setting of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction using finite element analysis. The study will also examine patellofemoral joint biomechanics using variable femoral insertion sites for MPFL reconstruction. A previously validated finite element knee model was modified to study patella alta and baja by translating the patella a given distance to achieve each patella height ratio. Additionally, the models were modified to study various femoral insertion sites of the MPFL (anatomic, anterior, proximal, and distal) for each patella height model, resulting in 32 unique scenarios available for investigation. In the setting of patella alta, the patellofemoral contact area decreased, resulting in a subsequent increase in maximum patellofemoral contact pressures as compared to the scenarios with normal patellar height. Additionally, patella alta resulted in decreased lateral restraining forces in the native knee scenario as well as following MPFL reconstruction. Changing femoral insertion sites had a variable effect on patellofemoral contact pressures; however, distal and anterior femoral tunnel malpositioning in the setting of patella alta resulted in grossly elevated maximum patellofemoral contact pressures as compared to other scenarios. Patella alta after MPFL reconstruction results in decreased lateral restraining forces and patellofemoral contact area and increased maximum patellofemoral contact pressures. When the femoral MPFL tunnel is malpositioned anteriorly or distally on the femur, the maximum patellofemoral contact pressures increase with severity of patella alta. When evaluating patients with patellofemoral instability, it is important to recognize patella alta as a potential aggravating factor. Failure to address patella alta in the setting of MPFL femoral tunnel malposition may result in even further increases in patellofemoral contact pressures, making it\n\nFinite Element Analysis of Patella Alta: A Patellofemoral Instability Model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDuchman, Kyle R.; Grosland, Nicole M.; Bollier, Matthew J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Background: This study aims to provide biomechanical data on the effect of patella height in the setting of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction using finite element analysis.

The system architecture was described and an initial performance evaluation was presented. This system, based on the ALTA 3000, uses a new 33.3X, 0.8 NA final reduction lens to reduce the spot size to 0.27 micrometers FWHM, thereby affording improved resolution and pattern acuity on the mask. To take advantage of the improved resolution, a new anisotropic chrome etch process has been developed and introduced along with change from Olin 895i resist to TOK iP3600 resist. In this paper we will more extensively describe the performance of the ALTA 3500 and the performance of these new processes.\n\nALTA injection sclerosing therapy:non-excisional treatment of internal hemorrhoids.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyamoto, Hidenori; Asanoma, Michihito; Miyamoto, Hideyuki; Shimada, Mitsuo\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) is a new sclerosing therapy for internal hemorrhoids. This injection therapy is a four-step direct injection sclerosing procedure intended to shrink and harden internal hemorrhoids to eliminate hemorrhoidal prolapse and bleeding. The aim of this study was to assess the short term efficacy of this treatment. The procedure was conducted using a four-step injection process under perianal local anesthesia. The entry point for the four-step injection of ALTA is the submucosa of the superior pole, the submucosa in the central part, the mucous lamina propria in the central part and the submucosa at the inferior pole of hemorrhoid. From January 2009 to March 2010, we performed the ALTA sclerosing therapy on 28 patients (14 men and 14 women; mean age, 64.6 years), including 5 second-degree, 16 third-degree and 7 fourth-degree hemorrhoids. There were 6 postoperative complications (2 cases of low grade fever, 2 anal pains, 1 necrosis at injection site and 1 perianal dermatitis). All symptoms of prolapse or bleeding disappeared after 29 postoperative days. There were 3 recurrent cases (10.7%). ALTA sclerosing therapy is a useful and less invasive treatment for internal hemorrhoids.\n\nMalaria elimination challenges in Mesoamerica: evidence of submicroscopic malaria reservoirs in Guatemala.\n\nPubMed\n\nLennon, Shirley Evelyn; Miranda, Adolfo; Henao, Juliana; Vallejo, Andres F; Perez, Julianh; Alvarez, Alvaro; ArÃ©valo-Herrera, Myriam; Herrera, SÃ³crates\n\n2016-08-30\n\nEven though malaria incidence has decreased substantially in Guatemala since 2000, Guatemala remains one of the countries with the highest malaria transmission in Mesoamerica. Guatemala is committed to eliminating malaria as part of the initiative 'Elimination of Malaria in Mesoamerica and the Island of Hispaniola' (EMMIE); however, it is still in the control phase. During the past decade, the government strengthened malaria control activities including mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-impregnated bed nets, early diagnosis and prompt treatment. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of malaria, including gametocytes, in three areas of Guatemala using active case detection (ACD) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in three departments with varying transmission intensities: Escuintla, Alta Verapaz and Zacapa. Blood samples from 706 volunteers were screened for malaria using microscopy and qPCR which was also used to determine the prevalence of gametocytes among infected individuals. Results were collected and analysed using REDCap and R Project, respectively. Malaria was diagnosed by microscopy in only 2.8Â % (4/141) of the volunteers from Escuintla. By contrast, qPCR detected a prevalence of 7.1Â % (10/141) in the same volunteers, 8.4Â % (36/429) in Alta Verapaz, and 5.9Â % (8/136) in Zacapa. Overall, 7.6Â % (54/706) of the screened individuals were positive, with an average parasitaemia level of 40.2 parasites/Î¼L (range 1-1133 parasites/Î¼L) and 27.8Â % carried mature gametocytes. Fifty-seven percent (31/54) of qPCR positive volunteers were asymptomatic and out of the 42.6Â % of symptomatic individuals, only one had a positive microscopy result. This study found a considerable number of asymptomatic P. vivax infections that were mostly submicroscopic, of which, approximately one-quarter harboured mature gametocytes. This pattern is likely to contribute to maintaining transmission across the\n\nAluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection as the mainstay of treatment for internal hemorrhoids.\n\nPubMed\n\nHachiro, Yoshikazu; Kunimoto, Masao; Abe, Tatsuya; Kitada, Masahiro; Ebisawa, Yoshiaki\n\n2011-06-01\n\nAluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) induce noninvasive sclerosis and the involution of hemorrhoids by initiating an inflammatory reaction. We assessed the mid-term outcome after ALTA sclerotherapy for symptomatic hemorrhoids. Between May 2006 and July 2009, 1210 patients with grade III or IV hemorrhoids underwent surgery at Kunimoto Hospital. Our treatment strategy for internal hemorrhoids is first establishing whether ALTA therapy is possible for the type of hemorrhoid, and then performing either ALTA therapy or alternatively, ligation and excision (LE) for those types unsuitable for ALTA therapy. A total of 448 patients were treated with ALTA therapy alone (Group A), 706 patients were treated with a combination of ALTA and LE therapy (Group B), and 56 patients were treated with LE alone (Group C). The overall recurrence rates were 3.6% (16/448) and 0.3% (2/706) in Groups A and B, respectively. There was no recurrence in Group C. Rectal ulcers developed at the injection site in four (0.9%) patients from Group A, but they healed within a few months with conservative therapy. ALTA sclerotherapy is a simple and safe treatment for symptomatic hemorrhoids, with few complications.\n\nAdvantages of isofocal printing in maskmaking with the ALTA 3500\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFuller, Scott E.; Pochkowski, Mike\n\n1999-04-01\n\nThe ALTA 3500, an advanced scanned-laser mask lithography tool produced by Etec, was introduced to the marketplace in 1997.

However, it is not a treatment option for external hemorrhoidal diseases, including mixed hemorrhoids. Distal hemorrhoidectomy with ALTA injection involves surgical resection of external piles, followed by injection therapy on internal piles. We report technical details and the short-term results of this procedure in patients with mixed hemorrhoids. Seventy-two patients with mixed hemorrhoids treated between 2010 and 2011 were included. The main outcome measures were the short-term response and complication rates. At 28 days after surgery, the disappearance rate of prolapse was 100%. Three patients (4%) had postoperative complications, all minor in nature. No prolapse recurrence was observed within a median follow-up period of 6 months. Distal hemorrhoidectomy with ALTA injection appears to be a promising treatment option for patients with mixed hemorrhoids.

Patellar tendon advancement typically is used to correct patella alta and restore normal knee mechanics. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanical strength of surgical constructs used for fixation during patellar advancement procedures. This study used a cadaveric model to determine which of 3 surgical techniques is biomechanically optimal for patellar tendon advancement in treating patella alta. Twenty-four human cadaveric knees (8 per group) were prepared using 1 of 3 different common surgical techniques: tibial tubercle osteotomy, patellar tendon partial resection and repair at the distal patella, and patellar tendon imbrication. The patella was loaded from 25 to 250 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles. A significant difference in patella displacement under cyclical loading was found between surgical techniques. Tibial tubercle osteotomy exhibited significantly less displacement under cyclical loading than distal patella excision and repair (P<.0001) or imbrication (P=.0088). Imbrication exhibited significantly less displacement than distal patella excision and repair (P=.0006). Tibial tubercle osteotomy survived longest. Based on failure criteria of 5 mm of displacement, tibial tubercle osteotomy lasted between 250 and 500 cycles. The other 2 techniques failed by 25 cycles. This study offers quantitative evidence regarding the relative mechanical strength of each construct and may influence choice of surgical technique. [Orthopedics. 2016; 39(3):e492-e497.].

The frequencies of patella alta and patella baja have not yet been determined. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of patella alta and to determine reference values to the position of the vertical patella according to two modified techniques of the Insall-Salvati method in a group of 65 German shepherd dogs (115 stifle joints). The upper limits of reference values for the normal vertical position of the patella were 1.79 and 2.13, depending on the method of measurement. A high prevalence of patella alta was observed in the group of German shepherd dogs. A correlation was demonstrated between the classification of dogs' joints in the patella alta group and the multiplied risk of canine hip dysplasia (CHD) through the estimation of odds ratios. Dogs with patella alta were healthy dogs that did not exhibit orthopaedic problems in the stifle joints. The results revealed that the risk of CHD is twice as high in dogs with higher patellar ligament length to patella length ratio.\n\nQuadriceps Weakness, Patella Alta and Structural Features of Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis: The Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStefanik, Joshua J.; Guermazi, Ali; Zhu, Yanyan; Zumwalt, Ann C.; Gross, K. Douglas; Clancy, Margaret; Lynch, John A.; Segal, Neil A.; Lewis, Cora E.; Roemer, Frank W.; Powers, Christopher M.; Felson, David T.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective To determine the relationship between quadriceps weakness and cartilage damage and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) in the patellofemoral joint (PFJ), and if this relationship is modified by patella alta. Methods The Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study is a cohort study of persons aged 50â79 years with or at risk for knee OA. Concentric knee extensor strength was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Patella alta was measured using the Insall-Salvati ratio (ISR) on the lateral radiograph, and cartilage damage and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) were graded on MRI in the PFJ. We determined the association between quadriceps weakness with cartilage damage and BMLs in the PFJ among those knees with (ISRâ¥1.2) and without patella alta (ISR<1.2) using multiple binomial regression. Results 807 knees were studied (mean age 62 years, BMI 30, ISR 1.10), 64% from female subjects. Compared with knees in the highest strength tertile, those in the lowest had 10.2% {95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3â18}, 9.1% (95% CI 2â16), and 7.1% (95% CI 1â13) higher prevalence of lateral PFJ cartilage damage, medial PFJ cartilage damage, and lateral PFJ BMLs, respectively. The association between quadriceps weakness with cartilage damage and BMLs was not different between knees with and with out patella alta in the lateral PFJ. Conclusion Quadriceps weakness was associated with PFJ cartilage damage and BMLs. While both patella alta and quadriceps weakness are associated with PFJ damage, the combination of the two was not associated with more damage than either of these factors alone.

We imaged 37 PF pain and 15 pain free subjects in an open-configuration magnetic resonance imaging scanner while they stood in a weightbearing posture. We measured patella height using the Caton-Deschamps, Blackburne-Peel, Insall-Salvati, Modified Insall-Salvati, and Patellotrochlear indices, and classified the subjects into patella alta and normal patella height groups. We measured patella tilt and bisect offset from oblique-axial plane images, and classified the subjects into maltracking and normal tracking groups. Patellar maltracking was more prevalent among PF pain subjects with patella alta compared to PF pain subjects with normal patella height (two-tailed Fisherâs exact test, p < 0.050). Using the Caton-Deschamps index, 67% (8/12) of PF pain subjects with patella alta were maltrackers, whereas only 16% (4/25) of PF pain subjects with normal patella height were maltrackers. Patellofemoral pain subjects classified as maltrackers displayed a greater patella height compared to the pain free and PF pain subjects classified as normal trackers (two-tailed unpaired t-tests with Bonferroni correction, p < 0.017). This study adds to our understanding of PF pain in two ways - 1) we demonstrate that patellar maltracking is more prevalent in PF pain subjects with patella alta compared to subjects with normal patella height; and 2) we show greater patella height in PF pain subjects compared to pain free subjects using four indices commonly used in clinics.

A 5% solution of Alta, a commercially available cosmetic preparation, is added in the upper tank buffer during electrophoresis. On completion of electrophoresis, the gel is washed in distilled water and viewed on a white light plate and a transilluminator to photograph the protein profiles. The gel is processed for western blot transfer of proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and upon completion, the protein profiles on the membrane are viewed and photographed as stated above. The membrane can then be processed for immunostaining as per the standard procedure. Thus, the staining procedure using Alta is simple, rapid (without any need of destaining), and cost-effective.\n\nThe Wall-Rock Record of Incremental Emplacement in the Little Cottonwood-Alta Magmatic and Hydrothermal System, Wasatch Mountains, Utah, U.S.A.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStearns, M.; Callis, S.; Beno, C.; Bowman, J. R.; Bartley, J. M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nContact aureoles record the cumulative effects on wall rocks of magma emplacement. Like the plutons they surround, contact aureoles have long been regarded to form geologically instantaneously. Protracted incremental emplacement of plutons must be reconciled with the wall-rock record of heat and mass transfer. Fundamental questions include how heat and material move from intrusions into their aureoles and how long that process takes. The Little Cottonwood stock is surrounded by a 2 km-wide contact aureole that contains prograde AFM mineral assemblages in the pelitic layers of the Proterozoic Big Cottonwood Formation. The Alta stock is surrounded by a well characterized 1 km-wide contact aureole containing both prograde AFM and CMS mineral assemblages in Ophir Shale and Mississippian dolostones, respectively. Understanding the petrogenesis of these aureoles requires the timing of magmatism and wall-rock metamorphism to be independently determined. Preliminary petrochronology (U/Th-Pb dates and trace element concentrations collected by LASS-ICP-MS) from the inner aureoles of both intrusions establishes a protracted history of monazite (re)crystallization from 35-25 Ma in the Little Cottonwood aureole and 35 Ma in the Alta aureole. Little Cottonwood aureole monazites are characterized by a positive age correlation with heavy rare earth elements (HREE) and a negative correlation with Eu/Eu*. Alta aureole monazites have a similar range of the HREE concentrations and Eu/Eu* variation. Zircon growth interpreted to record emplacement-level magmatic crystallization of the western Little Cottonwood stock ranges from 33-28 Ma near the contact. Multi-grain U-Pb zircon TIMS dates from the Alta stock range from 35-33 Ma and are interpreted to suggest the full range of emplacement-level magmatism in the Alta stock. Additionally, in situ U-Pb titanite dates from the Alta stock record intermittent high temperature hydrothermal activity in the stock margin from 35-24 Ma.

The upper lake, Laguna Safuna Alta at 4354 m asl has formed in the 1960s behind a terminal moraine of the retreating Pucajirca Glacier, named after the peak south of the lakes. Safuna Alta currently has a volume of 15 x 106 m3. In 2002 a rock fall of several million m3 from the proximal left lateral moraine hit the Safuna Alta lake and triggered an impact wave which overtopped the moraine dam and passed into the lower lake, Laguna Safuna Baja, which absorbed most of the outburst flood from the upper lake, but nevertheless causing loss in cattle, degradation of agricultural land downstream and damages to a hydroelectric power station in Quitaracsa gorge. Event reconstructions showed that the impact wave in the Safuna Alta lake had a runup height of 100 m or more, and weakened the moraine dam of Safuna Alta. This fact, in combination with the large lake volumes and the continued possibility for landslides from the left proximal moraine pose a considerable risk for the downstream settlements as well as the recently completed Quitaracsa hydroelectric power plant. In the framework of a project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), the hazard situation at the Safuna Alta lake is assessed by a combination of satellite radar data analysis, field investigations, and slope stability modeling. Interferometric analyses of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) of ALOS-1 Palsar-1, ALOS-2 Palsar-2 and Sentinel-1 data from 2016 reveal terrain displacements of 2 cm y-1 in the detachment zone of the 2002 rock avalanche. More detailed insights into the characteristics of these terrain deformations are gained by repeat surveys with differential GPS (DGPS) and tachymetric measurements.

However, the aldonolactones generated by oxidative enzymes have inhibitory effects on some cellulolytic enzymes. In this work, D-glucono-1,5-lactone was shown to have a much stronger inhibitory effect than D-glucose and D-gluconate on Î²-glucosidase, a vital enzyme during cellulose degradation. AltA, a secreted enzyme from Penicillium oxalicum, was identified as an aldonolactonase which can catalyze the hydrolysis of D-glucono-1,5-lactone to D-gluconic acid. In the course of lignocellulose saccharification conducted by cellulases from P. oxalicum or Trichoderma reesei, supplementation of AltA was able to relieve the decrease of Î²-glucosidase activity obviously with a stimulation of glucose yield. This boosting effect disappeared when sodium azide and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were added to the saccharification system to inhibit the activities of oxidative enzymes. In summary, we describe the first heterologous expression of a fungal secreted aldonolactonase and its application as an efficient supplement of cellulolytic enzyme system for lignocellulose biodegradation.\n\nDescripciÃ³n de la zona de alta difusiÃ³n en un modelo bidimensional para hojas de corriente\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMontero, M.

This image is oriented with east at the top and north at the left. The right image is a stereo anaglyph of the same area, created from red band multi-angle data taken by the 45.6-degree aftward and 70.5-degree aftward cameras on the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite. View this image through red/blue 3D glasses, with the red filter over the left eye. A plume from San Cristobal (approximately at image center) is much easier to see in the anaglyph, due to 3 effects: the long viewing path through the atmosphere at the oblique angles, the reduced reflection from the underlying water, and the 3D stereoscopic height separation. In this image, the plume floats between the surface and the overlying cumulus clouds. A second plume is also visible in the upper right (southeast of San Cristobal). This very thin plume may originate from the Masaya volcano, which is continually degassing at as low rate.

During that period, average annual gold production was about 6.5 tons, with an estimated Hg annual emission to the environment of about 8.8 tons, 60-80% of it being emitted to the atmosphere. Mercury sources to the region are mining sites and gold-dealer shops at the city of Alta Floresta, where gold is smelted and commercialized. Mercury concentrations in forest soils (15-248 ng g(-1), average=61.9 ng g(-1)) were 1.5-3.0 times higher than in pasture soils (10-74 ng g(-1), average=33.8 ng g(-1)), suggesting strong re-mobilization after deforestation. Highest Hg concentrations were found within a distance of 20-30 km from mining sites in both soil types. The influence of the refining operations within the city of Alta Floresta, however, was less clear. Somewhat higher concentrations were observed only within a 5 km radius from the city center where gold-dealer shops are located. Wind direction controls the spatial distribution of Hg. Background concentrations (15-50 ng g(-1)) were generally found at the outer perimeter of the sampling grid, about 40 km from sources. This suggests that Hg released from mining and refining activities undergoes rapid deposition. Estimated cumulative Hg burdens for the first 10 cm of soil averaged 8.3 mg m(-2) and 4.9 mg m(-2), for forest and pasture soils respectively and compare well with ultisols and hydromorphic oxisols, but were lower than those found in yellow-red and yellow latosols and podsols from other Amazonian areas. Our results show that changing land use in the Amazon is a strong re-mobilizing agent of Hg deposited on soils from the atmosphere.\n\nGenetic diversity in cassava landraces grown on farms in Alta Floresta-MT, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nTiago, A V; Rossi, A A B; Tiago, P V; Carpejani, A A; Silva, B M; Hoogerheide, E S S; Yamashita, O M\n\n2016-09-02\n\nBrazil is considered one of the domestication centers of cassava (Manihot esculenta), containing a large part of the biological diversity and traditional knowledge of the species. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of cassava landraces grown by farmers in the north of Mato Grosso State, Brazil, using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular markers. The study was carried out in the municipality of Alta Floresta, MT, on farms located in two rural areas. Seventeen cassava landraces were selected. The DNA was extracted and polymerase chain reaction amplifications were performed using 15 ISSR primers. Genetic similarity estimates were calculated using Jaccard's index and the generated matrix was used for clustering the genotypes by using UPGMA and Tocher's methods. The 15 ISSR primers amplified 120 fragments, revealing 61.67% polymorphism. The polymorphism information content ranged from 0.04 to 0.61, averaging 0.39. The most similar genotypes were AF5 and AF8, whereas the least similar were AF1 and AF16. The UPGMA clustering method formed five groups. Group I included twelve landraces, Group II contained two, and the other groups contained one landrace each. Tocher's method resulted in six groups: 12 landraces clustered in one group, and the other groups each contained one landrace. The ISSR markers proved efficient in revealing genetic diversity among the cassava landraces. The landraces grown by farmers in the two rural areas of Alta Floresta have a great variability and, thus, can be exploited in programs for breeding and preservation of the species.\n\nAssessing the technical efficiency of health posts in rural Guatemala: a data envelopment analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHernÃ¡ndez, Alison R; San SebastiÃ¡n, Miguel\n\n2014-01-01\n\nStrengthening health service delivery to the rural poor is an important means of redressing inequities. Meso-level managers can help enhance efficiency in the utilization of existing resources through the application of practical tools to analyze routinely collected data reflecting inputs and outputs. This study aimed to assess the efficiency and change in productivity of health posts over two years in a rural department of Guatemala. Data envelopment analysis was used to measure health posts' technical efficiency and productivity change for 2008 and 2009. Input/output data were collected from the regional health office of Alta Verapaz for 34 health posts from the 19 districts comprising the health region. Technical efficiency varied widely across health posts, with mean scores of 0.78 (SD=0.24) and 0.75 (SD=0.21) in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Overall, productivity increased by 4%, though 47% of health posts experienced a decline in productivity. Results were combined on a bivariate plot to identify health posts at the high and low extremes of efficiency, which should be followed up to determine how and why their production processes are operating differently. Assessing efficiency using the data that are available at the meso-level can serve as a first step in strengthening performance.

This study aimed to assess the efficiency and change in productivity of health posts over two years in a rural department of Guatemala. Methods Data envelopment analysis was used to measure health postsâ technical efficiency and productivity change for 2008 and 2009. Input/output data were collected from the regional health office of Alta Verapaz for 34 health posts from the 19 districts comprising the health region. Results Technical efficiency varied widely across health posts, with mean scores of 0.78 (SD=0.24) and 0.75 (SD=0.21) in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Overall, productivity increased by 4%, though 47% of health posts experienced a decline in productivity. Results were combined on a bivariate plot to identify health posts at the high and low extremes of efficiency, which should be followed up to determine how and why their production processes are operating differently. Conclusions Assessing efficiency using the data that are available at the meso-level can serve as a first step in strengthening performance. Further work is required to support managers in the routine application of efficiency analysis and putting the results to use in guiding efforts to improve service delivery and increase utilization.

However, a weakness of many studies claiming specificity of plantâpollinator interactions is that they are often restricted to a single locality. The aim of the present study was to investigate pollinator effectiveness of the different flower visitors to the terrestrial orchid Eulophia alta at three different localities and to analyse whether differences in pollinator abundance and composition effect this plant's reproductive success. Methods Natural pollination was observed in vivo, and manipulative experiments were used to study the pollination biology and breeding system of E. alta at three sites near Manaus, Brazil. To gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pollinator attraction, nectar composition and secretion patterns were also studied, floral scent composition was analysed and a bioassay was conducted. Key Results Flower visitors, pollinator composition, pollinia transfer efficiency of particular pollinator species and natural fruit set differed among the investigated populations of E. alta. Flowers were self-compatible, partially autogamous and effectively pollinated by five bee species (four Centris species and Xylocopa muscaria). Visiting insects appeared to imbibe small amounts of hexose-rich nectar. Nectar sugar content was highest on the third day after flower opening. Floral fragrance analyses revealed 42 compounds, of which monoterpenes and benzenoids predominated. A bioassay using floral parts revealed that only floral tissue from the labellum chamber and labellum tip was attractive to flower visitors. Conclusions The data suggest that observed differences in reproductive success in the three populations cannot be explained by absolute abundance of pollinators alone. Due to behavioural patterns such as disturbance of effective pollinators on flowers by male Centris varia bees defending territory, pollinia transfer\n\n78 FR 33101 - Notice of Availability of the Record of Decision for the Alta East Wind Project, Kern County...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-06-03\n\n... turbines, access roads, collector substation, operation and maintenance facility, temporary portable... wind turbines capable of generating up to 153 megawatts.

This imaginary line extends across northern Mexico from the southernmost point of the Baja California Peninsula, to the Gulf of Mexico, passing through the states of Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis PotosÃ­, Nuevo LeÃ³n and Tamaulipas. The Tropic of Cancer marks the northernmost position of the sun at its midday zenith, which takes place in the Summer solstice. On this day, the sun's rays hit the earth's surface vertically along the entire length of this latitude, which was supposed to be significant for the priest/astronomers of ancient times, who dedicated themselves to observing the apparent movements of the sun. It so happens that Alta Vista in Zacatecas, corresponds to the westernmost peak where this phenomenon can occur, although the date of the zenith's course differs depending on the latitude of each position and so various archaeoastronomical specialists stress how the ancient indigenous cultures, at least those dating from Mexico's Classical period, valued this finding in developing their calendars. On the other hand, the research contributes new elements for discussion because it presents a calendar of the horizon, based on of the highest peaks of the Sierra Prieta mountain range ranging from the archaeological sites of El ChapÃ­n, Cerro Pedregoso, to the excavations at El Picacho PelÃ³n (peak El PelÃ³n).\n\nCerro de Pasco and other massive sulfide deposits of central Peru\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCheney, E.S.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe famous Cerro de Pasco Pb-Zn-Ag deposit historically has been considered to be hydrothermally derived from an adjacent Tertiary volcanic vent. However, texturally massive pyrite-chert and pyrite-sphalerite-galena in the deposit have the same strike and cross folds as the adjacent pre-Tertiary strata. Both the deposit and the strata are cut by one of the large Longitudinal Faults. Both dikes and pyrite-enargite veins associated with the vent cut the massive sulfides; fragments of massive pyrite occur in the vent. A few examples of laminated pyrite and chert, banded pyrite and chert, banded pyrite and sphalerite, and banded pyrite, sphalerite, and galenamoreÂ Â» are preserved in the massive sulfide portion of the deposit. The deposit has the composition and zoning patterns typical of shale-hosted massive sulfides. Cerro de Pasco probably in part of the pelitic Devonian Excelsior formation. The Colquijirca deposit 8 km to the south and the San Cristobal district 110 km to the south likewise have been considered to be Tertiary volcanic hydrothermal deposits. Colquijirca consists of stratigraphically controlled mantos of layered pyrite, chert and tuff in the Tertiary Calera formation. The mantos of the San Cristobal district are along the upper contact of the pyritic, Permian, Catalina felsic volcanic rocks; some ore consists of laminated pyrite and sphalerite. Tertiary plutons are conspicuously absent at San Cristobal, and the ores are brecciated by Tertiary folding.Â«Â less\n\nThe Shaw chondrite. I - The case of the missing metal\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRambaldi, E. R.; Larimer, J. W.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe mineralogy as well as the elemental and isotopic composition of the Shaw meteorite indicate that it is a highly metamorphosed L-group chondrite which has lost a portion of its metal and sulfide. The metal which remains has an unusual composition relative to that in other L-group chondrites. It is enriched in Ga, Ge, Ir, Mo, Os, Pt, Re, and Ru but depleted in As, Au, Cu, and Sb. A comparison of the relative enrichments and depletions in Shaw with those observed in San Cristobal, the extreme end-member of group IAB iron meteorites, shows that the metal phases in these two meteorites have complementary compositions. This implies that the metal in Shaw represents the residual solid of a partial melting process while the missing metal, which drained away, may have gone to form an iron meteorite, like San Cristobal.\n\nOxygen Isotope and Microtextural Evidence for Fluctuations in Fluid Pressure During Contact Metamorphism, Alta Aureole, Utah, USA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBowman, J. R.; Valley, J. W.; Kita, N.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThin section-scale textures record a detailed history of prograde and retrograde reactions in the periclase (Per) zone of the Alta Stock aureole. New ion microprobe (SIMS) measurements (10 micron spot, Â±0.2 permil, 1sd) of the oxygen isotope compositions of the carbonates preserving these textures provide evidence for at least two cycles of oscillation of fluid pressure (Pfl) between lithostatic (PL) and hydrostatic (Phyd) conditions during evolution of the inner aureole. Infiltration of water-rich fluids during prograde metamorphism converted dolomite (Dol) to Per + calcite (Cal) marble and caused significant 18O/16O depletion in the Dol protolith (Initial Î´18O (Cal) > +25 permil), producing Cal with Î´18O values of +11 permil. The SIMS values approximate oxygen isotope exchange equilibrium with the Alta stock, indicating that infiltrating fluids were likely magmatic. Exsolution of fluid from the crystallizing magma, coupled with geothermometry from the periclase zone marbles, requires Pfl> PL. Horizontally-oriented expansion cracks filled with brucite (Br) extend from Br pseudomorphs after periclase, and cut retrograde Dol that partially to completely rims the Br pseudomorphs. This earlier retrograde Dol is significantly depleted in 18O/16O relative to matrix Cal, with Î´18O of +5 to +7.1 permil. These lower Î´18O values indicate that meteoric water infiltrated into the Per marbles during cooling and resulting partial back reaction of Per + Cal to Dol, prior to the hydration of the remaining Per to Br. Influx of meteoric water requires sufficient increase in permeability to permit surface- derived meteoric water to penetrate to the estimated 4.5 km depth of this structural level of the Alta aureole, and suggests a resulting decrease in Pfl to hydrostatic pressure conditions. The horizontally-oriented expansion cracks associated with the Br pseudomorphs indicate that sub-vertical expansion accompanied hydration of Per to Br, requiring that Pfl increase again to\n\nResultados del relevamiento de HI en el Cielo Austral: 3.

A.; Frey Law, L.A.; Lewis, C.E.; Roemer, F.W.; Powers, C.M.; Guermazi, A.; Felson, D.T.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective To examine the relationship between patella alta and the prevalence and worsening at follow-up of structural features of patellofemoral joint (PFJ) osteoarthritis (OA) on MRI. Methods The Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study is a cohort study of persons aged 50-79 years with or at risk for knee OA. Patella alta was measured using the Insall-Salvati ratio (ISR) on the baseline lateral radiograph and cartilage damage, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), and subchondral bone attrition (SBA) were graded on MRI at baseline and at 30 months follow-up in the PFJ. We examined the association of the ISR with the prevalence and worsening of cartilage damage, BMLs, and SBA in the PFJ using logistic regression. Results 907 knees were studied (mean age 62, BMI 30, ISR 1.10), 63% from female subjects. Compared with knees in the lowest ISR quartile at baseline, those in the highest had 2.4 (95% CI 1.7, 3.3), 2.9 (2.0, 4.3), and 3.5 (2.3, 5.5) times the odds of having lateral PFJ cartilage damage, BMLs, and SBA respectively, and 1.5 (95% CI 1.1, 2.0), 1.3 (0.9, 1.8), and 2.2 (1.4, 3.4) times the odds of having medial PFJ cartilage damage, BMLs, and SBA respectively. Similarly, those with high ISRs were also at risk for worsening of cartilage damage and BMLs over time than those with low ISRs. Conclusion A high ISR, indicative of patella alta, is associated with structural features of OA in the PFJ. Additionally, the same knees have increased risk of worsening of these same features over time.

Surgical technique and clinical outcome.\n\nPubMed\n\nPugliese, L C; Pike, F S; Aiken, S W\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMedial patellar luxation frequently occurs in dogs resulting in lameness with increasing incidence in large breed dogs. Patella alta has been defined as a patellar ligament length to patellar length ratio that is greater than two and may predispose to patellar luxation. To describe the surgical technique for stabilization of the distal translation of the tibial tuberosity using tibial tuberosity advancement plates and the clinical outcomes with follow-up for clinical cases of dogs. Dogs that were presented with the complaint of patellar luxation and that were concurrently diagnosed with patella alta and were greater than 20 kg in body weight underwent surgery using a tibial tuberosity advancement plate to stabilize the osteotomy. Radiographic assessment of A:PL distance (the ratio of the proximal aspect of the patella to the femoral condyle [A] to the patellar length [PL]), L:P ratio (ratio of the length of the patellar ligament to the diagonal length of the patella), and owner assessment were obtained. Eleven stifles in nine dogs underwent surgical correction with a mean preoperative L:P ratio of 2.47. There were no complications and the lameness resolved clinically. The mean A:PL ratios preoperatively (2.6 Â± 0.22) and postoperatively (2.1 Â± 0.25) were significantly different (p = 0.0003). All owners were satisfied with the outcome and all dogs had a resolution of lameness with no recurrence of patellar luxation. Stabilization of distal translation of the tibial tuberosity using tibial tuberosity advancement implants to correct patella alta in large breed dogs was feasible and resulted in good clinical outcome.\n\n76 FR 56875 - Additional Designations, Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-09-14\n\n...

Arroyo studies are integral to understanding landscape evolution in drylands, but the drivers and dynamics of arroyo cycles are not fully understood. This paper presents a study of arroyo stratigraphy in the semi-arid environment of the Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca, Mexico. Examination of the late Quaternary environment and geomorphology of the incised, ephemeral tributaries forming the RÃ­o Culebra watershed offered insight about the hydrological variability of the region. The characteristics and chronology of alluvium-paleosol sequences from three watersheds in the Mixteca Alta were examined along their upper, middle and downstream sections. In addition, the channel bedforms and stratigraphy of several watersheds were surveyed to evaluate the processes and morphology characterizing the present dryland stream system. Alluvium-paleosol sequences offered valuable information into the paleohydrology and dynamics of the arroyo cycles of the Mixteca Alta. Unweathered alluvium and paleosol formation in alluvium are two end members of alluvial stratigraphy. Cumulic A horizons form on floodplains when aggradation is slow enough to allow for pedogenesis. Cumulic A horizons were observed in both the Culebra and Verde watersheds from the late Pleistocene to the late Holocene, but not in the present-day arroyos, suggesting the prehistoric cumulic A horizons form in less flashy conditions than modern conditions. The geomorphic survey of present-day processes and forms included observing the bed stratigraphy associated with scouring-chains after flash floods. This examination offered insight to understanding and interpreting the alluvium-paleosol stratigraphy. For example, the present channel bed stratigraphy associated with scour-and-fill consists of poorly sorted, massive, sandy gravel deposits. Finer bedded sediments are observed in the present patchy floodplain deposits, but are\n\nPrevalence of asthma in schoolchildren in Alta Floresta- a municipality in the southeast of the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Farias, MÃ¡rcia Regina de Col; Rosa, Antonia Maria; Hacon, Sandra de Souza; de Castro, Hermano Albuquerque; Ignotti, Eliane\n\n2010-03-01\n\nTo analyze the prevalence and symptoms of asthma in students of the Brazilian Amazon municipality of Alta Floresta-MT. Cross-sectional study on the prevalence of asthma in 6 and 7 year-old children and 13 to 14 year-old adolescents, using the Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood - ISAAC method, phase I in 2007. Students who answered affirmatively question 2 - \"presence of wheezing in the past 12 months\" were considered asthmatic. Of the total 2,071 students, 1,072 (51.7%) were children and 999 (48.3%) were teenagers. The prevalence of asthma was 21.4% among schoolchildren, and 12.4% among adolescents (chi2 = 29.29; rho = 0.00). Children presented a higher prevalence than adolescents of the following asthma symptoms: wheezing sometime in life (49.9%), wheezing in the past 12 months (21.4%), 1 to 3 wheezing attacks in the past 12 months (16.4%), and dry cough at night (38.2%). Regarding physician-diagnosed asthma, no difference was observed between the two age groups, with a prevalence of around 6.0%. Male schoolchildren presented a higher prevalence of asthma, physician-diagnosed asthma and four or more wheezing episodes in the past 12 months (rho < 0.05). Male adolescents presented the highest prevalence of strong wheezing affecting speech (rho < 0.05). Alta Floresta presents one of the highest prevalences of asthma in Latin America among schoolchildren in the 6 and 7 year-old age group.\n\nPetrogenesis of Alta'ameem meteorite (Iraq) inferred from major, trace, REE and PGE+Au content\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKettanah, Yawooz A.; Ismail, Sabah A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAlta'ameem Meteorite (AM) is an unaltered ordinary LL chondrite that hit an area near Kirkuk City in northern Iraq on 1977. It has an ash-gray colour with a thin black fusion crust, and consists of spheroidal chondrules and variously shaped clasts aggregated together by a fine grained matrix. The chondrules of Alta'ameem Meteorite include all known types in similar meteorites elsewhere. Mineralogically, the AM consists of silicates (olivine - Fa27.7; pyroxene - Fs23.2 (Opx) and 20.5 (Cpx); plagioclase - Ab73.5An22.1Or4.7), alloys and metals (taenite, tetrataenite, kamacite, and native copper), oxides (ilmenite and chromite), sulfides (troilite), and phosphates (apatite) as well as few unidentified minerals including a Fe-Ti-Cr oxide and Fe-Ni sulfide. The chemistry of AM is dominated by SiO2, MgO, and FeOt accounting for >91 wt% of the bulk composition with minor amounts of Al2O3, CaO, Na2O, S, Ni and Cr. It contains 3675 ppb REE which is within the range of most chondrites, with a negative (-0.8) Sm- and positive (+1.2) Tb-anomalies and a near flat normalized trend (LaN/YbN = 1.16). The concentration of PGEs and Au, Ni, Co, and Cr is low in comparison to most chondrites. The K/La, Ru/Rh vs. Pt/Pd, and Pd/Ir ratio (1.85), and low PGE indicates that the AM is somewhat distinct from other meteorites. The AM has W0 weathering grade and very weak (S2) shock metamorphism. Although the AM has some petrographical and geochemical differences with other chondrites, it still can be considered as LL5 chondrite.\n\nAn observatory system for physical and biogeochemical parameters in the northern Adriatic Sea: the \"Acqua Alta\" oceanographic platform\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBenetazzo, Alvise; Barbariol, Francesco; Bastianini, Mauro; Bergamasco, Andrea; Bergamasco, Filippo; Bernardi Aubry, Fabrizio; Bertotti, Luciana; Bonaldo, Davide; Cavaleri, Luigi; Carniel, Sandro; Falcieri, Francesco M.; Finotto, Stefania; Lester, Graham; Licer, Matjaz; Malacic, Vlado; Minuzzo, Tiziano; Sclavo, Mauro\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe history of the \"Acqua Alta\" oceanographic platform (http://www.ismar.cnr.it/infrastructures/piattaforma-acqua-alta) started more than forty years ago, shortly after the dramatic surge that affected the city of Venice in late 1966. Since then, benefiting also from recent funding acquired within the National Flagship Project RITMARE, great efforts have been devoted to monitor the oceanographic and atmospheric conditions in the Northern Adriatic Sea (NA), in the proximity of the Venice lagoon. Nowadays the \"Acqua Alta\", located on a 16 m depth area, represents a success story of the Institute of Marine Sciences (ISMAR) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), that manages the structure and used collected data to improve the knowledge of the fragile sea environment that surrounds the Venetian littoral. The directional wave observations started in 1979, representing one of the world longest continuous series. On the sea surface, waves are now routinely observed by means of a submerged acoustic-Doppler system that provides burst of directional wave data, including significant wave height, mean wave period and direction of propagation. Currently these wave parameters are integrated with the data collected by a stereo-video system (namely Wave Acquisition Stereo System, WASS) that provides the 3-D profile of the wavy sea surface. WASS data are unleashing a \"new view\" for ocean waves providing the complete space-time dynamics of wave groups. Moreover, a series of multiparameters probes permits to measure the vertical distribution of sea temperature (at nine depths from the surface to the bottom), salinity (three positions), dissolved oxygen (two positions), and turbidity close to the sea bottom. The collected data are continuously used to track the water masses that enter, leave, and are produced within the NA. A striking example is provided by the temperature and salinity data used to follow the exceptional dense water formation that occurred in this basin\n\nGiant-geode endowment of tumuli in the Veia Alta flow, Ametista do Sul\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHartmann, L. A.; Pertille, J.; Duarte, L. C.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTumuli are a common feature of pahoehoe basaltic flows, interspersed with pits, and furnished the necessary volume of rock in the ParanÃ¡ volcanic province for hydrothermal alteration and ballooning to form large cavities (1-2 m common). Filling by amethyst and other minerals resulted in the largest world deposit of geodes, Ametista do Sul. The flat-lying fracture positioned 1 m below the 2-3 m thick geodic level crosses the plateau and is a major guide for exploration and gallery opening. The geodes are limited on the top by the platy joint layer, which is covered by an auto-breccia with undulating lower limit. This wave mimicks and is internal to the structure of tumuli and pits at the surface. This field-oriented survey of galleries selected out of 300 active mines resulted in the description of the internal structure of the remarkable Veia Alta pahoehoe flow, in addition to observations in Uruguay.\n\nNatural and induced endoreic hydrological conditions in the Alta Murgia karstic region (Apulia, Southern Italy)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCanora, F.; Fidelibus, M. D.; Spilotro, G.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nA study aimed at understanding the hydrological processes in karst areas related to the presence of natural and artificial endoreic basins and their modification due to land use change, as well as the influence of above factors on the infiltration rate has been carried out in the Alta Murgia region (Apulia, Southern Italy). The region is a Cretaceous limestone plateau of the Apulian platform, characterized by a mature karstic landscape: due to its elevation, climatic conditions and lithology, the plateau constitutes the main recharge area of the Murgia aquifer. The typical karst topography is essentially related to the subterranean drainage (sinkholes, caves, conduit): surface and subsurface karst geomorphology is strictly interrelated with hydrology. The morphological features of the karstic plateau are defined by the high density of surface karstic forms (mainly dolines), the presence of exposed karst and karren fields, as well as by the extensive outcrop of fractured rocks. Karst surface shows, on the bottom of the morpho-structural depressions called \"lame\", natural distribution of modest deposits of \"terra rossa\" and regolith. The \"lame\" work as streams during and after intense rainfall events, often outlining a primordial ephemeral hydrographical network, frequently convergent towards dolines, poljes or endoreic basins. Alta Murgia shows many natural endoreic basin conditions in a quite flat morphology. In this environment, when intense rainfall events cover large areas and rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of soils and/or sinkholes, significant runoff amounts are produced and stored in the basins causing floods. Most of the natural endoreic basins are small and independent: while the majority of them continue functioning as endoreic even in presence of extreme events of high return time, others (quasi-endoreic), under the same circumstances can start contributing to other basins, due to exceeding their water storage capability. This way\n\nThe coupled effects of crouch gait and patella alta on tibiofemoral and patellofemoral cartilage loading in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrandon, Scott C E; Thelen, Darryl G; Smith, Colin R; Novacheck, Tom F; Schwartz, Michael H; Lenhart, Rachel L\n\n2018-02-01\n\nElevated tibiofemoral and patellofemoral loading in children who exhibit crouch gait may contribute to skeletal deformities, pain, and cessation of walking ability. Surgical procedures used to treat crouch frequently correct knee extensor insufficiency by advancing the patella. However, there is little quantitative understanding of how the magnitudes of crouch and patellofemoral correction affect cartilage loading in gait. We used a computational musculoskeletal model to simulate the gait of twenty typically developing children and fifteen cerebral palsy patients who exhibited mild, moderate, and severe crouch. For each walking posture, we assessed the influence of patella alta and baja on tibiofemoral and patellofemoral cartilage contact. Tibiofemoral and patellofemoral contact pressures during the stance phase of normal gait averaged 2.2 and 1.0â¯MPa. Crouch gait increased pressure in both the tibofemoral (2.6-4.3â¯MPa) and patellofemoral (1.8-3.3â¯MPa) joints, while also shifting tibiofemoral contact to the posterior tibial plateau. For extended-knee postures, normal patellar positions (Insall-Salvatti ratio 0.8-1.2) concentrated contact on the middle third of the patellar cartilage. However, in flexed knee postures, both normal and baja patellar positions shifted pressure toward the superior edge of the patella. Moving the patella into alta restored pressure to the middle region of the patellar cartilage as crouch increased. This work illustrates the potential to dramatically reduce tibiofemoral and patellofemoral cartilage loading by surgically correcting crouch gait, and highlights the interaction between patella position and knee posture in modulating the location of patellar contact during functional activities.

This Department has 1.2 million inhabitants (78% living in rural areas and 89% from indigenous communities) and in 2012, had a maternal mortality rate of 273 for every 100,000 live births. This m-health initiative is based on the provision of a cell phone to community facilitators (CFs). The CFs are volunteers in rural communities who perform health prevention, promotion and care. Thanks to the cell phone, the CFs have become tele-CFs who able to carry out consultations when they have questions; send full epidemiological and clinical information related to the cases they attend to; receive continuous training; and perform activities for the prevention and promotion of community health through distance learning sessions in the Q'eqchÃ­ and/or Poqomchi' languages. In this study, rural populations served by tele-CFs were selected as the intervention group while the control group was composed of the rural population served by CFs without Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools. As well as the achievement of important process results (116,275 medical consultations, monitoring of 6,783 pregnant women, and coordination of 2,014 emergency transfers), the project has demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in maternal mortality (pâ<â0.05) and in child mortality (pâ=â0.054) in the intervention group compared with rates in the control group. As a result of the telemedicine initiative, the intervention areas, which were selected for their high maternal and infant mortality rates, currently show maternal and child mortality indicators that are not only lower than the indicators in the control area, but also lower than the provincial average (which includes urban areas).

This paper evaluates the impact on maternal and neonatal mortality of a pregnancy care package for rural areas of developing countries with portable ultrasound and blood/urine tests. An observational study was conducted, with intervention and control groups not randomly assigned. Rural areas of the districts of Senahu, Campur and Carcha, in Alta Verapaz Department (Guatemala). The control group is composed by 747 pregnant women attended by the community facilitator, which is the common practice in rural Guatemala. The intervention group is composed by 762 pregnant women attended under the innovative Healthy Pregnancy project. That project strengthens the local prenatal care program, providing local nurses training, portable ultrasound equipment and blood and urine tests. The information of each pregnancy is registered in a medical exchange tool, and is later reviewed by a gynecology specialist to ensure a correct diagnosis and improve nurses training. No maternal deaths were reported within the intervention group, versus five cases in the control group. Regarding neonatal deaths, official data revealed a 64Â % reduction for neonatal mortality. A 37Â % prevalence of anemia was detected. Non-urgent referral was recommended to 70 pregnancies, being fetal malpresentation the main reported cause. Impact data on maternal mortality (reduction to zero) and neonatal mortality (NMR was reduced to 36Â %) are encouraging, although we are aware of the limitations of the study related to possible biasing and the small sample size. The major reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality provides promising prospects for these low-cost diagnostic procedures, which allow to provide high quality prenatal care in isolated rural communities of developing countries. This research was not registered because it is an observational study where the assignment of\n\nElectrodeposition of Al-Ta alloys in NaCl-KCl-AlCl3 molten salt containing TaCl5\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSato, Kazuki; Matsushima, Hisayoshi; Ueda, Mikito\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTo form Al-Ta alloys for high temperature oxidation resistance components, molten salt electrolysis was carried out in an AlCl3-NaCl-KCl melt containing TaCl5 at 423 K. The voltammogram showed two cathodic waves at 0.45 V and 0.7 V vs. Al/Al(III), which may correspond to reduction from Ta(V) to Ta(III) and from Ta(III) to tantalum metal, respectively. Electrodeposits of Al and Ta were obtained in the range from -0.05 to 0.3 V and the highest concentration of Ta in the electrodeposit was 72 at% at 0.3 V. With increasing Ta content in the alloy, the morphology of the electrodeposits became powdery and the particle size smaller.\n\nRealization of Vilnius UPXYZVS photometric system for AltaU42 CCD camera at the MAO NAS of Ukraine\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVid'Machenko, A. P.; Andruk, V. M.; Samoylov, V. S.; Delets, O. S.; Nevodovsky, P. V.; Ivashchenko, Yu. M.; Kovalchuk, G. U.\n\n2005-06-01\n\nThe description of two-inch glass filters of the Vilnius UPXYZVS photometric system, which are made at the Main Astronomical Observatory of NAS of Ukraine for AltaU42 CCD camera with format of 2048Ã2048 pixels, is presented in the paper. Reaction curves of instrumental system are shown. Estimations of minimal star's magnitudes for each filter's band in comparison with the visual V one are obtained. New software for automation of CCD frames processing is developed in program shell of LINUX/MIDAS/ROMAFOT. It is planned to carry out observations with the purpose to create the catalogue of primary UPXYZVS CCD standards in selected field of the sky for some radio-sources, globular and open clusters, etc. Numerical estimations of astrometric and photometric accuracy are obtained.\n\nFluxgate Magnetometry on the Experimental Albertan Satellite #1 (Ex-Alta-1) CubeSat Mission: Steps Toward a Magnetospheric Constellation Mission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMann, I.

K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMaking low noise magnetic measurements is a significant challenge to the use of cube-satellite (CubeSat) platforms for scientific constellation class missions for studies of geospace. We describe the design, validation, and test, and initial on-orbit results from a miniature, low-mass, low-power, and low-magnetic noise boom-mounted fluxgate magnetometer flown on the University of Alberta Experimental Albertan Satellite #1 (Ex-Alta-1) Cube Satellite, launched in 2017 from the International Space Station as part of the QB50 constellation mission. The miniature instrument achieves a magnetic noise floor of 150-200 pT/âHz at 1 Hz, consumes 400 mW of power, has a mass of 121 g (sensor and boom), stows on the hull, and deploys on a 60 cm boom from a three-unit CubeSat reducing the noise from the onboard reaction wheel to less than 1.5 nT at the sensor. The instrument's capabilities are being demonstrated and validated in space with flight on Ex-Alta-1. We present on-orbit data from the boom-deployment and initial operations of the fluxgate sensor and illustrate the potential scientific returns and utility of using CubeSats carrying such fluxgate magnetometers to constitute a magnetospheric constellation mission. We further illustrate the value of scientific constellations using example data from the low-Earth orbit European"
