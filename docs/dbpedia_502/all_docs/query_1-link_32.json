        "text": "The TF-9DHD Infeed/Throughfeed Centerless Grinder uses computer controls to grind both hard and soft materials including catheters, medical guidewires, and spinal cord stimulators. Inside the compact footprint is a 15HP main spindle motor powering an 8.625” wide work wheel combining to remove more material faster, and with better surface finishes, than similar machines with narrower grinding wheels. The TF-9DHD is designed to enhance productivity through a simple control interface and automation integration.\n\nThe CAM.2 Micro Grinder can produce flats, radiuses, needle points, and non-linear shapes; the perfect machine to grind complex medical guidewires, dental parts, and small precision parts for various industries. Combining the latest in multi-axis servo motor control, submicron positioning, and an intuitive 15″ HMI, the CAM.2 offers unmatched performance. With the CAM.2’s full-fledged G-code underpinnings, direct integration with CAD/CAM packages is seamless. Previously unproduceable parts can be made easily, with minimal setup time, and with limited operator training.\n\nThe Tridex PGS-100 Pointing and Material Handling System manufactures a wide variety of medical device points on tubing or solid wire, such as medical needles, using electrochemical grinding technology (ECG). It can interface with tooling for secondary operations such as electro-polishing, bead blasting, and slotting without losing point orientation. Capable of producing tri-bevel, back bevel, trocar, diamond, stylet, Franseen, and custom points with minimal setup time.\n\nThe Magnum is a semi-automatic catheter tipping manufacturing system that offers closed-loop control, minimizes cycle time with a PID loop and maximizes heat control. Operators control heat, part feeding, part clamping and air-cooling on a user-friendly touchscreen, achieving precision part feeding and placement with a programmed Servo motor and leadscrew drive. Product changeovers and die cleaning are an easy process with one-step, quick-change tooling integrates with the Quantum.\n\nSYNEO Accu-Drill and Accu-Punch equipment applications are the premier solutions for drilling flash-free, burr-free holes in a wide range of single and multi-lumen tubing materials such as Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), PEEK, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Pebax®.\n\nAccu-Drill and Accu-Punch machine solutions are utilized in clean room manufacturing environments where catheter punching and hole drilling applications exist. SYNEO hole making solutions are capable of holes as small as .005”, and offer capabilities such as multi-lumen location, hole quality inspection, and drilling holes between cross-sections of braided material.\n\nOur Open Quad Catheter Laminator machine uses recirculated hot air to shrink thermoplastic tubing down to a minimal diameter to produce catheters. Four catheters can be processed at once using two heating chambers with two process areas in each reflow chamber. The machine operates vertically to minimize the required floor space. By improving the accuracy of all controlled parameters, this machine can increase productivity through reduced rejects and faster processing speeds. The programming is flexible to allow new products to be made with the same machine.\n\nCath-Tech™ Reflow (or Laminating) machines are built using our signature convection heating process that provides superior results and is designed to maintain a consistent process, resulting in fewer product issues, increased production, and better yields. This is achieved through precise heat and speed to melt tubing segments combining the TFE liner and braid to make one cohesive catheter shaft.\n\nR&D Reflow machines can be customized to fit your specific requirements and support end production goals.\n\nChoose from three different machine types: Chamber • Clam Shell • Split Die\n\nMulti-filar, variable, and continuous mandrel length, machine vision, and other custom features are available. Our systems can wind coils using .0001” diameter wire on a .010” mandrel using our closed-loop filament and mandrel tension control systems. System flexibility enables the filar tension to be recipe-controlled from 5 to 300 grams during the entire wind. New double head machines can wind up to four (4) wires on each mandrel and up to eight (8) wires on a single head machine.\n\n+ Double Vision Coil Winder\n\n+ Multi-Filar Coil Winder\n\nThe 202 Series Automated Tube Cutter uses quick-change tooling and advanced cutting techniques to accurately cut tubing to programmable lengths. Accu-Cut machines ensure a perfect square cut, free from burrs, on the proximal and distal end of the tube. Our automated tube and wire cutting machines are designed to enhance functionality and application breadth, including recipe programming, automatic scrap sorting, and end-slit capabilities.\n\nThe PTF 240 will pleat and fold balloons up to 200mm. The system has two inflation and deflation connections allowing the processing of the product after the pleat and fold steps. The quick exchange pleater modules can switch from a 3 fold to 4, 5 or 6 fold within seconds.\n\nThe BFM-500-S2 balloon forming machine uses full servo control on the proximal and distal axis providing fast precise stretching of the parisons during the balloon blowing process. The axis have force control and individual loadcell systems enabling the operator to monitor the forces and control parameters.\n\nThe PSM-400-D Parison Stretching Machine, designed to be used in conjunction with the BFM-500-S, can stretch parisons with forces up to 500N. Its innovative pre-heating system ensures the stretching dies o not damage the parison material before or during the stretch."
