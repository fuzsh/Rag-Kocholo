        "text": "The PSM unit sieves and separates metal powder under inert gas conditions. Metal powder collected from overflow cans in the selective laser melting system is manually supplied to the sieving station. The sieved GO grain and oversized powder are collected in separate cans underneath the system for further use.\n\nThe sieving process runs automatically without influence on the running build process, reducing ancillary times. To support and speed up the sieving procedure, an additional ultrasonic cleaning device can be added."
