She looked at me thoughtfully for a moment, shrugged her shoulders, and said “No.” “But,” she added—probably in response to the look of stunned disappointment on my face—“you can work on the Izapan style.” “Oh!” I exclaimed, enormously relieved and blissfully ignorant of the implications of this mandate. And so began a journey through the complexities of the Late Preclassic period (300 BC–AD 250) in ancient Mesoamerica, and a visually powerful corpus of objects that was created at that time. While the dissertation explored a series of thematic continuities in Late Preclassic Izapan style monuments, this study moves beyond a primarily iconographic focus and considers the monuments not only within their immediate architectural setting but also within the greater political and economic matrix of Late Preclassic Mesoamerica. This book privileges the monuments and an art historical viewpoint in a way that departs from previous scholarship on Late Preclassic Mesoamerica, which traditionally has emphasized archaeological data, typologies, chronologies, and culturally circumscribed regions. Rather than viewing the monuments merely as a reflection of the dramatic changes taking place during this period—such as the forging of a codified language of divine kingship or a widespread Mesoamerican exchange in hieroglyphic writing\n\nT\n\nand literacy, for instance—the approach used here considers the monuments as one of many forces directly responsible for motivating and structuring such significant developments. That said, this is still a tentative inquiry, which will need to be modified in the future to accommodate new monuments, new hieroglyphic decipherments, and new archaeological discoveries. The nature of Precolumbian research is dynamic, ever evolving at a pace that seems to increase with each passing year. Art history’s role within this process, especially with regards to southeastern Mesoamerica and the region that witnessed the rise of Maya civilization, also is developing, only having begun in earnest with Herbert J. Spinden’s 1913 A Study of Maya Art, Its Subject Matter and Historical Development. While fitting the sculpture and built environment of the Late Preclassic period into an art historical framework is an ongoing task, this study is a step in that direction. Likewise, although it explores just one subset of monuments from this period, and focuses on only one of many regions in Mesoamerica that witnessed enormous transition at this time, it does so from a variety of vantage points that more fully articulate the sophisticated role of sculpture in literally giving voice to networks of elite communication and exchange at a specific juncture in Mesoamerican history. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction to the Late Preclassic period in southeastern Mesoamerica by considering some of the major cultural and economic developments that characterized this segment of history. While it emphasizes the patterns of continuity that archaeological\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage x\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nand art historical data reveal during this time period, it also addresses lingering, more enigmatic questions, such as the contrasting ways in which elites at neighboring sites chose to express authority, some through monumental sculpture and others through purely architectonic means. It also contains a brief summary of the spread of hieroglyphic literacy during the Late Preclassic period. The Late Preclassic was the first epoch in which certain ancient Mesoamerican groups chose to express their histories in the form of writing, and the sharing of script traditions and associated iconography throughout southeastern Mesoamerica reveals critical insights into well-established communication spheres of this time. Chapter 2 places the site of Izapa within this Late Preclassic milieu and focuses more exclusively on the Pacific piedmont region. It summarizes the archaeological history of Izapa throughout the Preclassic period while also considering the site’s location at the nexus of two distinct cultural regions, those of the Maya to the east and the Mixe-Zoque to the west. This setting undoubtedly fostered the development of the Izapan style, which appears to have transcended linguistic and ethnic boundaries and become a lingua franca of its time. It also considers the origin and function of the stela form, which was central to the public dissemination of symbolic and formal information during the Late Preclassic period. The Izapan style reached its fullest maturation within the medium of carved stone stelae, which were employed by elites at numerous sites to organize and define the parameters of their sacred site centers. In a somewhat different vein, Chapter 3 explores the history of the research surrounding Izapa and the Izapan style. It begins with the first mention of Izapa and its monuments by scholars in the 1930s and continues through the present. Importantly, a historiographical approach such as this frames discussions of Izapa and the Izapan style against the broader history of Mesoamerican scholarship and provides insight into general assumptions, some more accurate than others, that have been assigned to this unique stylistic and iconographic phenomenon. The chapter also\n\nX\n\naddresses thorny questions of style versus iconography, which provide the basis for any art historical discussion of monuments and imagery. It also reveals the importance of an art historical methodology for revealing paths of communication that can be overshadowed by conflicting archaeological, linguistic, and ethnohistoric data. Chapter 4 directs attention to the motif of bird-costumed figures within the corpus of Izapan style monuments, a theme that becomes the focus of the remainder of the book. It attempts to place this imagery within the pictorial and conceptual trajectory of Preclassic and Classic period Mesoamerican art. Particular attention is paid throughout to notions of supernatural contact, their manifestation in the artistic record, and their deeply complex relationship to expressions of formalized authority in ancient Mesoamerica. This chapter asks as many questions as it answers, problematizing issues of supernatural communication in relationship to the Late Preclassic Izapan style and inviting further exploration into the conceptual foundations of rulership during this period. Having outlined a broad historical framework in the first four chapters, I focus in Chapter 5 exclusively on the rich repertoire of imagery, from Izapa and elsewhere during the Late Preclassic period, of avian costumed figures. In particular, it considers a range of mythological, hieroglyphic, archaeological, and ethnohistoric data that provide a compelling context within which this imagery can be understood. It also moves beyond purely formal or iconographic discussions and attempts to frame this imagery—which depicts the vivid performances of rulers in the costume and persona of a well-known bird deity—against well-established Mesoamerican traditions of supernatural communication and divinely sanctioned authority. Chapter 6 considers the context of these monuments and their function in physically structuring the ritual centers of Late Preclassic sites. The discussion deliberately underscores the role of the carved monuments, particularly stelae, as protagonists within a dynamic environment of sculpture, architecture, and human actors. Emphasis is on the site of Izapa and the ways rulers defined and\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage xi\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nmanipulated their performative environment through the vehicle of sculpture during the Late Preclassic period. Yet the chapter also broaches broader discussions of the nature of sacred space and how it served to articulate societal order. It further considers the influence of mythological traditions in constructing the built environment and the vehicles, in particular astronomy, through which these myths were shared with striking consistency across time and space. Lastly, Chapter 7 explores the economic implications of this recurring motif of rulers, costumed as birds, which was featured at a number of Late Preclassic sites. This chapter, more than the others, is an exploratory step toward understanding the potential economic ramifications of these avian rituals that figured so prominently into monumental sculptural programs of the time. It links patterns of avian performance, detectable in the art historical record, to matrices of political, economic, and supernatural exchange. While postulating a relationship between ritual behavior and trade is not new, the suggestion that avian performance and its expression in the sculptural record of Late Preclassic Mesoamerica was one aspect of a sophisticated system of elite exchange is novel. As stated at the beginning of this preface, the initial stages of this project began as dissertation research under the guidance of the late Linda Schele, in the Department of Art and Art History at the University of Texas at Austin. The fact that the project has evolved considerably over the ensuing years by no means denies the critical role she played in its early development. Linda always sought out the “big picture,” and so, too, this book attempts to place Izapa and the Izapan style on the grander stage of Mesoamerican history. I am equally grateful for the chance encounter many years ago with an art history course taught by Andrea Stone at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Andrea’s pivotal role in introducing me to the realm of Precolumbian art, and the many ways in which we can approach it, is inestimable. I also owe enormous debts of gratitude to David Freidel and Kent Reilly, both of whom watched this project develop from its\n\ninception and offered unending encouragement and sage advice throughout. A number of friends and colleagues read and commented on early chapters and drafts of this book. In particular, Michael Love, Heather Orr, Elizabeth Pope, and Kathryn Reese-Taylor went beyond the call of friendship and graciously read the book manuscript in its entirety; their discerning eyes and detailed comments contributed immeasurably to the final form of this book. Kathryn Reese-Taylor and Elizabeth Reese Baloutine accompanied me on a research trip to Izapa and its environs, and I thank them for the shared insights, shared photographs, and the good company. Michael Love generously contributed his extensive knowledge of the Pacific Coast during the Preclassic period throughout the completion of this project and provided guided tours from coastal La Blanca into the piedmont of the Pacific slope. Isabel Love provided entertainment and laughter. In addition, Flora Clancy contributed insight and valuable resources. For epigraphic and linguistic advice, I turned to the expertise of David Mora-Marín and Kathryn Josserand. I also thank Allen Christenson, John Pohl, and Eugenia Robinson for their thoughtful comments on particular portions of the manuscript. Matthew Looper provided enormously helpful comments for the final draft, for which I thank him as well. Numerous colleagues also shared their thoughts on the Late Preclassic period in general. Many of them were participants in informal sessions dedicated to the Late Preclassic period that I organized each year in conjunction with the annual Maya Meetings at the University of Texas at Austin, and I thank them for their willingness to openly share ideas and engage in lively debate about many issues. They include Fred Bove, Kat Brown, Palma Buttles Valdez, John Clark, Virginia Fields, Jim Garber, Hal Green, Richard Hansen, John Justeson, Terrence Kaufman, Peter Keeler, Jennifer Mathews, Mike McBride, Dorie Reents-Budet, Dominique Rissolo, Travis Stanton, Juan Antonio Valdés, and Fred Valdez. In addition, conversations on a variety of art historical, archaeological, and epigraphic issues with XI\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage xii\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nBarbara Arroyo, Marilyn Beaudry, Michael Carrasco, Liwy Grazioso Sierra, Stephen Houston, Kerry Hull, Jonathan Kaplan, Justin Kerr, Matthew Looper, Enrique Méndez Torres, Elizabeth Newsome, Rob Rosenswig, Eugenia Robinson, Bill Saturno, David Stuart, Karl Taube, and Marc Zender were greatly appreciated. Generosity also came in the form of photographs and drawings. John Clark, Director of the New World Archaeological Foundation of Brigham Young University, provided new drawings of the Izapa monuments and other related sculptures for this analysis; I thank him as well for comments provided for the final draft of the manuscript. I also thank Elizabeth Reese Baloutine, Francisco Estrada Belli, Flora Clancy, Constance Cortez, David Freidel, John Graham, Jonathan Kaplan, Justin and Barbara Kerr, Matthew Looper, Michael Love, Peter Mathews, Andrew McDonald, John Montgomery, David MoraMarín, Kent Reilly, David Schele, Robert Sharer, Jeff Stomper, Karl Taube, and Mark Van Stone, all of whom granted me permission to use various drawings or photos throughout this manuscript. I am grateful to Marion Popenoe de Hatch, Christa Schieber de Lavarreda, and Miguel Orrego for providing access to images and information concerning the ongoing excavations at the site of Takalik Abaj in Guatemala. David Stuart generously provided access to drawings from the Corpus of Hieroglyphic Inscriptions at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. George Stuart’s encyclopedic knowledge of archival photos from early excavations sponsored by National Geographic and the Smithsonian Institution was invaluable, and I thank him for the resources and knowledge that he shared. David Schele and the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies (FAMSI) graciously facilitated access to the drawing archive of Linda Schele. A number of institutions welcomed my requests for images and also deserve thanks, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the National Geographic Society, and the Smithsonian Institution. This work benefited from a University of Texas at Austin Summer Research Appointment, which\n\nXII\n\nallowed me to focus uninterruptedly (if such a thing is possible with two small children) on creating an initial draft of this manuscript in 2002. A John D. Murchison Fellowship in Art in the Department of Art and Art History in 2004 facilitated completion of the project, and I am also grateful for a University Cooperative Society Subvention Grant awarded by the University of Texas at Austin. I owe a special debt of gratitude to several important benefactors of the Department of Art and Art History and the Mesoamerican Center at the University of Texas at Austin, in particular Bettye and Bill Nowlin and Sherry Smith. A very warm thank you also goes to Jane and Michael Scott and Anne Ashmun for an unforgettable trip to Mexico that was filled with adventure and done with style. Welcome assistance in the form of faculty travel grants was also provided by the Office of the Vice President and Dean of Graduate Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Within the Department of Art and Art History itself, I extend my sincerest thanks to Department Chair Kenneth Hale and all who facilitated departmental travel, awards, and research conducted in conjunction with this project. I also thank my colleagues in the department, who provided a stimulating environment in which to ponder and pursue questions such as those addressed in this book. The staff at the University of Texas Press was endlessly supportive, deftly guiding this manuscript through the various stages of review, editing, and production. In particular, I am indebted to the expertise of Theresa May, Assistant Director and Editor-in-Chief, and Allison Faust, Associate Editor. I also extend my warmest thanks to G. Daniel López, who first came to my attention as an advanced undergraduate student deeply interested in all things Precolumbian. His technological expertise quickly became evident, and the vast majority of illustrations in this book are the result of his superb efforts at creating maps, scanning, designing, and compiling images. Closer to home, I thank my family.

Things were not getting simpler, or cruder, or increasingly formative. —Coe and McGinn 1963\n\nN\n\nIntroduction The Late Preclassic period in Mesoamerica, which dates from 300 BC to approximately AD 250, witnessed the florescence of a unique mode of artistic expression known as the Izapan style. The term “Izapan style” takes its name from the site of Izapa in the hills above the Pacific coastal plain, or Soconusco region, of modern Chiapas, Mexico (fig. 1.1). The convention of erecting carved stone altars and stelae in pairs in courtyards surrounded by platform mounds first emerged during the Late Preclassic period in this region (fig. 1.2).1 The monuments at Izapa are perhaps best known for their dense, figural compositions carved in lowrelief that bear stylistic and iconographic continuities with earlier Olmec art and the later art of the Classic Maya (fig. 1.3).2 The stylistic and iconographic traits that comprise the Izapan style, however, also extend to contemporaneous stone carvings from sites located throughout the highlands and coastal piedmont of Chiapas and Guatemala, along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and into the valleys of central Veracruz, Mexico.3 Despite the fact that monuments carved in the Izapan style are found throughout a broad and ethnically diverse geographic region of Mesoamerica, their repertoire of images, symbols, narratives, and stylistic traits coheres into a\n\nremarkably consistent sculptural corpus that provides a unique glimpse into the types of messages that were broadcast across the sacred landscapes of Late Preclassic Mesoamerica. These messages articulated political ideologies and complex cosmological themes, and formed a shared language of power that was employed by rulers in a dynamic Late Preclassic communication sphere. The focus of this study is the content, context, and active role of a specific subset of these monuments, which depict rulers performing in the guise of an avian deity, within the physical geography of Late Preclassic site centers. In recent years, scholars have made dramatic strides in understanding the function of monumental sculpture as an ideological tool—one that literally gave voice to potent messages of authority and the relationship of humans to the cosmos— among the Maya and Aztecs of the Classic and Postclassic periods. However, the parallel role of sculpture during the Late Preclassic period has been relatively neglected. Traditionally, the Late Preclassic period has been understood as a strictly developmental period that fueled the later cultural florescence of the Classic period. This period’s alternative designation, “Late Formative,” is likewise laden with an evolutionary bias that connotes a lack of maturation and sophistication.4 More recently, scholarship addressing the archaeology,\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 2\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nFig. 1.1. Map of Mesoamerica showing location of major sites mentioned in text.\n\nlinguistics, and iconography of this period has demonstrated that it was, indeed, more than simply “formative.”5 In fact, the Late Preclassic period represents a mature expression of civilization that prefigures the better understood and more clearly defined Classic-period manifestation. As Joyce and Grove (1999a: 2) stated in the introduction to their investigation of social patterns in Mesoamerica, “Every later Mesoamerican society developed within a framework that was laid in the Preclassic. The material features that we see archaeologically as typical of Mesoamerica took their essential form during this period.”\n\n2\n\nIn order to understand fully the role of the Izapan style phenomenon within this matrix, its presence within the political, economic, and social landscape of the Late Preclassic period must be determined. It is the premise of this study that the messages encoded on Izapan style monuments were part of a currency of elite ideological exchange that was shared across southeastern Mesoamerica and into regions to the north and west. Moreover, this novel mode of artistic expression structured and gave tangible form to notions of Late Preclassic political authority, economic and ideological interchange, and social cohesion. As a prelude to an\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 3\n\nAn Introduction to the Late Preclassic Period\n\nin-depth examination of the Izapan style phenomenon, this chapter explores several of the major cultural developments that characterized the Late Preclassic period, some of which demonstrate patterns of continuity while others are more difficult to define. Issues such as the spread of hieroglyphic literacy, networks of communication, and displays of conspicuous consumption—which include the erection of monumental sculpture and architecture—are considered.\n\nThe Archaeological Picture Archaeological excavations, particularly since the 1960s, have revolutionized our understanding of the extent and complexity of the Late Preclassic period in eastern Mesoamerica. For example, in the Maya region—which includes Guatemala, Belize, the eastern portion of Mexico and the western boundaries of Honduras and El Salvador (fig. 1.1)—the Late Preclassic was a vibrant period\n\nFig. 1.3. Izapa Stela 5. Photo by Richard Stewart. From Stirling 1943: Plate 52. Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nFig. 1.2.View of stela-altar pair at Izapa. Stela 3 and Altar 2.

Archaeological data indicate that populations, particularly in the areas of northern Belize and the central Peten, were expanding.6 Corresponding to this population growth was an increase in the construction of monumental architecture, more massive and ornate than in the preceding Middle Preclassic period. This is best evidenced by the Tigre pyramid at El Mirador, Peten, Guatemala, which is estimated to have covered an area of 19,600 square meters (Hansen 1998: 76; 2000: 62). Concurrently, the density of structures also increased in site centers and their surrounding plazas, establishing a pattern of residential architecture that would continue throughout the Classic period (Demarest 1984; Hansen 1998: 77). In order to support these burgeoning popula-\n\n3\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 4\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\ntions, intensive agriculture was undertaken. In some regions, cultivated fields often were irrigated by means of hydraulic engineering systems that testify to sophisticated, developing technologies. Complementing the Late Preclassic economy were specialized communities such as that of Colha, which capitalized on available natural resources by mass-producing stone tools from local chert sources (Hester, Shafer, and Eaton 1994). Recent investigations suggest that the Colha elite were involved as well in the production and consumption of cacao, the chocolate bean used to create a beverage that was consumed primarily by the ruling elite during the Classic period (Hurst et al. 2002: 289). Patterns of ritual behavior, such as the ceremonial use of cacao, certainly were exchanged in conjunction with utilitarian and luxury goods during this Late Preclassic period, laying the foundations for ritualized activities better documented during the Classic period.7 In fact, extensive trade networks linked various Late Preclassic Maya and non-Maya sites and gave rise to regional trading centers. For example, the location of Cerros in northern Belize at the mouth of the New River where it empties into Chetumal Bay enabled it to control trade between the coast and inland.8 Upriver was the site of Lamanai, whose Late Preclassic population availed itself of rich aquatic resources and riverine transportation routes. Lamanai was strategically located to take advantage of trade routes that extended down into the Southern Lowlands and Peten as well as up into the Northern Lowlands of modern Campeche and Quintana Roo (Guderjan and Williams-Beck 2001; Pendergast 1981; Powis 2002). In the Peten, archaeological assemblages from sites such as Nakbe and El Mirador demonstrate that the elites there had entered into systems of economic interaction through which they received obsidian from highland Guatemala and strombus shells from the Caribbean (Clark and Hansen 2001: 15). Archaeological data throughout these regions attest to the considerable control that Maya elites exerted during the Late Preclassic period in the long-distance trade of specific commodities, including jade and other greenstones,\n\n4\n\nobsidian and stone tools, pyrite, strombus and spondylus shells, and even feathers from exotic birds such as the quetzal. Throughout the Maya area during this time period, the archaeological record has preserved innumerable acts of conspicuous consumption that were invested with ritual significance. These range from special burial treatment replete with high-status grave goods to caches of precious objects such as jade and greenstone. On a grander scale, they include the long causeways, or sacbeob, that linked site cores to their peripheries and accommodated ritual processions. Sacbeob are, after all, as Lekson (n.d.) described for the American Southwest, “long, linear monuments that we call roads.” They also include the monumental stone sculpture and magnificently adorned stucco architectural facades that required the expertise of highly skilled artisans. These examples testify to a considerable degree of economic power exercised by the elite, who commanded labor and controlled limited resources in both public and private domains.9 However, elite manipulation of sculpture and architecture was more than just a reactionary response to economic well-being or an ostentatious display of wealth: these forms of artistic expression carried social, political, and cosmological messages that structured the space and worldview of the inhabitants of these Late Preclassic Maya sites.10 A comparable scenario characterized the Pacific coastal plains and piedmont during the Late Preclassic period. This region (fig. 1.1), which stretches from Chiapas through Guatemala and into western El Salvador, was home to both ethnic Maya and Mixe-Zoque peoples, among others.11 Certain sites, such as Izapa and Takalik Abaj, represented critically important crossroads of communication during the Late Preclassic between Mayan speakers to the east and MixeZoquean-speaking peoples to the west. These sites also occupied advantageous locations along communication and trade routes between the Pacific Coast and the interior. Izapa, for example, appears to have been an important Late Preclassic political center within\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nChapter\n\nFigure 1.4.

It reached the apex of its growth during the Late Preclassic period, which was marked by massive construction and sculptural activity. Like their Maya neighbors to the east, the elite at Izapa—who may have spoken a Mixe-Zoquean language12—participated in similar ritualized acts of conspicuous consumption that included, most notably, the construction of pyramids and elaborate plazas lined with ornately carved stelae and altars (fig. 1.4). Importantly, many of the symbols and themes carved upon the monuments were not unique to Izapa, but were shared by other sites such as Takalik Abaj approximately fifty kilometers to the east. Takalik Abaj, which already by the Middle Preclassic period possessed a significant array of Olmec-style sculpture, appears to have been ethnically Maya by the Late Preclassic period.13 It, too, rose to a position of regional prominence during the Late Preclassic, during which time extensive construction of plazas, terraces, and monumental structures took place. Like Izapa, the public spaces of the site were filled with monuments, commissioned by the elite, which featured rulers and mythic scenes that bear intriguing affinities to specific sculptures at Izapa. Takalik Abaj’s location in the sloping piedmont, on a natural communication corridor between the adjacent Guatemalan Highlands and the coastal plain, undoubtedly contributed to its importance within the Late Preclassic political landscape. The formal and iconographic relationships between its corpus of Late Preclassic monuments and those at Izapa also confirm that a specific and recurring repertoire of symbols and narratives successfully transcended political boundaries and ethnic divisions at this time. Moreover, this vocabulary of power—which not only stated a ruler’s political might, but also advertised his control over the supernatural realm—was literally carved in stone and placed in hallowed site centers where it formulated and structured the ideological currents of the Late Preclassic period. Also participating in this dynamic interaction\n\n6\n\nsphere were the elites of Kaminaljuyu, whose site dominated the Guatemalan Highlands region. Recent epigraphic investigations indicate that the inhabitants of Kaminaljuyu spoke a Mayan language (Fahsen 1999, 2000; Valdés and Wright 2004).14 Importantly, certain monuments from that site display the same symbolic vocabulary found at Izapa and Takalik Abaj, which strongly indicates that it, too, was an active participant in this southeastern Mesoamerican communication sphere (Guernsey Kappelman 1997, 2001; Kaplan 1995; Parsons 1986). Contributing to Kaminaljuyu’s success was its optimal location at a natural pass between the Pacific Coast and interior of Guatemala. Recent excavations at the site also have demonstrated the presence of elaborate systems of water management and hydraulic engineering that enabled the establishment of a stable agricultural base that, in turn, attracted a growing population and contributed to developing commercial interests (Barrientos 1999; Popenoe de Hatch et al. 2002; Valdés 2002; Valdés and Popenoe de Hatch 1996; Valdés and Wright 2004). Kaminaljuyu’s role as the principal polity within the Southern Highlands appears to have been closely linked to its control of obsidian distribution into the Maya Lowlands of the Peten from two sources in the Guatemalan Highlands, San Martín Jilotepeque and El Chayal, both located not far from Kaminaljuyu (Michels 1979; Nelson 1985: 39).15 During the Late Preclassic period, obsidian was imported primarily from San Martín Jilotepeque, revealing a shift away from El Chayal, which had been the dominant source of obsidian prior to this period (Clark, Lee, and Salcedo 1989). Most tellingly, obsidian from San Martín Jilotepeque appears in the Late Preclassic archaeological record of sites not only in the Guatemalan Highlands and Maya Lowlands, but also along the Pacific Coast and the interior of Chiapas, indicating the extent of this network of distribution (Clark, Lee, and Salcedo 1989: 275–276). Importantly, as Clark, Lee, and Salcedo (1989: 272–275) discussed, when the availability of high-quality Guatemalan Highland obsidian fluctuated, another important source was the volcano Taju-\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nAn Introduction to the Late Preclassic Period\n\nmulco, located just to the east of Izapa in Guatemala. Although Tajumulco obsidian was of a lesser quality, it nonetheless was used throughout the Late Preclassic period, particularly at Izapa, as an alternative resource. Evidence such as this indicates that changing patterns in the control and distribution of these natural resources were directly linked to the evolving political landscape of Late Preclassic Mesoamerica.16 At Kaminaljuyu the control of limited resources and regional trade routes had immediate societal ramifications, as evidenced by two extraordinarily rich Late Preclassic tombs at the site.17 These interments, which date to consecutive construction phases, were placed within Mound E-III-3, the largest structure at Kaminaljuyu. The scale of Mound E-III-3, as well as its function as a mortuary monument for what appear to represent two successive rulers (Shook and Popenoe de Hatch 1999: 304), indicates that Kaminaljuyu’s political power, by this point in time, was concentrated in the hands of individual rulers who wielded the power to commission—or coerce—the construction of monumental architecture (cf. Shook and Kidder 1952; Valdés and Rodriguez 1999: 145; Valdés and Wright 2004). Likewise, exquisitely carved monuments from the same Late Preclassic period at Kaminaljuyu bear witness to the messages of authority that were transmitted throughout the ritual precinct. Kaminaljuyu Stela 10 (fig. 1.5), for instance, depicts a standing figure who wields a chipped flint ax remarkably similar to one recovered from Tomb I in Mound E-III-3, which suggests that the individual portrayed was one of the Late Preclassic rulers interred within the structure (Parsons 1986: 66; Shook and Kidder 1952: fig. 79c). Images such as Stela 10 articulated a message of political authority to local populations but also undoubtedly operated within a broader, regional network of rhetoric, competition, and exchange.18 For example, Monument 1 at Chocolá—a contemporaneous Late Preclassic site located on the sloping piedmont between Takalik Abaj and Kaminaljuyu—compares closely to Kaminaljuyu Stela 10 (Parsons 1986: 70; Prater 1989: 128;\n\nFigure 1.5. Kaminaljuyu Stela 10. Photo by Michael Love.\n\nValdés et al. 2004). Elites at Chocolá, like their neighbors, appear to have taken advantage of the site’s location along an important communication corridor; this same setting enabled the cultivation of cacao in the rich agricultural fields of the piedmont. Recent excavations at the site have also revealed extensive water management systems, artificial terracing, and a carefully orchestrated astronomical orientation for the central ceremonial precinct (Kaplan, Valdés, and Gutiérrez n.d.; Paredes Umaña et al. n.d.). Another region absolutely critical to this Late Preclassic communication sphere was the northern Maya Highlands, which straddled a natural communication route between the southern Guatemalan Highlands and the Maya Lowlands to the north (Kidder 1940; Sharer 1989: 258; Sharer and Sedat 1987, 1999). Sites such as El Portón in the Salamá Valley witnessed increasing sociopolitical complexity during the Middle to Late Preclassic transition, as evidenced by largescale ceremonial centers and sculpture (Sharer and\n\n7\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 8\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nSedat 1973, 1987, 1999). El Portón Monument 1 (fig. 1.6A), for instance, bears an early hieroglyphic inscription, while its form attests to the site’s participation in the rapidly expanding stela phenomenon that characterized the end of the Middle Preclassic and gained momentum in the ensuing Late Preclassic period. Paths of communication throughout Late Preclassic Mesoamerica also extended into the region traditionally referred to as the “southeastern periphery,” which included southeastern Guatemala, western Honduras, and El Salvador.19 For example, the site of Chalchuapa, El Salvador, which is located approximately 120 kilometers southeast of Kaminaljuyu and was first occupied during the Early Preclassic period, became a focal point of construction activity during the Late Preclassic period (Sharer 1978). At that time a large pyramid and a series of plazas and ceremonial platforms were erected and accompanied by monumental stone sculpture, an example of which, Monument 1, contains an early Maya hieroglyphic inscription (fig. 1.6B) (Sharer 1974).\n\nAlthough Monument 1 is stylistically distinct from Izapan monuments, it demonstrates Chalchuapa’s participation in emerging Late Preclassic writing systems (Graham 1971).20 Without a doubt, the archaeological evidence and iconographic record of shared symbols and themes clearly demonstrate corridors of influence and communication throughout southeastern Mesoamerica. However, these paths also extended to the north and west, stretching through the Upper Grijalva River region of Chiapas and into portions of Veracruz. In these Mixe-Zoque regions, at sites such as Chiapa de Corzo and Tres Zapotes, there is evidence of interaction at many different levels, including shared ceramic assemblages as well as common symbol systems on their monumental sculpture.21 In particular, the practice of erecting carved stone stelae is well documented at the site of Chiapa de Corzo (Lee 1969). There, several stelae, each intricately carved with abstract horizontal designs, compare closely to stelae from Izapa (fig. 1.7). In both cases, these designs mimic textiles, and bear testimony to shared iconographic\n\nFigure 1.6.

Of particular pertinence to this study is the fact that many of the symbols invoked across southeastern Mesoamerica as well as to the north and west carried specific associations with the office of rulership and were part of Late Preclassic political dialogues in a variety of linguistic regions. Perhaps even more importantly, analysis of such symbol systems, the monuments on which they appear, and their context within the built environment provides valuable insight into patterns of ritual behavior that were held in common by Late Preclassic elites. In other words, ephemeral events such as ritual performances were preserved through a dynamic visual vocabulary of motifs, shapes, and mediums. Accordingly, these monuments and their repertoire of symbols represent more than mute testimony, written in stone, to events that were soon forgotten. They must be understood as protagonists—albeit stone ones— that structured sacred space and delivered power-\n\nful messages to a diverse Late Preclassic audience. Nonetheless, despite evidence of broad communication networks and their implications with regards to rulership, the nature of Late Preclassic ideological expressions remains enigmatic. For example, along the Guatemalan coast only about forty kilometers southwest of Takalik Abaj, the large urban center of El Ujuxte also developed during the Late Preclassic period (Love 1999a, 2002a, 2002b). However, in stark contrast to regional neighbors such as Takalik Abaj and Izapa, El Ujuxte produced no known monumental carved stone sculpture during its florescence.23 Such a situation challenges assumptions about how best to define the character of a Late Preclassic, southeastern Mesoamerican interaction sphere.24 While most of this expansive site was carefully laid out according to an astronomically oriented gridlike pattern—surely attesting to some form of centralized authority, as Love (1998, 1999a: 146, 2002a) suggested—the elite at El Ujuxte did not express notions of power and authority through the medium of monumental carved sculpture or hieroglyphic inscriptions. Yet, the very sophistication of their urban landscape is equal to, or even surpasses, that of other primary centers that did employ monumental sculptural\n\n9\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 10\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nthe environment can emerge. And this picture, despite its gaps and incongruities, is not one of an unsophisticated “formative” landscape that pales next to the accomplishments of the “mature” Classic period. Rather, the evidence reveals a dynamic, multiethnic interaction sphere that included not only the dissemination of tangible goods, but the communication of symbolic ideas as well.27\n\nThe Advent of Hieroglyphic Writing\n\nFigure 1.8. Example of Middle Preclassic iconic system and the earliestknown Long Count date on a Late Preclassic stela:A,The Humboldt Celt (drawing by F. Kent Reilly III); B, Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (drawing by author after Lee 1969: Fig. 60).\n\nassemblages replete with messages of rulership and cosmic authority. A similar scenario characterized other Late Preclassic sites located to the south along the Pacific Coast of Guatemala.25 Bove (n.d.b) suggested that rulership throughout this region was expressed principally through large-scale construction projects and astronomical alignments rather than monumental sculpture, a situation that he characterized as a “corporate embodiment of authority.” Yet, as he further cautioned, such generalizations do not necessarily accommodate the existence of carved monuments or alternative sculptural expressions of authority such as plain stelae or “potbelly” sculptures at many of these coastal sites.26 While many puzzles concerning the nature of the Late Preclassic period in southeastern Mesoamerica still remain, it is only by literally piecing together the archaeological, stylistic, and iconographic evidence that a more complete picture of\n\n10\n\nCritical to these systems of communication during the Late Preclassic period was the development of hieroglyphic texts and calendrical records sometime between the years 1100 to 600 BC. This phenomenon undoubtedly grew out of the already well-developed iconic system of the Middle Preclassic Olmec, such as that depicted on the famous Humboldt Celt (fig. 1.8A) (Coe 1965, 1976; Justeson 1986; Justeson and Mathews 1990; Proskouriakoff 1971).28 As Justeson (1986: 443) noted, the emergent writing systems of Oaxaca and southeastern Mesoamerica were linked conceptually to visual systems that were employed to “legitimate and reinforce elite power and prestige; . . . [which] would remain the principal function of Mesoamerican writing.” It was during the early years of the Late Preclassic period that hieroglyphic writing began to appear regularly in southeastern Mesoamerica and the Isthmus region. A sherd from the fill in Mound 5b at the site of Chiapa de Corzo in the Upper Grijalva River valley of Chiapas, dated to Chiapa IV–V (Francesa–Guanacaste phases, or the Late Preclassic period), contains a fragmentary inscription (Méluzin 1995: fig. 5). This evidence indicates that, already during the Late Preclassic period, writing was in full bloom, and that the development of hieroglyphic script traditions must have taken place much earlier, during the Middle Preclassic period at the very latest.29 One of the hallmarks of early script traditions in this region was the use of the Long Count, a type of calendrical notation that counts the number of days elapsed since a set base date. The earliest known\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nAn Introduction to the Late Preclassic Period\n\nLong Count date appears on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo (fig. 1.8B) and corresponds to a day in the year 36 BC, while Stela C from the site of Tres Zapotes in Veracruz bears a Long Count date five years later (Coe 1957a: 598–599; Marcus 1976: 49–53; Stirling 1940: 4). Both of these monuments are non-Maya, from sites located in traditionally Mixe-Zoquean-speaking regions. Writing also appeared at the Pacific piedmont sites of Takalik Abaj and El Baúl during the Late Preclassic period. Takalik Abaj Stela 5 (fig. 1.9) bears two Long Count dates that fall within the year AD 126.30 An even earlier, although incomplete, Long Count date also appears on fragmentary Stela 2 (Graham, Heizer, and Shook 1978: 90–91).31 Stela 50 may contain an equally early, although again fragmentary, Long Count date as well (Graham 1989: 239 n. 2; Guernsey and Love 2005). Although the small corpus of noncalendrical glyphs at the site of Takalik Abaj makes it difficult to analyze what language was spoken at the site during the Late Preclassic period, Stela 5 may bear the kingly title ajaw spelled in a Mayan language, which would suggest that Takalik Abaj was occupied by Mayan speakers during this period.32 The Long Count date inscribed on El Baúl Stela 1, which also appears to be inscribed in a Mayan language, corresponds to the year AD 36.33 Monuments from Kaminaljuyu also bear hieroglyphic inscriptions. The elaborately carved Stela 10 (fig. 1.5), which dates to the Late Preclassic period, is incised with a lengthy series of glyphs that includes bar-and-dot numbers but lacks a Long Count date. While Fahsen (1999, 2000: 90, n.d.) recently argued that the inscription on Stela 10 was written in Ch’olan, a Mayan language,34 Justeson and Kaufman (1993) suggested that the text may represent a Mayanized form of MixeZoquean, or even possibly a script that incorporated both languages (Kaufman and Justeson 2001: 31). In a similar vein, Mora-Marín (2001) pointed to comparable epithet structures between the text of Kaminaljuyu Stela 10 and Classic Mayan inscriptions, which would suggest a Mayan language, but also noted that only slight variations in the same epithet structure characterize the Late\n\nFigure 1.9.Takalik Abaj Stela 5. Photo by author.\n\nPreclassic text of La Mojarra Stela 1 from the Mixe-Zoque region. Despite the limited number of inscriptions available to test these various hypotheses, it is increasingly apparent that, during this Late Preclassic period, Mayan and MixeZoquean speakers freely borrowed signs from one another (Kaufman and Justeson 2001; MoraMarín n.d.). Moreover, the complexity of this situation at Kaminaljuyu suggests that this site in particular may have been a key point of interaction between the two linguistic traditions (MoraMarín 2001; Kathryn Josserand, personal communication 2003). While writing appears in clearly non-Maya\n\n11\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\nRITUAL\n\n12:33 PM\n\nIN\n\nPage 12\n\nPOWER AND\n\nSTONE\n\nFigure 1.10. Examples of early writing from Mayan-speaking regions:A, El Mirador ceramic sherd (drawing by David Mora-Marín); B, Kichpanha bone (drawing by Peter Mathews); C,Takalik Abaj Monument 11 (drawing by James Porter, courtesy of John Graham and the University of California, Berkeley).\n\nregions of southeastern Mesoamerica by the first century BC, and at probable Mayan-speaking sites along the Pacific Coast by the first century AD, there is also intriguing evidence for early writing in the Maya Lowlands during this same Late Preclassic period. For example, an early ajaw glyph appears on a Late Preclassic ceramic sherd from El Mirador (fig. 1.10A).35 As Fields (1989: 51) observed, similar early ajaw forms appear on the stucco facade of Cerros Structure 5C-2nd.36 More recently, Stuart (n.d.) suggested that certain stucco mask facades in the Lowlands, such as those on Late Preclassic El Mirador Structure 34 (Hansen 1990), may contain nominal elements that were tied to evolving script traditions, and that presaged Early Classic developments such as the monumental embellishing of a ruler’s name in modeled stucco on the Margarita substructure at Copán (Sharer et al. 1999). Within the medium of stone stelae, Hansen (1990) likewise proposed a Late Preclassic date for El Mirador Stela 2, which contains a badly eroded hieroglyphic text.37 Ongoing investigations at San Bartolo, Guatemala, which have already recovered evidence for early writing\n\n12\n\nin exceptionally well-preserved murals at the site, may push back even earlier the dates for the appearance of writing in the Maya Lowlands region (Saturno, Taube, and Stuart 2005: 41). Perhaps even more fascinating are the paths of communication between the Maya Highlands and Lowlands that are implied by some of these early Lowland texts. An excellent example of this is the Kichpanha bone (fig. 1.10B) (Fahsen 1995: 152; Mora-Marín 2001: 310–311). Gibson, Shaw, and Finamore (1986: 11) dated the archaeological context of the bone to circa 100 BC–AD 100, although more recent reanalysis of the associated ceramics suggests a date of circa AD 150 or later (Meskill 1992; Reese 1989; Reese-Taylor and Walker 2002: 100). Most interestingly, the inscribed glyphs on the Kichpanha bone bear a\n\nFigure 1.11.The Hauberg Stela. Photo by Justin Kerr.\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nAn Introduction to the Late Preclassic Period\n\nstriking correspondence to an inscription on Takalik Abaj Monument 11, which can be dated to the Late Preclassic period on a stylistic basis (fig. 1.10C).38 As Mora-Marín (2001: 306–326) detailed, such evidence not only indicates a significant degree of interaction between Highland and Lowland Maya scribes during the Late Preclassic period, but also suggests that long-distance trade of objects like the Kichpanha bone contributed to the development and dissemination of writing during the Preclassic period. The miniature Hauberg Stela (fig. 1.11), an unprovenienced monument undoubtedly from the Maya Lowlands, also bears a hieroglyphic inscription that, although lacking a Long Count date, bears a Calendar Round date that has been correlated to the year AD 197 (Schele, Mathews, and Lounsbury 1990; cf. Houston 2000: 146). The stela depicts a ruler in a posture and performance mode that would become part of a standardized lexis of authority during the Classic period: in his arms he cradles a serpent that alludes to the scepter of authority among the Maya while also burping from its maw the head of a figure in a scene of otherworldly communication. The text records the fundamental facts—ruler’s name, polity, and official ritual act—while the imagery reveals the ramifications of this ritual behavior. Tikal Stela 29 (fig. 1.12), which records a Long Count date that corresponds to AD 292, is the earliest dated, archaeologically recovered monument in the Maya Lowlands ( Jones and Satterthwaite 1982). It depicts a Tikal ruler, garbed in the royal regalia, communicating with an ancestor who looks down upon him from above. On both Tikal Stela 29 and the Hauberg Stela (fig. 1.11), the rulers are literally dripping with the ornaments of power. They are portrayed as individuals who not only wielded power in the natural world, but also could communicate with the supernatural sphere. The Hauberg Stela, moreover, demonstrates how writing was woven into the composition as a formal complement and as a source of supplemental, detailed information that enhanced and elucidated the context of royal performances. With the advent and spread of writing\n\nFigure 1.12.Tikal Stela 29, back. Drawing by Linda Schele, © David Schele. Courtesy of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc.\n\nthroughout different regions, the Late Preclassic thus represented the first period in ancient Mesoamerica in which dates, events, and the deeds of specific individuals were celebrated in script traditions carved onto stone. In fact, as scholars (Grube 1995; Justeson 1986) have argued, the act of writing was inextricably tied to the foundation of royal dynasties and the invention of divine kingship, a function also attested to in ancient China and Egypt. This is demonstrated by inscriptions from both Mayan- and MixeZoquean-speaking regions that date to the end of the Late Preclassic period and glorify the deeds of specific rulers, placing their actions within broader contexts of calendrical cycles, astronomical phe-\n\n13\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 14\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nFigure 1.13.

Stela 1 was pulled from the Acula River at the village of La Mojarra in Veracruz, which is located midway between Cerro de las Mesas and Tres Zapotes, and records Long Count dates in the years AD 143 and 156 (Winfield Capitaine 1988). The Isthmian script with which the stela is inscribed flourished in the Olmec heartland and throughout much of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec between circa 150 BC and AD 450.40 Other sites whose monuments incorporate this script tradition include, among others, Tres Zapotes, Cerro de las Mesas, and San Andrés Tuxtla in the Olmec heartland, as well as Chiapa de Corzo in the 14\n\nUpper Grijalva River valley of Chiapas and El Sitio, which was located along the Pacific slope of Guatemala ( Justeson and Kaufman 1993: 1703, fig. 1; Méluzin 1995: 2–3). Significant, too, is the similarity between hieroglyphs in the text of La Mojarra Stela 1 and certain glyphlike forms on several stelae at the site of Izapa, which is otherwise notable for its almost complete lack of hieroglyphic writing.41 The relationship between the standing figure on Stela 1, presumably the ruler, and the adjacent hieroglyphic text is similar to that of the Hauberg Stela, and suggests that the composition formed a conceptual whole in which textual specifics were combined with iconographic and narrative devices to tell—and record in monumental form—the events associated with the reign of a specific Late Preclassic ruler. What these various inscriptions also underscore is the extent and nature of Late Preclassic communication spheres. At the most basic level, the Isthmian and Mayan script traditions were related: their numerical and calendrical systems are virtually identical. Isthmian inscriptions like La Mojarra Stela 1 also exhibit a columnar format, which in the Maya region and Guatemalan Highlands was modified into a system of paired columns of text. Beyond purely formal similarities, however, the content of the inscriptions reveals a shared attention to recording and monumentalizing the office of divine kingship. This common language of power—which not only included hieroglyphic inscriptions but also encompassed a repertoire of imagery incorporating recognizable symbol systems and formal conventions—became absolutely central to the display and justification of hierarchical authority during the Late Preclassic period. Beyond elite legitimation, however, it addressed issues of social organization and the relationship between the natural world and supernatural sphere that helped to structure and define a Late Preclassic worldview. Yet, such characterizations do not adequately address the lack of hieroglyphic writing at sites such as Izapa, nor the emphatic emphasis on imagery rather than text. Rather than signaling a lack of familiarity with hieroglyphic writing on the part of the Izapa elite, this absence should perhaps\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nAn Introduction to the Late Preclassic Period\n\nFigure 1.14.

This option by elites at Izapa to communicate with images rather than hieroglyphic texts provided a solution, and should not be dismissed as an evolutionary blunder or ignorant mistake: it afforded a widespread, accessible, and presumably successful nonverbal system of communication. As will be discussed in the following chapter, Izapa’s position at the juncture of two linguistic regions may have fostered the penchant for nontextual communicative strategies rather than language-dependent ones (Guernsey and Love 2005).\n\nMediums and Modes of Expression This study explores the role of sculpture in the development and dissemination of a Late Preclassic language of power that stretched throughout a\n\ngeographically and linguistically diverse region. Along the Pacific piedmont and highlands of Guatemala, and throughout the entire Izapan style sphere, the preferred sculptural vehicle for these messages appears to have been the stela-altar tableau. Stelae emerged as a sculptural format by the end of the Middle Preclassic period, and by the Middle to Late Preclassic transition were paired frequently with plain or carved altars at their bases (fig. 1.2). The prepared surfaces and more regularized contours of stelae—compared to boulders or natural rock formations—accommodated increasingly complex narrative compositions (Clancy 1990: 27).43 The more controlled form and human scale of stelae also more readily facilitated their transportation to and placement within a carefully constructed ceremonial precinct. Although the concern for unified programs of sculpture and architecture dates back to the Early Preclassic colossal heads of the Olmec, stelae became the primary vehicles for the transmission of symbolic imagery from the late Middle Preclassic through the Terminal Classic periods. While the stela form became more regularized during the course of its development, its associated imagery 15\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 16\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nvaried considerably, from depictions of rulers, deities, and ceremonial occasions to abstracted designs of specific iconographic motifs. In stark contrast to the Pacific piedmont and Guatemalan Highlands, the Maya Lowlands were characterized by monumental architectural facades during the Late Preclassic period. Although stelae are not absent from sculptural assemblages in this region, programs of elaborate architectural sculpture appear to have served as the primary format for public expression.44 These architectural facades, typically composed of enormous deity heads modeled in stucco (fig. 1.14), differ distinctly from the stelae of the Pacific piedmont and highlands. While stelae often depicted rulers as protagonists in ritual action, the stucco facades typically depict not rulers, but their supernatural patrons. More than just architectural backdrops for political and religious performances, however, these facades were part of a genre of expressive media that communicated information to largely nonliterate, Late Preclassic Maya populations (Reese 1996). In addition to these monumental architectural facades, new discoveries in the Maya Lowlands indicate that mural programs may have provided another outlet of symbolic expression for Late Preclassic rulers in this region (Saturno n.d.; Saturno et al. 2001).45 Mural programs readily accommodated more narrative compositions and provided an ideal counterpoint to the iconic monumentality of the architectural facades. Regardless of the media—whether stucco facades, painted murals, or carved stelae—monuments throughout this Late Preclassic communication sphere punctuated space with their messages and indicated the conceptualization of a unified program of sculpture and architecture that demarcated sacred space. They functioned as communicative media that transmitted potent symbolic imagery and, occasionally, carefully constructed hieroglyphic texts. More significantly, they also gave form, quite literally, to the development of powerful Late Preclassic political and cosmological messages. It was thus within this vibrant setting of Late\n\n16\n\nPreclassic Mesoamerica that the Izapan style developed and spread, permeating more-physical ethnic and political boundaries. Specifically because it was widely employed by elites at numerous sites, it provides a unique lens through which the Late Preclassic landscape can be viewed. The monuments themselves, scattered throughout a broad and diverse geographic region, make visible certain paths and modes of communication during this time period in Mesoamerican history. The monuments and their rich repertoire of imagery also provide insight into Late Preclassic symbolic vocabularies of elite authority, many of which were crystallized during this time period into a canon of forms that would endure for a millennium. An adequate picture of the Late Preclassic political and economic sphere is imperative to understanding the greater context in which these monuments existed. Yet, the monuments and their messages were more than reactionary devices to the forces of economic wealth and distribution, political organization, or the control of limited natural resources or agriculturally productive land. To borrow Ringle’s (1999: 214) words with regards to the monumental architecture of the Late Preclassic Maya, Izapan style monuments “fostered growth, prosperity, and political expansion,” instead of simply responding to it. They were key players in the Late Preclassic landscape and actors upon the stage of history, participating within a dialogue of sculpture, architecture, and performer that formulated messages of rulership, power, social cohesion, and humans’ relationship to the earth and supernatural sphere. As Kubler (1971: 167) once stated, “emergence”—or, in this case, the appearance of a coherent artistic tradition like that of the Izapan style—“is like the actor coming on in the prologue to the play. But unless he can say something of value to the audience they may walk out on him.” The Izapan style not only debuted on the stage of Late Preclassic Mesoamerica, but forged a lasting imprint. It is this notion—of art as a dynamic, tangible force— that guides the ensuing discussion of the Izapan style phenomenon and its role within a broad, Late Preclassic interaction sphere.\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nTWO\n\nThe site of Izapa in context\n\ne spent a week at Izapa, which turned out to be an interesting and imposing site with numerous large mounds and curiously carved stelae with altars. The heat was intense while we worked during the most strenuous week we spent in the field. However, we located more than 30 stelae and altars and felt well repaid for our efforts. —Matthew Stirling 1941\n\nW\n\nThe Soconusco Region As discussed in the Introduction, the term “Izapan style” takes its name from the site of Izapa, which is located on the sloping piedmont above the Pacific coastal plain of modern Chiapas, Mexico. This Pacific coastal and piedmont zone, generally referred to as the Soconusco region, was renowned for its production of cacao, which flourished in the rich volcanic soils of the piedmont that received ample annual rainfall, enabling maximum agricultural productivity. During the Postclassic period, this Soconusco—or Xoconochco—region represented the most southeasterly extension of the Aztec Empire and stretched along the Pacific Coast from Tiltepec, near Tonalá in modern Chiapas, to the Río Tilapa just east of Ayutla, Guatemala (fig. 2.1) (Coe 1961: 15; Thompson 1943: 108; 1948: 10).1 The backdrop to the Soconusco region is the rugged volcanic peaks of the southern Sierra Madres that run along the narrow Pacific coastal plain of Chiapas and extend down through Guatemala and into El Salvador (fig. 2.2). Numerous rivers drain this highland range, flow across the coastal plain, and empty into the Pacific Ocean, carrying with them the residue of ancient as well as more recent volcanic ash that to this day\n\ncontinues to fertilize the sloping piedmont (Coe 1961: 7). The transition from the highland mountain range to the coastal plain is marked, as the cool atmosphere of the higher elevations gives way to the hot and humid piedmont region (Coe 1961: 7; McBryde 1945: 5). The Franciscan chronicler Fray Alonso Ponce vividly described the tropical climate of Soconusco in 1586, as well as some of its more annoying inhabitants: Due to these rivers and swamps and the excessive heat and the many orchards of cacao, there abound in that Province mosquitoes, which defend it bravely with their weapons so sharp and clever, and to defend themselves persecuted mankind uses beds with closed nets around them.2 During the pre-Hispanic era when travel was undertaken primarily by foot, the movement of people and goods from east to west was facilitated by interconnecting estuaries and canals along the coast that were navigable only during the dry season (Navarrete 1978: 80–81; Orellana 1995: 16). They were not, however, without certain dangers: Ponce de León, the governor of Soconusco, bluntly declared in his 1574 Relación de la Provincia de Soconusco that alligators made\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 18\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nFigure 2.1.

These traversed the coastal piedmont and extended into the rugged ranges of the southern Sierra Madres, connecting the sloping plains to the interior valleys of Chiapas and the highlands of Guatemala. From northwestern Soconusco, overland routes provided access to modern Oaxaca and the Gulf Coast (Navarrete 1978: 76–79). Indeed, the antiquity of these footpaths throughout the Pacific slope is attested by the numerous Olmec style objects and carvings documented from the Gulf Coast through modern Chiapas, Guatemala, and as far south as El Salvador. Such artifacts and monuments provide concrete evidence that these extensive trade routes were well established by the Early and Middle Preclassic periods.4 The earliest firsthand account of an overland journey throughout this region is that of Pedro de Alvarado, one of Hernán Cortés’ chief lieutenants. Alvarado, along with his army of horsemen and foot soldiers, traveled through Soconusco and into the Suchitepéquez area of Guatemala in 1524, describing the towns, passes, and paths that he\n\nencountered while on his way to attack Utatlán, the K’iche’ Maya capital in Guatemala. Regarding the route between Soconusco and the modern Department of Retalhuleu, Guatemala, Alvarado stated, “[It is] open and very wide, the highway as well as the crossroads” (Mackie 1924: 54). However, as he continued toward the higher elevations of Quezaltenango, Guatemala, Alvarado cautioned that the country became “thickly wooded, covered with trees and cocoa [sic] plantations,” and difficult to traverse (Mackie 1924: 55).5 The significance of this passage through Soconusco, which accommodated communication networks between the Valley of Mexico and the Guatemalan coast, was reiterated in an account from 1595 that recorded the travels of Fray Tomás Torres: One is informed that the indigenous people kept the route clear and in a good state of repair because over it they take out their products, of which the principal is cacao; for this reason Moctezuma maintained a good vigilance in the passes and towns of the coast of the Southern Ocean. (in Navarrete 1978: 79)6\n\n19\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 20\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\n. . . For this reason, the Indians have their cacao orchards where there is water to irrigate them, and when they plant them, they interplant also certain trees which grow very tall and shade them, which they call madres del cacao.7\n\nFigure 2.3. Cacao trees at Izapa. Photo by author.\n\nSuch overland travels became hazardous during the rainy season, however, when rivers flowed down the mountainsides with such force that fording them was virtually impossible. Within this tropical environment, numerous tall trees formed a forest canopy and provided the necessary shade for the cultivation of cacao (fig. 2.3). Fray Alonso Ponce described this aspect of Soconusco in 1586: The cacao tree is very delicate and of such a nature that the sun ought not to hit it directly, or at least not the full sun, nor ought it to lack water if it is to live long and bear much fruit. 20\n\nAs Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 48) observed, the rich agricultural potential of Soconusco, especially for the production of cacao, must certainly have had an impact on the region in ancient times, even during the Late Preclassic florescence of Izapa. Parsons (1967: 173) also commented on the historical importance of cacao as an item of exchange, which was easily traded from Soconusco to the east and west via continuous lowland trade routes that link the modern states of Veracruz and Tabasco to Chiapas, Guatemala, and El Salvador (fig. 2.1). As he described, the zone that connected the Atlantic and Pacific coasts consisted of areas of tropical rain forest as well as flat, open savannas that readily accommodated trade and migration. He suggested the name Peripheral Coastal Lowlands to describe this region, which represented “one single, integrated” area that had witnessed cultural diffusion from at least the Middle Preclassic period onward. The concentrated production of cacao within Soconusco undoubtedly enabled the region to establish itself as an important commercial center. This is well documented during the period following the Conquest, when merchants would travel great distances to Soconusco to obtain the highly prized cacao in exchange for other goods (Gasco 1989, 1997, 2003). The Englishman Thomas Gage (1928: 151) made reference to this during his travels in 1648 through the Upper Grijalva River valley of Chiapas, an area well known for its textile production: The chief commodity of this valley consisteth in cotton-wool, whereof are made such store of mantels for the Indians’ wearing that the merchants far and near come for them. They exchange them to Soconusco and Suchitepeques for cacao, whereby they are well stored of that drink.\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nThe Site of Izapa in Context\n\nEarlier, in 1594, Juan de Pineda had made similar observations regarding the networks of trade that stretched into the Soconusco region, particularly those involving the distribution of textiles by porters from the Upper Grijalva River valley into “the provinces of Soconusco and the coast of Zapotitlan and to Guatemala.”8 Scholes and Roys (1968: 38–39, 319) likewise discussed ethnohistoric evidence for pre-Hispanic and Colonial exchange networks, particularly of textiles, that extended from Chiapas to Yucatán and central Mexico (fig. 2.4). The same extensive trade routes also captured the attention of Fray Diego Durán (1971: 129) in the middle of the sixteenth century: Today the natives of Cholula continue their trade and commerce with different merchandise, traveling through the most remote and distant parts of the land, such as Cuauhtemallan [Guatemala] and Xoconocho [Soconusco], all along those coasts and mines, with their loads of peddlers’ trinkets, just as they did in ancient times. These diverse commercial routes most likely followed the same distribution channels as those for cacao, obsidian, and other goods both exotic and utilitarian, and were surely critical to forging Mixe-Zoque spheres of influence as far back as the Late Preclassic period (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 324).\n\nIzapa: Location and Linguistics Located within this matrix of communication and exchange was the site of Izapa, which is perched along the banks of the Río Izapa, a tributary of the larger Río Suchiate (fig. 2.1). The Río Suchiate, which divides the narrow Pacific coastal plain between modern Chiapas and Guatemala, originates on the slopes of the volcano Tacaná, whose profile dominates the horizon on a clear day (fig. 2.5). The Río Izapa forms the eastern boundary of Izapa’s ceremonial zone and is littered with large boulders that provided an abundant supply of ancient building stones (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez\n\nFigure 2.4. Hypothetical scene of Aztec trader presenting cloak to lowland ruler. Painting by Rita Ford Guernsey after Stuart 1981: 114.\n\n1982: 55). The site itself, only twenty-two miles from the Pacific Ocean, is characterized by a gentle gradient sloping toward the coastal plain, where ancient inhabitants were afforded access to a variety of goods, such as salt, aquatic foods, lowland fruits and vegetables, and palm leaves, that served both utilitarian and ceremonial functions (Borhegyi 1965: 6). Perhaps even more significant was Izapa’s location at the nexus of two major cultural regions during the Late Preclassic period, with MixeZoquean-speaking groups to the west and Mayan speakers to the east. In 1586 the Franciscan Commissary General, Fray Ponce, accompanied by his personal secretary, Antonio de Ciudad Real—an\n\n21\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 22\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nFigure 2.5.Tacaná volcano as seen from Group F at Izapa.

After Justeson and Kaufman 1993: Fig. 1.\n\n22\n\naccomplished linguist—traveled through the Soconusco region, moving in a southeasterly direction from the town of Tonalá to that of Ayutla, just south of Izapa on the Río Suchiate (Ciudad Real 1873; Roys 1932). According to Ponce (1948: 7), the towns were inhabited by individuals who spoke a language “much like Zoque.”9 In fact, by at least the Middle and Late Preclassic periods, the Mixe-Zoquean-speaking region of Mesoamerica (fig. 2.6) appears to have stretched through the greater Isthmus of Tehuantepec area, including the coastal regions and drainage basins of the Coatzacoalcos River in Veracruz; the Grijalva River, which runs through western Tabasco and the highlands of Chiapas; and the Tonalá River, which marks the boundary between the modern states of Veracruz and Tabasco. It also encompassed portions of southeastern Oaxaca and continued down the Pacific Coast of Chiapas into southwestern Guatemala (Coe 1961: 22; Foster 1969: 448, 453; Lowe 1977: 200–201).10 Importantly, the geographic distribution of Mixe-Zoquean languages closely corresponds to\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 23\n\nThe Site of Izapa in Context\n\nthe Olmec heartland region along the Gulf Coast in the modern states of Veracruz and Tabasco, as well as Olmec communication corridors that stretched through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and down into the Pacific coastal piedmont as far south as Izapa (Baez-Jorge 1973: 57–63; Hasler 1958: 46l; Lowe 1977: 200; Vogt 1969: 27).11 The Olmec (fig. 2.7), who rose to prominence during the Early and Middle Preclassic periods at sites such as San Lorenzo and La Venta, developed many templates—such as fundamental sculptural and architectural patterns for structuring sacred space and articulating a worldview—that would be invoked by later Mesoamericans for nearly three millennia until the arrival of the Spanish.12 The correspondence between the location of Olmec sites and the distribution of Mixe-Zoquean languages, combined with a glottochronological time depth for Mixe-Zoquean languages that corresponds to the emergence of Olmec civilization circa 1500 BC, led Campbell and Kaufman (1976) to suggest that the Olmec were most likely speakers of MixeZoquean languages (cf. Hasler 1958: 46). As they observed, many words in other Mesoamerican languages—in particular ones that are “diagnostic of the Mesoamerican culture area” such as cacao, tomato, bean, squash/gourd—are loans from Mixe-Zoquean.13 As Campbell and Kaufman (1976: 84) further noted, the far-reaching linguistic influence of the Mixe-Zoquean language attests to “the prestigious and powerful position speakers of Mixe-Zoquean languages must have had” during the Preclassic period. By the Late Preclassic period, Izapa appears to have been located at the southeastern boundary of the Mixe-Zoquean language region. Early on, J. Eric S. Thompson (1943: 108, 1948: 10) discerned as much, based primarily on Ponce’s 1586 description of a Zoquean-like language spoken in the region, as well as modern documentation by Sapper (1927) of Tapachultec, a Mixean language, still spoken in the vicinity of Tapachula at the end of the nineteenth century.14 Coe (1961: 21) concurred, stating that the language of Soconusco was “certainly of the Mixe-Zoque group,” as did Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 10; cf. Lowe 1977: 243),\n\nFigure 2.7. San Lorenzo Monument 1. Photo by author.\n\nwho placed Izapa at the southeasternmost frontier of the Mixe-Zoquean language region. Nonetheless, the almost complete lack of hieroglyphic inscriptions at Izapa makes an absolute linguistic affiliation for the inhabitants of Izapa difficult to establish. Only a handful of monuments at Izapa contain hieroglyphic elements, most of which appear to be predominantly calendrical in nature.15 While a significant amount of linguistic, ethnohistoric, ethnographic, and archaeological data provide compelling evidence that the site of Izapa was inhabited during the Late Preclassic period by speakers of a MixeZoquean language, the possibility that its inhabitants as well as traders to the site may have spoken more than one language, including a Mayan one, cannot be ruled out.16 In fact, what is certain is that the people of Late Preclassic Izapa were participants in a dynamic system of trade and com-\n\n23\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 24\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nFigure 2.8.The archaeological sequence at Izapa.After Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: Fig. 7.1\n\nmunication that paid little heed to linguistic and ethnic boundaries.\n\nEarly and Middle Preclassic Izapa The site of Izapa, which stretches across approximately four square kilometers on the western side of the Río Izapa, was first occupied during the Ocós cultural horizon (1500–1200 BC) (fig. 2.8).17 During this first phase of the Early Preclassic period (1500–900 BC), southern Chiapas and Guatemala were home to many groups of early\n\n24\n\npottery-using people who took advantage of both coastal estuaries and the fertile inland piedmont, establishing fishing and agricultural villages.18 Already by this time, the site of Paso de la Amada in Chiapas, Mexico, displayed evidence for rank as evidenced by differentiation in burials and the presence of a large, well-built structure atop a mound that may have functioned as an elite domestic residence.19 In fact, Clark (1991) argued that the Pacific slope and coastal zones witnessed a precocious development during the first stages of the Preclassic period at a time when Olmec sites along the Gulf Coast were not yet established.20 During the subsequent Cuadros phase (1200 –1000 BC), settlements in the region continued to be concentrated along marine estuaries and the inland coastal plain. At Izapa, ceramics and figurines dating to this phase bear close affinities to those at the Olmec site of San Lorenzo, which flourished in southern Veracruz between the years 1200 and 900 BC (Coe and Diehl 1980; Cyphers Guillén 1996; Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 121). Such similarities suggest that, during this period, Izapa was participating in a widespread Early Olmec, or Mixe-Zoque, interaction sphere.21 Evidence for Izapa’s participation within this Olmec horizon would continue into the following Jocotal phase (1000–850 BC), despite the collapse of San Lorenzo and the subsequent emergence of the site of La Venta, which would dominate the Olmec heartland throughout the Middle Preclassic period.22 The Middle Preclassic period (900–300 BC) witnessed the beginning of monumental construction activity at Izapa (fig. 2.9). Ekholm (1969: 98) recognized early platform phases deep within Mound 30a at Izapa that date to the Duende phase (850–650 BC).23 These more restricted Duende-period occupations, concentrated along the Group B terrace, gave way during the Escalon phase (650–450 BC) to a more widespread occupation that encompassed the entire central zone of the site (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 127–129). Regionally, during the Middle Preclassic, there was likewise a significant growth in the number of villages in the Pacific coastal zone as\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nThe Site of Izapa in Context\n\nFigure 2.9. Map of central Izapa.After Ekholm 1969: Fig. 4.\n\nwell as the construction of public architecture in the form of large earthen mounds at the site of La Blanca, Guatemala (Coe and Flannery 1967: 85), which Love (1991, 1999a, 2002b) suggested became the major center in the region by the Conchas phase (900–600 BC). In fact, Love (1991: 57, 1999a: 137, 2002b: 44) posited that, during the\n\nMiddle Preclassic period, Izapa may have been a secondary center within the greater polity of La Blanca.24 The ensuing Frontera phase (450–300 BC), which represented a transition from the Middle to Late Preclassic periods, was characterized by Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 12) as a “develop-\n\n25\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 26\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nFigure 2.10. Mound 30 in Group B at Izapa. Photo by author.\n\nmental continuum” that witnessed the rise of Izapa to a position of relative importance within the region; certainly the decline of the Pacific coastal site of La Blanca contributed to this. Population at Izapa continued to grow, as did the Mound 30a pyramid, which reached a height of sixteen meters at this time (fig. 2.10) (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 129). The supporting Mound 30 acropolis was also expanded during this period. It included the earliest-known jade offering at Izapa from Burial 30e-1, which consisted of cylindrical and spherical jade beads deposited at the waist of what may have been an individual whose remains were not preserved within the cut-stone grave (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 194).25 More than a special burial treatment, this was most likely an act of elite conspicuous consumption, framed against the backdrop of ritual space at Izapa during the Middle to Late Preclassic transition.\n\nLate Preclassic Izapa: Constructing Sacred Space It was not until the Guillen phase (300–50 BC), however, that Izapa reached its apex of growth. This period was characterized by extraor-\n\n26\n\ndinary construction activity in which all of the central plaza groups reached their maximum proportions (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 133). While Izapa expanded significantly, sites in the coastal Ocós area experienced population declines and most settlements appear to have been concentrated in the piedmont zone (Coe and Flannery 1967: 89).26 The neighboring site of El Jobó, located to the southeast of Izapa, also experienced growth and erected fifteen-meter-high pyramidal mounds, one of which was topped with a stela carved in a distinctly Izapan style. Regionally, the same attention to monumental construction characterized sites such as Takalik Abaj, El Baúl, Chalchuapa, Chocolá, Kaminaljuyu, and El Ujuxte during this Late Preclassic period. Throughout Izapa’s history the organization of space at the site was typified by the quadrilateral arrangement of mounds around a central plaza, although several of the plaza groups departed from this model (fig. 2.9). Most Late Preclassic structures at Izapa were of earthen construction, finished with riverstones, clay facing, or occasionally lime plaster. Also by this period, the site center comprised seven distinct plaza and mound groupings, focused around the enormous Mound 60,\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 27\n\nThe Site of Izapa in Context\n\nwhich reached a height of twenty-two meters at this time (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 133). The placement of Mound 60 at the center of Izapa marked the central axis of the site at twenty-one degrees east of north, providing a compelling visual orientation for the site itself. The highest pyramid at Izapa, Mound 60 defined the southern extent of the Group H plaza, which was bound on the north by Mound 25.27 Even today, the rationale for the positioning of these structures is still abundantly clear: Mound 25 is perfectly framed by the contours of the Tacaná volcano looming on the horizon (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: fig. 4.5; Norman 1980). As Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 262) observed, the two tiers of Mound 25 mirror the contours of the volcano, thereby replicating on a smaller scale the natural topography of the region. At the center of the Group H plaza stood Mound 46, which may have served as a dance platform or stage for public display. Standing on this low mound, a ruler could have aligned himself with the central axis of the site and with\n\nthe massive Tacaná volcano to the north in a powerful demonstration of political authority and geomantic symmetry (Guernsey Kappelman 2001: 83–84). When considered in light of broader patterns of Mesoamerican architecture and the construction of sacred space, the Group H plaza also served to define Izapa as the center of the world. At least since the time of the Middle Preclassic Olmec, Mesoamerican peoples erected large pyramidal structures that emerged from the plazas at their base. This architectural configuration symbolized a mountain of sustenance rising from the waters of creation, and functioned as the archetypal mythological landscape for many Mesoamerican groups.28 This pattern is revealed at Izapa through the series of reservoirs, dams, and aqueducts that immediately surrounded Mound 60, and which channeled water from the central plazas to the Río Izapa, which formed the eastern boundary of the site (fig. 2.11) (Gómez Rueda 1995; Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 263). A\n\nFigure 2.11.The Group H plaza at Izapa showing hydraulic systems.After Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: Fig. 8.8.\n\n27\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 28\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\nFigure 2.12.The eastern periphery of Izapa showing possible entrance to site from the bank of the Río Izapa.After Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: Fig. 14.1\n\nreservoir was created to the north of Mound 60 when the pyramid was constructed during the Late Preclassic period and fill was removed from the adjacent plaza spaces. As Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 263) noted, this reservoir was aligned with Mounds 25, 60, and Tacaná in the distance, and complemented by the presence of another ancient reservoir, lined with stone boulders and a series of drains, to the west. This water catchment and drainage system may have created the effect of a great pool of water at the center of the site, from which arose massive Mound 60. As such, this reservoir would have represented the fertile waters of abundance, surrounding a pyramid that embodied Mesoamerican notions of sustenance and creation (Guernsey Kappelman 2001: 84). This paradigmatic structuring of sacred space at Late Preclassic Izapa—and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, for that matter—may thus have provided an arena in which messages of cultural identity and political legitimacy were articulated and performed according to carefully defined structuring principles (cf. Geertz 1980; Schapiro 1953; Wheatley 1971).29\n\n28\n\nBut how was one’s entrance into this sacred center of the site directed? One possible point of entry to Izapa might have been along the banks of the Río Izapa, on the eastern periphery of the site (fig. 2.12). Just southeast of Group G, a terrace was constructed, presumably during the Guillen phase, along the river’s western bank (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 257–259). A stone-paved ramp led down from this terrace to the riverbank where a carved stone basin, or fountain stone, was found in situ beneath a spring (Norman 1976: fig. 5.79).30 Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 259) noted that the paved ramp provided convenient access to the river and spring-fed fountains, and also suggested that it served a ceremonial purpose. They proposed that the paved ramp might have accommodated ritual processions to the spring-fed water that was gathered in the stone basins, while also functioning as “a formal entranceway into Izapa for visiting delegations arriving from the east” (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 81). This proposed point of entry would have led directly to the ceremonial core of the site and formed a conceptual link between the sacred waters of Mound\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nPage 29\n\nThe Site of Izapa in Context\n\n60 and the Río Izapa itself. Immediately to the north of the paved ramp, as if marking the approach to the landing, a group of nineteen rough boulder stelae and accompanying altars were placed in a line at a bend of the river (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 257). Testifying to the ancient significance of this ceremonial path of entry is Mound 61, a small structure that sat adjacent to Mound 60 on its eastern side and may have served an important function on ritual circuits to and from the site (fig. 2.12). Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 254) noted that Mound 61 was an unusually well constructed building with plaster floors and cut-stone walls that dated to the Late Preclassic Guillen phase. Such fine construction was anomalous at Izapa, where the vast majority of architecture was characterized by riverstone platforms (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 254). As visitors disembarked onto the paved ramp from the river and slowly ascended the raised plaza of Group G on their way to the heart of the site, they would have been greeted by this exceptional structure, framed as it were against the contours of Mound 60. Upon reaching the low platform of Mound 61, visitors might have been afforded a dramatic view of the symbolic waters of creation that flowed to the north of Mound 60. From this vantage point they would also have seen their first glimpse of the ceremonial landscape that unfolded before them. Izapa’s site center thus manifested a striking dialogue with the natural environment that included direct architectural references to the surrounding landscape. Elites at the site also clearly chose to adopt a pan-Mesoamerican formal vocabulary that shaped the site center into a familiar and effective setting for conveying messages of political and supernatural authority. The nature of this formal vocabulary—expressed on a large scale through architecture and the organization of space—can perhaps be considered as an aesthetic trope, or as the formal, physical manifestation of core cultural principles that provided an overarching structure in which socially effective communication could take place (Armstrong 1975; Reese-Taylor and Koontz 2001; Schapiro 1953).\n\nBecause the metaphors and tropes invoked by the elite at Izapa communicated deeply engrained cultural patterns, they would have been broadly recognizable to audiences of many ethnic affiliations in ancient Mesoamerica. In a profound sense, it was only through such grand architectural schemes and metaphorically constructed space that messages of power and authority could be successfully conveyed to the diverse audiences that interacted with the population at Late Preclassic Izapa. The audiences to whom these messages were directed at Izapa, however, must be considered carefully. The authors of the messages recorded in monumental sculptural and architectural form were clearly the ruling elite of the site, and the ideas conveyed by them reinforced their claims to authority by linking them and their actions to mythic events and locations, topics dealt with more fully in Chapters 5 and 6. Yet it must not be assumed that all levels of society “bought into” or passively accepted the ruling elite’s claims to political and cosmological authority. At Izapa, assessing the effect of these elite-driven statements on the local nonelite population is impossible to determine given the almost complete lack of data from residential sectors at the site. However, there are clues in the broader archaeological record of the Pacific slope that suggest that public ritual became more significant during the Late Preclassic period than it had been in the previous Middle Formative period. At Middle Formative La Blanca, for instance, ceramic figurines are omnipresent in domestic contexts, which suggests that individual household ritual—outside the supervision of the ruler—was of major importance during this time (Love 1999a, 2002a, 2002b; cf. Clark, Hansen, and Pérez 2000; Marcus 1996). By the advent of the Late Preclassic at nearby El Ujuxte, however, there was an almost complete cessation of household ritual as evidenced by a significant decrease in figurine use as well as a decline in household feasting (Love 2002a; Love, Castillo, and Balcárcel 1996: 8). While comparable evidence does not exist to test whether this was also the case at Izapa, evidence at other sites along the Pacific slope during the Late Preclassic period\n\n29\n\n**Guernsey pages\n\n6/7/06\n\n12:33 PM\n\nRITUAL AND\n\nPOWER\n\nPage 30\n\nIN\n\nSTONE\n\ndoes suggest that household ritual was deemphasized, while increasing emphasis was placed instead on public ritual space and its associated ceremonies (Guernsey and Love 2005). That said, however, it must be acknowledged that the evidence from Izapa is skewed. Monumental statements of elite authority cannot be tested against evidence from nonelite domestic contexts to determine whether the rituals that took place in households, if any, echoed those of the formal, public spaces or, as is also possible, challenged them. As is discussed in greater detail in later chapters, however, there is evidence to suggest that the monumental statements of authority at Izapa resonated with more than just local elites or those visiting from other regions. Many of the messages and themes recorded on the monuments in the site center reflect themes with ties to fundamental agricultural cycles, astronomical events, or mythologies that appear to have been broadly shared at this time and grounded in the rhythms of daily life. In other words, monuments with such narratives at Izapa were probably, at some level, effective at communicating an elite ideology to a nonelite population.\n\nThe Stela Phenomenon: Antecedents and Significance According to Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 23, 133), the majority of monuments at Izapa were carved during the Guillen phase (300–50 BC), with the latest possible dating for others in the subsequent Terminal Preclassic Hato phase (50 BC–AD 100). Moreover, as Norman (1976: 324) noted, when the monuments at Izapa are grouped together they demonstrate little stylistic evolution, but rather appear to have been conceived as a unit. The archaeology supports this assessment, as the majority of monuments from the site center, excluding Group F, were found in situ, organized amongst the distinct plaza groups at approximately the same stratigraphic level (Lowe, Lee, and Martínez 1982: 159).31 The plazas of Groups A and B, located to the west and northeast of Mound 60, respectively, held\n\n30\n\nthe highest concentration of carved monuments at Izapa and appear to have been the loci of ritual activity during the Late Preclassic florescence of the site. As Lowe, Lee, and Martínez (1982: 159) described for Group A (see fig. 1.4), the monuments “must have been in contemporaneous use or veneration as presently arranged” and represent “a long progression of Guillen-phase sculptural and construction activity.”32 Within these plaza groupings, many of the monuments were organized into stela-altar pairs, as Stirling (1943: 61) first observed during his early visit to the site. At Izapa, these stela-altar pairs literally punctuate the plaza space with their imagery and messages, and indicate the conceptualization of a unified program of scu"
