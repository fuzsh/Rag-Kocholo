        "text": "Overview\n\nThis minimal-level cataloging guideline complies with the PCC BIBCO Standard Record (BSR) for cartographic resources, and it is intended for the catalog assistant when no adequately bibliographical record for a cartographic resource is found in OCLC.\n\nPart 1: General Procedures for Minimal Level Bibliographic Records\n\nSearch local catalog thoroughly before creating a minimal-level bibliographic record.\n\nIf a record is found in the local catalog but requires better metadata, search OCLC. If there is no better bibliographic record or matching record in OCLC, route the item to a map catalog librarian.\n\nIf there is a better bibliographic record or matching record in OCLC, enhance the existing record in the local catalog following the Copy Cataloging Checklist for Map guideline.\n\nIf a full level record is not found in LCDB and OCLC, create a new minimal level record following the guideline from Part 2, using approved templates for cartographic materials.\n\nIf no matching record is found in OCLC, create a new minimal level record following Part 2.\n\nIf the cartographic resource is part of a cartographic series, consult with a map catalog librarian.\n\nIf cartographic material is unpublished (e.g., a manuscript map or a photostat), consult with a map catalog librarian.\n\nPart 2: Creating a New Minimal Level Map Record\n\nUse the approved bibliographic template for cartographic resources to create a new minimal-level record. Refer to the map catalog librarian to install the template.\n\nLeader:\n\nType of Record e: cartographic material <template default> Bibliographic level m: monograph/item <template default> Encoding level 7: minimal level <template default> Cataloging form i: ISBD punctuation include <template default>\n\n007:\n\nThis field is mandatory in all records.

Material Input Table\n\n008 Detail a: Single map A single sheet cartographic item or multiple sheet cartographic item issued at the same time by the same publisher and meant to be used together to form a single bibliographic entity. b: Map series A number of related but physically separate and bibliographically distinct cartographic units intended by the producer(s) or issuing body(s) to form a single group. Each sheet includes sufficient detail (title, legend) to be used alone. Not used for atlas series. c: Map serials Issued in successive parts bearing numerical or chronological designations and intended to be continued indefinitely. For serially issued atlases, code e (Atlas) is used. d: Globe A 3-dimensional cartographic item. e: Atlas Includes atlas series, and serially issued atlases.\n\nVariable fields:\n\n020 (ISBN): Record the ISBN in field 020, if applicable. Do not transcribe hyphens or spaces.\n\n020 ‡a #############\n\n034 (Coded cartographic mathematical data):\n\nThe 034 field and the 255 field must be in agreement.\n\nSubfield ‡a is mandatory.\n\nSubfield ‡b is for scale figure, record without commas (same as 255 ‡a)\n\nSubfields ‡d, ‡e, ‡f, ‡g are for latitude and longitude values in the decimal format, while 255 ‡c is in the degrees-minutes-seconds format. Supply coordinates even if they are not available on the map; use BoundingBox or Extent Helper to determine the coordinates. Use Degree/Minutes/Seconds to/from Decimal Latititude/Longitude Conversions Calculator to determine or convert coordinates.\n\nIf a scale is stated on the map, or if one can be determined using a scale indicator, mark the first indicator 1 (one), enter a in subfield ‡a and the denominator of the scale ratio, without commas, in ‡b.\n\n034 1 ‡a a ‡b 2000000\n\nIf there is no scale stated on the map, and one can not be determined using a scale indicator, mark the first indicator 0 (zero), and enter a in subfield ‡a. Do not add subfield ‡b.\n\n034 0 ‡a a\n\nIf there are scale and coordinates on the source, record them in decimal degrees in ‡d [westernmost longitude], ‡e [easternmost longitude], ‡f [northernmost latitude], ‡g [southernmost latitude]. Use the negative sign (-) in front of longitude (W) and latitude (S).\n\n034 1 ‡a a ‡b 126720 ‡d 144.4 ‡e -064.4 ‡f 071.6 ‡g -014.8\n\nIf using BoundingBox or Extent Helper to determine the coordinates, add ‡2 bound right after ‡g.\n\n034 1 ‡a a ‡b 126720 ‡d 008.3971 ‡e 011.0887 ‡f 045.4816 ‡g 044.6333 ‡2 bound\n\n040 (Cataloging source):\n\n040 ‡a CtY ‡b eng ‡e rda‡c CtY\n\n100/700, 110/710, or 111/711 (Main or added entry: Personal, Corporate or Conference Name):\n\nIf the resource has more than one creator, record the first-named creator in the appropriate 1XX field.\n\nIf the map names no author, omit the 1XX field.\n\nIf there is no 1XX and there is an editor, compiler, etc., record the name in field 7XX.\n\nTreat cartographic firms (such as Hammond or Rand McNally), which are responsible for the creation of the maps they produce, as main entries, unless a cartographer is named specifically on the map (e.g., as with many National Geographic maps). In the latter situation, record the cartographer as main entry (100 1_), and include an added entry for the firm (710 field).\n\nAdd the appropriate relationship designators\n\nfor creators (cartographer, creator).\n\nfor contributors (compiler, surveyor, engravor, etc.)\n\nSearch for an authority record for the heading (personal, corporate, or conference) in the OCLC Authority File, using the authorized form in 1XX. If a personal name or a corporate name is not authorized and there is no precedent for its use represented in ORBIS or in OCLC, use the form of the name as found on the map (last name first for personal names, unless instructed otherwise). Enter a space between initials that accompany a personal surname (e.g., Fischer, M. F. K.), but not between initials that are constituents of a corporate name (e.g., B.F. Goodrich Company).\n\nExamples:\n\nOn source: By George Philip & Son, Ltd.\n\n110 2 ‡a George Philip & Son, ‡e cartographer.\n\nOn source: Cartography by G.F. Cruchley (form as found on the map; no authority record found; and not found in the local catalog)\n\n100 1 ‡a Cruchley, G. F., ‡e cartographer.\n\nOn source: Institut géographique national\n\n*** The corporate body responsible for the creation of the map and issuing the map.\n\n110 2 ‡a Institut geographique national (France), ‡e cartographer, ‡e issuing body.\n\nOn source: Cartography by Hans Oberdorfer for the Hermann Haack Geographisch-Kartographische Anstalt\n\n100 1 ‡a Oberdorfer, Hans, ‡d 1846-1927, ‡e cartographer. 710 2 ‡a Hermann Haack Geographisch-Kartographische Anstalt, ‡e issuing body.\n\n245 ‡a [main title] : ‡b [other title information] / ‡c [statement of responsibility].\n\nIf the record has a main entry (1XX), set the first indicator to 1 (one); if it does not, set the first indicator to 0 (zero).\n\nTranscribe the title of the main map as it appears on the source, including an article, if present. If the title begins with an article, set the second indicator to reflect the number of characters preceding the title proper (including a space, if there is one). If the title does not begin with an article, set the second indicator to 0 (zero).\n\nIf a source is in a cover or has a panel title, and the cover or panel title is more comprehensive than the title on the map (e.g., \"Maputo streets, monuments, and government offices\" on the cover or panel vs. \"Map of Maputo\" on the map), transcribe the cover title in the 245 field. Capitalize the first letter of the first word and the first letter of proper nouns. Use ‡b for other title information (such as subtitles, parallel titles, etc.) and precede it with space-colon ( : ). Transcribe the statement of responsibility in subfield ‡c, following a slash. End the field with a period.\n\nExamples:\n\nOn source: Atlas du Nord de la France, Institut de géographie, Université de Lille.\n\n110 2 ‡a Institut de géographie, Université de Lille, ‡e cartographer, ‡e issuing body. 245 1 0 ‡a Atlas du Nord de la France / ‡c Institut de géographie, Université de Lille.\n\nOn source, panel title: France.\n\n***no statement of responsibility\n\n245 0 0 ‡a France.\n\nOn source: France et ses colonies.

Do not add a 246 field to correct archaisms or vernacular/alternate spellings, e.g., \"Map of the Spice Islands,\" \"Brussel\" (for Brussels)\n\nOn map: Munincipal map of Barstow\n\n245 1 0 ‡a Munincipal map of Barstow. 246 1 ‡i Corrected title: ‡a Municipal map of Barstow\n\nIf the panel title or cover title is more comprehensive in its description of the geographical coverage of the source than the title on the source itself, transcribe it in the 245 field, and transcribe the title on the source in a 246 3_ field. A 500 general note indicating the source of the title given in the 245 field (e.g., \"Panel title\" or \"Cover title\") is required, but is a helpful addition to the record.\n\n245 1 0 ‡a Metropolitan Lhasa, showing tramways. 246 3 ‡a Map of Lhasa 500 ‡a Panel title.\n\n250 (Edition statement) Transcribe edition statement in field 250 in the form as appear on the source.

(Cartographic Materials, p. 185)\n\nSingle map sheet—Single maps can be printed on two or more sheets (usually fewer than 12), are published together, have incomplete borders, and have the main title and legend on only one of the sheets (Map Cataloging Manual, rule 7.2)\n\nMaps set/series—Collections of maps with common unifying features, often similar sized, with the same scale and relief/symbols. They may form a single map when assembled, often will have a collective and individual sheet designations. A distinguishing feature from single maps is that maps set/series are intended to be used individually as well as together. (Map Cataloging Manual, rules 7.2-7.4)\n\nSerials—Map serials are infrequent but when they do occur they look very much like regular serials with serial title constant from issue and a numbering system which includes issue number and date of issue.

There are standard citation forms included in CM Appendix G, or use author and title, and include location in source. This field can include reference to Internet citations as well, citing the url. This field can be repeated if multiple sources were needed to complete the record; however, general practice is to cite only one source. If a full record can be reasonably completed without use of external references, a 510 is not necessary, as the 510 is not meant to replace standard reference work.\n\n534 Original Version Note—This field is mandatory if the item being described is a reprint or is published with the intention of being a new item, when information about the original version is readily available. The reproduction is described in the body of the record, with details relevant to the original given in field 534.\n\n590 Local Note—Use to record information specific to the copy in hand but not the item in general, for example, physical damage and manuscript annotations. However, when cataloging a manuscript item, all notes are copy specific because the item is unique; therefore, all notes in a record for a manuscript item should be in 500 etc as appropriate. Always begin the 590 note with an identification of the Yale holding library and the item’s call number; for example, items in the SML Map Collection, begin the 590 note with “SML” and the call number of the item being described. <need example>\n\n590 ‡a SMLMAP 11hc 1918-Z8: Imperfect.

For maps this must include at least a 651 with the geographic area represented on the map recorded in the $a, or a 650 with the geographic area as a $z qualifier as appropriate.\n\nUse Library of Congress Subject headings and LC Authorities for geographic names.\n\nFor places that have changed names, the current name is used in subject headings regardless of the date of formation of the material being cataloged, unless there are specific instructions to the contrary.\n\nMaps which are geographical in nature will be represented by 651 heading(s), and this is more often than not the case with antiquarian materials. Every map of an identifiable place must have a subject heading for the area. Maps of places that cannot be identified receive no geographic subject headings.\n\nThe more common subfields include:\n\n‡v Maps\n\n‡ v Maps ‡v Early works to 1800\n\n‡v Facsimiles\n\nSome examples of complete 651s:\n\n651 0 ‡a Tuscany (Italy) ‡x History ‡v Maps.\n\n651 0 ‡a North America ‡x Maps ‡v Early works to 1800.\n\n651 0 ‡a Union County (N.J.) ‡v Maps, Manuscript ‡v Early works to 1800.\n\n651 0 ‡a China ‡x Administrative and political divisions ‡v Maps, Manuscript ‡v Early works to 1800.\n\n651 0 ‡a France ‡v Maps, Pictorial ‡v Early works to 1800.\n\n651 0 ‡a Harford County (Md.) ‡v Maps.\n\n651 0 ‡a New Jersey ‡x Boundaries ‡z New York (State) ‡v Maps, Manuscript ‡v Early works to 1800.\n\n651 0 ‡a United States ‡x History ‡y Revolution, 1775-1783 ‡v Maps.\n\nThere are subjects which are often depicted on maps for which a 650 would be appropriate, and a few anomalies as well.
