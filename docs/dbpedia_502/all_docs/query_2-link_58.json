The U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs created the new Travel Advisory System to replace their previous Travel Alerts and Warnings classifications. The new four-tiered system ranks every country based on its current safety and security conditions. The system is designed to help U.S. citizen travelers better understand what is happening internationally and how it could affect them while traveling.\n\nPlanning to travel internationally? Read the travel advisory for your intended destination.\n\nJump to: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, Y, Z\n\nFor travelers specifically concerned with cancellation due to a COVID-19 related reason, Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR) coverage offers travelers the most flexibility. It is the only coverage option available to cover cancellation due to fear of travel. However, this benefit is time-sensitive and has other requirements, so not all travelers are eligible. Find out if your trip is eligible for CFAR coverage, and learn more about the requirements, by following the link below.\n\nLearn More About CFAR Coverage\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnited States Travel Advisory System Overview\n\nTravel Advisory Levels Explained\n\nTravel Advisory Risk Indicators Explained\n\nTravel Advisories Issued by U.S. State Department\n\nUnited States Travel Advisory System Overview\n\nThe new Travel Advisory system replaces the previous “Travel Alert” and “Travel Warning” designations with a four-tiered system.\n\nCountries are rated with a Travel Advisory level number 1 through 4, based on their risk level to U.S. travelers. The level numbers advise the following: Level 1 - Exercise Normal Precautions, Level 2 - Exercise Increased Caution, Level 3 – Reconsider Travel, Level 4 - Do Not Travel.\n\nCountries assigned a Travel Advisory level of 2 or more will also be assigned a risk indicator.\n\nA risk indicator is a letter that represents a specific reason for the Travel Advisory level number. It also gives particular recommendations for U.S. citizens traveling to that country. A single country can carry more than one risk indicator depending on the stability and security conditions of its regions. Potential risk indicators include C (Crime), T (Terrorism), U (Civil Unrest), H (Health), N (Natural Disaster), E (Time-limited Event), K (Kidnapping/Hostage Taking), O (Other).\n\nTravel Advisory Levels Explained\n\nThe new travel advisory system was designed to give U.S. citizens more timely, clear, and reliable information regarding security threats abroad.\n\nUnder the new system, each country will have a corresponding numerical value, ranging from 1 to 4, which indicates that country’s current safety and security status. The new system provides reasons as to why the countries were ranked as such and offers specific advice to Americans who wish to travel to the given destinations.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, countries in levels 1 and 2 are to be reviewed annually while countries in levels 3 and 4 will be reviewed every six months. The schedule may change in response to particular and unforeseen occurrences, such as natural disasters.\n\nThe ratings were assigned based on each country’s current security condition and the U.S. government’s assessment of their situation.\n\nLevel 1 - Exercise Normal Precautions\n\nLevel 1 is the lowest advisory level.\n\nCountries in this rank are considered the safest.\n\nTravelers are advised to exercise standard precautions against usual risks and concerns that travelers can encounter in any international travel.\n\nLevel 2 - Exercise Increased Caution\n\nLevel 2 countries are those that are fairly safe.\n\nHowever, these countries have a higher chance of disorder or attacks in some areas.\n\nTravelers are encouraged to be more alert and aware of their surroundings.\n\nLevel 3 - Reconsider Travel\n\nLevel 3 is composed of countries in which travelers may encounter serious risk to their safety.\n\nThese countries may have dense areas of terrorism threats or be affected by natural disasters; in which case, basic necessities can be undersupplied.\n\nLevel 4 – Do Not Travel\n\nLevel 4 is the highest security level due to life-threatening risks, such as nuclear terrorism threats, ongoing rebellions, war, and bombings. Citizens are encouraged not to visit the countries. If anything is to happen during travel to these countries, the U.S. government may have very limited ability to provide assistance.\n\nTravel Advisory Risk Indicators Explained\n\nTravel Advisories at Levels 2-4 contain clear reasons for the level assigned, using established risk indicators and specific advice to U.S. citizens who choose to travel there. These are:\n\nC - Crime: Widespread violent or organized crime is present in areas of the country. Local law enforcement may have limited ability to respond to serious crimes.\n\nT - Terrorism: Terrorist attacks have occurred and/or specific threats against civilians, groups, or other targets may exist.\n\nU - Civil Unrest: Political, economic, religious, and/or ethnic instability exists and may cause violence, major disruptions, and/or safety risks.\n\nH - Health: Health risks, including current disease outbreaks or a crisis that disrupts a country’s medical infrastructure, are present. The issuance of a Centers for Disease Control Travel Notice may also be a factor.\n\nN - Natural Disaster: A natural disaster, or its aftermath, poses danger.\n\nE - Time-Limited Event: Short-term event, such as elections, sporting events, or other incidents that may pose safety risks.\n\nK - Kidnapping or Hostage Taking: Criminal or terrorist individuals or groups have threatened to and/or have seized or detained and threatened to kill, injure or continue to detain individuals in order to compel a third party (including a governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing something as a condition of release.\n\nO - Other: There are potential risks not covered by previous risk indicators. Read the country’s Travel Advisory for details.\n\nPlease Note: The rankings, risk indicators, and advisories may change without prior notice as conditions in every country can change any time. The Risk Indicators and the overall ranking of each country are not the same. There is one overall ranking for every country depending on how many risks are present in their territory.\n\nTravel Advisories Issued by U.S. State Department\n\nJump to: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, Y, Z\n\nAfghanistan - Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nDate Issued: Mon, 29 Jul 2024\n\nReissued after periodic review with updates to reflect the security environment and immigration information.\n\nDo not travel to Afghanistan due to terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, civil unrest, kidnapping and crime.\n\nCountry Summary: The U.S. Embassy in Kabul suspended operations in 2021.

The Taliban have harassed and detained aid and humanitarian workers. The activities of foreigners may be viewed with suspicion, and reasons for detention may be unclear.

The Taliban do not regularly permit the United States to conduct welfare checks on U.S. citizens in detention, including by phone. Detention can be lengthy. While in detention, U.S. citizens have limited or no access to medical attention and may be subject to physical abuse. The Taliban may not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual Afghan-U.S. citizen or have a claim to Afghan citizenship, which further limits our ability to assist.\n\nIndividuals should not travel to Afghanistan for any reason, including to accompany eligible family members for relocation. U.S. citizen or LPRs do not have to be physically present in Afghanistan for their qualifying family members to receive such assistance. For further information on how to assist your family members with the immigrant visa application process or to request relocation assistance for family, please refer to our website.\n\nU.S. citizens who are in Afghanistan are urged to depart immediately via commercial means if possible.

Reconsider travel to Burma due to limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources, and areas with land mines and unexploded ordnances. Exercise increased caution due to wrongful detentions.\n\nCOUNTRY SUMMARY: The Burma military regime detained and deposed elected government officials in a February 2021 coup d'état. Protests and demonstrations against military rule continue, often on significant dates. The military has responded to those protests by arbitrarily detaining individuals and with the indiscriminate use of deadly force against protesters and bystanders.\n\nThe Department of State has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the military regime exists.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Burma due to security concerns amidst the ongoing armed conflict. This may be of particular concern to crime victims outside of Rangoon.\n\nTo mitigate safety and security risks, U.S. government employees’ dependents, under the age of 21, cannot reside in Burma with their U.S. government parent assigned to work in Burma.\n\nCivil unrest and armed conflict occur throughout Burma. The level of civil unrest and armed conflict varies significantly between and within states and regions and may change at any time.\n\nCivil unrest and armed violence due to fighting between the military regime and various ethnic groups and militias occur particularly in parts of Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Rakhine, and Shan States, as well as in Sagaing and Magway regions.\n\nImprovised explosive devices (IEDs) are used in the ongoing armed conflicts, including within the greater Rangoon area. From January to December 2023, the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon calculated an average of fifteen IEDs per month detonated against regime targets, while an average of eight unexploded IEDs were discovered and safely disposed of per month by security authorities. Outside of Rangoon, there have been IED attacks against checkpoints and other critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) exist throughout Burma, NGOs working on this issue state the greatest concerns are in Shan, Chin, and Kachin State. The locations of landmines and UXO are often not marked or otherwise unidentifiable.\n\nThe military regime arbitrarily enforces local laws, including often detaining individuals without respect for their fair trial guarantees or other applicable rights. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, are not excluded from this practice. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Burma may be detained and regime authorities could deny access to U.S. consular services or information about the alleged crime.\n\nLocal law enforcement officials may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for speaking out or protesting against the military regime, including on their personal social media accounts, and for sending private electronic messages critical of the military regime. Facebook and X (Twitter) are banned in Burma. Police have sought bribes from individuals using a virtual private network (VPN) to access social media sites even though VPN use is legal.\n\nBurma has limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources due to critical staffing shortages in the public sector health workforce. Importation of medical supplies, including medicine, into Burma is not consistent and medical prescriptions and over-the-counter medicine may not be available.\n\nBurma’s military conscription law was first introduced in 2010 but historically was not widely implemented. The military regime officially implemented the law in April 2024. In general, Burmese males aged 18 to 35 and Burmese females aged 18 to 27 will need to register for military service and report for duty if ordered by regime authorities. Burmese males aged 18 to 45 and Burmese females aged 18 to 35 in specific expert/professional occupations must serve if called upon by the regime.

U.S. citizens in the PRC may be subjected to interrogations and detention without fair and transparent treatment under the law.\n\nForeigners in the PRC, including but not limited to businesspeople, former foreign-government personnel, academics, relatives of PRC citizens involved in legal disputes, and journalists have been interrogated and detained by PRC officials for alleged violations of PRC national security laws. The PRC has also interrogated, detained, and expelled U.S. citizens living and working in the PRC.\n\nPRC authorities appear to have broad discretion to deem a wide range of documents, data, statistics, or materials as state secrets and to detain and prosecute foreign nationals for alleged espionage. There is increased official scrutiny of U.S. and third-country firms, such as professional service and due diligence companies, operating in the PRC. Security personnel could detain U.S. citizens or subject them to prosecution for conducting research or accessing publicly available material inside the PRC.\n\nSecurity personnel could detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC, Hong Kong SAR, or Macau SAR governments.\n\nIn addition, the PRC government has used restrictions on travel or departure from the PRC, or so-called exit bans, to:\n\ncompel individuals to participate in PRC government investigations;\n\npressure family members of the restricted individual to return to the PRC from abroad;\n\nresolve civil disputes in favor of PRC citizens; and\n\ngain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.\n\nU.S. citizens might only become aware of an exit ban when they attempt to depart the PRC, and there may be no available legal process to contest an exit ban in a court of law. Relatives, including minor children, of those under investigation in the PRC may become subject to an exit ban.\n\nThe PRC government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment. If you are a U.S. citizen and choose to enter Mainland China on travel documents other than a U.S. passport and are detained or arrested, the PRC government may not notify the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Consulates General or allow consular access.\n\nCheck with the PRC Embassy in the United States for the most updated information on travel to the PRC. In some limited circumstances travelers to Mainland China may face additional COVID-19 testing requirements to enter some facilities or events.\n\nThe Department of State does not provide or coordinate direct medical care to private U.S. citizens abroad. U.S. citizens overseas may receive PRC-approved COVID-19 vaccine doses where they are eligible.\n\nDo not consume drugs in the PRC or prior to arriving in the PRC. A positive drug test, even if the drug was legal elsewhere, can lead to immediate detention, fines, deportation, and/or a ban from re-entering the PRC.

Penalties for drug offense may exceed penalties imposed in the United States.\n\nDemonstrations: Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges.
