By the middle of the seventeenth century the revenues pouring in to the Portuguese treasury from the sugar exports of Brazil were so enormous that King John IV could baldly refer to the South American colony as his \"milch cow\".(1) What was true for Portugal was even more true for Spain: 16,887 tons of silver and 1,813 tons of gold from America were registered in Spanish ports between 1501 and 1650, and probably even more was smuggled in at the same time. Still larger quantities were dispatched to Spain during the next century and a half.(2) These remittances of precious metals from America allowed the Spanish kings to maintain their power in Europe when their European resources alone would have been insufficient for that task.(3) Perhaps even more importantly, commercial profits earned by private individuals in both the Portuguese and Spanish empires greatly surpassed the share acquired by the Iberian monarchs. Colonialism, in short, led to both commercial expansion and increased government revenues for Portugal and Spain.\n\nTo maximize their shares of the benefits of colonialism, the Iberian governments had to minimize their expenditures in America. The Spanish crown, unlike the Portuguese, could accomplish this to a great extent by relying on native political elites to enforce colonial rule. The result was that only a handful of royal officials was sufficient to rule over millions of Indians;(4) \"Spain governs, but does not administer\",(5) in the words of Pierre Chaunu. Minimizing administrative costs also meant keeping the bureaucracy small and salaries low.\n\nNeedless to say, these penny-pinching policies had their own costs. This essay seeks to explain how the Spanish government held down administrative expenses in the kingdom of Guatemala (a political entity embracing what are now the Central American republics of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, as well as the Mexican state of Chiapas). It will also analyse the costs resulting from that policy. One of these is what, in modern parlance, is called governmental corruption.\n\nThe ultimate result, however, was much more than simply corruption. An entire commercial system based on government officials came into existence. The Spanish corregidores (magistrates), alcaldes mayores (high magistrates) and governors who ruled in the kingdom of Guatemala in reality were entrepreneurs who organized a variety of business activities that effected the economic integration of the whole of Central America. They succeeded because their political power allowed them to use coercion, rather than market forces, to get the local population, especially the Indian peasantry, to comply with their demands. Colonialism was thus an essential feature of commercial exchange, for market forces alone would not have resulted in the transfer of profits away from the peasants on the scale desired by the merchant class. Political power allowed magistrates in Central America to isolate the producers from merchant competitors and acquire the lion's share of the surplus.\n\nAt the same time, professional merchants, rather than competing with the government officials, became their partners in crime -- for the activities were of course illegal -- and funnelled capital to the magistrates who used their political power to make the investments yield a profit. This was accomplished by ensuring the enforcement of contracts and collection of debts -- which economic power alone could not always accomplish. Moreover political power could be used to establish local monopolies, thereby eliminating troublesome competitors. In fact, in other contexts, the need to acquire political power to enforce commercial contracts and exclude foreign commercial interlopers was one of the major causes of European colonial expansion.(6)\n\nIn Spanish Central America, then, the servants of the state served as essential intermediaries between European capital and American peasants and landowners. Government officials helped mobilize and invest capital, channelled the surplus away from producers, and then split the profits with their merchant partners. In short, the state played a leading role in capital accumulation under colonialism. \"Corruption\" was therefore an integral and necessary part of the colonial system. It was the means of maintaining a bureaucracy at little cost, and considerable benefit, to the crown.(7) It provided the government with people who volunteered their services to the state in return for the opportunity to enrich themselves. Commercial opportunities, however, were limited by the availability of human as well as natural resources. Imperial political structure was thus intimately related to the local economy and society. Colonialism in Central America benefited the Spaniards because imperial demands interacted with, and adapted to, the local ecology, people and structures of production.\n\nI\n\nThe Spanish government in the kingdom of Guatemala kept costs down by maintaining a minuscule bureaucracy outside the capital city of Santiago (modern-day Antigua). The provinces were ruled by a small number of governors, alcaldes mayores and corregidores.(8) Gubernatorial positions entailed significant military duties, and consequently governors were appointed only in those provinces in which the threat of invasion or piracy was significant. The other jurisdictions were run by either alcaldes mayores or corregidores. Functionally these two officials were exactly alike; different titles existed because at the time of the creation of the posts the provinces to which high magistrates were assigned were considered to be of greater importance. As time went on even this original difference between the two positions was forgotten, and eventually the terms alcalde mayor and corregidor became almost interchangeable. Frequently the crown itself was uncertain as to which type of magistrate was to be posted to a particular province. The only important difference between the two posts was that the salary of an alcalde mayor was usually twice that of a corregidor.\n\nIn addition to the magistrates, a total of six officials of the royal exchequer also served in the provinces. Honduras and Nicaragua each received two of these, while Sonsonate (in modern-day El Salvador) and Costa Rica each got one. The total number of salaried officials was therefore quite small. In the late seventeenth century a total of four governors, eight alcaldes mayores, six corregidores and six exchequer officials -- twenty-four people in all -- governed the kingdom of Guatemala's eighteen provinces. Thereafter the size of this bureaucracy did not expand significantly. In the 1740s only twenty-five officials -- four governors, nine high magistrates, six magistrates and six exchequer employees -- were sufficient to rule nineteen provinces. In the 1750s two more high magistracies were created, and still another was instituted in 1770. However, since at the same time the post of one of the corregidores was eliminated, as late as the 1770s the salaried officials who ruled over the twenty-one provinces totalled only twenty-seven people.\n\nWhile the crown was maintaining a small state apparatus, it was also successful in keeping down the salaries of the officials who served the state. In the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century governors earned between 600 and 2,400 pesos(9) annually, and alcaldes mayores received between 331 and 800. The salaries of corregidores were not even recorded; they were set arbitrarily by the kingdom's audiencia (high court). Later, the Council of the Indies in Spain established salaries for the lesser magistrates at a level of about half that of the major ones. These pay scales were still in effect when the Spanish monarchy passed from the Habsburgs to the Bourbons in 1701. Thereafter some officials were given pay rises, but most were not. As Table 1 demonstrates, two of four governors, five of nine alcaldes mayores and four of five corregidores were being paid in the 1760s what their predecessors had been paid -- or in some cases even less -- up to a century earlier. When inflation is taken into account, the crown had in fact lowered the real salaries of the majority of its officials. In the kingdom of Guatemala the Spanish crown thus enjoyed considerable success in keeping the bureaucracy small and bureaucrats' salaries low. Needless to say, this royal niggardliness, far from contributing to effective government, often resulted in little or no government. Inevitably the defects of a system of colonialism on the cheap accumulated, and in the late eighteenth century the Spanish Bourbon monarchy chose to abandon the Habsburg tradition of parsimony and introduce a reform programme involving the substantial expansion of the bureaucracy and a considerable increase in the salaries of officials. The Bourbons implemented these changes because eventually the costs of the old system had come to outweigh the benefits. A clue to the nature of those costs is found in the willingness of prospective office-holders not only to accept extremely low salaries but even to pay for the privilege of being underpaid.\n\n[TABULAR DATA 1 OMITTED]\n\nThe sale of magistracies began in the 1670s, when the government of the last Habsburg king, Charles II, introduced the measure in a desperate attempt to tap all possible sources of revenue. Technically these offices were not sold at all; a post was granted to a worthy subject who had performed what was euphemistically called a \"monetary service\" for the king. Moreover the sale of posts was directly related to the crown's need to raise money for wartime expenditures, and when Spain was at peace the offices were no longer sold but rather given away to veteran soldiers as rewards for valour and as compensation for bodily injury received in the king's service. The sale of magistracies thus ceased in peacetime, even in the latter years of the reign of Charles II.\n\nUnfortunately for those who wanted to improve the honesty of government officials, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Spain was at war more often than it was at peace. As a result, offices were more commonly sold than given away. And when the money offered was considered to be insufficient, hints were given. For example, when a would-be office-holder offered to buy the alcaldia mayor (high magistracy) of Huehuetenango(10) in 1706 for 3,500 pesos, the Council of the Indies in Spain demurred, noting that the position was \"known to have brought in a larger sum in the past [since] this post, like others in that kingdom, was greatly sought after\". When the applicant raised his offer to 4,000 pesos -- which was still short of the 5,500 pesos for which the magistracy had sold in 1697 -- he was appointed forthwith.(11)\n\nNot all positions could be so easily sold, for reasons to be made clear later. The high magistracy of Escuintla (covering the southeastern Pacific coast of modern Guatemala) was sold twice in the 1690s, and once more in 1709, but for the most part few people wanted the post, and those assigned to it almost always asked to be transferred or relieved. No one ever offered to buy the governorship of Costa Rica -- despite its high salary -- or the corregimiento (magistracy) of Realejo (on the north-western Pacific coast of Nicaragua). Other posts were sold for small sums. The corregimiento of Sebaco (in modern northern Nicaragua) went for a mere 400 pesos, while that of Chiquimula de la Sierra (eastern highland Guatemala) and the governorship of Nicaragua sold for up to 1,000 pesos, and the magistracy of Sutiaba (north-western Nicaragua) fetched up to 1,500 pesos.\n\nOn the other hand, some positions sold for small fortunes. The corregimiento of Quezaltenango, the high magistracies of Huehuetenango, Atitlan, Suchitepequez, Verapaz (all in modern-day Guatemala) and San Salvador and the governorship of Soconusco (the coast of modern-day Chiapas)(12) sold for between 4,000 and 6,000 pesos. Most expensive of all was the alcaldia mayor of Chiapa, which sold for more than 9,000 pesos; this was in fact one of the most expensive provincial posts in the Spanish American empire. Some positions were so valuable that the government used them as assets or even as collateral for loans. For example, in 1682 the crown awarded the governorship of Soconusco in return for a 6,000-peso loan at 8 per cent interest and 6,000 pesos in cash.(13) In the same year the alcaldia mayor of Chiapa was sold for a cash payment of 4,000 pesos and a no-interest loan of 2,000 pesos, while three years later the same post was awarded in return for another 4,000 pesos in cash plus a 2,000-peso loan at 8 per cent interest.(14) In 1683 the high magistracy of Suchitepequez was sold for 6,000 pesos plus a 6,000-peso no-interest loan, while that of Verapaz went for 4,000 pesos and a no-interest loan of 1,000 pesos.(15) This practice became less common under the Bourbons. Still, in 1731 the crown granted Chiapa and the corregimiento of Quezaltenango, as well as the governorship of Tlaxcala (in New Spain) to a Mexico City merchant as repayment for the forced loan of 35,345 pesos made to the crown back in 1714.(16)\n\nThe government also accepted payment in kind, or at least of particular kinds. In 1686 the governorship of Honduras was given to Sancho Ordonez in return for two large patrol boats, to be delivered for service on the Ulua River within eight months.(17) In 1692 the governorship of Soconusco was awarded to Nicolas de Rioja Zuniga in return for raising and equipping at his own cost a force of 420 infantry to serve in the war in Europe.(18) In 1703 the crown appointed Juan Mier del Tojo, a member of the consulado (merchant guild) of Seville, as alcalde mayor of Atitlin in return for having provided a fire-ship used in Vigo against the Anglo-Dutch fleet.(19)\n\nPosts were also used as compensation, as when in 1680 the corregimiento of Nicoya was given to Joseph de Albelda in return for land that the government had appropriated for the site of the new Panama City.(20) The crown also awarded magistracies in return for other posts that were being eliminated. When the position of Accountant of the Santa Cruzada -- the body which sold indulgences to raise money for church and state -- was abolished in 1751, Cristobal Galvez Corral, whose family had purchased the post in the 1690s and who himself had paid 26,000 pesos to succeed his father as Accountant in 1729, was awarded the magistracy of San Salvador with the special right to occupy the position for ten years. Galvez Corral himself undoubtedly suggested this form of compensation, for he had already served as alcalde mayor of San Salvador in the 1730s and certainly knew the business.(21)\n\nSince almost all magistracies were granted for five-year terms, and since incumbents were rarely reappointed, the payment of large sums of money in fact meant -- as Table 2 demonstrates -- that the purchaser was frequently paying more than he would receive in salary during his entire tenure in office. To make matters worse, other costs in practice made these posts even more expensive. Since 1631 the crown had required all prospective salaried office-holders to pay in advance one half of the first year's salary. This payment, called the media anata, was eventually made subject to a surcharge of one-third, for what were called emoluments -- the perquisites of office -- and then the total was taxed an additional 18 per cent for remitting the money from America to Spain. This last impost was instituted to take into account the large number of offices being sold to people already in the colonies. Once introduced, however, this 18 per cent surcharge was inevitably applied even to people who bought their positions while in Spain.\n\nThese taxes and other charges ended up taking some 78.5 per cent of an office-holder's earnings in his first year, or about 16 per cent of the cumulative five-year salary. Net incomes, however, were further reduced by other expenses. A majority of magistrates received their appointments while in Spain and had to travel to America to take up their posts. Yet the crown paid nothing for travel expenses. Then, once in the colonies, the official had to demonstrate generosity -- that is, provide gifts -- to the judges of the audiencia in order to be given the oath of office. This must have been a substantial cost, which is why the crown provided an alternative for those who received their appointments in Spain: they could take the oath in Cadiz and avoid paying bribes to the judges in America, if they paid 50 pesos to the Convent of San Telmo in Seville.\n\nExpenses did not cease once the appointee took up his post. Since the crown provided no funds to pay for administrative costs, these were borne entirely by the office-holder himself. Moreover bureaucratic duties and the large extent of territory under his jurisdiction required the official to hire at least one secretary and sometimes one, two or even three lieutenants to preside over official business in distant locations. Magistrates also had to contribute sums from their own pockets to help equip the local militia, and were even expected to lead the community in charitable work such as maintaining hospitals and churches.\n\nAll told, then, the monetary burdens placed on office-holders were such that their salaries were widely reputed to be insufficient even to defray administrative expenses, let alone provide a living for the official and his family. Moreover personal disaster threatened those who purchased these posts. Office-holders might be driven from office either by Indian rebellions or by the opposition of powerful local elites. There was also the possibility of the buyer's dying before completing his tenure in office and thus before recouping his investment. To prevent such misfortune, purchasers frequently requested, and received, the right to name replacements. The crown readily assented to appointing substitutes chosen by the purchaser should the latter for some reason fail to take up his post. At first this assent required an additional \"monetary service\", as when the heirs of Luis de Ayala, who had bought the corregimiento of Quezaltenango in 1689 for 4,500 pesos but died before taking office, were required to pay another 1,000 for the right to name a replacement.(22) Similarly, when Diego Olaya Vivanco, a resident of Mexico City, chose not to serve as governor of Soconusco, which post he had bought in 1708 for 5,000 pesos, he had to pay an additional 600 pesos in 1712 for the right to name Joseph Damian Fernandez de Cordoba, city councillor of Santiago, to serve in his place.(23) And Juan Joseph de la Rea, named governor of Nicaragua in 1711, paid 1,300 pesos four years later so that his cousin, Gaspar de la Rea, could take up the position.(24)\n\nEventually purchasers took precautionary measures to protect their families should they die while in office by having the right to name successors included in the original terms of purchase. Thus, when Francisco Franco paid 3,500 pesos in 1707 for the alcaldia mayor of San Salvador, he was given permission to have his heirs name his replacement in the event of death or inability to serve.(25) In the following year Manuel de Porras bought the high magistracy of Tegucigalpa for 2,800 pesos and named his brother as his replacement in case of death.(26) In 1713 Juan Rodriguez de la Gala, who bought the magistracy of Quezaltenango for 3,200 pesos, was given the right to name his son to replace him.(27) And when Joseph de Argarate bought the alcaldia mayor of San Salvador in 1724 for 4,000 pesos, he named his wife to appoint someone to replace him should that become necessary; it did, for Argarate died and his widow nominated his successor.(28)\n\nBuyers sometimes spelt out the succession in detail. When Manuel de Lacunza bought the high magistracy of Suchitepequez for 4,500 pesos in 1731, he named Guillermo Martinez Pereda and Manuel Munoz, in that order, to succeed him. All three men eventually served in the post, for the first two died in office.(29) When Joseph Salgado Artunduaga purchased the corregimiento of Sutiaba for 1,500 pesos in 1735, he was given the right to appoint \"any of his brothers, or whoever marries [his sister] Dona Maria Manuela de Salgado Artunduaga, or if all else fails Don Pedro Fajardo or Don Thomas Sunsin\" to replace him.(30) Purchasers thus learned to protect their investments. Such measures became more important as time went on, for eventually those who bought posts had to wait longer and longer before taking them up. This was because the demand for positions was greater than the supply, and the crown discovered that it could sell the same post more than once by selling \"futures\", that is, the right to succeed to a post after prior purchasers had served their time. In other words, buyers formed a queue while the government drew up a waiting-list.\n\nThis meant that there was frequently a considerable time-lag between the purchase and the assumption of office. The high magistracy of Suchitepequez, for example, was sold in 1731 for 4,500 pesos, but the buyer, Manuel de Lacunza, had to wait eight years before taking up his post, while Manuel Antonio de Lazalde, who bought the same position for the same sum in 1738, had to wait ten years.(31) Isidro Diaz de Vivar, who acquired the alcaldia mayor of San Salvador in 1734 for 4,000 pesos, had to wait almost fifteen years before taking office.(32) The prospect of waiting so long led Bernabe de la Torre Trassierra, who paid 4,600 pesos for San Salvador in 1746, to request permission to go to Brazil and Peru in order to finish up some business affairs there while he waited. Because his return was delayed, Domingo de Soto Bermudez, who bought the same post for the same amount in 1750, was allowed to assume office first. De la Torre Trassierra finally succeeded in taking up his post in 1757.(33)\n\nSuch long periods of waiting, however, were sometimes nothing but a minor inconvenience, for some buyers put their time to good use by taking up other offices. Diego de los Rios bought the future governorship of Soconusco in 1688 for 6,500 pesos, but before assuming that post he first served as high magistrate of Cholula (New Spain), which he had purchased earlier.(34) In 1709 Manuel de Porras bought the alcaldia mayor of Escuintla for 1,000 pesos because he would have to wait years before assuming the high magistracy of Tegucigalpa, which he had purchased the year before for 2,800 pesos with the right to name his brother as his replacement.(35) Juan Rodriguez de la Gala must have been thinking of the distant future when in 1713 he purchased the corregimiento of Quezaltenango for 4,000 pesos with the right to name his son as his replacement; he had just bought the alcaldia mayor of Tabasco (New Spain) and had yet to take up that post.(36)\n\nPeople serving as royal officials in other capacities also joined the queue of buyers waiting to take office. In 1711 the highest-ranking officer of the royal exchequer in the kingdom of Guatemala, Comptroller Diego Rodriguez Menendez -- who had purchased his lifetime position in the exchequer in 1696 for 3,500 pesos -- decided to change his hat, so to speak, and paid 4,000 pesos for the high magistracy of Huehuetenango and the right to name his cousin as his replacement in case of death. Two years later, while still waiting to take up his post in Huehuetenango, Rodriguez Menendez spent 4,500 pesos for the future right to the alcaldia mayor of Verapaz. He was not required to give up his lifetime position as Comptroller, and so as to be able to hold down two posts concurrently, he was given permission to appoint a temporary substitute to carry out his functions at the exchequer in his absence, a procedure which he had used a few years earlier when he had served as interim high magistrate of Huehuetenango.(37)\n\nThe only factor preventing the sale of future positions a century in advance was peace. For when Spain was no longer at war, the sale of most of these positions ceased. As a result no one new joined the queue and the waiting-list got shorter. Appointments then were made to deserving individuals, usually to soldiers who received the posts in hell of pensions. This was true even for some of the most valuable positions. The governorship of Soconusco, which sold for 5,000 pesos in 1708, was awarded in 1716, without a \"monetary service\", to Captain Francisco Antonio Pimentel Sotomayor, who had served as company commander in disease-ridden Havana for almost thirteen years.(38) Similarly, Quezaltenango, which sold for 4,000 pesos in 1713, was awarded three years later to Pedro de Andueza, who had served in Manila -- even more unhealthy than Havana -- for seventeen years.(39) Suchitepequez had brought the crown 4,500 pesos in 1711 but was granted for no payment in 1717 to Miguel Perez de Velasco, a resident of Havana who had helped rescue the silver when the treasure fleet went down in a hurricane in 1715.(40)\n\nThe resumption of hostilities, especially with Great Britain, forced the crown to resume the sale of offices. Suchitepequez, for example, having been sold for 4,500 pesos in 1694 and then given as an award for military service in 1702, was sold for 4,500 pesos in 1712, 1713 and 1718. Similarly, Soconusco, Quezaltenango and Suchitepequez, given as rewards for military service in 1716-17, were all sold in the next round of appointments. The following period of peace led once more to the awarding of posts: between 1722 and 1725 Suchitepequez, Verapaz, Tegucigalpa, San Salvador and Quezaltenango were awarded without \"monetary service\". Still another round of appointments made for military service occurred just before the Seven Years War: between 1753 and 1758 Verapaz, Tegucigalpa, Sonsonate and even Chiapa -- the most expensive post of all -- were all granted free of charge (except, of course, for the usual taxes).(41) These periods of peace, however, were too brief to make any significant change in the system. Most posts continued to be occupied by people who had purchased them, and in some cases the queue of office-buyers endured longer than the peace. For most people, positions in government were not so much rewards for serving the king as they were opportunities to serve themselves.\n\nII\n\nPeople invested large quantities of money to buy posts because political power was translated into personal gain. The nature of commercial opportunity, however, depended on local economic, social and geographic conditions. Of these, one of the most significant was the availability of human resources. Indians made up the vast majority of the population of the kingdom of Guatemala. Not all of these people, however, proved useful. Least valuable were the non-Mesoamerican Indians settled in Escuintla (southeastern Guatemala), eastern San Salvador, most of Honduras, eastern Nicaragua and Costa Rica.(42) These people were very close to the subsistence level and thus could not be made to produce a surplus for the conquerors. Moreover most of them lived in lowland areas in which tropical diseases eventually became endemic. Consequently the non-Mesoamerican people had little chance of surviving or recovering from demographic collapse combined with what proved to be the excessive demands of Spanish colonialism.(43) For the prospective buyer of magistracies in Central America, the areas populated by non-Mesoamerican Indians offered few prospects for profits to be made at the expense of the native people.\n\nMore valuable were the Nahua, or Mexican,(44) Indians found in some parts of Soconusco, Sonsonate, most of San Salvador, Tegucigalpa, Sdbaco, Realejo, Sutiaba, highland Nicaragua, Nicoya and even parts of modern-day Guatemala (Verapaz and Chiquimula de la Sierra). These were Mesoamerican people who had developed a productive agricultural economy and a complex social structure, and consequently their ability to survive both demographic disaster and colonialism was much greater than that of many other Indians. Magistrates therefore usually found ways of getting a share of the surplus produced by the Nahua peoples of Central America.\n\nMost valuable of all were the Maya, who populated Chiapa, Soconusco, all the magistracies of modern-day Guatemala and a small part of western Honduras. These were people of considerable economic productivity and social complexity, and in addition many were settled in areas removed from the disease-infested coastal lowlands. They therefore had a better chance of surviving the impact of demographic decline and colonialism. Moreover Spaniards found it to be in their interest to preserve the existing structure of production. For the colonists, the Maya were the proverbial geese laying golden eggs.\n\nThe nature of Indian society was thus a crucial factor determining relationships between the colonists and the colonized. The Spaniards displaced the native elite as the upper class and thereafter received the lion's share of the surplus, but the colonists still had to rely on the traditional village rulers to collect and deliver the tribute. In return, the Indian leaders, or caciques, not only received a share of what was collected, they were also granted hidalgo (noble) status, and as nobles were exempt from tribute and labour obligations and were given special privileges like using swords and guns. Maya and Nahua society thus continued to be socially stratified and politically well organized. But where these social and political structures did not exist, as was the case among non-Mesoamerican Indians, Spaniards could not introduce them, and the native people could not produce a surplus.\n\nIn addition to the structure of Indian society, natural resources helped determine the profitability of government posts in Central America. Because of the combination of highlands and lowlands in tropical latitudes, this part of the world is characterized by extreme ecological diversity. Of course, not all environments were beneficial to human beings, for once the lowlands became disease-infested humans had great difficulty surviving. Consequently the native population of the entire Atlantic and Pacific coasts almost disappeared because of epidemics and endemic tropical fevers. On the other hand, the complex environment also offered a variety of crops, and hence marketable goods, for human use. The lowlands and piedmont areas could produce cacao, indigo and cotton. The highlands, although sometimes barren, could be made to produce wheat and maize and to serve as pasture for animals. Some mountainous areas contained silver deposits. And finally, the highlands could serve as a healthy environment in which a large population could live and, of course, work.\n\nSpanish magistrates tried to profit from their positions by carrying out a variety of enterprises.(45) Of these, by far the most important was the acquisition of the products of the Indian economy. This was made possible by the indigenous people's chronic need for money to pay their tribute and religious taxes. Magistrates turned this need to their own advantage by paying the church and the exchequer what the Indians owed and then demanding repayment in kind. Working through the native village rulers, Spanish officials could force the villagers to repay their debts in specific goods. If the people tried to resist, they were flogged by their caciques; and if the caciques failed to deliver the goods, they were flogged by the Spanish officials. In all cases, then, the magistrates depended on the existing structure of production and political system to carry out business with the Indians.\n\nThis particular type of commercial operation, in which magistrates advanced money or credit to the Indians, became known as a repartimiento, a word derived from the verb repartir (to allocate or distribute). Magistrates sometimes allocated raw materials as well as money or credit in return for future payment in kind. In Soconusco, Suchitepequez and Sonsonate repartimientos were carried out to acquire cacao. In highland areas like Chiapa, Quezaltenango and Huehuetenango, magistrates used this method not only to acquire maize, cochineal and wool but also to get wheat, which the Indians did not want to produce but could be coerced into growing by making debts payable only in that grain. In areas of lower altitudes like Nicaragua, Sutiaba, Realejo and northern Verapaz, the repartimiento method was used to make the native people produce cotton, some of which was then distributed to local Indian villages to be woven into textiles and sailcloth. Most of the cotton from the lowlands, however, was transported to the highland provinces of Chiapa, Quezaltenango, Huehuetenango and Atitlan, where it was allocated through a second repartimiento to the Indian villages to be made into textiles.\n\nIn practice, therefore, a large part of the business of the repartimiento system consisted of the allocation of money or credit and of raw materials for textile production. Consequently this was a kind of putting-out system. However, unlike similar structures of production in Europe, this putting-out system was coercive, and was made possible by the colonial relationship between Spaniards and Indians. In all these repartimientos the native people had no choice in the matter: the magistrates routinely got the Indians into debt, and then required them to repay the debts in goods that could be resold at a great profit. As one Maya Indian explained it, cotton was \"put out among the women of the village . . . by force, and if they do not do it [i.e., weave], they are flogged\".(46) Coercion was the sine qua non of the system.\n\nWhen possible, magistrates also made money by allocating Indian labour to Spanish enterprises. This was done to a certain extent in Chiquimula, where the corregidor organized drafts of labourers for the silver-mines in Tegucigalpa and charged the mine-owners for every worker thus provided. It was even more important in San Salvador, where the alcalde mayor practically monopolized the labour supply and therefore profited by charging Spanish landowners for the workers provided for the indigo plantations. The magistrates of the highland Guatemalan province of Atitlan and the area around the capital of Santiago (called the Valley of Guatemala, which in 1752 was divided into the alcaldias mayores of Sacatepequez, and Chimaltenango) used Indian labourers to transport raw cotton from the Pacific coast to the highlands for distribution there through the repartimiento system.\n\nStill another way of profiting at the expense of the Indians was another kind of repartimiento, this time of goods to be forcibly sold to the Indian communities. In some places, like Chiapa and Quezaltenango, this consisted of the forced sale of machetes and mules, a certain number of which were allocated -- hence the term repartimiento -- to the villages. The animals cost the magistrates 14 pesos but were sold to the Indians at 25 pesos. In San Salvador, and especially in the central Valley of Guatemala (Sacatepdquez and Chimaltenango), magistrates required the Indians to purchase textiles manufactured in the other provinces, thus providing a clue as to how some goods produced elsewhere were marketed. This kind of repartimiento therefore forcibly incorporated the Indians into the market economy not as unwilling producers but as unwilling consumers. This business appeared late in colonial Central America. It may have become possible only after the other form of the repartimiento -- forced sales by, rather than to, the Indians -- had raised the level of commercialization to the point that the native economy could bear the additional burden of forced consumption. In fact in the 1760s it was reported in many provinces that the forced sale of goods to Indians was a new activity, and was generating resistance in some areas.(47)\n\nSome posts therefore were profitable in part because magistrates could make money, in one way or another, out of the Indians. Some officials, however, could make profits from Spanish enterprise or by becoming entrepreneurs in their own right. The governors of Honduras, for example, although lacking an Indian society to do business with, found that smuggling could be just as good. They took advantage of their proximity to Jamaica by importing smuggled goods and exporting the indigo and silver produced elsewhere. Corregidores in Realejo profited because their province was located on trade routes. The major business of the magistrate was control of the commerce between Realejo and San Salvador, across the Gulf of Fonseca. This trade included maize to be sold in San Salvador and raw cotton being shipped from Nicaragua to Guatemala. These trade goods were sometimes owned by the corregidor himself, for he carried out repartimientos to acquire both maize and cotton. Magistrates even ran a ferry service connecting Nicaragua with San Salvador.\n\nSome of the most valuable posts were those in which the local Spanish population was engaged in the production of valuable export goods. In Tegucigalpa and San Salvador alcaldes mayores largely controlled the credit necessary to carry out silver and indigo production. They advanced goods and money to the producers and were repaid later in kind, that is, in silver and indigo. They also participated in or even monopolized the wholesale trade in textiles, thus making money through sales of consumer goods. In San Salvador the alcalde mayor was in fact the dominant entrepreneur, for he controlled the credit, the labour supply and a large portion of commerce in general. As a result, he got the lion's share of the province's indigo production. The alcalde mayor of Sonsonate also controlled credit, and used it to acquire rice and indigo. Magistrates in Sutiaba and Nicaragua profited by acquiring and exporting some of the dyewood produced locally. Finally, in Nicoya where there were few Indians to take advantage of, the magistrates found that only a few people were needed to make money, because the province happened to include the Gulf of Nicoya's lucrative pearl fisheries.\n\nDespite all these possible kinds of commercial activity, there were some provinces that simply lacked human or natural resources to be exploited. Escuintla, located on the disease-ridden Pacific coast of Guatemala, could produce a little cacao and cotton, but in such small quantities that a magistrate could not even earn enough to pay his expenses. Few people wanted the post, and fewer still made the mistake of buying it. Similarly, Sebaco, in modern northern Nicaragua, had neither human nor natural resources to exploit, and was too far removed from trade routes for magistrates to engage successfully in commerce, legal or otherwise. The same was true of Costa Rica, a post that no one ever bought during the entire colonial period.\n\nConsequently, local economy, society and geography explain why some posts could only be given away while others could be sold for small fortunes. Chiapa and Soconusco were valuable posts because of cotton textile production and cacao.(46) The official salary of the alcalde mayor of Chiapa was only 800 pesos throughout most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but according to a secret report by the president of the audiencia to the king in 1738, annual profits earned by the high magistrate totalled 12,000 pesos.(49) At an inquiry carried out in 1765-6, a well-informed witness calculated the profits of the magistrates to be over 14,000 pesos.(50) The governor of Soconusco earned a salary of only 600 pesos per year throughout the entire colonial period, but the secret report of 1738 estimated that his real annual income was about 8,000 pesos -- that is, more than thirteen times his salary.\n\nBusiness opportunities also made the magistracies of highland Guatemala quite lucrative. The alcalde mayor of Huehuetenango and the corregidor of Quezaltenango each earned an annual salary of only 331 pesos. However, in 1738 the president estimated that the former in fact made 12,000 pesos, and the latter 10,000 -- that is, more than thirty times their salaries. Their profits were derived overwhelmingly from the textiles acquired from the Indians.(51) In the Valley of Guatemala, the two city councillors who ran the repartimiento system before the creation of the magistracies of Chimaltenango and Sacatepequez were said to have earned up to 12,000 pesos each from their businesses, the most important of which was the forced sale of textiles to the Indians.(52) Presumably the alcaldes mayores who replaced them in 1752 did even better. In the case of Atitlin, the president reported that the alcalde mayor earned over 12,000 pesos, mostly from the acquisition of textiles for sale elsewhere. In 1765 a former magistrate of this province testified that an alcalde mayor could earn between 8,000 and 20,000 pesos annually, depending on his business acumen, market conditions and greed. In fact the Council of the Indies once denied a pension to a former magistrate of Atitlin because he had already held what was described as \"one of the juiciest magistracies of the kingdom of Guatemala\".(53)\n\nThe rest of the Guatemalan provinces were of varying profitability. Because Verapaz produced a good part of the cotton being used for textile production in the central highlands, the alcaldes mayores of that province made good profits.(54) Their annual salary was 1,275 pesos, but the president's report of 1738 estimated their annual income from business activities to be about 8,000 pesos. Suchitepequez, like Soconusco, was a valuable post because of cacao.(55) The secret report of 1738 estimated that the alcalde mayor, whose annual salary was 1,158 pesos, could earn 10,000 pesos from this business, while the corregidor of Chiquimula was thought to earn approximately 6,000 pesos, mostly from the organization of labour drafts for the mines of Tegucigalpa.(56) Least valuable of all the Guatemalan magistracies was Escuintla, where alcaldes mayores found few enterprises worth pursuing.(57)\n\nThe remaining posts in the kingdom tended to be less lucrative than those of Chiapa and highland Guatemala. Nevertheless many were quite profitable and hence desirable. This was especially true of the magistracies of Sonsonate and San Salvador, in modern-day El Salvador.(58) According to the 1738 report, the alcalde mayor of Sonsonate could earn over 1,000 pesos annually from his businesses, but this undoubtedly underestimates the total. Informants in 1765-6 guessed that the magistrate's real income, derived from the export of indigo, rice and cacao, was between 3,000 and 6,000 pesos. More lucrative still was San Salvador, which according to the 1738 report yielded an annual income of 10,000 pesos. Informants in 1765-6 agreed with this estimate, but also pointed out that business, dependent as it was on world trade in indigo, was risky, and consequently not all alcaldes mayores got rich.\n\nThe magistracies of Honduras and Tegucigalpa, making up modern-day Honduras, while less lucrative than those of highland Guatemala, were also profitable for office-holders.(59) Smuggling opportunities made it worth while to pay large sums to buy the governorship of Honduras, but unfortunately no one at the time reported how much money governors could make illegally. In the case of Tegucigalpa, the 1738 report estimated that the alcalde mayor stood to gain over 8,000 pesos from his businesses. Informants in the 1760s, however, emphasized the risks involved in any economy based on mining, and noted that the magistrate's income, dependent as it was on silver production, fluctuated widely from year to year.\n\nThe rest of the magistracies of the kingdom, in modern-day Nicaragua and Costa Rica, were less lucrative and indeed in some cases were virtually worthless. The corregidores of Sebaco-Chontales found few commercial opportunities other than to carry out repartimientos to acquire some thread and textiles from the few surviving Indians in the area.(60) Magistrates were said to make only between 1,000 and 2,000 pesos annually. It is likely that they made very little at all, for the post was sold quite infrequently. Corregidores of Sutiaba had a larger native population to work with, and made money from the Indians through repartimientos to acquire raw cotton as well as some textiles. They also managed to get their hands on some of the dyewood being produced by the non-Indian population.(61) In 1738 the president estimated that the businesses of corregidores in Sutiaba netted them 4,000 pesos annually. The 1738 report made no attempt to quantify the income of the magistrates of Realejo, but informants in 1766 estimated that corregidores could make 2,000 pesos per year from repartimientos for cotton and textiles and by controlling the coastal trade between Nicaragua and San Salvador.(62) Finally, the president considered the governorship of Nicaragua to be worth little in 1738, but frequent inquiries into the governors' activities later in the century revealed that the post eventually became profitable because of opportunities to carry out repartimientos, especially for raw cotton.(63)\n\nIn the case of modern-day Costa Rica, magistrates of Nicoya made money by exploiting the pearl fisheries of the Gulf of Nicoya.(64) The 1738 report estimated the corregidor's income to be about 5,000 pesos, which was considerably better than his annual salary of a miserable 275 pesos. The governors of Costa Rica, however, had no hope for profit in a land without exploitable Indians, natural resources or smuggling opportunities.(65) All informants stressed that this governorship was unprofitable. However, it was strategically important because of the province's proximity to the commercially vital Isthmus of Panama. Therefore the president recommended in 1738 that the post always be given to a professional soldier, and in fact the salary of the governor -- 2,000 ducats (2,400 pesos) throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries -- was the highest of any provincial magistrate in the kingdom. Perhaps that made up for the lack of real commercial opportunity.\n\nIII\n\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century the business enterprises of the magistrates were known collectively as the repartimiento. Except for the twenty years between 1759 and 1779, these activities were illegal. Nevertheless the crown tolerated the enterprises of its officials as long as the Indians were not provoked into outright rebellion. As a result, for over a century magistrates were routinely charged with violating the law and then not only pardoned for the offence but even commended for their actions. Only a handful whose greed surpassed accepted bounds was removed from office or subjected to serious fines.\n\nThe repartimiento system, however, cannot be understood merely as a form of tolerated corruption. It was much more than that. It was above all else a commercial system integrating the provinces of the kingdom of Guatemala. It tied regions of different ecological conditions into a network of trade based on regional specialization and division of labour. Cotton was produced in the valleys and coastal lowlands, especially in Verapaz and in the Nicaraguan magistracies, and transported to highland Guatemala and Chiapa to be made into thread and textiles. The goods manufactured in Chiapa, however, did not stay there, for they had a long way to go before reaching their markets. The textiles, as well as the cochineal and cacao acquired through other repartimientos, were sent north, by mule, to Oaxaca in New Spain.(66) However, taking cotton textiles and cochineal to Oaxaca resembled carrying coals to Newcastle, for Oaxaca was itself a major producer and exporter of those same goods.\"(67) Chiapa's real trade was with Mexico. The Province's skirts (chiapanecas) were even imitated in New Spain.(68) Some cochineal from Chiapa was exported to Spain.\n\nTextiles from highland Guatemala may also have gone north to Mexico. Most, however, were sent to the mining camps of Tegucigalpa (highland Honduras), to the cities and villages of the indigo-producing province of San Salvador, and to the capital of Santiago, where the large-scale merchant houses handled the magistrates' goods and arranged for the investment of the capital that made the wheels of trade turn. Silver and indigo -- produced in part as a result of the capital invested by magistrates and their merchant partners -- in turn were exported to Peru, Mexico and Europe. Cacao was also produced, sold locally and exported to Spain and New Spain.\n\nThe kingdom of Guatemala was thus characterized by regional specialization. The highlands of Chiapa and Guatemala produced the textiles needed in the silver- and indigo-producing regions of Tegucigalpa and San Salvador. The latter two provinces were two more links of the commercial chain tying magistrates from several provinces together into a network of trading relationships and vested interest. Tegucigalpa, San Salvador and, to a lesser extent, Sonsonate produced the vital raw materials exported beyond Central America to Peru, Mexico and Europe. In turn, Tegucigalpa and San Salvador served as the importers of the manufactured goods and foodstuffs produced in the other provinces. Much of the cotton textile manufacturing carried out in the highland Guatemalan provinces of overwhelmingly Maya population was a backward linkage of the export economies of the largely mestizo and mulatto provinces of modern-day El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nEven Nicaragua was an important component of the interregional trading network of Central America. The Nicaraguan magistracies exported nothing to Europe, a little indigo and dye-wood to Peru and a substantial quantity of raw cotton to the textile-manufacturing centres of the kingdom. Some of this reached Chiapa, which exported textiles to Mexico but had to import raw materials for its industry. Thus Nicaraguan cotton, once spun and woven, probably ended up as far north as New Spain.\n\nA large part of this commercial activity was carried out, organized or even monopolized by government officials. Their business activities, especially in cotton textiles, were the Spanish American equivalent of the famous South and East Asian \"country trade\" that Europeans engaged in, dealing in goods demanded in Asia in order to acquire the goods demanded in Europe.(69) The Spanish officials traded in a variety of items sold throughout America in order to get exports for Spain. It was to a great extent due to the magistrates that Central America was tied, directly or indirectly, into the world economy. Corregidores, alcaldes mayores and governors, in short, played vital entrepreneurial roles by helping integrate the provinces into the kingdom and the kingdom into the empire.\n\nAt the same time the repartimiento's involvement with the Indians became one of the most important mechanisms for extracting a surplus from the Indians. Tribute, once the most important mechanism for channelling wealth away from the peasantry to support the colonial elites, eventually became simply an adjunct to the magistrates' business. It is important to note that repartimientos of money or credit were usually carried out on St John's Day (24 June) and at Christmas; by no small coincidence, those dates happened to be when tribute payments were due. By the middle of the eighteenth century many Indians no longer paid their goods and money directly to their caciques, who then delivered them to the magistrates, as in the past; rather, governors, alcaldes mayores and corregidores had their business partners in Santiago pay the tribute to the exchequer. The payment was treated as a normal business expense of the commercial companies which magistrates established with important merchants of the capital.(70) Tribute in effect was the king's share of the profits. The repartimiento, by absorbing the tributary system, became the most important mechanism for extracting wealth from the peasants and for incorporating the Indians of Central America into the regional and world economies.\n\nThe commercial system run by the magistrates worked so well because it took advantage of an already existing sexual division of labour. Forced labour systems, after all, are not limited to the heavy tasks -- usually carried out by males -- of digging, hauling, planting or harvesting. In the well-developed peasant economy of Central America, agriculture was the exclusive domain of Indian males, who produced not only the maize but also the wheat, cacao, wool and cotton, that is, the raw materials so important as trade goods. Quantitatively the most valuable goods of all, however, were textiles and thread, the products of the female sector of the domestic economy. The repartimiento in Central America was thus the means by which local government officials tapped the surplus labour of men, women and children: that is, the entire peasant community.(71)\n\nThe repartimiento also worked well because it took advantage of already existirg structures of production. Spinning, weaving and cultivation of cotton and cacao were traditional branches of the Indian economy; in most places new productive processes were not needed. True, silver-mining and large-scale indigo-production were new, having been introduced by the Spaniards, but these activities only affected the native people of Tegucigalpa, Chiquimula and San Salvador. Disruption of the Indians was thus limited to a few places. For the most part, especially in the highlands of Chiapa and Guatemala, the native people were left alone -- as long as they produced the goods desired by the Spaniards. Economic exploitation and commercialization, while disruptive in some contexts, were perfectly compatible with Indian traditions, and thus native culture had a better chance of adapting to colonialism rather than succumbing to the excessive demands of the colonists.(72) To this day, the Guatemalan and Chiapan highlands -- the textile manufacturing regions containing the most lucrative magistracies in the kingdom -- are among the most Indian parts of Latin America.\n\nIntegration into the world economy therefore did not necessarily result in societal destruction. What counted was the nature of that integration. The modern world-system may often have forced non-European peoples into slavery or \"coerced cash crop\" production -- to borrow a well-known phrase from Wallerstein(73) -- but at other times the international economy demanded not the elimination but the perpetuation or even expansion of native industry. This provided the economic base for a people's survival. In the kingdom of Guatemala the Maya survived by continuing to manufacture cotton textiles. Although they were subjected to coercive economic relationships resulting from colonialism, they became neither slaves nor serfs in the world-system. Moreover their production made Central America into an export platform which, like India and China, sent its textiles not to the core European economy but rather to other regional economies of Spanish America. Manufacturing, far from disappearing in the Europe-dominated world economy, remained an essential element of local, non-western structures of production. To be sure, it did not serve as a \"proto-industrialization\" stage preparatory to modern industrial capitalism. Nevertheless it was an important, and even expanding, economic sector of the non-European world long after contact with or conquest by Europeans.(74)\n\nDespite the commercial viability and profitability of the repartimiento, the Spanish government never reconciled itself to the participation of its officials in large-scale commercial activities. The system, after all, was coercive: the Indians were forced to participate. Considerable abuses naturally resulted, and in fact on several occasions revolts occurred because of the excesses perpetrated by the magistrates. Moreover the collaboration of the native elite, who enforced the magistrates' will in the villages, eventually led many Indians to question the legitimacy of their own rulers. The repartimiento eventually undermined the authority of the native ruling class, and at times led to rebellions not only against the Spaniards but also against the Indian village leaders.(75)\n\nThe crown also objected to the economic results of the repartimiento system. The royal magistrates made their enterprises profitable by using their political power to prevent competing merchants from conducting business in the provinces under their jurisdiction. The system thus in effect led to the establishment of local monopolies and concomitant economic abuses. Inevitably the magistrates represented themselves and their merchant partners better than they represented the interests of the king. As a Visitor-General to another part of America succinctly explained the problem, \"It is not easy, or even possible, to improve the local government of the provinces ... as long as its chief officials or corregidores are businessmen\".(76)\n\nThese views were to be the basis of, and justification for, the Bourbon reform programme and bureaucratic expansion of the last decades of the eighteenth century. In effect Spain was undergoing the same change in values that had already taken place in England: those who dispensed justice were now expected to be unbiased and honest.(77) Officials in Spain had finally come to understand the business activities of magistrates in America in modern terms: that is, as a manifestation of governmental corruption.

Some of these people had been migrating into Central America since the ninth or tenth centuries, and their descendants -- most importantly the Pipil of El Salvador -- were referred to as Mexicans in contemporary documents. They were not, however, Aztecs.

(66) For a different interpretation of the repartimiento in Chiapa, see Robert Wasserstrom, Class and Society in Central Chiapas (Berkeley, 1983), pp. 35-7, which ignores exports completely and assumes that the market for textiles was entirely local.

Salvucci, Textiles and Capitalism in Mexico: An Economic History of the Obrajes, 1539-1840 (Princeton, 1987), p. 26. (69) Among the many works dealing with the \"country trade\", see in particular P. J. Marshall, East Indian Fortunes: The British in Bengal in the Eighteenth Century (Oxford, 1976) for a study of the activities of the British East India Company officials, who were in some ways comparable to Spanish magistrates in America in that they served a master and themselves at the same time. (70) In one documented case a merchant in Santiago received goods from the alcalde mayor of Huehuetenango, shipped them for sale to San Salvador, received indigo in return, exported indigo to Peru and Spain, and invested in Cadiz in a slave-trading company doing business in Africa: A.G.I., Guatemala 603, no. 1, Testimonio de la Instancia de Don Juan Bacaro Alcalde Mayor de Gueguetenango, 1773. (71) For treatment of the same theme, see Enrique Tandeter, \"Forced and Free Labour in Late Colonial Potosi\", Past and Present, no. 93 (Nov. 1981), pp. 98-136. (72) A similar situation existed in Yucatan, where the Yucatec Maya survived during the colonial period despite subjection to the repartimiento system and incorporation into the world economy. See Robert W. Patch, Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1648-1812 (Stanford, 1993). For a contrary interpretation, see Nancy Farriss, maya Society under Colonial Rule: The Collective Enterprise of Survival (Princeton, 1984), which argues that Maya cultural survival was made possible by Yucatan's isolation from the world economy.
