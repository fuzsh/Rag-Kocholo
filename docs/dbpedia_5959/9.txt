Black Hills, SD: The 10th Annual Black Hill Film Festival features 27 films including narratives and documentaries from South Dakota and around the world. Filmmakers from all over the world will be on hand after their film’s debut to answer audience questions.

The Festival opens at the Performing Arts Center of Rapid City at 5:30 pm Wed. May 1 with the BEYOND OZ Hair, Makeup and Costume contest. The public is welcome to view the creations in progress and socialize in the reception area of the Emerald City. At 7 pm the films begin with short films, Awards and the South Dakota-made feature film The Rider. Lead character, Brady Jandreau, will be in attendance to answer questions following the film.

Thursday night films are presented at the Elks Theatre with special guest Céline Cousteau, while Friday afternoon selections are screened at the Journey Museum. An extensive slate of films screen Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday in Hill City at the High School theatre and in Hot Springs at the Historic Hot Springs Theatre.

A DIVERSE array of stories are presented during this landmark Festival, from the tribes living in the Amazon, to Vertical Farms, to children born with both sexes, to a rancher on the South Dakota plains. The films feature characters faced with fatal diseases, with traumatic brain injuries, hearing loss and other challenges and yet still strive to create a fulfilling and productive life for themselves.

We celebrate the diverse landscape of our country with films like National Parks Adventure, Devils Tower, and The Trouble with Wolves. We celebrate the diverse cultures that inhabit that landscape with films such as We are Still Here, Tribes on the Edge, Our Tiospaye, Blood Memory, and East Side Sushi.

And finally we are proud of our South Dakota filmmakers who continue to produce great films with little money and minimal resources. Each year, the Festival sponsors the attendance of Industry Professionals to provide training and mentoring. Doug Lee from Sioux Falls will be in Hill City on Saturday morning May 4 to conduct a FREE session on “Filmmaking Essentials.” Anyone with an interest in improving their filming is welcome, even if only for your own home videos.

The public is invited to meet our attending filmmakers and tell them how much you appreciate their efforts to entertain, enlighten, and inspire all of us.
