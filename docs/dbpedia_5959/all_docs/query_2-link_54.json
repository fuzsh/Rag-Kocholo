        "text": "Kayaking Sheridan Lake\n\nWe kayaked Sheridan Lake July 4th weekend and it was so much fun. There was such an abundance of wildlife everywhere you looked. What I really like about Sheridan Lake is all the coves it has where you can sneak away from the larger boats, waves, and people and have the lake to yourself for a while. The turtles, herons, ducks, geese, and fish also like these small hideaways.\n\nSheridan Lake is located just west of Rapid City, South Dakota. The lake is about 375 acres and offers two swimming beaches, a marina, two campgrounds, and plenty of fishing, picnic areas, and hiking opportunities.\n\nWe kayaked most of the lake. It takes 2 to 4 hours, depending on your shape and how many stops you take along the way.\n\nForks, Corks, And Kegs Festival In Deadwood, South Dakota\n\nThe Forks, Corks, and Kegs Festival is every year in April. We went for the 11th annual event in Deadwood this year and had a really good time. The cost in 2024 was $75.00 a person and it is a 2 day event where you can go as much or little as you choose. There are bars/restaurants throughout town where you visit and they give you appetizers and alcohol - wine or beer. On Saturday they have a huge event at the Deadwood Mountain Grand Hotel and Casino where venders from all over let you sample their beverages. There is also some limited food at this event. I really enjoyed walking around and getting the samples at the different locations. Sometimes there were very long lines, but they went quickly. While walking around we also gambled here and there which was nice since it let our stomachs settle for a bit. The $75.00 I found was a little steep since we only went one day, and got free tickets as it was. If I was paying full price, I would definitely do both days and maybe stay the night at their discounted hotel rooms for the event.\n\nMardi Gras In Deadwood\n\nWe are going to Deadwood for the day for Mardi Gras. There will be free food samples at the businesses downtown, and a parade. Later we are going to 1964 The Tribute to the Beatles at the Deadwood Grand. Will be a fun but long day. We started our adventure around noon.\n\nFor Mardi Gras - Cajun cook-off they had 12 business this year in 2024 that participated. There was a lot of food and we definitely were stuffed by the time we got done. Here are the businesses that were in it. It is all free and they also have beer drink specials if you buy their cup. The event lasts through the weekend with different events on Friday and Saturday. The Cajun cook-off was Saturday 2 pm to 4 pm. - Thanks to these businesses.\n\nPaddy O’ Neill’s at Tin Lizzie, Snitches at Tin Lizzie, A&B Pizza at Oyster Bay, Job Corps at Celebrity Hotel, Historic Bullock Hotel, Deadwood Social Club at Saloon #10, Buffalo Bodega Casino, Lil’s at the Midnight Star, Maverick’s at the Gold Dust, Rocksino, Silverado/Franklin Historic Gaming Complex, and Dale’s Bar and Grill at the Deadwood Mountain Grand.\n\nWe went to a total of 11 out of 12 businesses for food. One business ran out and we did not wait since we were so full anyways. Definitely larger portions and more businesses were involved this year.\n\nSo many fun things to do in one day. There was definitely some type of activity for everyone to enjoy.\n\nMy winter weekend in Sundance, Wyoming\n\nSundance, Wyoming is a small town just west of the South Dakota border. It was established in 1875 as a trading post. The Sundance Kid took the town’s name as a nickname when he was arrested for a theft he committed in town in 1887. It was the only time he was ever incarcerated. We decided to come here on a warm weekend in January and check it out.\n\nWe stayed at the Bearlodge Mountain Resort right in town. It was very nice, pretty reasonable, and we saw the most amazing sunrise. What I really liked was we were able to check in early and then go explore the town.\n\nWe checked out the town. It was pretty quiet with few people roaming around. We went to the Sundance Square and saw The Sundance’s Kid statute. The museum was closed even though on Facebook is said it was open on the weekends.\n\nI love checking out old cemeteries in town so I went to 2 - Mt. Moriah Cemetery in town and Miller Creek Cemetery just northwest of town off Highway 14.\n\nDinner was at the Longhorn Saloon in Sundance. We had already been to this restaurant so we wanted to try something else. Our hearts was set on Uncle Louie’s but they closed at 2 pm. There were limited options in town with Subway and the Turf Bar and Lounge being the only other places that were open past 2 pm on a Saturday night. We found that to be interesting.\n\nWe checked out the new Sundance White Ranch Park which consists of new hiking trails. It looked pretty muddy so we passed, but we did see some people hiking the trails. We will be back one day to check it out.\n\nWe started heading for the perfect sunset at the Warren Peak Fire Tower off Warren Peak Road. We rushed to get there and when we got pretty close, the road just south of the tower was closed due to winter maintenance. Being in the 40’s and 50’s we just assumed it would be open, so that was a disappointment. We scrambled on where to go next, so we went down Highway 116 and saw some pretty amazing sights.\n\nSo funny thing about buying alcohol. I figured if we wanted a beer or some wine we would just buy it in town. We went to the grocery store and then the gas station. The only place that sells any was the Turf Bar and Lounge as a drive-up, so you may want to consider that if you like to have a glass of wine while enjoying the sunset.\n\nAfter we leave our cabin in the morning we check out the Sundance Campground and trails. There were so many of them, and we only had a small time to walk one which had some pretty good views about .75 to a mile in.\n\nOur last stop today was going to Devil’s Tower which is only about 30 minutes from Sundance, Wyoming. It is something you should not miss and I was so happy with all the improvements they have done since the last time we were here, but that is another story.\n\nOverall, we had a great time in Sundance. There are not a whole not of options when it comes to staying the night, or eating out in the wintertime, but that’s what we enjoy anyways. Some people may think the town is too small. I thought it was wonderful and can’t wait to come back and do some more exploring in the summertime.\n\nWalking the Creekside Trail in Custer State Park\n\nHiking in Custer State Park is beautiful anytime of year. In the winter though it is usually magical for many reasons. My favorite reason though is you usually have the park to yourself. Even on nice days like last Sunday, there are very few people roaming around. One of our favorite places to walk is the Creekside Trail in Custer State Park. It is an easy walk, you can make it as long as you like, and since the hike is mostly paved, it makes for better walking conditions especially in the winter months. The hike starts from either the Custer State Park Visitor’s Center or the Grace Coolidge Campground, and is 3 miles each way. The cool thing about this hike also, is there are so many things to see along the way.\n\nCuster State Park Visitor’s Center - From informative displays to a wonderful movie about the park, it’s a perfect place to start your day.\n\nOnce you leave the path next to the visitor’s center you cross the road and walk near the Game Lodge Campground. This is one of my favorite campgrounds in the park. You are by so many trails, have access to a lot of activities, and there is a store nearby.\n\nNext you pass the famous State Game Lodge where presidents have stayed. This was the summer White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1927. It was also visited by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. Today you can stay at the lodge. There are also cabins, dining, and a beautiful wedding venue. There is a beautiful creek that runs through the area and buffalo and mountain goats are seen quite frequently.\n\nNext you pass the wedding venue and this building. Right behind it is the start of the Lover’s Leap trail which is a gorgeous 4 mile trail that skirts the top of the hill with beautiful views of the valley. It is a harder trail to get to the top, but once up there the hike is quite pleasant.\n\nRight across from the church you can find the Peter Norbeck Outdoor Education Center and the beginning of the Cairn Trail. The Education Center is really fun especially for kids or if the weather is bad. They have a lot of activities for kids.\n\nThe Cairn Trail is a little over a quarter of a mile hike above the education center that gives you a couple of nice views.\n\nWhen we got to the church we were at about 1.5 miles and decided to turn around. If we kept going we would have hit the Coolidge General Store and then Grace Coolidge Campground down the road a little bit. Once past the store the trail follows the creek better and it is very peaceful. The Grace Coolidge Campground is a beautiful smaller campground in Custer State Park. It is near the Grace Coolidge hiking trail which is popular with fisherman, and is a good hike for the kids and pets since it crosses the stream a lot. There is also a tent only section at this campground.\n\nWalking the streets of Deadwood, South Dakota\n\nEvery time I go to Deadwood I am amazed at how much I miss. Around every corner is some sort of history and each time I go I notice something different. This last time we walked around the streets in the day, night time, and even at 5 am in the morning since I’m an early bird. There is something special about seeing the sun rise and being the only one on the streets.\n\nThe Doors of the Famous at the Franklin Hotel in Deadwood\n\nBuilt in the early 1900s the Franklin Hotel has entertained the company of famous people such as John Wayne, Babe Ruth, Will Rogers, Casey Tibbs, Buffalo Bill, and Teddy Roosevelt to name just a few. The hotel is located on Main Street in Deadwood across from the Silverado Casino and Outlaw Square. I enjoyed walking every floor looking at the famous doors and people who resided there at one time. The history at this hotel is just amazing. These are the 18 doors I found.\n\nThe Doors of the Famous at the Franklin Hotel in Deadwood\n\nSeth Bullock was a prominent citizen of Deadwood. He was a frontiersman, sheriff, U.S. Marshal, and operated the Bullock Hotel in Deadwood. After Wild Bill Hickok was murdered, he became the sheriff of Deadwood. He was appointed a marshal by President Theodore Roosevelt and then later President William Taft. He is buried at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Deadwood.\n\nPotato Creek Johnny found the largest piece of gold in the Black Hills of South Dakota and became a local celebrity. His gold nugget is on display at the Adams Museum in Deadwood. Potato Creek Johnny is buried at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Deadwood next to Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\n\nBilly Mills was born in 1938 in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. He won a gold medal in the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan in the 10,000 meter run (6.2 miles) with a winning time of 28.24.4 minutes. It was noted as one of the greatest upsets in Olympic history since Billy Mills was not known at the time.

After going to war and being wounded at Omaha Beach in Normandy in 1945, Korczak came back and started looking for a mountain. In 1948 the first blast occurred on a mountain just north of the town of Custer, South Dakota. When completed, the Crazy Horse Monument will be the largest sculpture in the world. The monument has a long way to go and will take many years to complete due to the fact the family will not take any government grants. After both Korczak and Ruth died, the family members have taken over to continue his legacy.\n\nMary Hart was born in 1950 in Madison, South Dakota.

It is just gorgeous and you can get up close with all the majestic spirals. This is one of our favorite trails to do in the winter. Be warned though the road is not plowed in the winter so walking it can be tricky if there has been a lot of snow. I recommend bringing poles.\n\nWe do this hike every year and usually we are pretty much alone on the trail. This year we saw about 50 people, 20 dogs, and 3 horses. If you walk to the Needle’s Eye and back it is around 2.5 miles round trip. We hiked to the Cathedral Spires Trailhead and back for a total trip around 4.5 miles.\n\nFor more pictures or information go to our Custer State Park page on our website.\n\nHiking the Bison Trail/Red Dog Trail in Custer State Park\n\nThe Bison Trail/Red Dog Trail is the newest trail in Custer State Park and it is behind the Bison Center off Wildlife Loop Road. The sign splits the trail up in two sections - The Red Dog Trail and the Bison Trail. The sign says the total length to do the two trails is 2 miles and takes about 2 to 4 hours. Both trails are in a loop and can be done together. We did the trail in about 35 minutes and it was only .75 of a mile total, so not sure where the extra mileage is. This trail is also part of the summer and winter challenges for Custer State Park. This trail was pretty nice and has lots of different wildflowers in the summer and gorgeous open blue skies all year long. We did the trail again on January 1, 2024 as part of the winter challenge and we were the only ones there. It was a very pleasant hike.\n\nThis trail is one of my favorites at Custer State Park because it is short, not too hard, and has great views of the prairie. It is also next to the Bison Center where they have bathroom facilities, a store, food, and an information center.\n\nCaching Through The Snow\n\nCaching Through The Snow is a really fun activity to do in the winter time, especially if you have kids. You start at the Visitor’s Center at Custer State Park and they show you what to do. You need to either use your phone or check out a GPS unit they have available for you. Then using a GPS and the coordinates, you walk outside around the visitor’s center looking for the caches. At each cache you get a part of the items you need to build an ornament. Once everything has been found, you return to the Visitor Center to put your ornament together. This took us less than an hour, and I was glad there was no snow when we did it. There was also very little people around, and we were the only ones doing the activity. We did have some mountain sheep and a buffalo that was in the area, so at times we had to walk around them, so use caution.\n\nCuster State Park - Festival Of Trees\n\nThe Custer State Park Festival of Trees is open daily 9:00am – 4:00pm at the Main Visitor’s Center. You can come and check out all the beautiful trees and then vote on your favorite. Voting ends January 1, 2024 and the winner will be announced then on Facebook. The Festival of Trees is where local businesses, civic organizations, and individuals display a tree. You will still need a park license to enter the park, and the center will be closed on Christmas Day. This is an annual event which we plan on checking out every year. This year there were 14 trees to vote on.\n\nFinding Sasquatch on the South Dakota Trails\n\nThis is a very fun activity to do with the family. You search for Sasquatch on trails throughout the state of South Dakota. There is an interactive map on the website and when you zoom in on it, it shows you where the Sasquatch sightings are. If you zoom even more on it, it gives you an orange line of where the sign is. Usually you have to walk 1 mile or less to find the sign from the beginning of the orange marked line. There are 6 Sasquatch sightings in the Western part of the state. When you spot a sighting you take a selfie and then go to their website, download your photo, and mark off which sign you found. There are small prizes given out depending on how many you find.\n\nFor more information go to their website - https://gfp.sd.gov/hike2023/\n\nSighting along Angostura Lake on the bike path.\n\nSighting at the Outdoor Campus in Rapid City.\n\nSighting on the Prairie Trail in Custer State Park.\n\nSighting on Spearfish Falls Trail at the Spearfish Canyon Nature Area.\n\nSighting at Bear Butte State Park on the Centennial Trail.\n\nSighting on the George S.

It is 5 miles one way and coming from Willow Creek it goes about 4 miles uphill and 1 mile downhill. It can be done as a long day hike or combined with the Black Elk Trail - Trail #9 South and North for a long 15 mile loop hike or backpack trip. We did this trail in the summer of 2023 as a backpacking trip and stayed on the other side of Black Elk. It is not an easy hike, very rocky in places, and the temperatures can go either way very quickly - It started out very hot - 96 degrees, and within hours it was very cold - in the 50s. Be prepared for all sorts of weather.\n\nTo get to Willow Creek - it is off Highway 244 just west of Mount Rushmore and across from the Palmer Gulch KOA.\n\nMy final thoughts on this trip -\n\nCheck the weather, but do not count on it. The weather said warm and no rain. The Rapid City, Custer, or even Custer State Park weather app is not really reliable when it comes to hiking or backpacking Black Elk. At the top it is always colder, windier, and more unpredictable. I felt heat exhaustion going up to Black Elk and border line hyperthermia at the top. This hike is no joke, and you can get into trouble very fast if you are not prepared.\n\nWhen we got to Trail #9 South from Lost Cabin Trail #2, the sights were amazing, but so was the view of the very dangerous storm coming. I was amazed at how many people on this trail were in flip flops, wearing tank tops and shorts and little else. We mentioned to a couple of people walking up the trail how bad the storm looked and they were like, ‘Huh, yeah we didn’t even notice”. Although Trail #9 South is a little easier, you are still deep in the woods and have to be aware of the dangers and your surroundings.\n\nWe met some really nice people on the trail. We lost our hiking hat and mentioned it to some people who were hiking up. They happen to be local, work on the same street I live on, and agreed if they found it to take it to their job. The next day I went to their job and there was our hat. What a small world we live in.\n\nThis is not an easy hike. Lost Cabin Trail #2 goes up for about 4 miles, then you come down for about a mile and then back up again. Once you hit Black Elk #9 South you pretty much go up again till you hit Black Elk. We continued on to Black Elk #9 North and although you go down the rest of the way, it has a lot of switchbacks, is very rocky, and has some big steps. I think Black Elk #9 is one of the hardest trails to the peak. Coming from the other way, which I have, was exhausting.\n\nThis was a great trip. We had originally gone to check out the stars at night. It was suppose to be one of those nights when all the meteors can be seen. Instead it rained from 3 pm to 6 am. We didn’t see anything, but the top of our tent. In spite of that, I just want to say wow. To live in an area as beautiful as this and within 30 minutes hiking up to a peak that people come from all over the world to see - just amazing.\n\nSummer Challenge for Custer State Park 2023\n\nSummer Challenge Custer State Park - 8 trails to complete before September 9, 2023. When you complete a rubbing at each site of the medallion listed, bring the collection back to the Custer State Park Visitor’s Center for a prize.\n\nLegion Lake Trail - Legion Lake Trail is an easy scenic trail that is about 1 mile long and circles Legion Lake. The trail starts at the lake and is an easy hike for the family.\n\n2. Lovers Leap Trail - The trail is a loop that begins behind the State Game Lodge School House which is across from the Peter Norbeck Outdoor Education Center on Highway 16A. It begins with a pretty steep but not too long of a climb. This trail is 4 miles long and does a nice loop.\n\n3. The Bison Trail - The Bison Trail is the newest trail in Custer State Park and it is behind the Bison Center. The trail is about 3/4 of a mile long and goes in a loop. Part of the trail is done, but you can tell they are still working on a majority of it. . This trail was pretty nice and had lots of different wildflowers and gorgeous open blue skies.\n\n4. Centennial Trail - South of Iron Creek Trailhead - goes about 1 mile in on the Centennial Trail which is part of a 124 mile trail that crosses different terrain and counties in the state.\n\n5. Grace Coolidge Walk-In Fishing Area - Grace Coolidge Trail is a 5.8 mile out and back easy trail in Custer State Park. The hike follows Grace Coolidge Creek and ends up at Center Lake/Campground. The trail is really pretty and there are several lakes near the trail and lots of small bridges to cross over the creek.\n\n6. Cathedral Spires Trail - Cathedral Spires Trail is a short 3/4 mile one way trail in Custer State Park on the Needles Highway. You can do the trail out and back or meet up with the trail that leads to Black Elk. There is some scrambling to do on this hike and it can get wet and muddy when it rains. The trail goes through the needles and is pretty neat. The parking for this trail is small and around a curve and it can be hard to find a place to park if busy.\n\n7. Prairie Trail - Prairie Trail is a trail on the west side of Wildlife Loop Road in Custer State Park. It claims to be about 3 miles and goes in a loop. We actually tracked it around 2.1 miles. The trail goes through the prairie and the forest and although there wasn’t anything spectacular on this trail, some of the views were pretty and by the creek was nice. While we were there, the buffalo were far off, but there were buffalo chips everywhere. I would use extreme caution if buffalo are near the trail since you are exposed a couple of times in the prairie with no adequate means of cover if needed.\n\n8. The Lost Trails - The Lost Trails is a moderate trail that is around 2 miles and circles Center Lake in Custer State Park. The trail also has a separate section where there is a short loop trail that gives you an option to go to a lookout point as well. This adds about another mile to the trail. Both trails start at the Center Lake swimming area on the south side of the parking lot. The trail actually starts by following a gravel road at the west end of the parking lot for a 1/2 mile or so, but we decided to follow the lake shore line instead until we met up with the trail near the spillway on the southeast end. The actual medallion is near the lookout point.\n\nAfter turning in our sketches, we received an antelope pin which was really nice. We are collecting different ones each summer and winter.\n\nWinter Challenge for Custer State Park 2023\n\nWe did the Custer State Park Winter Challenge again this year and had a blast. Each year it is different and the prize is different as well. We had some challenges with the weather and snow this year making it even more fun. This is a free event every year where you get outside, enjoy the beautiful scenery, and have the park mostly to yourself. You can usually do all the hikes in a weekend, so planning the challenge around the winter can be easier.\n\nBadger Clark Trail\n\nThe Badger Clark Historic Trail is a little loop trail in Custer State Park that is about 1 mile in length. The trailhead is 1 mile south of Highway 16 on Badger Clark Road near Legion Lake. Part of the trail was created by Badger Clark himself, a famous writer and poet. Badger Clark lived in the area for over 30 years in a small cabin on site named “The Badger Hole”. During summer, tours are available through the Badger Hole, where volunteer rangers are there to answer questions. The trail itself is pretty easy and a good place to get out, stretch, and smell the fresh air. If open, the cabin is really cool and full of tons of history. The Centennial Trail also runs along the cabin.\n\nPrairie Trail\n\nPrairie Trail is a trail on the west side of Wildlife Loop Road in Custer State Park. It claims to be about 3 miles and goes in a loop. We actually tracked it around 2.1 miles. The trail goes through the prairie and the forest and although there wasn’t anything spectacular on this trail, some of the views were pretty and by the creek was nice. While we were there, the buffalo were far off, but there were buffalo chips everywhere. I would use extreme caution if buffalo are near the trail since you are exposed a couple of times in the prairie with no adequate means of cover if needed.\n\nNeedles Highway\n\nThis national scenic byway was considered impossible to construct by some before it was finished in 1922. It is named after the high granite \"needles\" it winds among. On the highway, you'll drive by the needles eye, around tight turns, through low tunnels and near the Cathedral Spires. One of the most famous parts of the drive is the Needle Eye Tunnel. This one-way tunnel is only 8′ 4″ wide by 12′ 0″ high so make sure your vehicle will fit through before starting up the highway because once you reach the tunnel, there isn't much room to turn around.\n\nThe Needles Highway starts near Sylvan Lake and ends up near Legion Lake, State Game Lodge, or Center Lake and is full of adventure and beautiful scenery whichever way you choose to go.\n\nDuring the winter the road is closed and people walk the road or cross country ski it. It is just gorgeous and you can get up close with all the majestic spirals. This is one of our favorite trails to do in the winter. Be warned though the road is not plowed in the winter so walking it can be tricky if there has been a lot of snow. I recommend bringing poles.\n\nLover’s Leap Trail\n\nThe trail is a loop that begins behind the State Game Lodge School House which is across from the Peter Norbeck Outdoor Education Center on Highway 16A. It begins with a pretty steep but not too long of a climb. About 1/4 mile from the start of the trail, you will come to an intersection - this is where the loop begins. We suggest taking the trail that goes to the left. This way you get most of the uphill out of the way early and you can enjoy the hike the rest of the way. This trail is 4 miles long and does a nice loop.\n\nSnow Shoeing It\n\nWe snowshoed the Prairie Trail and that was pretty interesting. Some of the trail had snow, but there was a lot of slush, rocks, and dirt. There were a lot of hills you had to climb and sometimes going down the hills in the snow shoes was hard with all the snow. Picking a trail to do with the snowshoes can be fun since it sometimes can be hard to foresee how the whole trail is going to be.\n\nMount Coolidge\n\nMount Coolidge is located on SD 87 between Blue Bell Campground and Legion Lake Campground. The tower is atop a 6,023 foot peak and has some amazing 360 degree views of the Black Hills. From the top with binoculars or a good zoom lens, you can see Crazy Horse, Mount Rushmore, the Needles, Black Elk Fire Tower, Ellsworth Airforce Base, and the Badlands.\n\nThe tower was built in the 1940's by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is now used to spot fires. The road up to the tower is a little steep and winds a lot. Large vehicles and motorhomes should not attempt the drive to the tower since it is narrow, curvy, and has a lot of sharp dropoffs with no guard rails. There is also limited car parking at the top and an outhouse. The tower is only open on good days and is usually closed in the winter due to the road that leads to the tower being slightly dangerous.\n\nBoondocking in the Badlands\n\nBoondocking in the Badlands\n\nA couple of weekends ago my husband and I got to boondock in the Badlands National Park. This has been called a top five rated boondock location and it was amazing. It was easy to get to, there were tons of beautiful spots to set up, and the views were out of this world. We never knew this was here, and it is easy to miss if you are not looking for it. The sites are all overlooking the Badlands and it is free. There are no amenities however, and whatever you need you must bring in and bring out. The views from “The Wall” are extraordinary, so be sure to bring your binoculars.\n\nThe site is located about 6 miles south of Wall, South Dakota on Highway 240, and about 1 mile from the Pinnacle entrance to the Badlands National Park. When traveling south on Highway 240 from Wall and I-90, you will see three radio towers up on a hill to the left. You will turn on the dirt road leading to the east and when you get to the “Badlands Wall”, you can decide which way to turn and set up camp. Both directions have tons of spots and amazing views.\n\nWe saw lots of flowers and cacti, but no animals. We heard from others that this is a good place to see mountain goats, or bighorn sheep wandering through your camp.\n\nWe saw all types of camping options, but be aware it can be very windy up there, so placing a tent near the cliff’s edge might not be the best decision.\n\nWe did not see a good sunrise because it was raining, but the sunset, “Golden hour” was gorgeous.\n\nSo many different spots to camp along the cliff or in the grassy field.\n\nI was advised this boondocks area is Buffalo Gap National Grassland (USDA Forest Service, Wall Ranger District if anyone has any questions for this land managing agency.\n\nWinter Challenge for Custer State Park\n\nCuster State Park just started a Winter Challenge a couple of years ago where they give you a couple of hikes to do in the winter and once you complete the list you show them your selfies or photos that you completed the hikes and you will get a Custer State Park pin. This is a really fun way to get out in winter, complete a task, and then come home with a prize. This is the first time my husband and I did this challenge in the winter and it was really fun. We also got to spend a lot of time by ourselves in the park which is a lot different from the busy time in the summer.\n\nMost of these hikes were anywhere form 1 mile to 4 miles depending on which way you went, and how long you decided to hike after you got the selfie you needed. Some of the trails were so pretty we kept hiking. Here are the 6 trails/challenges we did this year. Although it is too late to do this challenge now yourself this year, keep it in mind to do next year. It is definitely a fun way to spend your winter days.\n\nBadger Clark Trail\n\nThe Badger Clark Historic Trail is a little loop trail in Custer State Park that is about 1 mile in length. The trailhead is 1 mile south of Highway 16 on Badger Clark Road near Legion Lake. Part of the trail was created by Badger Clark himself, a famous writer and poet.

The trail itself is pretty easy and a good place to get out, stretch, and smell the fresh air. If open, the cabin is really cool and full of tons of history. The Centennial Trail also runs along the cabin\n\nStockade Lake Trail\n\nStockade Lake is the largest lake in Custer State Park and is located on Highway 16A just east of the town of Custer. The lake has three campgrounds, and is the only lake in the park that allows all boats. The lake has a swimming beach, a playground, and is near some of the Black Hills Points of Interest such as the Gordon Stockade - the site of the first gold discovery in the Black Hills.\n\nNeedles Highway\n\nThis national scenic byway was considered impossible to construct by some before it was finished in 1922. It is named after the high granite \"needles\" it winds among. On the highway, you'll drive by the needles eye, around tight turns, through low tunnels and near the Cathedral Spires.

This one-way tunnel is only 8′ 4″ wide by 12′ 0″ high so make sure your vehicle will fit through before starting up the highway because once you reach the tunnel, there isn't much room to turn around.\n\nThe Needles Highway starts near Sylvan Lake and ends up near Legion Lake, State Game Lodge, or Center Lake and full of adventure and beautiful scenery which ever way you choose to go.\n\nWhen we did this hike, we kept walking after the selfie station because it was so beautiful and peaceful. There are also no cars allowed in the wintertime as the road is closed. There was also not enough snow for any snowmobiles, so we had the road to ourselves.\n\nBarnes Canyon Trail\n\nBarnes Canyon Trail is a newer trail in Custer State Park and it goes between Wildlife Loop Rd and Badger Clark Road. The hike follows an old logging road, and is a about 4.7 miles one way. The cool thing on this trail was we saw 3 elk ( hard to ever see ) and some buffalo near the trail. For the most part there is nothing special about the trail, and we saw very few people on it. This year (2021) the trail is part of the summer challenge hikes, and the medallion is halfway up the trail. When my husband and I hiked the trail we did 1/2 the trail at night and turned around and did the 2nd half the next day. If you are just doing the trail for the medallion, I recommend coming from Badger Clark Road side- the trail is easier, prettier, and has more lookouts. The other part of the trail starts off Airport Road off Wildlife Loop Road.\n\nFor the winter challenge - 2021-2022 - same thing. Start at the Badger Clark Road side. There are actually 2 selfie stations before you hit the 2 mile mark for some reason.\n\nSnowshoe It\n\nWe were really lucky for this one. We decided to snowshoe to Mount Coolidge Fire Tower and there was actually snow. Most of the hikes we did in the winter had little to no snow, so make sure you plan accordingly if this is one of the challenges next year.\n\nMount Coolidge\n\nMount Coolidge is located on SD 87 between Blue Bell Campground and Legion Lake Campground. The tower is atop a 6,023 foot peak and has some amazing 360 degree views of the Black Hills. From the top with binoculars or a good zoom lens, you can see Crazy Horse, Mount Rushmore, the Needles, Black Elk Fire Tower, Ellsworth Airforce Base, and the Badlands.\n\nThe tower was built in the 1940's by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is now used to spot fires.

There is also limited car parking at the top and an outhouse. The tower is only open on good days and is closed in the winter due to the road that leads to the tower being slightly dangerous.\n\nThis was such a fun challenge because we had the whole road to ourselves, the views were amazing, and we had time to enjoy them.\n\nOur Prize\n\nMardi Gras In Deadwood\n\nThis last weekend my husband and I went to the Mardi Gras in Deadwood. This is the 3rd time we have gone and it is always a blast. We make sure we get a hotel room way in advance, and since it is an event’s weekend the hotels tend to be more expensive. We stayed in a cheaper motel for 82.00 a night. They have different events on Friday and Saturday. We usually hit the events on Saturday because I like to see the parade.\n\nOn Saturday there were 6 different restaurants and bars that was giving out free food from 2 pm to 4 pm. You want to make sure you get there early, because on busy weekends sometimes the food runs out. The first stop was at the Six String Restaurant at the Deadwood Mountain Grand. This was very good and with the free drink we got from gambling, it was even better. This dish was Dave’s favorite.\n\nThe second place we stopped was at the Iron Horse Hotel - Three Cousins Pizza. They served a specialty pizza that was by far my favorite dish. I’m not sure what was all in it, but it was definitely different.\n\nThe third place we stopped was at the Gold Dust Casino - Mavericks Steaks and Cocktails. They had a bayou stew and cornbread. This was good, but we liked the other dishes we had better.\n\nThe fourth stop we went to was the Buffalo Bodega. The food was pretty good, and it was a quick stop.\n\nThe fifth stop was at the Deadwood Social Club - Old Saloon # 10. They had 3 different dishes to try. The funny thing was you could only try one dish at a time, and then had to get back in line. The line went fast though, the servers seemed to keep track of what you had and didn’t have, and all 3 dishes were delicious .\n\nThe sixth and last place we went was Tin Lizzie - Snitches. This dish was really good. The only problem was by this time we were pretty full.\n\nWe were able to get to all 6 places in less than 45 minutes. That gave us time before the parade to gamble, relax, and people watch. Some of the interesting people we met on the streets.\n\nAfterwards we saw the parade which was lasted only about 15 minutes - mostly due to the vehicles moving really slow. There were only a few floats, but it was still neat and they threw out beads and candy to the crowd.\n\nOverall, we had a blast and this is one of the Deadwood events I try to hit every year. The free food, parade, and people watching make it a fun evening.\n\nThe Summer Challenge in Custer State Park\n\nThe Summer Hiking Trail Challenge at Custer State Park has begun. The trails on this summer's challenge are below. My husband and I did the 8 trails in 2 days and it would make for a really fun weekend in Custer State Park. Go to the visitor’s center to pick up the information and maps. A couple of things we noted.\n\nYou have to bring your own writing utensil. The park does not supply any.\n\nWe saw 2 medallions on the Creekside Trail. We were not sure which one was correct, so we copied both of them.\n\nThe park only gives you one piece of paper to copy the medallions. It is set up for only 6 medallions. You will need to ask for another piece of paper since there are 8 ( 9 ) medallions.\n\nCheck the maps before you begin so you know which group of hikes to do together so you are not driving back and forth through the park.\n\nLegion Lake Trail -\n\nLegion Lake Trail is an easy scenic trail that is about 1 mile long and circles Legion Lake. The trail starts at the lake and is an easy hike for the family.\n\nCairn Trail -\n\nThe Cairn Trail is the newest trail in Custer State Park and it takes you above the Coolidge General Store and gives you a bird’s eye view of the surrounding area. The trail is a shorter trail but it does go up for quite a bit until you get to the top. The trail is a good one for the kids if you want them to get exercise. When doing the trail we continued to the top to get a better view and then came back down to continue the trail.\n\nCreekside Trail -\n\nThe Creekside Trail is a hard-surfaced trail that goes between the Grace Coolidge Campground and the Visitor’s Center. The trail is very simple, is about 2.5 miles one way, and passes the State Game Lodge, the Peter Norbeck Visitor’s Center, and the Coolidge General Store.\n\nBarnes Canyon Trail -\n\nBarnes Canyon Trail is a newer trail in Custer State Park and it goes between Wildlife Loop Rd and Badger Clark Road. The hike follows an old road trail, and is a little over 5 miles one way. The cool thing on this trail was we saw 3 elk ( hard to ever see ) and some buffalo near the trail. For the most part there is nothing special about the trail, and we saw very few people on it.\n\nCentennial Trail (South from Iron Creek Trailhead located on HWY 87N)-\n\nPart of the Centennial Trail that is 124 miles long.\n\nGrace Coolidge Walk-in Fish Area Trail -\n\nGrace Coolidge Trail is a 5.8 mile out and back pretty easy trail in Custer State Park. The trail is located right across the road from the Grace Coolidge Campground. The hike follows Grace Coolidge Creek and ends up at Center Lake/Campground. The trail is used for hiking, trail running, walking, and fishing. The trail is really cool and there are several lakes near the trail and lots of small bridges to cross over the creek. The trail is a favorite for kids since there are so many cool places to explore and get wet.\n\nCathedral Spires Trail -\n\nCathedral Spirals Trail is a short 3/4 mile one way trail in Custer State Park on the Needles Highway. You can do the trail out and back or meet up with the trail that leads to Black Elk. There is some scrambling to do on this hike and it can get wet and muddy when it rains. The trail goes through the needles and is pretty neat. The parking for this trail is small and around a curve and it can be hard to find a place to park if busy.\n\nPrairie Trail -\n\nPrairie Trail is a trail on the west side of Wildlife Loop Road in Custer State Park. It claims to be about 3 miles and goes in a loop. We actually tracked it around 2.1 miles. The trail goes through the prairie and the forest and although there wasn’t anything spectacular on this trail, some of the views were pretty and by the creek was nice. While we were there, the buffalo were far off, but there were buffalo chips everywhere. I would use extreme caution if buffalo are near the trail since you are exposed a couple of times in the prairie with no adequate means of cover if needed.\n\nWhen you get done with the 8 trails be sure to go back to the visitor’s center at Custer State Park to get your free pin. They will want to keep all your sketches of your medallions and get your name and authorize that it had been done. Seemed pretty official when we did it."
