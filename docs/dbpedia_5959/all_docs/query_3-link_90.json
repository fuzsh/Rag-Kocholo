To further support this endeavor, BDR has integrated electric charging stations locations into both the printable and digital maps of the Black Hills BDR-X.\n\n“Backcountry Discovery Routes have been the key that unlocks two-wheeled adventure for riders from coast to coast for years and the Black Hills BDR-X lives up to that reputation in every way. Having such an iconic route be the first for Zero Motorcycles to be included on is an honor and we’re proud to bring a new element of adventure riding to the rich tradition of BDR and the world-class riding of the Black Hills.\"\n\n- Dan Quick, Communication Director, Zero Motorcycles"
