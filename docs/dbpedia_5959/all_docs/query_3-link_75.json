        "text": "No list of iconic Black Hills movie locations would be complete without mention of Mount Rushmore and Sylvan Lake, located just two miles behind the infamous shrine to democracy.\n\nThere have been a number of movies filmed at the State’s well-known national landmark including: National Treasure, North by Northwest, Head of State, and Never Ending Story III.\n\nNational Treasure: Book of Secrets is a 2004 film starring Nicholas Cage, where scenes were filmed at both Mount Rushmore National Memorial and Sylvan Lake. The Mount Rushmore scene features a hidden chamber behind the head of former Pres. Abraham Lincoln. As it turns out the filmmakers didn’t just “make it up” when it came to the secret chamber, there is in fact a room carved into the monument. The room was meant to serve as the U.S. Hall of Records; a 70-foot tunnel was built during the construction of Mount Rushmore, which was left unfinished for decades. Congress shut down the idea after the landmark construction was complete. However, it was eventually completed in the early 1990s. As it turns out, unless you are Nicholas Cage; the room is not accessible to the general visiting public.\n\nChances are if you see epic granite formations, crystal clear lakes, sweeping prairie or out of this world dessert formations, you are watching a movie that originated in the Black Hills.\n\nThe film set of Dances with Wolves, located at Ft. Hays, is an important place to begin, not only because it’s one of the most famous movies to be shot in the Black Hills, but also to experience what life in the ‘old west, with cowboy supper shows and daily workshops (in-season) focused on activities such as rope and tool making.\n\nOriginally the film set was created on the owner of Ft. Hays, Clint Jones’s great-great grandfathers homestead. Jones explained after filming was complete the set was left on the land that his cousins managed.\n\n“About one-year after filming wrapped up, we tried to set up bus tours to visit the film set on the homestead. Unfortunately, that didn’t work out because it was in the middle of a ranch and was just too hard to locate,” said Jones.\n\nWith the film set taking up valuable land on the family homestead, they considered getting rid of it. “That’s when my Dad decided to purchase the set and moved it to a more accessible location off Highway 16,” said Jones.\n\nVisitors are now able to stand on some of the original building sets that were used during filming of the 1990 movie, including where John J. Dunbar received his posting orders.\n\nDances with Wolves received twelve Academy Award nominations and won several Oscars, including Best Cinematography.\n\nSouth Dakota film history is ingrained into the spirit of Ft. Hays and they take the business of promoting the history of the area to heart. “There have been so many films that have been set right here in the Black Hills,” said Jones, “the list is more than 40-movies long.” He went on to explain that there are well known films such as Dances with Wolves and North by Northwest as well as some surprising blockbusters that visitors may not have known about such as Armageddon, which filmed scenes in the Black Hills.\n\n“I feel it is important to showcase the film history of the Black Hills for us to show others that there is way more to this area of the country than they may have initially realized,” said Jones."
