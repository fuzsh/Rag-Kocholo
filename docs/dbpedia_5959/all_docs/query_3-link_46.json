        "text": "A trail of broken treaties, the quest for sovereignty, a collective journey in healing, and a call for self-determination all come together in Lakota Nation vs. the United States, a new film directed by Jesse Short Bull and Laura Tomaselli from IFC Films. The lyrical and provocative film provides a comprehensive, unflinching narrative of the struggles and triumphs of the Očéti Šakówiŋ/Lakota/Dakota/Nakota Nation and their ongoing fight to regain stewardship and protection of “He Sapa”—the Black Hills.\n\nAs the film opens, grounding and somber shots invite the viewer to connect to places within the communities of the Očéti Šakówiŋ. Through interviews with community organizers and leaders, as well as a cache of historical and contemporary footage, viewers will gain an empathetic understanding of the urgency of the complex issues facing the Očéti Šakówiŋ. From the fight for treaty rights, the discovery of gold, and the subsequent illegal confiscation of land to the battle against ecocide and the impact of boarding schools, the documentary offers an insightful look at the challenges these communities face and the steps made toward regaining stewardship of their sacred birthplace.\n\nThe impassioned personal stories of the elders, community organizers, and cultural bearers in the film encourage viewers to bear witness to the resilience and fortitude of these communities—though, of course, it alone can’t explore every facet of this complicated issue. “I think that one of the things Jesse and I talk about a lot—and it’s really at the crux of a lot of documentary editing—is how do you simplify something without losing the truth of it? Because every detail you lose, you are kind of whittling away like this central story,” says codirector Laura Tomaselli. Below, she and codirector Jesse Short Bull discuss radical optimism, the importance of listening to intuition, and lending dignity and honor to the act of protest. As Short Bull puts it, “You can always make things better. And that’s what a lot of our Indigenous people are trying to do. They want their kids to have a better life; they want the land to be in better shape…. Regardless of the difficult history or the deceit on behalf of the United States, at the end of the film, I hope people can feel good about themselves.”\n\nVanity Fair: In Indigenous communities, our introductions help us understand relationality to each other. Can we start with that?\n\nJesse Shortbull: My name is Jesse Shortbull. My Lakota name is Mni Wanca Wicapi (Ocean Star). I am a member of the Oglala Lakota Oyate or Oglala Sioux Tribe. The band that I descend from is a band of both Wazhazha Band and Chief Lip Tiospaye. That's on my father's side and my mother's side; she is of German Irish descent.\n\nLaura Tomaselli: My name is Laura Tomaselli. I grew up in southern New Hampshire, and moved to New York City for a long time.\n\nCould you share how this journey began, and what this project means to you?\n\nShortbull: In South Dakota, I live in a border town. Growing up, I always knew that adults were engaged in meetings. I never really understood what they were up to. As I started to enter my college years, I discovered that many of these older folks were up to treaty councils—completely grassroots, with no funding—making sure that our treaty rights are first and foremost.\n\nTwo things became very clear to me in the last two years. One was exploring the subject of the treaty through this film, and the other was my role working for the Oglala Sioux Tribe president's office.\n\nTo this very day, there have always been people from not just Pine Ridge but across the seven Council fires of the Lakota and Dakota nations who have always been at the treaty, first and foremost. I cannot explain to you how special that is, how unique that is. It needs to be something that even non-natives or people that aren't familiar with the treaty have access to, so that they can understand how unique it is for our Indigenous nations. To this day, all the things that we have are still because of that treaty.\n\nTomaselli: I spent a semester abroad in the Czech Republic, and I went to a film school there. The Czech Republic is one of the few places that non-violently overthrew communism because of the strong storytelling traditions embedded there. They mounted cameras on the fences to show what was happening. When Jesse and I started speaking, I felt really empowered by our connection regarding how much we thought storytelling mattered. Beyond that, I get sick of how activists are sometimes treated or misunderstood in the public sphere. I have a lot of respect for the people that are putting their lives out there.\n\nWhat was the most challenging part of this work?\n\nShortbull: We knew that there are so many people who devoted their entire lives to this, to the Black Hills in South Dakota—to making the United States keep the treaty front and center. There are so many people. And a lot of those people were never acknowledged. And this is their story. It's everybody's story. Obviously, in a two-hour timeframe, it's hard to cover everything. And a subject such as this, I mean, there are so many directions you can go. There are so many more details that are deeply embedded into every little nook and cranny. This is part of the reason why I love watching this film every time we screen it, because I look at how Laura edited things. I find new angles to think about.\n\nAt the end of the day, Laura and I really wanted to try and create a cross-section of everything that our tribal members are—whether or not they're an activist, whether or not they are on a treaty council, or whether or not they're just a tribal member. We try to cover everybody that we have in our nations. I would love to know who in the 1950s was doing this work, and who in the 1920s was doing this work. We may never know their names. We're just capturing a little bit of this moment that we're in, and the people that the treaties apply to.\n\nTomaselli: This [film] should be 300 hours long. Previous cuts were four hours long. It being finite drove both of us nuts. I would go back there tomorrow to Lakota Nation to interview people we didn't get to talk to.\n\nWhat’s your advice for young filmmakers who want to follow in your footsteps for similar work in other Indigenous communities?\n\nShortbull: A long time ago, I was a young person, and I had a hard time. There was a period of time when I didn't think I'd see tomorrow.\n\nWhat's crazy is that after that night, things shifted for me. I loved storytelling, whether it's something that I wrote or whether it's assisting with a project. Whatever mysterious forces are at work that pertains to creativity—and sometimes it can be a little crazy—certain things happen that are a little bit more than coincidence. That has probably been the biggest help to me: trusting my intuition and coming at a story or a project in a way that I can try to be authentic. Tunkasila, we say over here, or creator. Creative intuition, nurturing that. And opening yourself up to something bigger than yourself.\n\nTomaselli: I want to piggyback on what Jesse said, as a non-Indigenous person,. My background is as a commercial and trailer editor in New York City. At a certain point, I developed a skill set, but my creative creativity was hitting a wall. It's really exciting to take the skills you have or and just get out of the system, and go actually work in service of something that is bigger than you. One of the things Jesse and I talk about a lot is the idea of radical optimism. Before I was on this project, I was not necessarily hopeful about the future in many different ways. I want to say that working in service of something bigger than yourself is always right.\n\nWhat work is still left to advance the rights or ensure equity for us as Indigenous peoples in the land back movement?\n\nShortbull: I think that what I feel good about is that our tribal governments and treaty councils are in the teeth daily. They're in contact with Washington, they've made their assertions clear. Our treaty counselors have made their assertions clear to the IRA [Indian Reorganization Act] government. And the IRA government makes those assertions clear to Washington, DC. That's going on in real time as we speak. Laura and my chief role right now is to try to be present, try to educate people the best we can, and try to build support Laura and I have been out in communities— both Indigenous communities and cities across the country. We see a lot of common themes: people who want to help, people who want to see justice. We just try to build this wave, one person at a time, one legislator at a time, one tribal councilman at a time, one treaty delegation member at a time.\n\nTomaselli: There's a line that Nick Tilson says in the film: things have only gotten better, and societies have only gotten better, when people resist the powers that be. I hope that Indigenous people everywhere see themselves in the story, not just in Turtle Island. I think beyond that, it's [about] lending dignity and honor to the act of protest, of standing up for a better future. I hope that people will feel empowered to do that themselves, or feel empowered to understand what “land back” means. To not demonize it, and to not be afraid of it. I hope that, if nothing else, all of us are blessed to live in this time and in this place, and [that] this will make the land in better shape. That would be really good."
