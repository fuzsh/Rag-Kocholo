        "text": "\"Black Hill what are you doing in the ceiling? Sennnnnn-\" - Mallory\n\nAppearance[]\n\nBlack hill appears as a robotic satellite, similar to a pinball bumper, with a glowing yellow, black, white or pink moon above it. Black hill has goofy large hands and forearms, and no legs. Its eyes always look in opposite directions, like a gecko.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBlack Hill has been shown to have a personality, similar to a well-meaning child that's just doing its best. Black Hill also has a prankster side, as it will sometimes do things simply to get on Sen's nerves. It moves at the speed of a sloth, so it's not hard to reprimand it.\n\nEach of the four hills have slightly different personalities.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nBlack Hill's primary ability is that it can fire goop from its index finger. This goop, if it hits something that is on a slope of greater than 15 degrees (relative to the current plane of elevation, such as the main 'floor' or ground), can apply its effect.\n\nWhile the goop is active, Black Hill can remove one \"aspect\" of that target.\n\nThis \"aspect\" is a very broad term, and can extend to anything that is considered a facet of a thing's existence. It can remove a person's collision with walls, ability to breathe, to see, or even remove the logical consistency binding them together. These aspects are primarily mental or world-based functions.\n\nBlack Hill has very few limits on what it can remove. The only thing Black Hill can't remove is concrete \"aspects\", so for example, Black Hill cannot remove someone's leg.\n\nOnly the Yellow and Pink Hills can actually return damage to Sen. The other 2 are practically indestructible.\n\nPoint System[]\n\nEvery time someone hits Black Hill with a sturdy attack (such as a pinball ricocheting off of its underside), that person gains 50 points. This point gain is doubled for every Black Hill included in the immediate ricochet, so hitting two yields 100, three 200, and 4 400 points.\n\nSen may spend 50 pts. to create a small Goop-Colored slope wherever Black Hill shoots.\n\nShe may spend 200 pts. to activate Black Hill's effect on a target that is not on a Slope.\n\nAnd she may spend 1000 pts to activate Black Hill's \"Black Hole Cannon\".\n\nBlack Hole Cannon[]\n\nThe Black Hole Cannon, Black Hill's ultimate attack, creates a centralized force that sucks all those within 30 ft. into it. This \"Black Hole\" applies a singular Black Hill effect to everyone that is within range, until the Black Hole disappears. The Black Hole deals damage to everyone within its range as well, and can even pull apart structures or destroy nearby trees.\n\nTea Ability[]\n\nRose Tinted Tea allows Black Hill to take an aspect of someone, and give a copy of that aspect to someone else. This ability can only be used if Sen is under the effect of Sweet Hibiscus Tea.\n\nTrivia[]"
