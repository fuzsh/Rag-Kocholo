        "text": "\"As an Indigenous person, as someone who comes from this land, I'm just trying to exist.\" IFC Films has revealed an official trailer for an acclaimed documentary film titled Lakota Nation vs. United States, arriving in theaters this July. It first premiered last year at the Tribeca Film Festival. A chronicle about how the Lakota Indians fight to reclaim control of the Black Hills in South Dakota. The doc investigates how the sacred land was stolen in violation of treaty agreements and feature interviews with Indigenous citizens. Using a treasure trove of rich archival material, electrifying on-the-ground footage and intimate interviews with veteran activists and young leaders, the film offers a \"provocative, visually stunning testament to a land and a people who have survived removal, exploitation and genocide â€“ and whose best days are yet to come.\" Fight the power! Featuring Phyllis Young, Henry Red Cloud, Nick Tilsen. More films like this, please. The poster is also incredible, with a powerful minimal design (view below). Catch this film at your theater soon.\n\nFull trailer (+ poster) for Tomaselli & Short Bull's doc Lakota Nation vs. United States, on YouTube:"
