Here the story is about 2 twin brothers who are very different but are very close too and who have lived in Wales since their birth in 1900. The movie begins explaining how their parents met, fell in love and married and later it centers in the 2 brothers, how they grow, how the 2 World Wars affect their lives and their little problems on the Wales countryside. A marvelous and beautiful film, perfectly directed and acted. A must see. 9/10"
