        "text": "PROUD dad Lee Ryan has shared a first picture with his baby daughter, after becoming a father for the third time.\n\nThe 38-year-old enjoyed a family day out in Marbella, alongside girlfriend Verity Paris and his other daughter, Bluebell, who he shares with with ex-girlfriend Jessica Keevil.\n\nHe captioned the sweet family shot: “Lunch with my girls”\n\nThe Blue singer also has son Rayn, 12, with former fiancee Samantha Miller in 2008.\n\nHis spokesperson confirmed his latest baby news earlier this month, saying: “Lee and Verity welcomed the arrival of their beautiful daughter earlier this month as they begin their new family life together in Spain. Both mother and baby are healthy.\"\n\nThe happy news was initially broken by Lee's bandmate Duncan James when he was asked about the possibility of the All Rise group - which also includes Simon Webbe and Antony Costa - getting together again soon.\n\nSpeaking on Lorraine, Duncan said: \"I think with the pandemic everything’s kind of changed and shifted which is kind of annoying. Lee [Ryan] lives in Spain, he’s just become a daddy again.\n\n\"So he’s got a little wee bubba and Simon has just become a father again so there’s like a baby Blue boom going on.’\n\nLee opened up about becoming a dad with the Ariana Grande impersonator and told Hello!: \"I'm so excited. I love being a dad; there is nothing better than that. It's the most amazing thing in the world.\"\n\nVerity added: \"I'm very comfortable moving into the next stage of my life with someone who is so paternal and good with children.\n\n\"Lee is so hands on and to me it is very reassuring to be with someone that loves family life.\"\n\nLee also revealed he hoped his little girl will follow in his musical footsteps, saying: \"We sit in the hot tub on our roof terrace, singing at the top of our voices.\n\n\"I don't know what the neighbours make of it. I can't wait to teach this little baby how to sing and play the piano and saxophone. I sing to the bump too.\"\n\nHe was first seen with Verity, who appeared on The X Factor in 2009, in January 2020, having joined reality TV series Celebs Go Dating the previous year in a bid to find love.\n\nThe couple moved to the Costa Del Sol in Spain last year and revealed they now have \"a better quality of life\" as well as a \"new lease of life\".\n\nIt means their daughter will have a dual passport and they are keen for her to speak Spanish."
