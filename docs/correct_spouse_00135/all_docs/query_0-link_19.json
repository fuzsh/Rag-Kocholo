        "text": "Lee Ryan is having another child, announcing wife Verity Paris is pregnant. After tying the knot last year, the Blue singer announced the couple's exciting news in a heartwarming post on X, formally known as Twitter, on Monday.\n\nPenning the message on the boy band's official account, Lee wrote: \"Me and my wife, Verity, are very pleased to announce our new baby, that will be born this year. The news came out of the blue. I found out on my 40th birthday! What a present from god.\"\n\nRyan added that his fellow bandmates Simon Webbe, Duncan James, Antony Costa were \"thrilled\" for the couple and their baby news. Duncan appeared to hint at the expectant's gender with a skilfully worded comment on the upload.\n\nAfter sharing a snap of Lee and Verity embracing, while Lee clutched his wife's growing baby bump, James replied: \"They say 3rd a charm - and now ur charm is a baby boy! Massive congrats brother.\" While Anthony simply added: \"Congratulations.\"\n\nLee is already father to 16-year-old Bluebell with ex-partner Jessica Keevil. He shares son Rayn, born in 2008, with fiancé Samantha Miller. The chart-topping singer shares two other children with Verity, a singer who appeared on X Factor in 2009.\n\nThe loved-up couple, who tied the knot during a romantic secret ceremony in Gibraltar in May 2022, welcomed a baby girl in November last year. Lee admitted his wife, an official Ariana Grande lookalike, was the love of his life.\n\nAfter the wedding, he said: \"I met someone finally who loves and supports me in everything I do. Verity is a beautiful, strong and loving woman who I treasure. And I’m a lucky man to have such a wonderful mother for my child, and now wife, in her.\n\n\"I’ve never been more calm and grounded and I have Verity to thank for that. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life because of the\n\nwonderful family life I now have.\""
