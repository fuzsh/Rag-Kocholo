        "text": "Strictly Come Dancing: Lee Ryan announced as twelfth contestant\n\nIs Lee Ryan married?\n\nLee Ryan is not married and does not have a wife.\n\nHowever, he’s been engaged twice in the past.\n\nThe 35-year-old EastEnders actor and pop star was once engaged to Atomic Kitten star Liz McClarnon back in 2003 but the relationship broke down.\n\nHe later went on to propose to his girlfriend Samantha Miller but sadly the couple split up before the wedding.\n\nAlthough Lee is not married, he has two children from previous relationships.\n\nHis daughter with his ex-girlfriend Jessica Keevil is called Bluebell and was born in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, Lee and his former partner Samantha share son Rayn, who was born in 2008.\n\nHe has posted photos of his children on social media previously and appears to be on good terms with Miller, who he also features on his Instagram.\n\nSTRICTLY COME DANCING 2018 LINE-UP CONFIRMED\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nLee was previously linked to both Casey Batchelor and Jasmine Waltz during his stint in the Celebrity Big Brother house back in 2014.\n\nThere are 15 stars taking part in Strictly Come Dancing this year, however the celebrities are still yet to be partnered up with their professionals.\n\nLee was the 12th contestant to be announced in this year’s line-up.\n\n“I'm so excited to be joining this year’s Strictly line-up. It is a real honour for me and I can’t wait to get out on the dance floor,” he said.\n\nWHO IS LEE RYAN?\n\nHe admitted that he had been a fan of Strictly Come Dancing since his fellow bandmate Simon Webbe took part on the show in 2011.\n\n“Simon has been a great help, he just told me to watch and listen to everyone around me and give it my best and that’s all I can do,” he said.\n\nLee went on to reveal: “Once we knew it was happening, my manager told me I couldn’t tell anyone, there’s always this big secret about Strictly so I think for many it was a shock when it was announced.\n\n“Even the band didn’t know! The feedback has been good; I have had a lot of phone calls and text messages!”\n\nGiven his background in entertainment, there had been questions over Lee’s previous dance background.\n\nLee explained: “I did learn dance at Italia Conti when I was young but it was never my favourite class.\n\n“I used to sneak out and wait for the singing lessons!\n\n“I asked my son Rayn if I am good dancer, he said no…”\n\nStrictly Come Dancing launches on BBC One this Saturday at 7.35pm"
