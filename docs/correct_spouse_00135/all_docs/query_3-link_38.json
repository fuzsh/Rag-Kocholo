        "text": "Well hi there, my little snowflakes!\n\nYou’re just in time for some high jinx and shenanigans!\n\nI’m always on the lookout for those fun holiday quizzes, but let’s face it: we’ve done Elf Names, and Reindeer Names, and that pretty much covers the available options. Last year I made up a What Kind of Christmas Cookie are you quiz. . . which was entertaining. . . but now we’ve done that too.\n\nSo this year I’ve decided to combine holiday quiz tomfoolery with writing prompt/idea generation! Try out this one!\n\nI will not even try to deny that some of these combinations work better than others 😊 But I don’t mind if you cheat a little and use the first letter of your middle or last name or the month your pet iguana was born to get a better result 😊\n\nMy Holiday Picture Book Title is The Littlest Cookie (or, because there’s an alternative on that one, The Biggest Cookie, which is probably more appropriate!) But I think I could write either of those stories and have fun doing it! I might add in a type of cookie. . . The Littlest Sugar Cookie or The Biggest Peppermint Supreme Cookie. Or I might expand one way or the other: The Teeniest Tiniest Itty Bittiest Cookie or The Most Gigantic Christmas Cookie of All Time! But have a go and see what you get and share your title in the comments if you want to!\n\nWasn’t that fun?\n\nDon’t you feel like you just got a little surprise holiday gift?\n\nI bet those writerly brain cells are already humming!\n\nSo you’re welcome, and I won’t keep you from getting words on the page!\n\nGo forth! Write! Create!\n\nAnd enjoy your holidays!\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nHappy Hanukkah!\n\nWondrous Solstice!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nEtc. etc.!\n\nSee you in 2021!\n\nUh. . .\n\nWere you expecting something else?\n\nI already gave you your next picture book idea AND JOY!\n\nWhat more could you want?\n\nOh, silly me.\n\nThere I go again, just completely forgetting the only reason you came to see me today!\n\nI guess, now that you mention it, it IS time to find out who won\n\nTHE 10TH ANNUAL HOLIDAY CONTEST!!!\n\n~ for children’s writers ~\n\nAs always, I was thrilled to see so many wonderful stories! Really! It is amazing and inspiring, not to mention VERY entertaining! There is just so much talent out there amongst you all!\n\nBut as you well know by now, with large entry numbers, all of high quality, come hard choices. My assistant judges and I worked hard to winnow the total down to a manageable number of finalists that we felt were truly all-around deserving of that distinction, and those were the ones we presented to you on Monday (ahem, okay, technically it was Tuesday 😊) for your vote.\n\nThere were, however, a few entries that barely missed being finalists, and many other entries that were outstanding in certain areas even though they might not have qualified all-around for one reason or another, or that the judges couldn’t reach a consensus on.\n\nSo my assistant judges and I would like to award recognition, a lovely badge, and a small prize to the following authors for the following merits:\n\n1. For Honorable Mention In The Competition As A Whole: (entries we truly wrestled with not including in the finalists!)\n\nKaitlyn Sikes for ‘Twas A Cold Winter Solstice (beautifully written!)\n\nJessica Hinrichs for The Merry Melody Farm (also great for younger readers!)\n\nRandi Lynn Mrvos for Four Things (also wonderful kid voice!)\n\nJilanne Hoffman for Promises Are For. . . (a poignant exploration of promises dishonored and promises kept)\n\nDeborah Clayton for The Song of the Stable Mouse (a sweet, kid-friendly retelling of the Christmas story from the POV of a little mouse, nicely written!)\n\nElyse Trevers for Baia’s Bags of Blessings (a timely story of generosity and spreading the joy of Chanukah even in difficult times)\n\nLaurie Carmody for The Holiday Henchman (a glimpse of Christmas from the naughty side that kids will enjoy)\n\nLinda Schueler for Planting Smiles (a believable story of reluctance turning to understanding)\n\nPatricia Nozell for Star (a miniature horse with a big heart who finds her own way to shine)\n\nCathrene Valente Youngquist for The Toymaker and the Christmas Tomte (told like a folk or fairy tale)\n\nMary Vander Plas for Oy to the World: An Ode to 2020 (so fitting!)\n\nShannon Howarth Nelsen for Christmas Bread (so evocatively written we could almost smell the bread)\n\n2. For Make This A Picture Book! 😊\n\nAshlee Hashman for Gingerbread Construction Crew\n\n3. For Great Depiction of Sibling Relationships\n\nPamela Love for Angel’s A\n\nMelissa Trempe for Operation Christmas Distraction\n\nCynthia Stacey for The Christmas Tree\n\n4.

The store starts with the letter A 😊 )\n\nAnd now…\n\n…the moment you’ve all been waiting for…\n\nThe announcement of the WINNERS OF THE 2020 HOLIDAY CONTEST as voted on by you, our esteemed readers!!!\n\nrat-a-tat-rat-a-tat-rat-a-tat-rat-a-tat-rat-a-tat\n\nDDDRRRUUUMMM RRROOOLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!\n\nIn First Place…\n\nWinner of the whole shebang…\n\nwho gets first choice of all the prizes…\n\nDana Marie Miroballi\n\nfor\n\nChristmasaurus Hex!!!\n\nCongratulations, Dana, on a fun, kid-friendly, delightfully humorous story that was clearly very popular with a LOT of readers!!!\n\nIn Second Place\n\nRebecca Gardyn Levington\n\nfor\n\nA Spark of Friendship\n\nCongratulations, Rebecca, on bringing the Shamash to life in spot-on rhyme!

And by gum. . . I almost managed it!\n\nSo close!\n\nAbout three more hours and I would have pulled it off.\n\nYou’re probably also wondering what happened to my hair!\n\nTurns out that gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair is a real thing when you have to read and judge 223 AMAZING Holiday Contest Entries and cut 211 of them to get down to 12 finalists! Ouch!\n\nSo here I am, one day before the first real snowstorm in ages is predicted to occur, which is not a good time to be suddenly bald, looking like I could be Humpty Dumpty’s sister (in more ways than one 😊) but there you have it.\n\nI think I will set a new trend.\n\n(You know how fashion forward I am!)\n\nI will be wearing my Santa hat at all times for the foreseeable future 😊\n\nFeel free to join me!\n\nYou lose 7 to 10 % of your body heat through your head, you know, and it’s probably more when you have no hairsulation. Santa hats are our friends. 🤶\n\nHave a great day, everyone!\n\nRemember to wear your hats!\n\nSee you soon 😊\n\nWhat?\n\nOh!\n\nDarn!\n\nSee?\n\nI KNEW I’d forget something!\n\nYou came for a reason!\n\nIt’s time to announce the finalists for. . .\n\nTHE 10TH ANNUAL HOLIDAY CONTEST!!!\n\n~ for children’s writers ~\n\nSo, I just want to say three little things before I post the actual finalists (shocking, I know, because normally I’m so quiet you can hardly get a word out of me 😊😊)\n\nFirst, I want to thank EVERYONE who took the time and care to write an entry for this contest. You all did a fabulous job and provided great enjoyment for many!\n\nSecond, I’d also like to thank EVERYONE – writer, reader, or both – who took the time to go around and read as many entries as you could and leave supportive comments. This means so much to the writers who worked hard on their stories. It helps them see what they did well, as well as giving them the joy of knowing that their stories were read and enjoyed. I hope you all got as much delight and entertainment out of the reading as I did! Plus, we got to meet quite a few new people which was a wonderful added bonus! 😊\n\nThird, I want to reiterate how difficult it was too choose! There were so many amazing entries. Really. I could find at least something terrific about every single one. The sheer volume of entries meant that many good ones had to be cut. So if yours didn’t make the final cut please don’t feel bad. There was a huge amount of competition. Judging, no matter how hard we try to be objective, is always subjective at a certain point – we all have our own preferences for what makes a great story. And the fact that you didn’t make the final cut DOES NOT mean you didn’t write a great story. Everyone who plonked their butt in a chair and worked hard to write a story for this contest is a winner! You showed up. You did your best work. You practiced your craft. You wrote to specifications and a deadline. You bravely shared your writing with the world. And you have a brand new story that is now yours to revise, expand, and polish if you like and maybe submit at some point to a magazine or as a PB manuscript. A lot of people have successfully done that at this point – we have quite a few books in the world that were born in Halloweensie, Holiday, or Valentiny Contests, plus a chapter book series that came out of the Fractured Fairy Tale Contest one spring! So bravo to everyone who entered!\n\nYou will recall the judging criteria:\n\n1. Kid-appeal! – These stories are intended for a young audience (ages 12 and under), so we’re looking for stories that children will enjoy and relate to.\n\n2. Holiday Helpers! – the rules state a Holiday Helper story, so it must be crystal clear that the story is about someone helping someone else in some way during Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice, New Year’s, or whatever seasonal winter holiday you choose. The story must center on helping – the help must not be just an offhand mention/reference in a story about something else.\n\n3. Quality of story – entries must tell a story, including a main character of some kind and a true story arc even if it’s tiny 😊 Entries must not be merely descriptions or mood pieces.\n\n4. Quality of Writing: check your spelling, grammar, punctuation etc. If you’re going to rhyme, give us your best 😊 Overall writing quality and use of language are also important.\n\n5. Originality and creativity – because that is often what sets one story above another.\n\nAs I said above, you all did a stellar job – there were no bad stories. But we had to pick the 12 we thought were the all-around best on all 5 counts listed. (12 because we have 12 prizes)\n\nSo, without further ado, I present to you the 2020 Holiday Contest Finalists. A mix of poetry and prose, stories for younger readers and slightly older (but still kid) readers, funny, poignant, sweet, and cute. Please read through them carefully, take your time, think it over, and vote for your favorite. To help with objectivity, finalists are listed by title only, not by author.\n\nAnd I’d like to be very clear about the voting process. You are MOST welcome to share a link to this post on FB, twitter, or wherever you like to hang out, and encourage people to come read ALL the finalists and vote for the one they think is best. Please do that. The more people who read and enjoy these stories the better, and the more objective votes we get the better. HOWEVER (and I want to be very clear on this) please do not identify yourself or ask others to identify you as a finalist on social media, please do not ask people to vote for a specific number or title, and please do not ask people to vote for the story about the unicorn-riding gingerbread princess or whatever. Trolling for votes or trying to influence the outcome is counter to the spirit of this competition which is supposed to be based on merit. I thank you in advance for respecting this.\n\nSo here we go! Read! Enjoy! VOTE! 😊\n\n1. A SPARK OF FRIENDSHIP\n\n[Note: “Shamash” is pronounced “shah-MAHSH”]\n\nThe menorah’s “helper candle,” the Shamash, as she is known,\n\nhas never ever asked for help. She likes to work alone.\n\nFor all eight nights of Hannukah, Shamash ignites each candle.\n\n“A gust of wind? A sneeze? A fan? There’s nothing I can’t handle!”\n\nShamash can’t wait to start night one! She’s luminous and strong!\n\nShe dazzles on the second night and hums The Dreidel Song.\n\nNight three arrives. Shamash continues beaming, all aglow.\n\nBut on night four she flickers, fades. Her pacing starts to slow.\n\nHer blaze begins to dim night five. She fights with all her might.\n\nBut on night six, she’s feeling faint. “I…mustn’t…lose…my….light!”\n\nThe seventh night, Shamash is snuffed. She’s lost all spunk and spark.\n\n“I blew it! I’m extinguished!” she says, sobbing in the dark.\n\n“Need a light?” A voice calls out from up upon the shelf.\n\n“You mustn’t feel you need to do this job all by yourself!”\n\nA little lighter flicks a flame, announcing: “Hi, I’m Bic!”\n\n“And I’m Shamash!” She brightens, as he lights her wilted wick.\n\nShamash, at last, alight again, illuminates the rest.\n\nShe beams as all eight candles gleam. “I love night eight the best!\n\n“Oh, Bic! You are a miracle! You saved our holiday!”\n\n“I’m happy I could help,” he says, then tucks his torch away.\n\nShamash prefers to work alone. “But this year, I’ll admit,\n\nthat thanks to you, my new friend Bic, this Hannukah is LIT!”\n\n2. The Christmas Owl\n\nIn the darkness of the forest,\n\nthe young owl swooped,\n\nplunging his talons\n\nthrough powdery snow.\n\nIn the warmth of a fire\n\nDara gazed at Christmas lights\n\ndancing a rainbow\n\non the wintery world.\n\nA shadow of wings flickered by.\n\nAn owl?\n\n* * *\n\nDara’s footsteps were silent\n\nas she walked between the trees.\n\nShe stopped,\n\nstaring in awe.\n\nAn impression in the snow,\n\na perfect pair of wings.\n\nAn owl?\n\n* * *\n\nFreezing rain fell,\n\ncoating every surface in crystal.\n\nDara explored,\n\nmarveling at the frozen world.\n\nA shadow caught her eye.\n\nA stooped shape!\n\nAn owl!\n\nShe tiptoed closer.\n\nShe watched, still and silent.\n\nHer toes went numb.\n\nThe owl didn’t move.\n\nWas it hurt?\n\nDid it need help?\n\n“I’ll be right back!” Dara whispered.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Kaylee, the wildlife expert, arrived,\n\nthey watched the owl together.\n\n“When the snow forms a crust,” she murmured,\n\n“young owls can’t punch through to catch their prey.\n\nThey get too hungry to hunt,\n\ntoo hungry to move.”\n\nDara’s heart felt as icy\n\nas the world around her.\n\nWould the owl be OK?\n\nWas she too late?\n\nKaylee crept\n\ntowards the owl.\n\nShe enveloped him in a blanket,\n\ngently placed him in a box.\n\nDara’s sigh of relief\n\nmade a puff in the wintery air.\n\n* * *\n\nOn Christmas eve,\n\nthe ice melted.\n\nKaylee called.\n\nAt dusk,\n\nthey walked\n\ninto the dripping woods.\n\nKaylee held the owl high,\n\ngently relaxed her grip.\n\nThe owl flew!\n\n“Merry Christmas!”\n\nwhispered Dara to the empty forest.\n\n3. CHRISTMAS IMPOSSIBLE: AN UNQUIET NIGHT\n\n‘Twas the night before Christmas\n\nand all through the house\n\nnot a creature was stirri –\n\n“Wait – what’s that noise?” Santa whispered and paused placing presents.\n\nChitter, chatter. Squeak!\n\n“There it is again!” Santa froze and cupped his hand to his ear.\n\nChitter, chatter. Squeak!\n\n“Oh no,” the jolly man groaned.\n\n“That sounds like a-\n\nSQUIRREL!”\n\nSanta dialed the Christmas Tree Hotline.\n\nThe switchboard lit up like Rudolph’s red nose on a dark night.\n\n“We’ve got a code 57,” stated Santa.\n\n“Dispatching Elf Squirrel Division now, Sir.”\n\nGears, Ginger, Twinkle and Bob set their Santa Map coordinates\n\nand dashed out through the frosty flakes.\n\nThey reached the house and whooshed down the chimney.\n\n“So – ho happy you’re here,” said Santa.\n\n“Glad to help,” said Gears.\n\nThey got to work while Santa snacked by the fire.\n\nThe elves climbed the tree\n\nbut\n\nthe squirrel scurried higher.\n\nThe elves swooped down from the star\n\nbut\n\nthe squirrel hid deeper.\n\nEven Bob’s “never fail” tinsel lasso trick\n\nfailed!\n\n“We’re doomed!” cried Twinkle.\n\n“Is it snack time?” said Bob.\n\n“Sweet sugar plums that’s it!” cheered Ginger.\n\nShe set a trail of cookie crumbs down the tree.\n\nThe squirrel sniffed.\n\nIt crept closer.\n\nThen…\n\nMUNCH!\n\nCrumb by crumb it climbed down and into the open carrier.\n\n“Thanks team,” said Santa and up the chimney he rose.\n\nThe elves flew to the forest where\n\nthe squirrel found the perfect pine.\n\nMeanwhile at another house-\n\n“Finally,” sighed Santa. “Peace and –“\n\nChitter, chatter. Squeak!\n\n4. FIRLING’S FRIEND\n\nFirling breathed in the cold, crisp breeze. Though he stood only as tall as the park bench beside him, he could still sense the yuletide in the air.\n\nFirling’s thin branches stood still. He could hear the warm laughter in the snow covered park.\n\nHis scarce pine needles vibrated with joy as the sweet notes of Christmas carols echoed off the frozen pond.\n\n‘Tis the season! Firling thought.\n\nSoon I’ll be dressed in my Christmas best!\n\nFirling watched as rows of nearby trees were adorned with colorful ornaments.\n\nYards of beautiful garland twisted and twirled around his tree neighbors.\n\nBright stars twinkled and angels perched atop trees as far as Firling could see.\n\nWho will decorate me? Firling worried.\n\nSuddenly a small girl approached.\n\n“Aw! Poor, little tree! You’re the only bare one in the park.”\n\nFirling felt his bare branches sag.\n\n“Oh Christmas Tree, I can help! You stay right here! I’ll be back!”\n\nTime passed and Firling began to worry that the girl wouldn’t come back.\n\nAs the sun was just starting to set, the girl returned.\n\nCarefully, she hung hand cut paper hearts from Firling’s branches.\n\nShe wrapped long strands of braided yarn from trunk to tree top.\n\nFinally, she placed a brightly painted cardboard star on Firling’s highest branch.\n\nThe girl beamed at her work.\n\n“Oh, little tree! How lovely are your branches!”\n\nThe little girl flashed Firling one last smile, before heading down the sidewalk.\n\nHere I am, Firling thought. Dressed in my Christmas best!\n\n5. Waddle Santa Do This Christmas?\n\nThe elves are tired out and in elf-isolation,\n\nThey’ve worked all year long with no chance of vacation.\n\nPoor Santa is worried, but what can he do?\n\nHe opens a letter that’s come from the Zoo!\n\nDear Santa, We’re bored as the zoo is in lockdown.\n\nApart from the keepers the place is a ghost town!\n\nThe Penguins at London Zoo love Christmas cheer!\n\nSo, please can we help with your presents this year?\n\nWith very best wishes and warm fishy kisses,\n\nYour best friends the Gentoo penguins\n\nOn reading the note Santa conjured a scheme,\n\nTo rest up his elves and bring on the new team.\n\nMy dear Gentoo Penguins, I think that sounds swell!\n\nThe elves will adore this, and I will as well!\n\nI’ll send down my reindeer, who have herd immunity,\n\nThey’ll pick you up — what a great opportunity!\n\nAnd everyone had such a wonderful day,\n\nThe penguins wrapped presents, and packed up the sleigh.\n\nThe elves made hot chocolate and played in the snow,\n\nThen baked penguin shapes out of gingerbread dough.\n\nThe penguins all hope to go back there one day,\n\nAnd the elves will come visit the zoo, so they say.\n\nIn the end for this Christmas it turned out alright,\n\nMerry Christmas to all and make sure you sleep tight!\n\n6. The Solstice Tree\n\nOwl watches as\n\nsunlight dims to a simmer, and\n\nstarlight scatters across snowdust.\n\nTonight is the longest night.\n\nSolstice is here.\n\nHe swoops down\n\nand calls from his perch in the frosted pine,\n\nWhooo can help me shine the light,\n\nShare gifts of hope on this long night?\n\nI can help to shine the light!\n\nSquirrel places nuts on branches,\n\ngifts of hope for a plentiful harvest.\n\nI can help to shine the light!\n\nDuck tucks feathers amongst the boughs,\n\ngifts of hope for cozy warmth.\n\nI can help to shine the light!\n\nFox props icicles alongside pinecones,\n\ngifts of hope for flowing energy.\n\nI can help to shine the light!\n\nRabbit sprinkles bits of bark,\n\ngifts of hope for strength and safety.\n\nI can help to shine the light!\n\nChickadee wraps grasses round and round,\n\ngifts of hope for rest and ease.\n\nBounding, waddling, soaring, hopping\n\nThey frolic and feast\n\naround the tree.\n\nUntil…\n\nFootsteps thump.\n\nTwigs snap.\n\nEveryone freezes.\n\nA girl squeals, “Animals! And a beautiful tree!”\n\nRabbit trembles. “Should we run?”\n\nOwl shakes his head and winks an eye.\n\nHer wonder is a gift of light,\n\nand hope for all\n\non this dark night.\n\n7. The Twelve Sleighs of Christmas\n\nSanta’s arm hurt, and his sleigh was kaput—\n\nOne runner bent sideways—all covered in soot.\n\nA rooftop collision had totaled his rig.\n\nOne tiny mistake that turned out to be big.\n\nHe had only been trying to test some new gear—\n\nTo practice his landing for Christmas this year.\n\nThis awful dilemma stirred up the north pole.\n\nPoor jolly old Santa —an unlucky roll!\n\nBut the elves didn’t fret, and they shouted with glee,\n\n“Oh, don’t worry Santa, we’ve got a plan B!”\n\n“Your sled may be broken, and so is your arm,\n\nBut wood from your sleigh wreck has true Christmas charm.”\n\n“We’ve already hammered and chiseled for days.\n\nOur elf crew has fashioned these twelve brand new sleighs.”\n\nSleighs one through three glowed with holly green paint—\n\nDressed up with berries, all simple and quaint.\n\nSleighs four through six sported stripey red flames—\n\nA curvy design stamped with all the elf names.\n\nSleighs seven through nine all sparkled like snow—\n\nCup holders for cocoa and revving to go.\n\nSleighs ten through twelve were bedecked to look bright—\n\nFestive with light bulbs—they sparkled with light.\n\nThe elves gathered gifts—from small to quite large.\n\nThey hooked up the reindeer—now they were in charge!\n\nThese holiday helpers would rescue the day—\n\nSubbing for Santa with twelve jolly sleighs.\n\nZipping up in the sky, they sang out from their flight,\n\n“Merry Christmas to all and to all an elf night!”\n\n8. CHRISTMASAURUS HEX\n\nWanda looked out the window. It was Halloween, but there wasn’t a skeleton in sight, just Santas and strings of colorful lights. “Christmas season starts earlier every year,” Wanda grumbled. “But this time they’ve gone too far.”\n\nFor the next 55 days, Wanda planned and plotted and prepared a spell to ruin Christmas.\n\nOn Christmas morning, Wanda took a candy cane and waved her wand. “Halloween was skipped, and so I’m vexed. Give me a monster that runs, roars, and wrecks.”\n\nPOOF!\n\nWanda clapped as a Christmasurus appeared. “Come with me and help,” she cackled.\n\nBut when the Christmasaurus ran through town, everyone smiled.\n\n“You’re fast,” a child said. “Please pull our sled.” The Christmasaurus was happy to help.\n\nWanda grumbled and waved her wand. Needs to be louder.\n\nPOOF!\n\nBut when the Christmasaurus roared, everyone cheered. “Your voice is the perfect pitch,” a caroler said. “Please sing with us.” The Christmasaurus was happy to help.\n\nWanda grumbled and waved her wand again. Needs to be bigger.\n\nPOOF!\n\nBut when the Christmasaurus went to wreck the tree, everyone looked relieved. “You’re just the right height,” the mayor said. “Please put the star on top.” The Christmasaurus was happy to help.\n\nWanda flew home fuming.\n\nThe Christmasaurus followed with a note from the mayor.\n\n“Dear Wanda,” it read. “Thank you for the holiday helper. I hope to see you both at the Christmas party. P.S. Sorry we missed Halloween.” Wanda grinned. “Why not?” she said. “I do like parties.”\n\n9. The Christmas Corgi\n\nDash, the Christmas corgi,\n\nTries so hard to do his part.\n\nHe might be small in stature,\n\nBut he has a helpful heart!\n\nBut Dash can’t wrap the presents.\n\nHe’s too short to trim the trees.\n\nAnd if he tries to shovel snow –\n\nHis stubby legs will freeze!\n\nThe cookies are too tempting,\n\nAnd he can’t quite reach the lights.\n\nAnd have you ever heard a corgi…\n\nSinging “Silent Night?”\n\nHe can’t harness the reindeer,\n\nOr help put together toys.\n\nAnd Dash can’t read the letters\n\nSent by all the girls and boys.\n\nHe’s too small to pull Santa’s sled;\n\nHis nose will never glow.\n\nSo Dash can’t shine the way\n\nThrough storms of swirling, blowing snow.\n\nBut if you’ve had a long, hard night,\n\nOf flying through the cold…\n\nIf climbing down chimneys and stairs\n\nhas left you feeling old…\n\nIf you need something soft and warm\n\nto help you get some rest…\n\nFor snuggles, fluff, and love,\n\nA Christmas corgi is the best!\n\n10. NOT TOO LITTLE\n\nI tried to help bake\n\nWhile Mom answered the door\n\nBut SPLAT! Cookie dough spilled\n\nAll over the floor!\n\nI tried putting lights\n\nOn the tree for my Dad\n\nBut I couldn’t reach high enough\n\nIt was so sad!\n\n“You’re still just too little\n\nTo help us right now\n\nBut maybe next year\n\nYou can help us somehow!”\n\n“Too little, too little\n\nThat’s all that I hear\n\nI don’t want to wait\n\nUntil Christmas next year!”\n\nToo little, too little,\n\nToo little I’m not!\n\nI know I can help\n\nI just need the right spot!\n\nThen Christmas Eve came\n\nWe had all gone to bed.\n\nWe were all in our dreams\n\nCookies danced through my head\n\nMy daddy snoozed, snoring\n\nMom mumbled in sleep\n\nAnd my little brother\n\nWas counting his sheep\n\nWhen out of my slumber\n\nI woke with a yelp\n\nA clamorous crash!\n\nSomeone needed my help!\n\nI bounded from bed\n\nAnd raced into the den\n\nAs the clock struck twelve\n\nI caught sight of HIM!\n\nHe was setting the Christmas tree\n\nBack up and then…\n\nI saw it was Santa!\n\nWhite beard on his chin!\n\n“I’m just bit late\n\nDo a favor for me?\n\nFill up the stockings?\n\nPut gifts ‘round the tree?”\n\n“Yes sir!” I shouted!\n\n“Just leave it to me!”\n\n“Thanks for the help,”\n\nSanta shouted with glee!\n\nUp the chimney he went\n\nAnd jumped into his sleigh\n\n“Great helper!” I heard\n\nAs he went on his way!\n\n11. Let it Grow! Let it Grow! Let it Grow!\n\nOh the weather outside was dreary\n\nAnd the plants were looking weary.\n\nPoor Santa was filled with woe.\n\n“They won’t grow! They won’t grow! They won’t grow!”\n\n“A Venus fly-trap for Tommy,\n\nAnd a String of Pearls for Mommy?!\n\nTheir progress is much too slow!\n\nThey won’t grow! They won’t grow! They won’t grow!”\n\nRudolph finally came one night.\n\n“How plants hate being out in a storm!\n\nNorthern climate just isn’t right–\n\nThe leaves and the roots should be warm!”\n\nThey ran around helter-skelter\n\nAnd devised to build a shelter.\n\n“Protected from ice and snow,\n\nThey will grow, they will grow, they will grow!”\n\nWell they didn’t show signs of perking.\n\n“Oh no, it isn’t working!”\n\n“Dear Santa, don’t feel so low.\n\nThey will grow! They will grow! They will grow!”\n\n“It’s not enough to be cozy.”\n\nSo Rudolph lit his nosey.\n\nThe greenhouse was set aglow.\n\n“There they go! There they go! There they go!”\n\nSanta finally cheered “Hooray!\n\nRudy’s light has again saved the day!\n\nLittle Tom and his mom will cheer,\n\nAnd I can grow plants through the year!”\n\nWhen the weather outside is nippy\n\nSanta’s garden still looks zippy.\n\n“With a greenhouse and Rudolph’s glow,\n\nLet it snow! Let it blow! They will grow!”\n\n12. The Sleigh-Awake Band\n\nSanta packs up his sled for the long night ahead,\n\nof lifting and gifting and being well-fed.\n\nThe cookies and milk make the big guy feel tired,\n\n(but staying awake for his job is required!).\n\nZZZZZZZZZZ….\n\nThe sleigh teeters left and then sails to the right,\n\nand loops through the air like a runaway kite.\n\nThe reindeer are dizzy, the presents are sliding –\n\n“It’s time” shout the elves (who had all been in hiding).\n\nJingle’s on cymbals and Jangle’s on cello.\n\nThe sound shakes the sleigh just like jiggly jell-o.\n\nNow Santa is stirring. Noelle grabs a drum,\n\nand RAT-A-TAT-TATS til’ her thumbs become numb.\n\nThen Eve heaves her tuba and gives it a blast.\n\nBOOM, BOOM “Wake up Santa, and please make it fast!”\n\nWHOOOSH! Just in time. He grabs hold of the reins.\n\nThe sleigh soars up high, past the birds and the planes.\n\nThe Sleigh-Awake Band jams across the night sky.\n\n“You rock!” Santa shouts with a gleam in his eye.\n\nYou helped me make presents, baked cookies and cake,\n\nbut you helped me the most when you kept me awake!\n\nNow, each Christmas Eve, Santa makes sure to pack\n\nthe Sleigh-Awake Band to help keep him on track!\n\nBOOM BOOM, RATTLE RATTLE, A RAT-A-TAT TAT!\n\nThey’re off to spread joy with the tip of his hat….\n\nNow YOU get to enjoy the agony of decision as you try to choose which of those amazing entries to vote for!

Good luck!!! 😊\n\n⭐️Deck the Halls! ⭐️ Light the menorah! ⭐️ Fill the Kikombe cha Umoja! ⭐️\n\nIt’s time for . . .\n\nTHE 10TH ANNUAL HOLIDAY CONTEST!!!\n\n~ for children’s writers ~\n\nThe Contest: Write a children’s holiday story (children here defined as age 12 and under) about a Holiday Helper!\n\nYour helper can be one helper, or a pair, or a group or a bevy or a herd of helpers. Your helpers can be children, animals, elves, aliens, unicorns, fairies . . . whatever your heart desires. He/she/they can help bake, decorate, shovel snow, wrap gifts, clean the house, entertain guests, feed the hungry, comfort the lonely, bring the holiday spirit to those who have lost it – sky’s the limit 😊 But the focus of the story must be on helping – not just a brief mention in passing that Marla helped Dad set the table in the middle of a story about her frustration at not getting the starring role in the school holiday pageant.\n\nYour story may be poetry or prose, silly or serious or sweet, religious or not, based on Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice, New Year’s or whatever you celebrate during the Holiday Season, but is not to exceed 250 words (I know! So much freedom after the Halloweensie Contest 😊 ) (It can be as short as you like (the judges will be grateful 😊 , you are welcome and encouraged to write shorter, but no more than 250! Title not included in word count.) The field is wide open! Have fun! The more creative the better! No illustration notes please. (And yes, if you feel compelled to submit more than one entry you may, just remember you’re competing against yourself!)\n\nPost: Your entry should be posted between right now this very second and Wednesday December 9th at 11:59 PM EST, in ONE of the following three ways:\n\nPost your entry on your own blog and enter your post-specific link (not your main blog URL) to the link list below, OR\n\nPaste your entry in the comment section below (please include your byline since if your posting handle is something like MamaWritesByNightlight I will have no idea who you are 😊), OR\n\nIf you have trouble pasting your entry in the comment section for any reason (which unfortunately does happen!) you can email it to me at susanna[at]susannahill[dot]com and I will post it for you. If you email it, please copy and paste your entry into the body of the email NO ATTACHMENTS – they will not be opened. Please include your title and byline at the top of your entry. (And since there have been many questions about this byline means who it’s by, for example, The Hanukkah Helper by Janie Simcox.)\n\nPlease submit your entry only ONCE! If you add it to the blog link list, and the comments, and email me to post it, things get very confusing! I try to stay as glued to my desk as possible, but sometimes I have to get up so if I don’t respond to your email or approve your post immediately, don’t panic! I’ll get to it as soon as I can!\n\nThere will be no regular posts (Tuesday Debut, Would You Read It, or Perfect Picture Book) for the duration of the contest so this post with the links and comments will stay up for everyone to visit and enjoy until I post the finalists.\n\nThe Judging: My lovely assistants and I will narrow down the entrants to approximately 10 finalists (depending on the number of entries – if we get a lower turnout we’ll post fewer finalists, a higher turnout possibly one or two more.) In the interest of finishing up the contest in a timely fashion so everyone can go about their holidays, we will do our best to post the finalists here by Monday December 14th for you to vote on for a winner. The vote will be closed on Wednesday December 16th at 5 PM EST. Whoever gets the most votes will be first and so on down to tenth place (or wherever we place to), and the winners will be announced on Thursday December 17th. (These dates are subject to adjustment if it takes the judges longer than we anticipate to get the judging completed.)\n\nJudging criteria will be as follows:\n\n1. Kid-appeal! – These stories are intended for a young audience (ages 12 and under), so we’re looking for stories that children will enjoy and relate to.\n\n2. Holiday Helpers! – the rules state a Holiday Helper story, so it must be crystal clear that the story is about someone helping someone else in some way during Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice, New Year’s, or whatever seasonal winter holiday you choose. The story must center on helping – the help must not be just an offhand mention/reference in a story about something else.\n\n3. Quality of story – entries must tell a story, including a main character of some kind and a true story arc even if it’s tiny 😊 Entries must not be merely descriptions or mood pieces.\n\n4. Quality of Writing: check your spelling, grammar, punctuation etc. If you’re going to rhyme, give us your best 😊 Overall writing quality and use of language are also important.\n\n5. Originality and creativity – because that is often what sets one story above another.\n\n6. PLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! Large numbers of entries make it easy to cut entries that haven’t been entered as we asked.\n\nThe Prizes!: The prize list is completely and totally awesome! Read! Covet!

She grinned and scooped a fingerful of dough from the bowl into her mouth.\n\nThe whole day passed, and Cara never got to play in the snow.\n\nShe carefully placed cookies and milk on the hearth for Santa, along with apples for the reindeer.\n\nWhen Santa arrived, he saw everything Cara had helped with – the presents, the tree, the cookies – and her snow boots waiting hopefully by the back door.\n\nHe smiled and whispered, “You help everyone else. It’s time you got a little special help yourself.”\n\nWhen Cara awoke, her gift was beside her. A wet nose, a wagging tail, and a note in Braille on her collar that read: Hi Cara! I’m Joy, your Guiding Eyes. I can’t wait to take you out to play in the snow!\n\n*** There you have it 😊 ***\n\nWith so many great prizes up for grabs I hope there will be a lot of entries – the more the merrier!

I know!\n\nI’ve left you with only fourteen days to go!\n\nSo put on your thinking cap! Warm up your pen!\n\nFor Holiday Contest – numéro TEN!\n\nOkay.\n\nClement C. Moore I may not be. . . 😊\n\nI mean, if I’m going to be honest about it, I’m not really sure what a sugarplum even is. . . !\n\nLet’s just put dancing fruits right out of our heads for a moment because I have big news!\n\nHuge Excitement!\n\nSOMETHING TO TWIRL YOUR TINSEL FOR!\n\nThe guidelines for . . .\n\nTHE 10TH ANNUAL HOLIDAY CONTEST!!!\n\n~ for children’s writers ~\n\nThe Contest: Write a children’s holiday story (children here defined as age 12 and under) about a Holiday Helper!\n\nYour helper can be one helper, or a pair, or a group or a bevy or a herd of helpers. Your helpers can be children, animals, elves, aliens, unicorns, fairies . . . whatever your heart desires. He/she/they can help bake, decorate, shovel snow, wrap gifts, clean the house, entertain guests, feed the hungry, comfort the lonely, bring the holiday spirit to those who have lost it – sky’s the limit 😊 But the focus of the story must be on helping – not just a brief mention in passing that Marla helped Dad set the table in the middle of a story about her frustration at not getting the starring role in the school holiday pageant.\n\nYour story may be poetry or prose, silly or serious or sweet, religious or not, based on Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice, New Year’s or whatever you celebrate during the Holiday Season, but is not to exceed 250 words (I know! So much freedom after the Halloweensie Contest 😊 ) (It can be as short as you like (the judges will be grateful 😊 , you are welcome and encouraged to write shorter, but no more than 250! Title not included in word count.) The field is wide open! Have fun! The more creative the better! No illustration notes please. (And yes, if you feel compelled to submit more than one entry you may, just remember you’re competing against yourself!)\n\nPost: Your entry should be posted on your blog between 12:01 AM EST Monday December 7th and Wednesday December 9th at 11:59 PM EST, and your post-specific link should be added to the link list on the official holiday contest post which will go up on my blog on Monday December 7th and remain up for your reading pleasure until I post the finalists. There will be no regular posts (Tuesday Debut, Would You Read It, or Perfect Picture Book) for the duration of the contest so the links will stay up for everyone to visit and enjoy. If you would like to enter but don’t have a blog you are welcome to paste your entry in the comment section of my December 7th post when it goes up. If you have trouble commenting, you can email me. (We’ll go over this part in more detail on the December 7th post! 😊 )\n\nThe Judging: My lovely assistants and I will narrow down the entrants to approximately 10 finalists (depending on the number of entries and final number of prizes – if we get a lower turnout we’ll post fewer finalists, a higher turnout possibly one or two more.) In the interest of finishing up the contest in a timely fashion so everyone can go about their holidays, we will do our best to post the finalists here by Monday December 14th for you to vote on for a winner. The vote will be closed on Wednesday December 16th at 5 PM EST. Whoever gets the most votes will be first and so on down to tenth place (or wherever we place to), and the winners will be announced on Thursday December 17th. (These dates are subject to adjustment if it takes the judges longer than we anticipate to get the judging completed.)\n\nJudging criteria will be as follows:\n\n1. Kid-appeal! – These stories are intended for a young audience (ages 12 and under), so we’re looking for stories that children will enjoy and relate to.\n\n2. Holiday Helpers! – the rules state a Holiday Helper story, so it must be crystal clear that the story is about someone helping someone else in some way during Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice, New Year’s, or whatever seasonal winter holiday you choose. The story must center on helping – the help must not be just an offhand mention/reference in a story about something else.\n\n3. Quality of story – entries must tell a story, including a main character of some kind and a true story arc even if it’s tiny 😊 Entries must not be merely descriptions or mood pieces.\n\n4. Quality of Writing: check your spelling, grammar, punctuation etc. If you’re going to rhyme, give us your best 😊 Overall writing quality and use of language are also important.\n\n5. Originality and creativity – because that is often what sets one story above another.\n\n6. PLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! Large numbers of entries make it easy to cut entries that haven’t been entered as we asked.\n\nThe Prizes!: The prize list is under construction. . . But I wanted to get the guidelines up so you guys would have as much time as possible to work on your stories! Stay tuned for an updated list at some point 😊\n\nA Picture Book Manuscript Read and Critique by Agent Kaitlyn Sanchez of Olswanger Literary!
