        "text": "Lee Ryan has revealed he is going to be a dad for the fifth time as wife Verity Paris is pregnant.\n\nThe Blue singer, 40, already shares a two-year-old and a one-year old daughter with Paris. He is also a father to daughter Bluebell, 16, with ex Jessica Keevil, and shares son Rayn with former partner Samantha Miller, who was born in 2008.\n\nThe All Rise hit-maker took to social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday to share the happy news with fans via boyband Blue’s official account.\n\nAlongside a loved-up snap of himself and his wife sharing a kiss while he cradled her growing bump, he wrote: “Me and my wife, Verity, are very pleased to announce our new baby, that will be born this year.”\n\nHe jokingly added: “The news came out of the blue. I found out on my 40th birthday! What a present from God.”\n\nThe post concluded: “The rest of the boys are thrilled for the couple!”\n\nBandmate Duncan James appeared to imply that they are expecting a boy in his response, writing from his own account: “They say 3rd a charm - and now ur charm is a baby boy! Massive congrats brother,” followed by three blue heart emojis.\n\nAnothony Costa, who is also a member of Blue, also shared his well-wishes, simply replying: “Congratulations”."
