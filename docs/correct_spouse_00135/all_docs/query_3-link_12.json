        "text": "HE’S one of pop’s great characters – and finally Lee Ryan has someone he can chat to on an intellectual level.\n\nEven better, I can reveal that the Blue singer is to have a baby with girlfriend Verity Paris, who performs as a tribute act to her lookalike, Aariana Granda.\n\nMy pictures show the pair looking loved up on the beach in Malaga, Spain this week, with Verity flashing a large baby bump and Lee doing his hilarious impression of a pregnant woman.\n\nIt’s great news for the Noughties star, and it means riveting conversation for him for the next few months.\n\nA Blue source said: “They couldn’t be happier. Pals have joked it will mean Lee will have some time to chat to someone who understands him.\n\n“It’s early days but they’re excited.”\n\nHe was first seen with Verity, who appeared on The X Factor in 2009, in January 2020, having joined reality TV series Celebs Go Dating the previous year in a bid to find love.\n\nThe former EastEnders star has had his ups and downs in the romance department, including being in a love triangle on Celebrity Big Brother 2014 with Jasmine Waltz and Casey Batchelor.\n\nThe singer was engaged to hairdresser Samantha Miller in 2008 after meeting her on MySpace. They had a son, Rayn, who was born the same year.\n\nHe was engaged to Atomic Kitten singer Liz McClarnon in 2003 but later split after she said being in a celebrity couple was too hard.\n\nLee has another child, daughter Bluebell, with ex Jessica Keevil.\n\nIn 2019 he was pictured on a romantic date with Love Island star Laura Anderson.\n\nMore recently he had a tryst with then-22-year-old beauty queen and Kazakhstani model Diora Romanova in 2018 but their romance soon fizzled out.\n\nAnd the year before he was going out with former Miss Universe Great Britain Jaime Lee-Faulker.\n\nHe added: “I shouldn’t have lost the family life I had with my ex-fiance, Sammi, and our little boy, Rayn.\n\n“He’s ten now and we’re really close again. But I neglected the relationship so it’s only relatively recently that he’s been able to see functioning co-parenting, something my mum and dad never achieved.”\n\nThe former Strictly Come Dancing star previously said of his relationship history: “I don’t have any regrets about the mistakes I’ve made because they’ve shown me that something good can come out of something bad.”\n\nHe might be easy to take the Mick out of but Blue are one of Britain’s go-to pop brands of the Noughties – and I want to wish Lee and Verity all the best.\n\nBEL'S DENIM HAD-TRICK\n\nDOUBLE denim is every fashionista’s worst nightmare. But supermodel Bella Hadid tore up the rule book to give triple denim a run-out.\n\nShe was pictured in New York on Thursday in straight-leg jeans, light denim corset and oversized shirt.\n\nI love a trier but I don’t think this will catch on. It’s not as embarrassing for her as the time she fell on the catwalk in 2016, though. She recently posted a throwback snap showing a photographer trying to help her up.\n\nBella said: “Can someone find me this man . . . I want to thank him personally for being the only one to offer a hand.”\n\nGOOD JOLLY MISS MOLLY\n\nMOLLIE KING had a spring in her step as she headed to work at Radio 1 yesterday.\n\nThe Saturdays star looked chic in a blue dress which she paired with a brown belt.\n\nWhen she’s not busy on the airwaves with her co-host Matt Edmonson, Mollie has been busy planning her wedding to England cricketer Stuart Broad.\n\nEver since Stuart popped the question at New Year, Mollie has been sharing ideas for their big day with her 930,000 Instagram followers.\n\nWhen asked earlier this month about their wedding, Mollie said: “I’m so excited!\n\n“I am right at the beginning of all the planning and can’t stop looking at wedding accounts on Instagram.”\n\nI hope Stuart has started saving. I can sense a very lavish affair coming up . . .\n\nJOEL: MY BANGER FOR BED-HOPPING\n\nIF there’s a baby boom in nine months’ time Joel Corry is taking full responsibility.\n\nThe Brit DJ says his new song Bed, with Raye and David Guetta, is the perfect tune for people to get intimate to.\n\nThe saucy single includes the raunchy lyrics, “I got a bed, but I’d rather be in yours”.\n\nIn an exclusive chat, Joel said: “I think this summer when everyone can start bed-hopping it’s going to be the lovers’ anthem. It’s a baby-making banger.” And Raye says the song perfectly sums up a lot of people’s time in lockdown, as well as hers, admitting she’d rather be in another bed.\n\nShe added: “It’s the perfect Covid story.\n\n“Everyone’s just at home and there are definitely many other beds I would rather have been in than my own.\n\n“I think these lyrics are perfect for this occasion.”\n\nThe pair revealed the collaboration came about after songwriter JIN JIN showed former Geordie Shore star Joel the song, which Raye and French DJ David had made together.\n\nJoel says he then contacted Raye begging to work on the track.\n\nHe said: “As soon as I heard it I was like, ‘Oh my God that is next level and I need to work on this record’. That night I was just straight into Raye’s DMs, I was like, ‘Yo, this Bed track’.\n\n“I’ve been a DJ since I was like 16 years old and David’s always been a massive idol and inspiration in my life.\n\n“Having a collaboration with him, it’s been amazing and chatting to him as well – we’ve been having FaceTimes.”\n\nJoel, who had one of the songs of 2020 with Head & Heart, says this week has been very exciting for him with the Government announcing it expects concerts and festivals to return.\n\nHe said: “I’m having a Zoom with my agent a bit later and we’re gonna have a little talk and see if we can get a little plan together.”\n\nSummer 2021 is back on.\n\nHERE FOR THE BEER\n\nMADISON BEER is sitting pretty after she dropped her debut album, Life Support, yesterday.\n\nThe American pop star shared this exclusive snap of her posing in a mini-skirt and red top to celebrate the launch of the record, which has been years in the pipeline.\n\nThe rising star made a name for herself after being discovered by Justin Bieber aged 13 – and is one of New York’s most exciting exports in recent years.\n\nSpeaking about her album, Madison said: “Writing songs is like therapy for me.\n\n“That’s why this album is called Life Support.\n\n“It helped me get rid of the darkness and see the light.\n\n“All of me is laid bare on this album.\n\n“It’s been a really fulfilling experience to create something that feels so true to myself.\n\n“I can put something into a song and then let it go, send it out into the world.\n\n“When fans tell me I’ve put a voice to something they’ve been feeling, it’s as affirming for me as it is for them.”"
