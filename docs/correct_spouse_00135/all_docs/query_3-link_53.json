        "text": "Well hi there, my little snowflakes!\n\nYou’re just in time for some high jinx and shenanigans!\n\nI’m always on the lookout for those fun holiday quizzes, but let’s face it: we’ve done Elf Names, and Reindeer Names, and that pretty much covers the available options. Last year I made up a What Kind of Christmas Cookie are you quiz. . . which was entertaining. . . but now we’ve done that too.\n\nSo this year I’ve decided to combine holiday quiz tomfoolery with writing prompt/idea generation! Try out this one!\n\nI will not even try to deny that some of these combinations work better than others 😊 But I don’t mind if you cheat a little and use the first letter of your middle or last name or the month your pet iguana was born to get a better result 😊\n\nMy Holiday Picture Book Title is The Littlest Cookie (or, because there’s an alternative on that one, The Biggest Cookie, which is probably more appropriate!) But I think I could write either of those stories and have fun doing it! I might add in a type of cookie. . . The Littlest Sugar Cookie or The Biggest Peppermint Supreme Cookie. Or I might expand one way or the other: The Teeniest Tiniest Itty Bittiest Cookie or The Most Gigantic Christmas Cookie of All Time! But have a go and see what you get and share your title in the comments if you want to!\n\nWasn’t that fun?\n\nDon’t you feel like you just got a little surprise holiday gift?\n\nI bet those writerly brain cells are already humming!\n\nSo you’re welcome, and I won’t keep you from getting words on the page!\n\nGo forth! Write! Create!\n\nAnd enjoy your holidays!\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nHappy Hanukkah!\n\nWondrous Solstice!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nEtc. etc.!\n\nSee you in 2021!\n\nUh. . .\n\nWere you expecting something else?\n\nI already gave you your next picture book idea AND JOY!\n\nWhat more could you want?\n\nOh, silly me.\n\nThere I go again, just completely forgetting the only reason you came to see me today!\n\nI guess, now that you mention it, it IS time to find out who won\n\nTHE 10TH ANNUAL HOLIDAY CONTEST!!!\n\n~ for children’s writers ~\n\nAs always, I was thrilled to see so many wonderful stories! Really! It is amazing and inspiring, not to mention VERY entertaining! There is just so much talent out there amongst you all!\n\nBut as you well know by now, with large entry numbers, all of high quality, come hard choices. My assistant judges and I worked hard to winnow the total down to a manageable number of finalists that we felt were truly all-around deserving of that distinction, and those were the ones we presented to you on Monday (ahem, okay, technically it was Tuesday 😊) for your vote.\n\nThere were, however, a few entries that barely missed being finalists, and many other entries that were outstanding in certain areas even though they might not have qualified all-around for one reason or another, or that the judges couldn’t reach a consensus on.\n\nSo my assistant judges and I would like to award recognition, a lovely badge, and a small prize to the following authors for the following merits:\n\n1. For Honorable Mention In The Competition As A Whole: (entries we truly wrestled with not including in the finalists!)\n\nKaitlyn Sikes for ‘Twas A Cold Winter Solstice (beautifully written!)\n\nJessica Hinrichs for The Merry Melody Farm (also great for younger readers!)\n\nRandi Lynn Mrvos for Four Things (also wonderful kid voice!)\n\nJilanne Hoffman for Promises Are For. . .

Your helpers can be children, animals, elves, aliens, unicorns, fairies . . . whatever your heart desires. He/she/they can help bake, decorate, shovel snow, wrap gifts, clean the house, entertain guests, feed the hungry, comfort the lonely, bring the holiday spirit to those who have lost it – sky’s the limit 😊 But the focus of the story must be on helping – not just a brief mention in passing that Marla helped Dad set the table in the middle of a story about her frustration at not getting the starring role in the school holiday pageant.\n\nYour story may be poetry or prose, silly or serious or sweet, religious or not, based on Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice, New Year’s or whatever you celebrate during the Holiday Season, but is not to exceed 250 words (I know! So much freedom after the Halloweensie Contest 😊 ) (It can be as short as you like (the judges will be grateful 😊 , you are welcome and encouraged to write shorter, but no more than 250! Title not included in word count.) The field is wide open! Have fun! The more creative the better! No illustration notes please. (And yes, if you feel compelled to submit more than one entry you may, just remember you’re competing against yourself!)\n\nPost: Your entry should be posted between right now this very second and Wednesday December 9th at 11:59 PM EST, in ONE of the following three ways:\n\nPost your entry on your own blog and enter your post-specific link (not your main blog URL) to the link list below, OR\n\nPaste your entry in the comment section below (please include your byline since if your posting handle is something like MamaWritesByNightlight I will have no idea who you are 😊), OR\n\nIf you have trouble pasting your entry in the comment section for any reason (which unfortunately does happen!) you can email it to me at susanna[at]susannahill[dot]com and I will post it for you. If you email it, please copy and paste your entry into the body of the email NO ATTACHMENTS – they will not be opened. Please include your title and byline at the top of your entry. (And since there have been many questions about this byline means who it’s by, for example, The Hanukkah Helper by Janie Simcox.)\n\nPlease submit your entry only ONCE! If you add it to the blog link list, and the comments, and email me to post it, things get very confusing! I try to stay as glued to my desk as possible, but sometimes I have to get up so if I don’t respond to your email or approve your post immediately, don’t panic! I’ll get to it as soon as I can!\n\nThere will be no regular posts (Tuesday Debut, Would You Read It, or Perfect Picture Book) for the duration of the contest so this post with the links and comments will stay up for everyone to visit and enjoy until I post the finalists.\n\nThe Judging: My lovely assistants and I will narrow down the entrants to approximately 10 finalists (depending on the number of entries – if we get a lower turnout we’ll post fewer finalists, a higher turnout possibly one or two more.) In the interest of finishing up the contest in a timely fashion so everyone can go about their holidays, we will do our best to post the finalists here by Monday December 14th for you to vote on for a winner. The vote will be closed on Wednesday December 16th at 5 PM EST. Whoever gets the most votes will be first and so on down to tenth place (or wherever we place to), and the winners will be announced on Thursday December 17th. (These dates are subject to adjustment if it takes the judges longer than we anticipate to get the judging completed.)\n\nJudging criteria will be as follows:\n\n1. Kid-appeal! – These stories are intended for a young audience (ages 12 and under), so we’re looking for stories that children will enjoy and relate to.\n\n2. Holiday Helpers! – the rules state a Holiday Helper story, so it must be crystal clear that the story is about someone helping someone else in some way during Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice, New Year’s, or whatever seasonal winter holiday you choose. The story must center on helping – the help must not be just an offhand mention/reference in a story about something else.\n\n3. Quality of story – entries must tell a story, including a main character of some kind and a true story arc even if it’s tiny 😊 Entries must not be merely descriptions or mood pieces.\n\n4. Quality of Writing: check your spelling, grammar, punctuation etc. If you’re going to rhyme, give us your best 😊 Overall writing quality and use of language are also important.\n\n5. Originality and creativity – because that is often what sets one story above another.\n\n6. PLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! Large numbers of entries make it easy to cut entries that haven’t been entered as we asked.\n\nThe Prizes!: The prize list is completely and totally awesome! Read! Covet! Write your best! 😊\n\nA Picture Book Manuscript Read and Critique by Agent Kaitlyn Sanchez of Olswanger Literary!

She grinned and scooped a fingerful of dough from the bowl into her mouth.\n\nThe whole day passed, and Cara never got to play in the snow.\n\nShe carefully placed cookies and milk on the hearth for Santa, along with apples for the reindeer.\n\nWhen Santa arrived, he saw everything Cara had helped with – the presents, the tree, the cookies – and her snow boots waiting hopefully by the back door.\n\nHe smiled and whispered, “You help everyone else. It’s time you got a little special help yourself.”\n\nWhen Cara awoke, her gift was beside her. A wet nose, a wagging tail, and a note in Braille on her collar that read: Hi Cara! I’m Joy, your Guiding Eyes. I can’t wait to take you out to play in the snow!\n\n*** There you have it 😊 ***\n\nWith so many great prizes up for grabs I hope there will be a lot of entries – the more the merrier!
