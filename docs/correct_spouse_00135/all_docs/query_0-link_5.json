I found out on my 40th birthday! What a present from god.‚Äù\n\nThe post concluded: ‚ÄúThe rest of the boys are thrilled for the couple!‚Äù\n\nHis famous pals rushed to comment on the post, with bandmate Duncan James appearing to reveal they are having a boy.\n\nHe wrote: ‚ÄúThey say 3rd a charm - and now ur charm is a baby boy! Massive congrats brother üíôüíôüíô.‚Äù\n\nDenise Van Outen commented: ‚ÄúCongratulations Lee.‚Äù\n\nWhile bandmate Anthony Costa said: ‚ÄúCongratulations.‚Äù\n\nLee is already dad to Bluebell, 16, with his ex-girlfriend Jessica Keevil and a son Rayn with former fianc√© Samantha Miller, who was born in 2008.\n\nHe shares two children with Verity.\n\nLee shocked fans in November of last year when he revealed he‚Äôd secretly had a little girl.\n\nThe couple had another child together before that.\n\nLee and Verity, an Ariana Grande lookalike, tied the knot in secret in May 2022 in Gibraltar.\n\nHe said: \"I met someone finally who loves and supports me in everything I do.\n\n\"Verity is a beautiful, strong and loving woman who I treasure. And I‚Äôm a lucky man to have such a wonderful mother for my child, and now wife, in her.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been more calm and grounded and I have Verity to thank for that. I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been in my life because of the\n\nwonderful family life I now have.\"\n\nStunning Verity is a talented singer who appeared on X Factor in 2009 - and even turned her talent into a career when she worked as an Ariana Grande lookalike and impersonator."
