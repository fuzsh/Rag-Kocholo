        "text": "Out of the, er, Blue, Lee Ryan has just found out he's got a secret love child.\n\nHe had a paternity test after Jessica Keevil, who he met in a nightclub, got in touch to say he had a daughter aged two.\n\nAfter getting the DNA results last week, the Blue star asked to meet Jessica.\n\nHe has since offered to play a full and active role in the toddler's upbringing - as well as maintenance.\n\nLast night, Lee, 26, said: \"I will definitely be a part of my daughter's life, but I would appreciate it if everyone could respect this is a private matter.\"\n\nWe're told: \"Lee was stunned when he received the phone call. Initially he thought it was a hoax as Blue fans can be a little crazy.\n\n\"But when he realised who the woman was, he agreed to undergo a paternity test.\n\n\"Then Lee had to break the news to his fiancee, Samantha Miller. It wasn't easy but they've talked it through and everything is fine.\n\n\"Lee is excited about adding to his family and has always wanted a little girl.\"\n\nLee - who is currently recording Blue's comeback album, due out early next year - had his son, Rayn, less than a year after meeting Samantha, 21, on MySpace.\n\nLast night a spokesman for Lee said: \"Lee was contacted by Jessica Keevil to say that her daughter was Lee's child.\n\n\"Lee immediately sorted a paternity test, and he is the father of the child. Lee is now sorting out access and child support.\n\n\"This has come as a huge surprise to Lee, but he will 100% be part of the child's life from here on.\""
