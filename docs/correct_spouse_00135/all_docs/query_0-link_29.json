        "text": "Blue's Lee Ryan has welcomed his fourth child with wife Verity Paris.\n\nThe singer – who has also appeared on EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing – shared the happy news on TikTok after some fans showed concern as he didn't seem to be involved in the band's promotional duties for new album Heart & Soul.\n\n\"Hey everyone. I just wanted to say sorry that I'm not there for the promo right now,\" Ryan said in the video.\n\nRelated: Lee Ryan reveals he wants to return to EastEnders – but not alone\n\n\"Everything's okay. I know the boys are doing everything. I know there are a lot of people talking madness. I've actually had a little baby,\" he continued.\n\n\"She's only three weeks old now, so I'm at home with my family, being a dad and being with the children.\n\n\"I'll be back soon with the boys. Thank you so much for the amazing support that you're showing me.\"\n\nEarlier this year, it was announced that Ryan and bandmates Duncan James, Simon Webbe and Antony Costa would reunite for a new album. Heart & Soul was released in September, and the band has a few UK tour dates lined up in December.\n\nRelated: Former EastEnders star Lee Ryan reveals a big Woody storyline was scrapped\n\nRyan's baby daughter is the singer's fourth child. He and his wife welcomed their first daughter in June last year, and he also has two children from two previous relationships: 15-year-old daughter Bluebell with Jessica Keevil, and 13-year-old son Rayn with Samantha Miller.\n\nAlongside his music career, Ryan is also an actor, known for his roles in medical drama Holby City and a year-long stint on EastEnders as Harry 'Woody' Woodward.\n\nIn 2018, he was part of the celebrity lineup of Strictly with pro dancer Nadiya Bychkova. They were eliminated in the second week."
