        "text": "Surprise! Lee Ryan has secretly tied the knot with his girlfriend of two years, Verity Paris.\n\nThe singer, who shot to fame in boyband Blue and now lives on the Costa Del Sol in Spain, tied the knot in Gibraltar earlier this week.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nLee shared the happy news in an interview with The Sun, gushing that he's the 'happiest he's ever been' after starting a family with Verity.\n\nLast year, Lee and Verity welcomed their first child together although they've yet to publicly reveal their daughter's name.\n\nSpeaking about his new wife, Lee said: 'Verity is a beautiful, strong and loving woman who I treasure, and I’m a lucky man to have such a wonderful mother for my child, and now wife in her.\n\n'I’ve never been more calm and grounded and I have Verity to thank for that. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life because of the wonderful family life I now have.'\n\nAs well as his little girl with Verity, Lee is also a dad to daughter Bluebell, now 14, with ex girlfriend Jessica Keevil. He also has son Rayn, 12, with former fiancee Samantha Miller.\n\nVerity also comes from a musical background and appeared on the X Factor in 2009. She's also worked as an Ariana Grande lookalike and impersonator during her career.\n\nSadly, her time on the sixth season of the X Factor was cut short at bootcamp with Verity and her then heavily pregnant singing partner Lauren Stanley being sent home.\n\nLee and Verity were first linked in January 2020 and moved to Spain together later that year.\n\nIn February 2021 they revealed they were expecting their first child together."
