Both mother and baby are healthy.\"\n\nThe happy news was initially broken by Lee's bandmate Duncan James when he was asked about the possibility of the 'All Rise' group - which also includes Simon Webbe and Antony Costa - getting together again soon.\n\nSpeaking on 'Lorraine', Duncan said: \"I think with the pandemic everything’s kind of changed and shifted which is kind of annoying. Lee [Ryan] lives in Spain, he’s just become a daddy again.\n\n\"So he’s got a little wee bubba and Simon has just become a father again so there’s like a baby Blue boom going on.’\n\nLee has previously admitted it took a long time for him and Sammi to co-parent properly but he's thankful he and his son now have a close relationship.\n\nSpeaking previously, Lee said: \"I shouldn’t have lost the family life I had with my ex-fiancee, Sammi, and our little boy, Rayn.\n\n“He’s ten now and we’re really close again. But I neglected the relationship so it’s only relatively recently that he’s been able to see functioning co-parenting, something my mum and dad never achieved.\n\n“I don’t have any regrets about the mistakes I’ve made because they’ve shown me that something good can come out of something bad.”"
