What a present from god’.\n\nThe message added that his bandmates are ‘thrilled’ for the couple.\n\nLee and Verity’s arrival will make him a dad for the fifth time.\n\nLee is already a dad to Bluebell, 16, whose mum is Lee’s ex-girlfriend Jessica Keevil.\n\nThe star also has teenage son Rayn with former fiancee Samantha Miller in 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, with Verity, he has a one-year-old and a baby daughter born last year.\n\nLee and Verity had secretly married in March 2022 with an intimate ceremony in Gibraltar, after dating for two years.\n\nHe told The Sun earlier in the year: ‘I met someone finally who loves and supports me in everything I do.\n\n‘Verity is a beautiful, strong and loving woman who I treasure. And I’m a lucky man to have such a wonderful mother for my child, and now wife, in her.\n\n‘I’ve never been more calm and grounded and I have Verity to thank for that. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life because of the wonderful family life I now have.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Jonnie Irwin reveals ‘frustration’ as his terminal cancer is ‘on the move’"
