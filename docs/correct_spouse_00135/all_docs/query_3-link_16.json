        "text": "Lee Ryan is indeed set to become a father for the third time after confirming his girlfriend, Verity Paris, is pregnant.\n\nThe Blue singer couldn’t be happier to welcome his new baby girl in June and says there’s ‘nothing better’ than being a dad.\n\n‘It’s the most amazing thing in the world,’ he told Hello! Magazine while confirming the news.\n\nVerity added: ‘I’m very comfortable moving into the next stage of my life with someone who is so paternal and good with children.’\n\n‘Lee is so hands on and to me it is very reassuring to be with someone that loves family life.’\n\nThe couple share a huge passion for music and performing – with Verity an Ariana Grande impersonator in the Very Grande tribute act – and they hope to pass it onto their daughter.\n\nLee explained: ‘Our love of music has been a huge part of our relationship. We sit in the hot tub on our roof terrace, singing at the top of our voices. I don’t know what the neighbours make of it.\n\n‘I can’t wait to teach this little baby how to sing and play the piano and saxophone. I sing to the bump too. I am training her and I think she is definitely going to be creative in that way.’\n\nLee, 37, is already a father to two children from previous relationships.\n\nThe All Rise singer shares son Rayn, 12, hairdresser Samantha Miller who he was once engaged to. He also has a 13-year-old daughter, Bluebell, with ex-girlfriend Jessica Keevil, and was previously engaged to Atomic Kitten’s Liz McClarnon in 2003.\n\nNews of Verity’s pregnancy comes after the couple were pictured on a beach together in Malaga, Spain over the weekend.\n\nClowning around together, Lee was seen cradling Verity’s stomach and puffing his own out in a mock bump.\n\nTo read the full article, pick up the new issue of HELLO! on sale on Monday.\n\nGot a showbiz story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Blue’s Lee Ryan ‘expecting third child with girlfriend Verity Paris’ as pair clown around on beach"
