        "text": "Rain Ryan, born 2008. Rain is Lee’s son with ex-girlfriend Samantha ‘Sammi’ Miller.\n\nWho is Lee Ryan?\n\nLee Ryan is a singer, actor and TV personality best known as ¼ of the British boyband Blue, alongside Antony Costa, Simon Webbe (pictured) and Duncan James.\n\nThe band first got together in 2000, before splitting in 2005, reforming again in 2011.\n\nLee made a notorious appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2014 and also appeared regularly in EastEnders as Woody Woodward in 2017.\n\nNow, he’s joined the Strictly Come Dancing 2018 line up ?\n\nBluebell Ryan\n\nIn 2007, Lee and then-girlfriend Jessica welcomed a baby girl, named Bluebell. She's pictured here as a young girl.\n\nLee often shares pictures of her daughter on Instagram. Bluebell’s about 11 as of 2018, and in the 2nd snap.\n\nRain Ryan\n\nIn 2008, Samantha Miller gave birth to a baby boy, named Rain Ryan. Unfortunately, Lee and Sammi haven't always seen eye to eye.\n\nRain was 5 years old in 2014, when Lee went into the Celebrity Big Brother house.\n\nSammi made claims suggesting that Lee had told his son to watch him on the show – despite the fact he then went on to pursue romantic relationships in the house. She also accused him of not seeing his son very often.\n\nShe alleged to Closer: ‘What kind of father tells his 5-year-old to watch him on TV and then behaves like a porn star?\n\n\"Luckily I can shield him from it because he’s only 5 and I wouldn’t let him watch the show.\n\n\"But it’s vile, the worst thing Lee’s done to me. My family are disgusted at his behaviour.\"\n\nLee’s manager responded: “Lee provides financially for his son and visits as often as is practicable. We wholly refute any suggestion he is a bad father.”\n\nIt seems Lee and Samantha are getting on well since his CBB stint, with the pair posing for cute pics with their son, who is about 10 years old as of 2018.\n\nLee talks about being a dad\n\n\"I am so lucky to have these two amazing little angels in my life,\" he recently wrote in a touching Instagram.\n\n\"Spending time with my kids and trying to be the best dad I can possibly be is all anyone can do...\n\n\"I’m in no way perfect and we live and learn because that’s what life is for.. but I am blessed to have my children happy and healthy.\n\n\"I say a prayer all the time for this because it’s the biggest gift I’ve ever received ?❤️\"\n\nDoes Lee Ryan currently have a partner?\n\nLee’s not currently married, nor does it seem he has a partner at the moment.\n\nPreviously, Lee was engaged to Atomic Kitten singer Liz McClarnon in the early ‘00s, and was engaged to Rain’s mum Samantha (pictured) in 2008, before they decided to split.\n\nMany will remember his love triangle on CBB with Jasmine Waltz and Casey Batchelor, too.\n\nLee Ryan on Strictly Come Dancing 2018\n\nLee’s confirmed to star alongside Steps icon Faye Tozer and celeb mum Katie Piper in this year’s Strictly.\n\nWe wonder if his days dancing in boyband Blue will help his chances with the ballroom moves?\n\nProbably a bit safer for Bluebell and Rain to watch dad on telly, this time ?\n\nImages: Instagram/Lee Ryan\n\nRead more:"
