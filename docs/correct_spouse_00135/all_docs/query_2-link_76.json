        "text": "The mother of Celebrity Big Brother star Lee Ryan has leapt to his defence, insisting he is not a heartbreaker.\n\nAlong with millions of viewers, Sheila saw her son smooching model Casey Batchelor before suddenly dropping her for ­glamorous American actress Jasmine Waltz.\n\nBut Sheila says the last thing he would have wanted was to upset anyone. She also reveals how he is not in the BB House for romance – but for money to help pay maintenance for his two children.\n\nShe says Lee, of boyband Blue, has been emotionally scarred by women and was “trying to rebuild his confidence” after a bitter split with fiancée Sammi Miller – mother of his four-year-old son Rain – in 2010.\n\nYesterday Sheila said: “Lee has always tried his hardest to be a loving and generous father to Rain.\n\n\"He has only ever tried to make the split amicable and to make Rain as financially secure as possible.\n\n“The failure of his relationship with Sammi caused him a great deal of pain.\n\n\"Lee has always been loving, affectionate and generous to all that know him. All that matters is that Rain continues to have two loving and devoted parents.”\n\nOn CBB, Lee, 30, was initially shackled to Casey, 29, and the pair grew close, sharing kisses, cuddles and a bed together.\n\nBut once they were released from their handcuffs, Lee – who stressed on screen how he didn’t want to be portrayed as a “player” – turned his attentions to Jasmine, 31.\n\nDefending him Sheila said: “He is a young man and having been chained to a beautiful girl I think he may have acted in a way that all men would.\n\n\"They are both lovely girls and have different qualities which Lee would like to be condensed in one person, so it makes it very confusing for him.”\n\nThe singer also has a six-year-old daughter, Bluebell, with Jessica Keevil, who he supports financially."
