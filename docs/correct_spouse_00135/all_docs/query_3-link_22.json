        "text": "BLUE'S Lee Ryan has revealed he is expecting a baby girl with pregnant girlfriend Verity Paris.\n\nOn Friday, The Sun exclusively revealed the 37-year-old singer was to become a dad for a third time.\n\nLee already has daughter Bluebell, 13, with ex Jessica Keevil and son Rayn, 12, with his ex-fiance, Samantha Miller.\n\nNow Lee has opened up about his latest baby news to Hello! revealing he is expecting a daughter with Verity, who is an Ariana Grande impersonator.\n\nHe said: \"I'm so excited. I love being a dad; there is nothing better than that. It's the most amazing thing in the world.\"\n\nVerity added: \"I'm very comfortable moving into the next stage of my life with someone who is so paternal and good with children.\n\n\"Lee is so hands on and to me it is very reassuring to be with someone that loves family life.\"\n\nLee also revealed he hoped his little girl will follow in his musical footsteps, saying: \"We sit in the hot tub on our roof terrace, singing at the top of our voices.\n\n\"I don't know what the neighbours make of it. I can't wait to teach this little baby how to sing and play the piano and saxophone. I sing to the bump too.\"\n\nHe was first seen with Verity, who appeared on The X Factor in 2009, in January 2020, having joined reality TV series Celebs Go Dating the previous year in a bid to find love.\n\nThe couple moved to the Costa Del Sol in Spain last year and revealed they now have \"a better quality of life\" as well as a \"new lease of life\".\n\nIt means their daughter will have a dual passport when she is born and they are keen for her to speak Spanish."
