        "text": "Phillip Schofield wasted no time in asking the question on This Morning viewers' lips as they were left baffled by Blue's appearance on the show. Duncan James, Antony Costa and Simon Webb appeared live on the ITV daytime show (November 2) to chat to the presenter and his co-host Holly Willoughby.\n\nTheir appearance on the show at around midday had been teased since the show started at 10am, with the band's different hits playing out into the studio. And it appeared it was much to Holly's delight as she sang and danced along to the likes of All Rise and One Love.\n\nFollowing their interview with Holly and Phillip, in which they chatted about their new music and going back on the road 20 years after bursting onto the music scenes in the early noughties, Blue gave a performance of their new single, Haven't Found You Yet.\n\nREAD MORE: ITV This Morning viewers distracted midway through programme over nothing to do with the show\n\nHowever, viewers were quick to notice Blue are usually a four-piece and it wouldn't take fans long to realise Lee Ryan was missing. @Bebop76845845 asked: \"Do they leave Lee at home when they on TV #ThisMorning.\" @onlysmols joked: \"Someone didn't do the headcount before Blue got on the coach, they seem to have left Lee behind. #ThisMorning.\"\n\n@missohlola posted: \"WHERE IS LEE RYAN PLEASE #ThisMorning.\" @bramwell_ashley echoed: \"Where’s lee ? #ThisMorning.\" But there was a perfectly reasonable explanation.\n\nAs Holly and Phillip welcomed Duncan, Antony, and Simon onto the famous This Morning sofa, Phillip quickly said: \"We're joined by Antony, Ducan, and Simon right now... there's one missing.\" He then asked: \"Where's Lee?\"\n\n\"It's Lee, isn't it?\" Duncan quipped before explaining: \"No, he's had a baby. Well not him, his Mrs has had a baby.\" They then showed a picture of Lee on screen with his newborn daughter as Holly cooed after the singer's new arrival.\n\n\"So listen, you're back...\" Holly, 41, then remarked trying to kickstart their interview. The musical trio then giggled as Duncan said 'sorry'.\n\nBlue fans had been speculating where Lee was after noticing he had missed some of the band's promotional interviews, including on Sunday Brunch over the weekend and BBC Breakfast last week.\n\nBut Lee, 39, took to the band’s TikTok page to confirm the reason he has been absent is that he has been spending time with his new baby. He explained:\"‘Hey everyone. I just wanted to say sorry that I’m not there for the promo right now and all the boys are doing everything.\n\n\"Everything’s ok, I know there are a lot of people talking some madness. I’ve actually had a little baby, as you can see. She’s only three weeks old now, so I’m at home with my family, being a dad and being with my children.\"\n\nHe added: \"I will be back doing stuff and I’ll be back soon with the boys. Thank you so much for all the amazing support that you’ve shown our album, it’s absolutely brilliant and I’m so happy that everyone is enjoying the album.\n\n\"Thank you so much for going out there and buying it and supporting it and I’ll see you soon.\" In the clip, Lee could be seen cradling the newborn, donning a pin babygrow, in his arms before the camera panned over to show his toddler daughter next to him in her pram.\n\nAs well as his their new baby, Lee also shares the one-year-old with his wife Verity Paris, and is also dad to 14-year-old Bluebell with Jessica Keevil and Rayn, 13, with Samantha Miller.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
