        "text": "LEE Ryan became a household name when he joined the boyband Blue when he was a teenager.\n\nSince then he has not only been a pop star, he has conquered the world of reality TV and is currently in the new E4 dance series, The Real Dirty Dancing.\n\nWhat is Lee Ryan's net worth?\n\nLee Ryan, 38 was born in Kent in 1983 and rose to fame in the early 2000s as one of the founding members of boy band Blue along with Simon Webbe, Anthony Costa, and Duncan James.\n\nIn 2015, Lee became the fourth and final Blue band member to declare himself bankrupt.\n\nHis current net worth is unknown, but in August 2021 he declared he \"had no money\" after being hit with his third driving ban.\n\nHe said he couldn't afford to cover a £1,500 fine for speeding as Covid had left him \"unable to work\".\n\nIs Lee Ryan married and does he have children?\n\nLee isn't married but he is in a relationship with former X Factor star Verity Paris.\n\nThe couple started dating in 2020, and have a baby daughter together.\n\nLee has enjoyed a colourful love life over the years.\n\nThe singer became engaged to Atomic Kitten star Liz McClarnon in 2003, but later split after Liz said she found being in a celebrity couple too hard.\n\nThat was the closest he has come to getting married.\n\nFrom his relationship with Jessica Keevil, Lee has a daughter named Bluebell, 14.\n\nAs well as son Ryan with former fiancée Samantha Miller.\n\nLee also had a fling with his Blue bandmate Duncan.\n\nThe Sun revealed in 2014 how both group members shared an ongoing sexual relationship during their earlier years and still remain close today.\n\nWhat is Lee Ryan famous for?\n\nLee is most famous for being in the boy band group Blue.\n\nLee and the rest of the Blue group members are still together - but these days they only tour and have no plans to make any more new music.\n\nSince releasing the first of their three UK number one albums, All Rise, in 2001, the band have sold 15 million records worldwide, including a series of hit singles.\n\nBlue reunited after a six-year hiatus in 2011 to represent the UK in the Eurovision song contest with their track I Can, coming 11th.\n\nSince taking part in the 2013 ITV show The Big Reunion they have released a further two albums, Roulette and Colours.\n\nDuring his time away from the band, Lee embarked on a solo singing career, his self-titled album charting at number six in the UK charts in 2005.\n\nWhat TV shows has Lee Ryan been in?\n\nDeciding to venture into the TV industry, Lee and his fellow band member Duncan James appeared in an episode of comedy panel show Through the Keyhole in 2013.\n\nHe then appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in 2014 where he came out as bisexual, later stating in an interview, \"I'm very open about what I've done in the past but that was the easiest way to come out. I did so much other stuff that people didn't even notice.\"\n\nIn February 2017, it was confirmed that Ryan had landed a role in the BBC soap, EastEnders where he was casted as Woody Woodward.\n\nHe later received 2017 Inside Soap Award nomination for Best Newcomer.\n\nIn 2018 he appeared as on Strictly Come dancing and then a year later on Celebs go dating."
