        "text": "They added: “It’s early days but they’re excited.”\n\nIn photos obtained by the outlet, the couple can be seen walking along a beach in Spain whilst marvelling at Verity's blossoming bump.\n\nIn another photo, Lee lovingly places his hand on her stomach as they sit on some steps by the seashore.\n\nThe Mirror has contacted a rep for Lee Ryan for comment.\n\nLee is father to son Rayn, 13, who he shares with ex-fiancee Samantha Miller.\n\nIn 2009, the year after having Rayn, Lee was shocked to discover he had a love child when a former fling Jessica Keevil.\n\nShe got in touch to tell him he had a daughter, Bluebelle. She was around two years old by this point and Rayn was just two months younger.\n\nLee met ­Jessica at a Kent nightclub in 2007.\n\nThe couple went on a string of dates and later Jessica told Ryan she was expecting his baby. But he broke off contact before Bluebelle’s birth in 2008.\n\nIn 2009 he ­accepted Bluebelle was his after undergoing a paternity test. At the time his spokesman said: “Lee is sorting out access and child support. He will be 100% part of the child’s life.”\n\nLast year, reports emerged that boyband Blue are planning a reunion tour in 2021 to celebrate 20 years of the band.\n\nDuncan James, Lee Ryan, Simon Webbe and Antony Costa will hit the road to entertain fans who have supported them over the last two decades.\n\nSinger Duncan told The Sun: \"We were wanting to do something for our 20th anniversary but at the moment lockdown has meant it’s been difficult to get together. It’s not been easy.\n\n\"There could be something in the pipeline as we’re really good mates.\"\n\nThe group formed in 2000 and released their first studio album All Rise in 2001.\n\nDo you enjoy reading about celebrities? Sign up for all the best celeb news from the Mirror here .\n\nAn insider told the paper that while they have all gone on to pursue other ventures, Blue will always hold a special place in the hearts of members of the band.\n\n\"They feel really proud that they have stood the test of time and many of their songs are still played on the radio now.\n\n“Getting to a huge milestone like their 20th anniversary is not something that they could allow to pass by without celebration,\" said the band source.\n\n\"They know they have a loyal fanbase who they love to entertain so it’s safe to say it’s going to be a Blue extravaganza in 2021,\" they teased.\n\nThe foursome has had varying degrees of success in their solo careers since leaving the band and endured some financial hardships.\n\nIn May 2015, Lee became the final member of the band to declare himself bankrupt.\n\nIt came two years after Duncan filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after the band's company Blueworld Ltd became unable to pay creditors and went into administration.\n\nSimon Webbe previously said the band 'hardly saw a penny' of their earnings as he went bankrupt a few weeks after Duncan.\n\nWhile Anthony Costa also became insolvent in the same year.\n\nThe band racked up more than 40 number one hits around the world and sold 15 million records and worked with the likes of Sir Elton, Steve Wonder and Lil' Kim.\n\nThey announced a hiatus in 2004 and then reunited in 2011 for the Eurovision Song Contest where they came 11th place.\n\nIn 2013 they released their fourth studio album, Roulette and confirmed they were joining the Big Reunion - to tour with six other groups from the past for a number of gigs."
