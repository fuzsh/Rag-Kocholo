        "text": "Lee Ryan has become a dad for the fourth time after secretly welcoming the latest addition to his family, a beautiful baby girl.\n\nThe star took the boyband Blue's official TikTok account to share the amazing news with their fans and to explain the newborn was the reason he wasn't currently taking part in the band's promotional tour.\n\nLee, 39, is already a dad to 14-year-old Bluebell with Jessica Keevil, Rayn, 13, whom he shares with Samantha Miller, and a one-year-old daughter whose mum is Lee's current wife, Verity Paris.\n\nThe singer can be seen in the latest clip cradling his three-week-old daughter. In the video, he says: \"Hey everyone. I just wanted to say sorry that I'm not there for the promo right now.\n\n\"Everything's ok. I know the boys are doing everything. I know there are a lot of people talking madness. I've actually had a little baby. She's only three weeks old now, so I'm at home with my family, being a dad and being with the children.\"\n\nAs he continued to confirm he will be back working soon his now-second youngest child can be heard in the background and he jokes: \"Yep, that's your sister. \"\n\nHe thanked all his fans for their continued amazing support and many took to the comments section to wish the star well with his newest addition.\n\nOne user wrote: \"Respect this man! Family comes first,\" while another gushed: \"Aww congratulations Lee & family.\"\n\nOthers shared their relief that he was okay following his recent no-shows during the promos, while some pleaded with him to make sure he was still available for their upcoming tour despite becoming a dad again.\n\nThe video was also posted on Twitter where one fan commented: \"We love you Lee, thank you for confirming the reason your not there, but us true fans have been going and supporting the boys and you no matter what, enjoy your family time that's the most important thing being together enjoying it as life is too short. See you on the tour xx\"\n\nIn March, Lee revealed he had secretly married partner Verity following their two-year relationship.\n\nThey said \"I do\" at a low-key ceremony which was attended by a number of their close friends and family earlier and Lee told The Sun at the time: \"I met someone finally who loves and supports me in everything I do.\n\n\"Verity is a beautiful, strong and loving woman who I treasure, and I’m a lucky man to have such a wonderful mother for my child, and now wife in her.\n\n\"I’ve never been more calm and grounded and I have Verity to thank for that. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life because of the wonderful family life I now have.\"\n\nWhile Lee continues to be a success with boyband Blue, Verity was a contestant on 2009's edition of the X Factor before launching a career as an Ariana Grande lookalike and impersonator."
