        "text": "The All Rise hit-maker took to social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday to share the happy news with fans via boyband Blue’s official account.\n\nAlongside a loved-up snap of himself and his wife sharing a kiss while he cradled her growing bump, he wrote: “Me and my wife, Verity, are very pleased to announce our new baby, that will be born this year.”\n\nHe jokingly added: “The news came out of the blue. I found out on my 40th birthday! What a present from God.”\n\nThe post concluded: “The rest of the boys are thrilled for the couple!”\n\nBandmate Duncan James appeared to imply that they are expecting a boy in his response, writing from his own account: “They say 3rd a charm - and now ur charm is a baby boy! Massive congrats brother,” followed by three blue heart emojis.\n\nAnothony Costa, who is also a member of Blue, also shared his well-wishes, simply replying: “Congratulations”."
