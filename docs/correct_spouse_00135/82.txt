LEE Ryan has secretly married girlfriend Verity Paris in a romantic Gibraltar ceremony, The Sun can reveal.

The Blue star tied the knot with singer Verity, who gave birth to their first child together last year, watched by friends and family earlier this week.

Newly-married Lee told The Sun: “I met someone finally who loves and supports me in everything I do.

“Verity is a beautiful, strong and loving woman who I treasure, and I’m a lucky man to have such a wonderful mother for my child, and now wife in her.

“I’ve never been more calm and grounded and I have Verity to thank for that. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life because of the wonderful family life I now have.”

The couple, who have been together for two years, welcomed their daughter, whose name they haven’t publicly shared, in August last year.

Lee also shares daughter Bluebell, now 13, with ex-girlfriend Jessica Keevil, and son Rayn, 12, with former fiancee Samantha Miller.

Stunning Verity is a talented singer who appeared on X Factor in 2009 - and even turned her talent into a career when she worked as an Ariana Grande lookalike and impersonator.

Real Dirty Dancing winner Lee moved to Spain last year, saying his new home on the Costa Del Sol gave the family "a better quality of life" as well as a "new lease of life".

He told Hello! magazine: "We sit in the hot tub on our roof terrace, singing at the top of our voices.

"I don't know what the neighbours make of it. I can't wait to teach this little baby how to sing and play the piano and saxophone."
