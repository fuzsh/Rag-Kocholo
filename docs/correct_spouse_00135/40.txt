Lee Ryan has married his girlfriend Verity Paris at a romantic ceremony in Gibraltar.

The Blue star, 38, tied the knot with his love, who once appeared as a contestant on The X Factor, at a secret wedding earlier this week.

The couple have gone from strength to strength after being an item for two years.

They welcomed their daughter in August 2021.

Pop star Ryan gushed he is “the happiest I’ve ever been in my life” following the glamorous wedding.

He told The Sun: “I met someone finally who loves and supports me in everything I do.

“Verity is a beautiful, strong and loving woman who I treasure, and I’m a lucky man to have such a wonderful mother for my child, and now wife in her.

“I’ve never been more calm and grounded and I have Verity to thank for that. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life because of the wonderful family life I now have.”

The couple were first romantically linked in 2020 and they started a family together with their new life in Spain.

The pair are yet to confirm their daughter’s name in the public eye.

But a spokesperson for the singer said in a statement at the time: "Lee and Verity welcomed the arrival of their beautiful daughter earlier this month as they begin their new family life together in Spain.

"Both mother and baby are healthy."

The Blue star also shares daughter Bluebell with ex-partner Jessica Keevil and son Rayn with Samantha Miller who he was previously engaged to.
