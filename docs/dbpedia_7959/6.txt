Fascinated by movies as a child, Glenn Gordon Caron moved to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting assignments. Within five years, he had produced the debut season of "Remington Steele" (NBC, 1982-87) and moved on to "Moonlighting" (ABC, 1985-89), one of the freshest and most inventive shows of its era. The Cybill Shepherd/Bruce Willis comedy consistently defied expectation and convention, earning it a devoted audience and well-deserved kudos for Caron, who kept a close eye on its scripts. After his departure from "Moonlighting," he tried his hand at motion pictures, directing such films as "Clean and Sober" (1988), "Love Affair" (1994), and "Picture Perfect" (1997). Upon his return to television, Caron came up with "Medium" (NBC/CBS, 2005-2011). The offbeat fantasy-horror-drama delivered interesting characters and conflict to go with its creator's flourishes, which included elaborate visual work and the first use of high-definition 3-D on primetime television. One of the most innovative and celebrated television producers of his era, Caron was highly instrumental in persuading networks to try new things and move outside established formulas, and the ratings success of "Moonlighting" and "Medium" proved that audiences were very receptive to such creativity.
