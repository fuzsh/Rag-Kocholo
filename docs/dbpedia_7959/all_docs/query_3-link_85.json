        "text": "Visitation by aliens aside, it appears that this movie season will go down in history as the summer of beautiful, ambitious women who can't get their man _ at least, not without lots of scheming.\n\nFirst, My Best Friend's Wedding offered us Julia Roberts desperately trying to win a scruffy sportswriter. Now, the otherwise charming Picture Perfect asks us to believe that Jennifer Aniston can't land Kevin Bacon, of all people, without a trick up her sleeve.\n\nBut that's a minor sin in this engaging romantic comedy, a successful first outing for Aniston (TV's Friends) in a dominant film role. Light, funny and a little predictable around the edges, Picture Perfect offers a scaled-down but pleasant alternative to summer's blockbusters.\n\nKate (Aniston) may have a great job at an advertising agency, but her personal life is another story. Her mother, played with hilarious shrillness by Olympia Dukakis, wants her to get married. Her co-worker Sam (Bacon) won't give her the time of day because she's \"a good girl.\" And guess who's the only person qualified to catch the bouquet at a wedding reception?\n\nThe ultimate insult is that her boss won't promote Kate because she's unattached and unmortgaged, leading him to believe that she could pull up stakes at any time.\n\n\"You're the only person I know who lives like they're still in college,\" he tells her.\n\nSo with a friend's help, Kate simply invents a fiance in the form of Nick (Jay Mohr), a videographer she bumps into at a wedding. And Nick couldn't be further from the two-faced sports agent Mohr portrayed in Jerry Maguire. Nick is earnest. He considers it an honor to videotape people's weddings, bar mitzvahs and baptisms for a living. He rescues small children in his spare time.\n\nHis presence also jump-starts Kate's career and gets Sam's attention. But of course, Nick really will fall for Kate. And of course, the plan will go painfully awry.\n\nPicture Perfect may get lost in the big-name bombast of summer, and that's too bad. Because whatever it lacks in star power or surprising plot twists, it compensates with a rare and pure charm.\n\nMOVIE REVIEW: B\n\nPicture Perfect\n\nDirector: Glenn Gordon Caron\n\nCast: Jennifer Aniston, Jay Mohr, Kevin Bacon, Olympia Dukakis, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Dunn\n\nScreenplay: Arleen Sorkin, Paul Slansky and Glenn Gordon Caron\n\nRating: PG-13 (profanity, sexual situations)\n\nStudio: Twentieth Century Fox"
