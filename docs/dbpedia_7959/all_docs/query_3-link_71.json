        "text": "Writer Emilio Mauro was in Los Angeles earlier this month, but it wasn’t because Ben Affleck is directing a pilot of his television show. Just a few days after Deadline.com reported that Affleck would helm the drama that Mauro and Michael Yebba pitched to him during filming of “The Town,’’ and that Glenn Gordon Caron (“Moonlighting,’’ “Medium’’) had signed on as showrunner, Mauro was on the West Coast to work on his other big project — the film “God Only Knows.’’ The movie was shot around Rhode Island and Boston last year, and Mauro is banking on it getting attention from the Sundance Film Festival. “We have to get in,’’ Mauro said of the crime movie, which stars Harvey Keitel, Ben Barnes, Leighton Meester, and Stoughton’s own Kenny Wormald. “Obviously, it’s an indie. It’s got some big talent,’’ Mauro said, when he called us from Los Angeles. As for the TV show, Mauro says he doesn’t know whether it’ll be shot in Boston, but he’s hopeful. After all, “The Middle Man’’ (that’s the show’s name for now) is about Boston mafia in the ’60s. Mauro, who’s an executive producer on the project, explained that he and writer-actor Yebba pitched it when Yebba was acting in “The Town’’ and working as a stand-in for Boston actor-rapper Slaine. “I’ve got to hand it to Ben. He said, ‘I’m going to direct this,’’ Mauro said. “He said, ‘I don’t know when,’ but five years later, he is.’’"
