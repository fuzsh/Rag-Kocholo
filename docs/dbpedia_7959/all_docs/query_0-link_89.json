        "meta_description": "Welcome to 'Don't You Want Me?' - a podcast series taking a lighthearted look at the most relatable, intriguing and dysfunctional relationships in film. \n\nIn this irresistible, inexpensive, pink episode, we’re clutching our cigarette cases and climbing aboard the ocean liner with 1957’s An Affair to Remember. Directed by Leo McCarey and written by him along with Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart, this was a remake of McCarey’s 1939 movie Love Affair. The tale was revived yet again in 1994 by director Glenn Gordon Caron when Warren Beatty and Annette Bening took the lead roles. But tonight we’ll be focusing on what happened when Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr were put centre stage as Nickie and Terry, creating the ultimate fizzy cocktail and leading audience members through the years to surreptitiously wipe a few tears on the sleeves of their polyester cardis. What is it about this mix of adultery and PR for the Empire State Building that makes us dewy-eyed? Let’s find out. I promise not to sing.\n\nIf you enjoy this episode, please consider leaving us a rating or a review on your podcast app of choice, as it really helps us spread the word. The pink champagne’s on us.\n\nFollow Don't You Want Me on Twitter @DYWMpodcast, Instagram @dywmpodcast and Facebook @DYWMpodcast \n\nRecorded in January 2023.\n\nEdited by Rich Nelson\n\nAdditional material written by Catrin Lowe \n\nTheme music by Paul Abbott (on Twitter @Pablovich)\n\nDesign by NOAKE (on Instagram @n_o_a_k_e)\n\nRich can be found on Twitter @Fantana275\n\nCat can be found on Twitter @KittyCostanza",
