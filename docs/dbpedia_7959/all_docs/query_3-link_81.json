It was serious about money on Dallas and Dynasty. It was serious about crime on Murder, She Wrote and Spenser: For Hire. Tom Selleck may have flashed a smile in his shorty shorts and Hawaiian shirt on Magnum, p.i., but he always took his investigations very seriously. Television was even serious on its sitcoms. Family Ties was getting serious about alcoholism with guest star Tom Hanks. When Natalie wouldn’t date Tootie’s cousin on The Facts of Life, it turned into an intense lesson about racism. Television had no space for shenanigans of any kind. In the middle of a decade known for collecting the most toys, the viewing population had no appetite for silly—but that was about to change. Enter writer Glenn Gordon Caron and his creation of the television show Moonlighting (1985-1989). Suddenly it was pie fights, rhyming secretaries, and chase scenes. Television was about to get a much needed Boink.\n\nMoonlighting was a detective series (sure it was) starring real-life movie star and model Cybill Shepherd as Maddie Hayes. Maddie was a model turned detective. (Wait, what?) There sure is nothing serious about that idea. She was saddled with unknown real-life bartender Bruce Willis as David Addison. David was a wisecracking detective who may or may not have ever solved a case. Somehow ABC heard this pitch and gave the keys to a network television series, along with a blank checkbook, to Glenn Gordon Caron, whose main credits up to that point were as a supervising producer/writer on Remington Steele and the TV adaptation of Breaking Away. He decided to do a detective series in which the cases wouldn’t be front and center. Instead, it would be an old-fashioned 1940s screwball-comedy love story between the two main characters. Everything old became new again.\n\nThe series premiered on March 3, 1985. It was a midseason replacement, so the first season contained only six episodes. These first episodes were normal detective stories in the sense that there was a mystery and they mostly solved them, but it was the dialogue and chemistry between Maddie and David that sparked viewers’ interest.\n\nThe first-season finale included an average scene for a detective series at that time, but ended up being anything but typical. The detectives went undercover to try to stop an assassination. When David approached the security guard for entry into the party, he said, We’re looking for a man with a mole on his nose. The guard asked, What kind of clothes do I suppose would be worn by a man with a mole on his nose, who knows? David immediately responded, Did I happen to mention, did I bother to disclose, this man that we are seeking with a mole on his nose, I’m not sure of his clothes, or anything else, except he’s Chinese—a big clue by itself. How’d he do that? Maddie and viewers wondered. Gotta read a lot of Dr. Seuss, Addison quipped.¹ That was the kind of banter that Season 1 brought to the small screen. This was revolutionary. Trust me, Jessica Fletcher didn’t rhyme.\n\nIn Season 2, the series became a bona fide hit. It continued with the traditional case format, but started to up the antics in the chase scenes, a staple of detective series in the eighties. On Moonlighting, the criminals and detectives slid across hallways in soapsuds and had a car chase in a hearse, and characters rode around the luggage carousel at an airport. This season contained the Black and White episode, which was introduced by legendary film director Orson Welles. The main characters also started talking to the camera and acknowledging the plot right in the middle of scenes. David and Maddie—not Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd—introduced an episode by reading letters from viewers. They danced with the Temptations in another and apologized for a 3D episode gone awry, all before the opening credits. In 1985, prime-time series were not doing cold opens. They didn’t include scenes during the end credits. Television shows existed only between the credits. There were rules that prime time followed. Well, someone forgot to tell that to the Moonlighting writers. In their Christmas episode, snow started falling inside Maddie and Dave’s office, and Maddie and Dave just walked off the set to be met by the entire production staff and their families singing Christmas carols. This season contained the most scripts the series ever produced in a single season: eighteen. This was back when twenty-two to twenty-four episodes were the norm.\n\nIn Season 3, the series went from hit to pop culture icon. There was nothing in 1986-1987 as hot as Moonlighting. Also, nothing as hard to find. As production problems increased, new episodes became scarcer than sightings of Cybill and Bruce eating together in the 20th Century Fox commissary. Yes, tabloid stories started to spill out from the set that there was trouble behind the scenes. But even while the rumors splashed across the cover of the National Enquirer, the series continued to churn out creative and radically different episodes from week to week. One episode contained a seven-minute dance sequence set to the Billy Joel song Big Man on Mulberry Street. The dance number was directed by Singin’ in the Rain director Stanley Donen. You don’t complete an undertaking like that and stay on an eight-day shooting schedule. So reruns piled up, and so did the bills. As tensions and pressure rose, the series started to focus more on secretary Ms. Agnes Dipesto² (Allyce Beasley) and introduced her love interest, Herbert Viola (Curtis Armstrong). Someone had to fill those fifty minutes with fast-talking dialogue.\n\nThe series even started to make fun of itself. One episode began with Hollywood reporter Rona Barrett declaring, No new episode, AGAIN! It became a mantra for fans who waited patiently from week to week for a fresh episode. Sometimes viewers didn’t find out if the episode was a rerun or an original until they turned on their television set at nine o’clock on Tuesday nights. But that didn’t take any of the shine off the series. ABC, which also owned the series, didn’t contest the missed deadlines or the rising budgets, because the series had such huge ratings that today they would be considered Super Bowl-size ratings. The episode It’s a Wonderful Job had a 26.1 rating and thirty-nine share.³ The biggest price tag came from an episode called \"Atomic Shakespeare,’’ which was written in iambic pentameter and featured Maddie and David in the Middle Ages in an homage to the Shakespeare play The Taming of the Shrew. The episode was an Emmy magnet—director Will Mackenzie and writers Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno were all nominated, and Mackenzie won—so ABC was still all in. Later in the season, Mark Harmon guest starred to stand in between David and Maddie. His four-part arc ended in an episode entitled I Am Curious . . . Maddie, in which Maddie and Dave finally had sex. It became the show’s highest-rated episode (over sixty million viewers)⁴ and had the entire country talking in rhyme . . . for a moment.\n\nWhat happened next? Well, that is the question this book asks. How did a show that was hotter than the Rubik’s Cube or Baby on Board signs get canceled less than two years and twenty-eight episodes after airing its most-watched episode? The media dubbed it the \"Moonlighting Curse.\" The conventional wisdom became that if two main characters from a series got together, the show died. It happened on Moonlighting, so therefore it will happen on The X-Files or Felicity. This is why Castle, Bones, Friends, Downton Abbey, and every show since 1987 delayed, at all logical costs, their main characters getting together. But was this really the cause of the cancellation? I wanted to solve this mystery more than knowing who was the real killer in the Flamingo Cove murder.\n\nIn 1987, I was a huge Moonlighting fan, just like half of America. (It’s true that close to half of all television sets were tuned in to watch I Am Curious . . . Maddie.).⁵ The difference was that I stayed a fan in 1988 and 1989, and still am today. I never believed that it was the consummation that consumed my beloved series. Some of my favorite episodes of the series, Cool Hand Dave, Here’s Living with You, Kid, and A Womb with a View, all aired after this moment and during the final two seasons. Something happened, but what? In the fourth season, the two leads appeared together in the season premiere in September 1987, but didn’t share the screen again until February 1988. Why did the writers choose to do this? Who thought America wanted to watch a romantic comedy without its two leads? Who made this decision, and what factors caused it?\n\nThe only way to get to the bottom of this mystery was to tackle it like it was the Anselmo case (the unsolved case that the Blue Moon detective agency worked on over the final three years of the series). I needed to do a Herbert Viola type of investigation to get to the bottom of this mystery. I just couldn’t stand the idea of reading another article blaming Moonlighting for a television couple not getting together. I wanted to talk to everyone who had worked in front of and behind the camera and get them to tell me exactly what happened thirty years ago. Easy as picking a locked door while doing the Hokey Pokey.\n\nFirst step was to see if anyone had already written that book. A quick search showed that no one in over thirty-five years had ever written a book about Moonlighting. A series this popular and there were NO books on it? That’s strange. Curtis Armstrong, who gleefully played Herbert Viola on the series, wrote the following sentence about this Moonlighting fact in his memoir, Revenge of the Nerd: The low points were so low that it may explain why now, after decades, no one has written the real history of the show.⁶ Well that’s not daunting at all.\n\nI began my investigation with the creator himself. Not God, but Glenn Gordon Caron. I had interviewed him in 2015, for The Red Room Podcast, and hoped he would be open to the idea. He gave me his blessing and an updated interview. Then I approached executive producer Jay Daniel. We spoke weekly for a few months over the summer of 2019. We went through the detailed notes he had kept during the filming of the series. Information and answers that had sat unread for years. I proceeded to talk to directors, writers, cast members, postproduction artists, dancers, editors, and everyone and anyone I could find who had worked on the series. I was lucky enough to get to speak with Allyce Beasley (no, she doesn’t just speak in rhymes). She shared so much of her heart, pain, and love for the series. The writers and I went through their scripts. The directors talked about directing an experienced actress and a future action hero. Curtis Armstrong was so thoughtful and had such respect for the series. He was extremely gracious even if this book would cause his memoir to be forever incorrect. (Curtis, you are still the capo di tutti capi⁷ to me.) Cybill Shepherd was more than excited to help me in any way she could. She decided to rewatch the series and called me after watching an episode. Nothing can give your day a boost like looking at your phone and seeing that Cybill Shepherd is calling you. She was a delight, kind, helpful, and a wonderful asset to the book.\n\nThis book pieces together those interviews into one combined memory to create the story of Moonlighting. We all know that memory is a tricky thing. People will contradict one another, and I allow it. Memory is better than fact anyway, because it’s created by feelings. One of my favorite quotes from Maya Angelou is They may forget what you said—but they will never forget how you made them feel. This book contains what people felt about creating Moonlighting. What is the danger in that? Well, you could start with the fact that the quote isn’t from Maya Angelou; it’s actually from Carl W. Buehner,⁸ but everyone attributes it incorrectly to Angelou because it feels right. So I have dutifully tried to balance memories with facts, all in the context of the era in which the series aired.\n\nMoonlighting originated in the latter half of the 1980s. It would be an understatement to say times have changed since then. In 2021, the times have changed since I started to write this very sentence. The focus of the interviews was to find out what it was like to make groundbreaking television in the 1980s. There was something going on back then that was unwisely called the Battle of the Sexes. This isn’t a history book about that war, but I think we can all agree both sides were losing badly in the eighties. I have no intention of looking at the plots, characters, and behaviors through the lens of 2021. This is not a critical analysis of the series, but a look at the creative process. Everyone would have behaved differently today, because things are different today, and we are all working to be more inclusive and more sensitive. But if we revise history while we cover it, then we can’t learn from it. So all bad behavior from the past should stay there. Everyone had the best of intentions, and no one set out to hurt anyone or make any sweeping statements about the opposite sex. It was, in the end, a comedy show. David Addison wouldn’t get past even the most lax HR representative today. In the eighties he was revolutionary; today he would be the poster child for the cancel-culture revolution. Some walk by day, some fly by night.⁹\n\nMoonlighting: An Oral History is a look at the series through the words of the people who created it, how the series was shaped and cared for and how it finally slipped away from the hearts and minds of the same American audiences who once had catapulted it to the top. I also had no interest in covering gossip or tawdry tales, so readers will have to look elsewhere for those stories. My interest was to find out how a massively successful series could have so many production problems that, as Bill Carter of The New York Times reported, it used more reruns during its four years on the air than any other series.¹⁰ Why? Can the Anselmo case finally be solved? Find out on tonight’s all new episode of Moonlighting.\n\nSo gather the kids, the dog, Grandma, and lock them in another room and sit back and enjoy¹¹ Moonlighting: An Oral History.\n\nIf birds do bird and bees do, in fact, bee, there is a good chance the reason they do it is for Maddie Hayes. Maddie, a former cover-girl model, was what the world in the midst of Ronald Reagan’s America feared most—a beautiful woman with remarkable intelligence. As a spokeswoman for Blue Moon shampoo, Maddie Hayes racked up wealth that would have made Gordon Gekko from Wall Street jealous. She was set to retire from her modeling career when she paid a hefty price for trusting her business manager with access to all of her money. He walked away with everything, and she was left with nothing. Well, almost nothing. She was left with a detective agency that was created for her to lose money, as a tax write-off. (If you ask me, she should have known her business manager was shady when he came up with that idea, but it was the decade of greed.) This is the moment where Moonlighting viewers met Maddie Hayes—broke and at the end of her rope. When she walked into the (then named) City of Angels detective agency, she planned to fire the staff and liquidate the assets, but she didn’t quite expect to run into the likes of David Addison—who ever does?\n\nMaddie Hayes was not what television was used to when it came to female characters. She was extremely complex. She was flawed, emotional, a businesswoman, funny, stunningly beautiful, and the boss. These were the traits that writer Glenn Gordon Caron gave Maddie Hayes. But it was movie star Cybill Shepherd (Taxi Driver, The Last Picture Show) who brought her to life.\n\nIn 2020, Bob Dylan released a song called I Contain Multitudes. I submit he wouldn’t have had the inclination to write this song in the sixties, or the eighties, when Moonlighting aired, because the idea that people were more than one thing wasn’t news. Today, one narrative is all it seems this culture can handle. You’re either with us or against us. Simple. In the midst of the current one-adjective era, Dylan wanted to remind us that people are complex. That we need to hold more than one thought in our minds at the same time—especially when you are viewing human beings. Bob Dylan wasn’t thinking of Maddie Hayes or Cybill Shepherd when he wrote the following lyric, but it does apply: I fuss with my hair and I fight blood feuds. I contain multitudes.¹ Maddie Hayes was a multitude of complexities.\n\nGlenn Gordon Caron (Creator): I was writing the pilot. I think I was half done with it. And it occurred to me that Maddie Hayes was Cybill Shepherd, but I didn’t really think I could get Cybill Shepherd. Very much to my amazement, my agent read it and felt the same way and somehow knew how to make that connection. Jay Daniel and I had lunch with her.\n\nJay Daniel (Executive Producer): We met with Cybill Shepherd at a restaurant called La Serre in Studio City in July of 1984. Cybill was late, which was a very Cybill thing to be. She walked in, all dressed in white, and came over to the table. Of course, we stood. She asked us a question. Glenn’s answer was, Hummina, hummina. He could not get any words out.\n\nGlenn Gordon Caron: To me, Cybill Shepherd was very much a movie star. So the idea of putting food in my mouth while I was in her presence, there just was something wrong about that.\n\nJay Daniel: He was so enamored. And so was I. She was very delightful at that lunch, and we were sold. It didn’t take a whole lot of convincing for the network to say yes. So we had Cybill long before we found David.\n\nGlenn Gordon Caron: Cybill looked at me and said, It’s a Hawksian comedy, isn’t it? I had no idea what a Hawksian comedy was. I had no idea that she was referring to director Howard Hawks.\n\nRoger Director (Writer): Cybill had a longtime relationship and friendship with Peter Bogdanovich [the director of The Last Picture Show and What’s Up, Doc?], so she knew so much about film and knew so much about romantic comedy. So when she walked in to do that part, she was just absolutely perfect for it.\n\nCybill Shepherd (Maddie Hayes): Glenn had fifty pages done. I immediately thought of Howard Hawks comedies. I got to meet Howard Hawks, but never worked with him. Peter was interviewing him for something. We went out to his house in Palm Springs.\n\nGlenn Gordon Caron: She lived for an extended period of time with Peter Bogdanovich, and he would show her classic American films to teach her the history. So she was much more conversant with this stuff than I was. A lot of what I was doing, I was doing out of instinct, not out of any sense of Oh, there’s an old movie style here. She seemed to understand what it was in ways that even I didn’t.\n\nRoger Director: Cybill has been in some of the greatest movies. And when you look at some of the films that she has been in, no one else could have done The Last Picture Show or Heartbreak Kid.\n\nAllan Arkush (Director): I spent a lot of time talking with Cybill about old movies. We had a long discussion about silent Ernst Lubitsch comedies. She admitted to me in those discussions that she was playing Cary Grant. She said, Cary Grant is the greatest reactive actor in the history of movies. There is never one second on the screen where he’s not thinking or reacting. That’s what she tried to do with Maddie, because Maddie doesn’t have the joke lines.\n\nBob Butler (Director): I remember believing that Cybill was certainly the straight man. It wasn’t up to her to be funny. It was up to Bruce to be funny. That was the design. That’s always the situation with the comedy couple, one is straight and one is not.\n\nGlenn Gordon Caron: She had read half the script and said, If the second half is as good as the first half, I’d be interested in doing this. That was a huge thing. I was very excited.\n\nCybill Shepherd: It was very fast-paced. There weren’t any pauses for laughs like in a sitcom. It just moved like wildfire. It reminded me of His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.\n\nAllan Arkush: In a way, Moonlighting is as much reflective of the eighties and a certain kind of feminism as, say, His Girl Friday or The Philadelphia Story are emblematic of the early forties. You kind of synthesize those relationships and these people live in a little fantasy world, as the Moonlighting characters do.\n\nCurtis Armstrong (Herbert Viola): Glenn was playing with Cybill’s persona and bringing as much baggage as he could bring to it. Because if you were of a certain age, Cybill had instant recognition, going back to—really the late sixties, right?—the modeling days. She seemed to be the perfect person to present Maddie Hayes’s character, because everybody at that time had an instinctual knowledge of who she was.\n\nAllyce Beasley (Ms. Dipesto): Maddie was an ex-model who had seen more successful times financially and better times in the limelight. When she takes over the Blue Moon detective agency, she needs that business to survive. Also, she needs that business as her raison d’être, to have something that she could do, to be committed to in the world.\n\nSuzanne Gangursky (Production Coordinator): Maddie definitely had more of the golden ride through life. She became a top model. But when push comes to shove, she’s not going to take crap from anybody. Beneath that beautiful exterior is not an airhead. There’s somebody in there that is sharp and smart and is also nobody’s fool.\n\nRon Osborn (Writer): Maddie was a generally good person with a very type A personality. As worldly as she was, she needed more of the world exposed to her. It isn’t that she was uneducated or unworldly in any way, shape, or form. She was set in her opinions and probably needed some of those opinions broken down. In the David-versus-Maddie opinion, which was the basis for all the show, it isn’t to say that David was always the right one.\n\nReuben Cannon (Casting Agent): You have Maddie, who lived by the rules, who played by the rules, who has realized how limited her life has been, because of perhaps self-imposed guidelines she put on herself.\n\nJeff Reno (Writer): Her veneer was colder, kind of keep her distance, stay at arm’s length from people. She’s also a romantic inside. When the show started she had been horribly wronged by her accountant stealing her money and leaving her this detective agency. She had a lot of adapting to do. She had to find some strength, and she probably had to exercise that strength by being a lot harder and colder."
