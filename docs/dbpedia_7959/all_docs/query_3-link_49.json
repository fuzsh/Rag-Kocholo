        "text": "GLENN GORDON CARON SAYS THAT HALFWAY THOUGH THE pilot of Moonlighting he realized he was writing the character Maddie Hayes as Cybill Shepherd. He asked if there was any way he could get a meeting with me. When my agent sent me those fifty pages, I immediately recognized the part I’d been hankering to do for a long time. For years I’d studied the screwball comedies directed by Howard Hawks, especially Twentieth Century (1934), Bringing Up Baby (1938), and His Girl Friday(1940). These films glorified Carole Lombard, Katharine Hepburn, and Rosalind Russell—they talked fast and acted sexy, smart, and funny.\n\nGlenn was only thirty but no wunderkind. He’d done a couple of failed pilots, and his main credit was for Remington Steele. I was invited to meet him and his colleague Jay Daniel at a restaurant in the San Fernando Valley. Glenn was boyish, charming, portly, clearly excited by the presence of Maddie Hayes incarnate and not afraid to show it--he later said that his negotiating strength had been hampered when his chin hit the table and his tongue hit the floor. He remarked that he’d seen me in a movie wearing “that dress” (the bias-cut satin from The Lady Vanishes). The first thing I said to Glenn after hello was “I know what this is--it’s a Hawksian comedy.” He had no idea what I was talking about, so I suggested we screen my three favorites to see how overlapping dialogue was handled by the “masters,” and he agreed. We talked about the way the Moonlighting script played with my image as a spoiled bitch, although Glenn claimed to have been largely unaware of my reputation as the most clobbered actress in Hollywood.” There wasn’t an actor in the world who hadn’t been in an ill-suited movie, he said. I’d just had more than my share.\n\nCity of Angels is run, none too efficiently, by a character named David Addison, whose creed is “Live fast, die young, leave clean underwear,” and who convinces Maddie to become his partner, renaming the agency Blue Moon after the shampoo for which she was a well-known spokeswoman in her modeling days. Addison is described as an emotional adolescent, cocky and sexually aggressive, whose humor puerile charm ameliorate his obnoxious behavior and language. Apparently there were three thousand men who saw themselves with those attributes because that’s how many actors answered the casting call. Chemistry between actors is either there or it isn’t. I’m not sure you can act chemistry on-screen any more than you can in real life when your well-intentioned cousin sets you up on a blind date with a troglodyte. I thought it was imperative that the chemistry between Maddie and David be genuine, since the show was driven by snappy, overlapping banter and palpable sexual tension. I had casting approval, and when the pile of resumes from David-wannabes was winnowed down to a lean half-dozen, I went to meet them.\n\nABC’s offices were located in a tall glass tower in Century City, and the casting sessions took place in a long conference room with a wall of shuttered windows. Several candidates came and went, but nothing especially magical was happening. By mid-afternoon, I was weary, picking at bits of tuna arid lettuce from the salads that had been brought in for lunch, when Bruce Willis entered the room.\n\nHe was, I would later learn, five years younger than I, wearing an army fatigue jacket, several earrings, and what looked to be the compensatory three-day beard of a man with a receding hairline, the rest of his hair punkishly cut and moussed. There was a careless, desultory way he walked around the perimeter of the big table, keeping his distance from me and sauntering over to Glenn and Jay. His eyes were crinkled and his lips pressed into a mocking smile, a composite that was to become the signature David Addison smirk.\n\nBruce had been earning a living as a bartender in New York, sharing a walk-up in Hell’s Kitchen with large rats while playing mostly uncredited bit parts, like “courtroom observer” in Paul Newman’s legal drama The Verdict or “diner customer” in a Frank Sinatra movie, The First Deadly Sin, and he had just been turned down for a role in Desperately Seeking Susan that went to Aidan Quinn. Unlike the other actors who’d auditioned, he didn’t especially flatter me; in fact, he actually avoided eye contact, directing most of his vaguely smart-ass male-bonding comments to Glenn, like “Just got off my shift at the bar.” But there was definite chemistry between us, and it escaped no one--the temperature in the room jumped about twenty degrees. After he’d left, I leaned over and murmured, as much to myself as to Glenn, “He’s the one.”\n\n“Are you sure?” he responded. Glenn knew it would require Herculean effort to convince the ABC brass that this quirky, attitudinous guy with negligible professional experience and rather unconventional looks was perfectly cast for a prime-time hit on their network, which was then third place in the ratings. The suits saw him playing “heavies,” declared he was “not leading man material” and asked me to read with better-known actors. The part was actually offered to a clean-cut actor named Robert Hayes, who turned it down in favor of I don’t know what. The only way Bruce Willis would be considered was if I agreed to do a screen test with him. With the camera rolling just as we were about to do the scene, he looked at me with perfect satisfaction and said, “I can’t concentrate. You’re too beautiful.” The suits were convinced.\n\nThe week before we shot the pilot, Glenn, Bruce, and I watched His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby, as I had suggested. They were the gold standard for the overlapping dialogue we were going to use in Moonlighting. When we showed up on Stage 20 at 20th Century-Fox for the first time, it felt as if both of us were playing roles that were custom-fit by a meticulous tailor. The first time my face is seen is in a montage of photographs on the wall: real Vogue and Glamor magazines, Cover Girl and Clairol ads fm my modeling days. Maddie Hayes would be the ultimate bitch goddess who gets her comeuppance, with a nemesis who engenders conflicting feelings of outrage and attraction. The character of David Addison was bearable, even likable, precisely because he just loved being a jerk, as, I was to discover, did Bruce Willis.\n\nIn the pilot’s climactic scene, we were being chased by a diamond thief onto the roof of the historic Eastern building in downtown Los Angeles, where I was suspended from the minute hand of a clock face twenty-five feet above the fourteenth floor. I’m a gung-ho girl, and I declared that I wanted to do enough of the stunt so the audience believed it was really me. Half a dozen crew members were lined up single file on the narrow plywood platform of a steel scaffold that was swaying in the Santa Ana winds. The hairdresser was terrified of heights and had declared in the lobby, “I’m going to have to do your hair down here,” but my makeup man, Norman Leavitt, gamely came up to the roof, passing powder puffs and lip stick stuck into a Kleenex box out to me from his precarious perch. The director of photography, Michael Margulies, was communicating via miked headphones to the four camera crews. Suddenly I panicked, and grabbing two handfuls of Michael’s brown leather jacket from behind, I screamed, “I can’t do this! I can’t do this!” But he couldn’t hear me. When he felt the tug, he turned around and said, “Did you say something?”\n\n“No, I’m okay.” And, having momentarily vented, I was.\n\nFor two weeks of shooting, Bruce was upbeat, lighthearted, fun. But it wasn’t long before his mood darkened, particularly during visits from his girlfriend, the former wife of Geraldo Rivera, who sat in the wings with her arms crossed, looking as if she had smelled something bad. (“She disapproves of me doing television,” he confided one day.) Her visits became less frequent, eventually ending altogether, but he remained cranky and aloof. Almost automatically, we had off-camera spats just before our scripted ones, but they seemed like a harmless way of working up to the emotion of the scene. It did not escape me that the growing attraction between Maddie and David mirrored what was developing between the actors who portrayed them. After one particularly heated rehearsal, I walked off the set with him and said, “Are we going to do something about this or what?”\n\nHe looked startled but not unpleasantly so, and then squinted his familiar half smile. “Why don’t I come over to your place tonight?” he said.\n\nThere was a bottle of Gentleman Jim in his hand when he knocked on the door of my apartment, and it wasn’t long before we were passionately sucking face. “Maybe we shouldn’t do this,” I said, feeling ambivalent and aware of the potential complications. “We might be working together a long time.” But we were quickly too far gone in a lusty, missionary embrace, leaning halfway back on a La-Z-Boy lounger that tilted almost to the point of toppling over.\n\nSuddenly he stopped, arched his back, and looked at me with lines creasing his forehead. “Maybe you’re right,” he said, grabbing the wide arm of the chair for support as he pushed off and stood up. Rearranging himself as well as his remaining clothes, he announced, “I think I’ll go to the bathroom.” When he returned, he picked his jacket up from the floor where it had landed, mumbled something about getting a good night’s sleep, and was gone. Maybe Bruce liked the chase better than the catch. Maybe he preferred the character to the real woman. We never did finish what we started in private, but anytime we had a kissing scene, he stuck a big camel tongue halfway down my throat.\n\nFor the pilot of Moonlighting, my hair was sleek and unteased. Before every scene, I’d bend forward and brush it out, but Glenn and Jay said that took too long, so for some of the later episodes, my hair was teased and sprayed into an effusive helmet that looked like a wig. Unsolicited, Bruce commented that my hair was “dippy,” which I assumed to be a derisive colloquialism from his New Jersey boyhood. No one had taken such an interest in my hair since my mother obsessed about my darkening blonde tresses. Certainly L’Oreal thought enough of me for all those commercials in which I purred, “I’m worth it.” And Bruce was on thin ice: his own bare scalp was filled in with greasy dark cosmetic pencils for the camera. After one too many sarcastic remarks, I snapped, “At least I have some hair.” Turns out he did too, just not on his head. Bruce liked to moon the crew, and I got so tired of seeing his hairy ass that I finally said, “Could you give me some warning so I don’t have to look at it every time?”\n\nI averted my eyes from the lively procession of young women in and out of Bruce’s motor home, until he met Demi Moore and settled into some version of monogamy. (I can attest to the fact that she taught him how to kiss.) But I was hardly in a position to judge anyone else’s personal life. A cousin was getting married in Memphis, and I had no prospects of an interesting escort for the wedding. (If the tabloids had only known the headline they were missing: FORMER BEAUTY QUEEN DATELESS.) I asked a friend to set me up with a warm male body, and her suggestion turned out to be a broad-shouldered, six-foot-four cycling champ who’d missed qualifying for the Olympics by a millisecond. He picked me up wearing Clark Kent glasses and a tailored tuxedo jacket over a tartan kilt, complete with sporran, the furry-pouch that substitutes for a pants pocket. (What are men supposed to be carrying around in there anyway?) He had impeccable manners, spoke with ease about a variety of subjects from sports to feminism, and it wasn’t long before I discovered that real Scotsmen don’t wear anything under their kilts. But I was thirty-five and he was eighteen.\n\nIf the ages had been reversed, our romance wouldn’t have caused so much as a ripple of censure. As it was, we were a perfect sexual match. We ignored public opinion and defied our families by continuing to see each other for the duration of my stay and on subsequent visits. When he picked me up at my mother’s house for a bike ride wearing the kind of cyclist shorts that hug the thighs and leave little to the imagination, Mother took me aside and chided, “Cybill, he’s nasty in those pants.” After a few months of long-distance romance, he left his job in the family business and followed me to Los Angeles. He rented his own apartment, but I couldn’t prevent Clementine from developing a five-year-old’s crush on him, getting into my makeup and doing a pretty good imitation of a mini-femme fatale when she knew he was coming over. His affluent father stepped up the campaign to separate us by implying that I was a gold digger, even offering to retire if his son came back to run the company, and finally issued an ultimatum: the business or the blonde. It was up to me to decide my young lover said, and I couldn’t ask him to stay. I didn’t want to get into another situation where I was supporting a man, I had no interest in marriage, I couldn’t even promise fidelity. I suppose I was really waiting for some grand gesture from him, something along the lines of “I don’t care what my family says, you’re the only woman in the world for me.” Asking me what to do was tantamount to telling me he wasn’t ready to commit. I relinquished any hold.\n\nI left home at 5 A.M. each day. Moonlighting scripts were close to a hundred pages, half again as long as the average one-hour television series. Almost from the moment the cameras started rolling, we were behind schedule, sometimes completing as few as sixteen episodes per season and never achieviming ove standard twenty-two. It became customary to make up time with a “tow shot”: loading a car onto a trailer and pulling it. Since we were just sitting in the car, there was no need to rehearse or “block” our places during the scene. We literally cut up the pages of script and taped the scraps to the dashboard--no time to memorize. The only respite was when the writers gave long speeches of “exposition” to guest stars, but Bruce and I were so exhausted that while we listened we often looked as if we were sleeping with our eyes open. Some of our highly touted innovations--like “breaking the fourth wall” and speaking directly to the camera in a prologue or a postscript--were born of necessity, to fill time, since we spoke the dialogue so quickly.\n\nAt $1.5 million per episode, Moonlighting was reportedly the most expensive show on television at the time. But it was one of the first in-house productions at a network, one of the rare hits for ABC (still in third place), and nobody was going to tell Glenn Caron how to run his show. His reputation, an image that he enjoyed and cultivated, was that he thrived on deadlines. In a Time magazine article that called the show “ABC’s classiest hit and biggest headache,” he blustered, “It sounds pompous, but maybe it’s irresponsible to bring a television show in on time and on budget every week and have it be on nothing.” (There was a private joke in an episode that featured a tabloid parody called The National Pit with a headline claiming: “Dr. Caron Discovers Antidote for Stress.”) He often went to the studio before dawn to write a new scene, handing us pages of dialogue when we showed up later that morning. The writing was inspired and edgy, and I’ll take last-minute changes that good any day. But the routine was grueling. We’d start on Monday at 7 A.M. and work until 9 P.M. Union rules stipulated the length of time actors need to break before reporting back to work, and we had to be paid an extra $1,000 if we didn’t get a twelve-hour turnaround--it’s called a “forced call.” To avoid that expensive penalty to the producers, we’d start on Tuesday at 9 A.M. and go until 11 P.M. Then on Wednesday we’d start at 11 A.M. and go until 1 or 2 in the morning. And I’m not a night person. Plus there was a different director every week because the previous week’s director was in the editing room. It took me ten long years to make my comeback and only one to feel trapped by my success.\n\nAs soon as I found out we were to do a mammoth food fight, I went directly to Glenn’s office and asked him if Bruce and I could get hit in the face with pies. Glenn laughed and told me that if I wanted to be hit in the face with a pie I would have to ask Bruce myself, which I did. Bruce chuckled for a minute and then asked, “Who’s going to throw the pie?” I suggested someone neutral like our stunt coordinator, Chris Howel, and Bruce agreed. He and I clocked in a twenty-two-hour day for that food fight with the reward at the end being a refreshing pie in the face, accurately heaved by Chris. It was one of the finest moments for all involved.\n\nBURNOUT IS A GIVEN IN SERIES TELEVISION, BUT IT doesn’t come with a warning label, and my experience is that it doesn’t bring out the best in people. I’d recover a little less each weekend until finally I never recovered, feeling the kind of fatigue that depletes every resource, including civility. Once when we were filming at the Ambassador Hotel, a woman in the lobby approached me for an autograph at just the wrong moment and I snapped. “Leave me alone,” I said dismissively, and when she looked rightfully aghast, I countered, “I have a right to be a bitch.” I really lost it at the end of one fourteen-hour day when I was called down to a basement on the old 20th Century-Fox lot for looping: redoing dialogue that hasn’t been recorded clearly or doesn’t have the right inflection of voice. The sound engineer was late, and I finally said, “Get another sound man.” Then for an hour the bucktoothed associate producer gave me line readings on how to improve my performance (“Do it faster, now do it slower, really be angry, now a little less angry”). It was a manipulative power trip to make me jump through hoops. I was furious, and thrashing my arms in lieu of tearing out my hair, my hand came smashing down on the script stand, sending it crumpling to the floor.\n\nI was almost sleepwalking. Once you reach that level of fatigue, it doesn’t matter how much money you’re making. The whole crew is affected, but they don’t have expectations of physical perfection imposed on them as the on-camera people do, and it’s worse for women. The face that stares back from the mirror at 5 A.M. under that kind of strain is not a pretty sight. I developed the clenched look of a soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder. But I was held to a much more stringent standard of beauty than Bruce, with two or three hours in hair and makeup every day compared to his fifteen minutes. I was blamed if I looked exhausted, whereas squinty eyes and a two-day stubble only added to David Addison’s rakish allure. I insisted on wearing outfits with cinched waists: I have an old-fashioned hourglass figure, with broad shoulders and a big butt, and if my waist isn’t accentuated, I tend to look like a Green Bay Packer. Our characters often wore sunglasses to look cool--a special design with flat rather than curved lenses that didn’t reflect the set lights--that had the added benefit of covering dark circles. Gerald Finnerman, the director of photograph., very kindly had a special sliding filter made for the lens of the camera, so when it panned from Bruce to me, the heavier diffusion was slid into place to make me look “prettier.”\n\nAngela Lansbury, my esteemed colleague from The Lady Vanishes, was starring in Murder, She Wrote, and I asked her to dinner, seeking wise counsel from someone with a similar daily grind. “There’s no way to survive an hour television format unless there are some ground rules,” she said. “I come in at six A.M. and I leave at six P.M. Period. And I never start the season with fewer than eight scripts.” But when I went to Glenn with this supplication, he just laughed.\n\n“You might as well forget that,” he said, “because it’ll never happen.”\n\nAt the beginning of our second season, Orson Welles agreed to introduce an episode called “‘The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice”—an astonishing favor to me, rarer than a returned phone call in Hollywood. Standing on a set rigged to look like his office, he cautioned viewers not to be alarmed (an homage to his 1938 Mercury Theater broadcast of The War of the Worlds when, as a Halloween prank, he described a Martian invasion so vividly that thousands of listeners panicked). Approximately twelve minutes later, he explained, the picture would change from color to black and white. I was working at another location the day the scene was shot, and I kept thinking: I have to go see Orson, but I waited too long, eerily like Marlene Dietrich’s character in Orson’s classic film Touch of Evil: Marlene runs after Orson to say good-bye but arrives too late and finds him floating face up, dead in the water. Two weeks after he did his Moonlighting bit, Orson died in his own office, slumped over a typewriter, and was buried in a Spanish bullfighters’ graveyard. The episode, which was dedicated to him, unfolded from conflicting points of view like Rashomon (also reflecting what was happening on the set), switching between bad-David-good-Maddie and good-David-bad-Maddie, giving Bruce vintage ribald innuendo (“We would see more of each other, then all of each other”) and me variations on Mae West’s signature “When I’m good, I’m good, but when I’m bad, I’m better.”\n\nAfter a long professional drought, I reveled in the reviews and ratings for Moonlighting, lapping up my new designation as “TV’s sexiest spitfire” in an “ouch-she’s-hot comeback.” (Perhaps most satisfying was Peter’s report of a call from Cary Grant saying, “You were right about her all along.”) But our first year on the air, the Emmy nominating committee lumped the show into the comedy category with sitcoms, which are, by definition, joke-driven. The competition was Family Ties, Cheers, Kate & Allie, Night Court, and The Cosby Show (which won). Moonlighting didn’t get any nominations until 1986, when we were reclassified as a drama, “leading the pack” with sixteen nominations. It was a huge disappointment that we only won one--for editing.\n\nYou can get pushed over the edge of exhaustion on a crappy job too, but when the material is good and the people are passionate about it, everyone tends to be in even more denial, making excuses for their bad behavior. You tell yourself: This is so clever, so classy, so valuable, that it’s worth the sacrifice, and meanwhile a little voice inside your head is screaming for sleep, sanity, salvation. In scientific studies, too many rats in a cage will attack and eat one another alive, even if they have enough food. It’s an apt metaphor for the Moonlighting set, and we were all under pressure. Bruce Willis had never experienced anything close to this kind of success, and his reaction to it exacerbated the situation. The man whose high school yearbook recorded that his ambition was “to become deliriously happy, or a professional harp player was suddenly rich beyond imagination. He bought a black Mercedes and a 1966 Corvette. I understood the heady mix of fame, money, groupies, and feel-good treats. I’d already been there and back, but Bruce was on his maiden voyage. The first time I experienced sudden success, I had my insufferable moments too.\n\nThere was a real cultural difference between a guy from “Joisey” and a girl from Memphis. In the South, what is considered acceptable behavior has at least a patina of courtesy and formality. That kind of ingrained etiquette has both positive and negative aspects: you may not know what someone really thinks of you and there’s a lot of “Honey child this” and “Darlin’ that” covering up savage feelings, but on the surface it’s Sunday school gracious. The roots of my steel-magnolia temperament run deep, and I always try to alleviate tension with humor. I had my fan photo made into a dartboard and sent one to Bruce and one to Glenn, complete with darts and a poem: “I’m giving you my picture, I hope you’ll treat it nice, you can hang it in the attic to scare away mice.”\n\nI indulged in regular therapeutic massage to help cope with the stress of the shooting schedule, during which I could feel body and soul coming back together. One day my masseuse opened her big canvas bag and pulled out a tape called Woman’s Spirit, a guided meditation with one’s female ancestors. Lying on the backseat of my limousine on the way to the studio, I would listen to the tape and imagine myself in a field, holding my mother’s hand, who was holding her mother’s hand, who was holding her mother’s and going back to a time of safety and peace. I was searching for a spiritual anchor, I needed to make God a holy and forgiving mother.\n\nDespite massage, I developed debilitating headaches and a back stiff enough to build condominiums. A friend recommended a chiropractor who was known to make house calls and “set calls” for actors. When Bruce Oppenheim came to treat me during a late shoot, it was close to midnight and there was hardly room for his table in my trailer. I’d never had chiropractic work, but he had such strong hands and worked so quickly that I didn’t have time to get nervous. The disappearance of my headaches made me an instant believer, and his twisted sense of humor made me laugh. I started having “adjustments” about once a month, and with my skewed sense of boundaries, it didn’t seem to matter if I was dating a health-care professional who was treating me. He didn’t seem to be troubled by it either.\n\nWith the first serious money of my life, I bought a house at the end of a cul-de-sac in the Encino hills, framed by two stone lions. I removed the previous owner’s expensive bad taste, and replaced it with my own expensive bad taste. Mother always said, “All your taste is in your mouth, girl.” Behind sliding glass doors was a pool lined with small gold tiles that made me feel like I was swimming in liquid gold. Bruce brought me tea and melon in bed at the crack of dawn, then biked with me a dozen miles to the studio. Right before we left, I’d have a can of Mountain Dew plus a cup of coffee, so I felt like I had been shot out of a cannon. A teamster would drive me and the bike back at the end of the day, and Bruce often cooked dinner while I spent a little time with my daughter. He let me know that he’d never really considered having children of his own, but his relationship with seven-year-old Clementine was warm and affectionate. We already felt like a family.\n\nEven though I was bone weary, I well knew the lesson about striking while the iron was hot--and I had lived through some cool-iron times--so I spent a springtime hiatus from Moonlighting doing a television remake of The Long Hot Summer, based on a short story called “‘The Hamlet” by William Faulkner. I wanted to play the role originated by Joanne Woodward but was pronounced “too pretty” (although hardly prettier than Don Johnson, the hot star of Miami Vice, who was playing the Paul Newman role). Such distinctions seemed unfathomable anyway when they gave the part to Judith Ivey, a lovely-looking actress who was deemed more serious, after making her do four screen tests and telling her she wasn’t pretty enough. I was cast as the libidinous daughter-in-law originally played by Lee Remick.\n\nThe opulent homestead of the fictitious Varner family in “Frenchman’s Bend, Mississippi” was replicated by the Oak Alley Plantation in Thibodaux, Louisiana. It had an unpaved road lined by stately two-hundred-year-old live oaks draped with Spanish moss, leading up to the white-columned mansion. Its several caretaker cabins with screened porches had been converted to guest houses. A high levee with a gravel road on top separated the house and the river, and I walked there every chance I got.\n\nOn a job with such a large ensemble cast, there’s lots of time to sit around, which means more time to read. One afternoon while waiting on the screen porch of one of the converted caretakers’ cabins, the book I chose would have an enormous impact on the direction of my life. It was Outrageous Acts & Everyday Rebellion by Gloria Steinem. Although I had called myself a feminist for fifteen years, I realized I had not committed a single Outrageous Act in any public way to support women’s reproductive freedom or any other civil rights issue. It was also around this time I became aware that Congress had disallowed funding for abortions for poor women. Pregnancy as punishment because you’re poor? It was one of those big moments in life when you say, “Hold on a minute missy, that ain’t right!” Determined finally to become part of the solution, I called Ms. magazine and asked to speak to Gloria Steinem, the magazine’s founder, whom I had met briefly at a party in Manhattan a few years earlier. She took my call immediately and without wasting time. I asked what I could do to help the cause.\n\nThere’s a political action committee I’m involved with called Voters for Choice, she began. “They’re in need of a strong morally committed spokesperson. Would you consider that?”\n\n“Yes,” I said without hesitation. I was finally on my way toward exorcising the demon of political inaction and apathy that had been brewing since my childhood when I had been surrounded by the racism of the segregated south. But once I started speaking out there was no stopping me. I marched on Washington for reproductive freedom and women’s equality, I spoke at fund-raisers for pro-choice candidates like Ann Richards (governor of Texas), Barbara Boxer (senator from California), and Bill Clinton (president of the United States of America). I marched again on Washington for gay and lesbian rights, I helped dedicate the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, and was called to testify before a House subcommittee on the U.S. approval for RU-486. To this day, I believe that any excuse to discriminate against any group of human beings violates their civil rights. Regardless of their skin color, religion, sex, or sexual preference, all people must be treated equally. To do otherwise is un-American. Because of my advocacy for these basic civil rights, Gloria Allred, my longtime friend and fighter for feminist issues, asked me to seriously consider running for president of the United States in the year 2000.\n\nBut let’s go back to the fun and games on the set of The Long Hot Summer. Don Johnson and I were aware of an intense attraction the minute we met. When ten journalists arrived for a press junket wanting to photograph the steamy scenes between us, they were astonished to hear that in the four-hour miniseries, there were none. I told the director and the producer, both separately and together, “You’re crazy if you don’t write at least one scene for Don and me.” Unfortunately, it was assumed that I was trying to pad my part. Just because we were forbidden to explore our flirtation on-screen didn’t mean we couldn’t follow up on it in private. One night, as I relaxed on the screen porch of my little cabin, I heard a man’s voice purr, “Ohhh, Miss Eula” (my character’s name).\n\nI responded, “Why, Mr. Ben Quick” (Don’s character’s name). “What are you doing here?”\n\n“I’d just like to pay my respects, ma’am.”\n\nI opened the screen door a wedge. ‘’Why don’t you come on in and sit a spell.”\n\nWe lasted a nanosecond on the porch and then rapidly progressed to my bed. It was like wolfing down a candy bar when you’re starving--fast, furious, intense--and it was all over in five minutes. Somehow we never got around to another five minutes, since “Mr. Quick” moved on to one of the hairdressers, who thereafter acted as if I had bad breath.\n\nThe gracious and genial Jason Robards, who was playing the family patriarch, was well loved by the crew, but Don was not a favorite. He told too many of them too often how they could do their jobs better. A palpable tension seemed to arise when he walked on the set and disappeared when he left. Everyone was in awe of Ava Gardner, who was playing the mistress of the domineering Will Varner. We hadn’t done our one scene together yet and nobody, had bothered to introduce us. One night while we were shooting out in the middle of a swamp, the air-conditioning in my tiny trailer kept breaking down, and I decided to walk over to her trailer to say hi and introduce myself, I had just raised my hand to knock when the door flew open and slammed against the side of her trailer. Fortunately, I had leaped back into the darkness in the nick of time. I froze and watched, unseen in the shadows. Her hair was in rollers, and she was swaying, holding a bottle of white wine by the neck. Suddenly, she began screaming, “JASONNNNNNNNN!” I hightailed it out of there, but later that five mithe crew was setting up the dramatic fire finale and we were taking our places, I dared to approach her again.\n\n“Ms. Gardner, I am thrilled to be working with you.” It took her a while to focus on me. Then she belched out a slurpy, “SHADDDUPP!”\n\nThe next day around the motel pool, she seemed alert and agreeable, throwing her glorious neck back with a rich and lustful laugh I. took one more risk. “Ms. Gardner,” I said, extending a tentative handshake, “I’m Cybill Shepherd.”\n\n“Oh, hello!” She beamed, flashing that profoundly sexy Ava Gardner smile. “It’s so nice to meet you.” The previous night had never happened.\n\nAlmost immediately I could tell that The Long Hot Summer was going to be a stinker. In one scene I actually begged not to have a close-up, and they agreed. The miniseries was so bad it was appropriately dismissed as “irredeemable, paltry and barren” by the Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales, who noted of my performance, “She seems playfully aware that the movie is garbage.” It was shown on CBS opposite Moonlighting. Moonlighting won the time slot.\n\nIN JANUARY 1987 I WAS GETTING DRESSED FOR THE Golden Globe Awards, and my dress didn’t fit. There was no mistaking the reason. The stomach pooches out more quickly in a second pregnancy because the muscles have been pregnant before. By the time I scheduled a doctor’s appointment, a test was a formality--I was so violently nauseated I couldn’t eat.\n\nWhen the obstetrician got the results back from the lab, she called me. “Either you’re further along in your pregnancy than you thought,” she said, “or you’re having twins.”\n\nI dismissed this possibility, even though my grandmother’s sister and their grandmother had had twins.\n\nIt was recommended that I see a specialist for an early ultrasound. Two hours before the time of my appointment I was supposed to drink eight glasses of water (a full bladder lifts the uterus into a good position for a sonogram). I forgot and didn’t start chugging on a big bottle of water until I was in the car on the way to the appointment, so when the doctor moved the probe over my abdomen, his face registered concern: he saw two amniotic sacs but he could detect only one heartbeat. I tried not to panic as I lay on the table in an ungainly position, pushing images of dead babies out of my head, while we waited for the water to do its thing. When the doctor came back to make another pass, his face brightened. A second heart was beating in syncopated rhythm with its sibling.\n\nWhen I called Bruce at his office, I started with, “Honey, I want you to sit down.”\n\n“Why?” he said.\n\n“Just do it,” I insisted. “We’re having twins.” There was no response at first, then a slow “Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-”\n\n“It could be worse,” I interrupted. “It could be triplets.”\n\nA twin pregnancy is considered high risk for any woman, let alone one closing in on forty, and I had to see three different OB-GYNs before I found one who didn’t make me feel doomed, reading me a riot act list of all the horrible things that could happen. I called Peg Burke, one of the midwives who had attended Clementine’s birth eight years earlier.\n\n“The rate of cesareans in Southern California is twenty-five percent,” she said sympathetically. “Lotsa luck.”\n\n“There’s got to be one doctor in Los Angeles who’ll give me a chance for a natural delivery,” I said. “Isn’t there a nurse-midwife I can call?”\n\nShe suggested Nancy Boles, head of the midwifery program at the University of Southern California Medical School. I told her I understood that I needed to have a doctor present, but I wanted the same kind of midwife ntment rt I’d had when my first child was born.\n\n“Yeah, I know,” she said, the voice of resignation, “even though I’ve delivered two thousand sets of twins myself.” I asked her to recommended a doctor, and she mentioned Jeffrey Phelan, who had recently published an article about a technique called “version,” in which the doctor turns the unborn child into the proper position for birth. He had won Nancy’s heart when she heard that he made his male medical students get up in the stirrups to see how their female patients felt during a pelvic exam.\n\nPeople can be really dumb about a twin pregnancy. No woman who’s given birth would ever say chirpily, “That’s the way to do it: get it over with all at once.” Dr. Phelan had a more experienced take. “I wish twin pregnancies on my enemies,” he told me sympathetically, acknowledging the difficulty of dealing with twice the hormones, twice the heartburn, twice the discomfort, twice the nausea, twice the risk. I was not going to be a radiant bride.\n\nI have a photograph of my mother and stepfather, Mondo (they had married eight years earlier), holding a shotgun at my wedding to Bruce, who made a happy adjustment in his thinking about parenthood. A rabbi pronounced us man and wife in the shortest ceremony possible that was still legal. My gown was an antique ceremonial silk kimono, cream-colored with gold and orange fans. It was a wedding gift from my friend Kaori Turner (her mother had worn it), who also procured a black kimono for Bruce and a pink one for Clementine. The dining room of our house had been made into a Japanese tearoom, with rice-paper walls and tatami flooring. No shoes, which have always seemed a form of bondage to me, and no rings--I’ve never been big on jewelry.\n\nHelicopters were circling over the house, trying to get a shot of us or celebrity guests. (There were none, just twenty close friends. My father couldn’t be in the same room as my mother, my sister didn’t want to travel, and my brother and I weren’t talking to each other because we had a dispute about money. The photo exclusive went to David Hume Kennerly, who was one of Bruce’s friends and had won a Pulitzer for his Vietnam War coverage and had been the White House photographer during the Ford administration. A tiered white cake with a porcelain bride and groom and two baby carriages followed a steak dinner--ironic, since I had been fired as a spokesperson for the Beef Council because a journalist wrote that I was trying to eat less red meat. My mother, who knew me to lick the steak platter before I washed it, had exclaimed. “Are they crazy?” and threatened to write the council a letter. But my attorney later told me that the real reason was because I was pregnant before I was married, a highly publicized fact.) I was asleep by seven o’clock. The next morning, I reported back to the set, and Bruce went into his office, working underneath an eight-by-ten glossy of me from my days as his patient, inscribed, “Dear Bruce, I’ve seldom had such a laying on of hands. Love and thanks, Cybill.”\n\nMy pregnancy further widened the chasm between me and the producers, who reacted as if the news was a thoughtless inconvenience. Other television actresses had been allowed to work real-life pregnancies into plotlines and production schedules. When I suggested a similar approach to Glenn Caron, his response was a tepid, “Well, you don’t leave me much choice.” Despite the fact that I developed gestational diabetes and was forbidden to work during my last trimester, I occasionally went to the studio against doctor’s orders. But Glenn continued to act as if I were personally, purposefully screwing him over (and would later claim that my pregnancy had destroyed Moonlighting). He attempted to accommodate the situation by having Maddie meet a short, stocky man on a train and marry him three days later. When I strongly voicd my objection that the character we had created in Maddie would never do such a thing, Glenn said words to the effect of “Just shut up and do your job, you’re not producing this show.”\n\nI had doctor appointments every few days to ensure that the twins, whose welfare was compromised by the diabetes, were healthy and developing on schedule.\n\nEight-year-old Clementine, who had been begging for siblings, announced that she wanted to be present for their arrival. My midwife put together a slide show of some of her other births to prepare Clem for the noises Mommy would make, the presence of blood, and the fact that I would be in pain. After only two slides, Clementine put up her hand and said, “I don’t want to see anymore, Mommy. Just call me when the babies are cleaned up.’’\n\nSoon thereafter, she announced, “I’ve changed my mind. I’ve decided I don’t really want a brother and sister.”\n\n“Well, what should we do when they’re born?” I asked calmly. “Should we throw them out the window?”\n\nShe frowned. “Nobody ever asked me about this, you know,” she said.\n\nA few weeks later, she came to me with a proud plan. “When we get home from the hospital,” she said brightly, “I’d like to put the babies in the washing machine.”\n\n“Really, honey?” I asked. “Why?”\n\n“Because,” she said, “I’d like to see them go around and around and around.”\n\nBy my third trimester, I was so huge I began to resemble Marlon Brando. I could no longer get up off my futon on the floor, so I had a large platform built at the height of a normal bed. I still had to crawl to the edge and then push myself up. One early morning, I was awakened by an earthquake and in terror I stood straight up and jumped off the platform, running to see if Clementine was okay. She was, but my groin was not. I felt like I was walking around carrying two bowling balls between my legs. Every night I prayed, “Please God, let me get over this pain before I go into labor.”\n\nA few weeks before my October due date, Mother and Mondo drove out to California in a motor home. Every night, we’d sit in the yard taking a moon bath, soaking up the beams and watching the waxing crescent get fatter and brighter. The moon affects all bodies of water, I figured, and my babies were floating in their own private pool. On October 6, 1987, the moon went full at 12:03 A.M. My water broke at 12:08. I listened to a tape of Kathleen Battle singing “Ave Maria” as Mother, Mondo, Bruce, and I drove to the brand-new California Medical Center downtown..\n\nMolly Ariel and Cyrus Zachariah were born thirteen hours later, both named for their great-grandparents but known by their middle names, with a hyphenated Shepherd-Oppenheim. But those thirteen hours were harrowing.\n\nIn transit down the birth canal, Ariel had pushed Zach out of the way (a very determined female from the get-go), and he turned sideways. Something, probably his foot, lodged up under my ribs and felt like it was pulling me apart one bone at a time. At this point, I began begging for drugs and screaming, “Kill me! Kill me! Cut the babies out!” A few moments later, and before any drugs could be given, Ariel was born (five pounds, eleven ounces) followed by Zachariah (seven pounds, two ounces).\n\nMy entourage took over almost a whole floor of the hospital—Bruce, Mother, Mondo, Clementine, Myrtle, the midwife, three nurses, and a bodyguard. (I had forgotten to include the doctor’s name on a list of people to be allowed admittance, and he had trouble getting in to see me.) I guess this was the most famous I’ve ever been. There were two photos on the front page of the New York Daily News, accompanying the headline: “ROBERT BORK LOSES/CYBILL’S TWINS DOING GREAT.” This was great news all around. Not only were he twins healthy and happy, but the anti-choice Supreme Court nominee had been defeated. The paparazzi had been waiting at the front door of the hospital since before the babies were born, and everyday the guard caught someone who managed to sneak through with a camera. I knew that the best way to get photographers to stop swarming around me was not to try to run from them, but Bruce was afraid of flashes going off in the sensitive eyes of our newborns. We arranged for his brother to leave the hospital with a nurse in a blond wig, holding two Cabbage Patch dolls, while we attempted a more private exit out back. No one was fooled, and Bruce and I almost crashed into a lamppost when one photographer jumped on the hood of our car--a small risk, he probably considered, since photos of the babies were said to fetch up to $100,000.\n\nGoing from one to three children felt like going from one to ten; the effort and responsibility involved in parenthood increases exponentially. Before going back to work, I bought a forty-foot motor home, with plenty of room for the twins and their paraphernalia, including Bruce Willis’ gift of a teeter-totter and Glenn Caron’s two giant pandas. Beloved Myrtle kept insisting that she could handle the nannying single-handedly (she’d had thirteen children herself), but I didn’t want to put that much of a burden on her, and finding capable, trustworthy people for child care is the challenge of every working mother. I hired one woman who seemed to have impeccable credentials, only to discover that she kept a bottle of rum in her purse. Another simply disappeared and was apprehended a few weeks later in Scottsdale, Arizona, wandering nude with pictures of Ariel and Zack in her hand, saying she was looking for her babies.\n\nTHE YEAR 1988 BEGAN PROPITIOUSLY WITH A ceremony in which I was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and it only cost me $4,322. Bruce Willis sent a telegram saying, “Sorry I can’t be there, but one of us has to work.” During this season of Moonlighting my dissatisfaction grew with the inimical atmosphere and changes in the way my character was written. Not only was she a virago, but she was starting to act bipolar. In an episode called “Yours Very Deadly,” Maddie urges a female client to continue a correspondence with someone who has been sending the woman threatening letters. Maddie actually goes to this man’s apartment, unarmed, pounding on the door, even though she knows him to be deaf and believes him to be a murderer. “No sane person would encourage a woman to engage with a harasser,” I told Glenn, “and people who have experienced some fame are particularly sensitive to the dangers. I know that, and as a former model, Maddie Hayes would know it too.” But Glenn was adamant that we keep to the story, and I gave it my best shot: the character acts bipolar, but with conviction. The next episode, “All Creatures Great and Small,” dropped the little bomb that Maddie is an atheist. So. not only is she a cold bitch but she doesn’t believe in God. My character could go no lower: a feminist atheist.\n\nOr so I thought. When Glenn came to talk to me about his idea for an episode called “Atomic Shakespeare” that would satirize The Taming of the Shrew, my first question was “Who’s going to play the shrew?” I was serious when I suggested some contemporary gender bending, making David Addison the termagant. Glenn was not amused. When I read the script, I found that my Elizabethan character was to be bound, gagged, and married off against her will while a whole town cheered, as part of her husband’s bet with her father. Kate aka Maddie aka Cybill was made to be an impossibly unsympathetic character so that Petruchio aka David aka Bruce could score. I was certainly aware that Moonlighting was entertainment, not a political treatise, as I was aware that some women are aroused by bondage is shedie was definitely not turned on. In this case, binding and gagging was a symbol of violence against women--even Shakespeare didn’t tame his shrew with ropes.\n\n“Atomic Shakespeare” won more awards than any other episode, including Emmys for directing, editing, and costume design. I wore a sleeveless black velvet evening gown and Day-Glo orange high-tops to the ceremony, fully intending to change into pumps. It’s a long ride to the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, and I had time to consider the prospect of an evening in pain. As my limousine pulled up to the curb, the driver said, “I’ll wait for you to change your shoes.”\n\n“You can open the door now,” I said. “I’m ready.” I knew what I was doing--it was my personal rebellion against the tyranny of high heels--but people reacted as if I were naked. Actually, I felt that half the women there were cheering “Right on, sister,” and half were muttering “You bitch.” To this day, people are always checking out what I’ve got on my feet and seem disappointed if I’m in anything fancier than sneakers.\n\nBruce Willis was nominated again that year, but I was not. I went to the ceremony thinking: I’ll be okay as long as he doesn’t win. (Nice team spirit.) He won. I smiled and applauded. I understand that many actors have done good work for years and not gotten awards for it, but this felt like a slap in the face, as if he were the motor that drove the show, as if I were dispensable.\n\nIn the episode “Big Man on Mulberry Street,” when David Addison’s former brother-in-law dies, he goes to New York, and Maddie, in a show of support, crashes the funeral. In a moving scene, David recalls marrying his pregnant girlfriend and hoping that he won’t end up in a blue Sunoco uniform with DAVE stitched over the pocket, then trying to keep the marriage going after his wife miscarries, only to come home one day to find the census taker on top of her, “getting all kinds of pertinent information that isn’t on the form.” When David’s ex-wife admits that this infidelity was not with another man but with a woman, Maddie’s reaction to this jaw-dropping news was cut. Even if the intent was to showcase Bruce, it would not have lessened the impact of his performance to see Maddie’s reaction, and it hurt my character because it didn’t show her humanity. The mutual sovereignty of the characters, the conflict between fully realized equals, was compromised. When I registered my complaint, Glenn told me I hadn’t played the scene very well. The unspoken message was that I was a bitch; the salt in the wound was the news that I was a bad actress.\n\n“Big Man on Mulberry Street” also had a musical number beautifully choreographed by Stanley Donen, the legendary director of Singing in the Rain, with a soundtrack by Billy Joel. It was supposed to be Maddie’s dream, but to me it looked a lot more like David’s fantasy. Glenn said that he wasn’t interested in my opinion, and when I approached Donen with my reservations, I saw him go absolutely cold, almost as if he’d been prepared for my being impossible. As I left the set after a rehearsal, I was so frustrated that I picked up a director’s chair and threw it at the wall. The tabloids reported that I had heaved the chair at Glenn. (If I had wanted to hit him, I wouldn’t have missed.)\n\nThe distinctive door slamming that became a leitmotif of the show was something I learned from Ernst Lubitsch movies, and studio carpenters had to rebuild the Blue Moon Agency doors every season because we slammed them so hard. But one of my most painful memories revolved around the door slamming in “Symphony in Knocked Flat.” The script called for Maddie to arrive at work and slam her way through the office in a rage because she had a boring date the night before. I didn’t think that a boring dt befohe night before was enough motivation for a hysterical tirade, and I ignored the stage direction, playing the scene more thoughtfully. I got away with it that time, but my next scene that required rage brought Glenn and Jay down to the set. We did it over and over, each time Glenn repeating, “That’s not angry enough. Do it again.” I felt so humiliated and upset that I began forgetting the lines I had known perfectly well when we started.\n\nI watched the “Symphony” episode again recently and came away proud that I had followed my instincts and underplayed those two scenes. Though I still cringe at the thought of Glenn’s and Jay’s bullying, I’m so glad I defended the integrity of my character, Maddie, in the face of public embarrassment. That episode represents truly wonderful work on everyone’s part. And besides, how many people get to work with The Temptations and perform “Psychedelic Shack,” like I did in the prologue to that episode?\n\nBruce became disenchanted with the classic David Addison smarminess, sometimes throwing a script across the room and calling it shit. Actors make a mistake when they act superior to the material. Good acting is like a tennis match. But somewhere along the way it felt like Bruce disconnected from what I was doing. It seemed as if he had already figured out all the moves, and it was far less exciting when the match between us was over.\n\nOne April day in 1988, I arrived for work fifteen minutes late to find an all points bulletin out for me. An assistant director approached my car as I drove onto the lot and said, “Cybill, don’t bother getting out.” Then he told the driver, “Take her right to Glenn’s office.” I felt like an intractable student summoned to the principal after sliding down the school banister--a bad acid flashback, and I’d never even taken acid. Jay Daniel and several people I didn’t recognize were sitting in Glenn’s office; Glenn was standing in front of his pinball machine and his jukebox loaded with 1960s rock and roll and every song by Tammy Wynette.\n\n“You don’t give a fuck about your work,” he screamed the moment I walked in the door. “Your standards are down, and your ideas are crap.” I could hardly respond, his rage was so vehement. And while he screamed, Jay sat silent, not uttering a word in my defense.\n\nA few weeks later, when we came to the end of the shooting season, I wrote Glenn a letter. “I want to do everything in my control to help the show,” I wrote. “But I need you to know that for me to work effectively, it is absolutely necessary to avoid another performance like the one you gave when I was summoned to your office several weeks ago to hear your diatribe--all in the presence of complete strangers. I have enormous respect for the work you have done and for the show you have created, but I do not respect that behavior and I will not willingly be subjected to the kind of abuse that you unleashed at that meeting. I take my share of responsibility for some of the problems we have had in the past and will do everything I can to correct those problems.”\n\nDuring the hiatus I made a film called Chances Are, a fantasy about a woman who remains devoted to the memory of her dead husband and falls in love with him again, reincarnated in the form of Robert Downey Jr. The producer was a pal of Ryan O’Neal and lobbied for him to play the family friend who’s really been in love with my character all along. Considering our history, Ryan was the last person I wanted to work with. “Casting him is a great way to ruin this movie,” I warned. But everybody else kept turning down the role, so we got him by default. (Turned out I was wrong. He was terrific.) I had avoided a love scene with him in real life, but I couldn’t stop my nervous laughter when I had to kiss him on-camera. The director, Emile Ardolino, took me aside and whispered, &lquo;Could you please stop giggling? It’s upsetting Ryan.” Not an unreasonable request, and I stopped laughing by thinking of deaths in the family and biting my upper lip.\n\nI thought the script would have been improved by dispensing with the reincarnation storyline and exploring a romance seldom seen on film between an older woman and a younger man, a relationship I’ve often played out in real life. The first day of rehearsal, Downey didn’t show up or respond to phone calls. Somebody from the production office got the manager of his hotel to open the door of his room and found him in bed with a woman, sleeping off a bad night. It was apparent that he had substance abuse problems, and he was told that if he was ever late again, he would be fired. A monitor in the guise of a “trainer” was hired to keep him out of trouble for the remainder of the shooting schedule. I relished the experience of working with Emile Ardolino. As a director he pushed me beyond what I had thought of as my “dramatic limits” as an actor. Some years later, Emile stopped returning my phone calls. This is a common occurrence in Hollywood but hardly what I would have expected from Emile. About six months later, a mutual friend called and told me the sad truth: “Emile died of AIDS today.” Now, whenever I cry as an actor part of my motivation is always the thought of Emile and missing him.\n\nWhen production started on the new season of Moonlighting, I received a “personal and confidential” letter from the lawyers for Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., as did Bruce Willis. Attached was a list of “guidelines” regarding production, stating the network’s right to cancel episodes or the series if the guidelines were not strictly followed. (Bruce and I would be responsible for the loss of revenue in such an event.) The normal day onstage, the memo stated, was from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M., but night work was at the producer’s discretion. The production company would make every effort to deliver scripts one day in advance of shooting, but the script was nevertheless to be learned. The producers were to maintain a written record of the actors’ work pattern during each day of production, including the time elapsed after being called to the set, which was not to exceed five minutes. Bathroom breaks were also limited to five minutes.\n\nMy lawyer responded to this demeaning memo by reminding ABC that I already had a contract governing my services; that nowhere in my agreement was the network given the right to impose additional terms and conditions, particularly those more suitable to a reform school; that I resented any attempt to impute to me responsibility for their cost overruns; and that such insinuations were defamatory, injurious to my reputation, and the cause of severe emotional distress.\n\nOne more letter arrived from ABC. Dispensing with the legalese, the gist of it was “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” And with such posturing, the tempest was over.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, Glenn Caron left the show, stating that it was him or me and he didn’t think the network would choose him. What had begun as an alliance between Glenn and me, as well as a newcomer named Bruce Willis, had turned into Glenn and Bruce against Cybill. Not only David Addison but Bruce Willis had become Glenn’s alter ego and I became the troublemaker, the difficult one out to get them (whatever part I had in creating this I will forever regret). Recently, the pilot of Moonlighting was released on DVD. The disc includes almost nonstop commentary on the making of the series by the creator, Glenn Caron, and the star, Bruce Willis. Needless to say, I was not thrilled to be excluded, but now there can be no doubt that there had been and still is a boys’ club to which I’m not invited. Glenn describes himself and Bruce as being virtually the same. They have similar backgrounds, the same things disgust them, and the same things make them laugh. The only ng that really matters is that a whole new audience is enjoying Moonlighting on DVD as well as nightly on the Bravo network. And I’m really proud of the good work we did together. In any case, Jay Daniel took over as executive producer, and Roger Director, already working on the show as promoted to head writer. (He later wrote the roman a clef A Place to Fall, about a neurotic, petulant actor, and Bruce Willis threatened to punch him out.) The show lasted for two more years, and Peter Bogdanovich made a memorable guest appearance in an episode about all the men in Maddie’s past. But with the success of the Die Hard movies, it became clear that Bruce was ready to move on, that he had outgrown Moonlighting. He was so disdainful of the material that he often hadn’t bothered to read it before arriving on the set. He was impatient about any time I spent in the trailer with the twins, although he increasingly wanted to leave early himself. I put up a punching bag on the set, suggesting that we hit it instead of each other. One day, when filming threatened to delay his early getaway, the whole set started to vibrate from Bruce’s pummeling. Thank God for that bag.\n\nOne day, as nursing time for the twins approached, I asked to be released for a twenty-five-minute break. The first assistant director kept delaying it, so after about an hour, my motor-home driver turned on the walkie-talkie so that the whole set could hear the two screaming infants and announced “Cybill, it’s time!” After that, I was free to go.\n\nThe final episode surely echoed the sentiments of viewers. “Can you really blame the audience?” a silhouetted producer asks Maddie and David. “A case of poison ivy is more fun than watching you two lately.”\n\nI was breaking up with two Bruces at once--Bruce Willis and Bruce Oppenheim. I will always regret that I never got to raise kids beyond the age of two with their fathers present. Children don’t know from incompatibility. They only want Mom and Dad to live together in love with each other and with them. When Bruce got angry, he shouted, and when I got angry, I ran away. I’d never heard my parents have an argument. I observed their brawls and mutually cold, silent treatment. I had no sense of two people being able to negotiate conflict and come to a reasonable compromise. Operating under a veil of exhaustion and frustration from work, I gave up on my marriage.\n\nBruce and I were forced to work with a court-appointed counselor, both of us legitimately afraid that divorce would mean seeing the children a lot less. Our separation was the catalyst for what was surely long overdue therapy for me. I wheeled a big rolling rack of baggage into the therapist’s office and took out one suitcase at a time, asking, “Is this because I’m an asshole?”\n\nNot long after the separation, I was walking on the treadmill and watching MTV. A video came on of a song by Martha Venessa Sharron, Ronald Lee Miller, and Kenny Hirsch called “If I Could.” The lyrics moved me instantly to tears: “If I could. I’d teach you all the things I never learned / And help you cross all those bridges that I burned.” I started weeping so profusely that I had to push the emergency button on the treadmill to keep from falling down."
