A 4 Jul 1990 Var news item named Martin Scorsese as executive producer, marking the filmmaker’s third time working with Price following The Color of Money (1986, see entry) and New York Stories (1989, see entry).\n\nA few months later, however, the 15 Sep 1989 LAHExam reported that Caron had quit the project after struggling to find two suitable lead actors with similar availability for filming. Among those considered were Michael Keaton and Richard Dreyfuss, who both reportedly passed on the picture.\n\nAccording to a 14 May 1991 HR article, John McNaughton stepped in to replace Caron after Scorsese approached him with the script. The 9-16 Jun 1993 issue of Time Out (London) stated that longtime Scorsese collaborator Robert De Niro read for both “Wayne Dobie” and Frank Milo. Although Milo, the intimidating gangster, was considered the more obvious choice, De Niro decided to play shy photographer Wayne instead, and suggested Bill Murray to star opposite him in what the 14 May 1991 HR noted was the actor’s first attempt at a dramatic role since the “critical and box office bomb,” The Razor’s Edge (1984, see entry).

Items in AMPAS library files indicate that De Niro also recommended Kathy Baker, his co-star from 1989’s Jacknife (see entry), to play “Lee.” After several months auditioning actresses in Los Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL; and New York City, Uma Thurman was cast as “Glory,” despite her being somewhat younger than was originally intended for the role. The 13 Jul 1991 HR stated that De Niro spent several weeks researching with the New York Police Department’s Crime Scene Unit. However, the 10 Jun 1991 Var announced that the previously New York City-set production was forced to film in Chicago due to scheduling demands.\n\nA 16 Jul 1991 HR production chart indicated that principal photography began the previous day. Locations included The Warehouse nightclub, where scenes in Milo’s comedy club were filmed; Bravissimo! Italian restaurant; Club Lago; the White Palace Grill; and a greystone apartment building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, which doubled as the exterior of Wayne’s home.\n\nShortly after its 5 Mar 1993 opening, the 3 May 1993 DV reported that Mad Dog and Glory had completed its theatrical run with less than $11 million in domestic earnings. Although reception of the film was mixed, critics consistently praised De Niro and Murray for their strong performances in roles that were considered “against type.”\n\nEnd credits state: “Special thanks to: Michael Burchette/The Mayfair Regent Hotel; Barbara Kogen/The Ambassador East Hotel; Paul Petraitis; Cinecenter, Chicago; Z Post; The Honorable Mayor Richard M. Daley, Mayor of City of Chicago; State of Illinois Film Office/Suzy Kellett, Al Cohn, Richard Moskal; Chicago Film Office/Charles Geocaris; and the following technical advisors: Wayne Barney, Jerry Donohue, John Manca, Rich Malloy, Hal Sherman, Lt.

As they become acquainted, Glory discusses her failed ambition to become an actress and notices that Frank’s lackey, Harold, is following them to ensure Wayne is happy. After having dinner, Wayne runs into Mike. The men discuss Wayne’s rapport with his neighbor, Lee, who is seated at the bar with her abusive boyfriend. Knowing the man is also a police officer, Wayne watches in awe as Mike stands up for Lee and urges her boyfriend to leave her alone. The next day, Wayne wonders if acting on his attraction to Glory would make her a prostitute. While watching a movie on television, Glory puts Wayne’s arm around her shoulders, and he considers kissing her. Sensing his interest, she pulls him into an intimate embrace, but Wayne becomes aroused too quickly and cannot perform. Glory insists he is a “sweet man” anyway, and the two spend the remainder of the evening taking photographs around the city. When they return home, Glory undresses and they make love several times. Wayne eventually leaves for work, where he is assigned to photograph a crime scene at an Italian restaurant. Unable to contain his glee, he puts money into the jukebox and surprises his associates by singing along to Louis Prima’s “Just A Gigolo\" and \"I Ain’t Got Nobody.” At the police station, Wayne walks in on Frank entertaining the other officers with his comedy routine. He rebuffs Frank’s friendly banter, which the gangster takes to mean Glory is not doing her job. During their last few days together, Wayne admits he loves Glory and tells Frank about their romance, hoping she does not have to return to his employ. Frank responds poorly to the news and sends Harold to Wayne’s apartment, where Mike fights for Glory on his friend’s behalf. Frank then offers to sell her for $40,000, provided Wayne can produce the money within three days. After telling Glory she has been freed from her contract to Frank, he secretly attempts to raise the funds, but comes up $12,500 short. Before long, Glory realizes the truth and decides she would rather leave than be considered someone else’s property again. Moments after she walks away, Frank arrives to punish Wayne for not settling up their agreement. With the rest of the police squad standing by, Wayne provokes a fight and gradually overtakes Frank by smashing his head against the front stoop. Glory returns, offering to end the dispute by leaving with her former boss. Fed up with their antics, Frank decides to let them both go, but expresses regret that he and Wayne could not be friends. Mike congratulates “Mad Dog” for standing up for himself, as Glory slings her bag over her shoulder. Although Wayne assumes she plans to move on with her life, Glory takes his hand and leads him upstairs to the apartment.\n\nLess"
