        "text": "On a steamy Summer day in his West 54th Street office, the casting director Louis DiGiaimo is auditioning actresses for the role of Vida, the saucy, ebullient arsonist in \"Wilder Napalm.\" In the movie, Vida is married to Wilder, a Fotokwik clerk and volunteer fireman who loves calling bingo games and is blessed with the ability to set fires with his mind. Wilder's brother, Wallace, to be played by Dennis Quaid, is a carnival clown (also pyrokinetic) whose ambition is to lead his co-workers in an appearance on the \"Tonight\" show.\n\nThough \"Wilder Napalm\" is not to begin filming until early November, the summer finds Mr. DiGiaimo deeply involved in the casting process. The job requires him to fly between New York and Los Angeles to audition actors for not only Vida and Wilder but such characters as the Snake Lady; Rex, the chief carny, and a company of volunteer firemen.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Daryl Hannah, Mimi Rogers, Molly Ringwald and Linda Hamilton have already read for the role -- and some have been called back to meet the movie's director, Glenn Gordon Caron -- but no one has been offered the part. \"Vida is a great role,\" says the balding, bearded Mr. DiGiaimo (pronounced de-JEYE-mo), who most recently cast \"Thelma and Louise.\" \"She has so much heart.\"\n\nA camcorder is beside Mr. DiGiaimo, who is sitting in a director's chair. Opposite Mr. DiGiaimo is a leather sofa. Sharing wall space with shelves full of books, scripts and videotapes are posters from some of the films he has cast, including \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"The Godfather\" and \"Rain Man.\" (Mr. DiGiaimo, who is 48 years old, has cast about 100 films, television shows and miniseries.) The office is an amiable mess.\n\nEach actress reads two scenes, one as a warm-up, the other for the video camera. The latter scene shows Vida apologizing to her husband for romancing his brother. It seems that while the toupeed Wilder was out calling bingo numbers, Vida and Wallace were striking up a dalliance that ignites a literal conflagration between the two men.\n\nTo each actress, Mr. DiGiaimo gives similar advice: \"Remember, she loves Wilder; and just because she lives in a trailer park doesn't mean she's white trash. She's been under house arrest for a year,\" on an arson charge, \"and when she's finally free, Wilder goes to call bingo. Don't forget, you've been up for 36 hours.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
