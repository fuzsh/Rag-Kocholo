Harlem is conveniently located in Columbia County in the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA). There is a lot to do both here in Harlem and in the surrounding area.

Harlem is home to the Laurel and Hardy Museum of Harlem, Georgia (www.laurelandhardymuseum.com) that celebrates the lives and careers of comedy legends Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Oliver Hardy was born in Harlem, and each year, on the first Saturday in October, thousands flock to Harlem for the Oliver Hardy Festival.

Harlem is just down the road from the United States Army’s Fort Gordon – traditionally the home of the Army’s Signal Corps and now home to the Army’s Cyber Command. Residents can arrive at Gate 2 within 10 minutes.

Columbia County also features an extensive parks system that includes Savannah Rapids Pavilion, Blanchard Woods Park, Wildwood Park, Patriots Park, and many more. Activities range from kayaking to fishing to disc golf. Columbia County is actually home to the International Disc Golf Center!

Clarks Hill Lake is just a short drive from Harlem, and it features fishing and boating opportunities that the whole family will enjoy. It can be accessed from a variety of parks and boat launches in Columbia County.

Concerts from world-class entertainers, a multitude of shopping and dining options, and, of course, the Masters are located in Augusta – just a twenty-minute drive from Harlem.
