        "text": "When Terrance McKnight gets a piano — that’s his goal for this year, a piano and some bookshelves — his apartment in Harlem will be perfection.\n\nThe weekday evening host at the classical radio station WQXR, Mr. McKnight, 49, has a sun-drenched living room, a kitchen of respectable size with good counter space and plenty of cupboards (he likes to cook on weekends), and a trio of closets. “I need them to hide my skeletons,” he said waggishly. Well, in any case, his futon.\n\nBut he’d happily swap a closet or two or, at the very least, reposition the pewter sectional in the living room, to accommodate the piano in question, his 7-foot-6 grand, a Yamaha C7.\n\n“I know I can get it in the front door,” Mr. McKnight said. “But I really don’t think it will go around the corner at the third landing. I haven’t gotten a guarantee that it will fit, and if can’t get a guarantee I don’t want to put the Yamaha — or me — through it.”\n\nPiano has always been key to Mr. McKnight’s identity. It was the first instrument he learned to play as a kid. He majored in piano performance at Morehouse College and then did a stint on the faculty. And piano is what helped set him on his subsequent career path: broadcasting.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
