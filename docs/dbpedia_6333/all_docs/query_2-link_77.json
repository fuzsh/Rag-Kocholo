These intersecting Pan-African celebrations, rooted in revolutionary fervor, occur during Black August. Black August is a month-long observance that pays tribute to Black freedom fighters and acknowledges the history of Black resistance to oppression.\n\nAFRIBEMBÃ will be hosted by poet and activist MC Felipe Luciano with featured artists: Something Positive Dance Troupe, Kongo Haitian Roots, KR3TS, and DJ Sabine Blazin.\n\nAs an East Harlem institution dedicated to advancing cultural equity and promoting racial and social justice for African-descendant communities, CCCADI proudly joins Harlem Week to Celebrate the Journey, recognizing our intertwined histories. The journey of Harlem Week continues the legacy of Black excellence in Harlem from 40 years ago and honors our ancestors' resilience, beauty, and cultural preservation before that.\n\nCCCADIâs AfribembÃ© is born from the legacy of El Festival de Santiago ApÃ³stol en El Barrio, also known as the Loiza Festival in El Barrio. This Harlem festival celebrated the traditions of Loiza, Puerto Rico, one of the most African-influenced towns on the island. While the celebration in Loiza is of the town's patron saint, it elevates, preserves, and represents African traditions in Puerto Rico.\n\nFrom drumming to rhythm to party, we use the African word BembÃ© as one term that connects our Diaspora in music, joy, and community. AFRIBEMBÃ is one of the many ways CCCADI seeks to advance its mission of cultural equity and racial and social justice for African-descendant communities through the arts and culture.\n\nAFRIBEMBÃ is made possible by the New York City Department of Cultural AffairsâCoalition for Theaters of Color, the New York City Council, the Altman Foundation, Ford Foundation, Gilman Foundation, Mellon Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations.\n\nAFRIBEMBÃ FESTIVAL AT HARLEM WEEK 50\n\nWHEN: Sunday, August 11, 2024 from 4:30 - 6:30 PM\n\nLOCATION: General Grant National Memorial (W 122nd St &, Riverside Dr., New York, 10027)\n\nRSVP: FREE - Registration is not required.\n\nVIEW HIGH RES IMAGES HERE\n\nFor more information, visit www.afribembe.com.\n\nFor Harlem Weekâs Full Schedule of Activities, visit https://harlemweek.com.\n\nABOUT CCCADI\n\nThe Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute (CCCADI) is an arts, culture, education, and media organization that advances cultural equity, and racial and social justice for African descendant communities. CCCADI's programs serve children/youth, families, young professionals, elders, local and international artists, and practitioners of African-based spiritual traditions.

HARLEM WEEK began in 1974 as HARLEM DAY, a one-day event of encouragement and fellowship in Harlem for New Yorkers and beyond. Given the huge success of the celebration, additional days were added to showcase the communityâs rich economic, political, and cultural history.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA:\n\nFacebook: @CCCADI\n\nTwitter: @CCCADI\n\nInstagram: @CCCADI\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nTiffany Knighten\n\nBrand Curators\n\ntiffany@brandcurators.co\n\nViannca Velez\n\nDirector of Communications\n\nCaribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute\n\nvvelez@cccadi.org\n\n###\n\nLegal Disclaimer:\n\nEIN Presswire provides this news content \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.
