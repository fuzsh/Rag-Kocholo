        "text": "In October 2012 all Columbia County, Georgia government entities, to the best of my knowledge, switched to their current encrypted TRS. The remaining municipalities within the County eventually switched to the TRS and it seemed that all of them (Harlem PD/FD, Grovetown PD/FD and Martinez FD) abandoned their VHF frequencies... or did they?\n\nI use an SDS 100 fed by a mobile tri-band antenna along with GPS module attached. I scan entities in the CSRA and regularly hear everyone on the Palmetto 800 across the river. Recently, I caught an NXDN transmission on the old Grovetown PD dispatch frequency of 155.520MHz. I didn't hear it long enough to identify any traffic to be able to identify a user as I caught the transmission as it was ending. That's the only traffic I've heard on any of the old VHF frequencies in the county since these entities moved to the TRS. I decided to look at the RR database and clicked on the FCC callsigns and noticed that many of the VHF licenses are being renewed.\n\nI have a few questions of those that may have more knowledge on the subject. Why would the county continue to renew licenses, and maintain repeaters, if they're using a TRS? Why is the county still hanging on to the old frequencies? Are they hanging onto these frequency assignments as backups? If they're for backup then why spend tax dollars to buy new equipment to use on the TRS if the old stuff is still viable? I know the Columbia County Sheriffs Office was using Motorola MTR 2000 repeaters and got rid of them once they switched to the TRS.\n\nIs anyone still scanning the old Columbia County VHF frequencies and, if so, have you heard any traffic on them?\n\nIn October 2012 all Columbia County, Georgia government entities, to the best of my knowledge, switched to their current encrypted TRS.

I know the Columbia County Sheriffs Office was using Motorola MTR 2000 repeaters and got rid of them once they switched to the TRS.\n\nIs anyone still scanning the old Columbia County VHF frequencies and, if so, have you heard any traffic on them?\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, Columbia County is renewing licenses, but I‚Äôm not sure what the reasoning is. I believe repeaters are still active, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre actively being maintained. I‚Äôve heard of some rare traffic on some of the county repeaters, but I‚Äôm not sure who is using said repeaters. Most/all of the portable and mobile units disappeared within a few years of moving over to the TRS‚Ä¶..not sure if it was thrown in a closet and forgotten about or sold as surplus.\n\nMost if not all county users are on the encrypted TRS. Both municipalities use the TRS for public safety functions, not sure about other city services. I‚Äôm not sure what either municipality did with the old VHF equipment though.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I can try and ask around.\n\nHarlem PD is the only entity that hasn't renewed their license for the old VHF frequencies. As per the RR database, the Columbia County/Martinez FD, Columbia County animal control, Columbia County EMA, All Grovetown entities, and North Columbia Fire/Rescue have had their VHF licenses renewed since the changeover to the TRS. Some of those licenses were renewed as recently as July, 2023.\n\nMaybe I'm thinking it through too much but, but keeping licenses active for frequencies not being used isn't financially sound, IMO. I'm unaware of the cost to maintain the licenses for these frequencies and it would make sense to keep equipment in service to utilize the licenses. If no equipment is being maintained for use then how much is the license renewal fees costing the tax payers of Columbia County? If I was a Columbia County resident I would want an answer as to why my tax dollars are being spent for something not being utilized.\n\nAs stated by others, maintaining licenses seems to be pretty standard in public safety. As far as specifics pertaining to Columbia County, I don‚Äôt know what the reasoning is.\n\nI do know that CC has equipment that allows interoperability among various agencies in the region, which includes needs for VHF, UHF, 800, HF, etc. Perhaps that factors into it?\n\nNo clue. They do have the MOC vehicle that belongs to the EMA. That vehicle provides interoperability to agencies in the CSRA for incidents requiring it.\n\nThe sheriffs department got rid of their MTR 2000 VHF repeaters a few months after the transition to the TRS. I got a preview of them on the shelf prior to auction, I was hoping to utilize one for ham radio use but their band split wouldn‚Äôt allow it.\n\nI don‚Äôt know anything about the equipment status of other agencies in the county. I just thought it was odd to maintain licenses for frequencies that haven‚Äôt been used in over a decade and, for equipment that‚Äôs no longer in place. I envisioned some government type with a hoarder mentality refusing to give up the frequencies even if they‚Äôre not using themüòÅ"
