        "text": "CJOS-FM is a new Canadian radio station, that broadcasts a classic hits format at 92.3 FM in Owen Sound, Ontario. Owned by Larche Communications, the station was licenced in 2008. The CJOS-FM call sign formerly belonged to a religious station in Caronport, Saskatchewan, which ceased broadcasting in 2006. On June 9, 2010, CJOS-FM received CRTC approval to decrease their effective radiated power from 20,000 watts to 9,400 watts. In July 2010, the station began their on-air tests at 92.3 FM. On July, 26, 2010, the station officially signed on.\n\n99X was a radio station in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, streaming an alternative rock radio format branded as 99X, which began on full-power station WNNX FM 99.7 in late October 1992. The station was taken off-air when Q100 was moved to 99.7 from 100.5, but returned to W250BC FM 97.9, and then moved to W256BO FM 99.1. It was taken off-air again on the last day of August 2012, and replaced the following day with \"98-9 the Bone\", but none of the on-air staff were fired as commercial broadcasters typically do when changing a format, indicating that 99X may make a second resurrection on another Cumulus Media station in the area. After the 2011 purchase of Citadel Broadcasting, its sister stations in Atlanta include WKHX-FM 101.5 and WYAY FM 106.7, in addition to previous Cumulus holdings WWWQ FM 99.7, WNNX FM 100.5, and W250BC FM 97.9."
