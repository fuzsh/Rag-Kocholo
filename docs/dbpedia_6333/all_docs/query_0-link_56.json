        "text": "Coco Rubio And The Dynamics Of Downtown Augusta – Austin’s Daily Commentary\n\nAustin talks about Coco Rubio and the dynamics of downtown Augusta.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin: Coco Rubio has been a successful business owner in downtown Augusta for well over 30 years. He celebrates 29 years of great success at the Soul Bar this year. It’s hard to believe next year will be 30 for the Soul Bar.\n\nBottom line, though, he’s been around the block when it comes to understanding the dynamics of downtown Augusta. What works, what doesn’t, what’s crowd pleasing and what’s not, and the ins and outs of the bureaucracy and working the bureaucracy as a bar owner in downtown Augusta.\n\nHe has seen a lot. And one thing that he saw Friday morning, was the beginnings of the shootout that occurred in downtown Augusta. About 1 a.m. he was closing up shop at Soul Bar. And that was on his way home, and the gunfire erupted.\n\nHe saw enough to to realize that it was time to speak out. He has been promised time after time after time, that security was going to be beefed up in downtown Augusta, and that the sheriff’s department was going to improve their coverage of the downtown area.\n\nHe’s tired of waiting for that to happen. He’s tired of the broken promises. And he says that progress needs to be made now and sooner rather than later. He’s opting for change in the leadership of the sheriff’s department.\n\nI don’t know that Coco has come out and advocated a political candidate or a position, ever during his tenure downtown. Perhaps, but I can’t remember one particularly this pronounced. He came by yesterday, spent an hour with me on the air, and got into detail as to why exactly he believes that it’s time for change in the leadership of the Richmond County Sheriff’s Department.\n\nHe’s going to be voting for Gino Rock Brantley, and if that fails, no doubt he’ll be supporting Richard Dixon in November. Bottom line, he says it’s time for Roundtree to go and I could not agree with him more. Coco, thanks for coming out. It’s tough for a business owner to do, but it needed to be done and that’s the comment, I’m Austin Rhodes, 95.1 FM News Talk WGAC."
