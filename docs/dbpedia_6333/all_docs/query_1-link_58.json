        "text": "• Longtime Augusta, GA radio pro John Patrick has been named as morning co-anchor on Beasley News-Talk WGAC (95.1FM/AM 580)/Augusta, joining Steve Smith and Mary Liz Nolan. The transition is relatively painless, as Patrick most recently worked across the hall on ESPN affiliate WRDW-AM.\n\nPatrick, who is currently celebrating his 41st year in broadcasting, began his radio career at WFIC-AM/Martinsville, VA. After a stint in Wilmington, NC, Patrick arrived in Augusta in April of 1984. For the next decade, he worked at WZNY (Sunny 105) as PD, morning co-host and midday personality. In 1994, he became the morning host on WBBQ, and in 2000, Patrick was named Operations Manager for the seven-station cluster.\n\nIn 2008, Patrick created The Augusta Golf Show with John Patrick, which will now air on WGAC-FM on Saturday afternoons. This year will also mark Patrick’s 34th Masters golf tournament. “To have a guy like John with 40+ years in radio leading the way on the WGAC morning show is quite an honor,” said VP/Market Manager Kent Dunn. “We look forward what John brings to WGAC and the Beasley Media Group of Augusta.”"
