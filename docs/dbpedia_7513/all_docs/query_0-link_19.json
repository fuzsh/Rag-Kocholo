It's an honor to have my paper Subgroups of depth three with Sebastian Burciu in Surv. Diff. Geom. XV. Runner-up honors to Odd H-depth and H-separable extensions in Cent. Eur. J. Math. 10 (2012). \" Subring depth, Frobenius extensions and towers in Int. J. Math. & Math. Sci. (2012),\n\nThe article Algebraic quotient modules and subgroup depth with Hernandez and Young in Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universitaet Hamburg (October 2014). A well-cited article On subgroup depth with Sebastian M. Burciu and Burkhard Kuelshammer in I.E.J.A.. My best article in this period is perhaps Hopf subalgebras and tensor powers of generalized permutation modules in Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra (January 2014).\n\nOPEN PROBLEMS for the curious. In the Oslo, Karlstad, Mainz, Leeds and Canada talks above, some background for several problems in depth two (and more): 1) Are left D2 extensions right D2? 2) Are D2 Hopf subalgebras normal? Yes, J.Alg. 2010 Boltje-Kuelshammer 3) Do D2 extensions of simple algebras have a Galois correspondence between subextensions and Hopf subalgebroids? 4) Is a fin. gen. bialgebroid the endomorphism ring of a D2 algebra extension? (5) Are there subgroups of minimimum depth 2n where n > 3? A positive answer in a preprint by Breuer, Janabi and Horvath (6) Find a characterization of depth n subgroup (e.g. n = 2 <=> normal subgroup). See the paper in (9) below for combinatorial depth of a subgroup and its depth n characterization. (7) How to efficiently compute the matrix of the zeroeth K-theory mapping K(R) ---> K(H) of a subalgebra pair (R,H) of semisimple Hopf algebras? Find an alternative way to compute depth not involving full character and induction-restriction tables. (8) Determine if depth is finite for any Hopf subalgebra of any finite dimensional Hopf algebra. See the papers of Boltje-Danz-Kuelshammer (J.Alg. 335 (2011)), the talk talk in Lausanne for the case of a pair of group algebras, the JPAA (2014) and Abh. Hamburg papers mentioned above for some additional nonsemisimple Hopf algebras.\n\nPOSTS.

Following the proof of Fermat's two-square theorem (a prime congruent to 1 module 4 is the sum of two squares) using factorization of sum of two squares over the complex numbers and unique factorization in euclidean domains, assign the following problem to the honors students. Find a three-square theorem and its somewhat similar proof using factorization of the sum of three squares over the quaternions and a fact from an introductory book on number theory such as Hardy and Wright. Solution Proof\n\nMY UCSD GRADING POLICY. I have been on a teaching visitorship at the University of California at San Diego from September 2009 to January 2010. Grading in both my courses has been on a curve suggested on p. 10 in the visitor guidebook, instructor resources of the math department's website. The weighting in Math 20B (from the first day) is 20% Midterm 1, 25% Midterm 2, 15% Homework (and/or quizzes, here the detailed policy set by your TA), 40% Final. In Math 20E it is 20% each midterm, 10% Homework, and 50% Final.\n\nMATH 20E. (198 students, Warren Lecture Hall 2005, 11 a.m. TA's: r1gomez, htn005, jmiddleton. Grader: Swartz.) The median of the weighted scores including the final was a 65 with a standard deviation of 24. The solutions are given here, but ignore the front page which is from midterm 2 by a glitch.\n\nMATH 20B. (202 students. Center Hall 101, 3 p.m. TA's: pcompeau, mtiefenbruck, ashakeel, vkungurt. Grader: Schilz.) The average for the weighted scores including the final was a 68 with a median of 72 and a standard deviation of 19. The solutions to the final are here, except for problem 1a) whose answer is a_n = n sin (1/n) goes to 1 since sin x/x goes to 1 as x goes to zero; and problem 1b) whose answer is sum e to the minus n from n = 1 is equal to 1/(e-1) by a slight modification of the sum of a geometric series with ratio less than one.\n\nTEXTBOOK.Projective Geometry and Modern Algebra with Matthias Buch-Kromann. A textbook for undergraduates that mixes group theory, ring theory and projective geometry: has served to motivate students to learn abstract algebra.\n\nMONOGRAPH. New Examples of Frobenius Extensions, volume 14 in the American Mathematical Society's University Lecture Series.\n\nSince its publication, there have been many more developments that would have fit well in this book, including depth two and reconstruction of weak Hopf algebras on separable centralizers, Hopf algebras on one-dimensional centralizers, Hopf algebroids and Galois theory; antipodes, depth, and double algebra structures for Frobenius extensions, subgroup depth, Frobenius algebras in categories and separability. See the link to updated and annotated list of references to \"New Examples...\"\n\nRECENT, FUTURE AND MAIN PUBLICATIONS. Simplicial Hochschild cochains as an Amitsur complex is published in J. Gen. Lie Theory in 2008 (arXiv has the better version of this paper). Finite depth and Jacobson-Bourbaki correspondence, appeared in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra in July 2008. Pseudo-Galois extensions and Hopf algebroids appeared July 4, 2008, in Birkhauser Trends in Math, Proceedings of Conf. on Modules and Comodules, Portugal, Sept. 2006, on the occasion of Robert Wisbauer's birthday. Bialgebroid Actions on Depth Two Extensions and Duality with coauthor Kornel Szlachanyi appeared in October 2003 in volume 179 of Advances in Mathematics. With coauthor Dmitri Nikshych, Frobenius extensions and weak Hopf algebras appeared in volume 244 (2001), 312-342, in Journal of Algebra, and our paper, Hopf algebra actions on strongly separable extensions of depth two appeared in no. 2, vol. 163 (2001) in Adv. in Math. The rest of my publications, or anyone's for that matter, are summarized by Zentralblatt or MR lookup.\n\nEDUCATION.
