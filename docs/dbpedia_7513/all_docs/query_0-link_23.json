        "text": "Compiled a list of papers applying (algebraic) topology to finance at: https://blog.nus.edu.sg/wuchengyuan/topology-in-finance/\n\nInterestingly, topology seems best at detecting financial crashes, but can also predict stock price movement, do clustering and classification of financial time series, and more.\n\nThis 3 minute video explains very well how algebraic topology (in particular persistent homology) can be applied to finance:\n\nThere are two methods to solve 2nd order linear Non-homogenous D.E.: Variation of Parameters and Method of Undetermined Coefficients. (see this notes for details)\n\nA common question is: when to use which method?\n\nSimple Guideline: If (the right-hand side of the D.E. ) is a\n\nPolynomial\n\nExponential ( )\n\nSine or Cosine ( or )\n\nOr combinations of the above\n\nuse Method of Undetermined Coefficients for fast solution. Note: It is 100% correct to use Variation of Parameters for the above cases, but it is usually slower due to the integration involved.\n\nFor all other cases not covered above, use Variation of Parameters.\n\nExamples from Midterm\n\n(2016 Q10) . Use Method of Undetermined Coefficients since is a sum of exponential functions.\n\n(2015 Q9) . Use Method of Undetermined Coefficients since is a cosine function.\n\n(2015 Q10) . Although is an exponential, it is not of the form . Also, the fact that and are integrals clearly suggests that they are related to the in the method of Variation of Parameters. So we use Variation of Parameters.\n\n(2014 Q10) . On the surface, does not fall into the category of polynomial/exponential/cos/sine, so we use Variation of Parameters as shown in the official answer.\n\nHowever, if we know the identity , we can actually rewrite the equation as and use Method of Undetermined Coefficients.\n\nOutline of solution using Method of Undetermined Coefficients:\n\nGuess . Then , where we can clearly see that . Then . Upon plugging in the initial conditions, we find that .\n\nHence .\n\nEntertaining video to (hopefully) increase your interest in math.\n\nRecently, I saw this video in the “Trending” section of YouTube (3 million views). It is actually related to differential equations.\n\nThe basic question behind this is: What is the shape of the curve that will allow a ball to slide frictionlessly (under gravity) to a given end point in the shortest time? Rather surprisingly, the answer is not a straight line, even though a straight line is the shortest distance between two points.\n\nPerhaps even more surprising is that such a curve is a tautochrone curve, where the time taken by an object sliding without friction in uniform gravity to its lowest point is independent of its starting point\n\nNote: Do not worry, this is not tested.\n\nFor beginners, Double Integrals can be difficult to visualize as the resulting diagram is in 3 dimensions. Here are some resources that can help:\n\n1) YouTube Animation\n\nThis excellent animation explains the concept behind double integration and also polar integrals.\n\n2) Wolfram Alpha Command: 3dplot\n\nThis command can help to visualize the surface . For example, in Tutorial 7 Q3, what does the surface looks like?\n\nYou can type “3dplot z=x” into WolframAlpha: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3dplot+z%3Dx\n\nResult:\n\nThis makes sense, since means , i.e. we can see that the surface should be a plane."
