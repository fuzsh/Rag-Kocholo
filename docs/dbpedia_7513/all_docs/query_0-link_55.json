This is the autobiography of one of the most important mathematical writers of the 20th century, it is not only interesting as\n\na biography but also as a source of advice on writing mathematics, teaching, and other things. Particularly interesting are his discussions of graduate student life in the US before\n\nthe second world war, and the stories behind the two books I mention below, <em>Naive Set Theory</em> and <em>Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces</em>. His discussion of the writing\n\nprocess is particularly enlightening: it reminds me somewhat of another great writer, Vladimir Nabokov - for instance, both wrote on index cards (this is discussed on p.394 of Halmos\n\n(Springer softcover reprint 1985) and on p.169 of Brian Boyd's <em>Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years</em> (Vintage softcover 1993)).\n\n</li>\n\n<li>Michael Harris, <em>Mathematics Without Apologies: Portrait of a Problematic Vocation</em>. A more modern non-autobiography, I quite enjoyed it. This book is allegedly addressed to the\n\nlayperson, which is an opportunity to impose upon you one of my opinions: there are two kinds of mathematical biographies, namely those by laypeople writing about mathematicians\n\nand those by mathematicians writing about mathematicians. The first kind is invariably readable only by laypeople, and the second kind invariably only by mathematicians (regardless\n\nof the target audience).\n\n<p>\n\nLet me be more precise: when a layperson (an abuse of terminology which I will use to mean 'non-mathematician' for convenience) writes a mathematical biography (two good examples\n\nhere: Paul Hoffman's <em>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</em> (about Paul Erdős) and Simon\n\nSingh's <em>Fermat's Last Theorem</em> which I would place in the 'biography' super-genre despite being a biography of something inanimate) a full two-thirds of the book is spent\n\non discussing mathematical culture through listing off the same few historical events (e.g. stating the <em>Bridges of Konigberg</em> problem, or giving a precis of a biography of Ramanujan).\n\nOn the other hand, mathematicians do not do this - and even when they try, as in Harris' book here, the level of discourse is far beyond the average reader with only minimal mathematical training:\n\nnot so much the mathematical content (here, the basics of number theory) but the speed at which it is expounded which requires a certain amount of mathematical maturity. That is, there is a reason\n\nthat the non-mathematician spends 2/3 of the book on this stuff when writing for the layperson, rather than the three sections of this 10-chapter book.\n\n<p>\n\nThis was recently discussed in <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2501/\">XKCD:2501</a>. Another famous example is the rejected obituary of Grothendieck written by Tate and Mumford:\n\nfor their side of the story see Mumford's blog post <em><a href=\"https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/blog/2014/Grothendieck.html\">Can one explain schemes to biologists</a></em>.\n\nI also like the subsequent post <em><a href=\"http://www.neverendingbooks.org/can-one-explain-schemes-to-hipsters\">Can one explain schemes to hipsters?</a></em> on the neverendingbooks blog,\n\nand the post <em><a href=\"https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/the-two-cultures-of-mathematics-and-biology/\">The two cultures of mathematics and biology</a></em> on Lior Pachter's blog.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>Paul Lockhart, <a href=\"https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf\"><em>A Mathematician's Lament</em></a>: A complaint about the U.S. education system\n\nthat is somewhat relevant to NZ.</li>\n\n<li>Underwood Dudley, <em>A Budget of Trisections</em> and <em>Mathematical Cranks</em>. Both very funny, quite quick to read! In <em>Trisections</em>, Dudley goes through a selection\n\nof attempts to trisect the angle using only a straightedge and compass (proved impossible by Wantzel in 1837).\n\n<em>Cranks</em> is a short collection of random stories about mathematical cranks. At this point I am reminded that there is (was?) a book in the General Library by a relativity denier\n\nwhose first ten or so pages were covered in pencil from some conscientous physics student's efforts at giving detailed refutations - after ten pages, of course, they had clearly had\n\nenough. (516.204 D84 and 510 D84)</li>\n\n<li>Stephen Krantz, <em>Mathematical Apocrypha</em> and <em>More Mathematical Apocrypha</em>. Collections of short mathematical biographies and urban legends (possibly even less reliable than Bell).</li>\n\n<li>Carl E. Linderholm, <em>Mathematics Made Difficult</em>. This book needs no introduction and no recommendation, it is a classic.</li>\n\n<li>Norman E. Steenrod; Paul R. Halmos; Menahem M Schiffer; and Jean A. Dieudonné, <em>How to Write Mathematics</em>. This is a collection of four essays,\n\nthe theme being mathematical writing (planning structure, style of writing, etc.).</li>\n\n<li>G. H. Hardy, <em>A Mathematician's Apology</em>. This is a classic book, but should be read with the understanding that many of the philosophical ideas\n\nput forward by Hardy are old-fashioned at best and damaging at worst. A very good discussion of this from a modern viewpoint is chapter 10 of\n\nHarris' <em>Mathematics Without Apologies</em> which I mentioned above.</li> Another very interesting read is the blog post <a href=\"https://ilaba.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/g-h-hardy-and-mrs-ellis/\">G. H. Hardy and Mrs Ellis</a> on Izabella Laba's blog.\n\n<li>Diana Davis (ed.), <em>Illustrating Mathematics</em>. Very nice book of pictures of various geometric objects which have been made \"in the real world\" (e.g. sculptures or line drawings).\n\n<li>Mark Ronan, <em>Symmetry and The Monster</em>. An introduction to the classification of the finite simple groups, very good bathroom reading. A bit of \"mathematics for the nonmathematician\" is included\n\nbut it doesn't make the book too hard to read (i.e. it is easy to skip).\n\n<li>M.C. Escher, <em>The Magic of M.C. Escher</em>. Very nice edition of the works of Escher. In this vein see the book <a href=\"#combinatorics-and-finite-geometry-326\">below</a> by Grünbaum\n\nand Sheppard on tilings of the plane. Also highly recommended is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkhuMvFQWz4\">this video of H.S.M. Coxeter discussing the work of Escher</a> (part\n\nof the documentary The Fantastic world of Escher) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc4fxeVaB8\">this video on Coxeter, Gardner, and Escher</a>.\n\n<li>Lewis Carroll, <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> and <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em>. While on the subject of nice editions of mathematical art, I particularly recommend the edition\n\nof Lewis Carroll's two novels published in the Penguin Classics series.\n\n<li>Douglas Hofstadter, <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em>. Perhaps it is because I am not a philosopher or computer scientist, but I found it unreadable.\n\n<li>Michael Gowers (ed.), <em>Princeton Companion</em>. A very nice, locally readable, encyclopaedia of mathematics written for mathematicians. Keep meaning to buy a copy...\n\n<li>Colin Adams, <em>Do Androids Dream of Symmetric Sheaves?</em>. I will quote a paragraph which illustrates the flavour of the book (from Chapter 17): \"Frederick Funkle was born in a small apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey, just a block from where David Hilbert once stayed for a week. Although unaware of who David Hilbert was, Frederick walked by that house on a daily basis. This early influence seems to have had, via osmosis, a fundamental impact on Frederick. Much of the rest of his career was spent walking past the houses of famous mathematicians.\"\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<h2><a id=\"elementary-texts-stage-i-and-ii\">Children's books (first and second year undergraduate)</h2>\n\n<h3><a id=\"single-variable-calculus-130-250\">Single-variable calculus</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>James Stewart, <em>Calculus</em> (and all other isomorphic books, e.g. Anton's calculus book). If you're an engineering student, this book is probably fine; it's full of\n\nroutine problems. If you're a mathematics student, I wouldn't bother buying a copy (there are plenty in the library) - for the actual mathematics, see the lecture notes.</li>\n\n<li>Silvanus Thompson, <em>Calculus Made Easy</em>. This is the book I originally learned calculus from in year 11. It is a little old fashioned,\n\nbut the intuition in here is very clear and the author has a sense of humour! This is perhaps the book I would recommend to the motivated Y12 student or the\n\ninterested Y13 student if they want some reading material. It covers various integration tricks (or 'dodges', as Thompson calls them), as well as some geometry\n\n(lengths of curves, and curvature) and gives reasonable intuitive justifications for the rules.\n\n<p>Thompson is unsuitable for even first year university, because it is far from rigorous (it doesn't mention limits, although the recent editions have a\n\nforeword and initial chapters by Martin Gardner which do cover them to some extent) and is too informal to really be a good introduction to mathematical\n\nthinking.\n\n<p>Indeed, my favourite introductory grown-up calculus book is, as you can probably guess, the One True Calculus Book:</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Michael Spivak, <em>Calculus</em>. Do I really need to say any more? Indeed, this book is more of an introductory real analysis book than a 'standard' calculus\n\nbook. I don't believe any university in NZ actually uses it as a course text in first year (or at all), but that is no excuse for students not to use it\n\n(there always seems to be at least one copy out of the general library despite not being an official text).\n\n<p>Highlights include a very readable motivation for completeness of the reals and 𝜀-𝛿 proofs; most exercises are also very interesting. I would avoid the\n\ncomplex analysis chapters at the end, but beyond that there are no real faults with this book. (The University of Toronto is one university that uses this\n\nbook for their flagship first-year course, which has a reputation for being a trial-by-fire for new mathematics students.) One final bonus: it is cheap (well,\n\nnot really, but cheaper than the shiny calculus books that the book shop sells) and concise (again, it is a doorstop, but much more concise than the texts\n\nthat try to include absolutely everything from biology examples to Stoke's theorem).\n\n(<a href=\"http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/classes/0405/157AnalysisI/SpivakComments/SpivakComments.html\">Some comments</a>) (515 S76)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"multi-variable-calculus-253-340\">Multi-variable calculus</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Peter Baxandall &amp; Hans Liebeck, <em>Vector Calculus</em>. This book is very geometric, contains proofs in the usual \"basic calculus\" style, requires a minimal level of linear\n\nalgebra, and covers Gauss' and Stokes' theorems after Green's theorem (useful for physics - and in fact it uses electromagnetics and fluid flow as motivational examples throughout).\n\nIt even ends up stating the real Stokes' theorem, the one involving differential forms:- however, it does so in around twenty pages right at the end, only does it in three dimensions, and\n\ndoesn't really motivate it that well. Oh well, at least it's there...! (It really is a very good book though, apart from that. Also, a Dover book - so very cheap.)</li>\n\n<li>Michael Spivak, <em>Calculus on Manifolds</em> or James Munkres, <em>Analysis on Manifolds</em>. Vector calculus with rigor, leading to differential\n\nforms. Spivak's <em>Calculus</em> doesn't include multi-variable calculus; the \"standard\" sequel to Spivak in this regard is <em>Calculus on Manifolds</em>\n\nby the same author. However, I find this concise introduction a little too concise (and that it introduces technicalities in all the\n\nwrong places). Munkres' <em>Analysis on Manifolds</em> is an expanded and updated book which is (anecdotally) based on Spivak; but I have\n\nnever liked it that much either.</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Lynn Loomis and Shlomo Sternberg, <em>Advanced Calculus</em>. This book started off as notes for the legendary Math 55 at Harvard (a first year course!);\n\nit starts off with a recap of linear algebra (really one of the best `second courses in linear algebra' I've looked at), and ends up around 500\n\npages later with a very nice approach to differential forms. This is my favourite calculus text of all time, but it is probably a little too much\n\nfor students in first year! The preface recommends Spivak's <em>Calculus</em> as prep, but I think it likely that a little more maturity is required that\n\nthat for reading this book.\n\n<p>Highlights include a rigorous (and clear) treatment of infinitesimal functions and differentials, and a final chapter on applications to theoretical\n\nphysics. The exposition tries to explain a great deal of the 'philosophy of doing mathematics', which I quite like - see, for example, the chapter\n\non uniformity and compactness.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"linear-algebra-130-250-253\">Linear algebra</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>David Poole, <em>Linear Algebra: A modern introduction</em>. This was the \"recommended\" textbook for the linear algebra portion of the standard UoA undergraduate series. It's fine,\n\nI guess. Lots of routine exercises. Very chatty. Lots of random applications that aren't covered in lectures; nice to take out of the library to flick through.\n\nVery geometric.</li>\n\n<li>Stewart Venit &amp; Wayne Bishop, <em>Elementary Linear Algebra</em>. A shorter book, same content essentially. Includes section on linear programming (missing from Poole but\n\nvaguely interesting). Spends a very long time on computations.</li>\n\n<li>Gilbert Strang, <em>Linear Algebra and its Applications</em>. An incredibly computational book: I use this if I need\n\nan algorithm/computation notes. It's probably very good for compsci students, there's a lot of optimisation and efficiency\n\nstuff in here (my edition gives all the computer code in FORTRAN and some flavour of BASIC, but it's an old edition). Probably not recommended for mathematics students though.</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Paul Halmos, <em>Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces</em>. My favourite linear algebra book! Like every other Paul Halmos book, it is incredibly well-written; just take care not\n\nto get bogged down by the sections on multi-linear algebra and determinants. The exercises are actually quite similar to those that you should be solving for anyway, just take note of his\n\npreface (some exercises are introduced before the material that makes them easy). Like <em>Naive Set Theory</em> below, the theorems themselves are\n\nthe real exercises.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"logic-proofs-and-naive-set-theory-255\">Logic, \"proofs\", and naive set theory</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Kevin Houston, <em>How to Think Like a Mathematician</em>. I'm philosophically opposed to a book that tries to teach \"proofs\" without teaching mathematics, but\n\nif I had to pick a book to do it it would be this one. It's very slow, very friendly, and incredibly fluffy. I photocopy some parts for high school students\n\noccasionally.</li>\n\n<li>Daniel Velleman, <em>How to Prove It</em>. Again, I don't like this kind of book in general; this book in particular I can't stand. Many people like it.</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Paul Halmos, <em>Naive Set Theory</em>. This is <em>the</em> set theory book for the casual reader. Not many exercises that are marked as such, but the proofs are\n\noften vague enough that you should be filling bits in on your own anyway. There is an exercises book lying around in the library somewhere if you really\n\nfeel like you need it.</li>\n\n<li>L.E. Sigler, <em>Exercises in Set Theory</em>. In fact, this is that book of exercises. Might be worth a look but as I remember it's a bit dry and not actually\n\nthat good of a companion to Halmos.</li>\n\n<li>Judith Roitman, <em>Introduction to Modern Set Theory</em>. Begins axiomatically, quite a bit harder than Halmos; I would have enjoyed it if I were into logicky\n\nsemanticky stuff. I liked the style.</li>\n\n<li>Edmund Landau, <em>Foundations of Analysis</em>. Construction of the complex numbers and their properties from the Peano axioms. This book is a work of\n\nart. It makes excellent bathroom reading, despite what the Chicago bibliography would have you believe.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"elementary-number-theory-255\">Elementary number theory</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Underwood Dudley, <em>Elementary Number Theory</em>. This is a cute little introduction to number theory; the first few chapters cover the material needed for 255,\n\nand the remainder are a mixture of topic chapters (on number representations, prime counting, and so on). As you might expect from this author, the book has\n\na definite sense of humour. There is absolutely no algebra used at all, even if it would simplify any argument. This is good from the persepctive\n\nof 255.</li>\n\n<li>Kenneth Rosen, <em>Elementary number theory and its applications</em>; Joseph Silverman, <em>A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory</em>. Alternative viewpoints.\n\nBoth have the advantage of being written by practicing number theorists; Silverman is supposed to be good for learning about some basic cryptography (i.e. in my\n\ncopy of Jones and Jones on p.93 is handwritten in capital letters \"CONSULT SILVERMAN FOR CRYPTO\" and I guess it is this book rather than <em>Diophantine Geometry</em>!).\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"differential-equations-260\">Differential equations</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>George F. Simmons, <em>Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes</em>. I have a feeling that most differential equations books tend to be\n\na list of one unmotivated trick after another; this is another such book, but it is well-written, includes some fairly nice examples, and some pretty\n\ngeometry. (515.312 S59)</li>\n\n<li>Wolfgang Walter, <em>Ordinary Differential Equations</em>. A more modern book; quite geometric, quite physical but mathematically rigorous. The exercises\n\nare quite difficult.</li>\n\n<li>Vladimir Arnol'd, <em>Ordinary Differential Equations</em>. This book is a very nice treatment of the geometry of differential equations, especially those\n\nforms which one would expect to see in physical situations.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"ug-geometry\">Geometry</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>George Birkhoff and Ralf Beatley, <em>Basic Geometry</em>. This is perhaps the best high school geometry book I know of, although much of it is quite\n\ndated in style and culturally USA-centric.</li>\n\n<li>Serge Lang and Gene Murrow, <em>Geometry: A High School Course</em>. Wait, a Lang book for high school students?! (Please allow me to repeat the standard\n\njoke: the reason Bourbaki stopped writing new textbooks is that he realised Lang was just one person.) (516 L27)</li>\n\n<li>Jin Akiyama and Kiyoko Matsunagam, <em>Trecks into Intuitive Geometry: The World of Polygons and Polyhedra</em>. Tilings, polytopes, origami, and other\n\nrelated subjects for a secondary school audience, plus a tutorial on how to transform a pig into ham. Only the second worst example of a book on this page for\n\nauthor-drawn artwork of faces (but I seem to have at some point deleted the rather harsh comments I had about the other book, probably for the best). It's a very\n\nnice book though. Wow!\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<h2><a id=\"upper-level-undergraduate-texts-stage-iii\">Higher undergraduate books</h2>\n\n<h3><a id=\"mathematical-logic-315\">Mathematical logic</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A. G. Hamilton, <em>Logic for Mathematicians</em>. This is the text for the logic paper I took in undergraduate, it failed to keep my attention but I think that's a feature of most\n\nlogic books.</li>\n\n<li>H.-D. Ebbinghaus, J. Flum, and W. Thomas, <em>Mathematical Logic</em>. I slightly prefer this to Hamilton. Perhaps if I leave it under my pillow I will learn to like logic via osmosis.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"algebra-320\">Algebra</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>M. A. Armstrong, <em>Groups and Symmetry</em>. A very geometric book. It's similar in philosophy to Jänich's topology book <a href=\"#topology\">below</a>, in that it's less\n\nrigorous than one would really like for third year. Essentially a lot of treatment of group actions.</li>\n\n<li>Nathan Carter, <em>Visual Group Theory</em>. This book is worth finding in the library for the pictures, which simply do not exist in most other books. However,\n\nthe actual development of the theory is done much better in other books.</li>\n\n<li>Joseph Gallian, <em>Contemporary Abstract Algebra</em>. Lots of computational exercises. Some \"topic\" readings at the back\n\n(Galois theory, crystal point groups, etc), but not enough mathematics is developed to make them worthwhile (his stated goal is something like showing off\n\nalgebra as a modern and up-to-date subject, but he doesn't do enough group and field theory to be able to introduce anything beyond a short historical sketch).\n\nI can't stand this book: he spends so much time doing computational examples that he hardly gets around to the algebra! Worth buying? No. (Also, it's disgustingly\n\nexpensive.) The library has copies if you feel you need it.</li>\n\n<li>Charles Pinter, <em>A Book of Abstract Algebra</em>. Introductory book. Lots of interesting exercises covering both applications\n\nand pure mathematics: the proof of the structure theorem for abelian groups is left as a structured set of exercises, for example. Also very cheap.</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Michael Artin, <em>Algebra</em>. This is the best introductory algebra book I know of. Lots of geometry (e.g. he classifies all of the motions of the plane).\n\nFocuses heavily on linear algebra. Maybe a little light on the proofs (not that he's not rigorous, but make sure you do the exercises, or you'll miss out\n\non stuff). Highlights include a chapter on Galois theory (first edition only) and a chapter on group representations.</li>\n\n<li>Ian Stewart, <em>Galois Theory</em>. Once you have an OK grounding in basic facts about groups, rings, and fields then this book is a readable\n\nintroduction to Galois theory. Famously full of typos. Later editions (3rd and 4th) start by proving everything over \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) before moving to arbitrary fields.\n\nCovers all the basic material (field extensions, proof of impossibility of general solutions to the quintic using radicals). Plenty of exercises, computational\n\nones as well.</li>\n\n<li>Harold M. Edwards, <em>Galois Theory</em>. This is very classical. I have not read it in detail, though I found the first few chapters enlightening. I would like\n\nto find the time to read it at some point, but likely as part of a reading group.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"combinatorics-and-finite-geometry-326\">Combinatorics and finite geometry</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Miklos Bona, <em>A Walk Through Combinatorics</em>. This is a very good introduction to combinatorics. Cute book, but a little pricey. Version in the library is an\n\nolder edition without design theory. Perhaps a bit chatty and slow to get started, but does cover a lot of random topics that should be of interest both for computer\n\nscience and mathematics.</li>\n\n<li>Bela Bollobas, <em>Modern Graph Theory</em>; Reinhard Diestel, <em>Graph Theory</em>. Very nice graph theory books. I prefer Bollobas, but Diestel is more modern. Overall\n\nI do think that these books are in more in the Erdős-esque camp of mathematical exposition. (Of course Bollobas was also a Hungarian prodigy, so that makes some sense I suppose.)</li>\n\n<li>W.D. Wallis, <em>Combinatorial Designs</em>. This book is a very nice introduction to finite geometries and other combinatorial designs. Very readable, a little old.</li>\n\n<li>Matthias Beck and Sinai Robins with David Austin, <em>Computing the Continuous Discretely</em>. A very readable introduction to polytope combinatorics for undergraduates. Repackages\n\na lot of the stuff in Stanley's book on combinatorial commutative algebra and in Ziegler's book in a form digestable with minimal algebra. Very nice little UTM.\n\n<li>Branko Grünbaum and G. C. Sheppard, <em>Tilings &amp; Patterns</em>. Introduction to the combinatorics of symmetries with a very low bar to entry; lots of very nice pictures.\n\nI would compare it with Coxeter's book on convex polytopes (see below in the <a href=\"#pg-combinatorics-polytopes\">section on polytopes</a>), if you like one then you'll like the other. The open problems are a bit outdated.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"number-theory\">Number theory</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Gareth A. Jones and J. Mary Jones, <em>Elementary Number Theory</em>. This is a step up from Dudley (see in the <a href=\"#elementary-number-theory-255\">elementary number theory section</a> above). There are some very interesting\n\nproblems in here, but the typesetting really annoys me. Don't let the easy nature of the first few chapters fool you. For chapter 5, our lecturer\n\ngave all the proofs via ring theory; if you know some algebra, write down these proofs yourself (they follow from the fact that a cyclic ring can be\n\ndecomposed into a product of cyclic rings of prime power order; see, for example, Ireland &amp; Rosen) and compare with the ones in here. (512.7 J77)</li>\n\n<li>Kenneth Ireland and Michael Rosen, <em>A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory</em>. This is the classic modern number theory book. It does start\n\na little slowly, but it eventually gets to elliptic curves and even proves the Mordell-Weil theorem over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). It is in this\n\nsection and not the graduate section below because of how self-contained it is: the bare minimum of algebra is needed (basic knowledge of groups, rings, and fields\n\nat, say, the level of Pinter).</li>\n\n<li>Fernando Q. Gouvêa, <em>\\(p\\)-adic Numbers</em>. This book focuses on the metric structure of the \\(p\\)-adic numbers; it mainly develops the basic theory for its\n\nown intrinsic interest. Unfortunately spends a lot of time trying to avoid doing any commutative algebra, and I found it very slow.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"single-variable-analysis-332\">Single-variable analysis</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Kenneth R. Davidson and Allan P. Donsig, <em>Real Analysis and Applications</em>. For an introduction to real analysis for someone who didn't learn calculus\n\nfrom Spivak or a comparable book this might be a better choice than Rudin, I\n\nfind it incredibly readable, it has a very nice tone, plenty of interesting exercises and examples, and the bits which depend on linear algebra are done\n\na lot better than Rudin (but in less generality). I also like the second half (on applications).\n\n<p>Let me compare it directly with Rudin: Rudin is shorter, denser, and deeper; D&amp;D is longer, friendlier, more detailed, and covers slightly less material.\n\n<p>One complaint: there is no explicit construction of the real numbers. (They try to explain a construction via decimal expansions in a very\n\nhandwavy way; there is also almost an outline of a construction via Cauchy sequences in exercise 2.8.L; I know that Tao does this same construction\n\nin the same kind of detail as the rest of D&amp;D, so it might be an idea to look there for this material. Or in Rudin, or Landau.)\n\n<p>Like Jones &amp; Jones in the number theory section, this is another new Springer book with really annoying typesetting, but to a lesser degree. (*)</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Walter Rudin, <em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em>. The first eight chapters are an incredibly clean and terse exposition of metric space theory.\n\nPeople I know have called it dry, but I didn't actually find it that bad - it is a little lacking in motivation, so maybe it would be a good idea\n\nto pick up a shiny book like Davidson &amp; Donsig above as well for historical details and more examples. (I personally used a mixture of the two when\n\nI learned real analysis.)\n\n<p>I prefer Loomis &amp; Sternberg for multivariable analysis. (I did try to work through chapter 9, and despite knowing what he was trying to do at every\n\npoint it's incredibly clunkly and awful. Belive me, I thought the Chicago bibliography would be exaggerating on this\n\npoint, but it turns out that they were entirely correct.) (<a href=\"https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/ug.hndts/#Rudin\">Errata and notes</a>)\n\n</li>\n\n<li>A.N. Kolmogorov and S.V. Fomin, <em>Introductory Real Analysis</em>. This is not an introductory textbook; it is a high-level geometric (in the Russian\n\nsense) view of real analysis (in particular, metric space theory). There is plenty of topology, some nice differential equations, and a lot of very\n\npretty mathematics.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"topology\">Topology</h3>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"topology-ps\">Point-set topology.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Klaus Jänich, <em>Topology</em>. An easy introduction to topology which isn't rigorous enough for a third- or fourth-year course (and probably not appropriate\n\nfor anyone that's actually done any proper analysis, it's very handwavy), but it does have some very nice pictures. I liked it in first year when I\n\nwanted to learn more about topology.</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">James R. Munkres, <em>Topology</em>. This is the standard topology book, it's very clear with lots of examples and pictures. I didn't like the section on\n\nmetric spaces, though - use Rudin here, it's a good supplement. Kolmogorov &amp; Fomin is also nice to read alongside.\n\n<p>Having thought about it for a while, I think it's incredibly likely that this is the textbook I have spent the most time with over the past year:-\n\nit was used in the topology course I took in 2018, and I must have spent at least an hour a day with it, doing readings or problems. Unfortunately the algebraic topology\n\npart is not so good, it is very short and does not do the subject justice (it is overly technical, I think).\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://drorbn.net/index.php?title=10-327/Errata_to_Munkres%27_Book\">Errata</a>)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"topology-gt\">Geometric topology.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Jeffrey R. Weeks, <em>The Shape of Space</em>. This is supposed to \"fill the gap\" between the simple geometric examples of topology (Klein bottles, tori) and\n\nthe \"sophisticated mathematics of upper-level courses\". I don't think it does this job very well, but it is a very nice book of geometry that might even\n\nbe accessible to the layperson. What I would like to see is a book like this that makes explicit the actual links with point-set topology.\n\n<p><em>I wrote the previous review in 2018, here is an update for 2021:</em> Of coure what Weeks meant (and I didn't understand at the time) was to link <em>algebraic topology</em>\n\nand not <em>point-set topology</em> to the explicit geometry of Thurston etc. I can even name a book which does this with more sophistication (Weeks is really a book\n\nfor an interested first year student): Bredon's <em>Geometry and Topology</em> which I talk about <a href=\"#alg-top\">below</a>.\n\n<li>David Mumford, Caroline Series, and David Wright, <em>Indra's Pearls: The vision of Felix Klein</em>. Another highly visual book, this time about Schottky groups (the easiest of all the Kleinian groups)\n\nand their fractal limit sets. Ends up discussing the Maskit slice (the moduli space of punctured torus groups). A lot of computer experiments too (the <a href=\"http://klein.math.okstate.edu/IndrasPearls/\">website\n\nfor the book</a> has some more stuff, if you dig through the Wayback Machine there is also an archive of FORTRAN-77 code which took a little work to get going on a modern compiler like <tt>gfortran</tt>).\n\nSee also the lecture <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOMr4eviQWs\">The Suggestive Power of Pictures</a></em> (Caroline Series).\n\n<li>Francis Bonahon, <em>Low-Dimensional Geometry: From Euclidean Surfaces to Hyperbolic Knots</em>. This is a rigorous geometric topology book for undergraduates: the basic theory\n\nof Kleinian groups and hyperbolic surfaces, culminating in a short discussion of 3-geometry. Requires very little technical background, it even develops the needed group theory from scratch.\n\n<li>Richard Evan Schwartz, <em>Mostly Surfaces</em>. Another surfaces book for undergraduates assuming very very little technical background, this time heading towards Teichmüller theory.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">George K. Francis, <em>A Topological Picturebook</em>. How to draw topological pictures by hand: knot theory, mapping class groups, sphere inversions, etc. I appreciated this book when I was\n\nan undergraduate.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"complex-calculus-and-analysis-340-341\">Complex calculus and analysis</h3>\n\n<p>The first few books here, broadly speaking, are complex calculus books; the latter books are complex analysis books.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Stephen D. Fisher, <em>Complex Variables</em>. The main problem with this book is that it's trying to be both a rigorous book and a\n\ncalculus book and failing miserably at both. I don't hate the sections on the geometry of analytic functions (chapter 3), but\n\nchapters 1 and 2 attempt to build the basic theory of analytic and holomorphic functions without using phrases like 'uniformly convergent'.\n\nThe main mechanism used for this is Green's Theorem (for double integrals), and I found it unsatisfying and insufficient. Further,\n\na non-negligible number of the problems seem to be pitched at a higher level of rigour than the proofs in the text (either that, or\n\none must hand-wave away enough topology that they become trivial). There are a minimum of examples.</li>\n\n<li>E.B. Saff and A.D. Snider, <em>Fundamentals of Complex Analysis for Mathematics, Sci...etc.</em> Basically a calculus book, so if you like Stewart\n\nor Anton you'll probably like this. I don't hate it, and I found it useful for complex calculus, if a little dry. The problems are much better\n\nthan Fisher (in that they fit the style of the book). More examples than Fisher. It's a bit expensive, because it's a calculus book...</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Tristan Needham, <em>Visual Complex Analysis</em>. This book attempts to construct complex analysis purely geometrically. It is quite successful\n\nin building intuition, but there are no proofs at all and a number of theorems are only (strongly) hinted at rather than stated - even important ones\n\nlike Cauchy's theorem. It has the great advantage of doing an awful lot of geometry.\n\n<p>\n\nIn 2021 Needham published a second book like this, <em>Visual Differential Geometry and Forms: A Mathematical Drama in Five Acts</em> - I haven't had a chance to look\n\nat it yet, but judging by VCA it should be worth looking at.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>Elias Wegert, <em>Visual Complex Functions</em>. Another visual book, of a different style to Needham. This book develops the theory with proper\n\nproofs, and has a much more analytic flavour. The tool of choice here is the 'graph' (in some sense) of the complex function; this is in\n\ncontrast to Needham's approach via differentiation. Another difference from Needham is that the theory is developed at a higher technical level\n\nwith full proofs given and with a much more analytical flavour (fully motivated); and the amount of material beyond just basic complex calculus is also more than\n\nthat found in Needham (including a study of Riemann surfaces). The discussions of harmonic and conformal functions are also very interesting.\n\n<li>John Conway, <em>Functions of One Complex Variable I</em>. This is a very classic book which is often recommended as an undergraduate complex analysis book. I found it book\n\nto be readable, but very slow.</li>\n\n<li>Lars Ahlfors, <em>Complex Analysis</em>. This is a little old-fashioned, but very geometric. My main issue is that everything is done by partial\n\ndifferentiation and differential forms; there is also not a lot of emphasis on series representations (analyticity) in the first\n\nhalf of the book.\n\n<p><em>I wrote the previous remarks in 2018, here is an update for 2021:</em> (1) To add to what I said, because of the reliance on differential forms\n\nyou probably should have had a read of one of the multivariable calculus books like Spivak first. (2) What I said was an issue is now (I think) a good thing:\n\nthe language of differential forms is a very pleasant way to phrase complex analysis. The simplest manifestation of this is, of course, the\n\nstatement of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in this language: they just become \\( \\frac{df}{d\\overline{z}} = 0 \\). In any case this is now my preferred treatment\n\nof <em>geometric</em> complex analysis (but I still prefer Rudin overall, it's just such a nice book). I should of course say that the downside of the differential\n\nform language is that it is much less accessible to the beginner, and this is my excuse for not being so positive three years ago - I also remember taking\n\na complex calculus (not analysis) course in 2018 where the lecturer very clearly would much rather have been teaching a course for mathematics majors instead (I was\n\nin it by mistake, I misunderstood the course structure) and spent most of the time going off on tangents including one about how the \"derivative with respect to \\(\\overline{z}\\)\" language (more\n\nproperly called the Wirtinger derivative --- yes, the same Wilhelm Wirtinger as the knot group presentation). I really disliked the course (the second most boring mathematics course\n\nI have ever taken) and so I really disliked this language. Here ends the story.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Walter Rudin, <em>Real and Complex Analysis</em>. From chapter 10, the best book on complex analysis I have found. It is possible to read\n\nthe complex analysis half, broadly speaking, without having read the real analysis half; one just needs to replace all the integration\n\ntheorems with less general theorems involving the Riemann integral.</li>\n\n<li>Umberto Bottazzini and Jeremy Gray, <em>Hidden harmony — Geometric fantasies. The rise of complex function theory</em>. And now for something completely different:\n\na very nice historical treatise on complex analysis which I have dipped into from time to time. The highlights include expositions of the history of Riemann surfaces,\n\nand uniformisation. See also Gray's biography of Henri Poincare.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"classical-geometry\">Classical geometry</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Robin Hartshorne, <em>Geometry: Euclid and Beyond</em>. Hartshorne follows Euclid, putting him on a firm axiomatic foundation. The capstone of the book is a discussion\n\nof polyhedra. You should have a little algebra for the last stretch, but the rest should actually be accessible to a high-school student!</li>\n\n<li>John M. Lee, <em>Axiomatic Geometry</em>. This book is like Hartshorne but in a much more formal style; it's written for future teachers, but it develops Euclidean\n\ngeometry (and only Euclidean geometry, although there is some hyperbolic stuff at the end) in a synthetic and formal way. I secretly quite like this book,\n\nbut I will never admit it. This is the book I use to look things up if I feel the urge to know how (for example) the inscribed angle theorem is proved. For some reason I prefer\n\nit to Hartshorne's similar book actually.</li>\n\n<li>Alfred S. Posamentier and Charles S. Salkind, <em>Challenging Problems in Geometry</em>. Heard of Ceva's theorem and want to know more? Want to learn some\n\ngeometry? Buy this (cheap) book and do all the problems. All are very good. Difficulty from school level upwards.</li>\n\n<li>Marta Sved, <em>Journey into Geometries</em>. This is a very strange book which motivates non-Euclidean geometry (hyperbolic geometry in particular) with\n\nthe characters of Alice in Wonderland. It's well worth the read.</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Harold Coxeter, <em>Introduction to Geometry</em> and <em>Geometry Revisited</em>. These books are both full of a lot of nice university geometry with some quite\n\nnice links to other subjects: for example, crystallography and biology. <em>Revisited</em> doesn't require any more than basic school geometry, but <em>Introduction</em>\n\nis quite sophisticated and difficult to read cover-to-cover as he uses a wide variety of techniques from different fields (group theory, linear algebra,\n\ncalculus) without any warning. It is very easy to expand a lot of what Coxeter says in half a page into hours of\n\nfruitful <del>messing about with a blackboard</del> thinking. (I have used part of <em>Intro.</em> as a basis for a set of NCEA level 3 geometry notes,\n\nand managed to expand three pages of Coxeter into around thirty pages of notes.) The discussion of differential geometry in <em>Intro.</em> is not so good, but that is\n\njust a small section - Coxeter was not a differential geometer, and he basically does differential geometry in the style of \"calculus applied to geometry\" (like do Carmo\n\nwhich I discuss <a href=\"#differential-geometry\">below</a>). It is still my favourite broad introduction to geometry.\n\n<p>\n\nSee also the entry on Escher under <a href=\"#culture\">culture</a> above.\n\n</li>\n\n<li>Harold Coxeter, <em>Projective Geometry</em>. A quite axiomatic view of projective geometry; not my favourite book by Coxeter, but still a nice read. More comprehensive\n\nthan the section of <em>Introduction</em> on projective geometry, but not as comprehensive as the chapters in Berger. Solid book.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Marcel Berger, <em>Geometry</em>. But this is my all-time favourite geometry book. It is a little long (two volumes), but you can dip in and out of it rather than\n\nreading linearly. There are many nice pictures, including of physical models; in addition, almost every geometric theorem I've ever seen in any paper\n\nis included here (although often under a different name). There are a lot of very pretty results in both affine and projective geometry. Linear algebra\n\nand group theory are used extensively (of course). The only things lacking, really, are the more combinatorial parts of the subject (things like polytope theory);\n\nalso, the section on elliptic and hyperbolic geometry is a little short. Really this is a book on classical geometry, and you need to look elsewhere for curved geometries ---\n\nfor instance, in Berger's more recent <emph>A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry</emph> (which is at a higher level, of course).</li>\n\n<li>Marcel Berger, <em>Geometry Revealed</em>. A more modern book by Berger, this one is focused more on convexity and combinatorial geometry. I have not spent too much time with it (since I have not had access\n\nto a paper copy since I was in Toronto - I am less and less comfortable giving money to Springer directly and all the second hand copies cost far too much money) but it looks really good.\n\n<li>Tom Apostol and Mamikon Mnatsakanian, <em>New Horizons in Geometry</em>. I would describe this as `Archimedean' geometry: calculus applied to problems in classical\n\ngeometry (isoparimetric problems, lines sweeping out curves, liquids flowing out of containers...). Very very nice book which I enjoyed in first year (and still enjoy now). A bit expensive but\n\noverall a well-made book (worth the price).\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"algebraic-geometry-334\">Algebraic geometry for undergraduates</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Miles Reid, <em>Undergraduate algebraic geometry</em>. I find this book overly informal and chatty to the point of annoyance, but it is a very easy\n\nread if you like that kind of book.</li>\n\n<li>David Cox, John Little, and Donal O'Shea, <em>Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms</em>. A very popular book. I don't like it so much but it's just a matter\n\nof taste. It treats the subject too much as an extension of linear algebra for my liking (which is a fair enough way of doing things), really my issue\n\nis that there is very little of the kind of geometry which I like (and very little application of algebraic geometry to geometry at all - which makes sense\n\ngiven the authors, who are interested in problems like solving systems of equations).\n\n<li>Audun Holme, <em>A Royal Road to Algebraic Geometry</em>. This is a very gentle introduction to the subject that is very well-motivated if you have some\n\nexperience with projective geometry and classical algebraic geometry (c.f. Kendig's <em>Conics</em> below). Unfortunately the second half seems to be completely\n\nunedited and is full of typos and mistakes which make it almost unreadable if you are trying to learn the subject.</li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Joe Harris, <em>Algebraic Geometry: A first course</em>. This is my favourite introductory book. I think there is a good range of\n\ncontent and it has the advantage too of doing a lot of geometry (compared to Reid or the book by Cox/Little/O'Shea). It includes a\n\nvery readable proof of Bezout's theorem (chapter 18), a vast number of interesting examples of varieties contructed in ways other\n\nthan just taking a random polynomial (he constructs Grassmannians, scrolls, flag manifolds, determinantal varieties, various\n\ngroup varieties,...), and spends some time motivating various constructions rather than just stating them. On the other\n\nhand it is a bit light on some proofs but I think that this is a tradeoff that has to be made in writing an introduction to this\n\nsubject given how abstract it can be. Of course he also assumes everything is algebraically closed, I think the alternative requires\n\na lot of attention to technical detail and is best left to scheme theory.</li>\n\n<li>Igor Shafarevich, <em>Basic Algebraic Geometry I</em>. A Russian algebraic geometry book, also one of my favourites. It is more comprehensive than Harris (e.g. there is a proof of\n\nthe Riemann-Roch theorem for curves, a more careful study of intersection numbers, and lots of stuff on differential forms) and I tend to oscillate between which one I prefer.\n\nOn the other hand, it has the feeling of a book on algebraic geometry written by an analyst (I am not sure why, since Shafarevich was an arithmetic geometer!) and is very very classical,\n\nunlike Harris which develops more rigid intuition (I know this is very vague and I apologise) and the result is that I think Harris is a better book for budding pure algebraic geometers\n\nwhile Shafarevich is better for those who want to apply algebraic geometry to other parts of mathematics (beyond number theory, of course, which is more rigid). This kind of explains why\n\nI don't like volume 2 (on schemes) so much --- I write about this <a href=\"#pg-ag-sch\">below</a> in the section on scheme theory.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Keith Kendig, <em>Conics</em>. This book is everything you always suspected about conic sections and it is amazing. It is basically at the level of a good secondary\n\nschool student who has basic calculus, and leads in the direction of algebraic geometry.</li>\n\n<li>George Salmon, <em>A Treatise on Conic Sections</em>. If you read Kendig and want to know more, this book (from the 1800s) is very good but a little difficult to read\n\ndue to its age. Try to make Salmon's statements precise with projective geometry and/or complex algebra.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"differential-geometry\">Differential geometry.</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Manfred do Carmo, <em>Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces</em>. Differential geometry, without any more machinery than multivariable\n\ncalculus. Quite dry, very computational and really very little geometry. My complaints about Fisher's book on complex calculus <a href=\"#complex-calculus-and-analysis-340-341\">above</a> apply to this\n\nbook as well: it is written in the style of a calculus book trying to be rigorous and in the process being bad at both.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<h2><a id=\"postgraduate-texts\">Postgraduate texts</h2>\n\n<h3><a id=\"pg-algebra\">Algebra</h3>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-algebra-gen\">General algebra.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Joseph Rotman, <em>Advanced Modern Algebra</em>. This book is supposed to be very good, but something about it annoys me.\n\nI'm not too sure what the problem is: maybe it's a little too chatty, and it motivates everything (at least initially)\n\nwith number theory? I will come back to it at some point, maybe I will like it better.</li>\n\n<li>Serge Lang, <em>Algebra</em>. I like the ability to open up at a random page and begin to work without needing to read\n\nthe previous hundred pages; I dislike the confusing text, lack of detail, incredibly imprecise cros-references (\"this was proved in chapter 6\" with no further details) and\n\nthe inconsistent level of difficulty. Before Aluffi, though, this was really the only properly comprehensive algebra book.\n\n<p>\n\nPerhaps here is the best place to link to the famous <a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-70/issue-4/Review-Serge-Lang-Diophantine-geometry/bams/1183526083.full\">review of a Lang book by Mordell</a> (for completeness, here is <a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-76/issue-6/Review-L-J-Mordell-Mordell-Diophantine-equations/bams/1183532391.full\">Lang's subsequent review</a> of Mordell's book, and <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/dmvm-1994-0407/pdf\">an article by Lang in DMV Mitteilungen</a>).\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Paulo Aluffi, <em>Algebra: Chapter 0</em>. This is the book which has replaced Lang as my reference book for basic facts in algebra. Instead of expecting the reader to learn category\n\ntheory by osmosis (like Lang does), Aluffi introduces it in a very practical way; the exercises are excellent, the book is very well-written. Highly highly recommended. Lots of connections\n\ngiven to various areas of mathematics (e.g. some basic algebraic geometry; some number theory; some topology).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-algebra-grp\">Group theory.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Joseph J. Rotman, <em>An Introduction to the Theory of Groups</em>. A first group theory book with all the things you would expect (Sylow theorems, finite linear groups, free groups, etc.). There\n\nare decent examples and usually motivation for various techniques is clearly explained. It is quite biased towards finite group theory.\n\n<li>John D. Dixon, <em>Problems in Group Theory</em>. A problem book in elementary group theory (i.e. the level of Rotman). Again, I am not a group theorist so you might like it more than me.\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-algebra-cat\">Category theory</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>William Lawvere and Stephen Schanuel, <em>Conceptual Mathematics</em>. The ambiguous title hides that this is a book on\n\ncategory theory, written primarily to appeal to undergraduates with limited experience with the traditional motivating\n\ntopics like algebraic topology. I remember trying to read it a couple of years ago and being annoyed by the lack of\n\nexamples (the main theatre of examples used is the study of diagrams themselves); but if you can come up with your\n\nown examples then it is likely a nice friendly introduction. For this reason it would be nice to have this book as\n\nan alternative, but not as a replacement, for something like Mac Lane.</li>\n\n<li>Horst Herrlich and George E. Strecker, <em>Category Theory</em>. This book is very well-motivated with lots of examples. More for computer science though.</li>\n\n<li>Jiří Adámek; Horst Herrlich; and George E Strecker, <em>Abstract and Concrete Categories</em>. This book is also well-motivated but in\n\na different sense. The illustrations are amusing and the book has a sense of humour. Now a Dover book.</li>\n\n<li>Saunders Mac Lane, <em>Categories for the Working Mathematician</em>. This is the standard introductory text. You really need a good sense of the fields where he draws\n\nexamples from (algebraic topology mainly), and it is a little dry. I would recommend Aluffi as an introductory text nowadays if you don't have this background.</li>\n\n<li>Saunders Mac Lane and Ieke Moerdijk, <em>Sheaves in Geometry and Logic</em>. Applications of pure category theory to logic, algebraic topology, and algebraic geometry. Very\n\nreadable book, surprisingly so given how abstract this stuff can get.\n\n<li>Denis-Charles Cisinski, <em>Higher Categories and Homotopical Algebra</em>. When you finish Mac Lane/Moerdijk, you can read this: an introduction to \\(\\infty\\)-categories. I must confess\n\nthat this is the point at which I feel the abstraction beginning to overcome me.\n\n<li>Jacob Lurie, <em>Higher Topos Theory</em> (and other such books). But wait, there's more. Just as the Chicago bibliography draws the arbitrary line for \"difficulty\" at\n\nHartshorne (\"difficulty level unbounded above...\"), I draw the line here. I have come past the point where Hartshorne looks legendarily difficult, and now it is this set of\n\nbooks by Lurie which are the ones that, to me, feel legendarily abstract.\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-algebra-lim\">Linear algebra.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>W. H. Greub, <em>Linear Algebra</em> and <em>Multilinear Algebra</em>. Part of me is unsure whether you can really put a section on linear algebra in a list of\n\npostgraduate books (and surely such a section would be called \"commutative algebra\"!), but this book talks about universal properties and such things so I would\n\nsay it is more at the level of Aluffi's treatment of linear algebra than Poole's (even if the content is similar in the linear algebra part, culminating in such\n\nexotic things as unitary maps and quadrics). Actually, looking again now it has some graded spaces and homology so I should stop complaining!\n\n<p>I want to mention this here because I remember being in the <a href=\"gerstein.jpg\">Gerstein library</a> looking at books and I picked this one up and was so utterly confused by the definition\n\nof the tensor product via the universal property. (For the longest time I thought that the book I remembered was a book by Lang on linear algebra, but I just looked\n\nat a PDF of the third edition of his UTM and he seems not to mention tensor products in there. Greub is my second guess as to what book it is, but perhaps it was an\n\nolder edition of Lang. Or some other book - I definitely remember it was a Springer book, though.)\n\n<p>\n\nIn any case this is a nice reference. How does the Chicago bibliography put it... \"One day, you may just have to know fifteen different ways to decompose a linear map into parts\n\nwith different nice properties. On that day, your choices are Greub and Bourbaki. Greub is easier to carry.\" I don't think I can improve on that. On the other hand, nowadays I would\n\npick up Aluffi first before I tried Greub - Aluffi is just an all-round good reference for this kind of thing.\n\n<li>While I am here I might as well mention Steven Roman, <em>Advanced Linear Algebra</em>. Primarily because it has a chapter on the umbral calculus. (Otherwise it is not as comprehensive as Greub.)\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-algebra-com\">Commutative algebra.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>M. F. Atiyah and I. G. Macdonald, <em>Introduction to Commutative Algebra</em>. A little book with everything you will ever need to know about commutative algebra if you are applying it\n\nto other subjects, and enough to show the interest of the subject. The exercises are very good and contain many applications, including a basic introduction to scheme theory (which was really\n\nnew at the time of writing). As a book it's very much like Rudin, very telegraphic style where you should be trying to cover up the theorems and prove them yourself; one problem with this\n\nis that there is very little motivation if you aren't coming from an area where you are actively seeing a lot of these results applied. If you look at a book like Joe Harris' undergrad AG\n\nbook (or even Hartshorne) there's very little commutative algebra used in the basic part of the subject (even getting a bit into scheme theory, the \"commutative algebra\" theorems which\n\nHartshorne uses are numbered in the low teens - there's an appendix at the end which lists all of them - and you don't need to know the proofs at all, which use very different techniques).\n\nI think the best path to take is to start learning the applications you're interested in and then once you have explicit motivation for commutative algebra to come back and spend a couple\n\nof months reading Atiyah and Macdonald. <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/q/42241/150082\">Errata</a></li>\n\n<li class=\"fav\">David Eisenbud, <em>Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry</em>. This is my favourite mathematics book of all time. Not an introductory text (see Atiyah-Macdonald for that),\n\nbut a book about applying commutative algebra to geometry and number theory. Particular highlights include the chapters on filtrations, Hensel's lemma, flat families, and dimension theory. The exercises\n\nare also very interesting: they tend to be applications, generalisations, or intuition-building. For instance, the Cayley-Bacharach theorem appears as an exercise, as do many different forms of the\n\nNullstellensatz.</li>\n\n<li>Richard P. Stanley, <em>Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra</em>; Ezra Miller and Bernd Sturmfels, <em>Combinatorial Commutative Algebra</em>. Applications of combinatorics to commutative algebra,\n\nand vice versa. Primarily the combinatorics involved is that of polytopes and more general complexes. As products of the theory you get things like counting magic squares, Ehrhart reciprocity (which\n\ncounts the interior points of a lattice polytope), and McMullen's \\(g\\)-theorem (characterising the possible face numbers of simplicial polytopes). Very much like the book of Stanley, it has a lot\n\nof nice geometric motivation, the book of Miller and Sturmfels is not so exciting and is less geometric (it is more interested in answering purely algebraic problems and has less motivation).\n\n<li>M. Scott Osborne, <em>Basic Homological Algebra</em>. Very fast introduction to homological algebra and ext and tor (for an even faster one, see the appendix to Eisenbud). Very little motivation and no\n\napplications, but if you need to learn homological algebra by tomorrow this is the book for you. On the other hand this is yet another topic done incredibly well by Aluffi.\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-algebra-rep\">Rings and group representations.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>T.Y. Lam, <em>A First Course in Noncommutative Rings</em> and <em>Lectures on Modules and Rings</em>. These are two excellent books on non-commutative ring theory, which I found very useful\n\nfor the ring theory half of 721. They are probably not very useful to the average student who is just learning algebra, who should probably be reading the ring theory parts of Aluffi or a commutative\n\nalgebra book like Atiyah and Macdonald first; but to the student who already knows what the basic theory of group representations looks like (e.g. they understand the importance of adjectives like\n\nsemisimple) or has already learned commutative ring theory (e.g. they understand things like the Jacobson radical) these are excellent books and they make the theory very appealing. The <em>First Course</em>\n\ncovers essentially the generalisations to non-commutative rings of very familar concepts: Noetherian and Artinian rings, local rings, semisimple rings. The <em>Lectures</em> cover homology theory (projective\n\nand injective modules, for example) and other generalisations of concepts which we see in geometry like flat families and localisations.\n\n<li>J.-P. Serre, <em>Representations of Finite Groups</em>. The first half is a fast and clean general first introduction to representation theory for finite groups: Maschke's theorem, Schur's lemma,\n\ncharacter theory, group algebras. The remaining portions of the book are more specialised, discussing the representation theorems of Brauer; I have not had much use for these later sections, since they\n\ndo not seem to involve ideas which are applicable outside of the finite setting. This isn't my favourite book by Serre, I suspect part of the problem is that it is several different things glued together\n\nin one book.\n\n<li>William Fulton and Joe Harris, <em>Representation Theory: A First Course</em>. This is a useful book that has a small amount of finite representation theory and then a good chunk of Lie group\n\nrepresentation theory. It is a nice first book on Lie groups if you are coming from a heavily algebraic background. However, if you are used to books by Harris it should come as no surprise that it's\n\nessentially written as an exploration through a bunch of examples and building only as much theory as is needed to do each example as it comes. This means that it's not so useful as a book to look\n\nthings up in later (unless you want something that is specifically an example which they cover). <em>Note:</em> Below, there is a <a href=\"#pg-lie\">separate section</a> on Lie groups.\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-lie\">Lie groups and algebras.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Brian C. Hall, <em>Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations</em>. This is an elementary book which covers only the case of matrix Lie groups, and takes a very concrete view throughout. It\n\nalso emphasises the role of the groups rather than the Lie algebras (many other introductory books, e.g. that of Humphreys, primarily focus on representation theory of the Lie algebras rather than\n\nthe global geometry). If your goal is to very quickly get to the definitions of Weyl groups and roots, you can easily skim large parts of this book very quickly and pick up some minimal machinery\n\nin order to look at the semisimple theory without spending weeks and weeks trying to get through technical background.\n\n<li>Anthony Knapp, <em> Lie Groups Beyond an Introduction</em>. This is a more detailed book on representations of Lie groups and algebras. It is very well motivated with detailed examples at the start of the book\n\nand also before many of the technical sections where the theory is worked out 'in advance' for certain special groups in order to prepare the reader and hint at what is to come. There are also a\n\ngreat number of interesting exercises.\n\n<li>Andreas Arvanitoyeorgos, <em>An introduction to Lie groups and the geometry of homogeneous spaces</em>. Assuming basic theory of smooth manifolds (e.g. tangent vectors and differentials),\n\na compact study of Lie groups and coset spaces. The writing is very concrete and readable and does not get bogged down in functional analysis or representation theory.\n\n<li>Sigurdur Helgason, <em>Differential geometry, Lie groups, and symmetric spaces</em>. Classification in full detail of semisimple Lie groups and symmetric spaces, especially focused on\n\nthe Riemannian geometry of these objects.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"pg-nt\">Number theory</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>J.-P. Serre, <em>A Course in Arithmetic</em>. Two halves, the first half is algebraic and studies the classification of quadratic forms over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) (the Hasse-Minkowski theorem), in the process\n\nhe studies very basic local class field theory. Very short and clean. Second half is analytic and deals with arithmetic progressions and modular forms - I haven't looked at those parts in detail.\n\n<li>Daniel Coray, <em>Notes on Geometry and Arithmetic</em>. An introduction to arithmetic geometry for people who've not seen algebraic geometry before. A very nice introduction to things like the \\(p\\)-adic numbers,\n\nthe Hasse principle, and diophantine problems.\n\n<li>Z.I. Borevich and Igor R. Shafarevich, <em>Number Theory</em>. Yet another first introduction to local class field theory and the Hasse-Minkowski theorem. I am more inclined towards geometry so prefer this\n\nto Serre. In the Russian style, if that's your thing.\n\n<li>Toshitsune Miyake, <em>Modular Forms</em>. This book does very little to motivate modular forms (see <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/q/24604/150082\">this post on MO</a> for that);\n\nthey are essentially functions on \\( \\mathbb{H}^2 \\) preserved under arithmetic symmetries. This is a fairly thick book of basic results and applications to arithmetic number theory.\n\n<li>Pierre Guillot, <em>A Gentle Course in Local Class Field Theory</em>. Yet another introduction to local class field theory, this time even more gentle. For such a friendly book there is a lack\n\nof exercises, but there is plenty of motivation.\n\n<li>J.-P. Serre, <em>Local Fields</em>. Serre clearly sat down and thought to himself, \"all of these students learning local class field theory have a severe lack of introductory books which\n\nare not gentle and friendly\"; this is the result. Actually it is not so bad (and really it is not supposed to be an introductory book, so I am being unfair). Anyway, it is another book about\n\nlocal class field theory.\n\n<li>Jürgen Neukirch, <em>Algebraic Number Theory</em>. Not only an introduction to local class field theory: this book includes the <emph>global</emph> theory too! Assumes only a little algebra and proves\n\nthe main local-to-global results. Very geometric, too, which is nice.\n\n<li>John Voight, <em>Quaternion Algebras</em>. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-56694-4\">Open access!</a> A nice friendly introduction to quaternion algebras over local and global\n\nfields, as well as the associated arithmetic group theory and 3-geometry, assuming even that you know none of those words beforehand. Prerequisites are probably just basic group theory &amp; number\n\ntheory, but a lot of breadth is covered and so the reader should be prepared. Every postgraduate student in algebra seems to have a copy now. (800 pages, not too dense though, and quite readable - can\n\ndip in and out). See also Maclachlan-Reid below in <a href=\"#ggt-geom\">geometric group theory</a> for a harder book on similar subjects.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"pg-combinatorics\">Combinatorics</h2>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-combinatorics-gen\">General combinatorics.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Martin Aigner, <em>Combinatorial Theory</em>; Jack Graver and Mark Watkins, <em>Combinatorics with emphasis on the theory of graphs</em>. These books are more algebraic in\n\nstyle than combinatoric, developing a more abstract theory and then applying it to combinatorial problems. Aigner studies mainly enumerative and order-theoretic combinatorics,\n\nand Graver/Watkinds studies mainly design-theoretic combinatorics, so together they kind of cover the whole field.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Richard P. Stanley, <em>Enumerative Combinatorics</em> (2 volumes). A very good reference on counting problems and the related techniques. The exercises are excellent\n\nintroductions to the applications (to representation theory, number theory, geometry, chess,...), worth reading in and of themselves. I must also mention the following rather odd fact\n\nwhich was noted on the Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gradtexmeme/\">Graduate Texts in Memes</a>: there is a Facebook profile under the name Richard Stanley which seems\n\nto spend most of the time posting pictures of small children reading this book. (I will not link it here because I feel uncomfortable linking what could be someone's\n\nprivate account.)\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-combinatorics-polytopes\">Polytopes.</strong> See also the books by Stanley and Miller/Sturmfels in the <a href=\"#pg-algebra-com\">commutative algebra section</a> above.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>H.S.M. Coxeter, <em>Regular Polytopes</em>. Another book by Coxeter that you need to read right now. Very classical introduction to polytopes, various constructions, and their symmetries.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Günter M. Ziegler, <em>Lectures on Polytopes</em>. A much more modern book on the algebraic theory of polytopes. Lots of nice applications of the theory, and very interesting historical\n\nnotes. This is the book you want to go along with the books on <a href=\"#pg-ag-tor\">toric geometry</a> below. (While I am thinking about it, you should also look at the book by Ewald below in that\n\nsection for another introduction to convex polytopes that I like.) Highly recommended.\n\n<li>Branko Grünbaum, <em>Convex Polytopes</em>. This is an incredibly comprehensive tome. The latest addition is annotated by Volker Kaibel, Victor Klee, and Günter M. Ziegler,\n\nand includes copious historical notes. I should really own a copy, I don't know why I haven't bought it yet.\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/04/26/my-copy-of-branko-grunbaums-convex-polytopes/\">An interesting blog post.</a>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"alg-top\">Algebraic topology</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Alan Hatcher, <em>Algebraic Topology</em>. <a href=\"http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html\">Free online.</a> Many people like this book, but it is not to my taste (I\n\nthink it is overly verbose) and this opinion is not particularly controversial. It is incredibly long but doesn't cover much (any?) more material than other books: the\n\nextra space is given over to many pictures and a lot of exposition.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Glen E. Bredon, <em>Topology and Geometry</em>. This is my favourite algebraic topology book, but I don't like the notation that much. More geometric than purely topological; I really like\n\nthe choices of topics. I think that Munkres' <em>Topology</em> plus some (rigorous) multivariable calculus (probably Spivak or Munkres) is the best preparation for this book.\n\n<li>John Lee, <em>Introduction to Topological Manifolds</em>. If you like Lee's writing style, this is probably the book for you. It is a little too differential-geometric rather than purely\n\ngeometric for my liking, but the material on covering spaces is very clear.\n\n<li>John Stillwell, <em>Classical Topology and Combinatorial Group Theory</em>. Essentially an introduction to homotopy theory from a combinatorial point of view rather than a topological one.\n\nIf you are more interested in heading towards knot theory and low-dimensional geometry and topology, this might be\n\nthe book for you. Also talks about related computational results (e.g. the word problem in groups).\n\n<li>Raoul Bott and Loring W. Tu, <em>Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology</em>. A very algebraic second course in algebraic topology, a lot of cohomology theory. Particularly algebraic in style. (Best preparation\n\nfor Hartshorne's chapter III, I think). Particularly nice is the lengthy motivating discussion, which is missing from many other textbooks.\n\n<li>Robert Ghrist, <em>Elementary Applied Topology</em>. A basic introduction to algebraic topology with applications to graph theory, computation theory, statistics, splines, and other fields. Put this\n\nin the category with Needham's <em>Visual Complex Analysis</em>.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"pg-diff\">Differential and Riemannian geometry</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>John Lee, <em>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</em>. 700 pages of pure differential geometry for the most gluttonous graduate student. Essentially an encyclopaedia. Even the pure differential geometers\n\nin the office agree: this is not a book you read, it is a book you look things up in if you can't find them elsewhere! Various people recommend Tu's book below, or the first two volumes of Spivak's\n\n<em>Comprehensive Introduction</em>, or (of course) anything by Milnor. My opinion is, this book is probably OK for a book to use during a course or some other situation where you have someone who knows\n\nthe subject well telling you what is and what isn't important, otherwise you will spend a year or two reading it and only then get to doing some interesting modern geometry.\n\n<li>John Lee, <em>Introduction to Riemannian Manifolds</em>. This one is only about 400 pages long, but just as dense as <em>Smooth</em>. Curvature is of course the main\n\nconcept here, covered in much detail. The notation annoys me.\n\n<li>Loring W. Tu, <em>Differential Geometry</em>. A comparably more friendly book on curvature and Riemannian geometry. The organisation annoys me a bit (it feels like slightly edited lecture notes\n\nrather than a book - really that should not be a problem and I like plenty of other books which come from lecture notes, I am not too sure what the real problem is here) but I suppose it will\n\nappeal to a lot of people. Overall I tend to prefer the books by Lee to the books by Tu (except for Bott and Tu versus Lee's <em>Topological</em>).\n\n<li>Marcel Berger, <em>A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry</em>. I like Berger's writing, this book is very very good; it is not a textbook,\n\nit is a guidebook to the theory, like what the book by Holme <a href=\"#algebraic-geometry-334\">below</a> on algebraic geometry was supposed to be. Unfortunate that it's published by Springer, I would like to own a quality hardcover\n\nbut they don't do that kind of thing any more.\n\n<li>Peter Petersen, <em>Riemannian Geometry</em>. Now into the third edition (but I have only looked at the first). I find this easier to read than Lee's Riemannian book; I would say it is closer\n\nto the writing style of Bredon's <em>Geometry and Topology</em> (see <a href=\"#alg-top\">algebraic topology</a> above). Unfortunately still uses the Einstein summation convention...\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"ggt\">Geometric group theory</h2>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"ggt-gen\">General books</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Martin R. Bridson and Andre Haefliger, <em>Metric Spaces of Non-positive Curvature</em>. General theory of geometric group actions in both the archimedean and non-archimedean case. A lot of applicability\n\nto hyperbolic geometry, and chapter \\( III.\\mathcal{G} \\) contains a very nice exposition of the covering space theory of orbifolds (I prefer the discussion here to that in Ratcliffe, and it is a complementary\n\napproach to that in chapter 13 of Thurston).\n\n<li>James E. Humphreys, <em>Linear Algebraic Groups</em>. The study of geometric groups (things like \\(\\mathrm{GL}(n,k)\\)) as geometric objects in their own right. Applications also to representation theory.\n\n<li>William Waterhouse, <em>Introduction to affine group schemes</em>. Introduction to SGA-style algebraic groups; contains a nice introduction to the functorial approach to scheme theory, which is a\n\nnice motivation for things like Yoneda's Lemma. He says that \"there is no prerequisite beyond a training in algebra including tensor products and Galois theory,\" but clearly \"algebra\" here means\n\ngraduate (i.e. Lang-level) algebra. I think that a decent amount of algebraic geometry is also a prerequisite to really getting what is going on; this is the advantage of Humphreys' book (which\n\nessentially develops the theory of varieties in-house, as it were). On the other hand this is a very nice introduction once you have got your head around the first couple of chapters of Hartshorne.\n\nAnother book I should really own but don't.\n\n<li>David B.A. Epstein et. al., <em>Word processing in groups</em>. The theory of automatic groups and broad theoretical computation aspects of combinatorial group theory. See <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/420294/group-theory-with-grep\">Group theory with <tt>grep</tt></a>.\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"ggt-arith\">Arithmetic flavour (e.g. buildings, \\(p\\)-adic fields).</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>J.-P. Serre, <em>Trees</em>. This is an introduction to the study of actions of free groups. You need to know a bit about the \\(p\\)-adics: the main goal is Ihara's theorem (every torsion-free subgroup\n\nof \\(\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Q}_p)\\) is a free group). This book will then lead you to the very basics of the theory of Bruhat-Tits buildings, which I might talk about below (I don't know yet). Essentially\n\nthe idea is to look at groups which act particularly on trees in such a way as to preserve the combinatorics.\n\n<li>Peter Abramenko and Kenneth S. Brown, <em>Buildings</em>. Indeed yes I will talk about buildings. Buildings are to geometric groups as schemes are to commutative rings (I suppose).\n\nVery attractive book which motivates the subject incredibly well, it makes me wish I had time to learn more of the theory in greater detail.\n\n<p>\n\nWhile here, I might as well mention the very nice expository paper <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2266\">A (very short) introduction to buildings</a></em> by Brett Everitt,\n\nand the <a href=\"https://buildings.gallery/\">Buildings Gallery</a> (Bram Bekker).\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"ggt-geom\">Geometric flavour (Kleinian groups and hyperbolic manifolds).</strong> See also the <a href=\"#ldg\">section on low-dimensional geometry</a> below.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Alan F. Beardon, <em>The Geometry of Discrete Groups</em>. A slow elementary introduction to Fuchsian groups (discrete subgroups of \\(\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R}) \\)) and their\n\nrelated complex and hyperbolic structures. Minimal topology needed. It doesn't really do enough interesting geometry for me, but it is a good start. The introduction to hyperbolic\n\ngeometry here is mainly useful as a reference for computational formulae. Other things which annoy me include that he has a bad habit of hinting that there are deeper things going\n\non without explaining anything (all the proofs are matrix algebra where things magically work out at the end) and the minimal examples and exercises (though there are not very many\n\nreally different Fuchsian groups so I'm not sure what else he could have done, really --- maybe if he didn't restrict to the surface theory so early there would be scope for more\n\ninterest). Because of these problems I would tend to recommend Bonahon (in the <a href=\"#ldg\">low-dimension geometry</a> section) for beginners/undergraduates unless you are really\n\ninto the linear algebra point of view.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Bernard Maskit, <em>Kleinian Groups</em>.\n\nCompared to Beardon, this is a much more demanding book. Maskit takes the philosophical point of view that the primary basic objects of study are conformal automorphisms of the Riemann\n\nsphere, rather than isometries or manifolds or matrix groups. His goal is to get to the classification of function groups, and he takes a straight line to get there from the definitions\n\nwith only a couple of deviations (one chapter on basic covering theory of Riemann surfaces which can safely be skipped, and one chapter on geometric examples which are interesting but\n\nquite limited). The first six chapters are basic general theory of discrete groups of isometries in Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometries, and the final four chapters are the exposition\n\nof the classification of B-groups and function groups.\n\n<p>\n\nThe book is missing some things which you would expect from a general textbook (e.g. no Lie theory like the Kazhdan-Margulis lemma, no knot groups, etc) and expects quite a bit of background\n\nin complex analysis and classical geometry (e.g. as you would learn from the textbook of Ahlfors). In my 2021 course we supplemented Maskit with Beardon, Kapovich, and Thurston's lecture notes\n\n(mainly chapter 7).\n\n<p>\n\nHe claims in the introduction that the core of the book (i.e. all but chapters III and VIII) work as a one-year postgraduate course, which is basically correct in my experience:\n\nwe covered the first six chapters in one semester (plus some additional background and content and minus some stuff that we skipped).\n\n<li>Ken'ichi Ohshika, <em>Discrete groups</em>.\n\nThis is a less wll-known elementary Kleinian groups book, which is different from others in that it is pitched at geometric group theorists. The point of view taken\n\nis that techniques from Kleinian group theory often require only properties true of groups with non-negative curvature. There are three chapters (plus one preliminary chapter):\n\nGromov-style hyperbolic group theory, the theory of automatic groups, and the basic theory of Kleinian groups (including the construction of B-groups which are geometrically infinite).\n\nThis could work well as a beginning graduate textbook in infinite group theory.\n\n<li>Katsuhiko Matsuzaki and Masahiko Taniguchi, <em>Hyperbolic manifolds and Kleinian groups</em>.\n\nThis book, which is a second course in Kleinian groups from the point of view of conformal analysis after reading the first half of Maskit or the whole of Beardon, deserves to\n\nbe much better-known. The main highlight of the book is a detailed exposition of quasiconformal deformation theory; Marden (in <em>Hyperbolic manolds</em>) does sketch a lot of\n\nthe theory but this book is the only real textbook (save maybe <em>Deformation Spaces</em> by Kra (chapter 4 of <em>A Crash Course on Kleinian Groups</em>, Springer LNM 400).\n\n<p>\n\nOther aspects of the book beyond the quasiconformal theory include very detailed expositions of cusp structure and limit set structure, infinite ends, and convergence questions, along with\n\nsome very nice pictures and diagrams. Unfortunately this book is very hard to come by without spending vast sums of money.\n\n<li>Michael Kapovich, <em>Hyperbolic Manifolds and Discrete Groups</em>.\n\nThis is another second course, which focuses much more on the algebra than the analysis or the geometry. It is essentially an exposition of a proof of Thurston's hyperbolisation theorem for\n\nHaken manifolds via a lot of interesting geometric group theory (moduli spaces of groups, measured laminations, the Bass-Serre theory of trees,...). This works as a second course\n\nfollowing a book like that of Ohskiha or Ratcliffe.\n\n<li>Colin Maclachlan and Alan W. Reid, <em>The Arithmetic of Hyperbolic 3-manifolds</em>. Of a slightly different flavour, this book is about Kleinian groups which happen to be arithmetic.\n\nVery dense and quite hard: the book requires readers to know both basic facts about number fields (not least, be able to understand why questions relating to them are interesting) and\n\nthe geometry of Kleinian groups of the first kind (e.g. as in Ratcliffe). We have tried to run reading groups on this book before and it has never been successful since it is very hard to find\n\nenough people who can pick up the necessary background as we proceed. See also Voight's book <a href=\"#pg-nt\">above in number theory</a>.\n\n<li>S.L. Krushkal', B.N. Apanasov, and N.A. Gusevskiy, <em>Kleinian Groups and Uniformisation in Examples and Problems</em>. This book is a collection of various examples of Kleinian and Fuchsian groups\n\n(plus some groups of Moebius transforms in higher dimension) taken from a wide range of places (e.g. knot and link groups from both Thurston's geometric point of view and Riley's representation-theoretic\n\npoint of view; some arithmetic groups and lattices; Koebe uniformisation, ...) along with brief exposition of the theory (combination theorems, deformation theory, cohomology) and lists of open\n\nproblems (quite out of date) and exercises.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"ldg\">Low-dimensional and hyperbolic geometry</h2>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"ldg-gm\">Geometric manifolds.</strong> See also the <a href=\"#ggt\">section on geometric group theory</a> above.\n\n<ul>\n\nOf course the canonical reference is\n\n<li class=\"fav\">William Thurston, <em>Three-Dimensional Geometry and Topology (volume 1)</em>\n\nand <em>Geometry and topology of three-manifolds</em> (aka the Princeton lecture notes, <a href=\"http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/\">downloadable here</a>).\n\nThese are hard books, but very rewarding. The book is an edited version of the first few chapters of the lecture notes, covering the basic theory of geometric\n\nmanifolds. The real work starts in the second half of the lecture notes, containing the material on Dehn surgery, rigidity, etc.\n\n<p>\n\nThe lecture notes themselves, historically only available in rough forms (either typewritten or in the LaTeXed form linked above with drawings scanned from the paper versions),\n\nwere <a href=\"https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=CWORKS/27.4\">published in book form by the AMS in mid-2022</a> as part of their four-volume series of Thurston's complete works.\n\n<p>\n\nSee also the book <em>In the Tradition of Thurston</em> edited by Ken'ichi Ohshika and Athanase Papadopoulos.\n\n<li>John G. Ratcliffe, <em>Foundations of Hyperbolic Manifolds</em>. Contains many of the ideas from Thurston's book and the `differential geometry' parts of his notes rewritten\n\nwith full proofs. My comments on Lee's <em>Smooth</em>\n\napply to this book, which is another doorstop. Not for the faint of heart, incredibly technical with not enough pictures (e.g. the definitions of cycles and sequences of faces in\n\nsection 6.8, which are given entirely algebraically with no indication of the geometric meaning). That said, if you want to understand Thurston's ideas\n\nyou will need a source other than his notes sometimes, and this is a very complete reference. Excellent historical notes and bibliography.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Albert Marden, <em>Hyperbolic Manifolds</em> (first edition was <em>Outer Circles</em>). Much more friendly than Ratcliffe and more detailed than Thurston's book; very nice introduction\n\nto the big theorems (until recently only conjectures) of 3-manifold geometry - the ending lamination conjecture, the density conjecture, tameness, etc. - and quasiconformal deformation spaces. Later\n\nchapters often tend more towards trying to explain the ideas rather than giving proofs, but everything is heavily referenced (the good bibliography is one of the major selling points of the book).\n\nOverall perhaps the first hollistic introduction to Kleinian groups and 3-manifold geometry accessible to a beginning graduate student, but the large-scale structure of the book does not seem particularly\n\nwell organised and the difficulty jumps around (in some sections he seems to be addressing beginning students, in other students he seems to be writing only for people who are already experts in\n\nthe subject, and there does not seem to be much logic to the split between the two). Noticably large number of typos which is disappointing given the price, and most of the changes from the\n\nfirst edition to the second seem to be additions glued on rather than carefully edited into the text. Highly recommended, but unfortunately very expensive.\n\n<li>R. Benedetti and C. Petronio, <em>Lectures on Hyperbolic Geometry</em>. Nice friendly reference for the \"big theorems\" of hyperbolic geometry (Mostow rigidity and the Margulis lemma), convergence, and\n\nthe Jorgensen-Thurston theory of Dehn surgery.\n\n<li>John Hempel, <em>3-Manifolds</em>. Pre-Thurston 3-manifold theory. It is of historical interest (e.g. to see a lot of concepts that you normally only see in books on surfaces; and to see a book on 3-manifolds\n\nwhich does not use the word \"hyperbolic\"), and also a good reference for some of the topology since it is written at a more elementary level than some post-Thurston books (e.g. provides rigorous foundation for\n\nthings like cutting manifolds along 2-sided embedded surfaces).\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"ldg-knots\">Knots.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>W.B. Raymond Lickorish, <em>An Introduction to Knot Theory</em>. Essentially an introduction to knot invariants like the Alexander and Jones polynomials. This is one of the genre of knot theory books which spends\n\nhalf of the book developing basic algebraic topology, doing only a little knot theory at the end.\n\n<li>Richard H. Crowell and Ralph H. Fox, <em>Introduction to Knot Theory</em>. Another introductory book but this time more focused on combinatorial group theory.\n\n<li>Masanori Morishita, <em>Knots and Primes: An introduction to arithmetic topology</em>. In that vein, here is a book in the latter category. Decidedly not an introductory book, this talks about analogies between\n\nnumber theory (you need some class field theory) and knot theory; so you need to be an expert in both fields to read it.\n\n<li>Peter Cromwell, <em>Knots and Links</em>. An intermediate level text which doesn't spend 50 pages on defining the fundamental group; this one actually proves the equivalence \"two bridge\" \\(\\iff\\) \"rational\".\n\nUnfortunately, there is not much geometric topology.\n\n<li>Jessica Purcell, <em>Hyperbolic Knot Theory</em>. Modern book (2021) which is an introduction to knot theory tending towards geometry rather than towards knot invariants or topological theory.\n\nTechnically minimal prerequisites beyond knowing some basic algebraic topology &amp; some familiarity with manifolds (in the broadest possible sense). Introduction to knot theory and the parts of Thurston's hyperbolic programme not found in many `easy' books.\n\n<p>\n\nThis book is of the opinion that the primary way to work with 3-manifolds is via triangulations. This is certainly a point of view. Unfortunately regular readers will be aware that I don't share it, but many books struggle to have an opinion on anything (I will write more on this when I get around to finishing my essay on writing) and if you like combinatorial points of view and are a beginning graduate student to whom Thurston's notes look daunting this is probably a book you will like or find useful.\n\n<p>The first few chapters follow Thurston's lecture notes fairly closely but are pitched at the level of an upper level undergraduate or masters student. The discussion of Dehn filling space is useful\n\nsince it is not found elsewhere in this form except for the primary sources (I used it as a reference in the 2023 minicourse) but it has some issues, see below. Remaining parts of the book are broadly\n\nabout the computation of invariants that can be found via triangulations.\n\n<li>Lois Kauffman, <em>On Knots</em> and <em>Knots and Physics</em>. I think in my 2023 notes I called <em>OK</em> \"whimsical\". Perhaps not as whimsical as <em>Journey into Geometries</em>, but still incredibly\n\nweird (not in a bad way); somehow <em>K+P</em> is even weirder. Certainly these are books with opinions.\n\n<p>\n\n<em>OK</em> is a lot of ephemera of knots from quite a classical point of view (Conway and Alexander polynomials, Seifert surfaces, etc.). It was very useful in preparing the notes in 2023.\n\n<p>\n\n<em>K+P</em> is basically a description of knot invariants from the point of view of scattering theory/QFT (I used to have a list of physics books, I should reintroduce that when I get time)\n\nplus around 400 pages of random physics-adjacent thoughts. The style reminds me of the cranks you read about who have invented a new way of writing large numbers and think that they will revolutionise\n\nmathematics, but in this case there is serious mathematics being presented. You don't need much physics but I found it helpful to already know a bit about scattering theory e.g. from\n\nthe book by John R. Taylor (Dover).\n\n<li>Dale Rolfsen, <em>Knots and Links</em>. This book is primarily interested in homological invariants and fibrations. It was also useful to me but not as useful as Kauffman's <em>On knots</em> or Burde and Zieschang.\n\n<li>Gerhard Burde, Heiner Zieschang, Michael Heusener, <em>Knots</em>. This is a very thick knot theory handbook which I have found useful primarily for the expositions of braid theory and two-bridge links.\n\n<li>V.V. Prasolov and A.B. Sossinsky, <em>Knots, Links, Braids and 3-Manifolds</em>. Another 'triangulations, Dehn surgeries, and homology invariants' book, this one notable for being surprisingly\n\nreadable in the Russian style. I complained above about knot theory books which spend the first half explaining carefully what a fundamental group is; somehow this is the opposite kind of book, which\n\ndoesn't do any fundamental group work at all and immediately begins with the Jones polynomial and other more homological objects. There is also a very nice treatment of Dehn surgery theory.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"pg-complex\">Complex analysis and Teichmüller theory</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Otto Forster, <em>Lectures on Riemann surfaces</em>. This is a very streamlined account of Riemann surfaces, from definitions to the Riemann-Roch theorem in a very short space of time. Quite algebraic\n\nwhich is an advantage to me but might be a disadvantage to an analyst, primarily interested in algebro-geometric problems.\n\n<li>Hershel M. Farkas and Irwin Kra, <em>Riemann surfaces</em>. A more analytic account which heads more in the direction of Kleinian groups and moduli theory. Very readable account of the uniformisation theory.\n\n<li>Yōichi Imayoshi and Masahiko Taniguchi, <em>An introduction to Teichmüller spaces</em>. Elementary introduction to moduli spaces and mapping class groups in the complex context, more analytic\n\nthan geometric; contains a very well-motivated introduction to the theory of quasiconformal mappings which is an advantage for going on to study moduli spaces of Kleinian groups, for instance\n\nas described in the later book co-authored by Matsuzaki and Taniguchi. For a geometric viewpoint on Riemann surface moduli spaces see Thurston's notes in the section on <a href=\"#ldg-gm\">geometric topology</a>,\n\nor Farb and Margalit's book below.\n\n<li class=\"fav\">Benson Farb and Dan Margalit, <em>A Primer on Mapping Class Groups</em>. A slow friendly introduction from a more geometric point of view, incredibly clear and readable. One advantage that might\n\nnot be immediately clear is that the theory is developed for surfaces in such a way that it can be adapted for marked surfaces (i.e. surfaces with points which may either be deleted or ramified). Also,\n\nthis is the only book I know of which actually motivates clearly the point of quadratic differentials (see section 11.3).\n\n<li>Kari Astala, Tadeusz Iwaniec, and Gaven Martin, <em>Elliptic PDEs and Qausiconformal Mappings in the Plane</em>. I know nothing about PDEs, but the sections\n\non quasiconformal mappings, holomorphic motions, etc. can be read without that background. Very useful reference particularly because of the large bibliography and lucid writing.\n\nUnfortunately it has a tendancy to reference entire books without page or section numbers (e.g. on p.296, \"That two different elements share a fixed-point in a Kleinian group has algebraic implications [48]\",\n\nwhere [48] is the 300 page book by Beardon on discrete groups -- admittedly it is fairly easy in this case to find the relevant section, but there are more annoying examples I can't find right now).\n\n<li>Some historical references:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>M.R. Chowdhury, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03024892\"><em>Landau and Teichmüller</em></a> (Mathematical Intelligencer, 1995)\n\n<li>Sandford Segal, <em>Mathematicians under the Nazis</em>\n\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"pg-ag\">Algebraic geometry</h2>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"pg-ag-sch\">Scheme theory.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Robin Hartshorne, <em>Algebraic Geometry</em>. This is the traditional introduction to scheme theory, and the first real textbook on the subject after Grothendieck invented it. It is not really\n\nan introduction to algebraic geometry: you need a very good background in varieties (i.e. you should really know everything in Chapter I from something like Harris or Shafarevich vol. 1 before\n\nyou try properly to read this book). Chapters II and III are highly technical, and to see any geometry you need to do all the exercises. The final two chapters (on curves and surfaces respectively)\n\nare more geometric and rely only a little on the details of chapter III, so I would recommend skipping the bulk of III and going back to it once you understand the app"
