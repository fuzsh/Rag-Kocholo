Spanier died of cancer in Scottsdale, Arizona, on October 11, 1996. Born in Washington, D.C., on August 8, 1921, he was graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1941 and then spent three years as a mathematician in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. He received the doctorate in mathematics in 1947 from the University of Michigan under the direction of Norman Steenrod. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1948. He was a Guggenheim fellow in Paris in 1952-53, a member of the institute for Advanced Study in 1958-59, and a Miller Research Fellow at Berkeley in 1961-62. His visiting appointments include positions in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland; and at UCSD and UCLA. Spanier was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Berkeley in 1959, at the beginning of a period of rapid expansion of the mathematics department. An internationally recognized authority in the swiftly developing field of topology, he attracted first-class mathematicians as visitors and new faculty members. He played a major role in organizing new programs in geometry and topology, subjects in which Berkeley soon achieved preeminence. He served several times as vice chair and acting chair of the department, and directed 14 doctoral dissertations at Berkeley in addition to three at Chicago; in 1991 he became Professor Emeritus.SIAM News Quick Search:\n\nBook Review\n\nJames Case\n\nThe Life and Times of One of the Century's Most Gifted Individuals\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nSylvia Nasar\n\nThe author, best known as an economics correspondent for The New York Times, describes her biography of John Nash as a play in three acts: genius, madness, and reawakening. It is hard to say exactly when, during the 1950s, it became clear that Nash was a rare genius. He began the decade as a promising graduate student at Princeton and ended it in madness. In the interim, he did the work he will always be remembered for, in game theory, geometry, and analysis. His reawakening from madness is no easier to date than his descent into it but seems to have been well under way by 1990, according to those who saw him on a more or less daily basis in and around Princeton. He spent the intervening decades in varying degrees of mental illness, the depths of which Nasar strives mightily to plumb. The book devotes only a chapter to Nash's boyhood in Bluefield, West Virginia, and another to his undergraduate years at the Carnegie Institute of Technology-now Carnegie Mellon University-which he attended on a Westinghouse scholarship between June 1945 and June 1948.* Nash arrived well prepared, having completed numerous courses at Bluefield College while still in high school. His friends from those years remember him as a \"brain,\" destined to become a \"scientist,\" presumably of the white-coated Hollywood variety then making relentlessly pub-licized contributions to the war effort. He excelled in school but displayed no particular affinity for any one subject. Socially, he is remembered as awkward and immature.\n\nSammy obits\n\ncategories ( cat-dist@mta.ca\n\nWed, 4 Feb 1998 10:17:03 -0400 (AST)\n\nMessages sorted by: [ date ]\n\n[ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]\n\nNext message: Perez Garcia Lucia: \"categories: Gödel and category theory\"\n\nPrevious message: categories: \"Re: Friedman's challenge, and the ordinals\" Date: Tue, 3 Feb 1998 18:22:14 -0500 (EST)\n\nFebruary 3, 1998, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final\n\nNAME: Samuel Eilenberg SECTION: Section B; Page 9; Column 1;\n\nMetropolitan Desk\n\nLENGTH: 660 words\n\nHEADLINE: Samuel Eilenberg, Dies; Mathematician at Columbia\n\nBYLINE: By ERIC PACE\n\nBODY:\n\nSamuel Eilenberg, an eminent mathematician and collector of Asian art,\n\ndied on Friday at the Isabella Geriatric Center in upper Manhattan, where he had been for three months.

Initially appointed as Reader, he was promoted to Professor in 1969 and has played a leading role in the successful development of this internationally famous department. Nothing could be a better tribute to David's many contributions to mathematics, and above all to his and Rona's warm and close relations with, and help to, many many members of the mathematics community over the years, than the overwhelming response to our invitation to his 60th birthday celebration conference in May 1997. The conference was attended by over 100 people from 16 countries, almost all of whom had close personal or research ties with David. We hope that this volume gives some impression of the range of his present interests and we are honoured to dedicate it to David.\n\nIgor Rivin, Colin Rourke and Caroline Series\n\nWarwick, September 1998.\n\nContents of the Epstein Birthday SchriftThe Princeton Mathematics Community in the 1930s\n\nTranscript Number 3 (PMC3)\n\n©The Trustees of Princeton University, 1985\n\nGEORGE W. BROWN\n\nand ALEXANDER M. MOOD\n\nThis is a conversation between George W. Brown and Alexander Mood at the University of California, Irvine, on 25 July 1984. Mood: I am Alex Mood talking with George W. Brown about our days at the Princeton Math Department at the invitation of Al Tucker. Al suggests a few questions we might answer along with our reminiscences about Princeton, and we might start with the first question, 'Why did you come to Princeton?'. Do you have an answer for that George? Brown: Annals of Mathematical Statistics . As a result I applied at Princeton in that spring of '38 and was accepted. I gave up my support at Harvard, which was quite generous, but I agreed with Huntington's advice that seven years was too many to spend in one math department, no matter what it was. And particularly with Ahlfors leaving. So that's my answer to that first question. Do you want to go to bat on it? Mood: I majored in physics as an undergraduate. I was attracted by all those famous names at Princeton: Einstein, von Neumann, Hermann Weyl. So I applied to Princeton in the math department. I wasn't interested in laboratory physics, only in mathematical physics. The only thing they could offer me was Sam Wilks' scholarship in statistics. Well, I thought I would go there on that scholarship and take some mathematical physics on the side. But when I got there I found thatThe Princeton Mathematics Community in the 1930s\n\nTranscript Number 17 (PMC17)\n\n© The Trustees of Princeton University, 1985\n\nROBERT E. GREENWOOD\n\nThis is a written contribution, dated 5 September 1984, by Robert E. Greenwood. Graduate student life in Princeton Joe Daly was quite friendly with Carl Allendoerfer, who worked in mathematical analysis. Carl was at Haverford College; he co-authored a successful textbook with Cletus Oakley and later went to the University of Washington. Joe Daly married in the summer of 1937, I believe. He and his wife Charlotte lived in Penns Neck while Joe continued his studies at Princeton. All of us were friendly with John H.M. Olmsted. After his marriage he stayed in the Princeton area until he received a degree. He taught at several places in the Midwest. One of Alex Mood's friends was a man named Robert Singleton. Singleton did not stay at the Graduate College, and I did not know him well. Ralph Boas was at the Graduate College in the late '30s. It is likely that he was with the Institute rather than at Princeton. I knew him, but not well. Paul Erdos lived in Princeton during some of the 1938-39 academic yea r. I met him once or twice in the time I was at Princeton for my final Ph.D. examination. I have seen him and corresponded with him many times since then."
