        "text": "If Monday offered a sunny outlook for the future of the Lakers organization, Tuesday was a day of grim decisions for holdovers from the previous coaching staff.\n\nNew head coach Darvin Ham retained assistants Phil Handy and Quinton Crawford for his coaching staff next season, while cutting ties with David Fizdale, John Lucas III and Mike Penberthy, people with knowledge of the moves confirmed to Southern California News Group. ESPN was the first to report Ham’s personnel moves, which are the first official steps for the 48-year-old as he attempts to return the Lakers to NBA title contention.\n\nHam and General Manager Rob Pelinka spoke to the coaches – who had been in contractual limbo since Frank Vogel was fired in April – on Tuesday morning, a source told SCNG.\n\nWhile it typically takes weeks if not months before coaching staffs are finalized, Ham said during his introductory press conference that he hopes to emulate the coaching staffs he has served on under Mike Budenholzer. He envisions his assistants playing many different roles rather than specializing.\n\n“I like coaches that like to roll up their sleeves and are able to get out there,” he said. “Where I come from the last nine years, we did everything. We did player development. We did scouting. I had to step in as the head coach on a few occasions. But it was a team. It wasn’t coordinators on either side of the ball. We all pitched in on all aspects of our team basketball offensively and defensively.”\n\nIn less than a decade, Budenholzer has grown an appreciable tree from this approach. In addition to Ham, Quin Snyder, Kenny Atkinson and Taylor Jenkins have all been hired as head coaches from his bench.\n\nA renowned skills coach within the league, Handy has served as a front-of-the-bench assistant for the Lakers for the last three seasons. He’s won three championships with three different franchises in the last decade, including the Lakers’ title-winning group in 2020. Handy worked with Ham previously during the 2011-13 seasons with the Lakers when both worked on player development at the beginning of their NBA coaching careers.\n\nCrawford has also served on staff for the past three years after getting his start as a video coordinator. A former player at the University of Arizona, Crawford coached under Vogel both in Orlando and L.A.\n\nOf the three assistants who were let go, Penberthy was the longest-serving: He was hired by Vogel in 2019 and promoted to the front of the bench this past year after Jason Kidd departed. A member of the 2001 title team as a player, Penberthy worked closely on skill development with multiple players, including All-Star big man Anthony Davis.\n\nFizdale and Lucas were hired in the last year to replace Kidd and Lionel Hollins. Fizdale, an L.A. native, has head coaching experience in Memphis and New York and took over as interim coach for a six-game stretch when Vogel was in the COVID-19 protocols. Lucas had taken a large role in conducting draft workouts for the franchise in the last month.\n\nThe Lakers will also retain player development staffer Jon Pastorek, sources told SCNG.\n\nThe only reported interest in an outside hire so far is Rasheed Wallace, a former antagonist of the Lakers in the playoffs and a Detroit Pistons teammate of Ham. Wallace served on Penny Hardaway’s staff at the University of Memphis for part of last season, and on Monday Hardaway told local reporters he believed Ham would hire Wallace out west.\n\nBut Ham called Wallace an “active situation” during his press conference: “He’s definitely a candidate that we’ll take a look at, but we’re working through that.”"
