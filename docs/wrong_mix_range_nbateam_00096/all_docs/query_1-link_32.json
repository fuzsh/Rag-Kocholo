        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers recently made a new hire to the coaching staff with John Lucas III coming to the team.\n\nLos Angeles had to overhaul the coaching staff this summer with members of the staff either leaving to new teams or not being able to reach a deal to extend their stay.\n\nAssistants Jason Kidd left to become the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks, and Lionel Hollins got frustrated with the front office and couldn’t come to terms with a new deal.\n\nThose led to the hires and promotions of former NBA head coach David Fizdale and Mike Penberthy, who was promoted to an end-of-the-bench role following Hollins’ departure.\n\nThe Lakers also reportedly brought on Lucas III, with Dave McMenamin of ESPN reporting the news Saturday, which came after the news of assistant coach Miles Simon becoming the head coach of the South Bay Lakers of the G League.\n\nLucas III is expected to assist with player development and add an experienced voice in the locker room; he previously coached as an assistant with the Minnesota Timberwolves from 2017 to 2019.\n\nNow with L.A., his father, John Lucas II, explained how his son will adjust with his new team, via Brandon “Scoop B” Robinson of Bally Sports:\n\nLucas II has been coaching as a head coach and assistant since the early 1990s, so Lucas III could bring a boost to the new Lakers roster. It’s also helpful he has a lengthy connection with LeBron James, which was one of the key components to Fizdale’s hiring."
