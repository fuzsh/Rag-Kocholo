        "text": "In this season of dreadful losing streaks and gloomy injury reports comes a sparkle of optimism – from the straightest shooter within the Indiana Pacers organization, no less.\n\nOn Tuesday, Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, met with reporters and for the first time in more than five months, entertained the notion of a Paul George comeback this season.\n\nWhile re-enforcing his belief that the Pacers (17-32 and 4½ games out of the last playoff spot) can still win and make something out of this season, Bird expressed his hope of George playing. Though Bird repeatedly stated that he does not know for sure if a George comeback will happen, he would not be opposed to giving George some game action in the remainder of the 2014-15 season.\n\n\"I'm always in a win-now mode. I want to win and that's been my goal, to try to get into the playoffs,\" Bird said. \"Hopefully, down the road, we'll see where Paul's at. We still have no idea whether he's coming back or not, but it seems like every week he's getting better and better. If we do have an opportunity to get into the playoffs and he can get some games under his belt and (then) get ready to go next year (then we could play him).\"\n\nBird's statement marked the first time a Pacers official has acknowledged that George, if healthy, could possibly return this season. George will meet with the media Thursday.\n\n\"I always say if the player is ready to play, he's got to play,\" Bird said. \"We're not going to hold (George) back if he's able to go out there and play. I think it's important because when you're out like that, you lose something. He's going to get beat up, he's going to get knocked around, he's not going to look good but I still think it's important, if he's able to play, he should be out there.\"\n\nSince Aug. 1, when George suffered an open fracture of the tibia and fibia bones (in less scientific words, his lower right leg snapped like a twig), the Pacers have continued with the belief that George would miss the full season. Even back in October, when George – sans boot and air cast – showed encouraging signs of improvement in videos posted on his Instagram account, Bird stuck a pin in that balloon.\n\n\"That means nothing. He's got a rod in his leg holding that bone together, and it's gotta heal,\" Bird said then. \"Looks good against his dog and when he's standing out there in front of you guys, he looks pretty good. Other than that, he don't do nothing.\"\n\nWithout revealing specifics, coach Frank Vogel said George has participated in team non-contact drills. Also, any ticket-buying fan can witness George's pregame workout routine that he religiously does on the road and at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\n\nAlso, George has dunked in practice and, according to teammate Roy Hibbert, he can make athletic between-the-leg moves that Dominique Wilkins had been known for in All-Star dunk contests.\n\nThe seven-month anniversary of the injury will come on March 1, marking the date for George's leg to be healed, according to Bird.\n\n\"I just know he's out there running around, he don't look very good, but he's out there running around. And they tell me seven months and that bone will be completely healed and it's just how much further he'll come along after that,\" Bird said. \"We'll go from there. I have no clue whether he's going to play or not, but if he gets healthy and they say he can play and he wants to play, we'll put him out there.\"\n\nFrom this sparkle of optimism – now comes a dose of reality.\n\n\"I think you've just got to be smart,\" Vogel said after the team's practice. \"Like Larry said, if the doctors say he can go, then I think he should get on the court and try it as soon as he's ready to but we all understand that's a long time from now.\"\n\nVogel would only go as far as saying that the Pacers would \"consider\" readying George for team practice after March 1, if doctors say it's safe. However, in Vogel's opinion, even George practicing seems like a faraway goal. And playing? That's even further down the road in his view – like, the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"Playing this year? I don't believe he's going to play this year,\" Vogel said. \"Yeah. I don't believe he will.\"\n\nFollow Star reporter Candace Buckner on Twitter: @CandaceDBuckner.\n\nDETROIT AT INDIANA\n\nTipoff: 7 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nTV: Fox Sports Indiana.\n\nRadio: WFNI-1070 AM, 107.5 FM.\n\nPISTONS (18-30*)\n\nPos.\n\nPlayer\n\nPPG\n\nKey stat\n\nPG\n\nD.J.

Watson\n\n10.3\n\n3.8 apg\n\nSTORYLINES\n\nHill returns to starting lineup: George Hill is expected to start and play 28 minutes in seven-minute bursts.\n\nThe changing Pistons: This has been a strange team to figure out, in part because of Josh Smith's midseason trade to Houston, Brandon Jennings' injury (torn Achilles) and the 10-day signing of proven scorer John Lucas III. Detroit opened the season 3-19 but has gone 15-11 since and has won 13 of 20 despite losing four of five of since Jennings' injury. Record-wise, the Pistons aren't much better off than the Pacers, standing 10th in the Eastern Conference to the Pacers' 12th. Detroit is 2-0 against Indiana this season: 119-109 in Michigan (Dec. 26) and 98-96 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse (Jan. 16) when Jennings (15.4 ppt) exploded for 37 points.\n\nThe former Pacer: Augustine, who averaged 4.7 points here in the 2012-13 season, has averaged 21.0 points since Jennings went down, and that includes an 0-of-7 shooting performance (with two free throws) against lowly Philadelphia. He scored 35 against Toronto and 28 against Houston.\n\nHe said what?: Pacers coach Frank Vogel on how he looks at the Eastern Conference standings: \"I typically don't talk about the standings after a loss. When we (win) it's, 'Look how close we are. We're still in it. There's still opportunities there.'\"\n\nPrediction: The Pistons are the third-best rebounding team in the league, and this feels like the Pacers will fall to 0-3 against them this season. Stan Van Gundy's team wins 89-86."
