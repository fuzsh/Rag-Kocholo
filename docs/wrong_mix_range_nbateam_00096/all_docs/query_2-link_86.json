        "text": "After helping the Florida Gators reach college baseball's grandest stage in back-to-back seasons, Brandon Neely is heading to the big leagues.\n\nNeely, a Spruce Creek graduate who calls Seville home, was picked 86th overall Monday by the Boston Red Sox. During his high school days, he steered the Hawks to the 2021 FHSAA Class 7A championship game with an eight-inning shutout; he now joins a relatively rare fraternity of Hawks selected in the MLB draft, including Zac Veen (2020), Austin Hays (2016) and Ed Lucas (2004).\n\nMLB Pipeline ranked Neely — a 6-foot-3, 210-pound junior right-handed pitcher — as the No. 193 available draft prospect. He pitched 83 times for the Gators across three seasons, posting 19 saves and an 8-10 record.\n\nCorey Kluber Q&A: Former Cy Young winner, Stetson star dishes on life after baseball, ballparks and podcasts\n\nIn 2024, Neely started six times and pitched a further 22 games out of the bullpen. He struck out 108 batters in 79 innings, recording a 5.13 ERA.\n\nNeely saved some of his best performances for crunch time, turning in dominant outings against Oklahoma State, Clemson and N.C. State during the NCAA tournament as the Gators reached the semifinals of the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nPrior to the draft, Neely spoke to The News-Journal in an exclusive phone interview, touching on his time in Gainesville, his pitching role going forward and his personal connection with a Hall of Fame infielder.\n\nWith three years officially done, how would you reflect on your time as a Florida Gator?\n\nNeely: It was always a dream to go to Florida, and I knew that it would be an awesome time developing there into a better pitcher than I was in high school. All the memories that I've made there over the last three years, being able to make it to Omaha twice, it's what you expect when you come to Florida. That's just the type of standard it is — to put in the work all offseason, all fall and leading up to spring, to get to Omaha. To do that two out of the three times, yeah, it was awesome.\n\nWhere do you think you made the biggest strides or growth in terms of development as a pitcher compared to your days at Spruce Creek?\n\nNeely: Definitely command. I threw pretty hard in high school, but throwing 94-95 (mph) down the middle in college isn't going to get you very far. Hitters adapt pretty good in college, and they can hit the ball when it's over the plate. Learning how to hit my spots, being more consistent with that, definitely helped me in college.\n\nHow would describe the environment surrounding Omaha and pitching in the College World Series?\n\nNeely: It's what every college athlete dreams of. The atmosphere there is unbelievable. When we played the championship series (in 2023) against LSU, I want to say there were like 28-29,000 people there. Our ballpark in Gainesville holds (7,000). It's crazy. The fanbase in Omaha and everyone around there is awesome. It's a really good experience going out there being able to pitch in front of that many people and with that many eyes watching you.\n\nAt times for Florida, you were utilized as a starter, though you mostly worked as a high-leverage reliever the last two seasons. Do you have a preference as far as your role is concerned at the pro level?\n\nNeely: At the next level, it really doesn't matter as long as I get to throw. I would rather be a starter, but closing is really fun, too.\n\nWhat are the differences from a mentality standpoint in starting a game as opposed to closing one?\n\nNeely: As a starter, you pretty much get a whole week to prepare for a team and you know who you're going to throw against. You get a whole routine going and everything, and you get to study the hitters a lot more. You're expected to go long in games, so you try to just get weak contact and ground balls. As a closer, you really never know what day you're going to throw or who exactly you're going to face. It's a lot different. Unlike as a starter, you don't want anyone to hit the ball.\n\nWho was the toughest batter to put away at the college level?\n\nNeely: Against my own team (in practice), I'd say Wyatt Langford. And the shortstop at Ole Miss, (Jacob) Gonzalez, who just went in the first round last year. They were pretty hard to strike out.\n\nGive us a little bit of a scouting report on one of your teammates, Jac Caglianone, who is expected to be among the top picks in this year's draft.\n\nNeely: I've played with him for three years. Well, really two-and-a-half because he was recovering from Tommy John (elbow surgery) his freshman year. And he was my roommate the last two years. He's a great all-around kid. His work ethic is really good, and he's super talented. He can obviously hit the longball very far and very consistently.\n\nI don't know who is going to get him. It's going to be a coin flip between those top three picks, and whatever team wants to spend the money or whatnot. Whoever gets Jac, I think they will be very pleased with him.\n\nYou said playing for the Gators was a dream scenario. Do you have something similar for the major leagues, like a team you grew up rooting for?\n\nNeely: I've always been a Braves fan but, at the end of the day, it's whatever team picks me. My main dream is to get to the majors, obviously, but to win a World Series, too.\n\nSpeaking of the Braves, your father, Jimmy, is a childhood friend of Chipper Jones. Chipper also gave you a personal shoutout when he presented you with The News-Journal's Baseball Player of the Year in 2021. Have you reached out or sought any sort of advice from him as you prepare for professional baseball?\n\nNeely: I text him a little bit, and I actually met him for the first time a little over a month ago. When I talk to him, I don't really talk baseball. We talk more about hunting.\n\nAs you meet with scouts and front office personnel this month, what is your pitch as to why an MLB team should draft Brandon Neely?"
