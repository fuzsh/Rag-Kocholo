        "text": "The Toronto Raptors have declined their team option on John Lucas III, meaning he will not be back in 2013-14. The Raptors desperately need a back-up point guard, and have been linked with Toronto-native Myck Kabongo. Lucas wasn’t a bad third-string point guard to have on the roster, however Dwane Casey overusing him and giving him far too much freedom … Read more\n\nAt the end of an article I wrote, I noted that this current Toronto Raptors squad is not a championship caliber contender, “but that’s a story for another day”. Well, here’s that story. If you’ve been living under a rock, Bryan Colangelo was extended as president but removed as general manager of the Toronto Raptors. Masai Ujiri has taken over … Read more\n\nLet’s face it, not many things really did go the Toronto Raptors’ way this season, and if there is one redeeming quality from this season, it has to be the ‘moral victories’. However, the bottom line is that this team’s record isn’t reflective of their performance this year, and it’s time to examine why. We analyze the … Read more\n\nAfter another lost season with no playoffs, it’s now time to make ourselves try and feel better by looking at the individual report card scores for each player on this roster. Who needs summer school? Note- grades relative to player expectations. For example, if LeBron averaged 20-2-1 he would get a D+ because that’s way … Read more\n\nThe Toronto Raptors (26-43) managed to claw back only to see defeat once again, only this time against division rival the New York Knicks (41-26). After falling to the Bobcats the other night, Toronto wasn’t able to get the monkey off their back and dropped another game at home 99-94 in an already lost season. The … Read more\n\nTonight, the Toronto Raptors (26-42) look to make it three straight wins against the current 3rd seed in the conference, New York Knicks (40-26) at home in the ACC. The last time the Knicks were at the ACC, the Raptors ran away with a two point win, as Rudy Gay and Carmelo Anthony went at … Read more\n\nWhere has Kyle Lowry gone? #3 on the Toronto Raptors right now simply isn’t the player Bryan Colangelo brought in this offseason, and that’s due to Dwane Casey. First off, let me remind you of who the real Lowry is. Take a few minutes and watch these videos of Lowry during the first couple games of the year. During that stretch, Lowry … Read more\n\nJust think about where the Toronto Raptors would be today if they had Rudy Gay closing those close games that account for far too many of their losses. It’s unbelievable what having a closer is doing for this team. Despite the terrible defense, Dwane Casey‘s questionable rotations, the Raps still closed out the game. After closing out the Denver Nuggets, … Read more\n\nPoint guard of the future. That’s what Bryan Colangelo dubbed Kyle Lowry when he brought him in for that future first round pick. If you asked the fanbase right now, the majority would likely say the deal wasn’t worth it. What people don’t understand is how poorly Lowry has been used, and how good he … Read more"
