        "text": "It's one of the hotter debates in sports right now: Is LeBron James better than Michael Jordan?\n\nWith Cleveland's sweep over Atlanta in the Eastern Conference Finals, James advanced to his fifth straight NBA Finals. What makes this year's run one of his most impressive is that he is doing it with an injury-riddled team.\n\nWe've heard from former Detroit Pistons Bad Boy Bill Laimbeer, who made news on Thursday by saying LeBron \"can do more\" than Jordan. Even Forbes Magazine did an in-depth piece comparing the two NBA greats.\n\nWhen comparing the two, there are four categories that seem to come up in every debate: championships, stats, accolades and surrounding talent.\n\nSo, this got me thinking about the greatest Big Ten basketball players to ever play the game. I came up with a list of 12 players who could all make a case for being the greatest, and broke down the list into those four categories.\n\nI also asked BTN.com senior writer Tom Dienhart, BTN.com senior editor Brent Yarina, and BTN analyst Stephen Bardo for their opinions on the greatest Big Ten basketball player of all time.\n\nHere's what I got.\n\n12 BIG TEN CANDIDATES\n\nSteve Alford, Indiana\n\nCalbert Cheaney, Indiana\n\nMateen Cleaves, Michigan State\n\nJim Jackson, Ohio State\n\nMagic Johnson, Michigan State\n\nJerry Lucas, Ohio State\n\nRick Mount, Purdue\n\nGlen Rice, Michigan\n\nGlenn Robinson, Purdue\n\nCazzie Russell, Michigan\n\nIsiah Thomas, Indiana\n\nJohn Wooden, Purdue\n\nCHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nAlford: 1\n\nCleaves: 1\n\nJohnson: 1\n\nLucas: 1\n\nRice: 1\n\nThomas: 1\n\nWooden: 1\n\nSTATS\n\nAlford: 19.5 PPG, 3.1 APG, 1.4 SPG\n\nCheaney: 19.8 PPG, 5.4 RPG, .438 3-point percentage\n\nCleaves: 12.5 PPG, 6.6 APG, 1.6 SPG\n\nJackson: 19.2 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 4.0 APG\n\nJohnson: 17.1 PPG, 7.9 APG, 7.6 RPG\n\nLucas: 24.3 PPG, 17.2 RPG\n\nMount: 32.3 PPG, 2.9 RPG\n\nRice: 18.2 PPG, 6.4 RPG, .480 3-point percentage\n\nRobinson: 27.5 PPG, 9.7 RPG\n\nRussell: 27.1 PPG, 8.5 RPG\n\nThomas: 15.4 PPG, 5.7 APG, 3.5 RPG\n\nWooden: 12.2 PPG (senior season)\n\nACCOLADES\n\nAlford: 2x first-team All-American (1986, 1987), Big Ten MVP (1987)\n\nCheaney: National Player of the Year (1993), First-team All-American (1993), Big Ten MVP (1993), Big Ten's all-time leading scorer\n\nCleaves: First-team All-American (1999), Big Ten MVP (1998, 1999), Final Four Most Outstanding Player (2000)\n\nJackson: 2x first-team All-American (1991, 1992), Big Ten MVP (1991, 1992)\n\nJohnson: First-team All-American (1979), Final Four Most Outstanding Player (1979)\n\nLucas: National Player of the Year (1961, 1962), 3x first-team All-American (1960, 1961, 1962), Final Four Most Outstanding Player (1960, 1961)\n\nMount: 2x first-team All-American (1969, 1970), Big Ten MVP (1969, 1970)\n\nRice: Big Ten MVP (1989), Final Four Most Outstanding Player (1989)\n\nRobinson: National Player of the Year (1994), First-team All-American (1994), Big Ten MVP (1994)\n\nRussell: National Player of the Year (1966), 2x first-team All-American (1965, 1966)\n\nThomas: First-team All-American (1981), Final Four Most Outstanding Player (1981)\n\nWooden: National Player of the Year (1932), 3x-first team All-American (1930, 1931, 1932)\n\nSURROUNDING TALENT\n\nAlford: Keith Smart and Dean Garrett\n\nCheaney: Greg Graham and Alan Henderson\n\nCleaves: Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell\n\nJackson: Chris Jent and Lawrence Funderburke\n\nJohnson: Greg Kelser and Jay Vincent\n\nLucas: John Havlicek and Gary Bradds\n\nMount: Larry Weatherford and Bob Ford\n\nRice: Rumeal Robinson and Terry Mills\n\nRobinson: Cuonzo Martin and Matt Waddell\n\nRussell: John Clawson and Oliver Darden\n\nThomas: Ray Tolbert and Randy Wittman\n\nWooden: Harry Kellar and Charles Stewart\n\nBTN.COM TEAM'S TAKE\n\nStephen Bardo: Jerry Lucas. I'd have to say Lucas. He was a three-time All American and a two-time Big Ten player of year. He also was a national champion his sophomore year.\n\nTom Dienhart: Jerry Lucas. He was a three-time consensus All-American, a two-time AP Player of the Year, three-time Big Ten Player of the Year, a two-time Final Four Most Outstanding Player who led the Buckeyes to the 1960 title. Still not impressed? Lucas also won a Gold Medal in 1960 and was an NBA champ with the Knicks in 1973. That makes him just one of seven players ever to achieve all three feats. As a pro, Lucas was voted to the NBA?s 50th anniversary team and was a seven time all-star. The guy?s resume is impossible to ignore.\n\nSean Merriman: Rick Mount. National championships are important, and Mount didn't win one during his time at Purdue. However, keep in mind that this guy did lead the Boilermakers to their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance, which resulted to a trip to the national championship game, where they lost to one of the greatest UCLA teams ever assembled. He averaged more than 32 points per game en route to being named a two-time All-American and Big Ten Player of the Year. Those numbers are simply unmatched when it comes to the greatest Big Ten players of all time."
