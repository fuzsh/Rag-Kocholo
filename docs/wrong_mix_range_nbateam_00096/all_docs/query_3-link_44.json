        "text": "Free agent point guard John Lucas III has reached an agreement to join the Utah Jazz, his agent told The Salt Lake Tribune. The Jazz had actively courted Lucas for more than a week, flying him to Orlando during summer league, where he met with coach Tyrone Corbin and Jazz executives. He will become the second point guard on the roster, behind rookie Trey Burke.\n\nGeorge said he has a similar personality as Embiid, who keeps to himself and has a smaller circle than many NBA megastars. But they began chatting at All-Star Weekends, and George eventually looked forward to seeing Embiid as they became near-annual selections. The friendship reached another level when, George said, Embiid “opened up to me.” “He said, ‘Man, regardless of what goes on, I look at you as someone that I want to be friends with for a long part of my life,’” George recalled. “And that was deep to me. We knew each other, but we didn’t know each other on that level yet. And for him to just open up to me, it felt right. …\n\nAn agreement exists between the NBA and FIBA that governs the movement of players back and forth, and so Sacramento had to wait until he was a free agent overseas and had an interest in coming to the NBA. To lure him over, they guaranteed him $13 million, with a team option for 2025-26. A guaranteed contract works both ways. Vezenkov did not have a player option for 2024-25, and so when reports surfaced that he wanted to return overseas, he couldn’t just leave; the NBA-FIBA agreement wouldn’t allow him to break a contract with his NBA team.\n\n“When I took the job you know it was a veteran laden team,” Billups said. “Melo [Anthony] was actually still on the roster. I really took the job thinking that I was going to be coaching him. You know with Dame [Lillard] and CJ [McCollum], Nurk [Nurkic]. So it was perfect for me, I’m thinking okay boom, a few moves here and there, I’m coming to like try to elevate things and then very quickly it changed.”\n\nPaul George on vibe he got for signing with Clippers: 'I'm on the B team'\n\nTomer Azarly: Paul George: “I think initially, coming back to LA that was home. But it’s not the same love. Because when I was in LA, they said, ‘you should’ve been a Laker.’ That’s all I was hearing… I’m on the B Team. That’s how the vibe and the love felt.”"
