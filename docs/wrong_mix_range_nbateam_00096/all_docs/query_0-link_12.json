        "text": "AUBURN HILLS - Detroit Pistons guard John Lucas III has been around basketball his entire life. His dad, John II, played for six NBA teams from 1976-90, was a head coach with three teams and an assistant with two.\n\nJohn III is in his seventh NBA season and he signed with the Pistons after starting the season in China. He has also played in Italy and Spain after a college career that saw him split four seasons between Baylor and Oklahoma City.\n\nIn a Q&A with MLive, Lucas talked about his famous father, growing up around some of the biggest names in NBA history and a rather humorous misunderstanding over a phrase that - in the Chinese language - sounds a lot like the N-word.\n\nMLive: What was it like growing up with such a famous father?\n\nLucas: It was great. I got to be around Michael Jordan. George Gervin is my godfather. (Laughs.) I got to be around all the great players. I've got Larry Bird's Eastern Conference championship jersey with the sweat stains still on it hanging up in my room. Magic Johnson.\n\nMLive: So was that just like everyday life for you, being around guys like that?\n\nLucas: Yeah, absolutely. I used to bring my friends around and they'd be like ... (opens eyes wide and raises eyebrows). I'd be, \"Hey Chuck, how you doing?\" And everybody would be, \"Hey, Mr. Barkley.\" Rick Mahorn, he said \"You better not call me Mr. Mahorn. You better call me Rick.\" (Laughs.) I've been around these guys my whole life really.\n\nMLive: How old were you when you realized how famous your father was and what he did for a living?\n\nLucas: I was 4. He kept me around the game. I used to go to shootarounds with him, I went to practice with him, I traveled with him when he was a coach. On the weekends, when he was the head coach, I used to travel with the team. I learned to play all the gambling games like by on the plane with like Dennis Rodman, Willie Anderson, David Robinson. Well, David Robinson didn't gamble. (Laughs.) But everybody else did. I was around an older group of guys and I used to work out with them. My dad used to let me practice with them when I was in middle school and high school.\n\nMLive: Was there any pressure growing up with that name?\n\nLucas: The name was a gift and a curse but I loved it. And why I say that is anytime I had to come out and play, everybody would try to hype their kids up to play against me because of who my father was. My dad was like, \"Anytime you step foot on that court, you protect the name.\" And I did. Even to this day, that's the mentality I have when I step on this court.\n\nMLive: What was it like playing in China? Was that a huge adjustment?\n\nLucas: You know what, it wasn't because I had been over there before. I had played overseas before. This wasn't my first time playing over there. It was an adjustment because I had been in the (NBA) the past five years. Going over there, that was the adjustment, just getting mentally there, saying, \"OK, I'm here. Let me work on some of stuff I need to work on. Let me get back to where I ultimately want to be,\" which was the NBA.\n\nMLive: What's the food like in China compared to the Chinese food we get here?\n\nLucas: It's real Chinese food. There's a big difference. It tastes amazing, especially the vegetables. They don't use that much grease, that much salt, anything. It's more olive oil so it's healthy. It's pretty good.\n\nMLive: Do you have any funny stories about the language barriers in any of these foreign countries you played in?\n\nLucas: Yeah, yeah, yeah! When I first got to China, it's kind of funny, I was doing an interview and there was a gang of reporters around me and they kept saying \"Nay guh, nay guh, nay guh!\" and I was like \"What?!\" (Laughs.) It kind of caught me off-guard because I'm thinking back home ... They were like \"No, that means 'over here, over here. Come here.\" That was the funny part because everybody that goes over there says \"Are you hearing this?\" And I said, \"No it doesn't mean that! That's not what it means.\" The way they say it, it sounds like they're saying the N-word. (Laughs.)\n\nMLive: What do you remember about hitting the winning shot over St. Joseph's to send Oklahoma State to the Final Four?\n\nLucas: I had an awful first half. I was so excited to play against Jameer (Nelson) and Delonte West because all year you hear so much about St. Joe's and how they're supposed to win the (Final) Four. The night before, I couldn't go to sleep. I was so amped to play that I was maybe too amped for the game. So the second half I just relaxed, calmed down and I came into my own. I just remember I said, 'If this ball comes to me, I'm not passing it. I'm knocking it down.' I just let it go.\n\nMLive: You're an average-size guy in a league of giants. Is there any advantage to being 5-foot-11 in the NBA?\n\nLucas: You gotta be a pest. I constantly pick up (defensively) full court. I like to cause havoc, I like to be a gnat. You know how you go to a barbeque and you have those gnats around you? That's how I want to play. And that's my mentality.\n\nMLive: It's probably easier to find clothes than a guy like Andre Drummond or Greg Monroe.\n\nLucas: Oh yeah, I can buy off the rack. (Laughs.)\n\nMLive: Do you have any hidden talents that might surprise people?\n\nLucas: I love tennis. I'm a tennis player.\n\nMLive: What's your favorite NBA arena other than The Palace?\n\nLucas: I have a lot. I love playing in the United Center in Chicago and I love playing out at Golden State.\n\nMLive: What's your favorite NBA city to visit?\n\nLucas: Miami. Weather. And Toronto. There's a lot of things to do in Toronto. I played there for a year but just the culture, it's like a melting pot. You see so many races. It's so diverse. You see a little bit of everything. You see a little Ethiopian, a little Italian. You want Italian food, you can go to the Italian part of the city. If you want Jamaican food, you can go to the Jamaican part. If you want Ethiopian food, you can go to the Ethiopian part. There's a lot of culture there.\n\nMLive: What do you see yourself doing in 20 years?\n\nLucas: Coaching. Pro or college, it doesn't matter. I just want to be a head coach."
