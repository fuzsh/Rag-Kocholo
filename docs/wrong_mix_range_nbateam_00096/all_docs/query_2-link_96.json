        "text": "The recently completed Summit Racing Equipment NHRA Nationals was Race 10, the halfway point of the 20-race 2024 season, and, more importantly, set up the stretch run of four races leading to the end of the regular season. Here’s a look at how the points battles shape up in Pro Stock.\n\nTHE POINTS LEADER\n\nDallas Glenn hits the halfway mark as the championship leader in the Pro Stock class, but his lead over Greg Anderson and Erica Enders is not exactly what one would call safe.\n\nQuite honestly, Glenn hasn’t had a bad race yet as he’s one of the few NHRA pros in any class without a round one loss. In fact, in ten events, Glenn and his RAD Torque Systems Camaro have been in the semifinals or better nine times including victories at the Lucas Oil NHRA Winternationals in Pomona and the Gerber Collision and Glass Route 66 NHRA Nationals presented by Peak Performance in Joliet. Glenn also went to final rounds in Phoenix, Richmond, and Norwalk, contributing to a sterling 26-8 record on race day. Glenn also bagged a Mission Foods #2Fast2Tasty Challenge victory in Epping.\n\nPUSHING FOR THE FRONT\n\nGlenn’s teammate, Greg Anderson, and his biggest rival, Erica Enders, are second and third, respectively in the standings. Anderson trails by 89 points while enders is 120 points back.\n\nAfter a second-place finish last season, Anderson is having a season reminiscent of his most dominant years with wins in Phoenix and Charlotte to go with his runner-up in Bristol. Perhaps more importantly, Anderson’s driving has been on point, particularly his starting line reaction times. Anderson has also managed to mostly avoid disaster with just one early loss in Epping.\n\nWith a No. 1 on her JHG Camaro representing a sixth world title, Erica Enders came out swinging with a dominant win at the season-opening Amalie Motor Oil NHRA Gatornationals. Enders not only qualified No. 1 at that event, but also ran a string of 6.4s on race day to seal her first Gainesville title. Since then, it’s been an uphill battle for the elite driver with round one exits in Chicago and Norwalk. Enders has qualified either first or second at eight of ten events and she’s scored her fair share of Mission Foods titles with wins in Phoenix, Charlotte, and Bristol so there’s zero reason to think a seventh title isn’t well within reach.\n\nAaron Stanfield has been a consistent winner in every type of race car he’s ever driven and that includes a Pro Stock car, which is perhaps the most difficult. Stanfield, a three-time champ in the FlexJet Factory Stock Showdown, is peaking at the right time with back-to-back wins at the last two events in Richmond and Norwalk to go with a pair of finals earlier in the season.\n\nSix-time world champ Jeg Coughlin Jr. made his full time return to the Pro Stock class this season and it took all of four events for him to find the winner’s circle in his SCAG Power Equipment Camaro. Coughlin won the 4-Wide race in Las Vegas and then grabbed a second title in Bristol to keep pace with the leaders.\n\nLOOKING FOR TRACTION\n\nTroy Coughlin Jr. earned a win in Epping behind the wheel of his JEGS.com/White Castle Camaro but that is the only time he’s been past the second round this season, which more than anything illustrates how competitive the Pro Stock class is. Coughlin does have a respectable 10-9 record on race day and he’s sixth in the standings, so he can certainly be labeled as a contender.\n\nAt times this season, seventh-ranked Jerry Don Tucker has looked like a solid bet to become NHRA’s next first-time pro winner. Tucker was especially strong in Las Vegas where he qualified his Outlaw Mile-Hi Light Beer Camaro in the No. 1 spot and was a runner-up to teammate Jeg Coughlin Jr.\n\nThe Cuadra family has had an interesting season with the retirement of family patriarch Fernando Sr. Second-generation racers Fernando Jr., Cristian, and David, continue to make steady progress, particularly Cristian, who is ranked in the Top 10 following a runner-up in Gainesville. David and Fernando Jr. have also combined for five round wins in their Corral Boots entries.\n\nThere were also major changes to Deric Kramer’s program this season as he took full ownership of the team from his father, David. Kramer is hanging on to ninth place after four quarterfinal finishes but there is much reason for optimism as he’s qualified No. 3 at his last two starts in Richmond and Norwalk.\n\nA new race car provided a challenge for GETTRX/Total Seal driver Matt Hartford, who struggled initially, with a pair of DNQs, but has lately shown resilience, especially in qualifying.\n\nResilience is also a word used to describe the father-son team of Chris and Mason McGaha, who continue to buck the tide of the mega teams with their family run Harlow Sammons operation. Mason has put together a pair of semifinal showings and both cars have started to trend upward as the season has progressed.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS …\n\nCamrie Caruso, the 2022 Rookie of the Year, has been sidelined for much of the season after breaking her leg in a crash in Phoenix. She’s recently hinted at a comeback, expected for Brainerd.\n\nSienna Wildgust made news earlier this season when she made her debut at age 17. Wildgust also made news recently when she announced a switch from the KB Titan team to Elite Motorsports. She’s expected to race with team red in Seattle.\n\nThe most talked-about round of the season happened in Chicago when chassis builder John DeFlorian was called in to help test Matt Hartford’s new car. DeFlorian qualified on the bump spot, and then beat Erica Enders on a holeshot, adding fuel to the rivalry between the class’ two biggest teams.\n\nSo far this season, 30 drivers have competed in at least one Pro Stock race, a further testament to the revival of the Factory Hot Rod class."
