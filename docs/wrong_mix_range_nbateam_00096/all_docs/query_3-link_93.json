        "text": "John Lucas III could soon be heading up north to play for the Raptors, further signaling that Jose Calderon’s days in Toronto are nearly over. Per ESPN: “Sources said the sides are in advanced discussions to finalize the terms on a multiyear deal to add Lucas to a backcourt rotation that had already been strengthened earlier this month by the Raptors’ acquisition of Kyle Lowry. One source said Wednesday the Chicago Bulls, who’ve employed Lucas for much of the past two seasons, were resigned to losing the 29-year-old. With the Raptors and representatives for point guard Jose Calderon working together on trying to find a new home for Calderon via trade, Lucas has been targeted by the Raptors to potentially serve as Lowry’s primary backup when Calderon — who wants a fresh start — moves on.”"
