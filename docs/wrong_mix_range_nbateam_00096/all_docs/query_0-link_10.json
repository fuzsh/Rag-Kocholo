        "text": "As expected, John Lucas III signed today for a second 10-day contact which will keep him with the Pistons through the All Star break and February 19 trade deadline. After this contract expires, the Pistons must either sign Lucas through the rest of the season or release him.\n\nLucas quickly jumped into the mix for the Pistons after signing his first 10-day contract at the beginning of the month and immediately supplanted rookie Spencer Dinwiddie from the backup point guard role. Dinwiddie had struggled with his shot while Lucas was able to hit the ground running.\n\nStan Van Gundy indicated that the biggest reason he opted for the veteran due to his ability to push the pace offensively. Interestingly though, so far the numbers haven't backed that up. With Lucas on the floor, the Pistons' pace has been 90.8 possessions per 48 minutes compared to the team's overall average of 95.6. Lucas' number is actually one of the lowest on the team.\n\nStill, Lucas has performed well during the 6 game stretch his contract covered, putting up 5 points on 52 percent true shooting and 4 assists in just 13 minutes per game. His assist percentage has been an outstanding 54 percent, more than doubling his previous career high.\n\nWith the Pistons heading into the All Star break, Lucas' contract will include a slight twist due to 10-day contract requirements that state deals must cover at least three games. His deal will expire on Feb. 24 after the Cleveland Cavs game, essentially making it a 13-day deal."
