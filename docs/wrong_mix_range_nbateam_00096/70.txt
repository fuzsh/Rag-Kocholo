John Lucas has been waived by Wolves

John Lucas has been waived by the Wolves on Saturday. The Wolves aren't in need of guard depth and Lucas has played only 10 minutes all season.

Fantasy Impact

Lucas hasn't been a fantasy factor this season. He will look to sign on with a guard needy team possibly on a 10-day contract.

John Lucas III rescues Pistons with 15 points

Lucas played 21 minutes scoring 15 points and handed out three assists in Detroit's 105-95 win over Atlanta. Playing in his first game since March 13, Lucas got the call Tuesday as Reggie Jackson was dealing with an illness the whole game, and Spencer Dinwiddie played just four minutes due to an ankle injury.

Fantasy Impact

Lucas usually wouldn't have much fantasy value, however, the Pistons are coming up on a four-game in five-night stretch. Should Spencer Dinwiddie's ankle injury continue to linger, Lucas could see more playing time.

Detroit Pistons sign John Lucas III fo a 10 day contract.

Pistons have signed John Lucas III who was spending the season in China with the Fujian Sturgeons of the Chinese Basketball Association.

Fantasy Impact

This signing is to provide the team with some depth at point guard. Don't expect him to provide much in the way fantasy numbers at this point, but things could change in the event of an injury to D.J. Augustin who will continue to log most of the minutes at point guard for the Pistons.
