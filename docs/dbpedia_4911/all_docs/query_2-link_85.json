Functional surfaces drastically change wettability and condensation processes that are essential for controlling of heat transfer. However, the direct observation of condensation on micro- and nanostructure surfaces is difficult, and further understanding of the effects of the microstructure on the phase change is required. In this research, the contact angle of droplets with a wall surface and the initial condensation process were analyzed using a molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the impact of nanoscale structures and their adhesion force on condensation. The results demonstrated the dependence of the contact angle of the droplets and condensation dynamics on the wall structure and attractive force of the wall surface. Condensed water droplets were adsorbed into the nanostructures and formed a water film in case of a hydrophilic surface.

To treat these diseases, an effective in vitro evaluation and drug-screening system for adipocyte culture is required. The objective of this study is to establish an in vitro three-dimensional cell culture system to enable the monitoring of lipid accumulation by measuring electrical impedance, and to determine the relationship between the impedance and lipid accumulation of adipocytes cultured three dimensionally. Consequently, pre-adipocytes, 3T3-L1 cells, were cultured and differentiated to the adipocytes in our culture system, and the electrical impedance of the three-dimensional adipocyte culture at a high frequency was related to the lipid accumulation of the adipocytes. In conclusion, the lipid accumulation of adipocytes could be evaluated in real time by monitoring the electrical impedance during in vitro culture.

Our 4D structures are fabricated by printing an N-isopropylacrylamide-based stimuli-responsive pre-gel solution (NIPAM-based ink) and an acrylamide-based non-responsive pre-gel solution (AAM-based ink) in a supporting viscous liquid (carboxymethyl cellulose solution) and by polymerizing the printed structures using ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. First, the printed ink position and width were investigated by varying various parameters. The position of the printed ink changed according to physical characteristics of the ink and supporting liquid and printing conditions including the flow rates of the ink and the nozzle diameter, position, and speed. The width of the printed ink was mainly influenced by the ink flow rate and the nozzle speed. Next, we confirmed the polymerization of the printed ink in the supporting viscous liquid, as well as its responsivity to thermal stimulation. The degree of polymerization became smaller, as the interval time was longer after printing. The polymerized ink shrunk or swelled repeatedly according to thermal stimulation. In addition, printing multi-hydrogels was demonstrated by using a nozzle attached to a Y shape connector, and the responsivity of the multi-hydrogels to thermal-stimulation was investigated. The pattern of the multi-hydrogels structure and its responsivity to thermal-stimulation were controlled by the flow ratio of the inks. Finally, various 4D structures including a rounded pattern, a spiral shape pattern, a cross point, and a multi-hydrogel pattern were fabricated, and their deformations in response to the stimuli were demonstrated.

The inner surface of the artificial vessels is designed to have high biocompatibility. In order to make the best of the property, the proposed connecting mechanism contacts and fixes the two artificial vessels whose contacting edges are turned inside out. In this manner, blood flowing inside the vessels only has contact with the biocompatible surface. The biocompatibility, or biofouling at the joint was investigated after in vitro blood circulation tests for 72 h with scanning electron microscopy. Blood coagulation for a short term (120 min) was evaluated by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). A decrease of APTT was observed, although it was too small to conclude that the connector augmented the blood coagulation. The micro dialysis device which our group has developed as the artificial kidney was inserted into the blood circulation system with the connector. Decrease of APTT was similarly small. These experiments verified that the proposed connector can be readily applicable for implantable medical devices.

In the spectrum derivation, photocurrent data during alteration of the incidence angle of the measured light were converted using a responsivity matrix R, which determines the spectroscopic characteristics of the photodetector device. A generalized inverse matrix of R was used to obtain the spectrum and to fit a situation where multiple surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks appeared in the scanning range. When light composed of two wavelengths, 1250 nm and 1450 nm, was irradiated, the two wavelengths were distinctively discriminated using the improved method.

To do this, we scanned a train of focused femtosecond laser pulses over the complex film in air, following which the non-irradiated complex was removed by rinsing the substrates with ethanol. A minimum line width of 6.1 µm was obtained at a laser-pulse energy of 0.156 nJ and scanning speeds of 500 and 1000 µm/s. This line width is significantly smaller than that obtained in previous work using a CO2 laser. In addition, the lines are electrically conducting. However, the minimum resistivity of the line pattern was 2.43 × 10−6 Ω·m, which is ~10 times greater than that of the pattern formed using the CO2 laser. An X-ray diffraction analysis suggests that the balance between reduction and re-oxidation of the glyoxylic acid Cu complex determines the nature of the highly reduced Cu patterns in the ambient air.

Reconstructing a three-dimensional muscle using living cells could be a promising approach. However, the regenerated tissue exhibits a weak construction force due to the insufficient tissue maturation. The purpose of this study is to establish the reconstruction system for the skeletal muscle. We used a cell-laden core-shell hydrogel microfiber as a three-dimensional culture to control the cellular orientation. Moreover, to mature the muscle tissue in the microfiber, we also developed a custom-made culture device for imposing cyclic stretch stimulation using a motorized stage and the fiber-grab system. As a result, the directions of the myotubes were oriented and the mature myotubes could be formed by cyclic stretch stimulation.

To decrease the contact resistance, we investigated the resistance change mechanism by measuring the contact resistance with various contact pressures and copper layer thicknesses. The contact resistivity decreased to 4.2 × 10−8 Ω·m2 as the contact pressure increased to 800 kPa and the copper layer thickness decreased to 5 µm. In addition, we measured the change in the total resistance with various copper layer thicknesses, including the contact and wiring resistance, and obtained the minimum combined resistance of 123 mΩ with a copper-layer thickness of 30 µm using our mounting method. In this measurement, a low contact resistance was obtained with a 5-µm-thick copper layer and a contact pressure of 200 kPa or more; however, there is a trade-off with respect to the copper layer thickness in obtaining the minimum combined resistance because of the increasing wiring resistance. Subsequently, based on these measurements, we developed a sandwich structure to decrease the contact resistance, and a contact resistivity of 8.0 × 10−8 Ω·m2 was obtained with the proposed structure.

It is known that the end regions of kirigami structures are non-uniformly deformed when stretched, because the deformation is inhibited at the regions close to both the ends connected to the uncut region in the longitudinal direction. The non-uniform deformation affects the overall mechanical characteristics of the structure. Our model was intended to elucidate how cuts at both ends influence these characteristics. We focused on the difference in the deformation degree caused by a cut between the regions close to the ends and the center of the stretched kirigami device. We proposed a model comprising of connected springs in series with different rigidities in the regions close to the ends and the center. The spring model showed good prediction tendency with regard to the curve of the stress–strain diagram obtained using the tensile test with a test piece. Therefore, the results show that it is possible to theoretically design the mechanical characteristics of a kirigami structure, and that such a design can well predict the influence of cuts, which induce non-uniform deformation at both ends.

Thermal sensation is one of the major tactile sensations and needs to be further investigated for advanced virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems. Conventional thermal sensation displays present hot/cold sensations by changing the temperature of the display surface, whereas the proposed display is the first one that controls its effective thermal conductivity. The device contains an air cavity and liquid metal that have low and high thermal conductivity, respectively. When the liquid metal is introduced to fill up the air cavity, the apparent thermal conductivity of the device increases. This difference in the thermal conductivity leads to the users experiencing different thermal tactile sensations. Using this device, the threshold to discriminate the effective thermal conductivity was experimentally deduced for the first time. This thermal tactile display can be a good platform for further study of thermal tactile sensation.

Because the device enabled the immobilization of the microfiber in a culture dish even after its transportation and the exchange of the culture medium, we can easily track the specific positions of the microfiber for a long period. Owing to the characteristics of the anchoring device, we successfully performed temporal observations of the microfiber on the device for a month to investigate the function and morphology of three-dimensional cultured adipocytes. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of the anchoring device to drug testing, we evaluated the lipolysis of the microfiber’s adipocytes by applying reagents with an anti-obesity effect. Therefore, we believe that the anchoring device with the microfiber will be a useful tool for temporal biochemical analyses.

It can detect a small piece of tool steel chipping or breakage inside the products nondestructively. An inspection of all items in the manufacturing process is desirable for the smart manufacturing system. This report provides an impressive candidate for realizing this target. A thin-film magneto-impedance sensor has an extremely high sensitivity, especially, it is driven by alternatiing current (AC) around 500 MHz. For driving the sensor in such high frequency, a special circuit is needed for detecting an impedance variation of the sensor. In this paper, a logarithmic amplifier for detecting a signal level of 400 MHz output of the sensor is proposed. The logarithmic amplifier is almost 5 mm × 5 mm size small IC-chip which is widely used in wireless devices such as cell phones for detecting high-frequency signal level. The merit of the amplifier is that it can translate hundreds of MHz signal to a direct current (DC) voltage signal which is proportional to the radio frequency (RF)signal by only one IC-chip, so that the combination of a chip Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), a magneto-impedance (MI) sensor and the logarithmic amplifier can compose a simple sensor driving circuit.

The present study aims to demonstrate both nano- and microparticle flow separation using microscale thermophoresis at a Y-shaped branch in microfluidic channels. Microscale thermophoresis is the transport of tiny particles induced by a temperature gradient in fluids where the temperature variation is localized in the region of micrometer order. Localized temperature increases near the branch are achieved using the Joule heat from a thin-film micro electrode embedded in the bottom wall of the microfluidic channel. The inlet flow of the particle dispersion is divided into two outlet flows which are controlled to possess the same flow rates at the symmetric branches. The particle flow into one of the outlets is blocked by microscale thermophoresis since the particles are repelled from the hot region in the experimental conditions used here. As a result, only the solvent at one of outlets and the residual particle dispersion at the other outlet are obtained, i.e., the separation of particles flows is achieved. A simple model to explain the dynamic behavior of the nanoparticle distribution near the electrode is proposed, and a qualitative agreement with the experimental results is obtained. The proposed method can be easily combined with standard microfluidic devices and is expected to facilitate the development of novel particle separation and filtration technologies.
