        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nCervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a common degenerative spinal disease, which causes progressive neurological dysfunction in the middle-aged and elderly.1–2 Opportunities to encounter and treat CSM patients are likely to increase in aging societies. Both neurological examinations and detailed imaging are essential for diagnosing CSM. In addition to static compression factors, evaluating dynamic factors using kinematic computed tomography (CT) myelography3–6 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)7,8 has recently been reported to be useful for assessing CSM. It is well known that the degree of cord compression in CSM is associated with the position of the neck. Appropriate assessment of dynamic factors in myelopathy should make it possible to detect hidden spinal cord compression and provide useful information for choosing a surgical procedure.\n\nIn recent years, kinematic CT myelography has been used for dynamic measurement of the change in spinal cord cross sectional area (CSA), cervical alignment, vertebral slippage, and range of motion. Several studies have reported possible utility of kinematic CT myelography for investigating the dynamic changes in spinal cord compression in patients with CSM or cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).3–6 However, the mechanisms that govern dynamic changes in spinal cord compression, and the effects of such dynamic changes on the severity of myelopathy, have not yet been elucidated.\n\nWe have analyzed multimodal spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEPs) to determine the spinal level responsible for CSM. SCEPs are useful and reliable measure in investigating the functional integrity of the spinal cord when MRI shows compression at multiple levels.9–11\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess how the radiological parameters of spinal cord changes during forced flexion and extension in CSM patients by use of multiple logistic regression analysis. We further evaluated whether the characteristics of the dynamic change of the spinal cord influence the severity of myelopathy.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nA prospectively collected single-center database of patients with CSM was evaluated. From January 2013 to May 2018, a total of 226 patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy underwent cervical surgery in our institution. Demographic, clinical, electrophysiological, and radiographic data were prospectively collected. Patients who had OPLL, atlantoaxial subluxation, cervical radiculopathy, thoracic myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, supraspinal central nervous system diseases, or tumors; had suffered trauma; or had a history of cervical spine surgery, and could not perform SCEPs and kinematic CTM were excluded. Finally, 79 CSM patients were enrolled in this study (53 males, 26 females; median age at time of surgery: 74, range: 42–85 years). All patients underwent MRI of the cervical spinal cord and cervical posterior decompression surgery with or without posterior fusion. It was possible to determine the level responsible for the CSM by analyzing multimodal SCEPs and performing preoperative kinematic CTM in all patients. The patients’ neurological statuses were assessed using the Japanese Orthopeadic Association (JOA) score for CSM. The highest total JOA score without any abnormality is 17 points. The JOA scoring system also evaluates the motor function (4 point each) and sensory function (2 point each) of the upper and lower limbs. Therefore, the scores can be calculated separately for the upper and lower limbs by adding the motor and sensory scores (total 6 points).\n\nWritten informed consent for preoperative MRI and SCEP examinations was obtained from all patients with our institution's approval. Patients who fulfilled the criteria outlined below were included in the study.\n\nMyelopathy was diagnosed based on the presence of hyperreflexia, including a positive Hoffmann sign, upper extremity sensory disturbance, and obvious MRI-documented cervical spinal cord compression. The study design was approved by our hospital's institutional review board (Control Number: H2019-058).\n\nThe patients were classified into those who exhibited the smallest CSA during extension (Group E) and flexion (Group F).\n\nKinematic CT Myelography\n\nThe kinematic CT myelography examinations were performed under the supervision of four spine specialists. CT images were obtained in supine position during forced neck flexion or extension by use of a head fixation device. The radiological parameters recorded in the midsagittal view during the forced neck flexion or extension were C2–7 angle; C2–7 range of motion (ROM) according to the Cobb method (Figure 1), and the slip percentage at the responsible level that was determined by SCEPs. The percentage of slippage was defined as a ratio of the distance between the posterior border of the caudal vertebra down to the line that ran perpendicular to the posterior lower border of the cranial vertebra and the anteroposterior diameter of the caudal vertebra (Figure 2). Positive and negative values were considered to indicate anterior spondylolisthesis and posterior spondylolisthesis, respectively. We measured the CSA between each disc level in the flexion and extension positions on kinematic CT myelography (Figure 1). The dynamic change in the CSA (dCSA, mm2) at the responsible level was calculated as the CSA seen during flexion minus that observed during extension. The dCSA was recorded as an absolute value. CSA was measured twice, and the mean value was recorded to reduce intraobserver variation.\n\nPlain x-rays\n\nThe C2–7 Cobb angle, C7 slope, and C2–7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA) were measured on plain lateral radiographs in a neutral neck position, while the patient was sitting. The C7 slope was calculated as the angle between a horizontal line and the C7 upper endplate. The C2–7 SVA was measured as the distance between the C2 plumb line and the posterosuperior corner of the C7 vertebra.\n\nRecording of SCEPs for the Diagnosis of Symptomatic Lesions\n\nIntraoperative recordings of the SCEPs evoked in response to peripheral nerve stimulation (median nerve SCEPs [MN-SCEPs], ulnar nerve SCEPs [UN-SCEPs], and transcranial electrically evoked SCEPs [TCE-SCEPs]) were performed. The stimulation (square wave pulse, rate: 3 Hz, duration: 0.2 ms) of the ulnar and median nerves was performed at the wrist. The stimulus intensity was set at 1.5 times the intensity required to induce twitching in the little finger and thumb while the subject was awake. The stimulus used to evoke TCE-SCEPs was delivered in the form of square pulses (duration: 0.2 ms; intensity: 100 mA) through needle electrodes, which were located on the skull. The anode was located 7 cm to the right of the vertex, on a line that passed through the external auditory meatus. The cathode was located on the opposite side to the anode. The SCEPs were recorded intraoperatively (before surgery) with recording electrodes, which were inserted into the ligamentum flavum in each interlaminar space. The reference electrode for the SCEP recording was inserted into the subcutaneous tissue on the back of the neck. The SCEP signals were subjected to amplification, before being filtered with a bandpass filter (20–3000 Hz), using a standard evoked potential/electromyography system (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nThe detection of MN-SCEP abnormalities was performed based on the ratio of the amplitude of the spinal responses at each intervertebral level to the amplitude of the spinal responses detected at the C6–7 intervertebral level, as described previously.9,10,12 For each intervertebral level, the minimum amplitude ratio was set at 0.4.12 In the case of ascending UN-SCEPs, intervertebral levels at which a marked reduction (i.e., by >50%) in the size of the negative peak compared with that seen at the next intervertebral level down were regarded to be significant.9,10,12As for descending TCE-SCEPs, intervertebral levels at which a marked reduction (by >50%) in the size of the negative peak compared with that seen at the next intervertebral level up were regarded to be significant.9,10,12 Mean values were calculated for 40 to 60 TCE-SCEPs.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nFor expressing summary values of numerical variables, median and 95% confidence interval (2.5∼97.5 percentile) were used together with the value range of minimum to maximum. Univariate between-group comparisons were performed using Mann–Whitney U test or χ2 test. The radiological parameters obtained from kinematic CTM and x-ray were compared between the two groups by univariate analysis. To explore radiological parameters that are associated with the status of Group F, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed by stepwise parameter selection method (P < 0.05 was set as a criterion for inclusion in the regression model). All statistical analyses were done using StatFlex 7.0 (Artech Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan; URL: http://www.statflex.net/).\n\nRESULTS\n\nFifty-two (65.8%) and 27 (34.2%) cases were included in Groups E and F, respectively. Detailed demographic information is shown in Table 1 and Figure 3A–C. The responsible levels were as follows: C2–3: one (Group E/Group F: 0/1), C3–4: 31 (22/9), C4–5: 30 (27/13), C5–6: 9 (7/2), C6–7: 6 (4/2), and C7–T1: 1 (1/0). The mean CSA, C2–7 angle, and slip percentage differed significantly between the groups, but the C2–7 SVA and C7 slope did not. The JOA score did not exhibit significant intergroup differences; however, the JOA score for the lower limbs was significantly lower in Group F than in Group E: 2.0 (0.59–3.50) versus 3.0 (0.89–4.61) (P = 0.015). Group F exhibited a significantly smaller median dCSA than Group E (4.50 mm2 (0.59–19.22) versus 7.15 mm2 (0.70–28.8), (P = 0.0079) (Table 2) (Figure 3C).\n\nTABLE 2 - Demographic Data (Univariate Analyses of Group F vs. Group E)\n\nBy the logistic regression analysis, significant radiological parameters associated with the status of Group F were the degree of cervical lordosis during extension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54–0.90) and percentage of anterior spondylolisthesis during flexion (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.09–1.85) (Table 3), where OR for cervical lordosis was calculated for a change of 5°, and OR for the slippage was calculated for a change of 5%. From the sign of regression parameter β, patients in Group F showed a smaller cervical lordosis and higher percentage of anterior spondylolisthesis during neck flexion.\n\nTABLE 3 - Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis for Radiological Parameters Associated With Patients Suffered From Severe Spinal Cord Compression\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn several studies involving kinematic CT myelography and MRI, it was reported that in patients with cervical compressive myelopathy the cervical spinal cord was commonly compressed to a greater extent during neck extension (via a pincer mechanism).13–16 However, it was reported that spinal cord compression does not increase during neck extension in about 20% of CSM cases,3,17 and the mechanism responsible for dynamic changes in the CSA in such cases is unclear. Yoshii et al4 reported that spinal cord compression was increased by neck flexion in patients with cervical myelopathy due to OPLL who exhibited occupying ratios of >60% and examined the dCSA that occurred in the patients who demonstrated the greatest amount of spinal cord compression during flexion. However, no study has determined why spinal cord compression is increased during flexion in CSM patients. Uchida et al18 reported that segmental instability and reversed dynamic canal stenosis were present in 61% and 51% of CSM patients, respectively, and were associated with kyphosis or sigmoid alignment. They concluded that subjecting the spinal cord to flexion-induced mechanical stress is associated with the development of myelopathy with cervical kyphosis. The spinal cord was reported to be longer during flexion than in the neutral position or during extension in a kinematic MRI study.14 In cadaveric studies, the cervical spinal cord was stretched by flexion and loosened by extension, and during flexion the C2–7 angle ranged from 7.5° to 21°, and the spinal cord pressure increased by 2 to 5 mmHg.19 These results of the present study agree with these findings.\n\nIn an investigation of autopsy cases that were perfused with a barium suspension, the anterior compression factors recorded during neck flexion were associated with the blood supply to the anterior and posterior columns of the spinal cord.20 Our study showed that cervical kyphosis and anterior spondylolisthesis progress under flexion-related mechanical stress, as it induces myelopathy. However, Group F exhibited smaller dCSA than Group E. Shimuzu et al21 reported that the progression of cervical kyphosis was significantly correlated with spinal cord flattening in small game fowl. They found that spinal cord flattening was induced by ischemia, and neural loss and degeneration occurred in the following order: the anterior funiculus, followed by the lateral funiculus, and then the posterior funiculus. In Group F, the factors associated with the development of myelopathy might be closely related to disturbances in blood flow to the spinal cord, instead of being dynamic factors.\n\nThe mean preoperative lower-limb JOA score of Group F was significantly lower than that of Group E, despite there being significant intergroup differences in age and the duration of disease. No previous studies have found that myelopathy is more severe in cases in which spinal cord compression is increased by neck flexion than in cases in which it is increased by neck extension.\n\nChikuda et al22 reported that pyramidal tract signs are more likely to arise in cases of severe lower limb dysfunction, but not upper limb dysfunction. They mentioned that the upper-limb symptoms of cervical myelopathy differ according to the responsible level, and the brain can easily compensate for upper-limb dysfunction.\n\nIto et al23 reported a common pattern of CSM progression, which involved initial atrophy and neuronal loss in the anterior horn and intermediate zone, followed by degeneration of the lateral and posterior columns. In biomechanical24 or electrophysiological studies,9,10,25 it has been shown that the progression of myelopathy generally occurs in the following order: the lateral parts of the posterior column (Burdach tract), followed by the lateral corticospinal tract, and then the medial part of the posterior column (Goll tract) (Figure 4). Based on the results of this study, we hypothesized that the above-mentioned mechanism did not apply to Group F and speculated that, as Shimizu et al21 showed in their experiments, in Group F myelopathy was more likely to spread from the anterior to the posterior columns, which might have been more vulnerable in Group F than in Group E. Based on biomechanical experiments, Kato et al26 created a cervical flexion myelopathy model, which showed that stress is more likely to concentrate in the anterior column in the white matter. In a pathological study of CSM, Ito et al23 also reported a case in which the hind tract was not impaired, but the anterior and lateral tracts were severely impaired, suggesting that there is variation in the mode of progression of myelopathy.\n\nRecently, Shangari and Perez27 reported that corticospinal and reticulospinal outputs have less and greater influence, respectively, on spastic muscles in humans with spinal cord injuries and suggested that these imbalanced contributions are important for motor recovery.\n\nBaker and Perez28 reported that after spinal cord injuries reticulospinal outputs contribute to hand motor tasks involving gross finger movements. Interestingly, this contribution is less pronounced during fine dexterous finger movements. However, the anterior column is eventually affected in patients with common CSM, and the degree of reticulospinal tract impairment might be related to lower-limb dysfunction, but not upper-limb dysfunction (Figure 4). However, no electrophysiological evaluations of the anterior column, such as of the reticulospinal tract, have been performed, and it might be necessary to address this in future.\n\nCervical spondylolisthesis is sometimes seen in CSM and is more common at the C3–4, C4–5, and C5–6 levels.29,30 Some studies have suggested that it might affect treatment outcomes, but this has not been confirmed. Oichi et al31 reported that cervical anterior spondylolisthesis was associated with poor outcomes after laminoplasty in CSM. They stated that this was because anterior spondylolisthesis remained as an anterior compression factor after laminoplasty. Taniyama et al32 reported that the modified K-line is a useful prognostic tool and that anterior compression is associated with the surgical outcomes of laminoplasty for CSM. Hirai et al33 also reported that residual anterior compression factors were associated with poor recovery of upper limb function. In CSM involving kyphotic alignment or marked anterior compression, laminoplasty often produces inadequate outcomes31–34 because the aim of laminoplasty is to decompress posterior elements, such as the flavum, and shift the spinal cord posteriorly. Therefore, the anterior approach or posterior decompression and fusion may be chosen for Group F-like patients. We consider that this study provides information about the relationships between preoperative neurological conditions and diagnostic imaging and will aid the selection of surgical procedures for CSM.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nThis study had several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study, involving uncontrolled clinical observations. Second, the number of patients might have been insufficient for identifying significant factors. Third, we did not include MRI findings; therefore, we did not assess the relationships of factors with disc degeneration/protrusion. Kinematic MRI is an excellent diagnostic imaging tool, which can evaluate dynamic factors and carries no risk of radiation exposure. However, it can take a while to perform, and there might be a risk of patients’ neurological symptoms deteriorating. In this study, kinematic CT myelography took about 10 seconds in each neck position, and none of the patients’ neurological symptoms worsened. Fourth, we could only assess the severity of neurological symptoms using the JOA score because this was a retrospective analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION"
