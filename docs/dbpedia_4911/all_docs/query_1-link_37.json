        "meta_description": "OBJECTIVE Although anterior compression factors and cervical alignment affect neural decompression, cervical laminoplasty may be used to achieve indirect posterior decompression. The focal apex (FA) angle of the anterior compression factor of the spine represents the degree of anterior prominence toward the spinal cord. The authors investigated the mechanism underlying the influence of FA angle and cervical alignment on spinal cord alignment (SCA) after laminoplasty, including how high-intensity signal cord change (HISCC) on preoperative T2-weighted MRI (T2-MRI) may affect neurological improvement. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent laminoplasty for CSM or OPLL at two hospitals (Kanto Rosai Hospital, Kawasaki City, and Yokohama Minami Kyousai Hospital, Yokohama City, Japan) between April 2004 and March 2015. In total, 109 patients (mean age 67.3 years) with cervical compression myelopathy were included. FA angle was defined as the preoperative angle between the lines from the top of the prominence to the upper and lower adjacent vertebrae. Preoperative cervical alignment was measured between the C2 and C7 vertebrae (C2–7 angle). MRI was used to classify SCA as lordosis (type-L SCA), straight (type-S), local kyphosis (type-LK), or kyphosis (type-K). Preoperative HISCC was investigated by using T2-MRI. Neurological status was evaluated by using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score. RESULTS The mean preoperative FA and C2–7 angles were 32.1° and 12.4°, respectively. Preoperative SCA was type-L or type-S in 53 patients. The neurological recovery rate (NRR) was significantly higher for patients with preoperative type-L and type-S SCA (51.4% for those with type-L and 45.0% for those with type-S) than for patients with other types (35.3% for those with type-LK and 31.7% for those with type-K). Among patients with preoperative type-L or type-S SCA, 87.3% maintained SCA; however, 5/12 (41.7%) patients with a preoperative average C2–7 angle < 12.4° and an average FA angle > 32.1° had postoperative type-LK or type-K SCA. SCA changed to type-L or type-S in 13.0% of patients with preoperative type-LK or type-K SCA. Moreover, in these patients, FA angle was significantly smaller and NRR was significantly higher than in other patients in whom postoperative SCA remained type-LK or type-K. Preoperative T2-MRI showed 73 patients with HISCC (43 with type-L and type-S, and 30 with type-LK and type-K SCA) and 36 without HISCC (20 with type-L and type-S, and 16 with type-LK and type-K SCA); the NRRs of these patients were 42.6% and 41.2%, respectively. No significant differences in SCA or NRR were observed between patients with and without HISCC. CONCLUSIONS NRR depends on preoperative SCA type; however, it is possible to change the type of SCA after laminoplasty. Preoperative FA and C2–7 angles influence change in SCA; therefore, they are important parameters for successful decompression with cervical laminoplasty.",

The correlation coefficient was 0.859 for C2–7 angles calculated with preoperative radiography and preoperative MRI (Fig. 3). The ICC for intraobserver reliability was 0.943 for C2–7 angle measured with radiography, 0.922 for C2–7 angle measured with MRI, and 0.901 for FA angle. The ICC for interobserver reliability was 0.944 for C2–7 angle on radiography, 0.912 for C2–7 angle on MRI, and 0.891 for FA angle (Table 1). Preoperatively, 28 patients had type-L SCA, 35 had type-S, 38 had type-LK, and 8 had type-K; postoperatively, 15 patients had type-L, 46 had type-S, 29 had type-LK, and 19 had type-K. The mean NRR was 42.2% ± 18.7%. Patients with preoperative type-L SCA had the highest NRR (51.4%), whereas patients with type-LK and type-K had significantly lower NRRs (35.3% and 31.7%, respectively; p < 0.001). NRR was significantly lower for patients with postoperative type-LK (33.8%) and type-K (32.4%) SCA than patients with type-L (53.3%) and type-S (48.1%) SCA (p < 0.001; Fig. 4).\n\nTABLE 1.\n\nVariableValueICC for Reliability IntraobserverInterobserver Preop C2–7 angle on radiography, °12.4 ± 11.20.9430.944 Preop C2–7 angle on MRI, °11.5 ± 11.10.9220.912 FA angle, °32.1 ± 10.60.9010.891\n\nFor patients with preoperative SCA, the mean C2–7 angle on radiography was significantly greater for patients with type-L and type-S SCA (17.7° ± 9.5°) than for those with type-LK and type-K SCA (5.1° ± 9.0°) (p < 0.001).

Patients with type-L and type-S SCA had a mean C2–7 angle of 17.0° ± 10.3° on radiography; additionally, patients with type-LK and type-K SCA had a mean C2–7 angle of 6.5° ± 9.5° on radiography (p < 0.001). The mean FA angle of the patients with type-L and type-S SCA was 29.1° ± 9.9°, which was significantly lower than that of patients with type-LK and type-K SCA (35.8° ± 10.4°; p < 0.001; Table 2).\n\nAmong the 63 patients with preoperative type-L and type-S SCA, 55 (87.3%) maintained type-L and type-S postoperatively (group A); SCA changed to type-LK and type-K after surgery in only 8 (12.7%) patients (group B). Group A had a mean preoperative C2–7 angle of 18.5° ± 9.2° on radiography, preoperative FA angle of 29.6° ± 10.2°, and NRR of 49.5% ± 17.0%. Group B had a mean preoperative C2–7 angle of 12.3° ± 10.6° on radiography, preoperative FA angle of 34.0° ± 7.8°, and NRR of 36.4% ± 16.1%. No significant differences were observed (p = 0.065 for C2–7 angle; p = 0.396 for FA angle; p = 0.059 for NRR); however, C2–7 angle and NRR tended to be lower in group B than group A (Table 3). For further analysis, we then classified the patients with preoperative type-L or type-S SCA into two groups on the basis of mean preoperative C2–7 angle on radiography and mean FA angle. Twelve patients had preoperative C2–7 angle < 12.4° on radiography and FA angle > 32.1°; of these patients, SCA changed to type-LK and type-K postoperatively in 5 (41.7%) patients, and the rate of change to type-LK or type-K was significantly higher than that of other patients (n = 51) with preoperative type-L or type-S SCA (p = 0.004; Fig. 5).\n\nTABLE 3.\n\nVariableGroup AGroup Bp ValueGroup CGroup Dp Value No. of patients558640 Preop C2–7 angle on radiography, °18.5 ± 9.212.3 ± 10.60.0653.5 ± 10.05.3 ± 9.00.738 FA angle, °29.6 ± 10.234.0 ± 7.80.39625.0 ± 6.936.1 ± 10.90.003* NRR, %49.5 ± 17.036.4 ± 16.10.05946.9 ± 13.432.4 ± 17.60.030*\n\nForty-six patients had preoperative kyphotic SCA. SCA type changed to type-L and type-S postoperatively in 6 (13.0%) patients (group C) and remained unchanged in 40 (87.0%) patients with type-LK or type-K SCA (group D). In group C, the mean preoperative C2–7 angle was 3.5° ± 10.0° on radiography, preoperative FA angle was 25.0° ± 6.9°, and NRR was 46.9% ± 13.4%; in group D, these values were 5.3° ± 9.0°, 36.1° ± 10.9°, and 32.4% ± 17.6%, respectively. No significant difference in preoperative C2–7 angle on radiography was observed between groups C and D (p = 0.738). FA angle was significantly smaller (p = 0.003), and NRR was significantly higher (p = 0.030), in group C than group D (Table 3).\n\nSeventy-three patients (43 patients with type-L and type-S SCA, and 30 patients with type-LK and type-K) had HISCC on preoperative T2-MRI, and the NRR of these patients was 42.6%. Thirty-six patients (20 patients with type-L and type-S SCA, and 16 patients with type-LK and type-K) did not have HISCC on preoperative T2-MRI, and the NRR of these patients was 41.2%. No significant differences were observed in SCA (p = 0.739) and NRR (p = 0.356) between patients with and without HISCC. Laminoplasty at C3–6 (dome-shaped decompression on the cranial side of C7 was classified as C3–6) was performed on 34 patients (22 patients in group A, 3 in group B, 1 in group C, and 8 in group D), and laminoplasty at C3–7 was performed on 75 patients (33 patients in group A, 5 in group B, 5 in group C, and 32 in group D). The NRRs were 44.8% for patients who underwent C3–6 laminoplasty and 40.4% for those who underwent C3–7 laminoplasty. No significant differences in change in SCA (p = 0.186) and NRR (p = 0.315) were observed between patients who underwent C3–6 laminoplasty and those who underwent C3–7 laminoplasty.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMRI and radiography examinations require different postural positions; therefore, the respective sagittal alignments differ. Moreover, the reproducibility of cervical alignment on MRI is unclear; however, some reports11,12 have revealed a significant correlation between C2–7 angle on MRI and radiography, even if the examination positions were different. In this study, we observed a significant correlation between C2–7 angles determined with MRI and radiography. Therefore, cervical alignment on MRI is considered to have good reproducibility that is comparable to that obtained with radiography.\n\nPreoperative and postoperative type-L or type-S SCA were associated with higher NRR than type-LK or type-K SCA (Fig. 4). Kawakami et al. reported that patients with lordosis had higher NRR than patients with straight or kyphotic SCA in the sagittal plane after cervical laminoplasty.9 Breig et al. demonstrated that filling defects may occur in the arteries to the spinal cord during cervical flexion. Thus, kyphotic deformities may damage the spinal cord at the apex of the curvature during dynamic cervical motion.13 Lee et al. reported that cervical sagittal alignment and clinical outcomes after laminoplasty for OPLL were not evidently related;14 however, their report included patients with continuous or mixed-type OPLL, unlike our study. They reported that OPLL provided support to the spinal column, suggesting that kyphotic changes do not always occur and that lordotic changes are not always associated with satisfactory clinical outcomes.14 Sakaura et al. reported that NRR was significantly lower for patients with CSM than those with kyphotic rather than lordotic CSA; however, CSA did not affect NRR of the patients with OPLL.15\n\nA comparison of patients with preoperative and postoperative SCA demonstrated that most patients with preoperative type-L and type-S SCA (group A) and those with type-LK and type-K SCA (group D) had similar postoperative SCA (Table 3). Chen et al. reported that the greatest rearward movement of the spinal cord occurred at the center of lamina decompression during laminoplasty; moreover, patients with lordosis had more posterior spinal cord movement than patients with kyphosis.16 Based on the findings of this report, most patients with preoperative kyphotic SCA will still have kyphosis after surgery; however, it is unclear whether SCA type remains unchanged in patients with preoperative type-L or type-S SCA. In this study, SCA type was maintained in most patients with preoperative type-L or type-S SCA; these patients had smaller FA angles and larger lordotic angles than patients with preoperative type-LK or type-K SCA (Table 2). Although these factors generally maintain lordotic SCA after laminoplasty, preoperative lordotic or kyphotic SCA type changed after laminoplasty in some patients included in our study. Comparison of groups A and B indicated no significant differences in terms of preoperative C2–7 angle on radiography, FA angle, or NRR (Table 3); however, C2–7 angle on radiography and NRR tended to be lower in group B than group A. Moreover, combining C2–7 angle on radiography and FA angle increased the possibility of postoperatively producing type-LK or type-K SCA in patients with preoperative C2–7 angle on radiography ≤ 12.4° and FA angle ≥ 32.1°, even with preoperative type-L or type-S SCA (Fig. 5). Although groups C and D had similar preoperative C2–7 angles on radiography, group C had a significantly smaller FA angle; this suggests that even if preoperative SCA is kyphotic, postoperative SCA may improve in patients with small FA angle and these patients may have good NRR. These results suggest that evaluation of ACF is important to predicting change in SCA type.\n\nBaba et al. reported that neurological improvement was associated with posterior spinal cord shift on MRI; postoperative neurological improvement was highly correlated with enlarged bony canal volume in patients with lordotic alignment.17 Kong et al. reported that NRR after laminoplasty affected the adequacy of indirect anterior decompression.18 The effects of CSA and ACF size should be considered in the assessment of sufficient indirect posterior decompression (PD). Therefore, FA angle has been proposed as a quantitative evaluation of ACF; ACF can be used to quantitatively evaluate bulging disc, osteophytes, and spondylolisthesis. Suda et al. showed that expansive laminoplasty for CSM is best performed on patients with local kyphosis < 13°.8 The FA angle can also be used to evaluate local kyphosis, because the FA angle represents the relationship between the superior and inferior posterior edges of the vertebral bodies.\n\nAlthough controversial, HISCC on preoperative T2-MRI did not affect NRR. Alafifi et al. reported that patients with HISCC on T2-MRI, but without clonus or spasticity symptoms, experienced good surgical outcomes;19 however, some reports have suggested that differences in postoperative NRR are due to grading of HISCC on T2-MRI.20–22 HISCC grade on preoperative T2-MRI was not evaluated in this study, and this may explain the lack of a significant difference.\n\nIn this study, the differences in laminoplasty levels did not significantly affect NRR or changes in SCA. Zhang et al. reported no significant differences in NRR and C2–7 angle between patients who underwent C3–7 laminectomy with lateral mass-screw fixation and those who underwent C3–6 laminectomy with lateral mass-screw fixation and dome-shaped removal of C7 superior lamina.23 In this study, patients primarily underwent laminoplasty rather than laminectomy with lateral mass-screw fixation; however, among the patients who underwent C3–6 laminoplasty, some underwent dome-shaped decompression on the cranial side of C7, too. Although the surgical methods are different, the comparison of surgical levels between patients is almost the same; therefore, use of dome-shaped decompression on the cranial side of C7 may have resulted in the absence of significant differences in the rates of change in SCA and NRR between patients who underwent C3–6 laminoplasty and those who underwent C3–7 laminoplasty. The modified K-line is a method for evaluating sufficient decompression in patients with CSM treated with posterior surgery.24 This simple and effective method measures the minimum distance between the line connecting the midpoint of the spinal cord (at the level of the inferior endplates of C2 and C7) and the ACF to evaluate whether PD can be performed. Alternatively, anterior decompression can be performed when PD is insufficient; however, it is difficult to determine the extent that CSA should be corrected to achieve PD. In this study, by separately evaluating ACF size and CSA, we were able to obtain sufficient decompression by correcting CSA according to ACF size. For example, patients with C2–7 angle ≤ 12.4° and FA angle ≥ 32.1° had poor SCA after laminoplasty. This may mean that sufficient PD could be obtained in patients with an FA angle of approximately 32.1° if the C2–7 angle is set to ≥ 12.4°.\n\nThis study has some limitations. The control group was small, and only 6 patients with preoperative kyphosis had postoperative improvement. Furthermore, only 8 patients without preoperative kyphosis had postoperative deterioration in SCA. This limited our ability to identify the causes of improvement or deterioration. The absence of a statistically significant difference may be attributed to the small sample size of the control group. Because FA angle was evaluated on the midsagittal view, evaluation may have been inadequate in cases where compression was biased. Overall spinal alignment should be considered when evaluating alignment; however, our evaluation was limited because of the lack of full-spine radiographic data for all patients. Not all patients with CSM and OPLL underwent surgery via the posterior approach during the target period. Either an anterior or posterior approach was selected according to the patient’s medical history, which may have affected the study results.\n\nCSM can result from static and dynamic factors, and therefore evaluation of dynamic factors is important. However, it may be difficult to perform three MRI examinations (flexion, neutral, extension positions). Nicholson et al. reported that flexion of the cervical spine may be a compensatory deformity that occurs as a result of stenosis and myelopathy, similar to lumbar spine stenosis.25 If neutral CSA is kyphotic after laminoplasty, this may be caused by remnant ACFs that result in myelopathy. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the neutral position to determine whether decompression of the spinal cord was sufficient.\n\nMost prior studies described how C2–7 angle on radiography is associated with outcomes of laminoplasty. Determination of spinal cord release from ACFs after laminoplasty by using only the C2–7 angle has proven difficult; thus, the FA angle serves as a quantitative, comprehensive measure of ACFs, such as spondylolisthesis or local kyphosis.\n\nIn this study, patients with C2–7 angle ≤ 12.4° on radiography and FA angle ≥ 32.1° may have experienced deterioration in clinical condition after surgery despite good preoperative SCA. Increasing lordosis with an anterior approach or correction of the C2–7 angle may yield better PD. Even if preoperative SCA is kyphotic, postoperative SCA may improve in patients with FA angle ≤ 25° and almost-straight CSA."
