        "text": "X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been used for diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema because it can reveal the morphology of low attenuation areas. Recently, 99mTc-Technegas imaging, one of several types of scintigraphic techniques, has been used for ventilation scintigraphy. Technegas scintigraphy was performed on 15 patients with pulmonary emphysema, and we compared the extent and degree of abnormal findings on Technegas scintigraphy with the extent of low attenuation areas shown by CT. We classified the findings of Technegas imaging into three grades, from mild to severe, according to the extent of peripheral irregularity and central hot spot formation. We also classified the findings of CT as centrilobular emphysema into three grades from mild to severe according to the extent of low attention areas in the peripheral lung fields. In 5 cases, CT and Technegas assessment resulted in equivalent diagnoses. In eight cases, Technegas images showed more detailed findings than CT images. In the two remaining cases, which were diagnosed as panlobular emphysema on CT, Technegas images showed the severe stage. Technegas scintigraphy was useful for diagnostic assessment of pulmonary emphysema, especially for panlobular emphysema, which is difficult to distinguish from the normal lung condition by CT assessment.\n\nFive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) were studied to determine whether CYFRA 21-1 is useful for diagnosis of this disease. In pleural effusions, the median concentration of CYFRA 21-1 from 4 patients with MPM was significantly higher than for 34 patients with benign diseases. The sensitivity of serum CYFRA 21-1 for diagnosis of MPM was 40% and its concentration changed in proportion to disease activity in all cases. Immunohistochemically, anticytokeratin 19 antibody revealed strong staining in both epithelial and sarcomatous MPM tissues. Based on these results, we conclude that measurement of CYFRA 21-1 in pleural effusions and serum may be useful for diagnosing and monitoring MPM.\n\nSulfate and taurine are the main metabolites of L-cysteine in mammals and are excreted in the urine. The effect of a high protein diet on the ratio of sulfate to taurine excretion was studied in rats using synthetic 25% (standard protein diet group, group A) and 40% (high protein diet group, group B) casein diets. Average taurine and sulfate excretions (mumol/kg of body weight per day) were 280.4 +/- 93.8 and 943.2 +/- 144.8 in group A and 553.4 +/- 124.5 and 2675.0 +/- 390.9 in group B, respectively. Thus, the average taurine/sulfate ratio in group A was 0.30 +/- 0.08. By a single administration of 5 mmol of L-cysteine/kg of body weight in group A, the average taurine and sulfate excretions increased to 1127.5 +/- 120.2 and 4043.0 +/- 305.6, respectively, but the taurine/sulfate ratio changed only slightly (0.28). The average taurine/sulfate ratio in group B was 0.22 +/- 0.07, a significantly lower ratio than that in group A, which means that daily intake of a high protein diet resulted in more sulfate excretion. The taurine/sulfate ratio in group B was affected only slightly (0.19) by the cysteine administration as well. These results suggest that the ratio of taurine and sulfate production was determined by dietary protein content and that the increase in sulfate production is larger than that of taurine production when the intake of dietary protein is increased.\n\nAcute aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition, and may be treated with aggressive hypotensive drug therapy, but emergency surgery is often necessary. We evaluated the effectiveness of stent-grafts for the treatment of acute aortic dissection. Aortic dissection was surgically created in the descending thoracic aorta in 20 adult mongrel dogs. A stent-graft was inserted in the entry position. The tested animals were divided into 4 groups based on re-entry type and blood pressure alteration rate (AR) after acute aortic dissection. After insertion of the stent, the following results were observed: a) AR improved; b) proximal descending aorta and superior mesenteric arterial flows increased; c) cardiac function improved; and d) the dissecting aortic diameter decreased in the presence of pressure gradient group. From these results, insertion of a stent-graft to treat acute aortic dissection was judged to be effective.\n\nIntrathymic (i.t.) injection of allogenic cells without administration of anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) in neonatal recipients has induced donor-specific tolerance to subsequent cardiac allografts in rats. This study examines whether similar tactics can be successfully applied to a hamster-to-rat cardiac xenotransplantation model. Lewis neonates on their first day of life underwent i.t., subcutaneous (s.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), or intravenous (i.v.) injections of 5 x 10(7) Golden Syrian hamster splenocytes. After six weeks, the rats underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation of hamster hearts. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) was administered on the day before surgery and postoperatively to suppress antibody-mediated graft rejection. Rats given splenocytes with 80 mg/kg of CyP had the following graft survival times: 8 to 12 days for i.t. injection (mean, 9.4 days); 5 to 7 days for s.c. injection (mean, 6.6 days); 4 to 11 days for i.p. injection (mean, 7.4 days); and 4 to 13 days for i.v. injection (mean, 7.9 days). Only the extension of graft survival produced by i.t. injection was statistically significant in comparison with the rats given only CyP treatment (mean, 7.5 days; P < 0.05). Thus, it appears that i.t. injection of xenogenic splenocytes in neonatal recipients with administration of CyP, but without ALS, can prolong xenograft survival. This biological intervention may be most useful in pediatric xenotransplantation when combined with other immunomodulation techniques.\n\nThe effects of a low protein diet on the excretion of sulfate and taurine, major metabolites of L-cysteine in mammals, were studied in rats fed with synthetic 10% (group A) and 25% (group B) casein diets. The average excretions of total taurine (taurine plus hypotaurine) and total sulfate (free plus ester sulfate) (mumol/kg of body weight per day after the adaptation to the synthetic diet) in group A were 14.2 +/- 13.4 and 122.3 +/- 39.6, respectively, which were very low compared with 280.4 +/- 93.8 and 943.2 +/- 144.8, respectively, in group B. The taurine/sulfate ratio in group A was 0.12 +/- 0.11, which was significantly lower than that (0.30 +/- 0.08) in group B. A single intraperitoneal injection of 5 mmol of L-cysteine per kg of body weight in group A resulted in an increase in average taurine and sulfate excretion to 693.4 +/- 195.6 and 2440.6 +/- 270.0, respectively, and thus the average taurine/sulfate ratio increased to 0.29. These increases were transient and low taurine excretion resumed again 24 h after the L-cysteine administration. L-Cysteine injection in group B resulted in a similar increase in taurine and sulfate excretion, but the ratio changed only slightly (0.28). The present results suggest that in vivo production of taurine is reduced preferentially over sulfate production when sulfur amino acid supply is limited.\n\nTo evaluate viral interference between hepatitis B and C, we studied coinfected patients serologically and molecular biologically. Twenty-seven patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, were classified into Groups BC-L and BC-H according to DNA-polymerase activity (less or greater than 100 cpm, respectively). Patients with hepatitis B or C alone were also enrolled as controls. HCV-RNA was detected more often in Group BC-L than in Group BC-H. Genotype 1b of HCV was determined in 75% of Group BC-H, 87.5% of Group BC-L, and 70.7% of hepatitis C-only patients. Activity of DNA-polymerase in coinfected patients was lower in patients positive for HCV-RNA as compared with those negative. HBsAg titers tended to be lower in coinfected patients than in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) alone. In conclusion, in coinfection, HBV may suppress the replication of HCV and HCV appears to reduce the expression of HBsAg and probably suppresses HBV replication.</P>\n\nIn order to elucidate factors influencing the prognosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), we reviewed the records of 253 patients with SCLC and evaluated 20 pretreatment prognostic factors by univariate analysis and Cox's multiple regression analysis. Recursive partitioning and amalgamation (RPA) was employed to identify subgroups with similar survival rates. Cox's multiple regression analysis identified five significant factors: extent of disease, number of metastatic sites, serum albumin, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and presence of weight loss. Among these, extent of disease was the most influential factor. RPA analysis revealed three subgroups predicting significantly different prognoses. The median survival time and 3-year survival rate were 18.4 months and 20.6%, respectively for the good-risk group (limited disease without weight loss), 13.5 months and 9.1%, respectively for the intermediate-risk group (limited disease with weight loss or extensive disease with less than two metastatic sites), and 9.2 months and 0%, respectively for the poor-risk group (extensive disease with two or more metastatic sites). These results will be useful for development of new staging system or subsequent stratification for randomized trials."
