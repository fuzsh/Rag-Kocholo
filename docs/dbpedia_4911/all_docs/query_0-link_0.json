        "text": "in Uncategorized by KarateCoaching Admin\n\nShotokan Myth #2 Hangetsu – A missing link to Naha-te Karate\n\nIn the #47 issue (May ’96) of Shotokan Karate Magazine, late Steve Cattle wrote an article on this kata, Hangetsu. It was a needed and educational article. The title was “Hangetsu the neglected kata” where he pointed out that this kata was most unpopular. He claimed, “I feel it is a very neglected kata, generally because of the difficulty in performing the turns, the stance and its lack of beauty”. He concluded that the biggest reason why this kata is unpopular to the difficulty of turns and its stance, Hangetsu dachi. “The difficulty is in the turn, which is why I think it is neglected in competition as well as the actual stance difficulty”. I agree with most of his claims but I am afraid he has missed some key points. If you investigate the origin of this kata, you will discover the hidden history and the deep mysteries behind this unique kata.\n\nEven though Shuri-te and Naha-te do not share the same kata, Hangetsu (Seisan/Seishan) is one exception. This kata is found in almost all styles including Wado, Shito, Goju, Uechi, Shorin, Ryuei, etc. I will attempt to put the facts together and make necessary comparisons to come up with the answers to many questions. By sharing those findings, I hope the readers will come to a new appreciation and understanding when he/she performs this unique and valuable kata.\n\nThere is another article that is definitely worth reading is found in the issue #49 (Nov ‘96). The title is “Inside Tension Stances” and the sub title, “Sanchin-dachi, Neko-ashi-dachi, Hangetsu-dachi” by John Cheetham, the chief editor of this magazine. It is a 3 page article explaining whata those inside tension stances are and how they are constructed. It touches the subject that is not frequently touched and I recommend all Shotokan practitioners to read it if they have not. Unfortunately, the detailed information of Hangetsu dachi and it s very uniqueness were not mentioned or described in this article. However, I can not blame the author at all. He probably has a set of all karate textbooks such as Dynamic Karate, Karate-do Kyohan and Best Karate, but he can find only the steps of Hangetsu kata and not much else. In fact, we can find very little information on how to do this kata properly or on the details of Hangetsu dachi. The author wrote, “ – hangetsu dachi is described in most books and by most instructors as a longer version of sanchin dachi with all the same points as sanchin.” That is how it skips the detailed description of Hangetsu dachi. I will attempt to bring out the hidden facts from the history and the comparison of this kata with the other Ryuha (styles) to fill the gap in this article.

KarateCoaching is working in cooperation with Tokon Martial Arts to fulfill your orders immediately. We can only highlight what a treasure this book in its full print is (not the shortened version that was published in the past) but we also need to mention that copies are limited so we highly recommend to place your order immediately as long as stock is still available.\n\nPlease order through the website of our partner Tokon.com\n\nKarate Do Kyohan – Master Text for the Way of the Empty-Hand\n\nWritten by Master Gichin Funakoshi – The complete original 1935 Japanese Edition\n\nTranslated into English with all of the original photos and artwork\n\n8.5” x 11” Format – Softcover Edition\n\nThis classic Shotokan Karate Master Text has been printed for the explicit purpose of providing an exact reproduction of the complete original 1935 Japanese publication, preserving a historically accurate archive replica in the English language, that now can be experienced and enjoyed by all who can appreciate its significance.\n\nThis legacy, as is the true goal of Karate Do, is meant to be experienced with mind, body, and Spirit. Master Funakoshi's message is transmitted in these pages through philosophical thought, physical and mental practice methods, and most importantly, with manifest image. Each photograph of Master Funakoshi not only demonstrates the exact form and method of each technique, but is also an archetypal key to the spiritual path he followed and exemplified.\n\nThis book is a comprehensive guide for the study of karate and is credited as the foundation document of the modern day karate movement. Inner strength and personal character development are stressed through an active daily regimen of physical exercise and martial technique.\n\nKara-te Do Kyohan is Master Funakoshi's gift to mankind. An informed study will reveal that his focus in life was to share his knowledge and the benefits he acquired and experienced through a life of conscious self-discipline rooted in the principles of Karate Do.\n\nGichen Funakoshi (1868-1957) was born in Shuri, Okinawa and, as a boy, began training with Yasutsune Azato (Shuri-te) and Yasutsune Itosu (Naha-te). Through many years of diligent practice these two styles were blended and became what is known today as Shotokan Karate.\n\nA Look inside:\n\nin Uncategorized by KarateCoaching Admin\n\nShotokan Myth #1 Hikite\n\nA good hikite is necessary to make a powerful punch.\n\nHikite is a Japanese word consisting of 引 “hiki” meaning pull or draw and 手“te”, a hand.\n\nWhen I started karate training in 60’s, my first instruction was given by a senpai and he showed me how to do chudan zuki from a natural stance. I never forget him, Kato senpai. He was barely 5 foot tall but was as fast as a lightening (as I remember him doing Enpi). Anyway, Kato senpai said “Put your left hand out and set your right fist at your right hip. OK that is where you start a punch. Now, draw your left fist to your hips very quickly and at the same time you punch with your right fist, like this.” He showed me the impressive chudan seiken zuki several times in front of me. Though it looked quite simple and easy to imitate, I found the turning of a punching fist was difficult and so was drawing the other fist to the hip (hikite). He explained “You need to pay more attention to your hikite than to the punching fist. The faster and stronger you draw your hikite so will your punch become”. As it was my first day at karate training, his statement made a big impact in my head.\n\nA few months later, when I learned a kihon kumite of 5 attack (Gohon kumite), I had a problem with hikite again. As we all know after the fifth block the defender needs to throw a counter punch. As a defender, I kept my blocking hand out (rising block, down block, etc) as I delivered a counter punch. My senpai said “No! No! No! You need to do your hikite as you counter punch. Your punch will be much stronger with a strong hikite”. I thought I did a good counter punch but, no hikite was a big mistake which I had to correct. To be honest, it was difficult not only because the coordination of two arms but more so because I was afraid to lower my block hand from jodan age (rising block) as the opponent’s fist was near my head. I feared that his fist might hit my face but I later found the opponent was nice enough to hold his fist above my head.\n\nI suspect this kind of experience described above is very common for most of the people when they start karate training. I must emphasize that the correction and change forced by that senpai were right thing to do and I would have done the same thing in the same situation. In punching with a hikite two arms move to the opposite directions simultaneously. This process must become as natural as two feet move in harmony while you are walking. If you drag one foot behind and try to walk with only one foot, it will not be a smooth walk and the movement is not natural. Walking mechanism is very natural to us and hikite mechanism can also be natural to karate-ka after a year of practice. After it becomes a part of your natural move, no one thinks too deeply about it and you will have a powerful punch accompanied by a good hikite. Here one has mastered a karate technique. This is great. We are all happy. Now I can almost hear you say, “Well then, what is the problem?” (read more..)\n\nShihan Yokota has published numerous articles and books:\n\nNunchaku, an unique weapon & its benefits to Karate\n\nThe nunchaku (ヌンチャクin Japanese and 雙節棍in Chinese) is a traditional weapon of the Kobudo and consists of two sticks connected with a short chain or rope. I do not believe further introduction of Nunchaku is necessary as it became very popular among us by the Kung Fu movies in 70’s stared by Bruce Lee.\n\nOut of a dozen or so different kinds of Okinawan Kobudo weapons such as Nunchaku, Sai and Tonfa, Nunchaku is most popular or known by the public. Less known factor is that Nunchaku can produce the most dynamic and versatile techniques among the Kobudo weapons due to its construction of having two sticks joined by a chain or a rope. The quick swings and striking motions are very sexy and many people remember the fight scenes of Bruce Lee. One can spin Tonfa pretty fast but it cannot beat the speed of Nunchaku. Sai can be a deadly weapon with its sharp end as it can spear through just about any protectors, but the destructive power of Nunchaku at a full impact of said to be over 500kg is far greater than Sai or Tonfa could produce. Not only it is fast and destructive but also it has another very exciting characteristic; flexibility of two sections. I am not saying Nunchaku is a better weapon than Sai, Tonfa or other Kobudo weapons. Just as one cannot say a certain style of karate is better than another, different weapons have their own particular uses and advantages thus cannot be compared by a simple set of observations. It is very unfortunate that modern day Shotokan (at least from what I know of) has dropped Kobudo from its regular training. I do not know the situation regarding this subject in other karate styles such as Shito-ryu, Goju-ryu and Wado-ryu, so I will discuss this subject only referring to Shotokan style organizations. There was a justifiable reason (at least then) why Kobudo was dropped but I will not go into this historic aspect of karate even though it is a very interesting subject. What I want to mention here today is that karate definitely lost a very effective and useful training tools when the masters decided to drop Kobudo from its regular syllabus. I do not think they were aware at that time of the seriousness and the amount of handicap and disadvantage this omission would bring. Shotokan style now is said to be very linear and lacks circular movements.\n\nHowever, this claim is not true as one can observe the kata like (read more...)\n\nShihan Yokota has published numerous articles and books:\n\nin Uncategorized by KarateCoaching Admin\n\nTeaching Karate Part 2\n\nPart II, Areas of philosophical adaption to teaching karate\n\nThe next way an instructor can become a better Sensei would be to get someone, anyone to promote him to 8th Dan. No actually that will not make anyone a better teacher. But learning how to create a climate of Mastery might do the trick. Here is one path to Mastery, this presented to the US Olympic Coaches for the USSA at the Center of Excellence in 2012. See if these tenants do not fit nicely with karate.\n\nCompetence\n\nNo one continues an activity in which they gain little competence. Every student must have success. Avoid the old myth that the struggle is good for. Teach so the students gain competence, and point it out when they do.\n\nSMART Goal Set\n\nS specific, exactly what you want, who, where, when why, why we have written belt requirements. We need to establish a broader curriculum\n\nM measurable, you must be able to track or measure progress\n\nA action-oriented, describe a result\n\nR realistic and relevant\n\nT time based, done by when, or timed exercise with karate\n\nControl and Choice\n\nIt is only control and choice that gives a feeling of being in charge of our lives\n\nOptimism – expectancy\n\nLearning karate can be frustrating, we must build in a feeling of you can do this. This is where SMART goals come in. Kata is a good example; kids want to keep learning the next one because they believe they are gaining competence. Kata’s are easy to keep track so they are measurable goals. Kumite is more abstract, so we need drills for kumite to measure our progress.\n\nFLOW, after the seminar at the Center of Excellence I had a discussion with one of the coaches and we added Flow.\n\nThe mental state in which a person is fully immersed and feeling energized focus. Completely focused motivation. Allow the students to participate in an activity in which they do not struggle. Make certain every class has a drill “I can do” make certain in every class every student has some success.\n\nThe concept of being in the zone during an athletic performance fits within Csíkszentmihályi's description of the flow experience, and theories and applications of being in the zone and its relationship with athletic competitive advantage are topics studied in the field of sport psychology.\n\nTimothy Gallwey's influential works on the \"inner game\" of sports such as golf and tennis described the mental coaching and attitudes required to \"get in the zone\" and fully internalize mastery of the sport.\n\nRoy Palmer suggests that \"being in the zone\" may also influence movement patterns as better integration of the conscious and subconscious reflex functions improves coordination. Many athletes describe the effortless nature of their performance while achieving personal bests.\n\nMMA champion and Karate master Lyoto Machida uses meditation techniques before fights to attain mushin, a concept that, by his description, is in all respects equal to flow.\n\nThe Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, who during qualifying for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix explained: \"I was already on pole, [...] and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my teammate with the same car. And suddenly I realized that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimension. It was like I was in a tunnel.\"\n\nWhen challenges and skills are simultaneously above average, a broadly positive experience emerges.\n\nAlso vital to the flow state is a sense of control, which nevertheless seems simultaneously effortless and masterful. Control and concentration manifest with a transcendence of normal awareness; one aspect of this transcendence is the loss of self-consciousness.\n\nRole Models\n\nThe kids /students copy everything we do. Including behavior, personal dress and manners. We know that athletes that are internally motivated stay in the game longer and continually improve. So how do we change from external focus to internal focus. We follow some of the suggestions Carol Dweck made in the amazing book, “Mindset.”\n\nTarget Effort, control progress\n\nReinforce success; point out when they succeed in their effort\n\nUse Merit and truth, when a kid does something incorrect tells them. Do not say that is good enough\n\nInternalize control give a person a sense of control, you give instruction and then step back. Often we see over coaching you tell them so much what to do that they do not how to perform on their own\n\nOptimism = Strategy can you give a ten-year-old a strategy, yes, tell them you are a rocket.\n\nQuick Clear instructions, be sure to be quick and clear, and do not coach too much. Kids do not want to hear all this theory. Tell them simple things, “head up” look forward. Catch them being good or doing it well\n\nUse Fading strategy, give a suggestion and then fade away\n\nAllow small choices, allow a bit of choice in what they do, this gives them competence and independence that is part of their primary drives.\n\nOne last thought on this subject, “The task of education is to reach young people to find pleasure in the right things.” Plato\n\nto be continued with Part III, physiological windows of opportunity\n\nDoug Jepperson\n\nUSA Karate Technical Committee\n\nPark City Karate\n\nLiving at 6,500 feet above the sea."
