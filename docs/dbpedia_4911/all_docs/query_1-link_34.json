        "text": "As a first step in reconstructing the phylogeny of world stag beetles (Coleoptera: Lucanidae), phylogenetic relationships among the major members of Japanese stag beetles were explored by analyzing a sequence of 1030 nucleotides from the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene. A total of 20 species and three additional subspecies representing 13 genera were examined to provide basic information on the phylogeny of world Lucanidae. The resultant phylogenetic tree indicates that the family Lucanidae is monophyletic, and contains two major lineages: one consists of the genera Platycerus, Aesalus, Ceruchus, and Nicagus, and the other includes Dorcus, Rhaetulus, Prosopocoilus, Aegus, Neolucanus, Prismognathus, Lucanus, Figulus, and Nigidius. Generic members of the latter lineage are further divided into the following four sublineages: i) Figulus and Nigidius; ii) Prismognathus and Lucanus; iii) Aegus and Neolucanus; and iv) Dorcus, Rhaetulus, and Prosopocoilus. These molecular phylogenetic relationships are used as a basis for a preliminary exploration of the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the shape of the mandible. The results of this investigation suggest that strong sexual dimorphism with well-developed mandibles in males evolved independently at least twice, once in the genus Aegus and once in the ancestor of the Lucanus–Prismognathus and Dorcus–Rhaetulus–Prosopocoilus clades. Alternatively, it is possible that sexual dimorphism of mandibles has undergone secondary loss in the genera Figulus and Nigidius.\n\nThe free-living Platyhelminthes of the Amazon basin are poorly known. Presently only four turbellarian species have been mentioned from the Amazon river, a fact that confirms the lack of information on this kind of faunas in this huge basin. Three new species of Gieysztoria from Amazonian floodplain in Peru are described herein: G. chiqchi n. sp., G. kasasapa n. sp. and G. sasa n. sp. The samples were taken in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve (Peru) during September 2002. Besides the usual description of the stylet based on whole mounted specimens, we provide a complementary description using SEM, which allowed differentiation of the new species within the currently yet imperfect picture of the Amazonian turbellarian fauna. Although further research is desired, current findings are suggestive of high diversity of free-living Turbellaria in the surveyed region.\n\nSeasonal variation in the expression of five subtypes of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) genes, designated as msGnRH-R1, -R2, -R3, -R4, and -R5, was examined in the brain of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou). In addition, responses of these genes to GnRH were examined in a GnRH analog (GnRHa) implantation experiment. Brain samples were collected one week after the implantation every month from immaturity through spawning. The absolute amount of GnRH-R mRNA in single forebrains was determined by real-time PCR assays. Among the five genes, R4 and R5 were dominantly expressed in both sexes. R1, R4, and R5 mRNAs showed similar changes throughout the experimental period in both sexes. Levels tended to be high in winter and low in the pre-spawning season, followed by elevations in the spawning period. The mRNA levels had weak to moderate negative correlations with the plasma level of estradiol-17β (E2) in females. The effects of GnRHa on msGnRH-R mRNAs were not apparent for all the subtypes. These results indicate that the msGnRH-R1, -R4, and -R5 genes are synchronously expressed during sexual maturation. There was a trend toward decreased levels of their expression prior to the spawning period and then increased levels at spawning, possibly causing GnRH target neurons to sensitize to a GnRH stimulus. Furthermore, E2 may be involved in msGnRH-R gene expression in the brain of female masu salmon during sexual maturation.\n\nFoxO1 is a transcription factor implicated in a multitude of physiological processes including cell cycle progression, apoptosis and insulin signaling. Recent findings indicate that FoxO1 is a key regulator during the proliferation and maturation of granulosa cells. Over the past several years, it has become evident that nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP modulate ovarian function. There has been no information, however, about whether NO-cGMP affects FoxO1 expression or about the relationship between NO-cGMP and FoxO1. In the present study, we used immunoblot analysis to determine whether NO and cGMP affect FoxO1 expression in cultured granulosa cells. Our results clearly showed that FSH suppressed FoxO1 expression in a time-dependent manner, and that NO-cGMP stimulated FoxO1 expression in cultured granulosa cells. In addition, this stimulatory effects of NO and cGMP can be blocked by FSH in cultured granulosa cells. These findings demonstrate that NO and cGMP influence FoxO1 expression possibly through antagonizing the action of FSH in cultured granulosa cells. Results of both immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry also show that estradiol implantation do not affect the expression of FoxO1 in rat granulosa cells as gonadotrophins do, indicating that mechanism of estradiol on granulosa cells is different from gonadotrophins. Together, our experiments suggest that expression of FoxO1 in rat granulosa cells can be regulated by gonadotrophins and the NO/cGMP signaling pathway.\n\nThe oribatid mite fauna of Turkey is still relatively poorly known. The present paper adds two species of oribatid mites to the known Turkish fauna viz., Oribatula (Zygoribatula) debilitranslamellata (Kulijev, 1962) and O. (Z.)exilis (Nicolet, 1855). Both species are characterised by large, prominent lamellar cusps, with the lamellar setae inserted apically on the cusps, and by the presence of distinct translamellae. They can be distinguished, however, by the smaller lamellae, absence of cuspidal teeth, narrowly fusiform sensilli and, 13 pairs of thin, smooth, apically almost flagellate notogastral setae, in O. (Z.) debilitranslamellata, and by the wider lamellae, presence of cuspidal teeth, widely fusiform sensilli, and 14 pairs of thin, smooth notogastral setae, with seta c1 slightly thicker and minutely barbed in O. (Z.)exilis. The following species have been previously reported from Turkey: O. (Z.)cognata (Oudemans, 1902), O. (Z.) undulata (Berlese, 1917), O. (Z.) terricola Van der Hammen, 1952, and O. (Z.) lanceolata Grobler, Bayram & Çobanoglu, 2004.\n\nPotamothrix scleropenis sp. nov. (Tubificidae: Tubificinae) is described from the profundal zone (74 m) of Fuxian Lake, the deepest lake (up to 155 m) on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in China. The new species is assigned to Potamothrix because of its short vasa deferentia and its tubular atria without ejaculatory ducts and prostate glands. It differs from congeners by its cuticularized penis sheaths; bifurcated, strongly curved spermathecal chaetae; bifurcated lower prongs of bifids; and feathered hairs. P. scleropenis appears closely related to P. cekanovskajae Finogenova, 1972 and P. tudoranceai Sporka, 1994, since all the three species have homogeneous atria without prostate glands."
