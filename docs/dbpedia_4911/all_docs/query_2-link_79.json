The [110] and [001] directions of the BaFe12O19 layer were parallel to the [010] and [001] directions of the mica, respectively. In the synthesis process, amorphous BaFe12O19 films were firstly prepared on Al2O3-buffered mica (001) substrates and then annealed at 800 °C–900 °C in air for single crystallization. During optimization of the synthesis, we found that preparation of the buffer layer and controlling annealing temperature are important for obtaining the epitaxial sheet. The sheets exhibited perpendicular ferrimagnetism with large saturated magnetization (60 Am2 kg−1) and magnetic anisotropy coefficient (2.1 × 105 J m−3) at 300 K, together with flexibility.\n\nYujun Zhang, Tsukasa Katayama, Akira Chikamatsu, Christian Schü{\\ss}ler-Langeheine, Niko Pontius, Yasuyuki Hirata, Kou Takubo, Kohei Yamagami, Keisuke Ikeda, Kohei Yamamoto, Tetsuya Hasegawa, Hiroki Wadati\n\nCommunications Physics 5 (1) 2399-3650 2022/12\n\nAbstractInvestigation of ultrafast dynamic behaviors can provide novel insights about the coupling mechanisms among multiple degrees of freedom in condensed matters, such as lattice, magnetism and electronic structure. Here we investigate both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) dynamics of a strongly correlated oxide system, GdBaCo2O5.5 thin film by time-resolved x-ray magnetic circular dichroism in reflectivity (XMCDR) and resonant magnetic x-ray diffraction (RMXD). A photo-induced AFM-FM transition characterized by an increase of the transient XMCDR (sensitive to FM order) beyond the unpumped value and a decay of RMXD (sensitive to AFM order) was observed. The photon-energy dependence of the transient XMCDR and reflectivity could be interpreted as a concomitant photo-induced spin-state transition (SST). The AFM-FM transition and SST couple with each other in the time domain, resulting in unusual dynamic behaviors of the magnetism.\n\nLing Wang, Tsukasa Katayama, Chaoyue Wang, Qin Li, Yun Shi, Yuqiang Fang, Fuqiang Huang, Yinghao Zhu, Hai-feng Li, Shintaro Yasui, Xintang Huang, Jianding Yu\n\nAIP Advances 12 (6) 065015 - 065015 2022/06/01\n\nGaFeO3-type oxides are promising multiferroic materials due to the coexistence of spontaneous magnetization and ferroelectric polarization properties at room temperature. As these ferroic properties feature a large anisotropy, single crystals are required. However, the magnetization of GaFeO3-type single crystals remains low at room temperature. In this study, we largely enhanced the magnetization at room temperature of GaFeO3-type single crystals by increasing the Fe content and co-doping Sc3+ and Al3+. Single crystals of Al xSc0.1− xGa0.6Fe1.3O3 ( x = 0.01–0.04) were prepared using the optical floating-zone method. The single crystals were rod-shaped, with a diameter and length of ∼6 mm and 7 cm, respectively. X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the ferroelectric polarization of the crystals. In addition, they exhibited room-temperature ferrimagnetism, with Curie temperature in the range of 326–338 K; the crystals exhibit magnetic anisotropy along the a-axis. The magnetization of the single crystal at 300 K and 0.3 kOe was 13 emu g−1, which is over ten times larger than those of previously reported single crystals with GaFeO3-type crystal structure.\n\nShota Fukuma, Akira Chikamatsu, Tsukasa Katayama, Takahiro Maruyama, Keiichi Yanagisawa, Koji Kimoto, Miho Kitamura, Koji Horiba, Hiroshi Kumigashira, Yasushi Hirose, Tetsuya Hasegawa\n\nPhysical Review Materials 6 (3) 2475-9953 2022/03/23\n\nLayered ruthenium oxyfluorides have various crystal structures and Ru oxidation states and exhibit unique physical properties. While various layered ruthenates have reportedly been topochemically fluorinated with Sr as A sites, investigation of the fluorination of layered ruthenates containing smaller Ca ions is lacking. In this paper, we fabricated phase-pure and single-crystalline thin films of Ca2RuO2.5F2 on LaSrAlO4 (001) substrates via topochemical fluorination of the Ca2RuO4 precursor using polyvinylidene fluoride. The obtained fluorinated thin films had a chemical composition of Ca2RuO2.5F2 with the Ru3+ state, as determined by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, whereas the film prepared via Sr2Ru4+O4 fluorination had a composition of (Sr2Ru4+O3F2). Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that Ca2RuO2.5F2 has only 1 F- site in CaO rock-salt blocks, whereas Sr2RuO3F2 has two inequivalent F- sites in the SrO layers. The Ca2RuO2.5F2 film was insulating, with a resistivity (rho) of 8.6 x 10(-2) Omega cm at 300 K. Moreover, the temperature behavior of rho was well described by the two-dimensional variable range hopping model. These results demonstrate that local distortion is an important factor that governs the topochemical fluorination of ruthenates and affects the crystal and electronic structures of the reactants.\n\nTsukasa Katayama, Akira Chikamatsu, Yujun Zhang, Shintaro Yasui, Hiroki Wadati, Tetsuya Hasegawa\n\nChemistry of Materials 33 (14) 5675 - 5680 0897-4756 2021/07/27\n\nDouble-perovskite GdBaCo2O5.5 (GBCO) exhibits various fascinating features, including temperature- and magnetic-field-induced ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition associated with the two ionic orders: an A-site Gd/Ba order along the c-axis, and an octahedral CoO6/pyramidal CoO5 order along the b-axis. However, the fine control of ionic orders remains a challenging issue. Herein, we demonstrate the engineering of ionic orders in GBCO films through appropriate selection of substrates. Specifically, we prepared four kinds of films comprising only the Gd/Ba order [on SrTiO3(001)], only the CoO6/CoO5 order [on LaSrGaO4(001)], and both the Gd/Ba and CoO6/CoO5 orders [on NdGaO3(110) and LaSrAlO4(001) (LSAO)]. In addition to the selective ionic orders through substrate selection, the GBCO film on LSAO also contained multiple domains with domain boundaries of [CoOx]-[CoOy] stacking. Magnetic, magnetoresistance, and resonant X-ray magnetic diffraction measurements revealed that the magnetic properties of the above GBCO films were widely modulated. With the ionic order control of the GBCO film, different magnetic phase transition behaviors and magnetic anisotropy switching from the in-plane to perpendicular direction were observed.\n\nJun Kasahara, Tsukasa Katayama, Shishin Mo, Akira Chikamatsu, Yosuke Hamasaki, Shintaro Yasui, Mitsuru Itoh, Tetsuya Hasegawa\n\nACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 13 (3) 4230 - 4235 2021/01/27\n\nThe antiferroelectric (AFE) phase, in which nonpolar and polar states are switchable by an electric field, is a recent discovery in promising multiferroics of hexagonal rare-earth manganites (ferrites), h-RMn(Fe)O3. However, this phase has so far only been observed at 60-160 K, which restricts key investigations into the microstructures and magnetoelectric behaviors. Herein, we report the successful expansion of the AFE temperature range (10-300 K) by preparing h-DyFeO3 films through epitaxial stabilization. Room-temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals that the AFE phase originates from a nanomosaic structure comprising AFE P3̅c1 and ferroelectric P63cm domains with small domain sizes of 1-10 nm. The nanomosaic structure is stabilized by a low c/a ratio derived from the large ionic radius of Dy3+. Furthermore, weak ferromagnetism and magnetocapacitance behaviors are observed. Below 10 K, the film exhibits an M-shaped magnetocapacitance versus magnetic field curve, indicating unusual magnetoelectric coupling in the AFE phase.\n\nHui Wang, Yang Zhang, Koki Tachiyama, Zhaoyang Xia, Jinghong Fang, Qin Li, Guofeng Cheng, Yun Shi, Ji, ing Yu, Tsukasa Katayama, Shintaro Yasui, Mitsuru Itoh\n\nInorganic Chemistry 60 (1) 225 - 230 1520-510X 2021/01/04\n\nGaFeO3-type iron oxides are promising multiferroics due to the coexistence of large spontaneous magnetization and polarization near room temperature. However, the high leakage current and difficulties associated with synthesizing single crystals E-induced make it difficult to achieve two important features in the system: a P switching large ferroelectric polarization switching and magnetoelectric coupling at a high-temperature region. Herein, we report successful achievement of these features by preparing high-quality Sc-doped GaFeO3 single crystals (ScxGa1-x/2Fe1-x/2O3 with x= 0-0.3) using the floating zone method. The x >= 0.05 crystals exhibit a leakage current 10(4) times lower than the x = 0 crystals, highlighting the importance of Sc doping. Because of the reduced leakage current, the Sc-doped crystals exhibit large ferroelectric polarization switching along the c-axis with a remanent polarization of 22-25 mu C/cm(2), which is close to the theoretically predicted polarization value of 25-28 mu C/cm(2). In addition, the Sc-doped crystals exhibit ferrimagnetism with magnetic anisotropy along the a-axis. Furthermore, a magnetic-field-induced modulation of polarization is observed in the x = 0.15 crystal even at a relatively high temperature, i.e., 100 K.\n\nAkira Chikamatsu, Tsukasa Katayama, Takahiro Maruyama, Miho Kitamura, Koji Horiba, Hiroshi Kumigashira, Hiroki Wadati, Tetsuya Hasegawa\n\nApplied Physics Letters 118 (1) 012401 - 012401 0003-6951 2021/01/04\n\nIn this study, the electronic structures of A-site layer-ordered double perovskite YBaCo2O6 and YBaCo2O5.3 epitaxial thin films were investigated by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (PES), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements. The valence band PES spectrum of the YBaCo2O6 thin film exhibited a finite density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy (EF), while that of the YBaCo2O5.3 thin film exhibited no DOS at EF, corresponding well with the metallic and insulating transport properties, respectively. The Co L-edge XAS measurements revealed that the Co ions in YBaCo2O6 are in a mixed valence state of high-spin (HS) Co3+ (50%) and intermediate spin (IS) Co4+ (50%), while HS Co3+ (80%) and HS Co2+ (20%) coexist in YBaCo2O5.3. The XMCD measurements led to the conclusion that both HS Co3+ and IS Co4+ contribute to the ferromagnetism of YBaCo2O6.\n\nKe Gu, Tsukasa Katayama, Shintaro Yasui, Akira Chikamatsu, Sou Yasuhara, Mitsuru Itoh, Tetsuya Hasegawa\n\nAdvanced Functional Materials 30 (28) 2001236 - 2001236 1616-301X 2020/07/25\n\nSynthetic techniques to prepare large-size, flexible, and high-quality single-crystalline sheets of transition metal oxides are crucial to developing low-energy consumption devices. One promising way is a lift-off and transfer technique using a heterostructure of polymer supporting oxide and Sr3Al2O6 (SAO) layers grown on a single-crystalline substrate. By removing the water-soluble SAO and the supporting layers, the oxide sheet is obtained. Although some ferroelectric flexible sheets are prepared by this method, a simpler method for obtaining large-size sheets is required. Herein, a lift-off and transfer method is proposed without a supporting layer. With this simple method, single-crystalline SrRuO3 and BaTiO3 flexible sheets with a lateral size of a few millimeters are successfully prepared. The SrRuO3 sheet exhibits high crystallinity and conductivity. Meanwhile, the ferroelectricity of the BaTiO3 sheet is successfully observed via polarization hysteresis loop measurements. In addition to the simplicity, this method has low costs and the substrate is reusable. Accordingly, the proposed method could enhance the development of various kinds of large-size functional oxide sheets.\n\nTsukasa Katayama\n\nInorganic Chemistry 59 (7) 4357 - 4365 1520-510X 2020/04/06\n\nepsilon-Fe2O3, a metastable phase of iron oxide, is widely known as a room-temperature multiferroic material or as a superhard magnet. Element substitution into epsilon-Fe2O3 has been reported in the literature; however, the substituted ions have a strong site preference depending on their ionic radii and valence. In this study, in order to characterize the crystal structure and magnetic properties of epsilon-Fe2O3 in the Fe2+/Fe3+ coexisting states, Li+ was electrochemically inserted into epsilon-Fe2O3 to reduce Fe3+. The discharge and charge of Li+ into/from epsilon-Fe2O3 revealed that Li+ insertion was successful. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism results indicated that the reduced Fe did not exhibit site preference. Increasing the Li+ content in epsilon-Fe2O3 resulted in decreased saturation magnetization and irregular variation of the coercive field. We present a comprehensive discussion of how magnetic properties are modified with increasing Li+ content using transmission electron microscopy images and considering the L+ diffusion coefficient. The results suggest that inserting L+ into crystalline epsilon-Fe2O3 is a useful tool for characterizing crystal structure, lithiation limit, and magnetic properties in the coexistence of Fe2+/Fe3+.\n\nAkira Chikamatsu, Takahiro Maruyama, Tsukasa Katayama, Yu Su, Yoshihiro Tsujimoto, Kazunari Yamaura, Miho Kitamura, Koji Horiba, Hiroshi Kumigashira, Tetsuya Hasegawa\n\nPhysical Review Materials 4 (2) 2020/02/18\n\nPerovskite chromium oxyfluoride SrCrO2.6F0.4 epitaxial thin films were fabricated via low-temperature topotactic fluorination of SrCrO2.8 precursor with polyvinylidene fluoride as a fluorine source. The obtained SrCrO2.6F0.4 thin film had a different chemical composition than that of bulk polycrystalline SrCrO2.8F0.2, possibly due to the higher reactivity of such thin film. Both the precursor and fluorinated thin films containing Cr3.6+ exhibited insulating behavior with band gaps of ∼0.6 eV, in contrast to metallic SrCrO3 with Cr4+ at 300 K. The experimentally observed valence and conduction bands of the SrCrO2.8, SrCrO3, and SrCrO2.6F0.4 thin films suggested that the spectral weight transfer from the coherent part to the incoherent part with the reduction of Cr valences was caused by strong electron correlation effects. This study offers a fundamental understanding of the fluorine doping effects on a crystalline structure and the correlated electronic performance of chromium oxides.\n\nTakahiro Maruyama, Akira Chikamatsu, Tsukasa Katayama, Kenta Kuramochi, Hiraku Ogino, Miho Kitamura, Koji Horiba, Hiroshi Kumigashira, Tetsuya Hasegawa\n\nJournal of Materials Chemistry C 8 (24) 8268 - 8274 2050-7534 2020\n\nWe fabricated layered-perovskite Sr2IrO4-xF2x thin films by combining pulsed-laser deposition with topotactic fluorination and investigated their structures, electronic states, and electron transport properties. In the fluorination process, the insertion of fluorine into SrO rock-salt layers and the partial removal of oxygen occurred simultaneously while keeping Ir4+. The fluorine amount was evaluated to be 2x ≈ 3, which was much larger than the bulk value. Optical and photoemission measurements revealed that the effective total angular momentum Jeff = 3/2 is stabilized upon fluorination owing to the large electronegativity of fluorine. The Sr2IrO4-xF2x film exhibited a semiconducting behavior described by Efros-Shklovskii variable-range hopping with ρ(T) ≈ T-1/2. These results will be useful for modifying electronic states by anion doping to explore unprecedented physical properties in Ruddlesden-Popper-type iridates.

These types of materials are being studied to observe simultaneous ferrimagnetism and ferroelectricity, and the possibility of coupling between the two. However, it is difficult to realise ferroelectric properties at room temperature, due to the low resistivity of the films. In this work, we have optimized the synthesis conditions to obtain x-AFO (0.5 <= x <= 1) thin films with high resistance. While magnetic measurements confirmed room temperature ferrimagnetism of the films, the maximum magnetization was observed for the composition x = 0.8. In addition, the Curie temperature was found to be influenced by oxygen pressure during deposition. Ferroelectric measurements on the films showed small remnant polarization (similar to 0.5-2 mu C cm(-2)). In contrast, the predicted polarization from first principles calculations was calculated to be between 21 and 26 mu C cm(-2). The analysis also suggested that ferroelectric domain-switching occurs through shearing of in-plane oxygen layers. The presence of multiple in-plane domains, which oppose polarization switching of adjacent domains, is suggested to be the cause of the small observed polarization. The magnetocapacitance measurements showed weak magnetic coupling with the capacitance.\n\nTsukasa Katayama\n\nJournal of the Ceramic Society of Japan 127 (7) 474 - 477 1882-0743 2019/07/01\n\nRhxFe2-xO3 solid-solution epitaxial thin films were prepared by pulsed laser deposition.

The current work investigates the effect of thin film deposition conditions on the ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic properties of Al0.5Fe1.5O3 (0.5-AFO). Substrate temperature and oxygen partial pressure during deposition were found to be the critical parameters in obtaining high quality films. Optimizing the deposition conditions of 0.5-AFO enabled observation of both ferroelectricity and ferrimagnetism at room temperature.\n\nTsukasa Katayama\n\nMRS Advances 4 (1) 61 - 66 2059-8521 2019\n\nAbstractκ-Al2O3-type GaFeO3 is a promising multiferroic material due to the coexistence of a large spontaneous magnetization and polarization near room temperature. In the current study, we present the magnetic properties of single crystalline GaFeO3 and compare it with that of ε-Fe2O3. Magnetic measurements revealed that spontaneous magnetization appears below 540 K in two steps, similar to that reported for ε−Fe2O3. Partial magnetic ordering takes place at 540 K (TN1), with Fe3+ ions in two distorted octahedral sites ordering antiparallel to one another. Upon further cooling at 200 K (TN2), the remaining Fe3+ ions in regular octahedra and tetrahedra order antiparallel to one another. Substitution of Ga for Fe in ε-Fe2O3 leads to a decrease in TN1 and TN2 from 850 to 540 K and from 480 to 200 K, respectively, caused by a dilution of magnetic Fe by nonmagnetic Ga and preferential site occupation of Ga.\n\nZhang, Minghui, Yasui, Shintaro, Katayama, Tsukasa, Rao, Badari Narayana, Wen, Haiqin, Pan, Xiuhong, Tang, Meibo, Ai, Fei, Itoh, Mitsuru\n\nMaterials (Basel, Switzerland) 12 (2) 2019\n\nA Sol-gel method assisted with spin-coating has been successfully used to grow orthorhombic GaFeO₃ epitaxial films on SrTiO₃ (111) substrates for the first time. The film with Pna2₁ crystal structure has been grown along the c-axis. The rocking curve of (004) reflection shows that the Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) value could be determined to be 0.230°, indicating good single crystallinity and high quality. X-ray Φ scan reveals a three-fold symmetry of the substrate and a six-fold symmetry of the film, respectively. The in-plane domains rotate 60° from each other in the film. Uniform film with dense structure, columnar grains with similar grain size was obtained. The thickness of the film was evaluated to be ~170 nm. The roughness value (RMS) measured by AFM was 4.5 nm, revealing a flat film. The in-plane Magnetization versus Magnetic field (M-H) curve at 5 K performs a typical ferri- or ferromagnetic hysteresis loop with a saturated magnetization (Ms) value of 136 emu/cm³. The Curie temperature could be determined to be 174 K. Compared to Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD), the sol-gel method can prepare large area films with low cost. These new films show promising applications in multiferroic devices.\n\nKatayama, Tsukasa, Chikamatsu, Akira, Hirose, Yasushi, Minohara, Makoto, Kumigashira, Hiroshi, Harayama, Isao, Sekiba, Daiichiro, Hasegawa, Tetsuya\n\nJournal of Materials Chemistry C 6 (13) 3445 - 3450 2050-7526 2018\n\nA-site cation-ordered perovskite cobaltite, RBaCo2Ox (R = rare earth element), exhibits fascinating physical properties, such as spin-state ordering and high oxygen conductivity, because of the large tetragonal distortion of the Co orbital. However, the distorted coordination geometry prefers oxygen vacancies, resulting in a difficulty in obtaining the stoichiometric phase (x = 6). For example, x in YBaCo2Ox, which has largely distorted Co orbitals because of the small size of Y3+, has so far been limited to 5.52. To expand the available range of x, in this study, we performed a low-temperature topotactic oxidation of YBaCo2O5.3 epitaxial films using a strong oxidizing agent NaClO. The x value can be varied in a wide range of 5.3-6.0, maintaining the A-site cation-ordered perovskite structure, by changing the pH and temperature of NaClO. The single crystalline film with x = 6 exhibits large tetragonal distortion (c/a = 0.968) because of the small ionic radius of Y3+ and substrate-induced tensile strain. Unlike antiferromagnetic insulating YBaCo2O5.5, the fully oxidized film with x = 6 exhibits in-plane ferromagnetism and metallicity with a Curie temperature of 130 K possibly because of the double-exchange interaction between Co3+ and Co4+. Moreover, the YBaCo2O6 film exhibits huge magnetic anisotropy with a magnetic anisotropy constant of 1.5 x 10(8) erg cm(-3), demonstrating that the A-site cation-ordered perovskite structure is promising for obtaining high magnetocrystalline anisotropic materials.\n\nKawahara, K., Chikamatsu, A., Katayama, T., Onozuka, T., Ogawa, D., Morikawa, K., Ikenaga, E., Hirose, Y., Harayama, I., Sekiba, D., Fukumura, T., Hasegawa, T.\n\nCrystengcomm 19 (2) 313 - 317 2017\n\nWe investigated the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-mediated topotactic fluorination of two perovskite ruthenate thin films with different crystallographic structures, non-layered perovskite SrRuO3 and layered perovskite Sr2RuO4. While the former ruthenate did not react with PVDF, the latter was fluorinated to form Sr2RuO3F2 with a structure that exhibited a largely expanded c-axis. These results indicate that fluorine ions are preferentially inserted into the SrO rocksalt blocks in perovskite ruthenates, and that the oxygen atoms in the precursor oxide were partially removed upon fluorination. Finally, we noted that the Sr2RuO3F2 film was insulating, with a resistivity of 4.1 × 10 Ω cm at 300 K. It should be noted that this resistivity is five orders of magnitude higher than that of the metallic Sr2RuO4 film (6.7 × 104 Ω cm).\n\nOnozuka, Tomoya, Chikamatsu, Akira, Katayama, Tsukasa, Hirose, Yasushi, Harayama, Isao, Sekiba, Daiichiro, Ikenaga, Eiji, Minohara, Makoto, Kumigashira, Hiroshi, Hasegawa, Tetsuya\n\nAcs Applied Materials & Interfaces 9 (12) 10882 - 10887 1944-8244 2017\n\nPerovskite nickel oxides are of fundamental as well as technological interest because they show large resistance modulation associated with phase transition as a function of the temperature and chemical composition. Here, the effects of fluorine doping in perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 epitaxial thin films are investigated through a low-temperature reaction with polyvinylidene fluoride as the fluorine source. The fluorine content in the fluorinated NdNiO3-xFx films is controlled with precision by varying the reaction time. The fully fluorinated film (x approximate to 1) is highly insulating and has a bandgap of 2.1 eV, in contrast to NdNiO3, which exhibits metallic transport properties. Hard X-ray photoelectron and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopies reveal the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level as well as the reduction of nickel ions (valence state changes from +3 to +2) after fluorination, suggesting that the strong Coulombic repulsion in the Ni 3d orbitals associated with the fluorine substitution drives the metal-to-insulator transition. In addition, the resistivity of the fluorinated films recovers to the original value for NdNiO3 after annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. By application of the reversible fluorination process to transition-metal oxides, the search for resistance-switching materials could be accelerated.\n\nKatayama, Tsukasa, Chikamatsu, Akira, Fukumura, Tomoteru, Hasegawa, Tetsuya\n\nJapanese Journal of Applied Physics Institute of Physics 55 (4) 04EJ05 0021-4922 2016\n\nA-site cation-ordered perovskite YBaCo2Oxepitaxial films were synthesized by combining pulsed-laser deposition and topotactic reduction using CaH2. The oxygen contents (x) of the films could be controlled in a range of 4.5–5.5 by adjusting the reaction temperature. The c-axis length of the YBaCo2Oxfilms decreased with decreasing x when x ≥ 5.3 but drastically increased when x ∼ 4.5. In contrast, the in-plane lattice constants remained locked-in by the substrate after the reaction. The metal insulator transition observed in bulk YBaCo2O5.5was substantially suppressed in the present film, likely because of the epitaxial strain effect. The resistivity of the films was significantly enhanced by changing the x value from ∼5.5 to ∼4.5, reflecting the distortion of the CoOxlayers.\n\nKatayama, Tsukasa, Chikamatsu, Akira, Kamisaka, Hideyuki, Kumigashira, Hiroshi, Hasegawa, Tetsuya\n\nApplied Physics Express Institute of Physics 9 (2) 25801 - 25801 1882-0778 2016\n\nWe investigated the electronic structure of perovskite SrFeO3−xFx(0.6 ≤ x ≤ 1) films by optical absorption, photoemission, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies, as well as density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. The optical bandgap expanded with x, yielding a wider direct bandgap for the SrFeO2F film than for the LaFeO3film. The DFT calculations suggested that the majority of FeO4F2octahedra in the SrFeO2F film had cis configurations and that the enlarged bandgap mainly originated from bond bending in the O–Fe–O chains. We experimentally observed the valence and conduction bands of the SrFeO2F film, and found them to be qualitatively consistent with the results of DFT-based calculations.\n\nJapan Society for the Promotion of Science：Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research\n\nDate (from‐to) : 2018/04 -2020/03\n\nAuthor : Katayama Tsukasa\n\nI fabricated single-crystalline SrRuO3 and BaTiO3 flexible sheets with a few millimeters lateral size.
