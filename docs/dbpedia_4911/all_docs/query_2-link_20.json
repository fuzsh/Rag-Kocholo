A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis and biological features of GC is necessary to further inform and enhance early detection and treatment methods. One of the main strategies for the improvement of GC diagnosis and treatment is the identification of novel biomarkers that could be used to develop new tools for diagnosis and targets for treatment (1). While we have identified several GC-specific genes (2), definitive biomarkers for accurately detecting GC and/or predicting the survival of GC patients are still lacking.\n\nGremlin1, a product of GREM1, is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist against several classes of BMPs (3). BMPs are well known as part of the TGF-Î² superfamily and play an important regulatory role during organogenesis in the embryonic phase (4). In normal colon crypts, GREM1 is expressed by the intestinal peri-crypt fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells of the muscular mucosa, creating an increasing gradient toward the crypt. This gradient contributes to maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche in the colonic basal crypt region (5), which indicates that GREM1 expression may influence the progression of colorectal cancer. Gremlin1 is reportedly expressed in the myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells at the bottom of crypts (5), as well as the crypt epithelium (6), and has been shown to be overexpressed in the epithelial cells of sporadic colorectal traditional serrated adenomas and in CRC (7, 8). Although one study has investigated the prognostic value of Gremlin1 expression in CRC cells (9), no studies have described the clinical significance of GREM1/Gremlin1 expression in GC. The present study evaluated the expression and role of Gremlin1 in GC by analyzing its expression and distribution using immunohistochemistry and examining the relationship between Gremlin1 positivity and clinicopathological features, including the prognostic significance. We also assessed the correlation between Gremlin1 expression and mucin phenotypes, which could provide evidence of a correlation between Gremlin1 expression and genetic background in GC.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Authors thank Mr. Shinichi Norimura for his technical assistance.
