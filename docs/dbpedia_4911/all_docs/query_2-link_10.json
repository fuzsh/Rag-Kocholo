Suizo. Vol 30, No 1, pp 123–136.\n\nAim: The aim of this study was to clarify the severity assessment and treatment strategy for patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) in Japanese hospitals.\n\nMethods: A nationwide survey was conducted targeting patients with AP who were treated in Japanese hospitals in 2011. Clinical data of 2,694 patients were accumulated and analyzed.1\n\nResults: There are two independent scoring systems for severity assessment of AP in Japan; one is a prognostic score and the other is a contrast-enhanced CT grade (CECT grade). It is recommended that the severity assessment bemade immediately after the diagnosis and repeated over time (especially within 48 hour of the diagnosis).2 The severity of patients with AP, which was estimated by the Japanese severity scoring system on admission, was well correlated with the in-hospital mortality (Fig. 1). The utility of the following treatments were addressed; early fluid therapy, early enteral nutrition therapy, early use of antibiotics and protease inhibitors, continuous regional arterial infusion (CRAI) of protease inhibitor and antibiotics therapy and blood purification therapy. Currently, 14.7% of patients in Japan with severe AP underwent CRAI of protease inhibitor. Moreover, the utility of endoscopic treatment for acute gallstone pancreatitis and walled-off necrosis (WON) were also addressed.\n\nConclusion: Early severity assessment according to the Japanese severity scoring systemwas useful. Prospective studies are necessary to estimate the efficacy of each therapy, such as CRAI of protease inhibitor, which is currently performed in some Japanese hospitals.3\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.

Suizo. Vol 30, No 4, pp 626–632.\n\nWe noticed a high degree of fatty changes in the pancreatic parenchyma of the pancreatic body in 3 of 14 patients with pancreatic carcinoma in situ. The fatty changes were observed along the lesions of pancreatic carcinoma in situ on histopathological examination. In 1 patient, the cancerous lesion had spread widely along the dilated branch and main pancreatic duct of the pancreatic body, and abdominal contrast enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) showed wide fatty change replacing the pancreatic parenchyma around the dilated pancreatic ducts (Figure 1A). In the other 2 patients, the cancerous lesions were recognized in the branch of the pancreatic duct of the pancreatic body, and fatty changes of the pancreatic body were visualized locally on CE-CT (Figure 1B, 1C). The size of the fatty change depended on the width of the carcinoma in situ. Interactions between the pancreatic carcinoma in situ and fatty changes of the pancreatic parenchyma are unclear. We speculate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activation is the key to these phenomena. Pancreatic cancer involves abundant fibrosis in the tissue that can contribute to the progression of pancreatic cancer.1 Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is responsible for the fibrosis.2 Activation of PPARγ suppresses TGFβ activity and leads to advancement of pancreatic cancer3 and inhibition of tumor progression and metastasis by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.4 We believe that PPARγ activation prevents the progression of carcinoma in situ to advanced pancreatic cancer and induces adipogenesis of pancreatic stellate cells5 and fatty changes around the carcinoma in situ.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.

Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 654–662.\n\nBackground: Surgical resection is the only treatment expected to cure pancreatic cancer but is very invasive. It usually causes severe stress in patients and may cause pain and deterioration of quality of life (QOL). Data that patients provide about their QOL are essential for describing patient symptomatology and evaluating care in order to adequately manage symptoms of the disease.1\n\nAim: To determine the level of health-relatedQOL (HRQOL) and symptoms of pancreatic cancer patients 3 months after surgical intervention.\n\nMaterials and Methods: We statistically evaluated the correlation between the Short Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2 Standard, Japanese),2,3 which measures HRQOL, and specific symptoms of hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer using data acquired from 33 postoperative pancreatic cancer patients: subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (SSPPD), 16 patients; distal pancreatectomy (DP), 15 patients; total pancreatectomy (TP), 1 patient; bypass surgery, 1 patient.\n\nResults: Deterioration ofQOLwas observed inmany parameters of SF-36v2 at 3 months postoperatively. In particular, physical functioning (PF) (p <0.001), role physical (RP) (p <0.01), vitality (VT) (p <0.05) and role emotional (RE) (p <0.05) were significantly reduced in the SSPPD patients. (Fig. 1) Our data also revealed that appetite loss (PF, RP, general health (GH), VT, RE, mental health (MH) (p <0.01-0.05)), discomfort or pain in the stomach area (RP, BP, GH, VT, SF, MH (p <0.01-0.05)), and general fatigue and discontent with change in appearance (PF, RP, GH, VT, SF, RE, MH (p <0.01)) correlated with QOL deterioration. (Fig. 1)\n\nConclusion: QOL can be improved by a combination of treatments for symptoms related to digestion and absorption, management of nutrition and treatment for subjective symptoms including fatigue.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.

Department of Surgery, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 649–653.\n\nSince chronic pancreatitis can mimic pancreatic cancer, differentiating these two entities is clinically important. A survey focusing on the misdiagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinomawas conducted by the Research Committee of Intractable Diseases of the Pancreas, supported by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. From 2001 to 2011, 125 patients ultimately found to have chronic pancreatitis, had a preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma and underwent resection. During the same time period, 26 patients with pancreatic carcinomawere observed because they were thought to have chronic pancreatitis. All of these patients were registered in 29 institutions. In a second survey, 78 patients and 15 patients were registered by 23 institutions, respectively. These 78 patients included 55 men and 23 women. The average age is 61 years.A tumorwas present in 68 patientswith a mean size of 2.9 cm. CT scan, abdominal ultrasonography, MRI, ERCP, endoscopic ultrasound, and PET scan were performed in 100%, 77%, 71%, 81%, 65%, and 35% of patients, respectively. These patients preoperatively suspected of having pancreatic cancer were pathologically diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis (n = 43, 55%), autoimmune pancreatitis (n = 28, 36%), and other (n = 7, 9%) after resection (Fig. 1). At the time of preoperative diagnosis, 22 patients with benign disease had a pathological examination such as cytology and biopsy, and 12 patients had class IVor Von EndoscopicUltrasound-guided Fine Needle Aspirationcytology (EUS-FNA) and/or brush cytology from the pancreatic duct. Few cytological false positives have been previously reported in the literature. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of preoperative cytology in patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma in order to avoid unnecessary surgery.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.

Suizo. Vol 30, No 2, pp 233–242.\n\nA 63-year-old man complaining of severe, acute pain in his upper abdomen was brought to our hospital by ambulance. He had a hypodense 50-mm tumor in the body of the pancreas, as observed in the early phase of dynamic computed tomography. (Fig. 1 A) The tumor had blood and cystic components but no capsule or calcification. Several small liver tumors were noted; on biopsy, they were consistent with metastases from a pancreatic tumor. These metastases showed high cell density and an undifferentiated growth pattern, which we initially considered being undifferentiated carcinoma or a malignant lymphoma. However, portions showed loosely cohesive cells surrounding delicate capillary-sized blood vessels; therefore, we suspected a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN). (Fig. 1C) Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the characteristic immunophenotype of SPNs. The tumor cells were positive for CD10, beta-catenin (in the nuclei), (Fig. 1D) vimentin, and α-1 antitrypsin, but were negative for epithelial markers (CK spectrum AE1/AE3,endomysial antibodies), endocrine markers (Chromogranin A, Synaptophysin), pancreatic enzyme markers (Amylase, Lipase), and Leukocyte common antigen, endocrine markers (chromogranin A and synaptophysin), pancreatic enzyme markers (amylase and lipase), and leukocyte common antigen. We diagnosed the patient with SPN. The proliferative index assessed by Ki-67 immunoreactivity was high (30.5%). The patient received transarterial chemoembolization for the liver tumors and systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin, but the tumor showed rapid progression. The primary tumor enlarged, with hepatic subcapsular perforation; infection developed and hepatic metastases increased. (Fig. 1 E,F) The patient died four months after the initial medical examination. SPN is usually a benign neoplasm and the prognosis is extremely good even if there is local invasion, metastasis, and relapse. Therefore, SPN is considered a low-grade malignancy according to the World Health Organization classification of 2010.1 However, there have been reported cases with malignant histology and poor prognosis2 that were labeled “high-grade malignant transformation” and classified as a subtype of SPN.1 We diagnosed this patient with SPN with high-grade malignant transformation. Because such cases are very rare, more cases should be collected and reviewed in detail.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1. Bosman FT, Carneiro F, Hruban RH (eds).

Suizo. Vol 30, No 2, pp 219–226.\n\nA 72-year-old man who was diagnosed with intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma (IPMC) by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) (Fig. 1 DE) was referred to our hospital for surgery. Abdominal CT demonstrated a well-defined hypovascular tumor in the pancreatic head and main pancreatic duct dilatation from the pancreatic head to the body. (Fig 1AB) MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed moniliform aspect of the pancreatic duct branches in the pancreatic head and partial narrowing of the main pancreatic duct. (Fig. 1C) Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography could not be assessed due to the unsuccessful of cannulation to pancreatic duct.\n\nAfter subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, histological examination showed infiltration and fibrosis of inflammatory cells mainly composed of IgG4-positive plasma cells around the cystic dilated pancreatic ducts. (Fig. 1F) In addition, hyperplasia of pancreatic duct epithelium was observed, leading to pancreatic duct stricture. Since storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis were also detected, type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) was defined; meanwhile, intraductal papillary neoplasm was not concomitant.\n\nRecently, the diagnostic reliability of EUS-FNA inspection has become higher in AIP cases.1,2 However, as described in our case, hyperplastic changes in the pancreatic duct epithelial cells, caused by inflammatory cells infiltration, will sometimes make it difficult to differentiate from atypical cells. Moreover, we speculated that cystic changes in pancreatic parenchyma might be caused by fluid retention in peripheral pancreatic ducts, secondary to pancreatic duct stricture, or by a non-neoplastic disease, which was incidentally concomitant AIP.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind the presence of AIP with main pancreatic dilatation or pancreatic cysts, and aggressive immunostaining of IgG and IgG4 by using a biopsy sample should be considered in order to avoid misdiagnosis.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.

Suizo. Vol 30, No 1, pp 137–143.\n\nWe report a case of resected pancreatic cancer with paraaortic lymph node metastasis after chemotherapy. A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed as having pancreatic head cancer. Although subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD) was planned, paraaortic lymph node metastasis was recognized during surgery. We judged this tumor as Stage IV, and elected chemotherapy instead of radical surgery. Combination chemotherapy with S-1 at a dose of 60 mg/m2 and gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was administered. We performed SSPPD since the primary tumor was stable and a new lesion was not detected after 12 cycles of chemotherapy. Two years and eleven months have passed since the first diagnosis. Although small pulmonary nodules were detected after the surgery and their size increased slightly, she has spent a healthy life. This case suggests that the combination of surgery and chemotherapy pre- and post-surgery can be effective for prolonging survival in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma and paraaortic lymph node metastasis.\n\nA Case of Pancreatic Duct Stone With Difficulty in Selective Pancreatic Cannulation in Which Pancreatic Precut Was Effective for Cannulation\n\nNaohito Uchida, Kei Nomura, Yasuo Furuta, Toshiyuki Kishi. Takinomiya General Hospital Internal Medicine, Kagawa, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 2, pp 227–232.\n\nA 53-year-old woman with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis had abdominal pain due to a pancreatic stone in the main pancreatic duct of the pancreatic head. Since the pancreatic stone was not destroyed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, endoscopic treatment was carried out. Selective pancreatic cannulation was impossible due to the stricture and a bend proximal to the papilla of the pancreatic duct. Therefore, we performed pancreatic precut with a conventional papillotome without a leading tip and the pancreatic duct was successfully accessed. After extension of the pancreatic sphincterotomy, the wire basket was inserted into the pancreatic duct and advanced beyond the stone. However the stone was not trapped by the basket, therefore, the pancreatic stent was inserted. Although mild post-ERCP pancreatitis occurred, the patient recovered with conservative therapy. ERCP was performed 5 days after the precut. The pancreatic stent was withdrawn and the stone was successfully extracted with the basket. Six months after this treatment, the patient has been asymptomatic. There are very few manuscripts about techniques detailing gain of access to the pancreatic duct. Pancreatic precut may be helpful in cases with difficulty in selective pancreatic cannulation.\n\nA Case of Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Pancreas\n\nKenjiro Takahashi,* Toru Hisaka,* Hiroyuki Horiuchi,* Hiroto Ishikawa,* Hiroaki Hirakawa,* Gouichi Nakayama,* Masanori Akashi,* Masamichi Nakayama,† Koji Okuda,* Yoshito Akagi.* Departments of *Surgery and †Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 2, pp 243–249.\n\nA 67-year old male patient was admitted to the hospital with the symptoms of left upper quadrant abdominal pain. Dynamic computed tomography (CT) detected a hypervascular lesion of 4.25 cm in the pancreatic tail. The tumor was suspected to have invaded the splenic vein and left Gerota fascia. With a diagnosis of a pancreatic malignant tumor, we performed distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy and left Gerota fascia and left adrenal gland and D2 lymph node resection. The neoplasm consisted of epidermoid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nThe tumor was diagnosed as adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas, pT4N1M0 pStage IVa. Four days after the surgery, dynamic CT detected multiple metachronous metastases to the liver (S4, 5). Eleven days after the surgery, the patient received gemzar chemotherapy (1000 mg/body). But, the patient died due to the recurrence.\n\nA Case of Pancreaticoduodenectomy in Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Carcinoma Concomitant With Severe Hypoalbuminemia\n\nHironori Ryota,* Sohei Satoi,* Tomohisa Yamamoto,* Hideyoshi Toyokawa,* Hiroaki Yanagimoto,* Satoshi Hirooka,* SoYamaki,* YoichiMatsui,* Soichiro Takai,*Makoto Takaoka,† Kazuichi Okazaki,† A-Hon Kwon.* Departments of *Surgery and †Internal Medicine 3, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 2, pp 250–257.\n\nWe report a case of pancreaticoduodenectomy for intraductal papillary mucinouscyst carcinoma with severe hypoalbuminemia. A 57-year-old man with a cystic tumor of the pancreas was referred to our hospital. His serum albumin was 1.6 g/dL. A CT and MRI identified a cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas and main pancreatic duct dilation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) were performed, with cytology of pancreatic juice suggesting the presence of an adenocarcinoma. The patient was finally diagnosed with a mixed type intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma.\n\nWe concluded that the patient’s hypoalbuminemia was caused by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with obstruction of the main pancreatic duct. A digestive enzyme agent was therefore administered before surgery, and the patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy after confirming the increased serum albumin level of 2.3 g/dL. The post-operative course of this patient was uneventful and he left the hospital 12 days after the surgery. His serum albumin level before hospital discharge increased to 3.2 g/dL. In this patient, pre-operative hypoalbuminemia seemed to be caused by pancreatic exocrine insufficiency which might be associated with the obstruction of the main pancreatic duct due to the mucin producing IPMC in the pancreatic head.\n\nClinical Features and Outcomes of Acinar Cell Carcinoma of the Pancreas: Analysis of Four Cases\n\nYusuke Nakamura, Hideyuki Yoshitomi, Hiroaki Shimizu, Masayuki Ohtsuka, Atsushi Kato, Katsunori Furukawa, Tsukasa Takayashiki, Satoshi Kuboki, Shigetsugu Takano, Daiki Okamura, Daisuke Suzuki, Nozomu Sakai, Shingo Kagawa, Masaru Miyazaki. Department of General Surgery, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 2, pp 258–264.\n\nAcinar cell carcinoma (ACC) accounts for 0.4% of all pancreatic tumors. We investigated the clinicopathological features of four cases with ACC of the pancreas. The mean patient age was 68.2 years and all were male. ACC was visualized as a well circumscribed mass with heterogeneous enhancement on CT scan. Serum elastase1 and AFP were elevated. Curative resection was performed in three cases, and chemo-radiation therapy in the one case with an unresectable tumor. Postoperatively, liver metastasis occurred in all three surgical cases, and additional resection or chemotherapy was performed for these recurrences. Long-term survival was achieved in one surgical case and the case with an unresectable tumor. Our results suggest that therapeutic strategies including aggressive anti-cancer therapies for recurrent or metastatic ACC should be examined by accumulating such cases.\n\nOperative Indication for Serous Cystic Neoplasm of the Pancreas: The Evaluation of Our 12 Resected Patients\n\nHayato Sasaki,* YoshiakiMurakami,* Kenichiro Uemura,* Yasushi Hashimoto,* Naru Kondo,* Naoya Nakagawa,* Takuya Sakoda,* Kazuhide Urabe,* Tamito Sasaki,† Hiroki Ohge,‡ Taijiro Sueda.* Departments of *Surgery and †Gastroenterology and Metabolism, Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan; ‡Department of Infectious Disease, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 4, pp 585–591.\n\nNonsurgical management is usually recommended for serous cystic neoplasm of pancreas which is an uncommon benign tumor. However, resection is carried out for patients with symptoms or massive tumors. The aim of this study was to determine the operative indication for serous cystic neoplasm based on the clinicopathological characteristics of our 12 resected patients. The mean age was 63 years, and 9 patients were female. Three patients were symptomatic. The tumor was located at head of the pancreas in 5 patients, body in 3 patients, and tail in 4 patients. Mean tumor diameter was 6.9 cm, and tumor growth was found in 6 patients. Stenosis or dilatation of main pancreatic duct was observed in 6 patients. Of the 6 patients, the minimum tumor diameter was 4.0 cm. Patients were pathologically diagnosed as microcystic type in 10 patients and macrocystic type in 2 patients. There was one patient diagnosed with serous cystadenocarcinoma with liver metastasis and invasion of the transvers colon. Based on these results, surgical resection for serous cystic neoplasm is recommended for patients with tumors larger than 4 cm, because these patients have symptoms, and stenosis or dilatation of the main pancreatic duct.\n\nA Case of Pancreatic Ascites Improved by Endoscopic Pancreatic Stenting, During a Course of Mild Acute Pancreatitis\n\nYosuke Kunishi,* Yoshiaki Kawaguchi,† Yuri Iwata,* Masatomo Kanno,* Yoshifumi Ono,* Mao Matsubayashi,* Hitoshi Shibuya,* Shohei Ikemoto,* Satoshi Nakao,* Yuichi Shinmaru,‡ Yuji Fujita,‡ Setsuo Tamai,* Yoshio Kato.* *Department of Gastroenterology, Kanagawa Prefectural Ashigarakami Hospital, Kanahgawa, Japan; †Department of Gastroenterology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanahgawa, Japan; ‡Department of Gastroenterology, Nagatsuta Kosei General Hospital, Kanahgawa, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 4, pp 592–599.\n\nA 64-year old man was admitted for mild acute pancreatitis. His recovery was unremarkable until abdominal pain recurred when oral feeding was initiated. Computed tomography (CT) revealed massive ascites with a high concentration of amylase. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) revealed pancreatic disruption and leakage. Endoscopic pancreatic stenting (EPS) led to improvement in symptoms and laboratory data. We report a rare case of pancreatic ascites presenting as an acute complication in mild acute pancreatitis.\n\nTwo Cases of Mucinous (Non-Cystic) Carcinoma of the Pancreas Without Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm\n\nTakuya Sakoda,* YoshiakiMurakami,* Kenichiro Uemura,* Yasushi Hashimoto,* Naru Kondo,* Naoya Nakagawa,* Hayato Sasaki,* Taijiro Sueda,* Tamito Sasaki,† Masahiro Serikawa,† Yasutaka Ishii,† Koji Arihiro,‡ Noriyuki Shiroma,‡ Daisuke Haratake.‡ Departments of *Surgery and †Gastroenterology and Metabolism, Applied Life Sciences Institute of Biomedical & Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan; ‡Department of Anatomical Pathology, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 4, pp 600–606.\n\nWe report two cases of mucinous (non-cystic) carcinoma of the pancreas. The first case was 73-year-old woman. Computed tomography showed a 45 mm tumor in the pancreas head, and we performed pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was mucinous (non-cystic) carcinoma of the pancreas (T2N0M0 f StageII). The second case was 53-year-old man. Computed tomography showed a 47 mm tumor in the pancreas tail, and we performed distal pancreatectomy. The tumor was diagnosed as mucinous (non-cystic) carcinoma of the pancreas (T2N0M0 f StageII). In the vast majority of cases, mucinous (non-cystic) carcinoma develops from pre-existing intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). However, an IPMN component was not observed in the specimens from both cases. The pathological diagnosis was mucinous (non-cystic) carcinoma, a histological variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. Besides, the differential diagnosis of mucinous (non-cystic) carcinoma was difficult, since the endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration should not be indicated due to its cystic appearance. On the other hand, endoscopic ultrasonography showed characteristic images in both cases. Endoscopic ultrasonography may be useful in the differential diagnostics in patients with mucinous (non-cystic) carcinoma.\n\nA Case of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor-Producing Anaplastic Carcinoma of the Pancreas\n\nMasashi Kudo,* Seiichi Yamagata,* Yuu Shibahara,* Syunichirou Katou,* Hirokazu Momose,* Tomoaki Kinno,* Manato Negishi,* Hisato Higashi,* Manato Negishi,* Kozo Masuda,* Haruhiko Shida,* Masafumi Inoue.† Departments of *Surgery and †Diagnostic Pathology, JCHOTokyo-Shinjuku Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 4, pp 607–613.\n\nWe report the case of a 65-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with high fever and anorexia. On admission, the peripheral leukocyte count and serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were elevated to 27,900/mm3 and 165 pg/ml, respectively. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a pancreatic tail tumor and para-aortic lymph node swelling. We performed an open para-aortic lymph node biopsy, and intraoperative pathological diagnosis revealed no lymph node metastasis. Therefore, we performed distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and partial gastrectomy. After the surgery, the leukocyte count and serum G-CSF decreased, but multiple liver metastases and an intra-abdominal recurrence were detected. We administered chemotherapy with TS-1 followed by gemcitabine, but the patient died on post-operative day 116. The autopsy showed anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas and multiple metastases to the liver, lung, vertebrae, diaphragm, abdominal lymph nodes, and peritoneum. Carcinoma of the pancreas associated with G-CSF production is very rare. Here we present this case along with a review of the literature.\n\nPancreatic Tail Carcinoma With Massive Invasion to the Spleen: No Evident Tumor in the Imagings of the Pancreas\n\nHidenobu Kojima,*†Mioka Kishida,* Daisuke Nagashima,*Masayuki Okuno,* Hiroaki Fuji,* Tomohiko Mori,* Daisuke Itou,* Katsuyoshi Furumoto,* Masafumi Kogire.* *Department of Surgery, Kishiwada City Hospital, Osaka, Japan; †Currently: Department of Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 4, pp 614–619.\n\nWe report a case of pancreatic tail carcinoma, which was not evident in the preoperative imaging of the pancreas, with massive invasion to the spleen. A 67-year-old woman complaining of left hypochondriac pain was found to have a splenic tumor in the imaging studies and was referred to our hospital. Preoperative imaging, including abdominal CT and MRI, revealed no abnormal findings except for a massive splenic tumor. According to the increase of the tumor marker and strong accumulation of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose to the splenic tumor on PET imaging, we suspected a malignant tumor. We resected the tumor for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. A distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed due to the severe adhesion of the splenic tumor and pancreatic tail. In the resected specimen, histopathological findings revealed the presence of well differentiated invasive ductal pancreatic carcinoma with massive invasion to the spleen. The possibility of a pancreatic cancer should be considered as a differential diagnosis of a splenic tumor, even if there is no abnormal finding in contrast enhanced CT and MRI.\n\nLong-Term Survival After Pancreaticoduodenectomy With Splenic Artery Reconstruction for Avoiding Total Pancreatectomy in a Case of Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Head Cancer\n\nYasunari Kawabata,* Noriyoshi Ishikawa,† Ichiro Moriyama,‡ Nobuhiko Fukuba,‡ Yoshitsugu Tajima.* Departments of *Digestive and General Surgery; †Organ Pathology; and ‡Internal Medicine II, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Shimane, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 4, pp 620–625.\n\nA 71-year-old woman with borderline resectable cancer of the head of the pancreas with involvement of the portal vein and splenic artery was referred to our hospital. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated a large tumor in the head of the pancreas involving the duodenum, portal venous system, and splenic artery. ERCP showed an abrupt interruption of the main pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas and subsequent pancreatic juice cytology demonstrated adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with splenic artery reconstruction to avoid performing a total pancreatectomy, which resulted in the R0 resection. Histologically, the tumor was a well-differentiated invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with invasion to the portal vein, as well as the duodenum. The patient received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and has been cancer-free for 91 months after surgery with favorable nutrition and quality of life. Our case suggests that a curative pancreatectomy with preservation of the pancreatic functional reserve, as much as possible, may allow the patient to receive an adequate postoperative adjuvant therapy and lead to a favorable outcome in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic head cancer.\n\nA Case of Indeterminate Mucin-Producing Cystic Neoplasm of the Pancreas PresentingWith Acute Rupture\n\nKei Hasegawa,* Koichiro Kubo,* Yoshihiro Morimoto,* Naoshi Minamidate,† Shogo Tokumaru,† Yukitsuna Eshita,† Masaaki Hamada,† Misako Okabayashi,‡ Shosuke Hosaka,‡ Shinichiro Sato,‡ KiyotakaUmeki,‡ Takaaki Saito, §Mitsuhiro Omura,§ Tatsuhiko Takahama.† Departments of *Surgery; †Digestive Surgery; ‡Gastroenterology and §Pathology, Chiba-nishi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 663–670.\n\nA 76-year-old male was transported to the hospital by ambulance for abdominal pain that occurred during exercise at a sports gym. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a round tumor-like lesion in the pancreatic tail. Extravasation and surrounding ascites were observed. Emergency distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The resected specimen was a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas with fibrous membrane, and the cyst was lined by columnar epithelium with atypia. Although similar to mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), no clear ovarian-like stroma was observed. Three months after surgery, local recurrence developed in the transverse mesocolon and thus, repeat resection was performed. The specimen from the repeat resection was also a cystic tumor, and invasion into the transverse mesocolon was observed. Although the tumor contained the ovarian-like stroma observed in MCN, the stromal cells were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors. Consequently, MCN could not be determined and a diagnosis of indeterminate mucin-producing cystic neoplasm of the pancreas was made.\n\nA Case of Pancreatic Head Cancer Found Coincidentally With Pseudocysts\n\nNaohiro Nomura,* Takaya Miwa,* Yumi Tomiie,* Daigo Kobayashi,* Toyohisa Yaguchi,* Naoki Yoshioka,† Keisuke Goto.‡ Departments of *Surgery; †Gastroenterology and ‡Pathology, Aichi Koseiren Kainan Hospital, Aichi, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 671–678.\n\nA 66-year-old man visited our hospital because of left abdominal pain and abdominal distention. Abdominal enhanced CT scan showed pancreatic pseudocysts 2.0 cm and 8.5 cm in diameter adjacent to the pancreatic tail, a dilated pancreatic duct and a small tumor in the pancreatic head. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) showed stenosis of pancreatic duct in the pancreatic head, and FDG-PET revealed mild accumulation in the pancreatic head. Preoperative diagnosis was pancreatic head cancer complicated by pancreatic pseudocysts, and subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed after the percutaneous drainage of the pseudocyst. It is necessary to consider the possibility of the presence of pancreatic cancer whenever a pancreatic pseudocyst is observed.\n\nPancreatic Cancer With Infectious Pancreatic Pseudocyst Communicating to the Portal Vein\n\nKimitoshi Kubo,* Hiroshi Kawakami,* Masaki Kuwatani,† TomokoMitsuhashi,‡ Kazumichi Kawakubo,§ Shuhei Kawahata,* Yoshimasa Kubota,* Naoya Sakamoto.§ *Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; †Division of Endoscopy and ‡Department of Surgical Pathology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Hokkaido, Japan; §Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 679–688.\n\nA 69-year-old female with fever, a pancreatic mass and portal vein thrombosis was referred to our hospital. Blood culture test was positive for Escherichia coli. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT revealed a heterogeneously enhanced oval mass in the head of the pancreas with a size of 16 × 14 mm, and a non-enhanced nodule in the portal vein, which was adjacent to a cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the mass in the head of the pancreas indicated adenocarcinoma. On the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with infectious pseudocyst and portal vein thrombosis, she underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and partial round resection of the portal vein. Histopathological findings of the resected specimen revealed pancreatic head cancer followed by pancreatitis which caused the pancreatic pseudocyst. Infection of the pancreatic pseudocyst would lead to the communication between the cyst and the portal vein. This is the first case with pancreatic cancer with infectious pancreatic pseudocyst communicating to the portal vein.\n\nA Case of Pancreatoblastoma in Which EUS-FNA Aided the Diagnosis\n\nRyo Kanazawa,* Jinkan Sai,* Yuki Fukumura,† Hiroko Miura,* Sumio Watanabe,* Shuichiro Shiina,* Seiji Kawasaki,‡ Shunsuke Kato.§ Departments of *Gastroenterology; †Human Pathology; ‡Hepatobiliary-Pancreatic Surgery and §Medical Oncology, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 689–696.\n\nThe patient was a female in 30s with a complaint of upper abdominal pain. Dynamic CT showed a heterogeneous solid tumor (37 mm in diameter) with calcification in the pancreas head. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a well marginated, high echoic mass, that was hypovascular in the arterial phase and isovascular in the venous phase, delineated by contrast enhanced EUS. The results of both EUS guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and pathology of the resected specimen revealed pancreatoblastoma. EUS-FNA is essential for the diagnosis of this rare pancreatic tumor with high grade malignancy.\n\nA Case of an Enlarging Lymphoepithelial Cyst of the Pancreas After EUS-FNA\n\nYuji Kobayashi, Kiyoaki Ito, Tadahisa Inoue, Norimitsu Ishii, Takaya Yamamoto, Tomohiko Oohashi, Yukiomi Nakade, Ken Sato, Haruhisa Nakao, Masashi Yoneda. Division of Hepatology and Pancreatology, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 697–703.\n\nA 50-year-old woman was seen in our hospital because of a 20 mm multilocular cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail on the abdominal CT. The patient’s serum CA19-9 level was elevated. Diagnostic imaging with CT and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed that the cystic lesion had a thin enhanced wall without a nodular lesion. After one year, a solid region emerged in the pancreatic lesion. This finding suggested that this lesion might be an intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma or pancreatic carcinoma. Therefore, we performed EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for the diagnosis of the pancreatic lesion. Since cytological examination showed that the cystic lesion included keratinous debris without atypical cells, lymphoepithelial cyst (LEC) was decided upon as a one of the differential diagnosis for the pancreatic lesion. Six months after performing EUS-FNA, the lesion increased from 20 mm to 35 mm in diameter. Because of this increase in growth, a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed. Histopathological diagnosis revealed that the pancreatic lesion was the LEC. It also showed leakage of fluid from the lesion. Complications after EUS-FNA of pancreatic cystic lesions are infrequent, but do pose serious problems such as rapture of the cyst and tumor seeding. We have reported a case of pancreatic LEC, which increased in size after performing EUS-FNA.\n\nA Case of Pancreatic Cancer With Components of Invasive Micropapillary Carcinoma\n\nHirohito Naruse,* Norihiko Shimoyama,† Taiki Kudo,* Ikko Tanaka,* Masataka Yagisawa,* Masahiro Horimoto,* Keiko Yamamoto,* Kazuteru Hatanaka,* Yoshiya Yamamoto.* Departments of *Gastroenterology and †Department of Pathology, Hakodate Municipal Hospital, Hokkaido, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 704–711.\n\nA man in his 50s was referred to our department for detailed examination of hepatic dysfunction. Imaging studies showed a tumor lesion and multiple cystic lesions, which were thought to represent dilations of pancreatic duct branches, in the head of the pancreas. The main pancreatic duct was also dilated, containing multiple nodular lesions. Multiple tumors were also present in the liver, and pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastases was suspected. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed duodenal papilla dilation and tumor invasion at the orifice of the duodenal papilla, and biopsy of the lesion revealed components of invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC). IMPC can occur in several organs, including the breast, and is a histological type associated with a high incidence of metastases and poor prognosis. IMPC has seldom been reported in the pancreas, so we report this case herein.\n\nA Case of Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Metastasis From Small Cell Carcinoma of the Lung\n\nYukiyasu Okamura,*Masanori Tokunaga,† Ryo Ashida,* Yusuke Yamamoto,* Takaaki Ito,* Teiichi Sugiura,* Katsuhiko Uesaka.* Divisions of *Hepato- Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery and †Gastroenterological Surgery, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 5, pp 712–719.\n\nThe patient was a 56-year-old male who underwent a partial resection of the right lung for localized small cell carcinoma. There was no decrease in the patient’s postoperative tumor marker levels. Computed tomography revealed a tumor at the pancreatic tail. Endoscopic ultrasonography fine needle aspiration biopsy disclosed that it was a pancreatic metastasis from small cell carcinoma of the lung. Although the patient had undergone chemotherapy and radiotherapy for one and a half years, the therapies could not be continued due to adverse events. Because no other metastatic lesions were found by imaging studies, we performed a laparoscopic distal pancreatecomy for the pancreatic metastasis. The patient remains alive without any sign of recurrence one year and ten months after surgery.\n\nA Case of Resected Pancreatic Head Cancer Associated With Hepatomesenteric Type Hepatic Artery Variation and Superior Mesenteric Artery Occlusion\n\nKazuhiko Kitaguchi,* Shinichiro Takahashi,* Tatsushi Kobayashi,† Hidetoshi Aizawa,* Masashi Kudo,* Satoshi Okubo,* Daigoro Takahashi,* Yusuke Nakayama,* Yasunori Nishida,* Yuichiro Kato,* Naoto Gotohda,* Masaru Konishi.* Divisions of *Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery; and †Diagnostic Radiology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Chiba, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 6, pp 796–804.\n\nThe patient was a male in his 60s who was referred to our hospital for further evaluation after dilatation of the main pancreatic duct and a high value of CA19-9. ERP revealed that the main pancreatic duct was disrupted in the pancreatic head, and the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma by exfoliative cytology. The observation of vascular anatomy by abdominal CT showed hepatomesenteric type hepatic artery variation and occlusion at the root of the superior mesenteric artery. After further evaluation by angiography and 3D image analysis, we performed pancreaticoduodenectomy. By conserving collateral blood circulation as much as possible to secure vascular flow of the superior mesenteric artery and the hepatic perfusion, surgical resection was safely performed without reconstruction of the hepatic and mesenteric arteries.\n\nThere are some reports on cases of resected pancreatic head tumors with stenosis or obstruction of the superior mesenteric artery. In the present case, however, hepatomesenteric type hepatic artery variation was involved. We found it essential to fully comprehend the hemodynamic status in order to ensure hepatic perfusion at the time of resection, and to maintain careful surgical maneuvers.\n\nTwo Cases of Pancreatic Acinar Cell Carcinoma Diagnosed by Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration\n\nMaki Kanzawa,*∥ Naokazu Miyamoto,† Hidehiro Sawa,‡ Daisuke Kuroda,‡ Tsuyoshi Sanuki,§ Yoh Zen.∥ Departments of *Diagnostic Pathology; †Radiology; ‡ Surgery and §Gastroenterology, Kitaharima Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan; ∥Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan. Suizo. Vol 30, No 6, pp 805–811.\n\nAcinar cell carcinoma (ACC) of the pancreas is a rare tumor, accounting for 1% to 2% of primary pancreatic neoplasms. Because of its rarity and some histologic similarities to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), it is generally difficult to establish the diagnosis based on small tissue samples such as needle biopsy. Herein, we report two cases of ACC, where the diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopic ultrasound–guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsy. Both patients were in their 70s. Tumor sizes were 95 mm and 56 mm, respectively. Both patients were found to have liver metastases at the initial presentation. EUS-FNA biopsy samples consisted of fragmented tumor tissue, where neoplastic cells were arranged in solid and acinar patterns. The cells have round enlarged nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Both cases were at least focally positive for both neuroendocrine (i.e., synaptophysin) and acinar markers (trypsin). BCL10, a recently identified immunohistochemical marker for ACC, appeared to be diffusely positive in the tumors, leading to the diagnosis of ACC. Given that BCL10 is a highly specific and sensitive marker for pancreatic ACCs, immunohistochemistry for this molecule will help us to diagnose this rare neoplasm by small tissue samples such as EUS-FNA biopsy."
