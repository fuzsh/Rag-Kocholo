        "text": "The start of my all-time favourite anime franchise, I consider it a classic in terms of comedy and action.\n\nDespite them being part of the same run of manga, if I had to choose, I would say I prefer this ever so slightly over its successor, Dragon Ball Z. I find the fight scenes are more creative, with more emphasis on martial arts, and the humour (which is far more present here) adds a lot.\n\nSon Goku is such a great lead (I have an entire shelf of action figures dedicated to him... and a bookshelf full of various other characters), with his mixture of strength and naivete, he's a complete joy to watch.\n\nOver 153 episodes we see a gradual transformation from a gag manga to an immortal action/comedy filled with some of the most memorable characters around.\n\nHere's where the Dragon Ball franchise loses its way. With the manga having ended, Toei decides to keep things going on their own.\n\nI would have been fine with this decision, being able to enjoy it as a fun \"what-if\" addition to the series.... the problem is that for every thing that works in the series, there are several that don't. There is zero consistency in characters' strength, memorable villains are reduced to jokes and basically no characters other than Goku and his granddaughter (the tough to like) Pan get a chance to shine.\n\nBut there are things I like about the series, despite how sloppily these aspects were handled. Super Saiyan 4 is a pretty awesome concept and design, and the idea of having the Dragon Balls themselves as the final villains is nothing short of brilliant.\n\nBasically, I don't hate GT. I'm not sure I can say I like it, but I find it watchable.\n\nI adore Trigun. I would actually say Trigun is one of the few anime adaptations I prefer over the manga that inspired it. After a while, the manga went a little crazy, with huge space battles, and heavy science-fiction overload.\n\nWhile science fiction plays a large role in the anime, it is first and foremost a story of a gunslinger with a strong moral compass. It has amazing action sequences and memorable characters, some good, some not-so-good.\n\nAnd basically, you'd be hard pressed to find a more likeable lead than Vash, who plays a completely hilarious goofball at times, but hides a much more serious side."
