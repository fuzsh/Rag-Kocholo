        "text": "Discussion\n\nPrevious clinical studies have suggested that the relationship between fracture risk and PTH levels in patients with CKD patients is unclear.( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) Our study also showed that three CKD‐MBD markers, including serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus, were not associated with fracture incidence in patients undergoing hemodialysis (Table and Fig. ). Although recent advancements in treatment with activated vitamin D, calcium‐sensing receptor agonists, and phosphate binders have contributed to maintaining the circulation levels of the above three CKD markers,( 21 ) the risk of fracture in these patients remains much higher than that in the general population.( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 )\n\nWe focused on the effect of AT‐1RB use on hospitalization due to fractures and bone quality in clinical and basic experiments. This clinical observational study revealed that the administration of AT‐1RB but not calcium channel blockers was associated with a lower fracture incidence among patients undergoing hemodialysis (Fig. ). Compared with that in a previous study,( 19 ) the effect of AT‐1RB seemed to be stronger in patients undergoing hemodialysis than in the general population. In an animal model of experimentally induced kidney injury, intraskeletal protein expression of angiotensin II was significantly increased.( 29 ) If this phenomenon is reproducible in patients with CKD, it may account for the osteoprotective effect of AT‐1RB use noted in our study. Hypovitaminosis D is a possible cause of high AII levels in chronic kidney injury via the activation of renin gene expression and subsequent activation of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system.( 30 ) Elevated AII levels downregulate renal klotho expression through an AT‐1R‐dependent manner.( 31 )\n\nRecent observational studies showed that incidence of hip fractures in patients undergoing hemodialysis is decreasing,( 32 , 33 ) which may be due to the increasing use of AT‐1RB. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of fragility fracture prevention through AT‐1RB use are not known to date. We examined the effect of AT‐1RB use on kidney damage‐induced bone abnormalities separately from their suppressive effect on osteoclastogenesis.\n\nIn animals with experimentally induced kidney injury, although the femoral bone elastic mechanical properties and chemical compositions were shown to be impaired, the administration of olmesartan partially restored these parameters independently of changes in the blood pressure (Table and Fig. ). In contrast, olmesartan did not improve the decrease in bone mass noted in these animals, indicating that the improvement in bone elastic mechanical properties through AT‐1RB use is not associated with changes in the bone mass. Although a previous study suggested that the administration of olmesartan was associated with mild suppression of osteoclastic bone resorption,( 17 ) no significant suppressive effect of olmesartan on bone resorption was demonstrated in our study. We do not fully exclude the possibility that olmesartan suppresses bone resorption from this result, but it was at least not sufficient to reduce bone mass in this experimental setting. In contrast, olmesartan restored the uremia‐induced increase in the pentosidine/amide ratio and apatite disorientation, which could contribute to the partial storage modulus increase without the increase in the bone mass. Similar to that noted in previous studies,( 13 , 14 , 15 ) the inhibition of these two pathological reactions was due to the direct interaction between the bone and olmesartan. The increased number of empty lacunae observed after kidney damage was also improved on olmesartan administration (Fig. ). An increased number of empty lacunae suggests the promotion of osteocyte death. Thus, the inhibition of the AT‐1R with olmesartan partially improved the deterioration of bone elastic mechanical properties without changes in the bone mass in CKD animals.\n\nIn the in vitro study, the exposure to angiotensin II induced DNA fragmentation, which led to increased osteocyte apoptosis (Fig. ). Olmesartan inhibited angiotensin II‐induced osteocytic functional abnormalities (Fig. ). Angiotensin II is one of the strongest local oxidation stress factors.( 34 ) Thus, the intraskeletal oxidation stress induced by angiotensin II is one of the likely causes of osteocyte death noted in rats with kidney injury (Fig. ). Although the mechanism underlying establishment of apatite orientation is not known to date, it is known that the orientation relies on in vivo stress distribution in weight‐bearing bones, while the orientation determinants in non‐weight‐bearing bones have not been identified to date.( 35 ) The skeletal load sensor is the osteocyte network. Therefore, a blockade of the osteocyte network by osteocyte apoptosis would dissolve the association between the direction of in vivo stress and apatite orientation, by which bones accommodate the stress imposed upon them. We consider that this is the pathophysiological mechanism by which apatite orientation in weight‐bearing bones is affected in patients with CKD. We detected a protective effect of olmesartan on this orientation through the inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis. Previous studies have reported that apatite orientation is affected by the increased osteocyte death observed in osteoporosis due to calcium depletion or abnormalities in the osteocyte network arrangement noted in melanoma bone metastasis, which supports the present assumption.( 36 ) The intraskeletal oxidation stress caused by local angiotensin II production may have also contributed toward the accumulation of advanced glycation end products as a non‐physiological type I collagen cross‐link in chronic kidney injury, which is another causative factor for the deterioration in bone material properties.( 37 )\n\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AT‐1RB contributes to the underlying pathogenesis of abnormal bone quality in the setting of CKD, possibly by reducing oxidative stress. However, AT‐1RB use did not lead to a complete recovery of deteriorated bone elastic mechanical properties or of the level of osteocyte apoptosis. We previously demonstrated that uremic toxins that could be absorbed by oral charcoal absorbents restored bone elastic properties.( 14 ) Angiotensin II would, therefore, be one of those uremic toxins that deteriorate bone elastic mechanical property through promoting local oxidation stress (Fig. ). Recently, it was reported that reduction of total bone AGE using the AGE cross‐link breaker failed to improve bone mechanical properties in animals with chronic kidney injury.( 38 ) We assume they failed because AGE accumulation is not the only pathophysiological mechanism underlying deteriorated bone elastic mechanical properties associated with chronic kidney injury, as this study demonstrated.\n\nThere are several limitations of this study. First, a lack of data on bone mass is a limitation of this clinical study. In the animal study, we provided a high‐calcium diet to limit the possible effect of PTH on the study results, while significant secondary hyperparathyroidism was still detected in the nephrectomized groups. A previous study reported that parathyroid function was not a factor affecting bone elastic material properties;( 14 ) our study also showed that olmesartan did not affect PTH levels in nephrectomized rats. Even considering the aforementioned limitations, we believe that the study findings are significant."
