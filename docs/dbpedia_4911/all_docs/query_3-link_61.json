I know they tried to make multiple IPs before the Nintendo deal but it seems to me like they tried everything instead of focusing on one thing, there was no clear style.\n\nILikeFeet\n\nFox Brigade\n\nJul 28, 2022\n\n#1,756\n\nthe hardest part about guessing new Nintendo IP is that they're very gameplay-first, and the game gets designed around that. ARMS was \"stretchy arms fighting game\", Splatoon was \"shooting ink\", Astral Chain was \"not-pokemon on a leash helping you fight\", Xenoblade was \"exploring the bodies of dead gods\". and guessing what kind of concept they go for is practically impossible. the game's theming also follows that. Astral Chain was originally a high fantasy game because Nintendo suggested sci-fi, simply because it was different\n\nStarbreaker\n\nSeven ways to win\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,757\n\nYeah, now those folks are working somewhere where their efforts are actually bring appreciated (by the higher-ups). /half joking\n\nAs a PS fan as well, when Sony gutted their Japan studio I was more than a little mad about that. I am even more mad when I hear rumblings of them looking to buy studios like Square Enix because they had great talent under their noses and purchasing 3rd parties just takes them away from other platform owners.\n\n/Rant over\n\nTentacle-tropes\n\nKremling\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,758\n\nLet NLG make Federation Force 2 that is a reboot sequel of the first game\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,759\n\nWhen I was younger, around the release of Metroid Prime 3, I actually thought a game like Feddy Force would be extremely cool. I was obsessed with this small snippet of GF marines using Phazon:\n\nOf course, it was the monkeypawiest situation ever.\n\nChalphy\n\nBoo\n\nPronouns\n\nHe\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,760\n\nThey should make a new Federation Force, but have Anthony Higgs as the lead character with a new squad of characters.\n\nD\n\nDeleted member 341\n\nGuest\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,761\n\nThey should make a new Federation Force, but have Anthony Higgs as the lead character with a new squad of characters.\n\nAnthony Higgs in the reveal trailer:\n\nvisor opens up \"Kept you waiting huh?\"\n\nTentacle-tropes\n\nKremling\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,762\n\nWhen I was younger, around the release of Metroid Prime 3, I actually thought a game like Feddy Force would be extremely cool. I was obsessed with this small snippet of GF marines using Phazon:\n\nOf course, it was the monkeypawiest situation ever.\n\nI still think it can be cool, complete with bounty hunter multiplayer fps, but they will have to do better in almost every regard.\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,763\n\nMonolith hired the Lead Environment artist from bloodborne\n\nThis is so great that even Unreal profile reposted\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,764\n\nEither way I'd LOVE to see NLG dip their toes into something darker/realistic for once. They're brilliant with cartoony games, but diversity once in a while wouldn't hurt, and Nintendo doesn't exactly have much of those in their portfolio, certainly not in the west these days. What was their last, Eternal Darkness outside of Metroid Prime?\n\nExcite Truck could count. It's a pity we don't have a new more grounded vehicle racer. Cruis'n Blast helps scratch that itch but it's not the same. Monster Games crafted an absolute gem and it's such a shame that Excitebots went balls to the wall instead and likely sold what you would expect (poorly).\n\nI still wish in some universe Project HAMMER/Machinex would've been completed as intended (it began as a \"Dynasty Warriors in the west\" sort of thing IIRC).

They're brilliant with cartoony games, but diversity once in a while wouldn't hurt, and Nintendo doesn't exactly have much of those in their portfolio, certainly not in the west these days. What was their last, Eternal Darkness outside of Metroid Prime?\n\nExcite Truck could count. It's a pity we don't have a new more grounded vehicle racer.

Dunno how close the two are though.\n\nI'd have assumed most would've wound up at Bokeh or genDesign.\n\nIt's also like how NDCube have offices in both Tokyo and Sapporo, where I think Hudson had their offices (again not sure how close they happened to have been), which likely helped those ex-Hudson folks migrate over to NDCube.\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#1,773\n\nimagine if studios never tried anything new outside of their area of expertise.

That is why I’m curious about how a new IP by them would look but I also think that NLG might be ‘forced to’ always work on Nintendo IPs or at least it seems like it\n\nnenned\n\nShriekbat\n\nJul 30, 2022\n\n#1,798\n\nI think Nintendo is crazy to not do anything with Eternal Darkness given how much more successful survival horror/action games have become since the original's release. I think Mercurysteam would do a stellar job. Combine their artistry with Nintendo's (Kensuke Tennabe's) oversight and I think they can have a success on their hands.\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nJul 30, 2022\n\n#1,799\n\nI think Nintendo is crazy to not do anything with Eternal Darkness given how much more successful survival horror/action games have become since the original's release.

There's some BAAAAAD baggage due to the lead writer's... later developments and Dyack being Dyack. It's likely the rare IP that's legit better rebooted with the concepts/ideas but little else than a proper follow-up/remake.\n\nLast edited: Jul 30, 2022"
