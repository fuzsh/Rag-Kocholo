Animals—89 female dogs with malignant mammary gland tumors and 24 female dogs with benign mammary gland tumors. Procedures—Female dogs with malignant (n = 89 dogs) and benign (24) mammary gland tumors were evaluated to determine the prognostic value of the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)A or the progesterone receptor (PR), as determined by use of immunohistochemical methods. Results—In this study, 68 (60.2%) and 88 (77.9%) of the 113 dogs with mammary gland tumors had expression of ERA and PR, respectively. Expression of ERA and PR was detected proportionately more frequently in benign tumors (23/24 [95.8%] and 24/24 [100%], respectively) than in malignant tumors (45/89 [50.6%] and 64/89 [71.9%]). Percentage of tumors with positive results for ERA and PR was significantly higher in tumors < 5 cm in diameter; as clinical stage I, II, or III; and without metastasis to lymph nodes or distant metastasis. However, only PR expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with 1-year survival after surgical removal of the tumor. Moreover, dogs with malignant tumors expressing ERA and PR had a significantly higher survival rate, compared with the rate for dogs with malignant tumors expressing ERA but not PR. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—These findings strongly suggested that expression of PR could be used as a prognostic factor for survival, especially in female dogs with malignant mammary gland tumors with ERA expression.",

        "text": "Many tumor markers have been investigated as prognostic indicators in humans with breast cancer. Among these markers, the ER, PR, and HER-2 have been suggested as useful biomarkers for humans with breast cancer.1 In dogs, both benign and malignant mammary gland tumors express ERs.2,3 However, ERα and ERβ expression were found to be higher in benign tumors than in malignant tumors.4,5 Lack of PRs was associated with a high histologic grade, tumor invasion, lymph node involvement, or metastases.6 Therefore, the reason for failure of ERM treatment in human breast cancer patients with ERs could be attributed to a lack of PRs. Clinical responses after ERM are significantly better in human patients whose tumors express ERs and PRs than in patients whose tumors express ERs but not PRs.7,8 Moreover, lack of expression of PRs has been significantly associated with disease progression, high tumor invasion, tumor recurrence, and death.9,10 It is of interest to investigate whether PRs are an independent prognostic factor in dogs with malignant mammary gland tumors.\n\nBiologically, estrogens and progesterones play major roles in normal development of the mammary glands,11,12 but these hormones have also been implicated in tumor development.13,14 In dogs, OHE performed early in a dog's life significantly reduces the risk of developing mammary gland tumors.13 However, OHE performed in dogs of an advanced age may influence the protective effect against mammary gland tumors or affect survival time after surgical removal of the tumor.13–18 Only a few studies4,6 have been conducted to evaluate the role of hormone receptors in survival of dogs with mammary gland tumors after surgical removal of the tumor.\n\nIn another study19 conducted by our laboratory group, dogs with malignant mammary gland tumors with overexpression of HER-2 generally had a higher survival rate for 2 years after surgical removal of the tumor, compared with the survival rate for dogs with mammary gland tumors with typical expression of HER-2. Because this result differed from findings in human patients with breast cancer, it indicated that additional investigation of possible features of endocrine biomarkers in mammary gland tumors of dogs was needed. The objectives of the study reported here were to evaluate the expressions of ERα and PR in mammary gland tumors of dogs by use of immunohistochemical methods, to investigate the relationship of these hormone receptors and clinicopathologic manifestations, and to analyze the prognostic potential of hormone receptors in dogs with malignant mammary gland tumors.\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nER\n\nEstrogen receptor\n\nERM\n\nEstrogen receptor modulator\n\nHER-2\n\nc-erbB-2 receptor\n\nOHE\n\nOvariohysterectomy\n\nPR\n\nProgesterone receptor\n\nPS\n\nProportion score\n\nTNM\n\nTumor, lymph nodes, and metastasis"
