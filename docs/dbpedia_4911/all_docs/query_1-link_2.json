However, no case of SEA associated with abortion has been reported. Here we report a case of SEA in a 30-year-old woman after dilation and curettage for incomplete abortion. The diagnosis of SEA was done by MRI and pus was drained after the cervical discectomy. Bacteroides fragilis group was cultured from the aspirated pus sample. The patient responded to surgical drainage and antibiotics.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Spinal epidural abscess caused by Bacteroides fragilis group after dilation and curettage for incomplete abortion\n\nAU - Ohyagi, Masaki\n\nAU - Ohkubo, Takuya\n\nAU - Taniyama, Takashi\n\nAU - Tomizawa, Shoji\n\nAU - Okawa, Atsushi\n\nAU - Yokota, Takanori\n\nAU - Mizusawa, Hidehiro\n\nPY - 2012/4\n\nY1 - 2012/4\n\nN2 - Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare infection complicated in patients who have some risk factors such as injection-drug use, diabetes mellitus, and several illnesses.
