        "text": "Famed wrestler Hulk Hogan has recently been in the headlines for getting baptized and speaking about his newfound Christian faith.\n\nListen to them on the latest episode of “Quick Start”:\n\nBut the former WWE star is now making headlines for “playing real-life superheroes” alongside one of his friends. According to entertainment site TMZ, Hogan was in Tampa Sunday night when he witnessed a horrific crash and jumped into action.\n\nThe accident reportedly involved a 17-year-old girl, whom Hogan reportedly rescued.\n\nAfter news of the incident broke, the wrestling icon’s wife, Sky Daily Hogan, shared details of the event on her Facebook page.\n\n“Last night, after we left dinner in Tampa, we saw a car flip in front of us!” she wrote. “I truly admire my husband @hulkhogan and our good buddy @jakerask for springing into action, puncturing the girl’s airbag, and getting her quickly out of the car.”\n\nAccording to Hogan, the victim was “unscathed,” though rattled. In the end, she called the entire ordeal “an absolute miracle.”\n\nThe wrestler also confirmed the story on his Twitter feed, explaining how he was able to pop the airbag without a knife.\n\n“The crazy part about the teenager that flipped her car was that, without a knife to puncture the airbags to get her out, a[n] Indian Rocks Christian ballpoint pen came in really handy,” he wrote on X.\n\nHogan continued, “Thank you, God, all is well.”"
