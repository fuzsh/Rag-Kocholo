        "text": "Every gym has a Hulk Hogan.\n\nHulk, the gym rat, inspires people by their presence in the gym. The gym is full of people with like passions? Everyone in the gym desires to change their body or add strength and stamina. There is a draw to the places where you can have a shared experience.\n\nIs spirituality similar? Yes. We hang together as believers because we inspire one another. Again, when we gather as believers, we call that “church.” Is church religious? Not to the genuine Jesus follower.\n\nAttending church is a shared experience around Jesus with friends and other followers. The gym person sows to his body and reaps the benefit of increased muscle growth and muscle memory. Is spiritual growth different? Not really.\n\nWhen you consistently sow to your spirit, you reap the benefits of spiritual reps, just like the gym rat. Our spirit grows through scripture reps, worship reps, and consistently hanging out with people of like passions.\n\nThe non-religious spiritual Hulk Hogan is also an inspiration to others. A non-religious church experience is also inspiring. The spiritual Hulk Hogan develops muscle memory by loving others, serving others, and worshiping God with their heart, mind, and strength."
