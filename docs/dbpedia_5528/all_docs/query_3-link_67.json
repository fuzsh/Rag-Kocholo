        "text": "Hulk Hogan, a WWE Hall of Famer, has pledged his “total” devotion to Jesus Christ. Hulk Hogan, real name Terry Eugene Bollea, previously blogged about his faith in April, when he shared a message about accepting Christ as his savior when he was 14 years old.\n\nHulk Hogan baptized himself and family members in a video shared to social media on December 20. “The greatest day of my life has been total surrender and dedication to Jesus.” “There are no worries, no hatred, no judgment… only love!” he wrote.\n\nAs David Ng reported in 2021, the wrestler spoke about his relationship to Jesus in an interview.\n\n“Once you’re a Christian, you’ve accepted Christ as your Savior. You’re not gonna perish but you’re gonna have everlasting life. That belief is pretty much the only thing that is real to me,” he said.\n\nHulk Hogan talks about Jesus\n\nMerry Christmas, Mr. Hogan. Merry Christmas to us all.\n\nRelated: Kat Von D Rejects the Darkness; Gets Baptized Into Christian Faith\n\n*****"
