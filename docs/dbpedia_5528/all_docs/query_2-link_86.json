        "text": "A state appeals court has upheld the convictions of a Christian Scientist couple for abusing and murdering their 7-year-old diabetic daughter by withholding medical treatment. William and Christine Hermanson should never have been allowed to argue at trial that constitutional religious freedom exempted them from prosecution, the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled Friday.\n\n\"The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death,\" the appeals court said, quoting a 1944 U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nFormer Sarasota banker William Hermanson, 43, and his wife Christine, 39, were convicted last year of felony child abuse and third-degree murder in the 1986 death of their daughter Amy from untreated diabetes.\n\nIn accordance with their Christian Science beliefs, the Hermansons shunned modern medicine and instead prayed for Amy's recovery.\n\n\"As the jury could and did determine, the Hermansons' acknowledged absolute right to hold their religious beliefs did not permit them to exercise that right at the price of Amy's life,\" the appeals court said in its 32-page decision.\n\n\"I think they covered the whole ballpark with it,\" said Assistant State Attorney Deno Economou, the lead trial prosecutor. \"I'm extremely pleased.\"\n\nDefense attorney Thomas Dart said he would have to study the decision further to determine whether to appeal.\n\nRegardless of further legal proceedings, spokesman Nathan Talbot said the Boston-based church must maintain its efforts to make people understand Christian Scientists' reliance on prayer.\n\nThe Hermansons were given suspended four-year prison sentences, placed on probation for 15 years and ordered to seek medical treatment for their surviving children. They have moved to St. Louis since their convictions and couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nThe cornerstone of the Hermansons' defense was a 1975 Florida law that states parents who withhold medical treatment from children because of religious beliefs \"may not be considered abusive or neglectful for that reason alone.\"\n\nThe appeals court ruled Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan incorrectly considered the law, saying it applies only to the reporting of child abuse cases to the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services."
