        "text": "Retired wrestling star Hulk Hogan is slated to speak Thursday night at the Republican National Convention ahead of President Donald Trump's historic remarks accepting his party's nomination for president after facing an assassination attempt.\n\nHe is just one of several members of the wrestling world expected to speak on the convention's final day, including Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, according to a person familiar with the schedule who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the schedule's official release.\n\nEarlier this week, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds compared Trump's return to the RNC stage after the assassination attempt to \"Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania.\"\n\nThe 1980s wrestling icon has occasionally tossed around political aspirations after he retired from wrestling in 2012, including telling Fox News last month that he'd consider entering politics.\n\nIllinois Republicans gathered for the last breakfast of the convention brimming with excitement and optimism as they look forward to what former President Donald Trump will say to close out the convention on Thursday.\n\nDuring their breakfast, two congressmen called for Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to be replaced.\n\n\"I was on a call yesterday with Speaker Johnson. It's unacceptable what the Secret Service didn't do on Saturday. I've called for the Secret Service Director to step down. I think it's unacceptable,\" Rep. Darin LaHood (R-IL), said.\n\nRepresentative Mike Bost (R-IL) added that it's not only about what happened to Trump, but what failed at that rally.\n\n\"We also need to know in the future that never happens again,\" Bost said.\n\nREAD MORE | Illinois GOP delegates call for Secret Service director to step down after Trump shooting\n\nA court commissioner in Milwaukee has ordered a competency examination for a 21-year-old man accused of carrying a concealed firearm near the Republican National Convention.\n\nProsecutors charged Donnell Tinsley on Tuesday with a misdemeanor count of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. According to a criminal complaint, federal agents stopped Tinsley on Monday as he was walking near the convention's security zone after noticing he was wearing black pants and a ski mask and was carrying what the complaint described as a \"large black tactical backpack.\"\n\nThe agents searched him and found an AK-47-style pistol that can fire rifle rounds in the backpack. Online court records indicate that Tinsley's attorney, public defender Elizabeth Ellsworth-Kasch, raised questions about whether Tinsley was competent to proceed during a court hearing Wednesday.\n\nCourt Commissioner Jeralyn Wendelberger ordered Tinsley to undergo a competency exam with a report due by Aug. 6. Tinsley remains in custody.\n\nEllsworth-Kasch didn't immediately respond to a voicemail or an email seeking comment on the case on Thursday morning.\n\nSpeaking at the Faith and Freedom breakfast Thursday morning, vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance shared his faith journey with the attendees, saying his faith was \"shallow\" when he was a child and evolved into more over time.\n\n\"I was raised, as I mentioned last night, by my mamaw who, despite the fact that she loved the F word, was a woman a very deep Christian faith. And you know, she was in some ways what you might call 'unchurched,'\" Vance said.\n\n\"We went to church maybe once or twice a month, sometimes less, sometimes more. But she read the Bible every single day. She prayed every single day. She loved to watch Billy Graham whenever he was on the TV and that was really my introduction to the Christian faith,\" Vance continued.\n\nWhen Vance went on to higher education, he began calling himself an atheist. However, Vance said he decided to learn more about his Christian faith when he met his wife at Yale Law School, who does not share his faith.\n\n\"But to me, what really brought me back to Christ was finding a wife and falling in love and thinking about my thinking about what was required of me as a husband and as a father,\" Vance said.\n\n\"And the more that I thought about those deeper questions, the more that I thought that there was wisdom in the Christian faith that I had completely discarded and completely ignored but was most relevant to the questions that were presented in my life as a husband and father.\""
