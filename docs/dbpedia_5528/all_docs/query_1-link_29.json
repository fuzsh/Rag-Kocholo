        "text": "Hulk Hogan announced on social media Wednesday that he has been baptized.\n\n“Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life,” the 70-year-old posted to Instagram, along with footage of the baptism. “No worries, no hate, no judgment... only love!”\n\nThe baptism took place in a ceremony in Florida.\n\nHogan’s wife, Sky Daily Hogan, also took part in the baptism. The two married in September. They were engaged in July after about a year of dating following his divorce from second wife Jennifer McDaniel in 2022. Hogan’s daughter Brooke didn’t attend the wedding. She took to social media to explain why she didn’t go to the WWE Hall of Famer’s wedding.\n\n“I accepted Christ as my savior at 14yrs old and the training, prayers and vitamins kept me in the game but now that I am one with God, the main event theme of surrender, service and love makes me the Real Main Event that can slam any giant of any size through the power of my Lord and Savior and so it is, even now brother, AMEN!” Hogan shared on “X,” the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, in April."
