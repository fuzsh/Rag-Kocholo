        "text": "Hogan, one of the most popular entertainers in the U.S. beginning in the 1980s, posted a video of the baptism along with a couple of pictures, each showing him wearing a white shirt with a cross necklace and smiling as he emerged from the water. He then hugged his pastor. Hogan was baptized at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo, Fla., according to Instagram. His wife also was baptized.\n\n“Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life,” Hogan wrote. “No worries, no hate, no judgment… only love!”\n\nSocial media was filled with fans celebrating alongside Hogan. Less than 24 hours after the post, the video of Hogan’s baptism had been viewed 4 million times on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Welcome to the church of Christ, brother,” one person wrote, using Hogan’s famous catchphrase.\n\nHogan, 70, was the most famous pro wrestler in America for several decades, headlining Wrestlemania events and even having his name and likeness in a Saturday morning cartoon, CBS’ Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling. He appeared in movies, too, including Rocky III (1982).\n\nEarlier this year, Hogan appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience, wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with John 3:16 and discussing his new faith. He said he went to church when he was young before straying but got back into his faith in recent years.\n\n“Not to Bible thump you, but … I've got this crazy relationship with God, brother, and I've got this crazy relationship spiritually with who I am and why I'm here,” he told Rogan. “And so all that takes precedence over all the noise. … And at the end of the day, my most important thing is to know what my number one priority is, stay centered, and stay as close to God as I can.”\n\nRELATED PODCAST:\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Twitter/@HulkHogan/12/20/23"
