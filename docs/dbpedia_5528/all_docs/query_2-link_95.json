        "text": "In this episode, Tim discusses updates on The New Evangelicals (TNE) and shares his thoughts on how Christians should approach the Harris-Waltz candidacy. He talks about Project Amplify, a TNE initiative to counter right-wing media narratives, and the growth of the organization. Tim explores the concept of Christian nationalism and emphasizes the importance of advocating for the common good. He encourages Christians to think critically about their political engagement and to prioritize the teachings of Jesus. Tim concludes by expressing hope for Christians to embrace a more inclusive and nuanced approach to politics.\n\nTakeaways\n\nThe New Evangelicals (TNE) is growing and working on initiatives like Project Amplify to counter right-wing media narratives and amplify diverse Christian voices.\n\nChristian nationalism seeks to privilege conservative Christian beliefs and control narratives, while advocating for the common good is not inherently Christian nationalist.\n\nChristians should prioritize the teachings of Jesus and advocate for policies that promote the common good and the flourishing of all people.\n\nPolitical engagement should involve holding politicians accountable and working towards a more equitable society, while recognizing the limitations of politicians and the need for ongoing work.\n\nChristians should approach politics with a posture of invitation, inviting others to think critically and embrace a more inclusive and nuanced approach to political engagement.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Introduction and Updates on TNE\n\n14:33 Understanding Christian Nationalism and the Common Good\n\n15:57 Prioritizing the Teachings of Jesus in Political Engagement\n\n19:43 Holding Politicians Accountable and Working for Equity\n\n26:49 Inviting Others to Embrace a Nuanced Approach to Politics\n\n______________\n\nCome to the LIVE EVENT in Austin, TX | Democracy at Risk\n\nREGISTER TO VOTE\n\nIf you'd like to support our work, you can DONATE here!\n\nGet Tickets to Beer Camp (PROMO: TNEHOBBIT)\n\nFollow Us On Instagram @thenewevangelicalsÂ\n\nSubscribe On YouTube @thenewevangelicals\n\nThe New Evangelicals exists to support those who are tired of how evangelical church has been done before and want to see an authentic faith lived out with Jesus at the center.\n\nWe are committed to building a caring community that emulates the ways of Jesus by reclaiming the evangelical tradition and embracing values that build a better way forward.

Coley, author of the book, Â Ministers of Propaganda, and they discuss the concept of legitimizing narratives that are used to justify social arrangements that benefit white evangelicals.\n\nTakeaways\n\nLegitimizing narratives are stories that justify social arrangements and hierarchies.\n\nWhite evangelicals have used the Bible as a source of legitimizing narratives to justify social arrangements that benefit them.\n\nThe curse of Ham is an example of a legitimizing narrative used to justify race-based chattel slavery and racial segregation.\n\nThe hermeneutics of legitimization is an approach to biblical interpretation that consistently produces readings of the text that justify the reader's preferred social arrangements.\n\nUnderstanding and challenging these narratives is important for promoting justice and equality. Legitimizing narratives are used to justify and perpetuate harmful ideologies.\n\nThe defense of slavery and gender hierarchy are examples of self-defeating narratives that appropriate the very ideals they undermine.\n\nThere is a tension between conservative ideals of family values and fiscal policies.\n\nPropaganda plays a significant role in shaping public opinion and can be used to manipulate and control narratives.\n\nIt is important to critically examine the narratives we encounter and strive for a more just and inclusive approach to interpreting scripture and engaging in politics.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Introduction and Announcement\n\n04:07 Introduction to Scott M.

They express frustration with the outrage over trivial matters and the lack of attention given to more important issues. They also highlight the need for Christians to represent Jesus well and focus on issues that truly matter. In this conversation, Tim and April discuss various topics, including the controversy surrounding the Believer's Summit, the problematic views of Doug Wilson, Trump's appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention, and the implications of Project 2025. They also touch on the absurd interpretations of the Olympic opening ceremony and announce their attendance at Theology Beer Camp.\n\nTakeaways\n\nThe outrage over trivial matters distracts from more important issues that require attention.\n\nThe focus on cultural controversies often stems from a weak and narcissistic form of evangelicalism.\n\nJesus does not need defending; he needs people to represent him well.\n\nThe interpretation of Trump's remarks at the Believers Summit can vary, but it is concerning to hear him suggest that Christians won't have to vote again.\n\nThe outrage over the Olympic opening ceremony reflects a fear and discomfort with people living as their authentic selves.\n\nThere is a need to prioritize issues such as genocide, poverty, hate, and greed over trivial controversies. The Believer's Summit sparked controversy due to the presence of controversial figures like Doug Wilson, whose views on sex and slavery are highly problematic.\n\nTrump's appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention was met with criticism, as he evaded direct questions and made insensitive remarks.\n\nProject 2025, a conservative playbook, continues to be a cause for concern, despite the director stepping down amid backlash from Trump.\n\nTim and April will be attending Theology Beer Camp, an event that brings together theologians, podcasters, and individuals seeking a better way forward in their faith.\n\nChapters\n\n03:06 Traveling and the Ark Encounter\n\n09:07 The Olympic Controversy\n\n14:21 The Weakness of Evangelicalism\n\n17:39 Interpreting Trump's Remarks\n\n24:17 The Power of Words and Prioritizing Issues\n\n40:02 Controversy Surrounding the Believer's Summit\n\n41:25 Problematic Views of Doug Wilson\n\n48:38 Trump's Appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention\n\n52:53 Implications of Project 2025\n\n01:14:25 Absurd Interpretations of the Olympic Opening Ceremony\n\n01:18:13 Announcement: Attendance at Theology Beer Camp\n\n______________\n\nREGISTER TO VOTE\n\nIf you'd like to support our work, you can DONATE here!\n\nGet Tickets to Beer Camp (PROMO: TNEHOBBIT)\n\nFollow Us On Instagram @thenewevangelicalsÂ\n\nSubscribe On YouTube @thenewevangelicals\n\nThe New Evangelicals exists to support those who are tired of how evangelical church has been done before and want to see an authentic faith lived out with Jesus at the center.\n\nWe are committed to building a caring community that emulates the ways of Jesus by reclaiming the evangelical tradition and embracing values that build a better way forward.
