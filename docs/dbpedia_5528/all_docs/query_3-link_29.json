        "text": "Throughout his public life, Hulk Hogan has been many things, including a wrestling star, movie star, WWE Hall of Famer, and for a brief period in the 2010s, pariah. Now as Hogan enters his 70s, he's turning more towards something he always preached about to his Hulkamaniacs; religion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Instagram Wednesday, Hogan posted a video of himself being baptized in what appeared to be a hot tub, as well as another video of him helping a woman get baptized as well. Hogan included a message with the videos, declaring the day to be \"the greatest day of my life,\" and that he would now be surrendering and dedicating his life to Jesus Christ. He closed by saying \"No worries, no hate, no judgment...only love.\"\n\n2023 has been quite the year for Hogan in regards to religion, as the former nWo leader had previously been linked to Scientology earlier in the year after being spotted hanging out with Tom Cruise. It's unclear what ultimately led Hogan away from Scientology and back towards Christianity, though some thought Hogan's flirtation with Scientology may have been the result of members trying to pressure Hogan to join the group.\n\nAdvertisement"
