        "text": "Hulk Hogan comments on potential matches he'd want to have.\n\nWWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan was a top star for years, and he competed in countless memorable matches. Hogan hasn't wrestled since 2012, and the business has changed a lot since then, as names like Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes have led WWE to where it is today.\n\nSpeaking with Bill Apter for Sportskeeda WrestleBinge, Hulk Hogan was asked to name which top stars he would want to face in a potential match.\n\nâ€œIf I really could jump in the ring with somebody today, if Roman Reigns was a babyface, I think Hollywood Hogan [inaudible], I would love to work with Roman. My other two guys would be Seth [Rollins] and CM Punk. I think we could do some crazy business,\" Hogan said.\n\nIn a previous interview, Hogan said that one more match for him was out of the picture. Click here to see what he had to say.\n\nHogan previously said that Reigns was working on a different level. Check out his comments here.\n\nIn a recent interview, Hogan said that Rollins was as solid as they get. Click here to see what he had to say."
