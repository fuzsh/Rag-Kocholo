        "text": "Professional wrestler and WWE Hall of Fame member Hulk Hogan recently underwent a baptism to dedicate his life to Jesus.\n\nHogan, also known as the Hulkster to his Hulkamanic fans, partook in a special ceremony at the Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Florida. Wearing all white, the 70-year-old WWE legend was submerged in water with a cross pendant and necklace around his neck.\n\nAfter being baptizedd, Hogan spoke about his decision to go through the process, which he shared with his new wife, Sky Daily Hogan. He said the decision was a \"Total surrender and dedication to Jesus\" and was the \"greatest day of his life.\"\n\n\"I accepted Christ as my savior at 14yrs old,\" he said back in April, \"and the training, prayers, and vitamins kept me in the game, but now that I am one with God, the central event theme of surrender, service, and love makes me the Real Main Event that can slam any giant of any size through the power of my Lord and Savior, and so it is, even now brother, AMEN!\"\n\nDon't miss...\n\nBubba Wallace outlines goals for 2024 NASCAR season after big jump [LATEST]\n\nTaylor Swift and NFL wives in agreement after Brittany Mahomes' role emerges [LATEST]\n\nAnthony Joshua refuses to bite as heated rival insults him to his face [LATEST]\n\nHogan, an undisputed icon in professional wrestling, has amassed a unique array of accolades throughout his wrestling career. His ability to stage comebacks from significant injuries earned him the PWI Comeback of the Year honors in 1994 and 2002.\n\nHogan's intense 1986 feud with Paul Orndorff was recognized as the Feud of the Year, and his inspirational presence also garnered him the title of Inspirational Wrestler of the Year in 1983 and 1999. In 1985, Hogan's partnership with Mr. T in a match against Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff at WrestleMania I was deemed the Match of the Year—a defining moment in wrestling history.\n\nHogan continued to deliver memorable performances, securing additional Match of the Year awards in 1988, 1990, and 2002. His larger-than-life persona led to dual recognition as the Most Hated Wrestler of the Year in 1996 and 1998 and the Most Popular Wrestler of the Year in 1985, 1989, and 1990. Wrestler of the Year titles in 1987, 1991, and 1994 further solidified his dominance in the wrestling world.\n\nHis achievements reached a pinnacle in 1991 when he was ranked No. 1 among the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500. In 2003, he claimed the top spot in the PWI Years rankings. Hogan's versatility was evident as he secured rankings in the top 100 tag teams alongside Antonio Inoki and Randy Savage.\n\nHis tenure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) saw Hogan claim the WCW World Heavyweight Championship six times, establishing himself as a central figure in the promotion's history. Transitioning to the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/WWE), Hogan's impact remained unparalleled, with six WWF/WWE Championship reigns, a WWE Tag Team Championship with Edge, and victories in the Royal Rumble in 1990 and 1991.\n\nAt the same time, his transition to WWF/WWE saw him clinch six WWF/WWE Championships, a WWE Tag Team Championship with Edge, and Royal Rumble victories in 1990 and 1991. Hogan's legendary status was immortalized in the WWE Hall of Fame, where he was inducted twice—first as an individual in the Class of 2005 and later as a member of the New World Order in the Class of 2020.\n\nDuring his speech, he dedicated his time to the numerous rivals he had encountered throughout his career, both inside and outside the ring. He even went to the extent of inviting them up on stage to embrace them. Hogan's standing ovation that night is still considered one of the most significant ovations in sports history."
