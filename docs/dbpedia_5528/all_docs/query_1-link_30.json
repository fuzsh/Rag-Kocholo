        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nWrestling icon Hulk Hogan and his wife Sky were recently baptized.\n\n“Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life,” he wrote under a video of the couple being baptized. “No worries, no hate, no judgment…only love!”\n\nHogan has spoken about his faith before.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the wrestler wrote, “I accepted Christ as my savior at 14yrs old, and the training, prayers and vitamins kept me in the game but now that I am one with God, the main event theme of surrender, service and love makes me the Real Main Event that can slam any giant of any size through the power of my Lord and Savior and so it is, even now brothe, AMEN!”\n\nIn a 2009 interview with TMZ, Hogan shared how his faith kept him grounded amid his divorce from wife, Linda Hogan.\n\n“I’ve leaned on my religion,” Hogan told the outlet, per the Daily Mail. “I accepted Christ as my savior. He died on the cross and paid for my sins. I found some very good friends who told me about being positive and the power of positive thinking.”\n\nHe concluded, “I could have went the wrong way. I could have self-destructed, but I took the high road.”\n\nHogan also shared a message of faith during the COVID-19 pandemic. He wrote on Instagram:\n\n“In three short months, just like He did with the plagues of Egypt, God has taken away everything we worship,” he wrote on Instagram. “God said, ‘you want to worship athletes, I will shut down the stadiums. You want to worship musicians, I will shut down Civic Centers. You want to worship actors, I will shut down theaters. You want to worship money, I will shut down the economy and collapse the stock market. You don’t want to go to church and worship Me, I will make it where you can’t go to church’\n\n‘If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.’\n\nMaybe we don’t need a vaccine, Maybe we need to take this time of isolation from the distractions of the world and have a personal revival where we focus on the ONLY thing in the world that really matters. Jesus.”"
