        "text": "Share via:\n\nFamed wrestler Hulk Hogan is opening up about his walk with Jesus Christ since publicly announcing his baptism last December. In a recent interview, the 70-year-old invited his followers to turn to Jesus saying, “Knowing of Jesus and knowing Him are two different things.”\n\nHogan is one of the most recognizable faces in the entertainment industry, but he told TBN in an interview that attaining fame and fortune did not fulfill him.\n\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today!

I thought I could make the decisions better than He could. And now He takes His hands off the wheel and says, ‘Okay. You think you can do it better, go ahead and do it.’ So, like I said, I got tired of crashing and burning, and at this point, with a 40-year career behind me, in that whole platform, I understand now that it was just a temporary situation to set me up for this next run.”\n\nHe added, “And now that that run is over, I’m getting ready to this new run. Now I realize why I’m here and why all that happened.”\n\nAs CBN News reported, Hogan and his wife, Sky Daily Hogan, were recently baptized at the Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Florida.\n\nBreaking News.
