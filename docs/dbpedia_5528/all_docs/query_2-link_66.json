These trends manifest themselves in myriad ways, both in politics and in everyday life. [1]\n\nIn this episode of the Theology for the People podcast, I speak with Drs. Matthew Kim and Paul Hoffman, the authors of Preaching to a Divided Nation: A Seven-Step Model for Promoting Reconciliation and Unity.\n\nDrs. Kim and Hoffman met at Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary. Dr. Hoffman is lead pastor of Evangelical Friends Church of Newport, Rhode Island, and Dr. Kim is Professor of Practical Theology and the Hubert H. and Gladys S. Raborn Chair of Pastoral Leadership at Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University.\n\nThey are passionate about the Bible’s vision of the reconciliation of all things in Christ, and they care deeply about the Body of Christ and the Mission of God — and they share how this theology can play out practically in the way that we minister in a world which is plagued by division.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about when and how Christians should address hot topics in our societies, and some guiding principles for helping people navigate the cultural moments we find ourselves in.\n\nMentioned in this episode is Dr. Kim’s book, Preaching with Cultural Intelligence: Understanding the People Who Hear Our Sermons\n\nClick here to listen to the episode.\n\nCarrying Out the Mission of God in a Divided Nation – with Drs.

It forms our imaginations and—given time—transforms us. Dan explains how what you pray shapes what you believe, which in turn shapes how you live.\n\nWhat was Jesus’ intention in giving us this prayer? Was it to give us a model of how to pray, or was it intended to be given to us as what to pray? Dan and I discuss the historical usage of the Lord’s Prayer, as well as the value and dangers of both praying written prayers and praying extemporaneously.\n\nDan is a graduate of Denver Seminary, and we discuss some of the cultural uniquenesses of different parts of the United States, and how those affect the way we minister to others.\n\nClick here to listen to the episode, or listen in the embedded player below.\n\nThe Subversive Power of the Lord's Prayer – Theology for the People\n\nDan Marotta is the founding Rector of Redeemer Anglican Church in Richmond, Virginia, and the author of Liturgy in the Wilderness: How the Lord's Prayer Shapes the Imagination of the Church in a Secular Age.

(Origins in Hinduism)\n\nHow about martial arts?\n\nWhat about Christmas? (December 25 was originally a pagan solstice festival which Christians “took over,” detached it from its pagan origins, and infused it with new meaning and made it all about Jesus)\n\nWhat about psychology?\n\nHow about certain instruments, like drums?\n\nWhat about rock music and electric guitars?\n\nThis discussion of how Christians should relate to ideas and practices which originate outside of Christianity can be traced all the way back to a historical argument between Tertullian and Justin Martyr, early Christian apologists and theologians, and can be summarized by Tertullian’s classic question: “What Has Athens to Do with Jerusalem?”\n\nIn this episode, Michael and I discuss the relevant principles from the Bible we should follow as guides in navigating these matters.\n\nHow does the redemptive narrative arc of Scripture affect how we relate to these practices? How about what Paul says about meat sacrificed to idols in 1 Corinthians 8-10 and Romans 14?\n\nCheck out our discussion in the embedded player below, or by clicking here: What Has Athens to Do with Jerusalem?: How Should Christians Relate to Ideas and Practices Which Originate Outside of Christianity?\n\nWhat Has Athens to Do with Jerusalem?: How Should Christians Relate to Ideas and Practices Which Originate Outside of Christianity? – Theology for the People\n\nIn this episode Nick Cady and Michael Payne speak about how Christians should relate to things which originate outside of Christianity, such as yoga, psychology, Christmas, drums, or rock music.

Here are a few of my favorites (other than the Bible), in no particular order:\n\nA Clear and Present Word: The Clarity of Scripture, Mark Thompson\n\nI read this book as part of my research for my Masters dissertation, which was on the topic of the perspicuity (clarity) of Scripture, and whether belief in this concept was novel to the Reformation period, or if it had precedent in the patristic period as well.\n\n2. The Bible in America: Essays in Cultural History, Nathan Hatch\n\nGreat short essays about the history of thinking about the Bible in America, particularly in regard to radical individualism and the rejection of tradition and the church in the interpretive process. Sadly, it is out of print, but used copies are available to order.\n\n3. On Christian Doctrine, Augustine of Hippo\n\nA true classic, written between 397 and 426 AD. The main topic of this book is about how to interpret and teach the Bible.\n\n4. Fire Road: The Napalm Girl’s Journey through the Horrors of War to Faith, Forgiveness, and Peace, Kim Phuc Phan Thi\n\nThe autobiography of the woman from the famous photo of a girl burning in napalm in Vietnam, and how she became a Christian.\n\n5. The Burning Edge: Travels Through Irradiated Belarus, Arthur Chichester\n\nAn engaging travel log through the area hit by the fallout of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster by one of my favorite YouTubers.\n\n6. On the Road with Saint Augustine: A Real-World Spirituality for Restless Hearts, James K.A. Smith\n\nTheologian James K.A. Smith gives a biography of Saint Augustine while retracing his steps from North Africa to Italy and back.\n\n7. Understanding Gender Dysphoria: Navigating Transgender Issues in a Changing Culture, Mark Yarhouse\n\nMark Yarhouse teaches at Wheaton College, an evangelical divinity school in Illinois. This book gives and important framework for understanding the issues related to gender dysphoria from a Christian perspective, including much of the research that has been done on the topic, and advice for parents and those who seek to minister to people and families.\n\n8. Taking God At His Word: Why the Bible Is Knowable, Necessary, and Enough, and What That Means for You and Me, Kevin DeYoung\n\nAn accessible study of what the Bible teaches about the Bible.\n\n9. How to (Not) Be Secular: Reading Charles Taylor, James K.A. Smith\n\nThis is a thinking person’s book about culture in our postmodern age. Smith uses terms like “epistemic pelagianism” to describe the idea that people can figure out everything on their own without the help of God. He discusses Charles Taylor’s idea of the “imminent frame,” i.e. the present world, and its shortcomings. So many important thoughts in this book, although it’s not the easiest read.\n\nSee also: What is Epistemic Pelagianism?\n\n10. Légy Jó Mindhalálig, Móricz Zsigmond\n\nA few years ago I decided to read the required reading for Hungarian secondary students. This is a classic novel about a student in Debrecen, Hungary, a city where I lived for over 3 years.\n\nCancel Culture, Sarah Silverman, and the Hope of Redemption\n\nYears ago I was telling my dad about the moral failure of a high profile Christian leader which had disqualified him from ministry. I concluded the story by saying something to the effect of: “Well, I guess he showed his true colors.”\n\nMy dad’s response was: “What if that’s not who he is at the core, but a mistake that he made?”\n\nThere I was, judging this man based on one of his worst moments, and saying: “That is who he IS!” My dad was willing to say that while what this man did was wrong, he should be given the opportunity for redemption rather than being forever dismissed and defined by his worst moment.\n\nThis isn’t to say that people are not sinners or that sinful actions are justifiable, or can just be chalked up as an “oops” that doesn’t count against us. No.\n\nAnd yet: What do we do with sinners? Do we write them off and condemn them, standing upon their fallen frames in order to make ourselves appear that much taller? Or do we believe that redemption is possible and desire to see it take place?\n\nI don’t pay much attention to Sarah Silverman, but I stumbled upon this clip of her talking about cancel culture and how it labels people as irredeemable. She makes a great point: Don’t we want to see people change? If so, we should encourage and celebrate transformation rather than self-righteously writing off people forever who have made mistakes.\n\nThis is what made Jesus so incredible: he showed love to those whom his society considered irredeemable: prostitutes, tax collectors, sinners. Far from affirming their sins, he offered them redemption, a new identity, and a new destiny.\n\nHere is the clip from Sarah Silverman:\n\nSarah is not a Christian, but she is touching on something that is core to Christianity.\n\nMay we as the church be those who champion redemption, who provide a place where people are loved and are shown that they are not irredeemable because of Jesus!\n\nIn him, fallen people like us have had our sins dealt with before God, and therefore we can receive forgiveness, redemption, a new identity, and a new destiny. That’s good news.\n\nWhere Does Our Sense of Morality Come From?\n\nIs morality something that people intuitively know, or is it something we need to be told or instructed about?\n\nWhy is it that what is considered moral changes over time in different societies?\n\nPastor Mike and I discuss these questions in this week’s Sermon Extra video, in which we look at 1 Timothy 1:8-9: “Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners”\n\nThe book we reference about people who considered murder and lying to not be wrong and treachery to be a virtue is Peace Child by Don Richardson, which I highly recommend.\n\nWe also discuss the question of how much of a Christian’s self-understanding should be determined by the recognition of their sinfulness versus their having been redeemed by Jesus.\n\nHulk Hogan, Idols, and the Name of God\n\nRecently Hulk Hogan posted this on Facebook, which garnered a lot of attention, and a reader asked me to comment on it.\n\nIn three short months, just like He did with the plagues of Egypt, God has taken away everything we worship. God said, “you want to worship athletes, I will shut down the stadiums. You want to worship musicians, I will shut down Civic Centers. You want to worship actors, I will shut down theaters. You want to worship money, I will shut down the economy and collapse the stock market. You don’t want to go to church and worship Me, I will make it where you can’t go to church”\n\n“If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”\n\nMaybe we don’t need a vaccine, Maybe we need to take this time of isolation from the distractions of the world and have a personal revival where we focus on the ONLY thing in the world that really matters. Jesus.\n\nMatters of the Soul and the Body\n\nI agree with Hulk’s statement that we should take this time of isolation from the distractions of the world and have a personal revival.\n\nI agree with his call to repentance, prayer, and seeking the Lord from 2 Chronicles 7:14.\n\nI don’t see why this repentance and revival would exclude the need for a vaccine however, but just as Jesus said: “What does it benefit a person if they gain the whole world but lose their soul?”, (Mark 8:36) that question could easily be applied to our current situation: “What does it benefit a person if they survive the COVID-19 crisis but lose their soul?”\n\nPersonally, I have seen a significantly greater openness to the gospel and to prayer in many people during this crisis, and I praise God for that. I believe that God is more concerned with the well-being of our souls than with our physical comfort. At the same time, it is also the call of the people of God to relieve suffering when possible (see Matthew 25:31-46), as we look forward to the end of sickness and death forever for those in Christ because of what He accomplished in his life, death, and resurrection.\n\nThe Human Heart is an Idol Factory\n\nHulk claims that “in three short months, just like He did with the plagues of Egypt, God has taken away everything we worship.”\n\nThe thing is, just taking away people’s money doesn’t make them stop worshiping money. Oftentimes it is not what we have that we worship, but what we want – that’s what it means to covet.\n\nOne of the things I learned working with refugees and the impoverished Roma population in Hungary, is that some of the people who worship money the most are those who don’t have any of it. They seek after it, believing that if they had it, they would be content and fulfilled. Some of the most materialistic people I have known are people who lacked materially. On the contrary, I have known many wealthy people who were incredibly generous – having learned firsthand that money and possessions will never fill the God-shaped void in one’s soul.\n\nMartin Luther stated that “the human heart is an idol factory.” In other words, even if God did take away these idols, (which are all clearly still here, with the exception of sports) the underlying problem would still exist, and we would just make and find new idols to worship with our time, energy, resources, and attention.\n\nWhat we need is something deeper: regeneration, new birth, a transformation from the inside out, which is the work of God in our lives.\n\nThe Name of God\n\nI find it absurd that Hulk uses the name of God as his personal motto: “I am that I am.”\n\nThe name Yahweh derives from the Hebrew word for “to be” – which is why God told Moses to tell Pharaoh that “I am who I am” if Pharaoh asked the name of the God who had sent Moses.\n\nTo use this name as a personal motto is borderline, or perhaps blatant blasphemy, in my opinion.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhile it is a bit ironic that Hulk Hogan, a celebrity, is calling out the cultural idol of celebrity worship, and his point about God taking away our idols is dubious at best (if God shut down stadiums to stop our worship of athletes, how does he then reason that the shutting of churches is to be understood as punishment for people not going to church???), his core point is a good one: rather than just waiting for this to be over, we should take this time to refocus on our relationship with God and repent where necessary of giving other things the place in our hearts which rightly belongs to Him."
