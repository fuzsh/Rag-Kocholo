        "text": "Welcome to the latest edition of \"What Is The Best WWE Match Of The 21st Century?\"\n\nFinally, we are only two rounds away from finding out once and for all which is the greatest match of the 21st century.\n\nThere are only six matches left in the semi finals, with three brackets of two matches. The grand final will be a triple threat match.\n\nOne thing is for sure. Wrestlemania really is the grandaddy of 'em all, with five of the six matches left being from Wrestlemania.\n\nThe results from the quarter finals are as follows:\n\nBenoit vs. Angle - 8\n\nHBK vs. Benjamin - 2\n\nRock vs. Hulk Hogan - 16 (Winner)\n\nAustin vs. Rock - 8\n\nHBK vs. Undertaker - 19 (Winner)\n\nHBK vs. Angle - 12\n\nTLC 2 - 14 (Winner)\n\nHBK vs. Jericho - 4\n\nTLC 1 - 22 (Winner)\n\nTriangle Ladder Match - 6\n\nTriple H vs. HBK vs. Benoit - 20 (Winner)\n\nHBK vs. Flair - 20 (Winner)\n\nBenoit vs. Jericho - 4\n\nHardy vs. RVD - 2\n\nLet the semi finals begin!\n\nPlease watch the videos and vote carefully. Most importantly, have fun!\n\nFirst Bracket:\n\nThe Hardyz vs. The Dudleyz vs. Edge & Christian (TLC 2, Wrestlemania X-7) - This match built on the first TLC match to such a point that the participants didn't think it was possible to push the bar any higher.\n\nJeff Hardy hung from the title belts and got speared by Edge from the top of a ladder. Matt Hardy and Bubba Ray were taken out at the end of the match after crashing through four stacked tables. Edge & Christian retained their titles after an excellent match.\n\nVS.\n\nTriple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit (Wrestlemania XX) - There was a lot of back-and-forth action in this match. Triple H and Shawn Michaels suplexed Benoit through an announce table, but he recovered to win the match.\n\nSecond Bracket:\n\nThe Hardyz vs. The Dudleyz vs. Edge & Christian (TLC 1, Summerslam 2000) - The original TLC match that can not be described. You've all seen it. You all know how great it was. Edge & Christian retained their title belts in an unbelievable match.\n\nVS.\n\nShawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair (Retirement match, Wrestlemania 24) - This is the match where HBK's famous words \"I'm sorry, I love you\" came from. Michaels won the match after a Sweet Chin Music, and retired his good friend Ric Flair.\n\nThird Bracket:\n\nThe Rock vs. Hulk Hogan (Wrestlemania X8) - Icon vs. Icon. This was the match that everyone world wide had wished would happen, and it delivered. It was an epic encounter with The Rock the winner by the end of it.\n\nVS.\n\nShawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker (Wrestlemania 25) - The best Wrestlemania match ever IMO. They had an absolute classic, and even now they are still recovering. At the end of it all The Undertaker won and kept his streak alive."
