        "text": "(January 6, 2024) Movieguide® Contributor reports good news that Hulk is ‘Living for Christ’…\n\nWrestling legend Hulk Hogan recently shared his baptism online, and many have expressed support for the 70-year-old superstar.\n\n‘Total surrender and dedication to Jesus’\n\nHis video, which received over six million views, shows Hogan and his wife, Sky Daily, as they are submerged in water by their pastor. The baptism ceremony took place at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Florida.\n\n‘Total surrender and decication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life. No worries, no hate, no judgment… only love!’ the wrestler wrote on Instagram.\n\nMany responded positively to Hogan’s decision to follow Christ, and he shared a thanks on X. ‘It’s amazing how many emails and messages I’m getting from around the world now that everyone knows I am one with and am living my life for Christ,’ Hogan posted on December 26. ‘All is well even now, joyful, happy, life is good, thank you God. Amen!’ (Hulk Hogan@HulkHogan)\n\nEncouragement\n\nChurch Leaders noted, ‘Some of those who encouraged Hogan on social media were Greg Laurie, Ann Voskamp, Ed Stetzer, Daniel Darling, Matt Brown, Denny Burk, Ruslan, and Sports Spectrum’s Jason Romano.’\n\nHulk Hogan first opened up about his faith in April. He said, ‘I accepted Christ as my Saviour at 14 years old, and the training, prayers and vitamins kept me in the game but now that I am one with God, the main event theme of surrender, service and love makes me the Real Main Event that can slam any giant of any size through the power of my Lord and Saviour and so it is, even now, Amen!’\n\nHogan isn’t the first star to share his faith publicly in recent days. The Daily Mail reported that other celebrities have also committed their lives to Christ and been baptised – ‘Kat Von D famously renounced witchcraft and the occult and was baptised into Christianity at a ceremony attended by her inked pals this year, while Blac Chyna was reborn as a Christian on her 34th birthday in 2022. Keke Palmer’s ex Darius Jackson – who has been accused of domestic violence towards her – recently revealed he had the chance to “repent and be baptised,”’ the Daily Mail wrote."
