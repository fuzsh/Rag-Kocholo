        "text": "Speaking at the Faith and Freedom breakfast Thursday morning, vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance shared his faith journey with the attendees, saying his faith was \"shallow\" when he was a child and evolved into more over time.\n\n\"I was raised, as I mentioned last night, by my mamaw who, despite the fact that she loved the F word, was a woman a very deep Christian faith. And you know, she was in some ways what you might call 'unchurched,'\" Vance said.\n\n\"We went to church maybe once or twice a month, sometimes less, sometimes more. But she read the Bible every single day. She prayed every single day. She loved to watch Billy Graham whenever he was on the TV and that was really my introduction to the Christian faith,\" Vance continued.\n\nWhen Vance went on to higher education, he began calling himself an atheist. However, Vance said he decided to learn more about his Christian faith when he met his wife at Yale Law School, who does not share his faith.\n\n\"But to me, what really brought me back to Christ was finding a wife and falling in love and thinking about my thinking about what was required of me as a husband and as a father,\" Vance said.\n\n\"And the more that I thought about those deeper questions, the more that I thought that there was wisdom in the Christian faith that I had completely discarded and completely ignored but was most relevant to the questions that were presented in my life as a husband and father.\"\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson is a Democrat, but he pushed hard for his city to host the Republican National Convention.\n\n\"I am a Democrat, like I said, I am going to the DNC next month and I am proudly going to cast my ballot to support President Joe Biden and his re-election,\" Mayor Johnson said. \"That's on the political end. On the business end, I am looking at this as an opportunity to elevate Milwaukee, to bring economic development, to bring economic impact here.\"\n\nThe Republican National Convention is estimated to bring in $200 million in revenue for Milwaukee.\n\nNext month, the Milwaukee mayor will be coming to Chicago, where he will serve as a delegate at the DNC.\n\nRepublicans throughout the week in Milwaukee have suggested the combative former president take a gentler tone in light of the shooting and have suggested the crisis provides a chance to de-escalate the divisive political rhetoric that has marked the 2024 campaign.\n\nTrump told the Washington Examiner that he had rewritten his acceptance speech in the wake of the Saturday shooting, emphasizing a call for national unity.\n\n\"The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger,\" he said. \"Had this not happened, this would've been one of the most incredible speeches,\" aimed mostly at the policies of President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Honestly, it's going to be a whole different speech now,\" he said.\n\nAny such dialing down by Trump will come before a delegation, many of whom have been moved by Trump's own defiant words in the grasp of U.S. Secret Service agents Saturday, and have sparked their echo in the form of chants of \"fight, fight, fight.\"\n\n\"I do believe that after going through that his message will be better, and I do think he will appeal to our better emotions,\" Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas said. \"He has an enormous compassion and empathy that doesn't always come through.\""
