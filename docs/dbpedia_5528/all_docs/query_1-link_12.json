        "text": "WWE star Hulk Hogan and his wife, Sky Daily Hogan, publicly profess their faith in Jesus by undergoing water baptism.\n\nWWE star Hulk Hogan\n\nHogan and Sky tied the knot in October of the previous year. Beyond their commitment to each other, the couple also demonstrated their dedication to the Lord and Savior by undergoing water baptism at the Indiana Rocks Baptist Church in Florida. Senior Pastor Aaron Filippone orchestrated the ceremony, immersing the retired wrestler first before submerging both Hogan and Sky under the water.\n\nThe 70-year-old former wrestling champion regarded this occasion as the “greatest day of his life” and shared the memorable moment on his Instagram account.\n\n“Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life. No worries, no hate, no judgment… only love!”\n\nHogan, born Terry Eugene Bollea, stated that he had known and accepted Jesus as his Lord and Savior at the age of 14. However, he did not consistently live out his faith as a Christian until later on. Nevertheless, when Hogan experienced a renewed encounter with God’s love, he began utilizing his fame as a platform to share Jesus with others.\n\nDuring an interview, he boldly declared that Jesus is the sole entity of significance in this world. He said, “You know, I realized that as long as I made the right choice and followed my faith more than what people are saying in the tabloids and newspapers, none of that stuff was real. The only thing that is really real is the stuff that’s gonna last forever – your faith and your belief in God.”\n\nHe added, “Maybe we need to take this time of isolation from the distractions of the world and have a personal revival where we focus on the ONLY thing in the world that really matters – Jesus.”\n\nWWE legend, Hulk Hogan, has been vocal about his faith and belief in God. In a recent interview, he declared that Jesus is the only thing that’s real in the world.\n\nHulk Hogan\n\nTerry Eugene Bollea is famously known by his ring name, Hulk Hogan. According to IGN, the retired wrestler is the most recognized wrestling star worldwide and the most popular wrestler in the 1980s. But today, he is using his fame to share his faith in Jesus.\n\nHogan claimed he received Christ when he was still 14. However, he did not follow the path of being a Christian seriously. But by the grace of God, he re-encountered the love of Christ and since then, he has been proclaiming Jesus.\n\nJesus is the only One who matters\n\nHulk Hogan talks about Jesus\n\nHe said in an interview that Jesus is the only real thing in the passing world. “Well, you know, when things were tough, I realized that this too shall pass. This was just a temporary situation.”\n\nHe added, “You know, I realized that as long as I made the right choice and followed my faith more than what people are saying in the tabloids and newspapers, none of that stuff was real. The only thing that is really real is the stuff that’s gonna last forever – your faith and your belief in God.”\n\n“Once you’re a Christian, you’ve accepted Christ as your Savior. You’re not gonna perish but you’re gonna have everlasting life. That belief is pretty much the only thing that is real to me.”\n\nThe 67-years-old proved his point during the pandemic wherein he continually encouraged his fans and followers to reevaluate their lives and turn back to God.\n\nHe said, “Maybe we need to take this time of isolation from the distractions of the world and have a personal revival where we focus on the ONLY thing in the world that really matters – Jesus.”\n\nALSO READ:\n\nPro Athletes Boldly Testify About Jesus LIVE On TV\n\nTerry Bollea, popularly know as Hulk Hogan is an American retired professional wrestler.

At one time he was ousted by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) but has since been reinstated to their hall of fame. He went through a very difficult time during a divorce and considered committing suicide. However his faith brought him through.\n\n“I’ve leaned on my religion. I was saved when I was 14. I accepted Christ as my savior. He died on the Cross and paid for my sins,” he says. “I could have went the wrong way. I could have self-destructed, but I took the high road”.\n\n“But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God,the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:22-23)"
