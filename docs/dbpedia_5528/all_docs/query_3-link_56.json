        "text": "Over the past few decades, Hulk Hogan has emerged as the single most iconic and legendary professional wrestler in history. And just before Christmas this year, he is making a pretty profound and shocking announcement.\n\nThis week, just a few days before Christians across the world celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, Hulk Hogan announced that he had been baptized in “total surrender and dedication” to Jesus, calling it “the greatest day of my life.”\n\n“Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life. No worries, no hate, no judgment… only love!” Hogan said in a post on X, the social media website that was formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe post included a series of photos showing Hogan and his family wearing all white and getting baptized together at a church.\n\nThis announcement came as quite a surprise to many, and the social media world had a lot to say about it as a result.\n\nThis obviously marks an important moment in the life of the legendary professional wrestler, and it’s clear that he’s generating a lot of buzz around the world with his announcement as it reached more than five million people across the globe."
