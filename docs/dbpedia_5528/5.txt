Hulk Hogan has decided to dedicate his life to Jesus and got baptised.

The 70-year-old former wrestling legend revealed to his social media followers that he wanted to ensure he was living out the rest of his days in servitude to the Big Person Upstairs.

He shared photos of him and new wife, Sky Daily, wearing white clothes and dunking themselves under water.

Hulk even had a white bandana on to ensure his aesthetic continued.

"Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life. No worries, no hate, no judgment… only love!" he wrote on Instagram.

Hulk and Skye were all smiles once their baptism was done and dusted.

The two were congratulated for committing to God.

"He is a Christian, a man who's not perfect, we should all understand that. May God bless you and grant you your peace. You are the biggest star in the history of professional wrestling. God bless you Hulk!" said one fan.

Another added: "I am so glad you truly found Jesus. We will all bend a knee and answer to our Creator the Lord and savior Jesus Christ. He is the way, the Truth and the life!"

A third joked: "Whatcha gonna do when this holiness runs wild all over you brother!"

Hulk and Skye got hitched earlier this year after a short engagement.

According to the Daily Mail, the couple married in Clearwater, Florida, back in September with their nearest and dearest in attendance for the small ceremony.

TMZ reported that the bride walked down the aisle in Rue de Seine’s dress with 18-karat white gold earrings encrusted with four-karat diamonds with a matching bracelet and necklace.

The couple exchanged vows and their $500,000 rings at Indian Rocks Baptist Church.

In July, the former wrestler announced the two were engaged at actor Corin Nemec and his wife Sabrina Nova’s wedding.
