        "text": "Who had the better career: Eli Manning or Philip Rivers? I think both will be hall of famers. Rivers has better stats but what did he do in big games? And it's not like he didn't have talent around him. Eli played great in two post-seasons that led to Super Bowls over the GOAT and the Evil Empire.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nThe answer is kind of obvious and should be unanimous. 2 SB's is far better than 0 SB's.\n\nEli easily had the best career of the two.\n\nNow, an argument can be made the Rivers was the better QB, but there's no denying Eli had the better career\n\nYouâ€™re using super bowls in a team sport?using that logic Marino was a terrible qb\n\nI do give Rivers the edge in baby making. He's the MVP of that.\n\nHis wife's uterus is probably destroyed. LoL\n\nMY fondest memory of Rivers was him trying to quiet down the roar from Steeler fans when the Chargers had the ball - AT HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI give it to Ely because he's the only thing between the Pats and 2 more SB rings. My standards are purely selfish.\n\nThink theres Cromartie? who couldn't even remember all his kids name. LOL\n\nTHATS A LOW BLOW\n\nBut with one wife...that's a lot of kids to birth, you have to be immune to pain\n\nMaking Manning the MVP of that first victory over the Patriots was a joke. He escaped when a defender got a hand on him, which was rare for him but is very common for most quarterbacks, and threw a ball up for grabs that Tyree was lucky to catch. Sure, he threw the touchdown on that drive, too, but it helped that the Patriots somehow lost track of Burress. He wasn't even college open. That was high school open.\n\nSomebody on that defense should have been MVP.\n\nManning was a decent quarterback who had two great playoff runs. I can understand the argument that he had a better career, but Rivers was the better quarterback.\n\nEli deserve a HOF assumption that he is going to get in.\n\nPhillip Rivers to me is not a guaranteed HOFer.\n\nWell yes and no. I'm using Superbowls as a form of success, not to say who is better. Being a SB winner doesn't make one guy better than the other, although there is something to be said about rising up in big games, which not all players can do.\n\nI'm saying that 2 SB's is far more successful than 0 SB's, regardless of personal achievements. So IMO, Manning had the more successful career, even though I think Rivers was more talented and in a vacuum was the better player."
