        "text": "Philip Rivers could meet the same pitiful end that Eli Manning did this season.\n\nShould the 37-year-old Rivers continue to struggle, the 4-7 Los Angeles Chargers could bench the longtime quarterback in favor of Tyrod Taylor, according to NFL Network.\n\nRivers, who’s set to start Sunday against the Broncos, has seven interceptions over his last two games. Rivers has been named to each of the last three Pro Bowls, but the Chargers may end up looking for their next franchise quarterback during the offseason with the team set to move into a new stadium with the Rams in 2020.\n\nRivers and Manning are forever linked because of the draft-day trade that saw the Chargers trade Manning, taken with the No. 1 pick, to the Giants for Rivers, selected at No. 4.\n\nFifteen years later, the two may be on their way out together. Manning, 38, was benched after Week 2 as the Giants turned to rookie Daniel Jones. The Giants then won two straight but have since lost seven consecutive games entering Sunday’s matchup against the Packers."
