        "text": "Well, shoot. It looks like the moment we’ve all been anticipating for some time has finally arrived.\n\nFormer Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, the G-rated talker and fiery competitor, is calling it a career after 17 seasons in the NFL — 16 with the Chargers — according to Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\n“It’s just time,” the 39 year old told Acee late Tuesday night inside his home in Indianapolis. “I can sit here and say, ‘I can still throw it. I love to play,’ ” Rivers said. “But that’s always going to be there. I’m excited to go coach high school football.”\n\nRivers ends his time in the NFL after starting 252-straight games. He never missed a contest after earning the starting job with the Chargers in 2006, and that includes the playoffs and the AFC Championship Game where he played just six days after having surgery on a torn ACL.\n\nHis final career record as a starter will stand at 134-106. He finished fifth all-time in passing yards and touchdowns with 63,440 and 421, respectively. He made the playoffs seven times (six with the Chargers, once with the Colts), reaching the divisional round four times and the AFC title game once. Rivers was an eight-time Pro Bowl-selection, earning three-straight nods two separate times from 2009-2011 and 2016-2018.\n\nIn his final NFL season, Rivers helped lead the Colts to an 11-5 record and a playoff appearance before falling to the Buffalo Bills in the wild card round. The 2020 season became his eighth-straight campaign of throwing for over 4,000 yards and concluded 15-straight years of throwing for at least 21 touchdowns.\n\nEffective immediately, Rivers is set to take over as head coach for the varsity football team at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama. He will follow in the footsteps of his father who coached him throughout his prep career at Athens High School in Athens, Alabama.\n\n“What has helped me come to this (decision) is the growing desire to coach high school football,” Rivers said. “That’s what I’ve always wanted to do. It’s been growing. I can’t wait.”\n\nWe wish Philip and his family nothing but the best as he pursues his other dreams and wish him the best of luck in all his future endeavors. The NFL truly won’t be the same without him.\n\nEnjoy retirement, number 17."
