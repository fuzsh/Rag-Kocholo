        "text": "[jwplayer ZUYHPyKA-ThvAeFxT]\n\nFormer Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers announced his retirement from the NFL on Wednesday, telling Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune that “it’s just time.”\n\nRivers spent 16 years with the Chargers, including 14 as the starting quarterback. He amassed 59,271 passing yards and 397 touchdown passes during his time with the Chargers, ranking first in franchise history in both categories. He had a record of 123-101 with the Chargers, making the playoffs six times and going 5-6 in 11 postseason games.\n\nIn his final NFL season, Rivers led the Colts to an 11-5 record with 24 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions. He threw for 4,169 yards, the eighth straight season he topped 4,000 yards through the air.\n\nRivers will embark on a new journey in his post-playing days. He’ll take over as the head coach of the St. Michael Catholic High School football team in Fairhope, Ala., a move that was announced last May.\n\n“What has helped me come to this (decision) is the growing desire to coach high school football,” he told Acee. “That’s what I’ve always wanted to do. It’s been growing. I can’t wait.”\n\nRivers made the Pro Bowl eight times, won Offensive Player of the Month four times, has the fifth-most passing yards in NFL history (63,440) and ranks fifth in career touchdown passes (421). Despite never winning a Super Bowl, he boasts a Hall of Fame resume after being the fourth overall pick in the 2004 draft and getting traded from the Giants to the Chargers."
