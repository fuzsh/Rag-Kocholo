        "text": "Legendary Ex-NFL quarterback, Philip Rivers, enjoyed a very successful 17-year career in the NFL that saw him earn over $250 million dollars. It is estimated that his net worth is over $200 million dollars.\n\nRivers spent a total of 16 years with the Chargers in both San Diego and Los Angeles. During his full tenure with the Bolts, the quarterback earned over $230 million dollars.\n\nFor his final season as a professional football player, Rivers signed a one-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts in 2020 worth $25 million dollars.\n\nThe Alabama native is sixth on the list of NFL all-time passing yards and touchdowns and is on his way to becoming a Hall of Fame member even though he never played in a Super Bowl.\n\nLast week Philip and his wife Tiffany made headlines by announcing they were expecting their 10th child this October, their third boy. The couple has been married for more than 22 years.\n\nHow much does Philip Rivers make?\n\nWith 9 kids to support plus another on the way, it is no wonder fans are curious to know how much money did the quarterback make during his NFL career.\n\nWhile Rivers currently enjoys a modest life in Fairhope, Alabama, where he coaches High School Football at St. Michaels Catholic High School, during his stardom in the NFL he was one of the top-earning players in the league.\n\nIn fact, Forbes placed him as one of the top 100 earning athletes of 2020 in the #88 spot with an average yearly salary of $23.4 million dollars.\n\nRivers, who earned 8 pro bowl selections during his career, considered taking a job in media after his retirement but instead opted to live the quiet life he always dreamed of.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in 2020, the Chargers legend confirmed he had the intention of living his dream of being a high school football coach just like his father: \"I had two childhood dreams. One was to play in the NFL, and I've been able to do that . . . The other is to be a high school football coach as my dad did.\""
