        "text": "There are many that believe Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is the greatest of all time, but Philip Rivers isn’t one of them.\n\nWhen debating Brady as the “GOAT”, the amount of Super Bowl titles will always be brought up in discussion.\n\nRivers doesn’t believe that championships are the most ideal way to determine the label. He went on to pointing out Super XLIX when the Patriots played the Seahawks as a reason why.\n\n“I remember thinking when the Patriots beat the Seahawks, when they had that interception against the Seahawks down [on the goal line] and that gave them what, their [fourth] championship?” Rivers said. “You know everyone said, ‘Well, he’s now the greatest of all time.’ And I thought to myself, I already thought he was already one of [the greatest] — I mean, how do you ever decide that?\n\nIt’s like the old Michael Jordan [debate], right? We could talk about that forever, too — but I already thought he was already one of the greatest of all-time, but because they intercepted the pass, he’s now the greatest of all time? What if the Seahawks were to run it in? And the Seahawks were to have won? Brady would have just played the exact same game. He didn’t do anything different, you know?”\n\nThere’s no denying that Brady is one of the most accomplished quarterbacks ever. He has played in 19 NFL seasons, has made nine Super Bowl appearances and has won six of them. Out of those victories, you can make the case that a few of them could’ve been a different outcome and the game against Seattle is a great example.\n\nRivers has yet to make a Super Bowl appearance in his 15-year stint, but he’s come awfully close a couple times. The 37-year old quarterback believes that a former player that never won a ring deserves to be in contention for the greatest of all time.\n\n“That’s why I always think Marino is right there in the mix, too. All these guys. You can’t just go off that [Super Bowl wins]. I don’t think that you can. Not in this sport, especially.”\n\nAlthough Rivers is one of the most confident players in the league, he doesn’t believe that he’s better than Brady.\n\n“No, I don’t think I can say that. A Brady-led team versus a Rivers-led team, we’re [winless]. That’s just tells you a little bit head-to-head.”\n\nSince the two players have been in the league, Brady is up 5-0 against Rivers."
