        "text": "Philip Rivers was taken with the fourth overall pick by the New York Giants in the 2004 NFL draft, then famously traded to the San Diego Chargers in exchange for first overall choice, Eli Manning.\n\nDue in part to being involved in one of the most notorious trades in NFL history, Rivers has had a lot to live up to over the course of his pro career. That pressure began even before he was drafted, when he attended the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nAs part of a series of short vignettes featuring NFL veterans sharing their memories of the combine, Rivers recalled a very rigorous process.\n\nVia NFL.com:\n\n“I did all the interviews, and those were pretty extensive. You know when you’re back-to-back-to-back going to these NFL teams, and some of them want to talk football and talk your favorite plays. Other ones want to talk about what makes you think you can lead an NFL football team.”\n\nHe also said that it took all he had not to take the bait that the coaches dangled in front of him to test his temperament.\n\nVia NFL.com:\n\n“It was like they were trying to see if they could get you angry,” said Rivers with a smirk. “They were trying to get you fired up, and they were really trying to see how aggravated they could get me. And it almost worked, but I was prepared to stay calm and handle the situation.”\n\nRivers’ college career resembled that of his professional one in many ways. During his time at NC State he demolished school and ACC conference records, and still remains in the top 10 in both passing yards by an Division 1-A quarterback.\n\nDespite slight concern over his mechanics of his delivery, most scouting reports at the time gave Rivers the benefit of the doubt due to consistency and high-productivity. I think it’s safe to say that not much has changed in the thirteen years since, as he’s still one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL."
