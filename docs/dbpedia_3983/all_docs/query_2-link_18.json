        "text": "The Rivers family is expanding to a dozen.\n\nEx-NFL quarterback Philip Rivers and his wife Tiffany are expecting their 10th child, he revealed to AL.com on Wednesday.\n\nBaby No. 10 is a boy and is due in October. Philip said they haven't decided on a name yet.\n\nPhilip and Tiffany currently have seven girls -- Halle, Caroline, Grace, Sarah, Rebecca, Clare and Anna -- and two boys -- Gunner and Peter -- ranging in age from 4 to 21. They welcomed their ninth child, Anna, in March 2019.\n\n“We’ve had one pretty much every two years and now this is the longest gap,” Rivers, who currently serves as a football coach at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama, told AL.com. “We are all fired up. Everyone was pulling for a boy. Even our girls wanted a boy.”\n\nThe former Chargers and Colts signal-caller isn't a stranger to big families. His mother and grandfather both came from families of nine children. Philip told the IndyStar in 2020 that he and Tiffany didn't put a number on how many kids they would have.\n\nNFL\n\n“I think really, it was just whatever God’s will was,” Rivers said at the time. “We were just open. Certainly didn’t have a number on it. Still don’t.”"
