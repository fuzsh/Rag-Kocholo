        "text": "Longtime NFL quarterback Philip Rivers has another son to coach in the future.\n\nThe St. Michael Catholic High football coach and wife Tiffany welcomed their 10th child earlier this week.\n\nAndrew Joseph Rivers (8 pounds, 10 ounces, 22 inches) was born Monday.\n\n“It’s awesome. Tiffany is awesome,” Rivers said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s the first child or the 10th child. It’s an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.”\n\nThe Rivers have seven daughters and now three sons. The oldest daughter is 21. The oldest son, Gunner, is the starting quarterback as a freshman for playoff bound St. Michael Catholic. Peter is in the sixth grade. Rivers also has a nephew who is 5.\n\n“There is a chance for a Rivers to be throwing it around or catching it or tackling or doing something for the Cardinals for a long time,” he said. “I’ll be 60 when this one (Andrew) has his Senior Night.”\n\nRivers retired from pro football in 2021 after 17 seasons and after passing for more than 63,000 yards. He was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection who started his career with the Chargers in 2004 and finished it with one season as the Colts’ quarterback in 2020. He is 17-12 in his third year as the St. Michael head coach in Fairhope, Ala.\n\nRivers followed in the footsteps of his father, Steve, who also was a high school football coach. He said Friday he doesn’t have a desire at this point to coach at a higher level than high school.\n\n“I think I would have gone right into it had that been what I wanted to do,” he said. “But, really, I’ve longed to coach my boys and these other 15-18 year-old boys since I was 25. I’m good right here.”\n\nRivers has St. Michael in the playoffs this year for the first time in the school’s seven-year football history. The Cardinals (6-4) will play next week – likely on the road – though the matchup hasn’t been officially set.\n\nSt. Michael defeated T.R. Miller 55-54 in overtime last week and is idle this week. He said before last week’s game that he thought the baby might come at any moment.\n\n“We pulled into Volanta Park about 6 p.m. and Tiff called and said things were picking up,” he said. “I’m like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding.’ About 6:50, she called and said everything was good, and we got through the game. We are thankful and blessed. I’m thankful it happened during our off week. I guess he (Andrew) knew we had to get past T.R. Miller.”\n\nA large family is not out of the ordinary for the Rivers family. Philip said his mother comes from a family of nine children and her father also comes from a family of nine.\n\n“We thought we would be the third generation of nine, but we decided to go double digits – or I should say we didn’t decide it. God decided,” he said."
