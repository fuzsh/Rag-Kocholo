        "text": "Former Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers can now form a starting offense with him and his kids.\n\nRivers announced that he and his wife, Tiffany, are expecting their tenth baby together, per AL.com’s Ben Thomas.\n\n“We’ve had one pretty much every two years, and now this is the longest gap,” Rivers said. “We are all fired up. Everyone was pulling for a boy. Even our girls wanted a boy.”\n\nRivers added that they will be having a boy who is expected to be born sometime in the fall.\n\nCurrently, the family consists of seven girls and two boys, ages 4 to 21.\n\nGunner, Philip’s oldest son, will be the starting quarterback for St. Michael Catholic in Fairhope, AL, which is the high school Rivers has been coaching for after retiring from the NFL. Entering Year 3 as head coach, Rivers has a record of 11-8.\n\nRivers spent 16 years with the Bolts, including 14 as the starting quarterback. He amassed 59,271 passing yards and 397 touchdown passes, ranking first in franchise history in both categories. He had a record of 123-101, making the playoffs six times and going 5-6 in 11 postseason games.\n\nIn his final NFL season, Rivers led the Colts to an 11-5 record with 24 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions. He threw for 4,169 yards, which was the eighth straight season he topped 4,000 yards through the air."
