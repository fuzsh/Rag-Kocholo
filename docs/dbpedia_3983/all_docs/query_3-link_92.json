        "text": "It’s the end of an era in the NFL. Quarterback Philip Rivers announced his retirement on Wednesday after just one season with his new franchise, the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nAccording to ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter, Rivers made the news official on Wednesday. The Colts will now be in the market for a new starting quarterback or go all in with impending second year man Jacob Eason as Jacoby Brissett hits free agency.\n\n“Colts’ QB Philip Rivers is retiring from football, he told @sdutKevinAcee,” Schefter tweeted.\n\nRivers spoke about his decision this week.\n\n“It’s just time,” Rivers told the Union-Tribune late Tuesday night from his home in Indianapolis, where earlier this month he completed his only season with the Colts. “It’s just right.\n\n“I can sit here and say, ‘I can still throw it. I love to play,’ but that’s always going to be there. I’m excited to go coach high school football.”\n\nRivers will coach St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama as their head coach, effective next season.\n\n“This is the first year I felt like the ending was real,” Rivers said about his retirement. “We talked about it other years, but we knew we weren’t doing it. This year felt different. … It just seemed right.”\n\nRivers released a comedic statement to ESPN to confirm his decision.\n\n\"Every year, January 20th is a special and emotional day,\" Rivers said. \"It is St. Sebastian's Feast Day, the day I played in the AFC Championship without an ACL, and now the day that after 17 seasons, I'm announcing my retirement from the National Football League. Thank you God for allowing me to live out my childhood dream of playing quarterback in the NFL. I am grateful to the Chargers for 16 seasons, and the Colts for the 17th season. Thank you to all my coaches that helped me grow as a player and person. Thanks to the support staff. I appreciate the opposing defenses making it challenging physically and mentally every week. I also enjoyed the banter. I appreciate the referees for putting up with all my fussing. I think I was right most of the time, dadgummit! Thanks to the fans in San Diego and around the nation that both cheered and booed. Special thanks to my teammates. Without at doubt my favorite part of the game, being a teammate. Thank you for being mine. Lastly, thank you to my wife and best friend Tiffany and our children Halle, Caroline, Grace, Gunner, Sarah, Peter, Rebecca, Clare and Anna. Could not have done it without y'all's unwavering support. As my playing career comes to an end, the next chapter begins.\"\n\nIn 16 starts in 2020, Rivers led the Colts to an 11-5 record and a playoff spot. However, they fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card round of the playoffs two weeks ago. Rivers finished the 2020 regular season 369 of 543 passing (68% completion percentage) for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.\n\nIn 17 seasons (16 with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers), Rivers threw for 63,440 yards, 421 touchdowns, 209 interceptions and completed 64.9% of his passes. Rivers is fifth all time in passing yards, trailing Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Brett Favre. He is also fifth in career touchdown passes behind the same set of quarterbacks.\n\nRivers made the playoffs seven times just seven times in 17 years (six times with the Chargers) and made just one AFC Championship, never making a Super Bowl. He famously played the 2007 AFC Championship with a torn ACL against the undefeated New England Patriots.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Rivers planned to retire if he did not return to the Colts in 2021.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, there were only two scenarios in play for Rivers as he determines his playing future: He will either return to the Colts for another season in 2021 or he will retire from football. Rivers, who signed a one-year deal to join the Colts in free agency, turned 39 years old in December and did not plan to play for another team besides Indianapolis."
