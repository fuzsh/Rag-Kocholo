        "text": "Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers has had quite the 2017 campaign after seeing his team falter to a 0-4 start.\n\nThe 14-year QB is in the midst of his best four-game stretch of his career, and one of the critical ingredients to Rivers’ success has been his ability to take care of the football as compared to the past three seasons where he threw a total of 52 interceptions.\n\nBut when asked if he has made any adjustments or changes in his approach to the game given that his interception percentage is at a career low 1.5 percent, Rivers was quick to point out that taking care of the ball isn’t something that is his new to him.\n\n“I really haven’t. I mean, I think the numbers don’t lie. Obviously, I’ve had a lot more turnovers over the past few years than I’m used to. But for the most part, I think I’ve been above average throughout my career in taking care of the football. [The] last couple of years, not as good, but as I’ve always said they all come out of my hand. I’m responsible for all of them, but there’s a story with all of them too,” Rivers said during media availability Wednesday.\n\nThen Rivers dropped a name that Chargers fans have not heard in quite some time.\n\n“The one thing, from [when I was] growing up [when] my dad coaching, to my first year in the NFL with Marty Schottenheimer here, he would say ‘that’s the biggest correlation to winning.’\n\nYou know, I’ve heard that my whole life, is turning the ball over and getting turnovers. And I think it’s pretty clear that that holds up. It’s always held up. But the last four weeks we haven’t turned it over, and we’ve gotten a bunch of them, and we’ve won four in a row.”\n\nBolts fans will hope that Rivers will keep protecting the ball while being able to play without pressing Saturday when they head to Arrowhead Stadium to take on the Chiefs at 5:30 p.m. PT on NFL Network."
