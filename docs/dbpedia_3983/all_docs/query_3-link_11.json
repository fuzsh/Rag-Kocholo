        "text": "am i the only person who remembers when the Chargers almost gave up on their talented young quarterback? they got philip rivers with their first round pick (the trade is irrelevant).\n\nthe point here is that imagine how good San Diego would be if they drafted a different player with that #1 pick. the rivers pick has been a complete waste so far, and maybe the other player drafted could have put that team over the top.\n\nlook at it this way.\n\nEither Carr or Young would have to sit. you have to subtract a player to add one.\n\nDavis, Young, Johnson\n\nOR you could have\n\nBush, Davis, Carr, Johnson.\n\nfour good players are better than three. this way the team doesnt sacrifice talent for talent. it just adds more on.\n\nthis is a repost from an astros message board, but my point is the same.\n\nBeerFan said:\n\nam i the only person who remembers when the Chargers almost gave up on their talented young quarterback? they got philip rivers with their first round pick (the trade is irrelevant).\n\nthe point here is that imagine how good San Diego would be if they drafted a different player with that #1 pick. the rivers pick has been a complete waste so far, and maybe the other player drafted could have put that team over the top.\n\nIf they would have drafted Manning, then Breese would have been no good? You r logic makes no sense. At least this way, the Chargers got more picks and a QB that is still not bad. I think they really would have lost out if Manning was in SD and they got no picks, because Breese would have outplayed Manning in Manning's first year.\n\nWhat needs to be considered, though, is salary. The question, and really crux of the matter, is simple: Is David Carr worth elite QB money? Will his \"potential\" translate into on-field performance worthy of getting paid in the top 10 of QBs?\n\nThe answer is tricky tough, because it's a team sport. Carr has been playing on the worst team in football for 2005. Evaluating talent become that much more difficult, because players don't play in a vacuum.\n\nBut the kind of money he will make if we pick up his option can limit our ability to pick up other players, which are desperate required to bring this team to any level of success. So it comes down to the question of Carr being able to justify his salary by doing more than just being an average QB. With so much invested in on position, the player must become a playmaker. I'm just not sure at this point if Carr has it in him or not.\n\nDouble Barrel said:\n\nWhat needs to be considered, though, is salary.

If the chargers had traded down like they did they could have had, Dunta, or Vilma, or Sean Taylor.\n\nThe point is they weakened another position by taking a player at the top of the draft that hasn't played.\n\nAnd there is no way they get a top 10 pick for Rivers when they trade him. so he lost most of his value because he has sat for 2 years doing nothing. and when he is traded will have to learn a new offense and acclimate himself with new players. I'd think the Dolphins should send a second rounder to the chargers for him but thats just my opinion."
