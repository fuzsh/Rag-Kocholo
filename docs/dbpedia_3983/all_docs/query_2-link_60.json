        "text": "It’s family first for Philip Rivers and his wife, Tiffany.\n\nThe former NFL quarterback and his high school sweetheart — who have been married since May 2001 — are the parents of 10 children, but they don’t have a number on how many kids could be added to their brood.\n\n“I think really, it was just whatever God’s will was,” Rivers told the Indy Star in September 2020. “We were just open. Certainly didn’t have a number on it. Still don’t.”\n\nRivers retired from playing professional football in 2021 following 17 years in the league and eight Pro Bowl selections, however he credits his wife for being the “heart” of their family through it all.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Tiffany Rivers:\n\nPhilip knew Tiffany was special from the start\n\nA devout Catholic, Philip previously spoke about what drew him to Tiffany when the met in middle school.\n\n“With Tiffany, I remember pointing her out at a ballgame at the ball field when I was young, but I remember telling my mom, ‘Hey Mom, see that girl over there, she’s a good girl.’ And she was centered on faith and Christ. She had those values that I was looking for,” Rivers said in a 2016 video for The Chastity Project.\n\n“That’s why it’s so important to find the people in your life that bring out the best in you, that continue to mold you and help you be the person you want to be,” he continued.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2001 after his freshman year at NC State. Three years later, he signed with the then-San Diego Chargers.\n\nTheir children are everything\n\nThe NFL made up a major part of Philip’s life, but Tiffany and their kids are forever the priority.\n\n“One in college, one in high school, and then an eighth-grader, sixth-grader, fifth-grader, third-grader, first-grader, preschooler, the little baby, the dynamics are different with all of them,” Rivers said of his kids in 2020. “They’re all awesome in their own unique way.”\n\nRivers and Tiffany have seven daughters: Halle, Caroline, Grace, Sarah, Rebecca, Clare and Anna. They also have three sons: Gunner, Peter and Andrew.\n\nHalle, according to Rivers, is most like Tiffany.\n\n“She reminds me, big-time, of her mom, which is a big compliment,” Rivers told the Indy Star. “The biggest compliment I can probably give.”\n\nFamily time was amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIn June 2020, the Rivers family relocated from Florida to Indianapolis, the home of the quarterback’s final football team. Rivers told Sports Illustrated’s Fan Nation in July of that year that he was savoring time at home with loved ones.\n\n“As you can imagine, that’s a lot of us at home all the time,” Rivers told the outlet. “It’s been awesome. It really has. It’s been really good. Our children can’t use the excuse that they’re bored. There’s plenty of playmates in the house.”"
