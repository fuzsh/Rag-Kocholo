        "text": "Ranking all 32 NFL teams' run-defense units after Week 6 - PFF Analysis Team\n\nTEAM RUN-DEFENSE GRADE: 66.7\n\nExplosive Runs Allowed %: 10.2 (21st)\n\nTeam Run-Defense Stuff %: 25.2 (10th)\n\nTop Run Defender (Run-Defense Grade): DI Darius Philon (81.7)\n\n32 NFL Observations, Week 6 - Nathan Jahnke\n\nCornerback Casey Hayward is allowing 1.4 yards after the catch per reception allowed, which is the fewest for cornerbacks this season.\n\nNFL Week 7 NFL CBS Tennessee Titans @ Los Angeles Chargers Preview - PFF Preview Team\n\nPhilip Rivers has been unstoppable when getting rid of the ball quickly (less than 2.5 seconds). His passer rating of 124.0 on throws in less than 2.5 seconds ranks 3rd out of 36 qualifying quarterbacks. The Titans’ defense will have their hands full with the feisty veteran and his quick trigger.\n\n2018 NFL Offensive Line Rankings: All 32 teams' units after Week 6 - Michael Renner\n\nAfter being drafted in the third round a season ago, the proverbial light switch just hasn’t flipped for Dan Feeney. His game-by-game splits this season are almost too dichotomous to believe. Against the Chiefs, Rams and 49ers, he allowed a total of 18 pressures. Against the Bills, Raiders and Browns, he didn’t allow any.\n\nRanking all 32 NFL teams' pass-rush units after Week 6 - PFF Analysis Team\n\nTEAM PASS-RUSH GRADE: 66.2\n\nTeam Pressure Percentage: 34% (T-13th)\n\nTeam Pressure Percentage when Blitzing: 63.8% (8th)\n\nTop Pass-Rusher (Pass-Rush Grade): Edge Melvin Ingram (72.7)\n\nPhilip Rivers is doing more than enough to enter the MVP conversation in 2018 - David Neumann\n\nWhile he may not be the MVP frontrunner, Rivers deserves mention when discussing the NFL’s best quarterbacks this season. Rivers is playing his best football of the past five years, and the Chargers have legitimately looked like one of the best teams in the NFL. Whether that will continue over the final 10 games remains to be seen — we are talking about the Chargers after all.\n\nGrading all 32 first rounders after Week 6 - Mark Chichester\n\nJames put forth yet another strong performance in his team’s Week 6 victory over the Browns, as he continues his push for Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. For the first time of his young career, James didn’t see a single target while he was in coverage, but that didn’t stop him from finding his way onto the stat sheet, as he tallied a sack from one of his six pass-rush snaps and also added two tackles against the run.\n\n15 stats to know from Week 6 in the NFL - Austin Gayle\n\nIn addition to King’s dominance in the slot, Chargers rookie safety Derwin James, who is a clear front-runner for Defensive Rookie of the Year honors through six weeks, has practically eliminated opposing tight ends this season. Of the 17 NFL defenders who have been targeted at least 10 times when covering tight ends through Week 6, James ranks first in passer rating allowed (14.6).\n\nSocial Media Information:\n\nBFTB Facebook Page: Click here to like our page\n\nBFTB Twitter: Follow @BFTB_Chargers\n\nThe Lightning Round Twitter: Follow @Lightning_Round\n\nThe Lightning Round Facebook: Click here to like our page"
