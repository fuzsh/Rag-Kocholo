        "text": "This morning on Toucher & Hardy, Albert Breer from the MMQB talked about how Drake Maye shares similarities with Philip Rivers, highlighting their competitive personalities and the need for ambitious quarterback selections, especially considering the strong competition in the conference with top quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen.\n\nWATCH HERE:\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nFRED TOUCHER: Did you say Drake Maye reminds you of Philip Rivers in his personality?\n\nALBERT BREER: Yeah, his personality. Yeah, okay, yeah.\n\nFRED TOUCHER: I thought that was interesting. Well, that’d be great if he was Philip Rivers. I mean, hopefully he wins a little bit more, but that would be awesome. Ideally.\n\nALBERT BREER: I want a bunch like, you know, the Super Bowl though. Didn’t win a Super Bowl, but…\n\nFRED TOUCHER: And he sucked with Indianapolis, I would say.\n\nALBERT BREER: Say like, I would say like if you looked at the result of most of these, when you come off a legendary quarterback like what Miami had after Dan Marino, what Buffalo had after Jim Kelly, what Denver had after John Elway. If you wind up with Philip Rivers four years after Tom Brady, like that’s not a bad result.\n\nFRED TOUCHER: He seems like you like him, like you think he’s got a good personality?\n\nALBERT BREER: I think it’s like, well, you have this competitive personality with him. And I think like it really matters to him, which is an important part of playing quarterback. Of course, not that it did matter to Mac while he was here. I also think, like with this one, guys like you had to swing for the fences and I, I’ve said this a few times to you, but like it. You aren’t going to get to just having a good enough quarterback. And in a conference where you’re going to be dealing with the next ten for over the next ten years with Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, Lamar Jackson, now C.J. Stroud, Justin Herbert, it’s not good enough. Trevor Lawrence, you know, I think you have to take a swing for the fences in this case. And I think if you look at what Drake May is physically versus the other three guys that were available that went in the first round, I don’t know that it’s that close. Like, I think Drake May is physically superior to those other guys.\n\nCONNECT WITH TOUCHER & HARDY: linktr.ee/ToucherandHardy\n\nFor the latest updates, visit the show page on 985thesportshub.com.
