        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. – The duo of Kevin \"KC\" Concepcion and Aydan White have been named to the 2024 All-ACC Preseason Team the league announced Thursday night.\n\nSophomore wide receiver Concepcion is coming off a year in which he took home the ACC Rookie of the Year and Offensive Rookie of the Year. He was a freshman All-American according to the FWAA (a an all-purpose player), The Athletic, PFF, 247, and On3.\n\nA finalist for the Shaun Alexander Freshman of the Year Award, Concepcion Set the NC State freshman record for receiving TDs (10) and receptions (71). Those 71 catches were the sixth-best single-season mark in school history. His 839 receiving yards was the No. 14 mark in the single-season record book. That mark was the second-best in school history by a freshman.\n\nAmong the conference, Concepcion was one of the best in the league, ranking 10th in the ACC in all-purpose yards (89.2/game) and third in the ACC in receptions (5.5 per game).\n\nAlready being named to the Paycom Jim Thorpe Award earlier in the week, cornerback Aydan White is named to the preseason All-ACC team for the second consecutive year.\n\nOver the past two seasons, White has not allowed a touchdown pass. He has eight career interceptions, the highest total on the 2024 Wolfpack squad. Last season, White Ranked fifth in the ACC in passes defended—he had 10 breakups and two interceptions. To close out the year, he was named to the All-ACC Third Team.\n\n2024 Preseason All-ACC Football Team\n\nQB: Cam Ward, Miami (85)\n\nRB: Omarion Hampton, North Carolina (114)\n\nRB: Jaydn Ott, Cal (70)\n\nWR: Kevin \"KC\" Concepcion, NC State (119)\n\nWR: Xavier Restrepo, Miami (93)\n\nWR: Elic Ayomanor, Stanford (42)\n\nTE: Oronde Gadsden II, Syracuse (48)\n\nAP: Jaydn Ott, Cal (49)\n\nOT: Darius Washington, Florida State (93)\n\nOT: Blake Miller, Clemson (53)\n\nOG: Willie Lampkin, North Carolina (64)\n\nOG: Michael Gonzalez, Louisville (56)\n\nC: Maurice Smith, Florida State (62)\n\nDE: Ashton Gillotte, Louisville (52)\n\nDE: Rueben Bain, Jr., Miami (49)\n\nDT: Joshua Farmer, Florida State (75)\n\nDT: Aeneas Peebles, Virginia Tech (64)\n\nLB: Barrett Carter, Clemson (129)\n\nLB: Francisco Mauigoa, Miami (72)\n\nLB: Marlowe Wax, Syracuse (67)\n\nCB: Dorian Strong, Virginia Tech (65)\n\nCB: Aydan White, NC State (56)\n\nS: Jonas Sanker, Virginia (73)\n\nS: R.J.
