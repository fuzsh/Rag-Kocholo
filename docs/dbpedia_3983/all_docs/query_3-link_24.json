        "text": "Since becoming a starting quarterback in 2006, Philip Rivers has been one of the most productive players at his position in the NFL. He has passed for more than 4,000 yards in eight of the last nine seasons and has thrown more than 20 touchdown passes in every season since taking the reins as starter.\n\nHe holds almost every Chargers record at the QB position and is poised to become the greatest quarterback in Chargers history.\n\nRivers isn’t just a big time NFL quarterback, though. He’s also a husband to Tiffany and the father of eight children. Yes, that’s right, EIGHT children.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ is also important to Rivers, and he recently shared his spiritual journey with Miles McPherson at The Rock Church in San Diego.\n\n“My faith has always been very important to me,” Rivers told McPherson. “When I went to college (at North Carolina State) is really when it became my own. I had to get up out of that dorm room and go to church, go to mass on Sunday. That’s when I took ownership of my faith.”\n\nRivers talked with McPherson about getting married at 19 years old and remaining pure before becoming husband and wife.\n\n“Remaining pure, being chaste, was very important to us,” Rivers said. “Obviously there wouldn’t be many other reasons to get married at that point. I didn’t have a penny to my name.”\n\nRivers went on to talk about the reason he’s been able to stay married and have eight children over the past 16 years.\n\n“I think that the center of our marriage and the foundation of our relationship was on Jesus, that is why it’s worked to this point.”\n\nAt the end of his appearance with McPherson at The Rock, Rivers provided encouragement to those in attendance.\n\n“Too many times we think we’ve fallen too far from God or we’re not worthy,” Rivers said. “Only by God’s mercy and grace. We aren’t worthy, we’re all sinners, but we are because of Jesus dying for us.”\n\nRivers and the Chargers report to their new home in Los Angeles for training camp later this month."
