        "text": "Philip Rivers has beaten the Patriots before. All it took was one of the best games of his career — and the absence of one of the best players in NFL history.\n\nThe Chargers knocked off New England on a perfect mid-October evening in 2008, winning 30-10 in front of 68,704 at Qualcomm Stadium. Rivers threw for 306 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions — logging a 141.9 passer rating that still stands as his seventh-best single-game mark. Tom Brady, meanwhile, wasn’t even in uniform. He had torn his ACL five weeks earlier, his left leg twisted awkwardly by Kansas City safety Bernard Pollard.\n\nBut there’s still plenty of history to look back on. The Patriots’ star quarterback has dueled Rivers four times in the regular season, logging a passer rating of 108.6 — almost identical to his current year-long mark. Brady is also undefeated in their playoff matchups, winning twice despite six combined interceptions.\n\nWill Rivers finally break through this Sunday (10 a.m. PT, CBS) at Gillette Stadium?\n\n“I’m looking forward to getting another shot,” he said this week. “With him as the quarterback over there, we’re 0-for.”\n\nThat lone victory in 2008 over the Matt Cassel-led Patriots bumped the Chargers back up to .500, a crucial game en route to an unlikely postseason bid. That year, Rivers and his teammates fought back from a 4-8 start, closing the regular season with four straight wins and beating the Colts in the wild-card round.\n\nRivers and tight end Antonio Gates are the only holdovers from that roster, but they and the rest of the Chargers hope to spark something similar against the Patriots (5-2). After an 0-4 start under first-year head coach Anthony Lynn, the Chargers have reeled off three consecutive victories. A fourth straight win — especially one in Foxborough — would lend legitimacy to their long-shot postseason aspirations.\n\nBut a subplot to the weekend is the matchup between Rivers and Brady. They won’t actually line up against each other, but in a league that is losing stars to injuries on a weekly basis, their names still headline the marquee.\n\n“I don’t try to shy away from that,” Rivers said. “I don’t feel like I’m playing Tom Brady, by any means, but it’s still a big deal to me, as a fan of quarterbacks … I’ve still allowed myself to be that fan, in a sense, to have that love for the game, that love for the position.\n\n“That’s what I grew up with. I didn’t really grow up an NFL fan. I grew up loving quarterbacks.”\n\nAs a child in northern Alabama, Rivers covered his room with posters: Favre and Aikman; Marino and Montana; Elway and Young. Many have done the same with Brady and Rivers, who have combined for 468 career starts.\n\nThey could not be more different. Brady recently lent his name to a limited-edition Aston Martin, with a dozen cars selling at $359,950 each. He has been on the cover of GQ multiple times, wearing sleek jackets and sherpa-lined coats. Earlier this year, he released a New York Times bestseller — albeit one that dispenses some questionable health advice.\n\nRivers tricked out an SUV this year for his long commutes, but did so to keep from uprooting his wife and eight children from their San Diego County home. Introduced during a ceremony in Inglewood nine months ago, Rivers told the crowd: “I hope I’m all right in blue jeans and cowboy boots, because that’s what you’re gonna get.” Stretching passes for cutting edge in his health regimen.\n\nBut the most meaningful gulf between them is that one that opens up in January and February. Rivers has nine playoff appearances, and a 4-5 record in the postseason. Brady only has nine playoff losses, with five of his 25 postseason victories coming in the Super Bowl.\n\nBrady also turned 40 in August, and has expressed his intention to play for another five years. Can Rivers, 35, last that long?\n\n“We’ll just kind of see,” Rivers said. “I’ve never said I want to play until this day, or this many years, but as I stand now, the passion and love to compete I still have, from that standpoint, yes, if I can continue to play well enough to play until I’m 40.\n\n“It’s not something you’re just given. You have to go out there and prove it.”"
