Asylum Officers use asylum law, interviews with asylum applicants, and relevant information on country conditions to determine the merits of individual claims for asylum. As specified in the Regulations (8 CFR 208.12), as amended, such information may be obtained from \"the Department of State, the Office of International Affairs, other Service offices, or other credible sources, such as international organizations, private voluntary agencies, news organizations, or academic institutions.\"\n\nPerspectives are one means by which information on human rights conditions in a country and/or conditions affecting given groups or individuals deemed \"at risk\" within a given country is presented to Asylum and Immigration Officers. Perspectives are written by recognized authorities under contract to the Resource Information Center, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Department of Justice. Perspectives cannot be, and do not purport to be either exhaustive with regard to the country surveyed, or conclusive as the merits of any particular claim to refugee status or asylum. Nor do they purport to summarize a range of opinions on a given issue: the perspective offered is that of the contributing authority. It is for the Asylum Officer adjudicating a particular case to determine what evidentiary weight to give to the information in this Perspective.\n\nThe inclusion of this Perspective in the collection of Perspectives compiled by the Service does not constitute an endorsement of the information in this Perspective.

Introduction\n\nWhen Alvaro Arz� Irigoyen took the oath of office as President of Guatemala on January 14, 1996, he vowed to bring an end to three and a half decades of civil war and \"to fight impunity head on.\" Within days, he moved to restructure the armed forces, retiring half of the countrys generals, and dismissing scores of police officers tied to criminal activities. A month later, he became the first President to meet with the guerrilla leadership. In September, he dismissed another nine senior military officers, signed an agreement with the rebels to reduce the size of the armed forces, and limit their involvement in domestic affairs. Before the end of the yearon December 29he secured the signing of a peace treaty which ended the last insurgency in Central America.\n\nDespite these historic developments, Guatemala still has a long way to go to create a society and polity capable of safeguarding the most basic human rights of its citizens. That is particularly true of its historically oppressed indigenous majority. Well over a hundred thousand Mayan peasants perished in the civil war, almost all at the hands of the armed forces, who frequently massacred entire villages. Though the war has receded, the racism that fed its savagery has not. As documented in this report, incidents of discrimination and violence directed at members of indigenous ethnic groups continue to be widespread.\n\nMayans are not the only group at risk. In urban areas, the Governments counter-insurgency efforts focused on eliminating dissent among whites and ladinos (persons of mixed European and indigenous ancestry). Death squads organized by the military and extreme right-wing organizations targeted human rights advocates, teachers, university professors, clergy, union leaders, judges, prosecutorsin short, anyone seeking, or suspected of seeking, change. Thousands were abducted, tortured, and killed, as a warning to others. Though President Arz� has acted to sever the links between the security forces and clandestine organizations, there are signs that many of the latter continue to operate as renegade criminal organizations, often with continuing ties to members of the police and armed forces.\n\nIn an interview just before the signing of the peace accord, President Arz� cautioned that \"[w]ere done with the first stage, and now comes the hard part Its going to be a real\n\nchallenge.\" The biggest part of that challenge is, as Arz� recognized in his inaugural address, impunity. Until members of the armed forces, police, death squads, and guerrilla organizations who have engaged in murder, torture, and rape are brought to account for their actions, such patterns of behavior will persist, as demonstrated in this report.\n\nTo date, few human rights violators have been brought before a court of law, and still fewer convicted and sentenced. Complicating the challenge of ending impunity is the National Reconciliation Law passed by the Guatemalan Congress on December 18, 1996, over the objections of the center-left New Guatemalan Democratic Front (FDNG) and the National Union of the Center (UCN). The law \"extinguishes criminal responsibility\" for crimes committed up until the date of passage by the legislature. Yet, in an improvement over previous amnesty laws in Argentina and El Salvador, this one specifically excludes from amnesty cases of forced disappearance, torture, and genocide. Guatemala is also a party to the American Convention on Human Rights, which does not permit extinguishing responsibility for other crimes, such as extrajudicial executions. On the other hand, interpretation of these provisions will ultimately rest with the Guatemalan judiciary, which has so far demonstrated little resolve to end impunity for human rights violations.\n\nThe peace treaty signed on December 29 also creates a Commission for Historical Clarification, intended to provide an official account of human rights violations during the guerrilla war. But the Commission has only three members, a $50,000 budget, and six months to complete its work. It is, moreover, barred by its charter from naming individuals responsible for serious crimes. To counter that defect, Guatemalan human rights groups are producing parallel reports. The human rights office of the Roman Catholic Church (Oficina de Derechos Humanos del Arzobispado de Guatemala, ODHAG) is sponsoring the Project to Recover Historical Memory (REMHI), which since 1995 has been interviewing survivors of some of the worst atrocities. The Project, financed by donations from Scandinavian countries, has so far documented 483 mass killings, and received information about more than 300 clandestine cemeteries. Meanwhile, a coalition of 27 human rights organizations is pooling files on about 10,000 cases of forced disappearance, torture, and execution.\n\nUntil the challenge of impunity has been met, none of the groups that have historically been at risk in Guatemala will be truly safe. It is therefore important for outside observers not to be lulled into complacency by the end of the civil war or by the obvious good intentions of President Arz�. In a more\n\nfundamental sense, the civil conflict will not be over until impunity is brought to an end, and the broader features of Guatemalas new political accord, including recognition of the rights of the indigenous majority, are implemented.\n\nII. Historical Background to 1944\n\nAmong the factors bedeviling Guatemalan history and politics is that the country is the product of an incomplete conquest. Though Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado subdued the native Mayan peoples in the 1520s and 1530s, they have to this day remained a majority. That is in sharp contrast with the outcome in such settler states as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and (within Latin America) Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Costa Rica, where European populations quickly became majorities.\n\nGuatemala is likewise a settler state, in that its political system is dominated by descendants of European settlers. But because the European-Americans have stayed a tiny minority, Guatemala has remained unstable, like other settler states in which minority populations of European ancestry have tried to govern native majorities. Examples include South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) before their conversion to majority rule, and present-day Bolivia and Peru, which, like Guatemala, have Amerindian majorities, and a long history of political instability.\n\nThe attempt to preserve minority rule in settler states has costly social and political consequences. One is the tendency to resort to violence  or a credible threat of violence  to contain pressures for majority rule. Such countries tend to become highly militarized, with armies whose primary purpose is not to defend the nation from external attack, but to maintain internal order.\n\nBecause of their monopoly over the political system and the legal instruments of coercion, the descendants of settlers also have enormous advantages in education and business, advantages that accentuate the gulf between rich and poor. According to the World Bank, Guatemala has one of the worlds most unequal distributions of wealth and income. The close association between ethnicity and poverty in turn reinforces widely-held racial prejudices, undermining ideals of shared nationality and citizenship that could (as they do in many Asian countries) help shape a consensus for social reform.\n\nSharp socio-economic stratifications also limit prospects for sustained economic growth and democracy. When wage-earners are prevented from organizing to defend their interests, low wages translate into meager incomes that perpetuate social distinctions and limit development of\n\nthe consumer purchasing power essential to building a modern economy. In so doing, they also inhibit the formation of broad-based middle classes that moderate tensions between rich and poor and provide a firmer foundation for democracy.\n\nGuatemalas history is a testament to the destabilizing effects of its social structure. As a dependency of the Viceroyalty of Mexico, the Captaincy-General of Guatemala (encompassing all of present-day Central America as far south as Costa Rica) followed Mexico in declaring its independence from Spain in 1821. It remained part of Mexico until 1823, when it seceded and reorganized itself as the Central American Federation. The federation was at first governed by Conservatives headquartered in Guatemala City, but in 1829, Francisco Moraz�n, a Liberal general from Honduras, overwhelmed his adversaries. Moving the capital to San Salvador, Moraz�n enacted liberal reforms throughout the region. He abolished slavery and established habeas corpus and trial by jury. In 1832, the Liberals disestablished the Catholic Church, providing for full religious freedom, civil marriages, divorce, and lay education. Yet in their eagerness to modernize agriculture, the Liberals also alienated the Mayan majority. In 1829, they passed a law stripping Amerindiany villages and families of any lands for which they lacked titles.\n\nThe land grab sparked a revolution. Led by Rafael Carrera, a ladino who typified the plight of the Spanish-speaking, mixed-race population that was denied both the right to own land in Mayan villages and to hold public office, it quickly gained the support of the Amerindian population. In 1838, Carreras hordes took Guatemala City. The following year, Carrera withdrew Guatemala from the Central American Federation. Though often characterized as a conservative for his reversal of Liberal measures affecting landholding and the Church, Carrera could more accurately be compared with the Mexican mestizo Emiliano Zapata, who likewise sought to prevent the wholesale seizure of Amerindian lands by modernizing elites. Following Carreras death in 1865, Guatemalas indigenous majority began losing its ability to defend its land base.\n\nWhen the Liberals regained control of the Government in 1871, they took measures to prevent a repetition of the Carrera phenomenon. Dictator Justo Rufino Barrios built a modern army, with officers trained at the new Escuela Polit�cnica military academy. The armed forces quickly turned into the favored means of social advancement for ladinos, effectively splitting their interests from those of Amerindians.\n\nWith military backing, Barrios carried out the Liberal reforms held back by Carrera. He secularized the University of San Carlos, expelled some religious orders, and barred clerics from wearing religious garb or holding processions in public. When the church excommunicated him, he expelled the archbishop.\n\nOnce again, the Liberals set their sights on Mayan lands. In 1877, they enacted a law that forced villages to sell their communal holdings. This time, when the Mayan peoples tried to resist, they were subdued by the new, professional military dominated by their former ladino allies.\n\nThe redistribution of land helped convert the economy from the subsistence agriculture of the Mayan peoples toward the export agriculture championed by Liberals. Not only did the expropriations open up new lands for cultivation of coffee, they also created a vast population of landless peasants, with little choice but to work the coffee plantations at subsistence wages. Coffee quickly became Guatemalas most important source of wealth, with exports multiplying five-fold in the first fourteen years of the Barrios dictatorship. Meanwhile the Mayan peoples  dispossessed and subjected to what the British consul described as \"one of the most cruel despotisms the world has ever seen\"  retreated into the isolation of their highland villages, mistrustful of and hostile to outsiders, a condition that in large measure persists to this day.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, another tropical agricultural commodity  bananas  joined coffee as a pillar of the Guatemalan economy. Unlike coffee, the banana business was dominated by foreign firms, chief among them the United Fruit Company (UFCo). Though coffee remained the countrys primary export, UFCo, through its control of railroads, ports, and company stores, controlled about 40% of the economy by the 1930s. By 1934, UFCo also held more than 3.5 million acres of land, of which 115,000 were under cultivation.\n\nJust as Justo Rufino Barrios had championed the interests of coffee cultivators, his godson Jorge Ubico became closely associated with the interests of both coffee planters and the United Fruit Companys banana empire. An admirer of Napoleon, he seized power in 1930, then quickly moved to consolidate his dictatorship. He reinforced the army, placing a former U.S. military attach� (whom he designated brigadier-general) in charge of the Escuela Polit�cnica military academy. He forced members of the Supreme Court to resign, then stacked the Court with political cronies. In the countryside, he replaced elected mayors (alcaldes) with town managers (intendentes) answerable to himself. When faced with the constitutional prohibition against reelection in 1936, he staged a referendum to remain in office.\n\nUbicos Vagrancy Law required all landless peasants to work for an employer at least 150 days a year; those with some land only had to put in 100 days. That ensured that most Amerindians and rural ladinos would have to work on plantations for more than three months, providing a steady supply of cheap labor for the harvest. To further enhance the authority of the planters, a 1943 law gave them the right to shoot poachers or anyone else intruding on their lands.\n\nUbico singled out the United Fruit Company for favored treatment. In 1936, he granted it a 99-year contract for a Pacific coast plantation, exempting the company from taxation and import duties, and guaranteeing low wages. To head off demands for higher wages elsewhere in the economy, Ubico set an upper limit of 50 cents a day on wages at UFCo. With a government-mandated ceiling on wages, and with a government-sanctioned monopoly on all transportation to the Atlantic coast, and on all shipping out of the only port on that coast, UFCo was able to set prices arbitrarily, guaranteeing handsome profits.\n\nBy the 1940s, however, events elsewhere in the world would help doom the Ubico regime. The Great Depression had led to Franklin Roosevelts New Deal in the United States; in neighboring Mexico, President L�zaro C�rdenas had nationalized the oil industry and launched a sweeping land reform. Then came the Second World War, and the crusade against fascism. By 1944, with Nazi Germany on the verge of defeat, Ubicos authoritarian rule seemed out of step with the times. Student-initiated protests gained support from respected businessmen and professionals, then from army cadets and the military Honor Guard. Ubico fled the country, to be replaced by a revolutionary junta consisting of Captain Jacobo Arbenz, commander of the cadets; Major Francisco Arana , commander of the Honor Guard; and a civilian. The junta held an election and transferred authority to the countrys first freely-elected President.\n\nIII. Guatemalan Politics Since the Election of 1944\n\nThe new President, Juan Jos� Ar�valo, was a university professor and admirer of Franklin Roosevelt who sought to implement a Guatemalan version of the New Deal. His reforms were far-reaching. The 1945 Constitution reinstated the ban on reelection, and mandated an apolitical military. All Guatemalans were granted freedom of association, including the right to form free labor unions. Literate women were given the right to vote. Political parties (with the exception of Communists and other \"foreign or international\" parties) could form and contest elections freely, ending seventy years of Liberal dictatorship. The Constitution granted the University of San Carlos administrative autonomy, with a guaranteed two percent share of the national budget. In April 1946, Ar�valo won passage of a Social Security Law, and in 1947, a new Labor Code. The latter established the right to strike and to collective bargaining, set minimum wages, and restricted child labor. By the end of Ar�valos term in 1950, urban wages had risen 80%. Ar�valo also repealed Ubicos Vagrancy Law.\n\nColonel Jacobo Arbenz, who had served as Ar�valos secretary of defense, won the 1950 presidential election with 63% of the vote in a three-way race. Arbenz tried to extend the revolution of 1944 to the countryside. Rather than nationalize UFCo monopolies, he sought to introduce competition. He began building a highway to the Atlantic and a new port to end UFCos monopolies on transportation and shipping. Then, in 1952, he promulgated an Agrarian Reform Law intended to create a rural middle class of freeholders. Decree 900 provided for expropriation of idle landholdings, with compensation based on the owners self-declared valuations as filed for the 1950 tax assessment. Farms smaller than 219 acres were exempt, as were those between 219 and 488 acres in which three-quarters of the land was under cultivation. By June 1954, about 100,000 families (comprising half a million persons out of a population of three million) had obtained lands of their own. That reduced the supply of labor for the plantations, forcing rural wages above a dollar a day.\n\nThese changes did not sit well with coffee planters and the United Fruit Company. Besides the higher wages, UFCos management was infuriated by the expropriation of 209,842 acres of unused banana plantations, and by the $3/acre offered by the Guatemalan Government. Though the figure was based on the companys own stated valuations (for tax purposes), and though it had paid half that amount to acquire the land twenty years earlier, the U.S. State Department demanded $75 an acre. Possibly influencing the U.S. position was the fact that Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had previously served as an attorney for UFCo, preparing the companys contracts with the Guatemalan Government during the 1930s.\n\nDenouncing the administration as Communist-dominated, President Eisenhower authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), run by Allen Dulles, brother of the Secretary of State and another former UFCo attorney, to proceed with covert actions against the Guatemalan Government. Though no Communist held any cabinet post, and the Guatemalan Communist Party (Partido Guatemalteco de los Trabajadores, PGT ) never held more than 5 of 58 seats in Congress, Arbenz fell into a public-relations trap when he purchased arms from Communist Czechoslovakia in an effort to circumvent a U.S.-imposed arms embargo. In June 1954, planes flown by CIA operatives began bombing and strafing military installations, fuel depots, and the presidential palace, while mercenaries led by former army Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas invaded from Honduras. On June 27, Arbenz resigned on the basis of a promise to preserve the gains of the Guatemalan revolution, and flew off into Mexican exile.\n\nInstalled in the presidency by the United States, Castillo Armas returned lands expropriated under Decree 900 to their former owners, including UFCo. He outlawed all political parties except his own National Liberation Movement (Movimiento de Liberaci�n Nacional, MLN). He banned labor unions and peasant confederations, and restored Ubicos secret police chief. He decreed a Preventive Penal Law against Communism, providing for arbitrary arrest for up to six months of those designated as \"Communists.\" Though the Guatemalan Communist Party had peaked at a membership of 4,000, the regime branded 72,000 citizens as \"Communists,\" with no right of appeal.\n\nCol. Castillo Armas was assassinated in 1957, and succeeded by Gen. Miguel Yd�goras Fuentes, who had developed a reputation for cruelty as enforcer of Ubicos Vagrancy Law. In 1963, to head off another presidential bid by Juan Jos� Ar�valo, the army took over, blocking Ar�valos return from exile. The new head of state, Col. Enrique Peralta Azurdia, formed a new center-right party  the Institutional Democratic Party (Partido Institucional Democr�tica, PID)  modeled on Mexicos ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. He also rewrote the Constitution, inserting a requirement that any new political party must first submit a list of 50,000 members. By questioning the validity of signatures, the Government was able to arbitrarily decide which parties could participate in elections, a power used over the next couple of decades to exclude center-left reformist parties. That kept not only Ar�valo, but even Christian Democrats, off the ballot.\n\nBesides the center-right PID and rightist MLN, only the centrist Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario, PR) was allowed to take part in the 1966 election. Even so, its presidential candidate, Julio C�sar M�ndez Montenegro, won a plurality of the vote. As a condition to being allowed to take office, however, the army made M�ndez Montenegro pledge not to interfere in its affairs. In a context of tension resulting from the emergence of small guerrilla groups that kidnapped Government officials and politicians, the army took advantage of its autonomy to launch two fateful initiatives. One was a Cold War counter-insurgency campaign, advised and financed by the United States, that killed thousands of peasants in an effort to end civilian support for several hundred guerrillas. The other was the formation of death squads such as Mano Blanca (White Hand) in the cities, openly sponsored by MLN leader Mario Sandoval Alarc�n, and widely believed to be covertly organized by the armed forces. Among the death squads primary targets were students and professors at the University of San Carlos, and labor lawyers and activists. With the Defense Minister able to declare states of siege at will, President M�ndez Montenegro was reduced to a figurehead, helpless to limit the countrys slide towards violence and impunity.\n\nIn 1970 the pretense of civilian government disappeared altogether. M�ndez Montenegro was succeeded as President by Col. Carlos Arana Osorio, commander of the counter-insurgency campaign. Announcing \"there will be no halfway measures against subversion in my Government,\" Arana declared a state of siege. By March 1971, there had been more than 700 political killings in the country, including those of nationalist politician and lawyer Alfonso Bauer Pa�z and labor leader Jaime Monge Don�s. Though elected with support from both the PID and the MLN, Arana consolidated military control of the death squads. With the killing of the MLN President of Congress, reputed to be a director of the MLN-linked Mano Blanca, that group faded out, and was replaced by a group of new death squads more directly controlled by the army.\n\nFor the 1974 presidential election, the military-linked PID chose Aranas Chief of Staff, Gen. Kjell Laugerud, as its candidate. To hold onto MLN support, it offered Mario Sandoval Alarc�n the vice-presidency. Bowing to the reality of military control, the centrist Christian Democratic Party of Guatemala (Partido Dem�crata Cristiano de Guatemala, PDCG) countered by nominating Gen. Efra�n R�os Montt, an officer they considered more honest and trustworthy than the rest. With the more reform-oriented parties  Villagr�n Kramers Democratic Revolutionary Unity (Unidad Revolucionaria Democr�tica, URD) and the United Revolutionary Front (Frente Unido Revolucionario, FUR), led by popular Guatemala City mayor Manuel Colom Argueta  prohibited from taking part in the elections, these threw their support to R�os Montt under the umbrella of the National Opposition Front (Frente Nacional Opositora, FNO). When early returns showed the FNO leading two-to-one, the Government delayed the count, then announced that Kjell Laugerud had won by a thin margin. The fraud was consummated when Arana persuaded R�os Montt to accept a diplomatic assignment in Spain.\n\nGen. Laugerud, who was more of a technocrat than a cold warrior, reduced the level of repression. Forming an alliance with the Christian Democrats, he cut off relations with the MLN altogether, and split with his patron Arana. A raid on the home of an Arana associate uncovered a cache of arms and uniforms presumed to have been used by a death squad. In the Mayan highlands, Laugerud supported the development of cooperatives organized by the Christian Democrats and the FUR.\n\nIn the wake of the 1976 earthquake, however, this relaxation enabled peasants who had already benefited from the cooperative movement to form independent organizations that began to challenge the rural power structure centered on rural land barons and military commissioners. On its left fringe, this effervescence led to formation of a new guerrilla group, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (Ej�rcito Guerrillero de los Pobres, EGP). Under pressure from army commanders, Laugerud terminated his alliance with the Christian Democrats, and allowed the army to intensify repression in rural areas. In response, President Jimmy Carter persuaded Congress to cut off military aid and credit to Guatemala in 1977.\n\nGen. Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc�a, who had been Gen. Laugeruds Defense Minister, became President in 1978, following an election the Washington Post described as \"a fraud so transparent that nobody could expect to get away with it.\" Continuing their tacit alliance with segments of the military, the Christian Democrats had nominated Col. Peralta M�ndez. Lucas had countered by seeking a civilian Vice-President. After being turned down by Manuel Colom Argueta and possibly Alberto Fuentes Mohr, he settled on Francisco Villagr�n Kramer, head of the Democratic Revolutionary Unity (Unidad Revolucionaria Democr�tica, URD).\n\nShortly after Gen. Lucas assumed the presidency, a new death squad was born. Run out of the national palace itself, the Secret Anti-Communist Army (Ej�rcito Secreto Anticomunista, ESA), spearheaded a campaign of terror against labor unions, universities, and opposition politicians that exceeded anything seen under Arana. Among the victims were leaders of two opposition parties. Alberto Fuentes Mohr, founder and leader of the Social Democratic Party (Partido Social Dem�crata, PSD), was killed on January 25, 1979, the day his party filed for formal recognition. Manuel Colom Argueta, a former mayor of Guatemala City and head of the United Front of the Revolution (Frente Unido de la Revoluci�n, FUR), was murdered by three carloads of armed men in plainclothes on March 22, 1979, only days after registering his party. Colom and Fuentes were expected to be presidential running mates in the 1982 election.\n\nSo severe was the repression that even Gen. Lucas Garc�as running mate could no longer tolerate it. On September 1, 1980, Vice-President Francisco Villagr�n Kramer resigned and fled to the United States, saying that \"death or exile is the fate of those who fight for justice in Guatemala.\" By 1981, virtually all that remained of the organized democratic opposition were the Christian Democrats. In August, party leader Vinicio Cerezo reported that 120 Christian Democrats had been murdered since September 1980, and withdrew all the partys deputies from Congress.\n\nThough Gen. Lucas succeeded in virtually destroying the democratic opposition, he was ultimately trumped from where he least expected it  dissident elements of the armed forces themselves. When he sought to impose the by now routine transfer of power to his Defense Minister in the 1982 election, Gen. Efra�n R�os Montt, still smarting from the fraud that denied him the presidency in 1974, led a coup that removed Lucas from power. A broader motivation for the coup, however, was the concern of field commanders that Gen. Lucas corruption and indiscriminate slaughter were undermining the effort against the guerrillas, who were now more numerous and powerful than ever before.\n\nIronically, Gen. R�os Montt became best known for implementing a plan designed by Benedicto Lucas Garc�a, the former Presidents brother. Named Defense Minister in the waning days of the Lucas regime, Benedicto drew on his French military training to put together a counter-insurgency plan modeled on the French experiences in Vietnam and Algeria. The idea was to force peasants to abandon their traditional villages for centralized and fortified towns where the army could maintain secure control. In practice, that entailed burning down entire villages, often massacring many or all of the civilian inhabitants. As a result of the slaughter, 200,000 refugees had fled to Mexico by the end of 1982, and somewhere between 300,000 and a million peasants had either gone into hiding in the mountains or swelled the ranks of the homeless in Guatemala City. This mass exodus led to worldwide protests, including an August 1982 condemnation by the United Nations.\n\nAs part of his strategy, Gen. R�os Montt also expanded the armys presence in rural areas, increasing the number of military zones from nine to 22, one for each of the countrys 22 departments. Completing the militarization of the Guatemalan highlands, R�os Montt also removed 324 village mayors, substituting his own appointees, and required that all men participate in civil patrols (Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil, PACs).\n\nTo rebuild a base of support, however, R�os Montt moderated repression in some key aspects. He curtailed the activity of urban death squads, which had already decimated the democratic opposition. Labeling his counter-insurgency program frijoles y fusiles (beans and rifles), he provided food to peasants relocated to strategic towns, and had the army launch numerous other \"civic action\" programs. For these reasons, he has maintained a strong base of support among some Guatemalans.\n\nTo open up a largely closed political system that had earlier denied him the presidency he had won at the polls, R�os Montt also launched an overhaul of the electoral law. The number of signatures required to register a political party dropped from 50,000 to 4,000, making it virtually impossible for the Government to continue excluding center-left parties from the ballot.\n\nYet R�os Montts flamboyant evangelism created fissures among Guatemalan civil and military elites. In 1978, he had converted from Catholicism to El Verbo, a fundamentalist Protestant church affiliated with the Gospel Outreach Church of Eureka, California. As President, R�os Montt encouraged the spread of Protestant missionaries throughout the country, causing resentment among Catholics. On August 8, 1983, Defense Minister Gen. Oscar Humberto Mej�a V�ctores, backed by the military, ousted Gen. R�os Montt, and assumed the presidency.\n\nConvinced that a return to civilian rule was essential to improving Guatemalas international image and undermining the credibility of guerrilla forces, Gen. Mej�a V�ctores held an election in July 1984  under the new electoral law prepared under Gen. R�os Montt  for a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution. The Constitution was promulgated in 1985, and was followed by a presidential election free of the fraud that had marred previous\n\nelections.\n\nIn 1986, Christian Democrat Vinicio Cerezo became Guatemalas first civilian President since 1970. Having won a sweeping 70% of the vote, Cerezo was widely perceived as having a mandate to carry out the new constitutional provisions, the most important of which was to subordinate the army to civilian control.\n\nAs it had earlier done with M�ndez Montenegro, however, the army sought to tie the President-Elects hands. Four days before Cerezos inauguration, it promulgated an amnesty decree barring prosecution of members of the armed forces and police for prior violations of human rights. Not only did Cerezo make no effort to challenge the decree, he took no action to end impunity for violations of human rights committed by the army and police subsequent to his assumption of the presidency. Furthermore, he allowed the police, which are constitutionally supposed to answer to the Ministry of the Interior, to be run by an army officer, effectively subordinating the nominally civilian police to the army.\n\nCerezo was succeeded in January 1991 by Jorge Serrano El�as, a political crony of Gen. Efra�n R�os Montt, and leader of the Solidarity Action Movement (Movimiento de Acci�n Solidaria, MAS). Though Serrano beat Jorge Carpio Nicolle of the center-right Union of the National Center (Uni�n del Centro Nacional, UCN) decisively in the presidential run-off election, the MAS lost the congressional elections just as decisively. Center and center-right parties dominated, with the UCN taking 41 of 116 seats, the PDCG taking 27, and the National Advancement Party (Partido de Avanzada Nacional, PAN) taking another 12, while MAS was limited to 18 seats.\n\nThe one bright spot in the Serrano administration was the appointment of Acisclo Valladares as Attorney General. Valladares was the first Guatemalan official to attempt vigorous prosecutions of human rights offenses. Yet before his initiatives could have any effect, he was removed from office on allegations of corruption  allegations later proved false in court. Like Cerezo, Serrano allowed the police to remain under control of the military, in defiance of the constitutional requirement that the police be subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nUnable to control Congress, Serrano tried to assume dictatorial powers. On May 25, 1993, Serrano ordered the dissolution of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the Court of Constitutionality. The Court of Constitutionality, presided over by Epaminondas Gonz�lez Dub�n, responded immediately, declaring Serranos action unconstitutional. Human Rights Ombudsman Ramiro de Le�n Carpio likewise denounced the new regime as unconstitutional. The Organization of American States (OAS) called for the restoration of constitutional rule, as did the Clinton administration, which suspended security and economic assistance, and threatened economic sanctions. After losing the support of the army, Serrano resigned on June 1. Four days later, Congress chose a new President, former Human Rights Ombudsman Ramiro de Le�n Carpio.\n\nAs expected, de Le�n Carpio made a series of bold moves early in his presidency to try to limit impunity for human rights violations by the army and the police. On August 5, he ordered the closing of the Presidential Security Directorate, an infamous intelligence unit more commonly known as Archivos (literally \"The Files\"), which had previously prepared hit lists for government-sanctioned death squads. Unlike his predecessors, he also tried to wrest control of the police from the army. His new national police chief, Mario Ren� Cifuentes, dismissed military advisers, terminated the joint army-police task force HUNAPU, and prepared to launch a new unit to investigate human rights violations. Yet by early 1994, the military had forced the dismissal of both the police chief and the interior minister, effectively canceling the reforms.\n\nOnly in the waning days of his administration did de Le�n Carpio attempt one further reform. On September 15, 1995, he announced his intent to terminate the system of military commissioners through which the army maintained control over civilians in rural Guatemala. A week later, Congress made the dissolution formal.\n\nOn November 12, 1995, Guatemalans went to the polls to elect a new President, mayors, and Congress. The elections were clean, but hampered by the residual effects of fear and a widespread sense of the futility of elections in a country in which the military remained unaccountable to elected authorities. Less than half of the registered voters (47%) cast ballots.\n\nThere were, nonetheless, important results. In a stunning advance over its weak showing in 1990, the PAN won an absolute majority in Congress, taking 43 of 80 seats. The largest opposition party, Gen. R�os Montts Guatemalan Republican Front (Frente Republicano Guatemalteco, FRG), won less than half that amount  21 seats. Just as important, the newly-formed New Guatemala Democratic Front (Frente Democr�tico Nueva Guatemala, FDNG) won six seats, restoring a degree of representation to the center-left after decades of persecution. Three of the FDNG representatives were leaders of human rights groups: Nineth Montenegro was president of the Mutual Support Group (Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo, GAM), an organization of relatives of the disappeared; Am�lcar M�ndez was director of the Runujel Junam Council of Ethnic Communities (CERJ), derived from the phrase \"all are equal\" in the Quich� language; Rosalina Tuyuc was president of CONAVIGUA, the National Coordinating Committee of Guatemalan Widows (Coordinadora Nacional de Viudas Guatemaltecas).\n\nPAN candidate Alvaro Arz� Irigoyen, who failed to win an absolute majority in the first round of the presidential election, won the January 7th runoff with 51.2% of the vote. In his inaugural address on January 14, he vowed to \"fight impunity head on.\" Five days later, on January 19, Arz� removed eight of the countrys sixteen generals, as well as two notorious colonels linked to killings involving U.S. citizens. On January 26, he dismissed 118 police officers linked to criminal acts, including 85 precinct commanders. In February, he became the first Guatemalan President to meet with the guerrilla leadership. In September, Arz� dismissed another nine senior military officers, including two more generals, and signed an agreement to reduce the size and power of the military. On December 29, a final peace treaty was signed in Guatemala City, formally ending the country's 35-year civil war.\n\nIV. Structure of Government\n\nThe Constitution of 1985 defines the Government of Guatemala as a representative democracy. Elections are held every four years for a President and unicameral Congress. Because of past experience with dictatorships masked by staged or fraudulent elections, the Constitution limits Presidents to a single term. Should a President refuse to leave office at the conclusion of the term, control of the military passes to Congress. To forestall a return to military rule, the Constitution also prohibits the candidacy of anyone who has served as an officer within the past five years, or who has taken part in a coup, or led an armed insurrection. Underscoring the importance of the provisions against reelection and against allowing those who resort to arms to attain the presidency, the Constitution bars any amendments to the articles in question.\n\nThe president and vice-president are elected by an absolute majority of votes cast. Should no ticket achieve such a majority in the first round, a runoff is held among the top two contenders. The President appoints all ministers. Together with the Vice-President, these comprise the Cabinet (Consejo de Ministros), which is headed by the President. In principle, the President is also Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, although not until the presidency of Alvaro Arz� Irigoyen (1996) was any serious effort made to assert this authority in practice.\n\nThe Congress of the Republic (Congreso de la Rep�blica) consists of 80 deputies, 64 of whom are elected by plurality from single-member districts, and 16 elected nationwide by party list, in proportion to the vote received by each party. Unlike the President, legislators may be reelected. A Permanent Commission attends to pressing business during congressional recesses.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Justice consists of thirteen justices (magistrados), who serve five-year terms, and may likewise be returned to office. Members of the court are chosen by Congress from lists prepared by university presidents, law school deans, the bar association, and judges. The Supreme Court, which oversees all the nations courts, is guaranteed two percent of the national budget, and appoints all other judges.\n\nIn principle, though not yet fully in practice, the Constitution sets an elaborate set of checks and balances on arbitrary rule. Laws may be proposed not only by the president and by Congress, but, in their respective areas of competence, by the Supreme Court, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and the University of San Carlos. The President may veto acts of Congress, and Congress may override the veto by a vote of two-thirds of its total membership. Constitutional laws, such as the electoral law and the law of constitutional protection (amparo), can only be modified by a vote of two-thirds of all deputies. Amparo entitles any individual whose constitutional rights are threatened to sue for the \"protection\" of the courts, or where violations have already occurred, to sue for redress.\n\nCongress may compel ministers to appear before it to answer questions. If dissatisfied with a ministers performance, an absolute majority of deputies can so indicate with a vote of no confidence. The minister must then offer to resign. If the President does not accept the resignation, a vote of two-thirds of the deputies dismisses the minister.\n\nThe Supreme Court may also find specific actions of the Executive Branch, or particular applications of laws, unconstitutional. But rulings on the constitutionality of laws themselves are reserved for the Constitutional Court (Corte de Constitucionalidad). The Court consists of five magistrates, who serve five-year terms, and are chosen respectively by the President, Congress, the Supreme Court, the national bar association, and the University of San Carlos.\n\nAnother innovation in the Constitution of 1985 was the establishment of the Human Rights Ombudsman (Procurador de Derechos Humanos). The Ombudsman is chosen by Congress from a list of three candidates submitted by the Human Rights Commission, which is made up of one deputy from each of the political parties represented in Congress. The Ombudsman holds office for a five-year term. Any citizen may submit a complaint to the Ombudsmans office. The Ombudsmans authority, however, is limited to investigating complaints and recommending a course of action to other branches and agencies of the Government.\n\nRegional government is tightly controlled from Guatemala City, while municipalities are allowed some degree of autonomy. Each of the countrys 22 departments is run by a governor appointed by the President. Municipalities, on the other hand, are governed by councils consisting of a mayor (alcalde), councilors (concejales), and trustees (s�ndicos), elected for four-year terms, with reelection allowed. Taxes are levied by the national government, but the Constitution reserves ten percent of the national budget for municipalities.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges facing Guatemalas civil authorities is to enforce the constitutional provisions subjecting the military to civilian control. Though working in the context of military rule, the Constituent Assembly nonetheless sought to legislate military rule out of existence. To that end, the Constitution not only prohibits active-duty military personnel from voting and from holding public office, but bars even officers who have retired in the past five years from seeking the presidency, and prohibits those who have taken part in coups from ever running for the presidency. This last provision was tested in 1993 when Vice President Gustavo Espina tried unsuccessfully to succeed Jorge Serrano following the latters failed \"self-coup,\" which Espina had backed. The provision was again tested in 1995, when retired Gen. Efra�n R�os Montt, who had led the 1982 coup, tried to run for President. In both cases, the Constitutional Court ruled they could not.\n\nThough the army is still authorized to maintain \"internal\" as well as \"external\" security, it is admonished to remain \"apolitical,\" and to stay within the bounds of the Constitution. Not once, but twice, the Constitution emphasizes that the President is Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The President is also responsible for military promotions. In a provision aimed at terminating military-sponsored death squads, the Constitution prohibits the formation of armed groups not regulated by law. It also stipulates that no civil or military functionary is obligated to carry out illegal orders, and that no civilian may be judged by a military court.\n\nV. Constitutional Guarantees\n\nIn general, there is a wide gap between the generous guarantees of human rights set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and actual practice, though there have been some advances over the past decade, and the initiatives of the current administration of President Alvaro Arz� Irigoyen reflect a determination to effect far-reaching improvements.\n\nArticle 1 of the Constitution commits the state to \"protecting the person and the family.\" Article 2 says \"it is the duty of the State to guarantee to the inhabitants of the Republic life, liberty, justice, security, peace, and full personal development.\" Article 3 then establishes a right to life, originating from conception, not birth. Abortions are illegal, and the death penalty is prohibited for women, for men under 18 or over 60, or for political prisoners (including those convicted of committing common crimes in a political context). In July 1995, the legislature amended the Penal Code, extending the circumstances under which the death penalty could be imposed for kidnapping. In so doing, it may have violated the American Convention on Human Rights, a treaty previously ratified by Guatemala, which specifies that the death penalty \"shall not be extended to crimes to which it does not presently apply.\"\n\nIn practice, the right to life is frequently violated by death squads that in the past operated under direct military command, and may still have clandestine links to army intelligence. As late as July 1996, the UN Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) reported that:\n\nThe right to life continues to be seriously undermined. The enjoyment of this right is more difficult because agents of the State and persons or groups linked to them are known to be perpetrators of civilian homicides and the institutions involved are not carrying out proper investigations.\n\nBy January 1997, following the end of the guerrilla war, MINUGUA was able to offer a more upbeat, though still cautious assessment:\n\nIn particular, a trend was observed for the greater respect on the part of agents of the state for a number of the human rights given priority under the Agreement, including the right to life....Nevertheless, the enjoyment of human rights by the\n\npopulation as a whole is still precarious, and Government efforts against crime and impunity have achieved only partial results.\n\nArticle 3 also mandates respect for \"the integrity and security of the person,\" language intended to prohibit torture, the use of which is explicitly forbidden against prisoners. Yet, at least until very recently, the army has continued to rely on torture to extract information from suspected subversives. According to the U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1995, \"many bodies were found in various parts of the country bearing signs of severe disfigurement or mutilation.\" The police also resort to torture in order to force the confessions that serve as a substitute for inadequate means of criminal investigation. \"To control violence requires a police system of professional investigations and good equipment,\" President Alvaro Arz� told the Washington Post in June 1996. \"We dont have it.\" Common methods of torture include beatings, druggings, incisions with knives, cigarette burns, and electric shocks. The most notorious method  the capucha (hood or garotte)  is routinely used by both the army and the police against suspected subversives. In the words of a police detective:\n\nThe capucha is a hood made of rubber, which has a kind of tie at the end which goes behind it. You put the hood over the person, down to his neck, and you tighten the strings so no air can enter. Before, you blindfold the person and you tie his hands and ankles from behind, and you put him face down and then someone strong steps on his lungs while another holds his feet, and another his head. Then the strong guy starts \"rowing\" the persons body while another is tightening the hood. What happens? He starts losing consciousness from lack of oxygen. And when he is just about to faint, they jump on him to bring him to or they throw cold water on his face, and slap him. They take off the hood and interrogate him. They say \"Are you going to tell the truth?\" and \"Who is so and so?\" If he doesnt know anything, they put the hood back on until he feels obligated to say something, or else he is very macho and doesnt speak, or to save his life, he invents just about anything. Thats when it really gets started: torture. A lot of people cant take it. They die, and thats when they throw them on the roadsides about ten kilometers from the city. Thats why you often see people with their hands tied behind them, blindfolded; they were the ones who couldnt withstand the hood. There are sessions that last an afternoon, a day, a week, a month, depending on the seriousness of the alleged crime. Everything happens as easily as the way I am describing it.\n\nA common variation in the use of the hood is to spike it with insecticide, as described by a soldier:\n\nWe give them the hood with Gamez�n (insecticide) and they let it all out, against their will Its effective. The hood makes your eyes burn, you feel asphyxiated. We put insecticide inside. It burns your nose, you cant take it, you feel almost dead We give them the hood and they let it all out, even against their will. They tell the truth in the middle of torture.\n\nIn November 1995, the United Nations Committee Against Torture expressed its deep concern that torture remains endemic in Guatemala, and that the authorities were not taking prompt and effective action against those responsible.\n\nBy law, arrests and searches of a home may be made only with a warrant issued by a judge based on probable cause. The only exception is when someone is apprehended in the act of committing a crime; even then, that person must be brought before a judge within six hours. The clandestine detention centers that, at least until recently, were routinely used by the army and police to interrogate, torture, and kill \"subversives\" are explicitly prohibited, and the Constitution says that authorities who violate this precept will be held personally accountable. To date, however, no one has been charged with any such infraction. Moreover, in January 1997, MINUGUA reported \"an increase in the number of verified cases of illegal detention attributed to the National Police and the Treasury Police.\"\n\nPersons placed under arrest must immediately be told why they are being detained, and apprised of their rights to have an attorney present. In practice, however, most Guatemalans cannot afford legal counsel, and public defenders are usually too poorly trained and\n\noverburdened by heavy caseloads to offer effective defense for their clients. Interrogations may only be conducted by judicial authorities. Confessions obtained from extrajudicial interrogations may not be submitted as evidence in a court of law. In all cases, the accused must be presumed innocent. The Constitution also provides for the right of habeas corpus, and the right to protection (amparo) from any other infringement of constitutional rights by the authorities. According to the U.S. Department of State, however, \"most accounts agree that the security forces routinely ignore writs of habeas corpus in cases of illegal detention.\"\n\nThe Constitution mandates the inviolability of correspondence and private documents. Yet, according to the U.S. Department of State, \"the authorities regularly disregard these provisions. Elements of the security forces continue to monitor private communications.\" In March 1993, for instance, a secret office of Archivos (the inter-agency intelligence unit discussed in Section VIII) was discovered in the main post office in Guatemala City, where it had been used to intercept mail.\n\nGuatemalans are guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of the media, including the press. The Constitution also provides for freedom of association, the right of petition, and the right of peaceful assembly. All these rights, however, have, at least until recently, been under assault from death squads linked to the military and to political extremists, who have had long-established patterns of murdering journalists, politicians, professors, students, trade unionists, clergy, catechists, and others who they perceive as threatening their interests. Though Guatemalas recent civilian Presidents have not sanctioned the actions of the death squads, they have not made a concerted effort to arrest and prosecute their organizers. That has in turn fostered a culture of impunity that perpetuates the violation of the most basic human rights of Guatemalas citizens.\n\nAccording to MINUGUA:\n\nIn the current situation of impunity, the majority of serious crimes and human rights violations go unpunished. This is not because it is impossible to determine what has happened or to identify the perpetrators; it is due to the inefficiency of the national bodies responsible for investigation, judgment, and punishment, as well as the influence certain groups, mostly those connected with the State, have upon those bodies State officials or persons close to them take advantage of their State connections, not only to commit crimes and human rights violations, but also to impede their investigation and evade punishment.\n\nA related problem is the widespread availability of guns. Article 38 of the Guatemalan Constitution goes well beyond the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, by establishing a right to bear arms both in the home and on ones person. With citizens holding hundreds of thousands of guns (almost none of which are registered), many of which are worn concealed under their clothing, and with effective impunity for their use, it is not hard to understand why Guatemala has one of the highest homicide rates in the hemisphere. In 1992, there were 34 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, compared with 10 in the United States and Panama, and 5 in Costa Rica.\n\nIn the social and economic domain, Guatemalans have rights to health, \"ecological equilibrium,\" social security, and education. The State provides subsidies to religious schools. It also guarantees the autonomy of the University of San Carlos, the countrys only public university, which is reserved two percent of the national budget.\n\nEmployees have a \"right to conditions that guarantee\" their families \"a dignified existence.\" These conditions include a minimum wage (currently just under $3 a day), an 8 hour work-day and a 44 hour work-week, and prohibition of child labor (under age 14). According to the U.S. Department of State:\n\nThe minimum wage is not sufficient to provide even a minimum standard of living for a worker and family. An estimated 80 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, including approximately 60 percent of those employed.\n\nWages must be paid in cash, except in the case of agricultural workers, where, with their consent, no more than 30% may be paid in food, provided the food is valued at no more than cost. Though employers are required to pay migrant workers their wages in full, this provision is flagrantly violated by plantation owners who fail to pay minimum wage, and by a judicial system that seldom seeks compliance. Any employee who is dismissed without just cause must be given a months severance pay for each year of employment. Employees have a right to equal pay for equal work, and employers may not make distinctions between single and married women.\n\nWorkers have the right to form free labor unions, and cannot be dismissed from their jobs for joining a union. Unions may go on strike, but only to achieve socio-economic  not political  aims. However, as pointed out in the State Departments Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1995:\n\n...Labor code procedures make legal strikes cumbersome. Labor organizers criticize the requirement that two-thirds of the workers must approve a vote to strike, the prohibition of strikes by agricultural workers at harvest time, and the right of the Government to prohibit strikes which it considers seriously harmful to the national economy. A strike by employees of La Aurora Zoo in April [1995] was the first legally authorized strike in 25 years lack of legal approval for a strike can be used as a threat against strikers. Workers can be suspended or fired for failing to show up for work if a strike has not been legally approved.\n\nAs discussed in Section XI, Groups at Risk, trade unionists and labor lawyers have been frequent targets of death squads linked to the countrys security forces, in effect undermining the right to organize.\n\nAs a matter of law, though not necessarily in practice, wherever Guatemala has ratified international treaties, such as conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO), and where the provisions protecting workers exceed those in Guatemalan law, the international provisions take precedence. Guatemala has ratified both ILO Convention 87, on freedom of association, and ILO Convention 98, on the right to collective bargaining.\n\nThough the Constitution provides for states of exception, these are severely restricted in order to avoid having them become a justification for the curtailment of basic human rights. Confronting the legacy of a long history of often brutal military rule, the Constituent Assembly prohibited suspension of most human rights under any circumstances. The right to life and to physical integrity can never be validly abridged. The only rights subject to suspension in an emergency are the freedoms of speech, movement, and peaceful assembly, freedom from arrest without a warrant, the right to be interrogated only by judicial authorities, the right to bear arms, and the right of public employees to go on strike. The President may suspend any of these rights by decree, specifying the rights and locations affected, but must submit the decree to Congress within three days for review. Even if confirmed by Congress, no decree can be in effect for more than 30 days.\n\nThe Human Rights Ombudsman, moreover, is required to defend all underogable rights under a state of exception. Instruction about the Constitution and human rights is made a mandatory part of the curriculum, and popular resistance to violations of human rights is declared legitimate. And though Article 204 states that the Constitution prevails over ordinary laws and international treaties in other respects, Article 46 states that where human rights are concerned, international treaties ratified by Guatemala take precedence over domestic law. That effectively incorporates the content of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the American Convention on Human Rights, into domestic jurisprudence. Guatemala has also recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.\n\nVI. Cultural Factors - Ethnicity\n\nIn racial terms, the population of Guatemala is predominantly native American. About 55% of Guatemalans are Amerindian, and 42% are ladino (of mixed, but predominantly native origins). Only 3% are of predominantly European or (to a negligible degree) African origin. To downplay the size of the native population, however, the Guatemalan Government measures ethnicity primarily by language and dress, reflecting a more general pattern of discrimination:\n\nEthnic discrimination permeates Guatemalan society. To be an indio is to be dumb, lazy, crude, backward, and altogether less civilized in the stereotypical view of many ladinos. In fact, indio is a common term of insult in ladino society. Within the narrow bounds of indian communities, one can advance economically and socially while maintaining traditional dress and language. But to succeed in the dominant society, or even simply to get a decent job, an Indian is pressured to shed her or his cultural identity and assume ladino dress and behavioral patterns. For these reasons, low estimations of the indigenous population are sometimes questioned; and it is argued that without societal pressure and discrimination the numbers of self-identified indians would be greater.\n\nSince all ladinos speak Spanish, as does more than a third of the indigenous population, the linguistic balance tilts in favor of the dominant culture. About two-thirds (66%) of Guatemalans speak Spanish, with the remaining third speaking various Mayan languages.\n\nThere are four principal indigenous languages. Quich�, spoken by 13% of all Guatemalans, is concentrated in the departments of Quich�, Quetzaltenango, Solol�, Retalhuleu, and Totonicap�n. Cakchiquel,, spoken by 6% of Guatemalans, is heard in Antigua, and in the departments of Sacatep�quez, Chimaltenango, Solol�, and Guatemala. Mam, with 4%, is used in the departments of Huehuetenango, San Marcos, and Quetzaltenango. Kekch�, also at 4%, is distributed in the departments of Alta Verapaz, Izabal, and Pet�n. Another seventeen languages or dialects are spoken by the remaining 7% of the population. There are also two small populations that are neither European, Mayan nor ladino. About 10,000 Gar�funa, descended from African slaves and Carib Indians, inhabit the Caribbean coast, and some 500 Xinca live near the border with El Salvador.\n\nThough Guatemalas original inhabitants  and their languages  are often collectively described as Mayan, the various ethnic groups have little sense of common identity. The major languages are sufficiently distinct as to be unintelligible to \"Mayans\" who speak other languages. Furthermore, beginning with the Spanish conquest, each community developed a distinctive form\n\nof dress, or traje. The inhabitants of each native town distinguish themselves from the inhabitants of all other towns by the patterns in their brightly colored garments. \"In the eyes of our community,\" says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Mench�, \"the fact that anyone should even change the way they dress shows a lack of dignity. Anyone who doesnt dress as our grandfathers, our ancestors, dressed, is on the road to ruin.\" Between language and traje, indigenous peoples have remained highly segregated, limiting possibilities for ethnic unity and political clout.\n\nOnly in recent years have Mayans begun to overcome some of their differences, and to press for a more effective voice in the political life of the country. Ironically, the trend toward recognizing some degree of common identity originated in the severe repression of the 1980s. Mayans who remained in Guatemala received the same treatment from the security forces regardless of their specific ethnicity, while those who fled into Mexican exile intermingled and had to learn Spanish in order to communicate. The return of the refugees, with their language and organizational skills, and their sense of common purpose, has contributed to a growing movement for the recognition of Mayan cultural identity and for meaningful participation in government.\n\nOne sign of this movement is the formation, for the first time, of a pan-Mayan coalition  the Coordinating Council of Organizations of the Mayan People in Guatemala (COPMAGUA). Another is the increasing participation of Mayans in electoral politics. In the November 1995 general election, Mayan candidates won eight (10%) of 80 congressional seats and 40 (13%) of 297 mayoralties, a significantly greater proportion than ever before. Twenty-one of the new mayors were nominated by local civic committees instead of national political parties, a change made possible by electoral reform. These developments within Guatemala have been paralleled by recognition from abroad, as in the awarding of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize to Mayan human rights activist Rigoberta Mench�.\n\nThese emerging political realities, coupled with unfulfilled constitutional promises, are in tension with present reality. According to the U.S. Department of State, \"[a]lthough the Constitution accords indigenous people equal rights, in practice they have only minimal participation in decisions affecting their lands, culture, traditions, and allocation of natural\n\nresources.\" The Constitution, moreover, is in other ways discriminatory. It recognizes Spanish as the countrys only official language. The various Mayan languages are relegated to the nations \"cultural patrimony.\" Bilingual education is limited to regions of predominantly indigenous population  which, as of 1981, included the western highland departments of Totonicap�n (97%), Solol� (94%), Alta Verapaz (89%), Quich� (85%), Chimaltenango (80%), Huehuetenango (66%), Quetzaltenango (61%), Baja Verapaz (57%), and Suchitep�quez (56%).\n\nSince 1995, progress has been made in recognizing the changes that need to be made to the countrys legal structure to accord Mayans their due part in the political order. In March 1995, the Government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, URNG) signed the Agreement on the Identity and Rights of Indigenous People. The document acknowledges the historical damage suffered by indigenous peoples from the denial of rights, discrimination, exclusion from the judicial and political systems, and plundering of lands and natural resources  and affirms an \"urgent need to overcome it.\" It recognizes Mayan identity and the value of indigenous languages. It requires that \"all matters of direct interest to the indigenous people must be addressed by and with them,\" and specifies formation of consultative bodies. The agreement calls for legislation to recognize traditional forms of authority and adjudication at the municipal level, and to recognize collective rights to land and natural resources. It also commits the Government to amend the Constitution in several ways: to define the Guatemalan nation as multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual; to recognize the Mayan, Gar�funa, and Xinca peoples; to make all indigenous languages official; and to recognize indigenous forms of spirituality. According to MINUGUA, however, resistance to recognizing indigenous forms of spirituality continues to be strong:\n\nDuring the period [August 1996 - January 1997], the most serious violations of the rights recognized in the Agreement on Indigenous Rights were associated with the exercise of\n\nMayan spirituality. Accusations of witchcraft greeted the performance of traditional Mayan rites and triggered violent reactions against the physical and psychological integrity of the victims, as well as serious acts such as kidnapping, death threats, and even murder. There have also been collective trials and clashes between villages. Lastly, the Mission observed various ways in which access by priests and adherents of Mayan spirituality to their holy places was being obstructed by individuals and religious institutions, and even cases of destruction and vandalism. The Mission has received complaints from spiritual guides about the procedure for the issuance of credentials to Mayan priests, which they consider humiliating.\n\nOn March 5, 1996, the Guatemalan Congress ratified the International Labor Organizations convention on indigenous rights, which specifies that indigenous peoples have a right to live on their ancestral lands, and to be educated in their own languages.\n\nStill, differences in basic indicators between Mayans and ladinos underscore the extent of the challenge that lies ahead. Life expectancy among ladino men is 64; among Mayan men, 47. Nationwide, illiteracy is at a staggering 50%, reaching 77% among Mayans (90% among Mayan women). In 1989, according to official statistics, two-thirds of those who were employed in rural areas lived in extreme poverty. Ultimately, any attempt to deal with the problem of rural poverty must either come to grips with the contentious issue of access to land, or create large numbers of jobs through expansion of the industrial and service sectors of the economy.\n\nVII. Land Issues and their Political Implications\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the explosive issue of land ownership in Guatemala. One is the continuing importance of agriculture to the countrys economy. As of 1993, two-thirds of Guatemalas foreign exchange earnings came from the sale of agricultural commodities. Somewhere between a third and a half of the labor force works in agriculture.\n\nA second factor is the combination of high population density and shortage of arable land. Roughly eleven million people  most of them rural inhabitants  live in an area slightly\n\nsmaller than Tennessee. Only 12% of the mostly mountainous land surface is arable, and only a third of that is in permanent crops, with the remainder in pastures. Exacerbating the problem is a rapid rate of population growth, which was about 2.5% per year in 1995.\n\nA third factor is an archaic, inaccurate, and confusing system of land titling. Because the uncertainties and legal voids favor those who can afford to hire lawyers and bribe bureaucrats, army officers, and judges, powerful landholders are content to keep the system as it is, because it helps them gain title to lands they never bought. On the other end of the social spectrum, peasants who have little prospect of obtaining a title treat the land as an expendable resource, slashing and burning their way ever deeper into virgin rainforests. Guatemala loses 153,000 hectares (378,000 acres) of forest each year.\n\nSuperimposed on this is the ethnic factor. As elsewhere in the Americas, European settlers seized most of the lands originally held by indigenous peoples. In Guatemala, however, the indigenous peoples continued to be in the majority. The outcome is one of the most lop-sided distributions of land ownership in the Western Hemisphere. Two percent of farm owners  mostly of European extraction  hold about 72% of the precious arable land, and receive 90% of all farm credit. At the other end of the spectrum from these few latifundios (plantations or ranches) are about 550,000 minifundios averaging 4.6 acres apiece, which receive only 4% of all farm credit. Most rural Guatemalans dont own any land at all. The net effect is to reinforce positions of power and status little changed from colonial times.\n\nAgribusinesses and plantation owners justify the existing distribution of land by arguing that it promotes economies of scale and maximizes foreign exchange earnings needed to modernize the economy. They point out that large agricultural enterprises growing export crops can make efficient use of agricultural chemicals and machinery. Land reform, they argue, would pull land out of export agriculture into subsistence agriculture, starving the country of dollars for the purchase of imports. Moreover, without enough arable land to provide every family with a plot large enough to meet its basic needs, and with plots being subdivided among large numbers of children, the outcome would be economic ruin.\n\nAdvocates of the poor, however, counter that the present system results in abysmal living conditions for most Guatemalans, with no serious prospect for improvement. Though Guatemala ranks 85th in real GDP per capita ($3,400 in 1993) among 174 world nations, it places 112th in the Human Development Index (HDI), a combined measure of life expectancy, educational attainment, and income. Nowhere else in the Americas is the gap between these two indices even a quarter as great. In 1989, according to official government statistics, more than three of every four Guatemalans lived in poverty, more than one in ten children died before reaching the age of five, and more than a third of schoolchildren aged 5-9 were suffering from malnutrition.\n\nWere landless peasants to be employed in agriculture, or in newly-created industrial and service jobs, these grim demographics could be turned around. But there have been few meaningful development initiatives in rural Guatemala. According to Guatemalas Human Rights Ombudsman:\n\n[Guatemalas] development style allowed economic growth in some productive sectors and in the economy overall, while postponing the structural changes needed for this process to bring about the kind of national development that would benefit all Guatemalans. The result has been that the latifundio-minifundio dichotomy has become even more pronounced.\n\nA large proportion of rural employers, moreover, do not even pay their workers the legally-mandated minimum wage, which the U.S. Department of State describes as \"not sufficient to provide even a minimum standard of living for a worker and family.\" And the rural minimum wage has been declining in dollar equivalents, from $3.20/day in the early 1980s to $2.60/day in 1995. Emigrating to Guatemala City is no real answer, because the city is unable to provide employment for more than a fraction of the rural migrants who are already squatting in its cardboard and plastic slums.\n\nFacing these options, many if not most Guatemalan peasants would prefer to have their own land, even if it only ensured subsistence for their families. Indigenous peoples, moreover, value land not just as a commodity but as an essential component of their collective identity as a people. In Guatemala, maize (corn) is not just a staple food but a sacrament, the vital symbolic link between the earth, creation, and the human community. That is why Mayan organizations, peasant associations, the Catholic Church, and the URNG are all calling for land reform.\n\nGuatemalas civil war added another wrinkle to the problem. As part of the counter-insurgency strategy applied in the early 1980s, the army destroyed hundreds of settlements, forcing their occupants into internal or external exile. Taking advantage of the opportunity, other peasants  almost all with ties to the army through the civil self-defense patrols (Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil, PACs)  occupied the vacated lands. Some of these peasants then obtained titles to the lands through a legal provision that allows for transfer of title wherever the land has been voluntarily abandoned.\n\nBy any reasonable standard, however, the lands vacated by refugees could not be said to have been voluntarily abandoned. To persuade the refugees who fled to Mexico to return to Guatemala, the Government signed an accord in 1992 which committed it to remove squatters from lands owned by returning refugees, to assist refugees in asserting their prior claims against those issued subsequently to squatters, and where such efforts failed, to find land for them elsewhere. An unintended effect of this policy has been to pit one set of peasants against another, often leading to conflict.\n\nSince the arrival of the United Nations Mission (MINUGUA), there has also been an upsurge in land invasions on plantations whose owners have refused to pay their workers the legally-mandated minimum wage. Before MINUGUA, landowners would often respond to such takeovers with deadly force. Now, however, the risks are far less, and workers  primarily those organized by the National Indigenous and Peasant Coordinating Committee (Coordinadora Nacional Ind�gena y Campesina, CONIC)  have been occupying lands to demand either the back pay they are due or compensation in land.\n\nIn 1996, outraged plantation owners succeeded in lobbying Congress to incorporate stiff sanctions against land invaders into the penal code. Article 257 provides for two to six years imprisonment for \"aggravated usurpation,\" which it defines as occurring under one or more of the following conditions: a) when more than five persons take part; b) they occupy land for more than three days; c) the owners are forced to leave; d) there is violence, disorder, intimidation, disguise, or breach of confidence; or e) damage is done to buildings, crops, roads, or natural resources. The penalty is also applicable to those who encourage others to engage in such behavior.\n\nOn May 6, 1996, the Governments Peace Commission (Comisi�n por la Paz, COPAZ) and the URNG signed a long-awaited socio-economic and agrarian agreement. Its provisions include: 1) a commitment to decentralize decision-making, and transfer more resources to municipalities; 2) a recognition on the part of the Government that it has an \"undeniable obligation\" to correct social inequities, coupled with commitments to boost spending on health and education (relative to GDP) by 50% by the year 2000, raise literacy to 70%, and cut infant and maternal mortality in half by the same year; 3) creation of a national \"land bank\" to provide landless peasants with access to land and credit; and 4) the doubling of tax collections by the year 2000.\n\nThough the guerrillas were sufficiently pleased with the agreement to suspend their \"war tax\" on landowners, civic groups felt betrayed by what they saw as a series of unenforceable promises in lieu of immediate and concrete reforms. The Assembly of Civil Society (Asamblea de la Sociedad Civil, ASC), set up in 1994 to provide input to the peace negotiations from nongovernmental organizations and civilian groups, complained that its recommendations for broader reforms had been ignored. The National Indigenous and Peasant Coordinating Committee (Coordinadora Nacional Ind�gena y Campesina, CONIC) likewise protested that \"the accord includes minimal commitments that do not satisfy the demands of the Mayan people and campesinos,\" and vowed that land invasions would continue. Between January and May, 1996, about 15,000 campesinos from various groups have invaded more than 20 farms in six of Guatemala's 22 departments.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International:\n\nThe [Governments] deliberate criminalization and intimidation of land activists is most evident in the case of El Estor, a municipality of 70 villages in the eastern department of Izabal. For more than two years Father Daniel Joseph Vogt, a Catholic priest, together with other members of his church and land activists in the municipality of El Estor, have been subject to death threats, intimidation, and killings by unidentified individuals. In the context of a land dispute between the community and a local land company, they have also been accused by the local authorities of crimes such as sedition and deforestation.\n\nIn its January 1997 report, MINUGUA underscored the extent of the problem nationwide.\n\nThe absence of institutional mechanisms for dealing with land disputes, which often involve the indigenous population, and for implementing expeditious procedures for resolving them, as well as the Governments inability to provide legal remedies and legal advisory services to apply them, have contributed to the occurrence and the aggravation of such disputes. The Mission observed with concern that there were repeated clashes during the period under review between a number of indigenous communities and villages and between members of these communities and farm-owners, resulting in an unknown number of deaths and serious injuries and keeping tensions high in the areas in question.\n\nVIII. Security Forces\n\nFormally speaking, Guatemala has two principal security forces, the army and the National Police. The former is administered by the Defense Ministry, the latter by the Ministry of Government (Gobernaci�n). Despite a constitutional requirement that the police be managed separately from the army, the police have until recently in fact been subject to military command. Even under the civilian presidencies of Vinicio Cerezo and Jorge Serrano, the number two position in the National Police continued to be held by military officers.\n\nThere is no more powerful testament to the true purpose of the Guatemalan Armed Forces  acting as self-described bulwarks against domestic \"subversion\"  than the fact that they have been so completely interconnected with the police that it is impossible to treat the two separately. Not only has the National Police (Polic�a Nacional) long been under military leadership, the Mobile Military Police (Polic�a Militar Ambulante, PMA) has jurisdiction over civilians. Owners of rural plantations and urban private enterprises have even been able to hire PMA members to guard their property, or serve as personal bodyguards. The 2,100-member Treasury Police (Guardia de Hacienda), nominally under the Ministry of Finance, is supposed to run\n\ncustoms and control illegal stills. Yet, in cooperation with army intelligence, it has turned its power to conduct searches into a pretext to break into homes in pursuit of \"subversives.\"\n\nCorruption is widespread. Army officers are poorly paid, and expected to supplement their incomes in one of two ways. One is to seek government appointments that provide them with sobresueldos (additional stipends). That contributes to political jockeying and intrigue. Another option is to seek private sources of income. Many officers moonlight, providing security services to plantation owners and businessmen. That can entail anything from expelling peasants from land they have occupied to murdering a nettlesome union leader. Higher-ranking officers often have the option of acquiring land, much of which is taken by force. Typically, they become landlords, collecting rent from peasant farmers.\n\nThe most lucrative way of supplementing income, however, is providing protection to narcotics smugglers. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, at least ten current or former military officers are suspected of involvement in cocaine trafficking. Lt. Col. Carlos Ochoa Ru�z, for example, was indicted in Florida for transshipping 1000 pounds of Colombian cocaine through Guatemala. In March 1994, Constitutional Court President Epaminondas Gonz�lez Dub�n drafted a decision in favor of Ochoas extradition to the United States. Days later, four men murdered the judge.\n\nPolice officers are both poorly trained and poorly paid. The average policeman has a fourth-grade education, and earns about $150 a month. Low pay and impunity foster corruption. In 1995, an ad hoc committee on the National Police exposed the sale of positions in the Rapid Reaction Force  at 1,500 Quetzales apiece  to persons with police records and persons against whom arrest warrants had been served. According to the U.S. Department of State, \"Rampant corruption continues to impede the proper functioning of the police force, and there are credible allegations of some police involvement in narcotics trafficking.\"\n\nThe National Police has also been involved in other criminal activities. Upon taking office in early 1996, President Alvaro Arz� fired 122 policemen, charging them with crimes ranging from auto theft to kidnapping. The courts may, however, reinstate most of the accused. In September 1996, President Arz� fired two more generals, including Vice Minister of Defense C�sar Augusto Garc�a Gonz�lez, for involvement in a smuggling and robbery ring run by Alfredo Moreno Molina, a former military intelligence operative in the customs office. The President also dismissed sixteen other officials, including police officers, customs officials, and three colonels for their alleged involvement in the ring.\n\nThe army has done little that is identifiably related to defending the nation from foreign threats. Guatemala has not had any recent history of conflict with either Mexico, El Salvador, or Honduras. Though it once claimed neighboring Belize as part of its territory, it has since renounced plans to seize the former British colony and has agreed to mediate a border dispute. Accordingly, all of Guatemalas 46,000-man armed forces are deployed to maintain domestic order. The country has only a nominal navy (1,000 sailors, 600 of whom are marines) and air force (1,300 members), both of which are under army control. Instead of being concentrated near the countrys four borders, the army itself is distributed throughout the country in 22 military zones, one for each department.\n\nThe armys central authority is its High Command (Estado Mayor), beneath which are five tactical commands. Personnel is D-1, Intelligence is D-2, Operations is D-3, Logistics is D-4, and Civil Affairs is D-5. The departmental counterparts are designated G-1 through G-5, and at the battalion level, S-1 through S-5. Civil Affairs, which originated in Intelligence, became a tactical command in 1982. S-5 operatives, who typically do not wear uniforms, advise military zone commanders in the use of psychological techniques and provision of social services as elements of counter-insurgency. G-2 is by far the most notorious branch of the army, for its role in the development and supervision of death squads. According to journalist Allan Nairn:\n\nWith a contingent of more than 2,000 agents and with sub-units in the local army bases, the G-2  under orders of the army high command  coordinates the torture, assassination and disappearance of dissidents.\n\nA. Death Squads and \"The Files\"\n\nGuatemala is reputed to have been the first Latin American country to develop death squads (escuadrones de la muerte) and their primary modus operandi, the \"disappearance.\" Far from implying an unknown fate for the victims, \"disappearance\" has served as a euphemism for kidnapping, usually followed by brutal torture, and, with rare exceptions, murder. To further contribute to the sense of terror, the (typically mutilated) bodies of the victims are dumped in ditches, wells, garbage dumps, and on sidewalks and roadsides.\n\nThough the first self-described death squads were formed in the context of the counter-insurgency campaign of the 1960s, their roots go back to the CIA-backed overthrow of President Jacobo Arbenz in 1954. The new strongman, Col. Carlos Castillo Armas, decreed a Preventive Penal Law against Communism, providing for arbitrary arrest for up to six months of those designated as \"Communists.\" Though the Guatemalan Communist Party had peaked at a membership of 4,000, the regime branded 72,000 citizens  most of them non-communist supporters of President Arbenz  as \"Communists.\" Seventeen thousand were imprisoned, with no right of appeal. In 1963, these lists were incorporated into an expanded \"National Security Archive\" administered by Military Intelligence (G-2).\n\nThough outdated and compiled with little regard for accuracy, the \"archives\" would later be used to put together lists of victims for government-sanctioned and organized death squads. In September 1980, for instance, Lucila Rodas de Villagr�n, a 60-year-old schoolteacher, was shot by unidentified assailants. Then, while hospitalized in Quetzaltenango under police \"protection,\" death squad members shot her to death. Her only apparent act of subversion was to have belonged to the pro-Arbenz Revolutionary Action Party (Partido Acci�n Revolucionario) more than a quarter century beforehand.\n\nJust as the lists of alleged subversives first appeared in the aftermath of the 1954 coup, so did the organization that would form the first death squads. Founded by Col. Castillo Armas himself, the National Liberation Movement (Movimiento de Liberaci�n Nacional, MLN) created White Hand (Mano Blanca) in the 1960s. Then-MLN leader Mario Sandoval Alarc�n, who boasted of his role as \"godfather of the death squads,\" actually served as Vice-President under Gen. Eugenio Kjell Laugerud (1976-1978).\n\nUnder Gen. Romeo Lucas Garc�a (1978-1982), the Government took more direct control of the death squads. As White Hand faded, it was replaced by the Death Squad (Escuadr�n de la Muerte) and the Secret Anti-Communist Army (Ej�rcito Secreto Anticomunista, ESA). In 1979, the National Police (under the Ministry of Government) claimed the Death Squad had killed 1,224 \"criminals,\" and that the ESA had killed 3,252 \"subversives,\" in effect hinting at its responsibility. According to El�as Barahona y Barahona, who served as press representative for the Ministry of Government from 1976 to 1980, the Minister of Government stored blank letterhead of the Death Squad and ESA in his office.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, the lists of death squad victims were prepared by an inter-agency office located in an annex of the National Palace, alongside the Presidents official residence. Commonly known as Archivos (literally \"the files\"), the agency was directed by the joint head of the Presidential General Staff (Estado Mayor Presidencial, EMP) and Military Intelligence (G-2). Decisions on who to make \"disappear\" were made jointly by the Ministry of Defense (overseeing the army), the Ministry of Government (overseeing the police), and the Army General Staff, which commanded the death squads. According to a high-ranking police official interviewed by Americas Watch, army intelligence would occasionally warn the National Police that \"in such a sector at a determined time and on determined dates, the police ought not to intervene to avoid foul-ups in the operation.\"\n\nAccording to Amnesty International:\n\nNo evidence has been found to support government claims that \"death squads\" exist that are independent of the regular security services. Where the captors or assassins of alleged \"subversives\" and \"criminals\" have been identified the perpetrators have been members of the regular security services.\n\nDespite the nominal return to civilian rule in 1986, the military kept effective control over security by physically occupying much of the National Palace. In late 1993, the EMP, which housed Archivos, had 530 persons working within the offices of the Presidency.\n\nThe return to civilian rule in 1986 was accompanied by the growing influence of the EMP, as a principal vehicle for the military to develop and maintain a high\n\ndegree of influence over the last three Presidents [Cerezo, Serrano, de Le�n]. The Presidential General Staff has achieved this influence not only by offering the President intelligence reports, but also by gradually taking over presidential scheduling and advisory services. A 1992 Cr�nica article characterized then EMP-head General Francisco Ortega Menaldo as the power behind the throne, whose duties included setting up President Serranos appointments, administering the Presidents discretionary budget, pointing out important news events, and providing the President with advance biographical information on the people with whom he was scheduled to meet.\n\nThe death squads, meanwhile, continued to operate, under new names. The ESA vanished, to be replaced in 1989 (during the Cerezo presidency) by the Avenging Jaguar (Jaguar Justiciero). Though the Government tried to portray these as the creations of right-wing extremists, the security forces role again became obvious following the assassination of anthropologist Myrna Mack, who had been studying the Communities of Population in Resistance (CPRs) in the western highlands. The assassin  Noel de Jes�s Beteta Alvarez  turned out to be an Archivos Sergeant Major Specialist. The police detective who uncovered the link to Archivos was himself murdered, and the police report altered in a futile attempt to conceal the involvement of Archivos. Under persistent pressure from the family of the victim and the U.S. Government, Myrna Macks assassin was sentenced to 25 years in jail in 1993. The superiors who gave him his orders were finally indicted in 1996; they are awaiting trial pending a Supreme Court decision on whether the case should be tried by a military or civilian court.\n\nThough the numbers of political murders and disappearances have declined substantially since the early 1980s, clandestine organizations with ties to the nations security forces continue to murder citizens with impunity. In its 1997 report on human rights in Guatemala, the U.S. Department of State said:\n\nPolitically motivated killings continued with disturbing frequency, albeit at lower levels than in recent years. PAC members, police and military personnel, and right-wing extremist groups were all responsible for political and extrajudicial killings. Because of the scarcity of law enforcement resources and a weak and ineffective judicial system, the Government did not successfully investigate many killings or other crimes fully or detain and prosecute perpetrators. The Governments inability to identify, prosecute, or punish those responsible for such offenses remains an impediment to human rights progress.\n\nArchivos was supposed to have been dismantled on the order of President de Le�n Carpio in August 1993. Yet in March 1995, Col. Otto P�rez Molina, then head of the EMP, told Human Rights Watch/Americas that Archivos was still in existence. Its current fate is unclear, particularly since the contents of the archives themselves have never been made public. There is therefore no way of knowing whether the files have been transferred to the new civilian intelligence agency, retained by the military, or destroyed.\n\nB. Role of the CIA\n\nThrough most of the past half-century, the Central Intelligence Agency has played a critical role in organizing and advising Guatemalas security forces. The agency plotted and oversaw the 1954 coup against the elected Government of President Jacobo Arbenz. For the next four decades, throughout the period of intense repression of the civilian population, the CIA maintained a close working relationship with Guatemalan intelligence. The close ties persisted at a clandestine level even when the White House  under Jimmy Carter, George Bush, and Bill Clinton  adopted public positions critical of the human rights record of the Guatemalan Government. Ultimately, the CIAs covert activities were exposed by disclosure that one of its \"assets\"  a G-2 colonel  had been responsible for the cover up of the murder of a U.S. citizen and the torture of the husband of another U.S. citizen, and that local and regional CIA officials had concealed that information from the White House, the State Department, and Congress.\n\nIn June 1990, American inn-keeper Michael DeVine vanished while inspecting the grounds of his ranch outside Popt�n, 140 miles north of Guatemala City. His wife visited the local army garrison and asked to speak with the base commander, Col. Julio Roberto Alp�rez, but was turned away at the gate. The following morning, DeVines body turned up on a roadside near the ranch, with his hands tied and his head almost severed from his body. Shortly thereafter, Popt�n residents told both Mrs. DeVine and U.S. Embassy officials that they had earlier run into a white pickup truck filled with armed men on a road beside the DeVine ranch, and that the men had inquired about Mr. DeVines whereabouts. Other villagers saw the truck enter and exit from Col. Alp�rez base in the days preceding the murder. From the license plate, a private investigator traced the truck to a military base in Flores, the provincial capital. At the very least, Col. Alp�rez had hosted an army squad sent to murder a U.S. citizen. He also covered up\n\nthe armys involvement, declining to provide U.S. Embassy officials with records of vehicles that had entered or left his base in the days prior to the murder.\n\nIn response, the Bush administration suspended overt military assistance to Guatemala in December 1990. But it secretly allowed the CIA to more than compensate for the overt cutoff. While the Bush and Clinton administrations withheld a little over $3 million in military aid, the CIA funneled close to $10 million to its partners in the Guatemalan intelligence establishment. To avoid having to notify Congressional oversight committees, as now required for formal covert actions, the CIA disbursed the funds under its ultra-covert \"liaison programs,\" which require neither presidential authorization nor notification of the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nCol. Alp�rez, whose association with the U.S. Armed Forces stretches back twenty years, was among those retained on the CIA payroll. Alp�rez first trained at the U.S. Armys School of the Americas in 1970, then returned to the School as a CIA \"asset\" in 1989 for a year-long Command and General Staff course. It was right after his return to Guatemala that he sanctioned the cover-up of Michael DeVines murder. Though aware of allegations of the colonels involvement in the slaying, the CIA nonetheless paid him another $44,000 following the termination of overt military aid.\n\nSignificantly, Col. Alp�rez worked for Archivos (\"The Files\"), the Guatemalan intelligence agency that kept files on thousands of civilians, tapping telephones, intercepting mail, conducting interrogations under torture, and supplying lists of victims for the armys G-2 death squads. Though Archivos was formally abolished by President de Le�n Carpio in 1993, former Guatemalan Defense Minister Gen. H�ctor Gramajo alleged that the nominally civilian intelligence agency that replaced it remained under de facto military control.\n\nThe revelations of direct links between the CIA and Guatemalas murderous military intelligence establishment surfaced as the outcome of another U.S. citizens determination to uncover the fate of her husband, guerrilla commander Efra�n B�maca (Comandante Everardo), a member of the Mam ethnic group. After more than two years of futile inquiries, Jennifer Harbury, a graduate of Harvard Law School, went on a hunger strike in October 1994 to demand an answer. That led the Clinton administration to begin investigating, and ultimately prompted Rep. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) to disclose the CIAs connection to Col. Alp�rez, who had ordered the torture and possibly the execution of Efra�n B�maca after the latters capture on March 12, 1992.\n\nFollowing that disclosure, President Clinton ordered a full review of CIA operations in Guatemala.
