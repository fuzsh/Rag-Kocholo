        "meta_description": "ABSTRACT. Current WHO guidelines for onchocerciasis elimination provide requirements for stopping mass drug administration of ivermectin and the verification of elimination of transmission. These guidelines also recommend post-elimination surveillance (PES) based on entomological surveys. Serological markers in humans could complement entomological PES once the longevity of anti–OV-16 antibody responses is better understood. In 2014–2015 we evaluated ELISA anti–OV-16 IgG4 antibody persistence among previously seropositive people from the central endemic zone of Guatemala. The country stopped all onchocerciasis program interventions in 2012 and was verified by WHO as having eliminated transmission of onchocerciasis in 2016. A total of 246 participants with prior OV-16 ELISA results from 2003, 2006, 2007, or 2009 were enrolled in a follow-up study. Of these, 77 people were previously OV-16 seropositive and 169 were previously seronegative. By 2014 and 2015, 56 (72.7%) previously seropositive individuals had sero-reverted, whereas all previous negatives remained seronegative. The progression of antibody responses over time was estimated using a mixed-effects linear regression model, using data from seropositive participants who had sero-reverted. The temporal variation showed a mean activity unit decay of 0.20 per year (95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.17, 0.23), corresponding to an estimated antibody response half-life of 3.3 years (95% CrI: 2.7, 4.1). These findings indicate that the majority of seropositive people will sero-revert over time.",

        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nOnchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a vector-borne neglected tropical disease caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. Currently, it is estimated that 20.9 million people are infected, and approximately 205 million are at risk of acquiring the disease,1 mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen. Onchocerciasis is targeted for elimination primarily through mass drug administration (MDA) of Mectizan. In the Americas, the transmission of onchocerciasis has been eliminated in 11 of the 13 historically endemic foci, and four countries have been verified by WHO as having interrupted the transmission of onchocerciasis: Colombia in 2013,2 Ecuador in 2014,3 México in 2015,4 and Guatemala in 2016.5\n\nAccording to the current WHO guidelines for onchocerciasis elimination, national programs should develop a post-elimination surveillance (PES) method for monitoring for recrudescence or reintroduction of the disease.6 The guidelines suggest the implementation of entomological surveys at regular intervals in formerly endemic and nonendemic regions. Guidance for the recommended number and location of sites for simulid collection, number of flies to collect, and frequency of fly collection has not been developed.\n\nInterruption of transmission requires that the incidence of new patent adult worm infections be reduced below the theoretical breakpoint for maintaining the life cycle, R0. Because there are uncertainties about both the actual breakpoint for any particular location and the prevalence of infection in humans and flies when MDA is stopped, studies assessing the risk of recrudescence as well as the risk of reintroduction of infection are needed to inform strategies for surveillance.\n\nBetter understanding of the temporal evolution of the human antibody response to O. volvulus is also needed to inform serological strategies for PES. Studies in nonhuman primates have shown that IgG4 antibody responses to parasite antigen OV-16 were detectable at 15 months after inoculation. And after more than 4 years of follow-up, there was a trend for antibody clearance (sero-reversion).7 Data from a 10-year follow-up study of onchocerciasis patients residing in the United States also showed sero-reversion of anti–OV-16 responses in half the patients.8 More recently, a study in Nigeria comparing onchocerciasis microfiladermia in communities that received 17 years of annual ivermectin MDA demonstrated declines in OV-16 seropositivity, suggesting that sero-reversions had likely occurred.9\n\nIn this study, we investigated changes in anti–OV-16 IgG4 antibody reactivity among individual residents of formerly endemic areas in central Guatemala (the “central endemic zone”) before and after onchocerciasis transmission was eliminated to provide the first specific estimates of longevity of antibody responses and rates of antibody decay.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStudy site.\n\nThe study was conducted in four communities from the departments of Suchitepéquez and Chimaltenango in the onchocerciasis central endemic zone in southwestern Guatemala. The study included two yearly visits, the first one in 2014 and a follow-up visit in 2015. In this focus, annual ivermectin MDA started in the 1980s.5 The national onchocerciasis program implemented twice-yearly MDA with ivermectin in 2000 and reached more than 85% coverage of the eligible population in 2002. This strategy was maintained until MDA was suspended in 2012 after entomological and serological surveys found no infective blackflies and no children under 10 years old positive for IgG4 antibodies against OV-16. We selected this site because of the unique opportunity to study individual changes in antibody levels given that 1) the area used to be hyperendemic for onchocerciasis and transmission no longer existed in this focus and 2) because transmission had been interrupted, any person with previous seropositive results would not have been exposed to or reinfected with O. volvulus over the past 3 years.\n\nStudy population.\n\nHistorical data from surveys conducted by the National Ministry of Health (NMH) identified 193 people of all ages with positive anti–OV-16 serology between 2003 and 2009. These program surveys were not part of the assessments to determine if transmission of onchocerciasis was interrupted. Our study aimed to enroll two seronegative persons for each seropositive individual. This was based on the assumption of 30% onchocerciasis exposure among seronegative individuals before interruption of transmission was verified and a significance level of 95%. This gave the study 90% power to detect new seroconversions among previously seronegative persons. For study inclusion, participants also had to have been permanent residents of their communities for ≥5 years.\n\nQuestionnaire.\n\nBasic demographic and epidemiological information about participants (age, sex, community, years of residence in the endemic area, history of treatment with ivermectin, self-reported adherence to treatment, and presence of skin or eye symptoms) was collected using questionnaires on smart phones.\n\nSample collection.\n\nPeripheral venous blood was collected from study participants in heparinized Vacutainer™ tubes. Dried blood spots (DBSs) were prepared immediately after collection by spotting 70 µL of whole blood on Whatman 903 paper (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Participants unwilling to provide blood samples by venipuncture but willing to participate in the study had the option of providing a blood sample by finger prick.\n\nOV-16 ELISA.\n\nIgG4 antibody responses against O. volvulus OV-16 antigen were tested by ELISA following the same methodology previously used in Guatemala.10,11 Briefly, 96-well Immulon II plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were coated with OV-16 antigen at a concentration of 0.1 µg/well in 100 µL of carbonate buffer (NaHCO3 0.1 M, pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed 3× with phosphate buffered saline–Tween (PBST) (0.025 M, pH 7.0–7.4, 0.05% Tween 20.) Two 6-mm punches from each DBS were incubated overnight at 4°C in 200 µL of PBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The next day, the plates were washed 4× with PBST, followed by blocking for 1 hour at 4°C with 100 µL of PBST-BSA. The blocking solution was decanted, the plates were washed 2× with PBST, and 50 µL of either assay controls or experimental samples was added to duplicate wells and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature (RT). Samples were decanted, and the plates were washed 4× with PBST. Fifty microliters per well of biotin-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG4 (Invitrogen Corporation [previously Zymed Corp], Camarillo, CA) at a 1:1,000 dilution in PBST was added per well and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Plates were washed 4× with PBST and incubated for 1 hour at RT with 50 µL of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) diluted 1:100 in PBST. Before substrate was added, plates were washed 4× with PBST. The ELISA was developed with 50 µL per well of p-nitro phenyl phosphate (Sigma) dissolved at 1 mg/mL in development buffer (10% diethylonamine, 3 mM MgCl, pH 9.8). The plates were incubated at RT and monitored for chromogen development until the wells with the 1:20 standard dilution reached an optical density (OD) value of 1.500. The reaction was stopped with sodium hydroxide 1 N, and the plate was read in an ELISA reader set at 405 nm.\n\nStandard curve and cutoff determination.\n\nA reference standard for the quantification of the results was developed previously by the onchocerciasis laboratory group at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG) to normalize results and control for inter-assay variability. This protocol has been used in all serological evaluations in the region by the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas since 2003. The standard curve was generated by serial dilutions of a pool of positive samples previously collected in Guatemala. The same protocol and normalizing positive control were used in our study. Briefly, each of the selected dilutions was assigned an activity unit (AU) value, starting with an arbitrary value of 2,500 units that was assigned to the 1:10 dilution. The resulting AUs were plotted against OD values and fit to a standard curve using the four-point parameter logistic function from SoftMax-Pro v. 4 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The optimal threshold values for positivity (cutoffs) were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The ROC analyses used samples from people with confirmed infections (had at least one onchocercoma), and negatives were from people living in similar but nonendemic settings and from people with other parasitic diseases: lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, and Taenia solium cysticercosis (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Using the previously determined 40 AU cutoff (Supplemental Figure 1), this OV-16 ELISA had a sensitivity of at least 60% and a specificity of at least 99% (Supplemental Table 1).\n\nIgG4 antibody decay model.\n\nFor these analyses, it was assumed that anti–OV-16 IgG4 antibody values would decay exponentially over time, which is equivalent to a linear reduction of antibody titer on a log scale. A mixed-effects model was fitted to the data from each person to account for individual variation in antibody decay rates. Only data from people with AU values that decreased from the endemic period (2003–2009) to the samples collected in this study (2014 or 2015) were used in this model.\n\nThe antibody level Aij in individual i at time point tj is given by\n\nlog(Aij)∼log(Ai,2006)−(r+ri)tj+εij,\n\nwhere Ai,2006 is the antibody level in 2006, r is the average rate of decay of antibody level in the population, ri ∼ N(0, σr) is the deviation in the decay rate of individual i from the population average, and εij ∼ N(0, σobs) is the normally distributed measurement error. The model was fitted to the data in a Bayesian framework using uniform priors defined as follows: r ∼ U(0, 100), σr ∼ U(0, 100), and σobs ∼ U(0, 100).\n\nProtection of human subjects.\n\nThe study protocol, consent and assent forms, and questionnaire received ethical approval from the institutional review board of the CDC (protocol no. 6565), the Ethics Committee of the Center for Health studies, UVG (protocol 092-01-2014), and the National Committee of Health Ethics of the NMH of Guatemala (protocol 39-2014).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThere are few studies on the longitudinal dynamics of antibody responses against onchocerciasis. Most studies focused on the time to seroconversion, with reports of first anti–OV-16 IgG seropositivity at 13 months12 and IgG4 at 15 months7 after inoculation of nonhuman primates in laboratory-controlled environments. However, understanding the dynamics of antibody decay is very important as well. Current WHO guidelines for the verification of the elimination of transmission of onchocerciasis require long-term surveillance until regional elimination occurs. Although guidelines currently recommend only the use of entomological assessments, it may be difficult to maintain entomological surveillance after the initial posttreatment surveillance period is completed. We believe that monitoring antibody levels may be a more feasible way to perform PES in the future.\n\nMeasurement of OV-16 IgG4 has been used to demonstrate the interruption of transmission of onchocerciasis in both the Americas2,10,13–19 and Africa.20 However, it cannot distinguish between resolved infections that no longer contribute to transmission and new or current infections that may contribute to transmission. Understanding the rates of antibody decay for onchocerciasis may allow the use of human serology as a surveillance tool. Serologic surveillance could potentially be conducted across an expanded range of age groups, which would overcome a limitation of the current monitoring strategy, which focuses on serologic testing of people born after onchocerciasis elimination programs were implemented.\n\nThe use of serology may offer some additional advantages, as it may be easier to conduct assessments on human populations than to conduct an onchocerciasis-specific entomological assessment. In general, health workers are more familiar with blood sample collection than with identification of breeding sites and capture of Simulium vectors. Another potential advantage is that sero-surveys for onchocerciasis could be integrated with other public health surveillance activities, either through collection of specimens that could be tested by national onchocerciasis programs or as part of integrated sero-surveillance activities in which testing could be done using multiplex bead assays, which can simultaneously measure antibody responses to onchocerciasis and other pathogens.21 Overall, serology could be a more feasible and informative option for onchocerciasis surveillance in the post-elimination period.\n\nOur findings have some potential limitations. Identifying and enrolling people from surveys conducted 5 or more years ago was very challenging, and the number of study participants recruited (N = 246) was relatively small. However, this sample size is substantially larger than those of previous studies of antibody dynamics8 and was large enough that we were able to estimate rates of decay. It also would have been ideal to have all samples tested simultaneously. However, the results from the sero-surveys previously conducted by the NMH were tested in the same laboratory at UVG, following the same protocol. Furthermore, all OV-16 ELISA AU values were normalized with the same reference controls as used between 2003 and 2009. Therefore, the OV-16 ELISA AU values determined in 2014 and 2015 were likely comparable to AU values determined in 2003–2009, allowing us to model the dynamics of sero-reversion.\n\nWe found that a substantial number of formerly seropositive study participants sero-reverted by 2014. This study also determined that the rates of decay were similar regardless of a positive diagnosis for MF, suggesting that in this study population, detection of parasites at baseline would lead to higher ELISA antibody titers, although it did not appear to affect the overall rates of antibody waning.\n\nThe seropositive participants, whose data were used to determine the rates of decay, were mostly adults whose ages were greater than those recommended in the WHO guidelines for elimination of onchocerciasis.6 However, more than 70% had sero-reverted. This observation may lead to future studies to determine expanded age ranges for PES activities that could provide the necessary evidence for revised PES guidelines. Despite sampling an older age population, our findings show a strong trend to sero-reversion in this community.\n\nAs significant progress is made toward the elimination of onchocerciasis, with >90% reduction in the population at risk in the Americas and multiple foci showing interruption of transmission in African settings, there is a clear need to define strategies for PES that could complement or substitute for the vector monitoring activities proposed in the current WHO guidelines. Serology for PES could indeed be more feasible to implement, and further studies will be needed to provide evidence for making future recommendations. For example, studies that generate community representative disease exposure over time, such as age-seroprevalence curves, could provide key information to determine the dynamics of seroconversion by age and reliable data for new age ranges for serology-based PES. These studies not only would broaden the age range for individuals to be surveyed but could also increase the quality, feasibility, and reliability of PES.\n\nOur data on the dynamics of sero-reversion suggest that serology assays such as OV-16 ELISA can be reliably used for programmatic assessments and can provide preliminary evidence for using serological assessments after the successful elimination of onchocerciasis transmission."
