        "text": "This article examines the internal structure and dynamics of the coffee economy in two districts of the southern Mexican state of Chiapas during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz (1876–1911). In both Palenque, in the northern highlands, and Soconusco, on the Pacific coast, production was oriented to international markets, direct foreign investment was a key aspect of coffee plantation development, and workers were recruited by the payment of wage advances (enganche), which they were then expected to pay off by labouring on coffee plantations. Yet, despite these similarities, the social relations that characterised coffee production in the two districts differed considerably. This article analyses those differences by comparing and contrasting the demographic factors, processes of land privatisation and the relationship between foreign investors, the national regime and local elites that influenced the nature and purpose of debt peonage in each district.\n\nEste artigo examina a estrutura e a dinâmica interna da economia cafeeira em dois distritos do estado sulista mexicano de Chiapas durante a presidência de Porfirio Díaz (1876–1911). Em Palenque, nas montanhas do norte, e em Soconusco, na costa pacífica, a produção era orientada para mercados internacionais; o investimento estrangeiro era um ponto chave do desenvolvimento de plantações de café, e trabalhadores eram recrutados com o pagamento de salários adiantados (enganche) que eles então deveriam devolver com seu trabalho nas plantações de café. Porém, não obstante essas semelhanças, as relações sociais que caracterizavam a produção cafeeira nos dois distritos eram bastante distintas. O artigo analisa essas diferenças comparando e contrastando os fatores demográficos, os processos de privatização de terras e a relação entre investidores estrangeiros, o regime nacional e as elites locais que influenciaram a natureza e propósito da servidão por dívida em cada distrito.\n\nPalavras-chave: lavradores, café, Chiapas, desenvolvimento de exportação, investimento estrangeiro, servidão por dívida, trabalhadores indígenas, México porfiriano.\n\n28 AGPD, Legajo XIX, expediente 17617, Ricardo de Marcía y Campos to P. Díaz, 15 November 1894. The national tariff for public land in Chiapas was 2 pesos per hectare in 1895; by contrast, in 1895 the land company was charging 45 pesos per hectare in the coffee zone of Las Chicharras in the municipality of Tapachula, although land at lower altitude cost less. See, Archivo de Poder Judicial de Soconusco, Tapachula (APJS), ‘Venta de lote a Placido Monzon por la Cia Mexicana de Terrenos y Colonización’, 1895.\n\n31 For example, in 1912 the inhabitants of Escuintla, who had lost their ejido to the colonisation company in 1909, complained to President Madero that they had since come to depend on working as peons on the fincas of foreigners, where they were mistreated and received a miserly wage: Gudiño Cejudo, ‘El Soconusco,’ p. 152.\n\n48 Viquiera, Juan Pedro, ‘Los límites del mestizaje cultural en Chiapas,’ América Indígena, vol. 1, no. 2 (1994), pp. 279–303Google Scholar; and Aída, RosalvaCastillo, Hernández and Nigh, Ronald, ‘Global Processes and Local Identity among Mayan Coffee Growers in Chiapas, Mexico’, American Anthropologist, vol. 100, no. 1 (1998), pp. 136–47Google Scholar. In 1892, Emilio Rabasa reported that many Guatemalan families were crossing the border in Comitán, in response to an order given by President Díaz to grant each family 30 hectares instead of three: AGPD, Legajo XVII, expediente 14543, E. Rabasa to P. Díaz, 23 August 1892.\n\n66 AGPD, Legajo XXIV, expediente 15132, Agustín Farrera to P. Díaz, 12 October 1899. The average price paid for coffee imported into the USA fell from a high of 17 cents per pound in 1892 to 6.6 cents in 1899 and did not rise to above nine cents until 1910; Mario Samper and Radin Fernando, ‘Historical Statistics of Coffee Production and Trade from 1700 to 1960,’ in William Gervase Clarence-Smith and Steven Topik (eds.), The Global Coffee Economy in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, 1500–1989 (Cambridge, 2003), pp. 451–2.\n\n82 Kaerger, Agricultura y Colonización en Mexico, p. 107. Kaerger's observations are supported by evidence from the finca San Juan Las Chicharras, which in 1905 had on its books 79 workers (mozos) with debts of 8,618 pesos (an average of 109 pesos each), 102 coffee pickers (tapiscadores), the majority of whom were women, with debts totalling 1,227 pesos (an average of 12 pesos each) and 148 workers who had absconded (mozos fugos), owing the finca 7,060 pesos. Thus just under half of the 16,905 pesos invested in labour advances had to be written off as bad debt; APJS, Tapachula, expediente w/n, ‘Inventario de San Juan Chicharras’, 1905.\n\n96 For example, in 1910 El Chival rubber plantation in Palenque employed a ‘floating contingent … of Indians of the neighbourhood,’ which varied seasonally between 100 and 150 men, each paid 75 centavos to one peso per day without rations. J. L. Hermessen, ‘“Castilloa” Rubber in Chiapas (Mexico) – II’, p. 213. According to the same source, daily rations cost approximately 50 centavos. Thus, if Chival's enganchador took half of the workers' wages in commission (AHCH, Gobernación, Vol. XI, 1909, expediente 45, 9 July 1908) each worker received approximately 3 pesos per week, which did not even cover the cost of subsistence.\n\n99 For example, in 1874 the local priest complained to the bishop that instead of paying church dues to him, the population of Tumbalá were paying ‘tribute’ to the schoolteacher, see, AHDC, Ref. PALENQUE, IV.D.1, José Fernando Macal to the Bishop of Chiapas, November 1874.\n\n122 According to a 1905 shareholders report of The Chiapas Rubber Plantation Company, the company recovered eighty per cent of the money paid out to labour through the company store: Library of Congress, Washington D.C., Shareholders report, The Chiapas Rubber Plantation Company, 1905.\n\n123 However, one has to be careful before concluding that wage advances functioned as a market incentive in a basically voluntarist system. The local authorities did not consistently enforce debt peonage in Soconusco after 1890; but for a fee they would aid planters in matters of labour discipline and control; in the highlands, where the state did enforce debt peonage, enganchadores used a variety of coercive mechansisms to contract workers for the coastal plantations; and, despite the possibility of running up large debts, accepting multiple wage advances or running away, workers perceived plantation labour as very hard and poorly remunerated."
