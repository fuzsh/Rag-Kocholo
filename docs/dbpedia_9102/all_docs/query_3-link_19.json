        "text": "Learning how sugar cane is turned into panela (sugar)\n\nMany families grow sugar cane either in their agricultural fields or in their home gardens. The area is scattered with trapiches, sugar mills that turn sugar cane into brown sugar cakes called panela. Sugar cane is cut and fed into a sugar mill that squeezes the sweet liquid from the stalk. It is then boiled and poured into wooden molds to make panela\n\nGloria Evins straining cane juice panela (2008)\n\nMaking jicara containers\n\nGourd trees produce gourds that can be made into useful containers.\n\nManuel Perez showing students Angel Medina, Wendy Ghiloni, and Paul vaca\n\nhow to make jicara containers and scoops (2004)\n\nMaking tamales (from scratch!)\n\nBeginning with removing the dried corn from the cob, the corn is then cooked with mineral lime. Students help to grind the corn, and then make delicious mole tamales wrapped in the leaves of hoja blanca.\n\nWorking with the Centro Agroecológico San Franciscso de Asis (CASFA)\n\nIn 2010, a new disease, monilia (Moniliophthora roreri) had devastated cacao crops across Central America and southern Mexico. Monilia is a fungus that spreads quickly through cacao groves. That year, the class was dedicated to working with CASFA to distribute information and new tools to fight the disease. At that time, the principle strategy was to prune both of the trees that provide shade to the cacao trees as well as the cacao trees themselves. The fungus can be controlled, to some extent, by allowing more sunlight to reach the cacao trees. CASFA provided cacao farmers with pruning tools, and we helped them to prune the trees.\n\nConducting market survey in Acacoyagua\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, one of the class's goals was to investigate supply chains and how the various products found in the Acacoyagua market were moved from where they were produced to the market. Whereas some products were produced on local farms (e.g., coffee, chilli peppers, greens such as chipilin, honey) or in local homes (e.g., cheese, cream), many common fruits and vegetables (tomatoes, onions, melons) are trucked into the region from Central Mexico or the Chiapas highlands.\n\nCynthia Ferreyra and Ruby Zamora conducting market survey, Acacoyagua (2015)\n\nNick Austin and Jennifer Ovalle learning about homemade cheese making, Acacoyagua market (2015)\n\nKeva Williams and Ann Bennett, market survey, Acacoyagua (2016)\n\nLearning about the large-scale expansion of a new monocrop: African palm\n\nAfrican palm (Elaeis guineensis), used primarily for cooking oil, has been grown in the Soconusco region for several decades. But a new push for greatly expanded production has taken place over the past few years. In 2015 and 2016, one focus for the class was trying to understand the impacts of this shift and how local farmers viewed it. Many were hopeful it would bring greater prosperity, but others were very concerned that it was replacing crops that were previously grown for local consumption, and because African palm requires so much water, many local residents are worried about the water supply.\n\nClass learning about African palm cultivation (2015)\n\nClass visiting African palm processing plant, Villa Comaltitlan (2016)\n\nVisiting the Museo Regional del Soconusco\n\nVisiting the archaeological site of Izapa, near Tapachula, Chiapas\n\nVisiting the Las Encrucijadas Biosphere in the mangrove swamp\n\nfront: Luis Candelario, Octavio Ramirez, Kiva Williams, Mariano Perez, Angel Pinedo, Bianca Borja; rear: Marta Hernández, Robert Husted, Angelica Perez, Adriana Rodriguez, Dr. Gasco and Biologist from the Campamento Tortuguero, La Encrucijada Biosphere (2016)\n\nVisiting the archaeological site of Tonina\n\nJeff Lewis, Sara Reimann, Ed Smith & Tommy Kasper at Tonina (08)\n\nBianca Borja, Keva Williams, and Adriana Rodriguez, Tonina (2016)\n\nVisiting the archaeological site of Los Horcones, near Tonalá, Chiapas\n\nArchaeologist, Claudia Garcia Des Lauriers explaining iconography on stela at Los horcones\n\nHiking to the waterfall at El Chicol\n\nCesar Rodriguez, Monica Lomeli, and Ruben Bañuelos at waterfall El Chicol (2006)\n\nVisiting the the Museo de la Organización de Medicos Indígenas del Estado de Chiapas (OMIECH) in San Cristobal de las Casas\n\nCarole Yokota, Shannon Alves, Judy Clark, Antonio Sanchez at the Museo de OMIECH (2002)\n\nDavid Ibarra, Mario Castillo, Leslie Estrada, Nick Austin, Lissete Rivera, Museo de OMIECH (2014)\n\nVisiting the Museum of Medicine in Mexico City\n\nAngel Medina at Museum of Medicine (2004)\n\nVisiting the Musco del Cacao, San Cristobol de las Casas\n\nHaving a delicious hot chocolate at the Museo del Cacao, Mario Castillo, LIssete Rivera, David Ibarra, Leslie Estrada, Nick Austin (2014)"
