        "text": "Previous Page\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNext Page\n\nLast full appendix update: March 2024\n\nTable of contents\n\nDescription\n\nAppendix 1: Malaria Transmission and Recommended Preventive Measures by Geographical Area\n\nReferences\n\nDescription\n\nAppendix I is a country-by-country description of malaria transmission and recommendations for malaria prevention. As appropriate, regional and/or city-specific and/or seasonality risk information is also provided. The recommendations made in this appendix are generally consistent with the World Health Organization's International Travel and Health report and the CDC's Yellow Book: Health Information for International Travel. These and other sources used to develop this appendix are listed in the references.\n\nWhile this appendix is updated regularly, it is possible that it will not reflect the most up-to-date information about malaria for a country, e.g., recent cases in a hitherto malaria-free jurisdiction. For this reason, health care providers providing advice on malaria prevention are encouraged to visit the Public Health Agency of Canada's Travel Health website to monitor for the newest information related to malaria and other travel-associated health risks.\n\nFor certain countries, there is a duration-of-exposure component to recommendations, expressed as: “Travellers spending extended periods in [transmission areas] may consider chemoprophylaxis.” The intent of this approach is to allow for greater flexibility in areas where malaria transmission is low.\n\nThe appendix includes information on species of malaria parasite present in endemic countries, described as Plasmodium falciparum (P. f.), Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax), Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale), Plasmodium malariae (P. malariae) and/or Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi). The most common species is listed first and indicated in bold (if several species predominate, then they are bolded), followed by the second most frequent species, often P. vivax, and then, if additional species are present, they are identified by an *. The exception is P. knowlesi, which is always identified where it is thought to present a hazard.\n\nNotes\n\nCountries categorized as having no malaria transmission have no record of recent local transmission, or are reporting very limited sporadic local transmission.\n\nChemoprophylaxis is recommended only in the risk areas identified. Chemoprophylaxis should always be used in conjunction with personal protective measures (PPM); refer to Chapter 3: \"Malaria Education for Travellers\" and the CATMAT Statement on Personal Protective Measures to Prevent Arthropod Bites).\n\nThe decision whether to use atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline or mefloquine should be based on an individual patient benefit - risk assessment.\n\nThere might be situations where alternative agents are considered, e.g., primaquine. Refer to Chapter 8: \"Drugs for the Prevention and Treatment of Malaria\" for advice in this regard. Primaquine for presumptive anti-relapse therapy is not considered in this table (and is rarely recommended, see Chapter 8).\n\nAppendix 1: Malaria transmission and recommended preventive measures by geographical area\n\nReferences"
