        "text": "A Historical Review of Trachoma in Mexico\n\nUpon the arrival of Europeans in the Americas, trachoma was described as the existence of conjunctival granulations among Mexico’s population. The prevalence of trachoma in Mexico was essentially unknown until the late 19th century. By 1896, the presence of trachoma in Mexico was discussed at the Second Pan American Medical Congress when the Hospital of Ophthalmology, reported having historic records of 42,000 cases of trachoma from indigenous people of the Toluca Valley and Texcoco since the hospital’s founding in 1876. In 1906, Lorenzo Chávez also noted that overcrowded conditions, lack of hygiene, and basic sanitation favored the transmission of the disease.34–36 Solórzano Morfín documented the presence of trachoma among Veracruz military and civilians.37,38 In addition, Dan M. Vélez et al reported the existence of trachoma in the civilian, migrant, and indigenous populations in 1918 and 1923. After the existence of this condition was demonstrated in Mexico and an increase in trachoma was related to the presence of Asian immigrants, trachoma was listed in the Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) and the Health Code, as an infective-contagious disease in 1927.37–39\n\nFrom 1944 to 1961, there were no reports concerning the epidemiology of trachoma, coinciding with the structural changes that occurred in the health system, specifically the merger of the Department of Health and the Secretariate of Social Assistance in 1943. This period coincided with the construction of the network of hospitals throughout the Mexican Republic which had been suspended since 1910. This was promoted by Gustavo Baz, Prime Minister of Health and Assistance in Mexico. The advent of decentralized medical institutions such as the Children’s Hospital of Mexico (1943), the National Institute of Cardiology (1944), and the Hospital of Nutrition Diseases (1944), among others, resulted in a paucity of centralized data on trachoma. Thus it was not until 1962 that Javier Torroella was the first to study and initiate actions against trachoma in the highlands of the Chiapas state.37–39 This was the only known historic focus of trachoma as a cause of infectious blindness in Mexico. Trachoma was found to be endemic in five municipalities, with communities that in the 1980s showed rates of over 25% of follicular trachomatous inflammation (TF) in children under 10 years of age and 100% of scar trachoma (ie, trachomatous scarring [TS] and trachomatous trichiasis [TT]) in the adult population.5,40\n\nEvidence of the conditions and goals achieved for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem in Mexico, particularly in the state of Chiapas, has been documented by the contributions of multi-sectorial work, under the leadership of the National Health System in that State. In 1996, the WHO formed the Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma,37,39,41 guiding the implementation of specific and special strategies against the disease in endemic countries. Even though trachoma is a preventable disease, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. Trachoma affects populations where conditions of extreme poverty and social, cultural, and economic marginalization favor transmission, most often in children under the age of ten.42–45\n\nSeveral government institutions implemented a strategy for the prevention and treatment of this disease that for several years had been afflicting the most vulnerable people in Chiapas. This approach was successful, with benefits ranging from the disease prevention and improvements in the social conditions of the affected population. This was accomplished at a low cost, as the allocated resources were used efficiently and responsibly.37,43\n\nThe Institute of Health of the State of Chiapas implemented the Federal programs for the population through ten health areas called Health Jurisdictions; each of these jurisdictions included a variable number of municipalities. The five historic endemic municipalities for trachoma were located in the HJII-SCC. The trachoma program was coordinated at the national level by the National Center for Preventive Programs and Disease Control (CENAPRECE) of the Mexican Ministry of Health; in Chiapas. The State Secretariate of Health and its Directorate of Public Health, through the Sub-Direction and the Department of Preventive Programs, led the State Coordination of the Trachoma Prevention and Control Program (PEPCT as in Spanish acronym); the PEPCT was subscribed to the HJII-SCC and it was directly dependent on the trachoma brigade teams. In the five municipalities considered endemic, each had their own trachoma brigade team. These municipal teams were run by a brigade doctor who coordinated the work of their nursing technicians, health technicians, and multipurpose teams. The municipality, therefore, was the operational administrative unit in Chiapas through which the actions of prevention and control of trachoma were implemented.37,44\n\nEpidemiological studies of trachoma in the endemic area in Chiapas that were conducted from 1965 to 2017 showed progressive decline in prevalence. The prevention of trachoma-related pathology was further strengthened through the sanitation programs conducted by the aforementioned institutions. Particularly in Chiapas, the installation of the program included a series of strategies and measures for the promotion of health (such as correct washing of the face and hands), in addition to population health examinations, the dispensing of antibiotics for the treatment of the disease, and surgeries.40–52\n\nFrom 2004 to 2020, the Ministry of Health of Chiapas implemented an institutional trachoma program, with the allocation of a budget of $347,404.63 per year. The exception to this was in 2015, when the typical annual appropriation was increased by $12,593.67 by a supplemental allocation. Since the creation of the PEPCT in 2004, the Health Institute of the State of Chiapas (ISECH as in Spanish acronym) has overseen the training and maintenance of brigades exclusively focused on trachoma surveillance, prevention, and control activities in known areas in the State highlands.5,40\n\nThe operational strategic approach prior to 2001 consisted of randomly selecting communities from the five municipalities, searching for active cases of trachoma in all its phases, sensitizing patients for surgery, administration of azithromycin, promotion, health education through video projection, photo exposure, triptychs, and demonstration of face washing. In 2007, an agreement was established between the different institutions in response to a call issued by the Mexican Association of Health and Economy to eliminate trachoma. The participating institutions were the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Metropolitan Autonomous University, the Iberoamerican University, and the Anáhuac University, as well as the Secretariates of Health and Education of the State, and numerous private companies.5\n\nFor active trachoma infections, WHO recommends the use of tetracycline in 1% ophthalmic ointment and azithromycin 20 mg/kg weight. However, in the historic endemic area of the Chiapas state, the use of tetracycline was initially ruled out by a lack of compliance by the population, mainly because of the prolonged treatment course (of six weeks) and the unpleasant side effects reported by patients. As a result, PEPCT opted for azithromycin, given in in a single dose, which was well tolerated by adults as well as children. Treatments were only prescribed through azithromycin and active phase patient registration. Children under 6 months of age, were excluded and no other antibiotics were used.5\n\nIn order to interrupt the transmission of C. trachomatis, the program implemented from the outset activities that promoted facial hygiene. The promotion of facial hygiene, the use of latrines, water, and clean patio and household was effected through educational materials, guides and posters (some in local languages) aimed at health personnel, promoters and municipality committees.\n\nDuring 2010, the PEPCT brigades re-evaluated facial hygiene in 43,026 children under the age of 11 in the five municipalities of the historic endemic area. Of these, 41,896 children met the clean-face criterion, representing 97.37%. of the population evaluated. This was 1.37% more than that during 2005; 1130 children exhibited poor facial hygiene, the most common signs being discharge from the eyes, nose, dirty with grime, and others (food scraps). The 2011 evaluation found that out of 47,666 children under the age of 11 examined from these municipalities, 46,995 children (98,59%) met the clean face criterion, an increase of 1.22% compared to the previous year.5\n\nFrom 2000 to the present, home-to-home searches have also been carried out in the five municipalities endemic for trachoma, to detect cases of trachoma and to offer surgery when appropriate. From 2002 to 2004, 236 TT cases were detected, of which 228 (97%) were surgically corrected. The municipality with the highest number of surgeries was the municipality of Oxchuc (158 surgeries) followed by San Juan Cancuc (33 surgeries); behind them were the municipalities of Tenejapa, Chanal, and Huixtán. By 2005, 249 people were identified and surgically treated.5\n\nPEPCT (2004–2010) detected 153 TT cases requiring surgical care, which were carried out continuously in endemic municipalities; however, some of the patients required more than one surgery, mostly reconstructive. The follow-up approach for these recurrent patients was conducted through the health brigades of the trachoma program, which had the effect of generating acceptance and awareness for surgical correction with the team of certified surgeons.5\n\nThe trachoma program at Chiapas Health Services has maintained the nominal census of patients with a history of trachoma-related surgery since 2004. Each patient has a dossier, which among many other variables includes the name, age, gender, date of surgeries, what type of surgery was performed and the surgeon who performed the operation. For 2015, a total of 146 patients from the five endemic municipalities were recoded: Oxchuc (99), San Juan Cancuc (14), Tenejapa (16), Huixtán (11) and Chanal (6). Of these, 143 patients accepted some form of intervention, but three patients were considered reluctant as they did not agree to move to the closest city to be treated. From 2004 through 2015, 487 interventions were carried out in Oxchuc (301), San Juan Cancuc (50), Tenejapa (56), Huixtán (67), and Chanal (13). Of the 487 patients involved, 146 had relapsed and those patients are still under supervision by the PEPCT. The 146 relapsing patients were distributed by age group as follows: 24 patients 65 years of age or under, 75 patients from 65 to 79 years old, and 47 patients of 80 years old and over. The most affected sex were females (71%). As for the increased frequency of interventions in the right or left eye, no significant difference was found.5\n\nDuring the period 2000–2015, the Mexico’s Directorate-General for Epidemiology recorded a total of 3868 known cases of trachoma, which 99.37% (3,844 cases) were confirmed and corresponded to the historically endemic focus of the state of Chiapas. The remaining 0.63% (24 suspected cases) reported by other States did not correspond to trachoma validated by epidemiological research which resulted in an annual average of 240.5 cases/year. It was concluded that trachoma in all its clinical forms had a clear and sustained decrease in Chiapas and in Mexico as a whole.5\n\nThe former focus has met the trachomatous trichiasis (TT) prevalence indicator for elimination as a public health problem, which is less than one “new” TT case per 1000 inhabitants of total population in the endemic area. In fact, a TT prevalence of zero “new” TT per 1000 inhabitants has been observed since 2005. From 2005 to the present, the communities of municipalities known historically to have trachoma have been monitored twice a year by the certified brigades of the PEPCT. As part of the monitoring program for known and “new” TT cases, the only municipality with a TT prevalence of over 1 “new” TT case per 1000 inhabitants is Oxchuc, while all others maintained a sustained prevalence below 1/1000.5"
