Geographic projection has straight meridians and parallels, each degree of latitude and longitude is the same size over the entire world map.

The orthographic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from infinite distance. It was already known to the Egyptians and Greeks more than 2,000 years ago. It gives the appearance of the Earth viewed from outer space. Only one hemisphere can be viewed at a time. The globe centered on Escuintla appears more realistic than almost any other projection.
