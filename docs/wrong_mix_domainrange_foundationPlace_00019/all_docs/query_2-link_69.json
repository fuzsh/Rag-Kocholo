Our Berkeley Hall Charitable Foundationâ€™s vision is to \"Make a difference by addressing the basic human needs of the greater Bluffton Community, especially those who are most vulnerable.\" Our vision has been brought to life through the generosity and commitment of the Berkeley Hall membership and the desire to make a difference in our community.\n\nThanks to the generosity of the Berkeley Hall community, the charitable foundation has raised more than $1.5 million for Bluffton area charities since its inception in 2008. Please check out the Berkeley Hall Charitable Foundation Grantees page to see the charities receiving grants in 2020.\n\nFor more information on the Foundation, visit www.berkeleyhallclub.com/charitable-foundation"
