        "text": "There were many gifts awaiting me when I was lucky enough to become Berkeley Rep’s artistic director. But one that we have the great fortune of all getting to share was the commission that the Theatre had made to the brilliant playwright, Christina Anderson. Commissions can be tricky – they’re a partial promise from a theatre to an artist, and vice versa. We say to a playwright, “Here’s some money to write something for us.” There is a window of time within which it is meant to be written, and then a separate period in which we as the theatre get to decide whether to produce it. Usually the theatre doesn’t specify what the play is meant to be about – sometimes there are conversations about topics or ideas that are of mutual interest; often not. So, good faith, high expectations, and uncertainty on all sides!\n\nSo imagine my delight upon arriving here to learn not only was there a commission to Christina, but it had resulted in this beautiful story. Christina had spent some time in our Ground Floor Summer Residency Lab, first by herself, ruminating on what story might want to be told, and then with director Jackson Gay in the summer of 2018, doing some early developmental work on ripple…. And then there was a new artistic director, which always creates uncertainty. And then there was a pandemic – more uncertainty, of the most profound kind. But in the midst of all that, I got to fall in love with this story of family, of politics, of legacy, and we committed to producing it. In addition to the beauty of Christina’s writing, the subject matter of this play feels like such a perfect fit for this community. Many of my peers who grew up here have been inspired by the activism of our parents’ generation. For example, I am incredibly proud of the work my mom and dad did in opposition to this country’s involvement in the Vietnam War, and have benefited from their labors in ways large and small. But we have also seen the ways in which political action has often come at some cost to the families of those on the front lines of change.\n\nLike many projects over the last couple of years, this play has had to be nimble – we have shifted it on our schedule multiple times as we have reshaped our calendars in response to COVID. Yet, as Christina said to me during rehearsals, it has always found its way. Like water.\n\nIt is a privilege to be on this journey with Christina, Jackson, this cast, creative team, crew, and staff. Thank you for sharing in it with us.\n\nWarmly,\n\nJohanna\n\nWelcome to your Berkeley Repertory Theatre and the premiere of Christina Anderson’s the ripple, the wave that carried me home. I am so excited to be joining this community and organization. I have long admired Berkeley Rep and have been enjoying getting to know the area, as I transition from New York City. My husband’s family lives in the Bay Area, and we just had our wedding in Sonoma County over Labor Day weekend (originally planned as a destination wedding, which turned into more of a homecoming).\n\nAlready, I know that I am becoming a part of something very special, and I hope you feel the same way, too. Berkeley Rep has an outstanding reputation as one of the country’s finest theatre companies with the highest-caliber writers, actors, directors, and designers working in the field today, and a fantastic resident staff of artists, technicians, craftspeople, administrators, and educators who create vibrant theatrical works for the benefit of the entire Bay Area and beyond. It is a distinct honor and privilege to steward and lead this organization in partnership with Artistic Director Johanna Pfaelzer and Berkeley Rep’s Board of Trustees. My heartfelt thanks go to the search committee and board, both led by Emily Shanks, for giving me this opportunity to make a significant contribution to an organization with such a strong tradition of excellence. I look forward to collaborating with Johanna and the entire Berkeley Rep team and to building and strengthening relationships and community throughout Berkeley and the Greater Bay Area, including with you!\n\nI plan to spend my first few months listening closely to what you want and need from Berkeley Rep. Your thoughts and ideas will inform my vision of what I can help the organization to accomplish. For those of you whom I have had the pleasure to meet thus far, thank you for the wonderful welcome. From my first encounters, I know that Berkeley Rep draws a smart and sophisticated audience interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the human condition, while having an enjoyable evening of entertainment.\n\nIf you are not yet a subscriber to Berkeley Rep, I encourage you to join us. In addition to guaranteeing yourself the best seats at the best prices, you will also be making memorable moments for yourself – nights out with your family or friends sharing fantastic stories told by first-rate artists. You will always be in great company. Subscribing is easy, flexible, and affordable. The only decisions to really make are that you want to enrich your life with the joy of live theatre and with whom you want to share these special memories.\n\nFrom all of us at Berkeley Rep, enjoy the show!\n\nTom Parrish\n\nManaging Director\n\nWhen we called Christina Anderson to ask if she’d be interested in writing a play for Berkeley Rep, she said she wanted to think about it. Even in its earliest embryonic moment, this piece came from a place of consideration, time, and breath. Unwilling to be rushed, refusing to be pressured, the story insisted on shaping itself in its own way on its own timeline.\n\nChristina talks about this play as a living entity. She says “I followed it” as often as she says “I wrote it.” An unusually long time passed between when Christina wrote the play and when it finally started rehearsals due to pandemic rescheduling, and in rehearsal Christina would often look at a line and say, “I wonder why I did that?” Someone would say, “Well, I think it’s x…” and Christina would respond, “Oh yeah! Past Christina was pretty smart!”\n\n“Past Christina” became another character in our rehearsal room, which felt pleasingly apt for a story that moves backward and forward through time. The play’s structure mimics the way memory works — not linear, but rather establishing its own intuitive logic where history, family, recollection, and emotion all weave together. The poetry of the language sits atop deep layers of craft, illuminating an intricate and interconnected web of ideas.\n\nFor example, if you watch the play with an ear toward the deceptively simple topic of names, you’ll start to notice some of the many ways the writing has seeded variations on a theme. The story focuses around a naming ceremony. We learn that our protagonist Janice’s present-day family consists of a husband and two sons — their names will continue, while Janice’s has been lost to patriarchy. The maternal branch of the family share a very famous last name: King (yet nowhere in the play is Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. mentioned, which feels intentional). Another King — Rodney King — features prominently in the storytelling. All of these Kings, both real and fictional, play crucial parts in the fight for Civil Rights, highlighting the invisible threads that connect all of us. One character has an archetype for a name: Young Chipper Ambitious Black Woman. We meet her very early on, letting us know that the world of this play might choose essence over realism at any time.\n\nEven the name of the play itself contains multitudes. You can’t see it in the font used to advertise the production (because it’s in all caps) but in fact, the title uses no capital letters at all: the ripple, the wave that carried me home. This gives us a huge amount of information before we even step inside the theatre, and in many ways shows us a microcosm of how the larger play functions. It invites us to look closely, to think, to be open to different layers of meaning. It tells us that the first letters aren’t more important here — all of the letters carry equal weight. The intriguing phrase also emphasizes water, points toward the passage of time, and implies a first-person narrative.\n\nThe writing distills vast ideas down to an elemental state and asks us to pay a different kind of attention. Even before the lights go down, Jackson Gay’s beautiful production suggests a key to unlock the experience: we begin by simply listening for three whole minutes before we ever see a person. We live in a noisy, cluttered world that can make it hard to remember how to focus for an extended period of time. The production encourages us to breathe into it — to pick up on the cues it offers us to slow down and savor this delicate, nuanced, jewel of a story.\n\nI can think of no better place to premiere this play about grassroots activism than Berkeley: a community built on the work of folks who know what it means to want something more for our nation and everyone in it, who believe a collective good does in fact exist. Sometimes activism shouts to the hills, and other times it inches forward almost undetected. The play is a love letter to people who sidestep the spotlight — who don’t seek fame or recognition or credit, but just quietly make things happen. Christina’s gorgeous writing points to the legacy of unglorified efforts by generations of women, Black women in particular, reminding us that the ripples of intangible contribution hold a deeply impactful kind of power and influence. With this piece, Christina has added her own unassuming resonance to the legacy she writes about. The profound subtlety and grace of her work could be easy to overlook, but for those it speaks to, it has so very much to say."
