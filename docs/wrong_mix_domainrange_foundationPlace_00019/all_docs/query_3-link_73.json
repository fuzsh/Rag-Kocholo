I’m perfect for a mellow home, where I’ll happily sit by your side as we enjoy each other’s company. I came from a big dog family and need a patient friend to help me build confidence and celebrate every little victory. I’m sweet and ready to be your adoring buddy, eager to explore the world beyond my old yard. An extra doggie friend would be icing on the cake! Visit the website of the Berkeley-East Bay Humane Society at berkeleyhumane.org to learn more and schedule a meeting with me.\n\n— Berkeley Humane\n\nFeisty 1-year-old Chili is a social butterfly.
