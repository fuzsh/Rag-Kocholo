        "text": "After more than four months of intensive organizing efforts, Berkeley Bowl workers rejected unionization effort in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)-supervised election Thursday.\n\nThe final tally was 119 to 70.\n\nMany of the union advocates who weren’t working when the results were announced left the store in shock, gathering outside as the news sunk in.\n\n“I’m not beat down over this,” said Kevin Meyer, one of the most involved pro-union employees. “We’ve done good work.”\n\nLea Hyke, the Berkeley Bowl’s Human Resource business partner, said she thought the vote was an accurate appraisal of the sentiment among employees.\n\n“While I don’t think we’ve been the best employer, we’re trying to work with employees,” she said. “I really think that the employees feel that the company is doing its best to take care of them.”\n\nMeyer and others union supporters attributed their defeat to a strong anti-union campaign.\n\n“I definitely think that if we had voted two weeks ago before their campaign I think it would have been different,” he said.\n\nBefore the decision to file for an election, the union had signed up 70 percent of the employees on union authorization cards. They said the steep decline in support could only have come from the company’s campaign.\n\nMeyer said he isn’t going to walk away and hopes the store pursues the changes it has promised employees.\n\n“If they want me to make the store a better place I’m willing to do it,” he said.\n\nThe announcement of the vote came the end of a day that for many had been characterized by nail-biting tension. Even though it was her day off, pro-union employee Cory Abshear arrived at the store at 6 a.m. and sat outside talking to employees or raced around town to track employees down and ensure they voted.\n\nThe day began with the pro-union side challenging the anti-union side’s choice for election observer. Meyer and Eric Freezell, the pro-union election observers, arrived with Abshear in the morning and met with the National Labor Relations Board representative, lawyers from each side and anti-union observer David Craibe to ensure that everyone was clear about the voting process. They immediately challenged Craibe, saying they disagreed with his classification as a non-supervisor.\n\nMeyer said that Craibe closes the store on Sundays, the store’s busiest day, which is a duty performed by a supervisor. He also said he had recently been reprimanded by Craibe during one of his shifts.\n\nIn a NLRB election only employees, not supervisors or managers, are eligible to vote, and one of the distinctions that defines a supervisor/manager is the ability to discipline employees.\n\nThe NLRB agreed with the challenge and Craibe was replaced by Kai Huey, the head of the store’s accounting department.\n\nDuring the vote both Meyer and Freezell, switching off as pro-union observers, challenged more than 20 of the votes, claiming they were cast by supervisors. They said that over the past few weeks as part of the store’s anti-union campaign, many store and department supervisors had been demoted to make them eligible to vote and increase the anti-union numbers.\n\n“Everyone I challenged was a supervisor,” said Meyer. “I had no question about it.”\n\nHe said one of those voting still had “supervisor” on his nametag and the tags of several other still bore the glue where the label “supervisor” had appeared only two days ago.\n\nA high point came for the pro-union side when Arturo Perez walked in and cast his ballot. Perez, one of the most outspoken supporters of the drive, was fired more than a month ago for what the store said were legitimate reasons but what organizers said was an attempt to silence him.\n\nPerez challenged the dismissal, and his case is pending—which meant that he was still affiliated with the store and thus eligible to vote.\n\nAfter the totals were announce Perez had to hold back tears and could only look at the store with frustration.\n\n“I’m going to win my case,” he said. “But I’m not going to go back. They don’t deserve people like me working for them to make them richer.”\n\nFRIDAY, OCT. 31\n\n“East Asia at Berkeley” a series of panel discussions covering historical, political and cultural topics, through Sunday, Nov. 2 at the Faculty Club, UC Campus.

But let’s hear some new suggestions also. Other cities have reduced crime and built community using neighborhood civilian patrols. Berkeley should consider this idea, and not just reject it out of hand as “how un-Berkeley can you be.” (Do Berkeleyans visiting Spain object to the Spanish “sereno,” the neighborhood night watchman?)\n\nAl Durrette\n\n•\n\nNO DIRE SITUATION\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI am responding to the Oct. 28 Daily Planet article, “Rosa Parks Test Scores Lag, School May Face Overhaul.” This is my sixth year as a parent at Rosa Parks School. We have many dedicated, experienced teachers and great staff. I feel that my children and I have benefited from the educational and social/cultural experience the school offers. We are fortunate to encompass many types of diversity at Rosa Parks. While the Academic Performance Index (API) formulated from standardized test scores may be one indicator of academic progress, it is no more than that. The results of several weeks of testing during the academic year tell but one piece of the story. Is it fair to penalize a school based solely on this one measure? What good could come of a complete restructure of our school? Why does the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation not focus on what all children truly need to succeed academically, socially and emotionally? In fact, to not be left behind? Youth welfare, education and family support are not prioritized as they should be to promote optimum well being in our society. Rosa Parks does not face a dire situation—the Berkeley Unified School District does, the State of California does and the United States of America does. Who is the laggard here?\n\nRebecca Herman\n\nRosa Parks School parent\n\n•\n\nROSA PARKS NOT FAILING\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI’m a parent of two students at Rosa Parks. My kids are doing great at this school, I mean great! They exceed the state standards and the national standards. They have friends of all colors, ethnicities, races. They get along well with the teachers and the students. Yet your article makes it sound like the school is drowning in chaos without any organized curriculum or commitment from parents, teachers or the administration. That is far from the truth. The whole issue over test scores and the “blame” that is being attributed to the school and indirectly to the teachers and Principal Shirley Herrera is completely out of line and misinterpreted by this article.\n\nFirst off, I’ve been involved there for six years. My daughter is in fifth grade and my son in second grade. My kids are doing exceptionally well and are high achievers and get excellent instruction from very committed teachers. The curriculum is very good and if my kids do their homework (by the way that’s the key) they do well in the testing. One of the challenges at Rosa Parks is reflected by the diversity and complexity of the demographics of the school. We have kids from all over the world—Africa, Russia, Turkey, China, Iceland, Mexico, Brazil, Pakistan, Iran, India and I could go on. We have parents adapting to the educational system and culture all at once. We have some households that have serious economic and social problems that make it very difficult for kids in a learning environment. All these things come together in our little world at Rosa Parks. And, no simple out-of-the-box solution works for all these kids or their parents in an “instant mix formula.”\n\nOn top of that we’ve gone through four principals in six years. This is very difficult for the teachers, the parents and most of all Principal Ms. Herrera. It takes more than one year to build a systematic approach to teaching that focuses on improving test scores, which they are trying to do. And, all the issues can’t be blamed on the school. Parents need to be involved with their kids learning that’s where the difference is made.\n\nThe perception of the article written by Jakob Schiller, although accurate in the statistical facts, in no way reflects the parents who commit themselves to volunteer work at the school, to the hard work done by the teachers and to new approaches to teaching the curriculum that may have a significant effect on the test scores over a period of years.\n\nTo come in to the school now, disrupt everything by bringing in a “major administrative overhaul” is absolutely absurd and shows no in-depth knowledge of the situation. It will have no immediate effect except to set back the progress that is being made right now.\n\nI encourage parents to check out this school for their kids entering kindergarten, to interview the teachers and talk with the principal you will see that this is a great place for an education and it’s only going to get better. What is needed is commitment and involvement, not broad, non-specific criticism based on statistics.\n\nSteven Donaldson\n\n•\n\nREPORTING THE TRUTH\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nGood for you Becky, I am so glad you didn’t back down to the demands of Patrick Kennedy. But most importantly I’m glad that you are a woman standing up to an arrogant business man who thought he could use a few big words like “libel” and “falsities.” I want to encourage you to continue to report the truth and not allow big business men to intimidate you.\n\nSheila Goodwin\n\n•\n\nCIRCLE OF VIOLENCE\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThis is pursuant to your front page article of Oct. 7 (and the ensuing letter to the editor of Oct. 28, by “Name Withheld”). The headline was “Telephone Bomb Threat Following Campus Debate” of Israel vs. Palestine, against a woman-journalist who was a Palestinian advocate. It specified “On Monday you better not be in your office...to kill everyone of you sons of bitches.” That Monday was Yom Kippur. Even a non-religious Jew would never plan to kill on the holiest Jewish Holiday, which, incidentally, is devoted to forgiveness.\n\nThe threat, therefore, was perpetrated by a non-Jew and was a device to garner public attention to vilify Israelis—and it was successful.\n\nDo you remember the “Yom Kippur War”? It was on that special day that Arab countries made the surprise attack on Israel, which resulted in exacerbating the situation dramatically.\n\nViolence begets violence, as we have regretfully witnessed. May the extremes on either side be laid to rest and not spill over the rest of the lands.\n\nIt is so deplorable that right now during the holy period of Ramadan the virulence of violence is not diminishing in Iraq.\n\nName also withheld\n\n•\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RACISM\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThank you for running an article (“Racism Plays Role in Environmental Decisions,” Daily Planet, Oct. 24-27) that deals with the very important and underreported subject of environmental racism. The locating of hazardous sites in communities of color has existed for quite some time. Race and economic status continue to play an important role in an individual’s exposure to dangerous environmental contaminants.\n\nWhy is it that “the effort to be fair in locating dangerous dumps and factories is simply a low priority,” as quoted in the article? Why is it that important information on the subject can be kept out of sight? This kind of practice can continue so long as those responsible continue to avoid accountability.\n\nWith clear and sound policies explicitly aimed at eliminating these disparities there is hope that a solution can be reached. So that government agencies can no longer pass the buck, it is important that some agency or organization have both the ability to gather information and the authority to enforce regulations regarding the location of hazardous sites. The recommendation that the EPA broaden its authority in order to do this is one possible first step.\n\nHow can we say that we are a society that cares about equality and human rights when people of certain race and economic status are disproportionately targeted for the health risks associated with dangerous exposures to pollutants?\n\nMichelle Loya-Talamantes\n\nStudent, School of Public Health, UC Berkeley\n\n•\n\nSTRAWBERRY CREEK\n\nDear City Manager,\n\nThe Friends of Strawberry Creek are writing to officials in the City of Berkeley to bring to your attention that any future construction at the current Berkeley Adult School (BAS) site on University Avenue must comply with Berkeley’s Creek Ordinance (Chapter 17.08 Preservation and Restoration of Natural Watercourses). We bring this to your attention because we have heard Michele Lawrence, the Superintendent of the Berkeley Unified School District (BUSD), claim that the district is not subject to this ordinance.\n\nAs you may know, a culverted portion of Strawberry Creek flows under the property on which the BAS now sits. The Creek Ordinance acknowledges that channelization of Berkeley’s creeks has had negative impacts on the watershed and that “streams and their riparian environment should be held as an important public asset in an increasingly endangered environment that provides an unusual urban ecological habitat with recreational and esthetic value” (Section 17.08.020, F). The ordinance goes on to say that “[i]t is in the interest of the City of Berkeley to encourage the removal of culverts and channels…and to restore natural watercourses whenever safely possible” (Section 17.08.020, H).\n\nThe city has given meaning to these findings by stating clearly and unequivocally that it intends to enforce the ordinance. Section 18.080.50 states in pertinent part “it is unlawful for any person, organization, institution, corporation or the City of Berkeley (emphasis added) to construct any structure…within thirty feet of the center line of any creek.” The only exemption provided in the ordinance is to the owner of a single family home who wishes to construct an addition. And even in this case, the conditions under which an exemption can be granted are very narrow.\n\nIt is the position of the Friends of Strawberry Creek that, should new construction take place on the grounds of the BAS, every effort should be undertaken to “daylight” the culverted portion of Strawberry Creek and that in no event should the BUSD be allowed to place any new buildings over the creek.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJanet Byron, President\n\nFriends of Strawberry Creek\n\n•\n\nHEALTHY FORESTS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nAs the fires in Southern California demonstrate, it is critical that we focus scarce federal resources in the areas where they will protect communities at risk. Unfortunately, President Bush’s so-called “Healthy” Forests Initiative, which the Senate may vote on this week, fails to adequately protect communities at risk from forest fires.\n\nIt places the care and upkeep of our National Forests in the hands of the logging industry, rather than our National Forest Service and the public, calling for fire prevention management by said industry.\n\nWill they really do the job, or simply log the biggest, oldest, most profitable, AND most fire-resistant trees, rather than the smaller unprofitable underbrush and saplings. The management of our forests cannot be placed in the hands of those who profit greatest from it; that makes no sense at all.\n\nIt also weakens environmental protections, interferes with the independent judiciary, and undermines public participation in decisions that affect our public lands. But the worst is that it authorizes logging of old growth fire-resistant trees, whose thick bark can stop fire. We need these old growth trees to act as a bulwark against catastrophic wildfires.\n\nTo protect lives and communities at risk from fire, Senators Feinstein and Boxer should vote against this deal and instead focus federal funding and resources on protecting communities at risk of catastrophic wildfire.\n\nSierra Barnes\n\nOakland\n\n•\n\nMARTYRDOM A CRIME?\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThe currency of journalism is clear language. But clarity of language requires clarity of thought, a fact that seems to have escaped the attention of many journalists. Euphemisms like “collateral damage” abound. Self-absorbed bias—friends are killed but enemies lose their lives—and fuzzy categories like “supporters of the former regime” may be unavoidable but should be kept to a minimum.\n\n“Terrorist” is one of the most used words in journalists’ lexicon. A terrorist act is a crime and so we are led to believe that a terrorist is a criminal. Are journalists self-serving, servile or just plain lazy to habitually refer to suicide bombers as terrorists? Such labeling inexcusably denies the fact that to his countrymen the suicide is a martyr.\n\nWhy is martyrdom ennobling for us but impossible for our enemies?\n\nIf a person wants to spread fear then suicide is an extreme and stupid way to do it. Suicide is not done solely for the purpose of terrorizing. Were it so we’d have to interpret Patrick Henry’s famous cry, “I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!” as an endorsement of terrorism.\n\nFinally, referring to suicide bombers as terrorists implicitly ignores the central fact of Jesus’ life. According to St. John’s Gospel, Chapter 15, verse13, “Greater love than this hath no man, that he lay down his life for his friends.”\n\nMarvin Chachere\n\nSan Pablo\n\n•\n\nXXXXXXXXXX\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThe depth of the tragedy in Southern California cannot be imagined. Thousands of homes destroyed. 17 people dead so far. Governor Davis is doing everything he possibly can to help. Where is Arnold? According to Yahoo News and Alternet, he is in Nevada congratulating Mr. Olympus and in Washington congratulating Mr. Shrub.\n\nMost of the communities destroyed by this horrible plague apparently voted overwhelmingly for Schwarzenegger. Why isn’t he out on the front lines a la Mayor Guiliani—consoling his fan club and urging the sleep-deprived firefighters on? Apparently, Arnold prefers to hobnob with Republicans in Washington, the same people who are now infamous among firefighters throughout America for slashing “big government” aid that would have kept our fire departments strong. Bush and Co. have made every effort in the past two years to downsize the very firefighters who are now California’s front line defense against the “worst natural disaster of the century.”\n\nAnd these are the people that Arnold is asking to aid us now?\n\nThe results of the California recall elections aren’t all that set in stone. They have not yet been certified and are, in reality, uncertifiable until the Secretary of State can examine Diebold’s software for irregularities—an act which Diebold has declared to be a felony activity. (Since when has vote verification become a felony?) In addition, at least 9% of L.A county’s punchcard ballots are questionable.\n\nAs a citizen of California, I demand a recount. And I also demand that Arnold Schwarzenegger stop fiddling around while SoCal burns!\n\nJane Stillwater\n\nA prominent Berkeley contractor has been cited for 17 violations of California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal-OSHA) regulations from their renovation of a Hayward commercial building, including the improper removal, handling, and dumping of asbestos material.\n\nIf Kimes Morris Construction company does not win its appeal to the Cal-OSHA Appeals Board, it faces fines of nearly $36,000.\n\nA decision on the 15-year-old firm’s appeal, which was held during a three-day hearing before an Administrative Law Judge in Oakland earlier this month, is not expected for several weeks.\n\nKimes Morris advertises itself as “developers and builders of commercial, residential and mixed-use community friendly buildings in the Berkeley area.” The Hayward building is part-owned by Coastal View Associates, a separate company owned by Kimes Morris owners Andrew Kimes and James Morris.\n\nAn attorney representing Kimes Morris in the Cal-OSHA appeal said this week that the company had no prior knowledge of the presence of asbestos in the building, and said the contractors immediately corrected the problems as soon as they were brought to the company’s attention.\n\n“Kimes Morris regrets what happened out there,” said Attorney Fred Walter of the Walter Law Firm of Healdsburg, occupational safety and health law experts who represented Kimes Morris at the appeals board hearing. They have accepted that there was asbestos there, Walter said. “They have accepted all of the citations for asbestos exposure and the failure to [take proper precautions]. The one thing that they are adamantly set against is the allegation that what they did was deliberate. That’s not the way they’ve done business. That’s not the way they treat their workers. And they’re pissed off.”\n\nThe asbestos removal violations, which Cal-OSHA inspectors said occurred in November and December, 2001, and early January, 2002, were discovered by landfill operators after Kimes Morris workers disposed of asbestos-laden building waste in a dumpster next to the building.\n\nSome of the violations involved failure by the company to provide workers with proper respiratory protection and failure to use cleanup methods that would keep asbestos dust from escaping into the air. Walter estimated that “10 or 12” workers were exposed to the asbestos without adequate protection for as short a period of “a few days” and as long as a month. The workers were regular Kimes Morris employees.\n\nThe violations were originally reported to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which notified Cal-OSHA. After renovation of the building was shut down by Cal-OSHA in March of last year, Kimes Morris subcontracted the asbestos removal to a company specializing in that field, and renovations to the building have since been completed.\n\nThe most damaging findings made by Cal-OSHA against Kimes Morris was that as part owner of the Hayward building, the contractors should have known about the presence of the asbestos before the renovations began. The other part-owner of the building, Richard A. Fishman, was informed of the presence of asbestos in an environmental survey released to him in January of 2001.\n\nCal-OSHA inspectors also charged that Kimes Morris should have known how to properly handle asbestos removal because of the company’s past experience in demolition/renovation of a building containing asbestos. Kimes Morris was hired by Berkeley developer Patrick Kennedy’s Panoramic Interests company to tear down the building that paved the way for the Artech Building on Milvia Street.\n\nWhile admitting that the company violated asbestos safety regulations, Walter denied the charges that Kimes Morris knew about the presence of asbestos in the building and intentionally violated the regulations.\n\nWalter said that the allegation that Kimes Morris knew about both the regulations and the presence of asbestos and then willfully sent workers into a potentially dangerous situation is “almost laughable. They’re just making the assumption that somebody who’s been in any kind of construction for fifteen years will know what to do when you walk into a building of a particular age.”\n\n“More than 95 percent of [Kimes Morris’] work has been new construction,” Walter continued. “The remaining two to five percent has been in remodeling. They only contracted for the demolition of the building that was in place of where the Artech Building is now. They were advised by that demo contractor that they would have to do asbestos abatement there. They coordinated the [asbestos] abatement work, but it was all done administratively from their office. Kimes Morris arranged for an abatement contractor to go in and do the abatement [at the Milvia Street site]. They didn’t do the abatement themselves. The Hayward building was the first time that [Kimes Morris has] done demolition work themselves.”\n\n“Both Andy [Kimes] and Jim [Morris] saw the building [before it was renovated], but did not realize that there was a potential for asbestos. It didn’t cross their minds. They’re too new to demolition work to have appreciated the dangers their employees were facing. They went ahead and did the work. In the middle of it, there was discovered there was asbestos.”\n\nAs for the January, 2001 environmental report given to the Hayward building’s co-owner, Richard Fishman, Walter said that Fishman testified at the appeals hearing that he “never cracked it, never looked at it, filed it away, and never mentioned it to anybody, including Jim [Kimes] and Andy [Morris] when they became partners in the building.”\n\nA statewide coalition on immigrant workers rights has charged Kimes Morris with discrimination against immigrant workers in the Hayward asbestos case, citing its allegation that all of the workers improperly exposed to the asbestos were Guatemalan and Mexican immigrants.\n\n“Immigrant workers get hired [all the time] to do the dirtiest jobs in our society...for minimal pay and with blatant disregard for their health and safety,” Antonio Belmonte, a spokesperson for Working Immigrant Safety and Health (WISH), said in a prepared press statement. “Employers take advantage of Latino workers like those who don’t speak English and are desperate for any work they can get.” Belmonte works in the Labor Occupational Health Program at UC Berkeley.\n\nWalter refuted the allegation that “these are a couple of white contractors making victims of immigrant workers. Andy Kimes is part-Indian. He spent ten years living in Costa Rica doing subsistence farming after he graduated from UCLA as an economics major. He speaks Spanish fluently. The employees who testified at the hearing all were earning between $18 and $24 an hour, and all were receiving Kaiser benefits from the company. So for Mr. Belmonte to imply that Kimes Morris is giving these people minimal pay and blatantly disregarding their health and safety is just a failure of his own to check his facts.” Walter said that while the employee pay on the Hayward building job was “a little bit below union scale, it ain’t peanuts.”\n\nWalter said that “part of the undercurrent of the decision by OSHA to cite this one citation as willful is the idea that [OSHA] jumped to the conclusion that Kimes Morris was taking advantage of Latino workers who don’t speak English, are desperate for work, and will do anything that the employer tells them to do. In truth, none of that applies to Kimes Morris Construction.”\n\nBreathing asbestos particles can cause mesothelioma, an invariably fatal form of lung cancer that can take decades to develop.\n\nConsidering unusual places to see fine art in Berkeley?\n\nMaybe it’s time to visit the Faculty Club on the university campus.\n\nWhile it’s not a formal art gallery or museum, the club contains a growing display of permanent and historic art works, and also features intriguing temporary exhibits of art.\n\nIn recent years, the main corridor has been used as a small gallery for changing art exhibits. The displays include paintings in oil or other media, watercolors, photographs, or other forms of visual art. All the exhibitors are associated with the Club as members or affiliates.\n\nThe art displays change monthly and are generally very accomplished, although there’s an occasional exhibit demonstrating more enthusiasm than talent. Styles range from traditional to quite contemporary and avant garde. Many of the artists are also noted scholars.\n\nElsewhere in the Club, several pieces of permanent art—some of them incorporated into the architecture—are on display.\n\nFor example, in the O’Neill Room there’s a wonderful 1929 fresco by faculty member Ray Boynton showing a stylized view up Campanile Way, the Berkeley Hills beyond, and two golden allegorical nudes holding the sun and moon, respectively.\n\nIn the Howard Lounge a relief sculpture of the Greek Theatre honors the university’s supervising architect, John Galen Howard. The artwork was created in 1955 by Jacques Schnier, who also did the monumental “St. George and the Dragon” sculpture on the northwest corner of Berkeley High School.\n\nIn the Club’s Great Hall stained glass panels depict emblems of major universities with which Cal faculty have felt particular affinity, including Stanford, represented by a redwood tree on a vivid red and white background. Bernard Maybeck’s carved animal-head beams, constructed a century ago, flank the glass panels.\n\nThe Club also has on display a number of prints and commemorative portraits by various artists, as well as several intriguing paintings by early 20th century professor Perham Nahl. In the words of the Club’s art historian, Phyllis Brooks, “Isadora-style young women dance and toss billiard balls to each other in a woodsy setting” across two murals Nahl did in the Heyns Room. Although no clear explanation of the paintings survives in Club records, it is known that billiards was a popular activity amongst early members.\n\nThe permanent art collection at the Faculty Club was significantly expanded this fall with several important paintings by Berkeley faculty. Collectively called “The Berkeley School Collection, 1930-1950,” the paintings are gifts of several donors brought together by Professor of Art Emeritus Karl Kasten.\n\n“With Karl’s help we amassed a wonderful group of pictures,” says Brooks. The paintings are now all hung together in the Club’s O’Neill Room, creating a mini-gallery in the midst of the campus.\n\nVisual art has a long but somewhat unsettled heritage at Berkeley. Drawing was taught from the university’s early years, but typically as a skill necessary for practical subjects such as mechanical engineering, architecture, and even agriculture and military training.\n\nThree local notables—architect Bernard Maybeck, artist and writer Gelett Burgess, later famous for his “Purple Cow” rhyming, and Ross Brower, father of environmentalist David Brower—were UC drawing instructors at various points in those early years.\n\nThe arrival of German-born painter Eugene Neuhaus finally began to establish a precarious formal foothold for the practice and teaching of fine art on the campus. Neuhaus would also later serve as a Faculty Club president.\n\nIn 1923, he convinced the university administration to establish an art department. By that decade, according to Kasten, “California had to assert itself as not only a producer but a trainer of artists.”\n\nA decade later Neuhaus made another pivotal contribution to Berkeley when he suggested that the obsolete brick powerhouse on campus just east of Sather Gate be turned into an art venue. The resulting University Art Gallery conceived and hosted small scale but notable exhibits for more than 30 years.\n\nAs inevitably happens in the art world, however, Neuhaus and his colleagues were ultimately displaced by a younger group of artists who viewed the established faculty as outdated traditionalists and took over leadership of the Berkeley painting scene from the 1930s through the 1950s.\n\nThe accomplishments of that period drew the attention of a banquet hall full of alumni, faculty, and friends going nearly back to the beginning—the mid-1930s, in some cases—who gathered at the Faculty Club on Thursday, Oct. 23, to honor the donation of the artworks and the 80th anniversary of the department.\n\nWine glasses in hand, guests admired the small exhibit of paintings then sat down to dinner in Maybeck’s Great Hall accompanied by a slideshow by Kasten, recalling his graduate school and early faculty days at Berkeley.\n\nIn a three-decade period, Kasten said, beginning in the late 1920s when Worth Ryder joined the faculty, the Department of Art struck out in new directions, eventually cohering into what became known as the Berkeley School of painting.\n\n“Time is constantly modifying the views we have of artists,” Kasten observes. “The Berkeley School became less immediately important to a later generation moving more and more to abstraction and expressionism. But time also brings reassessment and the reputation of the Berkeley School and its followers is once again rising.”\n\nOne of Ryder’s pivotal actions was bringing modernist German painter Hans Hoffman—with whom he’d studied in Germany—to the Berkeley campus as a guest instructor.\n\nHoffman had two important impacts. First, he inspired several local painters. Later, in the 1960s, Hoffman, grateful for the opportunity the University extended to him in the 30s to work outside Nazi Germany, willed the university a large number of his paintings that became the nucleus of the university’s modern Berkeley Art Museum.\n\nIn the art department’s early days, Kasten said, the “Berkeley School” was facetiously called the “One Hair School” by some San Francisco artists because of the delicate lines many of the Berkeley painters incorporated in their work with fine hair brushes.\n\nIn friendly retaliation “the Berkeley people referred to the San Francisco crowd as the ‘Big Feet School’ because they were following Diego Rivera,” whose paintings and murals often featured figures with oversized appendages.\n\nAmong the Berkeley faculty at the time was Professor Chiura Obata “a great teacher with real sensitivity,” Kasten said. One of the first non-white members of the Berkeley faculty, the Japanese-born Obata was interned by the government during World War II, but later returned to Berkeley.\n\nOne of Obata’s paintings, a delicate filigree of peach-colored rhododendron blossoms, is now included in the Faculty Club collection. Other painters featured in the permanent exhibit are faculty members James McCray, Erle Loran, John Haley, Kasten himself, and graduate student Mary Dumas.\n\nSeveral of their paintings show Berkeley scenes, such as Haley’s 1932 view of the Church of the Good Shepherd in West Berkeley and Loran’s “The Berkeley Campus,” a lush view of the 1940s landscape north of the Life Sciences Building. All the artworks now adorn the walls of the O’Neill Room.\n\n“The Faculty Club is one of the jewels of the campus and another jewel is now the room in which the paintings reside”, says Brooks.\n\nIn one corner of the room a vivid red and black Cubist-inspired portrait by Margaret Peterson stands out. Peterson, like Obata, had a bittersweet connection to the Berkeley campus; in 1949-50, she left her teaching job as one of those who refused on principle to sign the University’s McCarthy-era anti-Communist Loyalty Oath.\n\nBut now, as with the other artists, one of her artworks has a permanent home on the campus.\n\n(SIDEBAR – INFORMATION ON VISITING THE FACULTY CLUB)\n\nAlthough the very name “Faculty Club” perhaps conjures images of aloof inaccessibility, the 101-year-old Berkeley campus institution is anything but.\n\nYou don’t need to be a Club member to eat there and the meals are remarkably affordable.\n\nYou can purchase a sandwich or generous buffet lunch on a weekday and eat informally on an outdoor terrace or at one of the sturdy wooden tables in Maybeck’s Great Hall, since 1903 a gathering place for the intellectual giants of the university (they eat sandwiches, too). Or you can have lunch or dinner in the elegant, white tablecloth Kerr Dining Room, overlooking Faculty Glade. There’s also a cozy bar.\n\nGuests referred by members or campus departments can stay in the hotel rooms upstairs at the Club, and the Club’s rooms are also available for rental for meetings and special events. The Club has become a popular place for weekend weddings.\n\nFor information on hours, policies and meal service, call the Club’s front desk at 540-5678 or visit its website at http://berkeleyfacultyclub.com. If you wish to see the O’Neill Room art display, please check at the front desk for directions to the room and to make sure it isn’t in use for a meeting. A description of the Club’s artworks, written by Phyllis Brooks, is also available for $1 at the front desk.\n\nThe craftsman-style Faculty Club is located on the UC Berkeley campus, on the eastern edge of Faculty Glade just south of Strawberry Creek. Don’t confuse it with the nearby Women’s Faculty Club—another elegant and venerable campus establishment—that stands to its east.\n\nBerkeley scored a victory against the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), after a regional regulatory board ordered the lab to implement the highest possible standards to clean up contaminated groundwater at its Berkeley Hills campus.\n\nAt a community forum on the cleanup Tuesday evening, the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Water Quality Control Board—acting on a written request from the city—announced that it will order the lab to reduce contamination to levels allowable for drinking water—a standard lab officials say might be impossible to achieve.\n\n“The public got a good deal today,” said Berkeley Hazardous Materials Supervisor Nabil Al-Hadithy, attending the forum sponsored by the State Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)—which will supervise the cleanup.\n\nIn recent years, the water board has lowered standards for cleanups, allowing municipalities and other entities to decontaminate areas that pose a public health risk, but not requiring them to return the polluted groundwater to drinking standards.\n\nAlthough they found that the contaminants buried underneath the lab pose little threat to the surrounding community, the water board sided with Berkeley, holding that restoring groundwater to drinking standards would benefit the community.\n\nThe city’s victory was not total, however. The DTSC, which has final say over the cleanup of contaminated soil, will permit a risk-based decontamination—meaning that the lab will can ignore the majority of the sites where cancer risks are minuscule.\n\nResidents at the meeting cheered the Water Board ruling, but criticized the lab for not giving more input into the cleanup process and for ignoring the nuclear waste which they claim also lies in the soils and waters underneath the lab.\n\nAl-Hadithy and residents also questioned whether the lab’s overseers in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) would pay for the more thorough cleanup sought by the water board. Hemant Patel, a project manager at the DOE, said he expected Congress to allocate about $3.5 million annually through 2006, which he said should be enough to meet the drinking water target.\n\nMost of the chemical contamination at the 71-year-old lab occurred decades ago, before hazardous waste disposal laws enacted in the 1970s ended indiscriminate dumping of toxic chemicals on the lab’s 200-acre campus.\n\nFor the past 10 years the lab—which conducts research in physics, biology, geology and chemistry—has worked to identify contaminated areas, brainstorm ways to decontaminate the sites and perform some cleanups.\n\nNow, with the DOE requiring the lab to have all cleanup mechanisms in place by 2006, LBNL has until May to present for DTSC approval a plan to perform the requisite soil and groundwater remediation. Approval is expected to take about a year following a public comment period—leaving the lab roughly a year and a half to perform the cleanup.\n\nDTSC scientists at Tuesday’s meeting asserted that lab employees and visitors face no health risks, but acknowledged that some contaminated soils and groundwater plumes would have to be cleaned.\n\nOf the 29 contaminated soil sites, DTSC required cleanup at the four sites where the theoretical cancer risk was rated above 100 cases per million, the common standard used for “institutional” properties.\n\nThe water board mandated that groundwater be cleaned to a higher standard: a theoretical cancer risk of 1 incident per 100 million. Under that benchmark, the lab will have to restore 11 of the 13 contaminated sites to drinking water standards.\n\nAlthough the city sought equally strict standards for both surface and ground water cleanups, Al-Hadithy said that groundwater poses a greater health risk because it slowly migrates downhill from the lab towards residential areas and is more difficult to manage if not cleaned up.\n\nGroundwater at the site is not used for human consumption, but the city had argued that in case of emergency or for future uses at the site, the community would benefit from being able to tap the groundwater for public use.\n\nThe decision of the water board surprised city officials, who feared that with federal cleanup money dwindling, the water board would hold the lab to less rigorous standards.\n\nIn 1996, the water board pioneered a relaxed cleanup standard—quickly adopted nationally—that allowed localities to pave over contaminated soils and groundwater to isolate them from human contact, rather than paying for costlier decontamination. Under those standards, Emeryville famously sealed huge plots of contaminated land as sites for shopping centers over them.\n\nThe DTSC only has jurisdiction over chemical pollution, infuriating neighbors who insist that nuclear contamination—which falls under the authority of the DOE—also poses serious health risks.\n\n“They should have combined the chemical and radioactive information into one document,” said Pamela Shivola of the Committee to Minimize Toxic Waste, which has attempted to monitor lab activity for years. “We’ve received only a partial picture only analyzing a partial risk.”\n\nDTSC toxicologist Calvin Willhite replied that there was no scientific data to support a synchronistic effect between chemical and radioactive waste in soils or groundwater.\n\nNeighbors questioned claims by lab officials about the Summary of Radionuclide Investigations approved by the DOE in September, which held that there was no need to cleanup nuclear material in the soil, much of it produced from years of testing tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen.\n\nShivola said she has never been made aware of the lab’s study, which officials say is available for review at the public library.\n\nA senior scientist who requested anonymity said that tritium levels in the soil and groundwater around the lab are within acceptable standards, but that purifying some of the chemically contaminated groundwater sites to drinkable standards would be impractical.\n\n“If you spent the whole budget of the United States you cannot clean all of this,” he said. “We will attempt it but we will prove that it is impossible.”\n\nMost of the chemicals are solvents used to remove grease, he said.\n\nDepending on how you look at things, it’s either a wonderful or a terrible time to be an independent filmmaker.\n\nOn the one hand, Indies have never been bigger, with the massive commercial success of movies like My Big Fat Greek Wedding and the Blair Witch Project.\n\nBut success breeds imitation, and nowadays it seems like everyone with a digital camera is making an Indie. In a crowded field it is frustratingly difficult to find an audience for your flick, a feeling made unbearable other filmmakers go blithely Sundancing their way to riches and acclaim.\n\nThe elemental human urge to tell a story is about one second older than the urge to have that story heard and declared magnificent. It’s hard not to worry that the world contains more storytellers than audience members.\n\nLuckily for these cinematic strivers (and for those of us who love to watch movies), there is the Berkeley Video and Film Festival, a modest but energetic celebration of independent filmmaking that gives a few talented filmmakers their moment in the sun.\n\nSixty-five of these have been chosen for inclusion and will be screened in an eye-popping orgy of cineastic bliss, twelve hours a day from noon until midnight.\n\nDon’t worry about how nice it is outside; November sunshine is more than you deserve, frankly, and you really ought to be hunkered down in a dark room, hoovering popcorn like there’s famine afoot.\n\nThe strength of this festival lies with the documentary films. In an era when tagging along on a stranger’s unpleasant first date qualifies as reality footage, these well-conceived, deeply felt investigations are particularly moving. While there is no requirement that the films have a Bay Area theme, many of them do, and the chance to see our home from a different perspective is much appreciated.\n\nBounce: The Don Barksdale Story features one of the first black players in the NBA, a former Berkeley High Yellowjacket who distinguished himself in athletics, radio, business, and philanthropy.\n\nThe footage of Berkeley in the 1930s is arresting, and interviews with Barksdale’s basketball descendants (and Bay Area locals) Jason Kidd and Gary Payton show just how valuable it is to turn away from the present and recall one’s progenitors.\n\nIn general the documentaries tend to be activist, focusing on themes familiar to Berkeley viewers. There are two films that focus on opposition to the war on terror, one about the Black Panthers, one on the horrors of animal trapping and, of course, the obligatory Holocaust documentary.\n\nSuffice it to say that the fact that separate documentaries about nudists both won Best of Festival Awards firmly locates this collection of films here in the Land of the Free (Speech Movement).\n\nThe best documentary (and possibly the best film of the entire festival) is Brothers on Holy Ground, an enormously affecting piece about the psychological aftermath of 9/11. Director Mike Lennon chooses to focus not on the horrible footage that we all now involuntarily replay in our own minds, but on the unscripted words of the survivors. In these raw interviews we see a young firefighter drowning with guilt over his decision to swap seats on the engine with a buddy, a chance event that left one man dead and the other standing on a downtown street, covered with ashfall and awash in misery.\n\nLennon eschews the maudlin tone and imperious politicizing common to many 9/11 documentaries, focusing instead on the quiet rhythms of lives interrupted, the way a fireman calmly chops celery for a firehouse lunch as he muses about the violence of the job and the agony of losing one’s closest friends.\n\nFortunately, the festival is not all portentous and important. The presence of animation, short comedies, music videos and even public service announcements gives the mind a bit of a yawn and a stretch before settling back down to the heavy lifting.\n\nThese shorter efforts can be quite winning, allowing the viewer brief dips into the delightfully addled minds of a variety of talented filmmakers. In Lost and Found for example, an odd little man insists that a sculptor has stolen his dentures, and the interaction between the two men borders on the surreal.\n\nYoung producers offer short films with whimsical names like Egyptian Rat War and subject matter such as an insect’s reaction to high culture.\n\nThe music videos are also visually compelling, especially The Dive which was shot underwater and then hand-colored frame by frame for a unique look.\n\nThere’s even a big name hiding among the short pieces—Eminem’s video White America, which was produced and directed by the local Guerilla News Network. It’s an excellent video; the graphics are simple and powerful, and Eminem’s lyrics are, as always, refreshingly self-aware and unsentimental.\n\nIf anything, the video is too good in the context of the other films; Eminem’s star power and overwhelming marketing machinery feels a little unfair, like Shaquille O’Neal stopping by the Berkeley Y for a pickup game.\n\nWithout the aid of an intravenous feeding tube and a vampiric love of the dark, there’s simply no way to see all of the movies on offer here. Viewers will have to look deeply into themselves and make tough decisions.\n\nWill you see Temptation, the Grand Festival Award winner, a lighthearted feature film about new-age pornographers—please, it’s erotica, not porn!—or will you stick with uplifting and earnest by picking the foot-stomping fun of Los Zafiros, a dance through the raucous world of Cuban music?\n\nHowever you choose, you’re bound to see a few stinkers. But the joy is in the hunt, and there are diamonds littered throughout this field.\n\nIt’s a fine time to be an independent film watcher, and the Berkeley Video and Film Festival has done an impressive job of collecting compelling movies that may mark the emergence of big time talent.\n\nThe festival runs from noon until midnight this Saturday and Sunday, Nov. 1 and 2. Tickets and show times can be found at www.berkeleyvideofilmfest.org and the movies will be shown at Wheeler Auditorium on the UC campus.\n\nFollowing a heated five-hour sentencing hearing Tuesday, three UC Berkeley students—Michael Smith, Snehal Shingavi and Rachel Odes—are waiting to learn what, if any, punishments the university will mandate for their actions during a March 23 campus anti-war protest.\n\nAfter hearing proposed punishments from campus Judicial Officer Neal Rajmaira and a spirited defense from the students, a panel of professors, staff and students has one week to draw up a letter spelling out its own recommendations to Dean of Students Karen Kenney. Once the recommendations are submitted, the students will be able to make an appeal before Kenney decides what, if any, punishments the students will receive.\n\nDuring an earlier hearing on Oct. 14, all three students were found responsible for one count each of disturbing the peace and non-compliance with the directives of a university officer, violations of the student code of conduct.\n\nShingavi and Odes could receive 20 hours of community service and a letter of warning in their file that would be reported should the students apply for a government job or waive their rights to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Smith, who was also found to have committed a third and separate violation of resisting a university officer, faces a one-semester suspension that would start next spring.\n\nRajmaira said the suggested penalties fall within a range where a nonreportable letter of warning—one that isn’t reported to law enforcement or governmental agencies—is the mildest penalty and full expulsion the most severe.\n\nFrom the onset, the students have called the disciplinary proceedings unfair and unwarranted. They denounced the recommended punishments Tuesday, charging that the university is trying to railroad them for a peaceful event.\n\nThe students have drawn support from across the country, and activists signed a full page ad that ran in the Daily Californian’s Monday edition. One signatory, Green party gubernatorial candidate Peter Camejo, spoke at a press conference before Monday’s hearing, accompanied by Rachel Ode’s mother, Jackie McGlamery.\n\n“The U.S. is in violation of international law,” Camejo said, “and I’m here to say that the university should respect international law. These students are trying to defend the Constitution and international law and should be given medals, not expelled.”\n\nDuring Tuesday’s hearing, the three students vigorously challenged the proposed punishments, and complained that the university had violated their right to due process by not giving them sufficient time to mount an adequate defense for the earlier hearing. They were also challenged the university’s decision to press charges stemming from a peaceful event that they said the university knew about well in advance.\n\nOne witness the students called Tuesday was Marcia Riley, Director of Student Group Administration for the Office of Student Life. She testified that she had talked to protest organizers “at least half a dozen times,” before the event, adding that she had seen several sit-ins in the past and that “this one was not more disruptful than others.”\n\nShingavi, a veteran campus organizer, said he thought more preparation and communication had gone into the planning for the protest than for any other in the past 20 years.\n\n“I’ve been arrested five times for political protest, and the precedent for sit-ins in the past has been a letter of warning/no report,” said Shingavi, who said that the university was trying unfairly to make examples of the students.\n\nShingavi derided the university for capitalizing on its image as the home of the free speech movement while prosecuting students for peaceful protests.\n\n“It baffles me that the university is willing to go after three protesters while no other university across the country is doing the same thing,” he said. “It will speak volumes to how this university has changed in 30 years if the convictions are handed down.”\n\nMore than 4,000 students appeared for the March event on the steps of Sproul Hall, called to protest the beginning on the American war on Iraq. The arrests began after 400 of the students entered the hall a sit-in.\n\nTuesday’s hearing grew heated when Rajmaira accused Smith of participating in a “racially motivated” incident two years ago where—Rajmaira claimed—Smith had been arrested by Berkeley officers after confronting a group of Asian men. Rajmaira called the event “a very serious case,” and cited it as the principal reason for increasing Smith’s punishment beyond the letter of warning and community service he recommended for the others.\n\nAn angry Smith called Rajmaira’s characterization of the incident “untrue, offensive and disgusting.”\n\n“It is true that I was involved in a fight off campus,” said Smith, who said he had confronted not the Asian men but the officer—who he thought was harassing the Asians. He said Rajmaira’s version of the incident proved “that [the university] is going to go after us in any way to railroad us. It shows that [Mr. Rajmaira] is not interested in the truth.”\n\nThe tribunal then retreated into a closed-door session in which tribunal members examined the university report and consulted both sides. When the panel re-emerged, they voted to reject Rajimira’s account of the incident.\n\nBoth sides continued to exchange words over the incident, with the students accusing Rajmaira of introducing the allegation in an effort to railroad the defendants and lambasting him for trying to label Smith a racist.\n\nRajmaira responded in an equally hostile tone, “I’m not backing off one bit from what I think these records indicate.”\n\nAt that point, panel chair and Physics Professor Burt Jacobson raised his hand to silence both sides.\n\nThe three students also questioned the process used to single them out for punishment. When they cross-examined Rajmaira’s assistant, he said the three had been singled out for punitive action after he checked the records of all 119 students originally arrested at the protest and found that only Odes, Smith, Shingavi and one other student (who later accepted a plea bargain) had prior offenses.\n\nThat question proved compelling enough to convince Jacobson to propose conducting his own independent records check to make certain that the three hadn’t been unfairly targeted—but he quickly learned that his inquiry might be derailed by issues of student privacy.\n\nThe hearing closed after both sides finished their arguments and rebuttals and Jacobson announced that the panel would issue its recommendations in one week.\n\nMost of the small crowd of spectators quickly departed, leaving the room to the three students and a few supporters, who engaged in a spirited discussion of what had just happened.\n\n“I knew beforehand the university was going after us and that they wanted a conviction instead of the truth,” Smith said. “But I’m a little flabbergasted at the tactics [Rajmaira] used.”\n\nShingavi agreed. “The arrogance of Rajmaira betrays the university’s idea that this is not a vendetta,” he said.\n\nOdes was more positive, saying that she thought the hearing allowed the students to make their case—but he agreed that they were under attack. “It proves how much they want to convict us,” she said.\n\nRajmaira told a reporter he “was happy both sides were able to appear and I am awaiting the panels’ findings and recommendations.”\n\nBerkeley school district officials are preparing for discussions on an administrative overhaul for Rosa Parks Elementary School, after standardized test scores released last week showed that student performance declined.\n\n“It behooves us to start looking,” said Carla Bason, BUSD’s manager of state and federal programs.\n\nNo administrative shakeup is imminent.\n\nMost parents taking their children to school this week said it was the standardized testing system, not the school, that was really failing the students.\n\nResults of the latest rounds of tests mandated under President Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act have thrust Rosa Parks into year three of a mandated program improvement regime, requiring the district to implement at least one of several corrective actions ranging from staff replacement to implementation of a new curriculum.\n\nThe law requires substantial reforms for schools that fail to make what it defines as “Adequate Yearly Progress” on standardized tests for several years in a row, with each year bringing stiffer requirements.\n\nIf Rosa Parks fails to meet state standardized test score goals next year, the district will be required to draft a plan to overhaul the school—which could include reopening it as a charter, contracting out management to a private company or a state takeover. The district would have the entire 2004-05 school year to submit the plan.\n\nThe state would give BUSD discretion in drafting any plan, said Maria Reyes of the California Department of Education’s Title I Policy and Partnership Office. “It’s up to the district to do what they think is best,” she said. “I don’t think we’re going to second guess.”\n\nReyes said a plan for alternative governance would not force the replacement of second-year principal Shirley Herrera, who parents have praised for bringing stability to the school after four consecutive years with four different principals.\n\nRosa Parks first entered the program improvement track in the 1997-98 school year, Reyes said, after district tests showed lagging scores. To escape the process, the school must make “adequate yearly progress” for two consecutive years—which includes meeting state graduation and test participation rates, meeting mandated goals on math and reading proficiency tests and making continued improvements on overall test scores.\n\nThe school faces also another significant obstacle: It’s classified as a “schoolwide school”— a status offered to schools with high percentages of students in federal free and reduced-price lunch programs—which gives the school greater flexibility in spending federal grant money but requires meeting stricter standardized testing goals.\n\nWhile many Berkeley schools only need to meet “annual measurable objectives” for the school as a whole and for economically disadvantaged children, all statistically significant subgroups at Rosa Parks must meet state standards.\n\nThis additional requirement didn’t factor into the Annual Performance Index results released last week, which showed that the entire school had dropped 20 basis points on a variety of standardized tests.\n\nIn August, a different round of tests showed that the school as a whole had surpassed state-mandated proficiency levels in English or Math but African American and economically disadvantaged students failed to meet state goals on both sections.\n\nTo improve test scores, federal law requires the school to provide tutoring for struggling students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.\n\nIn two weeks, as many as 30 students will begin the first in a series of eight-week programs designed to help improve English and Math skills.\n\nRosa Parks was also required to provide tutoring last year as part of year two of program improvement, but the BUSD program—attended by 40 pupils—did not begin until February and only offered English assistance.\n\nThis year, the program offers six tutors—mostly UC Berkeley students—with study groups consisting of three to five students. Enrollment has been tricky, administrators said, and because all parents received notices describing tutoring options irrespective of whether their child qualified, the school had to reject applications from parents of several high-scoring students.\n\nSchool administrators have been contacting parents of eligible students, urging them to apply. “The ones that I’ve called are interested, but that doesn’t mean they will turn in the applications,” said Mira Santos, a Rosa Parks administrator.\n\nTo meet requirements for year three, the district is requiring all teachers at the largely Latino school to enroll in Project GLAD, a teaching method geared to teaching mixed classes of native English speakers and foreign students.\n\nThe program helps teachers develop lessons that incorporate academic language so students are better prepared to take tests and read text books that rely on academic English, according to co-founder Marsha Brechter. She said the training can also help African American students—the subgroup struggling the most at Rosa Parks—if they come from an environment that does not use academic English.\n\nProgram improvement also allows parents to switch their children to other schools. Some parents have complained that since there were no openings in the other two elementary schools in their zone—Thousand Oaks and Jefferson—they had been forced to stay at Rosa Parks.\n\nBason said the district received approximately 20 requests for school changes from Rosa Parks. While some were denied due to lack of space in other schools, she said most requests were not related to concern over standardized test scores.\n\nMost parents interviewed said they had no thoughts of deserting the school.\n\n“The community is very motivated here,” said Cathy Duenas, the mother of a fifth grader, who said she was more concerned about the tests themselves than the student’s performances. She echoed several parents who expressed concerns about a district-wide trend toward larger class size, citing her son’s math class, which has one teacher for 37 students.\n\nParents were universally opposed to any administrative shakeup. “That would be ridiculous,” said David Richie. “They have a great group of teachers and staff. That would only mess that up.”\n\nOne seemingly insignificant requirement for standardized testing may soon land other Berkeley schools in a similar bind.\n\nSchools are required by federal law to test 95 percent of students, ostensibly to ensure that schools don’t pressure failing students to forgo the test to improve scores. But California doesn’t demand that students take the test, and many Berkeley parents who oppose standardized testing have opted out.\n\nOnly three of Berkeley’s 15 schools met participation goals for tests released in August, and failure to do so for a second consecutive year would force them into program improvement as well.\n\nWell, you gotta hand it to 9th District State Senator Don Perata. Thanks, in part, to a calendar-challenged Superior Court judge and Attorney General Bill Lockyer (both of whom seem to think that four days equals four years), Mr. Perata has figured out a way to stretch his term limit from the voter -mandated two to a more convenient (for him) three. Now it looks like Mr. Perata, may have simultaneously managed to snooker his toughest opponent out of the race against him.\n\nAnd by toughest opponent, I don’t mean our current 16th District Assemblymember, Wilma Chan.\n\nLike Inigo Montoya said in The Princess Bride, there’s too much here to explain, so I’ll just sum up.\n\nIn 1998, Perata barely edged out then-State Assemblymember Dion Aroner in the Democratic primary to fill the unexpired State Senate term of Barbara Lee. (Some folks say that Mr. Perata won because he snookered Keith Carson into running, thus splitting the vote, but that’s another story.) (Oh. And some of the same folks say that Mr. Perata won because he got a boost from an illegal, last-minute loan from his father in excess of the Special Election contribution limit, a violation for which Mr. Perata was found guilty and fined by the California Fair Political Practices Commission, but that’s another story, too.) (Gosh, these Perata stories are beginning to add up to a whole book of these things.)\n\nAnyways, Mr. Perata ran unopposed in the 2000 Democratic primary, and got himself re-elected to his second term (or first term, if you count along with the attorney general and Judge James Richman) in November. Meanwhile, Ms. Aroner stayed in the Assembly until she was term-limited out in 2002. In April of this year, a California National Organization for Women newsletter announced that Ms. Aroner “will run for the state Senate when Majority Leader Don Perata ( D-Oakland), is termed out in 2004.”\n\nLike they say in the Hertz commercial, not exactly. Stick with me gang, ‘cause this is where it gets complicated.\n\nA couple of things then happened. In 2000, Wilma Chan wins the 16th California Assembly seat from the woeful Audie Bock, with the help of Mr. Perata (the Oakland Tribune calls her Perata’s “protégé”). And then, in 2001, the state legislature rearranges the boundaries of the 9th Senate District to fit population of the 2000 census. The new 9th District boundaries—surprise, surprise—better fits someone running from the southern part of the district (like, say, Alameda and Oakland, where Ms. Chan and Mr. Perata live) than it does someone from the northern part of the district (like, say, Berkeley, where Ms. Aroner lives). Well, maybe not so much of a surprise, since Mr. Perata has a big hand—maybe the biggest hand—in drawing the new lines.\n\nSo a couple of more things happen.\n\nMs. Chan announced that she was going to leave the Assembly after only two terms (she has the right to try for three) to run for the 9th Senate District seat that Mr. Perata is (involuntarily) vacating. Thereafter Ms. Aroner, looking at a race against a popular legislator in a district with a lot of voters who don’t know Ms. Aroner, figures that she’d have to run too negative a race to win, and decides she’s not going to run for the State Senate.\n\nBut, suddenly, an odd twist in the story.\n\nOut of the blue, Mr. Perata decides he wants to run for the State Senate again. He gets State Attorney General Lockyer to agree, even though the term limit law seems to mandate that Mr. Perata cannot serve another term. Everybody assumes that Ms. Chan will now drop out of the race in favor of Mr. Perata, but when I talk to her staff some days aft"
