        "text": "Updated March 7, 2024 to reflect Fall 2024 experience and timeline.\n\nYou might be wondering: what will Golden Bear Orientation (GBO) look like? Below are two sample schedules for GBO Fall 2024 transfer students and first year students. The majority of programs during GBO are not held with the entire incoming class together and each GBO Small Group (over 250 of them!) are unique to provide personalized programming and ensure access to mealtimes. You will receive your specific schedule on the first day of GBO programming (Thursday, August 22) from your Orientation Leaders (OLs).\n\nWe understand that a model built for so many students will not accommodate every individual; if after reading through the sample schedules below you believe that you will need accommodations during GBO, please scroll to the bottom of this page* to find instructions on how to request these accommodations.\n\nFall 2024 GBO Sample Schedule (First Year Students)\n\nFall 2024 GBO Sample Schedule (Transfer Students)\n\nCheck In\n\nCheck In will occur on Wednesday, August 21, 2024. Check back in May for full details about Check In, including locations and times. We are working on new ideas for Fall 2024 to reduce lines and improve how we serve you during such a busy time.\n\nNew Student Welcome\n\nCheck back in May for updated details on the New Student Welcome.\n\nGrouping, GBO Small Group Time & OL Choice\n\nImmediately following Convocation, you will meet your Orientation Leaders and the other incoming students in your GBO small group at the Grouping event. You will be with this group throughout GBO. Students will engage in dialogue and community building with a small group of their peers and Orientation Leaders (OLs). OL Choice are times when your OLs will select programming specifically for your group.\n\nMeals\n\nMeals will be provided throughout GBO. You will have an assigned location and time for each meal. All meals will be able to provide options for dietary needs. If you do not see your dietary need met, please directly ask one of the Cal Dining staff present and inform your Orientation Leader as soon as possible.\n\nBear Foundations\n\nBear Foundations is intended to start or continue the conversation of community and identity for new students. During the large group program and following small group discussion, students will learn about UC Berkeley’s Principles of Community, Othering, and Belonging, and reflect on their identity and relationship with campus. New students will recognize that they play an active role in creating a safe and healthy culture at Cal and will leave this program reflecting how to improve their communities at Cal. We want new students to continue their knowledge of exploring stories of identities, intersectionality, community-building through different platforms and media.\n\nLate Night Programming\n\nLate Night Programming offers opportunities to get to know campus and its surroundings and experience entertainment at and around Cal. More importantly, Late Night Programming allows new students to bond and have fun with their groups and other new Cal students! While programming is scheduled all night, these events are optional. Programming will go no later than midnight each day. You can participate in programming by attending with members of your GBO group, or select from the variety of options each night.\n\nResource Fair\n\nThe Campus Department Resource Fair will introduce incoming students to 70+ campus departments, including Berkeley Study Abroad and University Health Services. The fair will be hosted in person and will allow you to connect directly with staff from various campus departments.\n\nBear Pact\n\nBear Pact is a mandatory performance that will teach you about important issues faced by college students: sexual violence and harassment, related policies, reporting options, and resources, mental health, bystander intervention, alcohol and substance use. Learn about the many ways you can maintain a balanced lifestyle and the resources on campus that can help you in this pursuit. You will also gain strategies to take care of friends, classmates, and roommates.\n\nDay in the Bay\n\nYour Berkeley experience extends beyond the campus and we know many of you are eager to explore the Bay Area. Day in the Bay will take you to a venue in the Bay Area (past excursions have included SF MOMA, the Exploratorium, Oakland Museum, Oakland Ice Rink, 90s Museum, Bay Cruise). All transportation and tickets will be included.\n\nTransfer students will have the option to select both from Bay Area excursions or local companies. Companies will host small groups of students and introduce them to work culture based on areas of interest (business, education, non-profit, transportation, etc).\n\nFirst year students will visit Bay Area excursions based on their assigned group time/location.\n\nTransfer Symposium (Transfer Students Only)\n\nNew for 2024! Check back in May for details on a program designed for Transfer Students.\n\nTransfer Student Welcome (Transfer Students Only)\n\nTransfer Student Welcome is a program in partnership with the Transfer Center, with its main goal being to welcome all transfer students to the Berkeley community and to discuss services and resources available to them.\n\nRes Hall Meetings (Students Living in University Residence Halls Only)\n\nRes Hall meetings are dedicated time for you to connect with Resident Assistants (RAs) and full time staff within the University Residence Halls. These individuals will provide basic information about your new home and will continue to be a resource to you after GBO ends.\n\nMy Golden Years\n\nStudents will be able to hear from some of our Orientation Mentors about their golden years so far at Berkeley. The goal of My Golden Years is to introduce students to the varied and valuable experiences of Berkeley students.\n\nBite of Berkeley\n\nWe are surrounded by incredible and varied food options in the city of Berkeley. Exploring those is built into GBO! You and your small group will be assigned to visit a local restaurant to one of your lunch or dinner blocks during GBO.\n\nAlumni Mixer\n\nTransfer students will have the opportunity to learn career tips and information from alumni working in different industries. New students will have a specific time designated to them to go to the Alumni Mixer on Saturday evening.\n\nCollege Programming\n\nCollege Programming consists of programming designed by each college (e.g College of Letters and Science, College of Natural Resources) to prepare students for life in that specific academic environment. During these events, there will be an introduction to your college and more specific sessions centered around what to expect from your college and major. Check the Cal Events App for specific events related to your major.\n\nAffinity Spaces\n\nBuild community with fellow new students who share your identity! Affinity Spaces are informal, social spaces for students from diverse backgrounds. You’ll also have the opportunity to meet staff and/or continuing students. You can self-select which social(s) to attend, or choose not to attend any, and you do not need to attend with your small group. Descriptions of each Affinity Space are available in the Cal Events App.\n\nBanner Signing\n\nAn iconic GBO tradition! Come add your name to the Class of 2026 or Class of 2028 banners. These will be hung up at graduation- book ends to your Berkeley career!\n\nGroup Closing\n\nAll good things must come to an end, and GBO is no exception. Closing with small groups and Orientation Leaders is an opportunity to wrap up the week and look to the coming semester. The group closing will include dinner.\n\n*Note"
