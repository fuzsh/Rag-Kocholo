Experience the pre-judgments made on age, class, race, physical ability, homelessness, and more in a series of monologues and dance sequences ranging from the laugh-out-loud funny to the moving to the —all set in America’s melting pot, the DMV. The show was hailed as “Hilarious! Amazing! The most fun you’ll ever have at the DMV” by KQED.\n\n“Don Reed is soooo good that if you caught Can You Dig It? or his other shows, you’ll be back for more… You know these characters… and in the diasporic crapshoot that’s the DMV, you are these people. That’s the great gift of Don Reed—and of killer actors in general, and good solo performers in particular: paying attention enough to embody some truth and bring it back home for all of us.”\n\n—Stark Insider\n\nArtist Biography\n\nDon Reed, (HBO/Snap Judgment/CBS) was the 2016 Theatre Bay Area – WINNER – for Outstanding Solo Production East 14th and is Co-Producer of filmmaker Robert Townsend‘s solo hit Living the Shuffle.
