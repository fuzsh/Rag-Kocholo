        "text": "University of California, Davis\n\nClass of 2025\n\nNeurology, Physiology, and Behavior Major\n\nRecent Achievement: “In my last quarter, I made the Dean's List, despite having one of the most difficult schedules of my college education. I was able to do well while also balancing my extracurriculars, which included being an active leader on the Women's Club Waterpolo team, working as an Emergency Medical Technician every weekend, and studying for the MCAT. In addition, I wrote a couple pieces in my health writing class which I was proud of and submitted to a prized writing contest and began an internship at UC Davis Health working with the pediatric population!”\n\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz\n\nClass of 2025\n\nMolecular Cell Development\n\nRecent Achievement: “A recent achievement of mine over the past few weeks is learning new and challenging cooking and baking recipes. Another recent achievement of mine has been getting the continuous opportunity to work in a small coffee shop during school breaks. It has been a great experience getting to learn the scientific parts of coffee as well as getting to work in a great group of coworkers, and learning good customer service. When I finish school I hope to attend medical school or work in medical research to try and help make people feel better.”\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nClass of 2024\n\nPsychology and Public Major\n\nRecent Achievement: “A recent achievement of mine was having the opportunity to lead a group in developing a digital resource to help guide first generation students through the process of applying to and transitioning into college. This was a project that resonated deeply with me as the first in my family to attend college myself. Furthermore, I was recently selected to train and volunteer at a non-profit clinic that focuses on providing free care to individuals and communities who are socioeconomically marginalized or excluded by the current healthcare system.”\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nClass of 2023\n\nHistory Major\n\nRecent Achievements: “An achievement I am proud of is overcoming my nerves about conversing in Italian and Spanish with native speakers. During my time studying in Europe, I connected with people from various regions and linguistic backgrounds who were similarly eager to communicate. Our shared goals of personal growth and international connection encouraged me to jump in and prioritize my language development (while also prioritizing my studies, an internship, and research & club activities.) Transitioning from a structured classroom to the dynamic real world was intimidating, exhilarating, and rewarding - even amidst the challenge of deciphering various dialects. Now, not only can I communicate more colloquially, but I also foster meaningful connections with people who broaden my global and personal perspectives.”\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nClass of 2024\n\nMaster’s in Biotechnology\n\nRecent Achievements: “Some of my recent achievements are firstly getting some good internships for the fall semester, completing a year of my grad school, and learning so much about responsibilities and growing up. Most importantly during my previous role in Regulatory Affairs, being something that takes years of practice, I gauged interest and passion in such a short span, I gained skills of leadership and confidence to take up any work. I've excelled at giving good presentations in all my school work. I've gained more insights and recognition of my strengths and capabilities, leading to self-care and appreciation in the last few months where I am regularly exercising and keeping fit.”\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nClass of 2026\n\nMajor: Molecular and Cellular Biology\n\nAbout Me: “Hi! My name is Michelle Li, and I am part of the Class of 2026 as a freshman at the University of California, Berkeley. I am intending to major in Molecular and Cell Biology. I enjoy practicing Hapkido and hope to obtain my second degree black belt certification during or after college. I also deeply enjoy jamming out to Kpop music (preferably Seventeen and The Boyz), and am passionate about exploring the field of biomedicine, biotech, research, and bio-entrepreneurship. One fun fact about myself is that I am currently trying to make my dorm room Seventeen aesthetic-themed.”\n\nRecent Achievements: “In terms of recent achievements, I am proud to have received my 1st degree black belt certification back in February of 2022. During the summer, I was able to dedicate many hours in volunteering at my local Hapkido studio. A while back, I was able to learn about bio entrepreneurship and pharmaceutics under the KECK Graduate Institute SURE Program, where I was able to analyze research articles to propose whether Ebselen could be used to treat Staphylococcal Infections. This experience caused me to fall in love with medicine even further.”\n\nAspirations: “In five years, I hope to have graduated with a double major in MCB and Business Administration. I hope to either be starting my first year at medical school to pursue a higher degree in order to prepare for a future career in medicine. Another aspiration in the next five years, if not medical school, would be me starting my first year at a biotech industry. I would achieve these aspirations through actively participating in research and work experience, while maintaining a learning mindset.”\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nClass of 2024\n\nMajor: Molecular & Cell Biology and Psychology\n\nAbout Me: “Hi I am Jane, a junior at UC Berkeley majoring in Molecular & Cell Biology and Psychology. I love visiting coffee shops, cooking with my friends, and reading. One fun fact about me is that I have 2 cats who are in China and 1 cat that I adopted with my cousin who is at my cousin's place.”\n\nRecent Achievements: “Recently I troubleshooted and overcame a challenge that I've been experiencing for about 2 months in my lab at Berkeley.”\n\nAspirations: “Five years from now, I would still be in grad school pursuing a Ph.D. degree.”\n\nPurdue University\n\nClass of 2026\n\nMajor: Computer Information Technology\n\nAbout Me: “My name is Deepak Ananthakrishnan and I am a freshman attending Purdue University this fall. My passions involve messing with computers and watching or playing sports in my spare time. One fun fact about myself is that I've played the piano for seven years.”\n\nRecent Achievements: “An achievement I'm proud of is that I got all the way to Certificate of Merit level 9 right when I graduated high school. Additionally, I am proud that I was able to successfully achieve a third degree black belt in Taekwondo.”\n\nAspirations: “ In five years I see myself not only working a technology based job that I would find interesting, but also following my passions as well. Whether it comes from through my job or in my own time, I see myself analyzing and playing sports for fun. I plan to achieve this goal by not only hard work, but also trying to do projects that connect sports and technology in my own time as well.”\n\nCase Western Reserve University\n\nClass of 2023\n\nMajor: Computer Science\n\nAbout Me: “Hi, my name is Kaitao Chen.
