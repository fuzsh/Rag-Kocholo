        "text": "UCLA School of Law\n\nA longtime training ground for Hollywood attorneys, UCLA tops the list with an impressive offering through the Ziffren Institute for Media, Entertainment, Technology and Sports Law that includes a media and entertainment specialization, a documentary film legal clinic and sports simulation program — plus, the school has a dedicated entertainment law review and a well-established externship program. Amid the pandemic, UCLA’s 44th annual entertainment symposium pivoted from a two-day live event at its Westwood campus to a four-night webinar series and launched three new industry-related courses: one focused on ethics, another on esports and the third on the future of television (taught by legal legend Ken Ziffren).\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nWhat the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Ivy lacks in proximity to Hollywood, it makes up for in prestige. Consistently one of the top-ranked law schools in the nation, Harvard also has specialized courses in entertainment and media law. Alumna Tara Kole, a professor and mentor, says it’s more entertainment-focused and the students “impress me at every turn.”\n\nColumbia Law School\n\nSet amid the bustling entertainment hub of Manhattan, Columbia draws its fair share of future Hollywood lawyers — like Greenberg Glusker’s Matt Galsor, who jumped at the opportunity to leave L.A. for the East Coast Ivy. “The moment Columbia extended me an offer of admission, I accepted it,” says Galsor. “I know a good deal when I see it.”\n\nSouthwestern Law School\n\nSouthwestern pivoted amid the pandemic by moving all its planned courses, events and programs online — and converting its “A Conversation With …” speaker series into a podcast. The school also grew participation in its pro bono Entertainment and the Arts Legal Clinic, will offer a summer event to help students who aspire to have their own practice, and hired Kevin J. Greene as a professor.\n\nStanford Law School\n\n“Stanford has cultivated one of the best intellectual property programs in the country, which is a critical foundation for a career in entertainment law,” says alumna Ashley Yeargan. While still a student, she persuaded Stanford to add an entertainment law class that she designed with her mentor Larry Stein. It’s still offered and is now taught by Bert Fields and his partner Bonnie Eskenazi. There’s also the Stanford Entertainment and Sports Law Association and the Juelsgaard Intellectual Property and Innovation Clinic.\n\nNYU School of Law\n\nClosing out the top 10, NYU offers an Antitrust, Intellectual Property and Information concentration, entertainment-related courses and a Technology Law and Policy Clinic as well as an entertainment-centric student society and law review.\n\n***\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nBrooklyn Law School, Penn Law, Cornell Law School, UC Hastings College of the Law and GW Law also are among the best and most popular programs in the country.\n\nThis story first appeared in the May 26 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
