        "text": "2700 San Pablo Ave. proposal does not conform to zoning\n\nEditor:\n\nI would like to clarify a few points regarding your recent article about the appeal of the 2700 San Pablo project to the City Council.\n\nThe design rejected unanimously by the ZAB contained 61 parking spaces.\n\nThe new design offered on appeal to the City Council contains only 33, a 46 percent reduction in parking. The City Council would have to make special allowances for this inadequate parking because by law developers are required to provide a minimum of 44 spaces for this building.\n\nThe West Berkeley Plan permits a maximum of 4 stories at nodal intersection such as Ashby or University. Leaving aside the fact that 2700 San Pablo is not at a node, the City Council should take note that zoning regulations permit a maximum of 4 stories only if the ground floor is commercial.\n\nDevelopers are allowed to exceed 3 stories only because ground floor commercial space helps create a thriving street life by providing shops and cafes. In their previous design, the developer had offered 100 percent ground floor commercial. But now in their appeal to City Council, the new design provides only 20.7 percent commercial. The rest of the ground floor is not open to the public.\n\nThe Daily Planet reported that the new design provides 2,605 sq. ft for commercial space (out of 7,225 sq. ft on the ground floor). In my opinion, the design actually provides only 1,495 sq. ft. because the remaining \"commercial space\" is devoted to the building management office.\n\nIt is questionable whether the West Berkeley Plan allows an office of this sort to qualify as commercial space. This 1,100 sq. ft. private office is larger than many of the homes in this neighborhood!\n\nLastly, the developers (who have been waging legal battles to avoid being required to provide any affordable housing in apartment buildings) have used a loophole to provide less than the 20 percent affordable housing required by the city.\n\nWhat they have done is to provide 4 live-work spaces that are exempt from the affordable housing calculations -- the developers have carefully avoided stepping over the threshold of 5 or more live-work spaces which would have made them subject to being included in the affordable housing calculations.\n\nBut in reality, affordable units comprise less than 17 percent of the dwelling units.\n\nThis design is just as bad as the design rejected by the ZAB and in some ways worse; the 7-0 ZAB rejection of this project should not be overturned on appeal.\n\nMichael Goldberg\n\nBerkeley\n\n2700 San Pablo neighbors want smaller project\n\nin back yards\n\nEditor:\n\nDeveloper Patrick Kennedy is resorting to “name calling” and either gross exaggeration or a misunderstanding of the English language in his comments about opposition to his most recent development proposals at 2700 San Pablo Ave.\n\nFirst of all, calling those who disagree with him NIMBY's is just “name calling” that side steps the issues at hand. We want the site developed with low income housing! We want it in our back yard! We just want a building of reasonable scale.\n\nFurthermore, the “virulent” opposition he speaks of is nothing of the sort. Virulence means “an extreme bitterness or malignity of temper” - this in no way characterizes his opposition - who have been thoughtful and persistent.\n\nJust a few facts to throw in here:\n\n• The latest proposal is taller than the last one.\n\n• It does not meet established requirements for parking,\n\n• The fourth story does not meet zoning requirements unless the first story is all commercial.\n\n• It takes advantage of a loophole to provide less than 20 percent affordable housing.\n\nIncidentally, I live within 50 yards of the site.\n\nBob Kubik\n\nBerkeley\n\nSJP opposes all discrimination\n\nEditor:\n\nI am dismayed by the lengths that people will go in accusing groups that speak out against Israel’s policies towards the Palestinians. In her April 26 letter to the editor, Ms. Liss airs several complaints about our recent sit-in on the Berkeley campus, claiming that we (Students for Justice in Palestine) were breeding “anti-semitism,” and accusing us of not addressing “the entire historical context” of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict.\n\nThese vague but serious accusations of prejudice are a common way of trying to silence those who dare to suggest that Israel needs to change its treatment of Palestinians. Students for Justice in Palestine is absolutely opposed to anti-semitism, and does not condone any anti-semitism expressed by people who joined us at our rally. In fact, the same principles that cause us to be opposed to anti-semitism compel us to speak out against the conditions under which Palestinians are forced to live.\n\nRobert Fisk wrote in the London Independent, “(T)here's not much difference between the tactics of the Israeli army in the occupied territories and that of the South African police. The apartheid regime had death squads, just as Israel has today. Yet even they did not use helicopter gunships and missiles.”\n\nWithin Israel, Arab citizens were fired upon with live ammunition while demonstrating, 14 were killed. Israel has built ‘by-pass’ roads connecting the illegal settlements in the occupied territories that Palestinians are not allowed to use. Israel has been condemned for excessive violence, use of torture, and collective punishment by the UN commission on human rights, Amnesty International, and many other well-respected organizations. And yet, the United States still gives over $8 million in taxes to Israel in military aid every day. We, as Americans, are funding Israel’s destruction and dispossession of the Palestinian people and thus all must become aware of the facts of the situation and decide if we still want our aid going to the oppressive Israeli military.\n\nSarah Weir\n\nBerkeley\n\nTV needs balance\n\nEditor:\n\nThere are often discussions of various political and other problems being aired by T.V. stations; only the public stations are in the habit of using moderate and polite speakers, one-on-one or as members of panels.\n\nCommercial stations, more frequently than not, tend to put people with extreme opinions on the screen, thereby arousing strong positive or negative reactions of the audience. This procedure no doubt leads to greater audience interest, an increase in the number of listeners and a higher rating of such programs. The station then can charge more money for advertising. The latter is most probably the motive for using such procedures.\n\nLet me give a few specific examples: The T.V. and/or radio host Armstrong Williams happens to be a strong supporter of the current administration and is frequently invited to defend a particular conservative position. He may be a darling of right-wingers, but he grates on the conscience of liberal viewers.\n\nThere also is Barbara Olson, the very conservative wife of an equally conservative candidate for a high position in the Justice Department. Olson is entitled to her opinions, but she was on the screen hundreds of times, on various programs, to deride Clinton and his administration throughout the duration of that administration and she exhibited extreme bias.\n\nWhen one looks on the other end of the spectrum, one rarely sees truly liberal experts being consulted.\n\nMax Alfert\n\nBerkeley\n\nAlbany\n\nJudah L.

Idols of rock will perform together at the Berkeley Community Theater – Dr. John, Mickey Hart, Paul Cantina, Jack Casady and more. Wavy will emcee.\n\nWavy Gravy, icon of the ’60s, clown and hippie is above all a social activist.\n\nThe birthday gala is just an excuse – the concert is really a fund-raiser in disguise for SEVA, Sanskrit for Service to Human Kind. SEVA is a health organization that provides cataract operations to people in Nepal, India and Tibet. A ticket to the birthday concert is enough to pay for an operation on “one eyeball, 20 bucks,” Wavy says.\n\nUp the alley from Peet’s on Fourth Street, Wavy’s tidy SEVA office is decorated by, among other things, a light with soft bristles that change color as they revolve and a star fish upon which sits a yellow plastic monk talking on a cell phone. Beautifully framed posters of other SEVA fund-raisers Gravy organized hang in the halls. “Peace through Living” is the subtitle to his book, Something Good for a Change. And his life is an illustration of that concept.\n\nIn jeans and Hawaiian shirt, Wavy describes SEVA and meanders through other details of his most remarkable adventures.\n\n“The main slice of blindness is curable and preventable,” Wavy says. “Eighty percent of all people who are blind are unnecessarily blind and 80 percent of that 80 percent can regain sight.”\n\nSEVA was created 23 years ago after Wavy, his Hog Farm commune and Dr. Larry Brilliant, went to Nepal. They had started out for Pakistan to feed people marooned by floods, but because of the war between India and Pakistan they “veered left.” There Brilliant set up a clinic and Wavy blew bubbles. The kids had never seen bubbles before and “chased them through fields of reefer that stretched to the Himalayas trying to escape to the stars. It was such a gift, to be in this beauty, yet the terrain was steep and difficult. It was so easy to fall,” Wavy said. The ironic part was that so many people there were blind.\n\nNicole Grasset, a woman legendary in Public Health, (Wavy calls her “one of the great saints, a mother Teresa in a Dior dress, except it’s a ‘knock off’ she washes by hand.”), pitched an idea to Brilliant, Ram Dass and Wavy to do something about the blindness. With an initial $10,000 grant from Steve Jobs at Apple Computer, they were able to go into Nepal and survey where eye camps could be set up.\n\nSoon after, Wavy happened to be on an airplane with the Grateful Dead and he proposed the idea of a SEVA fund-raiser to them. Bob Weir had already read something in the Whole Earth Catalog about the eye camps. The Dead agreed to a fund-raiser which was a huge success and Bill Graham donated $10,000 too.\n\nWavy Gravy has set up such successful fund-raisers that SEVA has been able to expand its health focuses to work with indigenous peoples of the Americas, in diabetes prevention on several American Indian reservations in the United States and with Mayans in Guatemala.\n\nNever ordinary, Wavy grew up in Princeton, N.J., where, as he tells it, “I was five and airing myself in the front yard. Albert Einstein asked my mother if he might take me for a walk.” It was the first of many walks. Einstein wore tennis shoes and a sweatshirt and told Wavy that “as a young child (he) remembered things like linoleum patterns. I remember Einstein’s smell. Musty,” but more than that.\n\nWhen his parents divorced and each remarried and had other families, Wavy, then Hugh Romney, knew he’d have to make his own way through college. He joined the Army and later went to Boston University, on the GI Bill, to study performing arts. There he met the most incredible teachers, people who’d been blackballed by Hollywood during the McCarthy era. Wavy remembers Martha Graham as one of the dance instructors. “I had the hots for her; she had feet like cypress trees.” Top directors would come into the giant theater on campus and cast a play and everyone would have a part or were assigned to the crew.\n\nBut the university administration didn’t want the teachers off in their own space ignoring core curriculum, so they quit. And they took Wavy with them to New York City and got him a scholarship at the Neighborhood Play House. He then became poetry director of the Gas Light Theater. People came in four deep to stare at the beatniks as if they were a geek show. Wavy recited poems he wrote, which got shorter and shorter “until they dissolved into haiku.”\n\nEventually, he dropped the poems and just talked about the weird things that had happened to him during the day. He calls what he does ‘Stand Up Philosophy’ or ‘Head Riffs.’\n\nHis act was so impressive he was invited to open for jazz musicians including John Coltrane and Thelonius Monk. One night in Texas, B.B. King was trying to set up after Wavy (still Hugh Romney) had introduced him and Wavy was in the way. B.B. King clapped him on the shoulder and said, “Don’t worry Wavy Gravy, I’ll work around you.” Wavy’d been christened.\n\nWavy brought his theater energies west and was a member of The Committee, an improvisational group in San Francisco. Eventually, he and friends formed a commune which was called the Hog Farm because of a gig they had living on a mountain top in California, rent free for slopping the hogs. Wavy and his Hog Farm Commune criss-crossed the country in buses to bring anti-war messages to college campuses.\n\nNo stranger to stardom, he has been in the national eye since Woodstock where he made the famous announcement, “What we’re thinking of is breakfast in bed for 400,000.” He has been on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine and Life, as the psychedelic hero, crony to the Merry Pranksters and an original acid test survivor.\n\nBecause of beatings he received during anti-war demonstrations, Wavy had to have several spinal fusions. After the last fusion, he was severally depressed, “bouncing on the bottom,” he called it.\n\nBut someone suggested he work at Children’s Hospital and gave him a red nose to wear there. He went and found the antidote to his depression was the children. (They lit up at the sight of his red nose.)\n\nThe more involved he got with the children, the more he lost track of his own personal pain. He worked at Children’s Hospital for many years. One nurse remembers his devoted readings of Wind in the Willows to a girl who had spina bifida. “He was so unassuming and soft spoken,” said Eileen Barrett (sister of the author). “He came week after week after week, his book tucked under his arm. He was perfect for her.”\n\nWavy kept dressing as a clown when he discovered cops didn’t hit him anymore. He’s always touted laughter. “Humor enables people to see things in a new way. When people laugh their defenses go down.”\n\nWhen he met his wife, to whom he’s been married 35 years, he knew she was the one because she put peanuts on his hamburger. They bought a ranch in Leggett, and there they run a summer camp for kids called Camp Winnarainbow. The basic idea of the camp is to “set up a palette where people can discover they’re a star.”\n\nWavy’s such a famous man, Ben and Jerry designed an ice cream flavor for him, “a very complex blend,” Rob at the Ben and Jerry’s on Oxford Street says. It took about two hundred taste tests to hit the right balance. Money from the ice cream sales is donated to assure diversity at Camp Winnarainbow.\n\nThe camp pays him a monthly salary and his room and board. Although many think he’s a ‘godzillionaire,’ Wavy claims he has only $300 in the bank, that he just deposited. He lives in north Berkeley in a place he calls ‘Hippie Hyannisport’ in a multi-generational communal household. He says he’s thinking of slowing down a little, but right now in addition to the fund-raiser and getting Camp Winnarainbow ready for the summer onslaught, he has an art show hanging in San Francisco at the Laser Reflection Gallery.\n\nHis work, he says, is done out of “pure greed and selfishness. It gets me stoned – a high that is not in the pharmaceutical cabinet.”\n\nWhen the phone rings and the caller asks him how he is, his answer “Semi–spectacular” is only semi-accurate. Drop the semi and you’d have the full truth.\n\nCall SEVA at 845-7382 for information on tickets for the fund-raiser.\n\nSACRAMENTO — By pushing California to join other Western states in a regional organization to run the states’ power grids, federal energy regulators want something that will neither cut energy costs nor stave off blackouts, Western officials said Friday.\n\nPlus, officials said, not many states want to join a club with California as a member.\n\n“Given the problems in California now, I’m not sure who would want California to join them,” said a Western power official who asked to not be quoted by name.\n\nCalifornia officials said Friday they will go to court rather than join a regional transmission organization (RTO) they say would limit California’s ability to control its power grid by giving more authority to the federal government and other Western states.\n\n“We’re not going to give up our authority to resolve our problems,” said California Independent System Operator board chairman Michael Kahn.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is illegally trying to force California to join an RTO by making that a condition of limited electricity price caps the commission ordered this week, alleged Kahn and California Public Utilities Commissioner Loretta Lynch.\n\nThat won’t help in the short run, they said, echoing earlier criticism by Gov. Gray Davis.\n\nEventually, however, states will move toward RTOs, officials and analysts said.\n\nThis week FERC approved an RTO spanning seven Western states that will control 90 percent of the lines from the Canadian border to southern Nevada. RTO West includes Washington, Oregon, Idaho, western Montana, parts of Nevada and Utah, a tiny portion of Northern California and possibly the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.\n\n“RTO West can serve as an anchor for the ultimate formation of a West-wide RTO,” the commission said, noting new Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham’s recent support for a Western regional RTO.\n\nA second RTO known as Desert Star, made up of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, eastern Wyoming and the western Texas panhandle, expects to seek FERC approval next month.\n\nCalifornia should create its own RTO – essentially, the current California Independent System Operator – to work with its neighbors to form the sort of seamless, larger, more efficient energy market FERC envisions, California and other Western officials suggested.\n\n“As a short-term goal, most people believe there should be three Western RTOs, and as a long-term goal, merge those,” said Desert Star project manager Michael Raezer.\n\nWestern states are too diverse and have too many operational barriers to merge their grids immediately, officials and analysts said.\n\nEighty percent of power in the Pacific Northwest, for example, comes from federal hydroelectric plants, while the desert Southwest gets half of its power from publicly owned utilities. Most of California, however, receives its power from investor-owned utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric, which recently sought bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn theory, a larger regional market would erase the shortages in supply and competition that have driven up prices and prompted four days of rolling blackouts in California so far this year, said Stanford University economist Frank Wolak.\n\nHowever, sparsely populated but energy-rich Western states could be overpowered by California and see their relatively cheap energy rates increase in a seamless market, Wolak said.\n\nNor is it apparent that a single RTO would bring benefits beyond the cooperation that already exists between states, said Erik Saltmarsh, chief counsel for the California Electricity Oversight Board.\n\nThe minimal cost savings might be offset by the high cost of merging the states’ power grids, he said.\n\n“Everyday we schedule (power flow) from Montana to Los Angeles and from British Columbia to Phoenix,” Saltmarsh said. “We don’t view that as a problem.”\n\nFERC, he added, invests an RTO with “magical powers,” as if by joining all of California’s problems will go away. “We don’t think it’s necessary, it doesn’t do anything, it’s a distraction from the key problems and it doesn’t solve them.”\n\nThat’s isolationist thinking that no longer works, said Stephen Angle, a former FERC attorney whose law firm now represents several power generators.\n\nFERC’s concern, Angle said, is that California has tried to go it alone but created problems “for itself that are spilling into other states.”\n\nAn RTO “is a long-term solution,” Angle said. “They’re not going to be up and running in time for this summer. But there certainly is a need to integrate California into a larger market for the long term.”\n\nCONSERVATION\n\nHoping to set an example for a power-short state, Gov. Gray Davis on Friday announced that state office buildings reduced energy use by an average of 20 percent in January and February.\n\nThe measures have saved taxpayers $286,000, Davis said.\n\nThe amount is paltry sum compared with the more than $5 billion the state has paid since January to keep California’s lights on, and such measures did not stop operators of the state power grid from declaring a Stage 2 power shortage emergency earlier this week.\n\nBut in a news conference packed with state workers who applauded him when he entered, Davis defended the results, saying they came from only two months of effort.\n\nDavis also repeated promises that the state would escape its power woes within two years.\n\nAt his side were David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who starts Tuesday as Davis’ energy czar, and Aileen Adams, secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency.\n\nAdams oversaw the state conservation effort.\n\nShe said workers were being barraged with power-saving instructions on everything from hand-written notes to on-hold messages.\n\n“We are tracking our bills for the first time,” Adams said.\n\nThe message is already spreading to the private sector, Adams said.\n\nThe trade group Building Owners and Managers Association has pledged to conserve energy in its 300 million square feet of California office space, Adams said. And McDonald’s restaurants have begun printing conservation messages on food tray liners.\n\nDavis also said his wife had managed to conserve power in the governor’s mansion by 34 percent in January and 63 percent in February.\n\n“Of course, it’s 55 degrees the whole time,” he said. “And I have to go to bed in a heavy sweatshirt and sweatpants, and there’s no light on in any room that we’re not in.”\n\nNEW YORK — With the Dow Jones industrials up nearly 10 percent during April, many individual investors are trying to decide whether to jump into the rally. But buying stocks can be dicey in an uncertain economy and fragile earnings environment.\n\nSo, how do you put together a strategy for a fickle stock market?\n\nCautiously and without impulse buying, according to Allan Meyers and Art Bonnel, who each steer mutual funds with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets. Their funds differ in size and approach, but the advice they offer individual investors is similar. Focus on a company’s growth prospects and don’t try to time the market.\n\n“We look for those companies that are going to have the best earnings going forward, rather than the flyers,” said Meyers, manager of the $600 million Kent Growth and Income Fund, which features a mix of growth and value stocks. “Take a longer-term perspective, and don’t buy the hot stocks just because everyone else is.”\n\n“It’s very difficult to be in the right place at the right time all the time, even when you’re a professional manager,” notes Bonnel, who manages the $150 million U.S. Global Investors Bonnel Growth Fund. He likens the last nine months, particularly for tech stocks, to the devastation caused by the stock market crash of 1929.\n\nIn a step that paralleled moves by some individual investors, Bonnel pulled his aggressive growth fund partly out of the market in the first quarter of 2001, shifting more than 80 percent of its assets into cash.\n\nBut in April, the combination of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and data suggesting the economy was healthier than anyone had thought lured him back. Today, about 20 percent of the fund’s assets are in cash, with the rest in stocks.\n\nThe makeup of his stock holdings has changed radically from a year ago, though.\n\nAbout 3 percent are in technology, compared with 70 percent in the spring of 2000, when tech stocks were still roaring and the fund’s assets reached $350 million.\n\nToday the fund is down about 23 percent for the year, despite its emphasis on the types of stocks considered safer investments in a questionable economy.\n\n“We’ve been going into soaps, cleaners, petroleum ... chewing gum, beverages and ammunition,” said Bonnel, a 30-year veteran of the industry. He’d still like to buy technology, but he’s waiting for the earnings picture to get a little clearer. Although the sector has enjoyed a nice run-up, he’s not convinced the worst is over.\n\nHis advice: If you’re going to buy, focus on earnings and a company’s long-term perspective, rather than hype or emotion.\n\nA year ago, he said, technology earnings prospects were still strong, but even when they weren’t, the momentum and euphoria surrounding the sector made it impossible to resist.\n\n“Things just got totally out of hand, but you had to keep riding it,” he recalled. “I would tell individual investors today that you have to look at company and say, ’Are they good?’ and ’Will they continue to be good?”’\n\nThat focus on performance is shared by Meyers, although the Kent Growth and Income Fund he manages took a different strategy to survive the market’s hemorrhaging.\n\nThe fund of mostly large, blue chip stocks stayed with equities throughout 2000 and in 2001, although Meyers did some selling and buying to minimize losses. The fund is currently down more than 6 percent for 2001.\n\nIn February and March, he bought utility, financial and retail stocks. Technology has had less appeal — nearly 19 percent of the fund’s assets are already in tech, in line with the technology weighting on the Standard & Poor’s 500 index.\n\n“We want to see the earnings prospects turn around on these stocks first,” Meyers said, suggesting individual investors do the same. “You’ll still get a chance to buy them – everyone’s trying to get the low price, but you have to remember that for the last year these stocks have been making new lows.”\n\nHe prefers to hold on to stocks for years and hedge his bets by spreading his money across several sectors – two strategies he contends work especially well for individual investors.\n\nIndividuals also have an advantage over professional money managers, Meyers notes.\n\nA fund often sells strong stocks to avoid too much concentration in specific sectors or to compensate for other poor performers that might pull down rates of return, a competitive measure used to assess fund performance. Investors don’t face that pressure, though, with their own portfolios.\n\n“Don’t overweight in any one sector, like technology. Buy different stocks, so that when some are down, others are up,” Meyers said. “And don’t panic. Keep your wits about you no matter what.”\n\nThe market’s major indexes ended the week mixed.\n\nThe Dow finished the week up 230.20, or 2.2 percent, at 10,810.05 on a 117.70 gain Friday.\n\nThe Nasdaq slipped 87.73 or 4.1 percent for the week. It closed Friday at 2,075.68 on a gain of 40.80.\n\nThe S&P 500 index ended the week up 10.07, a 0.8 percent change, after rising 18.53 to 1,253.05 on Friday. The Russell 2000 rose 6.41 to 483.97, ending the week up 17.26 or 3.7 percent.\n\nThe Wilshire Associates Equity Index — which represents the combined market value of all New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq issues — ended the week at $11.508 trillion, up $99 billion from the previous week. A year ago the index was $13.541 trillion.\n\nEnd adv for weekend editions\n\nJudah L.

The individual was not a member of SJP. Ms. Liss could have at least mentioned that within minutes after this sign was displayed, it was removed, at the insistence of SJP members.\n\nWhile I agree with Ms. Liss that the Star of David is “a collective Jewish symbol, not specifically a pro-Israel sign,” those who defend Israel’s indefensible record of atrocities have not themselves made this distinction clear. Indeed, pro-Israel activists assert that Jewish identity is inseparable from the colonization of Palestine. Israel still calls itself a state of all the Jews in the world, rather than a state of its citizens, one-fifth of whom are not Jewish. The symbolism on the flag is entirely Jewish, even though the native population of the land is overwhelmingly non-Jewish. Courageous Jews who protest Israel’s brutality have been marginalized and derided by their co-religionists.\n\nWhile I distinguish between Judaism as a religion, and Israel as a state, it is unfortunately very easy to see how one might think that the massacres, home demolitions, assassinations, land expropriations, settlement building, imprisonment, and torture committed by the Israeli regime against the Palestinians are somehow Jewish in nature. One need only consider the illegal settlers who rampage through Arab villages chanting “Death to the goyim (non-Jews)” to realize that Israel’s colonization of Palestine has engendered hatred on both sides of this conflict, including hatred manifested in the name of Judaism and supported by the Israeli state.\n\nJudaism existed for thousands of years before the Zionist project to colonize Palestine and it is my belief that it will continue to exist after Zionism has been thoroughly repudiated. While pro-Palestinian activists must continue to make this distinction, some burden also falls on Jews to remind the public that Israel’s abysmal human rights record is not a manifestation of the Jewish faith.\n\nGregory Hoadley\n\nOakland\n\nAddress Palestinian exclusion from homeland\n\nEditor:\n\nDevora Liss misses the point completely (“Appalled by SJP symbolism” 4-26-01). The Students for Justice in Palestine and their rally cannot be categorically dismissed based on the content of one sign or one idea out of hundreds.\n\nShe picks the most trivial aspects that SJP has the least control over, and attempts to use them to discredit an entire movement. When organizers saw the sign she mentioned, they asked him to remove it. He did. She never mentioned that.\n\nSimilarly trivial, she claims that inconveniencing some students is another reason SJP’s claim “lacks validity.”\n\nNone of her voiced concerns engage the fundamental issue at hand – Israel as an Apartheid state. Perhaps because “the Jewish state” is so essentially based on the exclusion and expulsion of the Palestinians, that she has no choice but to attack irrelevant and minute details. Her letter made clear that she was less interested in learning about the Palestinian-Israel conflict from the viewpoint of the victims, than she is in defending the indefensible: Israel’s brutal Apartheid policies.\n\nWill Youmans\n\nBerkeley\n\nNeighbors support 2 or 3-story project on San Pablo Ave.\n\nEditor:\n\nIt was most thoughtful of Mr. Kennedy to thank his supporters at Panoramic Interests’ website – you’ve done well to point that out. Mr. Kennedy’s thoughtfulness has its limits, however. He continues to misrepresent those who disagree with his plan – he seems to thrive on mischievous misrepresentation.\n\nFrom the start, Neighbors for Responsible Development has argued for a two-three-story building at 2700 San Pablo and continue to support additional housing, including affordable units, at the site. We object, however, to inappropriate height and four to five stories is too high for the surrounding context of one-story and occasional two-story buildings.\n\nMaximum zoning height limits are not directives to build to a particular height, but are “maximums,” and the Zoning Adjustments Board is responsible for adjusting the height of a project to limits appropriate to the surroundings and project needs. The ZAB unanimously denied Mr. Kennedy’s project.\n\nNRD has repeatedly presented alternative three-story designs that would meet the city’s desire for housing and a developer’s reasonable profit margin, but Mr. Kennedy insists\n\nthat he doesn’t build anything less than four stories. At the hearing, we offered an example of a three-story building with as many bedrooms as Mr. Kennedy’s most recent design and with an occupancy rating about the same as his first plan. Faced with a model of the area, clearly demonstrating how physically mis-scaled his project is, Mr. Kennedy proceeded brazenly and publicly to vandalize it, audibly tearing two buildings from the display’s base to examine them, and then appeared to object when I rescued the display from his grasp. It was a display of arrogant disregard for the property and welfare of others that has characterized his attitude to those who live and work in this neighborhood: he would as happily tear away the character and identity of our neighborhood. We welcome a project at 2700 San Pablo and hope it will provide housing—but at a scale appropriate to the neighborhood that surrounds it.\n\nHowie Muir\n\nBerkeley\n\nConserve, educate\n\nEditor:\n\nPeople don’t know that fluorescent lights use only 20 percent of the energy used by regular lightbulbs; they don’t know that electric cars use 50 percent of the energy used by internal-combustion engined cars; they don’t know that standard air-conditioning uses ten times more energy than water-evaporation coolers; they don’t know that all these old, standard technologies produce a lot of environmental heat, which is one of the causes of global warming. People don’t know that the burning of octane puts eight times more greenhouse gas in the atmosphere than the burning of natural gas. High carbon fuels like heating oil, diesel, and coal are far worse.\n\nEven if they do know all of this, they will only reduce their energy usage if their indulgence becomes too painful, financially, to keep it up.\n\nFor the utilities which deliver gas and electricity to our homes, the basic structure of a two-tier pricing structure, baseline usage and over-baseline usage, is already in place, but does not induce conservation because the price difference is too small. All we have to do now to make it work, to induce conversation, is to make the over-baseline unit price three or four times higher than the baseline unit price. Only then will people try not to exceed their baseline quantity: Turn off lights, heat or cool moderately only one or two rooms of the house, only use their dryers in emergencies, keep the refrigerator on a lower setting, etc.\n\nAs for gasoline, diesel, heating oil and coal - a hefty carbon tax will result in less usage of these products and induce people to switch to less polluting systems. The more carbon there is in a fuel, the higher the tax will be. Yes, four dollars a gallon for gas and six dollars a gallon for diesel is no fun, but it will, in ten years time, make our cities livable again.\n\nThese conservation inducing measures will of course be fought by the energy corporations who only want us to buy more energy at a higher price and a bigger profit margin for themselves. But the people, by reducing their usage of energy, have it in their power to turn a situation of excessive demand and high prices into one of excessive supply and lower prices.\n\nJan H. Visser\n\nBerkeley\n\nAccording to a recent progress report, The Berkeley Housing Authority’s efforts to become financially stable have fallen short of its goals raising questions about the agency’s future.\n\nUnlike most government agencies, the BHA is structured like a business, said Interim Housing Director Stephen Barton.\n\nThe agency is financially rewarded based on its production. So, if it fails to provide low-income tenants with Section 8 vouchers and those tenants are unable to find housing, the BHA does not receive federal funds.\n\nLast year the BHA lost $255,000, which was made up by the city’s general fund. Barton said this year BHA will likely lose between $250,000 and $300,000.\n\nThe BHA Board, made up of the City Councilmembers and two tenant representatives, has said the BHA may be dissolved if it can’t turn itself around.\n\nAnother possibility is that BHA management could be turned over to the Alameda County Housing Authority.\n\nBarton said there is a solid business plan in effect and the city is doing what it can to solve the agency’s problems.\n\nHe said the BHA has had success in accelerating the processing time for vouchers, but there is still a lot more to do before the problems are solved.\n\n“We could try to deal with that deficit by cutting staff, but then we wouldn’t be able to process and provide Section 8 vouchers, which is really the only way to solve the problem and still serve low-income tenants,” he said.\n\nAccording to the April 24 BHA progress report, the agency received another blow when Interim Manager Sheila Maxwell submitted her resignation just six months after she accepted the position. Maxwell was the fourth manager since 1991.\n\nShe did not return calls to the Daily Planet Thursday to respond to questions about the reasons for her resignation.\n\nBarton said he will oversee the BHA with the assistance of housing staffer Ted Katiama, until a replacement can be found.\n\nThe Housing and Urban Development Department, the federal agency that oversees the BHA, has approved 1,840 vouchers for Berkeley. Currently only 1,266 are in use, which represents 20 fewer than in January.\n\nBarton said the housing authority has taken steps to speed up the processing of Section 8 applicants, but the agency’s problems have been compounded by a shortage of housing and high market rents. According to the report, 105 of the 1,592 applicants have been approved for vouchers since January. But of those, only 31 have actually found housing.\n\nBarton said the BHA will likely re-prioritize the Section 8 waiting list to give first priority to applicants who are already have housing and are spending 50 percent or more of their income on rent. The BHA has also begun outreach programs to landlords that may be able to benefit by participating in the Section 8 program. At its meeting on Tuesday, the BHA Board approved an increase in Section 8 rental rates bringing the allowable rental subsidy in range of market rates.\n\nThe report also said the BHA has been hindered in approving more vouchers because applicants have not been showing up for scheduled interviews. During March there were 188 initial applicant interviews scheduled and 124 were no-shows.\n\nCouncilmember Dona Spring said much of the problem was created when the state approved the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act in January, 1999. The act allowed landlords to raise a unit’s rent each time it became vacant. Prior to Costa Hawkins, landlords who participated in the Section 8 program were exempt from rent control.\n\n“Ever since then we’ve had a steady stream of landlords leaving the Section 8 program,” she said. “It’s created a tremendous demand on housing in a market where there is no housing.”\n\nMayor Shirley Dean said the tough rent control as it existed in Berkeley prior to Costa Hawkins, was responsible for some of the housing problems the BHA is currently facing. She said the controls caused too much pent up demand for rental increases and as soon as landlords had an opportunity to cash in, they took it. “It caused all kinds of problems and the people who got hurt were the very people it was trying to protect,” she said.\n\nCouncilmember Mim Hawley said the BHA has to focus on outreach to landlords who can benefit from participating in the program. She said there are many landlords who can get higher and more regular rents than they are receiving now.\n\nShe added that if the BHA is turned over to the Alameda County Housing Authority there may be some advantages for Berkeley Section 8 tenants. “Berkeley is a university town and that will always make it tough to find available housing,” she said. “If the county takes over there will be a wider range of housing for tenants to chose from.”\n\nCouncilmember Linda Maio said that if the county takes over the BHA there would have to be an office located in town.\n\nBerkeley Lite is an occasional column on fighting back against those who’d like to shine us on.\n\nStraw.\n\nWe know about the proverbial straw man. Not real; someone or something set up to deflect attention.\n\nAnd a straw vote: a way to count yeas and nays, while not truly voting.\n\nOur own City Council held a straw vote at its meeting Tuesday night.\n\nCouncilmember Polly Armstrong said the vote was to save hard-working people from waiting all evening on wooden council chairs to talk about something the council was bound to pass anyway.\n\nAt issue was an item on Tuesday’s laundry list of issues maybe to be discussed – the council often refers to the list as an “agenda” – there was the question of approving a resolution on Community Development Block Grants. CDBG money is federal funds that support community organizations.\n\nThe city’s pitifully small council chambers was overflowing that night with people who had come to the meeting for a variety of reasons – the issue of compassionate treatment of homeless sleeping outdoors, a San Pablo Avenue development, an Oxford Street development, Housing Authority questions, the CDBG grant funds and more.\n\nIn its wisdom, and after an almost unanimous vote to do so (the turkey in the straw voting against the motion was the ever-oppositional Councilmember Kriss Worthington) the council took the straw vote and provisionally approved the city manager’s recommendations on the CDBG funding. (The real vote, they decided later, would take place at a specially scheduled meeting Thursday.)\n\nWhile Armstrong argued that the council almost always passes the manager’s annual recommendation, so it wasn’t necessary for speakers on that question to stay and address the council, Worthington countered that it was “outrageous” for the council to express its opinion before listening to the public at the scheduled public hearing.\n\nDemocracy is indeed unwieldy. But Worthington’s point is well taken – let the people have a true voice.\n\n***\n\nSpeaking of the public’s right to butt into officialdom, Berkeley Lite wanted to ask the Berkeley police about an incident observed a couple of weeks ago. Why were a couple of the city’s finest stationed in an unmarked car outside San Pablo Park training binoculars on a large group of Sunday picnickers? Why not send undercover folks into the park if they wanted to see the people hiding the Easter eggs or munching chicken up close? If they were afraid of trouble brewing among the large number of picnickers, why wouldn’t they send in those friendly-looking guys with cute legs and bikes - the guys who seem to know just how to chat it up with a crowd and at the same time remind them, in a friendly way, to keep in order?\n\nWe tried to ask the police these questions.\n\nCalling Chief Dash Butler’s office for a response, Berkeley Lite learned he was on vacation. And for the record, we should say to the top cop’s credit that, especially of late, he has regularly returned the Daily Planet’s calls.\n\nA staffer referred us to the police public information officer, who, it turned out, was also on vacation, so we called the officer taking his place. Several times. No call back.\n\nSo we’ve got no answer for our questions.\n\nNeither reporters nor the public should have to scale walls to get public information.\n\nHere’s another example of access denied: A few weeks ago a reporter tried to find out how many accidents had occurred over the last few years at the intersection where a young woman had been run over by a cement truck while crossing the street.\n\nThe interim traffic engineer told the Daily Planet he was not authorized to talk to the press. The police at the traffic bureau said they were similarly unauthorized and that the only spokesperson was the cops’ public information officer. It took five hours and half a dozen calls to reach the PIO. And then he referred the reporter back to the cops’ traffic bureau. By that time, the person who could have retrieved the computerized data had gone home.\n\n***\n\nSo now we’re waiting patiently for a proposed Sunshine Ordinance - a law to expand the public’s access to public information – to actually wend its way to council action.\n\nA month or so ago, Armstrong had pulled the resolution off the consent calendar, where items are passed unanimously and without discussion. She said she needed to learn more about whether the bottleneck for the free flow of information is city staff or if legislation is the key to opening up city government.\n\nWe believe stronger laws are needed to close loopholes in the Brown Act, the state’s open meeting law.\n\nStill, Armstrong has a point. The real deal has less to do with legislation than attitude. Do city bureaucrats want the public to know what’s going on and have the ability to participate in government? Does the City Council have the will to make sure the bureaucrats make maneuvering the halls of city government facile both for those who are familiar with bureaucracies and for those less familiar with the complexities of city government?\n\n***\n\nAnd now for a little gossip that could scarcely pass for public information. What would you think about having a poet for our next assemblymember? We’ve been told that today people are meeting with UC Professor and poet June Jordan to encourage her to make a run for the office. Just think, AB632928: “Owed to the price gaugers...” in iambic pentameter.\n\nStill, perhaps the idea of Jordan’s candidacy is just another straw man. Or woman.\n\nSANTA CRUZ — Adragon De Mello, no longer the boy wonder who graduated college at age 11, is about to face a challenge that life as a child prodigy could not have prepared him for.\n\nDe Mello, now a 24-year-old high-tech worker, took custody Thursday of his father – the man who tried to push him toward greatness, and who hoped his son would be a Nobel Prize winner by the age of 16.\n\nAgustin De Mello, dying of bladder cancer, was arrested March 15 after an alleged shootout with police. He has been released to the custody of his son pending trial.\n\n“This is a lot better,” Adragon said moments before his dad walked out of jail. “It killed me walking in here and seeing him.”\n\nAgustin will be under house arrest at his home along wind-swept bluffs overlooking a popular Pacific Ocean surfing spot. He will be electronically monitored, with a band around his ankle, pending his May 29 trial.\n\n“He wants to die at home. That’s been his concern from day one. He did not want to go to the hospital,” said Santa Cruz County assistant district attorney Christine McGuire.\n\nThe father and son became the center of a national debate in the 1980s over parents pushing children toward academic achievement. It led to a long estrangement between the two that only recently has been reconciled.\n\nAdragon received an associate degree with highest honors in 1987 from a two-year junior college at age 10. He graduated a year later from the University of California, Santa Cruz, with a degree in computational mathematics, becoming the youngest college graduate in U.S. history.\n\nUniversity officials later reviewed Adragon’s record, and said the boy had been allowed to take an “unconscionable” course load.\n\nBut Agustin wanted more, and publicly spoke of his hopes that his son would win a Nobel Prize and go on to lead an “intergalactic government.”\n\nAdragon never attained all his father’s goals. In fact, he spent most of his teenage years trying to recapture the childhood he never knew.\n\nNow, his life as a young adult again is centered on his dad.\n\nHe has spent the last few weeks sitting in a packed Santa Cruz courtroom, watching his shackled father cling to life in a rumpled jail jumpsuit. There were breaks in the proceedings so Agustin could go into a nearby bathroom and bleed.\n\nHis body wracked with pain, the 71-year-old Agustin phoned police March 15 saying he was gravely ill.\n\n“My problem is I’m dying of cancer. I’m standing here in a bathtub bleeding to death,” he told the 911 dispatcher.\n\nFour hours and several gunshots later, Agustin was taken from his home in handcuffs by a SWAT team. It remains unclear what happened during those four hours, but Agustin now is charged with assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe odyssey that now has reunited father and son began when Adragon was just 6 weeks old. It was then that his proud father said Adragon uttered his first word: “Hello.”\n\nBy 3, Adragon had learned how to read and write, his father claimed. And, even if those were exaggerated memories, no one could deny that Adragon was bright beyond his years.\n\nBut as Adragon’s academic achievements came together, the family fell apart. By the year he graduated from UCSC, Agustin was battling for custody against Adragon’s mother, Cathy Gunn, who felt the boy was being pushed too hard. A judge gave them joint custody.\n\nAdragon ended up living with his mother in Sunnyvale, enrolling in junior high and trying to catch up with a childhood supplanted by computers and scientific theories.\n\nAt first, Adragon was awful at being a kid. He swung his first baseball bat at age 12, only to see it fly wildly out of his hands. He had little experience with sports or children his own age after being sheltered by his dad for so many years.\n\n“A lot of people feel that I should have some sort of grudge against him for what happened when I was younger,” Adragon said. “There were years, mostly in teen-age years, that I was pretty bitter.”\n\nAdragon, living under the name James Gunn, graduated from Homestead High School in 1994, six years after receiving his undergraduate degree. After moving away from his father, he learned to drive and how to play with other children.\n\nNow, during jail visits, Adragon and Agustin have repaired their strained relationship.\n\n“I know he’s proud of me. Of course I didn’t get a Nobel Prize,” Adragon said. “I really didn’t have the desire to.”\n\nBack in his cluttered waterfront home, Agustin stood surrounded Thursday by pictures and momentos – as well as dozens of his weightlifting trophies, and photos of Albert Einstein.\n\nWith his health fading, Agustin said the only constant in his life is his relationship with Adragon.\n\n“He’s the best son in the world. We’ve always had a great relations"
