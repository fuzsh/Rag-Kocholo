        "text": "The 32-year-old Aurora Theatre Company faces dire financial difficulties due to a drop in attendance from the pandemic and has asked the community and Berkeley City Council for help to keep it afloat.\n\nCiting an increase in expenses, inflation, and losses in membership from the pandemic, the nonprofit theater said in May that it is seeking $350,000 to stay in business.\n\nJosh Costello, artistic director of the theater, asked the Council for help, saying the Aurora is “vital” to the culture of Berkeley and the Bay Area.\n\nThe 150-seat theater was founded in 1992 by actor and director Barbara Oliver and professional Bay Area theater artists who wanted to produce plays about “important ideas, mediated by language and people.”\n\nOver the years, it has consistently produced award-winning plays using largely local actors, including a play commissioned, developed and premiered at the theater — Jonathan Spector’s Eureka Day, opening on Broadway in November.\n\nAurora’s board of directors created a fundraiser in April to ease its $500,000 budget deficit, surpassing its $200,000 goal with a private funding and matching campaign. They also made an online petition to bring its plight to the City Council’s attention.\n\n“We are deeply moved by the outpouring of love and support from the community. We hope Aurora will continue to be a beloved arts institution and a vital part of the fabric of Berkeley,” Costello said.\n\nLast month, Councilmember Sophie Hahn proposed a one-time emergency grant of $150,000 for the theater and referred the item to this month’s budget talks. The Council is expected to approve its budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year on June 25.\n\nIf the city grants $150,000 to Aurora, the company says it will have time to decide how to meet the remaining deficit for the 2024-2025 season.\n\nCostello said the nonprofit is trying various ways to fill out its budget, including fundraising, applying for grants, encouraging younger audiences to attend plays, renting out the theater as event space and reducing programming to save on costs.\n\nBut unless the board finds new funding sources, “the board will have to decide whether to continue or shut down,” Costello said.\n\nAccording to the nonprofit’s tax filings, the theater company faced a $363,000 deficit last year, compared to a profit margin of $112,000 the previous year.\n\nAurora received a one-time $156,000 Paycheck Protection Program grant in 2020 and $1 million from the federal Shuttered Venue Operating Grant in 2021 that enabled the theater to continue to operate. However, Costello said the theater’s attendance is half of what it was in 2019. The theater previously had over 2,000 subscribers. Costello said other Bay Area venues have seen similar drops.\n\n“Subscriptions are up [this year] over [last year], so at least we’re trending in the right direction.” But increases in fixed expenses, “inflation and AB5 (the “gig law”) that increase the cost of our payroll are hurting our gem of a theater,” Costello said.\n\nThe theater is one of many arts institutions in Berkeley facing financial difficulties after dramatic changes in audience and viewership during COVID-19.\n\nAt a Council meeting in May, Hahn proposed an “arts rescue and maintenance measure” to support theaters and entertainment venues like Freight & Salvage, which is also experiencing a post-COVID budget deficit.\n\n“It’s existential, it’s across-the-board, it’s our small arts organizations and the larger ones,” Hahn said.\n\nIn recent years, the city has awarded funding to other arts institutions, including the UC Theatre, Capoeira Arts Foundation, Luna Kids Dance, the La Pena Cultural Center and the Kala Art Institute.\n\nThe Aurora Theatre hopes to premiere its 2024-2025 season in October with a wide variety of comedies and dramas, including Noël Coward’s classic comedy Fallen Angels, hip-hop collective Felonious, Lloyd Suh’s play The Heart Sellers about two immigrants’ first American Thanksgiving, Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage’s Crumbs from the Table of Joy, and Jane Wagner’s one-person show, The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe (which initially starred “9 to 5” actress Lily Tomlin)."
