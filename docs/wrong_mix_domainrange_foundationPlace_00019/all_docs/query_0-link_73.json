        "text": "Hosting more than 35 events in San Diego and bringing teams and visitors from all around the United States, Surf Sports is one of the largest and most successful event organizers in the City, generating an annual overall economic impact of $120 million.\n\nEach year, more than 490,000 people attend Surf Sports organized events in San Diego, generating 125,000 booked hotel rooms, more than the Rock â€˜nâ€™ Roll Marathon and second only to Comic-Con.\n\nSurf Sports serves a large youth demographic and its reach goes far beyond soccer. Over the past year Surf hosted more than 200,000 youth participants across a range of popular sports including lacrosse and soccer. These events serve as a platform by which kids can connect with colleges as well as the Olympic and US National teams.\n\nSurf Sports has been instrumental in helping kids achieve their college dreams. More than 1,500 college coaches attend Surf Sports events to recruit players, resulting in millions of dollars in scholarship awards.\n\nSurf Sports assumed operational control of the San Diego Polo Fields in 2012, and since that time has invested more than $4.5 million into daily maintenance and renovation of the facility and will continue to invest in this important community asset.\n\nSurf Sports has a world-class event and facility management staff, and employs San Diegoâ€™s foremost experts in natural grass maintenance.\n\nThe Surf Nation program is designed for Clubs looking to join a community of the top players, coaches, and sports management executives in the country. Our community is represented across all the major domestic leagues in North America and provides a player development pathway from grassroots through Surf Select, a national identification bringing the best players together locally, regionally, and nationally.\n\nThe Surf Nation Affiliate program benefits are significant â€” from free software to run your club to hands-on marketing support and, of course, nationally recognized player development and coaching curriculum from the 17x National Championship youth soccer club.\n\nSurf Sports Park is home to the premier youth soccer club in the nation, San Diego Surf Soccer Club. Our club competes at the highest levels in the top soccer leagues in the nation â€“ Elite Club National League (ECNL), the Elite Club Regional League (ECNL-RL), and the SoCal Soccer League.\n\nSurf Soccer Club consistently produces players who are considered to be the best in the sport, and has more than 157 players on National Teams, far surpassing any other club in the nation. Notable professional players who have worn the Surf jersey include Rachel Buehler Van Hollebeke, Catarina Macario, Mia Fishel, AJ Soares, Corey Baird and Luca de la Torre.\n\nSan Diego Surf Soccer Club brings 15 National Championships, national prestige and attention to San Diego, solidifying its reputation as a hotbed of soccer talent and excellent access to college. Since 1994, 98%+ of girls have received college scholarships and the boys program has experienced a 600% increase in the last 2 years.\n\nThe Surf Cup Charitable Foundation was launched in 1994. Over the years, this foundation has contributed more $4 million to local charities and has sponsored hundreds of teams who would not otherwise have been able to participate in Surf Sports tournaments. In addition to the foundation, the Surf SC leads the youth soccer market with its needs-based youth program. Together, these organizations have contributed more than $7 million combined.\n\nIn 2012, the outreach program was launched delivering subsidies for disadvantaged youths living in south San Diego. This program in its first three years has been a resounding success and has given hundreds of youths the opportunity for college exposure."
