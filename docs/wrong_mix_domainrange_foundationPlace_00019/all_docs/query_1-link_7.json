        "text": "Rules & Requirements\n\nPrerequisites: Previously passed an R1A course with a letter grade of C- or better. Previously passed an articulated R1A course with a letter grade of C- or better. Score a 4 on the Advanced Placement Exam in English Literature and Composition. Score a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Exam in English Language and Composition. Score of 5, 6, or 7 on the International Baccalaureate Higher Level Examination in English\n\nRequirements this course satisfies: Satisfies the second half of the Reading and Composition requirement\n\nObjectives & Outcomes\n\nCourse Objectives: Examines the signifying strategies of selected cinema movements from the second half of the twentieth century to the present. Familiarizes the students with the major technological and aesthetic innovations of the past 80 years which have given rise to the cinema as we know it today.\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes: Acquire a conceptual vocabulary to describe and analyze the formal strategies of films and the way they construct meaning.\n\nDevelop tools for analyzing the way film texts not only provide entertainment, but also produce cultural meanings and generate modes of experience (for example, of race, class, gender, sexuality, nation) and of social interaction.\n\nFoster students’ awareness of the aesthetic, economic, social and political contexts in which sound cinema developed and the impact which cinema had, in turn, on nations, cultures, and historical events.\n\nGive students a clear sense of some of the major movements in sound cinema (including classical and post-classical Hollywood cinema, documentary, Italian Neo-Realism, the French New Wave, Third Cinema, Political Cinema of the 1960s-‘70s, and film in the era of global multimedia) and how those movements intertwined with critical, theoretical, and popular responses to the medium.\n\nIntroduce students to the theoretical frameworks that have shaped thinking about the cinema.\n\nObjectives & Outcomes\n\nCourse Objectives: The course explores the international development of artist made, experimental and avant-garde film, electronic or new media practices. It looks at the ways artists have invented new formal languages in order to express their unique ideas and vision, and also how they have created alternative modes of production, distribution, and exhibition for their work. The course examines major movements in experimental and alternative media that exist outside of the constraints of industrial and mass media forms, as it at once critiques and expands dominant forms of media.\n\nTo broaden student awareness & understanding of the history of experimental & alternative film & media practices that exist outside of the dominant film industry, including fine art practices that have emerged from the visual & sonic arts rather than the dominant literary & dramatic forms. To study underground & marginal communities that have been under or unrepresented by the dominant film & media industries. The course will also look beyond the artwork itself to explore the kinds of creative sub-cultures communities that this approach to art making has produced.\n\nWhile emphasis on medium and technology may vary from year to year, depending on the instructor, conceptually, the course will always focus on film and media art as a form of personal and creative expression with a philosophical position that emphasizes process and invention over product and professional mastery.\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes: Acquire a conceptual and aesthetic vocabulary necessary for the recognition and interpretation of experimental and alternative media practices in different media forms and technologies and to understand why experimental approaches to media practices have influenced, the dominant film and media world, the art world and academic film and media studies.\n\nAcquire new informational content about the national/regional/global media landscape in question; with an emphasis on the role experimental film and media products play in the evolution of film and media language and form.\n\nDevelop the analytic skills necessary to interpret in a socio-historical and aesthetic context the art and media objects belonging to that area and learn about the cultural contexts in which those media practices are located.\n\nDevelop the research tools for advanced undergraduate writing on film and media in the area studied in the course.\n\nObjectives & Outcomes\n\nCourse Objectives: Examines the ways in which shared cultural discourses, institutions, histories, and modes of production are negotiated through various media practices within and between individual cities, nations, regions, and/or global networks.\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes: 1) Acquire new informational content about the national/regional/global media landscape in question, with an emphasis on the role media products play in articulating cultural affinities and differences.\n\n2) Acquire a conceptual vocabulary necessary for the examination of media practices organized in large cultural categories and to understand the advantages and limits of that approach.\n\n3) Develop the analytic skills necessary to interpret in a socio-historical and formal context the art and media objects belonging to that area and learn about the cultural contexts in which those media practices are located.\n\n4) Develop the research tools for advanced undergraduate writing on film and media in the area studied in the course.\n\nObjectives & Outcomes\n\nCourse Objectives: Examines the emergence and implementation of media technologies, the discourses surrounding them, their use by media institutions and/or artists, and the forms, styles, aesthetics, modes of address, and experiences they afford. Analyzes the histories of media technologies, their theorization by practitioners and scholars, and the various methodologies that have been used to understand their development, use, standardization, modification, and/or obsolescence.\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes: 1) Acquire new informational content about the technology in question, with an emphasis on the role technology plays in shaping media content, form, and aesthetics.\n\n2) Acquire a conceptual vocabulary necessary for the examination of the production, exhibition, and/or display technologies and formats and an understanding of the advantages and limits of that approach.\n\n3) Develop the analytic skills necessary to interpret in a socio-historical and formal context the art and media objects created with the help of specific technologies and their appeal.\n\n4) Develop the research tools for advanced undergraduate writing on film and media technologies studied in the course.\n\n5) Acquire an understanding of media transition and technological change within specific historical contexts.\n\nObjectives & Outcomes\n\nCourse Objectives: This course exposes students to current research on teaching student writing, encourages discussion of strategies and practices for R&C courses using both readings and moving-image media in the instructional content, and creates a structured space for current GSIs to workshop and troubleshoot issues from teaching in progress during the semester’s instruction.\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes: 2. be able to create and evaluate the effectiveness of lesson plans and assignments that employ active learning strategies (e.g., discussion, collaborative problem solving, applied practice) in the study of moving-image media materials;\n\n3. know the standards of ethical conduct by which they and their students must abide and how to provide a welcoming and respectful learning environment for a diverse student body;\n\n4. know general and field-specific University policies and resources for teaching film and media composition courses on the Berkeley campus, such as those pertaining to students with disabilities, students in distress, student athletes, sexual harassment, academic integrity, and instructional technology;\n\n5. know how to assess student learning and grade student work fairly, consistently, and efficiently, with special attention to the structural and cultural differences in preparation that present barriers to learning effective writing;\n\n6. be able to use feedback and assessment tools such as mid-semester evaluations to improve teaching;\n\n7. be able to reflect upon teaching and learning and explain why they make the choices they do as teachers in their field;\n\n8. know how to effectively communicate and collaborate with members of a teaching team (e.g., faculty instructor, head GSI, co-instructors, fellow GSIs, Readers, course support staff).\n\nUpon completion of the course, GSIs should:\n\n1. know effective practices, current directions, and resources for engaging students in writing about film and media;"
