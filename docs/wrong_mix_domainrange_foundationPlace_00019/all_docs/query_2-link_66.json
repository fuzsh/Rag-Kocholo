        "text": "At UCSF \"(business) meetings\" means expenditures for meals or light refreshments and related services (e.g., labor charges, room rental, equipment rental, and similar expenditures) incurred in connection with meetings of employees to conduct official University business. At least one University employee or other individual representing the University must be present at any business meeting that includes non-University persons.\n\n\"Entertainment\" means expenditures for meals or light refreshments and related services (e.g., labor charges, room rental, equipment rental, decorations, flowers, and similar expenditures) incurred in connection with events that are primarily social or recreational activities in support of the University's mission. These activities must support an underlying University business purpose such as promoting goodwill or cultivating donors. Entertainment usually has a guest-host relationship, in which an official guest or guests attend an event, at the invitation of a UCSF host, for a business purpose. Although administrative meetings might not typically include a guest-host relationship, they too may incur allowable entertainment expenses. In general, entertainment expenses must be cost effective and make the best use of public funds.\n\nRead the full policy: University of California – Policy BUS 79: Expenditures for Business Meetings, Entertainment, and Other Occasions\n\nAllowable Expenses\n\nEntertainment-Related Expenses\n\nUniversity Employee on Travel Status – Entertainment expenses incurred while an employee in on travel status should be itemized and submitted with the Travel Expense Report to ensure that the meals associated with travel are separate from those meals associated with hospitality.

Business and Finance Bulletin BUS-79, Expenditures for Entertainment, Business Meetings, and Other Occasions, will be revised to include this information.\n\nThe maximum amount per person that can be reimbursed for allowable entertainment occasions varies depending on the type of meal served.\n\nMeal Type\n\nMaximum per person\n\non or after 11/1/2021\n\nMaximum per person on or after 7/1/2022 Breakfast $28 $31 Lunch $49 $54 Dinner $85 $94 Light Refreshment $20 $22\n\nThese amounts include the cost of food and beverages, labor, sales tax, service and delivery charges. The cost of room rental, room set-up fees, media rental and decorations, etc., are not included in the per-person costs unless these costs cannot be separated by the vendor.\n\nFund Source Restrictions\n\nAlcohol. Only a limited number of funding sources permit the purchase of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. These product purchases may not be charged to federal or state funds.\n\nFrequency Rules. In order to keep the value of meals provided to employees from being considered taxable income, the meals should only be provided infrequently. UCOP has provided guidelines for providing meals and light refreshments in connection with business meetings, entertainment event, or employee morale- building activity:\n\nMeals should be limited to no more than once a month or 12 times per year, per group.\n\nLight refreshments should be limited to no more than twice per month, per group.\n\nState Appropriations General Funds (19900A)\n\nAny portion of meal expenses in excess of the allowed amounts\n\nAlcoholic beverage expenses\n\nThe costs of tickets to shows, sporting events and other similar entertainment venues\n\nExceptional entertainment (entertainment requiring approval for policy exception)\n\nSpecific and Special State Appropriations (199XXA, 18000A-18199A)\n\nAny portion of meal expenses in excess of the allowed amounts\n\nAlcoholic beverage expenses\n\nTickets to shows, sporting events and other similar entertainment venues\n\nContract and Grants Funds\n\nAlcoholic beverage expenses\n\nExpenses not specifically authorized by the contract or grant award\n\nOther Funds\n\nEndowments, gifts, and all other funds administered by UCSF\n\nAny expenses restricted by the funding agency\n\nContracting with Vendors\n\nWhen contracting with a non-UC facility (e.g., hotel, conference center, restaurant), you must work with your Supply Chain Management (SCM) Department-Assigned Buyer to have the contract reviewed and approved before the event. Submit your request in BearBuy using the Facility Rental form. The purchase requisition will be reviewed by your Department-Assigned Buyer. Start early and allow sufficient time for Supply Chain Management’s review, potential changes, and negotiation with the vendor. Once the requisition is fully approved, a purchase order (PO) will be dispatched to the vendor. Then, you can request payment of any deposit or payment due by following the Facility Rental Payment Processing Instructions.\n\nNote: An agreement regarding logistics only (e.g., food, price, attendee count) with no binding contractual language does not require review by your Department-Assigned Buyer and should not be submitted on the Facility Rental form. These simple confirmations do not need to be routed to a Buyer, as long as the confirmation does not include any terms and conditions. Please refer to Payments to Vendors below.\n\nDocumentation\n\nKeep all of your documentation related to the event in one location or folder.\n\nKeep detailed receipts for all expenses and a list of attendees including their titles.\n\nKeep copies of documents before you send them to other departments, vendors, or individuals.\n\nApprovals Required\n\nAll expenses related to meeting and entertainment will require approval from an individual who has been given approval authority and has a signature card on file with Accounts Payable or was granted an “authorized approver” role in MyExpense.\n\nExceptional or Additional Approval\n\nExceptional or additional approval is required for all: employee morale-building and recognition activities; tickets provided to prospective donors, employees or student appointees; entertainment of the spouse or domestic partner of the official host or guest. Only select individuals throughout the campus have been delegated this authority (Chancellor, VCs, Deans, plus a few high-level other employees). Review the UCSF Travel and Entertainment Approval Matrix to determine who has exceptional approval for your area. Exceptional approvals are submitted to Accounts Payable using the Supplemental Form for Contracted Facility Rental and Exceptional Meeting & Entertainment Expenses.\n\n* Campuses may require the signature of the individual requesting payment in those situations that do not require the host signature. Electronic workflow methods of obtaining host approval are acceptable in lieu of a “wet” signature. Meals also include light refreshments unless otherwise noted.\n\n** Approval as an exception to policy is required for any expenditure that exceeds the maximum per-person rates for meals and light refreshments. Electronic workflow methods of obtaining additional approval are acceptable provided that the approver has delegated authority and budgetary approval over the account being charged.\n\nCash Contribution or Donations\n\nAll contribution, donations, or table fees require additional approval by University Relations. University policy does not permit contributions in connection with any event sponsored by an organization associated either directly or indirectly with a political party, campaign, candidate, or group engaged in an attempt to influence legislation, elections, referenda or similar activities.\n\nPurchasing Catering & Facility Rentals\n\nThe following guidelines pertain to UCSF campus departments.\n\nCatering for on-campus events should be purchased from the BearBuy America To Go (ATG) punch-out. ATG will electronically submit your invoice to BearBuy referencing your purchase order (PO).\n\nCatering for on-campus events can also be purchased from Moffitt Catering Moffitt Catering will be paid via campus recharge.\n\nFor off-campus catering orders in which no contract is proposed by the vendor, UCSF campus departments may submit the invoice for payment in BearBuy using the Meeting & Entertainment Payment Request Form. Alternatively, you may pay the caterer with your UCSF Procurement Card (P-Card) or Corporate Travel Card.\n\nWhen contracting with a non-UC facility (e.g., hotel, conference center, restaurant), follow the Facility Rental procedure to have the contract reviewed by your SCM Department-Assigned Buyer and create a purchase order (PO) with the vendor before the event. Then, follow the Facility Rental Payment Processing Instructions to request payment for any deposit or payment due. Suppliers should not submit Facility Rental invoices through Transcepta.\n\nReimbursements\n\nAs a best practice, Campus departments should purchase catering using the methods above.\n\nUse personal funds to purchase catering only if you are not able to use the methods above.\n\nReimbursement requests must be submitted through MyExpense.\n\nThe expense report should be submitted within 45 days after the last purchase date. Payments of reimbursement requests submitted after 60 days will be reported as taxable income, read more about late expense reports.\n\nA reimbursement request is generally submitted after the event and provides the business justification, total expense, a list of attendees (including their titles), funding sources, types of meeting, date of meeting, etc.\n\nThe expense report must be routed to the appropriate Authorized Approver.\n\nExpenses of $75 or more per occasion must be supported by original itemized receipts, which must be submitted with the request for payment. If you've lost or misplaced the receipt and cannot obtain a duplicate receipt or an itemized original receipt is not available, please attach the Declaration of Missing Receipt Form to your expense report.\n\nNote: Expenses related to an employee's birthday celebration, wedding, anniversary, or other personal occasion are not reimbursable."
