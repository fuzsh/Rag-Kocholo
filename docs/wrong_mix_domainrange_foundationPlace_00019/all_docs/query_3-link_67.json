        "text": "SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\n\nEligibility\n\nEligible Applicants\n\nWe accept applications from Principal Investigators (PIs) who meet the eligibility criteria below.\n\nPI's institution: PIs must belong to a university, educational institution, or governmental/non-profit research institute. (E.g. we accept submissions from research institutes that are categorized as governmental and NPO/NGO in nature index tables.)\n\nPI's position: PIs must be a full-time professor (adjunct professors and adjunct researchers are not eligible) or researcher and be eligible to supervise Ph.D. students at the PI's institution. Full professors, associate professors, and assistant professors are eligible to apply. For the UK, this includes Senior Lecturers, Principal Lecturers, Lecturers, and Readers who are eligible to supervise Ph.D. students at their institutions.\n\nCountries: The PI's institution must be in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n\nCo-PI(s)\n\nWe accept applications that have a PI and one or more co-PIs for the same proposal as long as all co-PIs are from the same institution as the PI. However, only one award is made to the PI and the PI's university/institution if the proposal is selected. All co-PIs must meet the same eligibility criteria as that for a PI, and co-PIs will be required to sign program documents.\n\nMultiple Proposal Submissions\n\nA PI or different PIs from the same university/institution may submit more than one proposal for different research topics. However, we ask each PI to please not submit identical proposals, and for each PI to not submit more than one proposal for each research topic. Sony will gladly accept an unlimited number of proposals from the same university for the same research topic as long as they each have different PIs. Note that at the bottom of your submission confirmation email, there is a link to resubmit your proposal in the event that you discover that your original had an error or an omission. Please use this link for resubmissions. Do not resubmit identical proposals. Also, please do not submit \"test\" submissions. In the rare event that you do not receive a confirmation email for your submission, please complete the Inquiry Form available here informing us of your issue.\n\nRequirements\n\nTarget Award\n\nPlease select one target award between the Focused Research Award and the Faculty Innovation Award when you submit a proposal. Refer to the following comparison chart:\n\nTarget Research Topic\n\nPlease select one Focused Research Theme for your proposal if you choose the Focused Research Award. Please select one keyword (the single most relevant keyword for your proposal) if you choose the Faculty Innovation Award.\n\nResearch Agreement\n\nA sponsored research agreement is required that is mutually agreed upon by Sony**, the PI, and his/her institution on all program terms including objectives, milestones, publication, use of research, and patent rights before any award is made or funding is available. This sponsored research agreement is negotiable at the award stage and must be between Sony**, the PI, and the PI's university/institution only. The sponsored research agreement will be for the benefit of the Sony legal entity specifically contracting with the PI's university/institution as well as Sony's corporate affiliates.\n\nTerm of Proposals\n\nPlease submit proposals for a one-year period only. No multi-year proposals will be accepted. An extension of the research may be possible depending upon the results of the research collaboration in year one, but it will require a separate discussion for another award the following year.\n\nMinimum Deliverables\n\nThree (3) quarterly reports and a final research summary report are required at a minimum.\n\nVisiting Researcher Support\n\nSony may request the PI to support a Sony visiting researcher(s) at Sony's option and expense.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nProposal authors or universities/institutions must ensure that no confidential or proprietary information is included in submitted proposals. Sony will treat all information submitted in proposals as non-confidential and non-proprietary.\n\nIntellectual Property (IP) Rights\n\nIP rights are negotiable at the award stage and will be specified in the sponsored research agreement. At a minimum, Sony and its corporate affiliates require the right to utilize the results of the research that Sony or its corporate affiliates sponsor for noncommercial purposes, including results that describe potentially patentable subject matter. Sony and its corporate affiliates will also require rights to any background IP that is required to utilize the research results sponsored. No submissions are allowed that use background IP to which the PI and his/her institution do not have the full authority to grant noncommercial use rights to Sony and its corporate affiliates.\n\nProposal Format\n\nPlease include the required items listed below in your submission:\n\nTitle, abstract, methods, goals/milestones, references, and either one Focused Research Theme (if for the Focused Research Award) or one primary keyword (if for the Faculty Innovation Award).\n\nPlease describe your submission's differentiation from the current state-of-the-art.\n\nPlease include the best contact email address and phone number (complete with country code) for the PI.\n\nAll proposal contents must fit within 11 pages (a ten-page maximum proposal with references and a one-page budget summary). The file format must be a PDF or a MS Word file format and must be under 16 MB in size. Out of consideration to reviewers, please limit your minimum font size to a 10-point font.\n\nCurriculum Vitae (CV)\n\nThe CV for the PI must be included when you submit a proposal. The CV file must be a separate file from the proposal file. There is no page limitation for the CV, however the CV file size must be under 16 MB.\n\nBudget Guidelines\n\nThe Focused Research Award is limited to a maximum of $150K USD* per proposal. The Faculty Innovation Award is limited to a maximum of $100K USD* per proposal. This funding is a sponsored research grant that is to be used to conduct the research described in the proposal, and includes any overhead related to this research and any and all other fees or charges needed to carry out the research. There is a single payment for the award and it is all-inclusive of all associated expenses and fees. Sony will not specify a maximum amount or percentage of the budget that may be allocated to overhead.\n\nSubmission\n\nSubmission Terms and Conditions\n\nThe submitter must agree to the 2024 Sony Research Award Program Submission Terms and Conditions (click here to see) before submitting a proposal. Please obtain a prior review of your submission by your institution's sponsored research office if they require a review of research proposals prior to their submission.\n\nSubmission Protocol\n\nSubmissions must be done through the online submission form.\n\nClick here to open the submission form\n\nSubmissions made by email will not be accepted. Submissions must be in the English language or they will not be accepted. Submitters will automatically receive a confirmation email once they complete the online submission form and process. Please keep the confirmation email as proof of each submission.\n\nDeadline\n\nSubmissions must be completed by 11:59 pm PDT (Pacific Daylight Time; UTC-7) on September 15, 2024 / 8:59 am CEST (Central European Summer Time; UTC+2) September 16, 2024 / 12:29 pm IST (Indian Standard Time; UTC+05:30) September 16, 2024.\n\nDuplicate Submissions and Resubmissions\n\nDuplicate submissions will not be accepted for the same proposal title from the same PI. Please do not make duplicate submissions. Use the resubmission link at the bottom of your confirmation email if you discover that your submission has an error or an omission.\n\nRequired Information for the Online Submission Form\n\nThe following information will be required in order to complete the online submission form for each proposal submitted.\n\nProposal information; proposal title, proposal file (11 pages maximum including proposal, references, and 1-page budget summary by research quarter), and either one Focused Research Theme (if for the Focused Research Award) or one primary keyword (if for the Faculty Innovation Award).\n\nPI's Information; PI's full name, PI's title, PI's CV file, PI's email address, and PI's department name.\n\nOnly for the US and Canada, please enter your SAT International Code for PI's university/institute (please find PI's SAT International code here). Please be careful to use the correct code because some schools have several codes to designate different programs or campuses. Also note that some school names use common abbreviations (e.g., INST for INSTITUTE) or simply truncate some words in the school's name when searching for a school code. Please enter \"0000\" if you cannot find the four-digit SAT International Code for your school.\n\nSubmitter's Information, if not the PI (optional); Submitter's full name and email address\n\nAward Candidates\n\nAnnouncement of Review Results\n\nPrincipal Investigators (PIs) will be notified of the submission review results for each proposal submitted around March of 2025. Sony will only be able to provide some limited feedback on the review process results for the highest-ranked proposals due to limited resources.\n\nFunding\n\nProgram details will be negotiated with a PI and their university/institution if their proposal is selected. Funding will be available only after we have agreed to the terms of and signed a sponsored research agreement.\n\nInquiries\n\nInquiries Related to the 2024 Sony Research Award Program\n\nPlease contact us via the Inquiry Form if you have a question regarding the 2024 Sony Research Award Program. The Research Award Program Administration Office is the only resource that can officially answer your question(s).\n\nInquiries Outside of the 2024 Sony Research Award Program\n\nPlease visit www.sony.com and contact the appropriate channel listed at the bottom of the web page if you have questions outside of the Sony Research Award Program (such as business proposals, joint venture proposals, research proposals that are not related to any of Focused Research Themes or keywords for the Faculty Innovation Award), or any other inquiry or proposal."
