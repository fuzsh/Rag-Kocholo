        "text": "Dr. Sara Parmigiani\n\nIn this psychology and neuro Pre-College in California, you’ll learn with leading experts in the field. A staff scientist at the Keller Laboratory at Stanford University, Sara Parmigiani holds a Ph.D. in Cognitive and Brain Sciences from the University of Trento, Italy.\n\nThe focus of the Keller lab is working on novel methods, mechanistic insights, and personalized treatments to improve mental health. Dr. Parmigiani’s current work includes the study of brain stimulation and recording, with the goal of developing personalized neurotherapeutics and clinical interventions that leverage our understanding of neuroplasticity. During her free time, Sara enjoys the outdoors, ranging from hiking to horse trail riding with her family.\n\nThis Explorations at Berkeley program in psychology and neuroscience for high school students California give you access to experts across multiple institutions in the greater Bay Area and nearby, including UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and more.\n\nWhat Lights Me Up:\n\n“I joined theater this semester and it’s a blast! I like being part of this giant group putting together a musical. We’re doing Chicago. I’m working on sets and costumes. When I’m not doing that, I have a part-time job at the humane society. Dogs-are-my-life. I want to adopt them all!”\n\nWhether as a residential student living on campus with a roommate and eating in the dining hall, or as a commuter joining us for the day and optional evenings, you’ll experience life in one of the country’s most renowned academic capitals. Stroll among the famous campus redwoods or explore the bustling college town right outside. Nearby, you’ll find arty San Francisco, high-tech Silicon Valley, and beautiful beaches."
