        "text": "Chaparral House is Berkeley’s Premier Skilled Nursing Facility\n\nChaparral House is a consistently highly rated Nonprofit Skilled Nursing Eldercare Community providing resident-centered care in a home-like environment. We also have received a variety of awards for staff training and quality care.\n\nChaparral House is staffed by loving, caring people skilled at meeting the needs of the aging population. Licensed nurses and Certified Nursing Assistants are on duty 24 hours a day, every day. Prescribed medications are administered by a licensed nurse at physician’s orders. Restorative as well as supportive nursing care is provided as needed with bathing, dressing and grooming, and eating.\n\nBecause of our holistic philosophy that encourages residents to enjoy life as fully as possible despite any limitations they may have from disability or illness, we also provide numerous programs and opportunities for residents to remain active and engaged. Exercise, current events, discussion groups, art classes, birthday and holiday celebrations, and a wide variety of live musical entertainment are provided for residents, all coordinated by a full-time Activities Director and well trained staff. Residents are also offered a choice of religious programs for most faith traditions, coordinated by our Staff Chaplain, including weekly Christian services as well as Jewish Shabbat and holiday celebrations."
