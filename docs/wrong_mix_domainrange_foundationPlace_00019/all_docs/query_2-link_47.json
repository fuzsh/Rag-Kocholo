        "text": "Tim Rosa joined Somnee as our new CEO in November 2023. Tim has over 20 years of experience in consumer and enterprise marketing, business management, and launching world-class brands, products, and services. Previously, Tim served as the Chief Marketing Officer at Fitbit, where he was pivotal in establishing the category of connected health and fitness wearable products. He built the organizationâ€™s global marketing function, growing it from 5 to more than 120, and in turn, helped Fitbit IPO and become a beloved top 20 consumer brand with more than 140M devices sold in over 100 countries and 40,000 retailers, and ultimately selling to Google for $2.1 billion. Tim has advised or worked for brands, including Electronic Arts, 2K Sports, ESPN Videogames, and Jasper Health. Tim attended the University of Michigan-Flint and enjoys sleeping 7.5 hours each night and being active, whether surfing, mountain biking, trail running, CrossFit, or Yoga.\n\nDr. Ram Gurumoorthy is the Chief Technology Officer, and on the founding research team at StimScience. Before StimScience, he was the Chief Science & Technology Officer and Principal Investigator of NeuroFocus Inc. (acquired by Nielsen Consumer Research), where he directed a global team of Neuroscientists, Neurophysiologists, Signal Processing Experts, Algorithm Developers, and Product Engineers. Neurofocus used proprietary brain state measurements to understand consumers' responses (emotion, memory and attention) to products, advertising, package/shopping experiences, and entertainment. This is the pioneering neuroscientific technology that Nielsen now uses to measure consumer attention, engagement, and memory retention.\n\nHe also founded and held leadership positions at Vigilant Privacy Corporation; PersonalDisc, where he pioneered industry-leading technologies for securing digital media; and BoardVantage (acquired by Nasdaq). Ram was a Partner & Chief Technology Officer of Meridian Consulting, LLC, and before that, he was at GE Corporate R&D, where he worked across the global businesses of GE. He has worked on several medical technologies, including MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound, as well as satellite navigation systems. Ram has a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and has several publications and US and international patents.\n\nDr. Matthew Walker earned his PhD in neurophysiology from the Medical Research Council in London, UK, and subsequently became an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School in 2004. He is currently Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, where he directs the Center for Human Sleep Science. Walker is the recipient of funding awards from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, and in 2006, became a Kavli Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences. He investigates the role of sleep in human health and disease. He does so using brain imaging methods (MRI, PET scanning), high-density sleep EEG recordings, genomics, proteomics, autonomic physiology, and cognitive testing. Walker addresses issues of both wellness and disease. Disorders that he currently tackles include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cancer, depression, anxiety, insomnia, cardiovascular disease, drug abuse, obesity and diabetes. His Center's goal, unachievable as they may be: to understand everything about sleep's impact on the human being, from birth to death, in health and in sickness. Walker is the author of the International Bestseller, Why We Sleep. The book has been translated into over 40 different languages, and was listed as one of Bill Gates's top 5 favorite books of 2019. Walker has also given a main-stage TED talk, viewed over 13 million times. Dr. Walker is on the Somnee founding research team that drove the published study validating our technology.\n\nDr. Robert Knight is Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at UC Berkeley. He has a BS in Physics from the Illinois Institute of Technology, an MD from Northwestern University Medical School, did Neurology training at UC San Diego and Post-Doctoral training at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. He was Director of the UC Berkeley Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute from 2001- 2011. He has twice received the Jacob Javits Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke for Distinguished Contributions to Neurological research, the IBM Cognitive Computing Award, the German Humboldt Prize in Neurobiology, the Distinguished Career Contribution Award from the Cognitive Neuroscience Society, the Award for Education in Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience and the Howard Crosby Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists for Distinguished Career Contributions. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Knight is an international expert on the role of human cortex in organized behavior and has published extensively on the neurophysiological mechanisms of sleep in both health and disease. Dr. Knight is on the Somnee founding research team that drove the published study validating our technology.\n\nDr. Rich Ivry is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at UC Berkeley. He earned a BS in Psychology from Brown University and a PhD from the University of Oregon. He has served as the chair of Psychology and director of the Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences. Prof. Ivry heads the Cognition and Action lab, using various tools of cognitive neuroscience to explore human performance in healthy and neurologically impaired populations. He is a co-author of Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind, a textbook that has helped train a generation of students. His research contributions have been recognized with major honors including the Troland Prize from the National Academy of Sciences and the William James Award for lifetime achievement from the Association for Psychological Science. Prof. Ivry is a fellow of the APS, the Society of Experimental Psychology, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His research has been funded by the National Institute of Health for over 30 years, including a recipient of the Outstanding Investigator Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Ivry is a world-renowned expert on using non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance human performance and is on the Somnee founding research team that drove the published study validating our technology."
