        "text": "Tim Madden (Ryan O’Neal) wakes up to the sounds of someone in his kitchen, and though he suspects an unwanted intruder, he discovers it is his tough guy dad, Dougy Madden (Lawrence Tierney) who wants to know what the hell is happening with his son. What follows is about fifty minutes of back story, going through a marital breakup between Tim and his gal Patty (Debra Stipe), the later seduction of the sexually secure Jessica Pond (Frances Fisher), some backstory about the One That Got Away, Madeleine (Isabella Rossellini), the return of Wardley Meeks III (John Bedford Lloyd)—a man Tim cuckolded before this story even began—and Tim’s unintentional involvement in a crime caper involving two million dollars, a cocaine deal, and crooked cop Capt. Alvin Luther Regency (Wings Hauser). Also, there might be one or two severed heads in Tim’s cellar.\n\nTrying to parse out the actual storyline is half the mystery of the movie, and once the situation is present, seeing how the pieces all come together for the suspenseful finale is also part of the fun. Writer/director/literary icon Norman Mailer blends black comedy, crime pictures, and light touches of gothic horror in a strange little mystery about life in P-town with his 1987 oddity, Tough Guys Don’t Dance.\n\nTough Guys Don’t Dance is a film I actually actively disliked while watching. The dialogue was awkward, the editing was strange, the characters were not really ones I could fully grok in terms of motivation. My hand remained poised at my temple, ready to start scratching at a moment’s notice when a fresh “twist” would beg the question, “What the hell am I watching?”\n\nHowever, when the movie was over, and I had the chance to figure out what it was trying to do and what it actually did, I actually grew a fondness for it. At first, it seemed like a send up of a crime story told by someone who has no real idea how crime stories are supposed to behave. So-called “Literary” authors have tried to “fix” genre fiction before, and the results typically (though not always) miss their mark but good. Here, we get a sense of Mailer trying to lens something that’s both critical toward and yet a fan of the sorts of titles that once upon a time appeared under the Fawcett Gold Medal line and, more recently, get issued under Hard Case Crime or Stark House Crime imprints. Good old tales of morally complicated guys in trouble up to their necks.\n\nThe Cannon Group logo appears front and center at the picture’s start, so that should tell us we’re in strange waters from the get-go. The list of producers on this piece adds whole new wrinkles of “huh?” On the one hand we get Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan. On the other hand, we get executive producer spots for both Francis Ford Coppola and Tom Luddy, the former of which needs no introduction, but the latter of which has producer/exec producer credits on artistic fare like Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1982), Barfly (1987), and 1993’s adaptation of The Secret Garden. That mix is almost a warning about what will follow. Artistic and yet off the wall, uneasy, disturbing, but nevertheless interesting.\n\nTough Guys Don’t Dance seems to be drawing its inspiration from a similar pool that fuels David Lynch’s works from that period. Crime and horror afflicted with horror film elements. It’s trying to do something different that what’s been done before, and ultimately it succeeds, but it’s also pretty off putting, at least to fans of the genres it’s working within.\n\nThe horror stuff is subtle but pervasive. A séance occurs that ends abruptly with people screaming, and after this we get a sense of the otherworldly touching upon normal life, though we never once see a ghost or specter manifest. In fact, just after the film fades out, we get an uproarious laugh from Frances Fisher’s character, a ghostly effect that leaves us wondering if the survivors of the flick will end up with the happiness they believe they will.\n\nAlthough it enjoys an unusual structure and odd lines of dialogue, it still retains a kind of traditional Hollywood look. Provincetown is as atmospheric as Twin Peaks, and the ocean is a character unto itself. This is in no small part due to John Bailey. He is credited as Visual Consultant in the opening titles, but who served as cinematographer for the piece. And he knows how to photograph something, using all the cinematographic tools to make it interesting.\n\nThat said, quite a bit of attention is paid to the production design, adding to the comedy in places (the corrupt cop’s house has guns on every wall and seemingly in every visible room, including what appears to be a machine gun over the fireplace) and darker touches elsewhere.\n\nAnd speaking of Lynchian connections, the score for Tough Guys Don’t Dance comes from David Lynch regular, Angelo Badalamenti. It is a beautiful orchestral score. The opening title credits showing off Provincetown, Massachusetts plays beautifully against the music. The scenes with Badalamenti’s orchestrations are made all the more pleasing. Unfortunately, the music in the final cut of the picture is not terribly extensive. The theme playing in those opening titles gets quite a few reuses in the picture, and there seem to be only a handful of other tracks used in the rest of the film. They are lush and lovely things, to be sure, but I wish the filmmakers had decided to mix it up a little with some other tracks.\n\nIn my estimation, there are three standout performances in the piece.\n\nWings Hauser gets to play a crazy assed cop, a dude who must have sex twice a day or spiral into despair, a guy who gets a hardon while telling a story about a cop investigating a crook and amassing the detail to put the dude away. He sells the thing quite nicely, improving or delivering the lines with unusual inflections. Hauser is always an interesting watch, unpredictable. He uses this to his advantage here, quite nicely.\n\nDebra Stipe puts on a thick southern accent for her role as Patty, and she gets to deliver some of the bawdiest lines in the movie. Her character is the femme fatale of the piece, a woman with a heart made out of cyanide who isn’t afraid to kill anyone who gets in her way. Her motivations are difficult to pin down, and her abuses of protagonist Tim are rather intense, brutal, and shocking. It was fun to see her on screen, even though I was looking forward to her eventual fall.\n\nThe mirror reflection to the Patty character, another blonde with complicated morals, is played by Frances Fisher. She also gets some brazen bits in the drama, though her character is not as evil as Stipe’s. Her role is more complex, or at least more ambiguous, and she embraces it.\n\nAlthough the movie feels like a send up of the sorts of things David Lynch was doing at the time, a retro crime picture like Blue Velvet (1986) though without any of the fifties aesthetics or a single character with decent moral compass, the movie actually seems to predict the sort of material Lynch would turn to in the 90s. In particular, Lost Highway (1997) feels like a nightmarish retort to this particular film, both in the manifestation of crime and the use of characters that seem to be funhouse mirror reflections of one another. However, whereas Lynch’s visions are fueled by both a quiet sense of innocence and a raunchy sense of voyeuristic brutality, Mailer seems far more intrigued by the ways people hurt one another. His film lacks any appreciable space for gentleness of any kind. Innocence, apparently, is for wusses.\n\nThe movie is very much engaged with masculinity. Tim Madden is a kind of sensitive sort, a writer who does some strange things but tends to be far more sensible than either his dad or the corrupt Capt. Alvin Luther Regency gives him credit for. In the opening of the film, he’s confronted with his own dad’s uncertainty about his manliness, insinuated to be a cocksucker. He’s later asked if he feels like a faggot. There are plenty of other people who are called that latter word, and they happen to be gay. The movie just seethes with the kinds of showy masculinity that would, decades later, be termed toxic. In fact, it is toxic. These people are all awful, awful folks. Even our ostensible hero is no saint—he offers to bang a man’s girl in front of him, and then makes good on it. Mailer’s film is sympathetic to his macho dudes, in much the same way that James Ellroy is sympathetic to his macho dudes or Ernest Hemingway is sympathetic to his manly men. These guys are hardboiled motherfuckers, and the women in their lives fall into the roles of nurturing or destructive, angels or whores. If you can get past the weird sexual politics and rampant slurs, the movie can achieve a kind of poetic rhythm about its passions. Guys swagger, gays gape, and gals break balls. As a bisexual man, I found it challenging to get past my instinctive need to turn the thing off, but my desire to figure out what the hell I was seeing proved to be enough to see me to the end.\n\nIn the final analysis, I’m glad I did so. Maybe?\n\nTough Guys Don’t Dance is a weird little flick. It’s not a movie I would have sought out on its own, but I’m glad to have seen the thing. It’s an intriguing experiment, and a movie that doesn’t work at all well in the moment but comes together in surprising ways after it’s over and we have time to reflect on it. It’s a challenging flick, and one I cannot say is a good film and yet might nevertheless somehow become a quirky masterpiece of the hypermasculine avant-garde. This is the sort of movie the apt phrase “WTF?!?” was intended to describe.\n\n#\n\nTough Guys Don’t Dance is available in DVD and Blu-ray editions.\n\nNext week, our Weird Wednesday Watch series will continue to plow into crime flick territory with Whatever It Takes (1998), a cops versus crooks flick with a cast that includes Don “The Dragon” Wilson, Andrew Dice Clay, and Fred Williamson. It is available in a DVD edition. The Blu-ray release is a part of the Vinegar Syndrome Archives, which means it is only available through the VinSyn site or brick and mortar stores.\n\nWriting for “A Horror Movie of the Mind: Tough Guys Don’t Dance” is copyright © 2021 by Daniel R.
