        "text": "Canon Group branches out of their customary explosive, nonsense action films into new frontiers. What those frontiers are? Who knows? Is it comedy? Is it drama? Is it film noir? Why not everything and anything at the same time.\n\nSo yeah, this was definitely something. All I knew this movie for was for that iconic scene and I had totally forgot it was from this movie. So yeah, I came into this completely blank, and I think that’s the best way to go. All I can say is that this is a fever dream, an atrocious cross between David Lynch and Coen Brothers with some, I dunno, Chinatown or something. Its convoluted to the point where I am still not…\n\nIn arguably the most miraculous event in Toronto history, this notorious Norman Mailer joint played on 35mm at the Royal, thanks to the Laserblast Film Society.\n\nThis is legendary for the widely-memed scene in which Ryan O’Neal says, “Oh god, oh man, oh god, oh man!”—but it’s so much more than that. It’s a feverish tongue-in-cheek mystery, with Mailer doing full-on self-parody. Feels like it began life as a free-associative writing exercise, or as excerpts from Mailer’s dream journal. Almost impossible to follow, and with wildly disparate acting styles (the cast includes Laurence Tierney, Isabella Rossellini, Penn Jillette, and some very, very hammy turns by Debra Sandlund and Wings Hauser - both of whom got Independent Spirit Award nominations).\n\nAlmost every…\n\nHaha! Holy shit!\n\nEntirely fucking watchable noir narrative delivery mechanism which ends up being so disrupted by its own ham-fisted overly affected self that it becomes really, really (like really) amazingly funny. And it's all probably intentional.\n\nI can’t tell if Mailer hates women more than he hates everyone else, or if he just harbors an utter and equal contempt for all of humanity... or, if its all just part of his smirky wallow in the genre and his twice-baked “masculinity on parade” themes.\n\nRegardless, the bleak and stark immoral universe that is the stock and trade of noir crime stories is so thickly spread here, and the characters so uniformly without any authentic human motivation, that it’s hard to…\n\nViewed with the Amazing Edith’s Collab Film Group.\n\nYou Yankees have tongues like Tallywhackers!\n\nYears ago after being utterly transfixed by David Lynch’s Blue Velvet, a fellow IMDb user had recommended me Tough Guys Don’t Dance because of their obvious similarities: a unique atmosphere, the underbelly of the burbs, noir features doused in sleazy melodrama, Isabella Rosellini, and a score composed by the magnanimous Angelo Badalmenti... needless to say the aforementioned checks off a bunch of boxes and the original recommendation is on point (but much less impressive). I’m glad to have finally gotten to this nearly 10 years after the fact!\n\nNorman Mailer’s film, based on his very own novel released just 3 years prior, is the kind of bizarre,…\n\n1st Norman Mailer\n\nNo, you are reading that right. I unironically believe that this is a remarkable film. But to appreciate it, you have to get beyond the potential camp appeal and try and understand it as a work by Norman Mailer. Mailer was a fascinating mass of contradictions by today's standards; an atrocious misogynist who was convicted of domestic assault; a man with some truly bizarre takes on race relations; a man whose ego frequently overwhelmed him and his writing. Yet he was a lifelong Democrat and anti-facist who was arrested for protesting the Vietnam War. Perhaps above all, he was the epitome of toxic masculinity.\n\nWhat I mean by this is the flip-side of that impulse to posture,…\n\nWhat in the overly melodramatic bullsheit is dis?\n\nOh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God oh man! Oh God oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh God, oh man! Oh man, oh God, God oh…\n\nNorman Mailer channels some Orson Welles masturbatory art project like an old man no longer in touch with the times and aged on too many whiskey sours cultivating the haphazard embarrassment of making a nonsensical callback to his heyday. Thankfully, he doesn't star in it himself to avoid any further harm. Is it intentional? Is it satirical? I'll write to Mailer from the grave and find out, but I imagine his response will be as esoteric as this movie's plot. While the endless quotable dialogue will leave you puzzled and bewildered like the furrowed brow of Tucker Carlson, there's not much more enjoyment to be had other than celebrating an exciting time with your slowly oozing mind.
