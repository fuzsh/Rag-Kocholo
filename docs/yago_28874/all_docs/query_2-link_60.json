During the NET program, he expresses opinions on many issues, such as\nAmerican involvement in the Vietnam war, and, particularly, on what is\nhappening to the American people.?A major part of the film was shot in\nWashington during the October 1967 peace march, during which Mailer was\narrested. (So was the soundman so that he could record what transpired with\nMailer in the police-wagon.) Mailer later wrote accounts of the march that\nwere published in Harper's and Commentary.

        "text": "components. Please, join the world It is explode. This film with Norman Mailer was made before, during and after the march on Washington on Saturday, October 21, 1967. Norman Mailer recently wrote this. We live, remember, in a time which interrupts the mood of everything alive. The mood is being squashed, smashed, sliced, exploded. Progressively, the most common condition of everyone is interruption and annoyance. Animals subjected to constant interruption go mad, but not humans, not yet.\n\nI can't do this. It's too funny. I'm going to die. Hello? Yes, we are. Yes, good. That's all. I can't do this. That's too funny. I'm going to die. Hello? Yes, we are. Yes, good. That's all. I love you too. I love you too.\n\nYou're loving the music. What is it? Sure. You're all your friends with me? Right. I love you too. What? Thank you, sir. Nice talking to you. Ciao, ciao, ciao. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. I hear this. No, here it is. You have any audience in these things? In there, I said you have people watching that song. That's one of the reasons we get to start reading. Yeah, that all we love about writing, is the Slip cracks. What makes someone spend a dog in school? Still people might not only have any qu Skinner or a mystery. It's the plates that ego introduces them to objects. Here we come again, a lack of identity and fixing the fetal. That's why I grow spiritual. I used a heart of men in society thatbeat families become more fleshy than me. But without shadow, without darkness, who can think? Think, who can feel, who can love? Perhaps this question of life is low on the list of huge violence Standby, please.\n\nWhy do you take him for granted for a long time and endured without examination of protest because suddenly become part of the anti-human tyranny of the artificial environment in which more and more of us are helpless captives. Like those people working on 35 floors of a high glass tower, like prisoners can they sell? Good night, and don't forget to put out the light. Thank you, Mary Manis. Lights out, it would seem, has never been the motto of our next guest. Author of The Naked and the Dead, Farberry Shore, Deer Park, advertisements for myself and the presidential papers among others, Norman Mailer has now come out with a novel called Why are we in Vietnam? Mr. Mailer, born 44 years ago in Long Branch, New Jersey, Harvard graduate and a veteran of the Pacific War, is interviewed by James Tobac, also a Harvard graduate, a writer, and author of Norman Mailer Today in the October issue of Commentary Magazine. Norman, in the past, you have written with prophetic urgency in most of your work,\n\nbut you knew now of a while we in Vietnam seems to be comic and tone. You seem to have moved from Farrell and Dreiser and even the prophet Jeremiah to late-choice middle boroughs and early-jockers. What was behind this change? Oh, that's one of those of exam questions, Jim. It's too hard for the tough to answer, you guys. I thought it feels if I'm taking... Leonardo was bulk of my body and getting it under the enormous bulk of my brain, pushing it uphill, and I don't know. I asked for that question. I feel exactly like a Harvard man in the, you bring me back 25 years of my main reminisce. I feel exactly like a Harvard man going in to take a highly examined, terribly hungover, and fall over that curious sense of sin that you get at Harvard for picadels, which are very small. I can't begin to say why the book is different for the phallobooks, because it's the one thing that's always just so dangerous to it, just don't do it.\n\nIt's starting... you could study everything closely, including yourself, but you try not to study the way what you work. Why are we in Vietnam? I mean, the question looms in the reader's mind from the beginning, because it is the title. Even though Vietnam is not a physical presence in the novel, even though it's only mentioned on the last page. But are we in Vietnam? Because America's finally gone insane and succumbed to the cancerous plague. You talked about in the past? No, I don't think America's going insane. I think America has become a psychopath, if you will. It's great difference. Because psychopaths aren't the least bit insane. In fact, they have an extraordinary tactical sense. You know, a psychopath is a man who has a more of a sense of the present. I think 100 Americans that didn't get cancerous, that didn't go psychotic, just became a psychopath, which is that how to have immediate satisfaction of its needs all the time. And Vietnam also isn't immediate satisfaction of our needs. Right. I know you've always been interested in the past and the role of the hero in American life, and I take it from what you've written and certainly everything you've said here that LBJ is not a potential hero.\n\nDo you see any around? Well, a political hero. Almost by definition, it has to be a man who's ideas for within the political centrality of the time, whatever that is. In other words, you can't conceive of an American being a political hero who is a communist or a fascist. You can conceive of them being martyrs. You can conceive of them being very brave men who were willing to die or suffer for their ideals. But what characterizes the hero, at least as I use the word, is that they not only are strong men and brave men and all of that, but they also embody some spirit of the time. They personify it. They give a face to it. A man's can be a hero only for a very short time, unless he really isn't the center of that history that's moving on and on and on. In other words, unless he stays in the center of that history, the way passes them by, and then he may be admired or maybe despised or whatever. But there is something extraordinary, perishable about the actor being a hero. Being a hero is an existential state. It can vanish in a season.\n\nNo one really have a few seconds left, but are there any, you, Hemingway, is the one writer you pointed to as a hero? Is there excluding yourself? Is there any writer around today that you think could achieve how it wasn't a kind of stature Hemingway did? Well, I wouldn't even include myself. I don't think there's anyone around right now. But of course, that could be overturned in a year or two. I keep waiting for some marvelous kit to come along. No. That's about time. Okay, thank you very much, Norman. It's going to pleasure. Okay. My cousin, Brucey, kids, I'm just surprised. Surprise party. I hope you had a good time. Let's just take some time off of news. My cousin, Brucey, returns. Now, more of the greatest son I've told for you and you. It's going to be a lot of fun. We've got several hours spending it during tonight at 10 o'clock, 10 of the greatest goldies, 10, 25 tonight on the big break. The uncharted bus of Bayo, New Jersey. Hey, thanks. I hear this. No, here it is. This is Norman Miller, making a film. Seen his police precinct.\n\nHe's playing the eternity detectives, 24 frames a second, 60 seconds. Jim, who's there with me? We're going to move on. Thanks. Maybe an item now. No, I'm going to do the interrogation. Hello. Let me tell you what, I'm going to do the facts. I want to do it my way right for a role. Well, stay at it as long as you can. Help me out as long as you can. Turn it around so it doesn't have a drink. Then if you've got the stomach, come up again. If you decide, of course, take it off. But help me, why are you working? I don't have an item that you all know. I can't work on the handle out there. We have an item that would be yet, I hear. Not yet. I'm just the assistant attorney who's thinking out of who's got an indictment, right? Yeah. And you're going to move on to the grand area. You're worried about the method for you. There's no brand story to this. The story's going to better kind of what we're doing. Whatever's going on to see, no matter how long you think a scene is, don't say you run out of dialogue. Don't say you're told to that. Don't say this about it. Just trying to figure out a way to change a scene. We're really going on with that. You're pretty good. What is that good for you is to listen. Hey, hey, hey, hey. And listen to come over and kiss me or hit me,\n\nor do something, but don't turn on that kind of thing. But listen to the lines that are rubbing it or listen to the people that are trying to talk to you. Come in and let us be a question stands in front of this thing. Now, you get done. I'll say, thank you, move over. So move to the outside, and then whoever is next to you, fill in. Now, if two of you are standing next to me, I need you to lose which one to move in. That's all right. Do it the way you do it on the subway. You're in something that you're doing once. You're not comfortable with a line of you. You don't need to know it's all about. Oh, get that. Do anything you want to do to make it move where you want to move. But don't say, don't say you'll run on a dial. I don't criticize the scene such a way that you can't use the scene. Don't understand. What does that play over? I don't even know what it's all about. All right, I'm sorry. Don't let us. OK, all right, all right, all right, all right. We said, we've reached a lot of time talking to these people because nothing ever takes place with them. I think this is a rule of whom. Hi, Stephanie.\n\nCome on, move over. You're going to have to move all the way on. Yeah, stop it. You're going to have to move all the way on. Yeah, stop it. You're going to have to move all the way on. Stop it. You're going to have to move all the way on. What is it, too? That was right. All right, all right, all right, all right. Yes, sir. Mm. Then you can't stop it, sir. Take it inside, part of it. All right, I laid a gentleman in the picture. Stand up right over there. I'm talking to you. Can you see me? Yes, over there. Now, tell me, friend, what is your name? Say God, my name is Sir Mario Rodriguez. Mario, Mario. Mario, that's right, play it. How long did he marry? You said no, what's the problem? I guess. You were born. You had to move all the way on. You didn't have to say anything to his ugly. Yeah, oh, no, no, no, no.\n\nPrisoner's reality. We are the prettiest prisoners in the city. Now, follow you in the uniform. These prisoners destroy their rights. So let me tell you, you were used to back into your clock journey. But the front end is not to be employed. Yeah, I'm a little scared. I remember, always keep your hands open for prisoners. Stop by. All right, we're all there, exactly. Now, you and the brothers fight. Now, I know that, please. All right, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, thank you very much. Now, I'll put some friends. I really would like to know. What are you going to hear, Paul? I don't know. You don't know open, I don't know. What did you want to say, Paul? He said he was guilty. He said he was guilty. When he killed him, then the end was brought me in, you know. Yeah. Now, I'll tell you, we got you in here, Paul. We got your hands on the very trailer. Great. And should you get that knife, all right? Oh, no. You recognize this?\n\nI've never seen them before. But I got out of your coat. I'll do that right now, you're lying. You're ready. You're very greedy. Why don't people like you have good for rape? Well, I'll do it. Ready. Well, we need to be buried. Next fellow, you can set up. I found him on the street. Both. Found that kind of lowest kind of. You're a Jew, aren't you? I'll straighten. That's right. Would you do an major old kid? I could never look at you, get something like that. I've been arrested because I was a subway, and I want to take a piece. Hey, I'm a geeky, you're a lion, which leads to this place. I don't care how you call me outside, but I'm going to have to speak and you're a lion. And I hope you will end with me 20. This is pretty funny, but I'm pretty good. I think I see the likes that now is the Puerto Rican. And the Puerto Rican is going to come on. Let's find the man who is in the car with the Puerto Rican. Find the man who is in the car with the Puerto Rican. You're a work-off.\n\nSo listen. You are a boss. Listen, this young boy is going to be here. Who is there? I don't know about him. You're a lot of fun. What's on the funny, huh? Hey, I'm a boss. But it's time to get the tomato right hand. He can't send him a Jewish mile on east side of the Puerto region. They got on east at the low off east side. He's a low at Jewish east side for a Rican number thing. That's not a point. It's all right. It looks like hundreds of Jewish nays side. That's not the point. It's not the point. It's not the point. It's not the point. It's not the point. It's not the point. The Jewish together. It's not the truth. The Jews like I made. You're a good one. Good job, everybody. Did the Aduce Room call in yet? It's really a little nervous about these buildings. That's quite a bit of things happening there. I wish you got the news, very sure. We'll cut it in right now when the news comes that we cut right into the drill job. Whatever's happening, stop that right at sea orders tonight. Seems to be quite a best down in Washington. Let me have that guy when you talk to this stuff. You ain't got to be.\n\nI hear this. No, I hear this. It's all camera now, then it's time. See, even the dogs don't know. Please, false. Do you know what I don't like to face false? I have one idea. You tell me. I do. They know that we have appropriated their idea at the home to see a true police officer as one notion of existence, which is there, something wrong with a firmament. And he smiles at me, bays. He bays like a home. You see, I haven't done anyone's eyes. I can know they are true or they are untrue. Now we tell you one thing, because I'm going to tell you that's very simple, sure. There's only one power, and all the police forces of the world, who's lieutenant of detectors. I'm not sure.\n\nOne will say it. General, they call me on the police force. They call me Lymee in their secret cuts. Lymee, they call me. Why? They can't forgive me from my education. They can't forgive me for the fact that I'm only power. Those lieutenant of detectors. You could spend 24 hours a day sitting right down there at that precinct. What do you understand about me? You're the first thing about my love for the police force. Do you? I think you understand. You'll aim out there late. I'm out there later, huh? And you don't begin to understand. You know, you were doing something that really. Let me tell you what you're doing is questioning and putting them in. Do something about the source. Consider the source. Don't talk to me again. Why are they that way? Tell me about the use. Why are they that way? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\n\nWhoa! Whoa! Whoa! Time time right now. It's 15 minutes after 9 o'clock. If I go cold, everybody. Cuz I'm busy. Natural with a wreath of Franklin gas. Sound number 14 in New York. Whoa! Whoa! W-A-B-C! Music for us. Sound! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Everything right. Come on, come on, come on. Yeah. I can segue off for this again. To us, two ladies and gentlemen, an air of uncertainty, the city braces for a round one, run one of a two-day mass protests against the war in Vietnam. Bus loads of demonstrators began arriving in the nation's capital yesterday. One protest leader predicts some 100,000 people will participate in Saturday's vigil at the Lincoln Memorial and subsequent march to the Pentagon. The government has laid down strict round rules for this protest, and some 10,000 paratroopers and national guardsmen are ready to enforce the code. Federal officials have served notice that violence and disorder will be dealt with harshly. We'll continue with some more news from Washington as it arrives.\n\nRight now, let's get back to some of our sounds. You're on 7-7 video. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is not going to ground it. I can't believe it. I wouldn't believe it. I didn't know what I believe this. Then I would like to have Allan securities last Friday. It is called strategist. That's perhaps if you have s Our import. It's so peaceful today, but this organization is going to be an extraordinary day, and it's going to be one group and it's a long, large, I'm standing around a week and some\n\ngold speeches. And then for the other people, they had to be in it, the other end of the line. And it might be just a big split up all day long, keep everybody pregnant. Richard Nixon is going by. Still there. Those cars happen. If any one of these young men is now arrested for violating a law which violates his conscience, then we too must be arrested for on the side of that law we are now as guilty\n\nas each one of them. It is a long standing tradition sanctioned by American democracy that the big states of the government must be tested on the anvil of individual conscience. This is what we now undertake to do, not as the first, but as the last resort. The law in the village of Doying is calling the college while people collect and state their names where they are from, the turning and draft cards. Let me have a for the turkey resistance, follow out to resistance, San Jose resistance, San Francisco, Davis, California, Sacramento, Santa Barbara, 298 cards. This is not for resistance, 181 cards. I burn my honorable discharge from the army, down span of Buffalo resistance, I got my card, so I added to New York 182, they get 183.\n\nWe had no place else to go, and we had to get out of here. I have had a long afternoon standing there in that sun and thinking, can you hear me out there? I am thinking gloomy thought because what occurred to me is towing on, let me start with the princes a little back of that, which I came to this with greatness gillings, because on one hand I am not a pacifist, I believe in many kinds of wars, and it seemed to me that I could not know a conscience necessarily ask young men to give up their draft cards, and I didn't know my own heart, whether if I were their age I would give up mine. I came to this with the deepest reluctance, uncertain, not knowing my own mind on this particular\n\nmatter. I am still not certain that I, in my, if I were their age, would give up a draft card, but I have come to recognize one thing standing out there in that crowd this afternoon, which is that war in Vietnam goes on for another year or two or three, then just about every last one of us who wishes to think of himself as a matter of good conscience is for one cause or another, which is related to that war, going to discover that he is going to have to face the fact that he will probably have to go to jail. I think for the first time, since that war began, I realized it's afternoon, if I wanted to continue to think of myself as a serious man, I will sooner or later have to face that possibility too. I mean, because it was the opening place, we had a lot of conversions to the next step, and I expect some news from Washington, but I think it's going on to watch it right now. I think it's going to get it kind of out there.\n\nMan is down there, and I said he's having a little problems. Yeah, right. I won't worry about that if you will, but stand by. But this is Washington and his number of all 11 of the address, several speakers at the Ambassador Theater, Tom Rolled, too. I said that I would beat the boom out of him, because he became the one who was the one who trained me. Now, I hate you, you hate me, too, you electronics, I'm going to get me the trash out of here. It's all over again, who we booed in today, let's give our electronic having bruise our flesh.\n\nNow, that gentleman is the invitation of Black Power. I expect, oh, I volunteered to beat Master Ceremony tonight, because I've never done it before, and on Saturday, we're going to go in there and do something that I was ever done before. Come on, kids, I'm going to warm you up, I'm going to warm you up, I'm going to warm you up. Yeah, you fell in. Right, now, the reason I have no respect for that man in the White House is they talk just like me. When he's drinking his bourbon, hey, if I spend all your kids forever, just think I'd\n\nlike to face you, laugh at him, I said. He's supposed to know this thing. We can't talk after this, you're talking about that. You want to make the moon do that. Hey, yeah, let's have a vote, let's have a vote, the guests will fall behind me and decided that what I'm doing is not to be a teacher, and they want to have me to move. So, let's have a vote, either I continue as you can, or I do, if you want to have me\n\nto move, those who would like to keep me, you must vote no. I think the eyes have it. Didn't have to get to this point, I guess that's the sort of get on. All right, now, I just give you a political lesson in the absence of a definitive vote for a man who holds a power key to it. Now, I'm not fine, but faint-hearted friends over there were afraid that I would go on at such length, that they would not be able to follow me. The reason for that is that they share with you the profound modesty of the left. They are better than they think.\n\nWhy I presume to introduce them on so big and high a level, it's because I know they have faint hearts grind over great gears. Our next guest is a man who, many, speak out as grace potent in America, by a better introduction for him. Which is he was in him to an invitation from the White House for an image, tea, and ceremony, but the present and the first lady is going to be taken. There's nothing more difficult for an artist to refuse. So fellow could not find it in his heart to refuse. And I couldn't find my heart to blame them all together. But rather low, who's a poet, and let me enforce upon you one notion, poets come rarely\n\nfrom the middle class, they come, they come from the top and the bottom. Now at least this is not low, who, if I were to fulfill this, intrudes. Empty fashion would have to be announced, it's coming from the top. This is very zany evening. We're all very different styles, different points, and different, and it's a queer occasion. You see, the too many red lights in front of you, and too much preparation.\n\nIt's glaringly formal and sort of disturbingly informal. And what's it mean? Who the hell are we talking to? Now with the reporters in the house, please stand up. Because if you don't stand up, no one will believe you are here tomorrow when you write your city reports. Yeah! Oh, oh, I would automatically watch them first, watch them start on a year. Now, close there here. Sculcan, Sculcan, where are you? Listen, you go, you report, you little pen ticklers. Work it up, that flame and assassination can be it now. Burning, innocent, goops.\n\nI didn't think like that. I didn't say I was Lynn Johnson's dwarf or ego or nothing. All right, one last point. There's a round row of booze for those reporters who are not stand up against our protest, against that fiendish, obscene, stupid, bullying war can be it now. Help me with me, move them, turn around, some of you, and give it a face in the other direction. All right, don't. You're not slavers. Thank you. Good night. Time magazine wrote this. Washington's scruffy ambassador theater was the scene of an unscheduled\n\nscatological solo in support of the peace demonstration. Its anti-star was also Norman Mailer who proved even less prepared to explain why are we in Vietnam and his current novel bearing out title. Slurping liquor from a coffee mug, mumbling and spewing obscenities, he staggered about the stage which he had commandeered by threatening to beat up the previous MC. I don't want to grandstand unduly, he said, grandly, but barely standing. It was one of his few coherent sentences. Here is the solution. There is only the same match, the feeling issue. God is such a schmupply director, bright blue skies, clear. There is a peace demonstration, a peace demonstration, a peace demonstration of just the more I see it now.\n\nDo you imagine being a little way for 30 years of the slaves? Really, I get a lot of reading. No, that's the myth. If you think they're a vast library, you know, joint gigantic library. If you let into the traditions. No, you know, I started with two circles. If you're a federal pen, you're all right. The federal pen will have to hear you any book you ask for. That's by law. There are a few guys. There are just a great time of insisting on particularly occult and arcane volumes. I didn't have to get it from the library and watch it.\n\nI'm coming up as the one with the law banner. Stop at the moment. You've got to move, you've got to get over to the side of the board. You've got to get over to the board. You've got to get over to the board. You've got to get over to the board.

Thank you.\n\ncomponents. Please, join the world It is explode. This film with Norman Mailer was made before, during and after the march on Washington on Saturday, October 21, 1967. Norman Mailer recently wrote this. We live, remember, in a time which interrupts the mood of everything alive. The mood is being squashed, smashed, sliced, exploded. Progressively, the most common condition of everyone is interruption and annoyance. Animals subjected to constant interruption go mad, but not humans, not yet.\n\nI can't do this. It's too funny. I'm going to die. Hello? Yes, we are. Yes, good. That's all. I can't do this. That's too funny. I'm going to die. Hello? Yes, we are. Yes, good. That's all. I love you too. I love you too.\n\nYou're loving the music. What is it? Sure. You're all your friends with me? Right. I love you too. What? Thank you, sir. Nice talking to you. Ciao, ciao, ciao. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. I hear this. No, here it is. You have any audience in these things? In there, I said you have people watching that song. That's one of the reasons we get to start reading. Yeah, that all we love about writing, is the Slip cracks. What makes someone spend a dog in school? Still people might not only have any qu Skinner or a mystery. It's the plates that ego introduces them to objects. Here we come again, a lack of identity and fixing the fetal. That's why I grow spiritual. I used a heart of men in society thatbeat families become more fleshy than me. But without shadow, without darkness, who can think? Think, who can feel, who can love? Perhaps this question of life is low on the list of huge violence Standby, please.\n\nWhy do you take him for granted for a long time and endured without examination of protest because suddenly become part of the anti-human tyranny of the artificial environment in which more and more of us are helpless captives. Like those people working on 35 floors of a high glass tower, like prisoners can they sell? Good night, and don't forget to put out the light. Thank you, Mary Manis. Lights out, it would seem, has never been the motto of our next guest. Author of The Naked and the Dead, Farberry Shore, Deer Park, advertisements for myself and the presidential papers among others, Norman Mailer has now come out with a novel called Why are we in Vietnam? Mr. Mailer, born 44 years ago in Long Branch, New Jersey, Harvard graduate and a veteran of the Pacific War, is interviewed by James Tobac, also a Harvard graduate, a writer, and author of Norman Mailer Today in the October issue of Commentary Magazine. Norman, in the past, you have written with prophetic urgency in most of your work,\n\nbut you knew now of a while we in Vietnam seems to be comic and tone. You seem to have moved from Farrell and Dreiser and even the prophet Jeremiah to late-choice middle boroughs and early-jockers. What was behind this change? Oh, that's one of those of exam questions, Jim. It's too hard for the tough to answer, you guys. I thought it feels if I'm taking... Leonardo was bulk of my body and getting it under the enormous bulk of my brain, pushing it uphill, and I don't know. I asked for that question. I feel exactly like a Harvard man in the, you bring me back 25 years of my main reminisce. I feel exactly like a Harvard man going in to take a highly examined, terribly hungover, and fall over that curious sense of sin that you get at Harvard for picadels, which are very small. I can't begin to say why the book is different for the phallobooks, because it's the one thing that's always just so dangerous to it, just don't do it.\n\nIt's starting... you could study everything closely, including yourself, but you try not to study the way what you work. Why are we in Vietnam? I mean, the question looms in the reader's mind from the beginning, because it is the title. Even though Vietnam is not a physical presence in the novel, even though it's only mentioned on the last page. But are we in Vietnam? Because America's finally gone insane and succumbed to the cancerous plague. You talked about in the past? No, I don't think America's going insane. I think America has become a psychopath, if you will. It's great difference. Because psychopaths aren't the least bit insane. In fact, they have an extraordinary tactical sense. You know, a psychopath is a man who has a more of a sense of the present. I think 100 Americans that didn't get cancerous, that didn't go psychotic, just became a psychopath, which is that how to have immediate satisfaction of its needs all the time. And Vietnam also isn't immediate satisfaction of our needs. Right. I know you've always been interested in the past and the role of the hero in American life, and I take it from what you've written and certainly everything you've said here that LBJ is not a potential hero.\n\nDo you see any around? Well, a political hero. Almost by definition, it has to be a man who's ideas for within the political centrality of the time, whatever that is. In other words, you can't conceive of an American being a political hero who is a communist or a fascist. You can conceive of them being martyrs. You can conceive of them being very brave men who were willing to die or suffer for their ideals. But what characterizes the hero, at least as I use the word, is that they not only are strong men and brave men and all of that, but they also embody some spirit of the time. They personify it. They give a face to it. A man's can be a hero only for a very short time, unless he really isn't the center of that history that's moving on and on and on. In other words, unless he stays in the center of that history, the way passes them by, and then he may be admired or maybe despised or whatever. But there is something extraordinary, perishable about the actor being a hero. Being a hero is an existential state. It can vanish in a season.\n\nNo one really have a few seconds left, but are there any, you, Hemingway, is the one writer you pointed to as a hero? Is there excluding yourself? Is there any writer around today that you think could achieve how it wasn't a kind of stature Hemingway did? Well, I wouldn't even include myself. I don't think there's anyone around right now. But of course, that could be overturned in a year or two. I keep waiting for some marvelous kit to come along. No. That's about time. Okay, thank you very much, Norman. It's going to pleasure. Okay. My cousin, Brucey, kids, I'm just surprised. Surprise party. I hope you had a good time. Let's just take some time off of news. My cousin, Brucey, returns. Now, more of the greatest son I've told for you and you. It's going to be a lot of fun. We've got several hours spending it during tonight at 10 o'clock, 10 of the greatest goldies, 10, 25 tonight on the big break. The uncharted bus of Bayo, New Jersey. Hey, thanks. I hear this. No, here it is. This is Norman Miller, making a film. Seen his police precinct.\n\nHe's playing the eternity detectives, 24 frames a second, 60 seconds. Jim, who's there with me? We're going to move on. Thanks. Maybe an item now. No, I'm going to do the interrogation. Hello. Let me tell you what, I'm going to do the facts. I want to do it my way right for a role. Well, stay at it as long as you can. Help me out as long as you can. Turn it around so it doesn't have a drink. Then if you've got the stomach, come up again. If you decide, of course, take it off. But help me, why are you working? I don't have an item that you all know. I can't work on the handle out there. We have an item that would be yet, I hear. Not yet. I'm just the assistant attorney who's thinking out of who's got an indictment, right? Yeah. And you're going to move on to the grand area. You're worried about the method for you. There's no brand story to this. The story's going to better kind of what we're doing. Whatever's going on to see, no matter how long you think a scene is, don't say you run out of dialogue. Don't say you're told to that. Don't say this about it. Just trying to figure out a way to change a scene. We're really going on with that. You're pretty good. What is that good for you is to listen. Hey, hey, hey, hey. And listen to come over and kiss me or hit me,\n\nor do something, but don't turn on that kind of thing. But listen to the lines that are rubbing it or listen to the people that are trying to talk to you. Come in and let us be a question stands in front of this thing. Now, you get done. I'll say, thank you, move over. So move to the outside, and then whoever is next to you, fill in. Now, if two of you are standing next to me, I need you to lose which one to move in. That's all right. Do it the way you do it on the subway. You're in something that you're doing once. You're not comfortable with a line of you. You don't need to know it's all about. Oh, get that. Do anything you want to do to make it move where you want to move. But don't say, don't say you'll run on a dial. I don't criticize the scene such a way that you can't use the scene. Don't understand. What does that play over? I don't even know what it's all about. All right, I'm sorry. Don't let us. OK, all right, all right, all right, all right. We said, we've reached a lot of time talking to these people because nothing ever takes place with them. I think this is a rule of whom. Hi, Stephanie.\n\nCome on, move over. You're going to have to move all the way on. Yeah, stop it. You're going to have to move all the way on. Yeah, stop it. You're going to have to move all the way on. Stop it. You're going to have to move all the way on. What is it, too? That was right. All right, all right, all right, all right. Yes, sir. Mm. Then you can't stop it, sir. Take it inside, part of it. All right, I laid a gentleman in the picture. Stand up right over there. I'm talking to you. Can you see me? Yes, over there. Now, tell me, friend, what is your name? Say God, my name is Sir Mario Rodriguez. Mario, Mario. Mario, that's right, play it. How long did he marry? You said no, what's the problem? I guess. You were born. You had to move all the way on. You didn't have to say anything to his ugly. Yeah, oh, no, no, no, no.\n\nPrisoner's reality. We are the prettiest prisoners in the city. Now, follow you in the uniform. These prisoners destroy their rights. So let me tell you, you were used to back into your clock journey. But the front end is not to be employed. Yeah, I'm a little scared. I remember, always keep your hands open for prisoners. Stop by. All right, we're all there, exactly. Now, you and the brothers fight. Now, I know that, please. All right, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, thank you very much. Now, I'll put some friends. I really would like to know. What are you going to hear, Paul? I don't know. You don't know open, I don't know. What did you want to say, Paul? He said he was guilty. He said he was guilty. When he killed him, then the end was brought me in, you know. Yeah. Now, I'll tell you, we got you in here, Paul. We got your hands on the very trailer. Great. And should you get that knife, all right? Oh, no. You recognize this?\n\nI've never seen them before. But I got out of your coat. I'll do that right now, you're lying. You're ready. You're very greedy. Why don't people like you have good for rape? Well, I'll do it. Ready. Well, we need to be buried. Next fellow, you can set up. I found him on the street. Both. Found that kind of lowest kind of. You're a Jew, aren't you? I'll straighten. That's right. Would you do an major old kid? I could never look at you, get something like that. I've been arrested because I was a subway, and I want to take a piece. Hey, I'm a geeky, you're a lion, which leads to this place. I don't care how you call me outside, but I'm going to have to speak and you're a lion. And I hope you will end with me 20. This is pretty funny, but I'm pretty good. I think I see the likes that now is the Puerto Rican. And the Puerto Rican is going to come on. Let's find the man who is in the car with the Puerto Rican. Find the man who is in the car with the Puerto Rican. You're a work-off.\n\nSo listen. You are a boss. Listen, this young boy is going to be here. Who is there? I don't know about him. You're a lot of fun. What's on the funny, huh? Hey, I'm a boss. But it's time to get the tomato right hand. He can't send him a Jewish mile on east side of the Puerto region. They got on east at the low off east side. He's a low at Jewish east side for a Rican number thing. That's not a point. It's all right. It looks like hundreds of Jewish nays side. That's not the point. It's not the point. It's not the point. It's not the point. It's not the point. It's not the point. The Jewish together. It's not the truth. The Jews like I made. You're a good one. Good job, everybody. Did the Aduce Room call in yet? It's really a little nervous about these buildings. That's quite a bit of things happening there. I wish you got the news, very sure. We'll cut it in right now when the news comes that we cut right into the drill job. Whatever's happening, stop that right at sea orders tonight. Seems to be quite a best down in Washington. Let me have that guy when you talk to this stuff. You ain't got to be.\n\nI hear this. No, I hear this. It's all camera now, then it's time. See, even the dogs don't know. Please, false. Do you know what I don't like to face false? I have one idea. You tell me. I do. They know that we have appropriated their idea at the home to see a true police officer as one notion of existence, which is there, something wrong with a firmament. And he smiles at me, bays. He bays like a home. You see, I haven't done anyone's eyes. I can know they are true or they are untrue. Now we tell you one thing, because I'm going to tell you that's very simple, sure. There's only one power, and all the police forces of the world, who's lieutenant of detectors. I'm not sure.\n\nOne will say it. General, they call me on the police force. They call me Lymee in their secret cuts. Lymee, they call me. Why? They can't forgive me from my education. They can't forgive me for the fact that I'm only power. Those lieutenant of detectors. You could spend 24 hours a day sitting right down there at that precinct. What do you understand about me? You're the first thing about my love for the police force. Do you? I think you understand. You'll aim out there late. I'm out there later, huh? And you don't begin to understand. You know, you were doing something that really. Let me tell you what you're doing is questioning and putting them in. Do something about the source. Consider the source. Don't talk to me again. Why are they that way? Tell me about the use. Why are they that way? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\n\nWhoa! Whoa! Whoa! Time time right now. It's 15 minutes after 9 o'clock. If I go cold, everybody. Cuz I'm busy. Natural with a wreath of Franklin gas. Sound number 14 in New York. Whoa! Whoa! W-A-B-C! Music for us. Sound! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Everything right. Come on, come on, come on. Yeah. I can segue off for this again. To us, two ladies and gentlemen, an air of uncertainty, the city braces for a round one, run one of a two-day mass protests against the war in Vietnam. Bus loads of demonstrators began arriving in the nation's capital yesterday. One protest leader predicts some 100,000 people will participate in Saturday's vigil at the Lincoln Memorial and subsequent march to the Pentagon. The government has laid down strict round rules for this protest, and some 10,000 paratroopers and national guardsmen are ready to enforce the code. Federal officials have served notice that violence and disorder will be dealt with harshly. We'll continue with some more news from Washington as it arrives.\n\nRight now, let's get back to some of our sounds. You're on 7-7 video. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is not going to ground it. I can't believe it. I wouldn't believe it. I didn't know what I believe this. Then I would like to have Allan securities last Friday. It is called strategist. That's perhaps if you have s Our import. It's so peaceful today, but this organization is going to be an extraordinary day, and it's going to be one group and it's a long, large, I'm standing around a week and some\n\ngold speeches. And then for the other people, they had to be in it, the other end of the line. And it might be just a big split up all day long, keep everybody pregnant. Richard Nixon is going by. Still there. Those cars happen. If any one of these young men is now arrested for violating a law which violates his conscience, then we too must be arrested for on the side of that law we are now as guilty\n\nas each one of them. It is a long standing tradition sanctioned by American democracy that the big states of the government must be tested on the anvil of individual conscience. This is what we now undertake to do, not as the first, but as the last resort. The law in the village of Doying is calling the college while people collect and state their names where they are from, the turning and draft cards. Let me have a for the turkey resistance, follow out to resistance, San Jose resistance, San Francisco, Davis, California, Sacramento, Santa Barbara, 298 cards. This is not for resistance, 181 cards. I burn my honorable discharge from the army, down span of Buffalo resistance, I got my card, so I added to New York 182, they get 183.\n\nWe had no place else to go, and we had to get out of here. I have had a long afternoon standing there in that sun and thinking, can you hear me out there? I am thinking gloomy thought because what occurred to me is towing on, let me start with the princes a little back of that, which I came to this with greatness gillings, because on one hand I am not a pacifist, I believe in many kinds of wars, and it seemed to me that I could not know a conscience necessarily ask young men to give up their draft cards, and I didn't know my own heart, whether if I were their age I would give up mine. I came to this with the deepest reluctance, uncertain, not knowing my own mind on this particular\n\nmatter. I am still not certain that I, in my, if I were their age, would give up a draft card, but I have come to recognize one thing standing out there in that crowd this afternoon, which is that war in Vietnam goes on for another year or two or three, then just about every last one of us who wishes to think of himself as a matter of good conscience is for one cause or another, which is related to that war, going to discover that he is going to have to face the fact that he will probably have to go to jail. I think for the first time, since that war began, I realized it's afternoon, if I wanted to continue to think of myself as a serious man, I will sooner or later have to face that possibility too. I mean, because it was the opening place, we had a lot of conversions to the next step, and I expect some news from Washington, but I think it's going on to watch it right now. I think it's going to get it kind of out there.\n\nMan is down there, and I said he's having a little problems. Yeah, right. I won't worry about that if you will, but stand by. But this is Washington and his number of all 11 of the address, several speakers at the Ambassador Theater, Tom Rolled, too. I said that I would beat the boom out of him, because he became the one who was the one who trained me. Now, I hate you, you hate me, too, you electronics, I'm going to get me the trash out of here. It's all over again, who we booed in today, let's give our electronic having bruise our flesh.\n\nNow, that gentleman is the invitation of Black Power. I expect, oh, I volunteered to beat Master Ceremony tonight, because I've never done it before, and on Saturday, we're going to go in there and do something that I was ever done before. Come on, kids, I'm going to warm you up, I'm going to warm you up, I'm going to warm you up. Yeah, you fell in. Right, now, the reason I have no respect for that man in the White House is they talk just like me. When he's drinking his bourbon, hey, if I spend all your kids forever, just think I'd\n\nlike to face you, laugh at him, I said. He's supposed to know this thing. We can't talk after this, you're talking about that. You want to make the moon do that. Hey, yeah, let's have a vote, let's have a vote, the guests will fall behind me and decided that what I'm doing is not to be a teacher, and they want to have me to move. So, let's have a vote, either I continue as you can, or I do, if you want to have me\n\nto move, those who would like to keep me, you must vote no. I think the eyes have it. Didn't have to get to this point, I guess that's the sort of get on. All right, now, I just give you a political lesson in the absence of a definitive vote for a man who holds a power key to it. Now, I'm not fine, but faint-hearted friends over there were afraid that I would go on at such length, that they would not be able to follow me. The reason for that is that they share with you the profound modesty of the left. They are better than they think.\n\nWhy I presume to introduce them on so big and high a level, it's because I know they have faint hearts grind over great gears. Our next guest is a man who, many, speak out as grace potent in America, by a better introduction for him. Which is he was in him to an invitation from the White House for an image, tea, and ceremony, but the present and the first lady is going to be taken. There's nothing more difficult for an artist to refuse. So fellow could not find it in his heart to refuse. And I couldn't find my heart to blame them all together. But rather low, who's a poet, and let me enforce upon you one notion, poets come rarely\n\nfrom the middle class, they come, they come from the top and the bottom. Now at least this is not low, who, if I were to fulfill this, intrudes. Empty fashion would have to be announced, it's coming from the top. This is very zany evening. We're all very different styles, different points, and different, and it's a queer occasion. You see, the too many red lights in front of you, and too much preparation.\n\nIt's glaringly formal and sort of disturbingly informal. And what's it mean? Who the hell are we talking to? Now with the reporters in the house, please stand up. Because if you don't stand up, no one will believe you are here tomorrow when you write your city reports. Yeah! Oh, oh, I would automatically watch them first, watch them start on a year. Now, close there here. Sculcan, Sculcan, where are you? Listen, you go, you report, you little pen ticklers. Work it up, that flame and assassination can be it now. Burning, innocent, goops.\n\nI didn't think like that. I didn't say I was Lynn Johnson's dwarf or ego or nothing. All right, one last point. There's a round row of booze for those reporters who are not stand up against our protest, against that fiendish, obscene, stupid, bullying war can be it now. Help me with me, move them, turn around, some of you, and give it a face in the other direction. All right, don't. You're not slavers. Thank you. Good night. Time magazine wrote this. Washington's scruffy ambassador theater was the scene of an unscheduled\n\nscatological solo in support of the peace demonstration. Its anti-star was also Norman Mailer who proved even less prepared to explain why are we in Vietnam and his current novel bearing out title. Slurping liquor from a coffee mug, mumbling and spewing obscenities, he staggered about the stage which he had commandeered by threatening to beat up the previous MC. I don't want to grandstand unduly, he said, grandly, but barely standing. It was one of his few coherent sentences. Here is the solution. There is only the same match, the feeling issue. God is such a schmupply director, bright blue skies, clear. There is a peace demonstration, a peace demonstration, a peace demonstration of just the more I see it now.\n\nDo you imagine being a little way for 30 years of the slaves? Really, I get a lot of reading. No, that's the myth. If you think they're a vast library, you know, joint gigantic library. If you let into the traditions. No, you know, I started with two circles. If you're a federal pen, you're all right. The federal pen will have to hear you any book you ask for. That's by law. There are a few guys. There are just a great time of insisting on particularly occult and arcane volumes. I didn't have to get it from the library and watch it.\n\nI'm coming up as the one with the law banner. Stop at the moment. You've got to move, you've got to get over to the side of the board. You've got to get over to the board. You've got to get over to the board. You've got to get over to the board.
