Slight wear to the spine ends; dust jacket price-clipped and toned along the edges. Very slight wear at the spine ends.\n\nMailer’s first novel, a masterful saga of the Second World War. Mailer wrote the novel while studying in Paris, and based much of it on his own experiences serving in the Pacific. The book was not only well reviewed but extremely popular – and spent over 60 weeks on the New York Times’ bestseller list. It would also mark the beginning of an illustrious career for one of America’s foremost authors. The Naked and the Dead appears on Modern Library’s list of the 100 best English language novels of the 20th century. “…it bears witness to a new and significant talent among American novelists.” (Contemporary New York Times review) Raoul Walsh directed the 1958 film of the same name starring Aldo Ray, Cliff Robertson and Raymond Massey. Near Fine in Near Fine dust jacket. (Item #5045)"
