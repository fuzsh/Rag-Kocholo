        "text": "We all have our secrets, and our favorite trashy movies are some of our more closely held ones. Campy, not-so-great films are a guilty pleasure for many of us.\n\n(Photo by New Line Productions)For the last several months we've been hearing about a possible guilty-pleasure contender: ''Snakes on a Plane,'' which reached cult status before it was even released, thanks to the power of the Internet. Back in the winter, a young law student started a blog, www.snakesonablog, just because he loved the name of the movie. Since then, one Web site after another has cropped up in honor of the film. Imagine if the Internet had been around when ''Valley of the Dolls'' came out!\n\nnow you're probably thinking about your own list of so-bad-they're-good movies, aren't you? We asked a few local movie aficionados to share their selections.\n\nBeloved stinkers\n\nCandace Hammond's\n\nTop 5 \"so bad they're good\" movies: img src=http://www.capecodonline.com/imagesullet2.gif \"Showgirls\": This 1995 movie is laughably bad - and therefore very entertaining. img src=http://www.capecodonline.com/imagesullet2.gif \"Catwoman\": For guys, Halle Berry in a leather cat suit is entertainment enough. For me, lines like, \"What a purrrfect idea!\" make this 2004 dud hilarious. img src=http://www.capecodonline.com/imagesullet2.gif \"Bring it On\": A 2000 flick with cheerleaders and such fantastic dialogue as \"She puts the whore in horrific!\" img src=http://www.capecodonline.com/imagesullet2.gif \"The Thrill of it All\": Doris Da James Garner in a 1963 comedy that is dated, and sexist, but I still watch any time I happen upon it. img src=http://www.capecodonline.com/imagesullet2.gif \"Mother May I Sleep With Danger?\": This trashy made-for-TV 1996 Tori Spelling movie is like the worst kind of junk food: You know it's terrible for you, but you can't resist.\n\nEric Hart, 56, who manages Cape Cinema in Dennis, had no trouble coming up with several titles.\n\n'''Tough Guys Don't Dance' (a 1987 film written and directed by Norman Mailer), is one of the worst,'' says Hart. ''Norman Mailer's influence is that every line has to be an important line, and they're so unimportant that it's laughable. The movie just doesn't work, the acting is atrocious, and Isabella Rossellini is so bad it's hilarious.''\n\nHart's second choice is probably on many people's list: ''Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'' (1991, starring\n\nKevin Costner).\n\n''Kevin Costner and his British accent came and went. It's hilarious. You're laughing at everything that isn't supposed to be funny,'' he says.\n\n''Eyes Wide Shut'' (1999), with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and directed by Stanley Kubrick, had spurred very high expectations, but didn't do well at the box office for many reasons - which is why it's also on Hart's list.\n\n''There was a total lack of chemistry between Kidman and Cruise,'' he says. ''Even though they were married, there was no sexual tension. It was totally boring, probably the most unsexy movie ever made. You can't believe it's that bad, so you keep watching to see if you're missing something, because Stanley Kubrick directed it.''\n\n''In 'Spaceballs' (1987), Mel Brooks had a lot of tired jokes. You laughed at things that aren't even funny. The special effects look stupid. It's a cult movie only because it's really bad.''\n\nNow showing img src=http://www.capecodonline.com/imagesullet2.gif What: \"Snakes on a Plane\" img src=http://www.capecodonline.com/imagesullet2.gif Starring: Samuel L. Jackson and Julianna Margulies img src=http://www.capecodonline.com/imagesullet2.gif Directed by: David R.

Long before blue screens and sophisticated special effects, we had films like these.\n\n''It's not just that the special effects are so bad, the acting is bad too,'' Hart says. ''In one early 'Godzilla' movie, Tonka is written on the bottom of a bus that gets tipped over. Very funny.''\n\nFilm director Daniel Adams, 44, of West Barnstable, isn't too proud to include himself on his own list.\n\n''There are so many, it's mind boggling, plus I have a hard time criticizing other directors because I know how hard it is, but I'll give it a stab,'' says the director of ''The Mouse.'' '''Heaven's Gate,' 'Reefer Madness,' 'Bedtime for Bonzo,' 'Caligula, and 'Primary Motive,' the last a film I directed. I can't bear to watch it!''\n\nChristopher Seufert, 38, a documentary filmmaker from Chatham, begins his list with a couple of historical films.\n\n'''Birth of a Nation.' I'm a documentary filmmaker, so my top so-bad-it's-good movie is D.W. Griffith's 1915 landmark film,'' he says. ''Its original title was 'The Clansman,' and it is so overtly racist by any standards - historical or otherwise - that it's clear that Griffith was attempting to re-write history, and it spurred a growth in the ranks of the Klan. Nevertheless, it's a complex film and historical artifact and, if nothing else, it's a riveting look into a deranged perspective that I don't think is, in any way, tongue in cheek.''\n\nNext on Seufert's list is ''Fred Ott's Sneeze.''\n\n''This is the first-ever film to be received by the U.S. Office on Jan. 9, 1894,'' he says. ''It was produced by Thomas Edison and shot by. K.L. Dickson. It features one of Edison's employees delivering one of his patented gag sneezes that he was so famous for among his contemporaries.''\n\n''Escape from New York'' is a more contemporary pick on Seufert's list.\n\n''This 1981 movie has Kurt Russell as the swaggering Snake Plissken in a maximum security prison,'' he says. ''Breaking out is impossible breaking in is insane, and it's all wrapped up in early '80s punk and new wave. Russell shines in every bad movie he's in. Check out 'Tango and Cash' for a double feature.''\n\nA bad Bond film? Seufert says, yes, there is one. '''AView to a Kill' may be 1986's worst film. Roger Moore is so old and limp as Bond, in his final appearance as Bond, that he makes Christopher Walken seem young and spry. Duran Duran, a so-bad-it's-good of the music world, does the title track.''\n\nLast, but not least, Seufert offers a Kevin Costner movie, ''The Postman'' (1997).\n\n''This is Kevin Costner's jingoistic, simple-minded and incomprehensible story of an actual postal worker saving humankind in a post-apocalyptic America,'' he says. ''Costner starred in and also directed this three-hour embarrassment. If you hated\n\n47 loved 'Waterworld,' multiply that times two. And keep an eye out for Tom Petty. There is actually a great sci-fi flick in here somewhere, but that director's cut is dependent upon a good director.''\n\nOf course, we could be wrong about ''Snakes on a Plane.'' Eric Hart attended a pre-release screening and said it's actually not terrible.\n\n''It's kind of too good to fall into that category. It's stupid, but it falls in the genre of being entertaining for the people who like that type of movie,'' he says. ''I wouldn't rush out to see it, but it's kind of sill fun.''\n\nAnd fun may be why, in the end, we love bad movies so much.\n\n''What makes a movie so bad it's good is when it's obvious a director has no clue how to direct, when the actors are miscast, the music is wrong, the pacing is off, and the camera work is too intrusive,'' Adams says. ''I find that highly amusing!''\n\nAnd so, apparently, do the rest of us.\n\n(Published: August 19, 2006)"
