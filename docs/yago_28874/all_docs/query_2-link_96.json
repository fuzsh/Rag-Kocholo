        "text": "Dowagiac lost a great friend in Norman Mailer\n\nPublished 7:25 pm Monday, November 12, 2007\n\nBy Staff\n\nNorman Mailer, a true friend to the Dowagiac Dogwood Fine Arts Festival, died about 4:30 a.m. Nov. 10 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. He was 84.\n\nI still have the phone number to call his waterside home in Provincetown, Mass., as I did on Tuesday afternoon, May 6, 1997, before his appearance at Central Middle School.\n\nProvincetown was the setting for the 1984 psychological thriller \"Tough Guys Don't Dance,\" which I read.\n\nIn 1987, he directed the film version starring Ryan O'Neal and Isabella Rossellini.\n\nI did not, however, read his 1983 novel \"Ancient Evenings,\" set in 11th and 12-century B.C. Egypt, on which he toiled 11 years exploring his obsession with time and reincarnation.\n\nHis third novel, 1955's \"The Deer Park,\" drew on his early experiences in Hollywood after \"The Naked and the Dead\" came out and was set in McCarthy-era TInseltown. The story focuses on a movie director blacklisted for not naming names who then changes his position.\n\nWriting it proved \"agonizing,\" Mailer recalled. \"I wrecked my health doing it.\"\n\n\"The Deer Park,\" in fact, caused him to take a respite from fiction with 1959's \"Advertisements for Myself,\" a collection of essays and commentary regarded as establishing the non-fiction narrative style that became his benchmark.\n\n\"I thought that was, oddly enough, the first book written in what became my style,\" Mailer agreed. \"I never felt as if I had a style until that book.\"\n\n\"Armies of the Night,\" which won both the Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, was inspired by attending a 1967 march on the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam war.\n\nIn the tumultuous year of 1968, Mailer chronicled both political conventions in \"Miami and the Siege of Chicago,\" which he sort of reprised in 1996 at the urging of George, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s short-lived journal on the convergence of politics and pop culture.\n\nCovering political conventions is \"hard work,\" he said. \"There's a lot of swimming through the handouts.\"\n\nCalling Mailer was as intimidating as phoning the White House given his propensity for public pugnacity, but it actually went much better than, say, my interview with Joyce Carol Oates, who had me confused with someone else.\n\nThe Dogwood became what it has in part because of post-World War II literary lions like Mailer, Kurt Vonnegut, John Updike and Joseph Heller.\n\nMailer, who offered to promote Dogwood and thus became the first member of its advisory board, used his wartime experiences to write \"The Naked and the Dead,\" published when he was just 25.\n\nHis most recent work, \"The Castle in the Forest,\" probes the life of Adolph Hitler as told by a demon.\n\nHe approached writing as a \"holdout for the No. 2 pencil,\" writing all that prose in longhand.\n\nAn assistant with a computer turned his words into copy he could edit with his trusty pencil.\n\nMailer, who wrote a 250-page story at age 9 and entered Harvard at 16 (his 1943 degree was in engineering, although he already knew he wanted to be a writer), otherwise had unremarkable origins.\n\nThe co-founder of the Village Voice and New York City mayoral candidate was born Jan. 31, 1923, in Long Branch, N.J., and grew up in Brooklyn.\n\nHis dad was an accountant. His mother helped run a trucking company. His was a \"typical middle-class Jewish family.\"\n\nMarried six times and the father of nine children, even his longtime nemesis Gore Vidal once acknowledged that Mailer was \"a man whose faults, though many, add to rather than subtract from the sum of his natural achievements.\"\n\nMailer won two Pulitzer Prizes, for \"Armies of the Night\" in 1968 and for the 1,000-page, \"true-life novel\" \"The Executioner's Song\" in 1979 about Gary Gilmore, which remains one of the most amazing books I ever read.\n\nI also enjoyed the exhaustive 1995 \"Oswald's Tale (An American Mystery),\" which goes all the way back through Marina's family tree in Russia for the story of John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey.\n\nWhat he said in Dowagiac Friday night, May 16, stays with me still: a deluded and overly self-righteous America could use a good \"moral housecleaning.\"\n\n\"What worries me most about America,\" Mailer said, \"and it's been true right since the second World War and that's our self-righteousness, our inability to face our sins … All countries have policy disasters sooner or later. How did we recover (from Vietnam)? We cheered when we conquered Grenada … What would we say if a person acted that way? … We extended the Cold War for 20 years beyond the time we needed to extend it … By the time Ronald Reagan came in (the Soviet Union) was a moribund Third World country, and everyone kept talking about the evil empire and deluding us and we were fools enough to accept it and to go along with it because it was comfortable and because it was economically agreeable. A lot of people were making a lot of money off the idea … But … when that Cold War ended … for 40 years we had an enemy – Soviet communism, godless materialism. Everybody in America started hating everybody else. We've had more discord and disarray in America since the Cold War ended than any time I can remember … It's not Bill Clinton's fault. He is the symbol of the kind of sloppiness that exists in this country where on the one hand, he's a great liberal and, on the other hand, he never saw a money tree he wouldn't climb. My feeling is that this country is capable of immense greatness, but we have to clean the … stables first … I'm still enough of a Marxist to remember that Marx once said that money leeches out every other value in human affairs. When money becomes pre-eminent, when it becomes the first value of people, nothing of value can really be sustained for too long a period.\"\n\nAnd let's not forget \"The Gospel According to the Son,\" which had just been released when he arrived for the fifth annual festival and slipped over to Berrien Springs to spar with Muhammad Ali.\n\nHis 30th book he dared tell entirely in the first-person voice of Jesus.\n\n\"I wanted to tell the story, and nobody can understand that,\" Mailer told me. \"If I was a movie director, nobody would be that startled. I also wanted to capture the power and intensity of the story itself. It's a very exciting story,\" for which he reread the New Testament for the first time in 40 years as he embarked on a two-year project to create an internal voice for a man meant to be divine as well as human.\n\n\"It may be the greatest story ever told,\" Mailer said. \"Sometimes it's told beautifully and others not at all. My aim as a novelist was to retell the story. The story's good enough, so stay close to it,\" although \"I do depart from it and expand on it in some places\" – particularly an extended dialogue with Satan and Christ's death on the cross.\n\n\"The Gospel According to the Son\" exposed Mailer to \"some of the worst reviews I've ever received.\"\n\nBut critics faulted him for being too faithful to traditional terrain rather than blasphemy at the thought of Mailer presumptuously getting inside Jesus's head.\n\n\"In a writer of Mr. Mailer's past daring and outrage, such a humility of imagination constitutes his Gospel's most disappointing aspect,\" wrote Reynolds Price in The New York Times.\n\nMailer said he coached himself, \"Don't get too pious and don't get too satirical. That's too easy. I wrote the first draft rather quickly, then started tuning. It was like tuning a harp to get the simple style I wanted that was not overly Biblical.\"\n\n\"What people can't understand,\" Mailer said, \"is that the more you work at something in your profession, you rely on instinct\" and his – \"no question\" – was that a first-person account was necessary to accomplish his narrative.\n\nHe had recently appeared on \"Politically Incorrect\" and enjoyed going one-on-one with host Bill Maher because the comedian \"is very quick. It was like a boxing match. \"\n\nExcitement tinged his voice.\n\nHe said whether he's writing about Marilyn Monroe, Picasso, boxing or the CIA (\"Harlot's Ghost,\" 1991, consumed seven years), \"The project tends to pick you\" by pricking the author's interest.\n\n\"The book sort of appears in your mind,\" he said. \"It's analogous to falling in love. It happens or it doesn't\" and it's hard to predict when that will occur.\n\n\"I don't write books out of calculation. They don't work out well,\" said the man who pioneered \"New Journalism\" along with Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese.\n\nHe once said journalism is \"irresponsible\" because it loses sight that \"you can't be too sure about what happened.\"\n\nMailer declined to address with the Daily News the question of which of his books most satisfied him except to say there would be \"no surprises\" compared to popular and critical acclaim.\n\nHe chuckled when it was suggested that asking him to name his favorite book would be like asking a Beatle to name his favorite song.\n\n\"I'm satisfied I've given it my best shot,\" he said. \"It's the way I make my living and I want my books to do well. Bad reviews hurt the sales.\"\n\njohn.eby@leaderpub.com"
