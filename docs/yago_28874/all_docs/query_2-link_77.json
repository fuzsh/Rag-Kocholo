        "text": "You’d think that between running for mayor of New York, covering presidential campaigns, or committing acts that would tarnish his literary legacy for generations to come, Norman Mailer would probably not be someone with an abundant amount of free time on his hands. And yet: apparently the man also tried his hand at filmmaking in the late 1960s, and next month, the Criterion Collection’s Eclipse imprint will release a double-disc set of his films. Which, if nothing else, should serve […]\n\nThe Monster Magnet/Norman Mailer connection you never expected: revealed by Tom Scharpling. Maura Johnston on music discovery and SXSW. The Last Repatriate author Mathew Salesses has a good essay on The Rumpus about racism and perceptions of race. Questlove is curating an impressive-looking festival at BAM next month. Nick Cave covering Jeffrey Lee Pierce? We’ll listen to that. Joe McCulloch on Moebius. (This link contains some possibly-work-unsafe images, for what it’s worth.) Follow Vol. 1 Brooklyn on Twitter, Facebook, Google + and our Tumblr.\n\nPrequels for Watchmen? Alan Moore calls it “shameless.” S.J. Perelman was born on this day in 1904. Director John Ford and Clark Gable also would be celebrating birthdays if they weren’t dead. Great fictional characters struggling with faith. Somehow we missed that yesterday was Norman Mailer’s birthday. PageViews did not make such an egregious error. “The Shining 2 By Jonathan Franzen by Stephen King” by Blake Butler at Vice. At McSweeney’s: “Your dreamcatcher is clogged again.” Follow Vol. 1 Brooklyn on Twitter, Facebook, Google […]\n\nPosted by Jason Diamond Keith Gessen getting name-dropped on Gossip Girl is cool, but with all due respect, it’s no Norman Mailer on the Gilmore Girls… Follow Vol. 1 Brooklyn on Twitter, Facebook, and our Tumblr.\n\nWe liked hearing Gay Talese talk about all the drinking and partying that used to go on at The New York Times, that this week’s literary trading card is dedicated to four of our favorite writers who probably spent as much time with their bartender as they did their editor. From left to right: Dorothy Parker, Mike Royko, Hunter S. Thompson, Norman Mailer. Want a copy? Buy it here. (All art by Margarita Korol)\n\nPosted by Jason Diamond We’re hoarders in my family. Not the crazy kind you see on that television show, but good ones who neatly stack piles of books, magazines and records to the ceilings and create fire hazards. I found a few choice things last time I was there. Mainly the above issue of People from around my third month on the Earth. I looked at it and thought, “you never see major magazines like this discussing authors anymore,” and […]\n\nPosted by Jason Diamond Norris Church Mailer died. I guess Norris will always be known as being married to genius/pig/total prick/genius, Norman Mailer. She will also be known for writing a book about being married to Norman — the one that tells you more than you ever wanted to know about their sex life. She is also the person who’s New York Times obituary ends with this: Before she met Mr. Mailer, she claimed, she had a fling with the […]\n\nAt Impose: The Norman Mailer/James Frey connection. At Vice: New York Tyrant says that Brandon Hobson writes “real-sad writing.” Find out for yourself. At Beatrice: Discussing The Instructions by Adam Levin. At NPR: Nora Ephron getting older is funnier than you at pretty much any point in your life. The Awl were inspired by Tina Brown, and will now merge with any magazine that will have them At The Guardian: French Maoists, The Rolling Stones, and Sartre all make appearances […]"
