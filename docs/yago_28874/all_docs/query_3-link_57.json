        "text": "Filmmaker Joseph Mantegna was elated Nov. 13 after his documentary film “Norman Mailer: The American” was shown at the 33rd Starz Film Festival.\n\nHis film on the larger-than-life Mailer, a giant in 20th-century American letters who died at age 84 three years ago, had drawn an enthusiastic response in Denver. Mantegna had also gotten word that the film was accepted for a special showing at the upcoming New York Film Festival, after winning best-documentary awards at film festivals in Boston, Santa Fe, N.M. and Orlando, Fla.\n\nMantegna, a 30-year veteran of advertising films, met Mailer at a 2006 barbecue in Provincetown, Mass., at the end of Cape Cod’s peninsula, while working on a film called “P-Town Diaries.” The documentary looks at Provincetown’s gay and lesbian culture in what has been called the gay mecca of the U.S. It was ironic, because Mailer, who lives part of the year in Provincetown, had long been called homophobic — a tag he repented late in life.\n\n“Go figure,” said Mantegna, who is gay. “But we hit it off and that became the basis for this film. Half the family loves it and half hates it,” he said of Mailer’s six wives and nine children.\n\nThe 95-minute film took only 18 months to produce and Mantegna, who had no financial backers, recalled “I didn’t sleep much. But I knew the effort was worth it when some in the Boston audience were in tears near the end of that screening,” he said. “Some people thought Mailer was a monster, but I came to love the guy.”\n\nMailer won two Pulitzer Prizes and left a legacy of more than 40 books, including 11 novels, beginning with his 1948 “Naked and the Dead” novel of World War II in the South Pacific. Whether viewers had read Mailer’s books that run from Marilyn Monroe to Adolf Hitler, Mantegna’s film shows different slices of a controversial figure. Mailer was both praised as a genius and loving family man and derided as an alcoholic/drug demon and compulsive womanizer who claimed hundreds of partners that included some me.\n\nAlong with often-acerbic comments from Mailer’s wives, we see him sparring with other authors on TV. Footage includes him taunting a Dick Cavett Show studio audience with “Is this entire audience composed of idiots — or is it just me?”\n\n“It’s YOU!” thunders the audience.\n\nAlways ahead of his time, Mailer — working as a journalist and novelist who skillfully mixed the two genres — not only wrote about major events, but was an active participant. Mantegna said he believed Mailer was a better writer of non-fiction than of creating characters in novelistic narratives. As a journalist, Mailer helped launch the Village Voice newspaper for Manhattan’s Greenwich Village neighborhood in 1955. The Voice became the model for alternative weeklies all over America.\n\nMailer took part in the anti-Vietnam war 1967 March on the Pentagon, which drew 50,000 protesters, led to his “Armies of the Night,” a milestone of what became known as the “New Journalism,” a highly subjective mode that probes the author’s mind and those of others with fiction techniques.\n\nOther writers, including Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Hunter Thompson and Gail Sheehy, were also practicing New Journalism in the ’60s and ’70s, but “Armies” won a Pulitzer in 1968. Months later, Mailer composed an equally unorthodox account of the 1968 Republican and Democratic Conventions, with “Miami and the Siege of Chicago.” As at the Pentagon march, he was arrested in Chicago.\n\nWith Hunter Thompson gone — by his own hand — in 2005, Mailer was called one of the “last angry men” of America letters in a Rolling Stone interview that ran shortly before Mailer’s death. With both gone, much of the needed anger once directed at American politics and society also vanished. Mailer cared about language and, in the Rolling Stone interview, said language from an American president ought to be stirring. Instead, he said, what we got from President George W. Bush was “dead-ass language” from a president Mailer called the most ignorant America ever suffered.\n\nIn Denver, Mantegna said “there was nobody like him in the second half of the 20th century, and I hope his books will be rediscovered by younger people. He won Pulitzers, but you don’t get a Nobel Prize if you’ve stabbed your wife.”\n\nA voice like Mailer’s could be used today. But in an age of blogs, Twitter-speak and “dead-ass language,” it’s Mantegna who is reminding us of what we used to have."
