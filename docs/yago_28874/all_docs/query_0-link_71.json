        "text": "New York: The Dial Press, 1965. First edition. From the collection of Adeline Lubell-Naiman. INSCRIBED, \"To Adeline - In return for a long letter / Norman / Feb 1965.\" Spine unevenly faded, otherwise about very good in worn but still presentable dust jacket. Adeline Lubell-Naiman was the editor instrumental in the eventual publication of THE NAKED AND THE DEAD. In 1946, while an editor at Little, Brown, Lubell-Naiman convinced Mailer to submit the first 200 pages of THE NAKED AND THE DEAD, which she talked up to her publisher. Unfortunately, she was also the one to suggest historian and critic Bernard DeVoto read the manuscript--he recommended not publishing. But Mailer submitted it to Rinehart, who published the book in 1948. Over the years, Lubell-Naiman remained close friends with Mailer and his wives. In the summer of 1968 she even played the role of \"Adeline McCarthy,\" a president of a women's college in Mailer's film \"Maidstone\" (Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center website).\n\nItem #49637"
