        "text": "Rip Torn, who died yesterday at 88, has a career filled with memorable performances. As Artie the producer on The Larry Sanders Show. As Agent Zed in Men in Black. As Patches O’Houlihan in Dodgeball. (And those are just from the second half of his career.) And they’re all marked by a combination of restraint and vigor that very few actors can pull off.\n\nBut there’s one Rip Torn performance that I remember above all the others: the time he tried to break Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Norman Mailer’s head with a hammer.\n\nIt was vigorous. Not so much restrained.\n\nThe clip is from the docudrama Maidstone, the third in a series of movies that Mailer wrote, directed, and produced in the late 60s. Mailer played a novelist-slash-presidential candidate and Torn played his brother Raoul. Mailer’s directing style involved provocation. He’d needle and harass his actors while keeping the camera going. This was, apparently, more than Torn could handle. As Mailer’s real-life wife and children look on, horrified and crying, Torn attacks Mailer, who then grabs Torn and bites off part of his ear. The cameras catch everything—the clip made it into the final cut of the film despite the actors using each other’s real names during the melee.\n\nThe late 60s and early 70s were a strange time for male artists, actors, and intellectuals born in the early part of the 20thcentury, at least judging from clips of them squaring off to swing their, uh, egos around. See Richard Pryor and Milton Berle on The Mike Douglas Show. See Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley on ABC during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. In the Maidstone clip, Torn and Mailer seemed to be both macho’d up in a Marlboro Man way but also overstimulated from the sexual revolution, and the result of that combination is the sort of pathetic intensity that can only occur when two middle-aged egos get bruised.\n\nThis clip holds a few different lessons: Never act in a film directed by a novelist. Never leave your ear unprotected. And never, ever pick up a hammer when you're pissed off."
