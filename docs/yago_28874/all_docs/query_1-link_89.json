Our accommodation team is more than happy to help you with this process, and you can find more information on our Private Accommodation page.\n\nAddress and directions\n\nThe Maidstone Studios\n\nVinters Park\n\nMaidstone\n\nKent\n\nME14 5NZ\n\nHow to find us\n\nYou'll find Maidstone Studios tucked away from the main road, use postcode ME14 5NZ on your sat nav.

Trains from London to Maidstone depart from London Victoria station and London Bridge station."
