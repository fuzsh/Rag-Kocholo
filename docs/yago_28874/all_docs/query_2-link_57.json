More about this book >\n\nTHE SCIENCES FINALIST National Book Awards 1972 >\n\nHere, by America's foremost candidate for the Nobel Prize, is the book that some fifteen years ago created a firestorm among true believers of the women's liberation movement, and which on rereading and contemplation emerges as one of the most sensible, sensitive and probing works on the ageless dialectic of man, woman, man-woman ever to be written. More about this book >\n\nCONTEMPORARY AFFAIRS FINALIST National Book Awards 1972 >\n\nNorman Kingsley Mailer was an American novelist, journalist, essayist, poet, playwright, screenwriter, and film director.\n\nMailer is considered an innovator of creative nonfiction, a genre sometimes called New Journalism, but which covers the essay to the nonfiction novel. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize twice and the National Book Award once. In 1955, Mailer, together with Ed Fancher and Dan Wolf, first published The Village Voice, which began as an arts- and politics-oriented weekly newspaper initially distributed in Greenwich Village. In 2005, he won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from The National Book Foundation."
