        "text": "VisAbility Productions is an independent Film and Television production company, which specialises in making both broadcast and corporate TV programmes. We pride ourselves on our professional and efficient methods which give our clients the best possible end product.\n\nDirector Derek Wheeler has over 20 years experience in Broadcast TV. The disciplines of broadcast television, delivering a programme from idea to screen - on time, to budget, with clarity, creativity and flair - are invaluable when applied to any project. We believe this is our greatest strength. We don’t try to baffle or impress you with industry jargon, we simply do an excellent job based on straight talking and a proper understanding of the subject matter and the technology involved. We are renowned for our friendly relaxed approach, immediately putting everyone at ease.\n\nThis work ethic continues throughout the company. Between them, all our staff - camera operators, sound technicians, editors etc. - have many years experience in broadcast TV. Anything they don’t know about their particular field could be written on the back of a postage stamp! Collectively they have worked on shows as diverse as Question Time, Antiques Roadshow, The Bill, Changing Rooms, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and Blind Date, to name but a few. They have a wealth of expertise to bring to all of our productions enabling us to deliver a top quality end product.\n\nVisAbility Productions offer you a complete service which will take care of your project from conception through to distribution. All you have to do is provide the idea. Together we will work with you through scripting / storyboarding / casting / shooting / editing to turn your concept into reality.\n\nVisAbility Productions has a long list of satisfied clients from the broadcast, commercial and corporate sectors. Our excellent reputation covers a wide variety of subjects - we have produced pop videos, commercials, multi-camera outside broadcasts, training programmes, product promotions, award ceremonies, conference openers and many more.\n\nFor example, we have recently been contracted by the Department for Education and Skills to produce a series of training videos for teachers nationwide on the Key Stage 3 National Strategy.\n\nIn complete contrast, the VisAbility team found themselves in the Alps filming promotional footage for the French Office du Tourisme.\n\nAt other times we have found ourselves getting airborne to film some breathtaking scenes from the sky – a particular speciality of the company!\n\nEvery project, whether large or small, is given the same care and attention.\n\n''We approached VisAbility Productions because we knew they could draw on broadcast TV experience and we felt this had been lacking in our previous videos.''\n\nCentre for Schools Standards\n\n''The band really enjoyed working with you, and this is reflected in their performance.''\n\nAcid Jazz Records\n\n''Your professional knowledge and equipment brought our product to life in a way we never thought possible.''\n\nN.I.S.A.\n\nDerek has directed many broadcast TV programmes, covering Current Affairs, Documentary, Sport and Light Entertainment. Here is a selection of his major credits."
