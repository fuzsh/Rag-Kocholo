        "text": "Maidstone Studios has played host to Wes Anderson’s new Netflix film, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar.\n\nThe 39 minute film, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Ralph Fiennes, Dev Patel, Ben Kingsley and Richard Ayoade, shot in the facility’s 12,000 sq. ft Studio 1, one of the largest independent, regional studio facilities in the UK, and Studio 2 (6,000 Sq ft).\n\nThe production also employed several outdoor sets constructed within the backlot at Maidstone, while production made use of many of the Studios’ ancillary spaces for hair, make up, props and catering.\n\nThe film is based on a story by Roald Dahl about a rich man who learns about a guru who can see without using his eyes and sets out to master the skill in order to cheat at gambling.\n\nChairman and owner of Maidstone Studios, Geoff Miles said: “We are enormously proud and delighted to have worked with Wes Anderson and Indian Paintbrush on their latest short film for Netflix. It was an absolute pleasure to work with such a talented team across the year and on such an iconic Roald Dahl story.”\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar debuts on Netflix on 27th September."
