Operation Snatch is a 1962 British spy-comedy film directed by Robert Day, starring Terry-Thomas, George Sanders, and Lionel Jeffries. The film is set in the fictional European country of Grimmburg, which is on the brink of a revolution. The British government has hired a group of experts to steal the crown jewels of the country before the revolutionaries can get their hands on them.

The story follows the bumbling team of thieves, who call themselves the S.W.A.G. (Specialized Wrecking and Grounds), as they attempt their daring heist. The team is led by the pompous Major Harry Maxim (Terry-Thomas), a man who takes himself very seriously but lacks the skills to back it up. His team consists of the suave and debonair Colonel J.R. Johnny Dalby (George Sanders), who is more interested in wooing women than stealing jewels, and the eccentric and brilliant Professor Charles Bastia (Lionel Jeffries), who creates a series of gadgets to aid the team.

As the team arrives in Grimmburg, they quickly discover that things are not as simple as they seem. The country is in chaos, with revolutionaries bombarding the palace where the crown jewels are stored. The team must navigate their way through the chaos, using their wits and their gadgets to gain entry to the palace and steal the jewels.

Along the way, they encounter a variety of eccentric characters, including the beautiful and mysterious Olga (Sylvia Syms), who seems to have her own agenda. The team must also contend with the bumbling police chief, Colonel Bresnavitch (Jules Munshin), who is determined to catch them in the act.

Despite their best efforts, the team encounters a series of setbacks and mishaps, which threaten to derail their mission. Major Maxim's arrogance and lack of skill prove to be a hindrance, while Colonel Dalby's womanizing gets in the way of the job. But it is Professor Bastia's gadgets that prove to be the saving grace of the team, allowing them to navigate through seemingly impossible situations.

The film's humor is a mix of physical comedy and witty dialogue, with Terry-Thomas delivering his usual comedic performance as the bumbling Major Maxim. The chemistry between the three leads, Terry-Thomas, George Sanders, and Lionel Jeffries, is delightful to watch, as each actor brings their own unique style to their characters.

One of the highlights of the film is the series of gadgets created by Professor Bastia. These include a cigarette lighter that doubles as a blowtorch, a ladder that can be disguised as a suitcase, and a diving suit that is used to sneak into the palace's moat. The gadgets add a sense of whimsy and playfulness to the film, reminding viewers that this is a comedy first and foremost.

Overall, Operation Snatch is a lighthearted spy-comedy that is still enjoyable to watch today. While it may not have the action or suspense of modern spy films, it is a fun and entertaining romp that showcases the talents of its lead actors. Fans of classic 1960s comedies will not be disappointed.
