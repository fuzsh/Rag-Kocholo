        "text": "Re-enter the world that brought you face huggers, chest bursters, and acidic blood with Alien Romulus. Directed by Fede Alvarez, best known for Don’t Breathe and Evil Dead.\n\nThe film follows orphaned Rain (Cailee Spaeny) and her adopted synthetic brother Andy (David Jonsson) who are seeking to leave the mining planet Yvaga ran by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. When she finds out that her contract is extended Rain tries to come up with a plan to escape this dark and dirty planet. That’s when a group of her friends led by Tyler (Archie Renaux) offers her the chance to travel to a decommissioned Weyland vessel that is floating above the mining planet to retrieve hyper sleep chambers. In this group are Tyler’s pregnant sister Kay (Isabela Merced), Bjorn (Spike Fearn), and Navarro (Aileen Wu). What they do not know about this station is that it was used to study the original Xenormorph from the first Alien (1979) film - after Ripley blew up the Nostromo and sent the alien out of the air lock. What they thought was going to be a simple scavenger job will become their biggest nightmare.\n\nI don’t want to give too much of the film away, but it all takes place on this one vessel. The crew is small, and most of them are not going to make it. It wouldn’t be an alien film if there were more than one or two survivors. To sum it up, this movie packs a punch. From the claustrophobic setting to the gore, action, and then the practicality. The practical effects are what make for a great alien film. The previous two films, Prometheus and Alien Covenant, were reliant on CGI and were bigger in scope. Plus, the actors in Alien Romulus were lesser known, and that makes it more difficult for the audience to guess who will live or die. If Sigourney Weaver was going to be in this film, then you would obviously guess that she would survive, but in this film it’s anyone’s guess about who will survive. I think Spaeny and Jonsson were the best of the acting ensemble because of their rapport. They really felt like family and that they deeply cared for each other even though Andy is a synthetic human. Other than that, the rest of the ensemble was okay, but most of them did not make it to the end of the movie. If you plan on seeing this film, try to watch Prometheus, Alien Covenant, and then Alien in that order. The only downside about the film is that it is connected to the prequel films. It’s up to you how informed you want to be about previous events heading into this film.\n\nOverall, this has everything you would want in an alien film and more. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would consider buying it when released. So, head to the theater or drive-in at least once to see this thrilling and claustrophobic film before it’s too late.\n\nRating: 4 out of 5\n\nIt’s been 6 years since we last saw the “Merc with the Mouth” on the big screen, but the wait is finally over with Deadpool and Wolverine. Directed by Shawn Levy best known for The Adam Project, Free Guy, Stranger Things, and Night at the Museum.\n\nIn this latest installment, we find Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) giving up the mantle of Deadpool after the events in the second film. He is no longer with his longtime girlfriend, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), and is living with his former roommate Blind Al (Leslie Uggams). Everything seems to be quite normal for Wade until he gets intercepted by the TVA (The Time Variance Authority) who oversees the sacred timeline throughout all the multiverses. To best understand the TVA, just watch Loki on Disney Plus. Wade believes he’s been taken for changing the outcome of specific events in the last film, but that’s not why Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) has taken Wade. Mr. Paradox oversees Wade's timeline across universes and must warn Wade that his timeline will be erased because the anchor being of his timeline has died. Once an anchor passes away, that world’s timeline ceases to exist on the sacred timeline. That anchor for Wade was Wolverine, and he passed away in the film Logan. When Wade learns about Wolverine he must make a choice. He can either leave his friends behind and let his world die, or he can travel the multiverse to find another Wolverine to save his timeline. Let’s just say the title of the film gives away that plot line. So, Wade snatches a new Wolverine from a different universe. Mr. Paradox isn’t quite a fan of that decision because it sends both Deadpool and Wolverine to the Void. Deadpool and Wolverine will have to work together to make their way through this wasteland of forgotten timelines. On this Journey, they will have to deal with Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), the evil twin of Charles Xavier, and avoid being eaten by the being Alioth. To make it back to the real world they’ll have to be able to work with each other and not try to kill each other. If not, Mr. Paradox will completely prune Wade’s timeline.\n\nI know this explanation is a bit confusing, but this movie is all about the epic journey of two comic book characters that fans have been dreaming about for years. Marvel has been striking out on most of their projects ever since Avengers End Game, and to release a film like this now has bumped them back up into the good graces of Marvel fans. I have been one of those comic book fans that has been patiently waiting for this day, and boy was I not disappointed. From the very first scene to the very last I was on cloud nine. All the cameos, jokes, and rapport between Jackman and Reynolds were top tier. I never felt like the movie dragged on or found myself bored while watching it. It was so much fun, and the action was phenomenal. Shawn Levy understood the task of what the fans wanted out of this movie and went above and beyond. Plus, we get to see Wolverine in his actual suit from the comics and that just sweetened the deal. The cameos in this film were insane, some expected and others a total surprise. When it came to the villains of the film, they were there to help with the plot but weren’t that influential to the story. This was about why Deadpool exists and how Wolverine can redeem himself after disappearing from the timeline he came from. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed seeing Cassandra Nova on the big screen, but she wasn’t much of a threat. This movie really focused on Deadpool and Wolverines interactions, Deadpool entering the MCU, cameos, action, and comedy. If you’re seeing a Deadpool film that’s what you want to see. I was not disappointed.\n\nOverall, if you’re a comic book fan like me go see this film! If you enjoy action, go see this film! Or if you’re just an avid movie fan, go see this film! This is the film of the summer and maybe the year. See it a couple of times in theaters and then buy it on Blu Ray or 4K DVD.\n\nRating: 5 out of 5\n\nAlmost 28 years after the original tornado disaster film hit the big screen with Twister, we are being treated to a new take on the classic with Director Lee Isaac Chung’s version called Twisters. The question is “Does this live up to the hype of the original?” I guess we’ll find out.\n\nOur story takes place in Oklahoma as we follow storm chaser and college student, Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones). She is trying to destroy a tornado using a concept she created to gain grant money for her PhD. In doing so, the tornado she tries to extinguish is an EF5 instead of an EF1. The EF5 prevents the chemical components from working and this results in the loss of her boyfriend and two other college friends who were helping with project “Dorothy.” Five years go by, and Kate is working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in New York City. She is approached by her former colleague and friend who was at the scene of the incident five years ago, Javi (Anthony Ramos), and he is asking Kate to help study tornadoes. The goal is to help people in Oklahoma that must deal with the devastation of losing their homes. She agrees to do so and is introduced to the hot head, Tyler Owens (Glen Powell), who calls himself the “Tornado Wrangler” on YouTube. As Javi’s research team and Owens compete to find the perfect tornado to study, Kate and Tyler start to form a connection that seems to be unexpected because of how opposite they are. As Kate continues to struggle with the repercussions of what happened when she last went storm chasing, she finds the strength in herself to try her theory out once more with the help of Tyler. Will it be all for nothing? Or can Kate redeem herself and save the people of Oklahoma from these deadly tornadoes?\n\nIt's hard not to watch this film and think of the original. From the very first scene to the very last all I could think about was Bill Paxton’s and Helen Hunt’s characters going through this insane journey of surviving tornadoes so Paxton can get Hunt to sign divorce papers. Spoiler Alert, she doesn’t sign them, and they stay together. Now, don’t get me wrong, even though I was thinking about the original I still had some fun watching this new rendition. I think the show stealer was Glen Powell, but I did like the chemistry between Powell and Jones. It felt very natural and not like some cheesy rom-com. The special effects were somewhat impressive, but I do have to say some of them did not look great, and I think the original did a better job. There are effects that make you feel like you are looking at a real tornado, but there are also many scenes where you could just tell it was a CGI funnel wiping across the screen. That did disappoint me a bit because the first film really made it feel real.\n\nIf you want excitement and the thrill of what it’s like to be up close and personal with a tornado, go see this film in theaters at least once. This is one of the few Summer Blockbusters that has been popular this year. Even though I do lean more towards watching the original over the new reboot, it’s worth the watch.\n\nRating: 3.7 out 5\n\nIt’s time once again to stay as quiet as possible to avoid the creepy crawling alien creatures that just invaded Earth in A Quiet Place: Day One. Directed by Michael Sarnoski, best known for Pig.\n\nWe are introduced to Sam (Lupita Nyong’o) who lives in hospice care in New York City as she is dealing with a terminal illness. You learn that she is angry about her situation as she speaks out in support groups about her disdain of living in hospice care. She does have a support animal, a cat named Frodo, that provides her comfort, protection, and a way to find help when she has a medical emergency. Sam’s therapist, Reuben (Alex Wolff), convinces her to head to the city to see a show with the group and to get pizza. She agrees to go not knowing that everything is about to change in the world she once knew. As they enjoy a puppet show there is a heavy military presence in the city, but the residents don’t seem to be concerned and go about their day. That’s until Reuben receives a call and is told to leave the city with the hospice patients. But, by that time it’s too late. Asteroids have entered Earth’s atmosphere and are landing in the city. That’s when we are introduced to the alien creatures that seek silence. This is when Sam’s and Frodo’s journey begins. The goal is to head to Harlem to get a piece of pizza from Patsy’s. I know what you’re thinking, “A whole movie about alien creatures and the main character wants a piece of pizza?” Trust me, I get it, but there’s more to it than just getting pizza. Along the way, she will run into an English law student, Eric (Joseph Quinn), who tags along to help her get to Harlem. She will help him get out of the city and to the boating docks. Even though Sam isn’t happy that Eric has joined her she will eventually find comfort that she had at least one friend by her side during the end of the world.\n\nOverall, this film is very different from the other two films that came before it. Since it is a prequel, It doesn’t connect to the original storyline of the family from the first film. There is a character from the second film that makes a tiny appearance in this film, but that is the only connection to the other films. A viewer who hasn’t seen the prior two films won’t feel confused about what is happening in the story. I felt that the chemistry between Nyong’o and Quinn was electric. The rapport between them made you believe that they were two random strangers that would ultimately end up being friends through the worst experience ever. When it came to special effects, I think those were also well done. The creatures seemed even more realistic than the first film. The sound design was very impressive and really heightened those tense moments when characters needed to be silent. Some problems I had with the film were unnecessary scenes that didn’t serve a purpose to the story, and how easy it was for the characters to reach their pen-ultimate goal. There were obstacles that they needed to get through, but it didn’t have the same sense of urgency as the other films gave off.\n\nIf you enjoyed the previous two films of this franchise, I believe you will enjoy this film. If you have never seen any of these films and are just curious to see what all the news is about, then this would be a good first step before watching the other films. It won’t blow you away like the other two films, but it still has its own flavor to it that makes it watchable.\n\nRating 3.8 out 5\n\nPixar takes us on another trip into the mind to deal with our emotions with Inside Out 2 Directed by Kelsey Mann.\n\nWe are back with the old gang from the first film - Joy (Amy Poehler), Anger (Lewis Black), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Tony Hale), and Disgust (Liza Lapira). They are trying to help Riley (Kensington Tallman) as she becomes a teenager. The only problem is that the teen years bring on new emotions which mess up everything. The new emotions that come into play are Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adele Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Once this happens, Anxiety takes it upon herself to bottle up Riley’s main emotions to help her make new friends when she goes to a hockey camp after teaching her best friends and teammates will be attending a different high school. While dealing with the stress of losing her best friends and trying to get on to the high school hockey team as a freshman, Anxiety will do anything and everything to help, even if it destroys Riley’s standards that she developed over the past 13 years. This will not be an easy task for the original emotions to overcome, but they must do something to get Riley back to her normal self.\n\nI remember watching the first Inside Out film being a little bit skeptical on how they would pull a concept like this off, but they did. Now, my skepticism returned based on the introduction of these new emotions. How would they go about dealing with anxiety, embarrassment, ennui, and envy. What I can say about their approach is that it was pretty much spot on. The concept that they came up with that forced Riley into having these new emotions was very relatable. I think the driving factor in getting these new emotions across was the acting by the whole ensemble. They did a great job embodying their assigned emotion, and that really makes you feel for Riley when something happens outside of her mind. I do think that this film doesn’t have the same energy as the first film, but it is close to what that first film did.\n\nThis film is good for families with young teens that may be going through something similar either to the plot, or just in general. This is one of the best animated films and film of the summer so far.\n\nRating: 4 out of 5\n\nThe big boned cat that loves lasagna and long naps is back on the big screen in Garfield the Movie.\n\nWe find ourselves being introduced to Garfield (Chris Pratt) as a stray cat whose father Vic (Samuel L. Jackson) left him in an alley. As he awaits his father’s return, his hunger and the tempting smell of Italian food leads him to meet Jon (Nicholas Hoult). That’s when a beautiful friendship begins, and we are led to believe Garfield will never see his father again. Fast forward, and we find Garfield grown up and manipulating his best pal Odie (Harvey Guillen) to do his bidding. It seems Garfield is living his best life until he’s kidnapped by cat named Jinx (Hannah Waddingham). Jinx uses Garfield as bait to bring Vic out of hiding to force him and his son to pull off a heist stealing many, many, many ounces of milk from a dairy farm. Vic specializes in pulling off heists but has not done the best job being a father. That makes this heist extremely difficult to pull off given he abandoned Garfield. Forcing the pair to work together is either the worst idea ever, or it could re-kindle their father and son relationship.\n\nThe movie gels well from the editing, animation, and acting. It’s a fun film to watch. Both Pratt and Jackson were great in their respective roles and really made you believe that they were father and son. The comedy was either a hit or miss throughout but that’s probably because it leaned heavily towards children. The emotional moments hit hard because of why Vic abandoned Garfield. Kids’ movies don’t always have an emotional aspect that really builds on the story, but Garfield did.\n\nI would give this another watch once it comes out on streaming platforms. If you have a family with small children take them out to the theater or drive-in. This is also a good Father’s Day film too, so maybe go see this with your dad.\n\nRating: 3.8 out 5\n\nIt's been over 9 years since we last experienced a film in the Australian wasteland, and now we're back with George Miller's prequel Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\n\nWe go back in time to follow Furiosa's (Anya Taylor-Joys) journey from a child until she shows up in Mad Max Fury Road. The story is mostly about revenge against Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) whose men kidnapped Furiosa from her home and murdered her mother. She is made to become the child of Dementus who is the leader of a biker gang. Then, they run into Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme), best known as the main villain in Fury Road. He wants Furiosa in return for allowing Dementus to take over a part of Joe's operation of distributing gasoline across the wasteland. We watch Furiosa grow up over a course of 15 years as she plots her escape to get back home. Unfortunately, Dementus enters her life once again leaving her no choice but to take him out. This then leads to all-out war across the wasteland between Joe and Dementus as Furiosa stealthily plans her attack.\n\nThis is a straightforward film that is easy to follow. It follows all the tropes of a hero - starts off with a good life, something bad happens, plans for revenge, and ends with them getting revenge. Since this is a spinoff prequel to an earlier film, I expected a more complex story line and a clearer explanation of the origin of Dementus. I would say the acting in this was really well done, especially by the title characters of Anya Taylor-Jone and Chris Hemsworth. The action was amazing and picked up where it left off with Fury Road. A lot of the stunts pulled off were practical, but some CGI was used. The CGI at sometimes was a bit shoddy and the use of green screen was prevalent. Overall, it didn't take me out of the film, but it was very noticeable.\n\nAll-in-all, if you're a diehard Mad Max fan then you will enjoy this film. If you're into insane action sequences that use a lot of practical effects, then this film is for you. If you don't enjoy any of those things, then go see Garfield The Movie. I would say it’s worth seeing this film one time on the big screen.\n\nRating: 4.2 out of 5\n\nDirector Wes Ball, best known for The Maze Runner trilogy, takes us back to a post pandemic world where apes have become the superior species with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nThe story takes place almost three hundred years after the death of Caesar in War of the Planet of the Apes. Since then, the ape species has grown more intelligent and have become the dominant species in the food chain. Humans have reverted to their primitive forms. They are unable to speak and think due to a virus (humans created) that almost eradicated all of humanity in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. In this latest installment, we are introduced to a new protagonist, Noa (Owen Teague), who is a part of the Eagle Clan. Noa has never ventured outside the parameters of his home until it is attacked by a group of apes that work for a ruler named Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand). Noa’s clan is captured and taken to Proximus’s kingdom to work as slaves. This forces Noa to leave his home and save his clan. Along the way he meets an orangutan named Raka (Peter Macon) who teaches Noa about Caesars’ reign as leader of the apes and his relationship with humans. That’s when a human, Mae (Freya Allan), comes into the picture. She is being sought after by Proximus’s men. We learn that Mae is the key to accessing a vault Proximus is trying to open. It holds human secrets that could help him further his knowledge and reign over ape kind. Mae refuses to help, but still needs to access the vault for a reason that isn’t explained until the very end of the film. Both Mae and Noa will need each other’s help if they want to take down Proximus.\n\nThis is the first film out of the rebooted Planet of the Apes saga, and the story line now matches the first movie that came out back in 1968. So, there is a vintage vibe to the overall style and theme throughout that pays homage to when Charlton Heston was squaring up apes. I was a bit disappointed that this story did not follow Caesar’s family lineage and what it could be three hundred years after his death. It seemed Ball wanted to create a new protagonist that had no relation to the previous three ape films. That’s okay, but Noa’s character wasn’t all that interesting, and he bogged the film down. The character I enjoyed the most was Proximus Caesar, and he was barely in the film. I would of really loved it if we had more of a back story for him. He calls himself “Proximus” due to the Roman Empire and “Caesar” because he believes he is a reincarnation of “Caesar.” Even though Proximus is doing the opposite of what Caesar believed in, he convinces his followers that he is “Caesar.” As for Mae, I wasn’t extremely invested in her story because little was shared about her. She was there to serve a purpose for one thing and that was it. I don’t know if she’ll return for future movies, but it seemed like her story just ends with this film. The special effects and action sequences were well done and the continuity from the previous ape films in those areas felt flawless.\n\nOverall, this film was somewhat of a letdown from the previous ones. I didn’t feel the same emotions I had when watching the other films and that was a bit of a bummer. If you do see this in theaters, go for the special effects and action. Don’t go if you’re looking for an exciting plot.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5\n\nA love letter to all stunt performers in the movie business comes from The Fall Guy. Directed by David Leitch, former stunt man, best known for directing Deadpool 2 and Bullet Train.\n\nOur main character Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for one of the most popular actors on the planet, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). At the beginning of the film we are introduced to Colt’s love interest, cinematographer Jody Moreno (Emily Bunt), who Colt is working together on a film. That’s when one of the stunts he attempts goes horribly wrong taking him out of the stunt game for a year. Then he gets a phone call from producer Gail Meyer (Hannah Waddingham) to come out of retirement because they need an experienced stunt guy for a new film that happens to be Jody’s directorial debut. It’s been almost a year since the incident and Colt has not reconnected with Jody. This makes it awkward when he shows up and finds out that she did not want him to be in her film. As Colt tries to rekindle his relationship with Jody, Gail tasks him with finding the lead actor Ryder because he has gone missing. What seems to be a simple task turns out to be a deadly mission and he will have to use his stunt man skills to survive. As the mystery of Ryder’s disappearance unfolds, all the puzzle pieces start connecting. This ends up giving the title of the film two different meanings.\n\nWe have finally reached our first Summer Blockbuster of the year with a fun, comedic, action-packed film that has a lot of heart. Leitch did a great job of both showing how important stunt men are in the film industry and creating a story that lets you relate to the main character. Even though the story is a bit bonkers and is somewhat unrealistic it makes for a great time. The action and stunt sequences were shot so well that it was smooth like butter. Gosling and Blunt’s relationship was very genuine and not cheesy. There was heart and passion between these two characters, and that made their relationship believable. Some sequences did use CGI which wasn’t as polished, but I’ll give it a pass because I really did have a lot of fun watching this film. Other than that, it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific issues I had with the plot, acting, or special effects.\n\nIf you want to start your Summer off with a fun and explosive film, make sure you head to theaters to see The Fall Guy. It is the perfect film for action, romantic, and comedy junkies.\n\nRating: 4 out 5\n\nSink your teeth into the all-new film made by Radio Silence, best known for Scream 6 and Ready or Not, with Abigail.\n\nOur story follows a group of criminals, Joey (Melissa Barrera), Frank (Dan Stevens), Sammy (Kathryn Newton), Peter (Kevin Durand), Rickles (William Catlett), and Dean (Angus Cloud), who kidnap a powerful underworld figure’s daughter named Abigail (Alisha Weir). The goal is to hold her for ransom in an abandoned mansion for 24 hours until they get paid $50 million in total. What they don’t know is that they are stuck inside a mansion with a blood-sucking vampire. How is this little girl a vampire? Why are the criminals locked inside the mansion? And what relation do these criminals have with the child they kidnapped? The mystery unravels as a ballerina vampire wreaks havoc on these worthless criminals.\n\nIt’s hard to explain the full plot without spoiling the story because the preview for this movie already reveals that the title character is a vampire. I had a feeling that it wasn’t just about a vampire ballerina taking out criminals, but that there was something more meaningful going on. That extra plot point made the movie more intriguing and kept me interested in what was happening on the screen. I think the acting made the experience better because the interaction between the criminals and Abigail was a lot of fun to watch. The best part of the movie was Weir’s performance as the ballerina vampire. She was extremely manipulative and clever at fooling these criminals. The gore in this movie was extreme, with body parts flying and blood being splattered all over the place. So, do not take your children to this film. The downside to this film is that the movie’s ending felt anti-climactic and took the wonderment and mystery out of the viewing experience. Since this makes or breaks a film for me, it was a bit disappointing.\n\nThe overall verdict is that this film is a good time for horror fans, or fans of Radio Silence. I would suggest seeing this in the theater. If you want to wait and have a scary movie night at home, this would be the perfect film to do so.\n\n3.8 out 5\n\nA rag tag group of misfits are tasked to go behind enemy lines to disrupt German forces during WWII in The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. Directed by Guy Ritchie who is best known for Sherlock Holmes, Snatch, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and The Gentlemen.\n\nWe find ourselves introduced to Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill) who is being tasked with an off the books mission created by Prime Minister Churchill (Rory Kinnear) and Brigadier Gubbins ‘M’ (Cary Elwes). Phillips is viewed as a delinquent in the eyes of the British government due to not following orders, but he is an excellent leader when executing his ridiculous plans. The goal is to have Phillips’ team - Ander Lassen (Alan Ritchson), Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer), Henry Hayes (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), and Henry Golding (Freddy Alvarez) - travel to Fernando Po, an island near Africa occupied by German, Italian, and Spanish fleets. The island houses an Italian supply ship called the Duchessa. This boat carries supplies to the German U-Boats which have devastated the UK by sinking many of their supply and aid ships. The goal is to sink the Duchessa, and the two tugboats attached to the ship. This will take out the German U-Boat fleet for good. To help set up the operation before Phillips arrives to Fernando Po, Marjorie Stewart (Eiza Gonzalez) goes undercover as an actress to pull information about the Duchessa from the German in charge of the ship. Heron (Babs Olusanmokun), the owner of the hotel and casino in Fernando Po, works with Stewart to prepare for the day of the operation. Will this mission sail smoothly? Or will it sink?\n\nThis film from start to finish really grabs your attention with its characters, story, and action sequences. Ritchie usually does a great job in those three categories, and I think he hit it out of the ballpark with this film. Cavill did an amazing job of playing Phillips because he just had fun with the role. It seemed like it was just effortless for him to become this unhinged soldier who executes insane plans that no one in their right mind would try. As for the other actors in this film, I feel like they all brought their A-game. I didn’t get the sense that any of them were phoning in their performance or that they weren’t at the tier Cavill was performing at. The action sequences in this film were well done from the use of practical effects to the execution of the fighting choreography. You could just feel every punch, shot, stab, and explosion through the sound design, and that made it even more enthralling. As for the story, Ritchie did a great job of keeping it interesting by effectively using dramatization and music to make specific scenes impactful.\n\nOverall, I would highly suggest seeing this film in theaters. It’s just a fun movie that is based on a true story with great acting and awesome action sequences. What more could you ask for in a film?\n\nRating: 4 out of 5\n\nA small group of media members work their way through a dystopian America to the White House in Alex Garland’s Civil War.\n\nIn this film, we follow war photographer Lee (Kirsten Dunst) with journalists Joel (Wagner Moura) and Sammy (Stephen McKinley Henderson). Jessie (Cailee Spaeny), a young and inspired photographer, joins Lee as her inspiration for entering the media industry. The group’s goal is to make it to Washington D.C. to interview the President of the United States (Nick Offerman) before the Western Forces attack the White House and remove the third term President. As they make their way to the capital, you only get bits and pieces of why states have succeeded from the United States and started a civil war. You learn that the Western Forces are a military group that resulted from a Texas and California alliance. As the characters travel to the capital, you witness the horrors of war between American citizens. Lee tutors Jessie about the ins and outs of war photography along the way to prepare her for the insanity that will ensue once they reach Washington D.C.\n\nWords really can’t describe how disappointed I am after watching this film. From start to finish, I just wanted the film to be over. The story was extremely vague, the acting was stale, and the only thing that made it somewhat interesting was the action. I’m not sure what Garland was going for with this film, but I feel like he completely missed the mark. He could have made something that was impactful and meaningful, but it was just mindless cinema. I mean Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire had a more impactful message than Civil War, and that is saying something. I don’t know why some people are saying this is one of Garland’s best films to date. He directed 28 Days Later and Ex Machina, and they were both far superior to this film.\n\nOverall, I don’t recommend seeing this film in theaters. I’m not sure I would even want to spend money on renting it once it hits streaming services. Wait until it is completely free if you want to watch it. If you think you’re missing out on some phenomenon by not seeing it, don’t worry – you’re not. Trust me.\n\nRating: 2 out 5\n\nMaking his directorial debut is Dev Patel with a gruesome story about revenge, real world issues in India, and Indian religion with Monkey Man.\n\nWe find Patel's character, Kid, fighting at an underground club where he is known as Monkey Man. The name originates from a religious figure called Hanuman, which he learned about from his mother as a child. By taking on this persona, Kid plans to exact his revenge on the people who murdered his mother and burned his village to the ground. To execute his plan, he must first gain access to the building where the people responsible meet. He does this by getting a job as a servant and then gradually works his way up the ladder to come face to face with his enemies. To see their downfall, he will need to learn about the ways of the Monkey Man.\n\nI really enjoyed this film on many levels - the story, the cinematography, and the acting. It made you feel a wide variety of emotions which in my opinion is very important when watching any film. It pulls at all the heartstrings when it needs to, but then increases your blood pressure when the all-out brawl breaks out. Each scene felt necessary to the narrative of the film making it an enjoyable viewing experience. The cinematography was well done for the fight sequences giving them a very realistic feel. The camera was shaky throughout, but that brought a sense of realness to the fights. Now, if you have a history of motion sickness, I do not recommend you seeing this film (I'm not kidding). Other than that, I really enjoyed Patel's all out performance and his ability to embody the Monkey Man.\n\nThe supporting cast did a good job too. The villains in this film were unredeemable and you wanted to see them get taken down. An issue I had with the film was at times the dialogue between actors was difficult to hear. This took me out of the viewing experience sometimes. I felt the same way during some of the action sequences. You didn't really feel the effect of how hard some of the hits were when Patel went on a complete rampage. When I see films that rely on hand-to-hand combat, I need to feel the impact of the punches and hits to keep me invested.\n\nWith that being said, I really enjoyed my time watching this film. I think Patel has a bright future directing more feature films, and I will be looking forward to seeing what he does next. If you want to add some excitement to your weekend, I highly suggest seeing this in theaters at least once. The story is great, and the fight sequences are worth the cost of admission.\n\nRating 4 out of 5\n\nPrepare yourself for destruction and monster mayhem with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Bringing these two characters back to the big screen is Adam Wingard who directed Godzilla vs. Kong back in 2021.\n\nThe film takes place a couple of years after the matchup between Godzilla, Kong, and Mecha Godzilla. We find Kong living out his days in Hollow Earth searching for his own species and really a sense of belonging. While Kong continues his search, we find Godzilla traveling around the world defeating various Titans and building up his power level for some odd reason. We are re-introduced to returning human characters from the last film with Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) who oversees Kong for Monarch, Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) a conspiracy theorist podcaster, and Jia (Kaylee Hottle) who is the last descendant of the Iwi tribe that worships Kong on Skull Island. The newest addition is Trapper (Dan Stevens) who plays the veterinarian for Kong. These four characters will team up to learn about a new threat in Hollow Earth called the Skar King. Skar King leads a group of species like Kong to find one of the portals that leads to the surface and rule over all of Earth. To prevent this outcome Kong will need to team up with Godzilla to prevent the end of Hollow Earth and humanity.\n\nThis film from start to finish is straightforward. You don’t need to do a lot of thinking or be emotionally invested. It’s just one big monster fighting another big monster with a sprinkled in plot that really doesn’t mean a whole lot. On top of that, the newest character, Trapper, seemed to have all the answers to help move the plot forward, but didn’t. The same goes for the overall storyline the humans deal with when helping Godzilla and Kong with the fight against Skar King. Speaking of Scar King, I had some high hopes but in the end that character just flopped. I wanted to be fearful of him but really, he was just there to be a punching bag for Godzilla and Kong. There wasn’t any real threat except the destruction of a lot of cities with massive casualties. I just find it difficult to watch these types of films and be invested when I know it’s going to be a slugfest with no real storyline that is worthwhile. In my opinion, Godzilla Minus One is a far superior film and has a human storyline that pulls at your heartstrings.\n\nOverall, this film had some good action sequences, but the story and villain are very bland to say the least. You might want to see it once in a theater to experience it on the large screen with theater sound. If you have a good sound system and large TV at home, then watch it there when it’s available to rent.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5\n\nThis loveable and terrifying video game finally hit the big screen over the weekend with Five Nights at Freddy’s.\n\nThe main protagonist of the film is Mike (Josh Hutcherson) has been trying to stay above water by supporting his younger sister Abbey (Piper Rubio) as her guardian. It’s been somewhat difficult for him to keep a job due to unresolved trauma from when his younger brother was kidnapped on a camping trip. While dealing with that his unflattering aunt has been trying to take custody of Abbey. With all this pent-up stress and aggression Mike loses another job forcing him to head to a career service center. Career Counselor, Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard), offers Mike the opportunity to be the night security guard at a once popular kids pizza place, which turns out to be Freddy Fazzbears Pizzeria. The store closed back in the 80’s due to the disappearances of several children and since then new security guards have been hired to keep the public out. To help Mike make sure the public is safe from Freddy’s is police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail). The only question Mike has is “Why are they trying to keep the public out?” Well, that answer might lie within the ominous animatronic characters that have never been removed from the establishment. While Mike gets to learn more about Freddy, Foxy, Bonnie, and Chica he’ll also get closer to the truth about what happened to his younger brother all those years ago. The only thing he’ll have to do is survive the night.\n\nTalk about an interesting premise for a film that deals with killer animatronics. I thought that the story was going to delve deeper into the pizzeria lore, but instead it was solely focused on Mike. I didn’t think it was a bad idea to go in that direction but by doing so it took a lot of air out of the horror aspect of the film. Never once was I on the edge of my seat, had an increased heart rate, or had to shield my eyes due to the suspense factor of the film. This was more about dealing with trauma and how to get past it while dealing with killer animatronics in the background. Now, the animatronics were cool looking, but not scary. I think the producers for this film had many different ideas about what they wanted and kind of blended it all together and got this film. I thought the acting was fine and the production value was fantastic, but I just needed more horror for such an extremely popular horror video game.\n\nIf you want to see this film do not waste your hard-earned cash on it. Try to watch it on Peacock if you have that streaming service or wait until it is free to watch. Plus, if you are looking for a good scare this is not the film to watch.\n\nRating: 2 out of 5\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon hit theaters over the weekend shining light on a story that many people might have not known about.\n\nThe story is set on a Native American reserve, in Oklahoma, occupied by the Osage tribe who discovered oil on the land back in the late 1800’s. We are then introduced to Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), a soldier returning from World War I, to meet up with his Uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). Hale is a popular figure on the reserve where many natives trust him based on his ability to speak their language and be very hospitable to everyone’s needs. What the Osage doesn’t know is that he is plotting against them to take their land all out of greed. So, when Burkhart wants to start his life on the reserve, his uncle wants him to marry an Osage woman to claim the money she makes off the oil. This is why many white men moved to the area - to marry Osage women. Burkhart meets Mollie (Lily Gladstone) while running his taxi service and truly falls in love with her. They end up getting married, but this is when everything begins to take a dark turn. One by one Mollie’s sisters begin to be mysteriously murdered making her paranoid that she could be next. It doesn’t help either that she has been severely ill while taking insulin to deal with her diabetes. To figure out who is committing the murders the Osage make their way to Washington D.C. to plea with President Coolidge to send help. That’s when a federal investigator, Tom White (Jesse Plemons), is sent by J. Edgar Hoover to the reserve. Can they figure out what is really happening at the reserve? Or will these murders go unsolved?\n\nI think this might be one of Scorsese’s best pieces of cinema to date. From the cinematography to the story, it is a spectacle. It is truly a heartbreaking story in American history that few people know about. Scorsese did a great job building the whole story and providing a sense of satisfaction in the end. I thought the acting was a force of triumph that helped with the story. DiCaprio, in my opinion, might have had his best performance since The Revenant. De Niro did an amazing job bringing real life villain, William Hale, to life. Gladstone might be a candidate for best actress in a motion picture this year, because her presence on screen was so enthralling. The rest of the cast was also great because they made it feel like you were in Oklahoma in the 1920’s when this was all happening. My only quarrel with the film was the run time which clocks in at three and a half hours. I could sense that Scorsese really put his all into this film, but the run time did wear me down a bit.\n\nAll in all, Killers of the Flower Moon is must see cinema. I highly recommend seeing this at least once in theaters to get that big screen experience. This will be nominated for many awards this year and it should be. This is one of the best movies of the year.\n\nRating: 4 out 5\n\nBlumhouse Productions resurrects one of the most iconic horror films of all time by adding a sequel to it with The Exorcist: Believer. Directed by David Gordon Green who is best known for the recent Halloween trilogy.\n\nThis sequel follows a photographer, Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr.), as he tries to work and be a single parent to his 13-year-old daughter Angela (Lidya Jewett). Victor’s daughter is somewhat of a miracle child. Her mother passed away during childbirth due to a natural disaster that happened when the couple was on vacation. We are then introduced to Lydia’s friend from school Katherine (Olivia O’Neill). As the two meet at school, they come up with a plan to go into the woods next to the school and attempt to reach out to the other side to see if Lydia can connect with her mother. Instead, something far more sinister answers and possesses both of them. Now, Victor must team up with multiple religious figures and Katherine’s parents to save the children. Victor also receives help from Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) who dealt with the same kind of issue back in the 1970s when her daughter, Regan, became possessed. Can Victor save his daughter? Or will it be too late?\n\nLet me start off by saying this film is not worth your time. It hurts to say that, but it is the complete truth. There was nothing in this film that made me jump out of my seat form pure terror. It felt uninspired from start to finish and when everything was done, I just sat in my seat and thought, “That was it?”. The acting was subpar to say the least and sometimes very comical when it wasn’t trying to be. I didn’t feel any emotional connections to the characters because they all felt like they were playing one specific note. There was no range in emotions that made me feel what they were feeling. Now, let’s talk about the story. It was a very simplistic plot that really didn’t focus on the exorcist part of the film. That doesn’t happen until the very end. When you have the name “exorcist” in the title I feel like that should be the whole plot of the movie. Don’t just throw it in at the end and call it good. Then you add in the special effects that were mostly all CGI and felt like you were watching a video game.\n\nSo, what is my final verdict? I think you get the picture but to make it clearer do not see this film. It was a let down for anyone that enjoys the horror genre and a let down for anybody that enjoys the original Exorcist. If you want a quality horror film to watch about exorcisms, then just rent the original. Do not waste your money on this film.\n\nRating: 1 out of 5\n\nA world where humans and robots with artificial intelligence co-exist makes for an interesting plot in The Creator. Directed by Gareth Edwards, best known for Rogue Ones a Star Wars Story, The Creator brings a fresh take in the Sci-Fi genre.\n\nIn the year 2055 artificial intelligence destroys Los Angeles with a nuclear bomb. Now, the U.S. government is trying to erase its creation from existence to keep the world safe. There plan is to send someone undercover to assassinate the person still creating AI in New Asia, Nirmata. Enter Sergeant Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) who goes undercover to find Nirmata by marrying his daughter Maya (Gemma Chan). Taylor’s cover is blown when the army shows up exposing him and ending his marriage by killing his wife. Years after the traumatic experience Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) asks for Taylor’s help to find a weapon that can take down the space station NOMAD (North American Orbital Mobile Aerospace Defense) because of its ability to execute fatal aerial strikes. Taylor decides to help when learning that his wife may possibly be alive after seeing video footage from the government. While breaching the facility to get the weapon, he learns that the threat is just a child. He later names her Alphie (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). Now, he must make the choice of taking out the threat or protecting the weapon and use it to find his wife. The only problem is that the whole U.S. government is coming after him.\n\nWe have gone through many years where originality has been hard to come by when it comes to movies. A lot of films are either superhero stories, reboots, or knock off films of other films. This film feeds off different ideas of other popular movies, but it still has its own identity which differentiates it from other Sci-Fi films. The story wasn’t anything new, but the world is what makes the story unique. I felt like the Colonel Howell character was unnecessary, but her character did represent the government doing whatever it takes to take this weapon. The relationship between Washington and Voyles was sensational and will pull at your heart strings until the very end. If that chemistry between those two didn’t work the film would suffer. The CGI in this film may be some of the best I have seen in a while. The robots felt so real especially with the design of New Asia. You really feel like this type of society could exist in the next 50 years or so. It was done so well.\n\nThe overall verdict is that we now have a new Sci-Fi film that is our modern 2001 Space Odyssey. I think Gareth Edwards has a unique take on this genre and I hope we see more movies like this moving forward. I highly recommend seeing this in theaters and buying this on Blu Ray or 4K.\n\nRating: 4 out 5\n\nThe world-renowned detective Hercule Poirot is back in A Haunting in Venice. Directed by and starring in the lead role as the detective is Kenneth Branagh. This is the third installment of the series based on the Agatha Christie novels.\n\nIn this new installment, Detective Poirot is living quietly in Venice while enjoying retirement from detective work. That’s until an old friend, Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey), who is a mystery novel writer finds Poirot and asks him to join her in a seance. The séance takes place on Halloween at an orphanage turned into a home where a grieving mother, Rowena Drake (Kelly Reilly), wants to reconnect with her deceased daughter who jumped out of a window due to being haunted by the spirits of orphans that once lived in that house. Running the séance is Mrs. Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh) who is attempting to connect with Rowena’s daughter. Joining the late-night event is Rowena’s daughter’s doctor Leslie Ferrier (Jamie Dorna), the maid Olga Seminoff (Camille Cottin), the doctor’s son Leopold Ferrier (Jude Hill), and Poirot’s security guard Vitale Portfoglio (Riccardo Samarcio). As the séance is happening Poirot can piece together the fake spiritual occurrences until something unexplained happens. This then makes Poirot question if the afterlife exists. While reflecting on this, a murder is committed. Poirot must now shut down the house to figure out who the murderer is, but was the murder committed by someone at the séance or was it one of the deceased orphans?\n\nRight off the bat this film is a lot better than the past two films. The other films felt very flat and predictable. In this film the first murder happens, and you really have no idea who did it. The whole reason why you just don’t know is because of the spiritual aspect to the story. The film makes you believe that maybe one of the spirits did commit the murder because of what happens during the séance. I think that was done very well. I did like the environment they were in with all the darkened hallways, and everything was lit by candlelight. It makes the home feel like a haunted house and the architecture of the home adds more creepiness to the story. Now, is this a horror film? No, this is not a horror film but there are jump scares throughout. So, if you did bring someone that’s 13 years old you don’t need to worry about possibly traumatizing them at the theater. I think the acting in this was well done by everyone, but I wasn’t a big fan with how fast the movie went by. I felt like the movie needed thirty more minutes to really expand on the mystery of the murder, but the reveal at the end was shocking.\n\nI did find myself having a good time watching this film, especially at the theater. I think you should see this at least once in theaters to really get the full experience of what the film offers. Especially with Halloween right around the corner, this would be a good movie to start the spooky season off with.\n\nRating: 3.5 out 5\n\nValak returns to wreak havoc on an all-girl boarding school in France with The Nun II. Directed by Michael Chaves best known for The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It and The Curse of La Llorona.\n\nThe film takes us back to 1956 France when a priest is murdered through a heinous act that serves as a warning to the Vatican of Valak’s return. Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) is tasked with finding this demon once more and defeating it for good. Joining her along the way is Sister Debra (Storm Reid) who watches out for Irene in case she is in trouble. Popping back up from the first film is Maurice (Jonas Bloquet) who helped Irene defeat Valak in the first film. The only issue is Maurice is possessed by the demon and he is torturing an all-girl boarding school without realizing it. Irene will eventually learn about why Valak is at this school and what the demon intends to do.\n\nWe are once again sent back to The Conjuring universe in The Nun II. I had a way better time watching this film compared to the first one. I think that the story had a lot more beef compared to its counterpart that relied on jump scares the whole time. The jump scares in the new film were done a lot better than the first one. They really packed a punch, and the gore and intensity were brought up a notch showing how powerful Valak really is. The acting was a lot better as well.\n\nThe last film felt very mellow dramatic and not realistic. I felt the anguish of the characters when dealing with this psychotic demon. Now, the story was a tad predictable at times which took me out of the film sometimes. There was less CGI done in this film than the first, but I still don’t like seeing CGI in horror films. It must be done well for me to stay interested. I also felt like the detective aspect of the story was done way too fast to just fast forward the movie to the final act.\n\nSo, what is the final verdict on this film? Well, I would say if you’re an avid horror movie fan that you should see this in theaters at least once. If you want to just scare your friend that hates horror movies wait until it comes out on digital and do it, then. This is also perfect timing for Halloween. It’s a good sub average film that can give all the scares of a typical horror film with a little uniqueness to it.\n\nRating: 3 out 5\n\nA rag tag group of dogs embark on a journey of revenge and comedic mischief in Strays which is an R rated version of Homeward Bound.\n\nThe film follows a dog named Reggie (Will Ferrell) as plans to get revenge on his owner, Doug (Will Forte), for abandoning him because he doesn’t really love him. Reggie teams up with Bug (Jamie Foxx), Maggie (Isla Fisher), and Hunter (Randall Parker) who all agree to help him. While making the journey back to his owner’s home Reggie will learn about what it’s like to be a stray dog with the help of fellow stray Bug. He’ll also learn about the importance of friendship and knowing his worth. While learning all this the group will find themselves in some sticky situations that are action packed to disturbing.\n\nWhat can I say about this film? This is not a film that you would want to bring your kids to. From the very beginning to the very end, it has extremely raunchy from jokes in certain scenes that take place. The story is very straight forward, and a lot of the comedy seemed somewhat familiar from other R rated films I have seen over the years. There were some moments where I laughed out loud, but most of the time I wasn’t that engaged. I think the selling point of the film is the adorable dogs that have famous people voicing them as they just act completely immature. Sometimes that works for certain films, but this was a film that didn’t do that in a clever way.\n\nI wouldn’t waste your money on this film by either seeing it in theater, renting it digitally, or buying it on DVD. This is one of those films you could wait two years to find it on a streaming service for free and then watch it. Just make sure you don’t let any children watch it.\n\nRating 2 out of 5\n\nSony’s new film Gran Turismo directed by Neil Blomkamp is based on a true story that puts a racing gamer in a car on the actual racetrack.\n\nThe film follows Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) who is an avid gamer addicted to the game Gran Turismo. His father finds his interest in gaming an issue because he won’t be able to make a living off that lifestyle. Well, Mardenborough’s luck changes when the marketing director of Nissan, Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), offers him the chance to compete with other Gran Turismo gamers to become a real race car driver. Mardenborough beats out the other gamers and becomes the face of Nissan racing. We then follow Mardenborough through his first couple of races as he is coached by former driver Jack Slater (David Harbour). Will Mardenborough succeed and make his way to the podium? Or will he crash and burn in the end?\n\nI had a somewhat enjoyable time watching this film. I say somewhat, because the thing that really sold the movie for me were the race sequences with Madekwe and Harbour’s acting. Outside of that the film had some generic storytelling where the father disapproves Jann’s lifestyle and then there’s a love interest that felt unnecessary to the story. The whole plot with his family felt pointless because we see his family at the beginning of the film and then they show back up at the very end. So, when it got to an emotional part between Jann and his dad, I felt nothing because this is basically the first time we see him since the beginning of the movie. Other than those issues I think the racing sequences were well done from the cinematography to the dialogue between Jann and Jack. I think Blomkamp did a great job making the viewer feel like they’re a part of the race too.\n\nAside from the romantic interest and family storyline the racing part of the story was well done. The video effects, cinematography, dialogue, and the racing sequences were engaging and felt like a video game. Do I recommend seeing this in theaters? No, I think you can wait for this to come out on streaming and check it out then. I do recommend watching it at least once.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5\n\nThe DC Universe is back again with the new superhero movie Blue Beetle directed by Angel Manuel Soto.\n\nIn the film, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Mariduena), a recent college graduate, receives a device called the Scarab from Jenny Kord (Bruna Maquezine), the daughter of Ted Kord and former head of Kord Industries. Jaime is tasked to keep this hidden from Jenny’s aunt, Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), who seeks to use this device to create super soldiers. Even though Jenny tells Jaime not to mess with the Scarab, he does anyway. In doing so, the device activates and fuses to Jamie’s body, turning him into the Blue Beetle. Victoria sends mercenary Carapax, also known as The Indestructible Man, from Kord Industries to hunt Jamie down. He will need the help of his family and especially his tech savvy uncle, Rudy Reyes (Mario Lopez), to take down Kord Industries.\n\nI really enjoyed watching this movie over the weekend. The action sequences were a lot of fun and the comedy was great. It felt like I was watching a phase one Marvel movie set in the DC Universe. This is very weird to say because a lot of DC films are a little darker and grittier than Marvel. I think Mariduena did an excellent job as Jaime and the Blue Beetle. I thought he was the perfect choice to play this character and hopefully we will see more of him in the future. The other big takeaway for me was how the Reyes family is the focal point of the film. I think Soto did a great job of showing this family that is struggling on all ends of the spectrum, but they never give up. You also feel you’re a part of the family throughout the movie. So, when something emotional happens, you’ll feel the same way the family feels. I think the story and characters were written exceptionally well to portray the family aspect, which is a big testament of the movie. Other than that, the film seems a tad generic for the superhero storyline, and that the villains were uninspired. It seemed like they really wanted this to be about the family and then have the villains sprinkled in to create some tension.\n\nOverall, this is a movie that families should see in theaters. Not because it’s a superhero film, but because it is a movie about a family that must deal with adversity. A lot of families go through similar situations (minus the superhero part) that can be relatable. I think you’ll have a fun time with a lot of laughs and some moments that will leave you in “awe.” Check this film out at least once in theaters.\n\nRating: 3.7 out 5\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula chapter “The Captain’s Log” comes to the big screen with The Last Voyage of the Demeter directed by André Øvredal.\n\nThe main protagonist is Clemens (Corey Hawkins) who is seeking help to get back to London because he could not get a job as a doctor due to the color of his skin. While Clemens seeks a ride back to London the story also follows Captain Elliot (Liam Cunningham) as he lets his first mate, Wojeck (David Dastmalchian), know that this will be his last voyage. This will be a voyage the captain will want to forget. The voyage will take the crew from Romania to London with multiple unmarked crates. As the ship sails, the crew’s livestock is slaughtered, and an unidentified woman is found inside one of the crates with bite marks all over her. You soon learn that the woman is Anna (Aisling Franciosi), and she lets the crew know that a being called “Dracula” is on the boat with them. As the four-week voyage continues the crew will have to work together to kill Dracula before they take port in London. The only question is will they be able to survive the last voyage of the Demeter?\n\nI found myself really liking this film even though I was hesitant before seeing it. This movie easily could have been the typical scary movie where you anticipate all the scares and even the outcome of the film. Instead, I found myself on the edge of my seat in fear of what would happen to the crew next. I thought the cast did a really good job with their performances. The design of Dracula was great and some of it seemed practical while most of it was CGI. The film also did a great job of making you think you could see Dracula in the background. Sometimes he was, but then there were moments when the effect just played on your imagination. The only quarrels I had with the film were with the character of Anna because it felt like she served one purpose and that was it. It also plays off some movies I am familiar with like Alien for example. This takes away from the movie because it’s just the same story in a different time.\n\nThe film wasn’t 100% perfect, but I did find myself having a great time. I would watch this again when October rolls around because this has Halloween vibes to it. You can go see this in theater, but I think it would also be okay to wait for it to come out on streaming services.\n\nRating: 3.7 out 5\n\nIt's time to venture down into the sewers below New York City for \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.” Bringing the turtles back to the big screen are directors Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears.\n\nThe film follows the adventures of the four teenage turtles Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), and Donatello (Micah Abbey). They live with their father Splinter (Jackie Chan) who is a rat. He taught the turtles to be ninjas to defend themselves from humans. The story deals with the turtles trying to be accepted by society. Along the way the turtles become friends with student news reporter April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri) who helps them do just that. As luck would have it, a mutant named Superfly (Ice Cube) has teamed up with other mutants to build a device to turn every animal into a mutant and take over the world from the humans. All the turtles need to do is take down Superfly, get it on tape and then humans will love them. That should be easy right?\n\nI just want to say right off the bat that the animation in this film is spectacular. It looks like someone decided to draw a picture with crayons and then put it in motion. It makes the movie different than any other animated feature I've ever seen. To add to that, the four actors that play the turtles were a pleasant surprise. I thought each actor gave a different performance that made the characters unique. They flowed well with each other, and they really made you feel like these turtles are brothers. The action was spectacular and the comedy that was written in was great. I would think Seth Rogen would take some credit on that because he helped write and produce the film. I did enjoy the story, but it is a story I have seen many times in other movies. .\n\nOverall, this film is a funny, action packed, heartfelt ride that families with children from 4 and on should see. I found myself acting like I was a little kid again while watching, remembering the old cartoon series and live action films. It was a satisfying experience that left me wanting to see more.\n\nRating: 4.5 out 5"
