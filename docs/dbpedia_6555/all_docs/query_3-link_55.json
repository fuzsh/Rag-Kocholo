        "text": "The Montagnard Uprising of 1964, was a complex event with the potential to alter the course of the Vietnam War. The one constant during this political and military maelstrom was the efforts of Special Forces soldiers, noncommissioned officers and officers, that defused the situation. The eight-day Montagnard uprising was just a “blink of an eye” in the fifteen years of American involvement in Vietnam, but had a lasting impact. This event will be explained from the perspective of a single Special Forces team.\n\nAmerican Special Forces (SF) teams built a close relationship with the Montagnards in the Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) program in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Suddenly, on Sunday, 20 September 1964, the American soldiers were jolted into a new reality when the friendly “Yards” revolted against the Vietnamese government. The U.S. Special Forces soldiers watched in horror as their trusted allies killed or imprisoned their Vietnamese Special Forces “commanders” and other Vietnamese present in four CIDG camps. In some camps, the Montagnards imprisoned the American SF teams. However, in one camp, Buon Brieng, the teamwork, quick response, and resourceful actions of one A-Team prevented a takeover; the Americans remained in control, and ultimately defused the uprising.\n\n“Yard” is an abbreviation of Montagnard. It is a term of endearment used by the Special Forces soldiers who worked with the Montagnards in Vietnam. The CIDG units were called “Strike Forces.” The Montagnard soldiers were referred to as “strikers” by the SF advisors.\n\nThis article features Special Forces Team A-312, 1st Special Forces Group (1st SFG), based in Okinawa, Japan. Sent to train, advise, and lead Montagnard irregular soldiers against the Viet Cong in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam, A-312’s experience typified that of many other SF teams in Vietnam in 1964. Although this article centers on Team A-312, it also encapsulates the early role of SF in the CIDG program in Vietnam.\n\nIn the Central Highlands, the Special Forces and CIDG fought two groups, the Viet Cong (VC) and the Viet Montagnard Cong (VMC). The VC were ethnic Vietnamese who traced their lineage to the Viet Minh, the communist movement that fought the Japanese and then the French for Indochinese independence. The VMC were ethnic Montagnards who worked with VC units in the region. While the Viet Cong had pressed many Montagnards into service, others were trained as a political cadre by the communists to organize the Montagnards to fight against the Vietnamese government. Their targets in the Central Highlands were the American-supported CIDG camps.\n\nThe scope and level of American involvement in Vietnam would change from 1960 to 1965, moving from an advisory role to the deployment of major conventional forces after 1965. Prior to 1965, Special Forces A Teams established camps and trained primarily Montagnard tribesmen (as well as Nung, Cambodian, and Vietnamese) as part of the Civilian Irregular Defense Group program. The CIDG units formed a counterguerilla force to fight the Viet Cong. From 1961 to 1964, teams from the 1st and 7th SFGs (from Okinawa and Fort Bragg respectively) rotated in six-month temporary duty (TDY) tours in Vietnam.\n\nFive CIDG camps surrounded Ban Me Thuot. They were organized as light infantry battalions. Depending on recruitment, the Strike Force battalions varied in strength. Buon Brieng had the largest force, with five companies. The other four camps had between three and four companies. Each Strike Force company was organized as a light infantry company with a small headquarters and four platoons of thirty Montagnards armed with surplus World War II weapons. American Special Forces teams advised the CIDG units in conjunction with their Vietnamese SF counterparts.\n\nIn September, Team A-312 was over halfway through its six-month TDY tour in Vietnam that had begun in June 1964. “Typical” of many Special Forces A Teams in Vietnam, A-312 recruited, trained, led into combat, and suffered casualties with their Montagnard irregulars. Aggressive patrolling led to the team’s first casualty. On 23 July 1964, Specialist Fourth Class George Underwood, the junior medic, was killed in a VC battalion-sized ambush while leading a resupply convoy back from Ban Me Thuot. Specialist Fifth Class Ricardo Davis was his replacement from Okinawa. “In the Rhade tribe, men’s names began with a ‘Y.’ Since Davis arrived with a buzz cut or ‘burr’ haircut, someone nicknamed him ‘Y-Burr,’” said Sergeant Lowell Stevens. It stuck for several years. When Sergeant First Class Billy Akers was transferred to B-52 Delta, a classified reconnaissance project, Sergeant First Class Billy Ingram became the medical sergeant. The team continued to execute their mission while incorporating the new members.\n\nA-312 built a strong rapport with the CIDG and the Vietnamese Special Forces. The newly appointed Montagnard battalion commander, Y Jhon Nie, was a product of two worlds; his father was French and his mother Montagnard. His mother had raised him as a Montagnard before being sent to a Catholic boarding school. There he learned French and English. After completing school, he returned to the Montagnards because he was still discriminated against by the lowland Vietnamese. He joined the CIDG and rose rapidly through the ranks as a combat leader. When A-312 arrived at Buon Brieng, in June 1964, he was Sergeant Earl Bleacher’s 3rd Company commander. Y Jhon soon rose to be the battalion commander.\n\nAfter three months, the SF of A-312 had bonded closely with their Yards. Buon Brieng was exceptional. The relationship between the Vietnamese and Montagnards was good. That was the case until “leading up to the uprising there was something going on, but we couldn’t put our finger on it. The Montagnards were edgy,” said SGT Bleacher. “Several [of the Montagnards] had asked us the question, ‘If the Vietnamese fought the Montagnards who would you side with?’” Team commander, Captain Vernon Gillespie, radioed his concerns to the SF B Team in Pleiku and to SF Headquarters in Nha Trang. The issue was significant enough that he followed the radio messages with coordination visits to Nha Trang and Saigon. However, the Americans had no solid intelligence, “it was just a shadow,“ Gillespie remembered. That shadow soon emerged from the darkness on 19 September 1964.\n\nOn 18 September 1964, A-312 received a surprise guest. Howard Sochurek, a World War II combat photographer and career journalist, came to research the Montagnard tribes and write an article for National Geographic magazine. Sochurek proved to be lucky. He was the only American journalist in the area when the uprising started. The first thing the Vietnamese government and Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) did was to restrict all movement into the area, thus keeping the press out. His exclusive story was featured in the January 1965 issue of National Geographic. Sochurek was there when it erupted.\n\nCPT Gillespie was well respected by the 1st SFG soldiers. He was an experienced leader who demanded excellence from his team. At the same time, he expected the NCOs to do their jobs and fully supported them. His standards were clearly articulated to the Americans and Montagnards. The Yards (who were considered simple hill people by the Vietnamese) were keen observers of leadership. The Americans, led by Gillespie, set the example; the Montagnards emulated the Special Forces.\n\nThe first official notice of a potential problem that CPT Gillespie received was a radio message on Saturday afternoon (1310 hours), 19 September 1964. The B Team in Pleiku alerted teams throughout the area that there could be Montagnard demonstrations on either the 19th or 20th. The reason for the demonstrations was to show support for an autonomous Montagnard state. They were expected to be peaceful. As soon as he received the warning, Gillespie spoke with Y Jhon, his Montagnard Strike Force battalion commander. Y Jhon assured Gillespie that there would not be a problem at Buon Brieng.\n\nThroughout his military career, Gillespie had been taught to think ahead and plan contingencies for the “what ifs” that might happen during operations. The entire team embraced this philosophy, whether planning for a weapons range or a combat patrol. Throughout the uprising period, the Americans in Buon Brieng were thinking and acting faster than the Montagnards as well as American decision-makers in Nha Trang and Saigon. The A-312 SF soldiers not only had the “ground truth,” but they also dealt with the Montagnards on a day-to-day basis. Based on the experience and the recommendations of his NCOs, CPT Gillespie knew that if the team controlled the ammunition, denied the Montagnards the use of the vehicles, and protected the Vietnamese Special Forces, it could maintain control of the camp. Gillespie thought out these priorities mentally on Saturday night before he went to bed. As a precaution, he ordered the two on-going patrols back into camp.\n\nThe team members on one CIDG patrol were surprised by the recall message. Sergeant Ron Wingo remembered, “I was on a company-sized operation with First Lieutenant [John T.] Horn and received a message [from Gillespie] to return to camp immediately. I did not understand this, but did not question or ask why. We walked most of the night and arrived at camp in the early morning [20 September].“ The Americans on the other patrol had a different experience, never getting the message to return.\n\nSergeants Lowell Stevens and Burhl Cunningham were leading the second patrol. Stevens noticed the Montagnards had been talking on the radio more than normal. The men also seemed uneasy. Suddenly, the patrol stopped moving. After a short, yet intense, communal discussion, the Montagnard strikers turned around and started back to camp. They ignored the protests of the Americans. Stevens and Cunningham tried to explain the predicament to Buon Brieng. Their radio calls went unanswered. The Americans were forced to either follow the Montagnards or stay alone in enemy territory.\n\nOn the way back to camp, the two Americans “heard a large amount of gunfire, grenades, and mortars in the distance off to the west. “It sounded like either a firefight or a firepower demonstration by the Viet Cong,” said Stevens. “I was certain they were staging to attack the camp.” After a rapid foot march, the patrol reached Buon Brieng in the afternoon. “When we arrived at the camp, we didn’t know what to expect,” said Stevens. “Nothing was really out of place, but then I noticed the flag was not the South Vietnamese one. It was something else.” It turned out to be the FULRO confederation flag, a symbol of the Montagnard uprising.\n\nSunday was usually a relaxed day in the camp. The first patrol had just returned and Gillespie was getting a haircut when he received an urgent message from the B Team alerting him to problems at the other CIDG camps. “At 0830 hours [20 September], I called Captain Truong, the Lá»±c LÆ°á»£ng Äáº·c Biá»t (LLDB), Vietnamese Special Forces commander, and Y Jhon [Y Jhon Nie], the CIDG battalion commander, into the team house. I informed them that for the time being and until further notice, I was taking command of all forces at Buon Brieng. A Montagnard revolt had started. [I told] Y Jhon, ‘Do not move against the Vietnamese here. They are under my protection. To kill them, you’ll have to kill me first,’” said Gillespie. The Montagnards knew that Gillespie was a man of his word and that the other Americans would follow him unquestioningly.\n\nAfterward, CPT Gillespie assembled A-312 in the team house. “He informed us that under no circumstances would we be disarmed and [that we] would fight if any attempt [were] made to take our weapons. The Vietnamese SF would not be harmed and we would protect them at any cost,” said SGT Wingo. “We gathered all the ammo we could carry and went to our respective duty stations.” The acting team sergeant, Sergeant First Class Gene Bell, gathered the Vietnamese LLDB and brought them inside the SF team house. The potential for VC sympathizers in the Strike Force was another concern.\n\nGillespie told Y Jhon, the battalion commander, “There were some of the Strike Force I was suspicious of. So I told Y Jhon to bring his family to a building in the U.S. perimeter with six trusted strikers to protect the family.” Once his family was safe, Y Jhon announced that there would be a ritual sacrifice at 10 a.m. Both Gillespie and CPT Truong would participate as his guests of honor. In times of crisis, the Montagnards referred back to their traditional ways.\n\nTo get rid of “bad spirits,” a sacrifice had to be made by the Montagnards. Animal sacrifice was a significant part of their religion and culture. Animals from chickens to water buffalo were killed, depending on how serious the problem was deemed. Part of the ritual included drinking Montagnard rice wine, Nhom Pae.\n\n“Montagnard women would chew the rice for a while and spit the mixture of rice and saliva into large ceramic jugs,” said Stevens. “The saliva was a fermenting agent for the wine.” The number of jars of Nhom Pae measured the importance of the ceremony; seven jars were the highest level. The entire Montagnard camp participated. The ceremony for Y Jhon, CPT Truong, and CPT Gillespie merited seven jars of Nhom Pae and the sacrifice of a water buffalo, plus other animals (a pig and several chickens). It was extremely significant in the eyes of the Montagnards. Howard Sochurek, the photo journalist who had come to the camp to document Montagnard culture, was permitted a rare opportunity to view a ceremony.\n\nIn the meantime, with the word of the uprising still in its early stages in other camps, the NCOs of A-312 moved into action. “Captain Gillespie told me to disable all vehicles in the motor pool,” recalled Wingo. “We had five or six 2Â½-ton trucks and three Â¾-ton vehicles and a couple of jeeps.” “I knew that we might need them again, so I simply removed the carburetor jets.” One Â¾-ton with a .30 caliber machinegun was left in operation just in case the team needed to escape. His work on the vehicles done, Wingo went back to the radio room. “There was a frenzy of activity in the radio room. Y Jhon Nie was talking at great length with the other camp leaders on the TR-20 radio. It got very heated at times. I couldn’t understand what was being said, but it was very intense,” remembered Wingo.\n\nThe other FULRO Montagnard leaders wanted the Buon Brieng force to join the attack on Ban Me Thuot and block Route 14, to stop the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) reaction forces from Pleiku. Y Jhon refused to join the Montagnard uprising. “Y Jhon spoke fairly good English and was briefing Captain Gillespie on the situation and what [was happening in] the other camps. It appeared to me that the bulk of the troops [in Buon Brieng] seemed somewhat confused,” said Wingo. The camp’s link to the outside world was the communications center (or “commo bunker”). The two communications sergeants, Wingo and Bell, were helped by SGT Bleacher because Bell, the senior radioman, was the acting team sergeant. “The radio traffic was heavy. The B and C Detachments wanted regular sitreps [situation reports],” remembered Wingo.\n\nFrom the radio, the A-312 soldiers learned that everything was not going as well at other camps. They heard from the Bu Prang sitrep that the Montagnards had killed the LLDB and other Vietnamese in camp. “It got a little scary when you realize that twelve of you are in the middle of a battalion of anxious and nervous CIDG, who were armed to the teeth. One mistake or unintentional act could have had some serious consequences,” recalled SGT Wingo. “I feel that Captain Gillespie’s positive leadership and the team’s good rapport and trust with the troops had an effect in calming the situation.” By then the second patrol had returned to Buon Brieng.\n\nAfter from his patrol, SGT Stevens went to the team house. “I had a good meal and drank a Ba Moui Ba 33 beer. As I sat there, I began to get angry at the VC sitting out there waiting to attack,” said Stevens. As he had done almost every night in camp, Stevens decided to fire the mortar, but with a twist. “The VC were out of range, or so they thought. The 81mm mortar has a maximum charge 9 (which is a range of 4737 meters). I estimated where the VC were and added an extra charge (charge 10) to the mortar and set it at 800 mils (45 degrees) to put it past the maximum range.” Then, Stevens went to the mortar pit to prepare about thirty WP [white phosphorous] and HE [high explosive] rounds, with the “extra charge.” The Montagnards, probably used to seeing Stevens in the mortar pit, seemed oblivious of him. “I began to drop the rounds as fast as I could. When I was finished with the fire mission, I looked up and surrounding the mortar pit were ten or fifteen of the Yards with M-3 submachineguns pointed at me. One said ‘Fini sir, no more mortars.’ I swear the .45 caliber bore of those grease guns looked larger than an eight-inch howitzer,” remembered Stevens. Discretion being the better part of valor, he returned to the team house and did not go into the mortar pit for four days. “Later, the Montagnards told me that I did hit the VC assembly area and caused some casualties. I was convinced the VC were massing for an attack while the Yards were preoccupied with the uprising.”\n\nOn 21 September (Day 2), the CIDG at Buon Brieng made no attempt to start the vehicles and the camp remained quiet. Still, the strikers remained alert with weapons ready. Y Jhon was getting pressure from the FULRO leadership to move south to Ban Me Thuot. Y Jhon responded by holding a battalion formation. He explained the situation to the assembled troops. “He received a hundred percent vote of confidence from the Strike Force. Following this, Captain Truong and I talked to the Strike Force and explained our respective positions. We received the same vote of confidence,” said Gillespie.\n\nThe strikers prepared to defend the camp against a Vietnamese Army attack. “The Montagnards were prepared to stand their ground and moved all of the ammunition out of the ammo bunkerâmortar and small armsâand positioned it around the perimeter,” said SGT Wingo. Ambushes/observation posts were set up on the camp road from Route 14. “Things were very uneasy that night. We expected to see South Vietnamese Army tanks in the morning. As I remember, no one slept that night,” said Wingo. It was anticipated that the ARVN would attack the camps to put down the uprising.\n\nThis was confirmed the next morning (Day 3) when the Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF) buzzed the camp. The first plane dropped leaflets instructing the Americans to take cover in the bunkers. Soon after the leaflet drop, a flight of VNAF planes with loaded bomb racks “buzzed” Buon Brieng a few times. The U.S. response was to wave their t-shirts while standing on the team house roof. They hoped that the pilots would see the American Special Forces and not bomb or strafe the camp. “We were sure that the Vietnamese would be merciless against the Montagnards. They would not hesitate to bomb the women and children in camp,” said Stevens. The CIDG did not fire at them and the aircraft did not attack. Further to the south, the various factions were feverishly seeking a peaceful solution.\n\nCaught in the middle, World War II and Korean War veteran, Major Frederick C. Patton, became one of the negotiators. Patton had arrived in Vietnam with SF Detachments B-110 and A-111 from 1st Special Forces Group in Okinawa to develop a Vietnamese-led reconnaissance unit. The mission was cancelled because of LLDB infighting. Patton became the Special Forces coordinator at Ban Me Thuot responsible for the five SF teams in the surrounding area. Patton had traveled to all camps and met all of the Montagnard, LLDB, and ARVN commanders. During his command visits in July 1964, Patton had encountered a Montagnard commander being rebuffed by the U.S. 8th Field Hospital staff. He was merely trying to visit his wounded soldiers.\n\nMajor Patton was in Nha Trang when he happened upon the upset CIDG battalion commander from Bon Sar Pa. Y Mot had come to Nha Trang to visit his soldiers who had been wounded in a major ambush. When the two entered the hospital ward where the wounded Montagnards were convalescing, Patton was impressed. Wounded strikers, some with amputations, got out of their beds when Y Mot entered. It was an obvious sign of high respect. Y Mot was concerned that the Americans would not properly care for his soldiers. They would not have been given appropriate treatment in an ARVN hospital. After the emotional visit, Patton arranged for a UH-1 “Huey” to fly Y Mot back to Bon Sar Pa in style. This personal compassion and soldierly respect would pay dividends during the uprising.\n\nThe five Americans and Y Jhon accompanied the rebel platoon. The striker platoon bypassed Ban Me Thuot, turning southwest on Route 14. They stopped at the FULRO command post in the village of Buon M’Bre (five miles southwest of Ban Me Thuot). One of the key FULRO leaders at that time was Y Mot, the Bon Sar Pa battalion commander. Based on their previous meeting and his mutual respect for Y Mot, Patton was able to open negotiations with the leadership.\n\nThe environment that MAJ Patton and CPT Gillespie entered was tense and hostile. There was an openly anti-American element led by a Cham (a Cambodian Montagnard) [identified in Howard Sochurek’s photographs as wearing a checkered scarf]. Gillespie confirmed that the faction led by the Cham, a Montagnard named Y Wat, and the Bon Sar Pa interpreter, Y Clur, were the “hot-heads.” Another group controlled by Y Mot was reasonable. A heated discussion began. The Montagnards insisted that the uprising was only against the Vietnamese, not with the United States nor the Special Forces. It was obvious that they did not appreciate the American intervention.\n\nIn the middle of the discussions, a 2Â½-ton truck came into the village filled with captured Vietnamese soldiers. “I felt it was necessary to show in some small way that these men were under the protection of the U.S. to keep them from being killed,” said Gillespie. As the Montagnards watched in disbelief, Gillespie, Y Jhon, and Patton cut the bonds on the Vietnamese prisoners. “This act seemed to have an effect as no further move was made against the Vietnamese,” wrote Gillespie. The Vietnamese were still prisoners, but at least they weren’t tied up. The Americans established themselves by changing the rules. Since the Montagnard leadership was split, MAJ Patton, CPT Gillespie, and Y Jhon elected to stay in the village overnight. This did not please the “hot head” faction. After a small meal, the Americans and Y Jhon went to sleep to get a fresh start in the morning.\n\nThough they resumed negotiations early the next day, Patton and Gillespie “faced a stone wall of resistance to moving back to Bon Sar Pa.” At 0730, Patton and Gillespie announced that if they did not move back to Bon Sar Pa by 0830, the two American SF officers would leave “and with us would go any hope of future Special Forces support.” This spurred a lot of discussion among the Montagnard leaders, but no movement. For the Americans, the negotiations had ended. As Patton and Gillespie prepared to leave, the negotiations took a new direction.\n\nAn outsider to the CIDG, Colonel John T. “Fritz” Freund, the deputy senior advisor to the ARVN II Corps, showed up in Buon M’Bre. He stepped into the middle of negotiations trying to help. But his lack of experience with the Montagnards’ situation quickly became evident to the SF soldiers. Freund spoke fluent, cultured Parisian French and assumed that because the senior leaders in the Vietnamese army spoke that language, all others did as well. Freund immediately demanded in French to speak to the leader. The rebels provided a proxy because they didn’t know the American colonel. An older Montagnard was produced. Freund demanded food and sat down to eat with the elderly Montagnard who understood a little French. Freund talked with the older gentleman for almost an hour, and then triumphantly announced to the Americans that an agreement had been reached. The Montagnard leaders were glad that Freund was leaving for Ban Me Thuot to radio MACV headquarters. The elder Montagnard was relieved. He only spoke a few words of French and spent the most time saying “Oui, mon Colonel,” and nodding passively in agreement to whatever the American had been saying.\n\nIt was unclear if the Montagnard uprising of 1964 was an armed political demonstration, a mutiny against the ARVN and South Vietnamese government, or a Communist attempt to promulgate reprisals that would cause the Montagnards to align with the Viet Cong. Some Montagnards regarded the uprising as a political demonstration, like earlier ones done in Saigon. The uprising was planned to last eight days. It did that. The uprising did force the Vietnamese government to grant some political concessions to the Montagnards, such as property ownership and political representation.\n\nOne thing is certain, A-312, led by Captain Vernon Gillespie, made it known that the Montagnard Uprising at Buon Brieng was “nipped in the bud” by a team effort. They would not have succeeded without the complete professionalism of everyone on the team. Gillespie refused to endorse the “official” report because of what he felt were discrepancies. In his own after action report Gillespie emphasized, “the total effort at Buon Brieng never has been a one-man show, but was a team effort … I assure you it would read quite different[ly] if I had not had the complete support of every member of this detachment.” When A-312 found itself in the center of the September 1964 Montagnard uprising, it was the only team not disarmed by rebelling Montagnards. The decisive actions of CPT Gillespie and his team effectively stopped the uprising in its tracks.\n\nAuthor’s Note: This article is not meant to “gloss over” the accomplishments of the other A Teams and SF soldiers during the uprising. While the focus of the article is about A-312, two other events contributed to defusing the Montagnard uprising. The missing trucks at Bu Prang stopped the rapid movement of that force to Ban Me Thuot. The efforts of A-752, led by Captain Richard Terry caused the Ban Don Strike Force to return to camp.\n\nThe author wishes to thank Lowell Stevens, Earl Bleacher, Ronald Wingo, Vernon Gillespie, and Steve Sherman for their help with this article.
