The county or municipality must notify the registered owner of the property by certified mail within seventy-two hours of the confiscation. Upon notice, the registered owner has ten days to request a hearing before the presiding judge of the judicial circuit or his designated hearing officer. The forfeiture hearing must be held within ten days from the date of receipt of the request. The property confiscated must be returned to the registered owner unless the Forestry Commission, a county, or a municipality can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property seized was knowingly used in the commission of the crime.

The county or municipality in possession of the property must provide notice by certified mail of the confiscation to all lienholders of record within ten days of the confiscation.\n\n(C) Upon conviction of a person owning and using the seized property or upon his plea of nolo contendre to an offense subjecting the property to forfeiture, the county or municipality where the offense occurred or the Forestry Commission may initiate an action in the circuit court of the county in which the property was seized to accomplish forfeiture by giving notice to registered owners of record, lienholders of record, and other persons claiming an interest in the property subject to forfeiture and by giving these persons notice and an opportunity to appear and show cause why the property should not be forfeited and disposed of as provided in this section. Failure of a person claiming an interest in the property to appear at this proceeding after having been given notice constitutes a waiver of the claim. However, the failure to appear does not affect the claim of a lienholder of record. The court, after hearing, may order the property forfeited to the county or municipality and sold as provided in this section or returned to the owner or registered owner.
