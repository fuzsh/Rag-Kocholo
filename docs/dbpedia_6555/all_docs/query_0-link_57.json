        "text": "Early life\n\nJason Statham was born on July 26, 1967, in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, England. He is the second son of dancer Eileen (née Yates) Statham and Barry Statham, a street vendor who sold inexpensive items, including jewelry. Between shifts helping his father at market stalls, Statham discovered a love for Chinese martial arts, football (soccer), and, most notably, diving. In 1985 he began attending the British National Diving School, and that same year he competed in the Olympic trials for the 1988 Games in Seoul. Although he did not make the cut, Statham participated in other international competitions, including the 1990 Commonwealth Games. After failing to make the national team for the 1996 Atlanta Games, Statham left the sport.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Statham was recruited to model for several apparel brands, including Tommy Hilfiger and Levi’s. He made his movie debut in 1998, appearing as the con man Bacon in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. The crime comedy, which was director Guy Ritchie’s first feature film, earned widespread praise. It also marked the start of a productive—and lucrative—director-actor friendship. Statham was later cast in Ritchie’s second film, Snatch (2000), which also featured Brad Pitt. Both films were commercial hits, and they helped catapult Statham to stardom.\n\nActing career\n\nIn 2002 Statham assumed the title role in The Transporter, about a former special forces soldier who delivers items for criminals. The movie was a box-office success, and two sequels (2005 and 2008) followed. During this time, Statham also starred in The Italian Job (2003), a heist dramedy that featured Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron, and Crank (2006), in which he was cast as an assassin; he reprised the latter role in Crank: High Voltage (2009). He shifted gears with War (2007), playing an FBI agent searching for a contract killer (Jet Li). Also popular was The Bank Job (2008). In addition, Statham had a supporting role in Michael Mann’s Collateral (2004), in which Tom Cruise portrayed a hit man.\n\nIn 2010 Statham appeared in The Expendables, joining an all-star cast that included Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Li. The action drama, which centers on mercenaries, was a huge hit, and Statham later acted in the three sequels (2012, 2014, and 2023). He also starred as hit man Arthur Bishop in The Mechanic (2011) and Mechanic: Resurrection (2016).\n\nIn 2013 Statham joined the cast of the popular Fast and Furious series, playing Deckard Shaw, a former MI6 agent. The character was introduced in Fast & Furious 6 (2013) and then appeared in Furious 7 (2015), The Fate of the Furious (2017), F9: The Fast Saga (2021), and Fast X (2023). Statham also starred with Dwayne Johnson in the spin-off film Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019). In this and numerous other movies, Statham did many of his own stunts, and he has advocated for creating an Academy Award category dedicated to stunt performers.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In 2018 he paid tribute to his diving days, starring in The Meg, a sci-fi horror film about a submarine crew attacked by a monstrous prehistoric shark. He also appeared in the sequel, Meg 2: The Trench (2023). In 2021 Statham reunited with Guy Ritchie for Wrath of Man, portraying an armored-truck driver with a mysterious past. The director and actor also teamed up for the action comedy Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre (2023), about the hunt to find a stolen briefcase."
