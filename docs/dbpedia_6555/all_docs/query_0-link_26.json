Thanks for some brain scratching! Here is my list:\n\nMud, Winter's Bone, Nomadland (I was somewhat bored by it), 3 billboards outside Ebbing Missouri (really liked it), No country for the old men (fantastic) and many other western movies all of which I consider rural American e.g. Unforgiven, Hell or high water, and Tombstone. True Detective Season 1 has a terrific rural setting too but not a movie.\n\nLast edited by amol4184 : 26th July 2024 at 00:03.

Starts on a great high, and then a surprise! Hugh Jackman also balances the duo scenes well. Ryan's initial burss of comic lines were sharp and had me in splits. The villian was great as well. Few scenes, in between, bored me and put me to sleep - but I was also tired having put in an 'all-nighter', so I give it the 'benefit of doubt'. Do let us know how you find it. Maybe not as brilliant as the first, but still watchable. Besides, what other content is out there, (so its worth a watch)\n\nAttached Thumbnails\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2010\n\nLocation: Bengaluru\n\nPosts: 204\n\nThanked: 3,204 Times\n\nRe: The English Movies Thread (No Spoilers Please)\n\nTwisters | In theatres | 4/5\n\nJust like the original Twister movie (1996), this one also delivers loads of fun and a great adrenaline rush. The elements of the original are all there - scientists needing to put science-sounding thingies into the crux of tornadoes, cars and cows flying around, fantastic Oklahoma landscapes, American rural life (rodeos, and single screen theatres!!), superb driving skills, and some chemistry between the lead characters.\n\nNotably, the soundtrack has some beautiful country songs which add to the ambience of American countryside. The acting from the lead actors is adequate, nothing remarkable.\n\nFinally, well-made disaster movies are best watched in theatres .\n\nLast edited by DigitalOne : 27th July 2024 at 22:16.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2009\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 1,821\n\nThanked: 4,180 Times\n\nRe: The English Movies Thread (No Spoilers Please)\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\n\nAmazon prime. 1/5.\n\nNo offence, but is someone else “Ghost directing” movies under the Guy Ritchie name these days?\n\nThere are some iconic Guy Ritchie movies—Snatch, Lock stock and two smoking barrels, RocknRolla and then some okayish ones like the Sherlock Home series, The Gentlemen etc. And then some movies where the movie itself is not bad, but its not the typical Guy Ritchie style, like the Wrath of Man and The Covenant.\n\nLastly there are some really bad movies which have many known actors playing characters that lack depth, the whole movie seems shallow, like Operation Fortune. Sadly, this movie, the ministry of ungentlemanly warfare falls in the same category too. The movie lacks depth, everything feels like it’s happening in a film set, very artificial and the actors are quite bad. Hollywood is losing it! I can sense the lack of imagination from even the most acclaimed directors! Its like lets make anything, pull the crowd with some top billing and hopefully make some guaranteed money owing to the directors / actors associated.\n\nLast edited by motorworks : 28th July 2024 at 20:47.\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2011\n\nLocation: Bengaluru\n\nPosts: 3,532\n\nThanked: 11,387 Times\n\nRe: The English Movies Thread (No Spoilers Please)\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine- 3.5/5\n\nWas having a bad day today. So thought of trying something to relax and booked tickets for Deadpool & Wolverine tickets at the minute. Must say it was a laugh riot even though the story was weak like the recent MCU ones. Wife hadn’t watched any of the previous Deadpool movies but she loved this one too. Walked out with a light mind after the movie and that was worth it.\n\nWatch it for Deadpool and wolverine only. And don’t take kids along.\n\nPS: the hall was full baring a couple of seats. After the movie was over and the credits started rolling, less than 5% of the crowd walked out. Rest 95% of us just kept waiting for any Easter eggs. More like 5 mins later, the credit was still rolling and everyone kept waiting patiently. Well, there was something in the end\n\nLast edited by ashis89 : 28th July 2024 at 21:43.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2021\n\nLocation: Mumbai\n\nPosts: 144\n\nThanked: 717 Times\n\nRe: The English Movies Thread (No Spoilers Please)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by NoLurkerForLong\n\nAny recommendations on movies set in rural America?\n\nA few of the movies I liked are\n\n- Nebraska\n\n- Frozen River\n\n- Brokeback Mountain\n\nPlease add your suggestions.\n\nIf you liked Nebraska, youll love The Straight Story. David Lynch directs and Richard Farnsworth really should have gotten an Oscar for this.\n\nThere is a bizarre little gem called The Peanut Butter Falcon - wonderfully heartwarming, and Shea Lebouf shows just how good he can be when he wants to.\n\nMight be a bit hard to find but there is a brilliant movie, sad and sweet, called: Gas, food, lodging\n\nIts not really rural like Nebraska, but Hugh Jackmans Real Steel has lovely rural America scenery.\n\nHostiles , starring Christian Bale is a gem of a movie. Was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theatre.\n\nNot a movie but all of Yellowstone\n\nKodachrome.\n\nA river runs through it, The Horse Whisperer, The Legend of Bagger Vance - basically most early Robert Redford directed ones were usually beautifully shot and set in the areas around his literally owned region of Sundance in Utah. I think these might also be the pace at which you like them(?)\n\nSlingblade, if you havent seen Billy Bob Thorntons greatest.\n\nAint them bodies saints.\n\nHell or high water."
