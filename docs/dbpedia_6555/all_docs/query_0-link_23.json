The character was not initially a well-known character outside of comic book fans until he appeared in Justice League Unlimited in the 2000s and season six of popular live-action series Smallville (played by Justin Hartley). David S. Goyer also attempted to get Green Arrow: Escape from Super Max into production as a film in the late 2000s.\n\nGreen Arrow made his debut on television as a guest star in an episode of the original Super Friends. He was portrayed by Norman Alden in the 1973 episode \"Gulliver's Gigantic Goof.\" He was described as a \"staunch Justice League of America member\" (JLA).\n\nSynopsis: In a universe as vast as it is mysterious, a small but powerful force has existed for centuries. Protectors of peace and justice, they are called the Green Lantern Corps. A brotherhood of warriors sworn to keep intergalactic order, each Green Lantern wears a ring that grants him superpowers. But when a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy the balance of power in the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth lie in the hands of their newest recruit, the first human ever selected: Hal Jordan. Hal is a gifted and cocky test pilot, but the Green Lanterns have little respect for humans, who have never harnessed the infinite powers of the ring before. But Hal is clearly the missing piece to the puzzle, and along with his determination and willpower, he has one thing no member of the Corps has ever had: humanity. With the encouragement of fellow pilot and childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), if Hal can quickly master his new powers and find the courage to overcome his fears, he may prove to be not only the key to defeating Parallax... he will become the greatest Green Lantern of all.\n\nRelease Date: June 17th, 2011\n\nDirector: Martin Campbell\n\nCast: Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett, Tim Robbins\n\nSynopsis: Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the cosmos, where brash adventurer Peter Quill finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain with ambitions that threaten the entire universe.

Cannon Films produced a live-action film \"Masters of the Universe,\" which featured Dolph Lundgren in the role of He-Man; it was a commercial failure. In this film Prince Adam was not seen at all; only He-Man was shown.

The film ended with a spectacular and violent clash with Skeletor, in which Skeletor was flung deep beneath Castle Grayskull into a pit filled with steaming liquid.

When Chris assumes the persona of Red Mist, the stage is set for a superhero showdown.\n\nRelease Date: 16 April 2010\n\nDirector: Matthew Vaughn\n\nCast: Aaron Johnson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Chloë Grace Moretz, Mark Strong, Nicolas Cage\n\nLobo is a fictional character that appears in the comic books published by DC Comics.
