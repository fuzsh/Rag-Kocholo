        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nIzuku woke to an especially chilly morning and a very handsy Kacchan. This wasn’t alarming. Katsuki, of course, hated the cold, and he had learned recently that he could use Izuku’s body to warm his cock up real nice.\n\nThe two were together on their sides; Katsuki’s hands were up Izuku’s sleepshirt and his morning wood was already nestled against his ass. Izuku, in a cottony half-awake headspace, was all too happy to melt into the touches. The big fluffy duvet was closely tucked over them, creating a little hideaway.\n\nKatsuki minutely rocked his clothed erection as his hands sought out and toyed with Izuku’s nipples. He kissed and nibbled at Izuku’s neck, getting languid tastes of the scent there. He didn’t even seem fully awake either; his body reaching for its fill of Izuku out of instinct. Izuku’s body flushed happily in response, his own cock twitching in interest.\n\nIt was in these early hours, the sky a violet dawn, that Kacchan’s intimate attention made Izuku feel the most wanted. When Katsuki was barely conscious, but still mumbled in his sleep-rough voice that he wanted his mundling omega. Wanted these clothes off his mate, he griped.\n\n“Mm, morning to you too, Kacchan,” Izuku murmured, amused and aroused and so in love.\n\nThat silly little nickname had the desired aphrodisiac effect. Katsuki shifted to roll on top of Izuku, caging his mate in with his arms - the duvet now tented over them by his body. He wore his usual squinty curse-mornings face, hair a cowlicked mess and all. But those eyes were a dark, aroused red, staring intently. Izuku smiled and took his mate’s face into his hands, pulled Kacchan down and kissed him. The two tilted their heads into it, and Izuku lazily let their tongues meet.\n\nThat kiss was all the permission that Katsuki needed to start ridding Izuku of the very rude clothes that kept him from being able to sink inside. Especially since the tented duvet was now letting in a bit of the cold. He grumbled at the shivering nip of that cold in between kisses, and grumbled all the more when Izuku laughed softly at him for it.\n\nThankfully getting Izuku naked and legs spread was easy enough. He made sure to stroke along his partner’s cock - and continue to kiss him senseless; deep, seeking kisses, that brought forth little whimpers - until the omega was all slick enough to prep.\n\nBut this was where the tricky part came in, and when Izuku started to fully wake up. It slowly dawned on him that they weren’t at home in the lovely secluded Oxford house. They were at the Bakugou residence. With both boys’ parents asleep on the same floor.\n\nAnd in the room immediately next door, was the mother who had just stormed a few days ago, determined to save Izuku from a man she was only now learning to trust.\n\nIzuku, unfortunately, remembered all this by the time Kacchan started to finger him.\n\nNow this wouldn’t be an awkward situation, if just because of the duvet. The covers of Katsuki’s bed were more than thick enough to cover up any tell-tale wet sounds, and keep their intermingled sex scents deliciously enclosed. That, and Katsuki’s bed was no cheap piece; it wouldn’t creak and groan once they got going.\n\nNo, a little hushed sex shouldn’t be a problem at all. Except for one teensy tiny little problem:\n\nIzuku got loud when Kacchan fucked him.\n\nHe slapped a hand over his own mouth as soon as Katsuki’s fingers started to thrust and crook up inside him. The whimpered moans still threatened to spill out, throatier and louder in cadence than his little noises from the kisses. Oh, especially when Kacchan simultaneously toyed with his cock - thumbing at the head the same time his fingers brushed that pleasurable spot inside. Izuku’s body jolted at that, his high-pitched noise of pleasure only just-so muffled by his clamped mouth.\n\nHe and Katsuki both froze. They both instinctually perked their ears to listen for any movement, any sign of discovery. The house responded with a gentle groan from the wind outside, and the slightest impercitable sound of one of the parents shifting in bed. Then another settled minute followed, before Katsuki decided they were safe.\n\nHe frowned, upon discovering that the short moment of apprehension had tightened Izuku back up again. But he retracted back to a single finger to get the ball rolling again. And, deciding to be nice, he leaned down to resume their kiss - to help Izuku in his mission to stay all hushed up for once. He swallowed the needy moans and breathy ‘Kacchan’s, loving the way the vibrations of the praise felt on his tongue.\n\nIt didn’t take long until he was back to stretching Izuku beautifully open again. His cock throbbed in impatience to get inside, all the more tantalizing the closer the moment got. Izuku’s body always melted into a hot, trembling, pliable mess when he was ready to be fucked (and it always felt the best inside like that) - and he was almost there. By the continued twitches, the way his kisses were turning sloppy. But he wasn’t begging yet, wasn’t ready around three fingers yet. Just a little more -\n\nOne of the parents’ doors burst open. Footsteps padded out into the main hallway. The boys froze again. They listened with hearts in their throats, trying to figure out which parent was awake. The footsteps continued to the stairs, the descent marked by the usual wooden creaks. After several minutes, they caught the very distant sound of the kitchen backdoor, and the muffled exchange of Masaru greeting Darlene.\n\nNo other sounds followed from either mother.\n\nIzuku and Katsuki breathed out in relief.\n\nIt went unsaid how disastrous it would be if the baroness caught Katsuki doing illicit things to Izuku first thing in the morning. The sun wasn’t even up yet.\n\nSure, she had logically accepted that Izuku was happy in his marriage. Their reciprocated bites had gone a long way in convincing her to stick around. However, emotionally, Inko was no less skittish. Since the day that she had nearly stolen Izuku away, she never stopped regarding Katsuki with a distant politeness. If she directly interacted with him at all.\n\nHe didn’t blame her. He had outright admitted to causing her son to drop from negligence. Izuku had explained the situation, and had likely sugarcoated the worst of his mistakes early in the marriage. She had since seen the roses, seen the gentle way Katsuki interacted with Izuku now. She saw the way Izuku lit up when Katsuki entered the room. Even if Katsuki was going about with his usual scowl or ten-feet-tall ego, Izuku was happy in his presence.\n\nIt was obvious that Inko still didn’t entirely approve of what she saw - or, better said, she didn’t understand what she saw.\n\nIt was one hell of an adjustment for her, to say the least. For years, mother and son expected Izuku to go off and marry some nice girl. If they had to picture what such a girl would be like, they’d say she’d be cheery and sweet. Sociable enough to get Izuku out of his shell. She and Izuku would be a tooth-rotting adorable match, and would build a family just as agreeable.\n\nKacchan… was not that. The history of bullying aside and forgiven, he was still… well. Himself. In all that entailed.\n\nIzuku had the benefit of realizing Kacchan was it for him over the course of a few months. He couldn’t unsee it, now that he had accepted what his instincts wanted all along. Kacchan excited him, turned him on, brought out sides of himself that he loved, and made him feel safer in the messy parts of himself. He found a kindred soul in all his drive and ambitions. As happy as he would have been in a sweet, easygoing marriage to a pretty girl, he wasn’t sure if he’d ever feel this perfectly complete. Like Kacchan met him where he was: filling in his weaknesses, leaning on his strengths.\n\nInko, however, was still an exposed nerve; she hadn’t adjusted yet to this inexplicable reality.\n\nDreading that it was her door that opened, that she had walked out into the hallway, Izuku had tensed up again .\n\nKatsuki groaned quietly in frustration, but dutifully tried to resume. Except now that one parent was up, he could tell that Izuku’s attention was divided. Katsuki would start to get Izuku relaxed and feeling good again, then the omega would start to moan a bit louder, and then they’d tense up once more to listen for a damning parental reaction.\n\nHell, Katsuki's own attention was divided. Both of them could tell that Izuku’s body wasn’t responding right anymore. The moans had quieted down to little winces. Katsuki’s cock started deflating all the more at the lack of visible pleasure in his mate.\n\n“Ugh,” he eventually gave up, withdrawing his fingers. “Tis no use. Ter as tight now as a pair of trousers after a holiday feast.”\n\nHe wiped his hand on his own underdrawers and then flopped back down to his mate, resigning to grapple the covers back up tight around them. He curled around Izuku, trying to make himself as warm as he could get. He still shivered, because his body was being a little bitch.\n\n“Besides, tisn’t as fun when tha canna yell my name.”\n\nIzuku blushed red.\n\n“I'm sorry,” he still said, full of relief and disappointment. He reached down for Kacchan’s cock, upset that his mate didn't get to receive any pleasure at all, but Katsuki pushed his hand away.\n\n“Dunna apologize.” He tucked his glowering face into Izuku’s neck. He hadn’t entirely softened, but he was determined to ignore it.\n\n(Not that the proximity of his mate's scent ever helped.)\n\nIzuku couldn’t sit with that. He shifted in guilty discomfort, even as he reciprocated the cuddles.\n\n“But you haven't been able to… well… put it inside, since we were home.”\n\nWhich was close to a week ago.\n\nKatsuki’s immediate response was to snort. “Ah’ll fuckin’ live, ya mundling omega.”\n\nAfter all, he had spent years convinced that all his fantasies would never become reality. He wasn’t going to suffer and die if he had to go a few days without getting his dick wet. He wasn’t some pathetic slavering alpha.\n\nYet, marked by the way his cock still twitched with need, maybe he was.\n\nSince they had mated, the young couple hadn’t gone a day without some kind of sex - if not more than once in a day - and it usually was penetrative. Izuku was a refreshing spring to a man who had wandered for years in the desert. The golden roads of heaven that Katsuki didn’t think he would ever deserve to walk upon.\n\nYears of stomping down on his fantasies, and then more recently, weeks of quietly jerking himself off in his room when Izuku’s scent drifted down the hall. So determined not to reveal his arousal to the already skittish omega - and failing the first time Izuku took off the modesty ribbon in front of him. He thought he wrecked everything that day.\n\nThen, by some fantastic miracle, he hadn’t blown everything up. He got the unbelievable opposite: Izuku became his . All his! His husband, his mate, and slowly but surely, his best friend. Because Izuku wanted him.\n\nNow, the dam of desire burst open, he couldn’t stop grabbing for his mate at any and every opportunity. Couldn’t get enough of the scent, the touch, the addictive sounds. He woke up wanting to render Izuku blissed out and satiated, and didn’t want to go to sleep until he did. If he could, he'd bury his knot inside and stay there until Izuku was brimming with his seed. Not with the intent to pup Izuku up, but to leave a mark of himself along every inch, inside and out. He wanted to drown Izuku in his love and scent until his mate couldn’t go anywhere without everyone knowing that he belonged to someone. Until Izuku was always thinking of him.\n\nBecause Izuku was his .\n\nPathetic slavering alpha indeed.\n\n(He worried every time that he was taking advantage of Izuku - who just months ago wouldn’t even share a room with him out of fear of being assaulted - but then, every time, Izuku would receive him so beautifully and enthusiastically, and Katsuki would forget that worry for a moment.)\n\nThat changed when Inko showed up. The two rabbits didn't have any sex the first couple days after she arrived, and they certainly weren't having any sex now.\n\nKatsuki already felt her watching him every time he interacted with Izuku, and he was certain that she could tell. He was certain that she noticed the way he hovered and stared at Izuku. How must she feel to see such an ill-mannered punk keep her son like a dragon’s hoard? He barely felt like he could touch Izuku in front of her without further incriminating himself as just another possessive alpha. Who knew when they'd be able to steal the time and place to enjoy a good fuck without the fear of her overhearing.\n\n“Ah'm not goin’ t’ force it, idiot,” he said in response to Izuku’s concern about his pleasure. Selfless fuck, as always.\n\nBut for Izuku, he was only all the more in love - that Kacchan was so attentive to his needs and pleasure - and all the more disappointed. Still, there was little more that the two could do but settle deep within the covers to keep out the morning cold.\n\nThat was until breakfast was called, and Mitsuki banged on Katsuki’s door to “get up already!” Katsuki responded to that with the predictable amount of snark and reticence. He turned his growls on Izuku for laughing fondly, as usual.\n\n“We slept in late enough already, Kacchan,” he gently reminded his mate once they were dressed and ready.\n\n“Fuck off, ter not sufferin’ the way Ah am!” Katsuki had stuffed himself in his thickest jumper, looking like a turtle, the way he shrugged himself down in the high collar.\n\n“And how am I not suffering the same way?” Izuku only responded in amusement, as he followed Kacchan out the bedroom door.\n\n“Tha’nose nowt!” he continued to complain happily, convinced that he was singularly victimized by winter. “Ah’m pigged off!”\n\nHis mouth snapped shut at the sight of Inko also coming out of her room. Her mouth was already popped open in a soft scandalized reaction to Katsuki’s vulgarity. There was a slight paleness to her skin, as any lady of good breeding.\n\nInko had gotten ready so quietly that the two didn’t realize she was still there next door.\n\nHer reaction called back to Izuku’s mind that old argument Katsuki and his sire had, about his accent. Mitsuki had been, understandably, surprised that an aristocrat like Izuku was so unfazed. Yet just like the modern concept of reciprocated mating bites (paired with all of Izuku’s oddities), Inko’s generation was far less tolerant of someone with an accent like that existing in the same sphere of wealth as a baroness.\n\nInko, thankfully, was already more progressive than her peers. She swallowed her initial offense, likely inwardly chiding herself for her kneejerk reaction. To save face, both mother and son-in-law fixed themselves. Katsuki’s posture quieted, and Inko offered a smile to greet the couple good morning.\n\n“Good morning,” both boys greeted back.\n\nThough it was clear that she was reacting to this immediate event, and showed no sign of having heard Izuku and Katsuki’s earlier activities, Izuku found himself blushing.\n\n“Did you, um, sleep well, Mum?” he asked, trying to dissipate the tension.\n\n“Yes, thank you,” she replied, with no hint of a lie. The young couple breathed out a quiet relief that they hadn’t been heard after all. “Though, it is rather cold today, isn’t it?”\n\nKatsuki threw a subtle smirk at Izuku, validated.\n\nBreakfast was a generous display, as it had been since Izuku’s arrival. Every meal the Bakugous had served made it clear that they had the means to impress and spoil their important guests.\n\nThe dining room table was laden with a multitude of dishes - a decorated meat, poached eggs, pickled veggies; a tray of scones, surrounded by pretty jars of toppings; beautifully presented fruits; and of course, aromatic tea and coffee. Inko, who wasn’t used to eating this well on a regular basis, was flattered close to tears. She offered a trove of compliments with every dish sampled.\n\nGiven that Mitsuki had taken some time off from work to entertain her guest, the family was able to take their time with the first meal. It was a convivial time. No one sat behind a newspaper or was unaffected by the warm atmosphere. Even Katsuki could be cajoled to contribute.\n\nHere, in this cozy old house, the troubles of the world were forgotten. Conversation, for the sake of Inko’s gentle heart, flowed with happy and innocuous topics. Inko and Masaru talked about gardening most often. Katsuki was asked to talk about how school was going. Izuku was eager to supply that Kacchan had made new friends - much to Katsuki’s gruff embarrassment.\n\nAlways topics that brought everyone ease and laughter. Such a privilege of the wealthy to create a safe space to ignore the rest. Such a privilege they had a range of lighthearted topics to choose from.\n\nThe family was in the middle of such a happy breakfast when the world first niggled its way back into their awareness.\n\n“The post, Miss,” Darlene said, arriving to present Mitsuki with a tray of a few envelopes and an ornate letter opener.\n\n“Thank you,” the matriarch replied, taking the mail. She flipped through on first blush, and handed one to Katsuki. “This one is addressed to you - from a Mr. Kaminari of London. What do you know; Izuku was telling the truth! Katsuki, your new friend has already written to you!”\n\nKatsuki had to resist the urge to snatch the mail out of her hands, but he withheld his usual bite. He took the offered envelope, not nearly as bristled about Izuku perking up and leaning in to read alongside him.\n\nThe letter was a simple greeting - emphasis on simple [minded]. Denki wished to report that he was safely home for the holidays. He hoped Katsuki and Izuku also had safe travels, and didn’t drive himself off the road in a fit (“That little-” Katsuki had growled, but withheld further colorful language). The rest of the letter diverged to blabber about city trends. London, of course, was abuzz about-\n\n“Oh!” Mitsuki’s voice interrupted the reading. She was staring at the last envelope in the set. The table looked up at her as she tore the letter opener into the envelope and pulled out a pristine unfolded cardstock. It was bordered in an elegant gold laurel pattern, the central message written in professional calligraphy. She glanced over the particulars. “It’s an invitation from Lord Enji Todoroki - we’re invited to his New Years party again this year.”\n\n“How kind,” Masaru said, all politeness.\n\n“Quite,” Inko agreed.\n\n“Great,” Katsuki said, not withholding his sarcasm.\n\nIzuku frowned. “Lord Todoroki? The conservative MP?”\n\nMitsuki looked up at Izuku and promptly quirked a brow at his expression. “Are you not a fan?”\n\nIzuku blanched, sitting back in his seat. He didn’t mean to let his opinions show on his face like that, especially not about an acquaintance of the Bakugous.\n\nWorse yet, a political acquaintance.\n\nBut his mother-in-law was hooked onto his amusing, squished-face reaction. “Come, you can be honest.”\n\nHe swallowed, eyes darting between everyone. Masaru was sweet as usual, Katsuki was making deadpan grimaces at whatever Denki wrote to him, and Inko was only somewhat ruffled. After all, for years, Izuku had a more socially acceptable investment in current events than she did as an omega lady. He settled on taking Mitsuki’s bait, even as he could feel her reeling him in her own inexplicable glee. “I, well, regretfully cannot say that I’m an enthusiastic supporter of his.”\n\nShe laughed. “I can’t think of anyone who knows him who is enthusiastic about him.”\n\n“You’ll be responding to the RSVP anyways,” Katsuki grouched, not even looking up from his letter from Denki.\n\n“Of course.” She waved the cardstock, and then winked at Izuku. “Politics, you know.”\n\nHe worried at his lip, before catching himself and the unsettled face he was making.\n\nThis only amused his mother-in-law more. Both of her brows shot up. “Really? You have that strong of an opinion of him?”\n\nHe kept his mouth shut. Just because omegas had the right to vote, didn’t mean most people cared for the thoughts behind that vote. Worse yet, Lord Enji Todoroki was one of those politicians who inspired strong opinions in both directions. Sometimes those opinions were quite conflicted: some folks who loved his platform hated his attitude. It rarely presented vice versa. But if Izuku kept his mouth shut, then maybe he could pretend that he was mostly displeased with the man’s attitude, and partial to his politics.\n\nIf… that’s also where Mitsuki’s politics lied.\n\nOf course it was! He thought to himself. She runs a munitions factory!\n\nUnfortunately, he was a terrible liar and Mitsuki was astute. “Don’t tell me that you’re a pacifist! It would be quite ironic for my son to have married a pacifist!”\n\nHe winced. Pacifists were either the peaceful religious types, or the gentler sexes. “I… no, I can’t say that I’m a pacifist.”\n\n“No?”\n\nCompelled to disprove himself as a stereotype, he finally answered, “Well, I don’t support international disarmament. Not right now, at least, as an effective policy against what we’re facing. We need a Britain with strong defense capabilities, and even offensive capabilities if it comes to it - though I hope it doesn't. Though I don't think negotiations alone will deter invasion - of the Empire or our allies.”\n\nIt all came tumbling out that he caught himself belatedly stiffening once more, looking about.\n\nKatsuki was finally looking back up at him, with a touch of surprise that quickly vanished into a contemplative consideration. At least, his husband must have correctly surmised that he wasn’t the only one who had been reading the newspaper delivered to the Oxfordshire house. With little else to do during the day, of course Izuku had been keeping up with current events.\n\nMost folks were so exhausted by the idea of another great war that any other option sounded better. Pacifists wanted the members of the League of Nations to disarm. Government officials tried to play nice with the authoritarian across the channel. America still preferred its isolation. The rest of Europe wanted to dump the responsibility of defense onto Britain.\n\nYet Britain had disarmed, to a great degree, following the Great War. The Empire’s economy was still recovering from the Depression, its military spread thin over multiple conflicts in its colonies. Not only was the idea of another war largely unpopular, but Britain didn’t have the means to simply defend its own island.\n\nInko was a little more than ruffled now. She especially didn’t like talk of war. No one blamed her when she excused herself from the table; Masaru stood to accompany her back to the parlor.\n\nWhich left Izuku to nervously look back at Mitsuki - more easily singled out by her probing fascination.\n\n“Yet you’re put off by diehards like Lord Todoroki?” she surmised. She referred to a vocal minority who were eager proponents of warring with Germany. The kind of minority who, if they became popular opinion, would do very well for companies like Bakugou Co.\n\nSlowly, he nodded. “I understand and agree with the anti-fascist stance, absolutely - though I find it ironic coming from those who oppose other peoples' independence. Yet there are complications with rearming Britain so suddenly. For one, there’s the increased taxation, and secondly the Midland workforce hasn’t yet recovered its employment numbers.” He paused and blushed, before rushing out with, “Of course, what do I know? This is your business, the race to rearm Britain and all. I’m sure I know little of which I speak.”\n\nYet she nodded and smiled. “You seem to understand the complexities of the issue more than most. It’s been, oh I feel, over a year since I’ve heard a position that wasn’t solidly pacifist or solidly diehard.”\n\nHe took his turn considering her. The exasperation in her tone was clear, paired with her earlier comment on people’s ‘lack of enthusiasm’ with Lord Todoroki. Even if this was an acquaintanceship for profit, it wasn’t one that she was thrilled to keep. “Then why…”\n\n“Why associate myself with a hardliner like Lord Todoroki?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Well, I operate as an advisor of sorts. As you correctly stated, this is my business. I know the industry. I’ve dealt with the unemployment, the strikes, the wishy-washy government contracts. One moment they’re telling me to increase production, the next, the exchequer doesn’t have the budget.” She waved a hand at that too in annoyance. “Nonetheless - predictably, of course, to the benefit of my business; but also out of patriotism for my nation, I’d like to see Britain effectively rearmed. Which, of course, you can’t do if the government can’t make up its mind.”\n\nIzuku found himself leaning into the conversation. “So you advise on what the industry needs in order to meet the sudden demand?”\n\n“Precisely. We can’t afford to be indecisive right now. That talk lately, about uniting all German lands into one, with complete disregard to the sovereignty of Austria and who knows else… it gives me the shivers, to be honest. That’s not a man who can be negotiated with.”\n\nIzuku considered that too. “I… don’t know. Maybe negotiations are worth a chance? Not, of course, as the only tactic - we shouldn’t let Germany threaten the sovereignty of its neighbors. But… I mean, maybe if we had forgiven the Versaille debt…? The Germans wouldn’t have suffered financially to the point of electing fascists.”\n\nBoth Mitsuki and Katsuki’s eyes widened at that, and Izuku shrunk back once more. He knew what he suggested was radical, the second he suggested it. This was precisely why it took so long for omegas to win the vote, right? Their poor, maternal sensitivities just couldn’t handle the zero-sum game of politics. How dare he suggest that their enemy let a dictator rise to power for any reason other than inherent evil?\n\nYet once more, Mitsuki smiled. If anything, her posture relaxed all the more, as if Izuku had finally said something that she expected of him. “Not a pacifist, but you’re still an idealist, aren’t you?”\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\n“No, no, don’t apologize. It’s refreshing.” She sighed. “Maybe if we had more idealists in charge, we wouldn’t have gotten into this mess in the first place.”\n\nIzuku gave a short smile, but didn’t dare to voice one thought aloud: how else would she turn a profit? Yet he didn’t dare say something that might land wrong. He had pushed his luck enough.\n\nAfter the conversation, Mitsuki decided that she needed to unwind with a smoke.\n\nThe boys were left alone in the dining room. Out of newly developed habit, Izuku started picking up dishes to take back to the kitchen. Katsuki followed suit.\n\n“Kacchan,” Izuku said, as he set the plates down on the wing of the sink. His body slumped with the action, finally releasing the tension from breakfast. “Your mum scares me sometimes.”\n\nKatsuki snorted, putting down main dish plates on the kitchen island. “So does ter mum.”\n\nIzuku turned around to face his mate. “She doesn’t hate you.”\n\nThat wasn’t all that reassuring, and they both made faces.\n\n“At least the ol’ hag loves you,” Katsuki rightfully pointed out.\n\nIzuku looked down and rubbed his arm. “I’m just… still worried that I’m going to say or do something that will ruin her approval of me. That I’ll step too far, cross a line for my gender. Most of the time, I still have little idea where that line is - especially around your mum. Her expectations are… very confusing.”\n\n“Not really,” Katsuki stepped up to take Izuku into his arms. “If she wants summat, she’ll tell ya. If she dunna like thee, she makes it obvious. Pain in my arse.”\n\nIzuku only frowned all the more. This felt like one of those times that Kacchan heard him but didn’t understand. Katsuki’s world - his rights, his opportunities, his reputation - wasn’t overturned overnight by a raging storm of hormones. Living alone with Katsuki, joining the egalitarian Mr. Yagi for Saturday brunch, it was easy to believe that Izuku was just like every other man.\n\nBut the moment he stepped out of that sphere, he was reminded that he was expected to be docile and submissive. Mitsuki humored his political knowledge and strong opinions, but did she actually approve? Was she tolerant of her own omega mate speaking up like that?\n\nIzuku wouldn’t know; he had never seen Masaru speak so candidly. Certainly, Masaru wore masculine clothes and seemed to enjoy some level of freedom: but he was still a traditional omega in every other way that counted. That’s what Izuku meant by Mitsuki’s confusing expectations.\n\nWith a sigh, he realized that he was being a bit unfair. Katsuki might not understand what it was like to live as an omega male, but he had a point about his sire. At least Izuku had the benefit of Mitsuki’s forwardness; Katsuki didn’t have that same fortune with his mother-in-law. Inko was a polite, closed book, as she processed her new thoughts about Izuku’s coarsely-mannered choice of mate.\n\nIzuku leaned into the embrace, holding Kacchan tight. “Don’t worry, I know she’ll come to love you too.”\n\n“And tha shouldn’ worry about offending the hag. Trust me, Ah knew that look on her face - she’s about to drag thee into the whole family business.”\n\nWhich meant the rising European tensions would only get harder to ignore. On top of every other personal concern gnawing at them."
