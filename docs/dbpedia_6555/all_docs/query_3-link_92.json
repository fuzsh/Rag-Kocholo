        "text": "A musician has spoken out on the dangers of phone theft after filming the exact moment a would-be mugger tried to swipe his iPhone from his hands.\n\nJonas Salvador, 23, had his phone camera on while walking through London's King's Cross late at night on 4 July when he was approached by a hooded bike rider, who can be seen making a shameless attempt to yank the device from his hand. The bike rider fails and immediately cycles off into the distance, in an incident which left Salvador 'shocked' afterwards.\n\nSalvador, who works at a dessert parlour, told Yahoo News he was going home through an area he assumed was safe just before 11pm on Thursday, 4 July. \"I saw the prettiness of the area and was trying to record some content for my socials to promote my music,\" he said.\n\nSalvador was walking through the residential area when the mugger attempted to snatch his iPhone 13 Mini.\n\nSalvador said: “He made a very poor attempt and didn't put up much of a fight. He left as quickly as he came and I was more confused as I've never had someone attempt to steal from me in public.”\n\n“I empathise with everyone who's had to go through something like that, and I feel it's really low of people to have to steal from others, you'd have to be a really selfish person with no compassion.”\n\nThe eye-opening footage comes as it emerged this week that some phone thieves are making as much as £15,000 a month by stealing devices and selling them to Chinese businesses.\n\nThere are multiple accounts from people on social media who said they have had their phones stolen using this same method: the thief drives by, usually on a motorcycle, and snatches the device before speeding away.\n\nMost people advise being vigilant when using their phones in public, as thieves bank on people being distracted.\n\nPreventing theft\n\nSome people have been purchasing mobile phone straps to attach their devices to their wrists, similar to the ones people wore in the early 2000s. One person on TikTok used the wrist strap from their Nintendo Wii remote and attached it to their phone case.\n\nAnd just in case the theft does occur, people have been changing the security settings on their iPhones to prevent the thief from going into airplane mode so the device can be tracked. Apple introduced \"stolen device protection\" in June.\n\nWith that enabled, the iPhone will detect that it is in an unfamiliar location. It will enforce extra steps to authenticate your identity to prevent potential thieves from accessing their data or changing crucial log-in information.\n\nAccording to an investigation by The Times, mobile phone theft increased by 20% in 2023 compared to the year before, with at least 316,683 reported incidents between January 2019 and December 2023 in England and Wales.\n\nOver half of the thefts, 165,933 of them, occurred in London. One area that was discovered to be a hotspot is the city of Westminster, where thefts increased by 47% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nOn 6 July, \"professional thief\" Hamza Kalouche was given a two-year prison sentence, after targeting people as far back as 2020. He was also given a criminal behavioural order which bans him from entering the City of London.\n\nMobile phone network O2 has urged customers to turn off text previews so thieves don't see the pin that gives you access to their accounts. They also suggested avoiding saving passwords in their phones or places like notes, to create a pin for their sim cards and keep their important login details and information at home in case of theft.\n\nRead more"
