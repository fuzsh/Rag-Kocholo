        "text": "Godzilla Minus One's Most Impressive aspect.\n\nI can remember like it was yesterday my first time experiencing a sense of philosophy emanating strongly from a film it wasn't any one film, but rather many that helped give rise to an awakening a sense of my political ideology, but one film that stood out for me in the sense of the nature of war and it's direct conflict of interest with our humanity was 1995’s “Crimson Tide”. I remember being puzzled them as to why this seems like it was being painted as a strong debate when it was pretty clear that one side was unconscionably reckless with human lives in a global scale in the balance. I remember being wowed by the line “In a nuclear world the true enemy is war itself”. The sense of power not stemming from the words in and of themselves and what they might suggest about the man who spoke them, but more-so how they triggered the other respondents including Gene Hackman’s Capt. Frank Ramsay in that scene. The way that the characters, (not necessarily the movie) framed Denzel's Commander Ron Hunter as somewhat cowardly in his apprehension to be involved in something that in and of itself should be regarded as a human evil. The movie paints what should be a pretty simple answer as a complex quandary; To wait to press “send” on nuclear Holocaust without clarity as to whether it's necessary, or not to. This would follow me into my experience watching 1998’s Saving Private Ryan, and the now infamous scene of private Upham’s act of cowardice. In a scene that would elicit a lot of palpable audience anger towards the character (which I initially felt as well) Commander Ron Hunter’s words “the true enemy was war itself” would reappear now calcified in the fires of my rage against private Upham's lack of action on screen. Those words now entrenched in my gut I saw the complexity around the repelling nature of cowardice in and of itself, and the repelling nature of putting people in these conditions that inevitably wreak havoc on a person's stress responses and in a more broad sense their humanity. Movies should not be relied upon for our politics seeing their position within our systems of oppression, but they can at times reinforce them, bond them, make them tighter. Whereas those movies were moments, and yet so memorable as concrete moments for my own personal political growth, Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One, a boisterous, operatic, blockbuster film that pretty much never stops from go, it sets the entire movie around the subject of cowardice as much as it does around the King of the Monsters himself. My extremely positive impression comes not a a reinforcement of my now pretty firm, but still evolving politics, but of my genuine glee that those thoughts would be so adeptly presented in a film and a boisterous, operatic emotionally dense blockbuster no less. The film opens with a kamikaze pilot named Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) landing his plane on a repair base. His arrival is immediately called into question because of the obvious; he is a kamikaze pilot, his one job is to die in service of this grand cause, and yet here he is back from the mission…alive. Ultimately a clear answer as to what has happened and why he's still here is evaded, which only makes the answer that much clearer. What becomes a question is not whether or not he evaded his “duty” but the ethics of that duty in the first place. That question is ultimately the thesis of the movie, centered around the idea of courage especially in lieu of actions by the state that could be called cowardice in and of itself. The arc of this movie is the arc of this man's courage, and where he finds it is I think an interesting treatise on where and when cowardice actually counts as cowardice.\n\nIn Rob reiner’s adaptation of Aaron Sorkin's play “A Few Good Men” it is pretty clear that the ultimate philosophical reveal of the film is that though Dawson and Downey acted on a supposedly “legal” order in the strict sense of the word, that they exhibited cowardice in their inability to take a moral stand against what they were asked to do. The film and play are meant to make clear the difference between legality and morality. In Godzilla Minus One, much of the same is present, except “A Few Good Men” is a courtroom drama where this kind of artistic discourse is fully expected, Godzilla: Minus One is a large scale monster movie. After his actions are clearly discovered one of the soldiers on base a skilled mechanic named Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) approaches Kōichi Shikishima with these words of understanding and compassion; \"Why obey an order to die honorably when the outcome is already clear\". That “outcome” is most immediately identified as the second world war itself and the fact that the war was a lost cause, but just a little digging would further reveal that even before the outcome was clear; the cause was a lost one, further still because imperialism is a lost cause. Once you arrive there, the notion of cowardice in this context is questionable. Even as we watch with anticipation of the moment he might one day redeem himself, we are treated to a stout redressing of the supposed hierarchy of the bloodthirsty needs of a state to increase its holdings in the world over the need for human bonds and life itself to be considered precious. The rest of the movie is not really about him making up for being a failed kamikaze pilot who rightfully sought to protect the sanctity of his life over the need to please his overseers, nor for being scared again when he knew that the outcome was sure, but to learn that when the conditions were right for him to be a hero, his heroism would arrive.\n\nAbout a third of the way into the film a meeting is held between those who have decided to risk their lives in what is to be a final stand against Godzilla, the monster who represents the folly of American and Japanese imperialism, and eco-terrorism. Before he adjourns the meeting former naval engineer Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka) tells the members of this rag tag strike team to go home and spend the remaining time with their families. A soldier responds “You mean be prepared”- the logical assumption being for death. Noda, full of regret that betrays a man who knows he's played a role in the loss of lives in this war, takes a beat before unconsciously shaking his head “no”, and replies solemnly; \"Come to think of it, this country has treated life far too cheaply”. He then goes on to lay out the various ways in which they showed this disdain which runs the gamut from indirect (logistical callousness) to direct (Kamikaze Pilots) callousness for lives. He then (beginning to find passion in his voice) says “he would take pride in a citizen led effort that risks no lives at all”. The two most important words in that small speech are “country” and “citizen”, the context in which they are used and the difference in the attitudes associated with them, as well as the difference displayed in the mood of their orator. Each of these things are separate and distinctively different feelings which then forces the inherent understanding of the disassociation between citizen and country. The former is often victimized and exploited by the latter using the inherent desire of human beings to gather into social groups as a ploy to create a false sense of oneness that can be exploited in any number of ways, including engraving a sense of duty to what amount to the wills of a greedy few and not their individual or collective needs. The films defense of what is normally framed as cowardice magnifies the tension between the idea of country and it's connection to citizenry. In pointing out that this country was frivolous and apathetic towards life, Godzilla Minus One declares that this mostly citizen led effort will be about life and a fight for the future explicitly absolving Koichi and to some extent the audience for their empathy of the crime of cowardice. The realization being that to assert such a claim would be akin to victim blaming, taking us back to the first half of the Air technicians words “Why obey an order to \"die honorably\" when the outcome is clear”.\n\nThe theme that comes most clear in Godzilla minus one is the shame, doubt, and trauma, inflicted upon everyday average citizens indoctrinated by the powers that be of any nation state to take on the mindset of their conquerors. After that the redemption that extends out from freeing oneself from the shackles of incentivized homicide, and into a return to our actual social needs; one being the primacy of life itself, of which as Commander Hunter so articulated; war is the natural enemy of. It's a heavy concept fit snugly inside this stunning, roaring, spectacle of a movie and it's the true glory of this Godzilla film. A visual culmination years coming in my own cinematic journey towards the answer to a question began in the 90s with one submarine movie, all which arrived from the depths of either the sea or my mind.\n\nI Like What Axel F is, I Mourn What it Could Be, and Maybe That it Shouldn't Be.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop as a franchise is an interesting if not frustrating journey over the years, both as a production and as a viewing experience. The former because even the first one had an entire makeover before it made it to our screens, and the fourth spent a couple of decades in development hell. The latter precisely because it's so uneven as a franchise with both quality and tone, changing drastically from film to film even while the formula remains mostly the same. For two entries it somehow came together, for one it finally revealed the flaw in the undertaking of sequels in the first place, and for the latest I’d say the results are complicated. Unlike other major franchises the built-in plot line is one that makes repetition a quandary, because it's literally called Beverly Hills Cop it means either this Detroit cop has to keep coming back to Beverly Hills, or simply move to Beverly Hills..they chose the former. Something like “Aliens” lends itself to being set in different locations, different times, with whole entirely different cast of people if one should want. Indiana Jones can go on different adventures, Rambo can go on different missions, Rocky can have different fights, but Axel Foley coming back to (never mind having reasons) Beverly Hills to do work there while not working there is the definition of cinematically “stretching” milk with water, and yet here we are at the fourth iteration. This has always been the problem with Hollywood and more to the point capitalism, this unwillingness to let something that was profitable just live as it's most pure self because there's a shred of a possibility that money is being left in the table. The the obsessive and possessive desire to repeat what probably shouldn't be repeated because there's an opportunity for more money to be made is a prime example of Dr Ian Malcolm’s (Jurassic Park) proverb “You were so concerned with whether you could, you never stopped to think whether you should” and has taken the life and the love out of many a venture, many an idea, and in this case many a movie, and it's no different here.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: “Axel F” is a practice in cognitive dissonance of joy. It's fun, it's funny, it moves pretty well, the action is fine, the jokes are pretty good, there's some chemistry, and depending on your taste, you will find the acting anywhere from fair to very fair. The premise is the same, the result predictable; Axel needs a reason to come back and because it's a legacy sequel you can bet there is some kind of family involved. In this case there's a daughter that we had never seen before, by a mother we had never seen before and the movie proposes to deal with that by nudging in a not too shabby subplot about Axel being so in love with his job that he prioritized it over his daughter and then refuse to apologize for it. It's the kind of conflict that needs a lot more than it's being given here but it's in an applaudable effort to create something out of nothing -again “stretching the milk”. There are dirty cops, there's Kevin Bacon, we see most of the old players come back, it's not a bad time. I found it to be pleasantly better than I expected. “Better than expected” is fine, but it feels cheap and somewhat depressing to say that about a franchise that started on the notes this one did, and that relative quality is notable. Though it most certainly could’ve and should’ve been a theatrical release, there is something TV-like about this film, something in the cooking that makes it feel smaller, safer. I could mention the score, Lorne Balfe’s music has its moments of brilliance, but it's not ambitious enough nor anywhere near as creative as Harold Faltermeyer’s legendary score. I could definitely mention the script, which feels aggressively hollow, hackneyed, and predictable, and moves along like a sitcom. I could mention the direction which though far superior to the other aspects of production, doesn’t have the moxie or compositional detail of the Scott sequel which is this films most clear kinship of the series. The “why” of this particular blandness in the ultimate outcome, becomes a bit clearer in the ingredients of the credits. The original (Penned by Daniel Petrie Jr) was nominated for an Academy Award, the sequel was written by men (Larry Ferguson, Warren Skaaren) whose credits include “The Highlander”, “The Hunt for Red October”, “Alien 3”, “Beetlejuice”, and “Batman” combined. The first two were directed by gifted journeyman Martin Brest, and Tony thee Scott, director of “Top Gun”, “The Last Boy Scout”, “True Romance”, and “Crimson Tide” to name a few. “Axel F” is directed by a first timer whose previous credits are Apple Commercials, and written by the guy who brought you 2013’s “Gangster Squad” (a movie I almost forgot existed until I looked up writer Will Beal’s credits) and “Aquaman”. The other writers are a TV guy (Kevin Etten) and the writer/director or “That Awkward Moment” (Tom Gormican) another “Forget-Me-Please” legend. Factor in that somewhere back in time there was supposed to be a TV show involving a family angle (A son that time) and it helps map where the underwhelming bits might have come from. This kind of absurd drop in resume quality is is exactly my issue with the film and over that, capitalism because it shows not only are you committed to forcing something that ultimately may be best left alone in pursuit of something original, but that even when you're forcing it you're so disinterested in the actual product you don't even care to make sure that you put the best people around it even while knowing the history of the things that preceded it. Handing the reigns of a legacy franchise sequel over a TV writer, two poor movie writers, and a commercial director with no movie experience is telling and frustrating. It says to me you weren't aiming to make this a Blockbuster movie that would simply air on Netflix, but rather a high-end TV movie for Netflix, which is mostly what Netflix produces; “Bright” except not written by Max Landis, but kinda. When when the people behind “Top Gun” Maverick go into production and they enlist the likes of Peter Craig (“The Town”, “The Hunger Games”, “The Batman”) and the director of two of the most visually satisfying movies of their decade in “Oblivion” and “Tron Legacy”, it says to me “Oh they mean business”, and by comparison it makes the folks behind Axel F seem as if they barely tried. To be fair, movie making is always a crap shoot, and maybe over 20 years of trying to get this off the ground led to a willingness to compromise, but quality of the people you collaborate with and the people around you are indicative of not only a desire to want to make the best movie possible, but a belief in the product. So it then begs the question; “Why didn't the people behind this want to make the best movie possible?” . “Who doesn't believe in Beverly Hills Cop as an IP?”\n\nPart and parcel to the frustration of watching something that is merely “fine”, put together by an assemblage of people who's resumes are merely “fine” when and maybe especially because the last was such a huge commercial and artistic failure, -is all the unanswered questions it calls forth. Most chief amongst them; is “fine” all we can hope for? This goes beyond even this franchise. When John Mctiernan leaves the “Die Hard” franchise for whatever reasons were behind that, why is no one looking for the best to replace him? Why weren’t John Woo, Tsui Hark, Martin Campbell, Paul Greengrass, or Michael Bay, given a ring? Why are Len Wiseman (fine) and John Moore (not good) taking up the work of a bona-fide action movie legend? In a world where 8 “Mission Impossible’s” in, they're still some of the best action films out there, I don't see the point of going into something with the ingredients to only make something acceptable rather than something that not just reminds people of the nostalgia they once experienced, but of the ingredients behind the quality they once experienced, the greatness they once experienced. Is Tom Cruise the only guy in Hollywood that knows action well enough to know how to follow great acts? I know the answers in a certain sense of what capitalism is bound to do, I just don't understand it on a kind of natural level. Where does pride in what you do not come into play? What you produce, putting your name on something. I'm not talking about Eddie Murphy who I think has made it pretty clear he’s sincerely trying, to some extent that's probably the main reason why this turned out any good in the first place. I'm talking about Netflix, I'm talking about Paramount, maybe even (dare I say it) Jerry Bruckheimer. I'm asking why is it that when Tom Cruise wants to make a legacy sequel it seems like a signal goes out for Hollywood’s best to get behind what is intended to be a global event, but when Eddie Murphy wants to make a legacy sequel of one of the most popular movies all time it seems like “The Replacements” from that one Keanu Reeves movie shows up? Though race may quickly come first to mind, considering the facts behind the aforementioned “Die Hard” series or the treatment of the remake of Mamoru Oshii’s sci-fi classic “Ghost in the Shell”, this is less an issue of racial disparity and more a disparity of higher ups who care about movies.\n\nBack in 1998 Roland Emmerich riding high off the success of Independence Day would take a run at an American version of Ishiro Honda’s post nuclear eco-classic monster flick “Godzilla”. Culturally the movie was by and large a disappointment, the public felt it was forgettable and it showed itself in the drop off in the box office in only its second week, but it nonetheless was commercially successful and ended up making nearly three times it's budget back, and yet despite this the shutter doors were closed on any sequels for Godzilla. The market and the people recognized it wasn't a worthy pursuit. Funny enough, a revisit to Emmerich's Godzilla flusters one with a rush of nostalgia not simply for a time by-gone, but for a craft, for an attention to detail in storytelling that then was a bare minimum, and now barely exists. This is the struggle of not only watching the latest entry of what was a classic franchise but of watching movies in general today. The lack of care, the lack of intention, the the lazy acceptance of mediocrity, that has infected not only the upper echelons of Hollywood, but to some extent the audience which includes a certain amount of critics. When IP’s, sequels, and remakes initially started to noticeably dominate theater screens I kicked and screamed, but eventually their near ubiquitous proliferation led to a sort of mild acceptance and then eventually to a sort of celebration of the best of the worst, but at some point I've come full circle back to where I started. I no longer find myself in the mood to celebrate mediocrity disguised as invention or fun. If I watch either of the most recent Japanese Godzilla films (Shin Godzilla, Godzilla Minus One) and I see big, boisterous, emotional, fun as hell thrill rides, and then I watch “Godzilla vs King Kong” and it's just the same rock'em sock'em effects I got in those two and nothing else, why should I applaud the latter? When I played little league football I had one of those loud cranky old school Bear Bryant characters as a coach. Coach “Pete” was prone to vitriolic evil -John Wooden-like maxims like “Your saliva is 99% water drink that”, but from time to time his over simplifications and flat out lies hit. One such quote was “If you can touch it, you can catch it”. The words hang banner like over my feelings toward this current iteration of movie making. I would only slightly change the context to if you can touch greatness, than you can catch it. If you can get the monsters right and the joy of what we see in them, then you can get the characterization of the people affected by their actions right, you can get the rest of the storytelling right. a I'm not going to applaud you for cheating those aspects as if its either/or. Whether it was an Ed Wood picture or Berry Gordy's “The Last Dragon”, “Roadhouse” or any number of Golan-Globus productions, those films didn't end up becoming the cult classics they became because the directors were knowingly winking at the audience, or because they were aiming low. All of those people were sincerely trying to make the best picture possible and more important due to the insularly nature of the productions they were empowered by people who mostly wanted the same, and that heart and that desire along with other more indefinite factors regardless of skill, regardless of budget, ended up showing themselves in the final product. For those who have boots on the ground of an actual production it is not for me to say whether or not they actually are putting their heart and soul into these productions, that doesn't become clear till years later when somebody's brave enough to talk about what went on, but it is more than evident that the powers that be, that provide distribution, that green light, that hold final say over what talent they can afford to get, or want to go after, are definitely not invested in producing good art, and at this point they’re not even invested and producing great entertainment. They are not concerned with the legacy of films like “Beverly Hills Cop” beyond the extent to which that legacy makes the movie profitable. Whether its the fun but rather flat in comparison to their antecedent Bad Boys sequels, the crushing emptiness of the “Jurassic Worlds” or the sad afterlife of “Ghostbusters”, the continuing onslaught of reanimated skinless, corporatized nostalgia as content and time passable entertainment and it's disruptive effect on those of us who still wish to see those dearly departed bits of our past is frustrating to say the least, even when the final product is “pretty good” or “not too bad”. “Axel F” is just the latest example of Hollywood taking the safest road possible, the most risk adverse path to the creation of art and entertainment. For all intensive purposes the entry seems to be a success and the part of me that loved that series and what made its original entries such an important part of my '80s cinematic experience is happy for that, but the fact that that success only further incentivizes the disruptive nature of the philosophy of content over that of art and entertainment deeply saddens me.\n\nChallengers Represents a Challenge for Zendaya.\n\n“Challengers” the latest from autuer Luca Guadagnino is the tale of a couple Art (Mike Faist) and Patrick (Josh O’Connor) who then becomes a throuple when they meet the enigmatic and stunning Tashi (Zendaya) and the torrid stormy road they take to being able to fully become who they are, who they want to be. A movie so tethered to a foundational need, to desire, to sex, to hunger couldn't have been more bland and worse still, clumsy. Guadagnino’s latest is supposed to feel like a light hand under your shirt, in the small of your back, gliding upwards pressing on some muscles, sliding in others until it reaches the nape of your neck and pricks you deeply with a sharp fingernail. Instead Challengers \"sex scenes\" and it's ploys for lust and desire feel like someone making a bunch of racket as they try and sneak up behind you only to grab you by your neck and bang your head on the table. Every single moment felt forced, abrupt, there was no sense of timing, no sense of patience, and no true willingness to go “there”. Guadagnino likes to give us tantalization as pure presentation and it never works for me. He keeps his camera still and at a distance, it sits there like an observer who is outwardly about as moved by it as Spock. The camera is never there with its subjects in the ways Adrian Lyne voyeuristically enjoys Fatal Attraction, or the way Paul Verhoeven allows the camera to make it a throuple in “Basic Instinct”. In “Call Me By Your Name”, there is the infamous fruit scene, the camera nearly falls asleep as Chalamet commits to the act with all the passion of turning a doorknob..Where is the writhing, the self touching, why are his shorts still on? For an act so based in unbridled desire it feels like Ben Stein giving a class on lust. The director always seems trapped in a purgatory where longing and lust are in direct conflict. He never wants his subjects through the camera, he's rarely interested in their faces when they're burning for each other, just when they're attracted to each other. His choices are dull and it effects or maybe shows itself in his choice of actors who are the hinges upon which this doorway into desire hang. Zendaya in what many are calling a movie star showing is the prime manifestation of this conflation. Some have said this movie doesn’t work without her and they’re right…it doesn’t.\n\nZendaya is one of cinemas great movers, I believe that is what people most see when they talk about her movie star power. She is elegant but forceful, composed and lithe. It shows in the scene where Patrick first introduces her to us and Art, her body commits to every end position with force, but the getting there is smooth and wave like. Its much like the catwalk, the step into the ground is a earth, but the body before the step is water. Zendaya in so many ways resembles a cat, but she hasn't met a director yet who is interested in or wants to play with that energy and she's seems too interested in protecting herself to bring it out on her own. Sex and playing “sex” or “sexy” is about letting go. You have to be unafraid to let the camera as a disembodied partner see your primal self. Think about the way Jamie Lee Curtis performs this exact act in James Cameron’s “True Lies”. Playing a woman who has never done anything truly adventurous, who has always been prudent, a woman who wants more but has no idea how to get there -Curtis starts off stiff very aware of herself, and her watcher, but slowly, surely, she stops protecting herself and begins to lean into feeling her body, opening up the camera to her most sensual self, and by consequence we voyeuristically join, the man in front of her all but disappears. Zendaya’s Tashi is no Helen Tasker, but Zendaya herself reminds me of her in this small regard; she has made to date, prudent choices, smart choices, but she has not been adventurous in choosing her roles, and though this is her attempt, much like Helen Tasker in the beginning of her dance, she doesn't seem to really know how to get there. Zendaya has no moment in Challengers, where sensuality, sex, or unbridled emotion feel as if they have taken over her body even while she is in control. No encapsulation of Meg Ryan's orgasm scene in “When Harry met Sally”. In essence some true sense that while everyone is turned on, or appalled by her being seemingly lost in the throws of her own self passion, she was in full control and putting on a show the entire time.\n\nI feel much of the same way about Zendaya as I do Michael B Jordan, two actors with untapped potential that remains corked under the fact that they never seem to let us into that hidden self, or to that creation of self that appears knowable, that calls us to peer inside them on camera. They have the looks, they have to a certain extent - the energy, but they seem to always be protecting themselves. Image production is of course a responsibility and an aspect of any acting career, but as with all things it's a spectrum that is in a different place for each actor it represents. Those actors we revere for their acting not for their image production is a result of their leaning being further on the spectrum towards the craft than it is towards the image, with Zendaya and Jordan, it's more image production than craft to an extreme. True vulnerability almost always seems to escape them, and any true sense that they are giving themselves over to us escapes us. Tashi may move as if she is always aware the camera is on her, but Zendaya should move as if the the camera is apart of her. Tashi may not be open to letting anyone in, but Zendaya should be sneaking us in through the back door. In one of her stronger scenes in the movie, Tashi and Patrick are involved in a conversation where her true desires have been have been exposed, it is in essence quite possibly the summation of Tashi as a character, and yet it's telling that outside of aesthetics nothing profound occurs in Zendaya's face and body. Whenever there comes a time for an interesting emotion of expression Zendaya performs the one that would get you the least points in “Family Fued, because it is the one that would come most readily to just about anyone. What Patrick is telling her is meant to cause a mixture of shock, hurt, attraction, and anger, because it is based in truth, (we know by what she does later) Zendaya only plays anger. One eye widens larger than the other, the rest of her face appears pained, constipated, as if Patrick is speaking is foreign language she struggles to understand. This is not bad if the only idea is that this idea is detestable to Tashi, and she wants Patrick to feel that way, but the audience should see what's going on underneath as well and the “underneath” is what Zendaya has trouble playing. Critic Angelica Jade Bastien was absolutely right when she connected Zendaya's acting with the Katherine Hepburn quote about Meryl Steep, you can most certainly “hear the wheels turning“, because Zendaya is thinking more than she's feeling . If you only pay attention to how she moves, how picturesque she is, you might be impressed but when you listen to how she cuts Patrick down, and you watch her face it's banal, far too straightforward there's no knife to it, it sounds mean, because the words are there, but she delivers them in exactly that energy with no interestimg curve. Often the most interesting and cutting words we've seen on screen have been delivered in the opposite energy, you don't get angry, you smile. You don't play emotive anger you calmly and cooly say “You're nothing to me but another dead vampire”, or you if actually pierced you allow a tiny face drop, near imperceptible, but a clear receipt. Zendaya'‘s face does not betray her, and Zendaya is not vulnerable enough to break through facade in the least, especially subtly. When she walks away it's a thing of beauty, if you're just watching the walk, but in her face, nothing. The anger she shows provides no interesting choice, merely furrowed eyebrows. The opening salvo between Michael Douglas's Dan Gallagher and Glenn Closes's Alex Forrest in “Fatal Attraction” is a Master class in the importance of A; a director knowing the value of direct close ups in titilation and anticipation, and B. two actors that understand the subtleties of facade and how and when it breaks. Gallagher wants to play the loyal husband merely here for an innocent drink, Alex sees through it and start sending arrows directly at him. Glenn Close’s poker Face and the subtle brakes in Douglas that ultimately lead to the sex scene are vital to what makes Fatal Attraction one of the sexiest movies of all time.\n\nZendaya does not appear to be a good poker player, Tashi needs to appear that way. The bedroom is one of the few places that Tashi can exert control and uninhibited desire, where her true face should come through crystal clear, not necessarily to the boys, but to the audience. Guadagnino could've helped her. A bedroom scene with Patrick is so stilted as to conjure no appetite whatsoever. He shoots it from medium wide, (why?) this is a form of intimacy, even if Tashi is a bit mathematic about sex we should see Patrick's desire for the fantasy in contrast to Tashi's desire for control and power. On the surface level Patrick and Tashi have this in common with Catherine Trammel and Nick Curran of “Basic Instinct” ; Patrick like Nick knows exactly who and what his “Catherine” is, he just doesn't care. He wants her badly enough not to. These are the moments for interesting choices in a scene, from all involved in that dirk room. See Eihi Shiina’s wildly over the top movements as she saws off Ryo Ishibashi’s foot in “Audition”. In that scene, mutilation is made decadent. This is Asami’s bedroom, and the mutilation is her sex, and the reckless abandon and joy she receives is thick in Shiina's movements and expressions. Director Takashi Miike's camera goes in close and personal, intimately because here is where Asami finally has control, here is where the facade breaks, where her true self is revealed and the coy child like fantasy is peeled away. In contrast Challengers will have no such moment with Tashi, nor with Zendaya. There's a scene where Tashi deeply hurt by something that has happened to her, you can't tell it's supposed to have hit her hard, she nearly drops under a tree and it all kind of comes crashing down. Again, there are no interesting choices. Zendaya isn’t patient enough, she isn't open enough. She sits there for a moment and nothing radiates, no rage, no sense she is truly trying to hold back against a rising tide in her body. Guadagnino goes in for a close up on her face and nothing really happens. These are the moments where actors are made. The emoting with Zendaya is never bad, it's just never great, or distinctive, or provocative. Tashi is an example of a number of women I've seen on screen the kind that are aware of this stipulations and gendered expectations the world places up on them and in this case most especially as a black woman or even more specifically a biracial black woman, and yet Zendaya seems as disinterested in this aspect as the movie is in it. There may be the tiniest of hints and illusions as to how her race plays into all this but there is definitely no sincere interest to explore this aspect of Tashi. Guadagnino and Zendaya could do to have taken a look at Viola Davis and Steven McQueen in Widows where despite the fact that Viola's character clearly moves in white circles her blackness within them plays a significant role in what we are seeing in the movie as well as what we see in Viola herself. Veronica Rawlings is overall quite a different woman from the much younger Tashi, but they do have in common the shared desire to keep it together. They are both manipulators and they both deeply understand the value society places on appearances, they have to. Yet Viola creates these profound moments of breakage, moments where the mask slips where she must find some place for this energy to go. Whether after being slapped by Elizabeth Debicki, or in her final scene. The most representative of what the vast difference is, is in the opening scene when she finds out that her husband is dead. The stare in the mirror that turns into a primal scream and then the immediate fixture, back to work, “I will not let this consume me” even as it is consuming her. I believe Tashi seen under the tree should have been that kind of moment, not the exact same moment but the same art in a sense that she needed to be somewhere where she could let it go for just a moment, pull it back together, and get back in the game. Zendaya doesn't omit, she clearly emotes, she just simply doesn't do anything interesting with it and maybe more importantly neither does Guadagnino. Challengers and its star ends up a missed opportunity for the kind of potential that exists for films to make a return to eroticism and for movie stars to make a return to form. There are suggestions, there are implications, and there are a few exciting moments where it feels like we are back, but for most and much of this movie it feels like wanting to play in the snow but only being able to watch it on the inside of a globe. There's something there, but I wasn't able to feel it and as such eventually I just put it back down.\n\nDune Part Two: Hollywood Doesn't Really Want Frank Herbert's \"Dune\"\n\nWhat Hollywood wants from Frank Herbert's Sci-Fi epic “Dune” is a blockbuster film, this is its first and primary concern. This is not an insight, nor a damnation in and of itself, but it is a fundamental block in my ongoing issues with this franchise and the repeated tries at making a successful on screen adaptation. If the marriage was more successful, (and by successful I mean balanced) I would love Dune, but this Dune is a diluted, convoluted, distilled Dune, maintaining almost none of its capacity for thought provocation, and only a certain portion of its sense of wonder. Denis Villanueve is a director who deals in ambiguities and the incomplete. Frank Herbert's canonical Sci Fi text is as comprehensive a bit of storytelling-weaving as you can get in the genre. Well-beloved by many not just for it's exhaustive attention to detail in world building, but as a challenging narrative allegory of western power, ecological decimation, and imperialism, but is also as German historian Frank Jacob refers to it “Anti-Colonial Colonialism”. It stands against the idea in theory, but in practice it's still upholds it. The ongoing nature of this conflict of perception is representative of the cohabitative nature of the deconstruction and reconstruction of orientalist themes, symbology, and interpretation in the original text. The ongoing conflict between the original text and it's on-screen adaptations is a product of the cohabitative imbalance of capital and art in the industry, the latter of which is represented in the choice of director and holds an unsuitable amount of influence over the former in which both work to reduce a dense, rich text to pure artifice and almost no edifice.\n\nIn Denis Villanueve's two part adaptation of the first Dune, the book’s dense characterizations and cacophony of political machinations are reduced to broad strokes. There is no interest in building the interdependent and volatile nature of these relationships and the characters that represent them. The emperor’s integral role in what happened to the Atriedes being completely absent from the first film, is introduced in the second mostly through scenes that fly by and tell you absolutely the bare minimum about who the Emperor is as a character, much less that of the triumvirate of the noble houses, the navigator’s guild, and the emperor. Much of the political intrigue, tactics, and infighting which reinforces the prescience not only in events, but in incisive portraits of the psychological approach of colonial powers are also gone. Paul's doubts and unease about being a messiah are highlighted and over-represented, his foibles and ego silenced until he drinks “the water of life”, which then makes it seem the water of life caused it, rather than his own deficiencies. Villanueve’s own way into the book is a tell as to what he sees and values as the important thrust and even moreso, what he doesn't by way of silence. On the podcast “Q with Tom Power” Villanueve is asked what drew him to Dune in the first place, he answers; “There's something about the journey of the main character Paul Atreides, the feelings of isolation, the way he was struggling with the burden of his heritage, family heritage, genetic heritage, political heritage, climatic heritage, all this weight on his shoulders, then finally being able to find freedom through the contact with another culture.” Villanueve’s words are indicative and representative of Villanueve's focus on the hero's journey and since our “hero” is Paul, the Fremen are merely a device by which Paul is catapulted to self discovery. The hero’s journey aspect of Herbert’s book has always represented the source of Hollywood’s fervent attraction to this series, as it to them is what defines its potential as an intellectual property. The dollar signs in the eyes of industry executives easily push aside the fact that in some respects the source material is a rejection of that narrative, and the choosing of a director (a very skilled one) who shares the belief, means that by consequence of the machine through which it is produced, any chance for any meaty meaningful reconstruction or deconstruction of the original texts’ obvious themes is jettisoned, and that is a choice in every sense of the word. The spectacle which is what is wanted and desired by most of the execs, and most of the general public is not unimportant, (especially in a era so devoid of any true examples of it) but it is very much standing in the place of the politics and thematic breadth of Herbert's vision.\n\nThe spectacle of Villanueve's Dune is as oppressive as the book’s various houses and characters. Alot of thought was put into building this world and it's clear in the design; from costume, to set, to technology, and beyond. Harkonnens float like spacemen in an early Hanna Barbara cartoon above arid dunes and rock formations. A helicopter on fire freefalls in the background as we watch Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet race across the sand under the shade of the Harkonnen version of a John Deere for the desert. Sandworms slide through earth parallel to each other from a birds eye view. A harrowing supremely well choreographed fight occurs more than once, with a finale sure to be on the minds of everyone long after they have left the theater. All of these things are such forceful sights to behold, it's difficult to dismiss Dune part two’s success as spectacle. They take up so much air in the film you can almost forget to take a breath and remember that Dune is essentially a space epic with alot more than spectacle on its mind and far too politically intricate to be reproduced on screen by an entity so dedicated to the reproduction of the very things the book seeks to deconstruct. In essence how are you going to faithfully adapt such an anti-Star Wars book through the funnel of an enterprise that wants exactly Star Wars? The aspects of these films that most align themselves with the aspects most fetishized by both those in the industry and consumer at-large are in rare form. This version has alot more in common with those intitial Star Wars films than the difference in execution and skill might allow one to believe. The delayed introduction of the emperor, the reluctant hero with a family name that rings out, the focus on languages, creatures, clothing, weaponry, world building in essence, these are the parts of Dune that sell it. The parts that make it consumable to a vast mass. It has none of the weighted emotional heft of Spielberg's “Minority Report” or “AI” to deter some audiences. None of the narrative integrity to the challenging themes of its source material that “A Clockwork Orange” maintains to repel them. It does not carry the narrative foreboding present in George Lucas's prequels. Much like the initial Star Wars trilogy, characters having names and titles serve mostly utilitary and perfunctory functions to the script. The characterizations are airy, the politics are broad, there is little to detangle, little to sit with outside pageantry. The oatmeal density of the books themes and politics now water, Dune’s transformation to “popcorn movie” is now complete.\n\nFrank Herbert had much more distinctive and specific desires for his book as it pertains to its themes and its political commentary. The parallels in the relationships between the noble houses, the emperor, and Arakkis (which even phonetically sounds like Iraq) are undeniable and as such unavoidable, thusly anyone who adapts the book must in essence agree with the intricacy, the specificity. You cannot deal in the abstract with a text like this. The source material, (which as it pertains to the fremen, also deals in forms of abstractness) lends itself to orientalism, if you then become even more abstract then what is left? The answer is movies that talk like the book about a man seeking to align himself with and become equal to a people no less than him, while asserting his superiority in nearly every image and piece of text. Movies that imply that merely feeling conflicted over your inarguable “superiority” is the same as deconstructing it. In his landmark book on the subject literary critic and academic Edward Said had this to say about “Orientalism”; “In a quite constant way, Orientalism depends for its strategy on this flexible positional superiority, which puts the Westerner in a whole series of possible relationships with the Orient without ever losing him the relative upper hand.” Knowing this, the question here is not whether or not Paul and the Atriedes are white saviors, (Though there could certainly be an argument they most certainly are as both the literature and screen do not truly deny that Paul is the messiah, but rather the efficacy of the role) the question is; “What are the Fremen?”\n\nFor all the time spent around the Fremen as a people, they are largely bystanders in a story that largely concerns them. They bookend the first film, appear in the second (as with most of the characters in this film) as a large collective meant to signify one character, and in no way are in charge of their own destiny. In text and then re-creation of the text, they are reduced to pawns. Their land is occupied, they cannot defeat their occupiers on their own and so the ways to defeat them are given to them by the foreigner - “You’ve been fighting the Harkkonens for decades, we’ve been fighting them for centuries” - their prowess as a fighting force is reduced to the swarm like behavior rather than the elite man to man skill that saw even small numbers of Fremen decimate large numbers of Harkonnen soldiers and the Sardaukar. Even their religion is given to them by way of the Bene Gesserit. Villanueve a man heavily drawn to the image seems completely disinterested in any image that shows the fremen people (his favorite in the book) as a mighty force independent of Paul. The interest is not in them as a people, but in the collection of symbols, signs, and cultural iconography that convey their “otherness”. The romance at the center of the movies suffers not only from the lack of any deep chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya, but from the lack of any specificity around what exactly draws Chani to Paul despite her natural and very valid fears about him as an interloper. Gone is even the patience to suggest a slowburn as exemplified in something like “The Last Samurai”. Paul's whiteness is taken for granted as inherently attractive in and of itself. It is the draw, it is the pull, and as told on film it is irresistible no matter what place white men occupy and felt almost on sight. So, Said’s words remain; at what point in these films is Paul's relational superiority not clear? What are we to say about a narrative that continually highlights a groups mysticism and the abstract symbols of their culture apart from their humanity? One willing to turn “Jihad” into “holy war” as to not invite controversy, but unwilling to use one’s imagination as to how to present the MENA (Middle Eastern and North African) coded fremen in a complex relationship to a complex man? Why chance that potentially mine ridden path, when they can just have the horde remain mostly nameless and faceless save for those descriptors which most reliably tell us who they are stand-ins for? There is no need for a hypothetical about what would happen if MENA actors were placed in this precarious story of jihad, because there are MENA actors in this precarious story of jihad. Hamza Baissa as “Young fremen patrol”, Hassan Najib as “Young fremen patrol” and Omar Elbooz as “Young fremen patrol and on it goes. In the caves, on the worms, and any time we see the Fremen's collective ethnic makeup it is quite clear they're mostly MENA looking, they just don't need to speak or have much agency. What are we to make of a film that reduces Thufir Hawat - feared and revered master of assassins to glorified guide and head of security in one movie? His vital role to the goings on in the narrative cut completely? To the disappearance of Liet Kynes importance and her (gender reversed) relationship to Chani? To the reduction of Yuen's relationships? To the quick deaths of almost every person of color in the first and the reduction of Stilgar to a form of elevated comic relief in part two, almost pointless to the movie except as a pair of shoulders for Paul to sit on? The presence of the opposite or a challenge to any one, or two, or maybe three of these things would still make for a movie taking positive steps in the right direction, and none of them by themselves or in and of themselves harmful to the movie as an adaptation, it is the collection of them that does that.\n\nSince Europeans, Western powers, America, and Hollywood center themselves as the cultural and political centers of the world so too do their literary and cinematic avatars, and as such it remains in Dune. You cannot free yourself from a narrative by adapting the narrative, no more than you can disband hegemonic structures and ideas from the “inside”. You are not subverting the trope of making the “other” a prop to show white superiority, by making them a prop to show the folly of white superiority. You cannot find yourself or seek the “true self” in another culture, (as Villanueve alluded to later in the same interview) this is nothing more than the guiding force behind the whitewashing of yoga or rastafarianism and many other appropriations, Rudyard Kipling’s “The White Man’s Burden” where the burden is his guilt over his capacity to consume. This is the flaw in any overall belief in the Hollywood structure to do something that would inflict even minor damage to its self perpetuated mythology. Dune is undeniably a story about a gigantic and enormous conspiracy to rob a people of a resource that rightfully belongs to them and the prophecy that uphold it's players criminal machinations. That POV is not the only read available, but it is amongst, if not its most apparent. That POV would mean trying to build a blockbuster around a hero that is in essence a villain, and the lack of investment in it forbids something as imaginative as allowing the events of Dune to fold out from a fremen perspective beyond a voiceover from Zendaya’s Chani. That POV would mean following through consistently on the implication made by Chani’s narration in the first, that the Atreides are just the fremen’s latest oppressors. Which would mean a blockbuster that played out superficially at least like “Killers of the Flower Moon”. For all the pomp and gravitas, this latest Dune has failed to acknowledge that aspect to even the degree a bare minimum would decree. It is not some understated study of the power and hegemony and in fact borders on a celebration of it, just ambiguous enough to not fall on that side. That alone would still not be enough for me to hold back my excitement for such detail to world building, had that world not been so aesthetically tied to this one, or so clearly the entire point, as film critic Richard Brody said about Villanueve’s vision in a recent tweet; “Nothing distinctive in his filming of gigantic sets, either—they themselves are the idea”. A decent emotional exploration in this movie mined for effect might've won me over to the film as well, but while certain images brought some sense of wonder there was nothing behind them to make them weighted. What's left is a movie that looks the part but doesn't feel it, a movie that feels like it sold out on the books most apparent themes, (nevermind imagining something beyond them) and couldn't even bother to replace them with something more revelatory or inspiring than ugly toys and sad faced boys.\n\nMr and Mrs Smith: “Oh What a Tangled Web We Weave”\n\nTwo thoughts reigned supreme as I watched Donald Glover's reimagining of the 2005 Pitt/ Jolie vehicle “Mr. and Mrs Smith.”; “Spy movies are very cool and Donald Glover is not’, and ‘there is a underlying contempt here for the things he's mimicking”. Ultimately I could end this entire thing with just that sentence. There are a lot of reasons why I didn't fall for this show, and why at a certain point it started to become a chore to watch it, but most of them could be housed under the statements above. What I found fascinating about the show was the contrast of what the interviews leading up to the launch wanted us to believe the show was going to do, and what the show actually did. The mission (at least by what has been said in interviews seemed to be to subvert the genre, push something deeper out of the marriage angle, and embrace something opposite of what the film possessed. But for all the conversation about how different this was going to be from the film, this was pretty much the same, just with people, places, tech, lighting, cinematography, vehicles, fashion etc that were less cool or interesting than both the original film and most of the movies/TV shows in the spy genre.\n\nThere had been a couple of quotes from Donald Glover that had made their way around Twitter prior to the show's debut. I found them somewhat annoying and misguided, but once I started watching I thought initially Mr. and Mrs. Smith had done a great job building a relationship between two people, with two people who had such glaringly astonishing chemistry. Erskine and Glover really do bounce off of each other magnificently. They have similar timing, similar forms of self-depreciation, and are a match aesthetically and spiritually, but they were right when they said in interviews that they are not Brad and Angelina and they “can't replicate that”. Episode five was the beginning of the scratch to an itch I had even while mostly enjoying the show up to that point. “Do You Want Kids” had all the ingredients for an unforgettable banger; Ron Perlman, a subject that is very much so worth deep conversation and commentary, a car and foot chase with hand to hand combat, expensive homes, and Lake Como, Italy. What came out was completely forgettable unless you count how forgettable it is as memorable. Perlman is a stand in for a “trial baby” in an episode about the couples different views on having kids. Unfortunately it's handled with all the subtlety of a mack truck in space, from the title to Perlman’s performance (which is very good, but also very obnoxiously on-the-nose ). It has nothing interesting to say about parenting or about the two potential parents, (outside of their differences of opinions on children) and nothing very interesting or memorable besides Perlman. Leaving the episode I thought “You had far more time to explore the issue of rearing children in this career field and you've come away with something not much deeper than what the original film had to say about it.” Worse still, the film made very clear that child rearing was something that they didn't necessarily need in their lives. In a country that has pushed child rearing on woman's bodies like crack cocaine, and is currently doing everything it can to force them into it as an inherent duty, which is more refreshing?\n\n“There's this huge space between us and it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other what is that called?” This is something Jolie's “Jane” says to their therapist less than a quarter of a way through the movie and it is reinforced by the imagery and conversations we see both before and after she says it. Near the end of the film that same therapist tells them that marriage is about battling through obstacles by battling together. Why reduce all of this to “two gorgeous people in this situation” and “boys vs girls”? In an interview with Entertainment Weekly Maya Erskine said “Angelina and Brad are untouchable in that you can't recreate that and Donald and I are just so different it felt exciting to play a couple that you might recognize as your friends or yourselves”. Tabling the fact that I don't agree with the idea that you can't recognize your friends or your selves in Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie simply because they look good or are incredibly cool people - underneath these words is that ever present suggestion that by the mere fact of being beautiful, you lack profundity. That particular idea comes out clearly in the wash of this show. Later Erskine says; “No, I'm kidding I obviously couldn't be further from her. I tend to play characters that feel like the rejects of society, and my Jane felt like it was a reject version of Angelina, it wouldn't ever be her it couldn't be”. That sentence is representative, of a repeated theme in these interviews and by consequence the show that suggests that they are doing something that is not present in the previous adaptation or the actors in it, when in actuality it is very present in both. It makes a lot of what's said feel pretentious and guarded, which at times is what the show felt like too. The “I tend to play characters that feel like the rejects of society” implies a difference that doesn't exist. In actual fact that defines Jolie's career as well, in “Gia”, in “Hackers”, in “Girl Interrupted”, in “Gone in 60 seconds” and more. When you get wrong what it is that may need correcting, adding, or improvement in a project, then usually, you end up with something worse than.\n\nIf the goal was to dress this thing down, to make it something more akin to reality, (nothing in movies is ever a true reality) the pathway to that was made very clear in something like 2011’s “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy”. In Tomas Alfredson’s hazy adaptation of Le Carré’s story every single aspect feels like a repudiation of everything cool about spy movies. The clothes are lovingly austere, the locales poetically mundane, the photography is strikingly drab, each item so uncool that they reach out, wrap around and somehow end up right back at being cool. Mr. and Mrs. Smith would have been far more interesting if Glover would have accepted that and joined in with Sloane and the rest of the co-creators to try to create something that truly acknowledges and embraced that un-cool or embraced that he wants to be “it” and maybe more importantly why he wants be “it”. It's an inferiority complex that as a consequence creates a superiority complex. This finds its way into Mr. and Mrs. Smith by way of it's acceptance of the most banal ideas of beauty represented in its vehicles, in the clothing, and represented in the inflated sense of depth as it pertains to the shows discussions of relationship dynamics. Most of what this show aims to do relationship-wise as stated was already accomplished by FX’s brilliant “The Americans”, and done a thousand times better. John's insecurities around manhood and masculinity are interesting bullet points in the show, but never become a full treatise. The hunting, the therapy, the asthma. It shows them, it brings them up, it jots a note down, but it doesn't have anywhere near the kind of depth or complexity displayed in how The Americans drew and handled some of the very same issues around masculinity and having your better be your female partner in Matthew Rhys’s “Phil Jennings”. Its only slightly more complex than the original. Most of what Mr. and Mrs. Smith seeks to subvert as a show about spies, or as a show about relationships is either common, superficial, boring, or try hard, especially the action. What is left after both the cool and the un-cool fail is a show that wasted alot of its talent, it's locales, it's subjects, and is neither as deep as it thinks it is, or as cool as it thinks it is. Bland and tasteless, a box of grape nuts.\n\nMimicry is a superficial recreation of the most commonly recognized (and many times stereotypical) aspects of a person(s) or thing. It is an impoverished version of imitation mostly due to the fact that it is not knowledgeable of the subject and is sometimes willfully ignorant about it, because underneath it is a conflict between disdain and admiration for person (s) or a thing. Charlie Sheen's diatribe to Chris Tucker in “Money Talks” which includes the words “G posse on a fly tip” is a great example. It is impoverished because you can tell hes never been around black folk and even while admiring them on some level doesn't like them either. Donald Glover, Francesca Sloane, and the shows other authors suffer from a lack of reckoning with their conflicted feelings about cool and about beauty. Consequently that lack of a reckoning is what pulls the rug out from under their attempt for this deeper show they were clearly so intent on creating. You can't claim to distance yourself from something you're so obviously trying to recreate. If you're trying so hard to distance yourself from what they created, why are you dressing like them? Why are you so manicured? Why is everything around you so adherent to the most normalized ideas of beauty from cars to clothes to homes? Why not admit that you thought Brad Pitt looked awfully good in those form-fitted sweaters and shirts and that you tried to recreate that? Why not lend something to what you clearly liked other than backhanded compliments about their movie stardom? Why not go for the aesthetics and values in Apple TV’s Gary Oldman starrer “Slow Horses” and Season 1’s lack of alot of gun violence and action? Why have the far more unique idea of a wife who just refuses to have children and stands on that ground and all that could spring forth out of that, rather than copping out and having her admit she actually wants them while on truth serum? You went to the school dance and you don't fit in and so your knee-jerk reaction is to claim that the cool kids and the beautiful people are dumb and superficial, even while you came in your best tuxedo, asked your mom for those new Jordans, and tried to talk to the cheerleader. In that way the show doesn't really do what so many of the quotes from the interview claim it set out to do which is defy the status quo of this genre and of the people in these relationships, it merely gives the pretense of it. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is not reimagining anything. It's not reinventing, nor challenging anything in the genre or from that film, it's just poorly mimicking both and passing itself off as more because they're not the “beautiful people” and that's pretty shallow.\n\nMaestro: Men at a Distance\n\nWe open with the words of Leonard Bernstein; “A work of art does not answer questions, it provokes them and it's essential meaning is an tension between the contradictory answers”. They are meant to function as both as a guide into understanding Bernstein and to understanding Director Bradley Cooper’s intention for this film. I left it wondering if it had accomplished either. There is a desire to reckon with a man, a desire to reckon with the distance between us and him, and most importantly it's director and him, that unconsciously sits in the womb of the entire movie, but is never birthed, and thus I left the movie stunted. Disconnected from any deep feelings of emotion or intellectual revelation and/or connection. I was left at a distance from Cooper’s authenticity and consequently from his subjects.\n\nThe tensions between these distances are most certainly presented, or at least they are talked about or mentioned a lot. Between his work life and home life, his straight marriage to Felicia Montealegre, and his queer selfhood, between his authentic self and the performer. The latter is the aspect most presented within this movie. It's in his words to a reporter, his words to trusted friends, it's in his sometimes overhearing need to share, and his over bearing needs which can “swallow up” those around him as Felicia says in one climactic argument. He is in constant performance, whether in show, in love, or in conversation, and it is the friction between that performance and his actual self the movie tries to reckon with, but also seems afraid to come close to. The other aforementioned tensions are merely dressing to the dressing, and in concert with this very ostentatious cavalcade of technique and the artifice of craft and genius, it gives one the feeling that you visited a grand costume ball that had absolutely little to no meaning save to prove the ability of the person throwing it. For a movie about love, there is very little in it. There is loyalty, and lots of understanding, and respect, words thrown at you at 100 miles per hour, camera movements to astound you, close ups, and pulls, wide shots and all other manner of accoutrements that are meant to accentuate this supposed story of the tensions on creativity, brilliance, and selfhood, but not love. The problem is all of these apparatuses serve to distance you from the subject and the music rather than bring you closer into. Instead of hugging us, Maestro’s incessant plays for prestige shrug us off. One scene has Bernstein being sort of cautiously nudged by a man he has a deep respect for to hide his name, one feels like this may be an entry way to a story about the tension in the sometimes short, sometimes long distances between Bernstein's (and really any non-white protestant male) Jewish identity and his very American success, but before we can even acknowledge what we are watching, Mulligan's Felicia is whispering into his ear to be his authentic self and whisking him off into their love story presented with an over head bird-eye shot that whips us into an entirely different space both physically and mentally. It's not a bad choice, falling in love can feel alot like this, but love isolated in a vacuum is not a story, the story is in its relation to subjects, it's distance from them -to them, so we still need to see how it is found between these two subjects, but before we can appreciate their love story we are treated to a flamboyantly shot dance scene with no actual flamboyance most especially when Cooper enters the scene ( a dancer he is not). The point here being tensions are presented in the same way a child may reply “present” during roll call, but they are not reckoned with, consolidated, or interstitched in any meaningful way. This all happens as Bernstein's queer life is as quietly placed into storage in the movie as it is depicted it was in his life.\n\nBernstein's queer-ness feels like an unfortunate aside, like bait to get is into caring about his all encompassing precarious but sweet love for Felicia and not just because of how little screen time they're given, but because whenever his sexuality does show up it feels as if the investment is cheap and disinterested. Matt Bomer’s David Oppenheim is not a fully realized person at all, he is a series of reactions stacked on top of each other in an overcoat pretending to look like one. We see him and are made privy to stifled butt taps, stiff kisses, and looks that are meant to communicate the subtext of longing, and laughs, but there is nothing there, in commentary or chemistry. His other trysts and affairs are not given enough time or energy to create friction, they merely pass by without rubbing up against. When they are intimate it seems so contrived and forced , I half expected to see Cooper wipe the kisses off after. There is no sensuality there, no fire. To be fair, it is the same with he and Felicia's relationship, but it's just that much more noticable when the foundation is next to nothing. Save for the beginning, we only see his queer lovers to see how they draw Felicia's ire. They seem to exist in a very rigid “either/or” of friendly, or implied sexual nature (sex itself is off limits) but there is not a modicum of the depth and nuance afforded his straight relationship. How can we reckon with Bernstein's “authentic self” when such a massive part of it is so obviously treated with petit disdain?\n\nCooper's film is at its best when it is focused on the silences, the unsaid between the beloved couple. When the distance it maintains from each, actually serves it's emotional objectives, and when it focuses on Carey Mulligans outstanding performance. In an over the shoulder shot of Mulligan peering out from underneath her facade of shiny acceptance to reveal her natural jealousy over the moments Leonard shares with his paramour, you feel as if she is a thousand miles away. The deafening silence in a room after an argument as a balloon passed a window from the parade outside, betrays a dire loneliness in both of them. The distance between the camera and Leonard and Felecia as the camera sits well outside the fence of the pool area from which they try and talk about what is going on between them, and a close up of Mulligan in a monologue detailing her revelation that the woman she claimed to be was merely a conjured ideal to try and reconcile her love for the entirety of Bernstein with her organic sense of possession. These are scenes where I felt strongest that the movie was near accomplishing it's goal of reckoning with these tensions without answering them or preaching them to its audience. It was most distracted when it focused on its own obtrusive beauty and Coopers equally showy performance. Let me be clear, I did not like Cooper's performance. It is without a doubt the most distracting aspect of this film, and one of the worst in contention for an Oscar in recent history. Sure it is fervently ambitious, and there is detail, and I do see love there. Cooper's own tension as an artist I believe are a mirror image of sorts to the Bernstein he sees, and in moments Cooper's own vulnerabilities shine, but there are moments where that ambition and that desire overtake and choke out any ability to actually connect with Bernstein. It is an aggressively nasally performance, in which everything extends out from Bernstein's nose. A lot was made of that nose in particular, and while I don't agree with the takes that were presented to try and paint this as somewhat anti-Semitic, the focus is a poor choice to decide that this is where Bernstein vocally, in some ways spiritually speaks to us from. You have the prosthetic nature of the nose, but you also have the fact that Cooper is speaking through it to try and imitate Bernstein's vocal tenor. The experiment is a cinematic failure, it doesn't serve to bring intimacy between the audience and Leonard, but rather it distances us, constantly reminding us that this is Bradley Cooper playing Leonard Bernstein. We are supposed to say “My god he has really channeled this man” but best I can give is “Look how hard he is trying”. The gestures and the movements feel accurate enough, true enough, but everything coming from the inside reeks of effort that we should not be seeing, and in this veers it into the realm of Oscar bait. Once again this is also a place where the silences are the best. A scene where he has to put a pillow to his mouth to muffle his tear filled grief, a concert hall scene, (maybe the only) that in its movements , along with Cooper's show Bernstein's love and affinity for the music he was making even while Cooper himself is silent.\n\nThis is not a film that (as it states in the beginning) in any way sticks to one's bones to reckon with the tensions and agitations it is happy just to put on display. Its a movie that puts the clothing in the window to draw the eye, but the door to the store is locked. I came into the movie knowing very little about Bernstein and I came out of the movie still knowing very little about Bernstein. I came in very far removed from him, and left only a few steps closer, enough to we that he lived his wife deeply. If that was the movies one true goal it is fine enough of a goal, but those opening words in the quote do not speak to simply a complicated love story, but to something more, much more. A complicated man, a complicated genius, living in a complicated world in a complicated body. Cooper and co. seem to misunderstand and mistake the presentation of complexity as the expression of complexity. The complexity on display is banal, it's just presented with the sort of pomp that makes it seem like more. I wish more of the movie was like those scenes of silence. I wish the movie had the agitative daring of Mulligan’s compartmentalized performance. I wish Bernstein’s queer self was more welcome to the party, and I wish someone else was playing Bernstein instead of Cooper to allow Cooper to remain completely and totally married to the man, the subject, from the perspective he most seems comfortable with …a distance.\n\n“All Truth is Crooked, Time istelf is a Circle”.\n\nA room full of anxious unsure black men sit in a dark room with almost no identifiable tokens of place or time or identity even, save for their clothing which could still pass for a number of time periods. One by one they will renounce their own languages, and with them their very identity, - I immediately recall the words of Franz Fanon “A man who has a language consequently possesses the world expressed and implied by that language”. After all of these black faces (and one seemingly white face, who is later revealed to be mixed race) another white man appears, he is shot profile, and he has on the garb of the church, he is the first identifier of the possibility of space (the church). His first words; “To live with Christ is to love God and man”. I ask myself what kind of love would ask of people to shed themselves of the things that make them who they are? The irony is intentional. Hondo like Fanon is acutely aware of what is being asked and what the consequences of the asks are. Hondo is also aware that to stamp a date, to make clear the space, place, time, is to create a distance and he is not interested in distance, nor time, to be clear he is not very much interested in the presentation of “factual”.\n\nThe film is a series of juxtapositions made stronger and more agitating by their inability to reach any compromise with truth, with morality, with time. As the film is semi autobiographical this too is intentional as it connects the personal to the political. The personal being Hondo's experiences in a number of professions, and his experience with the country who overseered under the rouge of a sort of national adoption. The attitude, the documentation of colonization and imperialism and it's consequences, the agitation present in “Soleil O” reminded me of Costa-Gavras's “Z” (1969) and Ousmane Sembene’s “Ceddo” (1977). The period within these films take place, the lack of compromise in plot, craft, and commentary, the usage of technique and style to frustrate, stir, and indict audience and empire alike are all pervasively present, but maybe more than anything is the way in which these films play with time.\n\nIn Sembéne’s “Ceddo” a date is never said or mentioned, we have only a vague idea what period this takes place in, based off of costume and technology, but not much else. This is again intentional, as the lack of date implies the flux, or continuum of the behaviors and strategies on display. In Sembéne’s own words; “I can’t give a date. These events occurred in the 18th and 19th century and are still occurring”. In the epilogue of Gavras’s “Z” a reporter gives the news chronicling the events that happened beyond the reach of the film, when suddenly he too disappears as we find out he too was murdered from the voice of a woman. The time of his death is not acknowledged, the time that lives in between his absence is not acknowledged, because again time is not relevant to the actors nor the actions. In Hondo’s “Soleil O” we see a similar tactic to Sembéne's where a time is implied but never stated and in his film we jump forward and back through time with no announcement or confirmation. One could be the other, the other the one. Uniforms change, clothing changes, but as with “Ceddo” ( which means the outsiders) the behaviors and strategies remain the same. “All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle”. The Nietzsche quote is not an argument as much as an invite to agitation and question. Time is meant to signal a great deal of things but in the historical context it is many times used to signal the beginning and ending of things. In that way time (a construct itself ) is a useful tool in the construction of propaganda and of a false sense of historicity that assumes that events of the past lived and died there, and the purveyors of it depend on that assumption. The radical nature of these films lie not only in the purity of the fire of their anger, or the straight forward force of their dedication to a deconstruction of truth, but in their resistance to the framework of time that allows the audience the peace of mind that comes with knowing this is not the here, the now, nor the present. Extending out beyond even the now of our own events (see Gaza, Congo, Tigray, Sudan, Haiti) to imply the future in the space of time between when these films were made, when the events occured and now, which then leaves the audience with no safe place to go save to action.\n\nA Reckoning, but not thee Reckoning”\n\n“It is a reckoning, but maybe not the reckoning I needed or wanted” were the words that came to me what would have been about midway through the movie and persisted until the very end. Sitting in the dark as I heard Lily Gladstone’s primal scream of bereavement and unrequited anger, I felt it beating through my chest and head like a drum. I do not think Scorsese or subsequently his film is afraid to go where he needs to go, say what needs to be said, show what may need to be shown. It's a film indicative of all of Scorcese's powers, and Thelma Schoonmaker’s too for that matter. The issue here is the issue that has ever been, which is that it is being told from the perspective of a white person. In the sense of who's directing it, in the sense of who's starring in it, and in the sense of whose perspective is most being represented. This conundrum haunts and elevates the movie simultaneously. It's inertia, it's profundity all live in the places where it is strong and where it is weak, and where the movie is strong and where the movie is weak lives in its perspectives.\n\nThe movie most closely takes on the appearance of a masterpiece (if not outright one) when you examine it from the angle that they (the white folks ) are the wolves. Scorcese’s film in its entirety gave me the feeling of watching one of those movies where they have the graphic for the way a virus begins to eat up cells over time, or even better a pandemic film where they have the electronic map show in elapsed time how rapidly a virus will spread. We start out with the near lack of existence of whites in Osage, and the markers of success and community amongst a native population made rich by the oil under their land, (even while we see in their appearance and spending the tokens and golems of white supremacy) and by the time we are near finished we see DiCaprio's Ernest Buckhart sitting in a room where he previously sat, which then was made up of mostly Osage people, now almost completely White. This imagery bookending either side of the film as well as a rather vast timeline of multiple murders and vicious animus through banal faces is jarring. The beginning of the mysterious rot (wasting disease AKA White People) and extraction of the Osage wealth is already in effect, by the time Burkhart arrives, but his presence will at the very least make it personal for Mollie (A phenomenal Lily Gladstone) an Osage woman whose life becomes a living hell upon meeting Ernest Burkhart. Even the title then, most especially in imagery begins to take shape. Through Ernest’s uncle William King Hale (Robert DeNiro) and his conglomerate of ne’er do wells, ambitious boot lickers, psychopaths, and morons, we see the killers, we see the physical terror, the existential terror, the ecological terror, both malevolent and benign. “Friends” are shot in the head from behind as they commiserate or watch over their baby, and white overseers watch over and control Osage money, Osage spending, even though it's Osage money! No police are ever brought in, we repeatedly hear how “no one cares” about the deaths of Indians” a double scoop of apathy and mockery. The murders are sanctioned both explicitly and implicitly, the apathy comes standard. We watch as white supremacy slowly waves it's collective shadowy hand over the lives of these people and their land darkening everything in their path with blood, greed, cruelty, and more blood. We see clearly how so many of the lies then, connect directly to the systems now, with the lies now transformed into law, tradition, and possession. The first half of Killers of the Flower Moon is the best half of this movie precisely because of the choice to go in from the perspective of the wolves, to let us see what the wolves see. Scorcese's willingness to dive into and portray the animus, the audacity of the mendacity, and frankly the stupidity on display is so sharp and fresh as to take you there in the flesh, and it is frightening especially because the movie isn't afraid to show sternly, truthfully, and without romance the depravity of it. In combination with the fact that even while it is still being told from the perspective of the wolves, it is more multidirectional than the second half of the film, this trapeze act of empathy, and truth, storytelling, and capital is absolutely stunning. It moves in waves from one perspective to another, balancing Osage and White narratives of the seemingly innocuous interactions that doom an entire people. The small things matter here, like the inherent commentary in the words voiced by a self aware, but also still white co conspirator when Leo tries to recruit him into service of a dastardly act “Why you always trying to get someone like me to do your work?”. It is the half of the film I most enjoyed and found to be the most brilliant. We see and hear a lot more from Mollie in the first half or so. Her joys, her reserve, her intelligence. We see the town, more specifically, the portrayal of what the town was before much white involvement, the integrity of it; to show mother's that have favorites, secrets that are kept by good women, alcoholic sisters who are short tempered, and depressed men, searching for reasons to live, even while they are rich, and now themselves a petit bourgeois class amongst their ethnicity is an important counter to victimized cinema that not only paints victimhood as an identity, (which is also caricaturization) but also reinforces the idea that victims have to be perfect, saintly. The portrayal of the decimation of an entire group of people so callous and disturbing it appears as nothing more than the rising of the sun, in juxtaposition with the banality of tactics used to murder, the slow drip of genocidal mania and the consistent re-creation of it with almost no residual effect on those who schemed and plotted it is all too close to home as we witness what is going on with Israel and the US backed decimation of Palestine and Palestinian peoples. Scorsese is as plain as we've ever seen him even while still he maintains his visual audacity. He's quieter here, more restrained. He rarely intervenes, interjects, or distracts us with the watermarks of his signature style, and the movie benefits from that. He's concerned here with letting us see with as few frills as possible, the plain wretchedness and decay inherent in the white supremacist enterprise, and juxtaposes that lovingly with the hearts, humor, pain, philosophy and spirituality of the Osage community. Never once condescending to them, most especially the women. The best representation of the latter, the one I believe is going to stick with me for quite some time; is the death of Mollie's mother (Tantoo Cardinal ) and the tangential pause that Scorsese takes to honor her meeting with the ancestors. The simplicity of it, the unceremonious nature of it, the lack of invasive ego in it. It represents in a microcosm so much of why Scorsese is so beloved in the film community, and the legitimacy of Scorcese's intent and ability in his work and especially in this film.\n\nIts a third of the way through and I am reminded of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's “Can the Subaltern Speak?” the conclusion of which arrives at the same place as I did at the end of this film. I was left considering all the ways in which the hegemony of power in storytelling as it concerns the medium of film - prevents all but a very privileged few the right to speak to their own pain in the making of this colonial project turned empire. The obstructions present in the film, are present in the reality outside of it, and in the making of it. A white perspective is nonetheless a white perspective, and no matter the level of mastery on display, (and the level here is arguably as high as it could go considering) it is still what historian Michel -Rolph Trouillot calls a silence. A sort of confluence of variables that assist in the obstruction and impediment of the ownership of the narrative from the POV of anyone but those in power, which then leaves a silencing that passes down through history. The second half of this movie - where it begins to turn into more of a police procedural - is an example of this, as the combination of variables like profit needs, the star of the movie, running time, for example, shift the perspective almost completely to that of the white man and men around Mollie and her people, leaving their voices only to be heard in suffering. It is a scale size model of the original trauma and as such is evidence of the cracks, crevices, nooks, and crannies created by the lack of precision, the lack of understanding, inherent in a perspective outside the veil of something one can never fully be immersed in or touch. This is the portion of the movie where if anything it would have benefited strongly from a shift straight into Mollie's perspective. When I say Mollie's perspective I do not mean change the story much, nor that she should have had all the scenes that they gave to Leonardo DiCaprio, it means that all the events that we are seeing should be seen from a perspective that clearly is watching the precedings with an invisible eye from the marginalized position, imagine for example what Mel Gibson’s “Apocalypto” would look like if a sequel took place right from that ending, fulfilling the promise of its conciets by being written and directed by indigenous people. In Killers, it's hard enough to gauge what it was about Ernest that Mollie fell so in love with in the first place, but by the second or third the procedural aspect will eschew experience for process and beats familiar to true crime. How the Osage and more specifically Mollie feels in all this is a bit obscured. The portions that would feed much of what she can see, observe, and what she can feel, as we saw with Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan's earlier release “Oppenheimer” are all but gone. We should still be able to watch all that's going on with DiCaprio, but with a lean toward viewing from her perspective, whether by voiceover, suggestive camera eye, or exposition and language. The Osage people’s decimation is Mollie's. She is a microcosm of their collective pain. Dealt one heavy blow after another, as the people with whom she shared close and intimate communal space with are murdered one by one. The first half (which in actuality might be more like three-quarters) was adept at this. We have voice-overs from Mollie’s perspective, we sometimes see through her eyes as she makes her way through crowds of white faces in the midst of contemptible peering. We get moments spent with her family laughing , gossiping, sharing. The third act appears and we can see the walls closing in on the Ernest and Hale and it is at this point that it becomes most clear in the movie that the fluctuating struggle in the relationship between the movies need for Leonardo DiCaprio and DeNiro to be the star and the importance of the story and it's subjects POV are at cross purposes. DiCaprio's character and his cohorts all but erased the agency and existence of a people who had already been beset by numerous tragedies in their upheaval from their original homes to this place -the need for the procedural aspect to follow the line of criminals to their rightful end overshadows the alternative need to hear from those most affected. I found myself asking what is she thinking, through all this? I realize she is getting sicker and sicker but a few scenes from the perspective of her in that bed, a few scenes about her grief, a few scenes about where and when she can find reprieve to go on, joy to stand, would've increased the power of everything else for me. I wrote “She has to know something is up, but she is also dead in the center of it unknowingly, it puts her in the eye of the storm, ignorant and yet at least unconsciously aware of what is happening and being created as around her” but I had to guess at all of it. I didn't want answers, I just wanted scenes where she was either directly or indirectly was prioritized, or that her perspective of these events was being represented to a degree that would then allow me to make my own conclusions about what is happening. Mollie keeps getting sicker, these strange men keep insisting on strange amendments to her treatment, her husband is growing further and further apart, her forest is becoming a pile of ash, and as her husband makes fun of her culture and her heritage to get her to take the poison that is killing her, she comforts him. It is sickening to watch, not much less to recall, and by the end I left wanting so much more from her, especially in lieu of the revelation of her husband's consistent role in all this. I love the idea of the movie taking place from the eyes of the wolves as it concerns the enterprise and the scourge, but when we got to Ernest and Mollie I wanted that perspective benched. Watching a movie about Tina Turner from Ike's perspective is not appealing to me. Returning to Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” another movie that contends with the massive weight of destruction at the behest of imperial and colonial forces as executed by a useful idiot - we see how all these events crashed and honed in on Oppenheimer, as it assails his role in it. As I wrote before in my piece on that film, there is a visceral anger directed at Robert, one that finds voice in the character of Emily Blunt. Here our anger finds no voice, and Mollie doesn't either. Can the Subaltern Speak? We should have been made to feel her world getting smaller as so many of these murders were of direct family members. Made to live in the amount of grief she had to be going through at that moment at that time, in the same way we are made to live in Oppenheimer’s persecution, shame and guilt, in Ernest’s shame and guilt? It is not that these things are completely erased or non-existent within the film it is that they are from the distanced, retracted, and reductive perspective of an outsider, which cannot be helped for the most part, and what parts can, are part of the inherent flaws of the ask.\n\nIn those movies about infections -and as a consequence zombies, - we are engaged in those films from the perspective of those who are besieged. The Mist, The Fog, the blood transfers, they corrode, corrupt, cause decay, destroy and we watch how those left behind cope. I don't see those stories as being much different from this. The effects of white supremacy, colonialism, imperialism, consumerism are much like what is depicted in those films. It is well documented many of them are commenting thematically on those very subjects. John Carpenter’s “The Fog” is pretty easily framed as one such commentary with its meditations on the costs of genocide, it's insistence on accountability and it's depiction of how the denizens and edifices benefitted both then and now from barbarity in a nearly all white town. It too is from the perspective of the wolves as they are being attacked by the avatars of their ancestral harm and their collective guilt. These stories and this story are similar in their tale of devastation. One day you're at home cuddling with your husband and the next your entire family is dead and so is the entire community from which you lived from which you had formed bonds and connected with folks and we see what the effect of that is on those who are left over, (That is the plot for Dawn of the Dead by the way) my point being, even though the subject matter is similar, these films center the besieged, not the horde, the besieged are understood to be universal, the “other” is the horde. What happens when you depict the horde and the horde is the storyteller? Are they the horde if they are the storytellers? Never mind that the size and proportion of white guilt is an obstruction to their ability to see fully the ways in which they have harmed irreparably the peace and agency of an entire ecosystem and people, there is also the natural obstructions created by history and the lack of on the part of those who have had history imposed upon them. If the idea is to see us, hear us, feel us, as every bit the equal of all peoples - to reiterate our position as both one and “other”, depicting truthfully the savagery of the those who labeled others “savages” is noble, and real, and so too is depicting the history of those who were silenced both before and after and in the between. Depicting the anger, the frustration, the intimate pleasures of our existence apart from the tragedy of our oppression. In that spirit the moral complexity of a man knowingly aiding a genocidal act cannot be so lopsidedly intertwined with the anxieties of the woman who lives with it, and whatever the reasons behind the decision it takes a distant, distant, distant second to my supreme interest in any aspect of what Mollie's inner life must’ve been at these points in her life, especially considering what Lily Gladstone is doing in this movie with her performance. It should not be left to the eyes of Lily Gladstone only, and in fits and starts to give us clues as to her interiority. Mollie is not yet bed ridden, she's not the ghost of herself she eventually becomes, but the sickness has clearly taken effect, and at this point in my mind, I asked “What are her dreams like now?” When she's alone with nothing but her grief, her thoughts, her racing mind, what does she see?…Is it just the owl when it comes for her life?”. “When it crosses her mind that her husband might be apart of this, what does that feel like for her?” “What is she wrestling with” What about her, what about her, what about her, go back to her”. One of the most vivid representations of this happened near the end of the movie when their child dies. We get a few seconds of Molly leaning over her child, but when Ernest finds out we linger, we sit with how deeply this hurts and affects him. It's a gut punch of a scene that DiCaprio acts without a single shred of ego or protection, and it lays bare the fallout of his avarice and deceptions, including ones of the self, but it was all about him, the only place with which Scorcese and DiCaprio could seemingly find success in putting this story together was in the relationship between Ernest and Mollie, so why does it feel like Ernest story, not theirs? Scorcese in a wonderful interview with critic luminary Richard Brody talks about the trouble he had getting into this story, and ultimately it is Leo who finds it in the relationship between Ernest and Mollie, yet that relationship isn't exactly detailed, nor followed intently. Now, the fact that “they were in Love” is something uttered by the descendants of Burkhart to Scorcese in the process of finding the story is instructional as it is, but there is also the fact that the core parts of strictly-on-paper story telling is mostly taking place without the aid of the Osage people of today and those facts obscure and hazy in the first three quarters of the film, become transparent in the final portion. Ernest’s righteousness at the end, his moral wrestling, and his supposed befuddlement and reckoning at the fact that he has played a knowingly active role in eviscerating his life, and the life of the woman whom he claimed to love being accepted as genuine seemingly without question is a perfect representation of why we talk so much about giving these kinds of opportunities to those who have a direct cultural understanding of them. The idea should not be that no one of any identity but the identity being represented should be able to tell these stories, but simply that these stories are BEST told when told by those who share the cultural markers and identity around it, and that the real story is in the spaces and areas in between and outside of rigid concepts like righteousness and morality (the latter of which I'm in no way accusing Scorcese of pandering to). That it's best when we speak, because when it's us we don't have to think about perspective we are it. You're asking people outside of those communities to do something that is foreign to them, especially if those people are part of the fabric of the group that maintains hegemony and power through it. Simply stating that fact should not be controversial, but I have a sense that it will become controversial once this movie starts making its rounds. Especially those for whom it's easy to kick the can down the road to some magical, but unspecified time in the future where we will be able to tell our own stories. It's not Scorsese's fault that white supremacy is so inextricable from our institutions that it makes telling stories about it from the POV of the oppressed feel near impossible, but it nonetheless comes with all the accoutrements that come with being considered in the fabric of whiteness. The fact that he is interested in this story, the fact that he dedicated what had to be considerable time and energy to get it out there, and to make sure that it was told in a way that maintains such overall integrity in its depiction of visceral cruelty in such veracious detail should be commended, and highly, but it should also be consistently and constantly tied to the “why” behind it. The idea that Hollywood thinks or will only allow him to be the one in the first place. If we do not (as a recent article explained by way of data and experience) accept that white leads are vital to a movie selling, then why accept that white directors or white writers are needed? Scorsese who has worked long enough as a white man, who is mastered as a craftsman and trusted as selling point is so as a result of opportunities he received(s) in part because he's an artistic genius and in part because he's white. Who can sell, what can sell, cannot be left to the collective racist feelings of Hollywood executives unchallenged, even when the chosen champion is arguably our greatest living director, and a champion of all perspectives of cinema from his own individual perspective. Hollywood executives insistence that these stories need a white lead, or white storyteller in order to bring "
