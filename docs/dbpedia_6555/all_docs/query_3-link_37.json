        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the gold standard in kettlebell education—and the #1 certification for strength and conditioning professionals.\n\nTwo decades ago, the first kettlebell cert developed by Pavel Tsatsouline did a lot more than put the Russian kettlebell on the world map. It shook up the complacent trainer education industry. Instead of spewing sciency trivia useless in the trenches and coddling the students with multiple choice questions, this disruptive school taught lifting skills with military precision—and rigorously tested them. Unheard of until then, the candidates had to test their spirit in grueling workouts, pass strength tests, and demonstrate their teaching ability. While at it, they bonded through a shared challenge and often became friends for life.\n\nSince then, while others were attempting to catch up and imitate what Pavel and his team had done, we kept advancing. Polishing the chrome of our lifting and teaching skills. Perfecting our programming with the best of Russian and Western sports science. Doubling down on our commitment to George Hackenschmidt’s maxim: “Strength cannot be divorced from health.”\n\nEnter SFG, the constantly updated and refined version of Pavel’s original kettlebell cert—20 years and over 30 editions of the instructor manual later and still light years ahead of everyone else.\n\nSFG—“G” for girya, or kettlebell—is StrongFirst’s flagship certification. While strength is the focus of our school at large, SFG pursues broader “extreme fitness” and resilience with strength at its foundation. Like every StrongFirst instructor certification—kettlebell, barbell, bodyweight—SFG strongly stands on its own—while all perfectly fit together into a system.\n\nAn unequalled strength and conditioning system\n\nDesigned to meet the most rugged demands\n\nTested in the harshest military and athletic environments—over and over\n\nAccepting no compromise between performance and longevity\n\nTaught by an elite instructor team, including national team coaches and doctors and other high-end professionals\n\nLifting skills taught with military precision\n\nAn inch wide and a mile deep—six foundational kettlebell exercises drilled to perfection:\n\nSwing\n\nGet-up\n\nClean\n\nPress\n\nSnatch\n\nSquat\n\nRegressions and progressions to suit any of your students, from couch potatoes to world class athletes and tier one military operators\n\nPowerful programming—based on hard science, easy to implement\n\nA 3-day event that demands serious preparation by trained athletes\n\nRigorous testing—a 30% failure rate is common among well prepared candidates\n\nA lifetime global brotherhood and sisterhood of strength\n\nIs the SFG I instructor certification right for you?\n\nOnly if you check at least one of these boxes:\n\nA coach who will accept nothing but the best training methods\n\nA warfighter seeking a PT method that can be described in Hemingway’s words: ”Keenness of edge…simplicity of action”\n\nAn athlete ready to take his or her performance to an all-new level\n\nA personal development fanatic\n\nA hard living type looking for your next challenge\n\nOnly those with grit and attention to detail need to apply.\n\nSign up today and power to you!"
