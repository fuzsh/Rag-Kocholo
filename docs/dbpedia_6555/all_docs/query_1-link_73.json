        "text": "\"This is an unsanctioned, unauthorized mission.\" Lionsgate has revealed an official trailer for Guy Ritchie's new WWII action film titled The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, arriving in theaters this April. Ritchie already deliver another war film last year with The Covenant, and also has The Gentlemen series coming up, now he's heading back to WWII to tell the origin story of covert Black Ops missions. The British military recruits a small group of highly-skilled soldiers to strike against Nazi forces behind enemy lines. Billed as a true story about a secret British World War II organization: the Special Operations Executive. Founded by Winston Churchill, their irregular warfare against the Nazis helped to change the course of the war and gave birth to modern black operations. The massive ensemble cast features Henry Cavill as Gus March-Phillips, with Eiza González, Alan Ritchson, Henry Golding, Alex Pettyfer, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Babs Olusanmokun, Til Schweiger, Cary Elwes, Fisher Stevens, Danny Sapani, Freddie Fox. This looks like a blast! A great cast delivering some crazy cool moments while taking out tons of Nazis.\n\nHere's the official trailer for Guy Ritchie's The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, from YouTube:"
