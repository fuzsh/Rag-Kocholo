        "text": "This semester I am teaching an elective on musicals, which the final presentation on Howard Ashman in this past fall’s elective on Disney provides a nice segue for. Recruited from Broadway after the success of his musical Little Shop of Horrors, Ashman initiated the Disney renaissance era by incorporating Broadway’s musical formula into animation in his work on The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). After single-handedly renovating Times Square and flipping these Broadway-inspired animated movie musicals back into successful stage musicals, Disney has since tried to replicate this pattern of success by recruiting Hamilton auteur Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nThis past Christmas the movie musical The Color Purple (2023) was released, giving us the fourth iteration of this narrative by way of an adaptation of the Broadway show (2005/2015) that was an adaptation of the movie directed by Steven Spielberg (1985) that was an adaptation of Alice Walker’s Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel (1983). Or rather the Broadway show is an adaptation of the novel and the movie; its summary on Wikipedia shows it includes elements of the novel that neither movie does. Notably, Quincy Jones and Oprah Winfrey have been involved in all three adaptations of Walker’s story. Walker was involved in the production of the movies but does not appear to have been involved in the Broadway productions.\n\nSummary:\n\nWhile the novel is told in the epistolary form of letters that the 1985 version adapts via voiceover, the 2023 movie dispenses with this element. The basic story in a nutshell in all versions is that the main character, Celie, has two children by the man she believes is her father, but her father takes the children from her so their whereabouts are unknown by the time he marries her off to a man who goes by “Mister,” who actually wanted to marry Celie’s sister Nettie. Nettie shows up at Mister’s and Celie’s after their father starts abusing her, but when Nettie rejects Mister’s advances, he throws her out, with Nettie promising Celie she’ll write every day as she departs. Mister guards the mailbox, however, and Celie never gets any letters and years pass as she raises Mister’s children, including Harpo, who marries a spirited woman named Sofia who shortly leaves him when he attempts to beat her to get her to obey him as his father does to Celie. Harpo builds a juke joint on some swampland, and Shug Avery, a blues singer Mister says is the woman he should have married, visits and performs there. Shug and Celie bond during Shug’s visit. In an interim when Shug is gone, Sofia gets into an altercation with the mayor’s wife when she refuses a job offer to be her maid, and is imprisoned for six years. When Shug visits Mister’s again, showing up with a husband in tow, she checks the mail and finds a letter from Nettie to Celie revealing she’s alive and in Africa with a missionary couple who ended up adopting Celie’s two children when they couldn’t have any of their own, prompting Shug and Celie to search the house and find the rest of Nettie’s letters that Mister’s been hiding. At a big family dinner, Shug tells Mister that Celie is going back to Memphis with her and her husband, and Celie rebukes Mister for taking Nettie away her, telling him everything he thinks about will crumble until he does right by her (the confrontation revives Sofia, whose spirit has been broken by her ordeal, and Harpo’s girlfriend decides to go to Memphis as well). When the man Celie thought was her father dies, she learns that he is not her blood father but her stepfather, and that her real father left her and Nettie land and a shop that Celie uses to sell pants that she makes. Shug reconciles with her disapproving father, who is a reverend. Mister deteriorates until he gets a letter from Nettie to Celie noting they need to prove their citizenship to return to America because their papers were destroyed, and he pays the immigration service the necessary fees. Nettie returns home with Celie’s grown children in tow, and all are reunited.\n\nAnalysis of Music’s Role in the Narrative:\n\nThe 2023 narrative actively incorporates music into its structure by opening with the notes of Mister’s banjo that he’s playing as he rides his horse under the branch of a tree where Celie and Nettie are playing a hand-clapping game to the tune of a song they’re singing. The film ends in this same physical location with a big Easter dinner set up under the tree, the location of Nettie’s return with Celie’s children, with Nettie revealing her presence to Celie by singing the same song the two were singing together at the beginning.\n\nIf one major narrative element is the arc of Celie’s increasing empowerment, Sofia’s role in this arc is musically emphasized by Sofia singing the song “Hell No!” in the sequence where she leaves Harpo for trying to beat her, a musicalized version of the phrase Sofia utters in the novel when the mayor’s wife asks if Sofia will be her maid. At this point Sofia encourages Celie to stand up for herself, and later in the film, Celie singing a snatch of this song after visiting Sofia in prison marks her increasing empowerment, which crescendos in the confrontation with Mister over having taken Nettie from her (which fittingly helps Sofia return to her previously empowered state).\n\nWhile Celie’s curse on Mister for taking Nettie from her is in both movies nearly verbatim from the novel, a major change both movies make to the book is that Mister “does right” by Celie by paying for Nettie et al’s passage home. In the novel, he “does right” by Celie by giving her more of Nettie’s letters–“Harpo made him send you the rest of your sister’s letters. Right after that he start to improve”–but has no hand in getting them back to America. In the novel’s epistolary form, Celie addresses her letters to God until the point she learns that Nettie is not dead as she thought, at which point she starts addressing her letters to Nettie. At the point of Mister “doing right” by giving her more of Nettie’s letters, we get the content of those letters and a lot more detail about Nettie’s experiences in Africa than is accounted for in either movie. Then Celie and Nettie write back and forth with the novel alternating between those letters, and Celie gets word that Nettie’s ship back to America sank and she’s dead, but still gets letters from her due to some lag time, and continues addressing her letters to Nettie despite believing she’s dead. But the letter recounting Nettie’s return is addressed:\n\nDEAR GOD. DEAR STARS, DEAR TREES, DEAR SKY, DEAR PEOPLES. DEAR EVERYTHING. DEAR GOD.\n\nAlice Walker, The Color Purple (1983).\n\nThis signals a renewed faith in God that also brings us to the novel’s title’s connection to same:\n\nGod love admiration.\n\nYou saying God vain? I ast.\n\nNaw, she say. Not vain, just wanting to share a good thing. I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don’t notice it.\n\nAlice Walker, The Color Purple (1983).\n\nThis exchange from the novel between Shug and Celie revealing the title as a corollary for the presence of God appears in both movies verbatim, but the conversation in the novel is a lot longer and references what the 1985 movie got a lot of criticism for excising: the overtly romantic relationship between Shug and Celie. Narratively, the 2023 movie plays on the arc of Celie’s faith this conversation is pivotal in by having Celie’s stepfather say when he takes her children that he’s “giving them to God,” with Celie asking Nettie, “Why don’t God give them back?” Celie’s empowerment arc leads her to stand up to Mister and curse him, which in turn prompts him to bring Nettie, and by extension Celie’s children, back, which shows Celie God did indeed give her children back, and the musical version reinforces this with the closing number following the familiar reunion entitled “The Color Purple,” articulating its connection to God and God’s connection in turn to Celie’s empowerment arc:\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nDear God, dear stars\n\nDear trees, dear sky\n\nDear peoples, dear everything\n\nDear God\n\nGod is inside me and everyone else\n\nThat was, forever will be\n\nI came into this world with God\n\nAnd when I finally looked inside\n\nI found it\n\nJust as close as my breath is to me\n\n…\n\n[Chorus]\n\nLike a blade of corn (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nLike a honey bee (Ooh)\n\nLike a waterfall (Like, ooh)\n\nAll a part of me\n\nLike the color purple\n\nWhere do it come from? (Tell, where does it come from?)\n\nNow my eyes are open (Now my eyes are open)\n\nLook what God has done\n\n“The Color Purple,” The Color Purple (2023).\n\nMister’s role in bringing Nettie back in the movie versions is a product of Celie’s empowerment and might seem narratively tighter than the novel, in which Nettie et al make their way back on their own. But this narrative connection becomes more necessary due to the excision of the element of Shug and Celie’s romantic relationship in both movies. In the novel, Shug leaves Celie because she falls in love with someone else, prompting Celie and Mister to forge a relationship over their shared love of Shug and shared experience of being abandoned by her. I was certainly hoping that the 2023 version would make Shug and Celie’s queer relationship more prominent, and while it’s more prominent than the 1985 version, it still feels shortchanged. The director seems to defend a narrative emphasis on their romance via the number”Push Da Button”: “there’s still a lot of storytelling going on” via a choice Shug makes about who is the “beneficiary” of the performance, constituting “a big emotional and romantic moment.”\n\nBut others agree with me that this adaptation is “is frustratingly coy about the queerness of its protaganist [sic].” The two musical numbers that reinforce Celie’s sexual attraction to Shug are both in her head:\n\nIn one moment, Celie (a tender Fantasia Barrino) fantasizes as she draws Shug Avery (Taraji P Henson) a bath; in her mind’s eye, Celie traces Shug’s sudsy arm as the two are slowly spun on an imagined turntable. In another sequence, the two perform an elaborate dance in flapper dresses, before sharing their first, real-life kiss.\n\nGloria Oladipo, “The latest adaptation of The Color Purple fails its lead character” (January 2, 2024).\n\nFirst and only real-life kiss in the movie, just like the 1985 version. We get one sliver more in 2023: that we cut, briefly, to Shug and Celie are sleeping in the same bed after this kiss. While all song and dance numbers aren’t “realistic,” there’s a distinction between whether they depict something that happens in the “real” world of the movie or whether it’s fantasy: the number in Celie’s pants store depicts her “real” business triumph, not just an imagined one. While something “really” happens between Shug and Celie, it gets more airtime in the movie’s fantasy world rather than its “real” one.\n\nMy other beef with the 2023 version is what seems like a missed opportunity in the sequence where Shug reconciles with her disapproving reverend father. Since Shug is a singer, the original movie, while not being a “musical” by genre, does incorporate two major musical numbers: Shug’s performance in Harpo’s juke (in which she sings “Miss Celie’s Blues,” which the 2023 version places later in time after Celie lives with Shug in Memphis in favor of “Push Da Button” in the juke sequence), and the sequence in which Shug reconciles with her father, which starts with her singing at the juke then stopping when she hears the gospel choir singing at her father’s very proximate church. Shug takes up the gospel number as she leads the juke crowd into the church, uniting blues and gospel and revealing the underlying similarities between these apparently opposing genres as she reunites with her father:\n\nIn the 2023 version, Shug simply walks into the empty church where her father is playing the piano and the two start singing together in what feels like a very subdued and to me honestly boring number. Maybe the director didn’t want to copy the original, but in this instance, he should have. The themes of the overlap between blues and gospel music emphasized in ‘85 by this number (underscoring the richness of Shug’s nontraditional conception of God and spirituality that the title The Color Purple highlights) are lost here.\n\n-SCR\n\nFinal Musical Project Inspiration:\n\nThe 2023 movie musical is an adaptation of the stage musical that is in turn an adaptation of the 1985 movie and the novel.\n\nInspired by Celie’s queerness in the novel being more prominent in the stage musical than the movie musical: Write a musical adapting a movie that was adapted from a novel–more specifically, a movie that made significant changes to the novel so your musical version includes some elements from the novel that were not in the movie version. (Example: The Shining…)\n\nOR: Include a reprise of a song in your musical project to represent two characters who are symbolically swapping places due to events in the plot.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat occurrences of the reprise in musicals can you think of and what narrative role did they play?\n\nWhat memorable lines from any novels or movies you have read or seen might make the good basis of a song in a musical adaptation of that novel or movie?\n\nIn an adaptation, is a tighter narrative worth the sacrifice of a significant theme?\n\nFrozen!\n\nIt needs no introduction, but I’m going to give one to you anyway. Frozen’s concept rests upon a very loose retelling of the Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen, but the franchise’s crux is that it follows the relationship of two royal sisters in – one with questionably controllable ice powers, Elsa, and one without, Anna. The plot of the first film rests upon Elsa losing control of her powers (triggered by her emotions), which results in Anna and a cast of other characters, like the animated snowman Olaf, down on his luck ice-picker Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and twist-villain Hans taking it upon themselves to end the sudden winter that envelops the kingdom of Arendelle results from Elsa’s little oopsie.\n\nThe result: a box-office smash hit which is still the third highest grossing animated film in history (only to be outdone by the Mario Bros movie and of course, Frozen 2 in the number slot). It seems like a pretty basic premise, but almost ten years after the release of the first film, it’s still a certified cultural phenomenon. The soundtrack album was #1 in the Billboard charts, surpassing Beyonce’s surprise album in 2013, won several industry accolades, some woman divorced her husband for his Frozen ambivalence – it is actually Frozen Fever. Several theories have been posited for this craze, but still, no one can truly answer the question of why Frozen is so beloved – or hated – in current pop culture. In this presentation, I shall be analyzing the elements that made the Frozen franchise so ridiculously popular -if it really has any at all.\n\nThe First Film\n\nFrozen was released on November 27, 2013. This release date is especially notable because it was released around the Thanksgiving holiday (leading up to Christmas) which is obviously strategic because it was The marketing, in terms of the trailers, initially was just shorts of Olaf…\n\n…as well as shots of action and adventure, which painted the movie as having “boy humor”. Then, as the release date approached, the creators actually revealed the entire plot, ice powers, sisters, Arendelle and all. This “pull back and reveal” techinque was very intriguing to viewers, as they got to see glimpses of the actual story. (Including me, who first saw the trailer in commercial breaks for My Little Pony and was enamored.)\n\nOnce Frozen was in theaters, it was everywhere: on merchandise, posters, and represented by seven-year olds in blond wigs and ice dresses running amuck. Frozen made DIsney 5.3 billion dollars in revenue – the sixth highest movie/franchise to ever make so much. And although Frozen’s target audience was little girls (me), it resonated with all ages because it twisted classic fairytale tropes and made it into something most considered new.\n\nFrozen’s main boast is that the story centers around two sisters as opposed to a purely romantic relationship. As we saw, the gesture of true love was performed by Elsa, as opposed to Hans, who betrayed her in the end, or Kristoff, who realized he loved Anna in even less time than it took for Hans to propose. And the villain isn’t the woman with feared ice powers, it’s the dashing prince with sideburns who Anna wanted to marry the second they met.\n\nMany of the elements that made the first Frozen unique are prevalent in many other Disney films. For example, Frozen’s signature sister-sister dynamic was also prevalent in Lilo and Stitch (2001), the themes of isolation were also dominant in Rapunzel (2010) and magic has been a staple of the fairytale genre since it was a thing (although it was presented in a less villainous light in Frozen). Much of the groundwork for Frozen was already laid previously, but all Disney’s “magical” staples just happened to be smashed together in this franchise.\n\nFrozen gets a lot of the credit for reinventing the genre – one of the causes of the “Frozen Fever” – where it’s not really deserved. But – there’s one character that really cemented the Frozen craze…\n\nThe Character of Elsa and Let It Go\n\nLook me in the eye and tell me you never wanted to be Elsa. See how you didn’t say anything? She’s got the dress, the powers, the ice castle, and delivered the Oscar-winning Let It Go. She is one of the more interesting characters in the franchise, considering her complicated relation ship her sister, and her traumatic experiences with her powers. Many, many group were able to identify with her plight of not fitting in and being ostracized throughout society, and she was very repressed and Let It Go was just as huge as Frozen itself, and is seen as an anthem for acceptance, rebellion, and freeing yourself from the past. Her character, as stated in the Guardian, contributed greatly to Frozen’s success – and by consequence, the Frozen Fever.\n\n…. if there was one character who could be credited with sole responsibility for Frozen’s success, it’s her.\n\nThe complex, damaged older sister with icy powers that her abusive parents forced her to conceal, was originally the villain of the piece – blue of skin and spiky of hair. But when married songwriting duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez composed Let it Go as an empowering ode to self-acceptance, the film was rewritten and Elsa-mania was born. Voiced by Idina Menzel, she’s undoubtedly the darling of the film’s younger viewers; the combination of her powers and how she reacts to them enchants the target audience. But her anthem – which Anderson-Lopez says should encourage people to “screw fear and shame, be yourself, be powerful” – became a touchstone for a huge cross-section of adults, too. People feeling ostracised by society; cancer survivors; divorcees – messages of thanks flooded into the film’s creators.\n\nLucinda Everett for the Guardian 2014\n\nFlaws in Elsa’s Character\n\nLook, I adore Elsa just as much as the next girl, but her characterization has a few kinks. Although “Let It Go” is seen as an empowering anthem with a message of “screw society, embrace yourself”, Elsa was effectively running away from her problems in that scene, and thought isolating herself in an ice palace was the solution to the eternal winter she’d created. Elsa wasn’t her best mental state, either, considering the stress of her coronation, reuniting with her sister, and her trauma of trying to hide her powers since she was a young child. She wants to protect Anna, but puts her in harm’s way more often than not, and she never realizes the error of her ways and goes back to Arendelle on her own – she had to be captured by Hans and his soldiers. However, I doubt Disney thought about this, as Elsa was in effect that girl regardless and was making them money.\n\nIn my opinion, Anna is the better written character of the two, but she wasn’t as profitable as Elsa (not that it really made a difference). Elsa was part of the magic that made Frozen, and critical to Disney making all that cash. Many of these flaws went unnoticed by viewers (sort of), and the Frozen fever commenced all the way to…\n\nThe Sequel – Frozen 2 (2019)\n\nFrozen 2 was released in the United States on November 22, 2019, which is practically the same week the first film was released (very strategic on Disney’s part). Disney brewed up a marketing storm for this one, with cryptic posters, cast Q and As, spamming it on social media, beautiful trailers, and much, much more. Evidently, it worked – to this day Frozen 2 remains the highest grossing animated film of all time.\n\nThe new movie had a completely different plot, choosing to focus on Elsa even greater, particularly on the origins of her powers. Set three years after the first film, Elsa, strangely discontent with her restored life in Arendelle, keeps hearing a strange call, which ends up in the gang (Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, Olaf) ends up in an enchanted forest, with the native people, elements, and secrets about Arendelle’s past.\n\nFrozen 2 more overtly tried to appeal to all ages – after all, the kids who were obsessed with the first film (me) had grown older, after all, and they still needed new little kids to inflict with the Frozen Fever. The characters, Anna and Olaf especially, grapple with becoming older (Olaf has a whole song about it). This kind of subverts the Disney brand, because Disney profits off of imagination and nostalgia – things that are trademarks of childhood. The subversion also plays into Frozen’s individual brand, since it’s seen as remixing the Disney formula (one of the supposed aspects of why people love it so darn much).\n\nFrozen 2 more overtly tried to appeal to all ages – after all, the kids who were obsessed with the first film (me) had grown older, after all, and they still needed new little kids to inflict with the Frozen Fever.

The subversion also plays into Frozen’s individual brand, since it’s seen as remixing the Disney formula (one of the supposed aspects of why people love it so darn much).\n\nProduction\n\nThe production process of Frozen 2 was chronicled in a documentary series entitled “Into the Unknown: Making Frozen 2”, which was released on Disney+ in June 2020. Although I have not personally watched the series, many viewers were appalled at the working conditions that the animators and behind-the-scenes staff had to endure, working very long hours for six days a week. The staff (the animation team) often has to sleep to at work and operate on very limited rest in order to have the film ready by the release date. The directors kept running into hiccups with the song “Show Yourself” and kids not understanding what was going on in the film during test screenings. Overall, it’s clear that the people behind this had the best intentions for this story, but their stress and the fact that they were overworked certainly explains the inconsistencies of the film.\n\nThis, obviously, didn’t dampen the amount of income Disney got. The message of the documentary was intended to be one of triumph: “wow, they went through all that and Frozen 2 still was a flawless film!” when in actuality knowing the context puts a lot of things into perspective.\n\nBy now, Disney had realized that Elsa was the most profitable character this franchise had to offer, and although the creative team had a say, it’s not unreasonable to assume that Frozen 2 focused on her purely for financial gain. She was that girl times 2 in this movie – with the water horse, the incredibly detailed outfits (as a result of Disney’s advancing animation software), and gay subtext. However, many of the problems in her character still persist from the first film, and they’ve become even more convoluted due to the nature of the plot. She still runs away from her problems (and sister… and snowman, who are only trying to help her), is the fifth elemental spirit for some reason, and surrenders the throne to her sister to take up her true destiny in the enchanted forest. She puts people in danger more often than not, and none of this is actually addressed in the film, so it just kind of looks like she did bad things without receiving any real consequences.\n\nHowever, her desire to go “into the unknown” and discover new things resonated with viewers, and was one of the better parts of the film. But overall, Frozen 2 would’ve made money regardless of its flaws because – well, it’s Frozen. Despite the thin plot, the songs that didn’t exactly have the same impact as the first film, the backtracking in characterization, the Frozen Fever still persisted. In the space between the first and second film (and after the second), Disney launched animated shorts, books, Frozen on Ice, and most importantly….\n\nThe Musical – Frozen on Broadway, 2018-2020\n\nAfter a 2017 try-out run at the Buell Theatre in Denver, Colorado, Frozen premiered on Broadway in March 2018, produced by the one and only Disney Theatrical Group. Frozen’s musical adaptation is based upon the plot of the first film, but being that it’s a musical, it had to expand in terms of song number and run time. The show boasts 23 songs in total, including all the ones from the original film. Although it was met with mixed reviews, Frozen stayed on Broadway until March 2020, when it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and since it wasn’t money as much money as Aladdin or the Lion King, Disney made the executive decision to close the show’s Broadway run (although there are still international productions and productions on tours).\n\nThe first priority [for Disney Theatrical] … is when you have a property that is as beloved and music-based as Frozen, that has to get an enormous amount of my attention. To say, ‘How do we take this and make a sophisticated, adult evening of theater out of it?’\n\n— Tom Schumacher (president of Disney Theatrical Group) interview with Southern California Public Radio in November 2014\n\nUnlike the sequel, Frozen’s creative team was actually given ample amount of time to make the musical production of quality, and it shows. Bob Iger himself declared: “We’re not demanding speed. We’re demanding excellence.” Development actually began in 2014 – meaning the creative time had years to string this adaptation together. Writing- wise, the musical improves upon the 2013 film in terms of characterization, fleshes out relationships (Anna’s particularly), and the technical aspects, like the sets, lighting, costumes, and special effects are simply stunning.\n\nAlthough Frozen’s musical drew kids to the production, they weren’t this adaptations target audience like the first film’s. 70 percent of audiences were adults without children. And as the quote in the previous slide says, the content of the musical was scaled up to be more mature (for example, Elsa is shown to be having suicidal thoughts).\n\nFrozen the musical made $150 million dollars on Broadway and drew audiences of 1.3 million. It was nowhere near as popular as the film: but, in my opinion, exceeds that film’s quality because it fixes (most) of the plot holes and enriches the characters.\n\nAlong with literally every major character in the story, Elsa’s character was greatly expanded upon and we learn a lot more about her and what informs her decisions. For example, in the troll (called “hidden folk” in the musical) scene after Elsa strikes Anna in the head, Grandpappie shows her a vision that her powers will end up killing everyone she loves, which makes her even more afraid of her powers and what she can do. Elsa sees herself as a monster unfit for society, and that affects every aspect of her life. She’s unable to accept help from her sister in fear of hurting her. Overall, Elsa’s plight is a lot more understandable and shows her complexity that was laid down in the first movie, but not truly elaborated upon given the movie’s PG rating and run time to cater to the attention span of preschoolers.\n\nSo, is the Frozen franchise really worth melting for?\n\nFrozen has many, many flaws, ones that are glaring (Hans) and ones that go unnoticed, and the fact that it’s Disney’ darling that made it such a ludicrous amount of money. Frozen, in essence, is basically the compounding of the Disney brands, with a couple things remixed to make things interesting. But it’s a story that’s endured for almost a decade, and hasn’t gotten any less big. This is going to sound like Disney propaganda, but despite all the marketing genius and the atrocities inflicted upon the animators for Frozen 2, Frozen still means well. Although not as original as Disney claims it is, it rest upon a relationship of two sisters, a cool queen with ice powers, and other wacky snow antics that make it irresistible. Frozen shaped several childhoods and remains in our hearts today. It’s a sweet tale at its core – so hey, why not melt for it?\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nDid you partake in the Frozen Fever? Do you think that it has had the same or similar effect on Gen Z that the Disney Renaissance had on millennials?\n\nDo you think the character of Elsa is actually complex, or was she just a tool for Disney to earn even more revenue? Do you relate to her? Do you think Elsa’s reliability allowed Disney to profit more off of her?\n\nProject Idea\n\nWrite a short memoir in which you chronicle the events of your life in relation to a Disney craze – in my case, Frozen Fever. Show how it has affected you as a person and try to include elements of the Disney craze in your own writing.\n\nThese eyes are cryin’\n\nThese eyes have seen a lot of loves\n\nBut they’re never gonna see another one like I had with you\n\nThe Guess Who, “These Eyes” (1969).\n\nMy college fiction teacher Justin Cronin, who later went on to pen The Passage trilogy, disseminated a glossary of craft terms in his classes that included specific Cronin-isms that might be best emblematized in the entry designated “‘Baby, It’s Yu,'” which he defines as “A Jungian pun; any use of language in a story that takes a physical circumstance and retools it through metaphor.” He provides as an example the story “Trust Me” by John Updike, in which the character is literally in a high place in the first two scenes and then figuratively high (on a hash brownie) in the third. Cronin does not provide in his official glossary document the origin of the “‘Baby, It’s Yu'” term he uses for this concept, but he did describe its origin in class, which derives from a dream he had that I can’t really remember except that it involved some kind of play on “Yu” and “You.” The fact that the term derives from a dream is significant to his designation of the “Jungian pun” concept, because unlike the broadly used “Freudian slip,” the “Jungian pun” also seems to be a Cronin-ism not in general circulation. The psychologist Carl Jung elucidated a lot of the function of the human “unconscious” (manifest often in dreams), which the fiction writer Robert Boswell (a grad school teacher of mine) uses as the foundation of his book of craft essays The Half-Known World (2008), which has the narrative spandrel essay I still use in my advanced fiction classes.\n\nPer my previous post‘s dissection of “the way eyes look,” Justin’s “Yu”/”You” wordplay from so many years ago bubbled up from my unconscious when I started thinking about integrating AI-generated writing into my advanced fiction class this semester, since this has become such an integral issue in creative-writing professions, as demonstrated by the Writers Guild of America strike. “Eye”/”I.” What is the value of writing by humans rather than robots? Does the world “look different” through the eyes of artificial intelligence?\n\nAs I explore such questions with the fiction class, I am also starting an elective on Disney and continuing to explore “the way eyes look” in Disney movies. Expounding to the Disney class on the multitude of topics they could do their presentations on this semester, my examples included narrative comparisons of the live-action remakes to their originals as well as why a certain movie or movies did better at the box office than others. I mentioned that when you “look closer” at certain Disney texts, you might notice things you didn’t before, like the significant differential in the quality of the original Pinocchio (1940) and Dumbo (1941), with the former having been labored over for much longer at much greater expense than the latter, since Dumbo was truncated (so to speak) due to the onset of WWII. Then it occurred to me that two of the biggest Disney live-action remake bombs were Dumbo (2019) and Pinocchio (2022). Having watched both, I concur they are terrible–and for multiple reasons (though I could probably argue Dumbo is worse)–but per the eye theme, I think they both exemplify a trend of failure across the span of the live-action remakes, and that is the use of CGI, or even more specifically, of the CG-EYES. Before I watched the remakes of this pair, I watched the originals again, which I had seen more than a few times in my childhood, and despite Dumbo‘s factually objective lower quality, I was instantly affected by the emotion conveyed in the animated eyes of Dumbo’s mother in the opening sequence as she waited, in vain, for the stork to deliver her a baby. How do they do that? I thought.\n\nThe CG-Eyes of the elephants in the remake similarly swell with emotion at points–and yet this emotional swelling turns out to be quite different. Rather than the genuine emotion conveyed by Dumbo’s mother’s eyes in the original, the emotion expressed by the CG-Eyes to me felt fake, saccharine, obnoxious.\n\n(In the case of Dumbo, this failure was exacerbated by that of the main child actor, whose general emotional conveyance was as deadpan as cardboard, despite her having actual eyes.)\n\nPinocchio has the exact same CG-Eye problem.\n\nThe Little Mermaid works better because the eyes of the characters are not CG-Eyes (and because the live actors in this film can actually act).\n\nAnd yet, if you watch a movie like Wall-E (2008), you can see that it’s not CG-Eyes in and of themselves that are the problem. In a narrative that revolves around an AI-robot’s emotions, the emotional conveyance of the robot CGI-Eyes is critical, and in Wall-E, it’s really nothing less than stunning. While Wall-E’s eyes arguably replicate human eyes to some extent, the robot Eve’s eyes definitely do not, yet these eyes still communicate emotion quite effectively.\n\nThis effectiveness is elemental to the general success of the studio that pioneered CGI animation, the Disney-owned Pixar, though the failure of its most recent film–Elemental (2023)–seems to evidence Pixar’s waning quality, as aptly analyzed by Jessica Winter, who essentially reads a Jungian pun into this film’s concept, designating it a “tearful metaphor for Pixar’s decline.” Dissecting how its narrative climax derives from the “running joke in ‘Elemental’ that evolves into a grand theme (spoilers forthcoming) is that Wade cries a lot,” Winter then extrapolates the main character’s climactic “(re)generative tears [into] a metaphor for what Pixar has lost. They are what Pixar wants from us and can no longer have,” before pulling back into a broader analysis of a defining quality of the Pixar brand: producing “tearjerkers.” (Winter also mentions that Wall-E, that film based around the emotion conveyed by AI-eyes, is considered by many critics “to be Pixar’s best film.”)\n\nNear the beginning of the titular essay in Boswell’s The Half-Known World, he mentions watching a play in which rain was replicated on stage in such a way that, despite replicating rain in an authentic manner, diverted his attention from the world of the play’s narrative specifically because it was too authentic:\n\nImagine a play set in the wilderness, a serious play by an important playwright. The stage set is elaborate. It includes a mammoth tree and a stream with real water that runs across the front of the stage and feeds a small pond. A few minutes into the play, thunder sounds and it actually begins to rain, water cascading down from above and landing in the stream. It is an impressive spectacle; however, sitting there in the audience, I feel myself slip out of the drama to wonder about the complicated sprinkling and drainage system. In the second act, one character tortures another by drag- ging him to the pond and holding his head under the water. At this point, I bounce entirely out of the play. I catch myself wondering whether he has a straw under there by which to breathe.\n\nThe rain and pond interfere with the audience’s ability to enter the play’s world. They are too literal for the medium. You will not be surprised to hear that the playwright had recently been writing Hollywood screenplays. Returning to the stage, he confused the nature of film with the nature of drama. Serious theater, like serious fiction, is a medium of implication. A play succeeds by making you see what is not there. Two actors staring as if through a window create not only the glass but also the landscape.\n\nRobert Boswell, “The Half-Known World,” The Half-Known World (2008) (emphasis mine).\n\nThis explains why the CGI-Eyes work across the Pixar canon but not the Disney live-action canon. In Pixar movies, the eyes and the creatures they belong to are not the only CGI-rendered elements in the films’ landscapes: the entire filmscape is CGI. In the live-action Dumbo and Pinocchio, the titular characters are rendered in CGI while the landscape surrounding them is “real.” This represents the inherent flaw in rendering cartoon-animated Disney narratives in “live-action”–these narratives necessitate a problematic juxtaposition of CGI and live acting, or a juxtaposition of real and fake: a contrast that calls attention to the fake, rather than making the fake seem real.\n\nIf Boswell essentially wondered how do they do that? about the rain like I did seeing Dumbo’s mother’s eyes, the effect on him was the opposite of what my question represented. Those eyes drew me (so to speak) into the world of the story, making me feel her emotion in a way that made her world seem real, while the real-seeming rain drew Boswell out of the story. The lesson: the mechanics of a narrative, whether it’s in prose or in special tech effects, should never call attention to themselves, but should rather draw attention to the story.\n\nThinking about all the AI stuff, I recalled a story a student wrote in the advanced fiction class last fall, before the advent of ChatGPT, about an AI robot–a story it happens was entitled “Rain.” This was a gorgeous story, and exemplifies ALL of this post’s aforementioned themes, as you can see from another students’ summary of the story in their written workshop critique:\n\nSummary: In “Rain,” there is a robot who is watching the rain outside. It is the first time it has rained in a long time. The robot is charged with watching a girl in an incubator. After giving its daily report, the robot goes to the mess hall and notices the other robots aren’t there, which is odd. After completing its assignments, the robot returns to the room with the incubator and feels lonely, staring wistfully at the rain. It wants to go outside. The robot thinks about its past, where it was created to prepare the new planet for human habitation but without any AI, just as a very mechanical thing. The humans have still not woken up, though they landed on the planet a while back. While watching the rain, the robot comes to the conclusion that the girl will never wake up. While going to the airlock, the robot looks at its face and is disturbed by the state of disrepair of it. When the robot wakes up, he gets a new face and body. He goes outside, looking at the girl one last time. The sun and the dust start to rust him and cause him pain, but he dances in the dewy dust and notices, as he is shutting down, the other robots, all rusted and dead in a pile. They had gone out in the rain and had rusted through, but they had “lived” for a moment. As he dies, he hears a girl cry.\n\nPart of this story’s effectiveness is in its rising action developed through the pronoun use, as described in the same student’s critique: “The shifting pronouns [from ‘it’ to ‘he’] through the story were a really nice touch to show how 01178 is gaining more and more of a sense of self…” and in the climax, that sense of self is cemented by the robot having the agency to make a choice–ironically, a choice that kills its self, and one that we’re also shown by the pile of dead robots that seem to have made the same choice, that this sense of self is not particularly unique, and neither, this development highlights, is humans’. (If a narrative climax is often constituted by an epiphany, or main character REALIZING something, this concept heightens the significance of REAL EYES, to make another Jungian pun.) The summary also gives us a sense of how emotions pervade the story despite its being about a ROBOT, as is the case in Wall-E.\n\nWall-E also happens to exemplify, indirectly, an approach to Jungian depth psychology in how the titular robot’s emotion that is the foundation of the film’s plot, his love for the robot Eve, apparently derives from his having seen it in a film:\n\n(This film that Wall-E learns the concept of love from is Hello, Dolly! (1969), which it’s probably not a coincidence that Disney owns the rights to, as evidenced by its presence on Disney+.) Reflecting how visual texts can help us learn about ourselves, our emotions, and the unconscious factors that might inform them, three different theses for Masters in Counseling Psychology at the Pacifica Graduate Institute that I’ve come across n the UH library database offer frameworks for integrating Disney movies into the application of Jungian depth psychology–one using Beauty and the Beast (1991), one using The Little Mermaid (1989), and one using a combination of Frozen (2013) and Maleficent (2014).\n\nI recently befriended a biology teacher based largely on a shared interest in AI, which we have conversed about almost exclusively over text messaging rather than in person. As part of these exchanges, we texted about collaboratively generating fictional dialog–in this case between an AI android and a human scientist–via text message exchange (an exercise I plan to have the fiction students do in class). I also plan to have the students try to replicate their text exchange dialog conversations with ChatGPT to compare similarities and differences in their responses, with an eye to the authenticity of the emotion conveyed through dual human dialog exchanges versus a human-and-AI exchange. This reminded me of the recent South Park episode “Deep Learning” (March 8, 2023) co-written with ChatGPT in which texting and the potential authenticity of ChatGPT’s emotional conveyance is highlighted by the plot development of some of the boys getting ChatGPT to generate text-message responses to their girlfriends who want them to be more emotionally “supportive” in their texting rather than just repeatedly sending thumbs-up emojis. The effectiveness of this method prompts one girlfriend, Wendy, to respond “‘Thank you for being the only real thing in my life.'” And yet, when Stan turns to ChatGPT to write him out of the problem he’s gotten himself into and ChatGPT takes over to write the remainder of the episode, the bland and stilted nature of ChatGPT’s narrative powers becomes glaringly apparent.\n\n-SCR\n\n“What other ways can there be to see?”\n\nNancy Zastudil, “Art on the Run: Austin’s Artist Run Club,” ACTX (June 5, 2023).\n\nSusan Sontag declared in her influential article “Notes on ‘Camp’” that camp was “a way of looking at things…a quality discoverable in objects and the behavior of persons.” … Sontag observes that “camp sees everything in quotation marks…to perceive Camp in objects and persons is to understand Being-as-Playing-a-Role.”\n\nSean Griffin, Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out (2000), p. 68.\n\nThe most looked at post on this blog is one entitled “Edward P. Jones’ ‘The First Day’: Looking at Looking,” about a story in which a little girl, in the process of being registered for kindergarten by her mother, first perceives others’ perceptions of her mother while learning her mother is illiterate. I have since become attuned to the double meaning of “the way eyes look”–the way they look from the outside to other people looking at them, which would be in the form of an adjective, and the way they look from the inside to the person they belong to, which would be a verb enacting the individual’s worldview, i.e., the way they look at the world.\n\nI was struck by the way Prince Harry’s ghostwriter framed his approach to memoir in a recent article:\n\n[Andre Agassi] asked why I’d organized my memoir around other people, rather than myself. I told him that was the kind of memoir I admired. There’s so much power to be gained, and honesty to be achieved, from taking an ostensibly navel-gazing genre and turning the gaze outward.\n\nJ.R. Moehringer, “Notes from Prince Harry’s Ghostwriter” (May 8, 2023).\n\nPer the subject of my last post, having a dead mother might be a significant element of defining or influencing someone’s worldview, potentially more so if the mother died when the individual was still young–as Prince Harry might well be the most famous case for. Happening upon his memoir, Spare (2023), in a sidewalk lending library on the route where I walk my dogs, I opened randomly to the page where Harry first visited Paris, years after his mother died there, and demanded his driver take him through the tunnel where the infamous car accident occurred–twice. It didn’t do anything to assuage the pain that had defined his life, but the tunnel itself is an apt metaphor for that life-defining pain: tunnel vision.\n\nThe death of Ariel’s mother in the 2023 version of The Little Mermaid also defines her worldview, though unlike Harry, she would have been too young to remember it. We learn in the 2023 update to the narrative that her mother’s death is the reason Triton has forbidden Ariel and her sisters from going above the ocean’s surface.\n\nZooming out to the audience’s perspective and the Disney live remakes in general, one question is what exactly is their point. For Disney, the answer is money, and for audiences, one answer would seem to be to wallow in nostalgia. With these remakes Disney seems to be consciously addressing criticism of problematic messages communicated in the original narratives, messages that “look different” as time passes and the culture changes. This entails updates to make the narratives more “woke,” a term the right-wing now spews like racist invective. Yet this now politically loaded term also encodes the way eyes look–eyes open, or eyes (and brain) closed?\n\nLong before The Little Mermaid hit cinemas, progressives understood that they were basically obligated to support it for political reasons; even now, the narrative persists that anyone who dislikes the movie must be a racist troll (that is, unless they’re denouncing it for not being woke enough).\n\n…Now consider the politically correct version of the same story, in which Ariel is conveniently saved, by amnesia, from knowing what she’s done — and hence deprived of any opportunity to own it, to reckon with it. The former story is about a girl who does things; the latter is about a girl to whom things happen. Which of these is supposed to be a vision of female empowerment, again?\n\nFrom here.\n\nSo what does the “live-action” element add? The concept inherently contains enhanced realism, which in the context of Disney content seems essentially absurd–unless they were willing to excise their trademark talking animals, which seems highly unlikely. Returning to the Disney-Stephen King connection from the previous post, as a horror writer, King’s major talent seems to be rendering inherently unrealistic (i.e., supernatural) concepts with a level of realism that makes them utterly convincing, evidence that unrealistic concepts can be rendered realistically. This seems to have been a major goal for The Little Mermaid‘s 2023 director Rob Marshall, who breaks down his composition of the “Under the Sea” number here, explaining that he wanted sea creatures with a natural tendency to dance and that they do not play musical instruments as they did in the animated version. (Though apparently Ariel can be wrapped in jellyfish tentacles without being stung.)\n\nAlso excised for the sake of heightened “realism” is the “Les Poissons” number in which a French chef chases the crab Sebastian around the kitchen in order to kill and cook him. Yet the film found other ways to incorporate the food-chain hierarchy that leads King Triton to denigrate humans as “savages” for eating fish, including decorative images of hooked fish in the palace chamber Ariel is taken too once she’s human, leading her to wonder “Are we only food for slaughter? Is this life on land?”\n\nThe concept of hierarchy is embedded in Hans Christian Andersen’s original tale and the 1989 version:\n\nThe Little Mermaid establishes the world on land and the world under the sea as two contrasting spaces, one factual and one fictive, one real and the other imaginary. In this dualistic and hierarchical construction, the human world can be aligned with the white male system and the water world situated outside that system. In Women’s Reality (1981), Ann Wilson Schaef uses the term “white male system” to characterize the dominant culture of American patriarchy. According to Schaef, the white male system operates on several contradictory myths, at least two of which are relevant to the complementary worlds of this film. First, nothing exists outside the white male system; and second, the white male system knows and understands everything (8-9). Those who are privileged by the white male system are oblivious to anything outside the system, while those outside the system know about the dominant culture as well as their own marginalized culture. These two contradictory myths speak to the relationship between the land and sea worlds: the sea world is rendered either invisible or mythic while the land world is endowed with cultural validity. As contradictory and complementary, the two-world motif creates permeable yet dangerous borders, furthers the plot, and establishes a hierarchy of desires.\n\nAs Pat Murphy convincingly argues in his ecofeminist critique of The Little Mermaid, the film firmly establishes a colonialist, first-world/third-world relationship between the human and sea worlds. The world under the sea, despite its aristocratic decor, is the colonized space of marginalized or muted cultures, often invisible to the inhabitants of the white male system. Sebastian, and many of the other sea creatures, have the facial features of people of color. … When they venture across the boundary into the “real world,” they risk being reduced to human food.\n\nLaura Sells, “‘Where Do the Mermaids Stand?’: Voice and Body in The Little Mermaid,” From Mouse to Mermaid: The Politics of Film, Gender, and Culture, ed. Elizabeth Bell (1995).\n\nThe casting of Halle Bailey as Ariel–or more specifically, the backlash against her casting due to her race–heightens the resonance of these “contradictory myths”…\n\nMore than just fodder for nostalgia, these classic stories are part of US myth-building about itself. Making a Black woman the central figure in that myth disrupts the well-established hierarchies that have been embedded in that national narrative.\n\nTayo Bero, “The global backlash against The Little Mermaid proves why we needed a Black Ariel,” The Guardian (June 9, 2023).\n\n…and the role of the food chain in the narrative’s constructions of hierarchy:\n\n“NEVER use the words ‘chocolate’ or ‘coffee’ or any other food related word to describe someone’s skin color, especially someone of color. I wrote a whole paper about how referring to darker skin tones as specifically chocolate was about aggression and appropriation and has links to colonialism. Think about it, what is the best way to show dominance? By eating someone – like in the animal kingdom. It’s a disgusting practice, so please watch yourself while writing biographies and replying to people, or even in your short stories/novels.”\n\nFrom here.\n\nThe “links to colonialism” are very much heightened in the remake, which I’ll return to.\n\nAriel is not the only character who generated a backlash based on the way she looks. Enough people were disturbed by the way Flounder looks to constitute a “backlash,” while Flounder’s “look” again seems to derive from Marshall’s desire for him to look like a “real” fish. I was disturbed by the fact that in the trailer, the seagull Scuttle talks underwater. If Scuttle looks different from his 1989 animated corollary, this is in part because the character has not only been updated from a he to a she, but from a seagull to a “gannet,” a bird that dives underwater. The reason for this turns out to be related to how Ariel’s mother’s death has influenced the way she looks at her world, primarily with the desire to escape from it to the “above world,” as explained by the movie’s director Rob Marshall:\n\n“I wanted to make it that Ariel had never ever been to the surface. Ever,” he said. “That was the goal for me. She’s never broken that rule, [so that helps] raise the stakes for that moment when she finally does it. If she’s up and down, up and down, it’s not a big deal.”\n\nJo Berry, “How The Little Mermaid differs from the Disney animation” (May 26, 2023).\n\nIn the 1989 version, Ariel appears to go to the surface regularly in order to get (bad) information from Scuttle about human artifacts.\n\nThe tag line on the above article that the changes in the remake are “not just about how Sebastian looks” reinforces the dichotomy of external v. internal looking. If crabs, fish and birds can be rendered to look more realistic because these things actually exist in the “real” world, what about mermaids? For me at least, Ariel’s 2023 look often directed the gaze toward her literal navel.\n\nThe fantastical premise requires lots of CGI, which I have learned looks different to different generations, having heard my high-school students laugh at how fake the shark looks in Jaws (1975) when I had always thought it looked pretty scary (an opinion supported by other people my age I’ve discussed it with). I grew up looking at movies whose special effects did not include CGI, while my high school students conversely did grow up with CGI. Their still-developing brains were conditioned to perceive it as looking “real” while mine was not; in contrast to what my developing brain was conditioned to look at as real, CGI looks fake. If the CGI shark in the new Little Mermaid didn’t look that fake to me, that’s probably due to its proximity to the fake-looking CGI mermaid. But at least the top half of her is real.\n\nMy father first took me to see the 1989 Little Mermaid in the theater while my mother stayed behind to potty train my younger brother using a train-in-one-day method she had read about that consisted of plying him with salty foods that would in turn prompt him to drink a lot of liquids–an apt metaphor for how consumption trains us. How the consumption of visual texts including but not limited to Disney’s trains us–or more specifically, trains the way we look at the world–is aptly described in a passage by Stephen King in The Shining, in which the rising action involves the ghosts in the haunted Overlook Hotel evolving from more ethereal to physically embodied (or put another way, becoming more “real”), marked by the human characters’ increasing perception of them:\n\nIt wasn’t a perception of sight or sound, although it was very near to those things, separated from those senses by the filmiest of perceptual curtains. It was as if another Overlook now lay scant inches beyond this one, separated from the real world (if there is such a thing as a “real world,” Jack thought) but gradually coming into balance with it. He was reminded of the 3-D movies he’d seen as a kid. If you looked at the screen without the special glasses, you saw a double image—the sort of thing he was feeling now. But when you put the glasses on, it made sense.\n\nStephen King, The Shining (1977) (emphasis mine).\n\nAnother major aspect of The Shining is the concept of how the “pictures in a book” can hurt you–Dick Hallorann tells young Danny, who shares his “shining” ability that facilitates the perception of ghosts, that when he sees such ghosts, they can’t actually hurt him, just like pictures in a book can’t. Hallorann turns out to be very wrong about this, thus implying that the pictures in a book can hurt you. One way they can do this is through problematic messaging via stereotypical depictions. If the animals in the 1989 Little Mermaid have the features of people of color, this implies people of color are less human, subtly reinforcing racial hierarchy.\n\nIf the ’23 Sebastian looks like a more realistic crab externally while his internal way of looking at the world remains essentially the same as the ’89 version, the way Ariel’s eyes look have changed both ways. Some interesting changes in the film’s framing of perspective revolve around the transitional device from the “above world” to the one “under the sea.” In both versions, we the viewer start out in the above world with the sailors on Eric’s ship. In the 1989 version, a sailor loses his grip on a live fish that leaps over the railing, and we follow it down beneath the surface of the water. In 2023, we open (after an epigraph from Andersen’s original tale whose text is set against the churning sea viewed from above) with the sailors attempting to harpoon what looks to them like a mermaid but turns out not to be, as Eric informs them, shouting “‘USE YOUR EYES!'” A sailor protests about the dangers of mermaids luring men to their deaths on the occasion of the coral moon, setting up a parallel misperception in the underwater world via Triton’s insistence that humans just want to kill mermaids. When a wave bumps the ship, the sailor says to Eric “‘See there?'” with Eric retorting “‘See what?'” The sailor falsely perceives the sea king as the cause of the wave, but of course Eric is evolved enough to see beyond that.\n\nThanks to another bumpy wave, Eric’s lackey Grimsby loses his grip on a telescope that we then follow down below the surface of the water, with the camera swooping and swirling as if embodying a specific mermaid’s point of view, though this turns out not to be the case. After a scene in which Ariel is revealed to be absent from a convening of King Triton’s daughters, the camera cuts to the swimming perspective again, via the preceding scene’s frame now embodying Ariel’s perspective, the viewer looking through her eyes before looking at her, with the dropped telescope again facilitating the perspective transition: we look through her eyes until she sees the telescope, then we’re looking at her as her body enters the frame to reach for it.\n\nIn the ’89 version it’s Scuttle we see using the telescope–the wrong way. He (and the viewer with him) uses it to look at Ariel, but looking through it backwards, she appears far away. When he puts it down she’s right in front of him, prompting him to comment, “‘Whoa, what a swim.'” In ’23 we look through the telescope with Ariel at Flounder, still the wrong way so he appears far away, prompting Ariel to realize the right way to look through it.\n\nLooking through a character’s eyes rather than at them apparently had implications for a particular Disneyland attraction:\n\nImagineer Joe Rohde stresses that guests at Disney’s theme parks “are given roles within the narrative” in order to immerse them (2007: n.pag.). Early versions of some of these attractions thus even tried to convey the story from a first-person perspective of the main character, supplanting them entirely with the guest, something that failed massively in the case of the Snow White’s Adventures dark ride: “you were taking Snow White’s place […] you were the girl that was being threatened. And nobody got it. Nobody actually figured out that they were Snow White. They just wondered where the hell Snow White was,” points out Imagineer Ken Anderson (quoted in Rahn 2011: 94). As literary scholar Suzanne Rahn has chronicled, the perspective of the story had led to the ride being rather scary, following Snow White’s frightening journey while being chased by the evil old hag, and omitting most of the cheerier scenes with the Dwarfs and a likeness of Snow White herself. … as this example shows, Disneyland’s guests were expecting to see the Disney characters, songs, and scenes they knew from the films…\n\nSabrina Mittermeier, A Cultural History of the Disney Theme Parks: Middle Class Kingdoms (2021).\n\nThat is, the riders didn’t realize they were supposed to be Snow White; they wanted to look at Snow White.\n\nThe repositioning of Ariel from passively looked-at object to actively looking subject plays out the remake’s emphasis on an aspect of Andersen’s original text signaled by the epigraph: Ariel’s agency. The ’89 version predominantly, if not entirely, makes it seem like Ariel wants to become human for the sake of winning Eric rather than for the sake of being human in and of itself. While Andersen’s story also sends some mixed signals on this front, one of Ariel’s–or the unnamed “little mermaid” (none of Andersen’s characters get names)–defining desires is to gain an “immortal soul,” something that apparently humans have but mermaids don’t, though it can be gained through the love of and marriage to a human. As Halle Bailey notes, in the new version, Ariel’s desire for a man is, in theory, secondary, not primary:\n\n“I’m really excited for my version of the film because we’ve definitely changed that perspective of just wanting her to leave the ocean for a boy,” Halle Bailey said in an interview with Edition.\n\n“It’s way bigger than that. It’s about herself, her purpose, her freedom, her life and what she wants.”\n\nJo Berry, “How The Little Mermaid differs from the Disney animation” (May 26, 2023).\n\nOne of the new songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, “For the First Time,” would seem to emphasize this idea, occupying Ariel’s internal perspective as she “sings” it in her head after she’s given up her voice. It starts out describing the things she’s looking at but then almost immediately reverses:\n\nLook at the sun and the sky and the sand\n\nAnd the sea behind me\n\nLook at me, suddenly I am on land and I’m free\n\n“For the First Time,” The Little Mermaid (2023).\n\nIf the song is largely centered on Eric by the end, Ariel is at least taking responsibility for her choices:\n\nRealize the price that you paid with your voice\n\nAs he turns from you\n\nThose sacrifices you made were a choice\n\nThat you can’t undo\n\n“For the First Time,” The Little Mermaid (2023).\n\nThe ’89 version definitely undermines Ariel’s agency when Triton tries to destroy the contract she signed with Ursula while Ariel protests “‘Daddy, I’m sorry–I didn’t mean to! I didn’t know!'” This is the opposite of taking responsibility for her choice, as in the lyrics above. While some think that the amnesia change in the ’23 version–i.e., that Ursula’s spell causes Ariel to forget she needs to get the kiss from Eric–robs Ariel of her agency, another way of looking at it is that it means Ariel appreciates being human for being human’s sake rather than for Eric’s, as emphasized by a servant observing the “faraway look in her eye.”\n\nLast summer I became obsessed with the movie Elvis, which became the basis for the music-writing elective I taught the following fall. My obsession with The Little Mermaid and its recent remake is not the basis for the Disney elective I’m planning for this fall, but more of a happy coincidence. Nonetheless, even if the 2022 Elvis is a sort of inversion of the 2023 The Little Mermaid in making the realistic more fantastical while The Little Mermaid makes the fantastical more realistic (or attempts to), a likeness between them that jumped out at me was the likeness each one raised between its protagonist and antagonist: when Ursula tells Ariel that “‘In a way, we’re the same, you and I,'” due to King Triton’s attempts to control both of them, it echoes the Colonel, who has manipulated and controlled Elvis in the capacity of his manager, telling him that “‘We are the same, you and I,'” in being “‘two odd, lonely children, reaching for eternity.'”\n\nIn Elvis, the way eyes look play a critical role in the Colonel’s realization that Elvis is his “destiny” when he sees Elvis perform and is affected not so much by his performance itself as its effect on the girls in the audience; with the camera zeroing in on one of these female spectators, the Colonel’s voiceover intones that “I could see in that girl’s eyes that she was having feelings she wasn’t sure she should enjoy,” having previously articulated such feelings as the primary characteristic of the most successful carnival acts. Elvis’s mother echoes this when she tells Elvis with foreboding: “‘I don’t know how to explain it. But I saw it in that girl’s eyes. It’s something beyond us, but I know that whatever it is, it’s something that…It’s something that can come between us.'”\n\nThe way eyes look are indirectly foregrounded in the 2023 Little Mermaid with the inclusion of the epigraph in the movie’s opening shot from the narrative’s source text by Hans Christian Andersen stating “…mermaids have no tears, and therefore they suffer more.” The full passage from the source text (available here) reads: “When the sisters rose, arm-in-arm, through the water in this way, their youngest sister would stand quite alone, looking after them, ready to cry, only that the mermaids have no tears, and therefore they suffer more.” With this epigraph–a literary device I don’t think I’ve seen in any other Disney movie–Marshall signals that this remake is taking as much from Andersen’s original tale as from Disney’s ’89 take on it, including but not limited to the function of tears as a key transitional marker. While Ariel’s eyes appear to water with tears at a couple of points while she remains a mermaid underwater, the tears do not actually fall from her eyes until the film’s end, when she is a human leaving her mermaid father behind for her new human husband. She can now shed the water her body contains because she has shed the water containing her body–or rather, her father Triton has enabled her to shed it by being the one with the power to finally change her into a human, a patriarchal vestige Marshall was apparently unable or unwilling to find a workaround for. (The “little mermaid”‘s father has no significant role in Andersen’s original tale; rather her grandmother exercises a prominent influence, which appears to be a narrative aspect of Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, which, based on the trailers for it that ran before The Little Mermaid, appears to be something of a Little Mermaid riff if not a ripoff.)\n\n“Bambi eyes” have become synonymous with a sort of infantilized femininity, as evidenced by a PVA student using it in reference to the character Rory Gilmore in the context of one student presentation; this happened to be the same week a PVA freshman used this descriptor in a story they wrote in what would appear to be a more common context when the phrase is Googled, that of the cosmetics industry: “Mascara is smudged into my Bambi eyes.” Another example, from an old profile of Taylor Swift:\n\nShe is in the midst of her second world tour, and every show begins with a moment in which she stands silently at the lip of the stage and listens to her fans scream. She tilts her head from side to side and appears to blink back tears—the expression, which is projected onto a pair of Jumbotron screens, is part Bambi, part Baby June.\n\nLizzie Widdicombe, “You Belong With Me” (October 3, 2011).\n\nThe childlike aspect of the “Bambi eyes” is apparently deliberate:\n\nAppeal in animation is a key principal that was highly valued by Disney himself (Johnston & Thomas, 1981). Animators took to using the scientific principal of neotony, the act of making a character childlike, with large eyes and a head that is out of proportion to its body, in order to make the character more appealing (Johnston & Thomas, 1981).\n\nStacey L. Simmons, Arrival of the Queen: New Archetypes in Disney Feature Films\n\nImplications for Depth Psychology (2016).\n\nThe legacy of these “Bambi eyes” would seem to extend to Disney’s princesses. In a feminist takedown of the original Little Mermaid on the ’90s ABC sitcom Step by Step in episode 5.9, “The Wall,” the character Dana Foster observes: “‘Here we have Ariel. Another helpless doe-eyed female waiting to be saved, by her brainless Ken doll boyfriend.'” (It should be noted that Disney owns ABC and Dana’s feminism functions as the butt of repeated jokes: we are meant to find her feminist reading of The Little Mermaid laughably absurd, as reinforced when Cody Lambert, the character who functions as the moral center of the show before being excised due to the actor playing him engaging in real-life domestic abuse, tells her to “lighten up” and offers his reading that The Little Mermaid is “like, a beautiful sweet little story about the power of love.”)\n\nThe “doe-eyed” trait even extends to the rare Disney female protagonist who is not a princess: reading Camille Rose Garcia’s Gothic illustrations of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland “through a Disney lens,” Jade Dillon observes the “the docile, doe-eyed young girl of Disney’s construction” in their rendering of Lewis Carroll’s young female protagonist.\n\nYet there has also been another descriptor for Ariel’s eyes: Ariel is “still a saucer-eyed beauty of sylph-like proportions” according to David Whitley. While echoing a descriptor that Richard Chizmar used for the character of Gwendy discussed in the previous post, being “saucer-eyed” resonates with the aforementioned food-chain hierarchy themes in The Little Mermaid via the lyrics in “Under the Sea” that “the fish on land ain’t happy” because “One day when the boss get hungry / Guess who’s gon’ be on the plate?”\n\nIn keeping with the themes of hierarchy, Ryan Bunch juxtaposes images of Snow White from below with Ariel from above…\n\n…in an article about the ’89 film’s expression of queer difference:\n\nI saw The Little Mermaid (1989) when I was fourteen. With its spectacular animation and exhilarating musical numbers, it was like nothing I’d ever seen before. Watching Ariel sing about her longing for a better place to a soaring melody while floating in the water with her hair expressively swirling around her face reached deep into my own feelings of difference in the midst of an inexpressibly queer adolescence.\n\nRyan Bunch, “Soaring into Song: Youth and Yearning in Animated Musicals of the Disney Renaissance,” American Music (Summer 2021).\n\nIn keeping with refiguring Ariel from passive looked-at object to active looking subject…\n\n…Sean Griffin, in his study of gay readings of Disney texts, invokes the concept of the “subject position”–the subject does the acting whereas the object is acted upon:\n\n…regarding the “more obvious” homosexual readings of Disney…if reading from a “lesbian/gay sensibility” is no longer so “underground,” it becomes harder and harder to argue that such a subject position is radical or subversive. If the Walt Disney Company is not only aware of the “gay subtext”…but actively putting it into the text, a “gay sensibility” is not resisting the work but coming closer to the “ideal subject position.”\n\nSean Griffin, Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out (2000), p. 180.\n\nIs it subversive to read The Little Mermaid as a gay, trans, or nonbinary allegory? That Howard Ashman, producer and lyricist of the ’89 version was gay, as is Rob Marshall, director of the ’23 version (who also produced it with his creative and life partner John DeLuca), while Andersen, writer of the original fairy tale, was bisexual, makes such readings potentially less subversive, but even if they weren’t created by queer people, the content of the narrative would still be ripe for such readings.\n\nSupporting a nonbinary reading, in the ’89 version Ariel and Eric actually look quite similar–their hair swoops the same way in the front, and if you removed their hair entirely, their faces would be hard to distinguish if Ariel weren’t wearing lipstick. It appears I’m not the only one who’s perceived this likeness…\n\nIn the updated version, Ariel and Eric might look more distinct physically/externally, but they look more similar internally, as emphasized by their shared penchant for collecting artifacts from other cultures. As Marshall comments:\n\n“The great thing is we were able to find these two kindred spirits that have similar journeys,” he explained. “They both feel displaced, they both feel they want something more and they’re not afraid of someone who’s different from them, or a culture that’s different from them.”\n\nJo Berry, “How The Little Mermaid differs from the Disney animation” (May 26, 2023).\n\nSuch readings also potentially seem in line with one offered by some of PVA’s most recent graduating seniors: that the old animated Disney princes (as from the original Snow White and Cinderella) “look like butch lesbians.” I suggested this could be because the exclusively male designing animators from that period were men who were used to looking at women but never examined themselves. I.e., patriarchy.\n\nAs the film concludes with Ariel in Prince Eric’s arms, the dangerous message about appropriation and the sanitized cost of access cannot be ignored. Yet, even though Ariel has been complicit in the death of Ursula, and the destined alliance with patriarchy is fulfilled, I remain hopeful. After all, Ariel enters the white male system with her voice-a stolen, flying voice that erupted amidst patriarchal language, a voice no longer innocent because it resided for a time in the dark continent that is the Medusa’s home.\n\n…\n\nPerhaps I’m guilty of Tania Modleski’s charge that feminist critics often label a text feminist simply because we enjoyed it.\n\nLaura Sells, “‘Where Do the Mermaids Stand?’: Voice and Body in The Little Mermaid,” From Mouse to Mermaid: The Politics of Film, Gender, and Culture, ed. Elizabeth Bell (1995).\n\nAnd as a final peripheral point to the lens of eyes, it’s worth noting that one aspect of the remake that seems an effort to render it more feminist and inclusive (but introduced the problem of a false vision of racial harmony) was the casting of Noma Dumezweni as Prince Eric’s mother; Dumezweni played a significant character on Netflix series The Watcher (2022). The remake’s accentuated colonialism is primarily at play through the dynamic between Eric and his adoptive Black mother, with the reticence of the latter to explore outside the reaches of their island contrasted negatively with Eric’s desire to explore “uncharted waters” (that which Ariel sails off for with him at the end) in order to ensure their culture doesn’t “get left behind”–i.e., looking at hegemonic imperialism through quite the optimistic lens. At the end, Eric’s mother gives him her blessing to “‘change the world–or whatever it is you have to do so we don’t get left behind.'” The violent invasion of other cultures/countries would technically qualify as changing the world to not get left behind.\n\nThe watch itself has played a significant role in Disney’s history via merchandise:\n\nKamen’s firm quickly monetized Mickey Mouse‘s image, providing a much-needed line of cash to the struggling Disney firm through its Walt Disney Enterprises division. The following year, Kamen’s firm developed the Mickey Mouse watch, which was produced by Ingersoll-Waterbury and soon became the bestselling watch in the United States.[6][7] By 1948, revenue of licensed Disney products totaled more than $100 million.[7]\n\nFrom here.\n\nThen there’s the important narrative lesson of the dysfunctional Cinderella watch in Picture Perfect (1997), as well as other Disney watches…\n\nEyes change as the times change.\n\n-SCR\n\nThe day after my father died in 2017, I came in to teach my regularly scheduled classes at PVA. My supervisor was more than willing to give me the day off, but I thought the diversion of teaching would be better than sitting at home all day before I could make the trip home. I was right. The story we were reading for the student presentation in the advanced class was Stephen King’s “Strawberry Spring” and generated a diverting discussion. That semester another student ended up selecting “The Lawnmower Man” from the same Stephen King collection, Night Shift (1977), for their presentation, commenting that the movie adaptation of this story was not worth speaking of. This month marks the release of an adaptation of another story from this old collection, “The Boogeyman,” which, on an episode of The Kingcast, its director Rob Savage said its writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods pitched as both an adaptation of and a sequel to the original story. I’d say it’s worth speaking of.\n\nSince Disney has acquired the studio 20th Century Fox, this horror movie is technically a Disney production. Even if I hadn’t been actively researching connections between Stephen King and Disney, the fact that the remake of The Little Mermaid was also just released might have led me to notice a similarity between these two adaptations–new additions to the source material rendering a dead mother critical to the narrative, albeit to varying degrees.\n\n“The Boogeyman” is a story so short that a film adaptation would have to expand it, which this one does by exploring the dynamics of the family of the therapist in the original who supplies the narrative frame: the entire story is narrated to him by a patient. In the movie, the family dynamics pivot on a dead mother, the therapist’s wife, who has died in a car accident shortly before this patient comes in to tell him how the boogeyman has killed all of his children. As the boogeyman starts to terrorize the therapist’s younger daughter, his older daughter starts attempting to summon the spirit of the dead mother. While there are numerous unequivocal cues that the monster is “real” within the context of the film and not just a figment of any of the characters’ imaginations, the cue that the dead mother’s spirit is present and helps intervene in the climactic battle with the monster cements this monster as an effective allegory for grief.\n\nIn The Boogeyman a recurring dress of the dead mother’s also embodies her symbolic presence, not unlike how a dress in The Little Mermaid is used as a visual cue to emphasize the loss of Ariel’s human form when she turns back into a mermaid.\n\nThe function of guilt is also an interesting overlap between these texts. In The Boogeyman, the father-therapist suggests that his patient’s claim of the Boogeyman killing his children is a projection of his guilt for killing the children himself, and so it takes him awhile to come around and believe his daughters that the Boogeyman is real. This aspect of his character is intertwined with his (ironic for a therapist) inability to talk about his dead wife with his daughters, again linking the monster’s terror to processing the mother’s death. In The Little Mermaid, the function of guilt is more indirect, with one critic claiming the film is targeting an audience of “guilt-ridden millennials.” What are they guilty about?\n\nLike so many of Disney’s live-action remakes, this movie is for the now-middle aged millennial women who grew up watching (and loving) the 1989 original — only to become scandalised, as adults, by their heterocentrism, their whiteness, their phobias and isms.\n\nKat Rosenfeld, “The Little Mermaid is Disney propaganda,” UnHerd (June 5, 2023).\n\n(If The Boogeyman is about processing guilt as well as grief, and is technically a Disney movie, can it be read as processing the guilt of loving older problematic Disney movies?)\n\nThe erasure of the mother might also be part of this guilt, which brings us to Disney’s dead mother trope. One comprehensive study of the representation of family structures in animated Disney movies found that nearly half represented single-parent households, which the company apparently considers an effective plot device:\n\nOur results indicated that close to half (41.3%) of Disney animated films depicted a single parent family. Don Hahn, an executive producer for some of the most well-known Disney animated films (including Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King), provided commentary for this storyline selection:\n\n“I never talk about this, but I will. One reason is practical because the movies are 80 or 90 min long, and Disney films are about growing up. They’re about that day in your life when you have to accept responsibility. Simba ran away from home but had to come back. In shorthand, it’s much quicker to have characters grow up when you bump off their parents. Bambi’s mother gets killed, so he has to grow up. Belle only has a father, but he gets lost, so she has to step into that position. It’s a story shorthand.” (Radloff 2014)\n\nJessica D. Zurcher, Sarah M. Webb and Tom Robinson, “The Portrayal of Families across Generations in Disney Animated Films,” Social Sciences (Basel), vol. 7, no. 3 (2018), 11 (boldface mine).\n\nWhile at times the single parent in these households is the mother, more often it’s the father, because the mother is dead:\n\nWhen the mother is alive and present, she is as good a mother as she possibly can be. However, she is powerless, for whatever reason, to really help her child, thus forcing the child to save him- or herself. Most often, however, she is not only dead, she is never even mentioned. Fathers are a little luckier in Disney. They are rarely killed, and whereas only a handful of Disney characters have mothers, many more – nineteen out of thirty-nine – have fathers. Granted, where there are fathers, they are often just as incapable of protecting their offspring as are the mothers…\n\nAmy M. Davis, Good Girls and Wicked Witches: Women in Disney’s Feature Animation (2006), 103.\n\nIn keeping with the tactic of “corrections” of some of the problematic aspects of its source material in Disney’s live remakes, some of these films have “corrected” the dead or absent mother not by bringing her back to life, but by explaining what happened to her, often in ways that then become critical to the overall narrative. So it’s not the death or absence itself that’s corrected so much as the utter lack of explanation for it that, when taken as a pattern, seems to render the figure of the mother utterly irrelevant, which is ironic in light of the technically critical nature of any mother figure–if the characters weren’t born, none of the events in the movie could happen.\n\nSo, to sum up some of Disney’s mother-related corrections:\n\nIn Beauty and the Beast (2017), we learn that Belle’s mother died from plague in a new twist on the magic that the Beast in his isolated castle has at his fingertips–or rather, his claw tips. The nature of this magic was narratively troublesome to Linda Woolverton, the screenwriter of the ’91 animated version (groundbreaking for being the first animated movie to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, and the first Disney animated feature to be penned by a woman):\n\nWoolverton also questioned a change that saw the Beast come and go from his castle via a magic mirror. “The castle is supposed to be impenetrable,” she says. “After that, the mythology didn’t work for me.”\n\nFrom here.\n\nIn The Little Mermaid update, we learn that Ariel’s father Triton hates humans so much, and is thus dead set against Ariel’s most burning desire, because humans were responsible for the death of Ariel’s mother, which is set up by the live film opening with the men on Eric’s ship attempting to harpoon what they think is a mermaid (which they’re doing so because they believe an aspect of mermaid mythology that was not prominent in the original–that mermaids will lure and kill men with their siren song). One critic also reads Ursula the villainous sea-witch as “maternal,” and if Ursula’s death constitutes the narrative’s climax, this interpretation renders the climax itself a “matricide,” or death of the mother:\n\nAriel sacrifices her connection to the feminine in the matricide of Ursula, the only other strong female character in the film. Eventually, Ariel achieves access by participating with Eric in the slaughtering of Ursula, relegating her and that which she signifies to silence and absence. Ursula is reassigned to the position of the repressed that keeps the system functioning. Embedded in gynophobic imagery, Ursula is a revolting, grotesque image of the smothering maternal figure (Trites 1990/91). Of course, within Disney’s patriarchal ideology, any woman with power has to be represented as a castrating bitch.\n\nLaura Sells, “‘Where Do the Mermaids Stand?’: Voice and Body in The Little Mermaid,” From Mouse to Mermaid: The Politics of Film, Gender, and Culture, ed. Elizabeth Bell (1995), 181.\n\nEric also gets an adopted Black mother in the update (in addition to a dead father), one whose race is supposed to be a correction of a lack of diversity but in turn introduces the problem of rendering a picture of racial harmony that erases the history of slavery attendant to its apparent 18th-century Caribbean setting.\n\nIn the Pinocchio (1940) update released last year, Geppetto is rendered a widow and Pinocchio a re-creation of his dead son. No explanation appears to be provided for how either of them died.\n\nIn the Peter Pan (1953) update released this year, Peter Pan & Wendy, we learn that Captain Hook and Peter Pan used to be friends until Hook, then going by James, wanted to leave Neverland because he missed his mother. But he ended up abducted by pirates on his way out and never saw her again.\n\nThe original Dumbo (1941) provides an interesting exception to Disney main characters lacking mothers: Dumbo has no father and no explanation as to where he might be–despite his mother being referred to as Mrs. Jumbo. The mother’s absence, if not her literal death, becomes a critical aspect of the plot when she’s chained up as a “mad elephant” after defending Dumbo from mockery and physical assault, leaving Dumbo to fend for himself. Since Dumbo is one of the shortest “full-length” animated features, barely over an hour, the 2019 remake entails almost an entire narrative overhaul, with the addition of new–human–characters whose conflict is constituted by–you guessed it–a dead mother, in this case one who’s died of influenza, since the film is set in 1919. This time setting engenders a father figure who lost his arm in the war and returning does not know how to manage the parental duties that were his wife’s domain, as emphasized to an obnoxious degree by the equally obnoxious daughter character (and equally obnoxious actress) saying un-subtle things like “‘Mom would have done something.'”\n\nThe King of Disney\n\nDisney’s influence on Stephen King can be traced along many lines, but the original Dumbo and Peter Pan would seem to be especially prominent Disney texts for him. In his fantasy magnum opus Dark Tower series, King inserts himself as a character who is writing the story, and when some of the main characters are about to meet this King-character in book 6 out of 7 of the series, Song of Susannah (2004), one character “sensed it: … the gathering power. … Eddie found himself thinking of Tinkerbell’s magic dust and Dumbo’s magic feather.” This would seem to figure King as possessing a “magic” on par with Disney’s, but on closer examination, the functions of the magic dust and magic feather, while similar–both are related to the ability to fly and to a prominent character who does not get any spoken dialog–they are markedly different. King invokes the function of Dumbo’s magic feather in a nonfiction discussion of writing:\n\nDumbo got airborne with the help of a magic feather; you may feel the urge to grasp a passive verb or one of those nasty adverbs for the same reason. Just remember before you do that Dumbo didn’t need the feather; the magic was in him.\n\nStephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft (2000).\n\nDumbo turns out not to need the magic feather to fly: put another way, the feather is not actually magic. Tinkerbell’s magic dust, on the other hand, is necessary for the ability to fly–and thus is, in the context of its narrative, actually magic. I’ve started to think of these two types of Disney magic as representative of a bifurcation/duality King himself has articulated in his 1980 essay “On Becoming a Brand Name”–King the brand, and King the writer. As the former, King has the power to promote other writers in what is the symbolic equivalent of sprinkling Tinkerbell’s magic dust on them, making their books figuratively “fly” in the marketplace. If you recall the bold gold color associated with this magic dust in the animated version, King’s magic dust in this sense is akin to the Midas touch: if he endorses you as a writer, he turns your book into gold. I’ve seen this happen with my fiction teacher from college, Justin Cronin, who got King’s Midas touch magic dust sprinkled on his Passage trilogy (which I’ve discussed here). Cronin’s first book since this trilogy, The Ferryman, just came out, promoted, again, by King. You can ascertain the significance of King’s magic dust in the number of times King’s name comes up in interviews with Cronin like this local Houston show. (King himself called in to Good Morning America during Cronin’s appearance there to promote the first Passage book back in 2010.)\n\nAnother bifurcation/duality reflected in the concepts of brand versus writer exists in the academic concepts clarified by the scholar Alan Bryman of “Disneyization,” which describes Disney’s branding influence (primarily through their theme parks), versus “Disneyfication,” which describes Disney’s narrative influence. The dead mother/dead parent trope would be an aspect of the latter, which is used in the film Escape from Tomorrow (2013):\n\nHis paternal loss places the young boy in the pantheon of children featured in Disney films who lack one or both parents and learn how to navigate the world for themselves.\n\nAviva Briefel, “Mickey Horror: Escape from Tomorrow and the Gothic Attack on Disney,” Film Quarterly , Vol. 68, No. 4 (Summer 2015), 42.\n\nThis article posits that this movie’s filmmaker Randy “Moore relies on long-familiar images of what Barbara Creed terms the ‘monstrous-feminine’ to convey … a gothic account of the parks’ cooption by a dangerous female consumerism that nullifies male resistance or escape” (36-37). Moore is quoted to support this reading:\n\n“[Visitors to Disney parks] want to revert back to the womb, to the safety they had as a child. It’s the ultimate nanny state.”\n\nAviva Briefel, “Mickey Horror: Escape from Tomorrow and the Gothic Attack on Disney,” Film Quarterly , Vol. 68, No. 4 (Summer 2015), 37.\n\nAnd a footnote further notes:\n\nAs Max Axelrod suggests, Disney’s stepmothers and fairy godmothers are connected in their roles as nonbiological substitutes for real (and often absent) mothers (31). Max Axelrod, “Beauties and Their Beasts & Other Motherless Tales from the Wonderful World of Walt Disney,” in The Emperor’s Old Groove: Decolonizing Disney’s Magic Kingdom, ed. Brenda Ayres (New York: Peter Lang, 2003), 31.\n\nAviva Briefel, “Mickey Horror: Escape from Tomorrow and the Gothic Attack on Disney,” Film Quarterly , Vol. 68, No. 4 (Summer 2015), 43.\n\nIn its critique of Disney (or more specifically, of “Disneyization”), this film essentially inverts Disney’s dead-mother trope by rendering the Disney parks as a killer mother (hence the dead parent being the father). A horror movie set at Disney World, Escape from Tomorrow looks at Disney through a Stephen-King lens, an inverted version of what this post is doing in looking at Stephen King through a Disney lens.\n\nThere are other prominent Disney aspects that have influenced King apart from types of magic. In response to the question of why he writes horror, he has claimed that “‘[t]he first movie I ever saw was a horror movie. It was Bambi’.” This is due to the forest fire sequence as well as to what is probably Disney’s most iconic dead mother, Bambi’s shot by the unseen hunter.\n\nIf the narrative use of dead mothers could be read as a sign of Disney’s influence on King (as a narrative influence, this would be a way King has been “Disneyfied”), this merges with the two Disney magic types in the recent Gwendy’s Button Box trilogy, which makes prominent use of a magic feather and Peter Pan references. The name of the title character, Gwendy, is:\n\n“A combination. My father wanted a Gwendolyn—that was his granny’s name—and my mom wanted a Wendy, like in Peter Pan. So they compromised.”\n\nStephen King and Richard Chizmar, Gwendy’s Button Box (2017).\n\nAs you can see, King co-wrote this book, handing it off to Chizmar to finish when he “ran out of gas”; having started the story, King is responsible for the title character’s partially Disney-derived name. Book 2 of the Gwendy trilogy, Gwendy’s Magic Feather (2019), Chizmar wrote by himself in what amounts to another example of the power of the King Midas touch magic dust. King’s name appears twice on the book’s cover despite the fact that he did not co-write this one:\n\nThe narrative further develops connections to past King characters and events associated with what Chizmar himself calls the “sacred ground” of the fictional King setting of Castle Rock. The story seems to depend on these connections to garner reader interest instead of developing a compelling narrative in its own right. The pacing is completely off, as evidenced by the late introduction of the titular object at the book’s halfway point. This clunkiness is compounded by the fact that the late introduction places Gwendy’s procuring of the feather at a point in time not long before the events in the first book, which never once mentions this feather, undermining that the feather is as significant to Gwendy as this book’s title would imply. The book seems more a collection of subplots with no main plot–rather it’s more of a plod through a too detailed accounting of Gwendy’s daily activities.\n\nKing’s penchant for sentimentality is another marker of Disney’s influence on him, but Chizmar’s use of it goes too far for my taste in Gwendy’s father’s articulation of the feather’s meaning:\n\nGwendy thinks about her father’s words from earlier: “We all poked fun at you about that feather, Gwen, but you didn’t care. You believed. That’s what mattered then, and that’s what matters now: you’ve always been a believer. That beautiful heart of yours has led you down some unexpected roads, but your faith—in yourself, in others, in the world around you—has always guided you. That’s what that magic feather of yours stands for.”\n\nRichard Chizmar, Gwendy’s Magic Feather (2019).\n\nDespite the book never explicitly mentioning Dumbo, the description of this function aligns with its non-magical function in that narrative. This places it in contradistinction to the function of the titular object from the first book, the button box, which, like Tinkerbell’s dust, is actually magical. Chizmar’s description of the feather’s origin comes closer to referencing Peter Pan in deriving from “an Indian chief who used to live around here. He was also a medicine man, a very powerful one,” which resonates with both the stereotypical treatment of Native Americans as “the red man” in Disney’s Peter Pan King’s associations of stereotypes with small-minded Mainers (the feather’s “Indian chief” origin is shown to be a made-up lie by the kid who sells the feather to Gwendy, essentially painting this con-man kid as a version of Disney himself). Chizmar also has Gwendy think of the co-worker she considers her mentor “​​as Tinkerbell, the wand-waving, miniature flying guardian angel of her childhood.”\n\nIn the 2019 Dumbo, the obnoxious daughter character with the dead mother wears a key around her neck that serves a similar psychological placebo function as the non-magical feather:\n\n“My momma told me there’d be times when my life seemed locked behind a door. So, she gave me this key, that her momma gave her. And said whenever I have that feeling, imagine that door…and just turn the key.”\n\nDumbo (2019).\n\nThis heavy-handed object, planted early with the above dialog that would violate Robert Boswell’s use of narrative spandrels discussed here, returns in a later critical moment that updates the development when Dumbo learns he doesn’t need the feather to fly, after his feather burns up in a fire:\n\n“Dumbo, remember this? From my momma? I can unlock any door. And you can, too. But I don’t need\n\nthis key to do it. And you don’t need the feather. Come on.”\n\nDumbo (2019).\n\nAnd she throws the key into the same burning tent where Dumbo’s magic feather ignited, festooned with the posters advertising Dumbo’s performance with his picture and a single word: “BELIEVE.”\n\nGwendy’s Magic Feather‘s underdeveloped chronic-tension conflict purports to revolve around Gwendy’s struggle with the question of whether her successes are the result of her own abilities or the magic of the button box. This chronic tension is brought to a head by the equally underdeveloped acute tension conflict of a serial killer operating in Castle Rock whose identity Gwendy uncovers via the unequivocally magical ability of a psychic button-box-induced vision when she touches him, after which point he is apprehended quickly and easily, and with Gwendy not even present–a rushed narrative climax with absolutely no tension. In the resolution, the bestower of the magical button box comes to collect it and resolves her chronic tension issue in what manifests a total narrative contradiction:\n\n“Your life is indeed your own. The stories you’ve chosen to tell, the people you’ve chosen to fight for, the lives you’ve touched …” He waves his hand through the air in front of his face. “All your own doing. Not the button box’s. You have always been special, Gwendy Peterson, from the day you were born.”\n\nGwendy forgets to breathe for a moment. She feels an enormous weight crumble from atop her shoulders, from around her heart. “Thank you,” she manages, voice trembling.\n\nRichard Chizmar, Gwendy’s Magic Feather (2019).\n\nIn addition to plainly bad writing at the sentence level, this reinforcement of what the not-actually-magic titular magic feather stands for completely violates what was shown by the critical and clearly magical role of the button box in the (anti)climax. This false conclusion that Gwendy can do it all on her own without the magic of the button box reads like an allegory for Chizmar trying to convince himself that the success of this book would be the product of his own abilities as a writer and not have anything to do with assistance from King’s magic dust branding, when that assistance is not only clearly everywhere (the cover promotion, King characters and settings, the continuation of a narrative King himself started), but all the book has going for it.\n\nThe serial killer that should be the main conflict but is not properly developed as such is nicknamed the “Tooth Fairy” (due to his penchant for pulling the teeth of his victims), which would thematically connect to t"
