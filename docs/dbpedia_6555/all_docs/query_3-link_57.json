        "text": "Brad Pitt's performance as the notorious 19th century gunslinger and folk legend in \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" recently won him a Best Actor award at the Venice Film Festival, based, most likely on his choice to play Jesse as a sometimes thoughtful, sometimes smoldering, always dangerous, very confused man. Pitt, first noticed by most audiences for his portrayal of the slippery J.D. in the 1991 film \"Thelma & Louise,\" and whose best performance might be in the little-seen \"Snatch,\" has gone on to become one of the most popular leading men in the business, and a very busy producer. He remains in the spotlight, often to his chagrin, due to his very public relationship with Angeline Jolie.\n\nJesses James was quite famous. Have you thought about the parallels of celebrity culture in the film and in Hollywood today?\n\nI think it’s one aspect of the film. Getting into the story, I was surprised to see how much of a tabloid quotient was alive and well in the media at that time, still operated by sensationalism and a complete fabrication beyond the facts. It was curious for me to see that not much had changed besides quantity.\n\nIs it safe to call this a Western?\n\nIt’s probably misleading as far as the way we understand the genre. It’s probably better to call it a psychological drama; we’ve even called it a gangster film. It’s hard to come up with one category that accurately describes it.\n\nWe know from the title that Jesse is killed in the film. Why did he allow himself to be shot?\n\nThis is something the historians argue over. There was the fact that he gave the gift of a gun to his would-be assassin, and that he took his gun belts off at what would become the moment of his assassination, which he never did. So the two the theories are one, that he had full knowledge of what the Ford brothers were capable of and were after, and was taunting them and would take them out at later time. But that was a bad gamble. The other argument is that he was unhinged, that he was weary of this life on the run, and that it was actually a puppeteered suicide. But it remains ambiguous. I kind of played with both, then trusted [director] Andrew [Dominik] to shape it as what would play best.\n\nYour character switches from vulnerable to vicious and back again. Did you take it home with you?\n\nNo, I hear stories of actors not being able to put away the role. That’s never been my affliction. I usually have more difficulty getting to the role, and I’m very happy to put it down when it’s done. But the mercurial aspect of the character – what was most interesting to me – is that he was a man who could see the end coming. I really relied on Andrew to keep the reins on that, and it paid off.\n\nThere's a rumor that the Smith & Wesson you used in the movie had the same serial number as Jesse's gun …\n\nThese are things that don’t amount to anything on film, but they can be important to the actor. Little things that meant something to me that made it feel a bit authentic. It’s silly, maybe it’s even superstitious, but for me it makes sense.\n\nHow did you prepare for this part compared with preparing for other roles?\n\nThe preparation is all the same, whether it be a comedy or this or anything else. It comes with research and study, and you start to narrow in on an idea you’re gonna try out. It really gets shaped in the first few weeks through trial and error – what’s feeling right and what’s feeling wrong. But I had a nice advantage being from Missouri, the same area [Jesse was from], and I drew from the cadence and the temper of how people relate there. I also drew from the dialect. I was comfortable with horses and did a little quick draw, and I was ready to go.\n\nHow did you get into producing?\n\nI wanted to be a part of stories that I wouldn’t necessarily be right for [as an actor]. A lot of producing, at least from my point, is really about getting out of the way and letting the director go where he needs to go. It’s also being a bumper between the artistic side and the financial side, and helping the two get along. The most important thing I’ve found, from the little experience I’ve had, is that it’s quality control, from inception to when it’s being released.\n\nIs it upsetting to have lost your anonymity?\n\nI know the deal. I understand the trade-off. There are great perks to what we do; we get to travel and see the world. And we manage it. The only time it becomes unmanageable to me is when it’s a full frontal assault on the kids, and unfortunately there is no line concerning family these days. That’s the only thing that really bothers me. But it goes back to having a love for movies and wanting to be a part of movies and tell stories and be really good at it. That’s your focus. Then when this other thing comes along, it cam be discombobulating. But you acclimate.\n\nDo you get much constructive criticism from Angelina?\n\nYeah, in fact, I rely on it. She’s the best sounding board I have. And I value her opinion immensely. She pisses me off sometimes, but she’s really good.\n\nWhat’s your favorite George Clooney film?\n\n(laughs) Go see \"Red Surf.\""
