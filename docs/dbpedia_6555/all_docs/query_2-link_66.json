In it, Denzel Washington stars as Robert McCall, a former black-ops operative who longs for a life away from violence.

Critics praised the film’s balance between tension-filled moments and explosive action, with Washington’s portrayal of McCall adding layers of depth and complexity to the character.\n\nWatch The Equalizer on Netflix.\n\nCold Pursuit (2019)\n\nIn the world of action movies, goons should know better than to mess with Liam Neeson. In Cold Pursuit, he portrays Nels Coxman, a snowplow driver whose quiet life shatters after his son’s mysterious death. Fueled by rage and a thirst for revenge, Coxman sets out to find the culprits. His investigation leads him to a vicious drug cartel controlled by a brutal man named Viking.\n\nAs Coxman strategically eliminates cartel members, he unwittingly ignites a vicious war between rival gangs. Cold Pursuit is more than just the average revenge thriller. It masterfully blends action sequences with dark humor, making it a standout in the genre. Without a doubt, the scene where Coxman uses an unconventional item as a weapon will surprise you and your dad.\n\nWatch Cold Pursuit on Netflix.\n\n21 Bridges (2019)\n\nOne of Chadwick Boseman’s final movies, 21 Bridges is an action-packed film that follows Andre Davis, an NYPD detective on the hunt for cop killers. After a drug deal explodes in violence, Davis uncovers a shocking conspiracy that reaches deep within the police department. In a desperate move to trap the culprits, he orders the unprecedented closure of all 21 bridges connecting Manhattan.\n\nJoined by narcotics detective Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller), Davis races against time to catch the killers and bring the corrupt officers to justice.

With its perfect blend of suspense and action, as well as Boseman’s exhilarating performance, the underrated Netflix movie is a fitting tribute to the dads who stand as pillars of strength and integrity.\n\nWatch 21 Bridges on Netflix.\n\nThe Accountant (2016)\n\nForget the boring stereotypes, the protagonist in The Accountant is anything but ordinary. Starring Ben Affleck as Christian Wolff, the movie follows a mathematical whiz who finds comfort in numbers but struggles with social interaction. However, Wolff has a secret sideline: working as a top-tier financial adviser for powerful criminal organizations. His world gets turned upside down when a relentless treasury agent starts closing in on him.\n\nTo divert attention, Wolff takes on a legitimate client — a high-tech robotics company with a suspicious accounting issue. Joining forces with a perceptive accounting clerk (Anna Kendrick), he uncovers a hidden web of corruption worth millions. It’s an excellent action film to enjoy with fathers as it explores the protagonist’s unique perspective that ultimately makes him a complex and surprisingly relatable hero.\n\nWatch The Accountant on Netflix.\n\nExtraction (2020)\n\nIf you and your dad are action junkies, you should definitely add Extraction to your watchlist. It tells the story of Tyler Rake, a mercenary on a high-stakes rescue mission. Tyler has to snatch a teenager from the clutches of danger in the wild streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and navigate narrow alleyways, shady gangs, and cops who are more interested in lining their pockets than helping anyone.\n\nAs Rake fights his way through the chaos, viewers get glimpses of a troubled past that fuels his mission. Critics raved about the film’s intense pace and jaw-dropping stunts, especially the epic one-shot action sequence that lasts over 10 minutes. Extraction highlights a story about protection and sacrifice, something many dads can relate to."
