Soon it becomes apparent this isn't a typical dinner theater.\n\nAvailable on Netflix.\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\nIn indie horror movie Host, six friends hire a medium to hold a seance over Zoom during quarantine lockdown. What starts out as something that feels like a prank turns into a paranormal nightmare.\n\nThe film stars Haley Bishop (Deep State), Radina Drandova (Dawn of the Deaf), Edward Linard (The Rebels), Jemma Moore (Doom: Annihilation), Caroline Ward (Stalling It) and Emma Louise Webb (The Crown), who all operated their own video cameras, created practical effects and lit their own scenes.\n\nDue to social-distancing precautions during quarantine, director Rob Savage never set foot in the same room as his actors during production and instead directed them remotely.\n\nAvailable on Amazon Prime Video (with Shudder add-on).\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\nBad Hair, a horror satire set in 1989, follows an ambitious young Black woman (Elle Lorraine) who gets a hair weave to succeed in the image-obsessed world of music television. However, her flourishing career comes at a great cost when she realizes her new hair may have a mind of its own.

In fact, it's not really the monsters themselves that are the true threat in many of these creepy stories, but the people they encounter.\n\nWhile every episode includes an unusual creature from a myth or urban legend, it's the underlying themes of family, betrayal, love, envy, greed and guilt that drive home the horror.\n\nAvailable on Hulu.\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\nIn Haunt, a group of friends encounters an extreme Halloween haunted house that promises to tap into their innermost darkest fears.\n\nThe movie has plenty of jump scares, but the inventive way each escape room is set up will keep you entertained all the way to the end.\n\nAvailable on Amazon Prime Video (with Shudder add-on).\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\nThe Taking of Deborah Logan is a found-footage supernatural horror film that follows a team of would-be filmmakers who want to make a documentary about Deborah (Jill Larson), an elderly woman who has Alzheimer's disease.
