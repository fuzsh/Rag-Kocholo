        "text": "Quality script and good acting, with an authentic story to boot. So why does it all seem so familiar? ‘Sand Castle’ is destined to be one of those films that’s unappreciated in it’s lifetime due to an overexposure of the conflict, but in 20 years time might just be heralded as a highlight of the genre.\n\nNetflix has been creating its own content for a while now, but recently it has started to churn out war films. Not big sweeping epics like we saw in the 60’s and 70’s, such as ‘The Battle of Britain‘ and ‘A Bridge Too Far‘, but little films about amazingly true stories that are as yet unknown.\n\n‘The Seige of Jadotville‘ told the story of an Irish U.N. peacekeeping mission in Africa that went disastrously wrong whereas ‘War Machine‘, due out later in the month, is a satire on the American war in Afghanistan. Both are based on true events and both attracted some serious acting talent. Netflix seems to be scooping up scripts and pulling in actors, whilst dedicating enough budget to make them look good as well.\n\n‘Sand Castle‘ is no different in these aspects, however if anything its story is even smaller and therefore far more personal than most war films. It is based on the experiences of the writer Chris Roessner, who was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and highlights the impossibility of fighting small wars. It plays out like a less nihilistic ‘Jarhead’ combined with a more intelligent ‘Black Hawk Down’. Anyone who has ever lived in a patrol base within an indigenous population in the last 15 years will recognise the frustrations depicted in ‘Sand Castle’. A small army unit is attached to a special forces team in order to help distribute water and rebuild a damaged facility in an isolated town. A reluctant Private Matt Ocre is taken along for the ride.\n\nFor those of you that have seen it, the trailer is deceiving and in a way that is a huge relief. It makes it seem like the film is going to be primarily about Nicholas Hoult character’s reluctance to fight, whereas thankfully this merely serves as a contrast to the ending and doesn’t dominate the film like it does in ‘Fury‘ and others. It’s more of a starting point for the growth of Private Ocre as the story progresses, as his mindset changes from one of ‘get your head down and get through this’ to ‘I should be trying to do more’. Unlike ‘Fury’ (sorry!) this happens naturally over time and not in an unrealistic 24hr period or through a series of contrived events.\n\nThe trailer also suggests that Henry Cavill’s special forces officer is going to be a bit of a one-dimensional, all-action-hero and a bully, but thankfully they’ve avoided this cliche too. Captain Syverson is one of the better portrayals of an officer in a war film. He’s intelligent, passionate about what he’s doing and willing to listen to the ideas of others. He still swaggers around, chewing tobacco and swearing, but he’s respected and effective.\n\nNow, I know what you’re thinking, “There must be a salt-of-the-earth, officer hating sergeant to round it all off? Someone to unnecessarily create conflict by being insubordinate?”. Nope. They didn’t do that either. Sergeant Harper, played by Logan Marshall-Green (the poor man’s Tom Hardy) is respectful and professional throughout. He’s the stoic rock of the film in a nicely understated way. “So what about the baddies? There must be big boss baddy right? Like ‘Blackhawk Down’?“. Wrong again. You barely see the shadowy insurgents. Just like in real life, they blend into the crowd.\n\nSo if it isn’t about cliched character conflict, (which is the basis for most war films), what on earth is this film all about? Quite simply, it’s about the war itself. In this case the impossibility of fighting a tactical war, when your enemy is an unseen insurgent, and the commanders at a strategic level have little understanding of what’s happening on the ground. You want to help the local population, but they just want to be left alone. It is possibly one of the most realistic war movies to date. The action is quick and gritty, with the insurgents disappearing as quickly as they arrive. There are no long and drawn out set pieces here, just short and sharp confusing engagements. There’s little anguish when things go wrong. The soldiers just pick themselves up and keep on going. The mission, no matter how small and how insignificant in the bigger picture, is everything to them.\n\nSo is it any good? Armed with notepad and pen, we gleefully started jotting down the errors. Very old tanks that definitely aren’t Abrams. MRAPs vehicles that wouldn’t be introduced for another 5 years. A type of leatherman multi-tool that wasn’t invented until 2010! Oh the humanity! But then, very quickly we stopped taking notes. The acting was spot on, and the interaction between characters was perfect. Soldiers behaving like soldiers. If they were all a little uglier, then it would be even more realistic. Very quickly we got drawn into this little film, as it took us right back to our own experiences of war.\n\nHowever, if you believe Rotten Tomatoes, then it would suggest you steer clear (47% at last check). There are complaints that it doesn’t have a message or an underlying theme, or that it’s a genre piece that produces nothing new. These opinions totally miss the point. ‘Sand Castle‘ is a deeply personal account of what it is like to be a pawn in a global war, where the rules and strategies being employed make little sense when you are faced with the realities of an insurgency. Not only that, but it was written by someone who has been there and lived through it. It may not seem ground breaking, but that’s because you’ve seen each of its scenes somewhere else, as a smaller part of a much bigger blockbuster. You’ve seen the tragedy play out on 24hr rolling news. Over the last 15 years, our senses have been dulled and our reactions blunted by a constant drip feed of similar hopeless stories. Some of us have had the misfortune to live through them ourselves.\n\nThis is one of the minority of cases where the critics are dead wrong. Don’t listen to them, listen to the soldiers.\n\nAt this current moment, people are over-saturated and bored with war stories from the Iraq/Afghanistan era. It’s been going on for over a decade and a half and isn’t over yet. No matter how good a film about the period might be, its impact is reduced massively by over familiarity. The best WW2 films were made in the 70’s, nearly 30 years after the conflict had ended, and by that point, the collective memory was beginning to fade.\n\nSo, do one of two things. Either empty your head of all preconceptions, then sit down and really concentrate on this gem of a film, or forget it for 20 years and come back to it when the war in Iraq is (hopefully) a distant memory. Regardless, if you know anyone who has experienced war recently, and you want to know what it was probably like, this is a good place to start.\n\n‘War Machine‘ is out on Netflix on the 26th of May.

Read about how ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ almost never got made here.\n\nAt the start of September, The Venice Film festival premiered Mel Gibson’s first attempt at directing a film since 2006. Hollywood and the world of cinema have been wary about Mel since some drunken outbursts five years ago, and some were sceptical that he would ever work in the film industry again. Not only did ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ get some impressive plaudits from the audience, it got a 10-minute standing ovation…\n\nEmpire Live 2016 was Empire Magazine‘s first film festival. A weekend of previews, workshops and live events hosted at the O2 at the end of September, including Q&As, sing-a-longs and even a ‘Ghostbusters’ “slime-a-long”. With all the excitement surrounding ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ after Venice, it was slotted into the program and announced with only a few days to go. Despite not yet having a UK release date, or even a distributor, a cinema full of lucky people got to see it 6 weeks before it is released in the US and Australia, and probably 6 months before it arrives here. So, is it actually any good? Did it deserve a standing ovation?\n\nThe film opens with a voice-over by Andrew Garfield in the affected Virginia drawl of Private Doss whilst a slow-motion battle rages on. Bodies are flying and people are being killed left right and centre, but through the medium of close-up it is unclear exactly what is happening. The visuals were so confusing and absorbing that it was impossible to focus on precisely what Garfield was saying. Presumably it was some unnecessary sentiment about war being bad, but it could have quite easily been a shopping list for all that it mattered. Garfield’s vocal impersonation of Doss is both oddly high pitched and soft at the same time, and whilst it may not be totally accurate to the real man and the words forgettable, its manner and timbre gives you glimpse of what you need to know about his character.\n\nThe film is broken into two distinct and contrasting parts that could almost be separate stand-alone films with a bit of fleshing out. The first is a set up for the second and charts the life of Doss and his brother growing up, raised by their caring mother and troubled father in rural Virginia. Hugo Weaving is fantastic as Doss Snr. the veteran of the Great War and a shell of a man who is clearly still haunted by the events of 25 years ago. Whilst he is violent and aggressive to his family he is not an ogre to be hated, but someone to be pitied, which is credit not only to the acting, but also the writing which has created a character that could have so easily been one dimensional. We shall have to wait and see if the awards season recognises his performance.\n\nSlowly and deliberately the film reveals Doss’s reasons for choosing the path of pacifism, which are not solely religious as you might expect, but also heavily influenced by a desire not to end up like his abusive father. His caring nature and character are further unveiled by his attempts at the courtship of Dorothy Schutte, played by Theresa Palmer, and his interest in her work as a nurse. In a neat piece of symbolism, we see him using his belt for an entirely different purpose to that of his drunken father in a previous scene, further exploring the divide between their characters. Palmer’s portrayal of Schutte and her relationship with Doss, leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy and could have been channelled directly from the famous actresses of the 1940’s. Her deliberate double takes and mock anger give the whole first act a nostalgic feel to it, as does the sunny weather and perfectly manicured flowerbeds of the hospital and the town. It almost looks like a film set…\n\nBy this point, some people (author included) may be feeling a little underwhelmed and slightly undersold at the saccharine nature and idealism of this so called ‘war-film’. As heartwarming as the blossoming relationship is, it isn’t necessarily what people have come to see and the artistic depiction of war at the start of the film seems like a long time ago. Soon the events of Pearl Harbour start to bring things into sharp focus, and both Doss brothers volunteer for service despite (or maybe in spite of) their father’s wishes. It’s at this point that Desmond’s idealism has to come face to face with the practicalities of war, mainly manifested by another actor in search of redemption, in this case Vince Vaughn channelling a pastiche of ‘Full Metal Jacket‘ and the spirit of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.\n\nOne of Vaughn’s strengths has always been the ability to do deadpan comedy. From ‘Old School‘ to ‘Dodgeball‘ he has been at his best when saying something inherently silly in a deadly serious way. Part of the problem with him attempting serious roles is that he can’t get any more serious. Emotionally he has no where to go to distinguish between funny-serious and serious-serious. If he’s acting serious, it’s the same expression and so you are expecting him to be funny. It is distracting and one of the reasons why ‘True Detective‘ fell so flat in the second series. Sgt. Howell is a part that could have been written for Vaughn, and one that he clearly relishes. It is his welcome menacing comic relief that marks a subtle change in the tone of the film. Suddenly it is shown, that true to his father’s warnings, Doss’s idealism may not be compatible with the rigours of military life. This mid-section of the film really belongs to Vaughn. By getting the funny-serious out the way in the first 5 minutes, it then gives him permission to take the character elsewhere. His anger when he discovers Doss’s intentions and beliefs is genuinely terrifying, but he later lets slip during a chink of compassion that this all may just be an act in itself. For a supporting role with comparably little screen time, Sgt. Howell is one of the most complex characters within the film. Part pantomime villain, part mother figure, part barrack room judge and portrayed absolutely correctly for a military sergeant. His concerns are always for the effectiveness of the squad of men that he has been entrusted with, whilst at the same time showing compassion for the individuals within it.\n\nThere still isn’t much that is new here however. Like the courtship scenes before it, it all seems comfortable and familiar, almost reminiscent of a score of other films. Training montage gives way to a character losing the trust of his peers, only to begrudgingly regain it again. Despite the tension building court-room scenes, we all hope we know where this film is going. At just over the half-way mark, we haven’t seen anything of the battle hinted at in the opening montage. When the events finally transport themselves to the far east, the desire of the more gung-ho members of the rifle company to see some action is mirrored in our own blood-thirsty urges for the film to get to the ‘exciting’ bits.\n\nThe very second that the bullets start to fly and bodies start to fall, all of this is stripped away and replaced with a sense of horror and remorse. Instantly you feel guilty for having wanted to see these men in combat. There is no glory as soldiers are forced to do some abhorrent things in order to survive in the face of a seemingly inhuman enemy. For what seems like an eternity you are totally immersed in the brutality of war. Not since the start of ‘Saving Private Ryan‘ has there been a battle depicted in a way that was so utterly shocking and absorbing at the same time. Whilst that dropped you into the action in a without much warning or set up, ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ has spent over an hour lulling you, and the soldiers on screen, into a false sense of familiarity and security. This means that the nerves are totally unguarded and all prepped for a brutal shredding when the world finally collapses. This is war at its most unflinching and harrowing.\n\nThis transition between the two continents and parts of the film is Mel Gibson’s greatest move. Immediately Doss’s idealism and morals are put to the test. We are all behind him when he goes toe to toe with the might of the U.S. Army for the belief in his values, but once he his faced with the ferocity of the Imperial Japanese Army we are cursing him for being so naive and urging him to pick up a rifle to defend himself. Like a good magic trick, we are suckered into thinking one way, only to have the carpet viciously pulled from under our feet. The ‘niceness’ of the first half it seems was simply to set up the trauma of the second. The meat of the film is in the war scenes, but without the slow and deliberate set-up of the first hour or so, it would not be nearly as effective. The initial attack gives way to counter-attack and the futility of what the G.I.s are trying to achieve becomes horrifically apparent.\n\nAs amazing as the battle scenes are though, they aren’t perfect. The portrayal of the Japanese soldiers is over simplified as the ‘baddies’, despite some attempts towards the end to humanise them. Vince Vaughn’s approach to combat is John Wayne-esque as he trots around the battlefield, barking orders and appearing bulletproof. There are a couple of moments where Mel Gibson has a chance to truly test Desmond’s beliefs, by placing him in a difficult situation where he might have to pick up a rifle to save a fellow soldier, but rather annoyingly he holds back. Biopics are always a tricky beast to manage as people’s lives don’t fit neatly into a 90-minute running time. You have to decide what to keep and what has to go, and sometimes what to embellish and what to tone down. This becomes especially tricky if the subject is still alive or well known. You can’t mess around too much with true events or you might incur disapproval or even legal challenges. Whilst the real Desmond might never have been placed into a position where he might have been tempted to pick up a weapon, it would have raised the dramatic nature of the film if the Garfield’s Doss had been tested more rigorously.\n\nThe script sticks closely to the stories told in the 2004 documentary, with some slight reshuffling of the time-line and compressing of the events in Japan to portray a few months’ worth of events into a few days, but it is the second attack on the ridge that lets the last part of the film down. Gibson decides to return to the slow motion action we saw right at the start, but this time with a patriotic music score in the background and quite clearly showing the USA performing markedly better than their first attempt. The sun is out, the Japanese have lost, the war is won, but it’s done in an almost jingoistic way that makes you roll your eyes. Has no one learned anything in the last hour of battle?! After a final act of heroism (that is borrowed from the story of another soldier) Doss is injured and stretchered off the cliff silhouetted by the fading light. It is here that the religious undertones become obvious overtones and symbolism goes into overdrive.\n\nThe last few moments of the film are clips from the 2004 documentary which bring into sharp focus what Desmond T. Doss achieved, and reminds you that what you have been watching actually happened. The real Doss and some of the soldiers he saved, get their chance, most of them from the grave, to give their account of the incredible events. If nothing has managed to make you misty eyed up until this point then this last portion will have you choking back tears and praying the lights don’t come up too quickly. You are likely to leave the theatre physically and mentally exhausted.\n\n‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ is an excellent film that you must see in a cinema to get the full effect of the incredible battle scenes which are its pinnacle. It deserves most of the praise it has been getting, but it has its flaws. Garfield’s performance is utterly believable throughout, and he is supported by a good cast, but some parts are heavily laboured and over simplified. Some of Doss’s most impressive feats are not featured as they don’t fit into the film, but for those in doubt of his bravery and humility, read up what happened in the hours immediately following his injury. Gibson may be back on form, but he would have done well to ease up on the religious symbolism.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nA story of redemption, but for whom? A potential comeback for Mel Gibson or a decent war film marred by an overtly religious message? Read the ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ review here.\n\nHollywood has fallen out of love with Mel Gibson in a serious way over the last five years, and it isn’t hard to see why. An ultra-conservative catholic who in the past has been accused of being racist, homophobic and antisemitic, and had been arrested for drink driving and suspected of domestic abuse? Even with some serious PR spin, that would be a difficult one to market. He hasn’t directed anything since ‘Apocalypto‘ which was released over a decade ago, and his last notable performance was 2011’s ‘The Beaver’ which was a commercial flop.\n\nThe failure of the ‘The Beaver‘ to garner any traction at the box officer was almost certainly down to what was happening to Gibson in public, which is a shame as it is one of his best roles. Gibson gave an air of startling authenticity to proceedings as a man on the verge of a mental breakdown, losing his family and dealing with a whole host of inner demons. Whilst there are some places where the film falls flat, it is a reminder of what Mel Gibson the actor can do given the right conditions. However it seems that all is not lost as Mel Gibson is back in the director’s chair this year, and if there is one thing that Hollywood loves almost as much as an underdog story, it would be a tale of comeback and redemption (for those of you don’t remember, reacquaint yourselves with what Robert Downey Jr. was up to in the late 90’s). ‘The Beaver‘ might well have been the start of that comeback, but it came too hot on the heels of the latest batch of allegations to do him any good.\n\nBut five years have now passed and whilst no one is immediately forgiving him, Mel Gibson is getting a second chance and boy did he pick one hell of a comeback project. ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ is based on the unbelievable yet true story of Desmond Doss, a pacifist who voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942 in order to serve his country in the Pacific, but purely as a medic and not to fight. Whilst he believed the war was just, as a Seventh-day Adventist he refused to take an enemy life or pick up a rifle even in self defence. He not only survived the war, but he ended up winning the congressional Medal of Honor for a series of heroic acts that are simply too numerous to list. Some people get medals for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or by their own admission by being reckless or simply unaware of the danger they were in. Whatever you take away from this or the film, be under no illusion that Doss exhibited true heroism and bravery. He deliberately and knowingly put himself in harms way countless times in order to serve and protect the men around him. He chose to sign up, chose to be a front-line medic and chose not to arm himself. Not only that, but he fought for the right to be allowed to do it.\n\nDoss’s story had been stuck in ‘development hell’ for a considerable length of time, and the rights to his story had been sold and resold to numerous studios, but a documentary of his life was finally made in 2004. Shortly after it was completed, Doss passed away at the age of 87. He received a full military burial, somewhat ironically given his refusal to carry a weapon, with a 21-gun salute. Some of the footage from that documentary poignantly makes up the final moments of ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ in a way that is reminiscent of ‘Band of Brothers‘. Over the next decade the options for a film kept resurfacing, but restrictions on the rating meant that only a PG-13 version was being considered. Fast forward to the end of 2014 and it was announced that a film was finally entering production, with Mel Gibson back in the directing chair and Andrew Garfield playing Doss. Not everyone was convinced with either Gibson or Garfield however. At this point Garfield was best known for playing Mark Zuckerberg’s business partner, Eduardo Saverin, in ‘The Social Network‘ and as Tobey Maguire’s successor in the ‘Spiderman‘ franchise. He was far from the kind of A-list name that is usually required to spark serious interest in a film. The film was eventually financed by IM Global, a relative newcomer to the market who are known for taking risks that other more established names wouldn’t look at. Initially only North American distribution rights were secured. Clearly the rest of the world wasn’t enamoured with the idea of a U.S. focused WW2 film with religious overtones, directed by a controversial and out of practice actor, and starring an unknown quantity.\n\nThe filming started at the end of September 2015 and took place entirely in Australia with a modest budget of $45 million. Antipodean actors such as Hugo Weaving and Sam Worthington filled in some of the key supporting cast, and although still reeling from a problematic and heavily criticised attempt at a dramatic turn in the second series of ‘True Detective‘, Vince Vaughn landed the role of Sergeant Howell. As a result ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ flew under the radar of many, and wasn’t taken seriously by most until the first trailer hit the internet. Suddenly the world was starting to take notice. The Venice Film Festival premiered the film at the start of September and it was well received. Seriously well received. It got a 10-minute standing ovation. The ‘O’ word had begun to be mentioned in hushed tones. The buzz had begun.\n\nEmpire Live 2016 was Empire Magazine‘s first film festival. A weekend of previews, workshops and live events hosted at the O2 at the end of September, including Q&As, sing-a-longs and even a ‘Ghostbusters’ “slime-a-long”. With all the excitement surrounding ‘Hacksaw Ridge‘, it was put into the program and announced with only a few days to go. Despite not yet having a UK release date, or even a distributor, a cinema full of lucky people got to see it 6 weeks before it is released in the US and Australia, and probably 6 months before it arrives here.\n\nSo, is it actually any good? As odd as it sounds, standing ovations at film festivals like Venice are quite common. It doesn’t necessarily mean they are worth your hard earned money or even awards. Does ‘Hacksaw Ridge ‘ live up to the growing hype? Follow the link below to our review…\n\n‘Hacksaw Ridge‘ – The Bare Arms Review\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n‘Eye in the Sky‘ has the honour of being Alan Rickman‘s final swansong. Filmed before his death, and released shortly after, it serves as a fitting bookend to an incredible career. Although as Lt. General Benson, he plays second fiddle to Helen Mirren’s Colonel Powell throughout the film, he gets the last word in this taught 90-minute thriller. A snivelling civil servant calls him “…disgraceful”, to which he very calmly and decisively cuts her down to size in his trademark purr, finishing with a line so good, that I was convinced it was a quotation;\n\n“Never tell a soldier, that he does not know the cost of war”.\n\nThis week we were supposed to release our critique of the new series of ‘Our Girl’ for which we helped the BBC shape the script, but we ended up getting so frustrated at the inaccuracy of some parts of it that we felt we needed to have a stiff drink and a lie down. Instead of immediately venting via the medium of this blog, we decided to give it another episode to even out and find an even keel. Coincidentally we managed to get our hands on a copy of ‘Eye in the Sky‘ this week which we have been wanting to watch since its limited release at the start of the year, and we had promised a review of.\n\nLuckily for our blood pressure issues, ‘Eye in the Sky’ blows ‘Our Girl‘ straight out the water when it comes to military accuracy, with the minor exception of Helen Mirren’s beret (head over to Bad Berets: ‘You could land a helicopter on that!’ for an explanation) and fortunately it only makes an appearance in the last 60 seconds. As we commemorate the 15th anniversary of the world altering events of 9/11, ‘Eye in the Sky‘ highlights just how far warfare has changed in the years since. The subject of this film is the evolving capability to perform surgical strikes on specific targets, after many hours of surveillance, often without putting a foot on the ground. Does this increased distance from our target desensitise us from the reality of what we are doing, or does it immunise us and allow us to make difficult decisions without being overly clouded by emotion?\n\nAt its heart this film is about conflict, but not the obvious kind that you would immediately assume. Instead it is about the disconnect between military action, political will, moral responsibility and legality. There are no good guys and bad guys (except the obvious terrorists of course, which are more plot devices than actual characters), but rather a smorgasbord of politicians and military personnel with their own views and beliefs. The events in the film span a 12-hr period and one capture operation in Nairobi, Kenya, but the protagonists are split between a handful of military bases and government meeting rooms across the globe. Each one serves as a different slant on the same picture in the increasingly complex and developing situation. Quickly, as with many operations, the scenario changes to a point where capture is made almost impossible without the loss of many lives. Suddenly the mission changes up a few gears into a kill mission, much to the horror of the watching politicians who don’t have the stomach for it.\n\nIn most films, having such a large number of characters and locations would make it difficult to follow, but ‘Eye in the Sky‘ makes it work exceptionally well, flicking between them at crucial moments. It not only helps explain difficulties in the passage of information, even in an age where we can stream video around the globe, but also accurately portrays the nature of the lengthy verification and authorisation process that these strikes must go through. Not everyone has the complete picture or understanding of the event, and inevitably those with the leanest information are those with the authority to make the decisions. No set of guidelines or rules of engagement can possibly be specific enough to cover every eventuality, and at some point, someone has to make a crucial decision which may or may not result in the death of innocent parties. The kind of debates that occur within the COBRA boardroom in this film, frequently happen in operations rooms around the globe.\n\n“Are we legally allowed to strike?”\n\n“Yes…”\n\n“Does that mean we should?”\n\n“No…”\n\n‘Eye in the Sky’ cleverly ramps up the necessity and urgency to conduct a drone strike in far from ideal conditions, but in such a way that the right answer is never immediately obvious (if there is one at all) and in constant flux. Various characters change sides in the debate, especially once the responsibility of decision making is taken off them. I suspect anyone watching it with military experience will immediately identify with the British Army and US Air Force personnel and become frustrated at the politicians who pontificate, delay and pass the buck, but the real heart of the film is with the drone operators. Caught in the middle is Aaron Paul as the young officer, who by the luck of a rota is tasked with commanding the drone and responsible for launching the weapon. If there was any argument to suggest that drone operators treat their role like a video game, his torment and reticence to pull the trigger dispels it immediately. You suspect that whatever the outcome, and despite his relatively junior position in proceedings, it will be him that carries the majority of the burden.\n\nIf Aaron Paul is the heart, then Helen Mirren represents the brain in this moralistic struggle. There are no clear sides in this debate, but from the very outset she’s after a result that has eluded her for years, and for her the end always justifies the means. Her tenacity and urgency is the antithesis of politicians. We feel her intense stress as time is frittered away by those above her, causing emotional outbursts and in one scene forcing her to fiddle with a set of worry beads. I have seen a number of senior commanders unintentionally doing similar things, including one who would wind his forelock around his index finger when making tough decisions. She is portrayed as cold and calculating, but as the film winds down you sense that she isn’t totally devoid of emotion and her demeanour is one of necessity in a male dominated world.\n\nThe film leaves you without any neat answers, or forced judgements, which in this day and age is rare. It leaves you to make up your own mind about the morality of what you’ve just witnessed. Whether you are in the military or not, this is a must see film that has garnered little of the attention it deserves. I would suggest it should be compulsory viewing at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and other officer training establishments. No where else is the complex morality of war better played out so effectively than in this film.\n\nKudos goes to everyone involved in making it, especially for not pulling any punches and for avoiding the typical Hollywood ending. You’ll come away from it feeling emotionally drained and mentally fatigued. This isn’t an action film, more of a philosophical debate about the ethics of warfare, but one that will keep you thinking long into the night. Personally I side with the General….\n\n‘Eye in the Sky’ is available to stream on the iStore, Amazon and Google Play.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWARNING – Contains spoilers for those who haven’t seen the show and/or read the book.\n\nLast week the dust settled on the final episode of BBC1’s ‘The Night Manager’, a high budget adaptation of the John le Carré book of the same name. We reviewed the first two episodes with high praise, but did the rest of the run live up to the high standard?\n\nThe End?\n\nWhilst most of the adaptation was faithful to the book, the most significant difference was the ending. The BBC finale was overly saccharine compared to the book and everything was neatly solved within the running time. In the book, Pine’s identity is revealed by the traitorous members of MI6 who are profiting from Roper’s schemes, putting him and Jed in mortal danger. Pine goes through a round of brutal torture as a result. Burr bluffs that he (she in the TV series) has enough evidence to convict Roper and his associates, thus forcing them into making a deal to release Jed and Pine in return for silence. The book ends with Roper completing his deal and getting away with it, whilst Burr ends up with his reputation ruined, but Pine’s life saved.\n\nThere is no doubt that this would have made a better ending, but it would also have made a much better jumping off point for the inevitable second series which the BBC are already planning. I cannot for the life of me understand why the BBC chose to end with Roper in the custody of his vengeful partners and with more than enough evidence to convict him.\n\nHiddleston for Bond!\n\nWe sang Tom Hiddleston’s praises in our first review. In the first two episodes he displayed everything required for Bond; a passion for the ladies, psychopathic tendencies, an ability to take a beating… but then they pushed it too far in the final episode by having him order a vodka Martini. Even Hugh Laurie looks disgusted!\n\nApart from these obvious nods to the man in the dinner jacket (which began to grate) Pine’s motivations started not to make much sense as the series progressed. It’s much more difficult to empathise with a character if you can’t understand their reasoning. Pine’s journey to sociopathic spy is halted by his attraction to Jed…or probably should have been. His reason for helping Burr get to Roper is revenge for the death of Sophie. If he was so besotted by Jed to the point where he is taking foolish risks to see her, then why does he kill Freddie Hamid who was only an observer to her murder? If his priority is Roper, then why risk it all for Jed?\n\nSince the finale, there has a been an upsurge in support behind a suprise nomination for the next Bond, and it isn’t Tom Hiddleston. His moment in the spotlight has been overshadowed by none other than Olivia Colman! An article from the Independent tracked the growing media campaign to make her the successor to Daniel Craig, to the point where even the unimaginative Daily Mail jumped on the bandwagon with this obvious April Fools story. Part of me can’t help agreeing. Olivia Colman is well on the way to becoming a national treasure as she is an incredible actor. Whatever my views are, the odds are firmly in Hiddleston’s favour with him currently the front runner at 2/1, with Tom Hardy and Idris Elba following behind.\n\nWhat Happened To Frisky?\n\nFrisky was Roper’s unintelligible bodyguard, played by the gruff Scottish actor Michael Nardone. He played the role of ex-soldier-turned-mercenary brilliantly well, to the point where I had to look him up as I was convinced he really was a former military man, moonlighting as an actor! All of Corky’s flamboyance and vice made him unpredictable and dangerous to both sides, whereas Frisky was dependable, loyal and violent. It is him that administers the vicious beating to Jed, but then he gets shot in the knee by Burr. Where does he go at the end?! I hope he’s ok…\n\nWhy did Roper trust Pine?\n\nThis is the weakest plot point in the entirety of the series. If I were Roper, I would wonder why everything was going well until I brought a complete stranger into my organisation. Even if you concede that he suspects Pine fairly quickly (hence the great switcheroo at the Syrian border) why leave Pine with control over the bank account with your money in? Why not instantly transfer it somewhere else? Likewise if he suspected Jed, why allow her access to the safe that contains the only documents that link you to the highly illegal arms deal. Not only that, but in THE VERY SAME HOTEL where he had documents lifted the last time he was there! For a criminal mastermind, his approach to security is remarkably slapdash. No wonder Corky took to the drink….\n\nOdd Casting Choices\n\nActors can do all sorts of accents with varying degrees of success, but usually the most convincing accent is their own. David Harewood is a brilliant British actor, but I think his american accent is a bit suspect. He does the exact same accent in ‘Homeland‘ where he plays a pretty similar character. I shouldn’t judge, as my american accent is dreadful…but then again I am not an actor. Were there no american actors available? London is usually full of them. Whenever he was on screen it was a bit jarring, as I was concentrating on how he was saying things, not what he was saying. However upsetting he was, he wasn’t nearly as distracting as Tony…I mean Neil Morrisey.\n\nFor those of you too young to remember, Morrisey (no not that one) is most famous for his role as Tony from ‘Men Behaving Badly‘. I haven’t seen him in anything in about 15 years and so seeing him pop up here totally derailed my train of thought. All I could think about was how bad was the state of British intelligence, that they employed a man who turned his garden shed into a sauna. It didn’t help that his character Harry Palfrey is a bit of a confused dogsbody who is in way over his head.\n\nJonathan Aris plays the weird, creepy, weasely guy in anything he’s in. You’ll know him better as the weird and creepy Anderson in Sherlock, who’s also a bit weasely. He usually stands to one side of a major character, being a bit weird, occasionally beardy. He does the same in this. Doesn’t really add a great deal except to convince you that the major character is clearly not to be trusted if he’s hanging around with Tony and Weasely.\n\nWho was driving the trucks?!\n\nHow did all the people driving the trucks know to get out? Were they working for Pine? If so, why weren’t any basic background checks done? Was there some sort of warning? It doesn’t make sense…unless the BBC didn’t want Pine killing innocent civilians. That would be unfortunate and awkward given what he was trying to prevent. Did someone write themselves into a bit of a plot hole without a way out of it? Possibly. Did they think we wouldn’t ask questions? Probably. Does it matter? Absolutely. I like my films and television seeped in logic. I like my spy thrillers triple cooked in the stuff. This kind of stuff annoys me. Wasn’t there any other way Pine could have hijacked the deal without involving massive amounts of carnage and criminal damage?\n\nIn Summary\n\nI can’t help but feel a little let down by the latter half of ‘The Night Manager’. The further away it got from the original book, the more plot holes appeared and the less impressed I became. This is a huge shame as the first two episodes were full of promise that the later episodes failed to capitalise on, and the middle two episodes were mostly filler without a great deal of plot or character development. The complex relationship between Roper and Pine that I thought might be developing, didn’t materialise into anything significant and the ‘baddies’ occupying the top echelons of the British Secret Service were one dimensional and clunky. The duo of Mayhew and Burr had depth and substance to it with a real nuanced exploration of practicality versus ideology, but with Mayhew missing for the finale, the episode was the worse for it.\n\nThe relationship between Jed and Pine wasn’t particularly believable, and her character was possibly the weakest in the entire show; over-emotional, foolish and generally getting in the way. Compare that to the character of Burr however…\n\nI have already waxed lyrical about Olivia Colman, so I won’t again, but a special shout goes out to Adeel Akhtar, who is brilliant in anything he’s in. As Rob Singhal, Burr’s right hand man and assistant, he’s managed to turn a small role into something quite meaty. His reaction to Pine’s foolish handling of the problems with Jed, and the showdown in the hotel is a great scene between his veteran analyst and Hiddleston’s newcomer. He reflected my own incredulity at Pine’s choices perfectly.\n\nFinally I have to return to the ending. It was far too neat and tidy and it lacked the bite of the original. I really wanted to see Burr have to make the choice between catching Roper and leaving Pine to die. I hope the BBC don’t make a second series, because they have shown that once they stray from the original text, they start to lose their way. There is no sequel written to the book, so anything from here on wouldn’t be Le Carré and much worse for it.\n\nWhat do you think? Did ‘The Night Manager’ lose its way?
