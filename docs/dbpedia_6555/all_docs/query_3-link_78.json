        "text": "All around us, elegantly dressed Berliners converged on the state opera house in the early evening light. “I think what I struggle with is finding more in it than the beauty,” I said. “Or learning to be satisfied with that.”\n\n“The music has to get in you and do its thing,” she said.\n\nWe were at the opera house steps now, and she asked if I wanted to check my wool sport coat. I gestured at the Staatsoper’s grand columns. “I have to make an effort,” I said.\n\n“Will you be too hot?” she asked, then grinned slyly. “Don’t I sound like a nagging wife? I haven’t been a wife for 23 years.”\n\n“Still got it,” I said.\n\n“Still got it.”\n\nLorrie Moore is good with men. “Very, very good with them,” Lauren Groff, a novelist and former student of Moore’s who is a three-time National Book Award finalist, told me. “One time, I looked across and she had the most handsome man in the room in the palm of her hand, and she raised her eyebrow to me, like, ‘Hubba hubba.’” In my time with her in Berlin, where she was researching family history, Moore filled every silence in our conversations with polite questions about my family, my writing, my experience with the opera. This habit seems like an example of her social graces — she is unfailingly well mannered — but it is also a clever trick that defuses the interviewer’s tactic of letting silences linger, to encourage the subject to fill them with revelations. It’s a tactic that works especially well on men, of course, already so eager to talk about themselves to nice women.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
