        "text": "Thomas is stationed in Gibraltar during WW II and is assigned to watch over the famous Barbary apes. According to legend, as long as the apes are on the rock, Gibraltar will stay under English rule. The only male ape dies, and everyone fears that the rest of the apes will die and that the Germans will use their deaths for propaganda. Thomas and Jeffries go to Zurich and steal an ape from a German circus. This saves the ape colony, Thomas is promoted, and he and Jeffries are transferred to watch over the ravens in the Tower of London."
