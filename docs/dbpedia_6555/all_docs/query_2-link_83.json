        "text": "From the Nick Jonas-led 'The Blacksmith' to ballet drama 'Joika,' here are the 25 Cannes films set to heat up the market.\n\nTwo weeks before July 10, when Unhinged, Solstice Studios' road-rage thriller starring Russell Crowe, becomes the first new film to hit U.S. theaters since the coronavirus shutdown, independent producers, distributors, sales agents and financiers from around the world will come together — online — to try to reboot the global film industry. The first virtual Cannes film market — the official online Marché (June 22-26) and the parallel market run by U.S. talent agencies and major sales companies (June 22-28) — will be a test of whether, after months of lockdown, closed theaters and disrupted production, the indie film show can still go on. Ahead of the market, execs sound surprisingly positive.\n\n\"Of course no one knows what will happen, but the mood has shifted,\" says Jonathan Kier, president of international sales and distribution at Sierra/Affinity. \"Theaters are starting to open up in some countries, and the response of audiences is positive. Production is starting up again. Distributors are hungry, they are looking to build their slates. Everyone is ready to get things going.\"\n\nDeborah McIntosh of Endeavor Content says there has been incredible cooperation between the talent agencies in the push to get projects over the line. \"We've been much more transparent about sharing information,\" she says. \"The feeling is, any win is a win for everyone. It's a win for the industry.\"\n\nFilms debuting at the Virtual Cannes Market range from action to horror, period drama to sci-fi. What unites THR's 2020 Cannes Hot List, below, is the hope behind every film that it can help restart the international film business.\n\n'Another Round'\n\nDIRECTOR Thomas Vinterberg\n\nSTAR Mads Mikkelsen\n\nSTATUS Completed\n\nSALES TrustNordisk\n\nBUZZ Art house fave Vinterberg (The Commune) promises an intellectual romp with this drama about four friends who test a theory that they will improve their lives by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood.\n\n'Armageddon Time'\n\nDIRECTOR James Gray\n\nSTARS Robert De Niro, Oscar Isaac, Donald Sutherland, Anne Hathaway, Cate Blanchett\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES Wild Bunch International (international), CAA Media Finance (domestic), Wild Bunch/CAA Media Finance (China)\n\nBUZZ Ad Astra director Gray has lined up another all-star cast for his next production, a semi-autobiographical drama based on Gray's 1980s upbringing in the New York borough of Queens, where the director attended a private school that counts Donald Trump among its alumni.\n\n'Arthur the King'\n\nDIRECTOR Baltasar Kormakur\n\nSTAR Mark Wahlberg\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES Sierra/Affinity\n\nBUZZ The man-with-dog true-life adventure tale (based on the 2017 book), reteams Wahlberg with his Contraband and 2 Guns director Baltasar Kormakur in a story about the captain of a Swedish adventure racing team (Wahlberg) who befriends a wounded stray dog during a 400-mile race through the Ecuadoran jungle. Lionsgate has picked up domestic on the title, which should reassure international buyers that the movie will get a proper U.S. release.\n\n'Balestra'\n\nDIRECTOR Nicole Dorsey\n\nSTARS Tessa Thompson, Marwan Kenzari\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES Mister Smith Entertainment (international), Endeavor Content, CAA Media Finance (domestic)\n\nBUZZ Creed and Thor: Ragnarok star Thompson plays a competitive fencer who begins a tumultuous affair with her instructor (Aladdin actor Kenzari) in this psychological thriller that could appeal to buyers looking for a Black Swan-style cross-over title.\n\n'The Blacksmith'\n\nDIRECTOR Pierre Morel\n\nSTARS Nick Jonas, Laurence Fishburne\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES AGC Studios\n\nBUZZ Action is king on the international indie market, and this package, which has Jonas starring as a go-to weapons expert for the intelligence community, could tap into the John Wick audience for high-concept thrillers.\n\n'Emancipation'\n\nDIRECTOR Antoine Fuqua\n\nSTAR Will Smith\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES FilmNation Entertainment (international), CAA Media Finance (U.S.)\n\nBUZZ Arguably the hottest title at this year's market, this runaway slave thriller from The Equalizer director Fuqua is billed as an Apocalypto-style man-against-nature actioner with a true-life element (it is based on the infamous 'scourged back' image taken of an escaped slave in 1863). The combination of Smith and Fuqua, together with the film's extreme topicality should make this a no-brainer for international buyers, if a studio or streamer doesn't snatch it up first.\n\n'Enfant Terrible'\n\nDIRECTOR Oskar Roehler\n\nSALES Picture Tree International\n\nSTATUS Completed\n\nBUZZ This biopic of legendary German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder is from Roehler (Agnes and His Brothers), the man dubbed the \"new Fassbinder.\" Art house distributors will snatch this up.\n\n'Falling'\n\nDIRECTOR-STAR Viggo Mortensen\n\nSALES HanWay Films (international), UTA (North America)\n\nBUZZ Mortensen's directorial debut, in which he stars as a man dealing with his dementia-afflicted father, premiered at Sundance, but its most appreciative audience could come from the international art house crowd.\n\n'Fantastic Flitcrofts'\n\nDIRECTOR Craig Roberts\n\nSTAR Mark Rylance\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES Cornerstone Films\n\nBUZZ Feel-good escapism is exactly what the post-pandemic market wants, setting up this golfing-themed comedy for strong sales at the Virtual Cannes Market. Rylance will play Maurice Flitcroft, an amateur putter and unrelenting optimist who qualified for the 1976 British Open Golf Championship and went on to shoot the worst round in Open history, becoming a folk hero in the process. Roberts will direct from an adapted screenplay by Paddington 2 screenwriter Simon Farnaby.\n\n'Ferrari'\n\nDIRECTOR Michael Mann\n\nSTAR Hugh Jackman\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES STX (international), CAA Media Finance (U.S.)\n\nBUZZ Michael Mann's hotly anticipated biopic, staring Jackman as Italian racing icon Enzo Ferrari, is well-timed, coming up fast behind 20th Century Fox's well-received Ford v Ferrari and looking to appeal to a similar audience. Based on Brock Yates’ book Enzo Ferrari – The Man and the Machine, the drama is set over a key summer in 1957 when Ferrari bets his future, and that of his young family, on a single treacherous race, the infamous 1957 Mille Miglia.\n\n'Heaven: To the Land of Happiness'\n\nDIRECTOR Im Sang-soo\n\nSALES Finecut Co.\n\nBUZZ Buyers still kicking themselves for not snatching up Parasite will be checking out this Cannes title from Korean genre favorite Im Sang-soo (The Housemaid). Like Bong Joon Ho's hit, Heaven hides a social message in the story of a dying man who steals the medicine he needs to stay alive.\n\n'Here We Are'\n\nDIRECTOR Nir Bergman\n\nSALES MK2 Films\n\nSTATUS Completed\n\nBUZZ This Israeli family drama, about a mentally challenged man in his early 20s and his single father, should be just the ticket for specialty buyers who know Bergman from his 2002 sleeper, Broken Wings.\n\n'Joika'\n\nDIRECTOR James Napier Robertson\n\nSTAR Thomasin McKenzie\n\nSALES Embankment Films (worldwide), UTA Independent Film Group (co-rep U.S.)\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nBUZZ McKenzie, the fast-rising star of Jojo Rabbit, will topline in this biopic as American ballet dancer Joy Womack, the second American to graduate from Moscow's infamously tough Bolshoi Ballet Academy.\n\n'No Man of God'\n\nDIRECTOR Amber Sealey\n\nSTAR Elijah Wood\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES XYZ Films\n\nBUZZ Wood plays Ted Bundy’s FBI analyst in this crime-thriller from genre specialists XYZ, which has the advantage of being an enclosed drama (the film is largely set in a single interrogation room), meaning it will be easier to make in the post-COVID-19 world.\n\n'Not Without Hope'\n\nDIRECTOR Rupert Wainwright\n\nSTAR Miles Teller\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES Highland Film Group (international), CAA Media Finance (domestic)\n\nBUZZ Whiplash breakout and upcoming Top Gun: Maverick star Teller is heading out to sea as the sole survivor of a real-life tragedy in this adaptation of Nick Schuyler and Jere Longman’s novel. In 2009, Schuyler and three friends (including two NFL players) departed Florida for a fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico, only to be struck by a severe storm that saw their boat capsize. Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russell Wilson and Grammy-winning singer Ciara are exec producing through their Why Not You banner.\n\n'Replay'\n\nDIRECTOR Jimmy Loweree\n\nSTAR Olivia Munn\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nSALES The Exchange (International), CAA Media Finance (U.S.)\n\nBUZZ In the post-COVID-19 world, escapist fiction is the order of the day, and this sci-fi thriller, which stars Munn as a woman willing to break every rule to change the past and save her dead husband, fits the bill perfectly.\n\n'Run Rabbit Run'\n\nDIRECTOR Daina Reid\n\nSTARS Elisabeth Moss\n\nSALES XYZ Films\n\nSTATUS Preproduction\n\nBUZZ The Invisible Man helped give art house favorite Moss box office cred, and this ghost thriller could land right in the indie distributor sweet spot between quality and genre fare. Moss plays a fertility doctor dealing with the strange behavior of her young daughter.\n\n'Silk Road'\n\nDIRECTOR Tiller Russell\n\nSTARS Nick Robinson, Jason Clarke\n\nSTATUS Completed\n\nSALES Sierra/Affinity (International), Endeavor (North America)\n\nBUZZ: Based on the founder of the notorious, eponymous darkweb site, Silk Road was set to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival before COVID-19.
