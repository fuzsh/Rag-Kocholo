        "text": "Category: Movies\n\nDefining The Word Nerd/Geek: Industry Regulars Give Their Thoughts (Part 2)\n\nLast time we asked comic book writers/artists, YouTubers, and other entertainment personalities what their thoughts on the words nerd/geek are. We were flooded with responses and had to split them up into parts. We shared the first batch here (Part 1), here’s part 2.\n\nMichael and Laura Allred: Writer/Artist power couple team at AAA Pop, DC, Marvel, Dark Horse, Slave Labor Graphics, Tundra, Caliber, Epic, Oni Press and Image\n\nBest Known For: Madman and X-Statix\n\n1) What started you off in your field?\n\nI drew comics my whole life. Always for fun. Just got lucky and eventually found I could make a living at it. Living the dream!\n\n2) What do you think defines a nerd/geek?\n\nWe regard it affectionately. Someone who is extraordinarily enthusiastic about pop culture while celebrating uniqueness.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nYup!\n\nYou can follow the Allreds on Twitter (@AllredMD), Instagram (@allredmd),Facebook, and their website (www.aaapop.com)!\n\nPick up Art Ops from DC/Vertigo today! The story is great but the art alone is worth the price of admission! Purchase it online at:www.readdcentertainment.com\n\nChad Hardin: Artist at DC, BOOM, and Dark Horse\n\nBest Known For: Harley Quinn\n\n1) What started you off in your field?\n\nJust a love of Comics that started when I was twelve and never really stopped; also a love of drawing that started when I was four and never stopped.\n\n2) What do you think defines a nerd/geek?\n\nA Nerd is someone who is shunned because he is hyper intelligent. A Geek is someone who is shunned for their obsession with pop culture. Occasionally these things can co-exist like a love for Science Fiction, but Geeks can be stupid, Nerds can’t.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nI was in school and now I guess you could say I’m a comic nerd because I have specialized in comic art. But my studies in physics, astronomy, and math have fallen way off since I graduated from college. I can’t even help my daughter with her middle school math. So I’ve lost a lot of my nerdiness, but I am still a huge geek.\n\nYou can follow Chad on Facebook, Twitter (@ChadHardin), Instagram (@hardin_art), and his website (chadhardinart.com)!\n\nTo see Chad’s amazing take on Harley Quinn click the following link to purchase the comic online: www.readdcentertainment.com\n\nDan Fraga: Writer/Artist/Storyboard Artist/Director at Image, Marvel, Top Cow, and Aspen\n\nBest Known For: The Hard Times of R.J. Berger\n\n1) What started you off in your field?\n\nI love storytelling in all forms. Animation and comics got me hooked. Unlimited possibilities live in those amazing formats.\n\n2) What do you think defines a nerd/geek?\n\nLoving what you love and not giving a shit about people who judge you for your interests.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nYes. Yes I am.\n\nYou can follow Dan on Instagram (@couchdoodles) and on Tumblr!\n\nTo read Dan’s amazing daily webcomic The Grave, click on the Tumblr link above!\n\nRags Morales: Artist at Valiant, Marvel, and DC\n\nBest Known For: Hawkman and Identity Crisis\n\n1) What started you off in your field?\n\nBeen a fan of comics since I was 5. Mostly for the art although I did enjoy many of the stories, as well as the syndicated tv shows and movies. After consistently showing an aptitude for drawing, and being encouraged by art teachers and my folks, I haven’t stopped drawing. I had an old friend who has known me and my family from when I was 5, and she told me I was the only friend of hers who became exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up.\n\n2) What do you think defines a nerd/geek?\n\nPassion for something. No shame in passion.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nI’m nerdy for comics, art, sports, history and politics; so yeah, I’m a big ol’ nerd and have raised nerdy kids. It’s chic to be geek.\n\nYou can follow Rags on his Facebook, Twitter (@RagsMorales), Instagram (@ragsagainstthemachine), ragsagainstthemachine.net, ragsmorales.etsy.com, and at Comicartfans.com.\n\nFor information and bookings contact Jess at info@ragsagainstthemachine.net.

All I know is it’s a lot easier to be into sci-fi, fantasy, and comics now than it was when I was a kid.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nI guess? I certainly have liked nerdy stuff my whole life, but on the other hand, I’ve always had girlfriends and stuff…I dunno…I’ll let other people decide.\n\nYou can follow Tim on Twitter (@HackinTimSeeley) and his Blog!\n\nBe sure to pick up Tim’s fantastic Revival series online at ComiXology!\n\nDuncan Rouleau: Writer/Artist/TV Show Creator/Producer at Marvel, DC, Image, Dark Horse, Active Comics, New Line Cinema, and Paramount\n\nBest Known For: Big Hero 6 and Ben 10\n\n1) What started you off in your field?\n\nEscape from reality.\n\n2) What do you think defines a nerd/geek?\n\nSomeone with a burning passion to know something more than others.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nGot my nerd card circa 1973!\n\nYou can follow Duncan on Twitter (@rouleau1) and his website Man of Action!\n\nBe sure to pick up Duncan’s The Nightmarist which was optioned by Paramount Pictures! Available on Amazon!\n\nDavid Hine: Writer/Artist at Fleetway, Atomeka, Image, DC, Marvel, Radical, and AfterShock\n\nBest Known For: Silent War, Spawn, and The Bulletproof Coffin\n\n1) What started you off in your field?\n\nJust loving to read as a form of escape from the boredom of growing up in a small village in 1960s UK. My mind was blown by the first episode of Dr Who on the BBC and by the weekly comics my grandparents gave me, like The Eagle and The Ranger, which had science-fiction and fantasy strips. I got into science-fiction novels, particularly Ray Bradbury and Brian Aldiss. By the age of 7 I knew I wanted to be a writer. By the time I was 10 I knew I wanted to work in comics.\n\n2) What do you think defines a nerd/geek?\n\nI have to be careful here. My son gives me a lot of crap when I confuse nerds with geeks. Nerds are totally academic and pedantic and straight (apparently), while geeks collect cool shit and know everything about their chosen subject – like everything. They can also be pedantic. Both geeks and nerds are easily offended, so I’m probably in trouble here.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nI have a blog and Facebook page and I tweet and occasionally post on tumblr. I love comics and movies. I collect lots of cool shit. And I mean a lot! My house is full of comics, books, magazines, DVDs, vinyl records, though I don’t really do the toys/action figures. I am probably more geek than nerd but I do wear glasses and read a lot.\n\nYou can follow David on Facebook, Twitter (@HineDavid), and his website (waitingfortrade.com).

You will not be disappointed!\n\nMike Vasquez: Indie/Artist\n\nBest Known For: Adventure Time stylized versions of popular characters\n\n1) What started you off in your field?\n\nI started doing my art full time after I had my first born. I realized that there weren’t made fun star wars designs for baby clothes. I started a Kickstarter called Lil’ Geeks that received such a huge response in such a short amount of time that it was shut down by a larger company for infringing on their IP. So I took that as a challenge and worked hard to find ways to make and produce art in the right channels and now I do it full time today and have worked for companies like LFL, Upper deck, Boom!, Topps, Cryptozoic and much more!\n\n2) What do you think defines a nerd/geek?\n\nHonestly..I think a geek can be anyone who is passionate about something they love. There’s all kinds of geeks, anywhere from comics, movies, art, music and even sports. A fan who wears a hockey jersey, attends or watches every game and memorizes the stats for every player is not different than a fan of a comic character who wears the characters logo shirt, collects and keeps up with the comics that character is written in and knows all the details of that character. Both love what they love.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nI definitely consider myself one! I love tons of things and am openly passionate about my love for Kaiju and Godzilla!\n\nYou can find Mike Vasquez on Instagram (@mikegoesgeek) and his website (www.mikegoesgeek.com), and he’s also working on a Top Secret project right now so stay tuned!\n\nMichael Hanaoka: Artist at Hooligan Comics\n\nBest Known For: @$!% Superheroes and Tales of Terror\n\n1) What started you off in your field?\n\nWhat started it all for me was watching Godzilla movies and a show called a Kikaider when I was growing up. I loved the genre so much that I would sit there and draw pictures of every monster and hero. I then discovered comic books at around the age of 7 and fell in love instantly. It was this love for comics that inspired me to become an illustrator.\n\n2) What do you think defines a nerd/geek?\n\nI believe a nerd/geek is defined by their passion for the things they love. They are no different than individuals who live and breathe sports. Both are very passionate about the things they choose to follow.\n\n3) Do you consider yourself one?\n\nOh hell yes! Especially for all things Godzilla and action figures!\n\nYou can follow Michael on Facebook, the Hooligan Comics FB page, and their Kickstarter Page.\n\nCasting Call: Madman\n\nWelcome to Casting Call! Where we pick our favorite comic books and do some fantasy casting for them! This week, Michael Allred’s Madman!\n\nFor those that have not had the pleasure of reading a Madman comic here is the rundown.\n\nFrank Einstein was born Zane Townsend, an agent of the Tri-Eye Agency. Townsend was killed in a car accident, then stitched back together and brought to life by two scientists, Dr. Egon Boiffard and Dr. Gillespie Flem. This resurrection left him amnesiac, and the resurrected John Doe was named after Boiffard’s artistic and scientific heroes, Frank Sinatra and Albert Einstein, respectively. The procedure left Frank with supernatural reflexes and a slight degree of precognitive and empathic power; however, he remembers nothing about his former life, but faint, troubling memories relating to his death. Madman’s costume is based on the only thing he can clearly remember: a fascination with a comic book character called Mr. Excitement. Frank Einstein now lives as a jack-of-all-trades wanderer, accompanied by a variety of allies.\n\nWe have had numerous close calls of a Madman film coming to fruition but to no avail. Robert Rodriguez was attached at one point along with rumors of Robin Williams, Jack Black, and even Kevin Bacon slated to don the lighting bolt! With all that being said here is our choices for the Madman film!\n\nMadman/Frank Einstein – Adrien Brody\n\nModeling himself after his hero, Frank likes to try to get in the way when bad things happen to good people. He and his scientist friends get into many adventures but Frank prefers to spend time with his girlfriend Joe (short for Josephine).\n\nBrody is the perfect casting choice. He has shown he can do drama, comedy, and action; all of which are needed for this role. I’ve seen many other sites cast Nathan Fillion. Now, we don’t have a problem with Fillion, however he is getting up there in age and would have to constantly train to do the action scenes. To start a franchise you need someone who could play the role for a bit. Brody has the chops and the x-factor to play Madman.\n\nJoe Lombard – Ilsa Fisher\n\nJoe was a lab assistant for Dr. Flem and Dr. Boiffard, who they hired out as a secretary to the reformed G-Men’s private detective business. She was sent to work there so she would be able to keep a close eye on Frank, who was working as a freelance psychic in the same building. Frank becomes smitten with Joe from the moment he first sees her. Later, after being rescued from Monstadt and his goons by Frank, Joe reveals she had always had a crush on him and thinks he is the sweetest man she’s ever met.\n\nFisher has that girl-next-door feel to her. The chemistry between her and Brody would be off the charts and keep us watching.\n\nDr. Flem – Hugh Laurie\n\nDr. Gillespie Flem was a scientist that worked with Dr. Boiffard for Mr. Monstadt. Seeing that Monstadt was basically evil, Flem decided to continue his research on his own. Working in Buzztown, Dr. Flem was able to create clones of himself. Unfortunately, he and his clones were infected with a contagion. Soon, all of them, including Dr. Flem were beginning to disintegrate. In order to prevent the infection from reaching his head, Flem had Frank chop off his head and place it in a special chemical he created.\n\nWhat’s not to like about Laurie taking this part? He definitely has the look and could play the eccentric scientist in his sleep.\n\nDr. Boiffard – Christopher Walken\n\nDr. Boiffard used to work as a police coroner. When a body was found at a car crash, the police officer brought the unknown body to Boiffard because he owed him a favor. Dr. Boiffard, along with Dr. Flem, conducted an experiment and was able to resurrect the body. The person had no memories of his previous life. Boiffard decided to name him Frank Einstein after his artistic and intellectual heroes, Frank Sinatra and Albert Einstein. Frank went on to become know as Madman. Boiffard soon started experimenting brain growth on himself to make him smarter.\n\nWalken loves taking roles that are a bit out there. He looks like Boiffard, he can act the mad scientist role with the best of them, and him and Hugh Laurie on screen together would be amazing.\n\nMott from Hopple – Louis C.K.\n\nOne of Franks first missions was when an alien named Mott, from the planet Hopple, who came to earth to find help. Madman jumped at the opportunity and saved Mott from the evil alien Zanelle who wanted to marry and eat Mott. Frank and Mott became very good friends and would adventure together many times.\n\nSince this would be an obviously CG role, all you would need is the voice of a man on the run. C.K. would lend that everyman tone to Mott.\n\nMr. Monstadt – Terence Stamp\n\nMonstadt was a former employer of Dr. Boiffard. He and Boiffard worked together on the process that allowed Frank to be brought back. Once Monstadt found out that Boiffard had successfully done it he wanted the process for himself and attempted to kill Boiffard and take his work for himself. He was thwarted by Frank during their initial meeting and has been the main villain of the series.\n\nTerence Stamp as a bad buy? Um, yes.\n\nBonnie – Kayley Cuoco\n\nDr. Flem’s girlfriend. Frank saved Bonnie from Dr. Flem’s mutated clones. After she was rescued, Frank took her to Dr. Flem’s cabin where she met him and fell in love during their time together. Dr. Flem taught Bonnie a lot and she went to the University to become a scientist as well.\n\nWith her role as Penny on Big Bang Theory, Cuoco is not afraid to play the girlfriend of the smart guy. She has the look and the ability to hold her own side by side with Hugh Laurie.\n\nGale – Rashida Jones\n\nGail was Dr. Flem’s assistant. When Dr. Flem successfully created several clones of himself, they were gentile and longed to learn. The clones became interested in Astronomy and took it upon themselves to pin down Gale and tattoo her body with stars and planets. Gale wrapped her body with bandages soaked in a chemical to try to remove her tattoos. The chemical worked in removing the tattoos but also made her invisible.\n\nRashida is a great actress and would probably steal her scenes with everyone else playing Flem’s sarcastic and enduring assistant Gale.\n\nThe G-Men from Hell / Dean Crept – Zac Efron & Mike Mattress – Dave Franco\n\nWhen corrupt FBI agents Dean Crept and Mike Mattress die, they are sent to hell, though they believe it must be an error. They manage to escape by stealing a magical crystal from Satan which sends them back to Earth. Determined to buy their way into heaven, the two decide to perform good deeds despite their ignorance of morality. They set up a private investigation business and hire Joe as their secretary. They are a constant thorn in Frank’s side.\n\nTwo of three characters from the Madman world to already appear in a film (Dr. Boiffard being the other). The characters helmed their own solo film, G-Men From Hell, that wasn’t all that well received. Here we cast Efron and Franco as partners in a P.I. firm. The team has already done well together as seen in Neighbors, so we have no doubt they’d be great in these parts.\n\nThere’s our choices for the Madman film! Did you like our choices? Who would you pick for the roles? Let us know in the comments section!\n\nCOULD A LIVE ACTION AKIRA DO WELL TODAY?\n\nThe Anime genre has come a long way since Katsuhiro Otomo’s 1982 Manga opus, Akira, was adapted into a 1988 film that forever changed how adults would view animation. “Cartoons”, as many call them, would no longer be viewed as just for kids; They were then considered a marketable and financially viable market for adults in the west. For years Anime was relegated to the Asian markets and if you wanted one would have to order it from a specialty shop. If it wasn’t for Akira we would have never gotten Anime in the states such as Dragon Ball, Spirited Away, Ghost in The Shell, and others.\n\nThe Manga of Akira ran from 1982 to 1990 in the states and has been collected in several large “Phonebook” sized omnibi. It is regarded as one of the greatest graphic novels of all time and it too paved the way for Manga as a genre to stake a claim in the west.\n\nThe film version was a visual masterpiece of animation at that time and still holds up even by today’s standards. The movie, however, had its detractors as much as it had praise. The differences between the film and book were quite big. The characters were much more fleshed out in the book vs the film and we weren’t treated to Akira himself in the movie as we were in the book. Kaneda and Tetsuo (the two leads) had their stories more intertwined and secondary character Kei was given more facetime in the book.\n\nThere have been several attempts to make a live action version of Akira. Warner Bros. acquired the rights in 2002 and have had a few false starts on production and casting. Producer Andrew Lazar stated they “…contemplated splitting it (Akira) into two movies based on three manga volumes each…” Other notable items from the attempted film are:\n\nHaving the setting be Manhattan instead of Tokyo.\n\nHaving a cast of white actors when the characters are Japanese. George Takei even stated in an interview that casting white actors in Japanese roles would offend asians and fans of the original works.\n\nThere have been many names attached to the several starts to the film such as: Christopher Nolan, George Miller, Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Marco Ramirez, Ken Watanabe, Jackie Chan, and Takeshi Kitano.\n\nI believe if done properly by a production company who wants to keep true to the source material, this could be a blockbuster, sci-fi movie of epic proportions. With the advancements we’ve made in special effects, bringing the scenes from the page to the silver screen would be that much easier. Movies like Watchmenand 300 have shown that a direct adaption of the graphic novel could work, we think that they should have some leeway with what goes in the final film though. The current movie going crowd is ready for Akira. Once again Akira could be a trendsetting film and make it easier to translate notable Anime to live action films in the west.\n\nCASTING CALL: THE JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA\n\nWelcome to Casting Call! Where we pick our favorite comic books and do some fantasy casting for them! This week, DC Comics’ Justice Society of America!\n\nNow the JSA has had many incarnations over the years, with a roster of varied heroes, however they are the first and longest lasting superhero team in comics. They went through a dead period for a bit then made a strong comeback in the late 90’s and held steady for a bit. They are constantly in demand as a team and comic fans buy their series when they come out. DC needs a team that isn’t just the JLA and that could be a team to help bring in older characters as well as younger ones.\n\nWithout further ado here are our casting picks for a JSA movie!\n\nNikolaj Coster-Waldau as Hourman/Rex Tyler\n\nA chemist who discovered the miraculous chemical Miraclo, Rex Tyler became the super-hero Hourman, able to use extraordinary abilities for an hour at a time. He became a valued member of the Justice Society and the All-Star Squadron. Coster-Waldau has appeared in our Casting Calls before and it won’t be the last time. He mostly plays self-centered cocky bad guys, but we feel has the ability to play the smart doting hero as well.\n\nEric Dane as Green Lantern/Alan Scott\n\nAlan Scott is the original super-hero known as Green Lantern. The weapon he wields is a mystic power ring that turns his thoughts into energy constructs. Although he has never actually been a member of the Green Lantern Corps, his ring taps into the same power source that fuels them. Dane is mostly known from Grey’s Anatomy plying Dr. Mark Sloan and his one foray into comic book movies was as Jamie Madrox aka Multiple Man in X-Men: The Last Stand, but we won’t hold that against him. He has the presence and charisma to play one of the elder members of the JSA.\n\nJosh Holloway as Sandman/Sanderson Hawkins\n\nSandy Hawkins was the ward of original Sandman Wesley Dodds, and he is the nephew of Dodd’s lifelong partner, Dian Belmont. After a bizarre accident, Hawkins was able to transform himself into a pure silicon or sand form. Josh Holloway has yet to have that breakout role that moves him from supporting player to leading man, this could be that role. Not since Sawyer on Lost has Holloway had an audience grabbing part, playing one of the main JSA members will allow this to happen. Holloway’s calling is comic book movies, it could be his milieu.\n\nJason Winston as Mr. Terrific/Michael Holt\n\nMichael Holt is the third smartest man in the world, a brilliant inventor and the second super-hero to call himself Mister Terrific. He is the successor to Terry Sloane. Despite having no powers, his T-Spheres make him invisible to technology and he is a member of the Justice Society. Another Grey’s Anatomy alumnus, Winston is the perfect choice for Mr. Terrific. He can play funny, serious, and has the obvious physicality needed to play the role. Not to mention they could use Winston if they decided to spin him off into a Checkmate movie.\n\nTom Welling as Captain Marvel/Shazam\n\nCaptain Marvel is known as the world’s mightiest mortal, a super-hero with magic origins. He was chosen to be a champion for good by the powerful wizard Shazam, and gains incredible powers whenever he speaks the wizard’s name. In his secret identity he is young Billy Batson, an idealistic news reporter working in Fawcett City, but when he speaks the name Shazam he transforms into his fully-grown heroic persona. Welling was our choice for Shazam in a previous Casting Call (click here to see it), and we have not changed our mind.\n\nJeremy Shada as Billy Batson\n\nBilly Batson was a terrible foster child. After the death of his parents and his treatment thereafter Billy had become cold and cruel to most people. Growing selfish and heartless, he went from foster home to foster home until he landed in an orphanage in Philadelphia and was partially forced to live with a new family; the Vasquez’s. He decides to leave as he’s done countless times before but as he does he’s whisked away to the Rock of Eternity where he meets the Wizard. There, he searched the boy’s soul and saw that he was not perfectly good. When he told him so, Billy was instantly enraged, telling the wizard off for thinking that perfect good exists. The Wizard, seeing the boy’s point, witnesses all the good Billy has done and accepts that the world has changed and now perfection has been exchanged for the hope of becoming good. Although he stated that he won’t be able to take them back once given, the Wizard grants Billy the ability to wield the Living Lightning, turning him to the Champion, Shazam. Another choice from our Shazam Casting Call.\n\nGerard Butler as Wildcat/Ted Grant\n\nAs an orphan, Ted Grant took up a position as a heavyweight boxer, and eventually became tangled in his sinister managers’ plans. As a result, his mentor “Socker” Smith was killed by a boxing glove loaded with a poison needle by Grant’s managers Flint and Skinner. The dose was only intended to slow Smith, but the duo misjudged the potency. When Grant was arrested for the crime, Flint and Skinner, afraid he might know what had happened, arranged a hit on the young fighter. Ted Grant survived, but the policemen with him were dead. He became a fugitive and came upon a kid who was robbed of his Green Lantern comic. The kid, describing the mystery-man Green Lantern, inspired Ted to create a costume of a large black cat. He took the name of Wildcat and vowed to clear his name. He brought Flint and Skinner to justice, as the villains were forced to confess and Grant’s name was cleared. Wildcat continued to fight against crime. Butler has had success in some action films, 300, Olympus/London Has Fallen, and Gamer; however he has yet to really capitalize on the success of 300. A further venture into comic book films will solidify that. He could easily play the rough and tumble Wildcat.\n\nHugh Laurie as Doctor Fate/Kent Nelson\n\nKent Nelson is Doctor Fate, a powerful sorcerer and agent for the Lords of Order who fights evil alongside his wife Inza. His amulet,cloak and helmet are creations of the ancient Nabu who acts as his mentor and spiritual guide. He is a founding member of the Justice Society of America. House himself is the most logical choice to bring Dr. Fate to life. Nothing more to say on this!\n\nSimon Baker as The Flash/Jay Garrick\n\nThe first in a long line of super-speedsters. Jay Garrick is capable of running at velocities near the speed of light. A scientist, Garrick has also served as mentor to other speedsters, and to many heroes over several generations. Baker as Garrick is a perfect casting. An easy going attitude, the cool uncle to the younger kids, and he would look good in the Hermes helmet.\n\nLiam Hemsworth as Atom Smasher/Al Rothstein\n\nAlbert Rothstein was the grandson of the reluctant super-villain known as Cyclotron, from whom Albert inherited his metahuman powers by which he can control his molecular structure (allowing him to alter the size and density of his body). He was the godson of Al Pratt, the Golden Age Atom, and raised to becoming a hero known as Nuklon and becoming a charter member of Infinity, Inc.and subsequently served in the Justice League. He took the Atom Smasher identity shortly before the founding of the current Justice Society of America, of which he was a charter member. Liam could have a career to rival his brother Chris’, just for DC instead of Marvel.\n\nJon Hamm as Doctor Midnite/Pieter Cross\n\nPieter Cross is the third vigilante to call himself Doctor Mid-Nite. Charles McNider and Beth Chapel were his predecessors. Beginning his career as a highly-skilled surgeon, he was blinded by a chemical accident. This made him only able to see in the dark, using infrared vision. Special goggles allow him to see, and he fights crime using martial arts and blackout bombs to blind his opponents. He has been a member of the Justice Society, and he functions as their team medic. Hamm is destined to play a role in a comic film sooner or later, and he’s still young enough to do the action parts.\n\nElle Fanning as Stargirl/Courtney Whitmore\n\nStargirl is Courtney Whitmore, a teenage girl living in Blue Valley who becomes a superhero. Courtney began as the second Star-Spangled Kid when she discovered the gear of retired hero Sylvester Pemberton. Her stepfather Pat Dugan, originally known as Stripsey and later S.T.R.I.P.E., was Pemberton’s adult sidekick. Jack Knight later gave Courtney his Cosmic Staff, and she took the name “Stargirl” to honor the Starman legacy. The often overlooked Fanning, Elle has the precociousness and fun loving attitude to play Stargirl.\n\nAlice Eve as Power Girl/Karen Starr\n\nKara was the Supergirl of Earth 2 and the cousin to Superman, who was raised by Kal and his wife Lois Lane as if she was their only daughter. She was also best friends with Helena Wayne, the Earth 2 Robin, and Batman’s daughter. Supergirl was one of the heroes who defended Earth from Darkseid’s invading forces. She did not get directly involved in the fight; instead, she guarded the nuclear devices that the world’s governments had decided to keep to the very last. Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman were killed, but they managed to destroy Darkseid’s towers, disabling the Parademons and saving the earth. As Supergirl caught up with Robin, and without any time to grieve their lost mentors and family, their attention was caught by a Boom Tube portal with a lone figure appearing within it. The Earth’s last two remaining heroes plunged into the portal and came to New 52 Earth. Alice Eve as Power Girl….um, so much yes! Eve would be the perfect choice, not to mention she has the name/look to be able to pull of a solo film as well.\n\nDonald Glover as Jakeem Thunder/Jakeem Williams\n\nJakeem Johnny Williams is a precocious teenager from Keystone City. Jakeem’s mother left his father while she was still pregnant with the boy, and he was orphaned when his mother died of cancer. His aunt Lashawn was then granted custody, and his father, Phil, never knew about his birth. Jakeem became a self-reliant latchkey kid who grew up on the streets and adopted a tough, foul-mouthed attitude in order to survive. Eventually, Jakeem comes into possession of Johnny Thunder’s genie called Thunderbolt. He received the genie from a pen given to him by Jay Garrick. Donald Glover has been lobbying to play Spider-Man for some time, we doubt this will ever happen. So instead of casting him as what everyone would expect (Static Shock), we went in a whole new direction. Glover as Jakeem would give the character a ton of exposure and possibly another life in comics. He would be DC’s answer to Spider-Man.\n\nCharlie Hunnam & Odette Annable as Hawkman/Carter Hall & Hawkwoman/Shiera Sanders\n\nCarter Hall and Shiera Sanders live out their destinies as reincarnations of the ancient Egyptian prince and princess, Khufu and Chay-Ara, using magic weaponry and Nth Metal. Hunnam and Annable have the look and are well known, but not too well known that they would be difficult to sign for multiple movies. If you’ve seen Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy and/or Annable in Banshee then you would know how perfect they are for the roles of the doomed couple.\n\nNow let’s bring on the bad guys!\n\nZachary Quinto as Vandal Savage\n\nWhen caveman Vandar Adg was bathed in the radiation of a meteorite thousands of years ago, it provides him a superior intellect and nigh-immortality. He has manipulated history to his advantage, assassinating Caesar, advising Napoleon, and committing murders as Jack the Ripper. Savage has battled heroes all throughout history, including Immortal Man (who also gained similar gifts from the meteorite) and the Hawk avatar, he crossed swords with the Green Lantern while working with the Nazis, before becoming one of the most frequent threats to face the JSA, and one of the founding members of the Injustice Society. Quinto is great as Spock in the Star Trek series there’s no denying that, we however feel he was at his best playing the superhero serial killer Sylar on Heroes. He was evil, really evil. Yes, they toned down his character later in the series and even made him a hero, but he will always be remembered for the nastiness of the early seasons. That is why he is the perfect choice for Vandal Savage.\n\nDwayne Johnson as Black Adam/Teth-Adam\n\nA champion for Shazam in Egypt during the reign of Prince Khufu, Teth-Adam’s family is slain by Vandal Savage’s slave Ahk-ton which spirals him toward darkness in the thrall of Shazam’s demonic daughter Blaze. Shazam strips him of his power, storing it in a scarab, and his former champion rapidly ages for the centuries he had lived as a pseudo-god/avatar. Teth-Adam’s reincarnated as a sociopath named Theo Adam whom discovers the scarab and uses it to become a super-villain. Teth-Adam begins to become able to assert control over the Black Adam persona, capable of complete control after a malignant tumor is removed from the brain of Theo. Becoming a member of the JSA, Adam would again turn to darkness when he invades his native Kahndaq to free it from a dictator, and takes control of it with a group of former JSA allies/members (most notably Atom Smasher). Later he battled them again after his family is murdered and he declares war against the world. Already slated for the Shazam movie, Johnson simply slides into the same role in JSA.\n\nAlan Ritchson as Magog/William Matthews\n\nAn Old God whom empowered William Matthews (who took on his master’s name) to eliminate false gods in preparation of the arrival of Gog to Earth. The original absorbs his disciple and is reborn, performing miracles in exchange for worship. These actions split the Justice Society, one side led by Magog and performing Gog’s will until the Old God tried to turn the Flash into lightning. His would-be acolytes reformed and the JSA whole again, they decapitate Gog and embed his head into the Source Wall. Ritchson has the look and size to play Magog and even played Aquaman on Smallville.\n\nGeno Segers as Solomon Grundy/Cyrus Gold\n\nA supestrongswamp elemental pseudo-zombie born in Slaughter Swamp outside Gotham City created from the body of murdered merchant Cyrus Gold, he would face Green Lantern, as wood in his body gave him resistance to the Lantern’s ring, before becoming a frequent opponent to the Justice Society and League, often destroyed but returning to some semblance of reanimation. Over the years he absorbed some of Green Lantern’s power. Sometimes, Grundy would return different, such as a childlike being that followed around Jade or a gentlemanly intellectual that tried to attain true immortality using Amazo. Segers is big and mean in Banshee, plus he has quite the intimidating voice to boot. Paint him white and have him beat up people, done.\n\nMichael C. Hall as Johnny Sorrow\n\nAn otherworldly villain, Sorrow became a pawn of the King of Tears that saw an opportunity to get revenge on the Justice Society who foiled his schemes in turn tearing his body apart and making him a target for the Lovecraftian entity. He would be the force to reform the Injustice Society. His face has been so transformed by his experience that it will kill most beings that look at it. Now Sorrow is a character whose face we barely see and that’s fine, Hall has a recognizable voice as well. He’s perfect.\n\nDamian Lewis as Per Degaton\n\nAn assistant for the Time Trust (a group of scientists that developed time travel technology often involving the JSA), Per Degaton would turn on his compatriots and meet the time traveling robot Mekanique. She enlists his aid against the All-Star Squadron which starts him down a path against history’s heroes as he unlocks the secrets of time, becoming one of the JSA’s most consistent enemies and a founding member of the Injustice Society as he attempts to alter history to his advantage after stealing the Time Machine of Professor Zee. Lewis is a great actor who could play evil quite well. Not to mention he looks like Per\n\nThere you have it folks! What do you think? Did we miss anyone? Let us know in the comments if you agree with our choices!\n\nMOVIE REVIEW: THE REVENANT\n\nThere may be some slight spoilers in this review so read at your own risk!\n\nDirected by: Alejandro Iñárritu\n\nScreenplay by: Mark Smith, Alejandro Iñárritu\n\nBased on the book by: Michael Punke\n\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter\n\nBack in the 1820’s there was a lot of wild in the wilderness. This was found in the brutality of nature, and sometimes the cruelty of men. When a group of hunters were collecting pelts in the vast area of the Louisiana Purchase, they would need a guide and some protection.\n\nIn the movie, The Revenant, the guide was Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who knew the area and could find a safe passage. He brought along his son, who was a half-breed from his dead Pawnee Indian wife. Glass was working with a hunting party led by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson).\n\nTheir camp is attacked by Native American Arikara warriors, looking for the chief’s daughter. Many men are killed, and the rest escape down a river on a rickety raft. Glass explains they must ditch the raft because it would attract more Indian attacks. They hide the remaining pelts and travel over land.\n\nGlass is scouting the land ahead to find the best route, but he is mauled and nearly killed by a bear. Glass is gravely injured, and the rest of the group must carry him. Captain Henry decides to push forward back to a fort, and he leaves Glass with three watchful protectors.\n\nHis son Hawk stays, along with Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Bridger (Will Poulter). Fitzgerald would rather see Glass dead than to babysit him, and he is upset at losing so many pelts in the Indian raid. He quietly plans to kill Glass and leave to get back to camp.\n\nHawk is killed by Fitzgerald, and Glass is almost dead and buried. Fitzgerald forces Bridger to leave, saying they are now alone and the Indians are coming to attack. Glass, in massive agony, pulls himself up and into moving, crawling, getting some distance between him and the natives who might come back and finish him off.\n\nFitzgerald gets a bonus payment for watching over Glass until he ‘died’, and for giving him a proper burial. Bridger will have none of it, and he knows that Fitzgerald is not being truthful. Glass has some close encounters with savages who chase after him and try to kill him. The Arikara hunters are also dealing with some underhanded French traders to sell stolen pelts.\n\nGlass finds a lone Pawnee Indian warrior who is getting back to his tribe. They share raw bison meat and a horse ride until Glass is overcome with his wounds. The Pawnee constructs a makeshift sweat lodge to help Glass to heal. Days later, Glass finds that his path will no longer include his Pawnee friend, and that the chief’s daughter is being held by the French traders.\n\nGlass frees the daughter and gets his horse again, but is pursued by the angry French. He finds a unique way to escape, a way that might be called the opposite of a cliffhanger. Again injured and alone at the bottom of the cliff, Glass goes full “Empire Strikes Back” and uses the dead horse in a new and unusual way.\n\nGlass is finally found by the members of the camp, led by Captain Henry. They are all shocked to see Glass survived, but none more so than Fitzgerald. He sees a less than warm welcome back from Glass. So Fitz steals all the money from the camp and splits back to Texas.\n\nCaptain Henry is prepared to go alone to chase Fitzgerald, but Glass knows that he could track him better than anyone. Even being close to death would not stop him, He’s not afraid of dying, he says “I done it already”. The two of them go and pursue Fitzgerald and there is, again, more human cruelty and suffering to be found.\n\nIñárritu has created a beautiful, yet perfectly uneasy to view, panorama of Northwest Territory and human nastiness. The scenes of magnificent mountains and flowing streams, the dense forest and the barren tundra are matches with sweat and the blood of the characters. Fierce battles between tribes and hunters can happen right next to a gentle brook. A deadly one-on-one fight spills blood on the pure white snow and ice next to a river.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio becomes near-dead portrayal of Hugh Glass, full of nothing by survival instinct and the will for revenge. He has been nominated many times for Oscar for Best Actor, and he might have found his perfect role. It would be a shame if this performance is not so honored.\n\nAlso Tom hardy is outstanding as Fitzgerald. He captures the double-crossing, spiteful nature of the character with his easy speech and the dark intense darting of his eyes. His very nature is so loathsome that you might want that bear to pop out again and finish off Fitzgerald.\n\nPossibly the candidate for Best Picture, at least. The intense moments are perfectly drawn out and the motion of the camera filming the sequence seems to follow what your eyes would normally look for. The way that many scenes are filmed are astonishing.\n\nThis was a terribly difficult film to make, it has been said. But what they did make is magnificent. It will be difficult for many people to watch, because of the content, and because of the length.\n\nBut it would decidedly be worth your effort to see The Revenant, only if you can ‘bear’ it…\n\nLength 156 minutes\n\nRated R\n\nDAVID BOWIE 1947-2016\n\nLegendary musician and actor David Bowie has passed away after an 18 month battle with cancer. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Bowie’s rep said:\n\n“David Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous 18 month battle with cancer. While many of you will share in this loss, we ask that you respect the family’s privacy during their time of grief.”\n\nMost children of the 80’s remember Bowie fondly from Jim Henson’s film, Labyrinth, where he played Jareth the Goblin King. Bowie’s music has inspired many musicians and is heard far and wide. Such hits as: China Girl, Rebel Rebel, Heroes, Fame, Under Pressure and Let’s Dance are still in heavy radio play today.\n\nA great singer, musician, actor, and man, David Bowie will be missed by everyone.\n\nCelebrities were sending their thoughts on Bowie’s passing as well:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Simon_Pegg/status/686456455894036480\n\n50 BEST 80’S SCI-FI/FANTASY MOVIES\n\nHaving been indoctrinated into the Movie Buff world by my father at a young age, I grew up watching tons of science fiction and fantasy movies in the 80’s. These were my formative years of what would become my snobbery of what those types of movies should be. In the 90’s, 00’s, and 10’s sci-fi/fantasy has improved somewhat, however most of what passes for sci-fi nowadays are comic book movies and your occasional Trek or Wars films. So feeling nostalgic I went back and picked what are my top 50 sci-fi/fantasy movies of the 80’s.

What movies did I leave out? What should be included? Let us know in the comments!\n\nTHE CAST OF ‘FROM DUSK TILL DAWN’ 20 YEARS LATER!\n\nWhen From Dusk Till Dawn was first released it did modestly at the box office, but then it really cleaned up on home video and became a cult classic that is still loved today. Let’s see what the cast has been up to the past 20 years.\n\nQuentin Tarantino as Richard Gecko\n\nPulling double duty as writer and actor, Tarantino was actually quite good in his role as the psychotic/delusional Richie Gecko.\n\nWhile he does cameos in some movies (Little Nicky, Alias, The Muppets Wizard of Oz, Duck Dodgers, Planet Terror, Sukiyaki Western Django, Diary of the Dead, andShe’s Funny That Way) Tarantino is mainly writing/directing these days with Jackie Brown, Kill Bill 1&2, an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Sin City, 2 episodes of C.S.I.,Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained (which got him an Oscar win), writer on the From Dusk Till Dawn series, and the just released The Hateful Eight.\n\nGeorge Clooney as Seth Gecko\n\nOne of the few times that the Clooney has played a bad guy, and he was pretty damn good at it. Clooney with a temper is something we have yet to see again and it’s too bad, he was right good bastard.\n\nSince FDTD the Clooney has stepped behind the camera as well as been in front of it, and won two Oscars (Argo and Syriana) . As a director he’s done: Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Unscripted, Good Night and Good Luck, Leatherheads, The Ides of March, Monuments Men, and Suburbicon. As an actor he’s done many films since but these are his most noteworthy: O’ Brother Where art Thou?, The Perfect Storm, Ocean’s 11/12/13, E.R., Syriana, The Descendants, Gravity, and the upcoming Hail Caesar!.\n\nJuliette Lewis as Kate Fuller\n\nHaving acted since the late ’80s Lewis was already a seasoned actress and this was her second go round with Tarantino, having starred in Natural Born Killers in 1994 which he wrote. Lewis’s Kate was an unlikely heroine in the film but she was able to hold her own with all the testosterone being tossed around. In our opinion Lewis and Clooney should have been brought back in a sequel that would have brought Kate and Seth together again to defeat more vamps.\n\nSince FDTD Lewis has been in many films with these being her most notable: The Other Sister, Old School, The Switch, The Firm, Kelly & Cal, Wayward Pines, and Secrets & Lies.\n\nHarvey Keitel as Jacob Fuller\n\nNo stranger to acting, Keitel is also a Tarantino favorite, starring in: Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and FDTD. Keitel’s Jacob was a flawed man who had a simmering darkness just under the surface.\n\nSince FDTD Keitel has been everywhere, these are his most notable films: Cop Land, U-571, National Treasure, Be Cool, Life on Mars, Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and Youth.\n\nSalma Hayek as Santanico Pandemonium\n\nWow. That’s really all we can say about Salma in FDTD. She not only mesmerized the characters on screen but the audience watching the movie as well. Having a fairly brief yet vital part in the movie was not enough Salma for us, but she was amazing for those moments. Having been mostly a TV actress until Robert Rodriguez cast her in Desperado, Salma made a name for herself with not only her beauty but her acting chops and comedic timing.\n\nSince FDTD she has been consistently acting but these are her most notable films: Fools Rush In, Dogma, Frida, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Ugly Betty, Grown Ups, Savages, and Everly. Remind yourself of THAT iconic dance.\n\nCheech Marin as Border Guard/Chet Pussy/Carlos\n\nPulling triple duty as the Border Guard, the Titty Twister barker Chet Pussy, and Carlos the drug kingpin the Geckos are supposed to meet at the bar, Marin was great in all 3 roles.\n\nA well known and established actor, since FDTD Marin has been in many movies with these being his most notable: Nash Bridges, Christmas with the Kranks, Judging Amy, Lost, Cars 1&2, Machete, Rob, and Jane the Virgin.\n\nDanny Trejo as Razor Charlie\n\nOne of the most well known character actors of our generation, Trejo is typically cast as the tough badass, FDTD was no different, with the exception of blood sucking bartender as a title now too. A favorite of Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, Trejo has been acting since 1983 and hasn’t let up playing the tough guy in many movies as well as delving into comedy parts here and there (see the Brady Bunch Snickers commercial for an example).\n\nSince FDTD Trejo’s most notable movies are: From Dusk Till Dawn 2&3, Con-Air, Reindeer Games, Spy Kids 1-4, The Salton Sea, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, The Devil’s Rejects, Planet Terror, Fanboys, Breaking Bad, King of the Hill, Predators, Machete 1&2, Bad Ass 1-3, the From Dusk Till Dawn tv series, and 31 (yes 31!) movies coming out in the next 2 years! Talk about hard working!\n\nTom Savini as Sex Machine\n\nThe guy with the crotch gun that stole the show. Savini is mostly known as a SFX guy in Hollywood but does some acting when he finds a movie he likes. Working since the ’70s Savini has been apart of some popular horror films (Friday the 13th, Creepshow, Day of the Dead, Monkey Shines, and Tales from the Dark Side).\n\nSince FDTD Savini has been in: Dawn of the Dead, Land of the Dead, Forest of the Damned, Planet Terror, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Machete 1&2, and Django Unchained.\n\nFred Williamson as Frost\n\nWilliamson and his blaxploitation films of the ’70s were a major influence on Tarantino and his movies, so casting him in FDTD was a dream come true. Kicking vampire ass while puffing on a cigar, Williamson got to show a new generation of fans why he was a badass back in the day.\n\nSince FDTD Williamson’s notable films have been: Original Gangstas, Fast Track, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, Starsky & Hutch, Atomic Eden, and Hello Paradise.\n\nThere were also a number of bit parts by notable actors and one soon to be name such as:\n\nMichael Parks as Earl McGraw\n\nDespite the character’s death in the beginning of FDTD, Parks played Earl McGraw in 4 other films: Kill Bill 1&2, Death Proof, and Planet Terror. Parks is also another favorite of Tarantino. Edgar Mcgraw (the character’s son) was played by Parks real life son, James Parks. Edgar was seen in From Dusk Till Dawn 2, Kill Bill Vol. 1, Death Proof, and has a brief appearance in a deleted scene from Machete.Planet Terror also saw the introduction of McGraw’s daughter Dakota (Marley Shelton). McGraw must be a real tough guy to survive as long as he did in the Tarantinoverse! The elder Parks also played Esteban (Bill’s father figure who told Kiddo where to find him) in Kill Bill Vol. 2.\n\nSince FDTD Parks has been busy with Tarantino/Rodriguez movies as well as a ton of others, these are his most notable: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Smokin’ Aces 2, Argo, Red State, and Tusk.\n\nKelly Preston as Kelly Hogue\n\nPreston actually played the reporter twice, once in FDTD and again in a Tarantino produced film, Curdled. Both times she was reporting on the Gecko brothers.\n\nSince FDTD Preston has been in these notable films: Jerry Maguire, For Love of the Game, Sky High, and Old Dogs.\n\nJohn Hawkes as Pete Bottoms\n\nThe doomed liquor store clerk was played with great aplomb by character actor Hawkes. Acting since the ’80s Hawkes has the face you recognize but ask “What’s his name?”\n\nNotable films Hawkes has been apart of are: Rush Hour, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, The Perfect Storm, Identity, Miami Vice, Deadwood, American Gangster, Contagion, Lincoln, and Everest.\n\nJohn Saxon as Stanley Chase\n\nAnother face you will recognize, Saxon had been in the business since the ’50s. Prior to his FDTD cameo, Saxon would be most recognized from: Enter the Dragon, Gunsmoke, Fantasy Island, A Nightmare on Elm Street 1&3, Dynasty, Falcon Crest, andMelrose Place. After FDTD Saxon was seen in: C.S.I., Old Dogs, and The Extra.\n\nGreg Nicotero as Sex Machine’s Buddy\n\nYep, The Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead producer/director Nicotero had a small part in FDTD. He has been all over Hollywood writing, directing, producing, acting, and makeup/SFX!\n\nJack of all trades, Nicotero’s notable after FDTD credits read like this: SFX – Little Nicky, Cats & Dogs, Bubba Ho-Tep, Hulk, Spy Kids 3D, Casino Royale, Transformers, The Grey, Annabelle. Makeup – Wishmaster, The Faculty, House on Haunted Hill, The Green Mile, Thir13en Ghosts, Kill Bill Vol. 1&2, Sin City, Hostel, Deadwood, and Splice. Director – The Walking Dead. Producer – Fear The Walking Dead, and The Walking Dead. Actor – The Hills Have Eyes, Diary of The Dead, Inglourious Basterds, Piranha 3D, and of course The Walking Dead. Whew!\n\nRobert Rodriguez\n\nIn a blink-and-you’ll-miss-him uncredited role as a member of the Titty Twister Band. Even the director got in on the action here. He writes/produces/directs and occasionally appears in uncredited parts in some movies and TV shows. Nash Bridges, Lisa Picard is Famous, Bullfighter, Deadline, Sin City 1&2, Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, High Hopes, Planet Terror, The Cleveland Show, and Amelia’s 25th.\n\n…and last… Ernest Liu as Scott Fuller\n\nYep, the forgotten actor. Liu had 3 other roles, small ones at that, before disappearing all together. He was horrible in the role and stiff as an actor with no range at all, his death in the movie could not come soon enough. He was so bad as an actor that Robert Rodriguez alone has more screen time than Liu’s whole career. Sad.\n\nEASTER EGGS:\n\nTarantino and Clooney had a “cameo” of sorts in the Tarantino produced film Curdled. In a scene where a housekeeper is cleaning up a room the TV is on when a news bulletin comes on with reporter Kelly Hogue (played by Kelly Preston) announcing that the Gecko Brothers have escaped and are on the loose. Mugshots of Tarantino and Clooney as the Geckos is then shown.\n\nBig Kahuna Burger makes an appearance as it does in Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Reservoir Dogs, and Romy & Michele’s High School Reunion.\n\nRed Apple Cigarettes appears on the Gecko’s car dash. Red Apple is the Tarantinoverse cigarette brand as seen in: Django Unchained, Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Planet Terror, and Romy & Michele. Hateful Eight and Django Unchained have Red Apple Rolling Tobacco.\n\nChango Beer. Another Tarantinoverse staple, Chango can be found in:El Mariachi, Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, From Dusk Till Dawn, Sin City 1&2, Death Proof, and Planet Terror.\n\nSeth saying, “Okay Ramblers, let’s get ramblin’.” is a line uttered in Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs by Joe Cabot.\n\nSex Machine’s codpiece pistol can be seen in Robert Rodriguez’sDesperado film in Antonio Banderas’ guitar case.\n\nThe Gecko brothers’ getaway location, El Rey, is also the name of a character from Rodriguez’s Planet Terror movie as well as the name of Rodriguez’s television network.\n\nWhat is your favorite Quentin Tarantino movie?\n\nLATEST STAR WARS FEATURETTE!\n\nWTF HAPPENED TO ALL THE GOOD BANDS!? V – COMEDY EDITON\n\nBy J. Minor\n\nMost women go to the ladies to powder their nose, not Donna. She was already three sheets flapping in the wind when she showed up at the Chinese bistro. The place was kicking into high gear as the late night crowd of wannabe porn stars, drug dealers, Jewish talent agents and new wave freaks, paraded in from the warm LA night through the restaurant door.\n\nI hadn’t seen her since high school. She asked me if I still had the pair of panties she left as a trophy from our last encounter. Even though she was almost knee crawling drunk, she straddled my lap and tried, with little resistance from me, to jam her tongue down my throat.\n\nSo there we were, under the table, waiting on an order of lobster, sniffing coke with a skinny, half retarded sounding guy who resembled Pee Wee Herman. After a lot of lines, the waiter lifted the tablecloth to inform me that they were out of lobster. Time to leave and help Donna find her way home.\n\nI shouldn’t have been surprised that she would pass out before I got the zipper down on her Frederick’s of Hollywood style body suit. It did not surprised me that I attempted to do the deed anyway, that is until the police arrived, and halted my progress.\n\nI found it amusing that the number of her high-rise apartment with the glass elevator was 714, which kept with the theme of her license plates, on the beat up chevy truck she drove, stamped “LUDES.”\n\nWhat did surprise me? She wanted to have me and my best friend, in bed, at the same time, which would make a great tale to tell my friends, if her biker boyfriend, released early from jail, hadn’t shown up.\n\nIt’s too bad that life doesn’t imitate art. I could only wish for my life was this interesting, exciting and perverted.\n\nOnly Cheech & Chong can weave brilliant yarns like this, allowing me the opportunity to relive the fantasy each time I watch my favorite scene from their 1981 movie “Nice Dreams.”\n\nEvelyn Guerrero, playing Donna, is beyond hot. I still have a hard time explaining to my wife, why I have a poster of her tacked to the ceiling above our bed.\n\nOver the years, through experience, I learned a few critical rules. First, never let your wife know her potato salad sucks, you will end up wearing it. Second, never, and I mean never, ask a police officer if he likes his job while he pats you down and gets close to your junk. Finally, if you play the self titled, Cheech & Chong record, at your older brother’s Baptist youth group Christmas party, don’t expect any laughs. “The Pope: Live At The Vatican,” should have gotten a few chuckles, knowing the way Baptists feel about Catholicism, but no, these guys are so tight only dogs can hear them fart.\n\nRichard Anthony “Cheech” Marin and Tommy Chong started their comedy routine in the late sixties. Cheech, avoiding the draft and the Vietnam War, met Chong in Vancouver, British Columbia. Influenced by comedians Lenny Bruce, George Carlin and others, they put together sketch comedy acts which set them apart from the standard stand up routines popular at the time.\n\nAlthough the duo is not considered a musical act, music plays a big role in both their records and movies. “Blind Melon Chitlin,” going downtown, Tyrone Shoelaces singing “Basketball Jones” and “Earache My Eye Featuring Alice Bowie” all portray Cheech and Chong’s appreciation of popular music. Tommy Chong’s love of Gibson guitars is apparent when he lays down riffs on the song “Save The Whales,” in the movie “Nice Dreams.”\n\nThe drug culture in the late sixties and early seventies was mainly underground. It wasn’t until the mid seventies, when publications like High Times, and organizations such as NORML began to change the perception of drug usage in The United States. Midway through the decade, cocaine and marijuana were accepted by citizens of means, and were no longer exclusive to the ghetto, and the back stages of rock and roll concerts. Popular music and media portrayed drug smugglers and dealers as romantics and counter culture heroes.\n\nCheech & Chong capitalized on this trend with their first movie, “Up In Smoke,” released in 1978. Filmed on a small budget, the film grossed more than forty-four million dollars.\n\nTheir next release, 1980s “Cheech And Chong’s Next Movie,” introduces Evelyn Guerrero as “Donna” and Paul Reubens as an early “Pee-Wee Herman.” The movie brought in more than forty-one million dollars and continued the drug fueled comedy journey that started in the first movie.\n\n“Nice Dreams,” my favorite, brings more juvenile but very funny bits to the screen. Watching a midnight viewing of this movie when it came out in 1981, had me in stitches. Of course being stoned out of my mind made it all the funnier. Stacey Keach returns as “Sgt. Stedanko,” who turns into a reptile after smoking too much modified weed. Donna’s back, and Pee-Wee Herman plays an escapee from an insane asylum. A guest appearance by Timothy Leary rounds out the cast.\n\nCheech, wrapped up in a straight jacket with itchy balls is some of the funniest stuff ever put on film.\n\n“Nice Dreams,” brought in thirty-seven million at the box office.\n\nAfter “Nice Dreams,” the box office dollars started to decline. “Things Are Tough All Over” bringing in just over twenty-million dollars, followed by “Still Smoking” with fifteen million. It seemed as though the public was no longer interested in Cheech & Chong’s brand of drug engorged comedy. I am of the opinion that no matter what the movie franchise, after the first three films, the rest are shit. Clint Eastwood’s character, “Dirty Harry,” excluded\n\nCheech Marin and Tommy Chong made a fortune promoting and mocking the drug culture of the 1970s and 80’s. While most of us had to get off the couch, put away the weed and Doritos, get a job and quit doing all the shit we thought was fun, these two guys kept at it. Not selling drugs, but selling the hilarity that sometimes comes from substance abuse.\n\nVery few comedians can perform in the style of Cheech & Chong. Adam Sandler is great at sketch comedy, but uses different subject matter on his recordings. Most of today’s mainstream comics get laughs by overusing terminology that puts your mother in situations of a sexual nature. After hearing the term for the thirtieth time in a set, I wonder if the performers mother might be for sale in the green room.\n\nCheech, going solo, has performed in prime time television and movies. Chong, a long time proponent of marijuana legalization, did time for drug paraphernalia charges in 2003.\n\nThey have both appeared on episodes of South Park,The Simpsons, Saturday Night Live, and various documentary and news telecast.\n\nI will leave you with a clip of “ Old Man And Drunk Latino” from the 2010 show “Hey, Watch This.” Funny stuff.\n\nCOMIC REVIEW: ORANGE\n\nI’ve been on a Shoujo kick recently–some of the titles I’ve checked out lately are Ao Haru Ride (Blue Spring Ride), Kimi ni Todoke, and Wolf Girl Black Prince–and I just finished up Orange by Ichigo Takano. It just finished in August of this year (and a live-action film of the series will be released in December of this year), and I’m glad that I was able to read it after it was already finished because the further the story progressed, the more cliffhangers were left at the end of each chapter. As of right now, Crunchyroll is the only place where you can read the English translation of the manga, but according to myanimelist.net, it will be released in English, in two omnibus volumes, starting in 2016.\n\nI LOVED this story. It instantly captured me and I found myself sucked into its world. I was always hooked in anticipation. Questions flurried through my mind as I flipped through each page. What’s going to happen next? How is this going to end? I made time in my day, at any chance I got, to read just one more chapter. I had to find out how everything would turn out in the end.\n\nOrange focuses on a sixteen-year-old high school student, Naho, and her group of friends as they become close to a new student from Tokyo named Kakeru. The very first page shows a letter that Naho received on the day of her opening ceremony for her second year of high school. She is sixteen years old, and according to the mysterious letter, a twenty-six-year-old Naho has a mission for her. How did a letter get to her from herself ten years in the future? She doesn’t believe it at first, but as one thing after another begins to unravel exactly as her letter states, Naho is sold. So, Naho soon decides that she will do everything in her power to fulfill this request from her future self: to save her friend, the guy she loves, and to erase all future regrets that accumulate from doing nothing and letting him disappear.\n\nThe story is much more than it seems. How does Kakeru disappear and why? Why can’t Naho invite him to hang out after school the day they meet? Soon, Naho stops asking questions and starts taking action. It’s the only way to change the future.\n\nThe story progresses remarkably, and we see what is happening on all sides of the story in perfect doses, so the story is told in the best way possible. Nothing feels rushed and nothing drags on. Something I have noticed in a lot of Shoujo I have watched or read lately is that it can be easy for a romantic story to either become incredibly predictable or painfully slow-paced. Orange is neither. I would rank it as my favorite Shoujo by far.\n\nTakano is a master storyteller and I hope to be able to write something as captivating as this story one day. The characters are so dynamic and multidimensional that you find yourself among their group of friends as they struggle through life’s challenges and as Naho strives to save the love of her life (whether or not she realizes that he is in fact the love of her life).\n\nIf you want to feel punches to the heart through manga storytelling, this series is for you.

The story of the heroic Katniss and the other characters will make the curtain finally come down. Three books (and four movies) will now be history.\n\nBut you must do your homework and come prepared. Otherwise, you might be confused without a background of the recent movies. This one gets right into the thick of it with no easing into the current status of the story. So if you need a refresher course:\n\nThe Capitol is evil and bad, and it controls 12 Districts. They force an annual ‘Hunger Games’ that pits kids and teens against each other to the death. In a rebellion against the Capitol, the people rise up and are led by Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence).\n\nThe Capitol dictator President Snow (Donald Sutherland) had planned to have Katniss die in the games. Her friend Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) was kidnapped and brainwashed, but is now freed. Along with Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss will lead the rebellion.\n\nKatniss goes into a battle within the Capitol. Peeta and Gale are joined with other past winners in the Games, such as Finnick (Sam Claflin). Others are helping them from back in District 13, such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), Effie (Elizabeth Banks), Johanna (Jena Malone), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman).\n\nPresident Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) runs the rebel Districts, with an eye to elevating herself to the top. Coin seems willing to permit anything to occur so that she will replace the evil Snow. But her methods might be just as bad, or maybe worse. Katniss finds that out too late. “Meet the new Boss, same as the old Boss”…\n\nThe rebel group fights down the streets of the Capitol, and sometimes below the streets. They are attacked by Snow’s henchmen and soldiers, but also by some genetic mutant sewer monsters. Many in the group are killed.\n\nDocumenting the activity is Cressida (Natalie Dormer), with her camera crew. And when it seems that that the group has been killed, the Capitol announcer Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) is broadcast on every screen to show the ‘victory’.\n\nThe ongoing love interest conflict comes back, as Katniss has to decide if she will be with Gale or Peeta. But her first goal is to reach Snow’s mansion, find him there and kill him. The group gets up near the fortified area, but there is an event that turns even the Capitol population against Snow. Only later does Katniss find out the truth, and she knows what happened to her younger sister.\n\nLike a baseball game that goes into extra innings, the whole series of Hunger Games movies are sometimes long and drawn out, and at other times packed with action. This latest movie does the same things, with a few stretches that are a little tedious and other times that crackle with excitement. The large number of characters make it very difficult to have any real character development, other than Katniss.\n\nThe death of Philip Seymour Hoffman while the filming was happening make it sad to see the way that his character gets short-changed. With such a great acting talent in the movie, he could have elevated the plot even more. There are other fine actors, such as Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, Julianne Moore, Stanley Tucci. But they get very little screen time to make big difference.\n\nJennifer Lawrence as Katniss nails the role (for the fourth time). She takes the role and make it very belivable. The other male leads (Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth) do an OK job, but those characters are not as strong as Katniss. The love triangle of Katniss, Peeta and Gale is finally resolved, but the time taken by that could be best spent doing more for each of the characters.\n\nSo, get your ticket and get in the line and “May the odds be ever in your favor”.\n\nLength 137 minutes\n\nRated PG-13\n\nMOVIE REVIEW: SPOTLIGHT\n\nDirected by: Tom McCarthy\n\nWritten by: Tom McCarthy, Josh Singer\n\nStarring: Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Brian D’arcy James, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery, Billy Crudup\n\nThe Boston Globe has a special team of investigative reporters who cover a topic in depth and do intense research for an exclusive story. This is the ‘Spotlight’ team, and in 2002, they broke a story that rocked the Boston area, the Catholic Church specifically, and had an impact around the world. This movie is about that story.\n\nSpotlight is lead by Robby Robertson (Michael Keaton) and has very motivated journalists in Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sasha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian D’arcy James). The managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery) lets the team do what they need to do, because they get results.\n\nAfter a merger, a new publisher comes in named Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). He knows that the Spotlight team could be better served if they take on a relatively minor story about a priest who was arrested for child abuse. How long as this been going on, and how wide spread could this be? His questions have never been asked before, because the Catholic Church is a powerful institution.\n\nThe team hears that if there are any abuse cases, they are settled out-of-court and there are no records. But a local lawyer is heading up and effort on behalf of more than 80 victims. Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the lawyer who is reluctant to give any time to Mike Rezendes. He tells him the records are all there, if he knows where to look.\n\nThere is a local leader of an abuse survivor group named Saviano (Neal Huff), and he has great information and contacts. But he also has an agenda for revenge, and seems to be somewhat unstable. But Sasha Pfeiffer gets in contact with many past victims and hears the sad stories.\n\nMatt Carroll does some investigation and locates many old copies of church directories. His research finds that they have some odd patterns of priest reassignment after there is a possible abuse situation. The team takes all of this information and determines that there might be a much wider problem. They cannot yet prove what has happened, however there is a significant chance that the Bishop knew about it.\n\nThey question a lawyer named Macleish (Billy Crudup) who does side work for the Church, and he cannot say anything. But he claims to have sent information to the Globe years ago, and nobody acted on it back then. So why should he stick his neck out now?\n\nBut the Spotlight team keeps on the story, even when 9/11 happens and the efforts need to be put i"
