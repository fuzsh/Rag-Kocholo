        "text": "What's happening with them sausages, Charlie?\n\nThe follow-up to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels from writer/director Guy Richie pretty much cemented his filmic style of fast paced, quick cutting visuals and a pop-music laden soundtrack with London gangster lingo, and can be traced through all his films, with the probable exception of the Aladdin live action remake.\n\nSnatch, released just 2 years after Lock, Stock’, is near identical in structure, style, cast and crew, but that is no bad thing because it is shot through with the same dark humour, visuals and mean streak that allowed Lock’ to flourish. Richie skilfully balances the humour and violence (much of which actually takes place off screen) by bringing out the nuances of the characters, each of which get a decent amount of time to develop, allowing that all important empathy from the audience so that no matter where the story goes, there is an investment.\n\nAnd the story goes everywhere and into some very dark places.\n\nThe blending of narrative threads that crisscross throughout the runtime allow a solid structure to develop, and bringing the whole full circle provides a satisfactory symmetry with each getting their resolution. It, perhaps, doesn’t quite have the freshness of Lock, nor the outlandishness of RocknRolla, but nevertheless remains eminently watchable thanks to the energy contained therein.\n\nAnd now, an aside. I first met Vinnie Jones in 1987, I’d just started working in the motor trade (my first real job) and the firm I worked for sponsored Wimbledon FC at Plough Lane; being sponsors we were given plenty of match day tickets and access to the director/players bar. Vinnie was a real hoot of a man, loved to chat, laugh and play on his bad-boy persona, he was mean on the pitch, never gave an inch, never showed weakness, always on the attack, but in the bar he was almost gentle, not to say he wasn't a hard man, he was (he'd always say \"never show you're hurt, even if they break you leg, get up and give some back\"). After the historic FA cup win against Liverpool in 1988 (what a day that was!) his fame rocketed, he never lost sight of the man he was, but his aspirations became more than a footballer, he had an eye towards the future because he knew he was a limited player and his style was fast going out of fashion. Like many of the ’88 squad, he went into presenting (videos in his case) and it was through that that he found fame and fortune in the movie business. Never fails to amuse me that, Vinnie, who wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box (relied heavily on accountants for money, and never knew which car he was driving), was savvy enough to capitalise on a public persona and made it big in showbusiness.\n\nSnatch was shot on 35mm film using Moviecam Compact cameras; a 4K scan and clean up from Sony has produced a 4K DI from which this UHD is sourced.\n\nThe disc presents a native 3840 x 2160p resolution image with widescreen 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and uses 10-bit video depth, High Dynamic Range, a Wide Colour Gamut (WCG) and is encoded using the HEVC (H.265) codec for HRD10.\n\nWe reviewed the Region free UK Ultra HD Blu-ray release of Snatch on a Panasonic TX-65HZ1000B Ultra HD 4K TV with a Panasonic DP-UB450 Dolby Vision HDR10+ 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player.\n\nDiamond\n\nThe native 4K image is well detailed with terrific frame depth adding real impact to the picture. Close ups show stunning skin texture, with pores, defects and hair lines being very well defined, likewise, clothing has discernible weaves, from suit lines to overcoat pockets. Check out the set dressings: posters, cards, notes are all perfectly readable, and the sharpness of the various jewels on display or the keenness of tattoos impresses.\n\nHDR and the WCG give a strong depth to colours; the style of the picture tends towards the green, and this is held firm, while flesh tones are natural, and reds have a distinct verve; check out the explosions or fire for some real intensity.\n\nBlack level is wonderfully deep with great shadow detail adding amazing frame depth, allowing the white scale to really push the image out. The sparkle of the diamond, the glint in eyes, the crispness of lights or sweat on a brow; terrific stuff.\n\nThere are no compression issues and the original source is as clean as a whistle, with a natural light sheen of grain to give that filmic nature."
