        "text": "Name: Frank Gould\n\nClass: Advanced Film Program – Art of Cinematography\n\nDate: 29 April 2011\n\nAssignment: Review The Lives of Others Movie\n\nTitle: Apples, Oranges, Oscars, and Golden Globes\n\nFrom the first frames of this movie, the audience is presented with a harsh reality of Soviet East Germany as the smooth camera dollies down a long and empty hallway where the painted walls have a line approximately as high as a human’s neck. As an officer escorts his prisoner down this hall, it appears as if they are both trying to keep their heads above this artificial paint line, metaphorically above water.\n\nThis same theme is repeated in most of the Stasi headquarter scenes showing a highly institutionalized 1960s appearance. The camera dollies left to right to show a classroom of students being lectured about how to interrogate a suspect into confession; the colors are grays, browns, and greens.\n\nThis is in stark contrast with the artist’s flat that appears warm and inviting.\n\nLater in the story, the lead character sets up his surveillance room above the artist’s apartment and the camera move around him slow and methodically in the scene where he hears a song played on a piano by the resident below. This scene shows us how moved he is by moving a long way but keeping him center frame with all the high tech surveillance equipment surrounding him in a set that looks like a cave.\n\nAt this same point in the movie, there are many scene where he is standing or looking at things in the artist’s apartment showing a wide shot and all the set decorations that tell the audience about the artists he is watching and recording. I believe these shots also tell the audience that he is changing and becoming more appreciative of the artists and their lifestyle.\n\nI chose this movie for this class review because it generated a heated discussion between a few students after watching it. Carlos Escobar and Bobby Arnold were not impressed with this movie where Alex Bright thought it was a great movie. Alex contended that Carlos didn’t like the movie because he couldn’t relate to it and that those of us alive during the cold war could. Carlos replied that he wasn’t born when the holocaust occurred but he liked Schindler’s List. The reason we watched this movie was to learn why this movie won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film over Pan’s Labyrinth. Bobby said he was not impressed with either movie. It was at this point our instructor reminded the students that art is like comparing apples and oranges. Some prefer one over the other. In this case, we watched a fantasy film to compare with a fictional documentary-type movie.\n\nI was impressed with and liked both movies. Both are basically the same arc through the story where the antagonists try to oppress and control the artistic. The difference is that the antagonist in Pan’s Labyrinth is obsessed with his future offspring and legacy where in The Lives of Others, the antagonist is obsessed with the female life-partner of a successful East German playwright. Another significant difference is in the production. Pan’s Labyrinth is a very complicated fantasy world with mythical creatures and worlds beyond reality. The Lives of Others is a very realistic portrayal of communist controlled East Germany and how its citizens try to enjoy life in an oppressed culture. The story cleverly unfolds the change in that culture back to freedom when the Berlin wall is torn down. This is the irony because we learn in the beginning that the antagonist believes “people do no change!”\n\nThe protagonist in The Lives of Others is a Stasi officer named Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) who is assigned the task of monitoring playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his lover Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a successful East German actress. Wiesler’s commanding officer assigns this task to him in the attempt to break the two lovers apart for the commanding officer, higher in command. In the “rule of three” trilogy, Wiesler turns out to be the third apex between the lovers and the Stasi commanders. As he listens to the lives of the lovers, Wiesler indeed changes as the plot develops. We learn that Wiesler lives alone in a sterile apartment and exists only to serve the State by spying, interrogating, and torturing citizens into submission and obtain confessions for the State.\n\nDuring a celebration party for Georg, he confronts the Stasi high commander about his director friend, Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) who has been blacklisted by the Stasi commanders and will never be able to work again. Then later during Georg’s birthday party Jerska gives Georg a gift of piano sheet music for Die Sonate vom Guten Menschen (The Sonata of the Good People) which becomes another trilogy in the plot. Georg attempts to convince the commander to remove Jerska from the blacklist but is too late because Jerska commits suicide and gives Georg a reason to protest the State oppression. Because the office of statistics stopped recording and reporting suicides (instead, calling them “self-murderers”), Georg decides to write an article for a West German newspaper to expose this travesty.\n\nAct Two is where we watch Wiesler manipulate the lives of the underground protestors and attempts to setup a sting operation. However, the sonata that Georg plays on the piano changes Wiesler to where he realizes his life is void but the lover’s lives are full of close friends and art. Wiesler is so moved by the piano piece he hears over his surveillance headphones that a tear runs down his face while Georg plays it on the piano. He then starts lying about the lovers in his reports to the commander and then has to balance the story between the commanders and the lovers. Eventually, Wiesler loses his job because Christa commits suicide outside her apartment believing she will be incarcerated for treason.\n\nAct Three is where the trilogy resolves as the East is freed, the high commander loses his job, and Georg learns that his apartment had been wired from the beginning. He then writes a book with the title of the sonata and dedicates it to Wiesler, in appreciation for what he had tried to do to save the lovers. The sonata plays a significant role in the movie and as a trilogy from when Georg first receives it from his friend before committing suicide (#1 – swan song) and when playing it, Wiesler changes his allegiance (#2), and finally at the end when Georg dedicates it to Wiesler (#3).\n\nAs for the Oscar win over Pan’s Labyrinth, I believe that the story resonated more with the voters for The Lives of Others in that it is more realistic to human suffering and how art changes the world to be a better place. Pan’s Labyrinth is definitely an entertaining and beautifully executed story but it lacks in its connection to specific life experiences. As for Bobby’s opinion of the two, he didn’t like fantasy stories and expected more action in The Lives of Others. He, obviously, prefers pears. I also found it interesting that both movies were nominated by the Golden Globe committee for Best Foreign Film but lost to Letters from Iwo Jima, a film directed by Clint Eastwood – ironically not a foreigner. Regardless, The Lives of Others won an Oscar and had 61 wins & 21 nominations, Pans’ Labyrinth won 3 Oscars and had 68 wins & 58 nominations, and Letters from Iwo Jima won an Oscar and had 16 wins & 15 nominations.\n\nFilm: Blade Runner (1982)\n\nDirector: Scott Ridley\n\nProducer: Michael Deeley\n\nScreenwriters: Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples\n\nCinematographer: Jordan Cronenweth\n\nEditor: Terry Rawlings\n\nPrincipal Actors: Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos\n\nSpoiler Alert: This page includes a synopsis that describes most of the plot. If you have not seen this movie, you might want to do so before reading this post. Otherwise, feel free to read it and watch it later for any feedback you might want to offer.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThis movie takes place in the future and mostly at night. It starts by introducing the audience to the city of Los Angeles in 2019 with its vast spans of lights, blasts of flames, and flying transportation vehicles. After these establishing shots and an attempted murder scene, the camera floats down from above into street crowds and ends on the protagonist Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). The police enlist him to terminate four Replicants – genetically manufactured human androids – that have escaped and are trying to invade Tyrell Corporation. To locate the Replicants, Deckard becomes a detective and sleuths his way to the first who he brutally shoots in the back as she runs through panes of glass to her death. At this point, the voice over informs the audience that Deckard is starting to have feelings for the Replicants. This is a turning point and somewhat of a controversy about Deckard himself being a Replicant.\n\nThis is supported by juxtaposing the scene immediately after the first termination of Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) where Deckard sees beautiful Rachael (Sean Young), a Replicant, across the street. Shortly thereafter, she rescues him from another Replicant by killing his assailant. By this time, Roy (Rutger Hauer) and Pris (Daryl Hannah) – the last two remaining run-away Replicants – have nested with a path to the genius at the Tyrell corporation that might help them extend their lives. Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) is the genius who created the Replicants; JF Sebastian (William Sanderson) is the path to the genius. At the turning point where Roy confronts Tyrell for a fix to his short life, Tyrell tells Roy that “the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long;” Roy has done a lot in life but it cannot be lengthen. Then Roy kills his creator.\n\nDeckard catches up with the action by finding and killing Pris. Roy returns to where Pris has been killed and finds Deckard where they battle each other through several rooms. This final battle climaxes in a savior scene where Roy “sees the light” and saves Deckard’s life. In the voice-over, the narration says, “I don’t know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life, anybody’s life, my life” (Trussel). Roy had learned that Deckard had a life to live although his own was gone. Deckard returns to Rachael and they leave Los Angeles to live out in the wilderness.\n\nOne important point to note is that there are several versions of this film. For this essay, I have chosen to use the US theatrical release (1982), as provided in the Four-Disc Collector’s Edition DVD package (2007). This version includes the Deckard voice-over narration and “happy ending” scene and does not include the unicorn dream scene. The happy ending scene occurs after Deckard returns from being saved by Roy. The following sections attempt to describe how this is very effective as a quality movie, even though subsequent releases improved on this quality.\n\nMise-En-Scène/Lighting\n\nIn general, the interior shots are very monochromatic and the exterior shots typically have strong colorful lighting created from advertisements and neon signs. In a majority of the exterior scenes, the sky is dark, rain falls constantly, and the streets are crowded with people. In the interior scenes, there are large, medium, and small rooms; all rooms show strong lights shining through the internal air or flickering on the walls. The large rooms belong to the police, Tyrell, and Sebastian; the medium to Deckard; and the small to Replicants. External medium and close-up shots use high lighting with contrasting dark to create a three dimensional environment. Because of the dominant dark colors and shadows, this alone could be sufficient to classify the movie as film noir; however, it also fits this genre as a detective story using a narrator with honky-tonk piano and haunting sax solos. These are all similar to the film noir classics like the Maltese Falcon (1941). As the Film Noir Studies website says, “the people who made these films set out to create on the motion picture screen a different kind of world, and to provide it with a darker, more cynical interpretation” (Blaser). Ridley Scott accomplished this in a world of the future.\n\nRidley also enhanced this style by using extreme lighting techniques, such as silhouettes of characters in bright-lit backgrounds, unexplained flickering lights, and black-framed cameo shots. For instance, in the first termination scene, the Replicant lies dead on the floor lit by bright lights and neon while people continue to walk across the screen in silhouette showing the scene as immaterial to the characters on the street. In Tyrell’s office/home, there are light patterns flickering on the walls behind the characters but there’s no fireplace or other source for those lights. And when the filmmaker wants to show Deckard alone and longing, we see his face surrounded by darkness, as illustrated below.\n\nAnother technique Scott used is the wide-angle lens to show large spaces where the characters live. In the picture below, the audience can see the curvature of the lens in the doorways with Sebastian and Pris entering his apartment in the Bradbury Building. This shot shows the audience that he lives in a large dry part of the building after walking through the lobby dripping with water and littered with trash.\n\nAnother important point that Sammon’s book points out is that Ridley Scott used “layering” to create the environments on the sets. “Scott’s self-described techniques of building up a dense, kaleidoscopic accretion of detail within every frame and set of a film” (47). Scott told the author, “a film is like a seven-hundred-layer layer cake” (47). This clearly gives the image depth a realistic appearance and one that audiences believe is the future. In the photo above, these layers are shown in the right side door opening where Sebastian has collected hundreds of toys and genetically modified creatures.\n\n1982 Mistake: The scene where Deckard dreams of the unicorn is not in this version. Because of this, there is no meaning in the end where Gaff leaves a unicorn origami at Deckard’s front door. The dream is to help prove that Deckard is a Replicant and that his dreams were implanted, something Gaff knew that Deckard didn’t.\n\nMovement\n\nCamera movements were diverse throughout the film and caused additional complexities to shooting the film because of the special effects. For instance, in the scene where the police flying vehicle is returning to the precinct building, the camera rotates clockwise on the miniature model while the flying vehicle, a Spinner, also turns as it lands on the top of the precinct building. This is created using miniature models and multiple motorized and synchronized camera exposures to create the final lifelike composition. This perspective gives the audience a feel of how it would be like flying in a Spinner and closer to the story.\n\nIn addition to these special effects shots, like the picture above, the camera movement is used to take the audience into several scenes as if they were there, in the story:\n\nThe camera tilts down from the Union Station police precinct building in a long shot, down through the roof of a room, and stops inside a police walled office, as if the audience is sitting next to Officer Bryant.\n\nA dolly used to pan across the Bradbury Building pointing down from an upper floor as Deckard enters the lobby on the first floor.\n\nCamera pans Deckard as he nears Sebastian’s apartment then dollies closer to his back. When he hears a noise off camera, he turns quickly back looking just off the right side of the camera. This appears to pull the audience closer into the scene with Deckard.\n\nAfter Roy breaks Deckard’s littlest two fingers on his shooting arm, the camera shoots hand held and wobbles like an injured person illustrating his pain. It then gets cloudy like his vision is getting worse.\n\nCamera tracks Roy running up to jump between two buildings then cuts to below shot, over the shoulder of Deckard as Roy lands on the building above him, all in quick edits.\n\nOne nice touch of camera work is the use of slow motion when Zhora, the first Replicant, is killed. It is a classical scene of adding aesthetic as Guinnetti says Sam Peckinpah used in his movie The Wild Bunch, “By aestheticizing these scenes of ugliness, Peckinpah demonstrates why the men are so addicted to a life of violence when it seems so profitless.” In this case, Ridley uses the narrative to tell how Deckard has grown to question the genocidal killing, shooting a woman in the back, and his growing feelings for Rachael.\n\nEditing\n\nThis movie uses elements from both Classical and Continuity editing. From the opening scenes of the cityscape vista, the camera closes in tighter and tighter until it lands in the office of the police interrogation. Thereby closing in from a broad perspective that ends up macro lens on the character’s eyeballs before a climax, this is a classical form of editing. Continuity editing occurs during sections of the film where the characters travel on the ground: Walking from the Spinner to the police office, Roy going to and returning from Tyrell’s office/home, and Deckard climbing the stairs to Sebastian’s apartment.\n\nOne of the interesting scenes in the movie is at a bar after a verbal confrontation with a mobster, who apparently owns the “joint,” Deckard is shown waiting during a thematic montage in the bar. During this montage, a lyrical passage of music and an announcer off camera play as we see audience members, performers, Deckard reading a newspaper, then finally the Replicant that Deckard is seeking. It is also in this scene where Deckard gives us an associational response to what he’s watching during the show. He turns away from the stage and covers his eyes from the show. Although this is a great acting device, it kept the camera from showing any of the performances but gave the audience the idea that it was not something they would want to see, and without showing it.\n\nAs for the editing style fitting the Soviet Montage (Formalist Theory) or Bazin’s Tradition of Realism, I believe it more closely fits the Soviet Montage because of the juxtaposition of the city from above into close-up shots of the characters and their activities. Throughout the movie there are dialectical synthesis and conflicts between the characters, their environment, and their desires. For instance, the creature seeks its creator to change the way it was created and live longer. This same conflict is inside humans who wish to extend their lives. When told it can’t be changed, Roy kills the creator. As this scene unfolds, the edits start with a long shot then slowly tighten in on the final kill close-up.\n\n1982 Mistake: The scene where Roy enters the movie has a shot of Roy’s hand curled up in what appears to be pain. The edit is too long and reveals in a flash behind the hand that there is a nail protruding out the backside of his hand. This scene was obviously shot for later in the movie after Roy punches a nail through his hand to keep his hand functional.\n\nSound/Music\n\nThe sound and music are the final sensual stimulation of the whole movie. In addition to the strong key and flickering lights, the sounds of machinery and other high-tech audio sounds continuously play in the background to remind the audience this is a future world. Some of these high-tech audio sounds are common sounds used today, such as telephone audio signals, radio frequency squeals, and synthesized sounds. One particularly eerie sound plays in the background of the shot below that sounds like a synthesized cat growl, giving the audience an insight into how dangerous Pris is.\n\nA Greek musician named Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou created the musical score, using his artist name Vangelis. This score completes the masterpiece Ridley Scott sought to create. As Sammon says in his book, the score is “a dizzying mélange of unabashed romanticism, ominous electronic rumblings, gutter-level blues, delicate celestial shadings, and heartbreaking melancholy” (273). Sammon continues to describe Vangelis’s working methods as having “closely mirrored Ridley Scott’s own technique of ‘layering.’ The musician would first improvise the basic melody of each track, lay down that melody onto magnetic tape, and then refine it by piling other sounds and/or textures on top [of] the foundation track, working and reworking the resulting mass of music much like the way a sculptor kneads a lump of clay” (274).\n\n1982 Mistake: The audio track is out of sync in the scene with Deckard and the snake salesman. Lips move but no audio talk and there’s talking without lips moving.\n\nActing\n\nIn another quality of this masterpiece film, the casting was perfect. Each actor fit the role as no other actor could fit. From Rachael’s gorgeous face and expressions to Harrison Ford’s Deckard stunning acting, these professionals made the audience believe in them as if they were real. In addition, Rutger Hauer delivered several classical lines that were brilliant, such as “if only you could see what I’ve seen with your eyes” and “all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain.”\n\nHarrison Ford performs his diverse characters in the bar scene where he twitches his nose and snarls at the bar mobster. Then he proceeds to watch a show on stage and off camera but turns in disgust and hides his eyes from what he’d seen. When he finally gets to see Zhora in her dressing room, he plays a dorky agent and stutters when talking about lewd or repulsive acts to the naked beauty. Blade Runner was released following Harrison Ford’s star performances in Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark and firmly established in the American Star System. However, these roles had given him public exposure but as Sammon writes, the “producer and director were in unanimous agreement that Ford had thus far been given ample public exposure as a personality, but little opportunity to showcase his true talents as an actor” (88). I believe he proved his lead talents and persona in this film.\n\nArt Direction: Sets & Costumes\n\nSet Analysis\n\nThe art direction in this movie was spectacular and very realistic. Buildings were modeled based on historic architecture, such as Mayan pyramids for the Tyrell office/home (Shay 12) and the Chrysler building in New York for the Police Precinct Station (Shay 43). They also used existing buildings for internal shots, like the Bradbury Building in Los Angeles for Sebastian’s apartment (Sammon 138) and the Union Station for the Police Precinct Station (Sammon 118).\n\nWhat is most engaging in this movie is the environment and cityscape that the production team created. Using forced-perspective models, the art department was able to create miniature buildings and fly vehicles within them to convince the audience that the scene was real. Andrew Laszlo defines forced perspective photography as “the relative size of something as it is compared to the known size of something else” (207). By creating realistic buildings in the set, the perspective of the other buildings and their details, like stairs or windowsills, “force” the audience to believe the size of the images around it. This was used extensively in the miniature sets where the camera floats and turns revealing the future environment and living conditions.\n\nThe matte paintings were amazing art direction and special effects accomplishments that have won and been nominated for several awards. As Sammon says in his book, “Puddles of painted water shimmer with reflected neon; streams of traffic jockey or position on distant painted causeways; Spinners soar into the frame, only to disappear behind a painted building and emerge again on the other side. None of these things are exactly revolutionary, but the sheer virtuosity with which two- and three-dimensional subjects are blended together represents what is probably the most bravura use of matte paintings in years – perhaps ever” (55). Of course today, this would be much easier and more efficient to use computer graphics and digital images.\n\nIn the photo below, the view out of the window is a rear screen projection into the set and completed using matte painting for the top of the view out of the window. In addition, the furniture and setting contains museum quality pieces to show the rich life of Dr. Tyrell.\n\nDeckard’s apartment external and internal shots were also created using existing buildings and design. The outside of his apartment building is the Frank Lloyd Wright house in Los Angeles. As Ridley Scott said, “Decker’s apartment was great. It was Frank Lloyd Wright’s house exterior. Couldn’t shoot inside the house so Larry took casting of the walls” and made them into the walls inside Deckard’s apartment (22:10 minute mark, “A Good Start: Designing the Future” Chapter). The picture below shows the interior of Deckard’s apartment and the walls cast from the outside of Frank Lloyd Wright’s house.\n\nCostume Analysis\n\nThe costumes in this movie are very well designed and are believable as much today as back when the film was first released. I would consider the period infinite because it fits the story well. Class is differentiated between the impoverished who wear rags and the high class such as Rachael. Her coats have high arching collars that make her appear royal. They appear to be Hollywood outfits, designed by fashion designers. Because she is only a couple years old, she unusually fits snuggly and beautifully in her adult clothes. The fabrics of her clothes are made from cotton and fur that appear to be custom made to fit her tightly and to accentuate her body. In one scene she has a high fashion, high-tech purse with a poignant graphic design that nicely and futuristically complements her dress. Rachael and Deckard wear earth toned colored clothes of tan, green, grey, dark blue, black, and white.\n\nDeckard wears three shirts in this movie two being dark colored button down with a thin tie and the third in the glib happy ending where he appears to be wearing a polo shirt under a sweater. As Sammon states, “even a futuristic detective must have a trench coat, of course. According to the 1982 Blade Runner press kit, Rick Deckard’s outerwear consisted of ‘a new, oddly proportioned version of the traditional trench coat…a russet colored full-length cotton, with multi-pintuck collar, raglan sleeves, deep pockets, and French seams’” (112). He carries a futuristic terminator gun in a holster over his left buttock. Don Shay quotes Douglas Trumbull, Special Photographic Effects Supervisor, as saying, “Ridley wanted to have an unusual, futuristic gun…Why not make something that’s black? Instead of making light come out of the gun, make darkness come out. And rather than make things explode, have them implode – collapse – as though matter just vaporized and vanished into a void. It wouldn’t throw blood and gore all over the place – part of him would just vanish” (20). This was clearly shown in the Leon head blast scene after his battle with Deckard where the gunshot leaves a weird hole and residue.\n\nNarrative\n\nThe voice-over narrative in this version of the movie is one weakness in the quality of this version. By using a voice-over narration, it leans the narrative towards the formalistic narrative because “the design of the plot is not concealed but heightened. It’s part of the show. Formalistic plots come in a wide assortment, but usually they are structured according to the filmmaker’s theme,” (384) as Giannetti says. This style fits the film noir genre but in the end Ridley Scott removed all the voice-over because he wanted to have more realistic narrative and conceal some of the plot details.\n\nThe narrative is realistic, as the Giannetti textbook says, “Realists prefer loose, discursive plots, with no clearly defined beginning, middle, or end. We dip into the story at an arbitrary point. Usually we aren’t presented with a clear-cut conflict, as in classical narratives. Rather, the conflict emerges unobtrusively from the unforced events of the exposition. The story itself is presented as a ‘slice of life,’ as a poetic fragment, not a neatly structured tale” (383). The beginning of Blade Runner starts with the first murder in the Tyrell office. It is arbitrary because it is in the middle of the Replicant’s quest to infiltrate the office but the audience doesn’t know why. The Replicants have escaped and are killing people but the police are merely trying to terminate them so “no one’s ever going to find out they’re down here,” as Office Bryant tells Deckard (Trussel). As the Replicants are killed off, the audience learns that they are trying to get changed by their creator to live longer. This conflict is not clear-cut until late in the story.\n\nThe film does follow the classical paradigm as the action climbs to the climax and denouement. Again, the additional footage at the end of this version of the movie exposes another weakness in the narration: glib happy ending. Having exceeded the budget and run past deadlines, the producers wanted a happy ending for Deckard and Rachael. They drive off into the sunset as the camera glides through scenic views of the green surviving world outside dystopia, in stark contrast to the streets in the city. This happy ending is not realistic narrative and was removed to improve the quality of the final cut, released in 1992.\n\nThe film does not follow the classical three-act plot structure because the audience is not informed what the conflict is in the Replicants, just that they need to be stopped. The protagonist knows he’s up against a formidable foe but not why they are attempting to do what they are doing: infiltrate Tyrell corporation. As for the resolution, the last few scenes in the movie shows the audience that the antagonist finally changes and realizes he must stop killing and in fact save the protagonist. By this point, Roy just plays with Deckard as he tries to get away and survive. Roy becomes the savior and rescues Deckard from falling to his death.\n\n1982 Mistake: Deckard gives a voice-over narrative throughout this version of the film. It becomes annoying to the audience as it repeats what’s displayed on the screen instead of leading the story forward. In the Director’s Cut of the film, released in 1992, the narration is removed and is replaced with silence that gives the movie its poetic and lyrical mood.\n\nBox Office and the Long Tail\n\nThis movie was not a financial success when it was first released. As I have listed mistakes above for this 1982 release, it appears audiences didn’t find the movie as a blockbuster; it only grossed “$14 million during its initial theatrical run…it is not exaggerating to describe Blade Runner’s maiden appearance as a resounding financial flop, a situation which, under normal circumstances, would have ended the Blade Runner story right there” (Sammon 318). As Tom Southwall, Production Illustrator, said, “Everybody was expecting a heroic follow-up to Raiders of the Lost Ark or a Starwars and the way it was advertised on television with only the visual effects shots of the flying car over a futuristic city and sort of a fight sequence doesn’t prepare you for the dramatic emotional side that there is in the film. It leaves you sort of broken” (7:30 minute mark, “To Hades and Back: Release and Resurrection” Chapter).\n\nBack during this time, Warner Brothers was rereleasing films into the cable and later VHS markets. As Sammon says on the Dangerous Days DVD, when the audience “could actually manipulate the film just as Deckard manipulates the photograph, then they recognized what an accomplishment it was and then the buzz started to gather” (16:42 minute mark, “To Hades and Back: Release and Resurrection” Chapter). These releases grew a cult of followers by an audience that would not have necessarily watched a science fiction film in a theatre (Sammon 322). Afterward a few years, the film became a hit for small theatres and festivals. This grew slowly over the years until Warner Brothers got involved in expanding the theatre screenings that generated hundreds of thousands of dollars, with little marketing expenses (Sammon 340).\n\nAfter a few years of negotiations, a second release in 1992, called the Blade Runner Director’s Cut, received a lot of press about both the new release edits and about inside stories from the first release. This reinvigorated audiences to go see it again. According to Sammon, “By Mid-October, the Director’s Cut was screening in ninety-five theatres, and the film hovered within the top-fifty grossing motion pictures in the United States for a ten-week period…[it] was then booked for screenings throughout Europe, Japan, and Australia, where it met with similar success” (368). Chris Anderson writes of the difficulties for getting films, much less a re-released film, into theatres in his book when he says, “The ‘carrying capacity’ of the U.S. theatrical industry is only about 100 films a year. The economics of local movie theaters are cruel and unforgiving. It’s not enough that a film be good or big in Bombay. It’s got to be big enough in Stamford, Connecticut, or wherever else a theater happens to be, to pull more than a couple thousand people through the door over a two-week run” (128).\n\nObviously the Blade Runner movie gained an audience of aficionados that were able to revive and propel it back into the global culture. For a masterpiece and cultural icon, Blade Runner will continue to have a long tail in the market, as it was again released on DVD and Blu-ray and in four different editions in 2007. It has since been included in the American Film Institute’s in the 2007 edition of the document as 97th out of 100. In June 2008, the AFI awarded Blade Runner the number 6 slot in the top 10 Sci-Fi genre. “To pay homage to the 10 revered genres, AFI enlisted film artists associated with each category to count down the top films, while providing their unique insight on each” (1). The letter continues, “’AFI’s 10 TOP 10 will serve as the ultimate guide to the very best in 10 of America’s most beloved film genres,’ said AFI President and CEO Bob Gazzale” (2).\n\nBibliography\n\nAmerican Film Institute, 100 Years 100 Movies, 2007, pdf.\n\nAmerican Film Institute, AFI’s 10 Top 10 – Host Announcement, 2008, pdf.\n\nAnderson, Chris.

This is only my editorial opinion and describes my “professional” evaluation. I suggest you watch the movie by renting it, like at a nearby Redbox, or borrowing a copy from your local library. Ignore the Redbox review comments about it being SLOW. They’re right, but it’s worth being patient.\n\nHere I am again being a movie critic. This time it’s called Mud, an indie movie with celebrity actors like Reese Witherspoon, Matthew McConaughey, Sam Shepard, and Joe Don Baker. The cast did a great job and the story was very interesting. Although I don’t like today’s movies that take forever to get through the storyline because of all the artistic b-roll footage and the way too long dead air time between lines, I was able to make it to the end. My partner, Troy, was just about to abort it when the story twists and complications kept him connected.\n\nEssentially what happens is Mud, Matthew McConaughey, ends up on an island waiting for his girl friend, Reese Witherspoon. We don’t know how long it’s been but he’s adapted to being away from people on the deserted island in Arkansas on a Mississippi River tributary. Also, he somehow gets enough cigarettes to smoke throughout the movie (which is why I’m glad we wait for these smoker movies that over charge my nicotine withdrawal nerves when I’m stuck in a theater). Maybe he just smokes when the cameras are around?\n\nHow we meet Mud is through two young boys, who are maybe 10 or 11 years old – although Ellis, Tye Sheridan, says he’s 14 to a girl who looks like she’s 14. These two boys venture out to the island because of a rumored old boat stuck up in a tree caused by flooding. This is an interesting prop that comes to life over the course of the story. Maybe there was a little too much worshipping it; however, it kept the story interesting by watching their repair progress. The boys go into the boat and find fresh food and a shoe print on the wall. So, they know someone is there.\n\nBecause they’re on a tight schedule to get back in 15 minutes, they head back to the boat to depart but Ellis, the boat’s owner’s son who saw the shoe print on the wall, sees that same shoe print in the sand around the boat. Regardless of the time, he takes off and follows the footprints going down the shore away from the boat. Then they end.\n\nAfter they turn around, Mud is standing next to the boat fishing, miraculously appearing from nowhere. This is a repeating plot device that makes him appear magical or miraculous. This is where we learn some of his back-story and relationship with his girlfriend, Juniper.\n\nLater that day, Ellis and his friend, Neckbone (yeah, humorous name), Jacob Lofland, find a “new woman in town” going into the neighborhood Piggly Wiggly grocery store. Ellis is determined to investigate this woman and does so by confirming she has a Nightingale tattooed on her hand, just like Mud told the boys.\n\nAt this point, the story is about two primary arcs, one on the island and one in Juniper’s hotel room. The boys have become the middlemen between the lovers and they visit the island on a regular basis. After Mud reveals why he’s running from the law, he also informs the boys that there’s a mafia boss’s son that he killed.\n\nThis was an appealing plot line where Ellis has to decide the right versus the wrong things to do. His faith in Mud is strong and at the same time his pugnacious behavior grows stronger. Mud makes a deal with them if they help him get away by rebuilding the boat, Neckbone gets a gun and Ellis gets his mojo. Ellis gets the short end of the deal because he’s doing it for love and romantic ideals.\n\nSince Mud told the boys about growing up in the same area and knows the same people living there, the boys decide to help him. Ellis learns that the law is searching for Mud but Ellis says he has not seen him when confronted by anyone. Mud also tells the boys that a cottonmouth snake bit him when he was young and Juniper saved his life, miraculously.\n\nThis is where I get somewhat confused with the age. The two young men did an outstanding performance, in my humble opinion. At first I thought they were a little too casual but as the story progressed, they went through some very difficult actions, like trick bike riding, fist fights, and walking for miles, or so it seemed. They did a great job in all of their scenes.\n\nBut what confused me was the age they portray being interested enough in women to start a fight with a senior schoolmate seemed a stretch. Instead of realizing he’s too young for his one truelove, he punches out yet another of the girl’s suitors, again his senior. His testosterones must be in over-drive. I can only imagine what he’s doing when he’s alone.\n\nWhen the boys find where Juniper is in the hotel by selling fish door-to-door, they also meet the brother of the guy Mud killed and he means business by beating and threatening her in front of the boys. The guy asks if they know her and they lie by saying they were just selling fish and happened to hear the ruckus.\n\nNow we’ve almost met everyone, except for the dead son’s father, the kingpin, called King, played by Joe Don Baker and an assassin friend of Mud, Tom Blankenship, Sam Shepard, who we learn raised Mud, an orphan like Neckbone. Add to that plotline, Ellis has just learned his parents are separating and he’s going to be half-homeless with one of them.\n\nThis is why this story is so appealing as it is setup with an underdog hero who romantically tries to rescue his lover but she has repeatedly deserted him for other men. This last one he killed because her husband beat her so badly she can’t have children, and he saved her life from the thug by killing him.\n\nNow enter the big guns. King and Tom start down the path to avenge his son and the other to aid his adopted son. King gathers a group of volunteers and marksmen to find Mud and kill him. He holds a religious welcoming of the bounty men to pray they kill Mud. Tom sends cash and supplies to Mud, via the boys.\n\nThe boys are now driving Neckbone’s motorbike around town finding pieces needed to repair the boat. Oh, and the boat has no motor. Oh, and it’s up in a tree.\n\nThis is where things get a little messy for the director. We’ve learned the thugs are watching Juniper so through her they can find and kill Mud; however, Ellis goes to Juniper’s hotel room three times and they never catch or follow Ellis, even though they’re sitting in the parking lot watching her room. I thought any minute they’re coming out of a side pocket to nab him. But, no, Ellis visits Juniper twice to deliver messages from Mud and returns answers.\n\nThe other plot line that has trouble is that these two small boys are hauling heavy equipment that two grown men would have trouble moving. Like the time they steal a 70HP outboard motor from a salvage yard under a small lift in the chain link fence or pulling a 23-foot boat trailer with the motorbike and then a small motor boat. Of course, indie moviegoers probably would just say, “Oh, that’s just a macho guy thing” and ignore the physics, but all they needed were some slightly older actors, at least with more muscles, and maybe a car or pickup truck.\n\nRegardless, it is a fun story to watch these guys find the parts to fix the boat and save the day, along with their escapades along the way. I won’t give the ending because that’s certainly something to experience, unexpectedly. I will say it has a tinge of deus ex machina but it’s totally setup from the beginning and you’re happy it’s there when you need it. I certainly hadn’t expected it.\n\nWhy I even bothered to write this review is that I continued to think about it days after I saw it. It’s the “Huckleberry Finn” on the river coming of age story with corrupt government aggression, misinformation, and firepower. The hero has nowhere to go and his dream is crushed again but he has the fortitude to move on into the unknown future. Oh, and there’s bromance to boot.\n\nThe last issues I have to mention or my evaluation would be incomplete. I’ve listed them below and if anyone has any comments, please add them in the section at the end of this post.\n\nDuring a phone conversation between Juniper and Ellis, her hair changes positions while talking on the phone. It was obviously the splicing of two different takes but it’s obvious as you watch it in one cut where the phone is over the hair and the other cut it’s under the hair. It goes back and forth each cut four times.\n\nIn rural communities, there are (or used to be) a lot of sheet metals. Instead, these boys end up providing Mud with corrugated galvanized sheets of metal to repair the flat side of the boat. Besides looking like someone used a circular saw to make a square opening in the boat, for who knows why, Mud used hot tar to fill the gaps in the corrugated sheet metal against the flat boat siding. It would have been nice if the pan of the boat in the water near the end of the movie showed the opening was above the water line.\n\nThe boat motor does not work so they have to repair it. Well, there’s a small problem with the way they repaired it: Out of the water, on the trailer, and with a battery we never saw. Now those who don’t know boats and maintenance, you must have a water supply going into the casing to cool the engine. This is where my editorial criticism may be too extreme for most moviegoers. All it would take, and I would have suggested it, is put a hose on the motor starting with the first camera shots when they’re repairing it. To me, this is an important credibility prop that proves these guys know what they’re doing. In fact, that is a very important item to authenticate Mud has all this experience and supposedly Neckbone too who built his own motorbike.\n\nI do hope you watch it and enjoy seeing it unfold on screen. It does have a heart in that everyone helps guide Ellis down the right path and not the wrong path. I only want to recommend this movie for when you have a couple hours to dedicate to it. Yet another movie I’d like to edit out 30 minutes to get through the plot quicker."
