Les Demimondes

Les Demimondes examines how fine arts, music, film, photography and the media have profited off the shabby mystique of the whore while whores themselves are criminalized for doing the work itself.The show encourages artists and academics to consider their role in producing work about the sex trade that is more realistic and less of a “saviour.”
