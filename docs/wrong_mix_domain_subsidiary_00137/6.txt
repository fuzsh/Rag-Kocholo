Every month at Good Housekeeping, our shopping experts create a curated list of the best Amazon deals worth adding to your cart, including some trusted products tested in the esteemed Good Housekeeping Institute.

Wondering what to stock your Amazon cart with this February versus what to save for later? Hint: Retailers like Amazon drop prices at the beginning of the year to make room for new 2024 inventory, meaning you can score best-selling products at a fraction of the price — now. And with Presidents' Day sales landing on February 19, steeper-than-usual discounts are trickling out on Apple, Dyson, Samsung, Ninja and beyond.

This month, we spotted big deals on items like electronics and vacuum cleaners to countertop appliances and patio furniture — up to $500 off! Whether you're looking to upgrade your TV, trying to get back on track with New Year's resolutions or seeking a thoughtful Valentine's Day gift, Amazon is fully stocked with deals waiting for you. Plus, the best sales this month include plenty of products tested at the Good Housekeeping Institute.
