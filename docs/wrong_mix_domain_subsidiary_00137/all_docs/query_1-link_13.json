        "text": "I purchased a new SIP fireball 3kw electric fan heater from Toolstation yesterday.\n\nhttp://www.toolstation.com/m/part.html?p=35961\n\nIt does not seem to push out as much heat as I expected when on full. At 3 kw & at over 10,000 BTU this not a small fan heater and am pretty sure a cheap household 2 kw fan heater pushes out more.\n\nMy question is does anyone else use the SIP? Do they find it a bit weak?\n\nIf it just faulty I can return for a replacement. If it just a bad product I will return for a refund.\n\nAlso have read the recent post in this forum about workshop heaters.\n\nheating-a-workshop-with-air-heaters-t85704.html\n\nHowie\n\nHi Silas\n\nIt has a graduated controller. On the lowest setting it is just a fan. The heat comes in as you advance the controller clockwise. On full heat I can hold my hand about 5 to 10 cm away from the grill and feel a slight burn on my flesh. Anything beyond is just a bit of slightly warm air.\n\nIt has quite thick elements which do not change colour at all when heating.\n\nI think it is a dud.\n\nNever been a fan (sorry) of these types of heaters. They take ages to have an effect.\n\nAn interesting experiment might be to take the heater indoors and see how it performs where the ambient temp is higher than your workshop.\n\nAt the end of the day it all comes down to beefing up your insulation and blocking drafts. Otherwise you've just moving cold air around."
