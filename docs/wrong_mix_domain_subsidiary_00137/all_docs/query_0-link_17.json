Turmeric contains curcumin, a flavonoid which supports a healthy immune response, thereby promoting general well-being.\n\nSangram Chaudhary, managing director Mother Dairy said, \"Goodness of haldi is backed by thousand years of Indian roots of Ayurvedic science and is known to strengthen the immune system, providing protection from common day -to-day infections. This would be the first in line among a range of Immunity-boosting products by Mother Dairy.\"\n\nThe company is promoting the new variant on digital platforms using #Rishtonkiimmunity hashtag. It is also running radio ads.\n\nDairy brand Amul has also launched new immunity boosting products such as haldi, tulsi and ginger milk to promote wellness and promoting the products on digital platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, packaged consumer goods firm Dabur India is seen promoting various immunity boosting products such as Tulsi drops, Chyawanprash and Glucose -D on television and digital.\n\nThe firm has also created Immunity Booster kit which includes products such as Chyawanprash, Giloy Ghanvati, Giloy Churna, Stresscom, Imudab Syrup, Honey, Honitus and Honitus hot sip.
