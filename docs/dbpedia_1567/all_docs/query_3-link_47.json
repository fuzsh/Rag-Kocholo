        "text": "This article aims to address the challenges of the Arenawijk of architect Renaat Braem (1910-2001) in Antwerp (BE), a modernist post-war housing project in Flanders. This district is one of the urban settlements in Flanders constructed according to the Congrès Internationaux d'Archi- tecture Moderne (CIAM) principles, but whose initial ambitions have undergone a critical shift in meaning. It has become fragile and vulnerable to mounting conservation costs, with demolition seem- ingly the only way out. The aim of this paper is to compare and confront the Arenawijk with the international discourse on modernist housing at the time in order to gain insight in the heritage values of the site but also as a source for its regeneration. By comparing the statements of the original CIAM congress texts with the implementation in practice, interesting and contradicting elements come to surface; which give interesting insights in relation to its future use or reuse.\n\nThe article examines how the concept of the addressee of architecture has transformed throughout the twentieth century, demonstrating how the mutations of the dominant means of representation in architecture are linked to the evolving significance of the city’s inhabitants. It presents the ways in which the reorientations regarding the dominant modes of representation depend on the transfor-mations of architects’ conceptions of the notion of citizenship. Through the diagnosis of the epistemo-logical debates corresponding to four successive generations – the modernists starting from the 1920s, the post-war era focusing on neorealist architecture and Team 10, the paradigm of autonomy and the reduction of architecture to its syntactics and to its visuality in the 1970s and the reinvention of the notion of the user and the architectural program through the event in the post-autonomy era – it identifies and analyses the mutations concerning the modes of representation that are at the heart of architectural practice and education in each generation under consideration. It traces the shifts from Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s fascination with perspective to Alison and Peter Smith-son’s Cluster City diagrams and Shadrach Woods’s “stem” and “web”, on to Peter Eisenman’s search for logical structures in architectural components’ formal relationships and his attraction to axonometric representation, and finally to the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) and Bernard Tschumi’s concern with uncovering the potentialities hidden in the architectural program.\n\nDiagrams have been as essential in the development of architecture and urban design in the modern era as their definition has been puzzling to architects and theoreticians. Undoubtedly diagrams have been instrumental in propelling the design ideas of High Modernism and have undergone a digital revival at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Yet understanding their conceptual constitution and functioning seems to challenge the traditional epistemology of architecture. On one hand, diagrammatic drawings appear explicitly rational because they tend to operate by distilling design issues and information and have helped architects conceptualize and precisely analyze crowning examples of historical and contemporary buildings. At the same time, however, many diagrams became famous not for their scientific precision but rather because they both hide and advertise assumptions that have motivated design decisions and such tendency is best exemplified by the recent use of parametric techniques in urban planning. To untangle this seeming paradox, this paper will argue that diagrams have been crucial in the recent history of design because they provide a visual way to structure thought, a graphic method of determining what is perceived, what is considered relevant, and what sense is made of the revealed complexity of issues. Moreover, this argument will associate diagramming procedures with the emergence of technologies of thought (as discussed in more detail in Architecture of Thought). Approached in this way, diagramming can be seen as a symptom of a broad spectrum of visual practices that align design with political and economic forces. An outline of how diagramming and its function have evolved shows here how designers have been implicated in the changes triggered by the modern era and late capitalism.\n\nToday we are familiar with definitions of architecture as an integrated, multidisciplinary “networked practice,” which takes its cognitive potential from a “diffused design intelligence.” These definitions were introduced to counter an individual, authorial approach to design which allegedly characterized modern architecture since its beginnings. This thesis aims to overcome such a distinction, showing that, on the contrary, a diffused, collective intelligence was at the core of architectural production since its invention in the 15th century. Renaissance sprezzatura, the monster in Enlightened France, Alois Riegl's Kunstwollen, Aldo Rossi's collective memory and the 1970s debate on architectural language are taken as indexes of a Western tradition of collective intelligence in design. Moreover, this genealogy shows that by embracing “collective intelligence” and “projective” practice architecture does not necessarily surrender to constituted political powers and to the forces of the market. On the contrary, this thesis shows how such a practice can be an instance of a positive and constitutive political force—in other words, able to produce the common.\n\nThis article discusses how CIAM (Congrès Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne) influenced Dutch housing and urban planning. It starts by looking at programs and policies of the 1920s and 1930s Dutch housing design, and the way in which the new ideas of CIAM were there incorporated. In this history, the design of the AUP (Algemeen Uitbreidingsplan Amsterdam, or the General Extension Plan) is crucial, marking the transition into a new spatial model for large scale housing areas. CIAM thinking and its successor, TEAM X, strongly influenced the idea of the social-cultural city before and directly after WWII. This becomes evident in the urban extensions of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. This practice influenced urban planning and housing design and culminated during the 1970s in the design of the Bijlmermeer. Though legendary and still detectable in the urban developments of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, CIAM thinking came forward as both visionary and problematic. This article will trace the CIAM..."
