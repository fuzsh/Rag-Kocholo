But, in addition to the critical consideration of Hurston's writings, her work has received the level of institutional support necessary for Hurston to enter the American literary mainstream. The article addresses the issue of black women literary tradition and the search for freedom and identity in the white American social and cultural environment.\n\nSteve O'Neale 1948-2003\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCharlton, D; Watkins, P\n\nATLAS was shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden death of Steve O'Neale on 25 November 2003. Steve was a valued, even inimitable, member of the Birmingham particle physics group from the early 1970's. In his early career, he worked on a number of bubble chamber experiments, mainly using neutrino beams, and he was computing co-ordinator of the OPAL experiment for many years. For more than ten years Steve was also a member of the core ATLAS computing team at CERN, from where he made an unforgettable impact on the Collaboration. And what an impact, as a personality and colleague, as well as a highly esteemed professional, and not least for many as a dear friend. As a professional he brought to the project his deep knowledge and irreplaceable experience in particle physics software and computing. The computing landscape has changed radically over the period of Steve's activities in this field, and even over his time in ATLAS. It is remarkable how naturally Steve kept pace with these changes. It needed hi...\n\nSteve O'Neale 1948 - 2003\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2003-01-01\n\nColleagues and friends in CERN and beyond regret the sudden death of Steve O'Neale. Steve had a wide-ranging career, which started with studies of neutrino interactions in bubble chambers, where he participated in the CERN and Fermilab programmes. He worked on many aspects of the geometrical reconstruction and fitting software. He also took part in an experiment using a tagged photon beam in a SLAC bubble chamber. A major part of his career was spent in OPAL, where his contributions were exceptional, both in quantity and in quality. He served as an Offline Coordinator for many years, and his mark can be found throughout OPAL's software environment. Hundreds of young scientists owe their starting careers to the care and dedication that Steve spent in the provision of a fully-working computing platform for OPAL. In parallel to his OPAL work, he contributed to Babar, to CERN's central software services, and to ATLAS. On ATLAS, Steve was initially responsible for the SLUG framework, but made his most significa...\n\n\"Different by Degree\": Ella Cara Deloria, Zora Neale Hurston, and Franz Boas Contend with Race and Ethnicity.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHoefel, Roseanne\n\n2001-01-01\n\nAmerican Indian ethnographer and linguist Ella Cara Deloria and African American folklorist and writer Zora Neale Hurston did fieldwork for Franz Boas, the father of modern anthropology.

In general, this article draws on feminism and what looms large in feminism which is called sexism. In particular it focuses on domestic violence as a major sexist oppression. Domestic violence aroused by jealousy, anger, coercion, humiliation, threatening is manifest in verbal and physical abusing of women. Hurston skillfully depicts her heroine's undergoing of domestic violence by her husbands, each in different ways. This article aims to show that how the black heroine's battling with this violence purports to feminism and self-discovery of women.\n\nSymposium on electron linear accelerators in honor of Richard B.

Contrairement Ã dâautres, dont Robert Wright et Alain Locke, Hurston ne renie nullement le legs culturel que reprÃ©sente le folklore noir quâelle apprÃ©cie selon ses propres critÃ¨res, folklore qui influencera tant la forme que le fond de son art. Anthropologue de formation, Hurston apprÃ©hende nÃ©anmoins la culture noire amÃ©ricaine du sud non pas comme un vestige du passÃ© quâil conviendrait de conserver prÃ©cieusement intact, mais comme une partie intÃ©grante du vÃ©cu actuel. Ã travers les stratÃ©gies discursives orales vernaculaires quâelle adopte et adapte de la tradition folklorique afro-amÃ©ricaine, Hurston, en pionniÃ¨re, ouvre une voie et donne une voix aux Ã©crivains Noirs Ã venir.\n\nYear-Round Monitoring of Contaminants in Neal and Rogers Creeks, Hood River Basin, Oregon, 2011-12, and Assessment of Risks to Salmonids.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWhitney B Hapke\n\nFull Text Available Pesticide presence in streams is a potential threat to Endangered Species Act listed salmonids in the Hood River basin, Oregon, a primarily forested and agricultural basin. Two types of passive samplers, polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs, were simultaneously deployed at four sites in the basin during Mar. 2011-Mar. 2012 to measure the presence of pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs. The year-round use of passive samplers is a novel approach and offers several new insights. Currently used pesticides and legacy contaminants, including many chlorinated pesticides and PBDEs, were present throughout the year in the basin's streams. PCBs were not detected. Time-weighted average water concentrations for the 2-month deployment periods were estimated from concentrations of chemicals measured in the passive samplers. Currently used pesticide concentrations peaked during spring and were detected beyond their seasons of expected use. Summed concentrations of legacy contaminants in Neal Creek were highest during July-Sept., the period with the lowest streamflows. Endosulfan was the only pesticide detected in passive samplers at concentrations exceeding Oregon or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency water-quality thresholds. A Sensitive Pesticide Toxicity Index (SPTI was used to estimate the relative acute potential toxicity among sample mixtures. The acute potential toxicity of the detected mixtures was likely greater for invertebrates than for fish and for all samples in Neal Creek compared to Rogers Creek, but the indices appear to be low overall (<0.1. Endosulfans and pyrethroid insecticides were the largest contributors to the SPTIs for both sites. SPTIs of some discrete (grab samples from the basin that were used for comparison exceeded 0.1 when some insecticides (azinphos methyl, chlorpyrifos, malathion were detected at concentrations near or\n\nAn Outline of Interpersonal Trust and Distrust\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPedersen, Esther Oluffa\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe article is part of the dialogue \"Intentional Trust in Uganda\" with anthropologist Lotte Meinert......The article is part of the dialogue \"Intentional Trust in Uganda\" with anthropologist Lotte Meinert...\n\nInfluence of microclimatic conditions under high tunnels on the physiological and productive responses in blueberry 'O'Neal'\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJorge Retamal-Salgado\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L. production under tunnels has spread in recent years. However, there is little information on the productive and physiological responses of blueberry grown under high tunnels. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of high tunnel microclimate on the physiological and productive responses of blueberries.

This study identifies a set of fault-related processes that are pertinent to understanding the evolution of fault systems in fine-grained, poorly indurated volcanic ash by investigating exposures of faults in the Miocene-aged Joe Lott Tuff Member of the Mount Belknap Volcanics, Utah. The porosity and granularity of the host rock are found to control the style of localized strain that occurs prior to and contemporaneous with faulting. Deformation bands occur in tuff that was porous and granular at the time of deformation, while fractures formed where the tuff lost its porous and granular nature due to silicic alteration. Non-localized deformation of the host rock is also prominent and occurs through compaction of void space, including crushing of pumice clasts. Significant off-fault damage of the host rock, resembling fault pulverization, is recognized adjacent to one analog fault and may reflect the strain rate dependence of the resulting fault zone architecture. These findings provide important new guidelines for future structural analyses and numerical modeling of faulting and subsurface fluid flow through volcanic ash deposits on Mars.\n\nHinnangu andis 450 Raplamaa last / Leili Oja\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nOja, Leili\n\n2008-01-01\n\nKuulutati vÃ¤lja IX Nukitsa konkursi vÃµitjad - parimad lastekirjanikud ja lasteraamatukunstnikud.

H.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nIn order to yield new insight into the process of faulting in fine-grained, poorly indurated volcanic ash, the distribution of strain around faults in the Miocene-aged Joe Lott Tuff Member of the Mount Belknap Volcanics, Utah, is investigated. Several distinct styles of inelastic strain are identified. Deformation bands are observed in tuff that is porous and granular in nature, or is inferred to have been so at the time of deformation. Where silicic alteration is pervasive, fractures are the dominant form of localized strain. Non-localized strain within the host rock is manifest as pore space compaction, including crushing of pumice clasts. Distinct differences in fault zone architecture are observed at different magnitudes of normal fault displacement, in the mode II orientation. A fault with cm-scale displacements is manifest as a single well-defined surface. Off-fault damage occurs as pore space compaction near the fault tips and formation of deformation band damage zones that are roughly symmetric about the fault. At a fault with larger meter-scale displacements, a fault core is present. A recognizable fault-related deformation band damage zone is not observed here, even though large areas of the host rock remain porous and granular and deformation bands had formed prior to faulting. The host rock is instead fractured in areas of pervasive alteration and shows possible textural evidence of fault pulverization. The zones of localized and distributed strain have notably different spatial extents around the causative fault. The region of distributed deformation, as indicated by changes in gas permeability of the macroscopically intact rock, extends up to four times farther from the fault than the highest densities of localized deformation (i.e., fractures and deformation bands). This study identifies a set of fault-related processes that are pertinent to understanding the evolution of fault systems in poorly indurated tuff. Not surprisingly, the type of\n\nMapping the Customer Experience Management Strategies for Customer Loyalty in Retail Hypermarket Jabodetabek\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJerry Marcellinus Logahan\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Today, competition in the global market has become increasingly difficult and and at the same timeÂ products and services provided by retail companies tend to be similar.

To study the effects of moving parallel scientific applications onto the cloud, we deployed several benchmark applications like matrixâvector operations and NAS parallel benchmarks, and DOUG (Domain decomposition On Unstructured Grids on the cloud. DOUG is an open source software package for parallel iterative solution of very large sparse systems of linear equations. The detailed analysis of DOUG on the cloud showed that parallel applications benefit a lot and scale reasonable on the cloud. We could also observe the limitations of the cloud and its comparison with cluster in terms of performance. However, for efficiently running the scientific applications on the cloud infrastructure, the applications must be reduced to frameworks that can successfully exploit the cloud resources, like the MapReduce framework. Several iterative and embarrassingly parallel algorithms are reduced to the MapReduce model and their performance is measured and analyzed. The analysis showed that Hadoop MapReduce has significant problems with iterative methods, while it suits well for embarrassingly parallel algorithms. Scientific computing often uses iterative methods to solve large problems. Thus, for scientific computing on the cloud, this paper raises the necessity for better frameworks or optimizations for MapReduce.\n\nIBBY Eesti osakond 2007\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIBBY Eesti osakond esitas Astrid Lindgreni mÃ¤lestusauhinna kandidaatideks kirjanik Aino Perviku, illustraatorid Regina Lukk-Toompere ja Ilon Wiklandi.

A new concept for calculating Forming Limit Diagrams (FLD) using the finite element method is presented. The article presents a new strategy for calculating both branches of an FLD, using a Hutchinson - Neale model implemented in a finite element code. The simulations have been performed with Abaqus/Standard. The constitutive model has been implemented using a UMAT subroutine. The plastic anisotropy of the sheet metal is described by the Cazacu-Barlat and the BBC2003 yield criteria. The theoretical predictions have been compared with the results given by the classical Hutchinson - Neale method and also with experimental data for different aluminum alloys. The comparison proves the capability of the finite element method to predict the strain localization. A computer program used for interactive calculation and graphical representation of different Yield Loci and Forming Limit Diagrams has also been developed. The program is based on a Hutchinson-Neale model. Different yield criteria (Hill 1948, Barlat-Lian and BBC 2003) are implemented in this model. The program consists in three modules: a graphical interface for input, a module for the identification and visualization of the yield surfaces, and a module for calculating and visualizing the forming limit curves. A useful facility offered by the program is the possibility to perform the sensitivity analysis both for the yield surface and the forming limit curves. The numerical results can be compared with experimental data, using the import/export facilities included in the program.\n\nRecent Developments in the Formability of Aluminum Alloys\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBanabic, Dorel; Paraianu, Liana; Jurco, Paul; Cazacu, Oana\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe paper presents a few recent contributions brought by the authors in the field of the formability of aluminum alloys.

Hydrothermal systems at MOR expose ultrabasic rocks to thermodynamic conditions favouring oxidation of FeII bearing minerals and water reduction. In continental context such thermodynamic conditions do not exist although active serpentinisation occurs in all known ophiolitic complexes (Barnes et al., 1978; Bruni et al., 2002; Cipolli et al., 2004; Boschetti and Toscani, 2008; Marques et al., 2008). Hyperalkaline springs are reported in these contexts as evidence of this active serpentinisation (Barnes et al., 1967) and are often associated with seepages of reduced gases (Neal and Stanger, 1983; Sano et al., 1993). Dry gas seepages are also observed (Abrajano et al., 1988, 1990; HosgÃ¶rmez, 2007; Etiope et al., 2011) Such H2-rich gases from ophiolite complexes were sampled in the Sultanate of Oman, the Philippines and Turkey and were analysed for chemical composition, noble gases contents, stable isotopes of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. The conditions for present-day serpentinisation in ophiolites were recognised as low temperature processes in Oman with high rock/water ratios (Neal and Stanger, 1985), while the origin of gases is not as univocal for Philippines and Turkey gas seepages. Although, H2 generation is directly linked with FeII oxidation, different reactions can occur during peridotite hydration (McCollom and Bach, 2009; Marcaillou et al., 2011) and serpentine weathering. Produced H2 can react with carbonate species to produce methane via processes that could be biological or abiotic, while carbon availability depends on water recharge chemistry. In the present study, the geochemical properties of gases sampled from three different ophiolite complexes are compared and provide evidence that weathering reactions producing H2 depend on structural, geological, geomorphologic and hydrological local features.

After detailed study and consideration of the proposals for such facilities submitted to it, the Panel recommends: that the proposal submitted by the Southeastern University Research Association (SURA) be accepted and funded for the construction of a new National Electron Accelerator Laboratory (NEAL) centering on a 4 GeV linear accelerator-stretcher ring system capable of delivering intense, high duty factor, electron beams in the energy range from 500 to 4000 MeV. Additional recommendations relating to this principal one are to be found in the body of this report. As modified by the Panel consequent to its own studies and analyses, the estimated cost (in 1983 dollars) of the accelerator complex is 111.8 million dollars; of the entire laboratory is 146.8 million dollars; and the operating cost averaged over the first five years of operation is 18.1 million dollars per year. The projected 15 year total cost of the project is 418.3 million dollars. The construction period is estimated to be 4.5 years. The NEAL Laboratory, from the outset will be constructed and managed as a national rather than a regional facility and will provide the United States with a truly unique facility for research in electromagnetic physics\n\nAdaptability to climate change in forestry species: drought effects on growth and wood anatomy of ponderosa pines growing at different competition levels\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFernÃ¡ndez, M.E.; Gyenge, J.E.; de Urquiza, M.M.; Varela, S.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMore stressful conditions are expected due to climatic change in several regions, including Patagonia, South-America.

Misread by some critics as a soap opera pandering to white readers, Seraph is in fact a masterpiece worthy of in-depth study, which con-tinues Hurston's tradition of resolving conflicts with humor and demonstrates her cultural stance. Through analyzing the irony, humor and carnivalization in this fiction, it argues that Seraph on the Suwanee is a joke on racism, which blurs the lines between races and questions the notions of cultural and racial purity.\n\nRegistro de Cyclocephala flavipennis Arrow, 1914 (Coleoptera: Melolonthidae danificando plantas de mirtileiro no Brasil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGabriela InÃ©s Diez-RodrÃ­guez\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Larvas de Cyclocephala flavipennis Arrow, 1914, sÃ£o comumente encontradas em cereais de inverno (trigo, cevada, aveia e triticale, milho e soja, no Rio Grande do Sul.

In this mechanism, coupled harmonic motion of deuterons is supposed to lead to a reduction in the width of the Coulomb barrier for proton-deuteron (p-d) fusion in palladium, thereby substantially increasing the fusion rate. Instead, it is argued that deuteron-deuteron coupling does not have an important effect and that interaction with phonons does not enhance the p-d fusion rate\n\nGramÃ¡ticas de grafos y su aplicaciÃ³n en inferencia gramatical\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJeltsch F., Eric\n\n1997-01-01\n\nEn este trabajo se presentan las gramÃ¡ticas de grafos en particular un tipo de gramÃ¡ticas de grafo las cuales tienen un contexto libre en el mecanismo de derivaciÃ³n al igual que las gramÃ¡ticas de Chomsky proporcionando de esta manera un simple mecanismo para generar lenguajes de grafos.

Sampson, 1925-2002\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMÃ©szÃ¡ros, Peter; Clark, Robert E. H.; Zhang, Honglin; Fontes, Christopher J.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nDouglas H. Sampson, a renowned theoretical atomic physicist and a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at The Pennsylvania State University, passed away on 8 December 2002, in State College, Pennsylvania, of a hemorrhagic stroke. He had retired in 1997 after 32 years of service to the University and had maintained an active research program up to the day of his death. Doug, as he was universally known to his friends and colleagues, was born in Devils Lake, North Dakota on 19 May 1925. His parents, Abner and Mabel Sampson, were farmers. He was raised without running water or electricity on a farm, homesteaded by his ancestors in Edmore, North Dakota. He was one of two children in his class at a two-room rural elementary school and graduated as valedictorian from Edmore High School in 1944. No physics classes or advanced mathematics classes were offered in his small high school. In 1956, he was married to Carlyn Grutzner. During Doug Sampson's military service in the United States Army from February 1945 until December 1946, he was selected as a MP (Military Policeman) in the Philippines. His military experience provided him with the opportunity to attend college under the GI Bill. Because he had to work on the family farm, he started college a month later every fall and took exams a month earlier each spring. Nevertheless, Sampson graduated as co-salutatorian from Concordia College, Moorhead, Minnesota in 1951 with a BA degree with majors in physics and mathematics. Afterwards he received his MS and PhD degrees in theoretical physics from Yale University in 1953 and 1956 under the guidance of Henry Margenau. Sampson then became a staff member of the Theoretical Division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory until 1961. While there he performed calculations of fundamental atomic cross sections used in the determination of opacities for radiation transport simulations. The calculation of high quality atomic data would end up being a life long pursuit\n\nFrom Diversity Management to Diversimilation\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHolck, Lotte; Muhr, Sara Louise\n\nâDiversimilationâ as a corporate response to diversity By PhD fellow Lotte Holck, Copenhagen Business School (IOA) Abstract Across the North Atlantic organizations struggle to harvest the perceived â fruitsâ of diversity of enhanced organizational learning and requisite variety enriching task...... performance in response to globalized markets and customers â but by means of different approaches to organizing diversity (Klarsfeld 2012, Embrick 2011, Banting 2010, Holvino & Kamp 2009, Matten & Moon 2008, Risberg & SÃ¸derberg 2008, Campbell 2007, Boxenbaum 2007).

Watt (Leguminosae) (Lott 1985) in the Tropical Deciduous Forest\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDiaz-Gustavo, Norma; MartÃ­nez-Salvador, MartÃ­n; GarcÃ­a-HernÃ¡ndez, JosÃ© LuÃ­s; Norzagaray-Campos, Mariano; Luna-GonzÃ¡lez, Antonio; GonzÃ¡lez-Ocampo, HÃ©ctor Abelardo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCaesalpinia platyloba was evaluated as an alternative for the retention of atmospheric carbon and as a feasible and viable economic activity in terms of income for tropical deciduous forest (TDF) peasants in the carbon markets. A total of 110 trees of C. platyloba from plantations and a TDF in the Northwest of Mexico were sampled. Growth (increase in height, diameter, and volume curves) was adjusted to assess their growth. Growth of individuals (height, diameter at breast height [DBH], age, and tree crown cover) was recorded. The Schumacher model (H = Î² 0 e Î²1â¢E-1), by means of the guided curve method, was used to adjust growth models. Information analysis was made through the non-linear procedure with the multivariate secant or false position (DUD) method using the SAS software. Growth and increase models revealed acceptable adjustments (pseudo R2>0.8). C. platyloba reaches >8m of height with 12cm in diameter and 550cm3 of volume, presenting the highest increase at 11 years considered as basal age. Highest significant density of wood was in good quality sites (0.80gâ¢cm-3), with a carbon content (average of 99.15tCâ¢ha-1) at the highest density of 2500 treesâ¢ha-1 (without thinning). Average incomes of US$483.33tCâ¢ha-1 are expected. The profitability values (NPW = US$81,646.65, IRR = 472%, and B/C = 0.82) for C. platyloba make its cultivation a viable and profitable activity, considering a management scheme of the income derived from wood selling and from carbon credits.

R. E.; Burgess, P.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nChurg-Strauss syndrome is a small and medium vessel vasculitis that is also known as allergic granulomatous angiitis. It most commonly presents with an asthma like symptoms. It was first described in Mount Siani Hospital, New York in 1951 by Jacob Churg and Lotte Stauss and was recognised after the study of a series of 13 patients who had asthma, eosinophilia, granulomatous inflammation necrotising systemic vasculitis and necrotising glomerulonephritis. We describe a case of Churg-Strauss syndrome presenting with abdominal pain and later during the hospital admission a mono-neuritis multiplex syndrome affecting the lower limbs. The patient presented in such an atypical fashion with abdominal signs and symptoms that they required laparotomy and the diagnosis was made after histological examination of tissue taken at the time of surgery. Treatment with immunosuppression and aggressive rehabilitation achieved a progressive recovery which continued on discharge from hospital.

Their Eyes Were Watching God is partly an objection and Hurston's protest to injustices in terms of gender bias toward Afro-American women of the late 19th and early 20th century. Here, the writer wants to pose a question and finds the answer whether Janie Crawford adheres to the fixed concept of gender or she does question it.

This has created a need for new image processing guidelines and attitudes, such as those offered to the research community by Doug Cromey (Cromey 2010). We suggest that related changes in technology have simplified the task of detecting misconduct for journal editors as well as researchers, and that this simplification has caused a shift in the responsibility for reporting misconduct. We also argue that the concept of best practices in image processing can serve as a general model for education in best practices in research.\n\nPowerPoint 2013 for dummies\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLowe, Doug\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGet up and running with this full-color guide to PowerPoint 2013!

The Box-Bohnken design method was used to study the effect of operating parameters on the oxygen mass transfer coefficient. The investigated factors were agitation speed (rpm), aeration rate (vvm) and pulp density (% weight/volume) of the stirred tank reactor. Analysis of experimental results showed that the oxygen mass transfer coefficient had low dependence on biomass concentration but had higher dependence on the agitation speed, aeration rate and pulp density. The obtained biological enhancement factors were equal to ones in experiments. On the other hand, the obtained values for Damkohler number (Da < 0.468) indicated that the process was limited by the biochemical reaction rate. Experimental results obtained for oxygen mass transfer coefficient were correlated with the empirical relations proposed by Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez (2009) and Neale and Pinches (1994). Due to the high relative error in the correlation of Neale and Pinches, that correlation was corrected and the coefficient of determination was calculated to be 89%. The modified correlation has been obtained based on a wide range of operating conditions, which can be used to determine the mass transfer coefficient in a bioreactor\n\nFormulating analytic expressions for atomic collision cross sections\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTabata, Tatsuo; Kubo, Hirotaka; Sataka, Masao\n\n2003-08-01\n\nMethods to formulate analytic expression for atomic collision cross sections as a function of projectile energy are described on the basis of the experiences of the data compilation work for more than 20 years. Topics considered are the choice of appropriate functional forms for the expressions and optimization of adjustable parameters. To make extrapolation possible, functions to be used should have the form with reasonable asymptotic behavior. In this respect, modified Green-McNeal formulas have been found useful for various atomic collision cross sections. For ionization processes, a modified Lotz formula has often given a good fit. The ALESQ code for least-squares fits has been convenient to optimize adjustable parameters in analytic expressions.

The parasite grew profusely in an overlay of Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium plus 20% foetal bovine serum, on Novy, McNeal and Nicolle medium (NNN , at 27Â°C, with a peak around 168 hr. The morphometry of cultural forms of T. minasense, estimates of cell population size and comparative growth in four different media overlays always with NNN, were studied. The infectivity of cultural forms to marmosets (C. penicillata and C. jacchus and transformation of epimastigotes into metacyclic-like forms in axenic culture in the presence of chitin derivates (chitosan were evaluated.\n\nAn Overview of Potential Methods for Maintaining Training Area Environments in Arid and Semi-Arid Climates\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1983-04-01\n\nw 0- 4( - *0 0 0, u 44, a, 0 .vi -0 V~ 0.

[Yale Univ., New Haven, CT (United States). Dept. of Physics\n\n2017-12-06\n\nThe grant \"Taus at ATLAS\" supported the group of Sarah Demers at Yale University over a period of 8.5 months, bridging the time between her Early Career Award and her inclusion on Yale's grant cycle within the Department of Energy's Office of Science. The work supported the functioning of the ATLAS Experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider and the analysis of ATLAS data. The work included searching for the Higgs Boson in a particular mode of its production (with a W or Z boson) and decay (to a pair of tau leptons.) This was part of a broad program of characterizing the Higgs boson as we try to understand this recently discovered particle, and whether or not it matches our expectations within the current standard model of particle physics. In addition, group members worked with simulation to understand the physics reach of planned upgrades to the ATLAS experiment. Supported group members include postdoctoral researcher Lotte Thomsen and graduate student Mariel Pettee.\n\nHere comes everybody the power of organizing without organizations\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nShirky, Clay\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA revelatory examination of how the wildfirelike spread of new forms of social interaction enabled by technology is changing the way humans form groups and exist within them, with profound long-term economic and social effects-for good and for ill A handful of kite hobbyists scattered around the world find each other online and collaborate on the most radical improvement in kite design in decades.
