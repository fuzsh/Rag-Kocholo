        "text": "MUSIC WORLDS COLLIDE TO EMBRACE HIS LATEST ALBUM\n\nSting to headline anniversary concert, performing a collection of greatest hits from the Police and his solo career\n\nTenor Sensation Juan Diego Flrez to perform classical masterpieces under the baton of Rafael Frºhbeck de Burgos\n\nAnniversary Ball follows at the Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue\n\nPhoto Credit: ¬© Tony Molina\n\nPhiladelphia, December 28, 2009 Äî Academy of Music officials are honored to soon present world-renowned singer/composer Sting in an extraordinary classical setting, as his diverse audience embraces the classical influences of his youth with his newly certified Gold album, If on a Winter's Night...\n\nAs the headline attraction of the spectacular Academy of Music 153rd Anniversary Concert on Saturday, January 30, 2010, in performance with The Philadelphia Orchestra and his own quartet of musicians conducted by David Hartley, Sting will perform in Philadelphia with an abundance of fresh critical and popular acclaim. Watching his album become a classical crossover sensation since debuting at #1 on Billboard's Classical and Seasonal charts at the start of the holiday season, the Academy is especially proud to welcome Sting with such comfortable surroundings unique to the intermingling genres that have defined his remarkable career for nearly four decades.\n\nÄùWe are especially thrilled to be hosting Sting for the annual Concert and Ball,Äù said Academy of Music President Joanna McNeil Lewis. ÄúThe Academy has a history filled with performers representing an impressive and diverse array of music. Sting is the epitome of that representation as his talent spans across many genres, and he continues to explore new possibilities. Now the public will have an opportunity to see him perform with our Philadelphia Orchestra, one of the premier orchestras in the world.Äù\n\nThe first half of the program will showcase Rafael Frºhbeck de Burgos, chief conductor and artistic director of the Dresden Philharmonic, leading The Philadelphia Orchestra in a program of masterpieces featuring guest tenor Juan Diego Flrez, a thrilling performer famous for his high C's. In 2008, Flrez became the first soloist to perform an encore at the Metropolitan Opera since Luciano Pavarotti in 1994. In February, Flrez will reprise his headline-grabbing Metropolitan Opera performance as Tonio in La Fille du R©giment.\n\nSting will be backed by the Orchestra and a versatile quartet comprised of Dominic Miller on guitar, David Sancious on piano, Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, and Christian McBride on bass, performing notable songs from the Police repertoire and his solo career, in original orchestrations.\n\nSting first became interested in classical music while it permeated his home as a child and has always carried that music with him throughout his enduring career.\n\nÄùI grew up listening to classical music, and remember being under the piano while my mother played Beethoven sonatas in our house,Äù says Sting. ÄúI always strive to challenge myself, and music allows me to constantly learn new things.Äù\n\nThe gala champagne dinner and ball at the Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue hotel follows the concert.

Watch the artist at work from February 13 to 22 only.\n\nThe Institute for Contemporary Culture (ICC) at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) presents the new art installation, Dan Perjovschi: Late News, beginning on February 22, 2010. Distinguished in the world of contemporary art, Dan Perjovschi will draw his brilliant and irreverent cartoons directly onto the dramatic soaring walls of the Roloff Beny Gallery, on Level 4 of the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal at the ROM. Dan Perjovschi: Late News is the artistÄôs first solo exhibition in Canada.\n\nBetween February 13th and 22nd, Perjovschi will spend ten days in residence at the Museum, creating his unique site-specific line drawings while interacting with Museum visitors. This original work will remain on display until summer 2010.\n\nÄúResponding to the troubled world economy, rapid social change and political upheavals, the work of Dan Perjovschi provides a perceptive and often cheeky examination of the things that keep us awake at night. We are thrilled to invite him to the ROM, to watch him in action, and to be left with an original work of art that serves as an honest snapshot of todayÄôs world,Äù said William Thorsell, ROM Director and CEO.\n\nAbout Dan Perjovschi: Late News:\n\nThe ICC has invited Perjovschi to create a new site-specific installation for the ROM, where from February 13 to February 22, 2010, the artist will transform the walls of the Roloff Beny Gallery. While working in the gallery, Perjovschi will immerse himself in local media, surveying news from local and international newspapers, internet, TV and radio, which will provide the inspiration for his work.\n\nPerjovschiÄôs acclaimed exhibitions are always a personal response to the social and political atmosphere, and the geographic location, in which they are created. The works will be created during public hours, allowing Museum visitors to observe the creation in progress, making the drawing project a performance in itself. As the work will be painted over at the conclusion of the exhibition period, the ICC will produce a free publication (available in the gallery in the spring) that will be the record of the Late News installation.\n\nAbout Dan Perjovschi:\n\nRomanian-born Dan Perjovschi is an artist who mixes drawing, cartoon and graffiti in artistic pieces drawn directly on the walls of European and American museums and contemporary art spaces. These drawings Äì both witty and incisive Äì comment on current political, social or cultural issues or events. His stark style of line drawing allows him to condense the conflicts and dilemmas of the world into a rapid-response commentary that is both political and honest.\n\nPerjovschi garnered international attention at the 48th Venice Biennale (1999), where he covered the floor of the Romanian Pavillion with drawings and political graffiti about life in the post-Communist era. At the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007) his drawings were included in the main International Exhibition. He has had solo and group exhibitions at the Tate Modern (London) and Tate Liverpool, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), Kunsthalle Basel, Centre Pompidou (Paris) and the Moscow Biennale.\n\nFormally trained as a still-life painter in a Soviet-style art academy in Romania, Perjovschi was encouraged to question the practicality of his classical grounding when the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceauüescu collapsed in 1989. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent rise of the European Union, Eastern Europe has seen a shift in its regional and national identities. This new political reality is fertile ground for PerjovschiÄôs tongue-in-cheek yet pointed observations, which have been sharpened by his background in journalism. Since 1991, Perjovschi has served as political illustrator and art director for the Bucharest-based independent magazine Revista 22, the first political journal founded in Romania after the fall of the Ceauüescu regime.\n\nPerjovschiÄôs artistic practice has been influenced by artists of the 1960s and 1970s, newspaper cartoonists, the international art scene, and mainly by the media. In order to reach more people with his satirical thoughts on society, Perjovschi opted for the popular language of political cartoons. Inspiration for his drawings comes from a multitude of sources: conversations, rumours, newspaper articles, gossip, television, and global or local events. The illustrations are simple black marker line drawings, sometimes accompanied with succinct wordplay or punch line captions. With just a few strokes, Perjovschi sums up the current state of affairs with regard to religion, terror, nationalism or consumerism. The results are a hybrid of graffiti and activism with the best qualities of a good newspaper cartoon.\n\nInstitute for Contemporary Culture\n\nThe Institute for Contemporary Culture (ICC) plays a vital role at the ROM, a museum whose collections embrace many civilizations through the ages. As the ROM documents history, the ICC is the ROMÄôs window on contemporary society, exploring current cultural issues through exhibitions of art, lectures, film series, and informal gatherings. The ROMÄôs collections provide context and depth to the contemporary issues addressed by participants in ICC events from around the world. In this, and many other ways, the ICC serves as a catalyst for stimulating public conversations. For more information on the ICC, visit www.rom.on.ca/about/icc.\n\nOther information:\n\nA public talk featuring Dan Perjovschi will be presented near the end of his residency at the ICC. Details will be announced later at www.rom.on.ca/icc\n\nAdmission to Dan Perjovschi: Late News is included in general Museum admission: Adults: $22; Students and Seniors with ID: $19; Children (4 to 14 years) $15; Children 3 & under are free. Half Price Friday Nights, presented by Sun Life Financial, take place from 4:30 pm to 9:30 pm. To book a group of ten or more and for more information on private guided tours or group menu, please call ROM Group Sales at 416.586.5889 or email groupsales@rom.on.ca.\n\nDan Perjovschi: Late News is organized by the Institute for Contemporary Culture at the Royal Ontario Museum, in association with Lombard-Freid Projects, New York.\n\nLabels: Royal Ontario Museum\n\nAT CARNEGIE HALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2010, AT 8:00PM\n\nCOLUMBIA ARTISTS MANAGEMENT PRESENTS\n\nMS. BATTLE WITH PIANIST OLGA KERN IN WORKS BY\n\nRACHMANINOFF, LISZT AND SCHUBERT\n\nKathleen Battle, one of the greatest coloratura sopranos of our time, will perform in recital at Carnegie Hall (Stern Auditorium, Perelman Stage) on Monday, February 8, 2010 at 8 p.m. Presented by Columbia Artists Management, Ms. Battle will be joined by Olga Kern, Van Cliburn International Piano Competition Gold Medalist.

Yet beyond the glory of her singing, in a career filled with countless accolades, honors and major milestones, what has perhaps distinguished her most is her almost magical ability to create an unwavering emotional bond between herself, her music and her audience.\n\nIn her youth, this native of Portsmouth, Ohio, the youngest of seven children, sang in church and school, and envisioned a future as a music teacher. Fortunately for audiences around the world, she found other ways to share her love of music Äì and, through her natural gifts, innate intelligence, and hard work, her soaring voice has carried her to the heights of the music world. Indeed, throughout a remarkable career that has brought her to the stages of the worldÄôs leading opera houses and major concert halls, critics have never tired of rhapsodizing over her limpid, unmistakable sound. In quite poetic terms, they have compared it to Äúthe ethereal beauty of winter moonlightÄù (The Washington Post), Äúa paradoxical meeting of earth and skyÄù (Philadelphia Inquirer), and Äúcream from a miraculous, bottomless pitcherÄù (The New York Times).\n\nThe range of Ms. BattleÄôs repertoire spans three centuries, from the Baroque era to contemporary works. She has enjoyed some of her greatest successes in the opera house in repertoire ranging from Handel (Cleopatra in the Metropolitan OperaÄôs premiere staging of Giulio Cesare) to Richard Strauss (Sophie, Zdenka, Zerbinetta). For her Covent Garden debut as Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, Ms. Battle became the first American to be honored with a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a New Opera Production. She has similarly distinguished herself as one of our generationÄôs finest interpreters of Mozart (Susanna, Despina, Pamina, and Zerlina), as well as the bel canto operas of Rossini (Il Barbiere di Siviglia) and Donizetti (LÄôElisir d'Amore, Don Pasquale, and La Fille du Regiment). In the words of critic Tim Page, ÄúMs. BattleÄôs natural territory is music of sweetness, serenity, and girlish ecstasy. Within this repertoire she is all but unequaled.Äù\n\nIn recital, Kathleen Battle has mesmerized audiences around the globe with her unique artistry and vocal beauty. Of her Carnegie Hall recital debut, New York Newsday declared, ÄúIn an age when the vocal recital has practically gone the way of the dinosaur, this was a thrilling case for its return.Äù For the CD of this recital, released on DG, Ms. Battle received one of three Grammy Awards for Best Classical Vocal Soloist. The Australian echoed the sentiment of critics around the world, saying, ÄúThe Sydney Opera House has played host to any number of great singersÄ¶but itÄôs unlikely there has ever been (or perhaps ever will be) a performance to match the recital American soprano Kathleen Battle gave.Äù\n\nKathleen BattleÄôs gifts as a singer extend beyond the realm of classical music. Her work as a great interpreter of spirituals is documented on a joint recital with Jessye Norman, Spirituals in Concert (DG). Her pure emotional power in this music of joy and sorrow cuts through all cultural boundaries. As the Vienna Kurier put it, ÄúKathleen Battle sang so beautifully in the spiritual ÄòHeaven is one beautiful place,Äô she came pretty close to heaven.Äù\n\nMs. Battle drew considerable attention with the world premiere of Honey and Rue, a song cycle with music by Oscar and Grammy-winner composer Andr© Previn and lyrics by Nobel and Pulitzer Prizewinning author Toni Morrison, commissioned for Ms. Battle by Carnegie Hall on the event of their 100th anniversary. Since then, she has performed the work with leading orchestras and in recital throughout the world. The Los Angeles Times called her performance of this work Äúspellbinding,Äù while the Cincinnati Herald remarked, Äúher voice was like the ebb and flow of the seas as an almost sacred silence enclosed the auditorium.Äù The recording of this cycle was released by DG, on a disc which also includes BarberÄôs Knoxville: Summer of 1915 and arias from GershwinÄôs Porgy and Bess.\n\nAlways seeking to expand her artistic horizons, Ms. Battle was joined by leading jazz musicians for her first crossover album, So Many Stars (Sony Classical), a collection of lullabies, spirituals, and folksongs. Commenting on her extraordinary gifts as a jazz artist, The Detroit News noted, ÄúWhen Battle and her core jazz trio held the stage, the musical splendor was almost more than the ear could take in.Äù\n\nSince her student years, Kathleen Battle has collaborated with colleagues who rank among the worldÄôs most talented musicians. She has been a favorite soloist with the worldÄôs leading orchestras and esteemed conductors such as Herbert von Karajan, Riccardo Muti, Seiji Ozawa, Leonard Slatkin, Andr© Previn, Claudio Abbado, Sir Georg Solti, James Levine, Lorin Maazel, and Sir Neville Marriner. Her partnerships with soprano Jessye Norman, tenors Luciano Pavarotti and Pl°cido Domingo, violinist Itzhak Perlman, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, guitarist Christopher Parkening, flautists Jean-Pierre Rampal and Hubert Laws, and the late saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr., to name but a few, are documented on numerous recordings and video discs.\n\nKathleen Battle has established herself as a distinguished recording artist through a wide range of releases encompassing complete opera, concert, choral and solo albums on all major labels. Memorable concerts recorded live and now available on CD and home video include MozartÄôs Coronation Mass from the Vatican and the 1987 New YearÄôs Concert, both with Herbert von Karajan conducting; the CDs are on the DG label with the video versions on Sony. Her performance of the title role in the DG recording of Handel's Semele, with Marilyn Horne, Samuel Ramey, and John Nelson conducting, earned Ms. Battle a fifth Grammy Award. This recording commemorates a now-legendary concert performance of HandelÄôs masterpiece, starring Ms. Battle and virtually the same cast as the recording, which created such a sensation that Carnegie Hall recognized it as one of its one hundred milestones during its centennial year.\n\nKathleen Battle has made immeasurable contributions as an ambassador for classical music, performing for presidents and dignitaries, and attracting diverse new audiences through television broadcasts of her operas and concerts, as well as through appearances on popular network talk shows. Her performance on the PBS broadcast of the Metropolitan OperaÄôs 1991 season opening gala won her an Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in a Classical Program on Television. A documentary film on the recording of SonyÄôs Baroque Duet album with Wynton Marsalis and John Nelson conducting the Orchestra of St. LukeÄôs was nominated for an Emmy. Ms. BattleÄôs critically acclaimed ÄúMetropolitan Opera PresentsÄù performances of Mozart's Die Zauberflte, Donizetti's LÄôElisir dÄôAmore, and Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia are available on DG VHS and DVD, while Sony has captured her Zerlina in KarajanÄôs production of Don Giovanni at the Salzburg Festival as well.\n\nPraised for the keen intelligence which informs her musical sensitivity, Kathleen Battle earned both her Bachelor and Master degrees from the College Conservatory of Music, University of Cincinnati. She has been awarded seven honorary doctoral degrees -- from her Alma Mater, the University of Cincinnati; Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey; Ohio University; Xavier University in Cincinnati; Amherst College; Seton Hall University; Wilberforce University; and Manhattanville College. In honor of her outstanding artistic achievements, Ms. Battle was inducted into the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame, and in 2002 into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame. She is the first recipient of the Ray Charles Award, bestowed upon her by Wilberforce University. These are heady accomplishments indeed for an artist whose earliest connection to music was simply feeling Äúblessed to have a voice that somebody else wanted to hear.Äù\n\nAbout Olga Kern\n\nWith her vivid stage presence, passionately confident musicianship and extraordinary technique, the striking young Russian pianist Olga Kern has continued to captivate fans and critics alike. Across the United States each season, she is in demand for re-engagements and new appearances, and is quickly being recognized worldwide.\n\nAs a result of her performance of Sergei RachmaninoffÄôs Piano Concerto No. 3 at the 11th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2001, Olga Kern won the Gold Medal and became the first woman to achieve this distinction in over 30 years. OlgaÄôs second triumph came in New York City on May 4, 2004, with a highly acclaimed New York City recital debut at CarnegieÄôs Zankel Hall. In an unprecedented turn of events eleven days later, on May 12, 2004, Olga Kern gave a recital in Isaac Stern Auditorium at the invitation of Carnegie Hall.\n\nThis season, Olga will perform all of the Rachmaninoff concerti in residence with the Colorado Symphony, have her debut with the New Jersey Symphony, and perform in several special event concerts with famed soprano Kathleen Battle. The summer of 2009 brought Olga Kern her fourth re-engagement at the Ravinia Festival for RachmaninoffÄôs Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Chicago Symphony under the baton of James Conlon. She also performed at the Brevard Music Festival, International Keyboard Institute, and gave a recital and master classes in New York City.\n\nIn the 2008-2009 Season, Olga made her debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under Leonard Slatkin and presented recitals in Washington, DC; La Jolla, CA; and Fort Worth, TX; among other cities. After a critically acclaimed 35-city tour of the U.S. in spring 2007 with the National Philharmonic of Russia and Vladimir Spivakov, Ms. Kern opened the 2007-2008 season as guest soloist with the Colorado Symphony, performed with the Nashville Symphony, and made her debut with the Vancouver Symphony. In May of 2008, Olga Kern toured North America with Maestro Spivakov and the world renowned Moscow Virtuosi, presenting concerts in Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, Washington, DC, and Toronto.\n\nOlga Kern made her London debut with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in 2006 playing ShostakovichÄôs Piano Concerto No. 1 with Leonard Slatkin conducting. She returned to London in 2008 for her Proms Debut playing RachmaninoffÄôs Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Leonard Slatkin conducting. Recent European appearances have included a tour of Austria and Switzerland with the Warsaw Philharmonic and Maestro Antoni Wit, a tour of Germany with the Czech Philharmonic and Maestro Zdenek Maßal, performances with the orchestras of Copenhagen and Lyon, and recitals in Milan, Hamburg and Luxemburg. Ms. Kern made her South American debut with the Orquestra de S£o Paulo in March, 2008. She recently made her Canadian debut with the National Arts Centre Orchestra and conductor Pinchas Zukerman in summer 2007, and she made her debut with the Taipei Symphony in June of 2006. She made her debut with the Seoul Philharmonic in October of 2008.\n\nMs. KernÄôs festival appearances are many. In June of 2008, she presented the Inaugural Concert of the Southeastern Piano Festival in Columbia, South Carolina. She is welcomed back frequently to the Interlochen Festival, Bravo! Vail Festival, and the Ravinia Festival with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and James Conlon, after having made her debut there in 2002 with Christoph Eschenbach. She made her Hollywood Bowl debut in 2005 and returned to the Festival Casals in Puerto Rico in 2007, where she performed to a sold out venue. She has been a recent guest artist at several international music festivals, including the Klavier Ruhr and Kissinger Sommer festivals in Germany, the Radio-France Montpellier and Casadesus festivals in France, the Ohrid Festival in Macedonia, and the Busoni Festival in Italy.\n\nIn 2002, Olga Kern made an extensive tour of South Africa where she returned to tour again in 2005, performing all four Rachmaninoff piano concertos and Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini with her brother, Vladimir Kern, conducting, three times over a span of six days, an unprecedented feat undertaken especially for the South African audience. She is now Artistic Director of the Cape Town Festival in South Africa and returns there annually.\n\nMs. Kern has performed in many of the world's most important venues, including the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, Symphony Hall in Osaka, Salzburger Festspielhaus, La Scala in Milan, Tonhalle in Zurich, and the Ch¢telet in Paris. She has appeared as soloist with the Bolshoi Theater, Moscow Philharmonic, St. Petersburg Symphony, Russian National Orchestra, China Symphony, Belgrade Philharmonic, La Scala Philharmonic, Torino Symphony, and Cape Town Symphony Orchestras. She has also performed with the Kirov Orchestra under the direction of Valery Gergiev at the Kennedy Center.\n\nMs. Kern was born into a family of musicians with direct links to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff and began studying piano at the age of five. Winner of the first Rachmaninoff International Piano Competition when she was seventeen, she is a laureate of eleven international competitions and has toured throughout her native Russia, Europe, and the United States, as well as in Japan, South Africa, and South Korea. The recipient of an honorary scholarship from the President of Russia in 1996, she is a member of RussiaÄôs International Academy of Arts. She began her formal training with acclaimed teacher Evgeny Timakin at the Moscow Central School and continued with Professor Sergei Dorensky at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory, where she was also a postgraduate student. She also studied with Boris Petrushansky at the acclaimed Accademia Pianistica Incontri col Maestro in Imola, Italy.\n\nMs. Kern records exclusively for Harmonia Mundi. Her most recent recording of the Brahms Variations was released in September of 2007. Her discography includes recordings of TchaikovskyÄôs Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and Christopher Seaman (2003), a Rachmaninoff recording of the Corelli Variations and other transcriptions (2004), a recital disk with works by Rachmaninoff and Balakirev (2005) and ChopinÄôs Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Warsaw Philharmonic and Antoni Wit (2006). She was also featured in the award-winning documentary about the 2001 Cliburn Competition, Playing on the Edge.\n\nLabels: Kathleen Battle\n\nJanuary 10-13, 2010\n\nGlenn Gould Studio, Gallery 345, Music Gallery and U of T\n\nNEW MUSIC CONCERTSÄô 39th Season\n\nNew musical inventions that provoke, awaken and inspire\n\nFor Immediate Release Äì Toronto, December 21, 2009: Poland has long enjoyed the reputation of spawning some of the worldÄôs most successful and controversial composers. New Music Concerts enters 2010 with a four-day Polish festival beginning on January 10 with Zygmunt Krauze and the Polish Perspective. Distinguished pianist/composer Zygmunt Krauze has curated a program of Canadian premieres by challenging young Polish composers and including Pawel Szymanski, who has proved himself one of the most uncompromising composers of our times. As part of the mini-Polish festival, Zygmunt Krauze offers a special benefit recital for New Music Concerts (January 11, non-subscription event) in which he improvises on the music Chopin and LutosÇawski, as well as a Free Public Lecture at the Faculty of Music, University of Toronto on January 12. The Polish celebration ends on a high note as PolandÄôs electrifying performer Agata Zubel, a versatile musician who enjoys a rising double career as composer and soprano, performs music for solo voice with piano and electroacoustic accompaniment, on January 13.\n\nFamed Polish composer and pianist Zygmunt Krauze was born in 1938. He studied composition and piano at the Frederic Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw and with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. He is known as a composer of unistic music, based on the theory of unistic art adopted from the painting of Wladyslaw Strzeminski (1893-1952). Unistic music lacks contrasts, tension and climaxes in the traditional sense and its form is as homogenous as possible. Krauze has written operas, film music, symphonic and chamber works. Together with architects he also composed spatial music, which was presented in Poland, Austria and France. His music has been performed throughout the world. A sought-after teacher and lecturer, Krauze is a true music pioneer. He has received countless awards and honours, and is very active as a pianist performing mostly 20th century music.\n\nBorn in Wroclaw in 1978, Agata Zubel leads a busy double career as a singer and composer. She has won several international competitions for both voice and composition. As a vocalist she has participated in many prestigious musical events. Modern music occupies a special place in her repertoire, and she has premiered and recorded numerous works by contemporary composers. She established the ElettroVoce Duo together with composer and pianist Cezary Duchnowski. On January 10, she performs Cascando for voice, flute, clarinet, violin and cello, based on the 1936 poem by Samuel Beckett (not his later radio play of the same name). ÄúWith Cascando, it seems, Agata Zubel has crossed another threshold. She has submitted the almost unlimited technical abilities of her voice, and her temperament as a composer and singer, to the ascetic text, perfectly conveying the psychological truth of BeckettÄôs reductionism, the chilling logic of his world and the suppressed emotions and despair that underlie that chillÄù, writes Joanna Grotkowska in the liner notes of the CD, also entitled Cascando.\n\nAgata Zubel\n\nJanuary Polish festival events sponsored by the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in Toronto:\n\nSunday January 10, 2010\n\nZygmunt Krauze and the Polish Perspective\n\nNew Music Concerts Ensemble; Zygmunt Krauze, piano and direction; Agata Zubel, soprano\n\nPawel Mykietyn (Poland, 1971) Äì 3 for 13 (1994)\n\nAgata Zubel (Poland, 1978) Äì Cascando (2007) for soprano, flute, clarinet, violin and cello\n\nZygmunt Krauze (Poland, 1938) Äì Piano Quintet (1993)\n\nZygmunt Krauze Äì Polychromie (1968) for clarinet, trombone, piano and cello\n\nPawel Szymanski (Poland, 1954) Äì Concerto Ý 4 (2004) for clarinet, trombone, piano and cello\n\nWojciech BÇaºejczyk (Poland, 1981) Äì *M.A.D.
