        "text": "Citation preview\n\nCITIES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING\n\nThis book provides a comparative perspective on housing and planning policies affecting the future of cities, focusing on people- and place-based outcomes using the nexus of planning, design and policy. A rich mosaic of case studies features good practices of city-led strategies for affordable housing provision, as well as individual projects capitalising on partnerships to build mixedincome housing and revitalise neighbourhoods. Twenty chapters provide unique perspectives on diversity of approaches in eight countries and 12 cities in Europe, Canada and the USA. Combining academic rigour with knowledge from critical practice, the book uses robust empirical analysis and evidence-based case study research to illustrate the potential of affordable housing partnerships for mixed-income, socially inclusive neighbourhoods as a model to rebuild cities. Cities and Affordable Housing is an essential interdisciplinary collection on planning and design that will be of great interest to scholars, urban professionals, architects, planners and policymakers interested in housing, urban planning and city building. Sasha Tsenkova is Professor of Planning at the School of Architecture, Planning & Landscape, University of Calgary, Canada. She has published extensively on housing and urban issues and has worked for international organisations on projects in Europe, North America and Central Asia.\n\nCITIES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING Planning, Design and Policy Nexus\n\nEdited by Sasha Tsenkova\n\nNEW YORK AND LONDON\n\nFirst published 2022 by Routledge 605 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10158 and by Routledge 2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon OX14 4RN Routledge is an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an informa business © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Sasha Tsenkova; individual chapters, the contributors The right of Sasha Tsenkova to be identified as the author of the editorial material, and of the authors for their individual chapters, has been asserted in accordance with sections 77 and 78 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

It affects 1.6 billion people (one-third of urban population) and is a key priority for policy change identified by the United Nations in the New Urban Agenda ( Tsenkova, 2016). Globally, cities and central governments have championed housing strategies and action plans, with a strong emphasis on effective partnerships to ensure housing efficiency in an effort to make cities livable and sustainable. In the context of the COVID-19 public health crisis, access to affordable and adequate housing has become extremely important, providing a refuge in the midst of rapid urban transformation and collapsing urban economies. The need for a resilient housing system, capable of responding to external shocks with the inherent ability to bounce back, will indeed define the success of cities in the future. Problems of housing affordability and accessibility have become more pressing during the pandemic. Cities during lockdowns have delivered a rapid response through rent freezes, tenant protection, provision of emergency shelters, conversion of underutilised hotels and offices into affordable housing and the building of more permanent solution using modular and prefabricated technologies. In many places, the crisis has triggered political commitments and action to address the supply challenge, providing a sustainable range of affordable housing solutions. In the wake of post-pandemic recovery, the unprecedented challenges to public health in cities have demonstrated the need to consider affordable housing as a critical part of social infrastructure that requires sustained investment and support to establish a resilient ecosystem of housing providers ( Tsenkova, 2021). This stands in sharp contrast to the long-term decline in social and affordable housing investment in many contexts since the late 1970s (A ngel, 2000). While there is no common definition of social housing, the book recognises the contextual differences in the structure, policies and trajectories in different countries (van Bortel et al., 2019). We use the term ‘social housing’ to recognise these differences and important nuances in interpretation to as housing systems are path- dependent. In European countries with a large share of social housing, the sector operates like a ‘social market’ in direct competition with private renting. The institutional arrangements favour ownership by not-for-profit or private landlords, rents are based on cost recovery principles and allocation extends access to a more diverse income group. Europe, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Austria exemplify the characteristics of such unitary systems DOI: 10.4324/9781003172949-1\n\n2 Sasha Tsenkova\n\n( Kemeny, Kersloot and Thalmann, 2005). The United Kingdom and France have a strong legacy of public/council housing, which despite some residualisation, has seen a growing commitment to provision of social housing through m ixed-income, mixed-tenure projects in the last decade ( Bailey et al., 2006; Kearns et al., 2013). At the other end of the spectrum, in most countries, social housing has a residual role, and the small sector—less than 5%— operates as a safety net. Access is reserved for low-income households, allocation is rationed, rents are heavily subsidised and management is carried out by public institutions. The terminology in housing policy discourse refers to public housing as the dominant form of social housing, while more recent programmes will target affordable housing, usually in some form of mixed income. All post-socialist countries, after a dramatic privatisation of public housing in the 1990s, fall in this category, as well as Canada and the United States ( Tsenkova, 2021). Notwithstanding these path- dependent characteristics of social and affordable housing systems in different countries, housing policy reforms since the 1990s have moved away from bricks and mortar to demand-based subsidies and towards more market-oriented provision models (Sousa & Quarter, 2003; Stephens, Burns & Mackay, 2002). The growing dependence on private housing finance and the opening up of a previously sheltered systems of social housing provision have created a more entrepreneurial model with considerable changes regarding the role of social housing in cities, the way it is provided and for whom. While historically public housing played a significant role in shaping urban communities, in the era of neoliberal reforms, its future was challenged by declining investment, ageing infrastructure and design that was less conducive to social integration ( Bacher, 1993; Oxley, 2000). Over time, the compositions of actors and agencies involved shifted drastically from public provision towards multi-actor/agency collaboration ( Berry, 2014). Socially owned housing managed by nonprofit, private and community-based organisations in ‘ hybrid’ forms replaced public housing to address the needs of targeted groups (i.e., the homeless, seniors, vulnerable households), but its growth remained limited despite the increasing affordability gap in many cities ( Dalton, 2009; Fraser & Kick, 2007). In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, the cracks in the models of affordable housing delivery highlighted the vulnerability of the system. The crisis also provided an opportunity to reconsider the policy support and alignment of financial, fiscal and regulatory instruments to build resilience ( Tsenkova, 2014). Given the devolution of government involvement in affordable housing, consensus emerged that an effective response requires a multi-sectoral approach, including all levels of government, the private for-profit and non-profit sectors, as well as local communities. This is perceived as the most effective way of producing affordable housing to meet growing local needs within limited resources and capacity (Scanlon, Whitehead & Arrigoitia, 2014; van Bortel et al., 2019). The last decade has seen large cities across Europe and North America join their efforts with non-profit and private organisations to provide affordable rental housing in mixed-income, mixed-tenure projects. In some cases, the model had a strong legacy, and it was ‘ business as usual’ in countries with unitary social housing systems. In other places, the shift triggered a range of experimental strategies to redevelop large-scale public housing complexes or to reinvent brownfield sites in cities into inclusive neighbourhoods emphasising social mix and integration (Tsenkova, 2019). Such solutions to the affordable housing challenge in cities demonstrated a viable alternative to address vulnerabilities in the housing market as well as make cities more inclusive and competitive. This book focuses on these solutions and provides comparative perspectives on partnerships for mixed-income affordable housing as a model of neighbourhood revitalisation and city building. Focusing on the nexus of planning, design and policy, it explores good practices in 15 cities in Europe, Canada and USA using a strong conceptual approach and multidisciplinary\n\nAffordable Housing 3\n\nmethods of analysis. This richly illustrated collection of case studies includes contributions from 25 world-class scholars, architects, city leaders, planners and housing experts committed to innovative approaches to socially inclusive cities.\n\nConceptual Approach The future of affordable housing requires a different approach to socially inclusive cities based on partnerships, people-centred design and innovative planning. The mixed-income model is globally recognised as the best practice in many cities in the UK, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Germany and the USA, where the provision of m ixed-income housing in different forms is a normative requirement (Scanlon, Whitehead, & Arrigoitia, 2014). The overall goal of mixed-income housing is to establish better quality of life and adequate living conditions for all residents. There is ample research conducted on the efforts, rationale and importance of mixed-income housing ( Bailey et al., 2006; Livingston, Kearns, & Bailey, 2013). However, the theoretical framework, conceptual clarity and empirical justification are underexamined. We have adopted a conceptual approach that focuses on place-based and people-based outcomes of mixed-income affordable housing delivered through partnerships ( Tsenkova, 2014). The framework is applied to explore a variety of city-led strategies in seven European countries, USA and Canada by using original, multidisciplinary research methods of analysis. The nexus of housing policy, planning and design is a critical lens for these multi-scalar explorations at the level of cities, neighbourhoods and specific projects. The conceptual approach in the book brings a sustainability perspective to the exploration of partnership models by emphasising the need for equity and social inclusion through social mix and environmental sustainability of the built forms through design.\n\nEfficiency through Partnerships for Affordable Housing Recent housing reforms respond to the ‘market failure’ in affordable housing defined by Berry (2014) as lack of stable and consistent policies, absence of planning mechanisms that regulate affordable housing and a failure in governance to coordinate and strategise. On the policy side, a renewed commitment of governments, complemented with city-based strategies and municipal programmes, demonstrates a transformative change in the supply of affordable, adequate and secure rental housing ( Kemeny, Kersloot, & Thalmann, 2005; Tsenkova, 2019). National and city-led housing strategies provide municipalities with a significant opportunity to realign resources, land and infrastructure investments, as well as leverage the capacity of the housing industry and the not-for-profit ­ ­​­­ ​­ providers to support partnerships in ­mixed-income, ​­ ­mixed-tenure ​­ projects (Moore & Skaburski, 2004; Smith, 2002). This is the most efficient way of producing affordable housing to meet growing local needs, particularly in the context of inner-city neighbourhood rebuilding. The theoretical framework for housing partnerships is based on collaborative planning, consensus-based ­ ​­ ­decision-making, ​­ ­non-hierarchical ​­ structures and processes, synergistic interactions among partners and shared accountability for outcomes and results (see Bovaird, 2004; Brinkerhoff & Brinkerhoff, 2011). Recent research profiles a model of public, private and nonprofit ( PPNP) partnership that has evolved to deliver affordable rental housing, capitalising on the strengths of each sector. The public sector (federal, provincial, municipal) is effective in the mobilisation of much-needed resources, while the private sector (designers, developers, housing industry, construction companies) is efficient in managing the construction process by maximising economies of scale and tapping into technological innovation and marketing strategies.\n\n4 Sasha Tsenkova\n\n­\n\nMunicipal governments have a critical role in the provision of affordable rental housing (Carmona, Carmona & Gallent, 2003; Whitehead, 2007). Some of the incentives and planning strategies to stimulate mixed-income, mixed-tenure housing projects include waiving development charges, selling municipal land at discounted rates, lowering property taxes, inclusionary zoning or start-up grants/loans. In addition, municipalities expedite the planning approval process and encourage private developers to join partnerships with city-owned or non-profit housing providers to build developments with varying degrees of affordable housing.\n\nEquity through Social Mix in Affordable Housing ‘Social mix’ refers to the integration of people of different social standing or identity. The term is used in relation to affordable housing and sustainable neighbourhoods to describe an environment where housing offers diverse opportunities in terms of types, tenure, costs and design to respond to a diversity of needs (Galster, 2013). In many European countries, social mix through the planning process is a normative requirement, specifying targets of 20–25% affordable rental housing as a desirable tenure mix to bring a mix of people together by offering housing for a range of income levels in a single development or in neighbourhood (Scanlon,\n\nAffordable Housing 5\n\nWhitehead & Arrigoitia, 2014). The social mix approach aims at combating economic, social and ethnic segregation. It is justified on grounds of both economic efficiency—making society as a whole better-off by enhancing solidarity, labour productivity and community ­sustainability—and ​­ equity—improving ­ ​­ the life-chances ­ ​­ and social inclusion of disadvantaged groups ( Bolt & van Kempen, 2010). Social mix in North America became prominent in the 1970s as a response to growing social inequalities and stigma attached to large subsidised housing developments ( Kearns et al., 2013). This resulted in the revitalisation of public housing projects and their replacement with m ixedincome developments to promote social mix. Neighbourhood planning initiatives include urban regeneration, with an emphasis on housing mix, inclusion of rental housing through zoning and density bonusing policies, provision of public land for affordable rental housing, encouragement of public/private partnerships and rent supplements to allow local residents to stay-in-place (Galster, 2013; Smith, 2002). The pursuit of social mix is innovative in many contexts where the share of social and affordable housing is small. Inclusionary zoning in Canadian and US cities is used to a limited extent to guide the planning and development of inclusive and equitable neighbourhoods. Due to the dynamic nature of social mix, there are multiple ways it can be implemented at various scales, but the practice can be challenging (A rthurson, 2010; Thurber, Bohmann & Heflinger, 2018). Social mix can take place in a building, on a street, in a block or in a neighbourhood. Some of the best practices include making the difference between low-income and market housing non-existent, using common spaces to promote interaction between residents, and minimising the impacts of displacement during changes within existing communities.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability through Design Affordable housing partnerships through PPNP collaboration in cities are used as a social planning strategy to address the shortage of affordable rental housing, foster social mix and regenerate brownfield sites ( Katz, 2004). Notwithstanding the complexities of these collaborations, they provide critical opportunities to improve the built environment through coordinated investment in infrastructure, development of a variety of housing types, ownership opportunities (social and modest market rental housing and affordable homeownership) and investment in neighbourhood amenities, transit and retail ( Ramzanpour & Noutaghani, 2019). Such large-scale redevelopment projects bring brownfield city sites back to life, creating new attractive neighbourhoods inspired by sustainability plans, but present significant challenges ( Bond, Sautkina & Kearns, 2011). While residential intensification and planning strategies enhance the quality of built form and encourage higher- density mixed-use developments, the provision of quality affordable housing is essential to maintain diversity of residents and social mix ( Karakusevic & Batchelor, 2018). The creation of m ixed-income, mixed-tenure neighbourhoods depends on the plans, but also on the successful PPNP partnerships for plan implementation. In many contexts, different systems promote energy-efficient design, smart communities and the use of strategies to enhance environmental sustainability. Partnership projects for mixedincome integrated housing development often comply with, or even lead in terms of performance related to smart location and access, street pattern and design, and the use of green technology and building techniques. The green stamp of approval, while rigorous in terms of smart, green and well- designed neighbourhoods, does not really emphasise housing affordability, so these examples are pushing the envelope in terms of social integration by design ( Tsenkova, 2014). The overall goal of mixed-income housing is to establish better quality of life and adequate living conditions for all residents ( Bailey et al., 2006). To understand successful mixed-income affordable housing, we have adopted a conceptual framework that focuses on\n\n6 Sasha Tsenkova\n\n­ The built environment has an important impact on place-based outcomes, defining neighbourhood qualities, types of housing, density of urban form, amenities and access to common spaces and services ( parks, schools, transit). While such qualities of the built environment have been a significant focus of housing policies, the evidence of how design impacts m ixed-income housing to achieve good people-based outcomes is less conclusive ( Bond, Soutkina & Kearns, 2011). Within the planning and design profession, place-based outcomes are often easier to influence, but the social impact on residents remains limited. Research recognises that peoplerelated outcomes are about access to adequate housing, but also about social development, wellbeing and opportunities for civic participation ( Joseph, Chaskin & Webber, 2007). The case studies in this book deliver a strong message that excellence by design is critical for the quality of affordable housing and the well-being of its residents.\n\n­Planning-Design-Policy ­​­­ ​­ Nexus A final concept in the book is related to the planning-design-policy nexus (Legacy, Davidson & Liu, 2016). Nexus thinking transcends traditional policy and decision-making silos and develops approaches that build synergies across these sectors (Sharmina et al., 2016). Partnerships for affordable housing in cities are indeed very diverse multi-sectoral collaborations that leverage real estate market pressures to promote affordability goals and social mix. Cities often take the lead in managing the planning-design-policy nexus as neighbourhood rebuilding takes decades and shifting the responsibility to private developers might not work, particularly in the context of gentrification and displacement of lower-income residents. Partnerships need robust and sustained financial support, alignment of planning policies and institutional commitment to increase the supply of affordable rental housing. Such complexity by design makes statements on ‘what works’ and ‘what does not’ challenging and illustrates the interdependent nature of resilience at the nexus, raising the fundamental questions how policy might enable systemic resilience. Each city will need to develop its own successful model, based on resilience of the planning-design-policy nexus for affordable housing to respond to growing affordability pressures while emphasising diversity and social mix.\n\nMain Themes in the Book Building on the success of a three-year collaborative research project, the Cities and Affordable Housing book brings forward evidence-based research on what works and what does not work and how to move forward. Established scholars, planners and housing experts have collaborated to explore planning, policy and design innovation in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Toronto, Montréal, New York, Boston, Washington DC, Cleveland, Seattle, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Vienna. The narratives are multidisciplinary, unique and richly illustrated. The chapters are organised around five themes explored through case studies, comparative research, critical reflections on innovative models and practices and evidence-based design work. The following sections highlight important issues addressed in each thematic cluster. 1.\n\nCities and Affordable Housing. How to implement new planning and design strategies for mixed-income affordable housing in cities? How to mobilise the network of public, private and non-profit organisations, as well as the local communities, to support reforms for affordable housing partnerships? The development of partnerships requires funding, expertise, capacity and effective management of the interdependence between organisations\n\nAffordable Housing 7\n\nto deliver affordable homes (Tsenkova, 2019) and adapt to risks (Gilbert, 2016). The contributions in this section include best practices of city-led strategies that impact place-based outcomes—the mix of housing types, access to land and integration in the neighbourhood ( Thurber, Bohmann & Heflinger, 2018). La Ferrière explores the implementation of different initiatives to grow social and community housing in Montréal, and the success of an inclusionary strategy to support mixed-income neighbourhoods. Bond reviews planning tools to foster m ixed-i ncome communities and to provide a range of new affordable homes that meet the needs of those who live and work in Vancouver. Woodgate, Goldstein and Noble explore the affordable housing transformation in Calgary, with a strong emphasis on partnerships and collaboration to deliver tangible results. A nderson-Baron and Kjenner emphasise the role of the City of Edmonton as an enabler of affordable housing for over six decades, leveraging the capacity of diverse partners, using proactive policy development, planning tools and a unique regulatory approach to increase access to adequate and affordable housing choices. Gadon’s contribution, featuring the experience of Toronto, focuses on leveraging public land for affordable housing development through a range of public/ private/non-profit ­­ ​­ housing partnerships. 2.\n\nMixed-Income Housing and Community Building. ­City-led ​­ strategies for mixed­ ​ income housing employ various policy instruments to implement transformation ( Ramzanpour & Nourtaghani, 2019). Evidence documents that m ixed-income development counteracts the negative effects of social isolation and concentration of inner-city poverty and promotes increased mobility among low-income residents ( Joseph, Chaskin & Webber, 2007). Building on the political economy of place argument, the chapters address the successes and failures of policy instruments—regulation, resources, institutional capacity and network building—to ensure more efficient and effective implementation of mixed-income housing models (A rthurson, 2010; Atkinson & Kintrea, 2001). Shomon Shamsuddin presents a conceptual framework for understanding mixed-income housing and illustrates how variations manifest in neighbourhoods. Hirsch, Joseph and Khare explore mixed-income public housing transformation in San Francisco and Washington DC. They examine the tensions and trade-offs of transforming public housing in these city-led initiatives and identify key implications for success in future equity-oriented mixed-income efforts. Dauphin and Schwoerer from Paris Habitat—the largest social housing provider in Paris—present an award-winning design of a new mixed-income, mixedtenure neighbourhood. The model capitalises on a robust system of support in the French social housing system while illustrating opportunities for sustainable adaptive reuse of heritage resources. Vincent Tong discusses challenges and opportunities in the redevelopment of Regent Park—the largest public housing in Toronto— set to deliver 4,805 rental replacement units on 87 hectares of land. After 12 years of revitalisation through mixed-income opportunities, the results illustrate important lessons for cities developing inclusive social housing communities.\n\n3.\n\nAffordable Housing Partnerships in Practice. How to implement new partnership models for affordable housing to increase its supply? What are the models of these collaborations? What is the strategic role of municipalities? While there is a common mandate to provide housing that is affordable, the definitions and criteria for allocation and eligibility, governance and management policies, and typologies of housing forms vary widely ( Joseph & Khare, 2020). Socially owned housing managed by non-profit, private and community-based organisations in ‘ hybrid’ forms in cities is a viable model of\n\n8 Sasha Tsenkova\n\n­\n\n­ ​­ Schwartz and Tsenkova review the mixed-income housing supported through a variety of housing plans in New York City. Such interventions build upon a strong political commitment to affordable rental housing since the 1980s, supportive policy environment and robust institutional partnerships with non-profits and private sector providers. Kath Scanlon explores how London deals with its growing affordable housing challenge through partnerships. New affordable housing is supplied by housing associations or by for-profit developers, who are required to build affordable homes as a condition of planning permission. Tsenkova’s chapter documents patterns of resilience of social housing systems in Vienna, Amsterdam and Copenhagen. The research indicates that resilience is attributed to the robustness and resourcefulness of social housing institutions, but also to sustained and more coherent policy intervention that supports partnerships and neighbourhood rebuilding through social mix. 4.\n\nDesign Innovation for Affordable Housing. How to support social mix and community building through better planning and design of affordable housing projects? The built form and spatial patterns of affordable housing use planning and design strategies to facilitate social mix and integration in communities (Ramzanpour & Nourtaghani, 2019). What design strategies ensure that affordable is well integrated in terms of design, built form and public spaces? The contributions focus on design innovation to support people-based outcomes—healthy and sustainable housing—but also on opportunities for community integration, diversity and social inclusion. Friedman advances the concept of flexible design in affordable housing, its design principles and application in the marketplace. Good-quality design in affordable and social housing is a critical component for a successful development. Avenier and Tsenkova illustrate innovative design strategies to improve the quality, functionality, asset value and acceptance of affordable housing using award-w inning projects from Paris. In Europe, a new generation of architectural practices is transforming social housing across cities. Karakusevic explores how design changes the housing estates in Rotterdam and contributes to social mixing of generations, languages and cultures in Vienna. The case studies in London explore the integration of high-quality council housing in city’s communities. Atteveld and Liesker illustrate how social housing projects in Amsterdam and Haarlem respond to the needs of residents through a variety of design strategies.\n\n5.\n\nPolicy Design for Affordable Housing. How to design policy to develop partnerships for affordable rental housing: rethinking the role of regulation, finance and resources to deliver results? Public authorities employ various policy instruments (fiscal, financial, regulatory) to implement urban transformation (Gilbert, 2016; Tsenkova, 2021). In an era of fiscal austerity, public investment in social housing has declined. In its place has come a wide range of innovations in public/private approaches to funding private rental and nonprofit housing, complemented with planning instruments with varying capacities to address the affordability gap (van Bortel et al., 2019). What are the shifts in the availability of demand- and supply-support for affordable housing and what experiences can be effectively transferred to other institutional environments? What is the critical role of private rental housing for socially inclusive cities and neighbourhoods?\n\nAffordable Housing 9\n\nHaffner explores the pathways of Dutch and German housing policies that have resulted in different models of affordable rental housing. While the Netherlands has the largest social rental sector in the Western world, Germany has produced one of the largest private rental sectors in Europe where some suppliers are temporarily subsidised. Even though the systems of social renting are different, both countries have moved to locally controlled housing policy. David Hulchanski reviews the private rental housing in Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver and its prospects to provide adequate and affordable housing. The arguments illustrate the importance of path- dependent housing policies and their potential contribution to a more inclusive and responsive housing system. Severson and Vos focus on an important policy lens for social and affordable housing that centres on social sustainability. They develop a framework linked to equity, inclusion, security and resiliency and operationalise it for housing providers so that they can manage the process in a coherent way.\n\nConcluding Comments The contributions in Cities and Affordable Housing address issues of fundamental importance to the future of cities. They provide a synthesis of academic knowledge and innovative planning and design practice on the themes of affordable housing partnerships for m ixedincome, socially inclusive neighbourhoods as a model to rebuild cities. The book is the result of a three-year collaborative research project at the University of Calgary. Launched in 2018, the Affordable Housing Research Initiative aims to broker new knowledge, foster partnerships with industry and communities and advocate for action. It has resulted in two international conferences, public events and design exhibitions that explore strategies to create m ixed-i ncome affordable housing in compact, connected urban development. Global in scope, it has delivered rigorous research results available through a knowledge hub as a resource for students, planners, architects, developers, community activists and politicians, widely available to everyone (https://sapl.ucalgary.ca/labs/cities/housing-futures). ­ ­ ­ ­ ­­ ​­ This first action- based network received Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation President’s Award for Best Housing Research in 2019, recognising its innovative approach and the leadership of Dr Tsenkova ( F igure 1.1). Access to affordable housing in cities is of paramount importance in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring its significance for public health and urban resilience. The thematic emphasis on housing policy, urban planning and design contributes to multidisciplinary, systematic comparative perspective on the future of affordable housing that will benefit academics and practitioners. The results presented in this edited volume go a long way in disseminating evidence-based work of housing researchers, designers and policy-m akers of fundamental importance for the social and economic well-being of urban residents. The book empowers practitioners, planners and community leaders through compelling narratives, critical reflections on good practices, design strategies and evidence-based approaches to affordable housing. Such call for action builds capacity for change and mobilises support for more equitable, inclusive and competitive cities.\n\nAcknowledgements The financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Foundation of Canada for this research is acknowledged.\n\nContributors to the Affordable Housing Research Initiative.\n\nSource: Sasha Tsenkova.\n\n­FIGURE 1.1\n\n10 Sasha Tsenkova\n\nAffordable Housing 11\n\nReferences Angel, S.

Along with densely built and lively central neighbourhoods, a thriving cultural scene and a rich historical heritage, affordable housing has been a major component of the Montréal quality of life. Steadfast efforts by the City and its partners have contributed strongly to this by supporting the development and preservation of a diversified and affordable housing stock. Some figures are revealing: since 2002,1 the City’s financial assistance programmes have led to the creation of close to 20,000 social and community housing units, the renovation of more than 35,000 private affordable housing units and the negotiation of inclusionary agreements with real estate developers calling for the construction of thousands of affordable residential units. The City did not act alone. The production of affordable housing in Montréal stems from a true ecosystem, where City action, tangible government support and private and community partners that play a key role in the development of projects are held together by a resilient social consensus. The word “ecosystem” is used deliberately, as all these elements interact closely. Affordable housing targets have been embedded in Montréal’s urban planning schemes for more than two decades. This chapter outlines the strategies put forth to turn these ambitions into reality.\n\nThree Major Issues Sustainable and Balanced Growth Key metrics defining demographics, housing typologies and availability of social housing in Montréal and its agglomeration are presented in Box 2.1. Like many other large cities, Montréal has seen its population share diminish within the region under the effect of urban sprawl. While the phenomenon raises major environmental issues, it also poses the risk of demographic imbalance by drawing cohorts of young families outside of the City. Each year, Montréal sees about 20,000 people – essentially from young m iddle-class households – move to outlying suburban municipalities (international immigration and natural growth currently compensate for these losses). This constitutes a lifestyle choice for some families, but for many others the decisive DOI: 10.4324/9781003172949-2\n\n16 Suzanne LaFerrière\n\nBOX 2.1: KEY STATISTICS ON POPULATION AND HOUSING IN MONTRÉAL* Population • 1.74 million / 779,800 households Economic and social profile • ­Single-person ​­ households: 41% • Households with children: 33% (with children under 18: 23%) • 29.5% of households below the low-income cutoff Urban profile • One in five dwelling units built before 1945 • ­Medium-​­ to ­high-density neighbourhoods ​­ • 39% of dwelling units in “plexes”, prevalent in central neighbourhoods Mix of multi-unit rental buildings and single-family properties in peripheral sectors • Housing stock • 63% occupied by tenants (493,400 households) • Social housing (all types): 12% of the rental stock (7% of total stock). Social housing stock** Total: 61,100 units • 21,600 HLM units (public, ­ ­rent- geared-to-income) ​­ • 6,900 below-market rent units owned by para-municipal corporations • 32,600 units owned by non-profit organizations (NPOs) and cooperatives *City of Montréal territory **Montréal Agglomeration: includes Montréal (1.7 million population) and 15 other ­municipalities (0.3 ­ million).

Moreover, new production of residential units on the City’s territory is largely geared towards small units, which do not meet all the needs and expectations of families.\n\nA Significant Rental Stock The second issue concerns the maintenance of the rental stock – a major factor in a city where two out of three households are tenants. Montréal’s diversified rental stock includes a vast offer of “plexes” – which are coveted in neighbourhoods undergoing gentrification – as well as a small but growing number of residential towers. There is also an important pool of multi-unit residential buildings constructed at the height of the demographic boom, from the 1950s to the 1970s, which today house a significant proportion of the new immigrant households. Even\n\nMontréal: Building an Inclusive City 17\n\nthough Montréal’s rental stock, in general, is of good quality, there is cause for concern in some areas, faced with the combined challenges of growing poverty, deteriorating or even unsanitary buildings and underinvestment by property owners. In addition, observers note an erosion of the rental stock in central neighbourhoods, reflecting the trend towards conversion to coownership and the increasing presence of tourist rentals.\n\nSocial Needs The third issue concerns clients for whom the market offers no adequate options. In spite of its reputation for affordability, Montréal has close to 100,000 tenant households that earmark 50% or more of their income to rent, most of them living on very low income. The waiting list for HLMs (public ­ rent-geared-to-income ­ ­​­­ ­​­­ ​­ housing) steadily remains around 23,000–25,000 ­ ​­ households. Against this background, some populations encounter specific difficulties. Such is the case for large families confronted with a chronic shortage of suitable affordable rentals. Montréal also faces significant homelessness issues: in addition to the “visible” homelessness observed on the streets and in shelters, a growing number of neighbourhoods are home to a pool of vulnerable people having to cope with social isolation and persistent residential instability.2\n\nAffordable Housing Development Strategies The City has a number of housing tools at its disposal to respond to these demographic, economic and social challenges. Two in particular have had structuring impacts on affordable housing delivery. For one, the City has steadily invested in financial assistance programmes to stimulate and steer development, an approach that gives community partners clear and predictable signals. Second, the City has developed an incentive strategy – non-regulatory at the outset – to promote the introduction of affordable housing ( both social and private) in real estate projects.\n\nFinancial Assistance Programmes When the federal government stopped funding social housing development in the 1990s, the City joined forces with various civil society actors who were calling on the Québec government to take action. The City’s proposal (“Résolution Montréal”, adopted by city council in 1994) paved the way for shared-cost programmes and served as a starting point for the Société d’habitation du Québec (SHQ – the provincial housing corporation) to develop a new generation of social housing. The current AccèsLogis programme was created in 1996. AccèsLogis is open to both the non-profit sector (cooperatives and non-profit housing corporations) and municipal housing corporations. It incorporates a form of social mix by providing residential units with rents slightly below-market rates, with added rent supplements for low-income households. Projects for families or seniors may offer from 20% to 50% of their units with rent supplements. The programme also includes a component adapted to projects for vulnerable individuals, under which 100% of residential units can receive rent assistance. The programme’s funding structure, as established by the SHQ, is based on contributions respecting the capacity and jurisdiction of funding sources. The SHQ, which is part of Québec’s social and redistributive policies, therefore provides three-quarters of AccèsLogis programme subsidies, while the “community” (generally the municipalities) provides the rest.3 The creation of the AccèsLogis programme in 1996 coincided with a round of talks between Montréal and the Québec governments, focusing on neighbourhoods particularly hard hit by deindustrialization, where the built environment had deteriorated to alarming levels. Working\n\n18 Suzanne LaFerrière\n\nwith community partners in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district and with City experts, the SHQ designed a new financing framework intended to revitalize neighbourhoods, which gave Montréal and other urban centres in Québec the ability to develop local housing programmes within broad provincial guidelines. Now known as the Programme Rénovation Québec (PRQ), this framework has made it possible for Montréal to identify and target key areas in need of assistance, whether through renovation grants for private projects, subsidies for residential demolition or reconstruction work, homeowner assistance or other initiatives. Programme costs are split evenly between Montréal and the SHQ, in line with the programme’s impacts on multiple municipal issues (sanitation, maintenance of property values, revitalization, etc.). With the creation of those two major programmes – AccèsLogis for social and community housing and the PRQ for the private housing stock – the SHQ delegated powers to the City, which became responsible for managing the bulk of provincial housing programmes on the Montréal territory.\n\nA Regional Cost-Sharing Mechanism for Social Housing HLM units (public ­ ­rent-geared-to-income ­​­­ ­​­­ ​­ housing), which stem from tripartite (Canada­­ ­​ ­­Québec-cities) ​­ agreements, and AccèsLogis projects financed by the SHQ and cities, were, and to this day remain, unequally distributed across the metropolitan region. The financial impact exerted by social housing on municipal budgets thus varies considerably from one municipality to another. In 2001, as part of w ide-ranging municipal reforms, the Québec government sought to correct this situation, which was weighing on cities, particularly Montréal where the concentration of social and community housing was highest. As the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal (CMM), a regional planning body, was created, it was mandated to manage a municipal costsharing mechanism for social housing.4 The 82 municipalities (Figure 2.1) that make up the CMM remit an annual contribution in proportion to their respective fiscal capacity, regardless of whether or not they have social housing within their municipal limits. In exchange, the funds collected are earmarked for the reimbursement of the share paid by the cities to social housing programmes set out under law (Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, 2015). Thus, Montréal provides about half of the contributions made to the CMM,5 but receives, depending on the year, between 70% and 80% of the reimbursements meted out. In 2017, for example, the City contributed a share of about $24 million to the CMM, but in exchange received reimbursements totalling $39 million for expenses incurred under the AccèsLogis and rent supplement programmes, and for the HLM housing stock. By creating this mechanism, the legislator sought to help Montréal as well as encourage suburban municipalities with little or no social housing to welcome projects and contribute to a greater geographical distribution thereof (Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, 2015). This effect is currently observed for the most part in municipalities bordering Montréal, where social housing stock already exists, but other cities are showing growing interest as well.\n\nDelivering Social and Community Housing While it is up to the cities to determine land use development guidelines, municipal services, conversely, seldom have the agility required to operate effectively and in a timely fashion on the real estate market, notably because the announcement of a municipal intention can have a hardening effect on prices and sales conditions.\n\nMontréal: Building an Inclusive City 19\n\n­FIGURE 2.1 Montréal\n\nand Metropolitan Area.\n\nSource: City of Montréal.\n\nIn Montréal and elsewhere in Québec, the development of social and community housing projects is thus overseen by social economy organizations specializing in housing called Groupes de ressources techniques (GRT). Four such technical resource groups are accredited across Montréal. Their creation dates back to the 1970s, when the SHQ supported their development to ensure that federal funds then available could be used by cooperative projects and non-profit housing corporations in Québec.6 GRTs identify opportunities on the market, negotiate purchase offers and establish ties with organizations or citizen groups interested in developing housing projects. GRTs also coordinate the multiple inputs needed for projects (i.e. the work of architects, engineers, soil analysis, etc.) and can streamline projects to meet the requirements of financial assistance programmes. The increasing complexity of urban projects has brought the City to require that all projects submitted under social and community housing programmes involve a GRT. Figure 2.2 illustrates three examples: Coopérative Station 1 (74 family units in former electric station, ­Rosemont-Petite-Patrie ­​­­ ​­ borough), Centre Yee-Kang ­ ​­ (84 ­ units for seniors. Ville-Marie borough) and Coopérative Radar (47 units, Ville-Marie borough). Upstream of GRTs, several networks of community organizations are also mobilized. These include some 30 neighbourhood roundtables and multiple other stakeholders that provide assistance to a wide gamut of clienteles. These community partners help identify issues, work with boroughs to set out local development targets and priorities and play a role in consolidating a social consensus on the importance of affordable housing. Far from being peripheral actors, community organizations are an intrinsic part of the affordable housing ecosystem.\n\n20 Suzanne LaFerrière\n\n­FIGURE 2.2 Social\n\nand Community Housing Projects in Central Neighbourhoods.\n\nUrban Planning and the Inclusionary Strategy From 1990 to 1992, in the wake of a sweeping modernization process within the municipal administration, Montréal adopted major urban planning tools, including a public consultation policy, a housing policy and the first Master Plan (plan ­ d’urbanisme) of the city and boroughs. Today, the City’s objectives and targets pertaining to housing are enshrined in the agglomeration’s Schéma d’aménagement et de développement and in the Master Plan. Two key ideas have been consistently put forth in the Master Plan from the outset: the notion of preserving or creating “complete” and lively neighbourhoods that ensure the presence of green spaces as well as public and commercial services integrated into residential areas, and the objective of ensuring a diversified residential offer that includes an affordable housing component. In response to a serious shortage of rental housing and the unprecedented social crisis that ensued,7 the 2004 Master Plan set out an objective whereby affordable products would account for 30% of residential housing starts. The following year, to lend substance to this objective, the City launched its Strategy for the inclusion of affordable housing in new residential projects. The Strategy includes two elements. First, it establishes overall targets for housing starts to include 15% social housing and 15% private affordable units; these general guidelines are meant to inform the work of boroughs and developers. Second, it outlines a discussion mechanism for use with real estate developers, aimed at ensuring that their projects feature an affordable component (City of Montréal, 2005). It is important to note that under Québec’s pre-2017 legal framework, cities did not have the power to require that developers integrate specific types of housing or clients. From the outset, therefore, Montréal’s Inclusion Strategy was incentive-based and geared specifically to private residential projects in the following situations: • •\n\nprojects developed on municipal lots or surplus government lands ceded for development; projects calling for 200 units or more (this threshold was later reduced to 100 units), which require major exemptions to urban planning or zoning regulations.\n\nIn the case of large-scale urban projects, the Strategy is implemented by the central municipal administration, while boroughs are involved in other projects (urban planning powers are in large part devolved to the boroughs). In practice, the social or private affordable housing ratios\n\nMontréal: Building an Inclusive City 21\n\nvary, depending on a project’s characteristics, but the general trend, from the outset, has been to apply the 15/15 formula as proposed. While a few boroughs have not implemented the Strategy, others have put it in practice vigorously, with some demanding a ratio of 20% of social housing, together with an equal proportion of private affordable housing units (City of Montréal, 2020). Figure 2.3 illustrates projects on the site du Nouveau-Havre with private housing ( left) and a social housing component (right). Coopérative des Bassins is a development with 182 units. The Les Tanneries project in Le Sud- Ouest, presented in Figure 2.4, was developed by two para-municipal corporations. Office municipal d’habitation de Montréal provided 67 social housing units and Société de développement et d’habitation de Montréal provided 143 affordable condominiums. When it put forward its Inclusion Strategy, the municipal administration commissioned studies to identify the optimal conditions for the creation of mixed-income developments. Specifically, these studies concerned profitability thresholds for projects, as well as costs associated with the introduction of affordable components. Residential market studies made it possible to establish guidelines based on geographical sectors, defining what constitutes an affordable housing unit (co-ownership or rental). Focus groups were also held with developers. At the City’s request, researchers also studied issues of cohabitation in various mixed-income development projects. Their observations of projects, completed in Québec, North America and Europe, played a key part in guiding development choices.8 Without being introduced in\n\n­FIGURE 2.3 Inclusionary\n\nAgreement Projects with Social and Private Units.\n\n22 Suzanne LaFerrière\n\n­FIGURE 2.4 ­Mixed-Income ​­\n\nProject with Two Para-municipal ­ ​­ Corporations.\n\nNote: Les Tanneries ( Borough: Le Sud- Ouest) was developed by Office municipal d’habitation de Montréal (67 social housing units) and Société de développement et d’habitation de Montréal (143 affordable condominiums). Source: Office municipal d’habitation de Montréal.\n\nthe form of regulations, three general principles were retained in the negotiation of inclusionary projects: 1. 2. 3.\n\nprojects should create a social continuum; situations presenting extreme income disparities should be avoided; the clear definition of public and private spaces should be encouraged as it fosters optimal and harmonious use of outdoor spaces; forced sociability (i.e. the integration of social housing in a private building) does not guarantee ­community-building; ​­ it is preferable to allow ­side-by-side ­​­­ ​­ cohabitation, in separate buildings, which gives occupants control over their environment (i.e. social and community housing as empowerment tools) and minimizes conflicts stemming from different lifestyles.\n\nIn addition, economic modelling showed that integrating social housing into a co-ownership complex could entail the risk of major financial pressures on the social housing component, thereby compromising its affordability and long-term financial viability. Since co-ownership contracts do not truly protect the social housing component against these risks, efforts have been made to avoid or limit co-ownership situations.\n\nMontréal: Building an Inclusive City 23\n\nBOX 2.2: INCLUSIONARY AGREEMENTS, 2006–2018 • •\n\n•\n\nMore than 70 inclusionary agreements signed Development potential of 45,000 residential units, including more than 6,500 social and community housing units, and close to 6,000 affordable co- ownership units and private rental units More than $22,000,000 has flowed through the inclusionary contribution fund.\n\nSource: City of Montréal, 2020.\n\nConcerning the creation of social housing within inclusionary agreements, three options are thus encouraged among developers: the on-site construction of a social housing building (which may take the form of a land sale with construction by a third party); the sale of off-site lands, with or without construction by the developer, in the same sector; and, in cases where inclusion is not possible or desirable, the payment of a financial contribution to the City.9 All sums collected are administered through an inclusionary contribution fund managed by the City; the amounts are earmarked to complete the financing of new projects in the borough where they were collected. The management of the contribution fund is subject to a detailed annual report tabled before City council (City of Montréal, 2018). Drawing parallels with some European countries, some researchers have viewed this strategy as a “population redistribution policy” intended to channel and control the presence of low-income populations. In fact, the Montréal initiative was designed exactly for opposite reasons. The Inclusion Strategy aims to open up new possibilities for the development of social and community housing across its territory, including central areas, in the context of a highly active real estate market where few land opportunities are available to non-profit developers. For the City of Montréal, the Strategy is part of an overall approach that recognizes the importance of city-wide affordable housing and guarantees a true social mix and an inclusive social climate.\n\nHome Ownership Programmes Montréal also introduced measures to assist households looking to buy property. In 2003, an initial home ownership financial assistance programme was developed as part of efforts to revitalize older industrial neighbourhoods. Historically, owners would occupy the ground floor of “plexes” in central areas, but as some sectors’ economy waned, absentee landlords became commonplace. The City therefore began offering financial assistance to homeowners seeking to move into targeted areas, as part of a global strategy intended to instil a sense of belonging and repair a fraying social fabric. This temporary programme has since been replaced by successive home ownership programmes, now expanded to include both first-time buyers and households that already own property. A perennial feature of the financial assistance programmes is that families with children benefit from increased financial aid. Surveys and studies show that the programmes frequently influence and accelerate the decision to purchase property in Montréal. More than 20,000 households have taken advantage of the home ownership programmes since they were first created. Montréal has also taken steps to directly support the construction of affordable co-ownerships in response to market conditions. During the housing shortage of the 2000s, assistance was\n\n24 Suzanne LaFerrière\n\nprovided in the form of direct subsidies. Over a ten-year period, developers of more than 7,500 affordable co-ownership units received funding from the PRQ shared-cost ­ ​­ programme. As market conditions evolved, this assistance was stopped, but new measures are presently under study in relation with the new inclusionary by-law set to take effect in 2021. Furthermore, the Société d’habitation et de développement de Montréal (SHDM), a paramunicipal corporation, has developed its own co-ownership construction programme in conjunction with City initiatives. Based on Toronto’s Access to Homes model, the Accès Condos programme oversees the development of private projects and offers purchase credits, making units accessible for a modest down payment. More than 4,000 units have been built as a result of this initiative since 2005. This programme does not benefit from direct municipal funding, but buyers of Accès Condos units are by and large eligible to receive municipal home ownership subsidies.\n\nExisting Housing Stock Finally, the municipality also leads interventions on the existing housing stock. As this text is primarily focused on development issues, this role will be discussed only briefly: •\n\n•\n\nresidential adaptation assistance programmes for individuals with physical limitations have made it possible to adapt nearly 5,000 residential units since 2002; these are provincial programmes managed by a specialized team from the City’s housing department; over time, the City has developed a wide range of tools to enforce by-laws concerning sanitation and safety in residential building. In addition to conducting building inspections, the City has the power to carry out work on unsanitary buildings on behalf of neglectful landlords and to include a notice on land titles as a warning to prospective buyers.\n\nNew Powers, New Issues and New Solutions Power Gains and Transfers In 2016, Montréal and the Québec governments signed the “Réflexe ­ Montréal” agreement, which recognizes the City’s special status of metropolis. This resulted in the transfer of housing responsibilities and budgets from the SHQ to the City in March 2018. The renewable five-year agreement provides for the annual transfer of an overall budget allowance from three programmes: AccèsLogis (social and community housing), Rénovation Québec ( housing improvement programme) and the residential adaptation assistance programme for individuals living with functional limitations. Montréal initially received 36% of the total Québec budget allotted to these programmes; the agreement calls for this share to increase each year until it reaches 40%. In 2018 and 2019, Montréal received $94 million and $103 million, respectively. The housing agreement also enables Montréal to restructure and develop programmes to better reflect the local priorities and specific conditions in the Montréal area. Recent years had been marked by a widening gap between Québec programme standards and Montréal’s actual project costs. As a result, social and community housing development had slowed considerably in Montréal and even threatened to come to a complete halt. After the agreement was signed, the City implemented the “AccèsLogis ­ Montréal” programme, an improved version of the AccèsLogis Québec funding model. Work has started on a second version to meet several challenges, including faster project delivery and improved follow-up of completed\n\nMontréal: Building an Inclusive City 25\n\nprojects. Similarly, the City has overhauled renovation assistance programmes and the residential adaptation assistance programme for individuals with functional limitations, to better adapt them to the unique situation of Montréal’s rental stock. In addition to the transfer agreement, Montréal was also granted new urban planning and housing powers. For example, the City now has the right of pre-emption, making it possible to designate, through by-laws, territories where any building or site being sold must be offered to the City first. Widely used in some European countries, this mechanism gives the City greater control over land development in sectors experiencing development or redevelopment challenges, while avoiding the complications and costs of expropriation. A major gain was made when Montréal – a long with other cities in Québec – a lso obtained the power to adopt legislation mandating the inclusion of social, affordable or family housing. To make this effective, the City submitted a by-law project for public consultation in 2019, after economic impact studies were conducted to assess the effects of various scenarios. The Diverse Metropolis By-law, which introduces territorial modulations and new rules for contributions, came into effect on April 1, 2021 (City of Montréal, 2021).\n\nChallenges Elected in November 2017, the Montréal administration has committed to develop 12,000 social, affordable and family housing units in the 2018–2021 period.10 The plan is intended to meet a wide array of needs, including those from families, seniors, students, individuals experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, indigenous and Inuit communities and many others. This ambitious initiative calls upon the entire range of the City’s housing programmes and tools, including social and community housing development programmes, the purchase and transfer of municipal land, funding for infrastructure costs, renovation assistance programmes (to preserve older social housing stock and affordable segments of private rental stock), home ownership programmes, as well as the contributions of para-municipal housing corporations to strategic projects (City of Montréal, 2021). One challenging aspect of the plan involves seeking new funding models for affordable housing. Work is needed to design a framework for affordable projects in a context where the future of the Québec AccesLogis social housing programme appears uncertain. As a first step, the City has set up a fund, with flexible guidelines designed to host and monitor pilot projects, an approach that allows to gather highly useful fi rst-hand information. Pursuing the work will eventually require a stable financial framework as well as fixed guidelines to ensure that objectives are being met. As initial projects have already shown, one obvious challenge will be to ensure long-term affordability. The City of Montréal can rightly be seen as a municipality that is actively engaged in improving the quality of life and housing conditions of its residents. Nevertheless, the substantial investments required to do so and the urgency of housing needs demand concerted action by the federal, provincial and municipal levels. Montréal thus continues to engage in active dialogue with Canada and Québec, making its voice heard as federal-pr"
