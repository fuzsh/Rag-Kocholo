With our online exhibitions we have had the honour of hosting world class images to further the reach of these inspiring artists.\n\nResearch 101\n\nIf you have enjoyed our Heroines Past archive and feel inspired to conduct your own research, take a look at our pdf by Historian Haley Drolet.\n\nPhotography & Protest\n\nBootcamp is back and this time we’re looking at the role of photography in protest!
