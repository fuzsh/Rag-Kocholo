Link to hours.\n\nA GREAT DAY: ON VIEW UNTIL MARCH 29\n\nLink to exhibit and video\n\nIn 1958, Art Kane (1925–1995) photographed fifty-seven jazz musicians spilling off a brownstone stoop in Harlem for an Esquire magazine issue about the evolution of the genre. Since the Harlem Renaissance, the neighborhood had been a notable center of the uniquely American sound of jazz. As his photograph—commonly referred to as “A Great Day in Harlem”—ingrained itself in our collective memory, countless “Great Day” homages were created to record other historic gatherings: A Great Day in Hollywood, . . . Philadelphia, . . . Kansas City, . . . Jersey, . . . Saint Paul, . . . Houston, . . . Spanish Harlem, and a Dutch version, A Great Day in Haarlem, among others.\n\nGordon Parks (1912–2006) visited this theme four decades after Kane, showcasing the importance of the brownstone at 17 East 126th Street. In 1995, Life magazine assembled ten of the twelve surviving musicians from Kane’s picture, and Parks photographed them standing where they had stood in 1958. The decrepit facade of the brownstone overwhelmed the silhouettes of the few elderly musicians, representing the end of the “Golden Age” of jazz that Kane had documented. The graffiti and cinder-blocked door and windows remind the viewer not just of the deleterious effects of time on people and structures, but of the evolution and gentrification of Harlem and the culture and music born from it. Three years after the Life photo, XXL magazine tapped Parks to return to 126th Street to photograph 177 hip-hop artists, producers, and influencers, who overflowed the stoop of number 17 to the two stoops on either side. The youthful bodies of a new genre’s golden age overtook the dilapidated brownstone, reclaiming the space for the next generation.\n\nAt the twentieth anniversary of A Great Day in Hip-Hop—and the sixtieth anniversary of Kane’s original photo—17 East 126th Street has been lovingly restored and continues to tell the story of the shifting look, feel, and sound of Harlem.\n\nJAMEL SHABAZZ: HONOR AND DIGNITY: APRIL 5 – JULY 22\n\nArtist Reception Friday, April 5th ● 6 to 8 p.m. (Remarks 7 p.m.)\n\nJamel Shabazz is one of New York’s most innovative street photographers. For the past forty years, he has documented the cultural vibrancy of the city’s black and brown communities. This exhibition offers a concise view of Shabazz’s wide-ranging work, from photographs of musicians and teenagers radiating with hip-hop style to members of the military and participants in religious and political gatherings.\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, Shabazz began photographing the streets of New York in 1980. The city was emerging from a challenging period: in the late 1970s, its economy was faltering, crime was on the rise, and many neighborhoods were physically deteriorating. Where some saw danger or decay, Shabazz saw an opportunity: to positively represent the vibrant street life and culture of black and Latinx communities. He has documented urban life ever since, “giving a voice to the often invisible and voiceless,” as he has said of his mission.\n\nShabazz’s keenly observed images—his attention to the details of fashion, deportment, and style, for example—celebrate the self-possession and cultural complexity of his subjects. Considering himself a social documentarian, he carries on the tradition of James Van Der Zee, Gordon Parks, and Leonard Freed, photographers who used their cameras to combat discrimination and stereotypes by illuminating the vitality and pride of their subjects, no matter the hardships or prejudice they faced.\n\n“As a socially conscious photographer, I strive to create images that show reality, provoke thought, and at the same time contribute to a visual record of time and history,” Shabazz has said of the social and political basis of his work. In the end, he sees the portrayal of the “dignity and honor of a people” as central to his artistic viewpoint and to “what I want my work to represent now and for future generations.” The work in this exhibition exemplifies this objective, shaped by the intelligence, grace, and empathy of Jamel Shabazz’s singular vision.\n\nAs a reminder, tomorrow you should arrive to class, camera in tow with self-portraits (on memory cards or external flash drives).\n\nYou have been asked to make two self-portraits: a passport style self-portrait (ideally – head and shoulders against a white or neutral colored wall) and a second, more creative, thought-out self-portrait. NO SELFIES, (Also, see horrific articles about selfie related injuries and death statistics at the bottom of this post).\n\nDuring class we will have open lab time to look/edit in Adobe Camera Raw/Bridge and process Raw Files before delving into Photoshop to work on the Zombie exercise.\n\nPlease check out articles at the bottom of this post. Moving ahead, they may be inspirational, interesting, or at the very least, give you some more insight into the selfie vs. the self portrait.\n\nLastly, responses for the Nature of Photographs are due tomorrow.\n\nPlease find a downloadable PDF of the assignment below:\n\nReading Response_Shore Purchase\n\nThe Un-Selfie: Taking Back the Self-Portrait\n\nTHE NEW YORKER: SEEING THEMSELVES: PHOTOGRAPHERS’ SELF-PORTRAITS\n\nBy Jessie Wender\n\n“There’s been a lot of talk about selfies recently. The Oxford Dictionaries named “selfie” the word of the year for 2013, and “Museum Selfie Day,” last month, encouraged museumgoers to take creative selfies in front of art. But what distinguishes a selfie from an artist’s self-portrait? A smartphone and a Tinder account is the easy answer, but, in general, we ask more from a self-portrait than we do from a selfie: more consideration, more composition, more psychological insight and aesthetic care. From family photographs to annual staged series and quirky snaps captured in a street windows, here is a selection of my favorite self-portraits.”\n\nSEEING THEMSELVES: PHOTOGRAPHERS’ SELF-PORTRAITS\n\nSELFIE GONE WRONG: WOMAN WHO CROSSED ZOO BARRIER TO TAKE PICTURE NEAR JAGUAR SURVIVES ATTACK\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/woman-who-crossed-zoo-barrier-take-selfie-jaguar-survives-attack-1357551\n\nMore than 250 people worldwide have died taking selfies, study finds\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/03/more-than-250-people-worldwide-have-died-taking-selfies-study-finds/?utm_term=.f26367b9dd5d\n\nAs a reminder, the Portrait or Landscape project is due tomorrow at 8:30 am. This project is worth a total of 100 possible points.\n\nThis means you must be ready to present your work at 8:30 am (having prior sent the project to marisa.scheinfeld@purchase.edu via www.wetransfer.com or by bringing JPEG or TIFF files on a flash/external hard drive.\n\nNo RAW files are acceptable as submitted work. Photographs should be processed in Camera Raw and saved as either JPEGS or TIFFs. Please remember part of your grade is to label your file name with the type of portrait or landscape (i.e.: environmental portrait.tif or goldenhour.jpg.). All files should be in one folder with your name on it.\n\nA critique will occur at the beginning of class. Arrival on time is also part of your grade as is critique participation.\n\nPlease see the full project guidelines here: Portrait or Landscape Assignment Guide\n\nAs mentioned in our previous class, Quiz 1 will also occur sometime tomorrow.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, email me.\n\nIn lieu of class being cancelled tomorrow, there are two power points you will be responsible for covering on your own, along with an assignment called 100 Photos, due next week, February 19.\n\nThe first powerpoint will go over digital file formats and the second will look at the various steps to take and factors to consider when making a photograph all the while considering the principles of design and basic photographic terminology.\n\nPlease navigate to “Weekly Schedule” and “Session #3” to find the day’s material.\n\nOn that page you will be able to download two power points:\n\nIntroduction to Camera Raw\n\n2. Photographic Composition & Elements of Design/ Learning to Make Photographs (Note: Please skip the 18-minute video in this Power Point entitled Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Decisive Moment‬. We will watch this together in another class.\n\nAfter spending some time going over each powerpoint, make sure your camera is set to capture images in the RAW file format and download the PDF of the homework assignment entitled “100 Photos.” Your assignment is to complete Parts I and II on the PDF. Parts III – IV will occur in class next week.\n\nI expect you to show up next week with your camera in tow and both the Manual 101 assignment (3 exposed photographs of one scene from last week) AND the above “100 Photos” assignment on your memory cards.\n\nRemember, shoot the 100 Photos assignment in RAW mode. This is essential as it will lead us into the digital lab next week where we will open up Photoshop’s image editing program called Camera RAW (which only processes RAW files). It is a fantastic and powerful program specifically designed for photographic editing and we will spend much of the class learning the basics of the program using the images shot from the 100 Photos assignment.\n\nIf you have ANY questions or concerns while going over the power points, setting your camera on RAW capture, or the homework itself, please email me."
