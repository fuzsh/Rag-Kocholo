He had recently completed filming John Huston's The Misfits. Production took much longer than planned because of delays caused by the film's other star, Marilyn Monroe. Gable, forced to sit around for days while the filming dragged on,volunteered to do many of his own stunts, including being dragged in the dust behind a wild horse in the 110-degree Nevada desert sun. The scene required several takes, leaving Gable bloodied and rope-burned. The physical strain took its toll on the actor. He had a mild heart attack two days after filming ended, and then seemed to be recuperate quickly. But, 10 days later, he died suddenly at his home. Gable had never quite recovered from the untimely death of his beloved third wife, actress Carole Lombard. His fifth wife, Kay, gave birth to his only child, a boy, four months after his death. Marilyn Monroe felt responsible for \"The King's\" death, and some critics speculated that her guilt over Gable's death may have contributed to her own suicide. Gable's list of film credits included Gone With the Wind, San Francisco, Mutiny on the Bounty, China Seas, Mogambo, Teacher's Pet, and his Oscar-winning performance in It Happened One Night.\n\nIn 1961, Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House for 17 years, dies at 79\n\nIn 1964, Albert Hay Malotte, composer, dies at 69\n\nIn 1964, John Emery, actor (Ship Ahoy, Kronos, Mademoiselle Fifi), dies at 59\n\nIn 1964, Piet Moeskops, Dutch world champion cyclist (1921-24, 26), dies at 71\n\nIn 1965, Alexander King, author (Jack Paar Show), dies at 66\n\nIn 1968, Greet Hofmans, faith healer of Dutch queen Juliana, dies at 74\n\nIn 1971, Charlie Dell, comedian, dies at 90\n\nIn 1971, Edward Sedgwick, director, dies of barbiturate overdose at 28\n\nIn 1972, Andrey Filippovich Pashchenko, composer, dies at 87\n\nIn 1973, Alan Watts, writer/popularizer of Zen, dies in Calif\n\nIn 1974, Walther Meissner, German physicist (Meissner Effect), dies at 91\n\nIn 1975, Ernst van Raalte, lawyer/minister-president, dies at 83\n\nIn 1976, Franz MT de Liage Bhl, German/Dutch assyriologist, dies at 94\n\nIn 1978, Claude Dauphin, French actor (Les Miserables, Mado), dies at 75\n\nIn 1978, Cornelis P \"Cor\" Brun, Dutch novelist (Sil), dies at 95\n\nIn 1980, Imogen Hassall, Countess of Cleavage (Carry on Lovng), suicide at 37\n\nIn 1981, Enid Markey, actress (Aunt Violet-Bringing Up Buddy) - \"Tarzan's First Jane\", dies at 85\n\nIn 1981, Morgan Conway, actor (Dick Tracy Detective), dies\n\nIn 1981, William Holden, actor (Network, Wild Bunch, Breezy), dies at 63\n\nIn 1982, Arthur Askey, British comedian, dies at 82\n\nIn 1985, John J Sparkmann, (Sen-D-Ala), dies at 85\n\nIn 1986, Siobhan McKenna, actress (Dr Zhivago, Hungry Hill), dies at 63\n\nIn 1988, Lotte Stam-Beese, German/Neth architect, dies at about 85\n\nIn 1991, Ralph Marrero, actor (Babe, Johnny Suede), dies in car accident at 33\n\nIn 1993, Evelyn Venable, model (Columbia Pictures logo), dies of cancer at 80\n\nIn 1993, Lucia Popp, Czech/Austria soprano (Vienna Opera), dies at 54\n\nIn 1994, Chester Dino Powers Valenti, singer/Songwriter with- Quicksilver Messenger Service dies\n\nIn 1994, Dan Smith, harmonica/gospel singer, dies at 83\n\nIn 1994, David Rayner, cyclist, dies\n\nIn 1994, Doris Speed, actress (Annie Walker in Coronation Street), dies at 95\n\nIn 1994, Harvey Watkins, gospel Singer, dies at 64\n\nIn 1994, John Boylan, US actor (Twin Peaks, Sleepless in Seattle), dies at 82\n\nIn 1995, Gwyn A Williams, historian/socialist, dies at 70\n\nIn 1995, Jack Finney, author (Body Snatchers), dies at 84\n\nIn 1996, George Byatt, playwright, dies at 73\n\nIn 1996, Jack Popplewell, composer/playwright, dies at 87\n\nIn 1996, John Reginald Bevins, politician, dies at 88\n\nIn 1997, George Petrie, actor (Honeymooners), dies on 85th birthday\n\nIn 1997, Georges Marchais, Sec Gen of French Communist Party (1972-94), dies\n\nIn 1997, Russ \"Mad Monk\" Meyer, pitcher (Phila Phillies), dies at 74.\n\nIn 1998, at age 85 of Hollywood songwriter and film producer Saul Chaplin, the man behind musicals such as An American in Paris and West Side Story.\n\nEvents That Occurred On The Day\n\nIn , Tiberius' triumphant procession through Rome after siege of GermanyIn 1380, French King Charles VI declares no taxes for everIn 1532, Pizarro captures Incan emperor Atahualpa after victory at CajamarcaIn 1572, Don Frederiks troops occupy and plunder ZutphenIn 1632, Battle of Lutzen: Sweden beats imperial armies under Von WallensteinIn 1676, The Nantucket Island Prison on Nantucket Island, located in the English colony of Massachusetts. Local authorities hire William Bunker to establish the first prison in the American colonies. For every year Bunker serves as a Prison Warden , the court agrees to pay him \"foeur pounds, halfe in wheat, the other in other graine.\" The necessity of a prison on Nantucket had been growing steadily since 1672, the year that the island's English residents, looking for an additional source of revenue, encouraged whaling men to settle on the island. Whales were abundant and could be caught close inshore, and soon Nantucket's residents had learned the tricks of the trade from their new settlers. By 1712, the coastal population of whales had greatly diminished, so the Nantucket islanders all whalers by now, took to the oceans in search of valuable spermwhales. One hundred years later, Nantucket was one of the Worlds greatest whaling centers and the third largest city in Massachusetts.In 1677, French troops occupy FreiburgIn 1683, Hendrik Casimir II of Nassau-Dietz marries Henritte AmaliaIn 1700, Monarch of Brandenburg becomes king of PrussiaIn 1750 Westminster Bridge is formally opened\n\nIn 1763, English journalist John Wilkes injured at duel\n\nIn 1764, Native Americans surrender to British in Indian War of Chief Pontiac\n\nIn 1771, West Indian Company & Amsterdam divide up Surinam\n\nIn 1776, First gun salute - for US Andrea Doria at Ft St Eustatius\n\nIn 1776, Hessians Capture Fort Washington During the Revolutionary War, Lieutenant General Wilhelm von Knyphausen and a force of 3,000 Hessian mercenaries lay siege to Fort Washington at dawn.

Oklahoma, with a name derived from the Choctaw Indian words \"okla,\" meaning people, and \"humma,\" meaning red, was first set aside as Indian Territory in 1834. By 1880, dozens of tribes,forced into relocation by European immigration and the U.S. government, had moved to the territory. In 1889, the federal government, under pressure by cattlemen, opened nearly two million acres in central Oklahoma for settlement. At noon on April 22, a pistol shot signaled the opening of the new land, and tens of thousands of people rushed to stake claims. Those who had already made illegal entry to beat the starting gun were called \"Sooners,\" hence Oklahoma's state nickname.
