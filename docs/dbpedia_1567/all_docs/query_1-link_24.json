        "text": "Details\n\n193 items\n\nArrangement is somewhat random\n\nLetters and love poems, kept private by Beese until her death, chronicling her relationship with Meyer. Includes ca. 74 letters from Meyer and ca. 34 from Beese (some of Beese's letters seem to be originals, suggesting that Meyer returned them to her) -- The correspondence documents their daily lives, both personal and professional, illuminating their emotions and personalities, their circle of friends (primarily Margret Mengel and Nina Balcerova), and their politics\n\nSome important events are described in detail: Meyer's dismissal from the Bauhaus-Dessau in 1930 for his political views and disputed connections with the German Communist Party; his attempts with Beese to enlist the help of others in his defense, particularly Czech writer Karel Teige (who had taught at Dessau) and Czech architect Bohuslav Fuchs (with whom Beese lived in 1930-1931); and his eventual move to Moscow. This material includes newspaper clippings and typescripts in German and Czech (the Czech sometimes accompanied by Beese's German translations) of articles written by Beese, Teige, Fuchs, and Meyer's students who defended his political views and his right to express them. Meyer's letters at this time also record his opinions and feelings about Bauhaus figures such as Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse. Beese notes her own problems getting a job in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1931 and visits by police who questioned her political activities\n\nThe birth in 1931 of their son Peter and his welfare is a frequent topic. In letters dated after 1932 when Meyer was in Moscow and traveling in the Soviet Union, he details his work with Soviet architects and planners on building new towns for GIPROGOR and technical schools for GIPROVTUZ. He also discusses his appointment as professor at VASI, the Moscow architecture and building institute. By November 1932, acrimonious letters from Meyer sound the end of the relationship\n\nThe majority of the ca. 55 photographs were taken by Beese and are of Meyer or of their son Peter when he was an infant and young child. There are also photos of Beese, Fuchs, and Stam\n\nBauhaus student and architect who was intimately involved with Hannes Meyer, Bauhaus director and architect, from 1928-1932. Beese met Meyer at the Bauhaus-Dessau while a student there in 1928; subsequently she worked in Meyer's Berlin office. Because they were usually apart, they wrote often. Their son Peter Beese was born in 1931. By 1933 Beese was involved with architect Mart Stam, whom she probably met while he was teaching at Dessau in 1928-1929; by 1937 they had married\n\nHolograph and typescript letters, postcards, typescripts, newspaper clippings, photographs, printed matter\n\nOpen for use by qualified researchers\n\nItem level inventory available in the repository\n\nRelated Resources"
