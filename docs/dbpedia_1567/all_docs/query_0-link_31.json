        "text": "Notes for semesters I, II, and IV, Series I.A. 1925-1933\n\nNotes for semesters I, II, and IV: 1925-1933\n\nContainer Summary: ca. 190 items\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nThe subseries contains annotated typescripts and manuscripts notes; all text is in German. The arrangement of the notes follows the order of pagination found on the items; however, the numbering is most likely not in Kandinsky's hand. The notes relate mainly to the courses Abstrakte Formelemente [Theory of Form] and Grundlehre [Preliminary Course] and focus on the graphic elements: line, point, plane, and composition, and on Kandinsky's color theory. Also present are notes related to Kandinsky's \"freie Malklasse\", a course which concentrated on painting not intended as applied art. Several notes are illustrated with geometrical drawings and diagrams, and include descriptions of class exercises and critical evaluations of work by specific students. Kandinsky frequently refers to art history and to current artistic trends in the visual and in the performing arts. Most of the notes are undated; some have dates of lectures and classes to which they relate. The frequent presence of several dates added in pencil indicates that Kandinsky frequently reused his notes between 1925 and 1933.\n\nWas - Wie - Was, 2 gleichzeitige Vorgänge seit Impressionisten\n\nScope and Contents note\n\n2 leaves: p. 37-39.
