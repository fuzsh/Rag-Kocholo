        "text": "In an unknown near future and past, a filmmaker is trying to retrace the steps of Silvia. “Who is Silvia? What is Silvia?” Silvia has gone missing. In this filmic reconstruction, Silvia drifts with the forest, attempting to attune with its temporalities. In a quest for co-existence, Silvia bridges the supposedly opposing world-views of ‘Sequency and Simultaneity’, presence and duration. At the borders of not only the forest but also of science, the destructive powers of a proprietarian society only obey the laws of succession. Here, the socialists plans of the post war era are being demolished and cleared for new and profitable housing. But in Silvia’s archive, city infrastructure and forest root systems are being integrated. Silvia’s recordings are cut in intervals where time itself becomes unstable. Through a numbering system of repeating patterns, progression is broken. Silvia has abandoned the society of ‘means to an end’. In this movement lays the path to un-build the walls that have infiltrated all aspects of this world. In the film there are excerpts by: Ursula K. Le Guin, The Author of the Acacia Seeds' and Other Extracts from the Journal of the Association of Therolinguistics and The Dispossessed, 1974. Walter Benjamin, Painting, or Signs and Marks, 1917. Una Canger, What the Eye Sees, 1986. Prints, photographs, drawings and architectural plans by among others: Florence Henri, Lotte Stam-Beese, Alma Buscher and Silvia.\n\nIn recent years, Pia Rönicke has been investigating different botanical collections that show traces of colonial and geopolitical conditions. She is in her work concerned with problems of space and spatial transformations. She is interested in the connection between workspace and filmic space, and how we conceive historical matters in relationship to our daily activities. Rönicke often works with archives and the practice of collecting is a recurring theme in her practice. She works with film, prints, sculptures and objects, which together builds narratives.

Sandra Schäfer juxtaposes August Sander's perspective with her own and contemporary view. For it is also about how a region, its landscape and agricultural use have changed over the course of time. In her artistic work, Schäfer is interested in the various contemporary witnesses and their entanglements: How do the relatives/portrait subjects speak about the (artistic/documentary) pictures by August Sander? What does it mean to hear the dialect that always also marks a class difference? What knowledge is there about the photographer and his approach? How does this differ from that of photo curators in the museum context? And what does it mean for the artist, who was born and raised there, to return to create this artistic work?\n\nThe artist Sandra Schäfer works with film and video installations. Therein she deals with processes of unfolding and rereading of documents, images, spatial narratives and performative gestures. Often her works are based on longer researches, in which she is concerned with the margins, gaps and discontinuities of our perception of history, political struggles, urban and geopolitical spaces. Her works were exhibited at 66th and 67th Berlinale (Forum Expanded), Berlin; Camera Austria, Graz; Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Siegen; Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt; mumok, Vienna; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Depo, Istanbul; La Virreina, Barcelona. Schäfer also is professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich and an associated member of the feminist film distributor Cinenova in London. She edited the books: Moments of Rupture: Space, Militancy & Film, Spector Books, Leipzig (2020), stagings. Kabul, Film & Production of Representation, b_books, Berlin (2009) and Kabul/ Teheran 1979ff. Filmlandschaften, Städte unter Stress und Migration, b_books, Berlin (2006, together with Jochen Becker and Madeleine Bernstorff).\n\nTaking as its starting point the Neolithic figurines found throughout the Danube region from Croatia to the Black Sea through Serbia, Romania, North Macedonia,Bulgaria and Greece Women Minor Speculations is part road trip, part time travel and part speculative fiction using fragments of time, archaeological fragments, sound fragments and imaginary audio files trying to weave a potential whole from many distinct parts. During a period of four years I collected materials in film, images, sounds, and text dealing with remains as evidential material, with landscapes as witnesses, with interwoven biographies of archaeologists, their objects and subjects of research (the figurines, the constellations, cement, gossip and songs) in an exploration of how real and unreal objects of material culture produce gendered interpretations, collisions and hallucinations of public accounts, using technologies of memory, data storage devices to fracture the official historical narrative through minor histories, minor narratives and minor speculations. Shot over a fiveyear period on 35mm, 16mm, digital Bolex, Digital 8, mobile phones and still cameras the film involves a tentative encounter of two female explorers in south eastern Europe meeting through materials and separated by 6000 years.\n\nNicole Hewitt is a visual artist working in film, video, installation, performance, spoken word and text. Her work has recently been shown at The Museum of Contemporary Art Zagreb, Pogon Centre for Independent Culture, Zagreb; Sonic Acts Academy, Amsterdam, The Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Rijeka; Invisible Savicenta – Savicenta; international festivals such as Days of Croatian Film, Hiroshima International Festival of Animation, International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Festival of New Film Split, Rencontres Internationales Paris/Berlin/Madrid, International Film Festival Rotterdam, EMAF, New Media Festival Seoul, Mumbai International Film Festival, Montreal International Festival of New Cinema and New Media, etc. Retrospectives of her film, video and animation work were parts of Holland International Animation Film Festival Utrecht (2007) and ANIMATEKA (2006), Nicole Hewitt, Museums Quartier Vienna, 2004; Nicole Hewitt, Galerija Nova, Zagreb, 2004; UrbanFestival, Zagreb, 2011; Spaport Biennial 2009/2010, Banja Luka; Women With Vision, Walker Art Centre, Minneapolis, 2008, Insert, Retrospective of Croatian Video Art, MSU, Zagreb, 2006; Here Tomorrow, MSU Zagreb, 2002., etc.). Hewitt is cofounder of the artist run collective Studio Pangolin , is part of the sound collective Soundspiels and teaches at The Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb. Hewitt lives and works in Zagreb and London.\n\n‘Where Lakes Once Had Water contemplates how the Earth is experienced and understood through different ontologies – ways of being, seeing, sensing, listening and thinking – that reverberate across art, Indigenous thought, science, ancient and modern cultures, and the non-human.’ Sonia Leber and David Chesworth travelled with a team of Earth and environmental scientists who are investigating changes in the climate, landscape and ecology over 130,000 years. Their journey took them to Australia’s Northern Territory, to spectacular yet challenging environments, from locations of long-term aridity to lush, green waterways. Where Lakes Once Had Water channels the experience, where Indigenous rangers, Elders and community members collaborate with scientists. Working across the ancient shorelines, everyone is receptive to the signs, signals and rhythms of the land. Meanwhile, non-human cohabitants continue their struggles for survival. Leber and Chesworth deploy video as a tool, scanning tree lines, erosions, termite mounds, and the effects of water, sun and fire. Their disquieting sound design encompasses natural and human-made sounds, and the hidden signals and energies that exist beyond human hearing. The project is a journey across audio-visual realms, scientific endeavour and Indigenous knowledge – a coalescence of efforts to understand the ancient land. \"Where Lakes Once Had Water\" was commissioned by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CABAH) in association with Bundanon. It was filmed on the lands and waters of the Mudburra, Marlinja, Jingili, Elliot, Jawoyn and Larrakia communities in Northern Territory, with additional filming and editing on Barkandji, Dharawal, Djabugay, Yidinji and Wurundjeri Country. University of Wollongong Art Collection, Australia.\n\nAustralian artists Sonia Leber and David Chesworth are known for their distinctive video, sound and architecture-based installations that are audible as much as visible. Leber and Chesworth’s works are speculative and archaeological, often involving communities and elaborated from research in places undergoing social, technological or local geological transformation. Their works emerge from the real but exist significantly in the realm of the imaginary, hinting at unseen forces and non-human perspectives. Leber and Chesworth’s artworks have been shown in the central exhibitions of the 56th Venice Biennale: All The World’s Futures (2015) and the 19th Biennale of Sydney: You Imagine What You Desire (2014). Solo exhibitions include What Listening Knows, Messums Wiltshire, UK (2021) and the survey exhibition Architecture Makes Us: Cinematic Visions of Sonia Leber & David Chesworth, Centre for Contemporary Photography, Melbourne, Australia (2018) touring to Griffith University Art Museum, Brisbane (2019) and UNSW Galleries, Sydney (2019).\n\nThe work is composed of two separate films followed by each other. Both films explore transcendental issues through archaeological and illegal excavations of tombs. \"After Life\" consists of a sequence of meditative short scenes picturing the ruins of a small Faliscan necropolis Cavone di Monte Li Santi in Italy and its surrounding natural elements. The rock-cut chamber tombs of the necropolis had been illegally excavated before they were archaeologically discovered in 2015 – a phenomenon still faced by many rural archaeological sites. At the center of \"Red Impasto Jar\" is a looted archaeological tomb object. In antiquity, the funeral was a significant ceremony where entombing of the body was just one component in the complex sequence of events. This ancient Faliscan tomb item dating back to the 6th century BCE was passed on to the archaeological museum (Mazzano Romano, Italy). The jar is radically altered and damaged by being cemented into the structures of a house as a decorative element. The film portrays the state of the pottery focusing on the detailed choreography and documentation of the object with a slow 360º rotation on a robust industrial motor against a monochromatic background.\n\nSound, perception and imagination are essential ingredients in the research and practice of Jonna Kina (b. 1984). Her work reveals the value of fictional viewpoints in non-fictional investigations. Kina’s works have been shown in the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum; Fondazione Pastificio Cerere, Rome; Dunkers Kulturhus, Helsingborg; Musée de l’Elysée, Lausanne; International Film Festival Rotterdam; Hasselblad Foundation, Gothenburg; Espoo Modern Art Museum EMMA; Kumu Art Museum, Tallinn and in Sara Hildén Art Museum, Tampere, among others. Kina has recently been awarded the Finnish Art Prize “Below Zero” (2018) and her film Arr. for a Scene was awarded as the “Best Nordic Short Film” at Nordisk Panorama Film Festival in Malmö (2017). She was also shortlisted for the VISIO Young Talent Acquisition Prize in Florence (2017).\n\nSoot Breath / Corpus Infinitum is a film dedicated to tenderness. It reproduces a radical sensibility learned from listening to the blues, from listening to skin, to heat, and from listening to echoes, listening itself. Soot Breath // Corpus Infinitum is a newly commissioned film and installation by Arjuna Neuman and Denise Ferreira da Silva. Against and instead of apprehension, it fosters an image of existence in which attention twins the gentleness of touch as recalled by haptic and sonic expressions.\n\nArjuna Neuman is an artist, filmmaker, and writer. As a writer he has published essays in Relief Press, Into the Pines Press, The Journal for New Writing, VIA Magazine, Concord, Art Voices, Flaunt, LEAP, Hearings Journal, and e- flux. He studied at California Institute of the Arts. He works with the essay form with a multi-perspectival and mobile approach where ‘essay’ is an inherently future-oriented and experimental mode, becoming the guiding principle for research and production, which shifts between the bodily, haptic, and affective through to the geopolitical, planetary and cosmological. Denise Ferreira da Silva is a practicing artist and an academic - Director and Professor at the Social Justice Institute-GRSJ at the University of British Columbia. She is the author of Toward a Global Idea of Race (2007), A Dívida Impagavel (2019), and co-editor of Race, Empire, and the Crisis of the Subprime (2013). Her several articles have been published in leading interdisciplinary journals, such as Social Text, Theory, Culture & Society, Social Identities, PhiloSOPHIA, Griffith Law Review, Theory & Event, The Black Scholar, to name a few. Her work addresses the ethico- political challenges of the global present. She is a member of several boards including Haus de Kulturen de Welt (Berlin), International Consortium for Critical Theory Programs and the journals Postmodern Culture, Social Identities, and Dark Matter.\n\n‘Agony to Ecstasy’ looks at the scope of the socio-addictive condition within Scottish people. It focuses on the relationship between pain and pleasure, between stress and relief and between entrapment and escape. The film in many ways, is a dissection of two spaces – euphoric clubbing and silent Scottish nature, offering a perspective on our need for salvation within both. Neurologically, there is very little difference between the brain addicted to something, as to when falling in love. As a result, the film fluctuates between these neurological and personal perspectives on addiction and connection – where their conflating and often paradoxical relationship are juxtaposed. The film is made with reflection as its key focus. Made during the middle of the first lockdown, it uses the collective state of withdrawal and loneliness to observe realities within clubs. A slow-motion strobe follows the film throughout, as a visual deconstruction of the joy, yet ghostly inhibition of the people in the shots. Vulnerability was key in Dej’s recollections – his words occupy the emotional worlds of mental health, stigma and the ecstasy of clubbing, without having a particular stance or opinion. Ultimately 'Agony to Ecstasy' looks beyond fixed stereotypes of addicts, and into the dependencies, shame and love between Scottish people.\n\nCal Mac is a visual artist working and living in Glasgow. Working between sculpture print and video, he explores themes of belonging and addiction through sociological, scientific and visual dialogues. His work often looks at clubbing and natural environments, to unravel truths about our current condition and need for connection. His work has been screened at Atlas Arts (skye), The Royal Scottish Academy (Edinburgh), Limerick Institute of Technology, and online for Lift off Festival, and Film and Video Umbrella. Following his first commission from Film and Video Umbrella in 2020, Mac has done residencies at Cove Park and Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop. In 2021 Mac was shortlisted for the Royal Scottish Academy Morton Award."
