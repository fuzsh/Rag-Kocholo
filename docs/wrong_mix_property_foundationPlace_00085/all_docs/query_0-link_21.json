        "text": "Keanu Reeves’ latest role is a dark one in the next installment of the Sonic films.\n\nKeanu Reeves Joins Sonic 3\n\nThe John Wick star will be voicing the popular Sonic character Shadow, multiple sources told The Hollywood Reporter Monday (April 15).\n\nThe news comes on the heels of a jam-packed CinemaCon presentation from Paramount last week when the studio debuted the first footage for Sonic 3. This included the revelation that Dr. Robotnik, played by Jim Carrey, was depressed and out of shape after the events of Sonic 2, but gets his groove back thanks to creating Shadow the Hedgehog, a character first introduced in the video games in 2001’s Sonic Adventure 2.\n\nReeves actually appeared in the Sonic franchise years before being cast as the popular antihero. Following the news of his casting announcement fans recalled the first film when Sonic spots Reeves on TV in the 1994 action-thriller Speed, to which he says: “Yes. Keanu! You are a national treasure.” The clip from the film has Reeves saying, “When I find you….” Dennis Hopper cuts him off and says: “Pop quiz, hot-shot: there’s a bomb on a bus.” Sonic repeats the line and gives a chef’s kiss to the “classic line.”\n\nThe first Sonic the Hedgehog debuted in 2020, making $319 million globally at the box office. As we previously reported, the film met a ton of heat when they first released the trailer.\n\nSonic 2 followed in 2022 and grossed $405 million globally. The second installment introduced Idris Elba as Knuckles the Echidna. Director Jeff Fowler is behind all three installments. Ben Schwartz will reprise his voice-acting role as Sonic opposite James Marsden and return as Tom Wachowski, Sonic’s human friend.\n\nReeves has a few more projects coming up. He’s set to star in Aziz Ansari’s directorial debut in the comedy Good Fortune, in which he plays a guardian angel named Gabriel who tries to help a financially struggling guy find purpose by switching his life with that of a rich dude, and it backfires. Ansari will also star in the film along with Seth Rogen, Keke Palmer, and Sandra Oh.\n\nThen, he will reprise his role in a cameo as John Wick in a spinoff titled John Wick Presents: Ballerina, starring Ana De Armas. The upcoming action thriller is scheduled to be released on June 6, 2025. In it, de Armas’ character is touted as “the new face of vengeance” when seeking retribution for those who killed her family and wrecking dudes via her hands, legs, and a flamethrower.\n\nSonic 3 is set to release in theaters on December 20, 2024.\n\nThe 5 Best Action Stars\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
