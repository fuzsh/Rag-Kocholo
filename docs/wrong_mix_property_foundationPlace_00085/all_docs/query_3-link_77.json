        "text": "Posted by Ra Moon\n\nThe Showtime limited series Your Honor is set and was filmed in New Orleans, boasting magnificent Crescent City filming locations. The second season was also shot partially in California.\n\nThis is the first series starring Bryan Cranston since Breaking Bad finished, and both thrillers have a lot in common.\n\nCranston plays judge Michael Desiato, whose son Adam (Hunter Doohan) accidentally runs over Rocco Baxter, the son of a New Orleans preeminent gangster.\n\nHere is our comprehensive spoiler-free guide to all the filming locations of Your Honor.

What bar is at the beginning of Episode 3?\n\n3- Aadrock83 - January 5, 2021 at 9:06 PM\n\nThis is amazing! Thank you. I’m planning a trip to cover this entire season of locations once the season wraps. This will be a HUGE help.\n\n4- NolaGirl13 - January 1, 2021 at 8:01 PM\n\nI’m actually from New Orleans, in love about 25 minutes away in Laplace currently. You have done a great job explaining these locations.\n\n5- MVM - February 21, 2021 at 5:23 PM\n\nHere is a correction for you! The Baxter House restaurant is actually The Rib Room at the Omni Royal Orleans on St. Louis. I believe the outside, hotel, and pool scenes are the Bourbon Orleans. Even the last scene in Chapter 10 is the Rib Room for sure because we have a wine cellar there that I can see in the background.\n\n6- Anonymous - April 30, 2021 at 6:33 PM\n\nI think the bad in episode 3 is Robert's Bar, next door to Frostop.\n\n7- Anonymous - Feb 18, 2023, 2:07 PM\n\nWhat was the filming location for the prison in this series? For example, season 2 episode 1?\n\n8- Anonymous - Mar 19, 2023, 12:32 PM\n\nWhat is the location of the coffee house with white tile walls, where they have two espressos, in the first or second episode? It looks like a restaurant on Magazine Street, closer to the quarter that I think was called Camisa‘s, but I could be wrong.\n\nRa Moon\n\nAtlas of Wonders is looking for wonderful Filming Locations all around the world.
