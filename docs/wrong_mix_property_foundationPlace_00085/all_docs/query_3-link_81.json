        "text": "Breaking Bad ended more than a decade ago, but rumors abound that a sequel is happening called The Way. So is there any truth to those claims?\n\nBreaking Bad is one of the most beloved TV shows of all-time, and up there with the likes of Mad Men, The Wire, and The Sopranos when it comes to greatest ever lists.\n\nThe show – which was the brainchild of Vince Gilligan – also spawned something of a shared universe, with sequel movie El Camino hitting Netflix, and prequel series Better Caul Saul every bit as good as its predecessor.\n\nNow, fans think a sequel series is in the works, titled The Way. But you can’t believe everything you read on the Internet, so here’s what we know…\n\nIs there a Breaking Bad sequel called The Way?\n\nNo, a Breaking Bad sequel titled The Way isn’t happening.\n\nThis is likely down to a fake trailer announcement racking up hundreds of likes on Facebook, which also follows another made-up sequel called The Path going viral with thousands of shares. These types of posts pop up all the time, leading to people tagging their friends in a rush of misled excitement – when there’s nothing to be hyped about at all.\n\nThere has only been one sequel to Breaking Bad: El Camino, with Aaron Paul reprising his role as Jesse. Of course, there’s also Better Call Saul, the spinoff exploring the rise of Slippin’ Jimmy and fall of Saul Goodman, which came to an end last year.\n\nWhile Gilligan initially said he was done with the Breaking Bad universe following the end of Better Call Saul, he then told Variety that he finds himself wondering about the lives of the show’s characters after the original finale.\n\n“Every now and then I find myself thinking about those characters, daydreaming about what would have happened to them. Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte are such wonderful people playing such interesting roles that I can’t help but want a happy ending for them,” he said.\n\n“When Breaking Bad ends, it’s not a very happy ending for those characters at all, but it is presented that their lives go on. I’d like to believe things get better for them. I’d hate the thought of Walt Jr. following in Walt’s footsteps in the crime business. That’s probably the kind of thing somebody will pitch 10 or 15 years from now — Walter Jr. as an Albuquerque crime lord succeeding where his father failed.\n\n“I could pretty much guarantee right now that I have no interest in seeing that happen. That’d be a sad tribute to the show. It’s fun thinking about what would happen to the characters, but it doesn’t rise to the level of, ‘Gee, I’d like to tell more about the story.’ But who knows, in a few years maybe.”"
