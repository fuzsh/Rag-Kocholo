        "text": "BRYAN-COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) - With the school year coming up, teachers are scrambling to get supplies, decorations, and tools ready for their students. To help local teachers with their needs, a group called Adopt A Teacher BCS decided to step in and volunteer to be by a teacher’s side for the entire school year.\n\nAdopt A Teacher began in 2022 by Megan Richards when she noticed how her own son’s teachers were struggling to find the money and time to gather what was needed for their classrooms, and she wanted to help. The first year Adopt A Teacher launched, there were a couple hundred people involved. Fast forward to now, there are more than 1,700 people in the Facebook group.\n\n“It’s typically one-to-one, and so they just adopt and provide support throughout the full year. It’s just a way for them to touch base and not just provide school supplies, but also to provide encouragement throughout the year,” Richards encouraged.\n\nAdoption kickoff is July 22, and teachers will post in the Facebook group a little bit about themselves a few days prior to that.\n\nThe teachers said they love receiving school supplies from donors, but what goes the extra mile is when helpers will send them notes of affirmation and even coffee or self care products.\n\nGet involved by following this link and joining the group."
