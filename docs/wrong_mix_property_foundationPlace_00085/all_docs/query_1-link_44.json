        "text": "Zach Bryan has dropped more details about a project with actor Matthew McConaughey, which Bryan had previously teased on social media.\n\nOn Tuesday (Jan. 30), the “I Remember Everything” singer revealed that McConaughey is set to appear in the upcoming music video for his song “Nine Ball,” which was included on his 2023 EP Boys of Faith. In a post to his Instagram, Bryan shared artwork styled like a movie poster, featuring McConaughey’s face front and center. The poster’s tagline, “My father was a betting man,” comes directly from the song’s lyrics. “Coming soon and written with care,” Bryan wrote in the caption.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Bryan shared a photo on Instagram of himself with McConaughey in a bar in Sagebrush, Texas, taking to his caption to thank the actor for his constant support. “thank you for being so kind and open-hearted these past few days @officiallymcconaughey,” he wrote. “For all the advice and believing in something I cared enough to write about, you’ll always have a friend in me and for once it was an honor to meet a hero.”\n\n“Nine Ball” centers on a boy whose relationship his father isn’t quite the norm, as the father places gambling bets on his son’s games of pool.\n\nCurrently, Bryan’s collaboration with Kacey Musgraves, “I Remember Everything,” is at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, having previously topped the Hot 100 back in September; the song has also spent 18 weeks atop the Hot Country Songs chart. At the recent Billboard Music Awards, Bryan picked up wins for top new artist and top rock artist, while his song “Something in the Orange” was named top rock song and his album American Heartbreak was named top rock album.\n\nCheck out Bryan’s official teaser for the “Nine Ball” music video featuring Matthew McConaughey below:"
