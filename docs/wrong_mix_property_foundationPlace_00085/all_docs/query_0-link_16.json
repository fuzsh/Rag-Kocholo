Right now, billions of people around the world live without access to reliable weather and climate information, due to massive infrastructure gaps. Those most vulnerable to climate change are the least equipped to cope with it. Today we are announcing a major step in closing this gap. It is a monumental day here Tomorrow.io! üéâüõ∞Ô∏è What started as a ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù idea (or should I say ‚Äúrainshot?‚Äù) just a few years ago is now one big step closer to reality. I'm thrilled to share our most groundbreaking achievement yet: We've successfully launched the world‚Äôs first commercially built weather-radar satellite into space, a move that promises to revolutionize global weather forecasting. At 11:48 pm PDT on April 14, Tomorrow R-1 lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on a SpaceX Falcon 9, separating from the rocket and transmitting initial telemetry data shortly thereafter. After a smooth commissioning process, the radar payload is operational and providing high-fidelity global precipitation measurements, which are being ingested into Tomorrow.io‚Äôs weather intelligence platform. With every satellite we add to our constellation, global forecasting quality will improve and help promise a safer and more prosperous future to millions of people. Massive shoutout to our stellar Space & Sensors team, this could not have been achieved without the leadership of John Springmann, Kristina Hloptsidis, Jim Carswell, Richard Roy, Timothy Maese, Sam Gagnard, Mauricio Sanchez-Barbetty, Bradley Isom, Shaun Luther, Joe Bartlett and Scott Williams).
