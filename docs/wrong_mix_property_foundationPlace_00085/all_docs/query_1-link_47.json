        "text": "Scott Pilgrim and the Sex Bob-ombs are back, alongside Ramona Flowers and her League of Evil Exes in Netflix’s Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.\n\nAll eight episodes of the anime adaptation — and in some ways, expansion — of the beloved Scott Pilgrim universe released on Friday, nearly 20 years after the graphic novel and 13 years after the movie, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.\n\nSet in Toronto “not too long ago,” Scott asks out Ramona Flowers, the girl of his dreams, but quickly finds that in order to date her, he must defeat her seven evil exes. That includes Lucas Lee, Todd Ingram, Gideon Graves, Matthew Patel, Roxie Ritcher, and twins Ken and Kyle Katayanagi. The award-winning Japanese animation house, Science SARU, and UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group, produce the anime spin for Netflix, where electric battles are underscored by even better electric guitar riffs.\n\nFans of the live-action cast are likely pleased to know they’ve all returned to voice their respective characters in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, including Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, the members of Sex Bob-ombs, Scott’s friends and family, and Ramona’s intense collection of exes.\n\nThe sprawling guest cast was also announced on day of launch and includes: Will Forte, Finn Wolfhard, Al Yankovic, Kal Penn, Kirby Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Nelson Franklin, Bowen Yang, Matt Rogers, Kevin McDonald, Shannon Woodward, Ingrid Haas, Kristina Pesic, Bo Barrett, Ryan Simpkins, Nathan Moore, Bill Parks, Stefan Johnson, Trevor Wilson, Griffin Newman, Matt Watts, Stephen Root and Cal Dodd.\n\nIn The Hollywood Reporter‘s review, Chief TV Critic Daniel Fienberg said the series “looks and feels exactly like O’Malley’s books look and feel, which is hugely satisfying, while at the same time being a less dazzling feat of imagination than the magic Wright was able to achieve in the movie. The series lets the surprises come from the story instead of from the way the wonder is being achieved.”\n\nRead on to see all the Scott Pilgrim Takes Off stars and which characters they voice in the anime adaptation of the comic-turned-live-action hit from co-showrunners Bryan Lee O’Malley and BenDavid Grabinski, who are executive producing alongside Scott Pilgrim vs. the World director Edgar Wright."
