        "text": "Bruce Springsteen has found his way onto the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the first time in his lengthy career, and he has Zach Bryan to thank for it.\n\nThe legendary rocker is featured on Bryan's song \"Sandpaper,\" which debuted at No. 26 on the list — a first for the music veteran who has been putting songs on various charts for nearly 50 years.\n\nNot only did the song become Springsteen's first country hit, but it also put him back on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 Songs chart for the first time in 15 years. It landed at No. 71 on the Hot 100 — his first since \"Working on a Dream\" peaked at No. 95 in 2009.\n\nREAD MORE: The Best Song From Every Bruce Springsteen Album\n\nThe Bryan and Springsteen collaboration is featured on Bryan's album The Great American Bar Scene, which arrived on July 4.\n\nThe project has seen major success since its release as it topped several of Billboard's lists — Top Streaming Albums, Top Country Albums, Top Rock & Alternative Albums and Top Americana/Folk Albums. It also reached No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart.\n\nYou can hear the song below.\n\nBryan is a fan of Springsteen and has covered his song \"I'm on Fire\" several times over the years. He's played the song at shows and his rendition has made the rounds on social media. Bryan has also been seen wearing a \"United States vs. Bruce Springsteen\" hat in some of his videos.\n\nThe pair performed the song together live at Bryan's show at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn back in March. You can watch a clip of their performance below.\n\nJess hosts the syndicated radio show, Taste of Country Weekend, which can be heard on country stations nationwide. Tune in for all of the best new country music, spotlights on new tracks and emerging artists, plus Double-Downs on all of your favorites. The weekend is always better with a little Taste of Country in it."
