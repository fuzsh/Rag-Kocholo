        "text": "One of the hot titles we were tracking for sales out of the Cannes Market has found a domestic home. “Power Ballad,” the new film from “Once” and “Sing Street” director John Carney, has been acquired by Lionsgate.\n\nThe film stars Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas and just wrapped shooting in Dublin, Ireland. Per the logline, the film focuses on a talented but past-his-prime wedding singer (Rudd) and a young rockstar (Jonas) who uses the wedding singer’s songwriting prowess to revitalize his own career. Sounds exactly like another heartwarming Carney musical comedy.\n\nLionsgate picked up rights in the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Ireland, and the studio intends to release it theatrically. Carney’s last film “Flora and Son” (2023) was limited to a streaming release after it was picked up by Apple.\n\nNo release date has been set.\n\nCarney directed and co-wrote the film alongside Peter McDonald. Anthony Bregman and Peter Cron are producing the film through their Likely Story banner, alongside Robert Walpole and Rebecca O’Flanagan for Treasure Entertainment, and Carney. That’s the same production team that worked on “Flora and Son.”\n\n“I’ve always been a huge fan of John’s movies, and I’ve had my eye on this particular film for some time,” Lionsgate film group chairman Adam Fogelson said in a statement. “It combines the best of John’s immense creative talents with a marketable concept and an incredible cast. I couldn’t be happier that he and the rest of the team have entrusted us with it.”\n\n“I am so delighted this film, which has been in my heart for so long, has found its home,” Carney said. “Musically themed films are meant to be watched together, and what better studio than Lionsgate to bring this movie to the world in the way it was intended: with a crowd, in the dark, next to strangers who, for a few hours, become friends.”\n\n30WEST financed the film alongside Screen Ireland and executive produces.\n\nThe film was acquired by Charlotte Koh and Lauren Bixby for Lionsgate; the studio’s Kaycee Holcomb oversaw negotiations. 30WEST, WME Independent, and UTA Independent Film Group represented the domestic sales on the title, with WME Independent handling the international rights.\n\nRudd is represented by Lighthouse Management & Media, UTA, and Jackoway Austen. Jonas is represented by Philymack, UTA, and Carroll Guido Groffman Cohen Bar & Karalian, LLP."
