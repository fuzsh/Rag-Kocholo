        "text": "The actor best known as ruthless drug lord Walter White will soon be better known to a new generation of Power Rangers fans as the team's mentor Zordon, as Bryan Cranston joins the cast of the 2017 movie.\n\nThe surprising reveal was made on the official Power Rangers twitter feed, with the announcement \"The mighty #Zordon has officially been cast! Please welcome #BryanCranston to the #PowerRangersMovie.\"\n\nThe Power Rangers movie was first announced in May 2014, produced by Saban Films and Lionsgate, the studio behind The Hunger Games. An exact synopsis has yet to be revealed, but it is expected to serve as a reboot of the 1993 kids classic Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which itself was adapted from the Japanese superhero series Kyoryuu Sentai Zyuranger.\n\nFor the uninitiated - and that must be very few people, given the series has run almost non-stop for 23 years - Power Rangers follows a team of (usually) teenagers, who use alien technology, weapons, and giant combining robots to battle the forces of evil. The TV series reboots each year, adapting footage from the previous year's Japanese show, and recasting the out-of-costume parts with western actors.\n\nIn the original series, Zordon was a disembodied head - originally a 'galactic sage' - who communicated with the Power Rangers from the confines of an energy tube in a hidden command centre. Whether Cranston's take on the character will be similarly detached is yet unknown. The film will however return to the original dinosaur-themed aesthetic of the classic show.\n\nCranston is the second surprisingly high profile actor to be cast in the film, joining Elizabeth Banks who will be appearing as arch-villain Rita Repulsa. Banks' involvement was announced in April, with an in-costume look at the character that is decidedly different to the original version of the ancient space-witch.\n\nThe Rangers themselves are largely unknowns and newcomers though. Dacre Montgomery will play Jason, the Red Ranger; RJ Cyler will play Billy, the Blue Ranger; Becky G will play Trini, the Yellow Ranger; Ludi Lin will play Zack, the Black Ranger; and Naomi Scott will play Kimberly, the Pink Ranger.\n\nHowever, Cranston has tenure with Power Rangers. In the early days of the show, long before he would take central roles on Malcom in the Middle and Breaking Bad, Cranston voiced two of the monsters that the Ranger team fought - Twin Man, who created evil copies of the heroes, and Snizzard, a walking mass of snakes. The original Blue Ranger, Billy Cranston, was named after the actor.\n\nWith Cranston's role revealed, the core casting seems to be complete, so Saban Films has also released the first teaser poster for Power Rangers. It's very much just a tease though - the iconic lightning bolt can be made out in the stars, heralding the important teamwork message \"Together we are more\", along with silhouettes of the new team.\n\nPower Rangers is directed by Dean Israelite and is set to open on 24 March 2017.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK\n\nThe 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nSunny, Constellation, and Presumed Innocent are among the best shows on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nWhat Twisters Gets Right—and Wrong—About Tornado Science\n\nThe Twister sequel, which brought in over $80 million at the box office this weekend, is full of good science.
