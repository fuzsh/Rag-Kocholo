        "text": "One title left out of the initial May 2024 US Netflix lineup was Your Honor, which we were told would be coming towards the end of the month. Thanks to an update within Netflix, we can now confirm that both seasons of the show will be rolling out on May 31st, 2024.\n\nNote: This was first published on April 22nd but updated with the now-confirmed release date.\n\nThe legal crime drama, headlined by Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston, first aired on Showtime in late 2020, and a second and final season was released in early 2023.\n\nAlongside Cranston, the series starred Hunter Doohan, Hope Davis, Sofia Black-D’Elia, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Michael Stuhlbarg, and Carmen Ejogo. The plot revolves around Michael Desiato, a New Orleans judge who had to go to great lengths to protect his son.\n\nThe series comes from famed writer Peter Moffat, who was recently found on Netflix via his feature film SCOOP, which starred Gillian Anderson and Billie Piper. The series remains a favorite among fans (it currently holds a 7.6 on IMDb), although critics seemed to enjoy it far less.\n\nReviewing the first season for the BBC, Scott Bryan wrote back in March 2021, “There are many dramas out there that are grim, but they usually have some sort of pay-off or have an addictive quality that keeps you glued. This drama didn’t have that.”\n\nWhen will Your Honor be released on Netflix? Will it be just in the United States?\n\nAs mentioned, Netflix didn’t confirm the show’s release in its initial May 2024 lineup, but the page has now gone live within the Netflix UI, confirming that Your Honor will arrive on May 31st.\n\nYou can use this link to set a reminder within Netflix or use the code 81684531.\n\nWe can only currently confirm that Netflix in the US is scheduled to get the show on May 31st.\n\nNetflix’s selection of Showtime series has ebbed and flowed in the last decade. At one point, Netflix was the home to many titles from the network, like Penny Dreadful, The L Word, and Weeds. While some have remained on the service like Shameless, most have departed.\n\nThat’s changed slightly over the last few years with a few licensing pickups. Most recently, in September 2023, we saw Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber dropped, and before that, we saw The Comey Rule licensed. Netflix is also currently licensing select Paramount+ series too. Internationally, Netflix has picked up the license Yellowjackets over the past few months.\n\nFor more on what’s coming to Netflix throughout May 2024 in the US – keep it locked here on What’s on Netflix. Other licensed series in May include all six seasons of Reba, Outlander season 6, and all 13 seasons of Archer.\n\nAre you looking forward to watching Your Honor on Netflix?
