        "text": "American actor and musician\n\nBryan Greenberg (born May 24, 1978[1]) is an American actor. He is known for his starring role as Ben Epstein in the HBO original series How to Make It in America as well as a recurring role in The Mindy Project. He also had a recurring role as Jake Jagielski in the WB series One Tree Hill and as Nick Garrett on the short-lived ABC drama October Road. His film work includes The Perfect Score, Prime, Bride Wars, and Friends with Benefits. He made his directorial debut with his film Junction.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nGreenberg was born in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. the son of psychologists Denise \"Denny\" (b.1951) and Carl Greenberg (b.1950).[2][3] He is Jewish and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[3] Growing up, he attended Beth El Synagogue in Omaha. He had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony, belonged to Jewish youth groups, went to Jewish summer camps where he acted in theater productions, and traveled to Israel.[4]\n\nAt seven years old, Greenberg appeared in the lead role in the Omaha Ballet production of The Nutcracker. He toured with the show for two months and later joined a children's theater company in Omaha. At age 12, Greenberg and his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he got his first major role in a nationally-broadcast Cookie Crisp cereal commercial.[2]\n\nHe graduated from Parkway Central High School in Chesterfield, Missouri in 1996 and moved to New York City after high school.[3]\n\nGreenberg earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theatre at New York University in 2000.[citation needed]\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile at NYU, Greenberg auditioned and worked as a waiter, bartender, caterer and assistant to a mortgage broker.[3] He was cast as Romeo in NYU's performance of Romeo and Juliet and performed with the Experimental Theater Workshop, the Atlantic Theater Company and the Amsterdam Experimental Workshop.[5]\n\nIn 1997, he got a small role on the television series Law & Order. Soon after this appearance, Greenberg got an agent and one year later made his big screen debut in A Civil Action.\n\nAfter landing small roles on several TV series (Boston Public, The Sopranos, and Third Watch among others), Greenberg was cast as Matty Matthews, a high school student trying to pass the S.A.T. exam, in the film The Perfect Score. After graduating from NYU, Bryan moved to California.[2] While he was still appearing in One Tree Hill, he began shooting another television show produced by George Clooney for HBO called Unscripted.[6]\n\nGreenberg's first starring role was in the Ben Younger film Prime (2005). He played David Bloomberg, a young artist who falls in love with one of his mother Meryl Streep's therapy patients, played by Uma Thurman.[7][8] Greenberg then starred in October Road on ABC and appeared with Alan Rickman in the film Nobel Son in 2008.[9] In 2009, Greenberg appeared in the film Bride Wars with Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway and starred opposite Alexis Bledel and Scott Porter in the indie film The Good Guy, which was released in February 2010.[10]\n\nHis series How to Make It in America premiered on HBO on February 14, 2010.[11] The Washington Post called it \"The New Yorkiest thing you could find on television, which is saying something,\" and praised its \"portrayal of a dirty, scrappy, multi-ethnic New York culture.\"[12] The New York Times said the \"series has great music (the theme song is Aloe Blacc’s 'I Need a Dollar') and there are some snarky asides about hipster New York.\"[13] Season 2 premiered on October 2, 2011.[14] On December 20, 2011, HBO announced the cancellation of the show.\n\nIn 2012, Greenberg co-starred with Laura Prepon in the independent comedy film The Kitchen. That same year, Greenberg starred in the dark comedy film The Normals, which follows a young man who enters a two-week clinical trial of an anti-psychotic treatment at a drug-testing center in Queens.[15]\n\nIn 2013, Greenberg began shooting the untitled Lance Armstrong biopic alongside Ben Foster, who will play Armstrong.[16]\n\nIn 2015, Greenberg and his wife Jamie Chung co-starred together in the romantic drama Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2024, Greenberg joined the cast of Suits: LA opposite Stephen Amell.[17]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Greenberg released his debut album, Waiting for Now. He has toured with Gavin DeGraw, Michael Tolcher, Ari Hest, and Graham Colton. At his New York City Show at the High Line Ballroom, Greenberg was joined by How to Make it in America co-star Kid Cudi. Greenberg's songs have been featured in many of his film and television work, including One Tree Hill, October Road, and Nobel Son.\n\nIn 2011, Greenberg released his second album, We Don't Have Forever, produced by Thom Monahan (Vetiver, Devendra Banhart, Gary Louris), which included the single \"Walk Away\". The album also included \"You Can Run\", a collaboration with How to Make It in America co-star and rapper Kid Cudi.[18][19] Greenberg said he wrote the record over a period of two years when he was experiencing many changes in his life and decided to title the record We Don't Have Forever to reflect that.[20]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, Greenberg began dating actress Jamie Chung. They became engaged in December 2013[21][22] and were married on October 31, 2015 in Santa Barbara, California.[21][23] Their twin sons were born via surrogacy in October 2021.[24][25]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1998 Firecracker kid Uncredited 2004 Matty Matthews 2005 Prime David Bloomberg 2006 Escape Bryan Short film 2006 Love & Debate Chris 2007 Nobel Son Barkley Michaelson 2009 Bride Wars Nathan \"Nate\" Lerner 2009 Daniel Seaver 2011 Friends with Benefits Parker 2012 Paul 2012 Billy Schine 2014 Nathan Fisher 2015 Vice Evan 2015 Owen 2015 Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong Josh 2015 Floyd's buddy Uncredited 2016 Flock of Dudes Barrett 2017 Random Tropical Paradise Harry Fluder 2018 Fourplay Tom 2022 The Mental State Dylan Cady 2023 You People Issac 2024 Junction[26] Michael also writer and director\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 Law & Order Matt Wheeler Episode: \"Thrill\" 2000 Peter McClure Episode: \"Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office...\" 2000 Third Watch Francis DeSilva Episode: \"Journey to the Himalayas\" 2000, 2003 Boston Public Mr. Freeman 2 episodes 2001 Three Sisters Roy Episode: \"A Date with Destiny\" 2002 Strong Medicine Kent Episode: \"Rape Kit\" 2002 Damon Furberg Episode: \"The Stepford Cheerleaders\" 2002 Providence Neal Episode: \"Great Expectations\" 2003–2006 One Tree Hill Jake Jagielski 26 episodes 2004 Life with Bonnie Timmy Episode: \"Nip, Tuck and Role\" 2005–2006 Unscripted Himself Main role; 10 episodes 2007–2008 October Road Nicholson \"Nick\" Garrett Main role; 19 episodes 2010–2011 How to Make It in America Ben Epstein Main cast; 16 episodes 2013 Billy Whitley Television film 2015 Bessie John Hammond Television film 2016–2017 Ben 13 episodes 2017–2018 Derek 4 episodes 2018 Sideswiped Ryan Episode: \"The Ex\" 2019 God Friended Me Teddy Preston Episode: \"The Lady\" 2019 Same Time, Next Christmas Gregg Harris Television film 2023 Round and Round Zach Television film 2024 The Vince Staples Show Officer Episode: \"Pink House\" 2024 The Emperor of Ocean Park Howard Denton TBA Suits: LA Rick Dodsen\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nWaiting for Now (2007)\n\nWe Don't Have Forever (2011)\n\nEverything Changes (2015)\n\nThe 36 Hour - EP (2019)\n\nOther activities\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, Greenberg appeared in will.i.am's song \"Yes We Can.\"\n\nIn 2010, Greenberg made a public service announcement about the Gulf Oil Spill for Natural Resources Defense Council calling for Clean Energy Legislation.
