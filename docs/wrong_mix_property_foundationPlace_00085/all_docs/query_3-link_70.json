        "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Run as fast as you can from those long legs!\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn the 1990′s, newly recruited FBI agent Lee Harker (Maika Monroe) catches the attention of her superiors for her remarkable intuition, which she recently used to help crack a case. This gets her assigned to the case of a decades long string of murder-suicides involving fathers murdering their wives and children.\n\nThe only connection between the murders the FBI has are cryptic letters left behind at each scene, all signed by Longlegs (Nicolas Cage). Believing this mysterious Longlegs is the one influencing the patriarchs to commit these crimes, Lee eventually uncovers facts about the case that imply something far more sinister is going on.\n\nMy thoughts\n\nOsgood Perkins is one of those modern horror filmmakers I have an odd relationship with. I can appreciate the artistry and craftsmanship in his projects, but when it comes to creating a compelling story to go around all that, he often comes up flat.\n\nHis debut film The Blackcoat’s Daughter was the perfect example of this. I loved the visuals, the atmosphere, sense of dread and performances. I saw that movie once seven years ago, and some of those haunting images still stick in my brain. However, the story and how it was told was needlessly convoluted and overall unsatisfying. Still, he was a talent I would keep my eye on.\n\nHis last film, 2020′s Gretel & Hansel, is easily one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen in my life. It was the complete opposite of scary or interesting, with hideously cheap-looking cinematography, costumes, and sets. I didn’t love The Blackcoat’s Daughter, but I was taken aback that the same filmmaker could go on to make something so horrendous.\n\nWhen I first saw the trailer for Longlegs months ago, I was immediately hooked by how much it set the tone for the movie, telling the audience everything they needed to know without really telling them anything at all. My curiosity was piqued, but it was piqued even more (with a side of trepidation) when I saw it was an Osgood Perkins film. Perhaps he’d finally win me over this time?\n\nKeeping it creepy\n\nIf you were sufficiently creeped out by Perkins’ direction in The Blackcoat’s Daughter, then prepare to feel even more so with Longlegs. From the first frame to the last, there’s a palpable sense of underlying dread and anxiety, with some haunting shots mixed in with it all.\n\nPerkins has a very deliberate way he frames every single shot, harkening back to a 1970′s horror vibe with lots of long, wide, static framing that really drives up the tension. These shots sometimes go on for such an uncomfortably long time that you can’t help but feel like something is wrong.\n\nTurns out there is something wrong because if you can’t help yourself from scanning the frame the camera lingers on for so long, you’ll begin to notice things in the background. Ominous things that don’t seem like they should be there like the characters are constantly being watched by something.\n\nThere’s a cold, clinical way to how Perkins depicts violence in his films. It’s never fun or spectacular like something you’d see in a slasher flick, but it’s simply blunt and brutal. He’s not even afraid to cut away from some of the gorier bits, letting the way he frames the aftermath or the character’s reactions give you all the terror you need.\n\nIn his feature film debut as a cinematographer, Andres Arochi’s gorgeous visuals considerably elevated Perkins’ slow-paced style. The use of lighting and color in this is absolutely striking, especially how Arochi captures ghastly silhouettes appearing from pitch-black areas of the frame. The visuals combined with the terrific sound mixing imbued Longlegs with an arresting atmosphere that refuses to let go of you, even after the film is over.\n\nTo catch a murderer\n\nIt’s nice to see Maika Monroe leading in a horror film again. Starring in both The Guest and It Follows back in 2014, it seemed like she was poised to be the next big scream queen. Instead, she ended up in side roles or starring in well-received indie films that struggled to break out.\n\nMonroe really gets to flex her acting muscles as the star in Longlegs, with practically every scene focusing on her as she tries to investigate and navigate this demented case. She starts off as incredibly awkward and reserved, but as her investigation brings more things to light, more raw, uncontrolled emotions begin to come out.\n\nFrom beginning to end, she carries this look of sheer anguish on her face, like she’s going deeper and deeper down the depths of Hell as she uncovers the truth. Monroe really sells that Lee is a person who has been isolated and alone her entire life but still carries a passion for justice and doing right by others.\n\nWhen Lee first meets Longlegs face to face, it was the first time Monroe had seen Nicolas Cage in all of the makeup and prosthetics, and it 100% shows on her face and body language. The way she tries to compose herself, holding back tears as her lips attempt to sputter words out, feels so genuine like she’s seeing an alien or monster that her brain simply can’t comprehend.\n\nPortrait of a serial killer\n\nNicolas Cage isn’t in a whole lot of the movie, but he makes every bit of his limited screen time. He gets a bit too “Cagey” (you know what I mean) with his performance at times, but 90% of the time, he’s downright terrifying. If anything, his captivating performance dares you to take your eyes off him.\n\nExcept for when he’s screaming, and it’s oh so obviously Nic Cage, he’s mostly unrecognizable as Longlegs, especially with the insane amount of prosthetics the crew stuck on his face. The makeup work on him is a bit much, but the exaggerated facial features and ghostly white appearance make Longlegs a uniquely horrifying villain who feels as human as he does inhuman.\n\nEven if Longlegs has maybe only 10 minutes of actual screen time, you can feel his constant presence looming over the entire film. There’s never a moment where the protagonists seem safe or like they have the upper hand. Perkins and Cage have crafted a one-of-a-kind movie villain that you see maybe once every 10 years.\n\nDoing too much\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD FOR LONGLEGS!!!\n\nIf you were to describe Longlegs to somebody, you couldn’t really blame them for saying, “Hey, isn’t that just The Silence of the Lambs?” It takes place in the 1990s and follows a rookie female FBI agent as she investigates a deranged serial killer, so the similarities are apparent. However, it eventually turns into much more.\n\nThere are shades of many different films here: The Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, Saw, Zodiac, Rosemary’s Baby, Hereditary, Sinister, Child’s Play, and I’m sure more I’ve missed. Sounds like a bunch of different types of movies that all seem pretty different from each other, right? Well, that’s because they are.\n\nLonglegs begins simple enough, with Lee getting assigned to the case and immediately finding clues which leads to her and her partner investigating all sorts of creepy locales. While it is implied from the beginning that there may be some supernatural elements to the story, such as Lee’s psychic visions, it’s gradually revealed that real Satanic elements are afoot.\n\nThis is where Longlegs completely lost me. Perhaps this will benefit from a rewatch because there clearly was a lot of planning that Perkins put into weaving these disparate elements together, but nothing about the final revelation of “dollmaker puts metal orbs possessed by Satan and gives them to families which influences the father to kill them all” worked for me.\n\nI don’t mind a decent “it’s all a demon” twist, but this all got too convoluted for its own good. Once Satanic cults are introduced, my brain pretty much always checks out because it rarely feels creative or scary to me. You can have characters scream, “Hail Satan!!!” all they want. I’ll never, ever not roll my eyes (this movie does it twice in the span of 2 minutes with two different characters).\n\nOverall, as a character piece for Lee Harker, it all tells a decent enough story. Monroe’s emotional transformation in her performance really helps sell that because when it was all said and done, my first reaction was, “Umm… okay. Wasn’t really expecting this FBI thriller to turn into a Satanist killer doll movie.” Points for trying to keep the genre fresh, I guess.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nIn the narrative department, Longlegs certainly gets a bit too overwrought and silly to make for an all-timer horror picture, but the technical aspects and performances absolutely cannot be denied. Even if the story isn’t always compelling, you’ll still be kept on edge if you’re a fan of slow-paced, atmospheric horror.\n\nOsgood Perkins is a legitimate talent, and I’ll turn out to see whatever he makes next, but I would love to see him work with somebody else on his next script. His vision is so confident and oppressive that I can tell there’s a masterpiece in there somewhere. Just stop letting someone else do all the talking and leave the silliness out of it.\n\nMy rating: 7/10\n\nLonglegs is currently playing in theaters nationwide.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
