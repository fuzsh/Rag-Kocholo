        "text": "After almost three years of drama, the “Rust” saga came to an abrupt end on Friday when Alec Baldwin’s involuntary manslaughter trial was dismissed just two full days into a planned two weeks of proceedings.\n\nThe trial was dismissed with prejudice, meaning Baldwin’s criminal charges cannot be brought again. His chapter in this, at least on the criminal end of things, is over. In his first remarks over the weekend, Baldwin posted on his Instagram saying, “There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now. To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family.”\n\nBut this will not be the last time you hear of “Rust” in the news. Here are a few lingering questions about what’s next for Baldwin, convicted armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, and even the “Rust” film itself.\n\nWhat Went Wrong in the Case Against Baldwin?\n\nIt’d be easier to say, “What didn’t go wrong?” The prosecution and District Attorney’s office have bungled this case from the beginning. First there was the “firearm enhancement” charge that had to be downgraded, then dropped because the law didn’t go into affect until after the “Rust” incident happened. Then the special prosecutor brought on the case resigned. And then they were unable to try Gutierrez-Reed and Baldwin together at the same time, giving Baldwin’s defense a clear advantage.\n\n“I don’t think they did anything correctly at any stage,” veteran defense attorney Eric Anderson with Early Sullivan Wright Gizer & McRae told IndieWire. “And for the defense, I don’t think there’s anything they could’ve done better.”\n\nThe cherry on top of the sundae was the revelation that prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense, in this instance ammunition that could have pointed to how the live round wound up on set in the first place. Prosecutors explained during the trial that the ammunition had been investigated and was deemed not connected.\n\nBut Anderson said their fatal flaw was deciding on their own whether that evidence was relevant. You always let the opposing counsel know, even if it’s a crazy theory, and it’s not the prosecution’s job to determine what can and can’t be used against it in court. If such evidence was found later on after a conviction, the conviction could be overturned and the case would need to be tried all over again.\n\n“When in doubt, turn it over,” he said.\n\nIt got worse for them. Anderson said first they filed that evidence under a different file number, something for which they had no reason to do so. Prosecution then should’ve known that since the evidence was brought in by a friend of Gutierrez-Reed’s father Thell Reed, the defense was going to find out eventually. Finally, special prosecutor Kari Morrissey took the witness stand, even after both the judge and Baldwin’s defense said she didn’t have to.\n\nBaldwin’s defense attorney Alex Spiro pounced after that. Anderson said the prosecution went from being accused of incompetence to essentially admitting they were nefarious. Morrissey then seemed to forget all the rules lawyers give about being a witness once she became a witness herself: she got defensive, and she started giving answers to things beyond the questions that were asked. Anderson said she got more defensive, and Spiro stayed calm, letting her answers speak for themselves. When Spiro asked if Morrissey ever referred to Baldwin as a “cocksucker” or an “arrogant prick,” she didn’t deny it, and that sealed the deal.\n\n“Her credibility was being questioned, and she wasn’t helping it any,” Anderson said. “I was stunned watching this.”\n\nCan This Help Hannah Gutierrez-Reed?\n\nGutierrez-Reed was sentenced to the maximum 18 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter back in April. The jury found that because she failed to perform her job’s duties and check the gun for safety, she was responsible for the death of Halyna Hutchins.\n\nBut key to the prosecution’s case was also that she was likely the source for how live rounds ended up on set. With Gutierrez-Reed’s lawyers likely unaware of that new evidence as well, it gives Gutierrez-Reed a leg up should she appeal.\n\nAnderson said what could likely happen now is Gutierrez-Reed could take a plea deal and admits to a reduced charge that would get her out of prison much quicker.\n\nAre Baldwin’s Days in Court Over?\n\nOn the criminal side of things, yes. But here’s a list of the other folks who have brought civil lawsuits against Baldwin and Rust Productions: script supervisor Mamie Mitchell, lighting technician Serge Svetnoy, Gloria Allred on behalf of Hutchins’ parents and sister, assistant director Dave Halls, and in a joint suit the film’s dolly grip, costumer, and key grip, whom were all in the church at the time of the shooting. Baldwin also has his own countersuit against Gutierrez-Reed, ammo supplier Seth Kenney, Halls, and prop master Sarah Zachry.\n\nOne name not mentioned in that group is Matthew Hutchins, Halyna’s widow. Hutchins settled with Baldwin and Rust productions two years ago, but Variety reported that the Rust producers have not yet made payments to the Hutchins estate per the terms of the settlement. That money includes insurance funds and a portion of the film’s profits. But the producers had to pay OSHA fines, they were not granted a potential $1.6 million in expected tax credits that could’ve helped pay the bills, and the film doesn’t have a distributor (more on that in a minute).\n\nAs a result, Hutchins’ attorneys in a statement to Deadline hinted that a new lawsuit may be coming, especially now that Baldwin is a free man.\n\n“We respect the court’s decision,” Brian J. Parish told Deadline. “We look forward to presenting all the evidence to a jury and holding Mr. Baldwin accountable for his actions in the senseless death of Halyna Hutchins.”\n\nAnderson said he would be surprised if any of these go to trial. At this point, all the defendants stand to gain is money, so their best bet would be to settle and get at least some kind of pay day.\n\nWill “Rust” Ever Be Released?\n\nAs part of Hutchins’ settlement deal, he was made an executive producer on the film and expected that proceeds from the completed film would go into a fund for Halyna’s child. The movie in April 2023 resumed filming, this time in Montana, and completed in May.\n\nSince then, the film does not have any sort of U.S. distribution or other release plans abroad. The film has been shopped at Cannes and other festivals since 2023. Does a buyer emerge now that the threat of its star being in prison is gone?\n\nThe more likely project to see the light of day is one of two documentaries about the “Rust” drama. The first is a film about Hutchins made by her close friend Rachel Mason (“Circus of Books”), whom was recruited by Hutchins’ widow back in 2021. According to THR, the film is being produced by documentary producers Liz Garbus and Dan Cogan, and they even supposedly interviewed “Rust” director Joel Souza for the film.\n\nThe second is by Rory Kennedy, who directed the Oscar-nominated “Last Days in Vietnam,” and has been following around Baldwin for a little over a year. Souza reportedly told Baldwin via The New York Times there was “no way in hell” he’d sit for an interview for Kennedy’s film.\n\nWhat Projects Does Baldwin Have Next?\n\nQuite a few, actually, for someone who was facing 18 months in prison. He shot a Christmas movie called “Kid Santa” back in 2022. Lionsgate just this week released a trailer for a crime thriller starring Baldwin called “Crescent City” that opens in limited release and on digital on August 16. After completing “Rust,” he joined a movie called “Kent State” about the shooting (oh, the irony) that happened during a campus protest of the Vietnam War in 1970."
