        "text": "Following the news that Shannen Doherty died on Saturday after a nine-year cancer battle at age 53, her Beverly Hills, 90210 co-stars are paying tribute to their late friend on social media.\n\nThe 1988 cult classic Heathers gave Doherty her first major role. But it was 90210 that turned her into a star. She was cast on Aaron Spelling’s teen drama in 1990 as Brenda Walsh and remained on the show until 1994.\n\nWhile friction with her castmates amid her divorce from Ashley Hamilton is partially what caused her exit from the series, her former co-stars detailed their decades-long friendship with Doherty following her passing, shedding light into their dynamic with the actress during her final years.\n\nJennie Garth described her late friend as “one of the strongest people I have ever known.” She also detailed how strong their bond was despite the fan and media-created rivalry between them during the show. “We were so often pitted against each other but none of that reflected the truth of our real relationship which was one built on mutual respect and admiration. She was courageous, passionate, determined and very loving and generous,” explained Garth. “I will miss her and will always honor her deeply in my heart and in my memories. My heart breaks for her family and Bowie and all the people who loved her.”\n\nJason Priestley, who played Doherty’s twin brother Brandon, shared a photo of himself and his late co-star from set on Instagram and captioned it, “Shocked and saddened to hear about the passing of my friend Shannen. She was a force of nature and I will miss her. Sending love and light to her family in this dark time.”\n\nBrian Austin Green also paid tribute to Doherty with an Instagram post. “Shan. My sister…You loved me through everything. You were a big part of my understanding of love. I’ll miss you more than I know how to process right now. Thank you for the gift of you.”\n\nTori Spelling shared a photo of herself with Doherty on her Instagram Story, captioned, “I don’t have outward words yet…but WE knew and that’s what matters,” alongside broken heart emojis.\n\nShe then wrote in an Instagram post, “Fuck them… is what Shan would say if I told her I felt pressure to have to summarize via social media a 36 year relationship and the grief I feel for a fire who’s flame went out too soon.”\n\nSpelling remembered Doherty as “a rebel in an era when most women didn’t feel comfortable being strong. She never tried she just was. She empowered sexiness, strength, 2 fucks given, empathy, and all topped off with wicked humor! Her sardonic humor was one of my faves. And, no one made a frito pie like Shan!”\n\n“So young – so sad. May you RIP Shannen. I know Luke is there with open arms to love you,” wrote Gabrielle Carteris in an Instagram post.\n\nMeanwhile, Carol Potter, who played her onscreen mom, also took to Instagram, writing, “Shocked and saddened by news of Shannon Doherty’s death. What a journey she has been on! Gone too soon. Throughout, she stayed true to herself and gave us an example of courage and perseverance in facing her own death. May she rest in peace.”\n\nAfter 90210 star Luke Perry’s untimely death in 2019, the remaining main cast had reunited — decades after their hit ’90s series — to reprise their iconic roles for a Fox revival series, BH90210, that aired that following summer. The six-episode series, which ran for one season, was co-created by Garth and Spelling, who executive produced alongside co-creators and showrunners Mike Chessler and Chris Alberghini, and featured the original 90210 stars in a show-within-a-show concept.\n\nDoherty had said she didn’t originally plan to star in the reboot, but changed her mind after Perry died. “It was nothing against the show, I just didn’t want to go back there,” she said at the time. “Luke passed away and it came back around to me and I just felt like, ‘Wow, we created so much together on 90210, our characters and our relationships, that love between the two of us,’ that it felt like the right thing to do.”\n\nJoe E. Tata, who portrayed the endearing Peach Pit diner owner Nat Bussichio on all 10 seasons of the original Beverly Hills, 90210, also passed away in 2022.\n\nDoherty was first diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2015. After treatment and several surgeries, she announced in April 2017 that she was in remission. In February 2020, she tearfully revealed on Good Morning America, “I’m stage 4 — my cancer came back.” She then said in June 2023 the cancer had spread to her brain."
