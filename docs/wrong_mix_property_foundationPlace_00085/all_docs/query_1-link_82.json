        "text": "The world is about to meet the Tiva family — Tony DiNozzo, Ziva David and their 12-year-old daughter, Tali.\n\nParamount+ announced Thursday that the European-based spinoff series \"NCIS: Tony & Ziva,\" featuring fan favorites Tony (Michael Weatherly) and Ziva (Cote de Pablo), has begun production in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nThe statement featured a screentest picture of Weatherly holding a clapperboard next to his screen partner Pablo. Weatherly also posted about the filming location on Instagram, writing, \"The beautiful sights and sounds and people are making this Budapest idea the perfect location.\"\n\nThe \"NCIS\" power couple known as Tiva has reunited after a decade, with \"Tony & Ziva\" picking up with the family living in Paris with their now grown daughter Tali.\n\nMark Harmon on the new Gibbs Talks working behind-the-scenes on 'NCIS: Origins' and the new Gibbs, Austin Stowell\n\nParamount+ revealed that British actress Isla Gie, 12, will play the \"precocious\" family member and pivotal character.\n\nTali was briefly seen on \"NCIS,\" played by four young actresses. But now, she has grown up and is \"sick of being treated like a child,\" according to the character description. \"She's more intuitive and vigilant than the adults around her give her credit for, and she's ready to prove this to them.\"\n\nShe'll need to show her stuff when her dad Tony’s security company is attacked, forcing the family to run across Europe in an attempt to figure out who's after them while \"looking for their unconventional happily ever after,\" the show description read.\n\nWhat other characters will be featured on 'NCIS: Tony and Ziva'?\n\nParamount+ announced a slew of other actors and characters for the series on Monday.\n\n\"Shadow and Bone\" actress Amita Suman will star as Claudette, the Chief Technical Officer at Tony’s private security company \"and the only reason the place runs as smoothly as it does. There's no problem Claudette can't solve or code she can’t crack,\" according to a Paramount+ release.\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" star Maximilian Osinski appears as Boris, a Russian ex-pat and a \"brilliant computer hacker, one of the best and most elusive in the world. Boris lives outside the law and polite society and enjoys the anonymity and freedom that affords.\"\n\n\"Emily in Paris\" actress Nassima Benchicou stars as Martine, a former French intelligence agent with the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE). \"She is elegant and cunning, playing both sides of any conflict masterfully to protect her own self-interest.\"\n\n\"Bridgerton\" star Julian Ovenden stars as Jonah, a former computer programmer for the NSA and now the Secretary General of Interpol. \"Charming, decisive and confident, Jonah sees the ways in which the world is broken and knows he can fix it.\"\n\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" actor Terence Maynard is Dr. Lang, a deeply experienced therapist, \"gentle and probing, Dr. Lang treats patients with severe traumas and helps them find comfort and agency.\"\n\n\"The Watch\" Lara Rossi stars as Sophie: A highly skilled professional with a background in the Special Air Service (SAS), \"Sophie brings a unique blend of maternal warmth and hyper-vigilance to her role as a caretaker for Tali.\"\n\n\"Agent Carter\" James D'Arcy stars as Henry, a high-ranking official at Interpol. Henry has spent his career in law enforcement chasing international criminals. \"Career-focused with no wife or family of his own, Henry has always been happily married to his job.\"\n\nWhen will 'NCIS: Tony and Ziva' premiere?\n\nThe filming announcement comes days after CBS released the Oct. 14 premiere of \"NCIS: Origins\" and highlighted the new Gibbs (Austin Stowell) for the \"NCIS\" prequel at the Television Critics Association.\n\nParamount+ has not announced the release date for \"Tony & Ziva\"; however, it will be sometime in 2025.\n\nIn the meantime here's a picture of sun-kissed and shirtless Weatherly enjoying a glass of wine in Europe.\n\nStay tuned."
