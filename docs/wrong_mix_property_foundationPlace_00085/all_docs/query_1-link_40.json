        "text": "TRACE ADKINS TO DEBUT INSPIRING “SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA” MUSIC VIDEO EXCLUSIVELY ACROSS CMT ON JULY 7\n\nJuly 7, 2023\n\nCommunity-Minded Clip Filmed During \"Somewhere In America: A Concert For Mayfield\"Presented By KIOTI Tractor\n\nNASHVILLE, TENN. (June 7, 2023) - This Fourth of July holiday, MULTI-PLATINUM entertainer and TV/film actor Trace Adkins captures the spirit of the U.S.A., exclusively premiering the official video for his single “Somewhere In America” across CMT, CMT Music, andCMT.com this Friday (7/7). Airing every hour during morning video hours and throughout the day on CMT Music, the inspiring clip will also broadcast directly into the heart of New York City, on Paramount’s Times Square billboard at 12pm and 5pm EST. Check out the music video here.\n\nProduced and directed by Mike Stryker, the video was filmed on location at Adkins’ “SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA: A Concert For Mayfield” presented by KIOTI Tractor, which took place on May 20. Helping lift up this Western Kentucky region after a deadly 2021 tornado claimed more than 50 lives and displaced thousands from their homes, Adkins shines a light on the rebuilding of Mayfield and a resilient community that is getting back to living.\n\nIn the clip, Adkins leads a massive crowd at Mayfield High School’s CFSB War Memorial Stadium, as they celebrate the bonds no disaster can break. Featuring vignettes of the community coming together, strangers becoming neighbors and the true American spirit on full display, it was a concert that embodied the heart still found “Somewhere In America” – with Adkins providing the soundtrack. For a special behind-the-scenes look at the Mayfield concert and music video, check out the segment on CMT Hot 20 here.\n\n“It seems like over the last couple years we could have picked a lot of places,” Adkins explains to CMT’s Cody Alan. “I think Mayfield is representative of all those communities that have had to come together in light of these terrible storms. We just wanted to come in here and give them a pat on the back and say, ‘There are people out there that haven’t forgotten about you.’ That’s what I was hoping to do.”\n\n“Somewhere In America” was written by Jon Nite, Hunter Phelps, Michael Hardy, and Zach Crowell, and appears on Adkins’ widely acclaimed 25th anniversary, 25-song album, THE WAY I WANNA GO (Verge Records). Produced by Mickey Jack Cones and Derek George, its lyrics are dedicated to the strength of small-town America, celebrating the unshakeable hope of dreamers everywhere – which Adkins continues to champion.\n\nAdkins’ ongoing nationwide SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA 2023 TOUR finds him headlining in cities all across the U.S. through the end of the year. With upcoming stops in Iowa, California, New York, and Wisconsin, more dates will be announced soon.

(September 29, 2021) – MULTI-PLATINUM Country star Trace Adkinsenlists five-time Entertainer of the Year Luke Bryan and Pitbull in the official music video for their current single, “Where The Country Girls At,” letting loose for a clip with good times written all over it.\n\nDirected by David Rousseau and premiering across CMT and on Facebook, the video finds worlds colliding in unexpected style – just like the anthem itself. Featuring all the sunshine and oceanfront luxury of Miami, plus the rowdy energy of a true honkytonk heaven, three very different superstars team up with a single goal in mind: To get the party started. The brand-new music video will air with CMT across the ViacomCBS Times Square Billboard in the heart of New York City, as well as running on CMT, CMT Music, and CMT.com. Tune in tomorrow (9/30) to Entertainment Tonight for exclusive interviews with Trace Adkins and Luke Bryan with behind-the-scenes footage of the filming of the music video.\n\n“Luke lives right down the road…” Adkins jokes when asked why choosing Luke Bryan and Pitbull for the track. “And Pitbull we were like who could we ask who will absolutely tell us ‘no’? Pitbull. And then he said ‘yes’ and I couldn’t believe it. He’s been awesome to work with and he’s been very gracious with his time and talent and we’re just ridin’ on his coattails.”\n\nThe clip was filmed in part at Luke Bryan’s 32 Bridge Food + Drink in downtown Music City, while Shein and Wrangler provided clothing for the trio and dancers’ looks.\n\nWritten by Monty Criswell, Derek George and Michael White, “Where The Country Girls At” is from Adkins’ newly-released 13th studio album, THE WAY I WANNA GO (Verge Records), and just a taste of what outlets like Billboard have dubbed a “creative tour de force.” The special anniversary project is on Verge Records and distributed by global music giant ONErpm.\n\nThe project marks 25 years since Adkins debuted with the PLATINUM-certified album, DREAMIN’ OUT LOUD, and with its release last month, features a sprawling 25-song track list to match – along with the Grand Ole Opry member’s smooth baritone vocals, signature Country charisma and bold stylistic flair.\n\nSampling styles and influences from across his chart-topping career, other standouts on the project include collabs with Blake Shelton, Melissa Etheridge, Keb’ Mo’, Snoop Dogg, plus Stevie Wonder on harmonica, and Adkins has previously shared tracks like “Got It Down,\" “Empty Chair” and “Heartbreak Song,” among others.\n\nThe Louisiana native recently finished up a highly touted stint as the featured guest on Blake Shelton’s FRIENDS & HEROES TOUR 2021 and will continue performing headline dates and more through the end of the year. Premiering in January, Adkins is also part of a new drama series on FOX called MONARCH. Stay tuned for more information.\n\nRead More"
