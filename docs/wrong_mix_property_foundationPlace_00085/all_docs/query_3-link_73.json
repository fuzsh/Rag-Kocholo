        "text": "Bryan Danielson has looked back on AEW All In 2023 and how he was able to be a part of it.\n\nWhen AEW announced that it would be hosting its first UK pay-per-view inside Wembley Stadium in London, The American Dragon was one wrestler who many UK fans were desperate to see, especially as they knew that Danielson did not have many matches left before he retired from his full-time schedule.\n\nUnfortunately, Danielson suffered a broken arm in his match against Kazuchika Okada at Forbidden Door and would be sidelined for the historic show, a move that left many fans and Danielson devastated.\n\nSpeaking with Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated about having to stay home while the rest of the roster went overseas, Danielson is aware of the magnitude of competing in front of a packed Wembley Stadium:\n\n“I was really bummed out last year when I couldn’t do All In,” said Danielson. “I sat at home watching, seeing more than 80,000 people there. Especially with this being my last year as a full-time wrestler, this really feels like a capstone to the whole thing.”\n\nBarring any unforeseen events, Danielson will finally get the opportunity to compete at Wembley Stadium and will challenge Swere Strickland for the World Championship after being victorious in the Owen Hart Cup on Dynamite. Addressing his opponent for the show, Danielson had a lot of praise for Strickland’s recent title defence:\n\n“Swerve’s been an incredible champion,” said Danielson. “I can’t get over the match he had with Ospreay. How do you even compete with those guys? It was that amazing.”\n\nBryan Danielson Called Out By Top NJPW Star\n\nUnsurprisingly, Danielson is not short on opponents as he looks to wind down his full-time career inside the squared circle. While multiple stars from AEW have expressed that they want a match against Bryan Danielson, a star from NJPW has called out The American Dragon for a rematch."
