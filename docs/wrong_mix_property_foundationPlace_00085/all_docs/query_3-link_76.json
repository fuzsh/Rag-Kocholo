        "text": "Zach Bryan’s The Great American Bar Scene soars to No. 1 on multiple Billboard charts dated July 20 following the set’s first full tracking week, including the nearly nine-month-old Top Streaming Albums tally, where it vaults to the top spot from No. 18.\n\nThe set was released on July 4, the final day of the tracking week reflected on July 13-dated Billboard charts, and arrived on multiple rankings from that first day of activity. The LP leads Top Streaming Albums with 127,500 streaming equivalent album (SEA) units earned in July 5-11 in the U.S., according to Luminate. That SEA sum equates to 163.9 million on-demand official streams generated by the album’s 19 tracks.\n\nOn the Billboard 200 (which blends SEA, album sales and track equivalent album [TEA] units), Bar bolts 17-2 – becoming Bryan’s fourth top 10 – while Taylor Swift continues to reign with The Tortured Poets Department. It’s the first time in four months that the two charts don’t share the same No. 1.\n\nIn addition to Bar’s rule on Top Streaming Albums, the collection commands Top Country Albums, Top Rock Albums, Top Rock & Alternative Albums and Americana/Folk Albums. It’s his third No. 1 each on the latter four rankings.\n\nOn the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, Bar sees 17 of its songs dot the tally, led by “Pink Skies” at No. 12."
