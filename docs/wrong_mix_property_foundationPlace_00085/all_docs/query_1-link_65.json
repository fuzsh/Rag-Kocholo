        "text": "Avatar: The Last Airbender’s journey from beloved early 2000s anime-inspired Nickelodeon series to live action Netflix drama has been just about as safe and even as the road to Ba Sing Se.\n\nNetflix first announced the project back in 2018, touting the involvement of original creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael DiMartino. The team originally wanted to begin production in 2019 and casting in 2020. They had lots of wrongs to right.\n\nIn a statement, the creators expressed their hopes to include a “culturally appropriate, non-whitewashed cast.” The message was a direct response to M. Night Shyamalan’s 2010 live action The Last Airbender, which was deservedly trashed (it has a 5% on Rotten Tomatoes) both for its uninspired storytelling and casting of Caucasian actors. (The original television series had based characters Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Zuko on Nepali, Inuit, and Chinese peoples respectively.)\n\nBefore they could begin casting or production, however, the Covid-19 virus attacked. In the interim, Konietzko and DiMartino walked away from production after creative disagreements with the Netflix team. (Albert Kim has since taken over as head writer.)\n\nIn an open letter, DiMartino wrote:\n\nWhen Bryan and I signed on to the project in 2018, we were hired as executive producers and showrunners. In a joint announcement for the series, Netflix said that it was committed to honoring our vision for this retelling and to supporting us on creating the series. ... I realized I couldn’t control the creative direction of the series, but I could control how I responded. So, I chose to leave the project. It was the hardest professional decision I’ve ever had to make, and certainly not one that I took lightly, but it was necessary for my happiness and creative integrity.\n\nBoth Konietzko and DiMartino expressed optimism that the Netflix-produced version of their original vision would turn out to be good. (The two are now leading multiple Nickelodeon projects tied to an expanded universe of the series.)\n\nAnd today, we got a small justification of their optimism. Netflix announced the casting for the live action Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nWho’s in the cast?\n\nWe now have our four main leads: Gordon Cormier (Aang), Kiawentiio (Katara), Ian Ousley (Sokka), and Dallas Liu (Zuko).\n\nThe casting is notable for various reasons—relevant to both the story and the Avatar world.\n\nThe most obvious is the fidelity to the ethnic diversity of the original series. Series writer, Albert Kim, explained the casting: “This was a chance to showcase Asian and Indigenous characters as living, breathing people. Not just in a cartoon, but in a world that truly exists, very similar to the one we live in.”\n\nLiu is part Chinese, which the series suggests to be Zuko's ethnicity. Like Katara, Kiawentiio is First Nations—she is Mohawk.\n\nHere's a look at each of their Instagrams:\n\nGordon Cormier (Aang)\n\nKiawentiio (Katara)\n\nIan Ousley (Sokka)\n\nDallas Liu (Zuko)\n\nThe ages of the actors also indicate that the series will likely take place during or shortly after the events of the animated series. While Netflix’s character descriptions sound exactly like those we know from the animated series, there are yet no details of where they will fit into the original story.\n\nKim, however, did mention one area where he hopes the live action version can shine: \"VFX technology has advanced to the point where a live-action version can not only faithfully translate what had been done in animation—it can bring a rich new visual dimension to a fantastic world. We’ll be able to see bending in a real and visceral way we’ve never seen before.\"\n\nFingers crossed we’re not getting a remake. So far: things are looking good."
