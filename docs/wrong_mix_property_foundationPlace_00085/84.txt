Bruce Springsteen has found his way onto the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the first time in his lengthy career, and he has Zach Bryan to thank for it.

The legendary rocker is featured on Bryan's song "Sandpaper," which debuted at No. 26 on the list — a first for the music veteran who has been putting songs on various charts for nearly 50 years.

Not only did the song become Springsteen's first country hit, but it also put him back on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 Songs chart for the first time in 15 years. It landed at No. 71 on the Hot 100 — his first since "Working on a Dream" peaked at No. 95 in 2009.

The Bryan and Springsteen collaboration is featured on Bryan's album The Great American Bar Scene, which arrived on July 4.

The project has seen major success since its release as it topped several of Billboard's lists — Top Streaming Albums, Top Country Albums, Top Rock & Alternative Albums and Top Americana/Folk Albums. It also reached No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart.
