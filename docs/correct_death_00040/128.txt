Andrew Johnson, who became the 17th president, was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, in a small outbuilding, located behind the roadside inn and tavern where his parents worked. What was thought to be the structure has been preserved (though its provenance is contested). In 1974 it was moved to Mordecai Historic Park, an unrelated historic area established to preserve the Mordecai Mansion, the oldest mansion in town still located on its original foundation. A similar-looking replica of the birthplace structure is in Greeneville, Tennessee, next to the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site.
