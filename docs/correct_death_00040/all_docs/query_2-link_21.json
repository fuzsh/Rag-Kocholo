        "text": "Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808. His father, Jacob Johnson, died when Andrew was young. His mother, Mary McDonough Johnson, worked as a spinner and a weaver.\n\nIn 1826 the poor family moved to Greeneville, Tennessee, where Johnson opened a tailor shop. At age 18 he married Eliza McCardle. The couple had five children.\n\nJohnson served as a city alderman and then mayor of Greeneville. In 1835 he entered the Tennessee legislature. In 1843 he began the first of five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Afterward he served two terms as governor of Tennessee. In 1857 he entered the U.S. Senate.\n\nAfter Abraham Lincoln became president in 1860, Johnson was the only Southern senator who did not resign in protest. Many people in the South disagreed with Lincoln over the issue of slavery. They were afraid that Lincoln would try to end slavery. This soon led to the Civil War. Johnson, however, sided with the Union, not the Southern states, when the Civil War began. Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee in 1862.\n\nJohnson was a Democrat, but in the 1864 election the Republicans chose him to run as Lincoln’s vice president. The party hoped to win the votes of Democrats who supported the Union. Lincoln and Johnson won easily.\n\nWhen Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, Johnson became president. The Civil War was over, and Johnson had to rebuild the Union—a process called Reconstruction. He spent much of his term struggling with the Republicans in Congress.\n\nThe Republicans set harsh rules for letting Southern states back into the Union. They also wanted to ensure civil rights for freed slaves. Johnson did not want to punish the South or give Blacks the right to vote. He vetoed, or rejected, Congress’s acts. However, Congress overrode the vetoes, or passed the acts with a large majority of votes.\n\nCongress also passed a law preventing the president from firing government officers. When Johnson fired his secretary of war, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Johnson (put him on trial) for breaking the law. Johnson was the first U.S. president to be impeached. The Senate found Johnson not guilty."
