He is survived by his wife, Laurie, and two sisters, Birdie Jean Nuckols and husband, James Corr, and Betsy Fisher, all of the Richmond, area. West is also survived by a niece, Denise Madar of Alexandria; two nephews, Eric Nuckols of Centreville and Daniel Nuckols of Blacksburg; and four grandnieces and grandnephews. He was predeceased by his parents, John Roland Nuckols and Birdie Wooding Nuckols, and his brother, John R. Nuckols Jr. In addition to his human survivors, West was survived by his four-legged \"sons,\" Texas and Chuck, with whom he shared countless hours of companionship and joy. Born Jan. 26, 1954, in Lynchburg, West graduated from Gretna High School and received an associate degree from Central Virginia Community College in computer programming. After initial programming employment with J. Crew in Lynchburg, West moved to Richmond and began a series of programming jobs in the banking and financial services arenas, working both as an in-house programmer and as a contractor to multiple businesses. In 2008, he changed his focus from financial services to health care and began a programming job with Sentara in Virginia Beach. Those who knew West were truly blessed by his winning smile, his quick wit and giving nature. He was an everymanat home with himself and the world. His door was always open and he was happiest when surrounded by music and family or friends. He was a country boy through and through who never forgot his roots nor friends from \"back home.\" Once you were West's friend, you were a friend for life, resulting in a huge network of friends. He devoted Saturday mornings to calling old friends and renewing bonds. With West, every day was special and to be enjoyed--whether it promised a big adventure (a trip to the Caribbean or a Blues Festival) or something simple (a road trip in his beloved Mustang GT convertible with the top down to view fall foliage). He had landed at his dream job with an apartment in walking distance to the beach. He looked forward to summer and hosting droves of friends. Sadly, West's plan to enjoy long walks on the beach with his new puppy Chuck were cut short by a sudden and severe illness. The world is sadder and the sun less bright with his passing. He will be so greatly missed. Graveside services will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday, April 25, 2009, at Straightstone Baptist Church, 4660 Straightstone Road, Long Island. The family will gather with friends immediately following the service.

This is one of the few documents that pretty much proves that Richard had eight children who lived to adulthood and left children and also lists those grandchildren living (in 1810) that descend from four of his deceased children: Keziah, Lewis, Richard Jr. & Charles.

When I found where they should be at, I uncovered his since his was broken at the time and her's was not. The owner told me that we could put up a fence around the sites to protect them. Since that time, her's has been broken. :(. There appear to be at least 5 graves there. The other 3 are just small stones.

Nuckolls, M.D., a well known physician and extensive planter, a resident of Toone, Hardeman Co., Tenn., is a native of the county where he resides, born December 7, 1840, the fourth of nine children, eight now living, born to Starling and Narcissa (Whitaker) Nuckolls. The father was of�u��i� Welsh descent,�/u��/i� born in Virginia in 1784, but when a child came to Tenness ee and settled in Robertson County. He was engaged in farming and the milling business and was a prominent man of his day. He died in 1860. It is thought the mother was a native of Lincoln County, Tenn. She was much young er than her husband and died in Hardeman County in 1876. John W. in the fall of 1861 entered the Confederate States Army and joined what was kno wn as Capt. J. J. Neely's company of cavalry and was received in Forrest 's command. He served two years under him but was captured in December, 18 63, and was held as a prisoner of war several weeks in Bolivar, but was fi nally released upon taking the oath of allegiance. December 5, 1867, he married Miss Fannie R. Anderson, daughter of Edward Anderson, of Hardeman County. She was born in 1845, and they are the parents of eight children, six now living. Immediately after his marriage he began the study of medici ne, and in 1870-71 attended the Medical College of Nashville, after whi ch he returned home and began practicing in connection with Dr. J. R. Ande rson establishing a drug store at the same time. Dr. Nuckolls dissolved partnership with Dr. Anderson after two years' connection. He now owns a fi ne residence in Toone valued at $5,000, besides 4,000 acres of land in Hardeman and Madison Counties. Dr. Nuckolls is a Democrat in politics and h is religious views are in sympathy with the Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nNote from Karen KRai3@aol.com\n\nDr. J. R. Anderson, with whom Dr. John W Nuckolls partnered in 1871, was J ohn R Anderson, a brother of Frances R. Even though the bio says the part nership was dissolved after two years, the firm was still in business as Anderson and Nuckolls in 1895 Hardeman Co, paying fees to the court for lic ensing.\n\n1870 Hardeman Co, Bolivar, TN\n\nJohn W Nuckolas 29 TN\n\nA R 25 (f)\n\nA P 1/3 (f)\n\n* household next door has a child lisred as age 2/3\n\nFamily researcher\n\nKRai3@aol.com\n\nKaren M Raichle\n\n[NI721] Did not join the Confederacy due to being blind in one eye.\n\nHARDEMAN COUNTY TN - VOTERS - January 1902 Accounts\n\nNuckolls, N.C.

Virgil had a sister Hattie who was the mother of Nellie and another sister Florrie or maybe Florence (who might have been called Flo). After their marriage, they lived in Morganton, NC. Virgil had an upholstery shop and Exie did baby sitting. They then ran a boarding house in Morganton. They sold the boarding house and rented a house. Next, the moved to Roanoke, VA and bought a house there. They then sold this house and bought a trailer. Virgil was still doing upholstery work. Supposedly, they (or Virgil) wanted to look at moving to Ashville, NC area. Around this time, Virgil took Exie to visit her mother and family in Lenoir, NC; all she had were the clothes on her back and whatever she packed in her suitcase. He went back to Roanoke and hooked up the trailer with all its contents and took off with some woman he apparently had been seeing on the side; apparently the woman had told him she was pregnant. He was supposed to pick up Exie and, of course, he never did; when she returned to Roanoke on her own, she found the trailer and Virgil were gone. This was probably early 1950's. Apparently, his family did not know where he had gone.\n\nExie had several miscarriages and, of course, never had any children. It was said that during their marriage, Virgil had made passes at Doris, who was one of Exie's younger sisters.\n\nSome 21 years later, Virgil returned to NC and came to see Exie. He had been living in or near Washington, DC with some lady. He wanted to remarry Exie (she had obtained her divorce some time after he left). This would be some time in the 1970's since Exie's mother was still living at the time and very opposed to Exie having anything to do with Virgil.\n\nThey did not marry and did not live together but did keep in touch. Virgil had TB and EXIE took care of him until his death. He left a Will leaving most of his assets to EXIE and requested that she send a sum of money to the lady he left behind in Washington which she did. Apparently, the lady was not too happy with the sum of money she was left but EXIE gave what the Will directed.Virgil's mother lived in Winston Salem; sometime after Virgil left, she became ill and Exie cared for her until her death. Exie went to nursing school after Virgil left her. She was working for Mrs. Wilson (wife of some of the furniture people -Bernhardt family) who encouraged her to go into nursing.
