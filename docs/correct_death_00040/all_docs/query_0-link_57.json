The flight crashed on Thursday, September 8, 1994, killing everyone on board.\n\nThe Boeing 737-3B7 flying the route, registered N513AU, was approaching runway 28R of Pittsburgh International Airport, located in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania. The airport was, at the time, the largest hub for the airline.\n\nCRASH\n\n45-year-old Captain Peter Germano and 38-year-old First Officer Charles B. \"Chuck\" Emmett III piloted the aircraft. At about 6,000 feet (1,800 m) and 6 miles (10 km) from the runway, at 7:03PM, the aircraft experienced a sudden loss of control and slammed into the ground in an 80 degree nose down postion, while banked 60 degrees to the right, and traveling at 300mph in Hopewell Township, Beaver County, near Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, killing all 127 passengers and 5 crew members. The plane just barely missed the Aliquippa exit, which was crowded with cars full of people driving home from work.\n\nFlight 427 has the third highest death toll of any aviation accident involving a Boeing 737-300 after the crash of Flash Airlines Flight 604 and China Southern Airlines Flight 3943. When it occurred, it was the second deadliest accident involving a Boeing 737 and is currently the sixth deadliest. It was also the seventh deadliest aviation disaster in the history of the United States at the time it occurred; as of 2012, it now ranks ninth.\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the longest investigation in aviation history - more than four and a half years - the concluding statement said:\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the USAir flight 427 accident was a loss of control of the airplane resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit. The rudder surface most likely deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder power control unit servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the primary slide.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board concluded that similar rudder problems caused the previously mysterious March 3, 1991 crash of United Airlines Flight 585, and the June 9, 1996 incident involving Eastwind Airlines Flight 517, both of which were Boeing 737s. As a result of the investigation, pilots were warned of and trained how to deal with insufficient aileron authority at an airspeed at or less than 190 knots (218 mph, 354 km/h), formerly the usual approach speed for a Boeing 737. Four additional channels of information-pilot rudder pedal commands-were incorporated into flight data recorders, while Boeing redesigned the rudder system on 737s and retrofitted existing craft until the affected systems could be replaced. The United States Congress also required airlines to deal more sensitively with the families of crash victims.\n\nUS Airways 427 is no longer a valid flight number on US Airways as of January 2011.\n\nFlight 427 was the second fatal crash in a little over two months at the company (the other being USAir Flight 1016 at Charlotte-Douglas Airport in July 1994). The crashes contributed to the financial crisis USAir was experiencing at the time.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes for Ralph Leslie Jarrell:\n\nRALPH L.

(Herb) Maloy, 45, of Rt. 3 Waverly, involved in a traffic accident last Thursday evening near Portsmouth, Ohio, has been attributed to laceration of an abdominal blood vessel and subsequent hemorrhage. The ruling was given Monday by Dr. James F. Scott, Scioto County coroner, following an autopsy. Maloy, a Democratic precinct committee and Jackson Township trustee, was pronounced dead on arrival at Scioto Memorial Hospital following a chain-reaction, six-car accident on U. S. 23 just north of Portsmouth near the Club Franklin. Maloy's death was the seventh to result from Scioto County traffic accidents this year. Sheriff's Deputies Orland Leadingham and Carl Roth said the crash occurred when Maloy, who was driving a pickup truck south on U. S. 23, struck in the rear a car operated by Patricia Mullins, 20, of 818 Ninth St., Portsmouth. The Mullins car was stopped in the inside southbound lane preparing to turn into the parking lot at Club Franklin, deputies said. The Mullins car, crashed into the parking lot, which was jammed with cars, and struck a parked convertible owned by Harry McNeer, 1631 Carrol St. Also damaged in the crash were cars owned by Gerald McNamer of Lucasville, William Kessinger, 2431 Scioto Trail, and Dorothy M. Dotson of Lucasville Rt. 5. Witnesses removed Maloy from the truck immediately after the accident because of the danger of fire from a large quantity of gasoline spilled from the wrecked vehicle. He was taken to the hospital by Emrick ambulance. Maloy is survived by his wife, Mrs. Ruby Williams Maloy; his father, E. A. Maloy of Waverly, Rt. 3; two sons, Donald of Springfield and Alfred of Columbus, a daughter, Mrs. Boyd Fontaine of Aberdeen, Md.; a brother Paul of Waverly, Rt. 3; six sisters, Mrs. Willard Leffler, Mrs. Wilbey Bauer Jr., and Mrs. Walter Snyder, all of Waverly, Rt. 3, Mrs. Gib Breitenbach of Waverly, Mrs. A.
