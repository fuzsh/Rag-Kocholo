John received a shilling in the will of his father as he had already been given land.\n\nIn 1756 John bought from Christopher Robertson the 184 acres that had belonged to his brother Joseph Burton.He acquired also land that his brother Caleb inherited but disposed of the land he inherited from Caleb Ware.\n\nIn 1767 Henry Baker sold Burton 100 acres next to his own land and the county line.John Burton was head of a household of six whites and eight blacks in Chesterfield County in 1783.\n\nJohn Burton died in Chesterfield County (will dated 2 June 1799 , recorded 14 Oct. 1799 ). His wife was alive when he made his will but he did not name her.\n\nJohn Burton [7120.2.2.3.7.1], the fourth of his name, settled on his own plantation by 1772 when his father gave him a parcel of land on Nisoms Branch of Swift Creek.He was head of a household of three whites and 4 blacks in Chesterfield County in 1783.\n\nNancy Burton [7120.2.2.3.7.2] married MILES GIBSON according to her father?s will. Her brother William identified her as Nancy. Miles was a son of Miles Gibson who left ?1 Negro? to Nancy Gibson, daughter of Miles Gibson in his 1788-will.Miles? mother was Hannah who identified his daughters, Hannah and Nancy, in her 1793-will.\n\nIn July 1793 Nancy Gibson, orphan of Miles Gibson, chose William FINNEY as her guardian, and the court appointed Philip TURPIN guardian to Hannah.Miles was not dead. This action was in response to these young women becoming minor heirs to the estate of their grandmother Gibson.\n\nElizabeth Gibson [7120.2.2.3.7.2.1] was a legatee of the will of her uncle William Burton.\n\nNancy Gibson [7120.2.2.3.7.2.2] (c.1770) was a legatee of the 1788-will of her paternal grandfather. She married Obadiah Flournoy in Chesterfield County 24 March 1798.\n\nHannah Gibson [7120.2.2.3.7.2.3] was a legatee of the 1793-will of her grandmother Hannah Gibson. The court appointed Aaron Haskins her guardian 13 October 1794 and she chose William Flournoy 12 September 1796.\n\nHannah married Richard Cundiff in Chesterfield County 9 April 1799.Surety was Jacob Flournoy.\n\n____\n\n1775-1776\n\nBute Co.

Yet we do know that he was in the Colony and married to Margaret in 1678 when they witnessed a bond in Henrico County. One year later, William Farrar and his wife Priscilla Baugh conveyed a tract of land to Thomas.\n\nSome have placed Margaret Lockett as a daughter of Thomas Osborne who assigned his headright of Alex Wood to Thomas Lockett.This assignment, dated 5 November 1677, and recorded 1 February 1683/4 only suggests that Thomas Lockett was Osborne?s son-in-law. Yet no evidence remains that Thomas had a daughter named Margaret.\n\nFamily Thumbnail\n\nLO Thomas Lockett (?1686)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHis children:\n\n1Benjamin Lockett (1669?c.1735)\n\n2Thomas Lockett (?1745)\n\n3James Lockett (c.1675?1708)\n\n4Susan (Lockett) Grigg\n\n5Elizabeth (Lockett) Standley\n\n6Mary (Lockett) Mitchell\n\nThomas was a planter and owned property but no land patents have been found for him. Nor have marriage records been found for him. This may be because he was a Quaker, as some believe. Thomas was several times a Henrico County juror and grand jury foreman.\n\nHe died in Henrico County in 1686 (will dated 27 Mar. 1686 , recorded 1 June 1686).\n\nIn 1690 Samuel Fowler sued the widow Lockett in Henrico County court.He claimed she owed him 22 shillings for curing her steer but she said she told him quit ?meddling any more with it? after his bill reached 10 shillings. The court agreed with Margaret. The court had previously concluded that Fowler had ?extravagantly charged? Francis Maybury.\n\nFowler had more trouble in the same court. John James said Fowler ?and all his Generation were banished persons and that they had left their Country to save their necks from the halter.? Fowler pressed charges but James?s attorney convinced the justices that Fowler had no case.\n\nIn December 1691 Henrico County reimbursed Bristol Parish 200 pounds of tobacco ?paid to ye widdow Lockett in the last Levy for care of ye children? of Evan Owen and his wife, Margery, who had both died.\n\nMargaret Lockett was a headright for Benjamin Harrison in January 1717/8and may have made a visit to England. Margaret (Osborne) Lockett died in Henrico County 1708 (will dated 22 May 1708 , recorded 1 July 1708).\n\nBenjamin Lockett (1669?c.1735) [LO.1]\n\nBenjamin Lockett (1669 ) married Winifred Pride in Henrico County 15 February 1692/3.See their family\n\nThomas Lockett (?1745) [LO.2]\n\nThomas Lockett II married Elizabeth.\n\nIn September 1730 Thomas secured patents for land on Butterwood Creek in Goochland (later Cumberland, now Powhatan) County: 400 acreson the north side next to John Pride and 900 acreson the south side next to land of Samuel Hancock and Arthur Moseley. In 1726 Lockett bought 100 acresfrom Hancock and Moseley, part of their patent of 22 February 1724/5.\n\nLockett was a tithable in Goochland County about 1733and was still living in Goochland in September 1738 when he sold his son Thomas III a 200-acre portion of his Butterwood Creek patent.In October 1734 Thomas sold 420 acres in Goochland County to Arthur Moseley.Elizabeth relinquished her dower right in the land.\n\nIn March 1739 Lockett expanded his holdings with a patent of 360 acresup against the Henrico County line. On 13 September 1739, Thomas sold 300 acresof his patents to Benjamin Moseley of Henrico County. Thomas got a patent to 200 acresin Amelia (now Prince Edward) County 30 June 1743.\n\nSoutham Parish charged Thomas Lockett with two tithables, himself and James Lockett, in 1747.We are not sure of the identity of this James Lockett. Thomas? brother of this name was dead so perhaps he was Thomas? son who predeceased his father. The only other know man of this name is James Lockett, but he lived in Amelia County.\n\nLockett died in Goochland County by 16 March 1745/6 when sub-sheriff John Woodson sold his estate.\n\nChildren of Thomas and Elizabeth (?) Lockett:\n\nThomas Lockett III [LO.2.1] (-c.1775) as ?Tho.s Locket Jun.r? was a single tithable in Goochland County in about 1732. In March 1743 Thomas Lockett of Goochland with wife, Elizabeth, sold 70 acreson Swift Creek in Henrico County to John Ragan. He inherited 200 acres in Amelia (now Prince Edward) County on Falling Creek and 200 acres purchased from Edward Harris. He later secured more land on Falling Creek: 342 acresin July 1742, a 200-acre portion of which he renewed in June 1743 , and 989 acresin August 1747. On 20 May 1749, Thomas Lockett ?of Cumberland County? bought 400 acresin Amelia County from Thomas Williamson and in May 1750 he sold 690 acreson Falling Creek to William Campbell. He bought 100 acresin Amelia from Robert Farguson Sr. in February 1764.\n\nThomas Lockett?s wife was Elizabeth when she relinquished a dower right in a 1750 Amelia County deedand Judith when he wrote his will twenty years later. While some believe she was Elizabeth Judith Townes, the wide gap among the births of his children suggest two wives.\n\nAlthough he held land in and paid taxes to Amelia County, Thomas lived in Southam Parish of Powhatan County where records of 1747 show him processioning land.\n\nThomas died in Cumberland County (will dated 8 Sept. 1770 , recorded 23 Jan. 1775) recognizing his wife, Judith, in his will. In 1776 several Cumberland County inhabitants petitioned the ?Colony of Virginia? to divide the county into two.Among the petitioners were Abner Lockett, Gideon Lockett, Benjamin Lockett, and Jacob A. Lockett. They created Powhatan County from Cumberland the following year. Widow Judith died before 21 February 1782 when Powhatan County appointed administrators for her estate.\n\nJames Lockett [LO.2.1.1] married Hannah Hawkins Llewellyn. James Lockett appeared as a tithable in Amelia County first in 1753. James Lockett ?of Amelia County? secured a patent to 400 acresin Chesterfield County in May 1763. He sold this land to his father, Thomas Lockett , who with his wife, Judith, conveyed it to Edward Johnson in June 1773.\n\nStephen Lockett [LO.2.1.2] (14 Nov. 1733 - 14 Sept. 1794) married Mary Clay.See their family\n\nDavid Lockett [LO.2.1.3] (1730-1796) was in Cumberland County when he and other concerned inhabitants asked the General Assembly to retain Rev. Christopher MacRae.David Lockett signed a petition in Powhatan County in 1777 renouncing allegiance to the king.\n\nDavid Lockett married Sally Lucy Winfrey and settled in Wilkes County, Georgia, after the Revolution. He died in Warren County in 1796 (will dated 7 Jan. 1796, recorded 12 Mar. 1796).\n\nCapt. Abner Lockett [LO.2.1.4] (c.1743-1790) married Anne Phoebe Marshall.See their family\n\nJacob A.

Johnson d. 2001\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBland Ballard b. 1722-30, son of Thomas Ballard and his first wife Sarah. Ref. Intrepid Ballards, 3rd Edition, 1995, by Miriam K. Ballard-Pringle.\n\nThe birth date of Bland is thought to be between 1722 when his father Thomas is listed in an Essex County Court record with his wife Sarah, and 1730, with the approximate b. date of his first child being 1752. This is a reasonable date. He probably was b. in Essex Co. His father Thomas was said in a 1738 land purchase to be \"of Caroline Co.\" Nothing is known of his early life prior to Nov. 1771 when the following record was made. On 14 Nov 1771, he was ordered to help in the processioning of some lands in Fredericksville Parish of Albemarle Co., with John Ballard and Robert MICHIE*****.\n\nIn 1777 he is named as a reader at the Upper Church. For this service he was paid 1040 pounds of tobacco. He is on a list of clerks or readers.\n\nHe is listed in the 1779 will of his father, Thomas Ballard. He and his father Thomas were witnesses to the 1780 will of his uncle John. His first marriage about 1752 to an undetermined woman, was unknown, until research on the Shiflett family revealed that Frances could not be the mother of all 15 of his children. She was younger than most of his children. He m(2) probably in the early 1780s, Frances Shiflett, a daughter of John Shiflett and his wife Joice Powell. No marriage records are known for Albemarle Co. before the 1780s. 1786 was the year that Albemarle Co. took over the responsibility of recording marriages from the parish churches. The parish system was disbanded in 1785. Bland's son, Garland, was shown in the 1850 Census of Todd Co., KY, as born in 1786. Bland's daughter, Peachy, was shown in the same census as b. 1787.\n\nOn 27 Sep 1793 John Shiflett and wife Joice gave to their daughter Frances Ballard and her daughter Martha 60 acres of land. In Apr 1795 an inventory of the estate of John Shiflett decd. included a bond on Bland Ballard for 5 pounds. On 5 Sep 1796 Joice Shiflett, Bland Ballard and Franky his wife and the other heirs of John Shiflett decd. sold some land to Phillip SEALE.\n\nHe listed in his will the names of 15 children. There is a group of nine sons and daughters which he calls \"beloved\" but leaves them only $1.00 apiece. The others he leaves substantial property and money. This would not seem to be the way to treat \"beloved\" children UNLESS they were from an earlier marriage and he had provided for them before he married Frances Shiflett. There is another indication that they may be from an earlier marriage and that is, there is seemingly a gap of over 15 years between the birth dates of the groups of children. They are able to be grouped by their type of legacy, and then, when approximate b. dates are given to most, the gap of years appears.\n\nDerby in Ballard-Ballord Bits, p. 208, said Bland died in Shelby Co., KY in 1809, but he confused this Bland with the family of Bland b. 1700 who did go to Shelby Co. I can find no record that this Bland ever left Albemarle Co. He made his will in Albemarle in June 1809 and it was filed for probate there in Nov. 1809.\n\n14 Nov 1771 Fredericksville Parish Vestry Book, p. 98 Ordered that Robert MICHIE, Bland Ballard and John Ballard do procession the lands between Buckmountain and Henry's Creek, the Road and the River\n\n24 Mar 1777 Fredericksville Parish Vestry Book, p. 109 to Bland Ballard as reader at the upper church and Cask - 1040 pounds tobacco in another list he is listed as a clerk or reader\n\n27 Sep 1793 John Shiflett and Joyce his wife to Frances Ballard daughter to said John Joyce Shiflett and Martha Ballard said Frances daughter for love and affection and 5 shillings 60 acres\n\n.............................................................his\n\nWit: Thos BURTON***...................John x Shiflett\n\nDeed Book 11, p. 141-3............mark\n\nrecorded Oct Court 1793\n\n..............................................................her\n\n..................................................Joyce x Shiflett\n\n...........................................................mark\n\n1795 Inventory of estate of John Shiflett decd included 1 bond on Bland Ballard for 5 L recorded in court 1795\n\nWill Book 3, p. 251-3\n\n1 Sep 1796 deed from Frances Shiflett, Bland Ballard and Franky his wife, [and the other named heirs of John Shiflett decd] to Phillip Seale\n\nrecorded Sept. court 1796\n\nAlbemarle Co.
