        "text": "The Andrew Johnson National Historic Site preserves the historic Tailor Shop, two homes, and burial site of the 17th President of the United States. Born into an impoverished family in Raleigh, NC, Johnson was apprenticed to a tailor at the age of nine. He eventually settled in Greeneville, TN and began his own tailoring business. It was in Greeneville that he married and started his family, and here he was first elected to the office of Alderman. His 40-year political journey begun, he would hold nearly every elected office on the path to the Presidency. He remains the only President to return to the Senate following his time in the Executive Mansion.\n\nJohnson's humble Tailor Shop is now enclosed within a Memorial Building, which also houses a small presidential museum. The attached Visitor Center provides orientation and a 13-minute film. The Early Home across the street reflects Johnson's modest rise in Greeneville society. The Homestead, a larger home on Main Street, is the home where Johnson lived both before and after his presidency. It is filled with 85% of original belongings, and is open for guided tour.\n\nMonument Hill, the Johnson family burial site, is now a National Cemetery. Here you can reflect on the ideals of sacrifice and duty as you peer at the rows of headstones, as well as Johnson's obelisk topped by an American eagle. His inscription reads \"His Faith in the People Never Wavered.\""
