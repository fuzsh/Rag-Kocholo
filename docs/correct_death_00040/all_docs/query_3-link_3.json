        "text": "The Andrew Johnson National Historic Site is comprised of four units:\n\nThe Visitor Center\n\n101 N. College Street, Greeneville, TN\n\nThe Visitor Center sits on the corner of College and Depot Streets in historic downtown Greeneville, TN. It is the contact station for visitor information, brochures, and directions. Here you will find the site's 13 1/2 minute orientation film and the Eastern National bookstore. Adjoining the Visitor Center, the Memorial Building houses the presidential museum, as well as Andrew Johnson's original 1830's Tailor Shop. Tickets for the tour of the Andrew Johnson Homestead are available at the Visitor Center, unless unforseen events such as maintenance, weather, or staffing necessitate it's closure.\n\n​\n\nThe Early Home\n\n201 East Depot Street, Greeneville, TN\n\nThe last acquisition to the site, Andrew Johnson's Early Home tells the story of the tailor-turned-politician. Andrew and Eliza's family lived in this house from the 1830's until 1851, when they moved into the larger Homestead several blocks away.\n\nThe unfurnished Early Home is open on the first level with exhibit panels that tell the story of Andrew Johnson's early life - from his impoverished childhood as an apprentice in Raleigh, NC to his arrival in Greeneville and his entrance into the political world.\n\nWhen you step inside this home, you will learn about the growth of the Johnson family and the purchase of his first slaves in the place where it all began. The Early Home is open during park business hours.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe Homestead\n\n209 S. Main St., Greeneville, TN\n\n​\n\nThe Homestead is open on a guided tour basis at 10:30 & 11:30 am and 1:30 & 2:30 pm during park business hours. Tours are free but tickets are required to maintain a tour size of no more than 10 visitors on a first-come/first-served basis. Tickets are available until 15 minutes prior to tour time at the Visitor Center. You may walk or drive to the Homestead. Parking is available.\n\nFacemasks are currently optional while touring the Homestead. Other arrangements may be made for organized groups of 11 or more people. For additional information contact the park visitor center at (423) 638-3551.\n\nAndrew Johnson owned this home 24 years, and lived here both before and after his presidency. During the Civil War, soldiers occupied the house and left it in disrepair. The Johnsons renovated the home when they returned from Washington, filling it with Victorian furnishings and political gifts. Three generations of the family occupied the home before placing it in the stewardship of the National Park Service. The Homestead is filled with many original family belongings and memorabilia.\n\nClick for more information on how to tour the Homestead...\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe National Cemetery\n\n121 Monument Ave., Greeneville, TN\n\nAndrew Johnson and his family are buried at the crest of Monument Hill. The Andrew Johnson National Cemetery served as an active NPS burial ground for the nation's veterans until 2019. The cemetery is open daily for vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Recreational activities are not allowed.\n\nBe advised that due to the narrow roadway and tight turn on Monument Avenue, RVs, mobile homes, charter buses or vehicles with trailers are prohibited from the National Cemetery.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThough not part of the historic site, there are two additional places of interest adjacent to the park:\n\n​\n\nThe Birthplace Replica\n\nProvided by Andrew Johnson's estate, this replica of Andrew Johnson's birthplace in Raleigh, North Carolina, will give you the true scope of Johnson's rise from humble beginnings.\n\nThe replica is open during park business hours, from 9:00 am - 4:00 pm. Exceptions include winter schedule closures, inclement weather, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Eves/Days. The grounds are accessible anytime.\n\n​\n\nStatue of Andrew Johnson\n\nSculpted by Jim Gray, and also provided through Andrew Johnson's estate, the commanding figure of Andrew Johnson is mounted on the corner of College and Depot Streets in downtown Greeneville, TN, overlooking the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site.\n\nAnother cast of the statue stands on the Capitol grounds in Nashville, TN, where Johnson served as Representative and Senator, as well as both Governor and Military Governor of the state."
