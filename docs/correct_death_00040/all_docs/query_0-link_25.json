By sundown that day the chubby-cheeked little boy was dead from an attack by two dogs. He will be buried tomorrow.\n\nThe fatal attack occurred at the home of Claude W. Henley on Old Alto Highway.\n\nThe boys grandfather is employed on Mr. Henleys farm. The grandfather went there to turn in his hours and pick up a paycheck, said Investigator Robert Campbell of the Franklin County Sheriffs Department.\n\nThe boy went inside the Henley home with his grandfather, but a short time later he left the house and walked into the back yard.\n\nThe boy snuck out, and they didnt notice him, but soon after they heard what was going on outside, Campbell said.\n\nIn the back yard, Corey met Henleys two dogs, a Rottweiler and a Rottweiler mixture.\n\nWe dont know how it started, Campbell said.\n\nBut the ending is painfully clear. In an attack that lasted only a minute or two, the sheriffs investigator said, the dogs bit the boy multiple times, on the neck, face, arms and legs.\n\nThe two men ran from the house and pulled the dogs off the boy, and he was rushed to Southern Tennessee Medical Center in Winchester. About an hour later, he was taken by air ambulance to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he died.\n\nThe dogs, which had never been a source of complaints before, were put to sleep after the attack. Their cadavers will be tested for rabies, the officer noted.\n\nMeanwhile, the small Alto community has been shocked by the dog mauling.\n\nGladys Rose, owner of Roses Grocery, frequently saw Corey and his grandfather. Her country store was a place for them to get a snack.\n\nHed always wave to me and say, Bye, Miss Rose,  she said.\n\nAuthorities said no criminal charges have been filed, but the investigation is continuing. Family members question why two large dogs such as Henleys were not in a fenced yard.\n\nI think they probably should have been, said Coreys aunt, Mary Harvill of Manchester. She added: Ive never known Corey to provoke a dog, ever.\n\nThe boys uncle, Thomas Scott Alford of Tullahoma, called Corey a quiet little boy, never one to get into mischief.\n\nFuneral services will be at 3 p.m. tomorrow at Manchester Funeral Home.\n\nThe little boy is also survived by his parents, Jerry Wayne and Katherine Ann Alford of Hillsboro, two teenage brothers, Jimmy Earl McClure and Tony Ray McClure of Decherd, and an older sister, Ruthie Arnold of Manchester.\n\nPhoto from Fountain Grove Cemetery, Fountain Grove, Coffee Co., TNwww.findagrave.com\n\nPermission granted by the photographer, Johnnie Porter Wellman\n\nAAFA NOTES: See the obituary of his father, Jerry Wayne Alford, in this compilation.\n\n******************************************\n\nCUMINE ALFORD TOMLINSON CHRANE\n\nSource unknown\n\n_____ November 1996\n\nIncluded in AAFA ACTION, Spring 1999\n\nMT.
