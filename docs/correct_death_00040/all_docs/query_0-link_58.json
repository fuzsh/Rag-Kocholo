Frederic Holt Brandt, age 88, passed away peacefully at home on December 10, 2023. Fred Brandt touched many people in every aspect of his life. Through his kindness and generosity of spirit, he gained the love and respect of everyone he encountered. Fred was a lifelong resident of Johnson City, born on May 22, 1935, to the late George Franklin Brandt and Rosalie Jennings Brandt. He graduated from Science Hill High School in 1953 and received a BS from the University of Tennessee in 1957. Fred was in the U.S. Army from 1957-58 and in the Army Reserves from 1958-1966 where he attained the rank of Captain. In 1959 he graduated from the University of Tennessee Law School and began in private practice. Fred worked until a few months ago, continuing as he always had, to provide legal advice, words of wisdom, and kindness to his clients. Fred not only had a long and well-respected career in Law, but also served the Johnson City community through his active participation in various organizations. He served as a Director of the Johnson City Boys Club, the Tennessee Mental Health Association, the Tri-City Head Injury Association and the Watauga Area Mental Health Center. Fred was also a member of the Salvation Army Board, the Crumley House Foundation Board and the Vestry at St. John’s Episcopal Church.

William, known by his friends and family as WR had survived his siblings Sue King Jones, Gwen King Hale, and Boyd King, all from Johnson City, and survived his youngest brother, Billy Joe King of Greensboro, NC. They celebrate his arrival in heaven and the angels sing as his earthly family weeps.

WR and Loeva have numerous loving nieces and nephews throughout Johnson City, Shelton Laurel, Greensboro, Oakridge, NC, West Palm Beach, FL, Orlando, FL, Indiana, and Alabama. Although William was born in Shelton Laurel, NC, he grew up in Johnson City. He relocated to Greensboro, NC where he worked and retired from the City of Greensboro and raised his family. He moved back to Johnson City in the late ‘90s and lived happily until the time of his death. He and Loeva both attended Ashbury Grammar School in Johnson City. They are members of East Pine Grove Park Methodist Church where a Celebration of Life will be held. William was a kind and gentle spirit like no other earthly person. He already had his wings when he arrived here. His heart was full of goodness and love. He was a loving and endearing husband, father, and teacher of all things. He was a master storyteller and loved to tell a good joke. He was funny and easy going, lighthearted, and patient. WR was an animal whisperer who loved feeding his squirrels and birds who trusted him enough to eat right from his hands through the kitchen window. He spoke dog language somehow and always had companions throughout his life. He never met a stranger and would give the shirt off his back if he saw someone in need. He was just too good for this world. He often said that he was tired, and his body was just worn out. The family finds comfort in the fact that he lived a long and fruitful life and that was ready to go. He said had a blessed life and had been happy. He knew he was loved right up until the last minute, and he made sure we knew that he loved us too. He was at home in bed surrounded by family at the time of his passing. Exactly the way he wanted it. Please join the family at East Pine Grove Park Methodist Church for a Celebration of Life on Sunday, January 7th 2024 at 2:00 pm (2215 E Unaka Ave, Johnson City).

He graduated from Bethany College (BA), Drew University (MDiv), and Pittsburgh Theological Seminary (DMin) and was recipient of several honorary degrees. In 1992 he was named a Distinguished West Virginian by Governor Gaston Caperton. For 72 years he was married to Mary Lou Naylor Grove, whom he knew since childhood and who was his partner in life and ministry. They were parents of two daughters. Bishop Grove was ordained in 1954 in the Pittsburgh Conference of the Methodist Church, where he served four pastoral appointments and was elected delegate to the General and Jurisdictional Conferences from 1968 through 1980. In 1980 he was elected and consecrated a bishop and assigned to the West Virginia Episcopal Area (1980-92) and the Albany (NY) Area (1992-96).

In 1996 he was named Ecumenical Officer of the Council of Bishops, the first to hold that office. He led United Methodist delegations to the National Council of Churches, the Consultation on Church Union, and the World Council of Churches Assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe. Bishop Grove had deep and abiding love for the mountains and the people of Appalachia, especially West Virginia, where he and Mary Lou returned in retirement and lived until moving to Johnson City, TN in 2017 to be near family. He chaired the Appalachian Development Committee for the UMC and worked tirelessly to advocate for the region. Bishop Grove was a poet and hymn-writer.
