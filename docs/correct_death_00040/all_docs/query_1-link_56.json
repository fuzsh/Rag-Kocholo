        "text": "Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Andrew Johnson became the 17th president of the United States upon the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in April 1865. His lenient Reconstruction policies toward the South, and his vetoing of Reconstruction acts, embittered the Radical Republicans in Congress and led to his political downfall and impeachment, though he was acquitted. Johnson died in Tennessee on July 31, 1875."
