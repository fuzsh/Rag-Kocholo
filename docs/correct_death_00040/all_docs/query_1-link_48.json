        "meta_description": "Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, N.C. in 1808 to Mary (Polly) McDonough and Jacob Johnson (d. 1811). Johnson moved to Greeneville, Tennessee as a young man. He served as a pre-Civil War Tennessee State Representative, U.S. Representative, Governor of Tennessee, Vice President of the United States, President of the United States, and U.S. Senator until his death in 1875.Includes three documents from Johnson's Tennessee governorship, 1854; two original letters, one from Gov. Jonathon Worth (Jan. 1866) expressing state's gratitude for restoration of civil government and support for President Johnson's policies; and one to Nashville, Tenn. judge and fellow Unionist, John C. Gant (June 1872). There are typed extracts from memoirs of Dr. A. Jobe that concern a visit by Johnson to Raleigh and Chapel Hill (1867) and the erection of a monument in a Raleigh cemetery to his father, Jacob. Also in the collection are photographs of buildings and monuments relating to Johnson and miscellaneous printed material. There is genealogical information and copies of material, including a marriage bond of Johnson's parents and a reward poster (1824) for escaped bound apprentices, Andrew and his brother, William.",
