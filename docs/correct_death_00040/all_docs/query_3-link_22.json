        "text": "Complete Guide to Andrew Johnson National Historic Site in Tennessee including things to do, History, nearby lodging, directions, and so much more.\n\nAndrew Johnson National Historic Site\n\nAndrew Johnson was the seventeenth President of the United States. He is one of the least known presidents except for the fact that Congress tried to Impeach him and really to understand the man you need to see where he was coming from.\n\nYou can visit the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site in Greenville, Tennessee to learn more about Andrew Johnson.\n\nAbout Andrew Johnson National Historic Site\n\nAndrew Johnson National Historic Site is located in Greeneville, Tennessee. The site honors the 17th president of the United States, who took over after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.\n\nThis site consists of four locations – two of Johnson’s homes, his tailor shop, and his final resting place.\n\nHe was a Southerner who remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War and somehow that did not make him popular with anyone except Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAndrew Johnson's history in Greenville TN goes back to his childhood. He was born in Raleigh North Carolina in 1808 and apprenticed to a tailor there while still very young. He and his brother ran away from their apprenticeship and ended up in Greenville when Andrew was 17.\n\nHe set himself up as a tailor and the next year he married a local girl Eliza McCardle whose father was a bootmaker. They had five children together.\n\nIn time Andrews tailor shop became the place to discuss politics in Greenville and thus began his political career. He was a state representative, a state senator, governor of TN and senator from Tennessee.\n\nHe was, in fact, the only senator from a Southern State who retained his seat in the Senate after the south seceded from the Union.\n\nIn 1862 Abraham Lincoln named him as the Military Governor of Tennessee. In 1864 he was chosen to be the running mate of Lincoln even though he was a Democrat and Lincoln was a Republican.\n\nWhen Lincoln was assassinated Johnson was thrust in the position of President, a position not to be envied even under the best of circumstances, these were the worst of times.\n\nNo president before or after has gone into office with better intentions and ended with such a sense of defeat.\n\nHis story is one that deserves to be told and the US Park Department has done a very good job at this location of doing just that.\n\nThere are three distinctive and separate buildings that make up this historic site.\n\nThere is parking at the homestead and at the Visitor Center. The first Johnson home is located across the street from the National Park Service Visitor Center closest to the parking lot. It is a small house with small rooms, the type of home typical to a successful tailor in the 1830s & 40s.\n\nYou then cross the street and enter the Visitor Center. There is a thirteen-and-a-half-minute video that tells the story of Andrew Johnson, this is a very good video and well worth sitting down and watching.\n\nWhen you exit the movie you are handed a ballot and asked to vote whether you think he should have been found guilty or innocent at his impeachment trial.\n\nAlso inside the Visitor Center is the original tailor shop where so many lively political debates took place.\n\nYou will also see a wedding suit that was made by Andrew Johnson when he was a tailor. This has to be one of the most unique items ever in a Presidential historic site.\n\nWhile you are at the Visitor Center you need to sign up for a tour of the Homestead which takes place on the half hour.\n\nWhile the other locations are about professional life the Johnson Homestead is about personal life. It is located several blocks from the Visitor Center. There is a real sadness that pervades this part of the experience.\n\nEliza Johnson suffered from tuberculosis and was unable to function as First Lady. All three of the Johnson sons died from the results of alcoholism under tragic circumstances.\n\nDuring the War, the house was repeatedly vandalized and the tour will show you just a small section of the wall with the graffiti still visible.\n\nThere is one last site to visit, the Johnson Family Cemetery. High above the hill overlooking Greenville are the graves of the 17th President of the United States and his family.\n\nHe was buried with a copy of the Constitution which he so revered under his head and wrapped in an American flag.\n\nIs Andrew Johnson National Historic Site worth visiting?\n\nYes, the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site is worth visiting for those interested in American history and the presidency.\n\nIt offers an immersive experience into the life and legacy of Andrew Johnson through exhibits, tours, and educational programs.\n\nWe really enjoyed learning more about Andrew Johnson's life in east Tennessee and his road to the White House.\n\nHistory of Andrew Johnson National Historic Site\n\nJohnson became president as the Civil War was ending. A Democrat, Johnson ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket.\n\nAlthough the war was ending, the nation was at a great juncture point trying to create a reconstruction plan to unite a country.\n\nJohnson’s plan for reconstruction included pardons being granted for white southerners who took an oath of loyalty.\n\nAs for the case of loyal Republicans, Johnson strongly disagreed on the status that African Americans should be granted in American society.\n\nThis led to much conflict with the Republican-dominant Congress. Tensions rose and when Johnson breached the Tenure of Office Act by removing Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, the House of Representatives impeached him in February of 1868.\n\nIn the end, Johnson was acquitted by one vote and he served as president until March of 1869. Johnson was the first president in history to be impeached, as a nation was struggling to agree upon a successful post-war America.\n\nJohnson was born in Raleigh, North Carolina in December of 1808. Johnson was born into poverty to his father Jacob and mother Mary.\n\nJohnson’s father died when he was just three and his mother had to support Johnson and his brother as a laundress.\n\nShe eventually remarried to a man who was just as poor as she was. Johnson’s brother was illiterate and Johnson never attended school.\n\nHis mother apprenticed him as a tailor and it was while working in the tailor shop that Johnson developed a love of learning; local residents would come to read to the tailors while they worked.\n\nIn 1826, Johnson moved to Greeneville, Tennessee with his mother and stepfather.\n\nJust west of the Great Smoky Mountains in northwest Tennessee, Johnson fell in love with the beauty of Greeneville. Johnson began his own tailor business which grew very successful over the years.\n\nIn 1827, at the age of 18, Johnson married 16-year-old Eliza McCardle, the daughter of a local shoemaker who died when Eliza was a young teen.\n\nThe couple was married at her widowed mother’s home by Mordecai Lincoln, a paternal uncle to Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAndrew and Eliza were married for nearly 50 years and had five children.\n\nThe couple bought their first home in the 1830s, a small, two-story brick house on the corner of Water and Depot Street.\n\nNot long after, Johnson bought a small wooden structure which he moved across from the family home to house his tailor shop.\n\nAs was the case back in North Carolina, Johnson hired people to read to him while he worked in the shop. The location also grew as a popular spot for locals to visit and debate. Johnson was a master orator and loved debating townsfolk who held opposing views from his own.\n\nAround 1829, the well liked tailor from Greeneville began making a name for himself politically. Johnson went from Greeneville Alderman, to town mayor and then State Representative.\n\nHe then served as a U.S. Representative from 1843-1853. Through these years, Eliza, a loyal and supportive wife and mother, was busy raising children, managing the home, and helping her husband study math and reading.\n\nBy 1951, Johnson’s family numbered seven and he had just bought his first two slaves. The family needed more room so they purchased a larger home on Main Street.\n\nAt this point in time, Johnson also owned rental properties and a farm. The home on Main is where the family lived before and also after Johnson served as president.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Union soldiers had occupied the family home and left it in disrepair. The family renovated the home upon returning from Washington.\n\nToday, the home is as close to the time period as a location can get for being nearly seven decades old. More than half of the items inside the house are original family belongings.\n\nAndrew Johnson died on July 31, 1875 at the age of 66, after suffering two strokes. His funeral was held in Greeneville, and per his wishes, Johnson was buried wrapped in an American flag with a copy of the U.S. Constitution under his head.\n\nHis final resting place was on a hill just outside Greeneville. In 1901, Johnson’s daughter Margaret willed the burial ground to the federal government for use as a public park and the site was dedicated as the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in 1906.\n\nAfter Johnson’s death in 1875, the gravesite expanded into a small plot for his immediate family.\n\nTwo of Johnson’s sons who died before him had to be reinterred so to be laid to rest next to their father. Andrew Johnson’s monument, with a towering 28-foot marble statue, is the center of the plot.\n\nIt depicts the United States Constitution, an eagle, and the Bible. The cemetery conveys many characteristics of a small country cemetery, with aspects that remind the visitor of architecture during the late Victorian era.\n\nHaving had tuberculosis for many years of her life, Eliza struggled with poor health throughout her marriage and spent more of her time as the first lady in her bedroom.\n\nEliza died less than six months after her husband and was laid to rest in the family plot. The cemetery today is the only National Cemetery controlled by the United States Department of the Interior, accepting new interments to include soldiers of World Wars.\n\nThings to know before your visit to Andrew Johnson National Historic Site\n\nEntrance fee\n\n$0.00 - There is no entrance fee or park pass required for visiting the park.\n\nPlanning a National Park vacation?
