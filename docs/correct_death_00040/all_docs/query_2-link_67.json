        "text": "Transcription\n\nWashington City DC\n\nApril 15, 1865, -\n\nSir:\n\nAbraham Lincoln, President of the United States, was shot by an assassin last evening, at Ford's Theater in this city and died at the hour of 22 minutes of seven o'clock.\n\nAbout the same time at which the President was shot, an assassin entered the back chamber of the house of Wm H. Seward, Secretary of State, and stabbed him in several places,\n\nin the throat, neck, and face, severely if not mortally wounding him. Other members of the Secretary's family were dangerously wounded by the assassin while making his escape.\n\nBy the death of President Lincoln, the office of President has devolved under the Constitution upon you. The emergency of the government demands that you should immediately qualify, according to the requirements of the Constitution and enter upon the duties of President of the United States. If you will please make known your pleasure, such arrangements as you deem proper will be made.\n\nYour Obedient Servants,\n\nHugh McCulloch Secretary of the Treasury\n\nEdwin M Stanten Secretary of War\n\nGideon Welles Secretary of Navy\n\nW. Dennison Postmaster General\n\nJ.P. Usher Secretary of the Interior\n\nJames Speed Attorney General"
