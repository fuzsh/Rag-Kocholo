        "text": "Born December 29, 1808, Andrew Johnson began his political career in Greeneville, Tenn. After serving as both alderman and mayor of Greeneville, Johnson successfully ran for a seat in the lower house of the state legislature in 1835. After serving three terms in the state Senate, Johnson moved to the United States House of Representatives, where he served for ten years, 1843-1853. He also served as Governor of Tennessee from 1853-1857. In the fall of 1857, he was chosen as a United States Senator.\n\nIn 1861, Johnson returned to East Tennessee to fight the surging secessionist movement, joining former political opponents such as William G. Brownlow, Thomas A. R. Nelson, Horace Maynard, and others in his support of the Union. After a June 8 referendum in which Tennesseeans voted for secession, Johnson returned to Washington to escape physical harm.\n\nAfter the Federal capture of Forts Henry and Donelson and the occupation of Nashville in February 1862, however, President Lincoln sent Johnson back to Tennessee to serve as military governor, a position in which he was charged to restore civil government and bring the state back to the Union. In 1864, the Republicans nominated Johnson as Lincoln's running mate because of his staunch Unionism as a War Democrat. After Lincoln's assassination on April 14, 1865, Johnson was sworn in as the seventeenth President of the United States.\n\nJohnson faced the difficult task of reconstructing the nation in the wake of the Civil War as he assumed the presidency. Johnson and Congress clashed over control of Reconstruction, and in 1868, the House Republicans in Congress impeached Johnson, the first president to face impeachment. Johnson's presidency was spared by a single vote in the Senate.\n\nFollowing his tumultuous presidency, Johnson returned to Greeneville, eager for vindication. In 1874, he became the first former President of the United States to win a seat in the United States Senate. However, four months after taking his seat in the Senate, Johnson suffered a stroke and died on July 31, 1875. He was buried wrapped in a American flag with his head resting on a copy of the Constitution.\n\nThe Andrew Johnson Papers Project began in the mid-1950s as part of a larger trend toward projects for the collection and publication of presidential papers. It was funded by the National Historical Publications Commission (now the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC)), a statutory body affiliated with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The project was headed by University of Tennessee historians LeRoy Graf and Ralph Haskins and later by Paul Bergeron. The project became part of the Tennessee Presidents Center in 1987, joining the papers projects of the three Tennessee presidents, Andrew Johnson, Andrew Jackson, and James K. Polk. The first volume of The Papers of Andrew Johnson was published in 1967 and the project was completed July 31, 2000. The volumes cover the years 1858 to 1875."
