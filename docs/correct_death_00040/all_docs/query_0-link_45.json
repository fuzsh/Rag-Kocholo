She was born 1886 in Virginia, and died 1919 in Wise County, Virginia.\n\nNotes for ROBERT PATTON \"PAT\" BOATRIGHT:\n\nFamily legend has it that someone killed \"Tucker\" (Pat's son). Later on, Robert (went by Pat), who was a moonshiner, got the killer to the cabib under the pretense of a moonshine deal and killed him. Pat was sent to Richmond Prison for a fairly long time, getting out during World War II. The children were split up and put in foster care. Their names were: Minnie, Bonnie, Pearl, Minnie, Marvin, William, Hester, Henry and Georgia. I don't think Georgia survivied childhood. My grandmother (Hester) told me she died of burns when her dress caught fire from sparks from the fireplace. Pat was married to T. Alinor Culbertson who died shortly after the birth of her last child. Source: Jo Williams, great-granddaughter of Pat Boatwright.\n\n1880 Census: Name: Isaac P.

Caudill):\n\n\"Aged Whitesburg Citizen Is Called\"\n\nDisabled and almost an invalid for several years and confined to his home on Solomon Branch of the town John Boatright, around seventy-seven, suffered a severe paralytic stroke some time Monday and passed away Tuesday evening. He was a son of the late G. H. Boatright, Sr., and was a native of Scott County.\n\nWhen a mere boy he came with his parents to Letcher County where in the years following he married and resided until his death. When a young man he married Mary, the young daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wesley Breeding of Camp Branch. The union was a happy one. Five children, three sons and two daughters, all of whom are married, were born into the family. These are Wm. H Boatright, for a number of years a leading citizen of Benham, Sam, an engineer residing at Jeff, Perry County, and Reuben, of detroit, Michigan. The two girls, Hattie and Pearl, both married, reside at McRoberts. He leaves, besides his widow, two or three brothers and one sister, Mrs. E. E. Bentley, that we recall.\n\nBurial took place in the family cemetery near the Wesley Breeding home on Camp Branch. John Boatright belonged to a highly honorable and reputable old Virginia family. Honesty, integrity, and straightforwardness ruled his life. It was our pleasure to know him for long years and we have not known a more trustworthy and dependable citizen. We extend sympathies to the widow, the children, and all the friends.\"\n\nNames of John and Mary's children were taken from a January 12, 1939, obituary published in the Mountain Eagle, Kentucky, newspaper.\n\n1870 Census: Name: John M Boatright Date: September 1, 1870 Estimated Birth Year: abt 1862 Age in 1870: 8 Birthplace: Virginia Home in 1870: Taylor, Scott, Virginia Race: White Gender: Male Value of real estate: $0 Post Office: Duncans Mill Roll: M593_1677 Page: 604 Image: 599 Year: 1870 1880 Census: Name: John M.
