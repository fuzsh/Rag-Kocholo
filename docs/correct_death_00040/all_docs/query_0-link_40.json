Hicks, laid to rest June 1982.\n\nMalcoln Dewitt Hicks, my precious daddy, was the son of Alonzo Dewitt Hicks and Carrie Wilbur Ray Hicks. Daddy was born in Deemer, Mississippi, but grew up in Calhoun County, Alabama. He served as an Army medic in the European Theatre during World War II.\n\nMalcoln married Johnnie Eleanor O'Kelley on 11 Oct 1947. They had two children: Carrie Elizabeth and Mary Jean.\n\nMalcoln Hicks was a dedicated Christian, a loving husband and father, and a man of strict integrity. He taught Sunday School classes for many years at Plum Springs Baptist Church (Eastaboga, Alabama). In addition to studying his Bible, his favorite hobby was fishing. He thoroughly enjoyed taking his young grandson, Chris, fishing with him. Sitting on the creek bank, communing with God and good friends, was Dad's way of relaxing.\n\nDaddy was a loving father, a strict disciplinarian, and a man of high moral integrity. He loved his wife (Johnnie), his daughters (Carrie and Mary), and his four grandchildren (Chris, Keri, Allison, and Bethany) so very, very much.\n\nWe were blessed to have him as our husband, father, and grandfather.\n\nHe was, and is, greatly loved, and greatly missed. We know where he is, and we know he is no longer plagued by the evil cancer that took his earthly life. We WILL see him again, what a joy!\n\n29.01--Carrie Elizabeth Hicks, CONTRIBUTOR facebook friend [PRIVATE]; m.

He attended Reserve Union High School in Reserve, NM. He was salutatorian of his graduating class.\n\nDuring the war years he worked for the Forest Service as lookout, trail worker and fire guard. In 1946 he entered New Mexico Highlands University and majored in pre-forestry.\n\nDue to a knee injury, he changed his major to Art. He received a BA degree in 1950 and returned that fall to work toward a MA degree, but was drafted that November. He served in the Second Armored Division as an armored infantryman and was sent to the German Occupation Forces. His art worked on in the company day room enabled him to win first place in the division until the requirement of a pool table was made; none of the company day rooms was large enough to accommodate one.\n\nAfter being discharged, he returned to New Mexico Highlands University for his MA degree and then taught art for three years at Montezuma County High School in Cortez, CO. In 1958 he attended Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and received his MFA degree in 1960.\n\nIn 1961 Mr. Kemp joined the Art Department at Baylor University. The major duties included crafts (except ceramics), three-dimensional design, drawing, and sculpture. At various times he taught painting, printmaking, life drawing, and sections of art education. Mr. Kemp was a charter member of the Faculty Senate. He retired after 36 years at Baylor University.\n\nMr. Kemp was preceded in death by his parents, Benjamin William Kemp and Mary Jewell Johnson; his first wife, Lois Kelley Graham; his second wife, Katherine L. Wilson Peeples; sister, Mary Ellen Kemp; step-son Robert E. Peeples; son-in-law, Ronald J. Lee; and grandsons, Sean Michael Lee and Erick J. Lee.\n\nHe is survived by stepdaughter, Patricia A. Peeples-Lee of Waco; stepson, Richard O. Peeples and wife, Carolyn, of Waco; daughter-in-law, Elizabeth Peeples of West Covina, California; grandsons, Ronald J. Lee, Danial W.

Gwin Note: Cousin Tonya Wilson sent me the following obituary for Edna M. Crawford.]\n\nEdna Marye Crawford\n\nFebruary 11, 1942 - November 19, 2014\n\nEdna Marye Wilson Crawford, born February 11, 1942, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, passed away peacefully on November 19, 2014 surrounded by her family.\n\nMarye loved family, friends, horses, and dogs, and rarely in that order. She would come to love countless pets over the years, with Belle her blue heeler at the top of the list. Her passion and commitment to those she loved knew no bounds.\n\nShe was a storyteller with a flair for the overly dramatic. She possessed and routinely exercised the uncanny ability to bring humor to situations that desperately needed it. In giving so much to others, there were times when Marye left little for herself. For the past six months, she faced improbable odds with a wry smile and a graceful blend of fear, hope, tears, sarcasm, and love for those near to her heart. She will forever live in our hearts, memories, and prayers.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Mittie Scott and Roger O'Neal Wilson; husband Jack William Crawford II, brother Robert Samuel Wilson, and sisters Katherine Louse Peeples Kemp and Agnes Effie Styles Simmons.\n\nThose left to cherish her memory are brother Roger Bernard Wilson, sister O'Levia Neil Wiese, daughters Carmen Gayle Parker and husband Wayne, and Kimberly Lea Crawford, sons Jack W. Crawford III (Trae) and wife Amy, Roger Kelly Crawford and wife Lori, and Russell Travis Crawford, 15 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 2:00 p.m. Saturday at Providence Funeral Home, 807 Carlos G. Parker Blvd. NW, Taylor, TX 76574.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Hope for Horses Equine Rescue, mailing address 8853 FM 974, Bryan, TX 77808 or website: www.hopeforhorses.com.\n\n29.01--Carmen Gayle Crawford facebook [PRIVATE] m.

In June 1900, Agnes would have been 16-17 years old, so she is likely the brand new bride of Robert B. Wilson. Adding credibility to this is the date of birth of their firstborn, Roger O.

Tonya\n\nHi Tonya. I just got your message. Very sorry to hear about his going. I believe he would've been 90 in just a few weeks--is that right? John\n\nWe think he might have already been 90, and about to be 91. His birthday is listed as 1920 or 1921--the records in small towns in those days were not always accurate. My Aunt Jo (his daughter) has some letters her great-grandmother, not on the Wilson side, wrote to Mamie (his mother) mentioning that \"Arbie was about 4 years old\"; if we can find those letters, which have a postmarked envelope, we can tell what year it was. I've also seen that my great-grandfather Att passed away in May of '68 while other places say it was in December of that year. I think it was probably in May, and not recorded until December.\n\nI am sad to see him go, but he's in heaven with Grandma; he got his life right with the Lord and apologized to all of the kids for anything hurtful he had done to any of them in the past; they all had a little more time together and got peace on a lot of things--we know that was God. I am glad that he's not in any more pain and has a sound mind again (he would come & go most days--that's another reason I know that time just before he passed was a gift from God).\n\nA pastor once told me that when someone who is saved passes, it isn't really like a goodbye so much as it is an \"I'll see you later\", and that thought is making this a lot easier.\n\n28.01--Mary Josephine \"Jo\" Wilson, b. unk.; m.

My mother was Augusta Clytee Cook.\n\nI live in Grass Valley, California. I have traveled to Alabama and Mississippi to visit family and to visit all the cemeteries and archives possible. I've also gone to Salt Lake City, UT, to the Mormon church to do a lot of research. Lucky for me all my ancestors, so far, came to the US from Scotland, England, and Ireland. I didn't have to learn to read another language to decipher old foreign records. My husband, John, studied German so he could read the old records.\n\nThanks for keeping me updated. Hope you have a great holiday season,\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrenda Faye (Purvis) Preuss\n\n27.06--Henry Wilson Cook, b. 24 Jun 1930 in Kemper Co., MS; d. 5 Jul 1987 in Eight Mile, AL; bd.
