These persons held in succession the Lyman C. Draper Fellowship in Western History, which was created by the Society as trustee of the Draper Fund, the in¬ come of the fund being used in part to pay the stipend ($500 per year) granted to the fellow. The work was under the superin¬ tendent’s general direction, but the immediate supervision was exercised by Doctor Louise Phelps Kellogg, Senior Research Associate. It was revised by Annie A. Nunns, Assistant Super¬ intendent, and by Edna Louise Jacobson, Assistant Editor. Clara M. Leiser and Lillian L. Krueger aided in putting the manuscript in shape for the press. The Draper Collection, owned by this Society is a complex of many collections including among others the Preston and Virginia Papers and the Kentucky Papers (the subjects of Cal¬ endar Series Volumes I and II), the George Rogers Clark Papers, the Daniel Boone Papers, etc. It is the earnest hope of the Society to publish in time descriptive calendars of all of the dis¬ tinct sub-collections; and the presentation in this volume of a calendar covering two highly interesting groups of manuscripts labelled “Tennessee” and “King’s Mountain” is an occasion of much satisfaction to the Society. The Tennessee Papers are preserved in seven folio volumes, marked (XX), the King’s Mountain Papers are in eighteen vol¬ umes (DD). The marginal press mark, indicating the series, volume, and page, and the figures following the description which define the length of the original document, will serve as guides to the users of the calendar in ordering photostatic or other re- 240868 productions. This Society is prepared to supply such aids to in¬ vestigators at the actual cost of the service. Doctor Kellogg’s unique qualifications for supervising work connected with the Draper Collections are too well known to scholars to require comment.
