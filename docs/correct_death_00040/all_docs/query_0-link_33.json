Lane\n\nObituary from Gate City Herald? – wife of Maldon Lane Sr\n\nMrs. Mary E. Lane, wife of M. A. Lane and daughter of E. P. and M. E. Quillen, was born July 28, 1877, and departed this life January 5, 1904, at 5 o’clock a. M. She professed faith in Christ at the age of 13 years and joined the M. E. Church, South, to which she lived a faithful member until her death. She was united in marriage to M. A. Lane June 26, 1898, and unto them were born two sweet children, a boy and girl. She loved her children as only a mother can. She knew she must soon be taken away from them. Her last Christian gift to her little son was a bible. She often talked of her departure and longed for that rest that awaits the children of God. On the morning before her death she called her husband to her side and said to him \"I must soon leave you, stay close by me, train up my little children right and take good care of them.\" She then told him to get his autograph album and with trembling hand she wrote these lines:\n\nMaldon, dear: --\n\nI must soon leave you.\n\nAnd stay with you no more;\n\nBut I hope we will meet in heaven,\n\nWhere sad parting comes no more.\n\nJust before she died she called her father, mother, husband, brothers and sisters to her and kissed them and asked God to bless and keep them. She then asked us to sing \"’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus\" and while we sang it seemed she was almost too happy to stay on earth. She then lay quiet for some time, her last words were: \"I feel go good.\" She then fell asleep in the arms of Jesus as calm and peaceful as a child in its mother’s arms.\n\nMary is not dead, but only sleeping\n\nAnd we all this sleep must take;\n\nWe’ll be ever living ready,\n\nEre the rolling billows break;\n\nFor we know not what’s before us,\n\nNor how dark the way may be;\n\nMay our lamps be trimmed and burning,\n\nWhen the summons comes for us.\n\nWhat a blessed hope, dear friends, she is only gone on before. Ah, how strange some things doth appear to us, but our kind Heavenly Father knoweth best. We cannot tell why she was taken away from her husband and little children, but we would say to them she is a bright light in Heaven’s window for you, then cheer up as you journey through life you can look toward the home of the soul and say, dear Mary, I will meet you there. Dear children, you can look toward Heaven and say, mama is there, I will be good and when I die I will go there too. Then father, mother, brothers and sisters, remember her dying words and by the grace of God we shall meet dear Mary on the other side of the river of death, where we shall never part any more and all our troubles will be over. To all her friends and relatives we would say, let us so live that when the journey of life is drawing to a close and the shade of evening fall about us and the sabeled curtains of night gather around us, we can say, like the good sister, \"I am ready to go, dear Lord, take me home\" and fall asleep in the arms of Jesus and be carried by the angels safe through the pearly gates into the city of God.\n\nJodie Holdway\n\nGate City Herald (?)\n\nSubmitted by Don Lane\n\nMary C.
