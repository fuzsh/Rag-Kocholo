This information is helpful in finding individual letters or documents in the online version. Additional letters received by the Library after 1963 are not listed in this index.\n\nA current finding aid (PDF and HTML) to the Andrew Johnson Papers is available online with links to the digital content on this site.\n\nBrief History of the Andrew Johnson Papers\n\nWhen the Civil War came to Greeneville, Tennessee, Andrew Johnson, the only pro-Union southern U.S. senator was elsewhere in the state stumping for Union men. In a state torn by conflicting loyalties and violence, Johnson was a target of Confederate sympathizers. Escaping more than one ambush, he eventually arrived in Washington, D.C., having left his invalid wife, one small son, and his treasured personal papers in Greeneville. Before the war, he and his wife had carefully gathered and organized his books and papers in one room of his office. Yet when the war was over little record of his early career had survived.\n\nAt various times during the Civil War troops of both armies used Johnson’s home and office as a hospital, barracks, officers’ residence, and shelter for camp followers. On February 14, 1864, Johnson’s son Robert wrote his father from Nashville that it was “rumored at Knoxville that the rebels had taken possession of all our Books, papers &c. at Greeneville. Mr. Joe Allen brought the information here. I hope it may prove incorrect . . . .” Such fears were well grounded, and most of Johnson’s papers were dispersed or destroyed by the end of the war.\n\nThe Johnson house remained neglected and in a state of disrepair during Johnson’s terms as vice president and president of the United States. As the end of his presidential term approached on March 4, 1869, Johnson and his family made plans to return to Greeneville. His secretary, Col. William Moore, listed boxes packed for shipping containing “private letters,” “miscellaneous papers,” “scrapbooks,” and other records. The Johnson entourage arrived in Greeneville on March 30, and the papers for the period of Johnson’s presidency were carefully put away.\n\nAfter several years of active participation in Tennessee politics and a brief term in the U.S. Senate in 1875, Johnson died in July of that year. Ultimately, his papers came into the possession of Martha Johnson Patterson, his elder daughter. Upon Martha Patterson’s death in 1901, the papers passed into the possession of her son, Andrew Johnson Patterson, who sold the collection to the Library of Congress in 1904. Subsequent gifts and purchases through 1985 expanded the collection to its present size.\n\nA fuller history of the provenance of the collection was prepared for the Index to the Andrew Johnson Papers, pp. v-viii, and was subsequently reproduced in the finding aid (PDF and HTML). A version appears on this website as the essay Provenance of the Andrew Johnson Papers.\n\nDescription of Series\n\nThe Andrew Johnson Papers are arranged in twenty-two series. A finding aid (PDF and HTML) to the collection is available online with links to the digital content on this site.\n\nSeries 1: General Correspondence, 1841-1891 (Reels 1-39)\n\nContains President Johnson’s personal non-official correspondence consisting primarily of letters received.

Some fair copies are not represented in the letterpress volumes, and arrangement does not consistently follow that of the letterpress volumes. Copies of most of the items in letterpress Volumes I and V are in fair copy Volume I, and letterpress Volumes III and IV are in fair copy Volume II, but fair copy volumes may include letters from three different letterpress volumes. Fair copy Volume III, pages 38-263, includes copies of communications between General George Gordon Meade and officers in his command, May 3-June 25, 1864. Volumes I and II include indexes and there is a separate bound volume index to Volume I.\n\nSeries 4: Indexes to Letters Received and Record Book, 1862-1869 (Reels 44-45)\n\nSubseries 4A, 1865-1869 (Reel 44)\n\nComposed of indexes of letters received by Andrew Johnson.
