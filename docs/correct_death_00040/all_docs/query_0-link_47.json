Taylor and Jacob Shannon in Montgomery County, Texas mentions the death of William M. Irwin's son Alexander.\n\nBy way of New Orleans\n\nTaylor's Creek, White County10th July 1844\n\nDear Son\n\nWe have received but three letters from you since you left us the 1st dated 28th February. 2nd, 5th June and 3 and last the 16th October 1843 all of which ware promply answered on the 6th March lasst. The answer to this was delayed to give you the result of the election for cashier of the B. Bank of Sparta. Succise it to say the last legislature was Whigs. They appointed a Whig directory and they beat A. L. Davis a few votes by the Jn Waren Ani_____ is on his farm near Sparta and has made a fine crop but will shortly move to Oakland.\n\nYou cannot imagine the grief and uneasiness manifested amoungst us on account of not having heard from you since the date of your letter of the 16th Oct. last and this uneasiness is greatly increased for the fact that at that time you were only recovering from _______ swire spell of Fever. There has been much sickness in this county of Fever and flux and many deaths. The fever was first brought from Missoured by a son of (Jacob or Isaac) Williams both him and his wife died from whence it took a range through the (Black Wamon or Worrion) killed several and some not recovered yet. The flux has as yet been mostly confined to falling water mine lick hills some 10 or 12 have died of it amoungst the number are Jack Davis' wife old man river and le FelksJames Davis had a violent attack but is mending slowly.There has been several Sickness in my family but have all recovered but myself. I have been confined now for three weeks tot he house and mostly to my bed but have been in lingering health since early last spring. I have a confirmed cough, a pain in my side at first which seems to present every arrearance of an inflamation of the lungs. These with several returning symptoms of the old complaint dispepsey. I also have a crippled shoulder occasional from a fall from my feet last fall. This gives me much pain of times. From the complicated disease am all most confirmed in the belief it is one form which I shall not recover my mind too is of times much disturbed and harrassed ocasioned from the insolence disobedience indolence ______eanoness _______ of some of my negro boys and I not the bodily strength to chastise them which they know and in consequence of which are growing worse. Our White family are and have constantly been in the enjoyment of good health (myself excepted) your sister Ann has been at your uncle Wm Gleesons since last fall the last we heard from her she was well she will now be at home in a few days our neighbour Thd. Irwin died of disease, dropesey peculial to old age. The Senate of the United States has rejected the Texas treaty and annexation of the country to our government by a vote of 35 to 15 or 16. Our leading men or some of them are distracted and totally blind to the true interest of the U States and Texas if they are not so in suspending the annexation I must confess I am myself and if so I am much inclined to the opinion a majority of the people are on the same side with me. There was none in Tennessee that I heard of oppesed to the annexation of Texas until H. Clay published his opinion against it he having long been the Whig candidate for next President, and still is since his opinion has been promalgated. The Whigs have ralied to the side of Clay preferring his election tot he good of the country many of them still say they are in favour of anexation can scarcely ever be expected at all events not while any respectable portion of the people of the U. States are opposed to it nor until the consent of Mexico be first had. This is Clays published opinion. Van byran too whom it was believed would have been the nominee of the democratic Baltimore Convention --- at for his opposition to the annexation of Texas his opinion on this improtant question prevented him from being the niminee for President ant the Convention of Baltimore almost unaminously nominated Col Polk of Tennessee as their Candidate for President and W. Dallis of Pensylvania for Vice President, both of whom are in favour of annexation. Polks nomination is hailed throughout the U. States with the most lively prospects of success should he be elected the immediate Annexation I presume is certain but should Clay be from his own declaration it can scarce ever be expected. McDuffee of South Carolina in the Sentate of the U. States has brought forward for consideration adn the action of the Senate another proposition in favour of Texas which is said to be gaining favour what its future are or how it may suceed I am at a loss to detail to you. We have had an unusual dry spring no rain after corn was planted until the 10 or 15 June since which time torrents of rain has fAllen almost every day which has allmost intirely distroyed wheat and Rye Crops in the fields before they could be got out. Oats is of little account in consequence of the drought in the first place and secondly form the great quantity of rain and wind which renders it impossible to save many of them and they are of but little account. Clover and hay are of all kind is nearly totally destryed by the wet. Corn Crops have suffered much for work so that its fare to conclude we shall have very tight crops it still continuing to rain all most every day which renders prospects verry gloomy for the next year, but it must be submitted to without a murmer, Neither of your sisters are yet married but if I am permitted to judge from appearances, there prospects can't be said to be gloomy or in any manner dispareing.\n\nEsq. Irwin received a letter some time since announcing the death of his son Alexander he died at or in the neighbuorhood of Nacogdoches in Texas came line 1 March last he was on his way to his Brother Lockharts. Since which he has received a letter lately from Lockhart from Nacogdoches. He had went htere to see after the affairs of Alexander in which letter Lockhart says he has heard nothing from you for three years this greatly serves to increase our uneasiness about you as your expressed in your last an intention of going to see him whenever your health became better so as to be able to do so. Lockhart is married, but I can't tell in what county or neighbourhood he lives not having seen the letter. My son it is all important that you act in all respects with great care and circumspection in order to insure your future well doing. Make but few contracts if any on line or credit and all such meet with promptness and punctuality and inforce this rule for others to you. I have contracted to pay debts much on credit so that credit has been of Verry little benefit if any to me. If you owe any body any thing give your note if any owes you take there note and be careful to settle withall you have dealings with each and every year. For frequent settlements make long friends it is said. I have always intended to have visited Texas one more and still intend it if provided I get my health again but if I do it must be soon for I find my strength and health fast on the decline that if I do not come to Texas soon I shall not have bodily strength to perform the Jurney I have a thought if I recover my health I will come this fall or winter and by way of the Mississippi and take with me their a few of my home horses to market for I have more of them then I wish to keep or can keep its much to be feared that Texas will have to pass through another revolution and soon too without some change favourable to your country takes place which at this time can scarcely be anticipated should this be the case I have no wish of being there in a state of war for I am to old to fight and have no wish of reviewing the calamities and the horrors and _________ fo war buth would much desire once more of seeing the country in a time of peace and viewing the march of sence civelation apriculture commercial and all the natural advandages coupled with the artificial improvements that have taken place in the country since I was there in the Spring of 1840. You will please present my best respects to W. Shannon and family I shall direct this letter to you and him and request him to answer it in case nay calamity or misfortune has befAllen you you will request him to give me the earliest information in case of your sickness or death Indeed if you are subject to annual fever and disease I should leave the country and return to my friends in the U. States where I could have some promise of better health and health and peace of mind is worth more than everything else Ia. H. and N.? Crower arenow both heare from Texas they have come for some acceptance from the old man. Ia. is married and Mo. Is is looking a wife heare but seems unsuccessful as yet. They are both much pleased with Texas and will return in the Fall. I am now much exhausted as though I have had to go to bed several times since I commenced writing. I have fill my paper and can add but little more, always bear it in mind that if you do not receive an answer from me to your letter in two or three months these dates you may conclude there is a miscarage of yours or mine one and and write again for there is nothing we so much desire as to heare from you frequently. You or Mr. Shannon I hope will write immediately. Your friends heare are all well your mother brothers sisters including Capt. Davis all join wiht me in presenting to you their affectionate love and esteem and we all inform it on you to wirte frequently.your affectionate father\n\nIsaac Taylor\n\nTo William Irwin Esqr\n\nWhite Cty\n\nSparta\n\nTenn\n\nNapolin Osana (?)
