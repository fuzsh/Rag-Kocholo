His occupations were listed as Pioneer, Colonizer, Merchant, Land Owner and Toll and Local Tax Collector.\n\nValentine \"The Immigrant\" (Xavier) Sevier was born on the 1st of February 1712/3, presumably in St. Giles Parish, England.[1][2] He was christened there on 10-15 February 1712/3.[1] He is the son of John Xavier and Mary Smith.[3]\n\nIn 1744, Valentine Sevier, Sr. married Joannah Goad, pronounced Good).[4] For most of their marriage, the couple lived in Augusta County, Virginia.\n\nValentine was a planter, and he owned a Tavern (Ordinary) and grist mill, as well as collecting the toll for milling corn and/or wheat. He ran an Inn which he built south west of his residence. Altogether he accumulated a great deal of property. In 1773, John convinced his parents to remove to the Settlements 300 miles southwest of the Shenandoah Valley. Two of their sons were already there, Valentine, Jr. and Robert. Joannah's last deed of record took place on 15 August 1773. She died sometime after this date. Valentine, his remaining children, and his eldest son John's family moved to the Island on the Holston arriving on either the 24th or 25th of December 1773. Valentine lived the rest of his life in seclusion until he remarried. A patriotic person, he took the oath of allegiance on the 27th of August 1778.\n\nValentine died on Friday, 30 December 1803 in Carter City, near the Watauga Settlement in Carter County, Tennessee.[5] It is possible that he was buried in the Green Hill Cemetery in Elizabethtown, Carter County, Tennessee on the 31st of December 1803.[6]\n\nValentine Sevier \"The Immigrant\" 1712-1803\n\nDeath & Legacy\n\nName: Valentine Sevier\n\nWill Written: 12 Mar 1799 Carter County, Tennessee[7]\n\nDeath Date:\n\nWill Proved: Carter County, Tennessee[8]\n\nExecutor(s): Obaraah [ink blotch] and Job Hendricks\n\nBequests:[9]\n\nMy soul to God who gave it\n\nMy body to be buried at the discretion of my Executors\n\nAfter the discharge of all my just debt, to my dear and loving wife Jemima Sevier a sufficient maintenance to be paid yearly by my Executors\n\nTo Jemima (young) I give one saddle and one feather bed\n\nAll the residue of my goods, land and tenements to be equally divided between my two sons Abraham & Joseph Sevier, Abraham Sevier to pay Catharine Matlock wife of William Matlock fifty pounds and Joseph to pay said Catharine forty pounds\n\nI also appoint Obaraah ? and Job Hendricks my sole Executors\n\nResidences\n\n1759: Frederick County, Virginia[10]\n\n1764: Frederick County, Virginia[10]\n\n1790: Tennessee[11]\n\n1796: Carter County, Tennessee[12]\n\n1797: Carter County, Tennessee[13]\n\n1798 : Carter County, Tennessee[14]\n\nCourt Records - Augusta County, VA\n\n18 May 1749\n\n\"We present Robert Scot for the breach of the Peace in beating Robert Breckenridge Under Sherif of this County this day in the Court Yard while the Court were Seting by Information David Drydon Andrew Lewis and Valentine Sevire.\" (Augusta Co., VA Court Order Bk. 2, p. 119).\n\n\"On the Complaint of Thomas Godfrey against his master Valentine Seveire for misusage. the parties being fully heard the Court are of Opinion that the sd Godrey has been Ill used but this being his first Complaint It is Ordered that he return to his sd master and that his sd master provide for him Sufficient Cloaths &c according to Law.\" (Augusta Co., VA Court Order Bk. 2, p. 119).\n\n\"On the Complaint of Mather Grymes against her master - Valentine Severe for misusage the parties being fully heard the Court are of the opinion that the s'd Grymes has been Unhumanly abused and not Sufficiently Cloathed but this being her first Complaint it is Ordered that she return to her master and yt. he provide for her sufficient Cloathes ec.

More research is needed.\n\nState Legislature (Tennessee), House of Representatives Report, Tuesday, November 8, 1803\n\nFraudulent land grants in NC in the names of: Valentine Sevier Jun., Valentine Sevier Sen., Joseph Sevier Sen., John Sevier Jun., John Goad Sen. (and others including William Clark), all dated September 16th, 1779, and all in the hand writing of John Sevier, . . . one hundred and five thousand, six hundred acres of land have been fraudulently obtained by John Sevier, from Landon Carter. (The Tennessee Gazette and Metro-District Advertiser (Nashville, TN), 30 Nov 1803, Wed · Page 1 <https://www.newspapers.com/image/586267075/?terms=Sevier&match=1>)\n\nMention of this land fraud on Wikipedia:\n\nDuring his first term as governor, Sevier developed a rivalry with rising politician Andrew Jackson. In 1796, Jackson campaigned for the position of major-general of the state militia but Sevier threw his support behind George Conway.[8]: 211 Jackson learned that Sevier had referred to him as a \"poor pitiful petty fogging lawyer\" in private correspondence.[8]: 213 In 1797, Jackson, then serving as a U.S. Senator, learned that fraud had taken place in the 1780s at what was then North Carolina's Nashville land office. He notified the governor of North Carolina. When the governor demanded the office's documents, Sevier blocked their transfer. Jackson concluded that Sevier was somehow involved in the scandal.[15]: 34 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sevier#cite_note-langsdon-15>\n\nChildren\n\nTheir children included:[citation needed]\n\nJohn, b. 23 Sep 1745 (first Governor of Tennessee).\n\nValentine.\n\nRobert Sevier.\n\nMary (Polly), m. Rutherford.\n\nCatherine, m. Matlock.\n\nAbraham Sevier.\n\nJoseph Sevier.

The Biography content should be reduced to facts that are reliably sourced, everthing else moved to the Research Notes. Alternate and disputed facts should be discussed in the Research Notes. The Sources should be scrubbed of their listings of facts, those moved to the Biography or Research Notes with citations. Secondary sources should be reviewed to determine what value they add to the profile where primary sources are cited. Several unreliable sources are listed and should be removed unless they cite reliable, primary, contemporaneous sources. The notes in Free-Space Page Research Notes need to be reviewed for incorporation or deletion. Spratlin-29 13:42, 21 May 2024 (UTC)\n\nVital Statistics\n\nName\n\nAn unsourced middle name of Smith was previously listed.\n\nBirth\n\nHis birth is listed in the data field and Biography as 1 February 1712/3 in St. Giles Parish, Cripplegate, London, England. This is based on the christening record cited (image also attached) which names his parents, the same persons attached to this profile as his parents. The image of the christening record obscures the christening date; it appears to be between 10-15 February 1712/3 based on the entries before and after.\n\nAlternate Births\n\nThe below alternate birth dates mostly lack primary, contemporaneous sources. Each should be sourced, analyzed, and evaluated against the christening record and other sources upon which his Birth is currently based. Spratlin-29 13:42, 21 May 2024 (UTC)\n\n1702 in London[15] [secondary source, primary source not cited]\n\nAt this year's Sevier Family Reunion, we were told that a family member traveled to London, England and found corroborating records that Valentine Sevier, Sr. \"the Immigrant\" was born 1 February 1702. no proof offered. (Which year? Told by who to whom?)[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1800s a man named Lyman Draper, interviewed the descendants of Revolutionary War soldiers. Gov/Gen John Sevier's son Col George Washington Sevier was interviewed, and he stated that he thought that Valentine was about 100 years old when he died in 1803 in Carter County Tennessee. He was wrong about the age. So people have just subtracted 100 from the date of death to arrive at the abt 1703 birth date.\n\n1712 based on the memorial in Tennessee.[4]\n\nThere is proof that he may have been born in 1712, as stated on this memorial erected in his honor (but that is made confusing by the in images in the Huguenot Church which shows the year of birth as 1702).[citation needed]\n\nPamela D Sevier has a copy of the original baptism record from the Guildhall Library.[citation needed]\n\nMarriages\n\nThe marriage date of Valentine and Joannah (Goad) Sevier (abt.1723-abt.1773) is estimated from the birth of their son John Sevier Sr. (1745-1815), (1745-1=\"about\" 1744).\n\nThe marrage date of Valentine and Jemima (Russell) Sevier (abt.1724-abt.1799), \"about\" 1782\", is unsourced.\n\nDisputed 2nd Marriage\n\nThere is some dispute as to the maiden or married name of the woman he remarried. Her name was Jemima, but some believe it to be Young, while still others suggest that she was Jemima Douglas widow, maiden name, Russell, the mother-in-law of his son, Val, Jr..\n\nNote: The name 'Jemima Young' came from the Last Will & Testament\n\nAdded Note: by April L. Payne It should also be noted she was NOT listed as his wife. Speculation has it, she was either a daughter of his new wife, or a granddaughter.\n\nFather's Origin\n\nValentine's father was a Huguenot who had fled from France to London as his Protestant views were at odds with the state religion. He was the first to assume the English form \"Sevier,\" although he was perhaps the fourth or fifth Valentine in that direct line.[3]\n\nUnsourced Residence\n\nValentine Sevier II and Joanna Goad Sevier settled in Culpepper Co., Va, moving later to Rockingham County, Va, where John Sevier, their eldest child, was born September 23, 1745. Valentine Sevier arrived in Watauga Settlement, December 25, 1773 accompanied by 5 sons and 3 daughters to join his son Valentine lll. Immigrated to United States about 1740 in Orange County, Virginia. He took the oath of allegiance on August 27, 1778.(No source linked, from Ancestry)\n\nReview Sourced Residence\n\nResidence: Shenandoah Valley, VA (no year listed)[2]\n\nFree-Space Page Research Notes\n\nAdditional Research Notes contained in a large block of hidden text in this profile were moved to the free-space page Valentine Sevier Sr. Research Notes on 15 November 2022, and need to be reviewed for incorporation or deletion.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 London Metropolitan Archives; London, England; Church of England Parish Registers, 1538-1812, Baptism record of Valentine Sevier, 1712; Reference Number: P69/GIS/A/002/MS06419/014; #S817452267.
