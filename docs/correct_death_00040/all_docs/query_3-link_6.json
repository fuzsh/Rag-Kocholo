        "text": "Get Oriented - the Visitor Center\n\nAt the Visitor Center, park staff or volunteers will greet you and provide an overview of what is available for you to do. Depending on your time or interests, you can:\n\nView the orientation film, \"Andrew Johnson: Defender of the Constitution,\"\n\nSee original artifacts pertaining to Johnson's presidency, impeachment, and national & international policy,\n\nVote for Andrew Johnson's acquittal or guilt at the impeachment display, and\n\nStand before Andrew Johnson's iconic Tailor Shop & listen for sounds of the tailoring trade emanating from it.\n\nThe Visitor Center is where you learn about the current status of Homestead tours and receive directions to the National Cemetery. You can also learn more about the 17th President & his times and find mementoes of your visit at the site's Eastern National bookstore.\n\nExplore How it all Began - the Early Home\n\nAndrew Johnson's Early Home in Greeneville sits adjacent to the site parking lot and could be your first stop en route to the Visitor Center. It is an appropriate beginning place - this is where Andrew and Eliza started their own family and Johnson experienced his first successes in local and national politics. This is also where he lived when he purchased his first enslaved people.\n\nThree downstairs rooms are available to tour. This house contains exhibits that explore Andrew Johnson's life prior to becoming President. Learn about his apprenticeship to a tailor in Raleigh, NC, his journeys throughout a young America before settling in East Tennessee, and his start in the business world & political sphere.\n\nFeel a Sense of Place - The Homestead\n\nThe historic Andrew Johnson Homestead, located at 209 South Main Street, is currently open for guided tours at 10:00 & 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 & 3:00 p.m. within park operating hours. For visitor safety, the number of people inside the Homestead is limited to 10.\n\nPlease Note: On days with limited staffing, Homestead tours may be offered at 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., with the Visitor Center temporarily closed during tour times.\n\nThere is no admission charge, but tickets are required and available at the Visitor Center on a first come/first served basis. Tickets are available until 15 minutes prior to tour time, as the Homestead is 2 1/2 blocks away. Tours begin on the back porch of the Homestead, and visitors may either walk or drive to the house from the Visitor Center. Parking is available.\n\nWhen you enter into the Johnson family home, you will see it much as it was when the family returned home from Washington. The house was inhabited by three generations of the Johnson family after the president's death, and they took care to preserve everything associated with the 17th President. Today it is a treasure trove of original family belongings.\n\nPay Homage - The Andrew Johnson National Cemetery\n\nThe National Cemetery is the final resting place for Andrew Johnson and his family, as well as for the nation's veterans. The high hill containing over 2000 graves provides a stunning view of the mountains.\n\nFeel free to walk the hilly sidewalks and stairs through the cemetery. The main gates are open daily. Pets are allowed on sidewalks on a leash."
