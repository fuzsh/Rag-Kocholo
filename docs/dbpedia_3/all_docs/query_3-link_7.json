        "text": "A Decade Of Success – Sal’s NBL 2010 to 2019\n\nWith the sun about to rise on a new decade, let's take a look back on a 10-year stretch that was largely dominated by two teams, while a plethora of stars delivered lots of highlights.\n\nOver the last 10 years the Wellington Saints rose to even higher prominence, claiming six titles, while the Southland Sharks (3) and Auckland Pirates (1) shared the other four.\n\nWhen it comes to awards, names to feature prominently include Lindsay Tait, Corey Webster and Alex Pledger, while in 2011 it's hard to miss Steven Adams (Rookie of the Year) and Dean Vickerman (Coach of the Year).\n\nPaul Henare is another to figure across multiple years, claiming Coach of the Year no less than three times.\n\nAnother name to stand out is Torrey Craig, who played for the Saints in 2015 before going on and carving out a continuing career with the Denver Nuggets in the NBA.\n\nWhile the Saints have claimed their fair share of titles, they have also had the largest number of players featuring in the annual All-Star Five;\n\nWellington Saints (13), Nelson Giants (7), Southland Sharks (6), Hawke's Bay Hawks (5), Canterbury Rams (5), Waikato Pistons (4), Manawatu Jets (3), Otago Nuggets (2), Taranaki Mountainairs (2), Supercity Rangers (2), Auckland Pirates (1).\n\nLet's see how good your memory is.\n\n2010 NBL CHAMPIONS: WELLINGTON SAINTS\n\nThe 2010 season was the 29th running of the NBL. Several team changes took place - the Otago Nuggets re-entered the competition following their one year absence, the Southland Sharks entered the league for the first time and the Auckland Stars dropped out. The Wellington Saints secured their sixth title, defeating Waikato in the best-of-three finals series. This also denied the Pistons the opportunity to claim a rare three-peat after their titles in '08 and '09.\n\nTeams:\n\n10 teams contested the 2010 season (final standings): Wellngton Saints, Waikato Pistons, Nelson Giants, Hawke's Bay Hawks, Harbour Heat, Southland Sharks, Christchurch Cougars, Taranaki Mountainairs, Manawatu Jets and Otago Nuggets.\n\nGrand Final (Best Of Three Series):\n\nGame One: Waikato Pistons (80) defeated Wellington Saints (74) (Referees: Tim Brown, Dallas Pickering & Gavin Whiu)\n\nGame Two: Wellington Saints (98) defeated Waikato Pistons (69) (Referees: Dallas Pickering, Tim Brown & Andy Thackray)\n\nGame Two: Wellington Saints (82) defeated Waikato Pistons (79) (Referees: Dallas Pickering, Tim Brown & Andy Thackray)\n\nSeason Award Winners:\n\nRegular Season Winners: Wellington Saints (14-4)\n\nMost Valuable Player: Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nNZ Most Valuable Player: Thomas Abercrombie (Waikato Pistons)\n\nFinals MVP: Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nMost Outstanding Guard (Keith Carr Trophy): Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nMost Outstanding NZ Guard (John Macdonald Trophy): Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nMost Outstanding Forward (Commissioners Cup): Thomas Abercrombie (Waikato Pistons)\n\nMost Outstanding NZ Forward/Centre (Stan Hill Trophy): Thomas Abercrombie (Waikato Pistons)\n\nScoring Champion (Alan Bland Memorial Trophy): Eric Devendorf (25.6) (Wellington Saints)\n\nRebounding Champion (Garry Pettis Memorial Trophy): Alex Pledger (12.6) (Waikato Pistons)\n\nAssist Champion (Dave Taylor Trophy): Lindsay Tait (7.1) (Wellington Saints)\n\nBest Team Free Throws (Nial Forsyth Trophy): Manawatu Jets (74.2%)\n\nRookie of the Year: Martin Iti (Southland Sharks)\n\nCoach of the Year: Pero Cameron (Wellington Saints)\n\nReferee of the Year: Dallas Pickering (Auckland)\n\nAdministrator of the Year: James King (Nelson Giants)\n\nMedia Award: Brendan Egan (Southland Times)\n\nAll-Star Five:\n\nG: Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nG: Eric Devendorf (Wellington Saints)\n\nF: Rene Rougeau (Southland Sharks)\n\nF: Thomas Abercrombie (Waikato Pistons)\n\nC: Mika Vukona (Nelson Giants)\n\n2011 NBL CHAMPIONS: WELLINGTON SAINTS\n\nNine teams contested the 2011 NBL season, the 30th running of the league. A new franchise, the Auckland Pirates, entered the league for the first time. The Christchurch Cougars were an unfortunate withdrawal due to the effects of the 2011 Canterbury earthquake. Led by Lindsay Tait, the Wellington Saints backed up their 2010 title, defeating the Hawke's Bay Hawks in the Grand Final to claim their seventh championship. 2011 will also be remembered for being Steven Adams one and only season in the NBL, which saw him collect the Rookie of the Year award and a championship with the Saints.\n\nTeams:\n\n9 teams contested the 2011 season (final standings): Wellington Saints, Hawke's Bay Hawks, Waikato Pistons, Nelson Giants, Manawatu Jets, Southland Sharks, Auckland Pirates, Taranaki Mountainairs and Otago Nuggets.\n\nGrand Final:\n\nWellington Saints (106) defeated Hawke's Bay Hawks (97) (Referees: Tim Brown, Dallas Pickering & Raewyn Willocks)\n\nSeason Award Winners:\n\nRegular Season Winners: Wellington Saints (13-3)\n\nMost Valuable Player: Alex Pledger (Waikato Pistons)\n\nNZ Most Valuable Player: Alex Pledger (Waikato Pistons)\n\nFinals MVP: Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nMost Outstanding Guard (Keith Carr Trophy): Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nMost Outstanding NZ Guard (John Macdonald Trophy): Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nMost Outstanding Forward (Commissioners Cup): Alex Pledger (Waikato Pistons)\n\nMost Outstanding NZ Forward/Centre (Stan Hill Trophy): Alex Pledger (Waikato Pistons)\n\nScoring Champion (Alan Bland Memorial Trophy): Jack Leasure (22.9) (Taranaki Mountainairs)\n\nRebounding Champion (Garry Pettis Memorial Trophy): Nick Horvath (11.7) (Manawatu Jets)\n\nAssist Champion (Dave Taylor Trophy): Jason Crowe (7.2) (Waikato Pistons)\n\nBest Team Free Throws (Nial Forsyth Trophy): Otago Nuggets (72.6%)\n\nRookie of the Year: Steven Adams (Wellington Saints)\n\nCoach of the Year: Dean Vickerman (Waikato Pistons)\n\nReferee of the Year: Tim Brown (Auckland)\n\nAdministrator of the Year: Jill Bolger (Southland Sharks)\n\nMedia Award: Daniel McHardy (Radio Sport)\n\nAll-Star Five:\n\nG: Lindsay Tait (Wellington Saints)\n\nG: Jason Crowe (Waikato Pistons)\n\nF: Thomas Abercrombie (Waikato Pistons)\n\nF: Mika Vukona (Nelson Giants)\n\nC: Alex Pledger (Waikato Pistons)\n\n2012 NBL CHAMPIONS: AUCKLAND PIRATES\n\nNine teams contested the 2012 NBL season - the Harbour Heat reentered the competition whilst the Waikato Pistons dropped out. Despite a great year from the Minor Premier Hawkes's Bay Hawks, they were unable to secure a spot in the final dance, eliminated in the semifinals by the Wellington Saints. In only their second year in the competition, the Auckland Pirates claimed their first NBL championship, defeating the Saints in a closely fought Grand Final. The 2012 season will also be remembered fondly for the standout performances of Manawatu Jets big man Nick Horvath.

The Waikato Pistons and Super City Rangers reentered the league with the Auckland Pirates and Harbour Heat both dropping out. Despite finishing fourth, the Southland Sharks claimed their maiden title, upsetting title favourite and minor premiers Wellington in the semifinals, before defeating the Nelson Giants in the decider.
