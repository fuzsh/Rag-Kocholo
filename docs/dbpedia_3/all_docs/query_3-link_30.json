        "text": "The Hawke's Bay Hawks are now being led by one of their very own players for the rest of the season. Basketball high-flyer Paora Winitana has been handed the mantle of head coach of the team.\n\nPaora Winitana says, “To coach our Hawke's Bay Hawks team, a team that's part of my family pretty much I love the province, I love the club so it's a huge honour.”\n\nNot only does Winitana coach the team, he also plays alongside the team and is one of the fittest and most skilled players.\n\nThe team has only secured one NBL title in 2006 and this season hasn't turned out quite how they would've liked, currently sitting near the bottom of the NZ NBL ladder.\n\nFormer head coach Liam Flynn was dismissed recently after \"not being the right fit\" for the club.\n\nBut for Winitana, he's just taking it one game at a time as they look to make the most of their season."
