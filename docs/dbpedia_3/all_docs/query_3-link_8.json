        "text": "Shooting / Point. Not sure about him being a Grabau type either???\n\nHe is a tough nut, and does have pleanty of ability but i think Brad Hill is more of a 3 man than what Winitana is.\n\nWith the line up that has been selected i can also see the sixers having to run very similar stuff to last year, in the way of a motion offence. Not sure if this will be a good thing or bad.\n\nFor me i would love to see more structure and stuff to get our better players open. Hope this is what evolves because the coaching staff have done a good job to put a good squad together.\n\nWould have preferred a player who was available for Sunday games, although we may not have too many so it might not be an issue.\n\nLove the fact that as an ordained Mormon Bishop, he leads the Tall Blacks Haka !\n\nWhy can't he play on Sundays? I think it is a good signing. As Ninnis said he is a bit of a diamond find. This guy has impressed me with limited minutes and at times he has looked better then vikona and is a much smarter player. I think his main negative is that he lacks in confidence at times, so hopefully Ninnis can instill confidence in him and we will see him at his best.\n\nAs dont know too much about Paora but was really hoping to gain a scoring Fwd. From plyrs currently have our scoring potential is a little suspect with Schenscher a unknown in scoring good points and Holmes not a big scorer . If brett can stay fit he will add to Ballinger and other import and a possibly\n\nBrad Hill Holmes and Schenser\n\nGood news for lovers of John Casey-isms: Paora is a former NZNBL Rookie of the Year.\n\nI hereby start the 'Bring Back The Dench' campaign so we can hear Casey say something along the lines of: 'one former Rookie of the Year to another, and Dench/Winitana finishes in style!'\n\n36ERS appear to be lucky with the schedule. No Home games on a Sunday and only 3 away games on Sundays - 12 Oct - Bullets, 16 Nov - Blaze, 4 Jan - Slingers.\n\nBeing unavailable for only 3 games during the regular season shouldn't hurt the team too much?\n\nSkip, I thought I read on here that Dench had been resigned?\n\nIMO - I think it is a good signing (Winitana) as in the limited minutes I have seen him play he hustles his butt off, his smart with his ball use and is a very solid defender. I remember that game against us here last here where played extended minutes in the 2nd qtr and he was the catalyst for pushing them wlel out in front with some steals, string D and some big threes.\n\nWill definitely provide solid backup at the 2/3 spot to Maher and Hill.\n\nCavalo - As far as I know, the team so far is Luke Schenscher, Brad Davidson, David Cooper, Brett Maher, Adam Ballinger, Jacob Holmes. Brad Hill, Ryan Kersten & Paora Winitana\n\nOnly one spot left in the 10 which will be an Import.\n\nI've not heard anywhere that Dench is back on board.\n\nInteresting signing.\n\nHe is a 4pt player so seems like they could have got a better(bigger name) player if they do in fact have 19pts left for 2 spots.\n\nHe is also 32 years old so maybe they wanted some experience in case Kersten and Hill aren't ready for regular minutes this season.\n\nSounds like he will be a strong defender to throw at high scoring SG/SF.\n\nSeems like we are a bit guard heavy would have preferred a backup PF.\n\nUnless they are going to use the second import at SF. Then use Holmes as a backup PF/SF for 30min off the bench.\n\nI like this signing, it looks like the sixers have gone after some players that can play multiple positions. Even if holmes starts at SF he will be spending time at PF this year. If we get hodge he can play 4 different postions, Ballinger 3 different positions and Winitana 3 different positions. It also gives us some size at SG along with Hill.\n\nIssac, DICKO or someone else in the know ...\n\nHow will this affect the sixers lineup? ie. If Paora is to play SG/SF will the sixers still look at signing a backup PF (I believe they still have 5 pts spare) and making kersten a Dev. player?\n\nAlso, what does the future hold for erik burdon? I was really impressed with him last season and i know he's been rippin up the ABL, what are his chances of being retained as a Dev. player?\n\nThanks!\n\nYea i was thinking the same thing, are the 36ers thinking of unning and 11 or 12 man squad and signing say Dodman and/or Burdon also and picking there best 10 for each game??? They could probably get both Dodman and Burdon in for 5 points, (im sure they could get one of them re rated down 1 if they really needed to) if not definatly 1 more would fit.\n\nAdding say dodman would also give them the back up power forward they seem to need.\n\nC Schenscher/Cooper\n\nPF Ballinger/Dodman\n\nSF Holmes, Winitana/Hill\n\nSG Hodge/Maher/Burdon\n\nPG Davidson/Kersten\n\nThat would be a good group of 12 players looks quite well balanced to me also.\n\nHey.\n\nmy coach is dean whitford!!! he played for south sa...\n\nhe never has played in front of us.. but did he play at the olypics??? he is a gr8 coach 2..\n\nSORRY this has nothing to do with drafts...\n\n:)Plz tell me!!!\n\nConsidering the height range of the talls the sixers have; they have C and PF covered. If you get a 6.6 off guard/forward; then you have more rotation for the 2-3 spots when you need to rotate the 4-5 spots.\n\nIt's quite a good setup, in this day and age you don't really want to have an entire team of \"single role\" players. You want people who can rotate position. Ballinger for instance, definately THE best PF I've seen in the NBL; but has good height and well rounded defense and could easily play C if needed; considering his footwork, I'd consider him to rotate to SF if need be during certain plays.\n\nWell we still need an import....if there is no hodge for us...which is likely...how about a Donta Smith currently in bulgaria or Tamar slay also in europe...they are players that could help us...Donta is a talented player in the same vein as hodge.\n\njust thought i would throw it out there...not much to do with paora, but u get that"
