        "text": "The NZ Breakers have signed Tall Blacks Phill Jones and Paora Winitana to their roster, on two and one year deals respectively.\n\nJones has recently plied his trade in Europe, and Winitana is coming off a strong season in the NZ NBL with the runner-up Hawks.\n\nJones last played with the Breakers in 2004, averaging 14 PPG.\n\nThe signings pretty much confirm that Ryan Kersten and Brent Charleton have been pushed outside of a ten man roster, and leave NZ with just two imports to sign.\n\nImport/Henare/Kersten\n\nPenney/Jones/Charleton\n\nForman/Winitana\n\nRonaldson/Vukona\n\nImport/Behrendorff\n\nThey were beaten to Abney's signature by a monstrous offer from Cairns and are rumoured to be interested in EJ Rowland.\n\nNeed a strong rebounder with that PF/C import I think."
