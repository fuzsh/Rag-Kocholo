EVANS of the First Council of Seventy CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS ICi< h.n<l I.. I\\;iiis Richard i.. Evans was born March 23, 1906, at Sail Lake City, I tab. He was ordained a seventy August 5, 1938, by Rulon S. Wells and set apart as one of the first seven presidents October 13, 1938, at the age « t 32. Brother Evans was in every particular worthy to fill the vacancy among the General Authorities occasioned by the death of Elder J. Golden Kimball. In natural endowment, education, spiritual compre- hension, and integrity, he will rise to the best traditions of tin- Council which he enters, lie is an intelligent, sturd) and fearless defender of the Gospel. Best of all, he is a sincere, consistent, and active Latter- day Saint with a firm testimony of the truth of tin- Gospel the first requisite t\\>r acceptable service in the Church <>i Christ. From earliest childhood. Richard learned the less.m of work. Delivering papers, selling Sowers, service at a soda fountain, driving trucks, travelling as a salesman for wearing apparel, and surveying with a railroad were among the tasks that drilled the hoy in habits of industry and thrift. A keen business sense was developed, reflected later in his outstanding hiisiness activities at KSL and with The Im- provement Era, and in his affiliation with the Rotary and Advertising (luhs. I lr always heeded his mother's counsel; one-tenth of his earn- ings has been given to the Lord, from his first-earned dime to his present income. Strength comes to those who command their natural love for temporal pos essions, and acknowledge, through obedience to the principle of tithing, that all good gifts come from the Lord. lie received an excellent education, graduating from the University of Utah with the degree of A.B. (major in English) and M.A. (major in Economics). Wide reading, extensive travel, and association with worth-while people, have extended his educational horizon. From his earliest boyhood Richard Evans was taught the Gospel. lie was active in all the church organisations and gained experience in Church procedure. He went on a mission to Great Britain in the fall of 1926 and served until the fall of L929. The life of Richard L. Evans is an example to the youth of /ion. Industry, integrity, honesty, devotion to truth, willingness to sacrifice — these and other virtues mark men of real distinction. It is from among such men that the Church must ever draw its leaders.

Probably the events of the past year haven't been so pronounced in -rope of worldly affairs as some of the previous ones, but to individual peoples, states, and countries each year completed has given new hope and /.est for life. The desire to branch out and aspire to greater heights is ever present somewhere on the earth. Therefore as we look back, some with joyous recollections, some with misgivings and regret, we bid farewell to a year that has provided a degree of comparative peace to most of the world. \\- 1948 dawn- many of us form new resolutions, those little reforms that people find so easy not to keep, and we promise ourselves that within the next 12 months we will reach out to accomplish the things we have always hoped for. Then comes the question, how shall I live? How mall I make the most of my life and pnt it to the best use? How -hall [ become a man and do a man's work? This, and not politics or trade or war or pleasure, is the questioi . The primary consideration is not how shall one get a living, but how shall he live; for if he lives rightly whatever is needful he shall easily find. Let's not lose sight of the resolution- that we have made. Do not \"bite off more than von can chew.\" Most people are content to spend their lives carrying out the purposes of others. They work only for the pay. They care more for the pay than they do the purpose. Give them the pay and you can have the purpose, tor all they care. In this way millions of unhappy lives are -pent. If you lack a purpose, why not look the matter squarely in the face. Why not have a purpose of your own? You can -till serve another*- purpose — can serve it even better; you can -till have the pay and yet be working out your own Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE * purpose. Why not resolve to have a purpose of your own for this new year? Why not arrange affairs toward that end and then work? If you were to ask a busy man how he gets so much done, he would tell you he puts first things first and that when he starts a job he finishes it ; then goes on to the next one. Some people start well enough, they are all aglow and they pitch in with a vim. But the trouble is that they do not keep on ; every little thing that comes along takes their minds off their work. They tire of the job at hand ; then they begin another one, only to -tire of it also. Unless you form the habit of going through with a piece of work, you won't get far. As you do your work day after day keep in mind the fact that your teacher has been over the road before you. He or she knows the hard spots and how to get over or around them. It may be that sometimes, in your zeal to get ahead, you may think you are being held back. That is not the case at all. What you no doubt need is more practice on some detail which you have not yet mastered. You may not be able to see, as you go along, the reason for each step that is taken ; but rest assured that there is a reason. This is the time for an inventory, let us look within our- selves and look to our \"stock in trade,\" that is the know how, knowledge, and wisdom we have gained. The opportunity is ever present for improvement and in whatever maimer we improve, our \"stock in trade\" has been increased. Gain knowledge ! Knowledge cannot be stolen from you ; it cannot be bought or sold ; you may be poor, and the sheriff may come into your house and sell your furniture at auction, or drive away your cow or take your lamb and leave you homeless and penniless ; but he cannot lay the hand of the law upon the jewelry of your mind. In this new year resolve to learn more and abide by what has been learned. Keep the \"Golden Rule,\" gain knowledge and wisdom and then apply that which has been acquired for the advancement of ourselves and others. — M.S.W. 1 1 k \\Ri;ixi: & President's Page A GO( >l) YE \\R, I )\\< A B \\D ( >\\l What has the year 1(,47 done for you? Has it given you opportunities for advance- ment and progression? Mas it placed you in a position where you arc better able to enjoy life? Has it given you a greater apprecia- tion for life and more joy in living? Has it brought to you new friends and helped you better to appreciate those you have already had? Has it brought to yon a better under- standing of the purpose of life and given von more ability to fulfill that purpose? Has it given yon a greater opportunity to serve God and your fellow men? If it has you would say it has been a wonderful year, and if it hasn't it is termed bad, or poor. What usually makes years good or had, anyhow? I> it the year itself or is it what we do during the year : how well we take advantage of the opportunities that come along and how much we try to create opportunities that will develop into something worthwhile? The pioneers of 1847 had what they called a good year. True all of them suffered and many of them died, but through their labours and their sorrows, their tireless efforts in spite of obstacles and priva- tions, they crossed the barren wastes and established themselves in the place that God had shown in vision to his prophets a- a gathering place for His people. They were still true arid firm in the faith and thanked God for their accomplishments. It had been a good year. When our early missionaries travelled through all kinds of country here in the early days, struggled to learn the Maori language, slept in the bnsh, rite most anything they could get, were tied Up and whipped, but because of their faith and effort wire able to preach the gospel to the Maori people in their own language and convert many of them. Thev had experienced a good year. When some good doctor ha- travelled through rain and mud many miles over trails or bad roads and through his efforts has saved a human life the day is better to him than had he remained in the comforts of a good office where his income may have been many times as great. After fighting bitter opposition and braving the uncertainty of unknown seas and the discouraging and sometimes rebellions attitude of a doubting crew, Christopher Columbus sighted the shores of America, the unknown world. What he accomplished made it a great Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE 5 year for him while those who had opposed and ridiculed him were probably complaining of the monotony of life. A mother experiences months of discomfort and worry, suffers intense pain and even nears death's door, but thanks God for the privilege of bringing into the world another human being. She has had a good year. An author or a composer may spend a tedious twelve months poring over his work but if in the end he has created something beautiful or worthwhile has had a good year. Likewise with the scientist, the inventor and the explorer. Their success comes only through years of tiring and exacting work which discourages those of less faith, less determination or less ambition. They make their own good years. That person, who through determination and faithful effort has overcome a weakness or discarded a bad habit feels the joy of a good year. The individual who draws nearer to God and experiences the joy of righteous service in His cause has earned for himself a good year. Has the year 1947 been a good year for you? What kind of a year are you going to make of 1948? £,•11 Illlllllllllllllllllllllll I MIIIIUnilllllllllllltllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllUllllllillllllllllllllllllllllllllllMIIIIMIIMIUIMIIIIIIIIIMHIIIIIIIIIHIIItllll'j | NGA HUI PARIHA O TE TAU HOU I WAIRAU DISTRICT at MADSEN | January 3, 4, 1948. f S WAIKATO DISTRICT at TAUMARUNUI | January 24, 25, 1948. § j WAIRARAPA DISTRICT at PAPAWAI January 31, February 1, 1948. § !

VVe sorrow with those who have lost loved ones, or who have had troubles of any kind to burden their lives; hut we are grateful for the love and knowledge we have of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which helps us to rise above all trials with new determinations. In unity there is strength, and I personally am thankful for our hand of women in this Mission who are now facing the New Year with faith, courage, and love in their hearts. We have work hefore us and we will succeed. As teachers and mothers, we have a great responsibility. Let us hold fast to the ideals which will aid US most in shouldering this responsibility. In I Nephi 8th chapter, we read of Lehi and his dream. \"And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the hank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.\" As we read on, we find that the iron rod was the word of God which led to the foun- tain of living waters, or to the tree of life which was a representation of the love of God. \"Behold, he saw others pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree.\" Of those who did not hold fast, many were drowned and many were lost from view, wandering in strange roads. We must cling fast to the rod of iron and ever he humble, praying continually for strength, courage, and help in promoting peace in our home-. churches and social circle-. All during Jesus' life He seemed to feel that there was no limit to what He could do, if only those who beseeched Him believed enough. He gave us a pattern to follow, and if all people would cling to those teachings, life would he one of complete joy and happi- ness. Let us say with Joshua of old — \"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\" May the coming year bring greater love, kindness, and under- standing in our homes and in our hearts toward all mankind. May Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE we always live that nothing will stand between us and the blessings God has in store for us. So long as there are homes to which men turn At close of day, So long as there are homes where children are — Where women stay, If love and loyalty and faith be found Across these sills, A stricken nation can recover from Its gravest ills. So long as there are homes where fires burn And there is bread, So long as there are homes where lamps are lit And prayers are said ; Although a people falters through the dark And nations grope, With God behind these little homes We still can hope. SIX NEW ELDERS FROM ZION ARRIVE Arriving on the Hawaiian Citizen on November 22, 1947, were six new missionaries from Zion to take up their labours in New Zealand. Elder John Herbert Lake of Inglewood, California, and Elder Joseph Wilburt Stelter of Murray, Utah, have been assigned to the Waikato District. Assigned to the Auckland District were Elders Duane M. Dur- rant of American Fork, Utah, and Ray K Andrus Jr. of Ucon, Idaho. To the Taranaki District goes Elder Vernon John Walker of Pocatello, Idaho. Elder William Elwin Stebbing of Baltimore, Mary- land, begins his labours in the Otago district. i I 'I 8 TE K VRERE EUouerc, LMfi Richard L. Evans < IF THE FIRST C< IUNCIL ( IF THE SEVENTY Address delivered at the Saturday afternoon session of the tlfth annual general conference April 5, 1947, iii the Tabernacle. You are a glorious audience to look upon, and if the Church represented nothing more than what we see before us here from this pulpit, it would be an inestimable power for good in the earth. But to look at you and to realize that you represent only a fraction ol one per cent, of the total membership of the Church i> a glorious thought t<> c< ntemplate. I suppose we all like to hear success Stories, and the centennial is a success story. The statistical report of the Church, read It n teniae morning by President Clark and by Brother Joseph Anders, in. is a success story of the cumulative accomplishment of the past hun- dred years. The Lord expected much of those -ix people who officially organ- ised the Church in 1830. and 1 feel sure He was not disappointed. He expected much of the twenty thousand who made up the popula- tion of Xauvoo and vicinity about a hundred years ago, and. while some faltered, their total achievement was glorious. 1 hesitate to think how much more Me expects of us today as we stand at the beginning of the second century in this valley. The past has little meaning except in terms .if the future. What is only past is a dead thing, hut what of the past may he builded upon i- something else, and 1 look at the centennial not only as an occasion for looking forward, and again, I hesitate almost to think of what would he expected of about a million people with all of the advantages we have in comparison with the accomplishments of those who have gone before with what they had. Surely it may he said that in no century of the history of the world has greater change taken place than in the past century, which we now celehrate as our centennial, and T should like to indicate, by citing a few facts and figures, some of the accomplishments, and some of the things that face us squarely as a challenge for the century to come. For one thing, the total population of the world has more than doubled in the past century which we now commemorate. There are Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE 9 more than two billion people on the face of the earth today. It is estimated by statisticians of population that this will double, or more than double, again, being permitted to do so, in the next century, which would mean something between four and five billion people. To an organisation that has the obligation to preach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, this is something to consider. Some time before the war, there was an estimated net gain of about thirty million people being added to the population of the world annually. About one hundred fifty thousand new faces were appear- ing in this world each day. About a hundred thousand were dying- each day. These figures are also something to contemplate by a Church that has the obligation of carrying the message to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. What does a hundred fifty thousand new faces each day mean in term of missionary work, and what does the great number of those who depart mean in terms of temple work? Some years ago I took an annual report of the British Mission, when there was a rather strong corps of missionaries active there, and paralleled figured with some of the vital statistics from Great Britain, and discovered that in the oldest and perhaps best estab- lished European mission in the Church, at that time at least, there was about one person born in Great Britain every year to every tract we were distributing ; but there were about four born in Great Britain every year to every door answered to our missionaries ; about ten born every year to every gospel conversation ; and about sixty born every year to every family visited. Multiply this result by the total figures for the world, and we have some more facts to take into con- sideration in terms of our own obligations. The Book of Mormon has been translated into about twenty- four languages, and printed, I think in eighteen. But the French Academy recognises about two thousand seven hundred ninety-six distinct lan- guages on the face of the earth. You can see what the Lord started when He took a hand in the confusion of tongues at Babel after the flood, and it is marvellous to contemplate how magnificently men co- operate when confusion is called for — two thousand seven hundred ninety-six languages ! The World Almanac recognises forty-five major languages in use today. These are other facts for us to consider. Now T submit to you that the Lord dot's nol deal in statistical impossibilities, and when He places upon any people the obligation of preaching the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people it is an assignment to be taken seriously and not something beyond possible reach. I have made the statement often that if every person in the Church did his job as a missionary as well as Wilford Woodruff once did, this would be accomplished now. M TE KARERE Hanuere, 1948 Hut in addition to such service then- arc main toots that have hem given to us which multiply tin- power of men's efforts and which I am sure the Lord expects us to make good use of even as tools are being made use of in all the other pursuits of life for man'- enrich- ment and comfort and for tin- material advancement of the world. A man with his bare hands doesn't have much to work with in this world, hut a man with a tool or with a machine, which is a tool multi- plied in power and complexity and function, ma\\ do the work of five or ten or a thousand or more men. I am sure that our Father in heaven expects us to use all avail- able resources intelligently and to multiply our personal efforts by every modern facility that is available to mankind in this our day, even as our pioneer fathers a hundred years ago used everything that was available to them. It is not for us to use their methods alone hut to use the principles on which they builded and by which they lived, and to add to and multiply the use of those principles by everything that is available to us. If we can have a conversation with one man, well and good, hut if we can multiply this by modern means of communication by a mil- lion or several millions, so much the better, and by Mich means, as well as by our individual opportunities and efforts, this obligation that has been placed upon us is within realisation, theoretically at least. practically, I believe. These are just a few passing thoughts of the significance of our centennial. I should like to add two more before sitting down. One, that I believe there is no greater mission held, however much we may emphasise others, than there is at home and in the home. Night before last I read in the newspaper of a mother who had been chosen as Utah's Mother of 1947. and who had fifty-eight living descendants. I remember reading of an elderly patriarch in T tab County, some years ago. who was then living but has since died, and who then had one hundred fortv-eight living descendants. I recall having seen a picture of President George F. Richards and his excel- lent family on the occasion of his eightieth birthday. They then num- bered, as I recall, more than ninety descendants living, and they no doubt have added many more since then in these past five or six years. What would have been the cumulative result if, manv years ago, someone hadn't done his duty in the Church, and had allowed one of these three whom I have mentioned to become indifferent or estranged from the Church early in life or to become offended for some reason ? When we are dealing with the life of a boy or girl, we are not dealing with a whole posterity, and not with time only, but with life Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE 11 eternal. And there is no greater mission mothers and fathers can perform than to keep their sons and daughters close to them and close to the Church, and no greater mission that we at home can perform than to see that no one has cause for offence because of us, and that no one is allowed to lapse into indifference and inactivity, and that no one who is now inactive fails to be laboured with, with all that we have to give, because we are -not dealing with an individual only ; we are dealing with generations and with ultimate consequences of which we have no conception. I plead with you, my brothers and sisters, to consider this fact, and whenever you look at an individual, don't think of him just as he is, but think of the potentialities of his life and of generations to come — and never give him up. And now, returning to the subject of world populations: A few months ago on a nationwide radio network two of America's eminent statisticians and authorities on population advocated as a solution to world troubles a planned limitation of population. Almost at the same time or a little later another authority was telling us that within five years from now, perhaps not more than ten per cent, of us would be left living. These two views are difficult to reconcile. It would be wonderful if the experts could only agree, but where they can't, confusion is the result. But we do know what the Lord's plans and purposes are ; what he expects of us ; and the fear in our hearts concerning these things can be quieted ; and our confusion and our apprehension in these times of wild rumour and of potentialities that are beyond our understand- ing for good and for evil, for destruction as well as for the making of good things, can be made to give way to calm assurance, if we will follow the counsel of the Lord, accept the counsel of His appointed servants, and live our lives as we know they should be lived. If we will do so we need not worry about these predictions, but we shall find satisfaction and happiness and peace and accomplishment in life, and can go our way and trust our Father in heaven for the ultimate consequences. mi ii 1 1 minium in inn nun immiiimiimi ATTENTION MISSIONARIES In regards to inquiries concerning missionary participa- tion in Hui Tan competitions, it has been decided that it would be best if missionaries participate only in two numbers, the ladies' and nun's choruses and the choirs. rilllll Illtll I TE KARERE I94fi Gaining a Testimony 1 >v Elder William I ). Joni s The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- faints considers a personal testimony of the truthfulness of the Gospel so important that one service each month is set apart for the purpose of bearing testimonies. When Christ asked the Apostles, \"Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am?*' they answered with the names of various prophets such as Elijah, Jeremiah, or even John tin Baptist. It is evident that the spirit <»f testimony was not among the majority- <»:' the people at this time. They accepted Him as a prophet hut not as the Messiah. Christ then asked \"But whom say ye that I am?\" Peter answer- ing for the Twelve -aid, \"Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God.\" This testimony of Peter's was simple and yet Brigham Young tells us in the M.I. A. theme for this everyone get a knowledge for himself that this work is true — then let every person say: \"I will live my religion — I will walk humbly before my God and deal honestly with my fellow beings.\" [s it possible for each one of us to \"get a knowledge for hin that this work is true?\" A person desirous of knowing the truth- fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ should ask the Father in the name of Je us, and with sincerity of heart, if this work is true. Will God turn away from the honest heart seeking for truth? No — we are told that lie will give \"liberally\" if a person will ask \"in faith.\" We can's always prove things by tangible proof— yet deep down inside we can receive the knowledge that they are true. Christ gave US the admonition. \"My doctrine is not mine but His that sent me. If any man will do I lis will, he shall know of the doc- trine, whether it he of God, or whether I speak of myself.\" When you do I lis will you put yourself in tune with God and through — and only through Him can you know that this is the work of God. Men with their worldly wisdom cannot disprove, nor can they prove it to he true, to either themselves or to other-. Nothing less than the power of God can enlighten our understanding to comprehend and accept this glorious truth. I )o you have a testimony of the Gospel? Do you know that Christ lives and answers prayers? \"Ask and it shall he given you; seek, and yet shall find; knock, and it shall he opened unto you.\" Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE 13 Let us all study and pray ; and live our religion so that we may gain this testimony . . . \"and this is life eternal that they might know Thee the true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou has sent.\" I bear you my testimony that Christ does live and answer pray- ers and that this is The Gospel of Jesus Christ, and by living its everlasting principles we can come back into the presence of our Father in Heaven. Calling All M.I.A's Now is the time for all M.I.A's. to get ready for another big year. Mutual will open on February 10th. We encourage every branch to have a big opening social to announce the opening of an- other M.I. A. season. Be sure and contact all the members of your branch that are of Mutual age, and invite them to your opening social. It would be nice if you could send out printed invitations so that everyone will be sure to know of the opening of M.I. A. The officers and teachers should be organised now so that the opening social will be a success and so that this year may be started in full swing. Have a complete set of executive officers, a competent teacher for each class, and the cultural arts directors chosen as soon as possible so they can start planning their year's work. If a branch has only one set of officers, it would have a president, a counsellor in charge of the age groups, a counsellor in charge of recreational activities, and a secretary. If the M.I. A. is completely organised, it should have two sets of the above officers — one for the Young- Women andjDne for the Young Men. The M.I.A's. will be able to participate in the following classes this year : Special Interest Groups for adults over 25 years of age, M Men for men 16 years and over, Gleaners for girls 16 years and over, Explorers for boys 12 to 15 years, and Bee Hive for girls 12 to 15 years. The Explorer Class is new to New Zealand Mission, and a very fine programme has been planned for boys of the Explorer age. We especially urge every M.I. A. to organise Explorer and Bee Hive classes because we want these young boys and girls to become part of the Mutual Improve- ment Associations. Cultural Arts will include Music,, Drama. Dance, and Speech Arts. We want to make this one of the most successful years the New Zealand M.T.A. has ever had. We can do this only by following as closely as possible the fine programme sent out by the General Board.

Board. 1-* TE KARgRE Hatraere, L948 Why I Do Not Drink By Joy Elm eb Morgan Dr. Joy Elmer Morgan is Editor of The Journal of the Wit tonal Education Association, Washington, /'.('. Like other people who are abstainers, i refrain from the use of alcoholic beverages for a number of reasons, all of which have their roots in personal experience and in my reflections on these experi- ments. We always justify our conduct, however good or had, when it deviates from that of people with whom we associate. In these days when people move about in ever-widening circles which tend to cover the whole earth, we face association with people whose habits, manners and customs arc different from our own. Our ability to sur- vive and to grow will depend upon our ability to hold to that which is good. First, ] am a total abstainer because my grandparents, who took charge of me in infancy when my mother died, were people of high integrity who would not have liquor in the house or employ anyone on the farm who used liquor. They missed no opportunity to point out its effect on the lives of people whom we knew in the community. Second. 1 am an abstainer because my early teacher- in the one- roomed country .school took seriously their responsibility to teach the harmful effects of alcohol upon the human body and upon success in life. Third, 1 am an abstainer because 1 lived as a boy in a small community where we knew < nd could see first hand what drinking did to people. We say about us poverty, violence, family brutality, neglect, and desertion because men drank. A neighbour who lived some distance beyond us bought a team of horses from my grandfather. This man, who had a wife and several children, would town on Saturday nights and often get drunk. The saloon- keeper would have him carried out and put into his wagon and would start the team of horses down the road toward his home. When they came to our place they would turn into the yard. If my grand- father happened to he awake he would start them down the road. If not. we would find the man there in the morning sleeping, often half frozen. Fourth. I am an abstainer because I went to normal school to prepare for teaching. The normal school had been founded by Horace Mann, one of the most ardent advocates of abstinence this Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE 15 country has ever known. He believed that men should live according to the laws of God and nature. He had deep religious convictions about the use of liquor and tobacco which he passed on to his follow- ers. The normal schools reflected these convictions in both their students and faculties ; teachers' colleges which took their place still reflect that sentiment to a marked degree. Illinois Normal University prints in its catalogue a notice, which I believe should be in every college catalogue, to the effect that students who -use liquor will not be continued in college. I know that rule is enforced because, some years ago when I delivered the commencement address there, a mem- ber of the board told me a group of seniors had been expelled shortly before graduation because of a drinking party in which they had been involved. Harsh, you say ! Not half so harsh as allowing these young people to go on and ruin their own lives and the lives of the young people they would teach because they had failed to acquire a civilised sense of values. The universities, particularly those located in the larger cities, have not been so careful to establish abstinence in the lives of their students. So the weakening of the teaching of the effects of alsohol in the schools began as an increasing number of teachers came to take their preparation in universities rather than normal school or teachers' colleges. Members of university faculties commonly confuse liberal- ism in political, social, and economic thought with license in personal conduct. Fifth, I am an abstainer because I have seen the devastating effects of liquor on the lives of many able men whom I have known personally. I could name a dozen noted university professors who have been handicapped all their lives by the drink habit. I could tell the story of a fine college president who had been an abstainer all his life up to the time he came to Washington as a congressman. Here he was so debauched by liquor in a few years that the people in his district learned of it and failed to return him ! after which he drank himself to death. Sixth, I am a total abstainer because I know our country and the world are entering the most difficult period in human history — a per- iod when the stakes for civilisation or chaos are the highest they have ever been; a period when we can drift into the inmost brutality and confusion or move forward into the most glorious period the human race has ever known. Whether we shall do the one or the other will depend upon the integrity and self-discipline of our people. We can- not work out the problems that face US with minds befuddled and lives wrecked 1>\\ drink. 1\" TE KAR] Huraere, IM8 Raft Voyage \"Proves\" Origin of South Sea Natives By Ottis I 'eterson Washington. A young Norwegian ethnologist who has heard of the Book of Mormon but never read it, has contributed substantial proof to the Latter-day Saint belief that the South Pacific [slands are peopled with descendants of Lehi who sailed or drifted acri Pacific from South America about 50 B.C. He is Thor Heyerdahl, 32. who is in Washington followin completion of a 101-day journe) by ran from Peru to the I -. Pushing oft\" from Gallao, Peru, on April 28 with five other adventuresome young Norwegians to test his theory, his raft was caught in the Humboldt current, swept northwesterly until they met the equatorial current and tide winds and then westerly and south again once more to Raroia '-'and in the Tuarnotu Archipelago. They had travelled 4300 miles while the distance as the crow flies between their launching and landing points was about 4000 miles. On the water only 101 days, they had been aided by a small sail on their raft. Drifting without the help of this sail, Heyerdahl estimated it would have taken better than 22? days to cover the same territory. It is this route which they followed which the group of Nepl led by Hagoth is believed to have taken them, as described in Alma It came to pass that one ship also did sail forth and whither she did go, we know not.\" The modern day explorers of the vast South Pacific used a raft 45 feet by 18 fe< t, the foundation of which was nine giant balsa logs brought down from the Ecuadorian jungle. They were lashed to- gether with nine smaller logs used as tie pieces, and the whole raft was covered with a deck' of braided hamhoo. ( >ne small hut with a roof of thatched banana leaves was their only shelter. For rations, they took along U.S. Army E and 10-1 rations. Some subsisted solely on these rations a- a rest while others supple- mented their diet with fish caught en route or a microscopic animal and. plant food drifting near the surface of the ocean known as \"plankton.\" This was gathered in a fine mesh conical net which ■rd behind the raft. On this small craft, with only a small sail and a steering oar and a seven-watt radio to keep in touch with the outside world, the adven- turesome group cast themselves on the mercy of the wind, and current. The first several days out were rather rough in the choppy, coastwise Humboldt current but after the group reached the equatorial current, the journey was uneventful. Actually, the raft rode better than a Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE 17 small boat. Being flat, it rode the waves up and down with very little sideway roll. The group stood two-hour watches at the steering oar, night and day, and took turns looking after a portable kerosene stove, but their drifting journey was without moment until early the morning of their 93rd day out of Peru. By the first grey light of morning, they watched an island vanish over the horizon behind them after vainly attempting to turn about and navigate their ungainly craft against the current. By their computation this island was Pukapuka, outpost of the Tuamoto archipelago. A few days later they, passed another island but were unable to navigate their craft to a landing. Finally, on the 101st day out, they beached on the island of Raroia, after nearly floating all the way through the Tuamoto group. Heyerdahl was not surprised at their landing in these islands. It simply confirmed his own conclusions, based on research first started in 1937 when he went to the Marquesas Islands, somewhat north of where he landed, that the ancient peoples of the South Pacific Islands came not from Asia as so many believe, but rather had drifted across the South Pacific with the prevailing westerly wind. Furthermore, as he concludes in a manuscript now in prepara- tion which he hopes to publish in the spring, this same group of people \"came with the wind and current to Mexico and Yucatan (from across the Atlantic) and left with the wind and current from the opposite coast of Peru.\" His conclusion is identical with the Mormon belief as taken from the Book of Mormon, even though he drew his findings without any knowledge of the Book of Mormon other than that it existed. \"I have here dwelt to some extent with the problem of these suddenly appearing^ and presently lost civilisations of America,\" he wrote, \"because the intelligent and amazing race who is responsible for this immense evolution and who left the titantic tooled blocks along their own path, in my opinion is identical with those men who first reached the south seas. They came with the wind and current to Mexico and Yucatan and left with the wind and current from the opposite coast of Peru.\" Almost as fascinating as Heyerdahl's drifting trip across the Pacific is his research which led up to the decision to use this spec- tacular way to confirm his opinion. He is every inch the explorer, his blue eyes looking right through you into the great beyond as he talks of his explorations in the origin of the Polynesians. Born in Larvik, Norway, in 1914, he early developed a special interesl in animal life and the life and customs of primitive peoples. He had his own little zoological museum by the time lie graduated from high school. From 1933 to 1936, he studied zoology at the University of Oslo but in 1937, his interest suddenly changed. is TE KARERE Hanuere, 1948 Living a honeymoon year with his bride as the only white people on Fatuhiva, in the Marquesas Islands, he made archeologicaJ dis- coveries and observations thai led him to susped thai prehistoric American Indians had reached these far-flung and scattered shores. He promptly dropped zoology and devoted all his time to a com- parative study <>f American and Polynesian races and cultures. He reached the conclusion that two separate waxes of human immigrants had reached Polynesia rrom early America. The earliest of these, he belives to be the pre-Incaic Indians from Peru, The other was northwesl coastal Indians from British Colum- bia. It is the Peruvian migration which Latter-day Saints believe stems from the lost ship of Hagoth. Only in time is there a difference of opinion and then only 500 years — not much when delving into history of prehistoric times. Latter-day Saints believe the migration took place about 50 B.C. Heyerdahl fixes the time as 500 years after the birth of Christ. The northwest American Indian migration, he believes, took place 500 years later. His belief that the Polynesians stem from the same mysterious of God-like supermen who first introduced a. new culture in America, is based on endless comparisons. \"The Incas in Peru.\" he writes, \"like the Polynesians in Oceania. appear in their own domain to have succeeded a highly cultured and presently unknown race of workers in stone that are responsible for colossal monuments and megalithic ruins left among them as archaeo- logical curiosities of unknown origin. \"As the Polynesian history on independent groups thaught that a fair, European-like race preceded their own in the Mast Pacific, 50 did the old Peruvians on the adjacent mainland insist that certain tall and European-like individuals of a white and bearded race inhabited the ridge of the Cordilleras before the rise of the Inca empire. \"They were accredited with the prc-Tncaic achievements at Tia- huanaco, and possessed precisely the same properties as the fair race that had rached the Polynesian groups. Like them, they were des- cribed as highly cultured, intelligent and ingenious with a very peace- ful and benevolent disposition and God-like in character although entirely human. \"Precisely as in the case of Polynesia, these megalithic .architects were specifically considered the children of the Sun God and as in ( )ceania. so also in Peru, some of the fair men became local demigods and progenitors of the later native dynasty. \"In the legendary history of Peru, the white race of the high- lands was attacked by hostile natives and under the leadership of the deified Tici. they embarked at the coast of Ecuador where the power- Hanuere, 1948 TE KARERE 19 ful current turns west and flows with the trade winds into the Poly- nesian domain. On all the widespread islands of Polynesia, Tiki is the universal name of that particular culture hero who is considered the progenitor of the Island race. \"In Peru, the subjects of Tiki, who built for him the colossal temple at Tiahuanaco, were expressly stated to have had their ears enormously enlarged. The same curious custom distinguished the long-eared crew of those legendary craft who first discovered Easter Island on their exploring journey from some high mountain land tq the east. The Easter Island statues, carved with long ears and pre- sumably representing ancestral heroes of the early cultured race, have marked Caucasian aspects including a bearded chin. \"There is a continuous correspondence between all of the prin- cipal architectural remains left behind since pre-Incaic time by the unknown visitors to the Andean Plateau, and the unidentified vestiges of a similar alien origin in the Polynesian micronesian domain. Every such feature of Oceania is but a locally modified imitation of similar construction that appears to converge on a mutual spreading centre at Tiahuanaco, Peru. This includes the stepped Oceanic pyramids, the tooled and nicely fitted walls and terraces, the canals and mega- lithic wharfs, the paved ways, the ecclesiastic and megalithic gateways, the colossal stone statues, the burial vaults, subterranean galleries, dolmens, qiclopean stone discs and many less impressive features.\" Eleyerdahl called his expedition \"Kan-tiki\" in honour of the legendary rules of Tiahuanaco, who led his followers out of the moun- tains and across the Pacific. The ethnologist also goes at length into the reasons for his belief that northwest American Indians also found their way into the Pacific Islands. One most interest substantiation is that the Maori canoe has all the features of a canoe peculiar to the northwest Indians, that the Maori dwellings are very similar and that pottery is notably absent in both places, although widely used among the Mongolians to the west. Stone pounders of the Polynesians, elaborately carved and polished, are very similar to the household pestles used by the Indians for grinding meal. Heyerdahl sees another major substantiation in the presence in the Pacific Islands of the sweet potato, gourd and coconut. Patholo- gists are agreed he said, that sweet potatoes and gourds could not possibly germinate and grow wild if they had conceivably drifted across the Pacific. Nor could the coconut have reproduced itself after existing in salty brine the 200 or more days required to drift from South America to the islands. Yet all of these products are native of the Americas, not Asia or Australia. Heyerdahl, a member of the Explorers Club, expects to spend some weeks getting his notes into shape and will make Washington his headquarters during that time. — The Church News. \\~ -'0 TE KARERE Hanuere, 19-18 I Matatau a Hohepa, Te Poropiti Ki Nga Mano o te Rangi \\'.\\ Tim UAK] I [OAN] TlERA He mea tango mai i te pukapuka \"Temples of the Most High\" I te whakahau a te tumuaki o te Mihana No I lori 1 [ooro i whakamaori T whaka-nohia tatou ki tend ao kia mahi ngatahi me te Atua, i nga mahi whakaora i te hunga e ora ana; i nga mahi ano hoki hei whakaora i te hunga kua mate, hei toha»atu i nga manaakitanga i tapaea mo o tatou tupuna, kia maringi atu ano hoki te inati i tapaea mo a tatou tamariki.

A hui peka is planned for the near fut- ure so that the reorganisation of the branch can become completed. We feel sure that the new programme when start- ed will give everyone a chance to prove his worth, and tend to promote greater unity and understanding of the work to be accomplished here. The new Elders wish also to extend their thanks to all the members of the Manaia branch for their kindness and warm welcome into their midst, we hope they will be with us for quite some time.

KAIKOHE BRANCH By Hone Wahapu During the past months Elder Chap- man, Wing, Burt and Low have been vis- iting the homes of the Saints, giving words of advice and encouragement. A hui peka, one of the best in the history of the Kaikohe Branch, was held November 8th and 9th. The Saturday night sessions of the Primary and Mutual were conducted by Sis. Huria Whiu and Bro. Mita Heremaia respectively. A special feature of the programme was songs and hakas. Sunday morning the Relief Society and priesthood meetings were held. After a very fine Sunday School programme a genealogical meet- ing was held, being conducted by Bro. Hirihi T. Heremaia. The general session then took place with Bro. Hone Wahapu presiding. During the conference, Bro. Penetana Komene was baptized by Elder Burt. Throughout the conference a spiritual feast was enjoyed by all. Much appreciation is extended to the marae folks for their very substantial contribu- tion to the success of the hui. The hui will live long in the memory of all those who were fortunate to attend. Dr. Paewai is doing fine work in the Sunday School as well as the choir which he has organised with the help of Elder Burt. WELLINGTON BRANCH By Fay Loader We are very sorry to inform readers of the death of Sister ML J. C. Chapman of Lower Hutt. The funeral service was held at Crofts' Chapel and was con- ducted by Branch President Domney. The speakers were Elder K. Hawkins and Bro. Domney and the grave was dedicated by Elder H. T. Eckersley. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family of Sis. Chapman in their sad loss. Among the many visitors to our branch were Elders Pitcher and Hunsaker, Mrs. Christy from Nuhaka and Bros. Ottley and Ralph Hammon from Rotorua. This month the M.I. A. and Relief Society have been busy preparing pro- grammes for Sunday night which were dedicated to the Pioneers of the Church. For the M.I. A. programme we have to thank the Elders who wrote the Bcripl and many thanks .to Elder Eckersley for a beautiful painting of the Salt Lake Temple. A welcome addition to our branch is Sis. Ruth Meha of Waipawa. Bro. and Sis. Tarawhiti have now moved into town to live and we appre- ciate their attendance at meetings very much. We an pleased i\" see sis. Gibbs and her daughter attending meetings. Elder Hunsaker paid us a short visit prior to his going to Auckland and from there to U.S.A. We wish him all the very best for his future.

They are: Elder John Lake, from Inglewood, California and Elder Joseph Wilber Stelter from Union, Utah. TIMARU BRANCH By Elders S. L. Baker and C. E. Pearce. Four months have passed since mis- sionary work was opened up in Timaru, South Island. It is four months marked by many memorable experiences. Timaru is that eight minute stop on the trolley line along the east coast of the South Island with the tourist-attract- ing Caroline Bay, and the \"view of Mount Cook on a clear day.\" With a popula- tion of 23,000, it spreads over an area not large enough to make bus travel necessary, but just large enough to cause steady wear on shoe leather. A strange and lonely place it was for the first while. The streets were new, and the people gave us that look of won- der that asked who these foreign-clad strangers were, and what was their busi- ness. They soon were to learn, for it seemed as though the Lord presented opportun- ity after opportunity for us to make friends and make known our message, until \"these Mormon missionaries\" wore common topic, and we often were met at the door with the comment, \"So you're the ones !\" • The slide film projector with its films on Utah scenery and Church history proved its worth as a door-opener and friend-maker by opening one opportunity into another in chain action. There was fust a film showuu: at the home of a casual acquaintance, who later arranged for a showing at a Junior Chamber of Commerce meeting, which led to many openings into homes. With the publicity thai grew from these lectures and from a favourable article published by the Timaru Herald on our purposes in Tim- aru. other opportunitiei arpse, both for showings in private homes and at civic l~ l_ I ' 1 I KARERE Hanucre, l'^s meetings.

AUCKLAND BRANCH mnie Horlock Under the direction oi Bide* Dale, a very inspiring pageanl was staged re- cently in the Druids' Hall, where the Auckland and Rangitoto Branche bined for the programme. The Rangitoto Choir assisted the Pageant with their beautiful and very appropriate singing which was much enjoyed by all. At the close of the Mutual year, a verv successful dance was held by the Ml'.A. in the Druids* Hall. November 7th. With the mystifying name of \"Heap Big POW Wow\" and with an Indian setting it drew a big crowd and a good time was had by all. The Rangitoto Choir was present and favoured us w-jth a very fine rendering of \"Pale Moon.\" Cottage meetinKS are now being regu- larly held in Sandringham at the home of Bro. and Sis. Ottley. A special evening was held to farewell Elders Arthur and Young who have been labouring in the Auckland district. Elder Arthur goes to Manaia and Elder Young to Masterton. We wish them good luck in their new districts. We welcome back Elder McKee who laboured here at the beginning of his mission. We also wel- come two new Elders from Zion, Elders Durant and Andrus. We are very disappointed that it has become necessary as a result of the in- fantile paralysis epidemic to cancel the various children's functions arranged for December Lastly I wish to state that the engage- ment is announced between your re- porter.

The smoker who buys sixpence worth of tobacco, seems to think that he has acquired the right to befoul the air wherever he goes. He puffs smoke into the passerby on the crowded sidewalk, and fills the air of the public din- ing room with the fumes of his mid-meal or after-meal cigar or cigar- ette. In many countries he invades the cinema and the theatre, and reluctantly obeys the published request not to smoke in the opera. He crowds into the non-smoking compartment of the railroad car and argues the case if some courageous non-smoker insists upon the right to breathe unpolluted air. He is in every lobby and waiting room. He is an omnipresent chimney, belching forth fumes noxious to a normal sense of smell and always injurious to the human body. He has made himself, by his disregard of others, an intolerable nuisance. A man who must smoke should do so privately or in such places and in such a manner as not to give offence to others. That seems a self-evident proposition from the point of view of courtesy and pro- priety. The violation of its simply illustrates the moral deterioration that measurably affects every constant used of tobacco. Many good and excellent men have acquired the tobacco habit, but invariably, the quality of the moral fibre tends to be lowered thereby. The con- tempt of the smoker for the rights of the non-smoker, who as yet belongs to the majority among civilised people, is ample proof of this statement. So far has the smoker gone in his indifference to public rights that the thinking smokers, themselves, have called a halt. An influ- ential London daily newspaper recently warned the smoker that the continuation of such carelessness of the rightful claims of others would probably lead to popular objections, resulting in legal limitations being placed upon smokers. Latter-day Saints are taught to abstain completely from the use of tobacco. They should insist upon their rights to breathe air free from tobacco fumes. The tobacco habit is noxious, unclean, expensive and unhealthful. It has no place in communities of high civilisation. It is often a pre- cursor of the alcohol habit, of which it is a near relative. The wonder grows that an intelligent man can be SO stupid as to believe that the purchase of \"sixpence worth <>i tobacco .unes him the right to art as a general polluter of fresh air. If it is not stupidity, it i> downrighl and unpardonable discourtesy. From John A. Widtsoe's \"Man and ///<• Dragon.\" ■ • | • 1 I IITITIT Chun lull Drive, \\\\ Is ( row, Utah, ( October 24, llM7.

There was one item of particular note that should be <'t' interesl to the Eiunga Tapu of New Zealand, however, and that was the Reunion of the New Zealand Missionary Society, held in the Capitol Hill Ward. There is no doubt tins was the finesl reunion held since the ending of the war. and the resumption of reunion, in cpfinection with conference, A rather large crowd was in attendance: Bro. and Sis.

We hope' our thoughts can U put into some positive actions. At hast, plans were discussed for future action on our part. Elder I.. I). Burbridge was elected Presi- dent of the Association. During the centennial summer just passing, several outings were held for the local group of Elders, under direction of 1\\. A. Lambert, and Geo. Biesinger, and Glenn Rudd. To honour a large pari Saints from the Oahu stake in Hawaii, we held a special party and outing up Big Cottonwood Canyon. Thirty-five Hawaiian Saint-. plus the local \"Kia Ngawari\" group of Elders and their families. brought the total present at the outing, to 135. A big kai was spread, with entertainment following. The Elders demonstrated some haka and action songs, and the Ilawaiians reciprocated with songs, hula, and other dances of the Islands. On the day Elder Matthew Cowley returned from his trip through the Pacific, another outing was held for the missionaries and their families. We were thrilled to have Bro. Cowley meet with us. and tell us of hi; trip through the Pacific missions. Recreation, kai. and programme added to the outing, and brought us closer together, as former missionaries. In September, another outing was held. All the Scott sister- of Wellington were in Salt Lake together, so an outing was field, and .all the local former New Zealand Saints were invited to meet with the Elders. President Cowley and family again favoured us with their attendance. A good time was had bj all.

Elder Kirkham attended the available schools in Lehi and was later graduated from Brigham Young University at Provo, having served twice as President of the University Alumni Association. He studied music for three years in Germany, this was followed by two years of music teaching in Ricks College, Rexburg, Idaho. Then he spent another two years of music study at Columbia Univer- sity, New York City. From 1908 to 1913 he was head of the music department at the L.D.S. University.

Among these should he noted his pressing concern for the welfare of youth and of hi- fellow men generally, his wide travel and sympathetic acquaintance with many lands and peoples, and tin- personal integrity of his life, his unquestioned sincerity and devotion to the cause of truth, and his willingness to pursue any call that comes to him from the authorities of tin- Church even though it take him from pursuits he has long loved and followed.

Thereby may be won the joys of all time. This is so, because knowledge and observance of law- are the foundation of all progress. Without law. confusion rules. Before it was understood that the universe is law- directed, the abominations of die Dark Ages— witchcraft, necromancy and all manner of superstition — seared human life. Whenever civil law has been ignored, brigandage and immorality have covered the earth. When divine law has been rejected, men have cursed God and died in hopeless despair. On the other hand, obedience to law — natural, human, and divine — has brought peace and progress and has enabled mankind to rise to increasing heights of happiness. Orderliness is the essence, the other name, of law. ( )rder prevails throughout nature. The heavenly bodies move in ^uch courses that their positions may be foretold, year-, ahead ; the infinitesimal electrons which sustain all matter, maintain their positions with unerring regularity. Growth and decay; health and disease; joy and sorrow, are but manifestations of the orderly operation of law. Chance is the name of the unknown law. Man now dwells with certainty upon the earth, for he knows that eternal order will preserve him. if he but learn to understand it. Ik- hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons. — Doc. and Cov. 88:42. Pepuere. 1948 TE KARERE 35 The first expression of universal order is that a given cause always has the same effect. Under the same conditions, gasoline will always burst into flame when a lighted match is touched to it, or the finger burned if brought too near the fire. Yesterday, to-day and forever, like causes produce like effects. In words given to the Prophet Joseph Smith : There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are presicated — And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obed- ience to that law upon which it is predicated. — Doc. and Cov. 130:20, 21. The universal reign of law under which man lives not only offers the happy certainty of an orderly universe, but also the stern warning, that in a world where cause and effect are invariable, man cannot escape the effects of his actions. That is more terrible than the threat of a sulphurous hell. Law. therefore, is both a protector and a rewarder. In obedience to law lies man's greatest opportunity. lie must pay the price for all that he receives; but, if he chooses to obey the law, he may receive eternal value for every earn- est effort. The Lord has spoken: Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye abide by law ye cannot attain to this glory. — Doc. and Cov. 132:21. — From John A.

Primary workers will be inspired by the Following counsel which is quoted from conference addresses: — Elder Ezra Taft Benson: The Church had only been organised a very short time when the Lord spoke regarding this important obligation of parents in the training of their children. (See 68th section of the Doctrine and Covenants). The obligation to teach the principles of the gospel to the youth of Zion rests squarely upon the parents of the Church. Not only is there an obligation to teach these principles, but the Lord says in this same revelation: \"And their children shall he baptized for the remis- sion of their sins when eight years bid, and receive the laying on of hands.\" (Doc. and Coy. 68:_)7. | Then it is an obligation of parents to see that these -acred ordin- ances are performed after the children have Been properly taught. It is not the prerogative of parents to permit their children to grow Up and choose for themselves. It is their duty and obligation to train them when they .are yet young, and to see that these important ordin- ances are performed in their behalf. In this same revelation the Lord indicates that it is the responsi- bility of parents to teach their children to pray. That does not mean only secret prayers. I am sure it means to teach by example through family prayers. We need the sanctifying influence which comes from devotion in the home, pray as a family. The Lord indicates further that they should keep the Sabbath day holy, that they should remem- ber their labours, that there should be no idleness, and I fe speaks very directly regarding the matter of children growing up in idleness. Elder Henry I). Moyle : You know there is one other thing that our programme does that is certainly praiseworthy. The Apostle Paul when he was speaking Pepuere, 1948 TE KARERE 37 to the Ephesians said: \"Children obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and thy mother ; which is the first commandment with promise ; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. And ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\" This great Welfare Programme of ours is calculated to bring father and son, into that close relationship and communion that Paul would have had exist in the Church in his day. Elder Oscar A. Kirkham : This Church. has ever been deeply interested in youth. In its beginning God put full trust in a boy and he became the leader of this dispensation. Young men, \"largely, who fought their way into the beginnings of this great western land — we must be deeply con- cerned with youth. Our hope lies here. The after years set us so fast in habits. If but one generation would truly devote itself and give of itself to the youth of the land what great things might be wrought. Elder Milton R. Hunter: Youth of the Church, there are many shadows of true happiness that you will be tempted to grab after, and I promise you that if you grab after them you will find that you have lost the good things that you have — happiness, the Gospel and probably eternal life and you will receive in return only a shadow of true happiness. The things that I have in mind we call sin; all of the sins that we may commit. The prophet has said that sin never was happiness. Today I call upon all the youth of the Church to make a resolution that you will never take a smoke. If you have taken one that you will never take another. That you will never take a drop of liquor in any form. If you have already done so that you will repent and resolve today that you will never take another drop of liquor. And I promise you if you will do this that you will be happy throughout this life and throughout eternity because you have kept your bodies clean. Bisho? Le Grand Richards: Xow I want-to admonish you to pray for your children, to work for your children, to do all within your power to help to save them, God may not always send an angel from heaven as He did in answer to Alma's prayer, but 1 want to tell you there are men and women in this Church by the thousands and tens of thousands that are angels of heaven in the hands of God in helping to show the youth of /.ion the way to eternal life.

We know some of the teachings that are contrar) to the teachings of the Church. We know some of the articles that they read, and we know the speeded highway and the high-powered auto- mobiles, and that i> why we are worried about them, because we love them so much. And I would say to the young people of the Church, stay close to your parents. you boys of the Church, if I could only touch your hearts to urge you to tell your dad everything that goes on in your life. I feel sorry for a young man who cannot tell his dad everything. And I feel sorry for a young girl who cannot tell her mother everything. We know you will make mistakes sometimes, hut we will love you just the same, and we hope that we can instill confidence into you, that you will come and confide in us. If we expect to share your joys we must expect to share your sorrows and your mistakes and your problems. Missionary Returns to Zion Elder James Wesle) Poulsen of Sacra- mento.

Pepuere, 1948 TE KARERE 39 Oscar A. Kirkham OF THE FIRST COUNCIL OF THE SEVENTY Address delivered at the Saturday evening session of the 115th semi-annual general conference, October 7, 1944, in the Tabernacle. I never appear in a capacity of this kind but what I am almost over-awed with the challenging1 responsibility that is mine. As I hesitate for a moment, to try to feel the inspiration that may be mine, with your faith and prayers, I am at this moment constrained to do something different from what I have prepared if I had spoken over the air, and I shall follow that inspiration. As I have travelled up and down the Church, I have been im- pressed as I have met you brethren, many of you, in wards and stakes, under the stress and strain of a year that has perhaps no comparison in our history, and also that has drawn upon us, and our energy, like no other year in our life. I feel in my heart tonight, here in our in- timate relationship in a priesthood meeting to give you for your own consideration and thinking one or two things that have been helpful to me in my life. I feel sure they have a spiritual relationship ; they have a priest- hood relationship ; and are vital to our success. I want to suggest to you one or two daily tasks. They have helped me. The first one: Every day, if we are going to fulfil our responsi- bility in leadership in the Church, we should do something which will protect and build our bodies. They are the tabernacles of the spirit, and we should do everything we can to keep them clean and efficient. No matter on what age level we are living, we should have an- nually, a physical examination ; and then, under the advice and counsel of medical help, take up some simple form of exercise, or experience in the open where we can keep ourselves fit. Too many of the brethren that I see as I visit about the Church have neglected that opportunity, and as a result, not only in their physical life and enjoyment, but in their spiritual obligations they are not doing their best. I happened to have the opportunity once to meet one of the Mayo brothers, and \\ asked him a question about the relationship o\\ the spirit of man and his physical body. He said to me, \"I don't know just exactly what you refer to, but,\" and he put his hand up before me and said. \"I have often thought 40 TE KARERE Pepuere, 1948 about where life begins and ends, and if I draw a knife it is hard to tell where the spirit begins and where the flesh ends or begins. It is all wrapped up together.\" I can testify to yon brethren, myself, that because of a had stom- ach I have said unkind words. When I am not feeling physically fit, I have not been at my best, in kindness and in efficiency. So 1 appeal to you to-night, and from my life I bear testimony that I know if I keep at it, as I strive to do every day, something to keep myself phy- sically fit, I am helping myself so that I can give better service, and I am also more susceptible to the spirit of inspiration and help from on high. I know you can cite, and maybe you have in mind now, some of the great intellectual geniuses, some of the great spiritual characters who have not enjoyed the best of health. But with the responsibility that is ours, I am sure that we can be more efficient if we sincerely care for ourselves, every day in some way. Another suggestion I make to you, and I am sure it will help us, is that every day we take one of our standard works of the Church, or the work of some good commentator of gospel principles, and read at least fifteen to thirty minutes. It is this every day that counts, forming the habit ; it is worth more than two hours' reading at some one time. If you have the responsibility of leading a quorum or some other definite religious instruction work, try this method of prepara- tion. Read the text through, then a period of meditation, then read- ing again, and so the third and the fourth and the fifth reading brings fuller understanding. We must go beyond the first impressions, deep into the heart of the text ; there we will find the real challenging truth. I am reading now the New Testament, and I am practicing as best I can the very thing that I am trying to give you, and I am sure it will be helpful to you. And so I suggest that you read every day fifteen to thirty minutes on some gospel theme. Get the habit, it will help you wonderfully; it will colour the whole day. Your medi- tations will be upon the glorious things of our Heavenly Father. Then when the hour comes, and you ask for the inspiration of God, the Holy Ghost will quicken your memory, and the beautiful things from your reading will come to you and help and bless you. Now, out of my years of experience with boy life I make the next suggestion to you, and I know it has a bearing upon our leader- ship in a priesthood capacity and other Church service. From Baden-Powell came this wonderful suggestion to the Boy Scouts, and he gave it to the world. It has resulted in more real in- Pepuere, 1948 TE KARERE 41 spiration for service to mankind than almost any text that I know of, and it is simply this : \"Every day do a good turn.\" Please do not feel that I am referring at this moment now to a boy ; I am talking to a man. I am asking that every day as priesthood leaders this spirit of service go forward in our lives, that we might feel the gospel in action, doing some simple, kindly act.
