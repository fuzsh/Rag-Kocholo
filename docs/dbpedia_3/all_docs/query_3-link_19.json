The Gardiners set up the Cougars when the Canterbury Rams withdrew after the 2008 campaign.\n\nChristchurch was in a unique situation and the Gardiners' home and business were badly affected by the earthquake, Rossiter-Stead said.\n\nBasketball had not been able to use its traditional home Cowles Stadium since the June earthquake, but he said there were other stadia that could be used.\n\nThe Breakers' success in winning the Australian NBL helped create a boom season for the NZ NBL this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEight of the nine teams reported an increase in their average attendances.\n\n\"It's tremendous,\" said Rossiter-Stead.\n\nAndrew Gardiner has not been available for comment.\n\nA Canterbury Basketball administrator said the Gardiners had a licence for the NBL and it was \"completely in their court to do anything with it\".\n\nAn entry next year would be a decision for the Gardiners.\n\n\"Just to have elite level basketball in the city is and would be fantastic, but we are not part of the dialogue.\"\n\nIn the past Canterbury were one of the NBL's most successful teams. The Rams played in seven grand finals between 1986 and 1994 and won four. They played in an eighth final in 1999."
