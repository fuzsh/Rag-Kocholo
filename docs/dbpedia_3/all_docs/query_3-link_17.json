        "text": "This week, the Taylor Hawks have had to make the very difficult decision not to enter into the 2020 Competition that the NZ NBL have put together. We have thoroughly researched the proposal and consulted with the wider basketball community in order to come to this decision.\n\nIt has been a very long process and the continued support of our Board, Kelvin Taylor at Taylor Corp, Brendon Smith at Hastings City Pak’nSave, and our two patrons, Colin Francis and Kevin Atkinson has been invaluable to us. We have reached out to players, coaches and fans for feedback and detail, which was all well reasoned and supportive. Throughout these difficult times created by COVID 19, it has been heartening to hear the positive messages from you all. It is great to see you stand behind your team.\n\nWhile we commend the NZNBL League for all of the work that they have put into this and we are definitely supportive of the intent behind the competition, as of the entry deadline this week, there were still too many unknown factors for us. Essentially, our decision was based on two main factors, community connection and player welfare.\n\nThe success of the Taylor Hawks is based on the support of our community; our Sponsors, our funders, our players and our fans. This had to be in the forefront of our minds through the decision making process. Unfortunately, the draft system and the tight timelines meant that our ability to build a team with a strong connection to our community was going to be very difficult. There was a possibility that we would only have one or two of our team members in the ten player squad.\n\nMany of our extended squad in Hawke’s Bay work or go to school. After the lockdown period, it was almost impossible for them to take the time out for the competition. This meant that we would have to rely heavily on the draft system, which again, gave us very little control over our team. We are not one of the larger regions, but we have built ourselves up to runner up in 2019, so it was important for our community and key stakeholders to maintain the gains we have made over the last few years. In the end, we were unable to build the team in a way that we could show a direct benefit to the Taylor Hawks Community.\n\nThis has the potential to be an intense competition, so the preparation before the competition and the ability to rest and recover throughout the competition are vital to player welfare. Unfortunately, we as a franchise could not prepare for this given the unknown aspects of the draft. Our players are important to us and their welfare had to be a key aspect of this decision also.\n\nThe League are still working on some of these issues and we hope that they can overcome some of the obstacles in their path. Unfortunately, at the point of the deadline, there were still too many unknown factors for us to take the risk.\n\nIt is disappointing that three of the top 2019 teams will not be competing in this competition, but at the end of the day we had to do what is best for our community, our players and our franchise.\n\nWe are now focused on our 2021 Campaign. All of the support we have received so far makes us confident that it will be a good one. Watch this space.\n\nKeith and Amy Price\n\nHawks coach Zico Coronel has urged National Basketball League counterparts to take a leaf out of the manuals of Nelson Giants mentor Jamie Pearlman.\n\n“He’s come from a foreign country and done really well,” said Zico of Pearlman after the Mike Pero-sponsored hosts thumped the Taylor Corporation Hawks 101-78 at Trafalgar Centre in week six of the Sal’s-sponsored NBL on Saturday night.\n\nIn his rookie year as head coach after 13 years as an accomplished assistant, Coronel said some coaches often assumed the mantle without much knowledge of the NBL here but the Australian was an exception.\n\n“He has great knowledge of the league and understanding of the officiating in our league,” Coronel said of the 46-year-old from Cairns, who coached the Taipans in the ANBL last season.\n\nCoronel felt Pearlman had done the best job of all the incumbent NBL coaches in adapting to the refereeing in NZ to teach his players how to turn the officiating to their advantage.\n\n“They do the best job of utilising the nature of the refereeing. He gets credit for developing that, among many other things.”\n\nSo what is the nature of NBL refereeing in New Zealand?\n\n“They have a lot of room to improve,” said Coronel, revealing Giants forward Mika Vukona, who reportedly has designs on becoming Nelson player/assistant coach, had asked Hawks Australian import centre Angus Brandt how he was finding the NBL.\n\n“He [Vukona] knew what the answer would be because it’s difficult to adjust to a country where it’s been the story of people coming here from other countries for almost 40 years and it continues to be that way,” Coronel said, adding YouTube videos lent credence to that assertion.\n\n“For Jamie to come in this year and understand it, you know, is a great finishing job on his part.”\n\nHe said every other NBL mentor needed to look at how they coached and to take a leaf out of Pearlman’s book to work on issues.\n\nPut another way, Coronel said coaches needed to look at how they could develop the game based on the way it was stipulated in the rule books or try to understand how the officials interpreted the rules and their ability to enforce them.\n\nThe Hawks could not back up their character-defining 91-76 win over the Wheeler Motor Canterbury Rams in Christchurch on Friday, losing the first three quarters 21-10, 30-19 and 27-23, respectively. The visitors won the final spell 26-23 but the hosts had the points well and truly in the bag and were under no pressure to contest anything.\n\nThe turning point in the game was when the officials called a technical foul on Brandt in the second quarter to rob him of further play in the remaining minutes that spell.\n\nCoronel felt the Hawks just weren’t good enough rebounding or defensively, which resulted in a blowout that gifted the Giants the luxury of going to their bench.\n\n“We didn’t roll over and we competed much harder, which added a bit more respectability to the scoreline, but, ultimately, not a close game.”\n\nThe Hawks had a lot of good looks in the first quarter but didn’t find much love from the rim. Coronel suspected that might have been the product of heavy legs from a double header on the road.\n\n“They shot the ball very well. That is expected because they had looks where you’d expect them to shoot the ball at a good percentage.”\n\nCoronel heaped praise on his captain, Jarrod Kenny, on the grounds that the point guard had played consistently this season regardless of whether the Hawks won or lost.\n\nThat was a reflection of Kenny’s experience because he wasn’t just some confidence player but someone who had mental fortitude, the coach said.\n\nWhile Vukona made only a cameo appearance, Coronel said the Tall Blacks captain’s presence and contribution through leadership should not be underestimated.\n\nThe return from injury of Finn Delany, one of the outstanding players in the NBL, had a huge impact on how the hosts had functioned.\n\n“I guess we had three imports the last time we played them so we’re not quite at the same strength we were at then.”\n\nCoronel felt the Hawks had won the important game of the double headers against a quality Rams who had lost only one game before the tip off.\n\nHowever, with five teams in contention for the final four playoffs it was imperative for the Hawks to remain on track.\n\n■ Result: Giants 101 (Kyle Adnam 23pts, 6 asts; Damon Heuir 18pts, 5 reb, 5 asts; Finn Delany 17pts, 8 reb) Hawks 78 (Angus Brandt 20pts; Ethan Rusbatch 16pts, 6 reb; Hyrum Harris 14pts, 6reb, 3 blks; Jarrod Kenny 11pts, 11 asts, 6 reb).\n\nBy Anendra Singh\n\n-NZHerald\n\nThe result was never a done deal but the hosts pulling out the knuckle dusters in the octane-fuelled lanes of contention was always a given in Christchurch tonight.\n\nThat’s because the Wheeler Motor Canterbury Rams coach Mark Dickel, a former Tall Black point guard, didn’t take prisoners in his playing days and wouldn’t have any qualms about his troops questioning the pedigree of any opposition players coming to Cowles Stadium to think they could simply roll up and walk away with two points.\n\nTo their credit, Taylor Corporation Hawks didn’t take a step back last night in their 91-76 victory in week six of the Sal’s National Basketball League (NBL) match.\n\nIt probably didn’t help that homeboy Ethan Rusbatch now preens his feathers with the Hawks but, needless to say, the skirmish didn’t overshadow the proceedings as the Hawks have a chance to leapfrog the hosts on the table to find their perch among the top four again from fifth place.\n\nHawks coach Zico Coronel said Tall Black Rusbatch, who scored 22 points and made nine assists, had an army of loyal fans behind him after the second-half dust up.\n\n“I guess when you have shared many moments together, positive and negative, then you really form a bond with that person so I guess they are two people you don’t want to lose to as their friends or their enemies.\n\n“You’ll have to ask Ethan which one he considers which one but he very much didn’t want to lose tonight. He is really a champion person,” said Coronel who met Rusbatch’s mother, Sharon, of Christchurch, and was delighted to impress on her the swingman was always a gifted player but the Bay franchise signed him because he was a good human.\n\nOkay that was cryptic but, loosely translated, it meant Cowles Stadium is the Rams’ house but Rusbatch also knows where the dirty linens are kept and had every intention of chucking them into the spindry cycle in the laundry.\n\nRusbatch’s professionalism was something Taranaki coach Trent Adams had impressed on Coronel in 2014.\n\n“I think that he’s such a quality human being that the boys rally around him to make sure he got a win so that’s probably where a little bit of the feelings came from.”\n\nThe 25-year-old Gold Coast Commonwealth Games bronze medallist had life-long friends who were prepared to sacrifice their Friday night to support him, which also was a testimony to his character.\n\nCoronel said the Rams had got “a little bit sulky”, which was something they needed to be if they were going to change the nature of the game.\n\n“It was another thing for us to be proud of because it could have gone one of two ways in terms of losing the plot or glavanising us.\n\n“Our focus was very good, we were united and we didn’t get distracted when they came with their runs because we were able to minimise it as much as possible to maintain the lead into the beginning of the fourth quarter.”\n\nHe felt it was a vital clash to define the parameters of the Final Four playoffs so no love was going to be lost on either side.\n\nCoronel said it always felt like captain Jarrod Kenny and his men had taken ownership despite Rams import Julian Williams-Washburn claiming a match-high 24 points, dropping five out of six shots from downtown.\n\n“He was shooting the ball very well and we knew he could,” he said of the forward coming off a season with Austin Spurrs in the United States.\n\nCoronel also lauded a toiling Rams import Winston Shepard III who scored 18 points, took nine rebounds, eight assists and four steals.\n\n“He was probably the danger and threat and had his moments but I guess we kept him in check,” he said.\n\nWith the Rams falling into foul trouble and the Hawks putting up the shutters, the hosts were toast.\n\nHe singled out Kenny and swingman Dion Prewster for having the number of Xavier Thames, who settled for a quiet night, although the Hawks coach expected him to come back stronger the next time.\n\nIt pleased him immensely that the Hawks had kept a leash on the Cantabrians in every quarter bar the third, below the 20 threshold. That was because of an intense defence drill on Tuesday.\n\nKenny had another strong game with 18 points, which included 100 per cent rate of four three pointers, and Angus Brandt added 20 to the collective. Prewster chimed in with 13 points and US import power forward Jamie Skeen contributed nine.\n\nThe Hawks, who move to five wins and three losses, play the Mike Pero Nelson Giants in a 7pm tipoff at Trafalgar Centre tomorrow night.\n\nCoronel said while the Hawks had lost two games in a row they had to be put in perspective because they were against last year’s finalists.\n\nWhile the Hawks weren’t good enough to beat the teams on those nights, he said it was vital to note a lot of their tough games were bracketed in the front end of the season.\n\n“Those are games that most teams have lost to the [Cigna Wellington] Saints and the [SIT Zerofees Southland] Sharks on the road but, maybe, haven’t played them yet or just one of them, not three.”\n\nTonight’s victory gave the Hawks the licence to clarify that assertion.\n\nHe said the Giants will be tough tomorrow night with outgoing former New Zealand Breakers hardman and Tall Black captain Mika Vukona back in the equation.\n\n“He wasn’t intending to play to play but I think it’s the measure of the importance of this game looking at the playoffs.”\n\nHaving beaten them last month, Coronel said locking horns with the Giants again tomorrow was a good test as a double header because, after all, the Final Four playoffs was also of that ilk.\n\n“The last time they were on the night of a back-to-back [match] but this time they’ve been laying in wait.”\n\nHe said it wasn’t just about energy and recovery but also about time so the Hawks support staff were doing the ground work.\n\nIn the other game, the Sharks had a comfortable 92-71 victory over the Augusta Taranaki Mountainairs in Invercargill tonight.\n\nResult: Rams 76 (Julian Williams-Washburn 24 pts, 6 reb; Winston Shepard III 18 pts, 9 reb, 8 asts; Maxwell Darling 11 pts) Hawks 91 (Ethan Rusbatch 22 pts, 9 asts; Angus Brandt 20 pts, 6 reb; Jarrod Kenny 18 pts, 6 reb, 7 asts; Dion Prewster 13 pts, 6 reb; 4 asts; Jamie Skeen 9 pts, 2 blks).\n\nQuarters (Rams first), 1st: 18-24. 2nd: 35-43 (17-22). 3rd: 45-47 (28-25). Final: 76-91 (13-23).\n\nBy: Anendra Singh\n\n-NZHerald\n\nThe score and the statistics go a long way in showing how close the game was and Hawks coach Zico Coronel wholeheartedly agreed with that tonight.\n\nBut don’t ever mistake Coronel’s dulcet, measured tone for contentment after Cigna Saints pipped the Taylor Corporation-sponsored Hawke’s Bay franchise team 80-77 in week five of the Sal’s National Basketball League (NBL) match in Wellington yesterday.\n\n“No, not content. We have high expectations of ourselves so to just come and lose to anybody … yes, Saints are a good team but no, we’re not content with that.”\n\nThat is not to say he didn’t think the Jarrod Kenny-captained outfit wouldn’t take something away from any encounter.\n\nIt was the visitors’ second loss on the trot and their third in the campaign while the hosts carved up their fifth consecutive win after one loss. Saints had their measure 93-85 at the TSB Arena a fortnight ago but the Hawks will have a chance to redeem themselves when they reload at the Pettigrew-Green Arena, Napier, on Sunday, June 10, in a 3pm tip off after playing The Wheeler Motor Canterbury Rams at Cowles Stadium, Christchurch, in a 7pm start this Friday and the Mike Pero Nelson Giants at the same time the following night at Trafalgar Centre in a double header.\n\nCoronel said it hardly mattered whether a team lost by a sliver or, as they did to the SIT Zerofees Southland Sharks in Invercargill the previous Saturday, by a yawning 30-point margin.\n\n“There’s no way you can play the perfect game because there’s always things to improve on,” he said, mindful a side could savour championship glory on imperfections with a finite time invested in players.\n\nCoronel said he and Go Media Manawatu Jets coach Tim McTamney were going through the score ratings in the NBL on Saturday and how high they were and removed from the other leagues in the world.\n\n“There’s very little defence played in our league so this game [v Saints] was a complete contrast – very low scoring, very grinding and much more like a playoff game than any other game probably played in our league so far this year.”\n\nSaints point guard Shea Ili, who claimed a game-high 27 points, again proved to be the Hawks’ nemesis.\n\nLJ Peak scored 19 points while Majok Majok added a double-double 13 points and 15 rebounds to the Saints’ cause.\n\nHawks’ Boomer centre, Angus Brandt, emulated Majok’s feat with 19 points and 13 off the glass while Tall Black Ethan Rusbatch scored 18. Point guard Kenny gleaned 14 points and veteran shooting guard Everard Bartlett added 11 off the bench.\n\nThe intensity of the match saw him and Saints coach Kevin Braswell use key players for a lion’s share of the game because of its playoff nature. BJ Anthony (Saints) got 5:44 minutes while Hawks veteran Kareem Johnson didn’t come off the bench at all.\n\n“The runs from this game were pretty small. Both teams’ longest scoring run was nine points so it was very close and if anyone would have had a significant one it would have been the game.”\n\nThe Saints had rolled out Anthony, on a plus/minus one, which was deceptive but the last time the Hawks were able to exploit him and that might have been on the minds of Braswell and Co.\n\nSo how do you put a leash on Ili?\n\n“That is going to be the story for them [Saints],” Coronel said, revealing both sides were struggling to score at the start of the third quarter.\n\n“We’re talking about someone who, about four years ago, was playing for a bad Rangers team as a back-up guard where you would literally guard him in the key and he would bail them out.\n\n“You could simply say they [Saints] had Shea Ili and we didn’t.”\n\nHe lauded the New Zealand Breakers player for taking something that was a weakness, that is shooting, for him and turning it into a weapon.\n\n“He is beginning to reap the rewards of that work by being a winner more often than not. He’s going to be the MVP of our league because he proves that night after night.\n\n“We try to minimise him more than most because he’s been averaging nine and half free throws a game,” he said, backing it up with other miserly statistics that backed up his claims.\n\nCoronel said he didn’t expect individuals to boost their deposits in Hawks’ bank because it was unreasonable for players to do that every game.\n\nFor example, Hawks swingman Dion Prewster managed seven points in 28:47 minutes but he felt as long as he was aggressive his teammates would rally around him.\n\n“We’ll have your back, make or miss as long as you make the right decisions,” he said.\n\nDitto US import power forward Jamie Skeen who, in 32:40 minutes, made only two points and took three rebounds after scoring 29 in the sides’ encounter.\n\nCoronel felt the hosts would have made Skeen a special part of their preparation yesterday with Saints captain Leon Henry would have taken exception to their last match up and ensuring there was no repeat yesterday.\n\nThe American, who hobbled off with an ankle injury, had shot a basket from six attempts but the coach felt it wasn’t enough to gauge his worth on such lean pickings.\n\nCoronel had no qualms about playing a double header next on the proviso that the court dimensions would remain the same.\n\n“Ultimately we will have to win on the road so it’s a great challenge for us. You probably couldn’t design a harder stretch of games in our league than the one we’re in the midst of now.”\n\nStaying unified and optimistic with a penchant for learning was his edict to capitalise before facing the table-topping, one-loss Rams first up.\n\n“They pose a significant challenge and their three imports are first, second and third in the league in minutes so they have been very productive.\n\n“However, the story of their season is young Maxwell Darling, who is 17 years old, who has probably been the key because they were perceptively going to be lacking in Kiwi talent.”\n\nLearning about Canterbury in an attempt to be better than the hosts would be on the agenda, he said.\n\nCigna Saints 80 (Shea Ili 27pts, 4 reb, 4 assts; LJ Peak 19pts; Majok Majok 13, 11reb) Taylor Corporation Hawks 77 (Angus Brandt 19pts, 13reb; Ethan Rusbatch 18pts, 4reb; Jarrod Kenny 14pts, 5reb, 3 assts; Everard Bartlett 11pts).\n\nQuarters (Saints first), 1st: 14-20. 2nd: 38-40 (24-20). 3rd: 54-53 (16-13). Final: 80-77 (26-24).\n\nBy: Anendra Singh\n\n-NZHerald\n\nMitch Newton, by his own admission, was a late bloomer in elite basketball but that does not mean he’s running late in the high-octane lanes of contention.\n\nOh no, it simply means Newton is only just getting started while everyone else has been charging full steam ahead.\n\n“I did start playing when I was like 15 but even then, I was pretty average,” says the 22-year-old from Gore as the Taylor Corporation Hawks prepare to tip off against defending champions Cigna Saints in their round five Sal’s National Basketball League (NBL) match at the TSB Bank Arena in Wellington in a 3pm tip off tomorrow.\n\n“I did try but I just didn’t make the Southland under-17s and they had a B team and I just didn’t make it either, so I wasn’t that good.”\n\nBut the genes kicked in in 2012 for the year 12 pupil who had enjoyed a growth spurt so “I grew into my body a bit more, I guess”.\n\nIt’s that sort of patience, on the platform of hard work, that has slowly but surely hardened his template in the NBL.\n\nThe Saints and Hawks are reloading at the same venue after the Saints won 93-85 a fortnight ago, bearing in mind it’s hard enough to beat the perennial champions anywhere.\n\nHowever, the hosts didn’t have it easy in the previous encounter, having to reel in the Hawks 28-15 in the final quarter. They found the Hawks’ latest import signing, power forward Jamie Skeen, a handful as he racked up 29 points.\n\nWellington have bullied the Hawks as of late, winning the past eight games and proudly wearing the badge of honour in not having conceded a match on home turf since 2011.\n\nBut Newton hastens to add playing them at TSB Arena again need not be a bad thing as the Hawks look for a rash of games at the back end of the season at the Pettigrew-Green Arena, Taradale.\n\nBy: Anendra Singh\n\n-NZHerald"
