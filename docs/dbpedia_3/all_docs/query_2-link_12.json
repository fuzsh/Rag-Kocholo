        "text": "AUCKLAND (NBL) - As torrid as the battle for home advantage has been on the court, the struggle to secure NBL semifinal venues has been just as intense away from it.\n\nSimply, none of the top four teams have been able to secure bookings for their regular stadiums throughout the playoffs, which means administrators have had to think outside the square in planning crucial post-season fixtures.\n\n\"It seems to be a problem the league faces every season about this time and we haven't quite found the solution to it,\" observes NBL general manager Michael Bennington, who faced the predicament previously as GM of St Laurence Wellington Saints.\n\nOnly NBS Nelson Giants have their preferred venue - the Trafalgar Centre - for the first semifinal on Saturday, July 1. Auckland may be able to \"borrow\" the North Shore Events Centre as an alternative to their regular haunt, ASB Stadium and, if needed, Saints would have to use their designated backup, Walter Nash Stadium in Lower Hutt.\n\nEasy LPG Bay Hawks have nowhere to host a game that day.\n\nAll teams can host the second semi on July 2, but again, Auckland would have to use the NSEC.\n\nA complicating factor for the Hawks would be the availability of captain and MVP candidate Paora Winitana, who does not play Sundays for religious reasons. If they are to host a semi at Pettigrew Green Arena, it will be without him.\n\nBy contrast, the Hawks are the only team that can currently host the final on Saturday, July 8. NSEC is again a possibility for the Stars, but it is also scheduled to host the national U17 championships that weekend.\n\nIf the Hawks are beaten in the semis and the NSEC remains unavailable ... well, that's where things get really interesting.\n\nWorst case scenario, a neutral venue may be called into play.\n\n\"The situation looks complicated right now, but a lot still depends on how the final round of games goes,\" says Bennington. \"We'll reassess things after those results are known.\"\n\nThree possible semifinal scenarios remain ...\n\n* If Auckland beat Hawks on Friday and Hawks beat Appliance Shed Harbour Heat on Saturday, final placings will remain as they stand and the semis will see Stars host Saints, Hawks host Giants. This would also apply if Hawks beat Auckland, but lose to Harbour, or if they lose both games and Nelson lose to Otago.\n\n* If Hawks win both games, they will win the regular season title and the semis will see Hawks host Saints, Stars host Giants.\n\n* If Hawks lose both games and Nelson beat Otago on Saturday, the Gaints will sneak into second and the semis will see Stars host Saints, Giants host Hawks.\n\nAfter all the hand-wringing, it's probably worth wondering whether the anxiety is worth it, as there seems little actual on-court advantage to be gained from hosting in the post season.\n\nOver the past five years, home teams have achieved a paltry 50% (8/16) success rate in the NBL playoffs. That return is an even less impressive 28.6% (2/7) in the past two seasons.\n\nMoreover, the last four titles have all been won on the road - Waikato in Nelson in 2002, Wellington in Hamilton 2003, Auckland in Nelson 2004 and Auckland in Napier last year.\n\nNational Basketball League (Week 13 games)\n\nNZCT Taranaki Mountain Airs v Canterbury Rams\n\nGI Juice Auckland Stars v Easy LPG Bay Hawks\n\nOtago Nuggets v NBS Nelson Giants\n\nAppliance Shed Harbour Heat v Easy LPG Bay Hawks\n\nWaikato Pistons v NZCT Taranaki Mountain Airs\n\nSt Laurence Wellington Saints v Scenic Circle Canterbury Rams"
