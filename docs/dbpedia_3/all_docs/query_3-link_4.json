        "text": "2024 Sal’s NBL Champions: Canterbury Rams\n\nIn front of a packed house at Cowles Stadium, Wheeler Motor Company Canterbury Rams made it back-to back Sal’s NBL Championships with a 102-87 victory over Auckland Tuatara.\n\nHaving previously endured a 31-year wait the Rams have now won titles in successive years although this, the club’s sixth NBL championship, will rank as extra special having been played in front of the Canterbury faithful.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2023 final when the Rams prevailed 93-82 this year’s championship game was also decided in the final five minutes.\n\nWhen Tuatara guard Corey Webster made a fade-away jumper the Tuatara trailed by just 5 points (86-81) and a late charge was on the cards.\n\nHowever from there, despite a couple of Tom Vodanovich scores it was all Canterbury as, in front of an increasingly delirious crowd, they polished off the challengers with a 16-6 blitz in the closing minutes.\n\nGrand Final MVP Lachlan Olbrich was once again a standout for the Rams. The 20-year old Australian centre backed up his semi-final haul of 22 points and 16 rebounds and 6 assists to record an even bigger double-double of 29 points and 18 rebounds with another 6 assists and was naturally delighted when interviewed after the game.\n\n“It’s fantastic, I’m stoked. It’s such a great group of guys to play with – we deserve it every one of us.\n\n“So much work has gone in, every training Judd (Flavell) has us going, pushing each other and that’s how we got here. I guarantee amongst every team in this league we work the hardest – it’s a great group.”\n\nRams Head Coach Judd Flavell praised the contribution Olbrich had made.\n\n“I’ve said it before, over the last few weeks, when there has been talk about him. He had a difficult situation to come back to (after a family tragedy) when leaving family.\n\n“He has the world in front of him. As good a player as he is on the floor he’s an even better human being. We run a lot of our stuff through him and he’s a tough match up for people.\n\n“We’ll be in his corner moving forward but he’s a special kid.”\n\nFlavell also had praise for Rams captain Taylor Britt who tallied 11 points and 8 assists.\n\n“He’s been the leader the whole season. Since I got down here a couple of years ago his confidence, ability and self-belief has grown and that has transferred into the team.\n\n“We go whenever Taylor goes and I think he drives this vehicle as well as anyone in the league.”\n\nIn addition to Olbrich and Britt the American duo of Kenyon Buffen Jr and James Walker Jr played major roles, finishing with 21 points and 11 respectively.\n\nWalter Brown finished with 10 points and 7 rebounds and now has the distinction of winning three championships in 12 months. Either side of the Rams titles he was also a member of the Tasmanian Jack Jumpers team that claimed the 2023-24 Australian NBL title.\n\nIt wasn’t to be for the Tuatara as they were consigned to a third straight Grand-Final loss. Tom Vodanovich led the way for the Aucklander’s with 20 points, Corey Webster had 19 points and 8 assists, Cam Gliddon 13 and Charlie Dalton 12.\n\nRob Loe scored 17 points to go with 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocks but when the former Tall Black fouled out early in the final term the Tuatara’s chances took a term for the worse.\n\nWebster had made the opening basket of the contest before Olbrich and Buffen Jr scored 7 points each as the reigning champions closed the opening quarter 27-18 ahead.\n\nWhen Kaia Isaac became the fifth Ram to make a triple the home side had a 37-25 lead and the Tuatara needed a timeout 3:30 into the second period.\n\nThe response came in the form of triples – twice from Dalton and once from Webster – as the Rams advantage was trimmed to 41-34.\n\nThe closing stages of the first half became something of an individual dual between 2024 MVP Olbrich and previous season’s MVP Loe.\n\nThat contest was pretty even as was the overall score – Tuatara ahead 51-50 ahead at the interval.\n\nThe Tuatara scored the first 6 points of the third but when Buffen Jnr drained his third shot from beyond the arc the Rams had bounced back into the lead.\n\nWorse was to follow for the Tuatara as Loe was forced to the bench after picking up a fourth foul. With the Defensive Player of the Year missing the Rams took advantage – closing the period with a 75-69 lead.\n\nOne of the biggest cheers of the night from the partisan crowd came 73 seconds into the final quarter when Loe exited the game after picking up his fifth foul. The Rams led 80-75 at that stage but the Tuatara weren’t finished as they closed to 81-79 after a Dalton put back.\n\nHowever from there, to the delight of the home supporters, the Rams charged to the finishing line – a brace of Walker Jr triples putting the finishing touches to the triumph.\n\nFor NBL Coach of the Year Judd Flavell it’s a fourth championship following successful campaigns with Auckland Pirates (2012), Southland Sharks (2018) and the Rams in the past two years.\n\nFlavell was full of praise for the Rams front office support.\n\n“Leadership always starts at the top. It’s a great organisation with a great culture led by the Harrison family who have been instrumental in the Rams over the years.\n\n“They play a massive role down here not just with the Rams but also the Pouākai, the Eagles programme and the whole Canterbury basketball scene is in a fantastic place, I think it is a great model. But it starts with those guys and we are just reaping the rewards.”\n\nThe Tuatara finish the season with the disappointment of another grand final defeat and the unenviable record of being the first club in the 43-year history of the NBL to have lost three straight championship games.\n\nResult: Canterbury Rams (102) defeated Auckland Tuatara (87)\n\nLeading Players:\n\nRams 102: Olbrich 29pts & 18rebs, Buffen Jnr 21pts, Britt 13pts & 8 assists, Walker Jr 11pts, Brown Jr 10pts, K Isaac 9pts, Darling 9pts\n\nTuatara 78: Vodanovich 20pts, Webster 19pts & 8assists, Loe 17pts, Gliddon 13pts, Dalton 10pts\n\nFull List of Sal’s NBL Award Winners:\n\nMVP – Lachlan Olbrich (Rams)\n\nDefensive Player of the Year – Rob Loe (Tuatara)\n\nYouth Player of the Year – Lachlan Olbrich (Rams)\n\nMost Improved Player – Taylor Britt (Rams)\n\nAll Star Five – Rob Loe (Tuatara), Lachlan Olbrich (Rams), Luther Muhammad (Bulls), Taylor Britt (Rams), Isaiah Moore (Hawks)\n\nSteve McKean Coach of the Year – Judd Flavell (Rams)\n\nHistoric Awards\n\nMost Outstanding Guard (Keith Carr Trophy) – Luther Muhammad (Bulls)\n\nMost Outstanding NZ Guard (John Macdonald Trophy) – Taylor Britt (Rams)\n\nMost Outstanding Forward (Commissioners Cup) – Lachlan Olbrich (Rams)\n\nMost Outstanding NZ Forward/Centre (Stan Hill Trophy) – Rob Loe (Tuatara)\n\nScoring Champion (Alan Bland Memorial Trophy) – Luther Muhammad (Bulls)\n\nRebounding Champion (Garry Pettis Memorial Trophy) – Josh Roberts (Hawks)\n\nAssist Champion (Dave Taylor Trophy) – Corey Webster (Tuatara)\n\nBest Team Free Throws (Nial Forsyth Trophy) – Taranaki Airs\n\nReferee of the Year – Callum Welch\n\nSky Broadband Rapid League Award Winners\n\nRapid League MVP – Kaia Isaac (Rams)\n\nRapid League All-Star Five – Kazlo Evans Jr. (Saints), Kaia Isaac (Rams), Nick Davidson (Giants), Hayden Jones (Giants), Josh Aitcheson (Nuggets)\n\nSal’s NBL Media Awards\n\nClub of the Year- Wheeler Motor Company Canterbury Rams\n\nGeneral Manager of the Year- Jordan Mills Mills Albert Wellington Saints\n\nBest Fan Engagement– Auckland Tuatara\n\nBest Social Media- NBS Nelson Giants\n\nBest Game Presentation– Taranaki Steelformers Airs\n\nVideo Content Creator of the Year – Danielle Eagle- NBS Nelson Giants\n\nBest Media Coverage– Southland Times/Stuff\n\nJournalist of the Year- Adrian Seconi (Otago Daily Times)\n\nPhoto of the Year – Richard Connelly – GameFaceNZ- Taylor Britt Fadeaway\n\nBest Digital Team Creative- Mills Albert Wellington Saints – Sharks Game Day – Paddy Martin Design\n\n2023 Sal’s NBL Champions: Canterbury Rams\n\nPhoto credit: Render Creative NZ\n\nIn a night filled with highlight plays and superlative efforts, the Champion Wheeler Motor Company Rams electrified the crowd and etched their names in the annals of New Zealand basketball history.\n\nWith a gripping 93-82 victory over the Auckland Tuatara, the Rams broke a 31-year title drought and emerged as the undisputed champions of the 2023 Sal’s NBL season.\n\nThe Rams’ triumphant journey to the title was defined by exceptional performances from both seasoned veterans and rising stars. Led by the dynamic duo of Corey Webster and Finals MVP Tevin Brown, the Rams exhibited unmatched prowess on both ends of the court.\n\nCorey Webster’s outstanding 25-point display, complemented by seven assists and four rebounds, showcased his Tall Blacks’ seasoned skills as a creator and shooter.\n\nMeanwhile, Tevin Brown was electric with his performance of 23 points and 12 rebounds, the highest total in the game, and five assists in a dominant second half performance.\n\nThe Rams’ talented roster proved their depth once again, with impressive contributions from Walter Brown, who demonstrated his two-way versatility with 10 points and nine rebounds and pesky defence on the ball and at the rim.\n\nAmerican forward Troy Baxter Jr. added a 17 crucial, and often timely, points off the bench, further solidifying the Rams attack with his athleticism.\n\nCoach Judd Flavell, who has now secured his third NBL title, spoke of the significance of this win.\n\n“This one is special. For a club who’s been a great part of this league for a very long time, it’s been a long time coming for them,” Flavell said.\n\nHe highlighted the Rams’ youthful lineup, with most players born after the team’s last championship victory in 1992.\n\nThe Rams’ exceptional season culminated in a remarkable comeback in the fourth quarter of the final, showcasing their resilience and ability to thrive under pressure.\n\nFor the Tuatara, this loss was undoubtedly disappointing, having come up short of the finish line in the title game for the second year in a row. Despite their benchmark season, finishing with a top of the table 13-5 record, they were unable to stop the Rams in their push down the stretch in the title-winning match.\n\nReuben Te Rangi’s offence was on full display for the Tuatara, with 16 points in the first half alone. Te Rangi’s driving layups and 3-point shooting posed challenges for the Rams’ defence ending the night with 27 points.\n\nRegular season MVP Rob Loe hauled in 11 rebounds and dished seven assists.\n\nWith the 2023 Sal’s NBL season coming to a close, the Canterbury region rejoices in the Rams’ well-deserved victory as they bring the trophy back to Cowles Stadium.\n\nFull List of 2023 Award Winners:\n\nMVP – Rob Loe (Tuatara)\n\nDefensive Player of the Year – Rob Loe (Tuatara)\n\nYouth Player of the Year – Walter Brown (Rams)\n\nMost Improved Player – Charlie Dalton (Tuatara)\n\nAll Star Five – Jeremy Kendle (Sharks), Jarrad Weeks (Tuatara), Tevin Brown (Rams), Todd Withers (Nuggets), Rob Loe (Tuatara)\n\nSteve McKean Coach of the Year – To be Announced on Hoop Heads\n\nHistoric Awards\n\nMost Outstanding Guard (Keith Carr Trophy) – Jarrad Weeks (Tuatara)\n\nMost Outstanding NZ Guard (John Macdonald Trophy) – Derone Raukawa (Hawks)\n\nMost Outstanding Forward (Commissioners Cup) – Rob Loe (Tuatara)\n\nMost Outstanding NZ Forward/Centre (Stan Hill Trophy) – Rob Loe (Tuatara)\n\nScoring Champion (Alan Bland Memorial Trophy) – Jeremy Kendle (Sharks)\n\nRebounding Champion (Garry Pettis Memorial Trophy) – Rob Loe (Tuatara)\n\nAssist Champion (Dave Taylor Trophy) – Jeremy Kendle (Sharks)\n\nBest Team Free Throws (Nial Forsyth Trophy) – Manawatu Jets\n\nClub Awards\n\nTeam GM of the Year – Angela Ruske (Otago Nuggets)\n\nClub of the Year – Otago Nuggets\n\nBest Game Presentation – Wellington Saints\n\nBest Fan Engagement – Manawatu Jets\n\nBest Social Media – Nelson Giants\n\nOfficials Awards\n\nReferee of the Year – Callum Welch"
