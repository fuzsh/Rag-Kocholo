ADELAIDE 36ers recruit Paora Winitana flew into town and straight into action with his new team.

The 195cm off-guard small forward joined team-mates and 36ers coach Scott Ninnis for a clinic at Westminster College and will have his first official training session with the team.

Winitana was a foundation member of the New Zealand Breakers in 2003-04 before dropping out of the NBL to spend time with his wife and son.

He was the NZ league's MVP with the Hawkes Bay Hawks in 2006 before returning to NBL to help the Breakers reach the play-offs for the first time in 2007-08.

He will add defensive intensity to the 36ers squad.

Ninnis said that intensity would be invaluable to the team.

"He's got the versatility to be able to defend a number of different positions on floor," he said.

"That will be one of the big pluses with Paora.

"He's the sort of guy you can just throw on to someone with complete confidence that he's going to make life very difficult for them."

A bishop with the Church of Jesus Christ - Later Day Saints, Winitana does not play or train on Sunday's for religious reasons.

However, he could miss as few as just one game in season 2008-09 depending on the draw, which is yet to be finalised because of the withdrawal of the Singapore Slingers on Wednesday.

While Winitana's NBL experience is limited, he has extensive international experience with the Tall Blacks and won a Commonwealth Games silver medal with the NZ national team in 2006.

Not fazed by Adelaide's winter weather, Winitana said he hoped to help the 36ers to success this season.

"Everybody's been saying how cold it is in Adelaide but if this is a cold day then I'm going to really enjoy it here," he said.

"We want to win, we want to be successful. Obviously we want to make the play-offs and go deep into the play-offs.

"I'm looking forward to helping out defensively and bringing that sort of presence to the team."
