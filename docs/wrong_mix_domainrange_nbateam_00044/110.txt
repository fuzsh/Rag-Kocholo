LOS ANGELES -- In a bit of good news on the Cavaliers' injury front, Kyle Korver (right foot bruise) will play against the Los Angeles Lakers Sunday, coach Tyronn Lue said.

The Cavs are already missing Cedi Osman (left hip flexor strain), Rodney Hood (lower back strain), Kevin Love (broken bone in hand), and Tristan Thompson.

Lue said John Holland, one of the Cavs' "two way" players (which means he spends about half the time in Canton on the G League team but doesn't count against the Cavs' 15-man roster), will get real time against the Lakers.

Holland is averaging 18.7 points in the G League this season.

"Not sure how much but he's gonna have to play and we've got confidence in him," Lue said. "Young, good player and this will give him a chance to play tonight so I'm excited for him."

Jeff Green is going to start at small forward and LeBron James will play power forward. The Cavs have only Larry Nance Jr. and rookie Ante Zizic as traditional bigs. The Clippers took advantage of that combo Friday with 25 second-chance points.

"If we're small, I don't see how," the Cavs can solve that problem, Lue said. "We just gotta continue to keep boxing out and we gotta gang rebound. All five guys gotta help rebound, no leakouts and help Larry and Big Z around the basket, along with Jeff and Bron, who's playing the four."
