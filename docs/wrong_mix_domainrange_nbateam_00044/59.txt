Atlanta Hawks shooting guard Kyle Korver has been named as Eastern Conference All-Star as a commissioner's replacement for Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade, the league announced.

The Hawks, who have the best record in the East, will have four of the East's 12 All-Star: Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and and Korver.

Korver, one of the most meticulous shooters in the NBA, is having his best season and is the league's most accurate three-point shooter. He leads the league in three-point percentage (.528) and prior to Tuesday's games, Korver leads the league in three-pointers made (160), one ahead of Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry.

Korver is trying to become the first player in NBA history to shoot at least 50% from the field, 50% on three-pointers and 90% on free throws in the minimum qualified attempts required.

Korver will also participate in the three-point shootout along with Curry, Golden State's Klay Thompson, San Antonio's Marco Belinelli, Houston's James Harden, Cleveland's Kyrie Irving, Portland's Wesley Matthews and Los Angeles Clippers' J.J. Redick in one of the most anticipated events of All-Star Saturday.

Wade, who has a strained right hamstring, hasn't played since Jan. 27.
