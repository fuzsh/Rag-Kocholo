        "text": "It already looked unlikely but Los Angeles Lakers fans can officially cross sharpshooting veteran Kyle Korver off their list of preferred players to take the 15th and final roster spot.\n\nESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Saturday that the Milwaukee Bucks and Kyle Korver have agreed on a deal for next season.\n\nThe Lakers currently have 14 players on their roster, as well as one two-way player. To sign another player to their roster, they would essentially lock their opening day roster in before training camp starts.\n\nNow that Korver is officially off the market, the Lakers can elect to keep that roster spot open in case something changes between now and the start of the season.\n\nThe other option they could go to is circling back around to LeBron’s former Cavs teammate J.R. Smith, or other veterans such as Carmelo Anthony or Jamal Crawford.\n\nOutside of LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers have prioritized 3-point shooting while also scoring minimum deals with Rajon Rondo and DeMarcus Cousins."
