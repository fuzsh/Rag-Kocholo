        "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers have made their re-signing of Kyle Korver official. In a press release sent out Wednesday night, Korver’s return was confirmed by the team. He was originally linked back to the team on July 2.\n\nThe Cavs gave up a first round pick to acquire Korver and they are too limited financially to replace him, so bringing him back makes sense. And while he did not impact in the Finals, he was overall a productive player with the Cavs. In the first three rounds of the playoffs, teams faceguarded him in an effort to take away any of his shot attempts.\n\nWith the Cavs, he averaged 10.7 points per game while shooting 48.5 percent from three. For the year, he shot 45.1 percent from distance — the best mark in the NBA. It was the fourth time he’s lead the league in three-point percentage."
