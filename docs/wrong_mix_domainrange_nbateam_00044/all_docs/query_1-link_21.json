        "text": "USA Today\n\nAtlanta Hawks star Kyle Korver suffered a broken nose in the second quarter of the Hawks' March 15 game against the Los Angeles Lakers. He is expected to play in Sunday's game against San Antonio.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nKorver Will Start vs. Spurs\n\nSunday, March 22\n\n\"Kyle Korver will play and start today vs. Spurs,\" Chris Vivlamore of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Vivlamore provided a comment from Korver regarding wearing a protective mask:\n\nThe Hawks' Twitter account confirmed on March 16 that Korver would miss the remainder of the team's road trip (three games) after undergoing a procedure to fix his broken nose.\n\nVivlamore provided the details of Korver's injury on March 15. He would not return to the game and stayed in Los Angeles to have his nose examined, per Vivlamore.\n\nMark Medina of the Los Angeles Daily News noted how the Hawks were quite shorthanded once Korver exited the floor at the Staples Center:\n\nVivlamore added that Korver drew an offensive foul on forward Ed Davis on the play he was hurt, so the positive result came at quite a cost.\n\nKorver has managed to stay healthy for much of his exceptional 2014-15 campaign. The hope is that he can wear a protective mask and keep playing down the stretch, because he's extremely close to notching a 50-50-90 shooting season.\n\nThe good news is that Atlanta currently holds a 9.5-game lead over Cleveland for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. It'd take an utter collapse down the stretch to not have home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\nAs long as Korver can still emulate his usual contributions and the Hawks can avoid injuries otherwise, there's no reason they shouldn't clinch the regular-season conference title soon enough."
