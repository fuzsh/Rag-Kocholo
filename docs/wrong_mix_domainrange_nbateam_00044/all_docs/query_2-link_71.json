        "text": "You can cross one name off the list of possible trade targets for the Sixers.\n\nFormer Sixer Kyle Korver has been traded to the Utah Jazz for two second-round picks and guard Alec Burks, per ESPN's Adrian Wojranowski.\n\nKorver is 37 and limited athletically, but he still provides elite three-point shooting. With how little the Sixers have been getting from their bench, Korver would've been a welcome addition.\n\nThere are still plenty of players that could pique the Sixers' interest. Most likely, they'll be targeting help on the wing and players with expiring deals.\n\nOf course with the Wizards possibly blowing things up, there's been speculation that Bradley Beal could be a potential fit with the Sixers. While he'd be a tremendous edition here, the Sixers likely don't have the pieces to make a deal work. More likely, they'll target some of Washington's bench pieces like Markieff Morris, Kelly Oubre Jr. or Jeff Green.\n\nA player like Trevor Ariza would be a perfect fit here. He can provide tough on-ball defense and three-point shooting off the bench. His one year, $15-million deal with the Suns could complicate things. He also can't be moved until Dec. 15 because he was just signed this past offseason.\n\nAnother player with a big, expiring contract they could look into is Wesley Matthews. If the Mavericks are looking into giving some of their younger players more time, Matthews could provide plenty of offense off the Sixers' bench. He's a great shooter and can also create off the dribble a little.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nComplete coverage of the Philadelphia 76ers and their rivals in the NBA from NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nThe Sixers could also look over to the other bench Wednesday night at Courtney Lee. Lee has been sidelined with a neck injury all season but could be a great fit off the Sixers' bench. He's an elite three-point shooter and a solid defender.\n\nLastly, if the team is looking to replace backup center Amir Johnson, former Sixer Dewayne Dedmon deserves a look. Dedmon is just a solid NBA bench big and would represent a pretty sizeable upgrade from Johnson.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
