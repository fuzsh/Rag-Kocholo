        "text": "The Hawks led, 76-54, at the break — their most prolific half of the season. They finished with 42 assists, best in the NBA this season. Jeff Teague led the way with 13.\n\nRudy Gay scored 23 points as the Kings lost their fourth in a row.\n\nThe Hawks hardly missed over the first two quarters, capping a 30-for-48 shooting performance (62.5 percent) with Teague stealing the ball, driving toward the hoop, and somehow banking in a wild shot while Ray McCallum tried to put him in a bear hug.\n\nThe ball dropped through as Teague stumbled out of bounds with 2.6 seconds left, unable to hold back at big smile after his improbable shot. He missed the free throw, but Atlanta still led by 22.\n\nCarroll scored all of his points in the opening half, going 4 of 6 outside the stripe.\n\nThe Hawks eclipsed their previous high for points, 127 in a victory over Cleveland on Dec. 17. The previous high for assists was 41 by the Los Angeles Clippers against Brooklyn on Jan. 22.\n\nWarriors 98, Suns 80 — Stephen Curry scored 25 of his 36 points in the second half as visiting Golden State captured its 50th victory of the season.\n\nKlay Thompson added 25 for the Warriors, who at 50-12 have the NBA’s best record, a half-game better than Atlanta.\n\nCurry made 7 of 13 3-pointers, 6 of 8 in the second half, in his 13th 30-point game of the season.\n\nEric Bledsoe scored 19 for Phoenix. Brandon Knight had 13 before leaving the game with a sprained left ankle in the second quarter. Alex Len had 10 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nNuggets 106, Knicks 78 — Denver’s Kenneth Faried had 19 points and 11 rebounds as visiting New York became the NBA’s first 50-loss team this season.\n\nWilson Chandler and Will Barton scored 17 points apiece for the Nuggets, who enjoyed their largest margin in a win this season.\n\nAlexey Shved had 19 points for New York, which has just seven wins in 2015.\n\nThe margin grew to as much as 34 in the fourth. It was the largest lead of the season for the Nuggets, who tied a season low with eight turnovers. They didn’t have a turnover in the second or third quarter.\n\nPelicans 114, Bucks 103 — Anthony Davis scored 43 points, tying a career high and helping New Orleans pull away for a victory in Milwaukee.\n\nEric Gordon added 16 and Tyreke Evans had 13 before leaving the game in the third quarter with an ankle injury. The Pelicans shot 59 percent for the game and 60 percent from 3-point range.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo had a career-high 29 points for the Bucks, who have lost seven of nine. Michael Carter-Williams tallied 25, his highest-scoring game for Milwaukee since being acquired last month in a trade-deadline deal, and Khris Middleton scored 17.\n\nMilwaukee took a 101-100 lead with 3:35 remaining on a runner by Antetokounmpo. Davis then scored 8 consecutive points as New Orleans closed the game on a 14-2 run.\n\nClippers 89, Timberwolves 76 — J.J. Redick scored 26 points, DeAndre Jordan had 20 points and 17 rebounds, and ailing Los Angeles turned back visiting Minnesota.\n\nAustin Rivers scored 13 points as the Clippers, despite the absences of Blake Griffin and Jamal Crawford, bounced back one day after a road loss to Pacific Division-leading Golden State.\n\nChris Paul also managed just 2 points and 15 assists while playing 29 minutes on a bruised knee.\n\nAdreian Payne had 16 points and 15 rebounds while starting in place of Kevin Garnett for the Timberwolves, who opened a four-game road trip with their fifth loss in six games.\n\nMinnesota has lost 12 straight to the Clippers since February 2012.\n\nWizards 95, Hornets 69 — Marcin Gortat scored 20 points as Washington snapped a nine-game road losing streak.\n\nJohn Wall added 15 points and nine assists and Bradley Beal had 14 points for the Wizards.\n\nGrizzlies 101, Bulls 91 — Marc Gasol scored 23 points to lead visiting Memphis past his brother Pau and Chicago.\n\nGasol, who started opposite his brother at last month’s NBA All-Star game, was 10 of 16 from the field for the Grizzlies.\n\nMemphis moved to two games ahead of idle Houston for the Midwest Division lead.\n\nJeff Green had 19 and Zach Randolph added 16 for the Grizzlies, who improved to 21-11 on the road."
