        "text": "Kyle Korver spent the first 4 1/2 seasons of his career with the Philadelphia 76ers, becoming a fan favorite for his 3-point shooting and scoring off the bench. Ten years have passed since Korver last suited up for Philly, but it seems a return to the 76ers could be something the team is interested in pursuing.\n\nThe Sixers and Cleveland Cavaliers — whom Korver now plays for — have had talks about swapping guards in a deal that would bring Korver back to Philadelphia, writes Keith Pompey of Philly.com. Shortly after news broke of the Sixers being a part of the Carmelo Anthony trade involving the Atlanta Hawks, Pompey reported the news on the potential Korver-Sixers reunion.\n\nAccording to a league source, the team has had discussions about trading Jerryd Bayless to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyle Korver.\n\nThat move would enable the Sixers to bring back a fan favorite who’s one of the league’s top three-point shooters. He would be an upgrade from former Sixer Marco Belinelli, who signed as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs earlier this month.\n\n…\n\nIt’s no secret that the Sixers are looking to trade Bayless. They were trying to buy him out of his contract. The reserve combo guard is set to make $8.57 million in the last season of his contract. Bayless, 29, is not expected to play much — if at all — assuming he remains on the roster. It would be best for both sides if they parted ways.\n\nKorver, 37, will make $7.56 million this season. The swingman will have a salary of $7.5 million next year, but only $3.44 million is guaranteed.\n\nKorver has made 5,130 3-pointers in his career, which ranks him fourth on the NBA’s all-time list in that category. Last season, he ranked sixth in 3-point percentage (43.6 percent) and had led the league in 3-point percentage four times in his career (2009-10, ’13-14, ’14-15, ’16-17). The Sixers drafted Korver with the No. 51 pick in the 2003 Draft and he averaged 10.5 points and shot 40.9 percent in 337 career games with Philadelphia. He was traded to the Utah Jazz on Dec. 29, 2007.\n\nIn the Anthony trade, the Sixers are set to receive big man Mike Muscala from the Hawks. The deal is not expected to be completed for the next 7-10 days, but Muscala’s move to Philadelphia would replace the shooting the Sixers lost when Ersan Ilyasova opted to sign with the Milwaukee Bucks this summer. Muscala has averaged 5.4 points and shot 37.8 percent on 3-pointers in his five NBA seasons."
