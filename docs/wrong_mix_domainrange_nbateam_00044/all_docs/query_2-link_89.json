        "text": "Atlanta Hawks sharpshooter Kyle Korver is close to breaking the record few people are discussing.\n\nKorver has made a three-pointer in 87 consecutive regular-season games and he's two games and two three-pointers shy of tying Dana Barros' record of 89 set in the 1994-95 and 1995-96 seasons.\n\nWhat makes the record-holders relatively unknown also is what makes the record so impressive. If Reggie Miller or Larry Bird — two big names with Hall of Fame careers and long-distance reputations — had the record, more attention would be paid to Korver's streak.\n\nThat they don't have the record makes what Korver has done and is doing special.\n\nOne of the game's best shooters, Korver started his streak Nov. 4, 2012 against the Oklahoma City Thunder, and game by game, he continued to make at least on three — sometimes as many as eight in a game, sometimes as few as one.\n\nKorver can tie Barros with a three-pointer Tuesday against the Orlando Magic and another Wednesday at the Houston Rockets. He can break the record Friday at home against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\n\"I just keep trying to make them. ... I don't think about it a lot unless I get asked about it,\" Korver told news reporters. \"It shows consistency, which you always strive for as a shooter.\"\n\nHawks general manager Danny Ferry and Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer have used SportVu technology to illustrate Korver's ability and hard work. SportVu technology tracks player movement 25 times per second with six cameras attached to arena catwalks.\n\n\"One of the things that is unnoticed is how hard he works when he's on the court to find open spots,\" Ferry told USA TODAY Sports. \"He's in tremendous physical condition. He's a better athlete than people understand. He can really run. That allows him to get to spots and to find openings.\"\n\nSportVu has the data to prove it. Korver is among the league leaders is distance traveled (34.4 miles) and distance traveled per 48 minutes (3.5 miles).\n\n\"There is a high-level of attention the opposing team gives him and he still finds ways to get a shot and make a shot,\" Budenholzer said.\n\nBudenholzer also stressed how strong Korver is on catch-and-shoot threes. Just watching Korver play, he's adept and coming off screens and shooting and sprinting to the three-point line and shooting in one fluid motion.\n\nSportVu data supports that claim, too. Korver is second in catch-and-shoot points with 129 and is fifth in three-point catch-and-shoot percentage (.587) among players who take at least 1.5 catch-and-shoot threes per game.\n\n\"He can get his shot off quickly. He's pretty amazing about how he can be going full speed and rise up into a shot, which is really difficult to do,\" Budenholzer said. \"That ability to go full speed whether it's coming off a screen, a pin-down or in transition and make a shot is a real skill and gift that makes him different than a lot of guys.\"\n\nKorver is such an effective weapon there's no need to deliberately get him good looks so he can continue the streak. He's an integral part of Atlanta's normal offensive flow.\n\n\"We're doing most everything in the normal course of the offense,\" Budenholzer said. \"He's a great shooter, so of course we draw him some plays and get him good, clean looks. But it's really not because of the streak or anything like that.\"\n\nKorver's teammates want him to break the record. Hawks center Al Horford said he thinks about finding Korver at the three-point line after an offensive rebound.\n\n\"We've been very aware of (the record),\" Horford said. \"We know he's going to get his fair amount of looks. He knows he'll get his shots up. He can be so consistent for so long. But he's also not the kind of guy who's getting 10 or 15 shots. There are some games where he gets just five shots. It is very impressive to me what he's doing.\"\n\nKorver is not a volume shooter. He averaged just 8.1 shots per game, five of them three-pointers. This season, Korver has attempted 10 or more shots five times in 14 games.\n\n• During the streak, Korver is shooting 46.9% (226-for-482) on three-pointers.\n\n• Korver has made a three against every team and is shooting better than 40% on threes against 22 teams and better than 50% on three against 13 teams.\n\n• He is 15-for-28 against Charlotte, 10-for-21 against Cleveland, 16-for-34 against Detroit, 10-for-16 against the Los Angeles Lakers, 11-for-21 against Miami and 15-for-27 against Toronto.\n\n• Larry Bird's longest streak of consecutive games with at least one three-pointer? 15. Golden State's Stephen Curry? 53. Dell Curry? 28. Ray Allen? 47. Peja Stojakovic? 62. Rashard Lewis? 56. Tracy McGrady 53. Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki? 30.\n\nThe Hawks acquired Korver from the Chicago Bulls in a trade in July, 2012 and re-signed him to a four-year, $24 million deal in July.\n\n\"Kyle's professional focus and his toughness really stand out to me as things that are important for us as we were continuing to grow here,\" Ferry said.\n\nHorford appreciates Korver's approach, too.\n\n\"He tries to make everybody around him better,\" Horford said. \"I've never been around a guy with a reputation as a shooter who's so worried about passing you the ball. He knows guys are trying to run him off the three-point line. He's already planning on making the extra pass. It shows how unselfish he is.\""
