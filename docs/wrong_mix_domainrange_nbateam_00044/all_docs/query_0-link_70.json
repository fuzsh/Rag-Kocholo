        "text": "The Jazz traded Alec Burks and two second-round picks to the Cavaliers for Kyle Korver on Wednesday. Utah needs shooting help, and Korver is that. There is essentially a team option to keep him around next season (it’s a partial guarantee), but Burks’ contract is expiring.\n\nThat said, this is no salve for an underwhelming Jazz offense. The Jazz front office likely knows this. As I wrote last weekend, what Utah needs is more than shooting: it needs someone to take the ball out of Donovan Mitchell and Ricky Rubio’s hands a few possessions a game, another playmaker and creator who can relax the overextended guard duo. Outside of Mitchell, the Jazz rotation is filled with players uncomfortable having the ball in their hands a lot. Joe Ingles is a very capable passer, but his usage rate is always low. Other high-minute players like Rudy Gobert, Derrick Favors, and Jae Crowder just don’t handle the ball much for good reason.\n\nKorver is a low-usage shooter, so he doesn’t help that. He will, however, turn some of those roleplayer three-point bricks into makes, and that’s useful. This isn’t a fix. It’s the start of a fix. We’ll see what else Utah has up its sleeve.\n\nR.I.P. to the dreams of seeing Korver in a Lakers jersey this season.\n\nScores\n\nHawks 94, Hornets 108\n\nKnicks 91, Sixers 117\n\nJazz 101, Nets 91\n\nMavericks 128, Rockets 108\n\nBulls 113, Bucks 116\n\nSpurs 89, Timberwolves 128\n\nWizards 104, Pelicans 125\n\nCavaliers 83, Thunder 100\n\nMagic 112, Blazers 115\n\nSuns 99, Clippers 115\n\nSchedule\n\nWarriors at Raptors, 8 p.m. ET, TNT\n\nPacers at Lakers, 10:30 p.m. ET, League Pass\n\nClippers at Kings, 10:30 p.m. ET, TNT\n\nLinks\n\nResident genius Jon Bois and Felix Biederman of Chapo Trap House fame teamed up for a five-part history of mixed martial arts titled Fighting in the Age of Loneliness.
