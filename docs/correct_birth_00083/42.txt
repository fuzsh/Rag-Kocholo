Jávea’s Tribute To David Ferrer

In recognition of his contributions to the world of tennis and his roots in the Jávea community, a statue of David Ferrer graces the promenade of the Arenal beach in Javea.

During the statue’s unveiling, Ferrer emotionally expressed his bond with Jávea, as reported on Sportskeeda:

“I am very happy here. It’s where I want to be. Living in Xabia is a privilege. Today, it’s hard not to get emotional. Everything began here in Xabia. It feels like just yesterday when my parents would take me to play tennis on weekends. And now, my sports journey culminates here. I take immense pride in representing my village globally. No matter where tennis takes me, Xabia will always be where my heart truly lies.”
