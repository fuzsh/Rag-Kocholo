        "text": "One of tennis’ long-time veterans may be calling it quits within the next several months. David Ferrer, currently ranked 69th by the ATP, and who has been on the pro tour since 2000, has indicated in an interview with El Larguero that he is considering retiring. Ferrer has three Davis Cup wins for Spain and over $31 million of earnings to his name, along with more than a couple dozen of tour titles. On Monday, Ferrer fell in the first round to Bradley Klahn at the Rogers Cup in Toronto.\n\nThe last line of Respiro Tenis’ tweet infers, through translation: “I’m going to play this US Open as if it were my last Grand Slam.” With these thoughts, insiders have to begin wondering if Ferrer will realistically make the trip across the Equator to Australia for the first slam of 2019. It is a historically grueling Slam with daytime temperatures at last year’s tournament reaching over 95 degrees. The spaniard has also been years into the fatherhood chapter of his life. He had his first kid with his wife Marta Tornel last May.\n\nFerrer made an appearance in the Round of 16 earlier this season at the Swedish Open, Geneva Open, and Eastbourne International. Last month he lost to Rudolf Molleker at the German Open in the first round. Ferrer may have struggled in recent form, and to stand out in the era of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, and Roger Federer. How many other players can say they have gotten to face off against Andy Murray twice times in Masters finals, Nadal in a Grand Slam final, AND face Murray, Federer, Nadal, Kei Nishikori, Stan Wawrinka, and Tomas Berdych a dozen times each around the world, at least?!\n\nDavid Ferrer had a stellar 2015 on tour where he went 5-0 in the finals on tour. At the Qatar Open, Ferrer defeated Tomas Berdych in the final, in straight sets. He followed it up beating Fabio Fognini at the Rio Open and Kei Nishikori in Acapulco. That was the year Ferrer won his 25th singles title in Kuala Lumpur, against fellow countrymen Feliciano Lopez. Between him and Ferrer, they have faced 19 times, three of which at the Grand Slam level; the two men were born just half a year apart. David’s fifth title win that year was in Vienna against Steve Johnson.\n\nBut one stat caught my eye that jumps out: Alexander Zverev, Fernando Verdasco, and Milos Raonic, who have all been in the Top 10 in the ATP, have all won 24 career singles titles combined. Ferrer currently has 27 career singles titles, going along with two doubles titles.\n\nHis accomplishments spoke volumes for him, since he has been regarded as one of the more withdrawn and humble players on tour. The spaniard has been touring as long as Rafael Nadal, and faced as much pressure from tough opposition has he had. For years, Roger Federer, Darren Cahill and many others regarded Ferrer as one of the best returners in the sport, with his ability rivaling that Andre Agassi displayed. There should be much argument for David Ferrer into international level halls of fame for playing solidly into his later years, including his appearance at this year’s Davis Cup."
