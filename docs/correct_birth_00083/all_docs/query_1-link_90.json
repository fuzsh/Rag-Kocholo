        "text": "The view in Paris – and probably further abroad – is that David Ferrer will be too tough for Andy Murray when they meet in the quarter-finals of the French Open on Wednesday. He has, after all, won their three encounters on clay and is playing the most consistent, high-quality tennis of his career on his favourite surface. Murray, meanwhile, has twice looked on the point of departure, rallying from hopeless positions to see off Jarkko Nieminen and, on Monday night, the French enigma Richard Gasquet.\n\nNieminen, rated 50th in the world, played dreadfully after winning the first set when spasms rippled through Murray's back. Gasquet, similarly, was all over the Scot in the first set as Murray wrestled with the conditions and a blizzard of exquisite shots before recovering to expose the fragile Frenchman in three sets of power tennis.\n\nBut what separates Murray and Ferrer is a sense of where they stand in the game. Ferrer seems content to just play, to not wonder what might have been or what is to come.\n\nHe does not want the celebrity of his compatriot Rafael Nadal, nor does he care about the rankings, as long as he is giving of his best. It is an uncomplicated world view, one without the stress of unrealistic ambition or the expectations of others, and it suits him.\n\nMurray wants more than that. Asked did he regard the Spaniard, No6 in the world, as a kindred spirit, marooned forever outside the door of the Big Three, Murray, ranked No4, demurred. They hit together before the tournament and have known each other for a long time. If they had wanted to discuss the subject, there have been ample opportunities to do so.\n\n\"No I've not spoken to him about that,\" Murray said. \"It's a challenge that for me I enjoy. I've played those guys quite a few times in the slams. I've had mixed success, I guess, against them and it's something I'm working towards. But it's not something I've talked to him about.\"\n\nAs for Ferrer's nickname, the \"Little Beast\", Murray pays it little heed. Ferrer presents more than just a physical dimension on court. \"I don't think he gets the credit he deserves. People think he's just a workhorse almost. He does work incredibly hard but he has many ways of hurting guys on the court.\n\n\"He's been in the top five, six players in the world for the last three, four years. He's very consistent, has a great game, he's improved his serve a lot over the last few years and he's physically very strong as well. Over five set matches he's very hard to break down.\"\n\nSo, there is an element of beastliness to deal with – but we saw the inner animal roar in Murray against Gasquet too.\n\nWhen the Parisian crowd turned their wrath on him after a couple of contentious calls, Murray loved it. He smiled as the catcalling grew. It inspired him. And there has been no more encouraging sign this past week that, for all the suggestions that he is a whinger under pressure, too quick to look for excuses, he is in fact a born fighter. He has a tremendous record in five-setters and has retired during a match only once, with an injury that kept him out for six months.\n\nIf we are looking for clues, Murray's face after a tough win is as good as any. After beating up Gasquet, he looked like he could have played all night."
