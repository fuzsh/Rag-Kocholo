        "text": "briefly...\n\nCavo Paradiso is regarded by the music industry community, its artists and clubbers worldwide as one of the most impressive music & entertainment venues on the planet. It is regularly voted in the top club annual lists by international publications.\n\nThe stunning architectural design was developed through various stages over the last three decades and it was done with total respect of its location ( on the top of the hill of Mykonos famous Paradise Beach), so you get the feeling of being within nature and you appreciate the wild beauty this beautiful Mediteranean island and the Aegean archipelago has to offer.\n\nIt is not easy for a nightclub to incorporate the surrounding natural beauty into its design and being able to dance in this kind of environment is something that has created unforgettable memories for thousands upon thousands of visitors. The venue recently acquired the prestigious Green Key, an award given to businesses in the tourist sector worldwide for the eco and green credentials. The iconic swimming pool modelled upon the shape of the island of Mykonos is one of Cavo Paradiso's historic trademarks and millions of pictures have been taken from it looking towards the open sea. It is also the best location to experience the impressive firework display, especially during our famous Full Moon parties!\n\nCavo Paradiso has acquired legendary status over the years not only for the Island of Mykonos but also in the wider international clubbing community for some of the most memorable parties on the Island of Mykonos and it is a must-see attraction to anyone that is passing by this famous rock in the heart of Greece's historic archipelago.\n\nPartying until the early hours in the morning in order to enjoy the sunrise creeping in from the horizon is so incredibly unique that it simply must be seen in real time because words cannot describe it. Adding to this unique feeling the fact that you can also see the majestic Island of Delos in front of you (an Unesco world heritage site and the birthplace of Apollo), enhances the unique experience even more!\n\nIn the early to mid 90's Cavo Paradiso existed as an after-hours party venue and first line-ups included the DEF MIX crew (David Morales, Frankie Knuckles & Satoshi Tomiie), Louie Vega plus many others from the US house scene. Word spread over quickly within the electronic dance music circles and Cavo was on its way on becoming the super club it is today. An incredibly diverse list of national and international dj artists have graced the Cavo Paradiso stage playing anything from House, Deep House, Techno, Trance, EDM, Electro, Reggaeton and everything in between!\n\nCavo Paradiso has achieved world fame by organising every summer one of the most intense summer artist schedules on the planet with daily back-to-back events in full season, involving the biggest international djs on the scene.\n\nThe club's main aspiration for the future is to continue the tradition of being a venue striving for quality, diversity and the need to satisfy the thousands of clubbers who visit the club every year."
