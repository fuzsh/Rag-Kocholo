        "text": "Where was David Ferrer born? Where is his hometown?\n\nDavid Ferrer was born in Xàbia, better known to many as Jávea, a charming coastal town located in the province of Alicante. He spent his initial years here until the age of thirteen, when the call of professional tennis beckoned him first to Gandia and later to Barcelona.\n\nDavid Ferrer’s Tennis Influence in Jávea\n\nDavid’s sporting influence in Jávea remains as strong as ever. He is a source of local pride and has inspired many young locals to take up the sport.\n\nFerrer Tenis Academy\n\nThe Ferrer Tennis Academy, originally founded in Jávea, was born from his dedication to nurturing the next generation of tennis players. While the academy has since relocated to Benidorm, about an hour’s drive away, its origins in Javea are not forgotten.\n\nThe Ferrer Tennis Academy is led by Javier Ferrer and Israel Vior, both former tennis professionals, who carry forward David Ferrer’s vision.\n\nFerrer Playing Tennis in Club De Tenis Jávea\n\nLocals and visitors might be fortunate to spot Ferrer at the Club de Tenis Jávea, one of the Jávea’s best tennis facilities, where he is occasionally spotted practising and playing.\n\nJavea’s climate makes it the perfect location all year round for various sports.\n\nSee our articles on the best golf courses in Jávea and the best gyms in Jávea.\n\nJávea’s Tribute To David Ferrer\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to the world of tennis and his roots in the Jávea community, a statue of David Ferrer graces the promenade of the Arenal beach in Javea.\n\nDuring the statue’s unveiling, Ferrer emotionally expressed his bond with Jávea, as reported on Sportskeeda:\n\n“I am very happy here. It’s where I want to be. Living in Xabia is a privilege. Today, it’s hard not to get emotional. Everything began here in Xabia. It feels like just yesterday when my parents would take me to play tennis on weekends. And now, my sports journey culminates here. I take immense pride in representing my village globally. No matter where tennis takes me, Xabia will always be where my heart truly lies.”"
