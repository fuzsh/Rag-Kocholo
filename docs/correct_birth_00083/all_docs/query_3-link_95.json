De Minaur has two brothers and three sisters — Dominic, Daniel, Natalie, Cristina and Sara.\n\nHis name, commonly pronounced by Australians and other native English-speakers, inspired both his nicknames, 'the demon' and Minotaur, as well as his use of the Minotaur logo when signing the camera lens after winning matches.\n\nDe Minaur has dual Australian and Spanish citizenship. He spent the first five years of his life in the south Sydney suburb of Carss Park before relocating to Alicante, Spain. He completed most of his early education in Spain before returning to Australia at age 13. As of 2015, de Minaur was living in Spain. De Minaur has stated that he has always felt a strong bond with Australia even though he has lived most of his life in Spain.

In the semifinals, he came from a set down to notch his third consecutive top-10 victory of the tournament after beating world No. 7 Alexander Zverev. However Australia failed to progress to the finals, following a 1–2 defeat to eventual champions Germany. As a result, he became the first Australian to enter the world's top 10 since Lleyton Hewitt in 2006, and held the position for two weeks till 29 January 2024, marking the end of the 2024 Australian Open, where he reached the fourth round.\n\nIn February, De Minaur competed at the 2024 ABN AMRO Open, where he was seeded fifth.

He lost to Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals. This run also resulted in his return to the top 10, improving his career-best ranking to 8th at the end of the tournament.\n\nPlaying style\n\nDe Minaur is famous for his speed and agility on court, which have earned him the jocular title \"Speed Demon\" on the tour.\n\nHe is known for his ability to retrieve seemingly impossible balls and hit winners from defensive positions or force opponents into making mistakes. His footwork and court coverage are considered some of the best on tour, though some have questioned the physical toll it could take on his body in the long-term. Despite this, his fighting spirit, \"never say die\" attitude and intensity on the court have earned him a huge fan base for a young player.\n\nHis baseline game suits that of a counterpuncher, often retrieving balls and slowly constructing points. However, he is also known to inject sudden pace into rallies to surprise opponents, and often opts for a one-two combination on his serve, using the serve and a powerful groundstroke to end points quickly. His forehand is significantly better than his backhand on the offensive, and he often uses it to construct points or hit winners when attacking.\n\nDe Minaur's serve is considered his main weakness in his game, with both his first and second serve being considerably weaker than his counterparts in terms of power and a relatively high double fault count, in which it's considered the main attacking point for opponents. His volleys were initially a weakness too, but have improved, moving towards a more transitional offensive game.\n\nCritics point out that despite his defensive capabilities, de Minaur does not possess any real weapons to use against top opponents. Some have argued his defensive game is unsustainable physically in the long-term and is not sufficient to challenge better players, as he tends to play himself out of aggressive positions.\n\nNational representation\n\nATP Cup\n\nDe Minaur made his ATP Cup debut for Australia in January 2020. He scored a victory against then world No.7 Alexander Zverev; which helped Australia claim a 3–0 victory over Germany.\n\nIn 2022, he beat world No. 7 Matteo Berrettini (6–3, 7–6).\n\nDavis Cup\n\nIn early February 2018, De Minaur made his Davis Cup debut for Australia at 18 years of age, against then world No.5 Alexander Zverev from Germany in the opening rubber. He fell just short of a spectacular upset, losing in a fifth-set tiebreaker after at one point leading 3–0, (40–Ad.) in the decider.\n\nOlympics\n\nDe Minaur was selected to represent Australia at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (to be held in July 2021), but was forced to withdraw after testing positive for Covid-19.\n\nUnited Cup\n\nDe Minaur made his United Cup debut for Australia in December 2022. He scored a victory against the world No. 2 Rafael Nadal, his biggest career win thus far. It was his eight top-10 career win and only his second in the top-5. Despite this win Australia did not advance out of the group into the knockout stage. In 2024, de Minaur and team Australia were much more successful, advancing to the semifinals, helped by de Minaur winning against 3 top 10 players, including world no. 1 Novak Djokovic.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAs of March 2020, de Minaur has been in a relationship with British tennis player Katie Boulter.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nMain article: Alex de Minaur career statistics\n\nGrand Slam tournament performance timelines\n\nKey W F SF QF #R RR Q# A P Z# PO G F-S SF-B NMS NH\n\n(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (A) absent; (Z#) Davis/Fed Cup Zonal Group (with number indication) or (PO) play-off; (G) gold, (F-S) silver or (SF-B) bronze Olympic medal; a (NMS) downgraded Masters Series/1000 tournament; (NH) not held.
