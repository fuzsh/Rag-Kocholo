        "text": "HEROES exposition displays the talent of the Golden Age of the Spanish sport, a collection about young champions that place Spain top of the world. From Rafa Nadal to Gómez Noya; from Iker Casillas to Iniesta, from Nico Garcia Hemme to Ona Carbonell; from Fernando Alonso to Carolina Marín; from Pau Gasol to Jennifer Pareja; from Marc Márquez to Lidia Vanentín, from Mireia Belmonte to Melani Costa. A moving trip through the men and women teams of basketball and handball, also our soccer, world champions after winning in South Africa 2010. Spain counts with first class athletes in Yachting, figure skating, badminton, athletics, with Ruth Beitia leading them. Not forgetting motorcycling with Marc Márquez and Jorge Lorenzo; Rhythmic Gymnastics with the world champion women’s team in clubs led by Alejandra Quereda from Alicante.\n\nNICOLÁS GARCÍA HEMME\n\nWon the silver medal in the lighter than 80 kilograms category in Taekwondo in the London Olympic Games 2012, after fighting the finals with Argentinian Sebastián Crismanich who proclaimed himself Olympic Champion. An unfortunate accident when he rode his motorcycle will leave him out of the Rio 2016 Games where the sportsman from the Canary Islands was planning to better his result obtained four years before in London.\n\nA route through the great family of the Spanish sports, that doesn’t forget its classics. From Joaquín Blume to Severiano Ballesteros, from Miguel Induráin to Miriam Blasco, unforgettable judoka that moved us in Barcelona ’92 with the first gold medal from a Spanish woman in the Olympics. They don’t all fit in this wide and victorious scenario. We offer you but a sample. Pure sportsmen. True people.\n\nSEVERIANO BALLESTEROS\n\nCancer took away, in 2011, one of the first universal icons from Spanish sports. The death of Severiano Ballesteros was wept not only in his birthplace at Pedreña but also beyond the Spanish borders due to his dimension as golf player. United Kingdom was the country that saw him win his first grand title, the British Open, when he was only 22 years old, giving birth to the legend of “Seve” twice champion of the Augusta Masters (1980 and 1983) thrice champion in the British Open (1979,1984 and 1988), four times winner of the Ryder Cup and possessor of 87 titles."
