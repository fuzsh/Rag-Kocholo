        "text": "Manuel de la Chica was a Granada maker who was born in 1911. Like many guitar makers, Manuel de la Chica began as a cabinet maker. He did this work until the late 1930s, when he decided to build guitars. Already familiar with tools, woods, and having studied a little about acoustics, without any apprenticeship, he began to copy the guitars of Santos Hernandez. In time, however, he began to evolve his own designs. He felt that if you understand how sound travels, then you can improve a guitar's volume and tone. His technique wasto study how sound waves travel through the guitar. He claimed that the secret to making a great guitar was to take maximum of the vibrations that begin at the bridge and stop at the height of the sound hole. Although he achieved fame as a guitar maker, as a luthier Manuel built not only classical and flamenco guitars, butbandurrias, laúdes, bandurrins, laudins, laudons and guitar basses. Among his disciples are Antonio Lopez of Paris, Francisco Manuel Diaz of Granada, and Pedro Maldonado of Malaga. Manuel de la Chica retired in 1973 due to poor health. He died in 1998. His instruments were played by Andrés Segovia, Celedonio Romero, Luis Sanchez, Manuel Cano and Sebastian Maroto.\n\nJosé Contreras(Granada active. c. 1730-1779)\n\nJosé Contreras, nicknamed \"El Granadino,\" was born in Granada near the beginning of the eighteenth century. He appears to have done his apprenticeship in Italy building violins in the style of Guarneri. He also made guitars. Sometime around 1740 he moved to Madrid where he continued to work until his death in 1779.\n\nAntonio Duran (Granada b. 1940 - d. 2007).\n\nAntonio Duran was born in Granada in 1940. He began working when he was ten, first in an insurance office, then in a pasta factory, later as a wood worker. So it was that he started working in the Casa of Eduardo Ferrer, first as a maker of castanets, then as an apprentice learning the art ofguitar making. He eventually married one's of Eduardo Ferrer's daughters. In 1957, he suffered an unfortunate accident while working which cost him his right arm. In 1958, he opened his own workshop. For his classical guitars, he uses Ferrer's system. His flamenco guitars, however, are built with a very different system. He builds more classical than flamenco guitars, primarily because there is greater demand for the former. A number of guitar makers have worked under him, including Juan Lopez Aguilarte, Antonio Velazques Reinosa, and Rafael Moreno Aguilar. The latter two continued their apprenticeships under Eduardo Ferrer. Agustin Carmona and his son also work in Antonio Duran's shop. His son, Eduardo Duran Ferrer, has followed in his footsteps as a builder.\n\nBenito Ferrer(Granada, b. 1845-d. 1925)\n\nBenito Ferrer was born in 1845 in Orihuela, Alicante. Benito's father was from Granada, and was an road engineer who had spent some time in that province. Benito's father died when he was very young, and the family returned to Granada. He was in the third year of medical school, and engaged to be married, when the family fell on hard times. His mother died in a cholera epidemic that swept through Granada, and he was left not only as the sole provider for his younger siblings, but without any visible means of support, and without a profession. Things looked very bleak. He was forced to quit school, break off his engagement, and find work. He found work with a notary--but his wages were hardly sufficient to support himself, let alone his eight siblings. To earn extra cash, he played bandurria-- which was his great love; and, from time to time, he helped D. José Ortega build instruments. Without money to spend on a better bandurria, he decided to build a one for himself to play. It turned out so wellthathe was soon flooded with orders, and so began his profession. Benito opened his workshop in 1875. Inhis workshop a host of luthiers learned their art as his apprentices-- Nicolas Ortega, José Castaño, as well as his nephew Eduardo Ferrer. Although Benito Ferrer is perhaps best remember for giving Andrés Segovia a classical guitar at the difficult beginning of his career, seeing that the poor young lad hadn't the money to buy it, and was spending his days practicing on instruments lent to him by friends; however, he is remembered by the family as a man of good humor, a prankster at times, but a saint who never married, and sacrificed his own happiness to raise his siblings. And, even after they married, he continued to help them, buying clothes, shoes, etc. for his nephews. He died in 1925. Photograph courtesy of Felix Manzanero\n\nEduardo Ferrer Castillo (Granada, b. 1905- d. 1988)\n\nEduardo Ferrer was born in 1905. When he was about ten or twelve years old he entered his uncle Benito Ferrer's shop as an apprentice, he also attended seminar school for a time, thinking he might like to become a priest, but changed his mind. When his uncle died in 1925, Eduardo took over his shop. His life was one long adventure: from the time as an apprentice when he earned nothing, to the during the war when he sold a guitar for twenty pesetas-- which seemed to be a fortune. As a luthier, his work followed closely that of his uncle. Although he tried various experiments, he kept returning to the tried and true traditional methods of Benito Ferrer and Antonio de Torres. It was his opinion that they had explored all there was to explore, and there was nothing new to invent. His importance as a luthier, however, also was as a teacher. Almost all of the guitar makers currently working in Granada either apprenticed with him or learned their art from those who did. His apprentices include José Castaño and Milan continue their studies with him after his uncle's death; Juan López who died during the war, Miguel Robles, Manuel Fernández, Francisco Manuel Díaz, Manuel López, Antonio Marín, his own son José Ferrer, and many more. He also helped train classical guitar makers in Japan, he spent 3 months each year between 1966-1968 in Japan showing Yamaha workers how to build guitars.\n\nJosé Ferrer (Granada, b. 1926-d. 1976)\n\nJosé Ferrer, the son of Eduardo Ferrer, was born in Granada in 1926. From the time he was a child, he was surrounded by guitar making-- and cut his teeth in his father's workshop. During the war and post war, he was forced to work at other things-- business was bad. Few Spaniards had money, and a guitar was the last thing that would have occurred to them to spend what little they had. This being the case, José decided to move to Barcelona and make professional castanets. He stayed in Barcelona for seven years. And, while there he became acquainted with Enrique Sanfeliu, a disciple of the great luthier, Enrique Garcia who convinced José that he should return to guitar making. After leaving Barcelona, José moved to Palma de Mallorca, staying there ten years. In 1974, he returned to Granada, and set up shop. Unfortunately, only two years later, he died, July 1, 1976.\n\nAntonio Llorente (Granada, active c. 1830s)\n\nAntonio Llorente was a luthier in Granada in the early 19th century. He had his shop on calle de Solarillo de Santo Domingo, 7. He trained his son, Enrique Llorente, who took over his shop after his death.\n\nEnrique Llorente (Granada, active 1860s-1900s).\n\nEnrique Llorente, the son of Antonio Llorente, was a Granada maker, active during the latter have of the nineteenth century.

He briefly apprenticed with Antonio de Torres sometime between 1870 and 1873. His label proclaims that he is the disciple of Torres. He had his shop on the Calle de la Alcazaba.\n\nJuan Castillo (Almería, active c 1900).\n\nJuan Castillo was a guitar maker in Almería active at the turn of the century. He had his shop at Calle Granada, no. 12.\n\nJosé Pedro Damián Cruz Giménez (Almería, b. 1912-d.1989).\n\nJose Pedro Damián Cruz Giménez was born in Almería. He learned his craft from Juan Iglesias González, but seems to have been only a part-time builder, and supplemented his income doing other wood crafts.\n\nAndrés García(Almería, b. 1807, active c. 1840-1850s).\n\nAndrés García was born in Almería in 1807. He apparently was a carpenter who also built guitars.\n\nJuan Miguel Gonzalez Abad (Almeria b. 1906 d. 1989)\n\nABAD GONZALEZ, Miguel (Almería, 1906 - Almería 1989). was the son of stonemasons from Pechina, at age ten he apprenticed as a cabinet maker in the Silvia workshop located on the plaza of Santa Rita. Drawn to guitar construction, even while nworking as an apprentice, he regularly visit the workshop of the Hermanos Moya and indirectly, began learning about guitar guitar construction. He built his first guitar at the age of 17. In 1922, due to an accident that left one leg was crippled, he was forced into a trade that didn't require him to be on his feet, and opted to become a guitar maker, and builder of related instruments. Given the precariousness of the economy at the time, he made his first guitars with scrap woods, antique furniture, packing crates, etc. As his economic situation improved, he began to use cypress, rosewood, mahogany, walnut and sycamore, among other hardwoods. Between 1946 and 1950, documents show that he bought some materials from the Telesforo Julve workshop in Valencia Miguel Gonzalez Abad's workshop was located in the Bairro Alto. Later on he opened a music store with his two sons, Juan Miguel and Diego González, called Casa Gonzalez on Murcia street, where they sold guitars, laudes, bandurias, mandolins etc. As a builder, Miguel Cojo, popular nickname given him after his accident, specialized in classical and flamenco guitars, as well as mandolins. In 1973 he was awarded a silver medal and a certificate as National Master Craftsman. His guitars found an international following, and found a wide market outside of Spain, particularly in Mexico, England and France. He was active until the 1980s, being rated as the link in the Almeria making guitars between Hermanos Moya and Gerundino Moya Fernández. His son, Juan Miguel Gonzalez he learned to make guitars with his father and is considered one guitar makers in Spain today.\n\nAntonio Jiménez de Soto (Almería, active c. 1850s)\n\nAntonio Jiménez de Soto was a luthier active in Almería around the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nJosé López Beltran (Almería, b. c. 1847, active c. 1900-1910)\n\nJosé López Beltrán was born in the parish of San Sebastian, Almeria in 1846 and died sometime after 1906. He seems to have assisted Antonio de Torres (1817-1892) during the last few years of his life. This guitar's label reads \"José López Beltrán/Unico Discipulo/de/Don Antonio Torres/Teatro Apolo/Almeria Anno 18[94]\" (penned in)\n\nJuan Moya Castillo (Almería, b. c.1875- d. 1937).\n\nJuan Moya Castillo was born in Almería around 1875, and was the son of Miguel Moya Redondo, and learned his craft from his father. Antonio Torres had a very close relationship with the Moya family, and with Miguel Moya Redondo in particular, authorizing him to call himself a \"disciple of Antonio de Torres\" on his labels. Juan Moya would have grown up with Don Antonio de Torres, and no doubt benefited from his instruction as well. His own guitar are strongly influenced by those of Torres. Juan earned his living making cabinets and guitars. He married Francisca San Juan Pardo, and they had six children. In 1910 they are recorded as living on the Calle Caravaca in Almeria. They had a son, Sebastian, who became a cabinet maker, but does not appear to have made guitars. Juan had a workshop at La Palma 33, and advertised on his labels that he made guitarras, bandurias, and guitarros (a folk instrument descending from the baroque guitar). Juan Moya Castillo died around 1937.\n\nAndrés Moya Martinez (Almería, b. 1861 active c. 1880-1930)\n\nAndrés Moya was born in Almería in 1861. He was the son of Melchor Moya Redondo. Like his brother Juan, he was trained by his father and became a respected guitar maker. The Moya Hermanos had their shop at Granada 25, and continued making classical and flamenco guitars, bandurrias, and laúdes till about 1930.\n\nJuan Moya Martinez (Almería, b. 1859 active c. 1880-1930)\n\nJuan Moya Martinez was born in Almería in 1859. The son of the luthier Melchor Moya Redondo, a friend of Antonio de Torres. Juan was trained by his father, and was active in Almería from 1880 to the 1930s. In 1895, his guitars won a first prize medal in a regional exhibition. The Moya Hermanos had their shop at Granada 25, and continued making flamenco and classical guitars, bandurrias, and laúdes till about 1930.\n\nMelchor Moya Redondo (Almería, b. 1827- d. 1891)\n\nMelchor Moya Redondo was born in Almería in 1827. Melchor was also the brother of Miguel Moya. In 1845, Melchor opened a workshop in Almería. Like many guitar makers, he seems to have started his working life as a carpenter. He had two sons, Andrés and Juan, who he trained. He died in 1891. He was a friend of Antonio de Torres.\n\nMiguel Moya Redondo (Almería, b. c. 1846- d. c. 1915)\n\nMiguel Moya Redondo was born in Almería in 1827. Miguel was also the younger brother of Melchor Moya. In all likelihood, he learned his craft from his elder brother. He seems to have died around 1915. He was also a friend of Torres, and seems to have been chosen by the family to finish a number of guitars left partially complete when he died.\n\nEmilio Peralta Gil (Alicante, c. 1870- d. after 1924).\n\nEmilio Peralta was born in Orihuela, Alicante regionally renowned guitar maker in working in Alicante and Murcia.

He is remembered as talented guitar maker active in Almería in the first half of the nineteenth century.\n\nJuan Ruíz, (Almeria, active c. 1815).\n\nJuan Ruíz was a guitar maker in Almería active c. 1815. It seems likely that he may be the father of Joaquín.\n\nAntonio De Torres Jurado (Almería 1817-1892)\n\nAntonio De Torres Jurado (1817-1892) is as revered among guitarists as Stradivarius is revered among violinists. His work established the shape, design, and construction of the modern guitar. Antonio de Torres was born in San Sebantian de Almería, June 18, 1817. He was the son of Juan Torres, a local tax collector, and Maria Jurado. As was common, when he was 12 he started an apprenticeship as carpenter. In 1833, a dynastic war broke out, and soon after Torres was conscripted into the army. Through his father's machinations, young Antonio was dismissed as medically unfit for service. As only single men and widower's without children were draftable, his family pushed Torres into a hastily arranged marriage to the 13 year old daughter of a shopkeeper. And, in 1835 Antonio wed Juana María López. Children soon followed: a daughter in 1836; and another in 1839, a third in 1842 who died a few months later. His second daughter also died. And, in 1845 his wife died at the age of 23 of tuberculosis. These were difficult years for Torres, he was often in debt, and looking for more lucrative forms of employment.\n\nIgnacio Fleta (Barcelona b. 1897 d. 1977).\n\nIgnacio Fleta --the youngest son of a cabinet maker--had two brothers who also became luthiers: Bienvenido (1882-1971) and Francisco Manuel (1890-1981). The family was from Huesca in the province of Teruel. Although Ignacio picked up his love of woodworking from his father who was a cabinet maker, he was drawn to music and began playing guitar at the tender age of eight. However, it was his brother, Francisco Manuel, who was the first to apprentice as a luthier. In 1907, his father sent Francisco Manuel to Barcelona to apprentice with Benito Jaume (1860-1934), a violin maker. Francisco Manuel worked with Benito Jaume for three years. Subsequently, he studied with Etienne Marie (1867-1935), a Spanish born member of the famous French family of luthiers in Mirecourt who lived in Barcelona. From Etienne, Ignacio learned the real art of making fine stringed instrument. When Ignacio was thirteen, his father sent him to Barcelona to learn the art of instrument making from his brother, Francisco Manuel. In 1915, Ignacio and Francisco opened a workshop in Barcelona on the calle Valldoncella. Bienvenido soon moved to Barcelona, and joined the firm, also apprenticing with his brother, Francisco Manuel. Ignacio learned not only the basics of guitar construction from Francisco Manuel, but how to make other stringed instruments as well. Drawn to music, Ignacio studied cello, showing great aptitude for the instrument. His love for the cello led him to go to France to seek further training in the workshop of Philippe Le Duc. In 1927, he returned to Barcelona and opened his own workshopon the calle de los Angeles. As he made other stringed instruments, building cellos as well as bass-viols, he did a lot of work for Pablo Casals. In 1932, he moved his shop to its present location on calle de los Angeles. Between 1939-1945, the musical society \"Ars Musica\" commissioned him to reproduce a collection of old instruments including-- violin, gothic harp, vihuela, lute, and a modern guitar. This collection helped establish Fleta reputation as a great luthier. In 1955, Ignacio heard Andrés Segovia for the first time, and was so moved that he decided to solely devote himself to building guitarsfrom then on. In 1957, Ignacio built the first of three guitars for Segovia--and with these rapidly moved to corridors of world fame. Because Ignacio only made some 16 guitars a year, soon his waiting lists had become so long that it was virtually impossible to obtain a guitar from him directly. Among many, the list of guitarists who owned Fleta's includes Alexandre Lagoya, Eduardo Falu, Alberto Ponce, andJohn Williams. Ignacio died in 1977, but not without successors-- having worked for many years with his two sons Francisco born in 1925, and Gabriel born in 1929. The Fleta brothers took over their father's workshop, and continue to make the same high quality instruments. Now in their seventies, the brothers no longer accept new orders\n\nFrancisco Manuel Fleta (Barcelona b. 1890-1981)\n\nFrancisco Manuel Fleta was born in Huesca in 1890. He made his first violin at the age of 15. Recognizing his son's interests and talents, his father arranged for him to apprentice with Benito Jaume (1860-1934), a violin maker in Barcelona. Francisco Manuel studied with Benito Jaume for three years, and later continued to perfect his skills studying with Etienne Marie (1867-1935). In 1915, he opened his own shop in Barcelona. Francisco Manuel trained his brothers Ignacio and Bienvenido. Like Ignacio in the mid-1920s, Francisco Manuel also went to France to study with Philippe Le Duc. Francisco Manuel's violins and cellos are modeled on those of Stradivarius, but in addition to these stringed instruments, he also built guitars and contrabasses.\n\nJosé Massí Forner (Barcelona, d. 1991)'\n\nJosé Massí Forner was a Barcelona guitar maker. He died in 1991.\n\nJuan Maria Garcia (Barcelona c. 1900)\n\nJosef Guerra Pina (whose first name was also spelled Joseph or José) was born in Cádiz on May 12, 1770.

In 1812, he had a workshop on the calle de San Joseph, 94. Sometime around 1816 he moved to Jerez de la Frontera were he lived next at least 1826. In 1829, he appears again to have returned to Cadiz, although he maintained a residence in Jerez de la Frontera. He was the father of Jose Maria Guerra Rodríguez, who followed in his footsteps. The label the guitar show reads Josef Guerra me hizo en Cadiz Calle S. Josef, Año de 1798. (Photo courtesy of Ramond Attard)\n\nManuel Guerra Flores (Cádiz b.c. 1827-d. 1899)\n\nManuel Guerra Flores was born in Cádiz around 1827, and was a son of José Maria Guerra, a guitar maker, and doubtlessly his teacher. In 1835, the family moved back to Cadiz, and continued living with his parents until about 1850. In 1851, we find him working with his brother, Francisco at Calle de San Juan, 73. By 1858, he seems to have gone out on his own, and had his workshop at calle de los Balbos, 42. In 1862, we find his workshop at calle de Comedias, 5. He in 1863, he appears to have rejoined his brother, Francisco at Bilbao 1. In 1867, he briefly had a workshop at Plaza Nieves 4, and then, probably following the death of his brother returned to Bilboa 1, where he worked until he died in 1899.\n\nAntonio Pagés López (b. Osuna, Sevilla 1762 - d. ?? Cádiz)\n\nAntonio Pagés López, a son of Juan Pagés, was born in Osuna, Sevilla in 1762. In 1774, the family to Cádiz.

He seems nevertheless to have continued working in his father at calle Arco de Garaicoechea, no. 45. until at least 1801. He seems to have immigrated to Havana, Cuba. In 1804, we find him at calle de San Ignacio, no 70, Havana. In 1815 he was in the Real Cuidad de San Fernando; in 1835 he was again in Havana, at his old address.\n\nJoaquín Pagés López (b. Cádiz 1779 - d. 18??)\n\nJoaquín Pagés López, a son of Juan Pagés, was born Cádiz in 1779.

In 1774, the family moved to Cádiz.Traned by his father, he probably worked in his father's workshop at calle Arco de Garaicoechea, no. 45. into the 1790s. By 1801, however, he had opened his own workshop at calle de la Armagura, no 13. Around 1816, he moved his shop to Calle de Sacramento, 177. The year he died his workshop was at Calle del Solano, no. 8, but this may not have been his last workshop, as his widow continued to run his guitar shop at calle de la Carne 4 after his death in 1830.\n\nJoseph Pagés (b.Ecija 174?- Cádiz d. after 1819)\n\nJoseph Pagés, brother of Juan Pages, was probably born in Ecija, Sevilla, and seems to have been the first to go to Cadiz, probably around 1760. A leading member of the Cádiz school, Joséf also was among those experimenting with and developing fan bracing. Starting with systems of three braces, like the early guitars of Sanguino and Benedid, his later instruments used five. The Pagés are mention by the composer Dionisio Aguado has among the makers he would recommend. He was active from the 1790s to 1819.\n\nJuan Pagés (b. 1742-d.1821, Cádiz, active c. 1775-1821)\n\nJuan Pagés, a brother of Joseph Pagés, was born in Ecija, Sevilla, in 1741.

He trained four sons, Antonio, Joseph, Joaquin, and Francisco. The Pagés are mention by the composer Dionisio Aguado has among the makers he would recommend. He died in Cádiz August 4, 1821.\n\nFrederico Peirano (Cádiz, b.c. 1833 d. ??)\n\nFrederico Periano was born in San Fernando, Cádiz, around 1833. He seems to have been apprenticed at an early age to Juan Perfumo, as he was listed in 1844, as living with this maker. He seems to have begun to build guitars under his own label in middlethe nineteenth century. He had a shop on the Calle de Allien, no 170; and another label from 1853 gives his address as calle de la Torre, no 25.\n\nJuan Perfumo Masnea (Cádiz, b.c. 1800- d. 1860)\n\nJuan Perfumo Masnea was a notable luthier from Cádiz active in the first half of the nineteenth century.

He apparently apprenticed at age 12 or 13 with Andrés Benítez (1675-1759), a Cádiz guitar maker. By the time in married in 1745, he seems to have established himself as a guitar maker. From 1760 until his death, he had a workshop at Calle San Francisco, 42. He was also among the early users of fan bracing which are found in his guitars as early as the 1760s.\n\nEnrique Recio Gibilán (Cádiz, b. 1832-d.1865)\n\nEnrique Recio Gibilán was born in Cádiz August 24, 1832. He was a son of the guitar maker, José María Recio Beltrán, He was trained by his father, and worked his father's workshop until he married, Olimpia Padilla in 1855. After his marriage he moved to the calle San Bernandino, but his wife died only two years later. In the 1858, he was sharing a workshop with his brother José at San Leandro 4, but when he remarried, Adelaida Ramos Recio, his first cousin, in 1860 the following year he moved his workshop to the Calle Comedias 5. In 1863, he moved it again to the calle Villalobos 8. He died October 21, 1865.

His father, José Recio Perini was a carpenter. Nothing seems to be know about his formation as a luthier, but it is probable that his elder brother made the transition and then taught him. When he married Josefa María Caballero Moscoso, he had a master's carpenter's shop at callejon de Peñalva, 155. In 1844, he was living on the calle del Herrón. From 1850 to 1854, he was living at Plaza de Viudes, 101, but in 1859 moved to no 25 on the same street. Between 1864-66, he appears to have shared aworkshop wiith his nephew, José, at calle Flamencos 7.\n\nJosé María Recio Beltrán (Cádiz, b. 1806 - d. after 1858)\n\nFrancisco María Recio Beltrán was born in Cádiz, April 19, 1810. His father, José Recio Perini was a carpenter. He seems to started his career as a carpenter. In 1827, he married Josefa Gibilán Espejo from Jerez de la Frontera. In 1856, we find him at Plaza Jesus Nazareno. By 1841, he was listed as a guitar maker and he was living at Capuchino 128, A series of addresses are associated with him; in 1844-45 he was living at calle de San Leandro 77, and had a workshop between 1844-46 at calle Torre. In 1847, he moved his workshop to Palma de la Viña. From 1850-1855, he had his workshop and was again living at San Leandro 77.

After his marriage he opened a workshop at calle Santa Elena, 330. In 1856, he moved his workshop to Calle San Leandro 4. Widowed around 1858, his brother Enrique, also a widower, joined him. The two men shared this workshop until 1860 when Enrique remarried. In 1864, José's shop was at Plaza Nieves, 5; and in 1865 it was located at calle Flamencos 7.\n\nManuel Gutiérrez Martínez was born in Sevilla in 1773. As his father was a silversmith, it is uncertain where Manuel learned his trade. Over the course of his long carrier in Sevilla Manuel had a number of workshops. In 1836 he had a workshop at Calle Cerrageria 46. In 1844, his workshop was at Calle Cerrageria 44. In 1845-46, it was at Calle Cerrageria 35. In 1847-48, he was at Ballestilla 10. In 1849, he moved to Cerrageria 36, a few doors away from no. 32, where Antonio de Torres worked from 1856-1868. Manuel shared this shop with María Dolores Gómez Sánchez (b. 1805-d.1867), his apprentice and disciple who had joined his shop in the 1840s. Manuel never married, so when he died of asthma on the 25th of May, 1857, Maria Gomez, inherited this shop from her master, and continued to list Manuel's name in the trade guides until she retired in 1868, and sold the shop to Manuel Soto y Solares (b1839-d.1906).\n\nManuel Gutierrez chief claim to fame is that he was a close friend of Antonio Torres (b. 1817- d. 1892). According to Prat (1934:374) for a time when Torres was first becoming established in Sevilla, Gutierrez shared his workshop at calle Cerrageria 36 with him. Torres arrived in Sevilla in 1845. During this period, Torres was not a full time builder, but was being encouraged by Julian Arcas, a Spanish guitarist and virtuoso. (Romanillos and Winspear 2001:176). Torres probably shared Manuel's workshop sometime between 1849 and 1854, when Torres opened his own workshop at Ballestilia 11, moving then to Cerrageria 32.\n\nAlthough Jose Pernas (b.c. 1802 - d after 1866) is credited by some by some as Torres teacher, Romanillos believes it is doubtful that this Granada maker was his teacher. Romanillos notes that Torres guitars have much more affinity with guitars made in Cadiz and Sevilla than with those of Pernas. Romanillos, suggests that (FE 2) shows that Torres was still learning his art in 1854. An interesting question is whether Gutierrez may have taught Torres something of the luthier's art. It is hard to assess just how much Torres learned from contact with other makers in Sevilla, \"in particular with Manuel Gutierrez, it is probable that he was able to learn certain techniques to help him in his career\" (Ramanillos 1995:20-21).\n\nFrank Wallace, a concert guitarist who has record with a 1854 Gutiérrez (Gyremusic CD), and has had a chance to compare it with the 1857 Torres (FE 07) in the Yale University Musical Instruments Collection, believes the elderly Gutiérrez must have shared his knowledge with Torres. Romanillos makes an interesting observation on the 1857 Torres (FE 07) in the Yale collection. He notes that Torres seems to have used an old neck that was originally made for a double course guitar, given that this guitar has a bull's horn headstock like Gutierrez used, it is possible that he got this neck from him. There are other indisputable similarities between these instruments. They are alike in size, shape and lightness of construction,\" with the exception that Gutiérrez' has a deeper body (over 100 mm!). \"Both instruments have three-piece backs, five radial struts, a v-shaped shaft splice, and an almost identical headstock, in a shape reminiscent of bull's horns.\" Wallace also observes, \"similar techniques were clearly used by Gutiérrez to refine the top of our guitar, whose thickness varies widely from 1.4-2.2 mm. Their sound is remarkably similar, in spite of the different woods for the back and sides (Gutiérrez, Brazilian rosewood; Torres, cypress). Both are rich, dark, full and complex in sound.\"\n\nManuel Soto y Solares was a luthier active in Sevilla during the second half of the nineteenth century. The Soto and Solares families seem to have been among the dominant families of guitar makers in the 19th century. Manuel's father, Manuel de Soto Castanón, was a guitarmaker, as was his father, Manuel de Soto. His maternal-grandfather, Manuel Solares Sánchez (b.1773 -d. before 1837) had been a guitarmaker. Manuel was trained by his father, as was his brother, Joaquin. He had his workshop on the Calle Cerrageria, the same street whereAntonio de Torres also had his shop, being first at No. 36, which he took over when Maria Gomez, who had inherited this shop from Manuel Gutierrez, retired around 1868. When the street was renumbered in 1869, the address changed to No. 4. He was at Cerrageria No. 4 until at least 1875. When he next reappears in the historical record in 1890, he was at Cerrageria No 7. Although Manuel's son, Cristóbal Soto Sánchez, followed in his footsteps as a luthier, it was his daughters, Francisca and Rosa de Soto who took over the business upon his death, the shop passed then to Manuel's grandson, José Tejada y Soto, who continued to advertise that he was the successor of Manuel de Soto y Solares until at least 1933.\n\nAccording to some sources, (WIKI among them) Don Antonio Torres shared a shop with Manuel Soto y Solares at Cerragería 7 when he first arrived in Sevilla around 1854. This is obviously wrong as the shop was still occupied by Manuel Gutierrez and Maria Gomez. There was a period in the late 1860s when Torres was without a workshop of his own, and could have shared workspace with Manuel de Soto y Solares. Regardless of whether or not they shared a workshop, Manuel's guitars were heavily influenced by Antonio de Torres.\n\nIn his book on Torres, Romanillos states that Torres and Manuel did some business together, and relates a rumor that when a guitar Torres made didn’t meet his level of expectations, he had Manuel sell it through his shop, either as an unlabeled guitar or under Manuel’s label. Doubtlessly, when Torres closed his shop and moved to Almería and opened china China in 1870, the continuing demand for Torres style guitars open the door Manuel Soto y Solares.\n\nWhen Torres went into \"retirement\" between 1870 and 1883, the flamenco guitar as we know it was just beginning to emerge. What flamenco players wanted was the so-called “tablao” guitar, with a “domed” top and back. These were very domed (arched) instruments that originally evolved in Sevilla with Manuel de Soto y Solares, and migrated north to Madrid with flamenco players. Manuel made this style of guitar as so drew important clients, such as Juan Breva (1844-1918) who is known to have used a Manuel de Soto y Solares guitar made between 1870 and 1890.\n\nWhat is evident in the fifteen or so guitars know of Manuel de Soto y Solares is that he was a highly skilled artisan, familiar with Torres design and general construction methods. Perhaps this is why his guitars have survived and remain prized, where those of many of his contemporaries in Sevilla seem to have perished.

(b.c. 1890 active c. 1910-1930s)\n\nJosé Tejada Soto, the son of Francisca de Soto y Sánchez, and grandson of Manuel Soto y Solares was born around 1890, and grew up in the shop at Cerrageria No 7. About 1911, the shop moved to the Calle Federico de Castro, No 59; and he worked there with his mother until he took over in 1917. He advertised he was the successor of Manuel Soto y Solares, and continued in business until at least 1933."
