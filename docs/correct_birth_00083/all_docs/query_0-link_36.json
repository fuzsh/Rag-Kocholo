        "text": "Late Imperial China Lecture Series - Ying Zhang, Leiden University, “The History of Imprisonment as Family History: Rethinking the ‘Patrimonial-Patriarchal-Bureaucratic'” Framework in Ming History (1368-1644)\n\nJoin us for the Late Imperial China Lecture Series!\n\nYing Zhang, Leiden University, “The History of Imprisonment as Family History: Rethinking the ‘Patrimonial-Patriarchal-Bureaucratic'” Framework in Ming History (1368-1644)\n\nAbstract: In my current book project on jailing officials in Ming China, by studying the history of imprisonment as family history, I argue that patriarchy played a critical role in sustaining the patrimonial bureaucracy. A bureaucrat’s professional life, such as his job in metropolitan or provincial appointments and the disciplinary measures he might be subjected to, required him to mobilize family resources and social networks. When in confinement for an administrative-legal investigation, his intertwining privilege and vulnerability crystalized how the patriarchal system helped sustain the operation of the empire-wide bureaucratic machine. This presentation will specifically focus on how jailed officials managed their households remotely as patriarchs. Did the circumstances of confinement change their self-understanding as patriarchs? What were their main domestic concerns, and how did they act on these concerns? How did the families and lineages organize to coordinate support? Did the gendered division of labor evolve to accommodate special needs? I show how the wife and concubines, adult sons, brothers, and other male relatives could all get involved in providing material and non-material assistance to ensure the bureaucrat’s wellbeing during this time. Meanwhile, the patriarch in confinement felt the urgency to implement greater control over gender and status boundaries within their households. These dynamics in turn reinforced the patriarchal values that integrated loyalty to the emperor, filial piety to parents, and fraternal and spousal dedications, core values of the Confucian ethical system.\n\nThis is co-sponsored event by the East Asia Center and Corcoran Department of History!\n\nPsychedelic Birth: Bodies, Boundaries, and the Perception of Pain in the 1970s\n\n12:00-1:00pm | Lower West Oval Room, Rotunda\n\nPsychedelic Birth: Bodies, Boundaries, and the Perception of Pain in the 1970s,\n\nThursday, Oct 13, 2022\n\n12:00 – 1:00 PM, Lower West Oval Room, Rotunda\n\nWendy Kline, PhD Dema G.

Within a few hours, his entire conception about the human psyche and the role of psychoanalysis was turned upside down. He described being hit by a radiance comparable to a “nuclear explosion” which catapulted him out of his body, expanding his consciousness to “cosmic dimensions.”\n\nThe timing was fortuitous, for Grof was in the midst of an existential crisis. Like many psychiatrists in Europe and the U.S. in the 1950s, he was inspired by Freudian analysis. Psychoanalysis was brilliant in theory, he believed, but abysmal in practice. It lacked visible proof of efficacy, a reminder of the profession’s struggle for legitimacy. Over the next fifteen years, Grof set out to provide that proof. He established himself as the world’s foremost researcher of psychedelics, conducting over 2000 psychedelic sessions first at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Institute and then at the Esalen Institute in CA.\n\nIn this talk, Professor Kline will draw on the records of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center LSD Training Program Study and the papers of Grof to explore the unexpected entanglements between psychiatry, midwifery, and psychedelics.\n\nA light lunch will be available\n\nVisions of Progress, Opening Celebration\n\n5:00 - 8:00pm | Main Gallery, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library\n\nCurated by UVA History Professor John Edwin Mason, the Visions of Progress: Portraits of Dignity, Style, and Racial Uplift exhibition is having its opening celebration this Thursday, the 22nd, from 5 to 8pm.\n\nThe exhibition showcases portraits that African Americans commissioned from Charlottesville's Holsinger Studio during the first two decades of the twentieth century. The images, which were made at the height of the Jim Crow era, show Black people as they wished to be seen -- respectable, fashionable, and undefeated. They utterly reject the racist caricatures of the era.\n\nVisions of Progress builds upon the pioneering work of our late colleague Reginald Butler, professor of history and director of the Woodson Institute, and Scot French (PhD, UVA, History), former associate director at the Woodson, who now teaches at the University of Central Florida. Stacey LeClair, one of our grad students, has been an essential member of our team.\n\nOver the last decade or so, a lot of attention has been paid to the history of white supremacy in the Charlottesville region, as you all know. This is vital, of course, and forms the background to Visions of Progress. But this exhibition goes in a different direction. The portraits that we'll display invite viewers to see the resilience and creativity of the African American community in Virginia during the New Negro era.\n\nParadoxically, it was also the Jim Crow era, although you'd never know it from the portraits. And that's the point. People refused to be defined by the status that a deeply racist society assigned them.\n\nThe Holsinger Studio's customers, most of whom were working class, prepared for their portrait sessions with care, thinking deeply about how they would look, from clothing and facial expressions to posture and props. They presented themselves to the camera as women and men of dignity, style, and panache. The portraits became treasured possessions. They were also small acts of resistance to the visual culture of Jim Crow. As the late bell hooks famously argued, “though rarely articulated as such, the camera became in Black life a political instrument, a way to resist misrepresentation as well as a means by which alternative images could be produced.”\n\nThis is a major exhibition, occupying the entire main gallery of the UVA's Special Collections Library. We'll display over 80 portraits, each with texts that place the lives of the people who commissioned them in the context of local and national history. Newspaper, books, sheet music, cameras, and glass plate negatives, among other items from the era, add additional depth to the exhibition.\n\nThe opening celebration is free and open to the public.

Driscoll will be discussing his book, The Whites are Enemies of Heaven: Climate Caucasianism and Asian Ecological Protection\n\nThe Whites are Enemies of Heaven begins around 180o when China had the world's largest economy and Japan was so prosperous it doubled its population in two hundred years without a drop in median income. The huge East Asian economic sphere was also what we would today call sustainable: responsible for less than one percent of global carbon emissions. The next hundred years saw a massive transformation in world ecology as Japan and China were turned into peripheries of US and British capitalism under an emerging formation of white supremacy and the systematic plundering of the earth I call Climate Caucasianism. Focusing on the drug, human, and weapons trafficking that gave birth to the carbon-intensive capitalism of the US and UK (responsible in the mid-igth-century for between seventy and eighty percent of emissions) affords a new reading of our current moment of the Anthropocene. While I wholeheartedly agree with scholars who suggest replacing the unmarked humanity (anthropos) of the term Anthropocene with Capitalocene, I name this racial and ecological formation Climate Caucasianism and Colonialism. This allows me to expose an economic logic centered on extraction (of non-white humans and most women, non-living fossils, and living, extra-human nature) and an epistemic logic of what I call \"extra-action\"- the domination of \"inferior\" humans and non-living extractables from outside and above. I show the rapacious \"Superpredation\" necessary to consolidate this planet-endangering project and, following Arturo Escobar, its audacious deforming of language to call it Freedom and Development.\n\nMark W. Driscoll is Professor of East Asian Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He is author of Absolute Erotic, Absolute Grotesque: The Living, Dead, and Undead in Japanese Imperialism, 1805-1945, and the editor and translator of \"Kannani\" and \"Document of Flames\": Two Japanese Colonial Novels.\n\nThe State As Experiment: A Centenary Symposium in Memory of Josef Popper-Lynkeus (1838-1921)\n\n| University of Virginia\n\nThis conference takes the centenary of the death of the Austrian Jewish social philosopher Josef Popper-Lynkeus as a starting point to re-examine the powers and responsibilities of the modern state. Popper-Lynkeus’s writings on the state’s obligation to provide a minimum of food, housing, welfare, and health care became the center of great attention only in his later years and after the collapse of empires. Among his admirers and interlocutors were prominent figures such as Albert Einstein, Bertha Pauli, Sigmund Freud, Franz Oppenheimer, and Rosa Luxemburg. Key ideas driving Popper- Lynkeus’s thought included the principle of free enterprise combined with security for all, and the vision of a criminal justice system concerned with protection rather than punishment. Today, these ideas resonate in intense debates about the role of government—in everything from equity and social justice to infrastructure and public services, especially in light of a pandemic and of repeated violence against marginalized groups. The conference brings together voices from a variety of perspectives to explore the state—famously dubbed by Nietzsche the ultimate “idol” and “coldest monster”—through the lens of social, economic or political reform; ideal and utopian re-imagination; and communitarian, anarchic, and other forms of critique.\n\nProgram of Events\n\nWednesday, April 6\n\n5:00PM, Solarium Room (Colonnade Club):\n\nOpening Keynote: George Steinmetz (University of Michigan):\n\n“The Fall and Rise of Empires and States: Theory and Research in the Human Sciences”\n\nThursday, April 7:\n\nAll panels will take place in New Cabell Hall 236.\n\n9:00-10:30AM: Opening Session: “Imperial States: The Waning of Empires and the Idea of the State.

Gordon Institute for Urban and Minority Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Dr. Rodríguez’s research sits at the intersection of schools, migration, and the formation of racial and national identities in both Latin America and the US. Prior to joining UVA, Dr. Rodríguez worked as a postdoctoral research associate in the Dominican Studies Institute of the City University of New York (CUNY DSI). Dr. Rodríguez completed her Ph.D. in History and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, her M.S. Ed. in Educational Studies at Johns Hopkins University, and her B.A. in History and American Studies at Fordham University. Dr. Rodríguez was also a 2020 dissertation fellow for the National Academy of Education and Spencer Foundation.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a citizen of a country ruled by another? What rights and responsibilities do citizens have in such a context? What role can schools play in the formation of the next generation of citizens? During the turn of the twentieth century, Dominicans across the country were deep in conversation, debating these very questions. Dr. Rodríguez will discuss her book manuscript, Crafting Dominicanidad, an intellectual history that examines how Dominican stakeholders used public schools to articulate and circulate competing notions of Dominican citizenship that were shaped during the US occupation between 1916 and 1924. Using the documents of the US Military Government, Department of Justice and Public Instruction, as well as letters written by concerned parents and community members, Dr. Rodríguez will discuss how Dominicans across the country used this moment to reflect on, discuss, and practice Dominican citizenship.\n\nRegister HERE: https://virginia.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_s0Z4akWwT5O0MNe9o64e5g\n\nGraduate student session to follow: Email CRPES@virginia.edu if you wish to attend.\n\nEarly Modern Workshop, Presentation by Professor S.

Like the Dutch original on which it was based, Ogilby’s book marvels at outlandish Native cultures and exotic flora and fauna, enticing the reader with scores of illustrations, views, and maps. This paper examines how Ogilby altered his edition to describe English America in the midst of a second wave of colonization in North America and the West Indies. It focuses attention on five new images that Ogilby created as well as the new texts that he added to accompany them. Ogilby pictured America as populous, mysterious, and brimming with life--a space that invited a new generation of colonial settlers to give such abundance form and purpose. In doing so, he created an influential vision of a rising English empire in America.\n\nS. Max Edelson is Professor of History at the University of Virginia. He is the author of Plantation Enterprise in Colonial South Carolina (2006) and The New Map of Empire: How Britain Imagined America before Independence (2017). His current book project is titled “Restoration America: Founding Colonies and Making Maps at the Edges of Empire, 1650-1725.”\n\nHistory Colloquium with Professor Justene Hill Edwards\n\nJoin us on Wednesday, February 9th from 3:30 - 5:00PM, for the first session of the history department colloquium series where Professor Justene Hill Edwards will be presenting a paper titled, The Freedman's Bank and the Challenges of Black Economic Equality in Reconstruction America.\"\n\nSign up for the event here, https://virginia.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEvd-6vqD4iGtRWBdieWdTfmfAuRiHUD0It.\n\nAbstract:\n\n\"White philanthropists and bankers contended that they created the Freedman’s Savings and Trust Company with one overarching purpose in mind: to usher former African-American slaves into the postbellum era through formal participation in the financial services industry. Signed into existence by President Abraham Lincoln in March 1865, the Freedman’s Bank represented the promise of the Civil War: full access to citizenship and the dream of capitalist enterprise for former slaves. Though the bank grew quickly, with African American depositors pouring their hard-earned wages into bank accounts, mismanagement by the bank’s white administrators precipitated the bank’s demise. In 1874, a mere nine years after the bank’s founding, the bank closed. The closing devastated a generation of African Americans who were struggling to establish economic stability. Though a small group of scholars have interrogated the Freedman’s Banks’ complicated history and ultimate failure, no historian has fully considered how the bank’s failure shifted African Americans’ relationship to America’s banks and financial institutions—a shift that had generational effects on African Americans. This paper will consider how former slaves’ understandings of capitalism informed their perspective on the Freedman’s Saving and Trust Company. This paper will explore how the Freedman’s Bank ultimately failed to live up to its intended purpose, and in the process, became a startling example for how the American government and the American banking industry perpetuated economic inequality at the precise moment when African Americans were yearning for a ladder to full economic freedom.\"\n\nProfessor Carrie Janney’s Book Talk at New Dominion Book Shop\n\n7pm | New Dominion Book Shop\n\nJoin us as we celebrate the release of Caroline E. Janney’s book Ends of War: The Unfinished Fight of Lee’s Army after Appomattox. This in-person event will be free and open to the public. We recommend arriving early for the best seating.\n\nAbout the Book: In this dramatic new history of the weeks and months after Appomattox, Caroline E. Janney reveals that Lee’s surrender was less an ending than the start of an interregnum marked by military and political uncertainty, legal and logistical confusion, and continued outbursts of violence. Janney takes readers from the deliberations of government and military authorities to the ground-level experiences of common soldiers. Pulitzer Prize–winning author T. J. Stiles called Ends of War “a rich, detailed, and heartrending story of how the Civil War did not end in Wilmer McLean’s parlor at Appomattox Court House.”\n\nAbout the Author: Caroline E. Janney is the John L. Nau III Professor of the American Civil War and Director of the John L. Nau Center for Civil War History at the University of Virginia. A graduate of the University of Virginia, she worked as a historian for the National Park Service and taught at Purdue University before returning to UVA in 2018. An active public lecturer, she has given presentations at locations across the globe. She is the past president of the Society of Civil War Historians and has published seven books, including Remembering the Civil War: Reunion and the Limits of Reconciliation and Ends of War: The Unfinished Fight of Lee’s Army after Appomattox.\n\nEnds of War will be released on September 21.

The majority of our events this year will be held on Zoom and livestreamed on Facebook.\n\nHistorians Adrian Brettle (Colossal Ambitions: Confederate Planning for a Post-Civil War World) and Ann Tucker (Newest Born of Nations: European Nationalist Movements and the Making of the Confederacy) share their deep research into contemporary resources—letters and diaries, domestic and international newspapers, government documents and more—to gain a Confederate nation world view. Their histories trace the earliest stirrings of southern nationalism, the arguments made to define and legitimize the Confederacy, and a vision of future world leadership that failed to resonate outside of the South. This event is hosted by the Nau Center for Civil War History.\n\nhttps://virginia.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Wb0PwQQATp-8jvKZyBjgfw\n\nRegina Bradley (Chronicling Stankonia: The Rise of Hip-Hop South), Adam Gussow (Whose Blues? Facing Up to Race and the Future of Music), and Claudrena Harold (When Sunday Comes: Gospel Music in the Soul and Hip-Hop Eras) discuss the ways that music, history, and race intersect in the creation of American identity, with a focus on blues, southern hip-hop, and late-century gospel music.\n\nAs part of the all-virtual 2021 Virginia Festival of the Book, this event is FREE to attend and open to the public. To attend, please register below or simply make plans to watch on Facebook.com/VaBookFest.

Moore\n\nDepartment of Sociology, Binghamton University\n\nFRIDAY, November, 18\n\n2:00 PM\n\nOPEN GROUNDS\n\nWhere and when do we find the origins of planetary crisis in the 21st century? One’s response to the question shapes the narratives, analytics, and politics of global environmental change. In this talk, environmental historian Jason W. Moore questions the dominant narrative of the Popular Anthropocene that identifies the nineteenth century’s Industrial Revolution as the origins of today’s crisis. He argues instead that the Anthropocene is the Capitalocene – the epoch-making relations of “the” Industrial Revolution were forged much earlier, when modern relations of power, knowledge, and capital expanded rapidly in the centuries after 1450. Their most dramatic expression was a landscape revolution unknown since the dawn of agriculture, reshaping human and extra-human natures at a scale, scope, and speed unthinkable in pre-capitalist civilizations. This dramatic transition cannot be explained through the activity of the “human enterprise” – modern environmental history is driven by capitalogenic – not anthropogenic – forces. Moore argues for seeing the modern world as a world-ecology of power, capital, and nature. In this, modernity’s creativity and destructiveness unfolds through the capacity to channel the paid and unpaid work/energy of humans and the rest of nature in service to endless capital accumulation. That capacity – to find and re/produce Cheap Natures – is now in question.\n\nJason W. Moore, an environmental historian and historical geographer, is associate professor of Sociology at Binghamton University. He is author of several books, mostly recently Capitalism in the Web of Life (Verso, 2015), Ecologia-mondo e crisi del capitalismo: La fine della natura a buon mercato (Ombre Corte, 2015), and editor of Anthropocene or Capitalocene? Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism (PM Press, 2016). He coordinates the World-Ecology Research Network and blogs at https://jasonwmoore.wordpress.com/. Moore is completing Seven Cheap Things: A World-Ecological Manifesto (with Raj Patel) and Ecology and the Rise of Capitalism, both for the University of California Press.\n\n20th Century US History Workshop\n\n2:00 pm | Nau 342\n\nThe 20th Century Workshop will meet to discuss Benji Cohen and Erik Erlandson's prospectuses. (Please see their abstracts below).\n\nBenji Cohen: \"Outsourcing Democracy: The Neoliberalization of Washington, D.C.'s Public Schools, 1970-2014\"\n\nMy dissertation chronicles a radical transformation in urban public education over the last forty years. Focusing on Washington, D.C., I demonstrate the process by which the school system adopted neoliberal education policies. A reform coalition made up of both Republicans and Democrats, business leaders, and independent policy entrepreneurs, managed to take control of Washington’s public schools, emphasizing privatization, choice, efficiency, competition, and the free-market. This shift from traditional public schooling to a neoliberal model has manifested itself through new models like vouchers and charterization, the emergence of non-public influences like Teach for America (TFA), and the reliance upon high-stakes standardized tests\n\nErik Erlandson: \"Redesigning the State: Federal Courts and the Emergence of Reagan's Deregulatory Bureaucracy\"\n\nMy dissertation explores how lawyers, judges, executive officials, and other political actors transformed the legal mechanics of the administrative state to help bring about deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Administrative law, the body of legal rules that governs the bureaucracy, had been dominated by overzealous courts in the preceding two decades. Inspired by the idea that agencies were prone to “capture” by regulated interests and could not be granted broad discretionary authority, federal courts forcefully intervened in the administrative process to ensure that agencies remained accountable to the public writ large. They did so by foisting on administrators an array of new procedural requirements. But judicially-enforced “interest representation” only increased regulatory obligations, and thus clashed with new and wildly popular neoliberal ideas like deregulation. If agencies were to retreat from the private sector and regulate less, courts would have to stop demanding more and more of them.\n\n“Redesigning the State” thus argues that conservative legal thinkers had to empower the bureaucracy vis-à-vis the courts in order to liberate different sectors of the economy. Bureaucratic discretion and deregulation were strange bedfellows because, after years of judicial oversight that amplified administrative obligations, Republican agency staffers desperately needed institutional independence to move in a different direction. Administrators needed courts that would defer to their expertise. In the 1980s a spate of new legal doctrines pushed courts and administrative law in this deferential direction. These doctrines would allow agencies like the Federal Reserve, FTC, and EPA, for instance, to weaken regulatory programs through heightened bureaucratic capacities. On its face deregulation refers to the removal of the state from the private sector, but my project shows that administrative power and market liberalization are not necessarily at odds. The realities of regulation are more complicated than the convenient dichotomy between “markets” and “government” might suggest.\n\n20th Century US History Workshop\n\n2:00 - 3:30pm | Nau 342\n\nMeaghan Beadle and Justin McBrien will present their dissertation prospecti.\n\nAbstracts:\n\nMeaghan Beadle: TBA\n\nJustin McBrien: \"Making the World Safe for Disaster: Cold War Science, Crisis, Environmentalism, and the Globalization of Catastrophe, 1945-1970\"\n\nMy dissertation examines how Americans conceived global environmental risks during the early Cold War era, arguing that an emergent discourse of planetary catastrophism collapsed the distinction between anthropogenic and natural disasters and created a narrative of humanity in a fight against extinction. This frame gives a more synthetic perspective on the relationship between the rise of the military-industrial complex, international modernization programs, and global environmentalism. The concept of planetary catastrophism allowed for the formation of what I call the “Biosecurity State,” an idea of governance premised upon the threat of global environmental risks induced by modern industrial technologies and the promise to contain these threats through rational application of scientific knowledge. Yet in an age of unprecedented technological development and the deep uncertainty regarding its impact on the planet, speculative predictions of potential disasters frequently hid behind a veneer of objective analysis. This uncertainty justified the emergency mentality of the early Cold War state as well as a new crisis-oriented environmentalism embodied in Silent Spring. While often in direct conflict with one another, environmental and social scientists both inside and outside the national security apparatus forged a narrative of the human being as a planetary actor in a fragile system we were threatening to annihilate, a strange paradox of increasing power at the price of increasing vulnerability. This dialectic was nowhere more apparent than in problems concerning the atmosphere during the 1950s, when disputes over weather modification, smog, climate change, nuclear testing, and arid land development converged on the issue of who possessed the right to determine acceptable risks for billions of people across the globe. The experiences of these controversies would influence both expert and public perspectives on the necessity of international modernization programs, effectively globalizing catastrophe in belief and practice. As the acceleration of global capitalist production intensified resource depletion and ecological degradation, concerns about ensuring the continued stability of the system produced the concept of \"sustainable\" development. Scientific experts promoted the idea of the Biosecurity State as a solution to the risks precipitated by globalization, declaring that only they possessed the power to make the world safe for disaster.\n\nThe Grand Strategy of Ronald Reagan\n\n12:30 pm - 2:00 pm | Miller Center\n\nPanel with Hal Brands, Malcolm Byrne, James Graham Wilson\n\nhttp://millercenter.org/events/2014/the-grand-strategy-of-ronald-reagan\n\nThis event will be webcast live.\n\nRonald Reagan has been hailed as one of the nation’s most successful presidents in the realm of foreign affairs. Though he came into office with harsh views of the Soviet Union, he found a way to reach out to the Russians and build a relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev that began to unwind the Cold War. But scholars continue to debate whether Reagan was following a carefully mapped out strategy. Were his foreign policy moves improvised or part of a grand plan? And how did the crises he faced during his time in office, especially Iran-Contra, impact his ability to conduct foreign policy? The Miller Center’s GREAT ISSUES series will kick off a lively debate with three experts on the Reagan years, including HAL BRANDS, assistant professor of History and Public Policy at Duke University; MALCOLM BYRNE, deputy director and director of research at the nongovernmental National Security Archive at George Washington University; and JAMES GRAHAM WILSONfrom the Office of the Historian at the U.S. Department of State.\n\nThis event is part of…\n\nThe Great Issues Series: Under the direction of Miller Center scholar and Associate Professor of Public Policy Guian McKee, the Great Issues program provides scholarly expertise on a wide range of policy issues for the public, the media, and the policy community, with an aim towards increasing public discourse about national and global challenges.\n\nAmb. Ryan Crocker on the U.S. & Iran\n\n7:00 pm | Newcomb Hall Ballroom\n\nAMBASSADOR RYAN CROCKER: The United States and Iran:\n\nWhere Are We Heading?\n\nTuesday, February 11 7:00-8:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Newcomb Hall Ballroom ( U.Va. Web Map)\n\nThe Miller Center and the International Relations Organization at U.Va. will co-host a lecture with AMBASSADOR RYAN CROCKER on the interim nuclear deal with Iran, and the prospects for peace with the U.S. and greater stability in the Middle East.\n\nAmbassador Crocker is the preeminent American diplomat to the Middle East, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, and the 2013 James R. Schlesinger Distinguished Professor at the Miller Center. He holds the U.S. Foreign Service’s highest rank, serving as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012, ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, and ambassador to Pakistan, Syria, Kuwait, and Lebanon. In 2009, President George W. Bush awarded Crocker the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award.\n\nA question-and-answer session will follow this lecture.\n\nCheck out the Facebook page for this event, and let us know if you plan to attend here.\n\nRSVPs are not required, but VIP seating is available by request. Email gage@virginia.edu to reserve your front-row seat for this lecture!\n\nFall Job Market Meeting\n\n3:30 pm | Nau 396\n\nAs Mr. Halliday is the placement director for our department, he is here to help you navigate the academic job search process. Many of you he knows, others he hopes to get to know soon.\n\nWe begin with a meeting together: 1:30 p.m., Friday, September 17. This will take place in the grad student lounge/study room: Nau 396. Students who will not be on the job market this year, but are curious about the basics, are quite welcome to attend\n\nAt this meeting, I will discuss the job application calendar and the things others in the department and I can do to help you. I will also try to answer your questions.\n\nIf you would, please send me an email message telling me:\n\na) whether you plan to be on the job market this year, and would like my help (whether or not you are now in C'ville);\n\nb) whether you plan to attend the meeting; and\n\nc) your stage (ABD—with likely time to completion—or degree in hand; if the latter, please state your current job situation, including number of years on the market).\n\nWe have a section devoted to job placement on our department web pages: http://www.virginia.edu/history/graduate/placement. You must be logged in to use this portion of the site (the department page login is by Netbadge: please see Loren if you have questions about this). This section has useful information about the job search process and links to other resources. The OAH, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and other places contain useful advice and information. The AHA site is especially good: http://www.historians.org/grads/JobMarket.cfm. Some of you may also be familiar with the Academic Jobs Wiki, which is better for gossip and griping than good advice: http://academicjobs.wikia.com/wiki/History_2010-2011. H-Net’s Job Guide and the AHA’s Perspectives and its website are probably the two most important sources for advertisements of job openings.\n\nIf you have not done so already, you should begin immediately to draft the elements most application packages contain: a cover letter, your c.v., and separate statements on your teaching and your research. These statements should be brief (1-2 pages, single-spaced, though adding a space between paragraphs for readability).\n\nCommenting on your letter and c.v. is probably the most important thing I can do to help you. I cannot overemphasize how important a good letter is for your search. You should write and re-write it many times, always looking for ways to tighten it while giving the statement of your work’s significance greater force. You should ask your adviser to comment on one or more versions. I will do so, too. I will have more to say about this in our meeting. I will also discuss mock interviewing and job talks, among other topics. I look forward to seeing you then.\n\nFinally, if you know a graduate student or recent graduate who has not received this message but intends to be on the job market, please let her or him know about this meeting. Please feel free to contact me with any questions."
