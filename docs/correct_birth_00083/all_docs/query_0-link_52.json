The peer exchange was sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The six States met to assess the state-of-practice for the technology, tools, and techniques in designing, verifying, and accepting asphalt mixtures for different layers within the flexible pavement structure, as well as for overlays of different pavements following BMD emerging practices. The peer exchange was held in Schaumburg, Illinois. This summary report focuses on agency motivations for considering BMD, the role of sustainability in BMD practice, implementation challenges, key takeaways, and emerging themes.\n\nNine States from the Rocky Mountain West U.S. gathered for a peer exchange and discussion on implementation activities to support Balanced Mix Design (BMD).
