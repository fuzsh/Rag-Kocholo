Ciudad Rodrigo to Tordesillas\n\nHydrogeology of the Salamanca area, Cattaraugus County, New York\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nZarriello, Phillip J.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe hydrogeology of a 132-sq mi area centered at Salamanca, NY, is summarized in five maps at 1:24,000 scale. The maps show locations of wells and test holes, surficial geology and geologic sections, water-table surface, soil permeability, and land use. The valley-fill aquifer in the Salamanca area serves approximately 7,000 people through two major distribution systems with an average daily pumpage of 1.2 million gal/day. The aquifer, composed of outwash sand and gravel, averages 60 ft in thickness and overlies as much as 200 ft of lacustrine silt and clay. The aquifer is recharged directly from precipitation and through seepage from streams. Average annual recharge to the aquifer from direct precipitation and infiltration of runoff from adjacent hillsides is estimated to be 13 inches or 0.6 million gal/day/sq mi. The glacial features in the Allegheny valley near Salamanca are associated with Illinoian and Wisconsin glaciations. Illinoian features consist of small, isolated exposures of outwash and till emplaced against the valley walls. Wisconsin features deposited during Altonian and Woodfordian Times of the Wisconsin consist mainly of end moraines and valley-train outwash. (USGS)\n\nMOOCs to internationalize Masters. A case study at the University of Salamanca\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPereira, Dolores; Recio, Marian; Perez, Ana Victoria; LÃ³pez, Santiago; Palacios, Esther\n\n2015-04-01\n\nCurrent major objectives of Master's degrees taught at the University of Salamanca are to incorporate multidisciplinary skills and to address international issues. It is important to ensure that students and early career scientists have all of the necessary skills to deal with professional development before career planning whether in academic research, professional practices or alternative careers, whether in Spain or elsewhere. However, many students choose a Master's programme without sufficient understanding of what they might need to deal with. A multidisciplinary degree course at the University of Salamanca, linked to the Institute of Social Studies for Science and Technology, focuses on training potential experts equipped to mediate between participants in science and technology and the wider public. Students participating in this course currently come from Spanish speaking countries. Because the course is taught mainly in Spanish, subsequent outreach might also be confined to Spanish speaking communities. Even so, it is essential to properly explain, at the outset, the aims of the Master's programme and the international potential of the qualification to attract more. Here we propose the use of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) both to help students to know about the content and other details of the Master program before they join in and to internationalize the course to reach more potential interested students in the subject. This will be the first experience implementing MOOCs in the teaching of masters at the University of Salamanca and, if successful, the experience can be applied to other masters and courses in need of students and internationalization.\n\n[Cardiovascular risk, occupation and exposure to occupational carcinogens in a group of workers in Salamanca].\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-SÃ¡nchez, JesÃºs\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIdentify the cardiovascular risk factors in a group of workers in the province of Salamanca, protected by external prevention services, as regards exposure to occupational carcinogens, by sector of activity and gender. An observational descriptive epidemiological study was conducted. The sample selection was by stratified random sampling in each entity. The variables collected by questionnaire were, sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to occupational carcinogens, and cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes), using the clinical-work histories as a source of information. Statistically significant differences were observed in cardiovascular risk according to the exposure to occupational carcinogens (p <0.001), primarily among workers in the industry sector. A total of 32% of the workers in the province of Salamanca was exposed to some occupational carcinogen. Women were more exposed in the service sector and men in the agriculture and livestock sector. Nearly one third of the workers belonging to the external prevention services of the province of Salamanca, were exposed to some kind of occupational carcinogens. The most frequent being biological risks, solvent products, and silica, which were above the national mean of exposure. It is important to consider the exposure to occupational carcinogens in the implementation of interventions in the prevention of cardiovascular risk in the work place.

The city also hosts a large chemical industry, and in past years a major fertilizer industry. All of them followed NORM (naturally occurring radioactive materials) industrial activities, where either raw materials or residues enriched in natural radionuclides are handled or generated, which can have an environmental radiological impact on their environmental compartments (e.g. soils and aquatic systems). In this study, activity concentrations of radionuclides from the 238 U and 232 Th natural series present in superficial urban soils surrounding an industrial complex in Salamanca, MÃ©xico, have been determined to analyse the possible environmental radiological impact of some of the industrial activities. The alpha-particle and gamma-ray spectrometry is used for the radiometric characterization. The results revealed the presence of 10-42, 11-51 and 178-811Bq/kg of 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K, respectively, without any clear anthropogenic increment in relation to the values normally found in unaffected soils. Thus, the radioactive impact of the industrial activities on the surrounding soils can be evaluated as very low, representing no radiological risk for the health of the population.

The aim of the study was to know the most relevant epidemiological features of AGEs produced by Salmonella spp. between 2005 and 2014 in Salamanca (Spain). Descriptive cross-sectional study carried out through review of the clinical microbiologic records at Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca. Culture, isolation, identification and serotyping were performed according to standard methodology. Salmonella was isolated in 1,477 patients, representing 47.7% of all positive stool cultures and 53.3% of all income bacterial AGE. The average prevalence was 42.1 cases/100,000 people per year. The mean age was 23 Â± 28 years and the median 7 years. 40.2% of all isolates occurred in children under 5 years, with an average prevalence of 45.1 cases/ 10,000 people per year. Overall, the most frequently isolated serotype was S. Typhimurium with 57%, followed by S. Enteritidis with 35.8%. The prevalence of Salmonella decreased over time. The group aged 0-4 years had the highest rate throughout the period. However, Salmonella produced the highest percentage of hospitalizations for bacterial AGE. In recent years, S. Typhimurium serotype has replaced S. Enteritidis serotype and predominates in younger patients. It is observed under-reporting of cases of salmonellosis produced in Salamanca despite being mandatory notification of these since 2007.\n\nVillamayor stone (Golden Stone) as a Global Heritage Stone Resource from Salamanca (NW of Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcia-Talegon, Jacinta; IÃ±igo, Adolfo; Vicente-Tavera, Santiago\n\n2013-04-01\n\nVillamayor stone is an arkosic stone of Middle Eocene age and belongs to the Cabrerizos Sandstone Formation that comprising braided fluvial systems and paleosoils at the top of each stratigraphic sequence. The sandstone is known by several names: i) the Villamayor Stone because the quarries are located in Villamayor de ArmuÃ±a village that are situated at 7 km to the North from Salamanca city; ii) the Golden Stone due to its patina that produced a ochreous/golden color on the faÃ§ades of monuments of Salamanca (World Heritage City,1988) built in this Natural stone (one of the silicated rocks utilised). We present in this work, the Villamayor Stone to be candidate as Global Heritage Stone Resource. The Villamayor Stone were quarrying for the construction and ornamentation of Romanesque religious monuments as the Old Cathedral and San Julian church; Gothic (Spanish plateresc style) as the New Cathedral, San Esteban church and the sculpted faÃ§ade of the Salamanca University, one of the oldest University in Europe (it had established in 1250); and this stone was one of the type of one of the most sumptuous Baroque monuments is the Main Square of the its galleries and arcades (1729). Also, this stone was used in building palaces, walls and reconstruction of Roman bridge. Currently, Villamayor Stone is being quarried by small and family companies, without a modernized processing, for cladding of the faÃ§ades of the new buildings until that the construction sector was burst (in 2008 the international economic crisis). However, Villamayor Stone is the main stone material used in the city of Salamanca for the restoration of monuments and, even in small quantities when compared with just before the economic crisis, it would be of great importance for future generations protect their quarries and the craft of masonry. Villamayor Stone has several varieties from channels facies to floodplains facies, in this work the selected varieties are: i) the fine-grained stone\n\n[Personality traits in patients with migraine: a multi-centre study using the Salamanca screening questionnaire].\n\nPubMed\n\nMunoz, Irene; Toribio-DÃ­az, M Elena; Carod-Artal, Francisco J; PeÃ±as-MartÃ­nez, M Luz; Ruiz, Lara; DomÃ­nguez, Elena; Pedraza, M Isabel; Molina, Vicente; Guerrero-Peral, Angel L; Uribe, Fernando\n\n2013-12-16\n\nPsychiatric comorbidity is frequent in cases of migraine and research has focused more on that related to affective disorders and anxiety than to personality traits. To study the presence of personality traits in persons with migraine and how they are related with the presence of chronic migraine or medication abuse. Patients attended consecutively in five centres were evaluated. The 22 questions in the Salamanca screening questionnaire were used to explore 11 personality traits classified in three groups. Data were obtained concerning demographic characteristics and the impact of migraine. The sample used in the study included 164 patients (134 females and 30 males), with a mean age of 36.6 Â± 12.5 years (range: 18-78 years). In most patients, the impact of migraine was high. The personality traits that appeared most frequently were: anxious (53.7%), anankastic (44.5%), histrionic (40.9%) and dependent (32.9%). The risk of chronic migraine was higher in patients with the anankastic trait (relative risk = 2.06; confidence interval at 95% = 1.07-3.94; p = 0.027). Some of the personality traits that can be detected with the Salamanca questionnaire are very common in patients with migraine. In our series, the anankastic trait is related with the presence of chronic migraine.\n\nBioavailability of pollutants in bacterial communities of Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nda Fonseca, E.M.; Neto, J.A. Baptista; McAlister, J.J.; Smith, B.J.; Crapez, M.A.C.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nProcesses involving heavy metals and other contaminants continue to present unsolved environmental questions. To advance the understanding of geochemical processes that involve the bioavailability of contaminants, cores where collected in the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, and analyzed for bacterial activity and metal concentrations. Results would suggest an extremely reducing environment where organic substances seem to be the predominant agents responsible for this geochemical process. Analytical data showed sulphate reduction to be the main agent driving this process, since this kind of bacteria was found to be active in all of the samples analyzed. Esterase enzyme production did not signal the influence of heavy metals and hydrocarbon concentrations and heavy metals were found to be unavailable for biota. However, correlation between results for bacterial biomass and the potentially mobile percentage of the total Ni concentrations would suggest a negative impact.

Continuing the work of Alphons X it initiates the theoretical and practical development of astrology, which anticipates the Copernican revolution. The paper presents a general overview of the teachers of that chair and a summary of the most important texts.\n\nPollen calendar of the city of Salamanca (Spain). Aeropalynological analysis for 1981-1982 and 1991-1992.\n\nPubMed\n\nHernÃ¡ndez Prieto, M; Lorente Toledano, F; Romo Cortina, A; DÃ¡vila GonzÃ¡lez, I; Laffond Yges, E; Calvo BullÃ³n, A\n\n1998-01-01\n\nWe report a study on the contents of airborne pollen in the city of Salamanca (Spain) aimed at establishing a pollen calendar for the city for the yearly periods of maximum concentrations, relating these with quantifiable atmospheric variables over two two-year periods with an interval of 10 years between them: 1981-82 and 1991-92. The pollen was captured with Burkard spore-traps, based on Hirst's volumetric method. Determinations were made daily and were used to make preparations, previously stained with basic fuscin, for study under light microscopy at x 1,000 magnification. 946 preparations were analyzed, corresponding to the same number of days distributed over 150 weeks of the periods studied. The results afforded the identification of 48 different types of pollen grain: Grasses (Poaceae), Olea europea (olive), Quercus rotundifolia (Holm-oak), other Quercus spp. (Q. pyrenaica, Q. suber, Q. faginea, etc.), Cupressaceae (Cupressus sempervivens, C. arizonica, Juniperus communis etc.), Plantago (Plantago lanceolata, Plantago media, etc.), Pinaceae (Pinus communis, Abies alba, etc.), Rumex sp.

Such importance is also perceived in a national level, as demonstrated by the fact that he belonged to the first board of the Spanish Association of Urology and contributed to its foundation in the two-year period 1910--1911, from his position of head of the department of Surgical Therapy and Operations at the Central University. Genitourinary tuberculosis is one of the most outstanding chapters of his extensive works. We reviewed all his works, selecting all original articles about genitourinary tuberculosis. Original articles have been obtained from the journals Revista de Higiene y Tuberculosis, La Medicina Valenciana, Revista Valenciana de Ciencias MÃ©dicas y PolicÃ­nica, and from his two most important books, Clinical Lessons In Urology and Clinical Lessons in Urology and Genitourinary Surgery. Throughout his work he analyzes features of relevance about this disease, such as diagnosis, about which he emphasizes the clinical and bacteriological difficulties, and treatment, which was only feasible by precocious nephrectomy. He dedicates a great part of his work to the study of this pathology and defends a precocious diagnosis in order to perform the only treatment that had demonstrated efficacy. He also exposes the symptoms and variety of clinical presentations, as well as diagnosis through separate kidney catheterization with the aim to determine unilateral involvement.\n\n[Pervasive developmental disorders screening program in the health areas of Salamanca and Zamora in Spain].\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a Primo, P; Santos Borbujo, J; MartÃ­n Cilleros, M V; MartÃ­nez Velarte, M; Lleras MuÃ±oz, S; Posada de la Paz, M; Canal Bedia, R\n\n2014-05-01\n\nTo evaluate the results of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) screening program currently ongoing in the public health services in the health area of Salamanca and Zamora, Spain, in terms of feasibility, reliability and costs, with the purpose of extending the program at regional and national levels. A total of 54 paediatric teams (nurses and paediatricians) from the provinces of Salamanca and Zamora participated in the training sessions for the PDD Screening Programme in September 2005, and agreed to administer the questionnaire M-CHAT(1) to all parents attending their clinics in any of these two visits: 18 months and/or 24 months within the Well-baby Check-up Program. A total of 9,524 children have participated up to December 2012. Additionally, we evaluated the participation and opinions of the paediatric teams using questionnaires, and costs per positive case have estimated. Out of a total of 852 (8.9%) children determined as PDD high-risk with the M-CHAT questionnaire results, 61 (7.1%) were confirmed as positive with the M-CHAT follow-up interview. Of these, 22 were diagnosed with a PDD and 31 other disorders of childhood onset according to DSM-IV-TR(2). Almost three-quarters (74%) of respondents felt the program was totally feasible, and 22% viable, but with reservations (n=54). This study has been able to show for the first time in Spain, the feasibility of a population-based PDD screening program within the public health system. Training in social and communicative development, and dissemination of the early signs of PDD among paediatricians, as well as the use of the M-CHAT, is essential for progress in the early detection of these disorders.

Qualitative research corresponding an exploratory qualitative/structural perspective. Primary Care. Urban area, Salamanca in 2007. Ten discussion groups, 2 composed of members of health-related associations and 8 primary care users, involved a total of 83 people. The structural variables considered are: gender, age, educational level and membership or not associations. Generate information to achieve information saturation in the discussion groups. Upon obtaining their informed consent, all subjects in the study participated in videotaped conversations, which were transcribed verbatim. Four researchers categorized the content, intentionality of discourse and developed the concept map. After categorization, triangulation and coding, content obtained was analysed with the NudistQ6 program. Informative content suggest four information needs: health and prevention, early diagnosis, first aid and disease. Different intentions (information needs, watching, claim and improvement) and needs profiles are detected as structural variables. Major information needs are relate to diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic options. There is agreement between the groups that the information transmitted to the patient must be intelligible, updated and coordinated among the different professionals and care levels. Participants require information of a clinical nature to exercise their right to autonomy translating tendency to empower users as part of the social change.

Descriptive statistics and \"Chi squared\" tests were employed. 72%. A high level of agreement on the need for team work (95.23%). They perceived their group cohesiveness as being very low (84.21% affirmed that they encounter problems of cohesiveness). The main statements concerning this lack of cohesiveness were: \"lack of common objectives\" (25.5%), \"intolerance between workers\" (20.13%), \"work not shared\" (19.46%) and \"the taking of decisions individually\" (19.44%). The main causes given were: lack of support from Management (23.74%) and too little training for team work (21.58%). There is a high degree of conviction that the team work model is the most efficacious way of developing Primary Care. However in three of the four teams questioned, there were serious problems preventing the teams' reaching an adequate level of group cohesiveness.\n\nConcentrating Solar Power Projects - Ibersol Ciudad Real (Puertollano) |\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nOverview Project Name: Ibersol Ciudad Real (Puertollano) Country: Spain Location: Puertollano (Castilla-La Mancha) Owner(s): IBERCAM (Iberdrola Renovables Castilla-La Mancha) (90%) IDAE (10%) Technology : Operational Country: Spain City: Puertollano Region: Castilla-La Mancha Lat/Long Location: 38ÃÂ°38' 36.19&quot\n\nCiudad Juarez: A Feral City Threat on our Doorstep?\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-03-01\n\naware that notwithstanding any other provision of law , no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information...to maximize profit margins.

Students were taught how to evaluate the possible risks associated with the practice of their instruments. They were provided with information about the most frequent medical problems of musicians, warm-up habits, postural hygiene, effective prevention strategies, and different treatment options for these pathologies. The students were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (n=56) who did not take the course and was evaluated with a questionnaire at the beginning of the academic year and 1 year later, and an experimental group (n=90) who did take the course and was evaluated with three questionnaires (at the beginning of the course, 6 months later, and 12 months after the start of the course). While the students in the experimental group improved their body awareness by 91% and the frequency of their injuries decreased by 78%, there was no improvement in the students from the control group at the end of the experiment. The results of our study have demonstrated the effectiveness of this type of course and show that such courses should be included in the academic curriculum of superior conservatories.\n\nExposure Assessment to Environmental Chemicals in Children from Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nOchoa-Martinez, Angeles C; Orta-Garcia, Sandra T; Rico-Escobar, Edna M; Carrizales-YaÃ±ez, Leticia; Del Campo, Jorge D Martin; Pruneda-Alvarez, Lucia G; Ruiz-Vera, Tania; Gonzalez-Palomo, Ana K; PiÃ±a-Lopez, Iris G; Torres-Dosal, Arturo; PÃ©rez-Maldonado, Ivan N\n\n2016-05-01\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the human biomonitoring of susceptible populations is a valuable method for the identification of critical contaminants.

As the murders continue unabated and unsolved, and with the likely complicity of state authorities, they have triggered a dynamic cultural response from writers, filmmakers, singers, and others who deplore the murders while suggesting the underlyingâ¦\n\nAmbient air monitoring plan for Ciudad Acuna and Piedra Negras, Coahuila, Mexico. Final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWinberry, J.; Henning, L.; Crume, R.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe Cities of Ciudad Acuna and Piedras Negras and the State of Coahuila in Mexico are interested in improving ambient air quality monitoring capabilities in the two cities through the establishment of a network of ambient air monitors. The purpose of the network is to characterize population exposure to potentially harmful air contaminants, possibly including sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}), nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}), ozone (O{sub 3}), carbon monoxide (CO), total suspended particulate matter (TSP), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 100 micrometers PM-10, and lead. This report presents the results of an evaluation of existing air quality monitoring equipmentmoreÂ Â» and facilities in Ciudad Acuna and Piedras Negras. Additionally, the report presents recommendations for developing an air quality monitoring network for PM-10, SO{sub 2}, lead, and ozone in these cities, using a combination of both new and existing equipment. The human resources currently available and ultimately needed to operate and maintain the network are also discussed.Â«Â less\n\nGround subsidence and associated ground fracturing in urban areas: InSAR monitoring of active tectonic structures (Ciudad Guzman, Colima Graben - Mexico)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBignami, C.; Brunori, C.; Zucca, F.; Groppelli, G.; Norini, G.; Hernandez, N. D.; Stramondo, S.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThis study focuses on the observation of a creeping phenomenon that produces subsidence of the Zapotlan basin and ground fracturing in correspondence of the Ciudad GuzmÃ n (Jalisco - Mexico). The September 21, 2012, the Ciudad GuzmÃ n has been struck by a phenomenon of ground fracturing of about 1.5 km of length. This event caused the deformation of the roads and the damage of 30 houses, of which eight have been declared uninhabitable. The alignment of fractures is coincident with the escarpments produced in September 19, 1985, in the Ciudad Guzman urban area, when a strong earthquake, magnitude 8.1, struck the Mexican area, causing the deaths of at least 10,000 people and serious damage in Mexico City. In Ciudad GuzmÃ¡n, about 60% of the buildings were destroyed, with about 50 loss of life. The city is located in the Zapotlan basin (northern Colima graben), a wide tectonic depression where the depth of the infilling sediments is about 1 km. This subsidence cannot be measured outside the urbanized area, but it can be considered as a deformation mechanism of the central part of the basin. In order to detect and mapping the spatio-temporal features of the processes that led to this event, we applied InSAR multi-temporal techniques to analyze a dataset of ENVISAT satellite SAR images, acquired in a time span between 2003-2010. InSAR techniques detect a subsidence of the north-western part of Ciudad GuzmÃ n of about 15 mm/yr in the time interval 2003-2010. The displacement occurred in September 21, 2012, was detected using two RadarSAT2 acquisitions (2012-03-22 and 2013-03-17). The explanation of surface movements based on interferometric results, ground data and geological field observations, allowed confirming surface effect due to the overexploitation of the aquifers and highlights a subsidence due to anthropogenic causes coupled to buried tectonic structures.\n\nChemical Equilibrium of the Dissolved Uranium in Groundwaters From a Spanish Uranium-Ore Deposit\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGarralon, Antonio; Gomez, Paloma; Turrero, Maria Jesus\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThe main objectives of this work are to determine the hydrogeochemical evolution of an uranium ore and identify the main water/rock interaction processes that control the dissolved uranium content. The Mina Fe uranium-ore deposit is the most important and biggest mine worked in Spain. Sageras area is located at the north part of the Mina Fe, over the same ore deposit. The uranium deposit was not mined in Sageras and was only perturbed by the exploration activities performed 20 years ago. The studied area is located 10 Km northeast of Ciudad Rodrigo (Salamanca) at an altitude over 650 m.a.s.l. ThemoreÂ Â» uranium mineralization is related to faults affecting the metasediments of the Upper Proterozoic to Lower Cambrian schist-graywacke complex (CEG), located in the Centro-Iberian Zone of the Hesperian Massif . The primary uranium minerals are uraninite and coffinite but numerous secondary uranium minerals have been formed as a result of the weathering processes: yellow gummite, autunite, meta-autunite, torbernite, saleeite, uranotile, ianthinite and uranopilite. The water flow at regional scale is controlled by the topography. Recharge takes place mainly in the surrounding mountains (Sierra Pena de Francia) and discharge at fluvial courses, mainly Agueda and Yeltes rivers, boundaries S-NW and NE of the area, respectively. Deep flows (lower than 100 m depth) should be upwards due to the river vicinity, with flow directions towards the W, NW or N. In Sageras-Mina Fe there are more than 100 boreholes drilled to investigate the mineral resources of the deposit. 35 boreholes were selected in order to analyze the chemical composition of groundwaters based on their depth and situation around the uranium ore. Groundwater samples come from 50 to 150 m depth. The waters are classified as calcium-bicarbonate type waters, with a redox potential that indicates they are slightly reduced (values vary between 50 to -350 mV). The TOC varies between <0.1 and 4.0 mgC/L and the\n\nA long- and short-run analysis of electricity demand in Ciudad Juarez\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMendez-Carrillo, Ericka Cecilia\n\nEconomic growth and appliance saturation are increasing electricity consumption in Mexico. Annual frequency data from 1990 to 2012 are utilized to develop an error correction framework that sheds light on short- and long-run electricity consumption behavior in Ciudad Juarez, a large Mexican metropolitan economy at the border with the United States. The results for this study reveal that electricity is an inelastic normal good in this market. Moreover, natural gas is found to be a weak complement to electricity. With regards to the customer base in this urban economy, population, employment, and income exercise positive and statistically significant impacts on the demand for electricity hook-ups.\n\nShooting Gallery Attendance among IDUs in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico: Correlates, Prevention Opportunities, and the Role of the Environment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPhilbin, Morgan; Pollini, Robin A.; Ramos, Rebecca; Lozada, Remedios; Brouwer, Kimberly C.; Ramos, Maria Elena; Firestone-Cruz, Michelle; Case, Patricia; Strathdee, Steffanie A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe identified factors associated with shooting gallery attendance among injection drug users (IDUs) in two MexicoâUS border cities. IDUs in Tijuana (n = 222) and Ciudad Juarez (n = 205), Mexico, who were â¥18 years and injected illicit drugs in the last month were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). An interviewer-administered survey collected sociodemographic and behavioral data. Logistic regression was used to examine correlates of shooting gallery attendance in each of the two cities. Homelessness and being arrested for syringe possessionâboth structural level factorsâwere associated with shooting gallery use in both cities. In Ciudad Juarez, younger age and having overdosed were also associated with shooting gallery use. Our study highlights the need for structural interventions that mitigate homelessness among IDUs and facilitate changes in law enforcement practices associated with shooting gallery use. Harm reduction interventions based within shooting galleries should also be considered to prevent transmission of blood-borne pathogens among IDUs.

This paper presents a case study which reveals the impact of these types of contamination on the sediment bacterial population. A small stretch of Lerma River Basin, heavily impacted by industrial activities and urban wastewater release, was studied. Due to industrial inputs, the sediments are characterized by strong hydrocarbon concentrations, ranging from 2 935 to 28 430Î¼gÂ·kg(-1) of total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These sediments are also impacted by heavy metals (e.g., 9.6Î¼gÂ·kg(-1) of Cd and 246Î¼gÂ·kg(-1) of Cu, about 8 times the maximum recommended values for environmental samples) and polychlorinated biphenyls (ranging from 54 to 123Î¼gÂ·kg(-1) of total PCBs). The bacterial diversity on 6 sediment samples, taken from upstream to downstream of the main industrial and urban contamination sources, was assessed through TRFLP. Even though the high PAH concentrations are hazardous to aquatic life, they are not the only factor driving bacterial community composition in this ecosystem. Urban discharges, leading to hypoxia and low pH, also strongly influenced bacterial community structure. The bacterial bioprospection of these samples, using PAH as unique carbon source, yielded 8 hydrocarbonoclastic strains. By sequencing the 16S rDNA gene, these were identified as similar to Mycobacterium goodii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas lundensis or Aeromonas veronii. These strains showed high capacity to degrade naphthalene (between 92 and 100% at 200mgÂ·L(-1)), pyrene (up to 72% at 100mgÂ·L(-1)) and/or fluoranthene (52% at 50mgÂ·L(-1)) as their only carbon source on in vitro experiments. These hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria were detected even in the samples upstream of the city of Salamanca, suggesting chronical contamination, already in place longer before. Such microorganisms are clearly potential candidates for hydrocarbon degradation in the\n\nRemoving the Hurdles: A Brief Highlight of Inclusion Challenges in Guyana\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFraser, Sherwin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGlobal policy towards special and inclusive education has seen a shift in the overall approaches used.

Parents of children with respiratory problems were given environment-friendly products intended to replace hazardous products used in the home, as well as information about environmental health. Parents were surveyed before and after to measure the effectiveness of the intervention and to gauge perceptions. There was a significant reduction in hazardous chemical use (eg, cleaning products and pesticides) and breathing problems. While the intervention focused on changing in-home behaviors, open-ended responses revealed that parents were most concerned about outdoor environmental conditions over which they had less control.\n\nUsing evidence on violence and injury prevention for policy development and decision making in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nGutiÃ©rrez, Luis Alberto; Pacheco, Sergio; JuÃ¡rez, Alethia Yurithzi; Palacios, Luis Alexandro; Cerqueira, Maria Teresa\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThis report describes the implementation process and functional structure of the Observatory of Security and Citizen Conviviality of the Juarez Municipality (Observatorio de Seguridad y Convivencia Ciudadanas del Municipio de JuÃ¡rez) in Chihuahua, Mexico, and discusses the most relevant lessons learned and main challenges in the near future. The Observatory, created in 2008, is a joint effort of the Juarez Municipal Government, Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez (Universidad AutÃ³noma de Ciudad JuÃ¡rez), and the Pan American Health Organization. The Observatory's main objective is to propose strategies and public policy recommendations to prevent and control violence and injuries in the Juarez Municipality. Most key federal, state, and local agencies have joined this independent autonomous citizen-based initiative, feed the databases, and benefit from the information produced by a multisectoral, multidisciplinary approach. The Observatory contributes far more than the technical data provided and its facilitating functions. The clear results obtained in such a short time-as seen in the preliminary results of the case study on road injuries from January 2009 to July 2011-demonstrate the appropriateness of this course of action and should stimulate the creation of new observatories whenever and wherever needed. Lessons learned, as discussed here, can open the way to new endeavors, and current challenges show how much work remains to be done.\n\nEfficacy of a Brief Behavioral Intervention to Promote Condom Use Among Female Sex Workers in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMausbach, Brent; Lozada, Remedios; Staines-Orozco, Hugo; Semple, Shirley J.; Fraga-Vallejo, Miguel; Orozovich, Prisci; Abramovitz, Daniela; de la Torre, Adela; Amaro, Hortensia; Martinez, Gustavo; Magis-RodrÃ­guez, Carlos; Strathdee, Steffanie A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nObjectives. We examined the efficacy of a brief behavioral intervention to promote condom use among female sex workers in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Methods. We randomized 924 female sex workers 18 years or older without known HIV infection living in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez who had recently had unprotected sex with clients to a 30-minute behavioral intervention or a didactic control condition. At baseline and 6 months, women underwent interviews and testing for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Results. We observed a 40% decline in cumulative sexually transmitted illness incidence (P = .049) in the intervention group. Incidence density for the intervention versus control groups was 13.8 versus 24.92 per 100 person-years for sexually transmitted illnesses combined (P = .034) and 0 versus 2.01 per 100 person-years for HIV (P < .001). There were concomitant increases in the number and percentage of protected sex acts and decreases in the number of unprotected sex acts with clients (P < .05). Conclusions. This brief behavioral intervention shows promise in reducing HIV and sexually transmitted illness risk behaviors among female sex workers and may be transferable to other resource-constrained settings.

L.; Wilf, P.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nDiverse, well-preserved macroflora are observed within Cretaceous and Paleocene sediments of Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina. These macroflora are the most well preserved early Paleocene flora from Gondwana and add new insight into the diversity and environments of that epoch. Two major sites of fossil preservation, Palacio de los Loros and Parque Provincial Ormachea, sit near the top of the Late Danian (65.5-61.7 Ma) Salamanca Formation. Understanding the depositional history of the Salamanca is important in characterizing paleoenvironments in which these flora lived and relating these Patagonian macroflora to concurrent Paleocene flora within the Gondwanan supercontinent. During a two week field season, twenty stratigraphic sections were measured along the outcrop belt at Palacio de los Loros and Ormachea Park as well as two minor sites; Las Flores, and Rancho Grande. Photo mosaics, laser ranger data, and stratigraphic columns were merged with elevated geologic maps and imported into Fledermaus to generate a 3-D visualization of facies relationships. Rock samples were also collected and will be thin sectioned and analyzed for petrography and grain size. The Salamanca Fm. consists of 7 facies, listed here in stratigraphically ascending order: 1)Transgressive sands, 2)Wispy-bedded claystone, 3)Banco Verde, 4)White Cross bedded sandstone, 5)Accretion set siltstone, 6)Transitional silty claystone and 7)Banco Negro. Based on these facies, the Salamanca Fm. is interpreted as a marine-shelf to brackish, tide-dominated, estuarine deposit. The base of the Salamanca Fm. rests on an unconformity representing a marine flooding surface and lower sections of the Salamanca, facies 1 and 2, contain abundant glauconite and fossils indicative of a marine shelf environment. These facies give way upwards to bi-directional trough cross bedded sandstones interspersed with flaser bedded sandy siltstones (facies 3 and 4) indicating a less marine estuary with strong flow regimes\n\nComparation of Organic and Elemental carbon concentrations in PM2.5 in five Mexican cities: Potencial Sources\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerrera Murillo, J.; Cardenas, B.; Campos-Ramos, A.; Blanco-Jimenez, S.; Angeles-Garcia, F.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nDuring 2006-2010 the National Center for Environmental Research and Training of the National Institute of Ecology of Mexico, carried out several short field studies in the cities of Salamanca, Gto, Tula, Hgo; Guadalajara, Jal; Toluca, Edo Mex; and Tijuana, BC to determine concentration and chemical compositions of PM2.5. These cities, although different in size population have all important industrial and area sources that contribute to high PM2.5 concentrations and therefore potential health impacts. Chemical analyses included organic and elemental carbon for which DRI Model 2001 Thermal/Optical Carbon Analyzer (Atmoslytic Inc, Calabasas, CA, USA) was used. Highest PM2.5 mass mean concentrations were obtained in Salamanca (46 Î¼g/m3), followed by Toluca (43 Î¼g/m3), Guadalajara (37 Î¼g/m3), Tula (20 Î¼g/m3) and Tijuana (18 Î¼g/m3). For Salamanca and Tula, annual levels exceeded the Mexican PM2.5 annual standard of 15 Î¼g/m3. Total carbonaceous aerosol accounted for 41.4%, 41.1%, 32.3%, 29.5% and 29.1% of PM2.5 mass in Tula, Toluca, Guadalajara, Salamanca and Tijuana, respectively. Higher OC2, OC3 and OC4 carbon fractions were observed in Guadalajara, Tijuana and Toluca, indicating an important contribution of gasoline and diesel vehicles emissions in these cities. As for Tula and Salamanca, cities in which refineries and power plants are present, OC3, OC4, EC1 and EC2 represent the higher fractions which could be attributed to stationary sources that use heavy fuels for their combustion process. UNMIX and PMF analyses were used in order to identify the most important sources that contributes to OC and EC concentrations.\n\nPrevalence and correlates of 'agua celeste' use among female sex workers who inject drugs in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorris, Meghan D; Case, Patricia; Robertson, Angela M; Lozada, Remedios; Vera, Alicia; Clapp, John D; Medina-Mora, Maria Elena; Strathdee, Steffanie A\n\n2011-09-01\n\nAgua celeste, or \"heavenly water\", is the street name for a sky-blue colored solvent reportedly inhaled or ingested to produce an intoxicating effect.

Among the CJ sample, lifetime prevalence of AC use was 53%, median age of first use was 16 years (IQR: 14-23), and 10% reported it as their first abused substance. Ever using AC was independently associated with ever being physically abused and younger age, and was marginally associated with initiating injection drug use and regular sex work at age eighteen or younger. Among those ever using AC, 70/166 (42.2%) reported using it within the last 6 months, which was independently associated with using drugs with clients before or during sex, being on the street more than 8h per day, and younger age.

It is part of the Hercynian granitic chain in the Spanish Central System. The stone received the local name \"Piedra Pajarilla\", meaning \"Little Bird Stone\" due to the shape of the many tourmaline aggregates that are the main visual feature of the rock. This local name has been extrapolated to every granitic stone used in the area, even if they differ significantly in mineralogy, and as recently tested in physical and mechanical properties as well. Here we present the nomination of Piedra Pajarilla as a suitable \"Global Heritage Stone Resource\". This stone ideally fits the newly proposed designation as it has been used since Roman times in Salamanca (Spain) and since the Middle Ages in the construction of major historic buildings, including both the Old and New Cathedrals, and many additional churches, castles and walls in the Salamanca area. SalamancÃ¡s historic city core has been granted UNESCO World Heritage status in 1988, and all associated buildings, monuments and pedestrian streets are constructed from original materials. One of utilised materials, Piedra Pajarilla, was quarried for centuries from the immediate area. It was also the preferred building stone of many internationally renowned architects of Spanish origin during the 18th and 19th centuries especially involved in reconstruction following the Lisbon earthquake. Although the associated quarries are no longer active, the Piedra Pajarilla quarry sites remain relatively undisturbed and accessible. A renewal of quarrying is consequently feasible if additional stone supplies are required for heritage restoration. Thus there is also a need to preserve these historic quarries in anticipation of such work. The importance of Salamanca as emblematic heritage makes the historic stone quarries worthwhile to preserve as well. At the same time, Piedra Pajarilla can be considered as the first of several natural\n\n[Oxidative stress, lung function and exposure to air pollutants in Mexican schoolchildren with and without asthma].\n\nPubMed\n\nRomero-CalderÃ³n, Ana Teresa; Moreno-MacÃ­as, Hortensia; Manrique-Moreno, Joel David Francisco; Riojas-RodrÃ­guez, Horacio; Torres-Ramos, Yessica DorÃ­n; Montoya-Estrada, Araceli; Hicks-GÃ³mez, Juan JosÃ©; Linares-Segovia, Benigno; CÃ¡rdenas, Beatriz; BÃ¡rcenas, Claudia; Barraza-Villarreal, Albino\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo assess the association between the air pollutants exposure on markers of oxidative stress and lung function in schoolchildren with and without asthma from Salamanca and Leon Guanajuato, Mexico. We realized determinations of oxidative stress biomarkers and lung function tests in 314 schoolchildren. Information of air pollutants (O3, SO2, CO, PM2.5 and PM10) were obtained from monitoring stations and multiple linear regression models were run to assess the association. An increase of 0.09 pmol in conjugated dienes was observed by exposure to PM10 lag 1 in asthmatics from Salamanca (p<0.05). The exposure to O3 during the same day increased the concentration of Lipohydroperoxides in 4.38 nmol in asthmatics of Salamanca, as well as in 2.31 nmol by exposure to PM10 lag 2 (p<0.05). The forced vital capacity decreased by 138 and 203 ml in children without asthma, respectively, due to exposure to carbon monoxide (p<0.05). Exposure to air pollutants increase oxidative stress and decreased lung function in schoolchildren, with and without asthma.\n\n2nd Iberian Nuclear Astrophysics Meeting on Compact Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPerez-Garcia, M.

This volume contains most of the presentations delivered at this international workshop. This meeting was the second in the series following the previous I Encuentro IbÃ©rico de Compstar, held at the University of Coimbra, Portugal in 2010. The main purpose of this meeting was to strengthen the scientific collaboration between the participants of the Iberian and the rest of the southern European branches of the European Nuclear Astrophysics network, formerly, COMPSTAR. This ESF (European Science Foundation) supported network has been crucial in helping to make a broader audience for the the most interesting and relevant research lines being developed currently in Nuclear Astrophysics, especially related to the physics of neutron stars. It is indeed important to emphasize the need for a collaborative approach to the rest of the scientific communities so that we can reach possible new members in this interdisciplinary area and as outreach for the general public. The program of the meeting was tailored to theoretical descriptions of the physics of neutron stars although some input from experimental observers and other condensed matter and optics areas of interest was also included. The main scientific topics included: Magnetic fields in compact stars Nuclear structure and in-medium effects in nuclear interaction Equation of state: from nuclear matter to quarks Importance of crust in the evolution of neutron stars Computational simulations of collapsing dense objects Observational phenomenology In particular, leading\n\nRifting along the northern Gondwana margin and the evolution of the Rheic Ocean: A Devonian age for the El Castillo volcanic rocks (Salamanca, Central Iberian Zone)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGutiÃ©rrez-Alonso, G.; Murphy, J. B.; FernÃ¡ndez-SuÃ¡rez, J.; Hamilton, M. A.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nExposures of volcanic rocks (El Castillo) in the Central Iberian Zone near Salamanca, Spain, are representative of Paleozoic volcanic activity along the northern Gondwanan passive margin. Alkaline basalts and mafic volcaniclastic rocks of this sequence are structurally preserved in the core of the Variscan-Tamames Syncline. On the basis of the occurrence of graptolite fossils in immediately underlying strata, the El Castillo volcanics traditionally have been regarded as Lower Silurian in age. In contrast, most Paleozoic volcanic units in western Iberia are rift-related mafic to felsic rocks emplaced during the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician, and are attributed to the opening of the Rheic Ocean. We present new zircon U-Pb TIMS data from a mafic volcaniclastic rock within the El Castillo unit. These data yield a near-concordant, upper intercept age of 394.7 Â± 1.4 Ma that is interpreted to reflect a Middle Devonian (Emsian-Eifelian) age for the magmatism, demonstrating that the El Castillo volcanic rocks are separated from underlying lower Silurian strata by an unconformity. The U-Pb age is coeval with a widespread extensional event in Iberia preserved in the form of a generalized paraconformity surface described in most of the Iberian Variscan realm. However, in the inner part of the Gondwanan platform, the Cantabrian Zone underwent a major, coeval increase in subsidence and the generation of sedimentary troughs. From this perspective, the eruption age reported here probably represents a discrete phase of incipient rifting along the southern flank of the Rheic Ocean. Paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that this rifting event was coeval with widespread orogeny and ridge subduction along the conjugate northern flank of the Rheic Ocean, the so called Acadian \"orogeny\". We speculate that ridge subduction resulted in geodynamic coupling of the northern and southern flanks of the Rheic Ocean, and that the extension along the southern flank of the Rheic Ocean is a\n\nCarbon monoxide exposure in households in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, MÃ©xico.\n\nPubMed\n\nMontoya, Teresa; Gurian, Patrick L; VelÃ¡zquez-Angulo, Gilberto; Corella-Barud, VerÃ³nica; Rojo, Analila; Graham, Jay P\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThis study assessed exposure to carbon monoxide from gas and wood heater emissions in a sample of 64 households in peri-urban residential areas in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, MÃ©xico. Indoor and outdoor carbon monoxide concentrations and temperatures were monitored for a continuous period of 1 week at 1 and 6-min intervals, respectively. The moving average carbon monoxide concentrations were compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards for carbon monoxide. Sixty-seven percent of households with gas heaters and 60% of households with wood heaters exceeded a health-based standard at some point during the monitoring. The difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures was modestly correlated with average carbon monoxide exposure (r=0.35, p-value <0.01). Heater type may be a stronger determinant of exposure, as households with a particular heater model (the El Sol FM-210) were significantly more likely to be among the more highly exposed households (odds ratio of 4.8, p-value of 0.02). A variety of health effects were pooled and found at elevated frequency in the households that exceeded the 8-h standard of 9ppm (odds ratio=5.1, p-value=0.031). These results highlight the need for further efforts to identify and mitigate potentially hazardous carbon monoxide exposures, particularly in moderate-income countries with cooler climates.\n\nDisrupted by violence: children's well-being and families' economic, social, and cultural capital in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nHernandez, Alma A; Grineski, Sara E\n\n2012-05-01\n\nSince 2008, Ciudad Juarez (Chihuahua, Mexico) has been undergoing a wave of violence due to a drug war, making the city a difficult environment in which to raise a family. This study uses qualitative methodology that incorporates 16 in-depth interviews with parents of children ages 0-5 years and 9 sets of photos from a subset of interviewed parents. The study explores how families' economic, social, and cultural capital has been disrupted by the violence and how it affects children's well-being. Social and economic capital declined significantly because of the violence as families experienced crime, had increased difficulty finding and maintaining employment, and decreased their interactions outside the home. Interviews also suggested that opportunities to gain cultural capital decreased because of this isolation. Understanding the detrimental effects of violence on families' capital can contribute to understanding children's well-being in violence-stricken communities.\n\nQuaternary alluvial fans of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, northern MÃ©xico: OSL ages and implications for climatic history of the region\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nZÃºÃ±iga de LeÃ³n, David; Kershaw, Stephen; Mahan, Shannon\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAlluvial fans formed from sediments derived from erosion of the JuÃ¡rez Mountains in northernmost MÃ©xico have a significant flood impact on the Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, which is built on the fan system. The northern part of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez is the most active; further south, older parts of the fan, upon which the rest of the city is built, were largely eroded by natural processes prior to human habitation and subsequently modified only recently by human construction. Three aeolian sand samples, collected from the uppermost (youngest) parts of the fan system in the city area, in places where human intervention has not disturbed the sediment, and constrain the latest dates of fan building. Depositional ages of the Quaternary alluvial fans were measured using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) on aeolian sands that have inter-fingered with alluvial fan material. These dates are: a) sample P1, 31 ka; b) sample P2, 41 ka; c) sample P3, 74 ka, between Oxygen Isotope Stages (OIS) 3 to 5. They demonstrate that fan development, in the area now occupied by the city, terminated in the Late Pleistocene, immediately after what we interpret to have been an extended period of erosion without further deposition, lasting from the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. The three dates broadly correspond to global glacial periods, implying that the cool, dry periods may reflect periods of aeolian transport in northern MÃ©xico in between phases that were wetter to form the alluvial fans. Alluvial fan margins inter-finger with fluvial terrace sediments derived from the RÃ­o Bravo, indicating an additional component of fan dissection by RÃ­o Bravo lateral erosion, presumed to be active during earlier times than our OSL ages, but these are not yet dated. Further dating is required to ascertain the controls on the fan and fluvial system.\n\nReducing harm from HIV/AIDS misconceptions among female sex workers in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico: A cross sectional analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRobertson, Angela M; Ojeda, Victoria D; Nguyen, Lucie; Lozada, Remedios; MartÃ­nez, Gustavo A; Strathdee, Steffanie A; Patterson, Thomas L\n\n2012-08-06\n\nHIV prevalence is increasing among female sex workers (FSWs) in Mexico's Northern border region, who experience multiple occupational risks. Improving vulnerable populations' education, empowerment, and access to preventive services are important components of harm reduction strategies. Given the increasing interest in adapting harm reduction principles from drug use to sex work and other public health responses to the HIV epidemic, we used a sex work harm reduction framework to guide our investigation of FSWs' HIV knowledge. From 2004-2006, FSWs aged â¥18âyears in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez participated in a behavioral intervention study and completed structured interviews. Measures included HIV knowledge assessment and factors within each domain of our theoretical framework for sex work harms: (1) socio-demographic factors that may lead to sex work, (2) sex work characteristics and behaviors that may lead to harm, and (3) mutually reinforcing harms that lead to sex work and result from it (e.g., drug abuse). Negative binomial regression identified factors independently associated with suboptimal HIV knowledge (i.e., incorrect responses during the HIV knowledge assessment). Among 924 FSWs, the median proportion of incorrect responses was nearly one third (28% incorrect). Examination of item responses revealed misconceptions regarding specific transmission and prevention mechanisms, including prevention of mother to child transmission. Suboptimal HIV knowledge was independently associated with older age, lower education, living in Tijuana (vs. Ciudad Juarez), inconsistent condom use for vaginal sex with male clients, and lacking prior HIV testing. Our application of a sex work harm reduction framework to the study of FSWs' HIV knowledge is an important first step in enhancing HIV prevention efforts in Northern Mexican border cities.

This work focuses on fractal analysis of pollutant concentration in Salamanca, Mexico. The city of Salamanca has been catalogued as one of the most polluted cities in Mexico. The main causes of pollution in this city are fixed emission sources, such as chemical industry and electricity generation. Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Particulate Matter less than 10 micrometer in diameter (PM10) are the most important pollutants in this region. Air pollutant concentrations were investigated by applying the box counting method in time series obtained of the Automatic Environmental Monitoring Network (AEMN). One year of time series of hourly average concentrations were analyzed in order to characterize the temporal structures of SO2 and PM10.\n\nUniversity of Maryland MRSEC - Research: IRG2\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nmicroscopy.

J.; Mateos, J.\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe 19th International Conference on Electron Dynamics in Semiconductors, Optoelectronics and Nanostructures (EDISON'19) was held at the HospederÃ­a Fonseca (Universidad de Salamanca, Spain), on 29 June - 2 July, 2015, and was organized by the Electronics Area from the University of Salamanca. The Conference is held biannually and covers the recent progress in the field of electron dynamics in solid-state materials and devices. This was the 19th meeting of the international conference series formerly named Hot Carriers in Semiconductors (HCIS), first held in Modena in 1973. In the edition of 1997 in Berlin the name of the conference changed to International Conference on Nonequilibrium Carrier Dynamics in Semiconductors, keeping the same acronym, HCIS; and finally in the edition of Montpellier in 2009 the name was again changed to the current one, International Conference on Electron Dynamics in Semiconductors, Optoelectronics and Nanostructures (EDISON). The latest editions took place in Santa Barbara, USA, in 2011 and Matsue, Japan, in 2013. Research work on electron dynamics involves quite different disciplines, and requires both fundamental and technological scientific efforts. Attendees to the conference come mostly from academic institutions, belonging to both theoretical and experimental groups working in a variety of fields, such as solid-state physics, electronics, optics, electrical engineering, material science, laser physics, etc. In this framework, events like the EDISON conference become a basic channel for the progress in the field. Here, researchers working in different areas can meet, present their latest advances and exchange their ideas. The program of EDISON'19 included 13 invited papers, 61 oral contributions and 73 posters. These contributions originated from scientists in more than 30 different countries. The Conference gathered 140 participants, coming from 24 different countries, most from Europe, but also with a significant participation\n\nCan We Defend the Defense Supply Chain Lessons Learned from Industry Leaders in Supply Chain Management\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2018-03-01\n\nDirectorate for Information Operations and Reports, 1215 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 1204, Arlington, VA 22202-4302, and to the Office of Management and...chain, including products, services, information , finances, demand, relationships, and risks.

A cross-sectional study conducted on a representative sample of schoolchildren aged 6 to 12 years, using a questionnaire to determine their general dietary habits and a record of their 24-hour intake. A total of 1142 schoolchildren were included, with 612 boys (53.6%) and 530 girls (46.4%), and a mean age of 9.3 Â± 1.7 years of age. The frequency of food intake was 4.62 Â± 0.6 times a day, which decreased with the age of the schoolchildren (P=.044), and increased with the educational level of parents (P=.004). Food preference influenced the choice in the meals consumed. The level of appetite was related directly with weight and body mass index (BMI) (P<.001), age (P=.02), and number of daily food intakes by the children (P=.038). The food groups most frequently consumed were cereals and their derivatives (92.8%), milk and dairy products (90.45%), while vegetables were the least consumed (35.46%). Over 70% of the sample usually consumed olive oil. The dietary pattern of the school population maintains some of the features of traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern, such as the habit of daily breakfast, the greater consumption of olive oil and cereals. On the other hand, other characteristics are remarkable, such as the low consumption of fruit and vegetables and the high consumption of meat. Copyright Â© 2015 AsociaciÃ³n EspaÃ±ola de PediatrÃ­a.

More specifically, this study investigates the influence of land use, density, traffic and socio-economic characteristics. This cross sectional study is based on pedestrian injury collision data that were collected by the Municipal Transit Police during 2008-2009. This research presents an analysis of vehicle-pedestrian collisions and their spatial risk determinants using mixed methods that included (1) spatial/geographical information systems (GIS) analysis of pedestrian collision data and (2) ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to explain the density of pedestrian collisions data. In our model, we found a higher probability for pedestrian collisions in census tracts with population and employment density, large concentration of commercial/retail land uses and older people (65 and more). Interventions to alleviate this situation including transportation planning such as decentralisation of municipal transport system, investment in road infrastructure - density of traffic lights, pedestrian crossing, road design, improves lane demarcation. Besides, land use planning interventions should be implemented in commercial/retail areas, in particular separating pedestrian and vehicular spaces.\n\nA Cultural Historical Activity Theoretical (CHAT) Framework for Understanding the Construction of Inclusive Education from Turkish Teachers' and Parents' Perspectives\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKilinc, Sultan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInclusive education has become a global movement through the policies of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (e.g., Salamanca Statement).

An observational, descriptive study evaluating 3,140 subjects attending the endocrinology unit of Centro MÃ©dico Orinoco in Ciudad BolÃ­var, Venezuela, from 7 January 2013 to 9 December 2016. The index cases were selected using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria. Plasma lipid levels were measured, and a molecular analysis was performed by DNA sequencing of the LDLR and APOB genes. Ten (0.32%) of the 3,140 study patients had clinical and biochemical characteristics consistent with FH. All but one were female. Three had first-degree relatives with prior premature coronary artery; and none had a personal history of this condition. Three patients were obese; three had high blood pressure; and no one suffered from diabetes. Three patients had a history of tendon xanthomas, and one of corneal arcus. LDL-C levels ranged from 191 to 486mg/dL. Two patients were on statin therapy. The genetic causes of FH were identified in four patients, and were LDLR gene mutations in three of them and an APOB gene mutation in exon 26 in the other. Approximately, one out of every 300 people attending this endocrinology unit in those four years had FH, and LDLR gene mutations were the most prevalent cause. Copyright Â© 2017 SEEN.

A cross-sectional survey of FSWs and their non-commercial male partners was conducted in Tijuana and Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Mexico (2010-2011). Eligible FSWs and verified non-commercial partners were aged â¥18 years; FSWs had ever used hard drugs (lifetime) and recently exchanged sex for money, drugs or other goods (past month). Participants underwent baseline questionnaires obtaining dates of sex and condom use with â¤5 other recurring partners, including FSWs' regular clients. These dates were compared with dates of sex with enrolled study partners to determine overlap (ie, 'recurring' concurrency). Bivariate probit regression identified recurring concurrency correlates. Among 428 individuals (214 couples), past-year recurring concurrency prevalence was 16% and was higher among women than their non-commercial male partners (26% vs 6%). In 10 couples (5%), both partners reported recurring concurrency. The majority of couples (64%) always had unprotected sex, and most of the individuals (70%) with recurring concurrency 'sometimes' or 'never' used condoms with their concurrent partners. Recurring concurrency was positively associated with FSWs' income, men's caballerismo (a form of traditional masculinity) and men's belief that their FSW partners had sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Recurring concurrency, representing sustained periods of overlapping partnerships in which unprotected sex was common, should be addressed by couple-based STI prevention interventions.\n\nThe Spanish Blue Division\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2005-03-18\n\nthat is, Regiments Rodrigo, Pimentel , Esparza, and Vierna.

A total of 1281 patients with a diagnosis of gunshot wounds were admitted to the hospital; 402 of them were included in this study with 559 fractures; 329 were males and 73 females. Of the 559 fractures, 257 involved the upper limb, 294 the lower limb, and 8 the pelvis. Gunshot wounds-related fractures were classified according to the Gustilo classification. Seventy-nine patients had grade I fractures, 302 grade III, and 21 patients had both grades. Conservative treatment was used in 44.3% of fractures and osteosynthesis in 55%. One patient underwent amputation upon admission. The most widely used osteosynthesis methods were external fixator (37%), straight plates (21%) and intramedullary nail (17%). Five patients (1.3%) underwent amputation: two with femur fracture and 3 with humeral fracture. There were 27 deep infections (6%); one of them resulted in late amputation of the pelvic limb. The most common associated injuries included: chest injuries in 20 patients and abdominal injuries in 17. The range of hospital stay was 1-18 days, with a mean stay of 11 days. The overall mortality rate considering the total number of patients admitted (1,281) was 99 patients (7.72%).

Positive changes were seen in the overall before and after COOP/WONCA scores, with a mean change from 23.16 to 21.94, with statistical significance, pâ¤0.002. In the psychology groups, it changed from 28.14 to 23.57 with a pâ¤0.05, and healthy eating from 22.81 to 20.85, with pâ¤0.03. In the health education groups it changed from 21 to 20.81 points, and in memory training from 23.31 to 22.45 points (both without significance). The significant improvement in scores reflects a positive change in self-perceived health of this community after the intervention and proper operation of programs. The areas directly related to health and interventions in psychology and nutrition-exercise, are those with the most significant changes.
