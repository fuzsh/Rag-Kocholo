Immensely grateful to the director of the museum Rosa María Castells for the invitation and the warm welcome. Interesting ideas for new cultural collaboration projects with Lithuania have been discussed, looking forward working on it...\n\nThe Alicante Museum of Contemporary Art (MACA) opened in 1977  thanks to the work of Eusebio Sempere (3 April 1923 – 10 April 1985), sculptor, painter, and graphic artist born in Alicante,  whose abstract geometric works make him the most representative artist of the Kinetic art movement in Spain and one of Spain’s foremost artists.\n\nThe museum houses an important collection of 20th century art mostly comprised of works donated by Eusebio Sempere. There are also works by Chillida, Picasso, Dalí and Miró, among others.\n\n+ info: @macaalicante \n\n#art #contemporaryart #maca #alicante #spain\".",
