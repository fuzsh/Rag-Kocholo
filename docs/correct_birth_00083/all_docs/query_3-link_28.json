        "text": "This work shows a protective function of CB2 from neurons and lymphocytes on spontaneous neuropathic pain and the involvement of these cell populations in CB2-induced antinociception, as revealed by increased self-administration of the CB2 agonist JWH133 in mice defective in lymphocyte and neuronal CB2. Previous works already demonstrated antinociceptive and emotional-like effects of CB2 agonists in rodent models of acute and chronic pain (Gutierrez et al., 2011; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Jafari et al., 2007; La Porta et al., 2015; Maldonado et al., 2016). Our results provide evidence that the effect of the CB2 agonist is sufficient to promote drug-taking behavior in nerve-injured mice for alleviation of spontaneous pain, but it is void of reinforcing effects in animals without pain, suggesting the absence of abuse liability. This absence of reinforcement adds value to the modulation of pain through CB2 agonists, since current available agents for neuropathic pain treatment have reduced efficacy and often show addictive properties in humans and rodents (Attal and Bouhassira, 2015; Bonnet and Scherbaum, 2017; Bura et al., 2018; Finnerup et al., 2015; Hipólito et al., 2015; O'Connor et al., 2011).\n\nA previous work using the CB2 agonist AM1241 showed drug-taking behavior and antinociception in nerve-injured rats (Gutierrez et al., 2011), although a recent multicenter study demonstrated off-target effects of this drug (Soethoudt et al., 2017). The disruption of JWH133 effects observed in constitutive knockout mice confirms that the relief of spontaneous pain and the effects reducing mechanical nociception and anxiety-like behavior are mediated by CB2 stimulation. However, the CB2 agonist partially preserved its effects promoting drug self-administration and relieving thermal hypersensitivity in CB2KO mice, suggesting that JWH133 may also act through other receptors. Our results with the nerve-injured TRPA1 knockout mice revealed that JWH133 preserves its efficacy inducing antinociception in the absence of this receptor. Therefore, TRPA1 does not seem to play a relevant role in the antinociceptive response induced by JWH133 in our model of neuropathic pain mice. Interestingly, TRPA1 deletion prevented the development of thermal hyperalgesia after the nerve injury in our study and formalin (0.5%) evoked nocifensive behaviors are also lost in the TRPA1 knockout (McNamara et al., 2007). Another possibility is a minor involvement of CB1 receptor in JWH133 self-administration after the nerve injury, since this compound is a selective CB2 agonist that exhibited 40-fold higher affinity for mouse CB2 than for CB1 receptor (Soethoudt et al., 2017). Our experiments were not designed to rule out this possible minor participation. However, the inactive responding in the operant self-administration sessions was similar after JWH133 or vehicle in nerve-injured mice, indicating an absence of primary CB1-related side effects such as motor alteration that are classical effects observed in mice after the administration of CB1 agonists (Rodríguez de Fonseca et al., 1998). Previous works using higher equivalent doses of a CB2 agonist with similar potency (Soethoudt et al., 2017) showed also absence of motor impairment in nerve-injured rats (Gutierrez et al., 2011). Since JWH133 selectivity for human CB2 vs. human CB1 is higher (153-fold selectivity), we do not foresee any concern with CB1-related behavioral effects using similar molecules in humans.\n\nNerve-injured mice defective in neuronal CB2 showed higher JWH133 intake than wild-type littermates, indicating persistence of drug effects and increased spontaneous pain when neurons do not express CB2. Thus, increased self-administration suggests an enhanced affective-motivational component of pain and not reduced drug efficacy on this aspect, since nerve-injured C57BL6/J mice exposed to the low JWH133 dose did not show compensatory increased self–administration (Figure 1). Importantly, mechanical and thermal neuropathic hypersensitivity before drug self-administration were similar in neuronal knockouts and their wild-type littermates, which suggests different mechanisms of spontaneous pain and evoked nociception. In addition, mechanical nociception measured after JWH133 was more severe in neuronal CB2 knockouts than in wild-type littermates, which indicates decreased JWH133 efficacy on mechanical antinociception. Several studies described the presence of CB2 mRNA and functional CB2 receptor in neuronal populations from different areas of the rain (Stempel et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). However, other works using targeted expression of fluorescent proteins under the control of the mouse gene Cnr2 failed to describe CB2 expression in neurons (López et al., 2018; Schmöle et al., 2015a). Our results agree with a role of neuronal CB2 during painful neuroinflammatory conditions, a setting that was not studied before in mice defective in neuronal CB2. Although we cannot provide a precise localization of the neurons involved in the increased spontaneous and evoked pain of neuronal knockout mice, the similar JWH133 response of CB2 Nav1.8 Cre+ mice lacking CB2 in primary afferent neurons (Nav1.8-Cre+) and wild-type mice could indicate involvement of a different set of neurons or increased relevance of CB2 from immune sources. Thermal hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behavior measured after self-administration was similar in neuronal knockouts and wild-type mice, which indicates involvement of non-neuronal cell populations. However, it should also be considered that the neuronal knockout mice had higher JWH133 consumption. Thus, a possible lack of efficacy could also be present for thermal antinociception and inhibition of anxiety-like behavior. Although a neuronal involvement was found, CB2 neuronal knockouts did not recapitulate the phenotype of mice constitutively lacking CB2, suggesting additional cell types involved in the effects of CB2agonists.\n\nWe investigated the effects of JWH133 promoting its own consumption and inducing antinociception and anxiolysis in CB2 LysM-Cre+ mice, mainly lacking CB2 in monocytes, the precursors of microglial cells. We did not observe a microglial participation in these pain-related phenotypes, which may be due to an incomplete deletion of CB2 in microglia through LysM-driven Cre expression (Blank and Prinz, 2016). Previous studies in mice constitutively lacking CB2 described an exacerbated spinal cord microgliosis after nerve injury (Nozaki et al., 2018; Racz et al., 2008), which suggested a relevant role of CB2 controlling glial reactivity. Since spinal microgliosis participates in the increased pain sensitivity after a neuropathic insult and macrophages and microglia express CB2, blunted effects of JWH133 were expected in microglial CB2 knockouts. However, monocyte-derived cells did not seem to be involved in the analgesic effects mediated by the exogenous activation of CB2 in these experimental conditions.\n\nThe immunohistochemical analysis of dorsal root ganglia from mice transplanted with bone marrow cells of CB2GFP BAC mice (Schmöle et al., 2015a) revealed a pronounced infiltration of immune cells expressing CB2 in the dorsal root ganglia after nerve injury. Macrophages and lymphocytes expressing CB2 were found at a time point in which nerve-injured mice present mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity and self-administer compounds with demonstrated analgesic efficacy (Bura et al., 2013; Bura et al., 2018). Interestingly, GFP expression was also found in neurons, suggesting a transfer of CB2 from peripheral immune cells to neurons. An explanation for this finding may come from processes of cellular fusion or transfer of cargo between peripheral blood cells and neurons (Alvarez-Dolado et al., 2003; Ridder et al., 2014). Bone-marrow-derived cells fuse with different cell types in a process of cellular repair that increases after tissue damage. These events may be particularly important for the survival of neurons with complex structures that would otherwise be impossible to replace (Giordano-Santini et al., 2016). Alternatively, extracellular vesicles drive intercellular transport between immune cells and neurons (Budnik et al., 2016). Earlier studies showed incidence of fusion events between bone-marrow-derived cells and peripheral neurons in a model of diabetic neuropathy (Terashima et al., 2005), and similar processes were observed in central neurons after peripheral inflammation (Giordano-Santini et al., 2016; Ridder et al., 2014). Functional contribution of these mechanisms to neuronal CB2 expression has not yet been explored, although cargo transfer between immune cells and neurons could modify neuronal functionality and it could offer novel therapeutic approaches to modulate neuronal responses (Budnik et al., 2016). Hence, CB2 coming from white blood cells and present in neurons could be significant modulators of spontaneous neuropathic pain and may be contributors to the analgesic effect of CB2 agonists.\n\nOur results suggest participation of lymphoid cells on spontaneous neuropathic pain, but not on basal neuropathic hypersensitivity, highlighting possible differences on the pathophysiology of these nociceptive manifestations. In addition, lymphoid cells were essential for the effects of JWH133 alleviating mechanical sensitivity after a nerve injury. These hypotheses were evaluated by using anti-ICAM1 antibodies that impair lymphocyte extravasation. Previous studies revealed that anti-ICAM1 treatment inhibited opioid-induced antinociception in a model of neuropathic pain (Celik et al., 2016; Labuz et al., 2009). According to the authors, stimulation of opioid receptors from the immune cells infiltrating the injured nerve evoked the release of opioid peptides that attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity. Lymphocyte CB2 could also be involved in the release of leukocyte-derived pain-modulating molecules. Experiments assessing the function of ICAM1 (Celik et al., 2016; Deane et al., 2012; Labuz et al., 2009) showed the participation of this protein on lymphocyte extravasation. In agreement, we observed a decrease of T cell markers in the dorsal root ganglia of mice receiving anti-ICAM1. Anti-ICAM1 treatment also increased the mRNA levels of the B cell marker CD19 in the dorsal root ganglia. Since ICAM1-interacting T cells show activity limiting B cell populations (Deane et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2006), it is likely that the absence of T cells in the nervous tissue increased infiltration of B lymphocytes. B cells are involved in the severity of neuroinflammatory processes and have been linked to pain hypersensitivity (Huang et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Interestingly, CB2 receptors restrict glucose and energy supply of B cells (Chan et al., 2017), which may alter their cytokine production as previously described for macrophages and T cells. However, the participation of CB2 from B cells on neuropathic pain has not yet been established. Our results indicate an increase in JWH133 consumption that could be driven by an increased infiltration of B cells. Overall, the results with the ICAM-1 experiment suggest a relevant participation of lymphoid CB2 on painful neuroinflammatory responses. Our data also underscore the interest of investigating the role of lymphoid cells in brain regions involved in pain, anxiety or negative reinforcement during chronic neuroinflammatory processes.\n\nWhile we identify CB2-expressing neurons and lymphocytes as cellular entities involved in spontaneous and evoked neuropathic pain, the efficacy of the CB2 agonist eliciting its own self-administration to alleviate pain was only disrupted in constitutive CB2 knockout mice. These results indicate that the cell types involved in the negative reinforcement induced by JWH133 were suboptimally targeted in our experimental conditions, probably because different cell types expressing CB2 are involved in this phenotype. Vascular cells may represent alternative participants of this behavior since JWH133 showed local vasodilatory effects (McDougall et al., 2008) and endothelial functional CB2 receptor was found in cerebral microvasculature (Ramirez et al., 2012; Onaivi et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the contribution of neurons and lymphocytes to the effects of CB2 agonists on spontaneous and evoked pain suggests a coordinated response of both cell types after the nerve injury. CB2-expressing lymphocytes could participate in pain sensitization through release of pain-related molecules and the observed responses are also compatible with transfer of CB2 between immune cells and neurons. Hence, bone-marrow-derived cells may provide a source of functional CB2 that was not considered before and could clarify the controversial presence of these receptors in neurons. Nociceptive and affective manifestations of chronic neuropathic pain are therefore orchestrated through neuronal and immune sites expressing CB2, highlighting the functional relevance of this cannabinoid receptor in different cell populations."
