He was part of the Spain Davis Cup team that won the finals in 2008, 2009, and 2011. He won the Paris Masters in 2012, and he was runner-up at six Masters tournaments as well as the Tennis Masters Cup in 2007.\n\nHe is widely considered one of the best players not to have won a Grand Slam tournament.
