        "text": "Her tears traveled the world when Ilie Nastase, former number one and then captain of his country tennis team, insulted her in a Fed Cup tie between Romania and Great Britain. The violence received left her crying and with a nervous breakdown for almost half an hour before the match ended. She was playing a match against the local Sorana Cirstea. Then he would be expelled.\n\nWe are talking about Johanna Konta. Born in Sydney twenty-seven years ago, of Hungarian parents, she became a British citizen in May 2012 and, since then, she represents Great Britain. Alternating her residence in Spain because there lives her coach Esteban Carril.\n\nAmong her most important triumphs there are two against Muguruza (one in the US Open), Halep (in Wuhan), Petkovic, Makárova and Wozniacki. But, in 2016, she defeated Venus Williams and Shuai Zhang and reached semifinals of the Australian Open in which until that time was her best performance in Grand Slams (losing to Kerber). The following year she would reach the same instance in the All England.\n\nShe is the biggest hope for the British tennis. Because more than four decades have passed since a local won Wimbledon (Virginia Wade lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish in ’77).\n\nShe holds three titles in the circuit and three finals. And came to reach the No. 7 in the WTA ranking.\n\nShe says that the main reason to play tennis is because she wants to be part of the history, but that she prioritizes her health and her family.\n\nAn interesting life wherever you look at it. Another excuse to visit the tournament.\n\nWhat is it that attracts such a prestigious site as Sports Illustrated to feature as the main character of an edition of the magazine the number 116 in the WTA world ranking?\n\nShe is beautiful and brazen. Born in Quebec 25 years ago. With 18 years of age, she won Wimbledon by defeating Elina Svitolina, she became the first Canadian to win a Grand Slam in singles (female junior). Two years later she would lose the seniors final against Petra Kvitová.\n\nShe never goes unnoticed. Above all, in social media. Like last year where a provocative publication went viral, she was posing next to a sculpture of the torso of a man with the quote: “457 days without sex”.\n\nThen she clarified that it was a joke: “It’s a meme, relax.” But that did not matter to her more than 1.5M followers around the world, that generated countless comments.\n\nIn 2014 she had her best year on the circuit: semi-finals of Australian Open and Roland Garros and, finals of Wimbledon. She took the 5th spot of the WTA rankings.\n\nNow she is provoking from covers of magazines, social media and her life as model. She was out of the top 100 for almost a year, although in the last one she managed to play more than ten tournaments of the circuit (her best outcome was semifinals in Gstaad).\n\nHolding only one title (Nürnberg) achieved, too, five years ago.\n\nIn the US Open 2015, a slip in the showers caused a fall with concussion that continues in the courts after having denounced the organization. This episode gave her another media ‘boom’ with exponential results.\n\nAnother impact was when “Genie” had an appointment with a fan who made a bet during the Super Bowl in 2017 between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons. She was one of the millions of people around the world watching the event. When Atlanta crushed his rival, a follower proposed a curious bet: “Would you have a date with me if the Patriots win?” She accepted. Finally, New England ended up winning the Super Bowl, so she had to keep her promise.\n\nHer weak performance on a tennis court cost her the sponsors, such as Colgate, Aviva (insurance) and Usana (nutrition). Nike no longer designs exclusive models and gives her merchandise related only to her results.\n\nAfter hiring coaches and advisors like Jimmy Connors, Thomas Hogstedt and Nick Saviano required, in 2016, the services of Gil Reyes, the physical trainer who stayed with André Agassi throughout his professional life.\n\nBut, only last year, she tried four successive coaches.\n\nHis last virtual “madness” was celebrating last Christmas with a family mannequin challenge, directed by Beatrice, her twin sister.\n\nIt’s about Eugenie Bouchard. And she will participate in Abierto Mexicano de Tenis Telcel presented by HSBC. Will Acapulco be the place where Genie will shine once again under the spothlights of the tennis elite?\n\nThe issue has been debated for the past few years, but if it continues like this, Novak Djokovic will be able to raise his hand alone as the greatest. On Sunday night, the 31-year-old Serbian showed his extraordinary come back by winning the Australian Open for the seventh time after defeating Rafael Nadal 6-3, 6-2 and 6-3.\n\nNadal´s 25th Grand Slam made believe his fans that finally he would have the opportunity to end the negative streak of seven consecutive losses against Djokovic on hard court. However, what happened in episode 53 of the greatest rivalry of the Open Era, favor only one side.\n\nOf the seven finals he has played in the Rod Laver Arena, it can be said that this was the most comfortable victory of his record in Melbourne, only losing eight games. So far, the best outcome in the first Grand Slam of the year, was the 2011 final against Andy Murray, when he lost nine games.\n\nNadal, on the other side, suffered the biggest loss in a Grand Slam final and his first fall in straight sets. The record of this rivalry is 28- 25 in favor of the Serbian. Nadal has not beaten the Serbian on a hard court since the 2013 final of the US Open.\n\nAfter sharing for a year the record for most Australian Open titles with Roy Emerson and Roger Federer, Djokovic now takes the lead in solo, while his 15 ‘majors’ place him two from Nadal and five from Federer. This victory also breaks the tie he had with the idol of his childhood, Pete Sampras, whose 14 Grand Slam titles were the record number of men’s tennis, until Federer imposed his marks.\n\nPassing the 30-year-old mark, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have won 9 of the last Grand\n\nDjokovic, the youngest with 31 years of age, looks more driven that ever, which makes us wonder, how long will it take for the Serbian to take Roger’s title of the GOAT?\n\nWhen Novak won Roland-Garros three years ago, he became the first player in 47 years to get all four Grand Slam titles at once. With the victories in Wimbledon, US Open and now the Australian Open, Novak Djokovic will start as the main favorite in the tournament where Rafael Nadal is absolute king.\n\nIf he repeats what happened in Paris, he will do everything in his power to avoid what happened in 2016: it took seven Grand Slam for him to raise a trophy again (Wimbledon, 2018).\n\nHowever, with the level that he has demonstrate, it is difficult that this will happen again.\n\nWhen it was his turn to speak at the ceremony and after receiving his trophy from the Ivan Lendl, Emilio Nava gave a big smile and started his speech with a simple “Wow!”. If not for the still projected score of the final of the junior category of the Australian Open, one would have thought that Nava had just won the title.\n\nDespite the defeat against the Italian Lorenzo Musetti (4-6, 6-3, 7-6 [12]), the American with Mexican origins was happy for what just happened.\n\nA day earlier, Nava also lost the doubles final, but that did not diminish his good mood. “It means the whole world to come to this stadium, Rod Laver, and play. Thank you very much”, he said. “I hope I can come back. Thank you!”.\n\nTo understand the reason of his good mood in the face of defeat, we must know its origin, which began in Mexico. His grandfather, Ernesto Escobedo, fell in love with tennis after attending a Davis Cup match in Los Angeles. After moving all his family to Jerez, Zacatecas, Don Ernesto built a tennis court in the patio of his house.\n\nXóchitl Nava, mother of Emilio, recognizes that the court, built by his father, had its own limitations, but at the same time offered his son an opportunity.\n\n“It was so tight, that on one side of the court we could not hit the neither forehand nor backhand. It was a tennis court, but for many it was a playground where you could hit the tennis balls just for fun”, Xochitl told the journalist Ben Rothenberg of the New York Times.\n\nCompletely in love whit the white sport, Mr. Ernesto Escobedo transmitted his passion to his 10 children. “As we grew, each one took different paths, but we always played tennis,” Xóchitl Nava stated.\n\nThanks to her training started in the court built by her father, Xóchitl Escobedo became the best national women player, No. 284 in the world ranking and Mexican representative in the Olympic Games in Seoul 1988. Her husband, Eduardo Nava, was a track athlete and competed in the 1988 and Barcelona 1992 Olympics.\n\nThis has already been passed to the new generation of the Escobedo family: Ernesto Escobedo, nephew of Xóchitl, reached No. 68 in 2017; Eduardo, his eldest son, plays in Wake Forest and is a national champion in the United States; Diego, his second son, plays in Los Angeles, and Emilio, the youngest, has played two Grand Slam finals in the junior category.\n\nEmilio Nava took his big first step when he reached the final of the prestigious Eddie Herr tournament in 2018. “It’s all, seriously, tennis is everything,” says Emilio, 17. “Especially when you train every day, tennis becomes a lifestyle, you know? Every time you think about it, it becomes something: you try to relax a bit, but it’s still there”.\n\nWith his family and home in California Emilio divides his time between California and Alicante, where he trains in Juan Carlos Ferrero’s academy. When he is in California, he trains across the Street at his cousin Jaime’s back yard.\n\n“In Alicante Ferrero gives me advise. I still haven’t trained with him directly”, Emilio said.\n\nPara encontrar el espíritu competitivo que sus padres y hermanos mayores le implantaron, Emilio no tiene que ir muy lejos. “Crecí en una familia competitiva y atlética”, admite. “Mis dos hermanos crecieron jugando al tenis, siendo los más jóvenes los admiraba. Quería ser como ellos y quería que me prestaran atención. Me encanta el tenis y la adrenalina y los desafíos que vienen con él”.\n\nTo find the competitive spirit that runs in his family Emilio does not have to go far. “I grew up in a competitive and athletic family,” he admits. “My two brothers grew up playing tennis, being the youngest I admired them. I wanted to be like them, and I wanted them to pay attention to me. I love tennis and adrenaline and the challenges that come with it. “\n\nThe French, semifinalist of the Australian Open, will be playing in Acapulco for the first time.\n\nMexico City. – A few days after announcing the list of players that will be part of Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC, the name of a new guest that will play in Acapulco, was released.\n\nLucas Pouille, 24 years of age and currently number 31 in the ATP Tour ranking, has been confirmed by the organization as the second guest by wildcard to the most important tennis tournament in Latin America.\n\nCurrently competing in the Australian Open and a few hours before the semifinals against the Serbian Novak Djokovic, the name of Pouille was included to the list of players that will be in Acapulco, the tournament will have the presence of seven Top 20 players. Subject to his result in Melbourne, Pouille has a spot on the Top 20 guaranteed starting next Monday.\n\nWinner of five ATP titles (Montpellier, Vienna, Stuttgart this year, Budapest in 2017, and Metz in 2016), the Grande-Synthe native, in 2017, became in the only player to obtain a title in three different surfaces and the fifth French to be Top 10.\n\nAmong his outstanding performances, including the current one in Australia, Pouille includes a victory over Rafael Nadal in five sets at the 2016 US Open (only victory against a Top 5), a semifinals at the Masters 1000 in Rome starting as “Lucky loser” (second tennis player to achieve it since Thomas Johansson in 2004), and a victory over Steve Darcis in the decisive match of the 2017 Davis Cup final to give the victory to France after 16 years.\n\n“The presence of Lucas Pouille, a player with a lot of talent that earned him, a few years ago the award as the player with the most improvement in the circuit [2016], will strengthen the picture we will present this year,” said Raúl Zurutuza, director of the AMT. “Throughout this week in Australia, Lucas has shown that his tennis is at the height of the largest and it will be a luxury to have it for the first time in Acapulco.”\n\nPouille is currently been trained by Amelie Mauresemo, former no.1 in the world.\n\nThis way, Pouille joins the Spanish David Ferrer as the wild cards that will play in Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC.\n\nAnother attraction of Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC will be Nick Kyrgios. The Australian, born in Canberra, like all high performance athletes, has biographical aspects to review.\n\nThe obvious: he uses a cool hair style, he has earrings and wears jewelry. The accessories on his outfits are tribal due to his origins (his mother is from Malaysia and his father from Greece). He always uses a necklace with a crucifix and a lucky charm his mother gave him. He sometimes listens to his music during the side changes.\n\nWhat he can’t keep to himself is that, as a kid, he wanted to play any sports but tennis, where he started as a ball boy to his brother Christos, whom is a lawyer.\n\nWhen he was 14 years of age he alternated between tennis and basketball. But he had to choose, due to the pressure from his parents. Therefore, he admits, he prefers to play basketball over tennis. Such is the suffering, that when he finishes his training, he asked himself why he plays.\n\nAny mortal would have already quit, either getting sick of it or because everyone else was better. But he wasn’t that lucky. At the age of 18, he ended the year as no. 1 in Juniors. The next year he left Rafa out of Wimbledon when he led the world rankings, he was the first player out of the top 100 who defeated the number 1 in more than two decades.\n\nHis first extravaganza was in 2015 against Gasquet, when nick returns the ball right to the net, the French public wasn’t happy with the act and they started “booing” the Australian. In the next service, he moved to the opposite side of the ball direction, and “gave” him an ace. Later he said that his goal was to end the match as soon as possible.\n\nAfter this game the commotion was overwhelming. The press launched countless headlines expressing any type of hypothesis: “cavalier”, “lazy”, “rebel”, “heartless player”, etc.\n\nAfter repeating these events, Nick accepted the conditions of the ATP that included attending the sports psychologist and publicly apologize.\n\nWithin the next few weeks he reached the final of the ATP Master of Cincinnati, which he would lose against Dimitrov. Despite the defeat, the young promise received ovations and compliments for his game.\n\nA couple of seasons ago he donated ten dollars, for each ace, to the victims of Hurricane Irma. He also created the NK Foundation, where he built sports facilities for young people at risk of exclusion and without resources. He found then, the drive to play tennis: “Now I play for them. I love children. In fact I enjoy more helping them and seeing them fulfill their dreams than what I do on the courts”, he told the media.\n\nHe tries to humanize an ultra-competitive sport. He shows himself as he is. His karma: the talent in a sport that is not his favorite. With athlete skills and rapper look, he will always provide spectacle. Are you going to miss it?\n\nHer name jumped in tennis world when she eliminated Serena in Quarterfinals of Australian Open 2013. The victory was so amazing that the number of followers she had on twitter went from 17 thousand to 40 thousand when the match ended. She was still under 20 years of age.\n\nFrom Fresno, she was 10 when she moved to her grandparent house in Plantation, Florida. With her stepfather’s help, started playing tennis at Sierra Sport and Racquet Club.\n\nHer WTA debut was in 2009. But when she was going to play her first qualifiers at the US Open, she found out about his father passing away in a car accident.\n\nShe is daughter of Sybil Smith, an Olympic swimmer and, John Stephens, football player (rooky of the year in 1989). She met her dad when she was 13 years of age, despite that he always pushed her to play tennis.\n\nWhen the accident happened, her family’s support was the most important force to rocket her career.\n\nIn 2017 she won the US Open against Madison Keys, after a surgery on the left foot. She moved 940 spots in the rankings in only 5 weeks to be number 17 in the WTA ranking. Until that year she had been to 35 Grand Slams without passing week 1 (only once in 2013 Semis at Roland Garros)\n\nSloane was raised with a mix of sports value, social actions and death, in a family that suffered from injustice.\n\nShe now says she only plays for fun and that enjoys every match she plays.\n\nIn many years it will be remembered by its aliases “The gladiator” or “The Wall”.\n\nHe started to play tennis at the age of 8. When he was 15, he moved to Barcelona and, at 17 to Villena in Alicate, where he spent nine months in Equelite at Juan Carlos Ferrero’s Academy.\n\nIt is known that he supports Valencia’s soccer team. He not only reads but keeps every book he has read. He is married to Marta and his son Leo was born last year. Agassi was his idol when he was younger, and if he was losing a match he couldn’t serve because of the tears in his eyes.\n\nHis statistics are simply amazing: he played 50 consecutive Grand Slams before he retire from Wimbledon in 2015 ( due to an injury in the left elbow), he won 3 Davis Cups, he was Top 20 during eleven seasons (Top 10 during seven, Top 5 during 4) only over came by Rafa Nadal in Spanish tennis history, his best ranking was number 3 in the world.\n\nHe is the third Spanish player with more titles (27) just behind Rafa Nadal and Manuel Orantes, and it’s the second one with more victories in the circuit (after Nadal), he is number 12 between the players with more victories in the ATP history.\n\nHe played more tan a thousand matches with a record of 727 -372 W -L (145 victories in Grand Slams). He faced 7 170 break points with his service and saved 60% of them.\n\nHe is simply Ferrer. Humble by nature. Always looking down without looking for any advantage.\n\nHis numbers are amazing and unreachable. He will keep fighting until the end.\n\nRafael Nadal, Alexander Zverev, Kevin Anderson and John Isner will be the Top 10 playes in Acapulco.

Stephens knows how it is to win in Acapulco, but she will have big competitors on this edition. The Feminine tournament has always surprised us, and I am sure this year won’t be the exception”, said Zurutuza.\n\nAmong the novelties this year’s edition, Tennis Run will take place for the first time, an event organized by the AMT in collaboration with Emoción Deportiva, and which will mark the start of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC on February 24th. Tennis Run will have 3 distances (10K, 5K and 3K) in adult and child categories.\n\nFinally, the inclusion of FoxTenn technology for the next edition of the AMT, which will replace the Hawk-Eye. “FoxTenn is a technology capable of go over more than 150 thousand images per second with 40 high-speed cameras installed around the court. This system will allow to observe the pique of the ball with much more certainty and precision. The ‘Hawk-Eye’, which we installed in 2014 together with the surface change, was based on the possible trajectory of the ball after the hit”, explained Zurutuza.\n\nAlexander Zverev finished the 2018 season in the best possible way, defeating Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic to claim his first title in the ATP Nitto Finals, so far, the biggest victory of his career. The German added three ATP Masters 1000, and took the No. 3 in the ATP Ranking, his performance in London will hardly be forgotten.\n\nZverev hopes that such a victory will take him in the right road to a great success. According to the FedEx ATP Performance Zone, Zverev was one of the best ATP players Grand Slams during 2018. Last year, Zverev was in the 11th place of the ATP, with a record of 10-4 in Grand Slams, translated to a 71.4 winning percentage.\n\nAt Roland Garros 2018, the German became the eighth player in the Open Era to battle through three matches to five consecutive sets, and the first to do so since Tommy Robredo in 2013. He lost to the eventual finalist Dominic Thiem in quarterfinals. But after his victory in the O2, he is ready to take another step forward.\n\n“I don’t think I didn’t do well during the Slams. I think there have been some unfortunate moments for me … I’ve done very well in Paris, then I got injured”, Zverev said after his victory in London. “The other Grand Slams, I played against a very good [Hyeon] Chung at the Australian Open, in which I lost a five-set match. Wimbledon I wasn’t ready to play because of the injury that happened at Roland Garros. US Open I had a bad game. These things happen. It’s okay.”\n\nAnother reason to keep the optimism is that 14 of the losses during Grand Slams, has lost after winning two of the first three sets, with those losses being against Rafael Nadal (finalist at Australian Open 2017), Milos Raonic (finalist at Wimbledon 2017) and Hyeong Chung (semifinals in Melbourne last year).\n\nTo make increase his game, Zverev hired former World No. 1 Ivan Lendl before the US Open. Lendl knows what Zverev is going through, as he reached four Slam finals before finally winning the first of eight Grand Slam trophies at Roland Garros in 1984. While his association did not give immediate results at Flushing Meadows -Zverev lost in third round against Philipp Kohlschreiber – the German believes he could help him take the next step.\n\n“He said it’s a process to get there. It’s a process playing well in Grand Slams” said Zverev. “He told me before the US Open that hoped I do well, but we are more oriented towards next year.”\n\nA legend who is not concerned about Zverev’s results in the past Slams is the former World No. 1, Boris Becker, who met the 21-year-old when he was only 10 years old.\n\n“He played the last two years at a high level. You wait as a young player to take the next step in the biggest tournaments and in the Grand Slams, unfortunately, he hasn’t made to a semifinal. But I think the way he played all week against the best players seemed to be very promising for 2019”, Becker told ATPTour.com after Zverev’s career at the Nitto Finals. “It starts with yourself. If you gain some confidence, if you start defeating the best tennis players in the world day after day, you start to believe that you really belong there. That’s why I think it was a breakthrough. “"
