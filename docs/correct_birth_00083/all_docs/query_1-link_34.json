        "text": "Why did you choose the X-Pyr?\n\nFew years after starting to paraglide, participating at the X-Pyr became a defined goal.\n\nWhat is your greatest sporting success?\n\nBeing a finisher of the Dolomitisuperfly was indeed a great success.\n\nWhen and why did you start paragliding?\n\nStarted in 2014. Since I was 5 or 6 years of age I was standing in front of the mirrow with my arms wide open and trying to catch some air like the birds.\n\nWhat is your mountaineering experience?\n\nIn winter and spring time I combine ski touring with some mountaineering. I also did some 4000m mountains in the Swiss Alps\n\nWhat are your best and worst sporting memories?\n\nBest: the fact that Hike and Fly is a small world and everyone slowly knows each other and the competitions become a gathering of friends.\n\nWorst: making safety calls which lead to a lot of walking or loosing some positions.\n\nHave you flown in the Pyrenees before? Do you have a favourite area?\n\nAger, Orgañá, Castejón de Sos. I don’t really a favourite area.\n\nIs there anything you like to see (or not) in the route?\n\nI would prefer to stay on the Spanish side as much as possible. Ideally avoiding some of the no landing zones.\n\nApart from flying far and walking little, what will your strategy be during the race?\n\nKeeping a good spirit with the team is key\n\nWhat does your typical training week consist of?\n\n6 days of a mixture of strength, trail running, hiking, mountain biking and of course, flying\n\nWhat has been the hardest part of your race preparation so far?\n\nGetting air time\n\nWhat excites you most about participating in the X-Pyr?\n\nThe opportunity to be able to cross the Pyrenees and see beautiful and in some cases remote places\n\nWhat worries you the most about the event?\n\nThe strong winds and the heat.\n\nHow do you know your assistant?\n\nWe met at a Ski and Fly competition in Switzerland\n\nWhat are your assistant’s main strengths?\n\nDetermination, local knowledge and motivation.\n\nWhat advice would you ask of one of the race veterans?\n\nHow different is the Pyrenees to the Alps? And how do you adapt to it.\n\nAnything else you like to comment?\n\nLet’s have fun.\n\nAn adventure is only when you don’t know the outcome."
