        "text": "Ferrer, 36, is set to retire himself in May after a solid career where he reached a best ranking of world No 3.\n\nThe Valencia-born ace is close friends with Nadal and wants to see his countryman continue to close the gap to Roger Federer’s Grand Slam tally - of which he is three behind.\n\nHowever, Nadal has struggled with a series of injuries over the last few years which could cause him to halt his career prematurely.\n\nBut Ferrer wants to see the 32-year-old continue providing the inspiration for the up-and-coming Spanish stars.\n\n\"In Spain there is a very good base and great quarry,” Ferrer said at an awards dinner in Le Nuncio.\n\n“But we hope that Rafa Nadal lasts a few more years because it will be impossible to find another equal.\n\n“The law of life and is that other tennis players will come.”\n\nNadal sat out of the Miami Open last week to try and recover from a knee injury in time for the Monte Carlo Masters."
