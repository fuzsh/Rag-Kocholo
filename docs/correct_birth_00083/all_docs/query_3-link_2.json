        "text": "We start in the north at Denia : A fishing and seaside town on the most northern part of the Costa Blanca.\n\nDue to its favorable location (protected by the Montgo mountain), the season lasts longer than elsewhere. Denia is a city that has something to offer for everyone such as fishing, diving, windsurfing, sailing, etc.. as well as beautiful nature walks in the park of Montgo.\n\nGetting lost in the extroverted and picturesque neighborhood of the fishermen ‘Barrio de Los Pescadores’ is really not a punishment and you will certainly not go hungry.\n\nFurther south, the foothills of the Benitachell mountain range rise. At 200m above sea level, the plains, Les Planes with calcareous soil, form, which then suddenly fall into the sea at Cape Sant Marti, Cape Negre and Cape La Nao, as it were.\n\nBut Denia is also a port city. In addition to the regular port, there is also a large marina with capacity for mega yachts. Lovers of luxury yachts will be delighted. In the marina of Denia you will also find many nice terraces with a view of the boats. Those who want to go to and from the Balearic Islands (the party island of Ibiza, the holiday paradise of Mallorca or the authentic Formentera) can take the ferry from Denia. You will be at your destination in a few hours.\n\nDenia also has a very long sandy beach where you can enjoy a lovely walk in the winter and quietly enjoy the sun and the sea in the summer away from the crowds. The beach of Denia is also one of the few beaches on the Costa Blanca where dogs are allowed.\n\nSports enthusiasts will certainly not be bored. Denia is a paradise for kite surfers and has a kite school where you can safely learn this sport. The club also rents Hobie Cats. The sailors among us know what that means. Besides the classic sports (golf, tennis, the popular padel…) Denia is also extremely attractive for hikers. Put on walking shoes, put on a backpack and you are ready to climb the 753 meter high Montgo: climbing ropes and irons are not necessary, a good condition all the more.\n\nThe pearl of the Costa Blanca with a high Ibiza content. Javea has only 30,000 inhabitants and yet it is quite extensive. Three centers are within walking distance of each other: the touristic Playa Arenal, a sandy beach located in a small shallow bay with a beautiful promenade where you will find one beautiful terrace next to the other: Bambula, Chabada, Achill, La Bohème. Anyone who has ever been to Javea has undoubtedly enjoyed a cocktail or some fresh tapas.\n\nFrom Playa Arenal it is about a three kilometer walk along it.\n\npebble beach to the puerto, the yacht and fishing port. If you want to take a rest en route, you can visit one of the many chiringuito’s or the fashionable beach club La Siesta. Don’t lose sight of the sea, because dolphins are regularly spotted here and now and then even a whale.\n\nIn the puerto you will find the lonja, the fish market where you can buy fish and seafood in the late afternoon that come squeaky fresh from the boats that have just sailed in. Those who prefer to be served can enjoy a delicious meal in the Cala Bandida, Noray or one of the many other restaurants.\n\nYou can have breakfast at the sympathetic Dutchman Paul in Mira Luna or in The Beach House on the idyllic roof terrace that was designed by the local interior architect Silvia Bellot of Mediterranean Nomad.\n\nDon’t miss the ultra-modern Iglesia de los Pescadores (fishermen’s church).\n\nIf you think you’ve seen it all, you’re wrong: walk away from the coast for a while and you’ll come to the pueblo, the old village of Javea: a maze of small streets with white facades with Gothic windows and balconies with wrought iron railings. You eat delicious in restaurants such as La Sucreria de la Plaza, Rebotika, La Cajita Azull, Volti y Volta…\n\nAre you just a little hungry? In many traditional bars you get a tapa with every drink: a plate of Iberico ham, a king prawn croquette, some cubes of machego cheese…\n\nOn Thursdays, the pueblo turns into one big market and don’t forget: Europe’s great fruit orchard is only a dozen kilometers inland: not only our oranges and lemons, but also figs, cherries, pomegranates, strawberries, grapes and almonds come from here.\n\nWant to see even more? Then definitely drive to the miradors (viewpoints): from the southernmost point Cabo de la Nao to the northernmost point Cabo San Antonio you will come across several of these viewpoints. And while you’re on the road: also visit the beach of Granadella: twice voted the most beautiful beach in all of Spain.\n\nHikers and mountain bikers can also indulge themselves in the Granadella Natural Park: 750 hectares of nature reserve!\n\nThose who can’t get enough of breathtaking sea views should also drive up the Puig de Moraig: you can see Ibiza and the inscriptions on the asphalt reveal that the Vuelta de España (the Spanish Tour de France) passes every year.\n\nExhausted and hungry after all that sightseeing? Star pickers can enjoy a delicious meal at Bon Amb (two Michelin stars).\n\nFor the ‘Smartest People’ among us: Javea is the birthplace of tennis star David Ferrer. His brother still runs the tennis club there.\n\nOne more tip: on Sunday mornings there is a farmers’ market in the nearby village of Jesus Pobre (yes: Poor Jesus). You will not only find (organic) vegetables, fruit, wine and honey, but there are also food stalls: a kind of Spanish food truck festival avant la lettre. In the summer this event continues at dusk and is graced with Spanish live music. Then you can taste the Spain of the Spaniards!\n\nSmall coves and beaches alternate on the coast. The most famous and most visited beach of all is Playa de la Fustera. On the border with Calpe you will find a picturesque marina, Les Basetes, almost on the border with Calpe. There you can rent all non-motorized water sports equipment in the summer in the Antipodes water sports club: from Hobie Cat to windsurf boards and from kayaks to SUP boards. The club is also run by Vicky Sanchez, ex-world champion freestyle windsurfing.\n\nInland it is a more mountainous region, formed by Sierra de Oltá, La Sollana, La Malla and La Sierra de Berniadie. Die is almost 1,200 meters high. The city center, with a historic center, has managed to preserve its origins and a large number of historic buildings and monuments.\n\nA little pearl. Very popular with the Belgians.\n\nNature lovers should definitely go inland.\n\nFrom the national road N332 you have an exit in Benissa to Xalo/Jalon. Barely a few kilometers further you come to a green valley with almond trees, olive trees, cherry trees, fig trees, pomegranate trees and much more. Especially in February, when the blossoms are in bloom, this is a paradise type of Spain that is completely different from sea and beach.\n\nA Flemish classic and that brand everywhere. Anyone who likes to find a piece of Flanders on the Spanish coast will feel like a fish in water in Calpe: you will find a Belgian restaurant or bar in every street. You drink your trusted Stella or Duvel under the Spanish sun and you simply eat a smos or stew with fries.\n\nThe Flemish presence is also noticeable in the many Belgian number plates.\n\nIn winter Calpe is the base of many professional cycling teams. Who knows, you might run into Philippe Gilbert or Peter Sagan.\n\nThe landmark of Calpe is the 332-meter high rock El peñon de Ifach, which rises above the sea and can be seen for miles. It is the highest Mediterranean rock on the Costa Blanca and divides Calpe’s coastline into two parts. You can of course climb it.\n\nIf you prefer to take it a little easier, you can simply take the elevator at the Suitopia hotel to the 30th floor. There is a trendy sky bar where you have a 360° view over Calpe and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nChic, artistic, romantic. Altea has a beautiful beach with a long promenade full of terraces. Altea also has the beautiful marina, Marina Greenwich, which takes its name from being right on Greenwich’s prime meridian. This means that the Costa Blanca actually falls under the English time zone, but since continental European time is used, it stays ready for an hour longer in the evening.\n\nIn Marina Greenwich, be sure to eat or drink something at the Altea Bay Club, a hip terrace right next to the water with a high jet set content. Those who like Ferraris and Bentleys better keep their eyes open.\n\nBut what most typifies Altea is the old village centre. You have to climb some stairs, but it’s worth it: narrow alleys with white houses and when you get to the top: a Spanish Place du Tertre. The church square is full of painters, musicians… Many Spanish couples come from far away to say yes in the romantic church. And anyone who knows Spain a little knows that this is accompanied by the necessary show: the ladies in high heels in long colorful dresses, the gentlemen in tight suits with the obligatory sunglasses, fireworks and of course children, many children…\n\nIt would make you hungry: restaurant Oustau is definitely recommended. Xef Pirata is certainly not inferior. Sybarite is also top notch. Just come and discover it!\n\nOh, just this. In case you wonder where all that jet set now lives in Altea: Altea Hills! Like in Beverly Hills, but in Spain. A guarded urbanization with phenomenal views of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nVillajoyosa, also called la Vila Joiosa, means “the cheerful city”. The fishing village originated in the Bronze Age as an Iberian settlement. It grew into a coastal town with several bathhouses. The watchtowers in the town played an important role in defending the coast against pirates. Why cheerful city? You will immediately notice this when you walk on the beach and see the typical and brightly colored fishermen’s houses. What is the story behind the houses : are they so colorful that the fishermen could see their own house from the sea ? Or because the men don’t end up in the wrong house after a hard night out?\n\nDo you like chocolate? In Villajoyosa you have 2 chocolate factories, open to the public.\n\nThe most famous is Valor. Knew that Valor has cafes where every dish or drink has something to do with chocolate. Our favorites? In the morning the churro con chocolate or the fruit fondue where the pieces of fresh fruit prick and dip in a jar with running chocolate. Who wouldn’t be happy with this.\n\nSo much to see, so much to do. Don’t forget to relax on the beach and just enjoy yourself.\n\nToday Valencia is hot but if you want to know what will be “the place to be” you should definitely check out Alicante.\n\nIt is a mix of a port city, always close to water, a very old city (from 300VC) with a winding street and culinary excellence.\n\nThe most lively artery is the Explanada de Espana, the large boulevard on the right and left flanked by palm trees, which runs parallel to the harbor. You can sometimes find an artisan market, you can watch street performers and it is always a mix of locals and tourists. Not to mention many great restaurants. Our favorite is Terre. A modern building with contemporary Spanish cuisine. We are surprised every time. For the photographers and bloggers among you, the El Barrio neighborhood is the place to be. A car-free neighborhood where the locals are still on the street, every tin is a planter and where color is a must.\n\nAnd for the sailors among you, Alicante is home to the Volvo Ocean Race and museum of the same name."
