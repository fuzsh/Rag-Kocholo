        "text": "Hailing from the beautiful city of Puebla, this ancho chile liqueur is absolutely delicious. Puebla is one of the cradles of post-contact Mexican cuisine, and is the birthplace of the esteemed mole poblano. Initially concocted by nuns toiling in the city's convents, this dish is perhaps the ultimate expression of sweet, savory, and spicy complexity. These flavors are all present in Ancho Reyes, which is bottled and ready for you to enjoy. I made mole poblano once and it took me about 9 hours and was a pale imitation of the real thing. The apple cider cocktail that I made with Ancho Reyes however, was an absolute delight. That took me about 1 minute to make. Sweet spice, rich chile fruit, chocolate, and vanilla.\n\n- VG"
