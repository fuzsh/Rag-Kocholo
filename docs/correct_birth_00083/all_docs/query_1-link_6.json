David enjoys a good book under his arm and keeps all his books. He is one of the most well-liked players in the ATP circuit due to his character.\n\nDavid, a small giant, belongs to a world of celebrities but he knows that it is an unreal universe and he has not forgotten his roots. I received a good education from my parents: they taught me hard work, perseverance and humility. They served as a good example for me. I will never forget the city of Xàbia where I grow up and met all my friends."
