Professional Photographer Paul Nguyen has lived and worked from coast to coast across the U.S., and has over 30 years of experience in film and digital photography. He specializes in digital photography of natural landscapes and wildlife from around the world.

In April 2017, he served in the prestigious National Park Artist in Residence program at Petrified Forest, Arizona, and continues to create programs for the National Park Service. His work also includes an exclusive assignment as a photographer for the Boston Museum of Science, and a position as a program guide and brand ambassador for Swedish outfitter Fjällräven.

His images have been licensed by organizations such as the Nature Conservancy, Tamron USA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and numerous local and international publications, and his outstanding image-making and teaching have gained him equipment sponsorships from Tamron USA and Sun Surveyor.
