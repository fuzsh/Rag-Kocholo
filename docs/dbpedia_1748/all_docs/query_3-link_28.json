        "text": "Feb 5th - Eric Leiser\n\nEric Leiser is an award-winning filmmaker, animator, puppeteer, writer, holographer and multi-media artist working in the New York and London area. A graduate from CalArt's Experimental Animation program, Leiser creates animated and live action feature films and shorts as well as works integrating animation, puppetry, holography, live performance and installation. Leiser is interested in how animation transforms perception when it is combined with live action space, creating a fantastical, spiritual, or surrealistic quality.\n\nHis most recent solo exhibitions include: The Horse Hospital Museum in London, The Exploratorium Museum in San Francisco, Galerie Entropia in Poland, MaRS Gallery in Los Angeles, Galerie du Haut Pave in Paris, Sound of MU Gallery in Oslo, Flux Factory/Holocenter in New York City, Fringe Exhibitions Gallery in Los Angeles, Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, Ruben H. Fleet Space Museum in San Diego, Goldsmiths, University of London and Shapeshifters Cinema in Oakland.\n\nRecent group exhibitions include: The Whitney Museum of American Art, The MIT Museum, MassMoCA, Armory Arts Center, Holocenter Museum, Spencer Brownstone Gallery and Cabinet Magazine among others.\n\nHis animated/live action films have screened at the: Whitney Museum of American Art, Victoria and Albert Museum, Museum of Modern Art Antwerp, The Istanbul Modern Museum of Art, Thessaloniki Contemporary Art Museum, MASS MoCA, Centro Cultural Ricardo Rojas Muse-um de Buenos Aires, The Ruben H.

His recent 4th feature film Apocalypsis was released by Lionsgate in 2018.\n\nApril 15th - Sofia Gallisá Muriente\n\nSofía Gallisá Muriente is an artist whose research-based practice resists colonial erasures and claims the freedom of historical agency, proposing mechanisms for remembering and reimagining. Her work deepens the subjectivity of historical narratives and contests dominant visual culture through multiple approaches to documentation. She employs text, image and archive as medium and subject, exploring their poetic and political implications. Sofía has been a fellow of the Smithsonian Institute, Cisneros Institute at MoMA, Puerto Rican Arts Initiative, Annenberg Media Lab at USC and the Flaherty Seminar, and participated in residencies with the Vieques Historical Archive, Alice Yard (Trinidad & Tobago), FAARA (Uruguay) and Fonderie Darling (Montreal), among others. She has exhibited in Documenta, Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum, Queens Museum, Savvy Contemporary, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Puerto Rico, and galleries like Km 0.2 and Embajada. From 2014 to 2020, she co-directed the artist-run organization Beta-Local. In 2023 she was awarded the Latinx Artist Fellowship."
