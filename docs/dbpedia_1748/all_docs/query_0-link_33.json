Finally with the assistance of a Methodist church they relocated to Des Peres, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.[6][4] The 21 Jump Street season 2 episode \"Christmas in Saigon\", which first aired in December 1987, is based in his experiences escaping Vietnam and eventually arriving in the United States; Nguyen also served as a technical advisor in the episode.\n\nNguyen graduated from Garden Grove High School in Garden Grove, California, he attended Orange Coast College[2] and majored in communications but later dropped out to pursue acting full time.[4]\n\nNguyen practices several martial arts including Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Eskrima, and Jeet Kune Do.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHe made his acting debut on Magnum, P.I., portraying a Cambodian freedom fighter in the episode \"All For One.\" He was a series regular on both 21 Jump Street and VIP, and has guest-starred on a number of other series, including General Hospital, Highlander, and most notably seaQuest DSV, playing the role of Chief William Shan. Moreover, he had a cameo role in Charlie's Angels. Nguyen also auditioned for the role of Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat, but lost out to Robin Shou.[7] In 1993 he played a Vietnamese man sent off to fight with the Viet Cong, in the film Heaven & Earth. In 2005, Nguyen starred as a former heroin addict opposite Academy Award-winner Cate Blanchett in the critically acclaimed Little Fish.[8] He starred in the 2007 films The Rebel and Saigon Eclipse.

Nguyen screened in 2009 the thriller The Gauntlet directed by Matt Eskandari; he stars with Chinese actress Bai Ling. He made a small cameo in 22 Jump Street as Vietnamese Jesus.[10]\n\nNguyen continues to act and make films in Vietnam full-time. He made his feature directorial debut in the Vietnamese fantasy film Once Upon a Time in Vietnam, in which he also starred. He then starred in the Vietnamese film Gentle that premiered at the 2015 Busan International Film Festival where he received strong reception for his performance.[11]\n\nHe was cast in Cinemax's Warrior in a recurring role before he officially joined the main cast in season two of the series.[12]\n\nNguyen also was cast in The Accidental Getaway Driver which premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.[13]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a car accident late at night that occurred on September 3, 2001, on California's Interstate 5 Highway between San Francisco and Los Angeles during a Labor Day weekend which left his fiancée, Angela Rockwood, a quadriplegic, Nguyen and Rockwood became active in The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center.
