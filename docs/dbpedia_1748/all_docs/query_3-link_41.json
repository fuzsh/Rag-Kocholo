        "text": "Canadian Screen Week kicked off on Sunday, May 26, and culminated in today's Canadian Screen Awards Gala broadcast, hosted by comedian Mae Martin and available on CBC and CBC Gem.\n\nThe awards recognize outstanding achievements in Canadian film, television and digital media, drawing stars like director Denis Villeneuve, who received the Academy Icon award. Throughout the week, the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television honoured winners at the CBC headquarters in Toronto.\n\nIt's been a week of celebration and standout fashion moments. Here are some of the must-see looks from the 2024 Canadian Screen Awards red and gold glitter carpets.\n\nMayko Nguyen\n\nThe stars of Hudson & Rex, actor Mayko Nguyen and Diesel vom Burgimwald, aka Rex, walked the gala red carpet together. We love dogs, and also Nguyen's stylish, asymmetrical white dress with a front slit.\n\nJay Baruchel and Rebecca-Jo Dunham-Baruchel\n\nCanadian actor Baruchel and his wife, digital creator Rebecca-Jo Dunham-Baruchel, were a fashion-forward pair. Baruchel wore a dashing, striped Thom Browne suit paired with Hockey Night in Canada socks. Dunham-Baruchel wore a crochet dress by Montreal- and Vancouver-based designer Rachel Sudbury, layered over a Jean Paul Gaultier bodysuit. The dress was embellished with cigarette packs.\n\nAmrit Kaur\n\nAmrit Kaur — an actor, director and writer who won the award for best performance in a leading role for the drama The Queen of My Dreams — wore an eye-catching red gown with an abstract floral print by Indian designer Payal Khandwala to the gala, paired with oversized hoop earrings.\n\nDarla Contois\n\nContois won best lead performer, drama series, for her role in Little Bird and looked radiant in a floor-length, satin dress with fringe detailing by Heather Bouchier Designs. The one-of-a-kind dress is made from an upcycled wedding gown and embellished with horsehair tassels and 3D printed dentalium shells.\n\nDani Kind\n\nWorkin' Moms star Dani Kind wore a multi-textured black ensemble on the red carpet with slicked back hair. We love the expert layering here, styled by Amber Watkins: a sleek bodysuit, sheer knit dress and statement cape by Uncuffed Leather. She's also wearing jewelry by Toronto-based Biko.\n\nAngelique Knights\n\nBria Mack Gets a Life producer Angelique Knights also looked amazing in an LBD and red lip. The best comedy series winner wore a fitted black dress with long sleeves and a unique circular neckline.\n\nElaine Lui\n\nElaine Lui, who accepted the award for best host, lifestyle with her colleagues at The Social earlier this week, wore a white shirt dress with oversized sleeves by Sacai and a denim top layer by Christopher John Rogers on Wednesday. It's the details that made the look: the statement braids, tiny white ribbons in her hair and frilly socks styled with platform Mary Jane shoes.\n\nSonia Mangat\n\nHost and reporter Sonia Mangat was radiant in a strapless, floor-length gown by Helsa while attending the News, Entertainment, and Sports Awards earlier this week. The matching lip and hints of red in her long braid added nice touches.\n\nTyrone Edwards\n\nTyrone Edwards looked dapper in a grey and white Thom Browne suit at the News, Entertainment and Sports Awards on Tuesday. Instead of a plain dress shirt, Etalk stylist Simone Faloona paired the fitted suit with a less formal but still polished polo.\n\nVivek Shraya\n\nVivek Shraya, the creator and star of How To Fail As A Popstar, which won in two categories this week, wore a fitted custom red dress by designer Mario Fugnitto on Tuesday. Fashion stylist Charlene Akuamoah also dressed her in an emerald green Greta Constantine coat and oversized Rita Tesolin belt for Wednesday's Television Program and Performance Awards.\n\nTai Young\n\nAthlete and actor Tai Young, from the nominated show Dream It To Be It, wore a glamorous, embellished look custom-created by costume designer Leeland Mitchell. The inspiration was \"something a little bit camp and extravagant,\" Young shared on social media.\n\nKeshia Chanté\n\nThe singer, who hosted the Television Program and Performance Awards, looked resplendent in an off-the-shoulder, V-neck gown by Canadian label RVNG Couture. We're here for all of the high-drama, red dresses worn at this year's Canadian Screen Week.\n\nLaurie Anna Babin\n\nA nominee for Red Rooms, the actor wore a pretty plaid dress with black velvet ribbons by Montreal fashion designer Eliza Faulkner to attend the Cinematic Arts Awards on Thursday.\n\nVincent Dufault\n\nHair artist Vincent Dufault, nominated for his work on Ru, wore a fabulous purple dress and black hoodie look from fashion label Lakuachimoto. The outfit was paired with a top-handle Nouveau Riche Atelier beaded handbag and a black baseball cap, also by Lakuachimoto.\n\nTraci Melchor\n\nTraci Melchor, who won a best host or presenter, factual or reality/competition, for Canada's Drag Race, wore some great outfits this week. But our favourite is this off-the-shoulder, polka-dot dress by AFRM, which fits like a dream."
