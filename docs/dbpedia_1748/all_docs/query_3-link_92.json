        "text": "A graduate of BU’s MA Producing for Film and Television has reached the finals of an international award recognising future leaders in the creative industries.\n\nTrung (Billy) Nguyen was shortlisted in the Culture and Creativity category of the British Council Study UK Alumni Awards in Vietnam. The awards aim to celebrate the success of international students who have studied in the UK and acknowledge the contributions made to their industries.\n\nBilly’s journey to the UK began during his studies in Vietnam when he realised that production companies just weren’t utilising local talent. This was confirmed during his internship in an advertising agency, where he realised that if he wanted to create change in the industry, he would need to become a film producer, or as Billy says “the guy above the line.” Billy said: “I knew that studying in the UK would help me to be a unique and standout choice among my peers and as such applied to BU’s MA Producing for Film and Television.”\n\nBilly explains that there were four key factors from his BU studies that contributed to his success. These include gaining industry knowledge, international perspectives, opportunities for collaboration, and access to industry networks. This, combined with his unwavering determination, resulted in a distinct advantage in the industry.\n\nSince completing his course, Billy has made significant contributions to the industry by co-founding Spring Auteurs with Jay Do, Pham Gia Quy, Nguyen Van Duy Linh, Mie Vo. Billy says, “This film community, initially intended for knowledge sharing, has blossomed into a powerful force. With over 1,000 active members, both local and international, Spring Auteurs fosters a shared belief in elevating the film industry. Our reach has become global, partnering with festivals to showcase Vietnamese cinema and promoting cultural exchange through collaborations with countries like India, the USA, Thailand, and Singapore.”\n\nStudy UK’s Alumni Awards aim to celebrate the successes of international students who have studied in the UK, so we’re thrilled that Billy has received this international acclaim!"
