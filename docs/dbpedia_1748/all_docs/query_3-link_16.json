Missy Hernandez received the top prize as the winner of the Feature Screenplay Competition for \"I Don't Dream In Spanish Anymore.\"\n\nThe Episodic 60 Minute Screenplay Competition nod went to Daniel Hernandez-Zapata for \"The Soloist,\"; the 30 Minute Episodic Screenplay Competition was won by Phillip Roquemore for \"Illicit Bids For Dying Kids,\" and the Short Screenplay Competition winner was \"Who Raised You?\" by Daniel Gonzalez.\n\nThe Film Screenplay Competition jury was composed of New York Magazine’s Rebecca Alter, filmmaker and actor Katie Aselton Duplass, and filmmaker and playwright Derek Nguyen.\n\nThe Episodic Screenplay Competition jury was composed of film and music video director Katherine Dieckmann, writer and director of \"Winner\" Susanna Fogel, and UTA motion picture business affairs executive Sarah Vacchiano.\n\nThe Festival also announced the winner of the Adrienne Shelly Foundation Excellence in Filmmaking Award, a $5,000 grant recognizing the achievement of a female filmmaker, and named in honor of the late actor and director. This year’s award went to \"Every Little Thing,\" directed by Sally Aitken and screening as part of NFF’s documentary feature lineup. Producer Bettina Dalton attended the festival and accepted the award on behalf of the film. Aitken also received a second award: this year’s Maria Mitchell Visionary Award, presented to a female filmmaker who demonstrates vision and innovation. Sponsored by the Maria Mitchell Association, the awardee receives a $5,000 grant in the name of Maria Mitchell, the first female inducted into the Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Nantucket native.\n\nThe Children’s Resilience in Screenwriting Award presented by Shine Global is a new prize given to a film with outstanding storytelling that effectively portrays the resilience and strength of children. \"Los Frikis,\" written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, received the inaugural award, which included a prize of $2,500 and an invitation to participate in Shine Global’s upcoming 2024 Resilience Awards events. The award-winning non-profit media company Shine Global’s annual Resilience Awards honor exceptional films that center around the resilience of children and further the organization’s mission of improving children’s lives by harnessing the power of storytelling.\n\nThe Teen View Jury Award, selected by a group of Nantucket seventh and eighth-graders as the most inspiring out of all of NFF’s short films, went to writer and director Chris Cole for \"Terminally Ill,\" with a special mention for \"The Ugandan Quidditch Movement,\" directed by Ben Garfield.\n\n“It is a privilege to honor this cohort of both established and emerging screenwriters and storytellers, who represent the heart of our industry, at the 2024 edition of the festival,” said Mystelle Brabbée, executive director of the Nantucket Film Festival, and Anita Raswant, lead programmer of the Nantucket Film Festival. “Thank you to all of our attending filmmakers and writers for sharing their powerful stories with us and our passionate audiences who continue to turn out to the theaters and support our mission. We would like to take a moment to recognize our jurors, sponsors, staff, and volunteers, all of whom worked to make another incredibly successful festival possible.”"
