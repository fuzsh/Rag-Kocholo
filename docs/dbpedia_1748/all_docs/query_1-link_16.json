But I think the more memorable ones include a sense of uncertainty about the outcome, which I think is vital to the definition of \"adventure\". I think my backpacking trips to the High Sierra of California, and the backcountry of Grand Teton, where I have to carry not only my gear for survival, but also pick and choose which of my camera equipment will make the cut, and then carry it all on my back for days are what has given me the biggest sense of both uncertainty during the journey, and accomplishment afterwards.\n\nShare a podcast/article/book/movie that you have enjoyed lately\n\nI have known about Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey for decades, but just got around to reading it! I was inspired to read this by a recent photo tour that I led to Southern Utah, which included Arches National Park, the primary setting for the book."
