Details will be sent to the BCA community email list.\n\nDescription: Drones have become more available and affordable than ever, so there’s no reason to put off adding aerial photography into your photographic toolbox. Flying a drone camera can give new life to stale subjects by showing the world from a bird’s eye view. As an FAA-certified commercial drone pilot, I will teach you what you need to know about choosing the right quadcopter for your photography and videography needs, the basics of how to operate and fly a drone safely and legally, and the specific considerations surrounding the making of images and moving pictures from the air.\n\nBio: Professional Photographer Paul Nguyen is a native of Massachusetts with over 28 years of experience in film and digital photography. He currently specializes in digital photography of natural landscapes and wildlife from New England and around the world. In April 2017, he served in the prestigious National Parks Artist in Residence program, at Petrified Forest, AZ. His work also includes an exclusive assignment as the photographer for the Gallery on the Charles River at the Museum of Science, Boston. His images have been licensed by organizations such as the Nature Conservancy, Tamron USA, Amazing New England Artworks, and numerous local and international publications, and his outstanding image-making and teaching have gained him an equipment sponsorship from Tamron USA. Paul lives and works out of Hanson, MA, and can be seen promoting and selling his work at art shows and fairs in New England throughout the year, and is also a lecturer and contest judge for local camera clubs. The Boston Camera Club awarded him Judge of the Year honors for 2015-2016. He offers local and destination photography workshops through his business, BlueHour Photo Ventures, as well as private one-on-one instruction.\n\nWebsites:"
