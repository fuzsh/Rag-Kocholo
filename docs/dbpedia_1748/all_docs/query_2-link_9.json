        "text": "For our latest conversation, we had a great chat with Paul Nguyen, the Founder and Director of Creative Culture HQ. Paul shared what motivated him to leave a stable career and start a company dedicated to high-quality, brand-specific content while building a positive and empowering work environment.\n\nHe discussed the challenges he faced along the way, from the early days of launching Creative Culture HQ to working with big names like Disney and Westfield. Paul also opened up about the unique practices they’ve implemented to create a supportive and dynamic team culture.\n\nPaul, starting your own agency in 2021 must have been a huge leap. What inspired you to leave your career in social media management and start Creative Culture HQ?\n\nThroughout my career, I observed a culture breakdown in the marketing industry. I didn’t feel as though there were enough agencies really delivering on what they promised they would at a high quality. Due to this, I saw a lot of businesses experience what I call “agency trauma”. That is, being hesitant to work with another agency for fear of not receiving value for money again.\n\nBy the same token, I noticed content creators and marketers lacking confidence in their unique abilities. Hardly receiving the recognition they deserve from the people around them and their clients.\n\nWith the launch of Creative Culture HQ, I set out to be the culture change I wanted to see in the industry. At CCHQ, we’re focused on providing our fantastic clients with high quality brand specific content that is both engaging and purposeful.\n\nWe’re also focused on building an unrivalled business culture and an environment for content creators and marketers to flourish, as well as being a pillar in the fabric of the industry community.\n\nCreating a positive team culture seems really important to you. What are some of the unique things you’ve done at CCHQ to make it a place where people actually want to come to work every day?\n\nIt is absolutely one of the most important things to us. There is a lot of work that goes into building such a strong and positive culture and we are doing as much as we can as well as continuing to build our capacity to do more.\n\nAt CCHQ, developing the team is one of the highest priorities. I feel like I owe my team everything. I am always finding ways to let the team know that they are appreciated and valued as well as investing in their growth and development, both personally and professionally. I make it a point to meet with each member of my team one on one each week.\n\nI want everyone to consistently receive the credit, recognition, and acknowledgement they deserve. I also want to check in on their goals and have a discussion about how the company can play its part to help them manifest. We also use the time to check in on the team’s mental and physical wellbeing and to ensure that above all, they are happy.\n\nCCHQ holds regular training workshops off site in a collaborative board room that gives our team access to practical and technical information to gain further knowledge and better their skills. We also hold team events and activities to promote camaraderie.\n\nWe are currently implementing a new sustainability and team development initiative in which all plastic bottles and cans that are used will be provided to the local Return & Earn and all the money received will go towards team outings or activities.\n\nAdditionally, we have partnered with Camera House, the largest stockist of cameras and video accessories as well as Sony, to allow our team members to benefit from epic discounts and savings on the latest industry equipment and technology.\n\nYou’ve worked with some big names like Disney and Westfield. What do you think makes you guys stand out from other digital marketing agencies?\n\nWithin six months of operation, we had produced marketing assets for clients like Disney and Westfield. I think that without a doubt, the culture that we work so hard to cultivate and preserve is what sets us apart. This is based on our values of care, community, and confidence.\n\nI believe outputs can be attributed to inputs. I am a huge advocate for hard work and high standards. I believe hard work always pays off. I believe in taking pride in and caring about the work and service you provide. I don’t believe in shortcuts. At CCHQ, we are always ensuring that the quality of our services is the best it can be, with the highest level of attention to detail and informed strategy.\n\nAlthough I am steadfast in my philosophy, I know that I as one person can only go so far. That is why developing my team is one of my highest priorities. I know that when I invest in my team and they feel looked after, they will look after the business in return. That is why I am committed to adhering to all the work that goes into building a workplace that people want to get up and go to every day. One in which they grow and feel celebrated.\n\nI believe in backing yourself before anybody else. Having confidence in your abilities and showing team members that you have confidence in them. I believe people give you their best when you believe in them. At CCHQ, we are dedicated to our core value of integrity, and being a responsible and secure employer for our team. To the point of raising the level of respect for our peers in the industry, we celebrate amazing work and never talk badly about anybody, even competition.\n\nRunning a growing business can be hectic. How do you manage to keep a good work-life balance? Do you have any routines or habits that help you stay on track?\n\nSome time ago, I would have been the last person to talk to about work/life balance. In the very early stages of my business, I would be working at the desk from sunrise to sunset. There was a nine month period where I didn’t have one day off. One day I went to sleep at 11pm, and woke up at 2am to prepare for a shoot and then walked through the entire workday! Good times…\n\nI am definitely a lot more balanced these days. I have learned that having a healthy evening and a good night’s sleep means that I can wake up early and get a head start on the day, and that suits me a lot better than staying up late to work.\n\nI think work/life balance looks differently for everybody. For me, I truly want to spend as many of my waking hours as possible on my business because it is my passion and the most important thing in my life. However, I am no stranger to burnout each time I reach that point I gain a valuable lesson from it.\n\nSomething I have learned that I would like to impart onto others is to make sure you hold near and dear the activities, places, and people that recharge your batteries. For me, one of those things is a really nice long drive.\n\nWhat’s a typical day like for you? Are there any daily habits or routines that you rely on to keep your productivity and creativity flowing?\n\nI normally wake up at 6am and get to the office between 7-7.30am. I like to use this time before 9am when everybody else arrives to clear out my inbox, get any admin or deep work done. I also actually like to tidy up and vacuum the office as one of my first tasks for the day. I find it quite soothing and relaxing.\n\nTypically I will be in meetings or on shoots from 9am-5pm. I try to leave the office between 5-6pm so that I’m home early enough for a healthy dinner and a good night’s sleep. I find this is what really recharges my batteries and allows me to be up early feeling rested and working optimally.\n\nYou’ve mentioned seeing a breakdown in marketing industry culture. What changes do you think the industry needs to improve and better support its people?\n\nI think all content creators and marketers should be empowered in their unique contributions and respected as the artists they are. The onus is on agency leaders, clients, and the professional themselves to treat themselves and each other with a high standard of respect. I’d love to see us all taking pride in our work and communicating transparently with and lifting each other up.\n\nI think content creators could benefit from physical hubs that present content creating opportunities, and foster a sense of community. At CCHQ, it’s part of our long term goal to create several spaces like these across Australia.\n\nLooking back over the past three years with CCHQ, what have been some of the most rewarding moments? Have there been any challenges that really stood out?\n\nWe have had our fair share of challenges, especially launching as a one-man-band in a bedroom during COVID in 2021. However, the adversity we’ve experienced has only brought us more in alignment. During the lockdowns in 2021, we were restricted from shooting on site which prompted us to hone in on graphic design, which is now a huge part of our service offerings.\n\nGrowing a team from one to ten in over three years has also presented challenges especially with the high culture standard we uphold in the business. Being a leader and making decisions from that place always requires a high amount of attention and energy, but it is absolutely worth it.\n\nHaving the opportunity to actually practise that is one of the most rewarding things. As well as celebrating with the team the amazing work we do for our clients. In the past three years, we’ve produced marketing assets for incredible companies like Disney, Westfield, Mirvac, BMW, F45, Anytime Fitness, Culture Kings, Ray White, San Churro, YD, Oz Hair & Beauty, JD Sport, Lyres, and more.\n\nWe recently moved into a new office at the Oran Park Podium, and have on boarded the Podium as one of our newest clients as well. The pipeline of work is only getting bigger and more exciting.\n\nWe’ve travelled nationally and internationally to produce these assets, cracking new markets and giving our team some awesome experiences along the way.\n\nWe have been humbled to be named as Outstanding New Business at the 2022 Local Business Awards, and named as an Outstanding Business of the Year finalist in 2022 and Outstanding Specialised Business finalist in 2023. We were also very proud to be named a finalist in three categories in the 2022 Australian Small Business Champion Awards.\n\nWe are also very proud to be recognised by Macarthur Camera House as its #1 recommended marketing agency, which allows us to give back to the CCHQ team and the wider creative community.\n\nThinking about the future, what are your hopes for CCHQ and the impact you want to make on the marketing industry?\n\nWithin three years, we plan to have multiple studios on Australia’s east coast to service the rapidly growing content creation industry. Within 10 years, we hope to launch an international office.\n\nAt CCHQ, one of our most important missions is creating a workplace culture with a reputation for being the best. We want our team to wake up every day and be excited to come to work, knowing that they are appreciated and that their personal goals will be considered by the company. We would love to consistently be named as the best place to work in annual business awards and develop this reputation within the industry.\n\nAs we grow, our contribution to the community will grow too. We plan to eventually facilitate our own charity partnerships and hold fundraising events to give back to the community.\n\nIn an ever changing landscape, we plan to embrace technology and adapt to the integration of AI. We plan to let it help us, not hinder us.\n\nFinally and most importantly, we plan to continue improving client satisfaction and build stronger relationships with our clients and the wider community, absolutely being the culture change that we wished to see all those years ago."
