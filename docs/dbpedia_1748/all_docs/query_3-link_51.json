She continued this fight for justice until her passing in 2017 at the age of 105.\n\nChow Quen was known to be a determined, committed, and stubborn person who had a strong sense of justice, as well as a loving mother and grandmother. Her toughness helped her overcome war, poverty, a 14-year separation from her husband, and the drawn-out legal battle for government redress.\n\nA native of Taishan, Chow Quen married Guang Foo Lee in 1930, when he returned to China from Canada to find a wife. He was born in 1892, also in Taishan, and paid a $500 head tax in 1913 to come to Canada.\n\nChow Quen would travel in her wheelchair to fundraising events and rallies between Toronto and Ottawa to raise public awareness about Canada’s racist past against people of Chinese origin.\n\nAlthough the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed and subsequent appeals were denied, the efforts of Chow Quen and others set into motion talks with the government that ended in an official apology in the House of Commons on June 22, 2006.\n\nChow Quen was in the audience when then prime minister Stephen Harper apologized in Cantonese to Chinese Canadian communities.\n\nKew Dock Yip (1906–2001)\n\nThe first lawyer of Chinese origin in Canada, Kew Dock Yip (also known as Dock Yip) was born into a large family in Vancouver in 1906. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1931 with a degree in Pharmacy, intending to practice in British Columbia. However, due to the restrictions against the Chinese at the time, he was unable to enter the field. He attended the University of British Columbia and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1941, to pursue studies in Law. Because the Law Society of B.C. enforced a rule \"that Orientals should not be granted the privilege of enrolment as students-at-law\", he enrolled in Osgoode Hall Law School, which he graduated from in 1945. He opened his own law office in Toronto’s first Chinatown, where he would serve his clients for 47 years. Dock Yip provided much needed legal advice to members of Toronto’s Chinese community, was a mentor to many younger Chinese-Canadian lawyers, and was a community leader.\n\nIn 1942, Dock Yip, along with some of his Osgoode Hall Law school classmates enlisted as army reservists with The Queen’s Own Rifles of Canada. He befriended fellow reservist, Irving Himel, a Jewish lawyer. In September 1945, just after he was called to the bar, Yip and Himel collaborated with various activists and organizations to form a committee to repeal the Chinese Immigration Act, also known as the Chinese Exclusion Act. It had prohibited Chinese immigration to Canada since it was passed in 1923. The committee successfully lobbied for the repeal of this Act in 1947. Having this big achievement under his belt did not slow Dock Yip’s tenacity; he lobbied the government until 1966 to lower entrance barriers for immigrants of Chinese origin.\n\nDuring the 1970s, he served two terms as a school trustee on Toronto’s Board of Education. At the age of 79, Kew Dock Yip ventured into the world of showbusiness and acted in the movies Year of the Dragon, Diamonds (1987) and Fearless Tiger (1991).\n\nFinally, in 1992, he retired from his law practice at the age of 85.
