        "text": "The award ceremony may have to be virtual, but the prizes are as meaningful as ever. The SXSW Film Festival just announced its 2021 Grand Jury prize winners, with The Fallout and Lily Topples the World taking top honors in the narrative and documentary feature competitions.\n\nLaying out The Falloutâs win, the jurors called it âthe emotionally charged healing journey of a young girl whose life is forever changed in the wake of a school tragedy. Writer and director Megan Park delivers a timely, riveting, and thought-provoking film on the toll it takes on a teenager who is facing a world where they no longer feel safe. It is an intense, moving piece that highlights an important issue to which one canât help but feel connected.â\n\nThe documentary winner also follows the path of a young woman taking control of her life, but in a much more uplifting way. Lily Topples the World puts Lily Hevesh, aka domino artist Hevesh5, in the spotlight for a story of an outsider artist making her dreams come true. The jurors called it âa joyful portrait of grace in artistry and commitment in engineering, Lily Topples the World shows a life online that transcends virality and touches something deeper. In Lily Hevesh, aka Hevesh5, the film features a collaborative, creative soul who comes by community and entrepreneurship naturally. A rare achievement in nonjudgmental subcultural exploration and a gorgeously rendered portrait of burgeoning adulthood that tumbles forward, like Lilyâs domino art, into something beautiful.â\n\nOn the Texas side, it was a long wait for Without Getting Killed or Caught, Tamara Saviano and Paul Whitfieldâs exploration of the creative love triangle between Guy Clark, his wife Susanna, and best friend to both Townes Van Zandt. It was supposed to play at SXSW 2020, but was delayed and played this year as part of the festâs 2020 spotlight. Now it snagged the Louis Black âLone Starâ Award, named after Chronicle and SXSW cofounder Louis Black. The jurors called it âan examination of not just the life of legendary Texas singer-songwriter Guy Clark but the complicated, fascinating relationship between himself, his wife Susanna and his best friend Townes Van Zandt, all of whom made extraordinary work together and apart. The storytelling was graceful, densely layered and immersive.â\n\nSXSW runs through 12am Sunday, March 21.
