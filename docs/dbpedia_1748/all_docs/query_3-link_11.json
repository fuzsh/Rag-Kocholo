In 2007, he directed and produced \"Bolinao 52\", a documentary about an ill-fated journey of a Vietnamese refugee boat that later won 2 Northern California Regional Emmy Awards in 2009 for Outstanding Achievement in Documentary and Outstanding Music Composition. \"Bolinao 52\" was shown in over 15 international film festivals and was broadcasted in Japan, Australia, Europe and on PBS stations nationally. \"Stateless,\" his second feature documentary, won an Audience Choice Award as well as a Spotlight Award in 2013 at the Vietnamese International Film Festival. An eager traveler, he has done video documentary work in Vietnam, Cuba, the Andes Mountains and in the Amazon River, South America. In 2002, he spent a month in Ecuador documenting a group of archaeologists searching for a Pre-Inca civilization.
