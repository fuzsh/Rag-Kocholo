        "text": "1. Lars von Trier\n\nProbably the most ambitious and visually distinctive filmmaker to emerge from Denmark since the great master Carl Theodor Dreyer over 60 years earlier.\n\n2. Nuri Bilge Ceylan\n\nWith only several features, the Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan has become one of the most respected names in the european cinema scene, a contemporary master with an attentive, concentrated, slow-burn style all his own.\n\n3. Jean-Luc Godard\n\nA pioneer of the French new wave, Jean-Luc Godard has had an incalculable effect on modern cinema that refuses to wane. He was and always will be our greatest lyricist on historical trauma, religion, and the legacy of cinema.\n\n4. Michael Haneke\n\nAustrian film director and screenwriter, Michael Haneke is one of Europe’s most prominent and controversial auteurs working today. Common themes in Haneke’s dystopian works include discontentment and estrangement experienced by individuals in modern society – namely the European bourgeoisie, the personal suffering and increased disconnection experienced by humankind and the inherent cruelty and violence lying under the surface of modernity. His films are provocative and complex challenges to his audience and rely heavily on his interest in psychology, philosophy, spectatorship, semiotics and violence in the media.\n\n5. Krzysztof Kieslowski\n\nA Polish filmmaker of unparalleled merit whose simple stories deal with difficult, fundamental and universal questions about complex human feelings and their struggling to reconcile daily life with its cultural myths — be they Communist propaganda, Biblical proverbs, or French revolutionary slogans.\n\n6. Theodoros Angelopoulos\n\nGreek film director with a magisterial, dreamy, atmospheric and enigmatic style, whose films explored the human condition in general and the condition of modern Greece in particular through haunting imagery rooted in myth and epic.\n\n7. Michelangelo Antonioni\n\nItalian filmmaker Antonioni \"redefined the concept of narrative cinema\" and challenged traditional approaches to storytelling, realism, drama, and the world at large. His films are aesthetically complex – critically stimulating though elusive in meaning. With him, Fellini, Bergman, and Resnais, European art-house cinema was brought to a new height.\n\n8. Jean-Pierre Jeunet\n\nDespite what the film critics say, Jeunet has been a great infulence to filmmaking in France and around the world with unique style, quirky sense or humor and fantastic cinematography. His films present the perfection - every object, every movement, every facial expression in every scene has a meaning. Emotions are portrayed in a delicate way which makes the audiences sink in, watching the hilarious story unfold.\n\n9. Ingmar Bergman\n\nOne of the reasons one immediately recognises a Bergman film is that he is one of those rare filmmakers who has created his own cinematic world. He himself was hailed by many other legendary filmmakers as the greatest film director of the 20th century.\n\n10. Pedro Almodóvar\n\nAs Spain's most famous film director, he's also one of cinema's most visionary directors, and his films have shaped the way we see his country. What is it about him that resonates so profoundly with spectators worldwide? His signature, colorful visual style, his keen awareness of and sensitivity to the issues of women, his audacity when portraying a large cross-section of sexuality in new, thrilling ways...\n\n11. Wim Wenders\n\nWenders will always stay remain as one of my supreme hero of cinematic world, one of the most noted contemporary auteurs, the driving force behind the \"Neuer Deutsche Film\". His characters are isolated and emotionally stunted - but when they take to the road, change becomes inevitable. Every single frame were superbly photographed, leisurely odysseys reach metaphysical dimensions, and ipso facto, exposing heartbreaking sadness-induced raw emotion.\n\n12. Werner Herzog\n\nThe ultimate man with a life truly stranger than fiction. The German Legacy. He lets nothing get in the way of his passion because in the journey to perfection there is no place for hidden agendas or half-ass mediocrity. Everything has to be burned and fired away. Not only his films are masterpiece, Herzog seems to deliberately make himself hard to pin down, acquiring himself a legendary, almost mythological status in the process.\n\n13. Rainer Werner Fassbinder\n\nRainer Werner Fassbinder was a rebel whose life, a rampant drug addict; a wild, self-destructive libertinage but his films are so pure and demonstrate his deep sensitivity to social misfits and his hatred of institutionalized violence. One of the most innovative practitioner of New German Cinema, worked in fourteen years and made forty-four films!\n\n14. Alain Resnais\n\nThe cinema pioneer and leader of La Nouvelle Vague (French New Wave), who directed such great masterpieces like \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\", “Last Year at Marienbad\".... I don't have much to say because his name says it all!\n\n15. Jean-Pierre Dardenne\n\nSo much of modern cinema is built on visual flourishes and technological gimmicks that it’s easy to forget that the most enthralling special effect of all is the sight of characters moving through space, their body language, facial expressions and mundane actions telling you what they believe and feel. The Belgian filmmaking brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne believe this, and they’ve created a distinctive aesthetic around their conviction. The characters hardly speak but rather let their camera says it all.\n\n16. Fatih Akin\n\nThe young director Fatih Akin, born in Germany to Turkish parents became one of the most influential European directors at the moment. Akin consistently casts his probing gaze on the competing forces of these two distinct, but intersect- ing worlds (Germany/Turkey), revealing their resistances and collisions as well with a rich body of works, as their affinities.\n\n17. Gaspar Noé\n\nHis films punch you in the face, and they demand a strong stomach. But they are so damn delicious. Like a delicatessen we haven't had before. His three features: I Stand Alone, Irréversible, and Enter The Void are the most prolonged, extravagant experiments we haven't seen in a while, daring us to stay put in the seats. But it worths every single minute of them.\n\n18. Nikita Mikhalkov\n\nNikita Mikhalkov, the world’s most famous living Russian director, turns 70 on Oct. 21. He has been nominated for the Oscar three times for Best Foreign Film and in 1995 received the award for the film “Burnt by the Sun,” a drama set in the Stalinist era that is often compared to Victor Fleming's 1939 classic “Gone with the Wind.”\n\n19. Cristian Mungiu\n\nCristian Mungiu, director of the masterful 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days. At 44, Mungiu rides the crest of the Romanian New Wave with a modern root from Czech and New German Cinema Wave. He said, \"I aim to tell a story about important values by allowing the story to express itself and not impose my own interpretation. My responsibility is to present the situation and [let] the audience interpret it. I don’t think cinema should pre-interpret things for people.\"\n\n20. Roy Andersson\n\nRoy Andersson just might be one of the most interesting oddballs in the world of film. He demands we pay attention; he refuses to manipulate us with close-ups. And his filmic philosophy is also expressed through lighting. \"I want to have light without mercy,\" he says. \"There are no shadows to hide in. You are illuminated all the time. It makes you naked, the human beings — naked.\"\n\n21. Andrei Tarkovsky\n\nI remember watching my first Tarkovsky's film: \"Mirror\", a beautiful but complex film. French Philosopher Gaston Bachelard on \"Our Paradoxical Experience of Time\": If our heart were large enough to love life in all its detail, we would see that every instant is at once a giver and a plunderer. No human invention has rendered this paradox more pliant than the cinema. That’s what the master Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky examined in the the raw material of his art.\n\n22. Thomas Vinterberg\n\nIn 1995, a group of Danish film directors, including Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier celebrated the 100th anniversary of cinema with something as anachronistic as signing a manifesto, DOGMA 95. With a mixture of solemnity and irony, they pledged to rescue film from the decadence of individualism and illusion by means of ten rules laid down as a Vow of Chastity. Aimed at undressing film, the rules ban any use of unnecessary ornamentation - and as a result, his films are naked and raw and authentic, in both form and content.\n\n23. Giuseppe Tornatore\n\nThere is nothing more italian and sicilian than Tornatore's films. His films touch the soul of Sicily, transcending the ordinary, the conventional, the stereotypical - where he was born and raised.\n\n24. Béla Tarr\n\nWhen it comes to auteurs who look as if they could be characters in their own movies, the sixty-something-year-old Bela Tarr has to be near the top of the list. The Hungarian director is considered one of the most important filmmakers of his generation. With Sátántangó and The Turin Horse, he has coined a new concept of cinema thanks to a deeply personal design language.\n\n25. Zoltán Fábri\n\nOne of the most important directors of the 20th century, a key figure in the development of Hungarian New Cinema. Many of his films are the finest chamber pieces of Hungarian cinema such as: The Fifth Seal, The Unfinished Sentence, Aunts’ Nest, Balint Fabian Meets God, Hungarians, Professor Hannibal...\n\n26. Aki Kaurismäki\n\nMade over 20 films since 1980 including the most beautiful author films of recent years, the ingenuity of Kaurismäki's work lies in its simplicity and quotes Italian neorealism as well as the early films of the French „Nouvelle Vague“. Between Finnish tangos and punk music from his house band „Leningrad Cowboys“ with their characteristic hairstyles, Kaurismäki invented a cinema between cult and poetic realism.\n\n27. Emir Kusturica\n\nKnown for methodical work and long postproduction periods, Kusturica directed only two feature films in two decades 2000s and 2010s. Still,born in Sarajevo in 1955, he is the most important director of the former Yugoslavia who was one of the most-distinguished European filmmakers since the mid-1980s, best known for surreal and naturalistic movies that express deep sympathies for people from the margins.\n\n28. Jacques Audiard\n\nJacques Audiard has always been an outlier in a French film industry that is starkly bifurcated between high and low. Outside the omnipresent influence of Hollywood, there are commercially successful domestic genre films, often comedies so unsalable abroad it is as if they don’t even exist — and less expensive auteur films that an international fraternity of movie buffs and critics do like. Much of the latter would be economically impossible in the absence of significant state subsidies. But Audiard has managed to find a third way, something similar to what Martin Scorsese or the Coen brothers did — that is, distinctive and thought-provoking, plot-driven pictures that play for large audiences at home and be able to penetrate foreign markets.\n\n29. Federico Fellini\n\nOne of the greatest directors in international film history, the Italian Federico Fellini created a unique, unmistakable and imaginative oeuvre that uses the term “fellinesque” for grotesque characters in circus-like environments, big-breasted and voluminous women, rich dream worlds and fantasy-like ones Introduced picture sheets with bizarre-strange situations into the language.\n\n30. Jean Cocteau\n\nJean Cocteau is with 20 in the spotlight, next to Apollinaire, Picasso, Eric Satie. He is a poet and painter, musician, choreographer and actor. He writes novels and poems, works on ballets, paints and makes films.\n\n\"I'm not making a film,\" he said, \"I'm writing in pictures\". A film is created under Cocteau's hands, fine, delicate, always moving & flowing like a poem, a play, an image. Donors interested in art enable him to see the film as art and not as moneymaker.\n\n31. Roman Polanski\n\n32. Sergei M. Eisenstein\n\n33. Bernardo Bertolucci\n\n34. David Lean\n\n35. Luis Buñuel\n\n36. Tom Tykwer\n\n37. Luc Besson\n\n38. Lina Wertmüller\n\n39. Jean Renoir\n\n40. Jean-Pierre Melville\n\n41. Mike Leigh\n\n42. François Truffaut\n\n43. Dario Argento\n\n44. Roberto Rossellini\n\n45. Vittorio De Sica\n\n46. Terry Gilliam\n\n47. Carl Theodor Dreyer\n\n48. Richard Attenborough\n\n49. Jan Svankmajer"
