        "text": "Persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness are reportedly common for high school students in the US, with 4 in 10 students experiencing these emotions and nearly a quarter of them experiencing thoughts of suicidal ideation, according to a 2021 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTo help shine a spotlight on these feelings that are often kept in the dark, three Woodbridge High School students portrayed the important role friendship can play in a student’s mental health journey in their short film, “That’s What Friends Are For.” The film’s creators, Marleen Juarez, Pauline Nguyen and Mahi Thakkar have since won first place in the suicide prevention category at the statewide Directing Change Program and Film Contest, hosted at The Theatre at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles on May 16.\n\nIn the mental health category, University High School students Moses Fleischman, Alex Lu and Harrison Roberts-Dahlgren submitted the film “Sensory Overload” and placed third overall. Teams from Irvine and Portola high schools were also recognized.\n\nThe Directing Change program promotes awareness of mental health and suicide prevention by encouraging middle and high school students throughout California to create 30- to 60-second films on related topics. The nonprofit organization was formed in 2017 to help push statewide efforts to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, prevent suicidal ideation and increase awareness of the growing mental health crisis among youth.\n\nIn recognizing students that address these topics through cinematography, Directing Change aims to utilize these films to further support mental health awareness, education and advocacy efforts. For its 11th annual competition, the organizers received more than a thousand film submissions from 178 schools and community organizations.\n\nFrom 17 Orange County schools, 285 students participated this year and submitted a total of 95 films in the contest.\n\nBelow are the winning IUSD student films, categorized by statewide and regional honors:\n\nState Awards\n\nSuicide Prevention Category – First Place: “That’s What Friends Are For”\n\nWoodbridge High School\n\nFilmmakers: Marleen Juarez, Pauline Nguyen and Mahi Thakkar\n\nAdvisor: Megan Humphreys\n\nMental Health Category – Third Place: “Sensory Overload”\n\nUniversity High School\n\nFilmmakers: Moses Fleischman, Alex Lu, Harrison Roberts-Dahlgren\n\nAdvisor: Hali Kessler\n\nRegional Awards and Honorable Mentions\n\nSuicide Prevention:\n\nFirst Place: “That’s What Friends Are For”\n\nOrange County\n\nWoodbridge High School\n\nFilmmakers: Marleen Juarez, Pauline Nguyen, and Mahi Thakkar\n\nAdvisor: Megan Humphreys\n\nView & Download\n\nMental Health:\n\nFirst Place: “Sensory Overload”\n\nOrange County\n\nUniversity High School\n\nFilmmakers: Moses Fleischman, Alex Lu, and Harrison Roberts-Dahlgren\n\nAdvisor: Hali Kessler\n\nView & Download\n\nSecond Place: “Always There”\n\nOrange County\n\nIrvine High School / iTV\n\nFilmmakers: Bryant Saban, Brianna Ramirez, and Maryam Jalali\n\nAdvisor: Elizabeth Keller and Rebeccah Phillips\n\nView & Download\n\nAnimated Short Category:\n\nFifth Place: “Their Room”\n\nOrange County\n\nUniversity High School\n\nFilmmaker: Moses Fleischman\n\nAdvisor: Hanna Adessi\n\nView & Download\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n“The Helper”\n\nOrange County\n\nIrvine High School\n\nFilmmakers: Hope Wellikson, Ellie Irianto, Angie Baik, Jay Han, Isaac Kim, Cadence Yip, and Lana Alsamawi\n\nAdvisor: Elizabeth Keller & Rebeccah Phillips\n\nView & Download\n\n“In My Mind”\n\nOrange County\n\nIrvine High School\n\nFilmmakers: Aura Cisneros, Lana Phan, and Kaia Paul\n\nAdvisor: Elizabeth Keller\n\nView & Download\n\n“Coach Veronica’s Journey”\n\nOrange County\n\nPortola High School\n\nFilmmakers: Sharon Chen, Emma Suh, Jonathan Kim, and Josiah Lee\n\nAdvisor: Tina Murphy\n\nView & Download\n\n“Heavy Weight”\n\nOrange County\n\nUniversity High School\n\nFilmmakers: Moses Fleischman, David Du, Yonatan Marian, Shane Plourde, Ramone Hamilton, and Quentin Marino\n\nAdvisor: Martin Stibolt\n\nView & Download\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing depression, anxiety or suicidal ideation, here are a few free resources available to help:"
