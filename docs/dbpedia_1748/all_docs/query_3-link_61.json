        "text": "Join us while we chat with self-taught photographer Khoi Minh Nguyen, who is our 70th In Focus interviewee. Khoi tries to approach his photography as a still image in a movie and uses this medium to document life.\n\nSection 1 - Background\n\nShare your favourite image / print shot on ILFORD film and tell us what it means to you?\n\nThe image of my mother is my most proudest moment I had made last year. It felt like I was making work that I have been trying to make for a long time. My mother being the subject meant the world to me. Here was the woman that brought me into this life. The intimacy and vulnerability was genuine. She has lived a hard life and you can feel it through the pain in her eyes and the wrinkles that life gave her. When I say that this is the kind of work I have been trying to make, it is because of how honest the portrait of my mother is. To paint and show the character of someone in a single image is powerful. To give grace and dignity to the person who raised me is my complete honor. It was the least I could to make my mother feel seen, heard and appreciated.\n\nThe image is a celebration of who she is. Growing up and seeing my mother dress up in pretty outfits and to watch my father take images to document for our family back home didn’t really feel significant at the time but looking back, in a way it is what sparked my interest in photography. To be able to make honest, real images of the people I care about will always be my goal. It’s something I’ll be chasing and trying to improve on for the rest of my life.\n\nJust in case anyone doesn’t know who you are or what you do can you give us the overview?\n\nMy name is Khoi Minh Nguyen and I’m a self taught photographer based in the Midwest. I was not born in the US but I call Ohio home. It’s where I grew up most of my life. My interest in photography and the analog medium started my Junior year of high school. We had a darkroom that we were able to develop our negatives and make prints. You couldn’t get me out of there. I was always in there. To say I fell in love with the process is an understatement.\n\nMy work encapsulates all kinds of genres and subjects. My goal — no matter what it is — is to find the beauty in everything. I think the real beauty in life is in the small things. I try to capture the every day moments. What others might pass up, I find genuine beauty in. Photography for me is such a deeply personal thing. It is how I express myself, it’s how I communicate with the world. Existing in these times is very bleak, where there is so much pain and suffering. Being a creative and sharing your art is a protest in itself.\n\nHow and why did you get started shooting film?\n\nIn high school, I took a photography class. We had a darkroom and were taught how to develop B&W film and make darkroom prints. It didn’t take long for me to fall in love with the medium. Can vividly remember making my first darkroom prints and was just stunned by the results. Spent a lot of my time making prints in the darkroom back when film rolls cost $3 a roll. Having something physically tangible to hold in your hand was a special feeling. I regret that I never held onto my earliest darkroom prints. Back then, I didn’t think about the full potential of B&W photography but it’s something I have since remedied these past couple of years. I was 16 at the time when I first discovered the darkroom. It nearly took me half of my life to get back into it but nowadays, it’s a lot harder to get me out of the darkroom. Time doesn’t seem to exist when you’re making darkroom prints, you can get really lost in what you’re doing. Magic still exists, ask anybody who continues to make silver gelatin prints.\n\nWho has been your biggest photographic inspiration to date?\n\nI have a love for the masters of photography as much as contemporary artists. But to be honest, my biggest influence in my own work is cinema. Growing up, I started watching films that I was too young to understand. I started diving deep into older cinema; westerns, film noirs and French New Wave completely mesmerized me. These auteur filmmakers were taking creative risks and weren’t afraid to think outside the box. They made something out of nothing. They created beautiful works of art with a limited budget and crew. They took on the challenge and still flourished. I respected the hell out of these filmmakers making work that meant something to them. They put their heart and soul into their craft. I carry the same sentiment into my own work, I try to approach photography as a still image in a movie.\n\nWhat is the best piece of photography tip or advice you have ever received?\n\nThe best advice I ever got was to believe in myself. It’s as simple as that. You might not believe it in yourself and that’s completely okay. I feel as human beings, we are hard on ourselves. We spend a lot of time and effort worrying and caring about what other think of ourselves. That doesn’t get you far. After a certain point, it can become unhealthy. You have to take the time to practice self love. Artists are their own enemy.\n\nMy advice for younger photographers is to not give up on yourself. Never compare yourself to others, especially to the people you look up to. It will only cheapen the experience of image making. They did not get there overnight. It took a lot of practice and sacrifices were made for them to get to where they are. Just take it one day at a time — one foot and the other. You should always be proud of the progress you have made and the growth you’ve shown as a human being in this world. Give yourself the space to appreciate who are and what you bring to the table. You matter and are valued. Despite what others say or the voice in your head. Fight past the fear, find the strength in yourself. You’ll get to where you want to be by working hard and being your true self. Carve your own path. Make work that means something to you, always. I’ve been making images for over a decade but only recently these past couple years have I really been proud of the output. As long as you continue to push yourself and are honest with yourself about the work you’re making, you will see the progress.\n\nWhat film photography related projects are you currently working on (or are in the pipeline)?\n\nI have been developing and scanning all of my own B&W film for the last couple years. I’m also in the process of starting to also develop all of my C41 film as well. For which I have such a huge backlog from the last two years. It’s almost overwhelming. Ever since I started to develop and scan all of my own film, the desire to have something physical and tangible of my own work has been strong. Of course sharing work online, especially social media is the easiest way the general public to digest art. But I want my images to exist outside of that. Coming back to the last year darkroom has largely influenced me in seeing the work in a different light. I’ve been really focused on getting better at darkroom printing and it will likely take my whole lifetime to improve. It’s something I’m committed to doing, the analog process will humble you in all kinds of ways. I’m simply just a student of Photography and teaching myself through making all the mistakes I’ve made in the past is truly so rewarding when you get it right.\n\nI’m currently working on making a body of work that I want to be published someday. It’s my biggest goal when it comes to the medium but I think any photographer yearns to come out with a photography book. In the meantime, I’ll be focused on making a photozine of selected works from the past couple of years since I picked up the camera again in 2020, after taking a personal hiatus from 2017-2019. I’ve never had my work displayed like that but I think moving forward, it’s how I’d like to showcase it. Hopefully I can release a physical zine by next year.\n\nMy next project will likely take years to complete. I want to make portraits of my mother for every year she is still here. Those portraits I have already made mean everything to me. Believe I would regret not following through with such a deeply personal project. I want to honor and tell her story even if she’s not here forever.\n\nWhat / where is your next shoot and how do you decide what film / kit you will use?\n\nI never leave the house without a couple rolls of HP5+ in my bag. It’s my go-to film. I used to experiment with all sorts of different film stocks but lately I’ve only been sticking to only a couple. Eliminating the plethora of options makes me more focused on being present in the moment. I have accumulated a ton of cameras and lenses. They all serve a purpose and at this point, I know which one to bring for certain situations. Sometimes I choose a camera that wouldn’t be someone’s first choice but I like the challenge of it. That’s how I have fun, to make it more difficult than it has to be.\n\nWhat are your photographic goals going forward?\n\nIt took me half of my life to return to the darkroom but now that I’m back, I don’t ever want to leave. I’ve become obsessively focused on making darkroom prints. I learn something new every time I print. Darkroom printing is the most fun you can have trouble shooting what you did wrong. There’s so many variables that can affect the final print. Takes me about an hour to make a print I’m halfway happy with. If I can cut down the time of that, I’ll be in a good place. In the future, I would like to only present silver gelatin prints for future photo galleries moving forward. I take a lot of pride in self-developing, scanning and printing all my work. Self-sufficiency is key.\n\nPhotography has always been more of a passionate hobby of mine and I have struggled with towing the line of personal and commercial work. If I am able to make somewhat of a living from being commissioned to photograph, it would mean a lot to me to have those opportunities. I’m so grateful to the people who have in the past hired me for that reason.\n\nSection 2 - Shout outs\n\nWe all need a bit of inspiration and love so this is your chance to tell the community about yours – from the film photographers whose work inspires you, the labs you trust with your film, your ‘go to’ film photography stockists, your favourite community darkrooms or just anyone in the community who you feel deserves a special mention.\n\nGive a shout out to your 3 favourite film photographers.\n\nEvery time I get asked about giving a shout, there is always one person that immediately comes to mind and that’s Taylor (IG @taylarlar). Her work speaks for itself but watching her dabble more into 4x5 work is really inspiring. She spends a lot of her free time going on adventures with her partner Corey (IG @euphoriahiss) making gorgeous images of rural roads, abandoned buildings and everything in between. There is a peaceful stillness in her work, a slow contemplation of the natural beauty in this world.\n\nAnother person that comes to mind is Sara (IG @saraleopoldphoto). It might just be because I’m also a 6x6 shooter but I’m always so amazed by Sara’s eye and most certainly, her consistency. She makes such stunning work out of the ordinary. I can’t even put into words just how great her work is. Sara makes me want to become a better photographer period.\n\nLast but not least is Brandon St. Jean (IG @brandonjstjean) who makes my jaw drop every time he shares new work. His portraits look like paintings. He is a master of making portraits. I’m convinced he was put on this earth to do just that. I study his work to learn how to make captivating portraits. He has not shared new work in a while but I hope that he sees this and knows how much he is appreciated and supported.\n\nGive a shout out to your favourite photography YouTube channels.\n\nMy favorite Youtube channel is T. Hopper’s. Love her videos because they aren’t centered around gear. It’s more about the philosophy and inspirations. She is a wealth of knowledge, with in depth videos on subjects like Carrie Mae Weems, Gordon Parks, Fan Ho to even the work of David Lynch and polaroids from Linda McCartney. There is something for everyone on her channel. I’d suggest her “Female Film Photographers” series as a good place to start. www.youtube.com/@THopper\n\nGive a shout out to your favourite photographic retailers.\n\nI’d like to show love to a local photography shop called Western Hills Photo & Hobby (@westernhillsphoto). Stephanie, who isn’t the owner but has been working there forever. She does incredible 35mm scans, often times taking the work home on her off days. That’s just how much pride she has in her work. When you get back scans from her, they’re ready to share online or make prints from. And she’s kind as all get out and very knowledgable about the film medium. Sometimes I come in just to talk to her. That’s the kind of service she gives, it’s like coming in to visit a family member. They can make RA4 prints from digital files too and the prints are stunning. I recommend a lot of people in my own local photo community to give their business to Western Hills Photo.\n\nSection 3 - Favourite kit\n\nWhat film cameras do you own and which is your favourite?\n\nFor 35mm, I have an Olympus XA, Nikon FM3A, Leica M3 and Leica M4. For medium format, I own a Hasselblad 503cxi and Rolleiflex 3.5T. I couldn’t pick a favorite camera, they all have their place on the shelf. Every camera I own has its own story on how it was found and for that, my camera collection remains very sentimental to me. If I were to pick a favorite though, it would not be my Leicas, Hasselblad or Rolleiflex. The Nikon FM3A feels like an extension of my hand, it’s “Old Reliable.” I’ve also had it the longest (12 years) and when I do use it, the FM3A doesn’t get in the way of making images. I’ve taken it everywhere with me and it just does its job consistently and reliably.\n\nI’m not one of those people who buys a camera, only to realize it doesn’t work for them. Of course you don’t know until you use them but my mindset was always to do my research on the right camera for me. What gear works for me might be different for someone else. It’s about finding a camera that makes you feel inspired but also gives you confidence with its ability. I like fully mechanical cameras because I want something reliable without worrying about a dead battery or electronic parts malfunctioning. That is the last thing I want on my mind when I’m trying to photograph. Stick to a camera that feels comfortable to you and that you feel joy using. It makes a difference.\n\nAside from your camera, lenses and film what accessories make it into your camera bag?\n\nI always bring my Sekonic L-508, a shutter release cable and permanent marker. I meter thoroughly before taking a shot. The shutter release cable comes in handy for low light situations and I use the sharpie to label which camera I shot with and if I need to push the film. Before purchasing my light meter last year, my pictures weren’t turning out the way I envisioned. Especially long exposures. Getting a good external light meter will save you a lot of time, money and most importantly, headaches.\n\nAs this is an ILFORD interview it would be remiss of us not to ask about your favourite ILFORD products. Tell us you favourite ILFORD film, paper or chems and why?\n\nILFORD HP5+ is a religion and I’m here to spread the gospel. As I said before, I never leave the house without a couple rolls. The latitude on it is very forgiving even if you under or overexposed. It pushes well too. If you develop or scan your own film, HP5+ gives you a lot of flexibility whether you want a high contrast or flat look to your final edit. It’s the Swiss army knife of B&W film stocks.\n\nAnd finally…\n\nNominate one other person you think should fill in this form and we will reach out to them."
