        "text": "Out of the story’s dramatic and moving turns so much is revealed, including how coal miners, and the rest of us, are too often used as political pawns. And how we can get out of that trap, to have a chance at achieving more of the bigger picture outcomes just about all of us want.\n\nKim’s is a heck of a life story to date, and this provides the backdrop to the film. As a young person deeply concerned about climate change, he became a committed activist. In 2009 he cycled from Australia to Denmark to promote action on climate change, and was nominated for Young Australian of the Year. But it started to dawn on him that what he was doing wasn’t working. It wasn’t changing things the way he’d hoped. So he headed north, camera in hand, to dig deeper into what might.\n\nKim has also written for The Guardian, Al Jazeera, VICE and the Big Issue.\n\nThis conversation was recorded online with Kim at home in Sydney, on 11 May 2022."
