        "text": "The Academy Award for Best International Feature Film is one of the Academy Awards of Merit, popularly known as the Oscars, handed out annually by the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences(AMPAS). It is given to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States of America with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.\n\nWhen the first Academy Awards ceremony was held on May 16, 1929 to honor films released in 1927/28, there was no separate category for foreign language films. Between 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented Special/Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These Awards, however, were not handed out on a regular basis (no Award was given in 1953), and were not competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per year. For the 1956 (29th) Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since then. Unlike other Academy Awards, the Best Foreign Language Film Award is not presented to a specific individual. It is accepted by the winning film's director, but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole.\n\nOver the years, the Best International Feature Film Award and its predecessors have been given almost exclusively to European films: out of the 64 Awards handed out by the Academy since 1947 to foreign language films, fifty one have gone to European films, five to Asian films, three to African films and three to films from the Americas. Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini directed four Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award–winning motion pictures during his lifetime, a record that remains unmatched as of 2012 (if Special Awards are taken into account, then Fellini's record is tied by his fellow countryman Vittorio De Sica). The most awarded foreign country is Italy, with 10 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 27 nominations, while Israel is the foreign country to have the most nominations, 10, without winning an award.\n\nThe original name of the award was \"Best Foreign Language Film\". It was changed to it's current name in 2019 as it's original name was considered outdated.\n\nSpecial/Honorary Awards (1947–1955)[]\n\n20th Academy Awards (1947)\n\nWinner\n\nShoe-Shine from Italy — Vittorio De Sica\n\n\"The high quality of this motion picture, brought to eloquent life in a country scarred by war, is proof to the world that the creative spirit can triumph over adversity.\"\n\n21st Academy Awards (1948)\n\nWinner\n\nMonsieur Vincent from France — Maurice Cloche\n\n\"Voted by the Academy Board of Governors as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1948.\"\n\n22nd Academy Awards (1949)\n\nWinner\n\nThe Bicycle Thief from Italy — Vittorio De Sica\n\n\"Voted by the Academy Board of Governors as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1949.\"\n\n23rd Academy Awards (1950)\n\nWinner\n\nThe Walls of Malapaga from France and Italy — René Clément\n\n\"Voted by the Board of Governors as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States in 1950.\"\n\n24th Academy Awards (1951)\n\nWinner\n\nRashomon from Japan — Akira Kurosawa\n\n\"Voted by the Board of Governors as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951.\"\n\n25th Academy Awards (1952)\n\nWinner\n\nForbidden Games from France — René Clément\n\n\"Best Foreign Language Film first released in the United States during 1952.\"\n\n27th Academy Awards (1954)\n\nWinner\n\nGate of Hell from Japan — Teinosuke Kinugasa\n\n\"Best Foreign Language Film first released in the United States during 1954.\"\n\n28th Academy Awards (1955)\n\nWinner\n\nSamurai, The Legend of Musashi from Japan — Hiroshi Inagaki\n\n\"Best Foreign Language Film first released in the United States during 1955.\"\n\nNominations & winners (1956–present)[]\n\nBest International Feature Film By Decade\n\n1950s • 1960s • 1970s • 1980s • 1990s • 2000s • 2010s\n\n29th Academy Awards (1956)\n\nWinner\n\nLa Strada from Italy — Federico Fellini (Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, Producers)[1]\n\nNominees\n\nThe Captain of Kopenick from West Germany — Helmut Käutner (Gyula Trebitsch and Walter Koppel, Producers)[1]\n\nGervaise from France — René Clément (Annie Dorfmann, Producer)[1]\n\nHarp of Burma from Japan — Kon Ichikawa (Masayuki Takagi, Producer)[1]\n\nQivitoq from Denmark — Erik Balling (O.
