The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sympathizer, Nguyen expands the genre of personal memoir by acknowledging larger stories of refugeehood, colonization, and ideas about Vietnam and America, writing with his trademark sardonic wit and incisive analysis, as well as a deep emotional openness about his life as a father and a son.\nAll Encore Series, Create Your Own Series, and Super SAL subscribers receive a copy of A Man of Two Faces, shipped to their doors by our partner bookstore, Elliott Bay Book Company. Please note: complimentary subscriptions and single tickets do not include the book.\nQ&A with Thanh Tân.",
