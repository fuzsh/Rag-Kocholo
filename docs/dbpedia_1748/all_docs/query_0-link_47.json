Using shape driven design and construction, poses and character turnarounds, students will gain the technical skills required to build their own figures and work towards creating their own portfolio of work.\n\nSharing their work with their peers and instructor, students will receive thoughtful, in-depth feedback, culminating in the creation of their own character model sheets.\n\nTowards the end of the course, students will gain insight into the animation industry, including portfolio creation, professional design roles, avenues of study for college, and insight on industry design tests for jobs in animation and gaming.\n\nCourse Materials: Students can work traditionally, or if working digitally, students should bring their iPad or laptop. All other materials will be provided.\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMichael Allen\n\nGAMP0101 | Section 001 | Call Number 11503 - CLASS IS FULL!\n\nView course availability\n\nDesigned for students with experience in drama who are interested in developing original theatrical productions, the course emphasizes the working relationship between actor, director, and playwright, and the unique dynamic that exists between them when working on untried material.\n\nWorkshops and lectures during the first week introduce students to the demands of play development. Students then elect to specialize in one of three areas: acting, directing, or playwriting. The remainder of the course is given over to the development of short plays to be written, directed, and acted by the students under the supervision of theatrical professionals. In small, autonomous groups of actors, each with its own director and playwright, students create a production to be mounted at the end of the program.\n\nWorkshops are interactive, with the evolving pieces of each play periodically shown to the entire group for feedback in a safe, supportive environment. The course affords students a unique opportunity to experience the nuances of professional theatrical collaboration.\n\nOn the last Thursday of the session, several of the completed plays are performed for an audience of peers, friends, and family members. Students present one evening performance and one matinee.\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 10:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nDyana Kimball\n\nTCOL0101 | Section 001 | Call Number 10366\n\nView course availability\n\nParticipants learn all the basics of making a strong, visually-driven short film with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. The course focuses on the fundamentals of video production: essential film grammar, story development, script, music, and sound.\n\nWorking in small groups, students shoot three shorter pieces before collaborating to make a final film. The exercises start off simply, adding a new element of filmmaking with each new assignment.\n\nFor the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production participants learn how to work in a group to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production they work together to coordinate and shoot their script. And finally in post-production they edit and polish their projects. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students’ responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion.\n\nThe emphasis throughout the three weeks is on collaborative teamwork. Over the course of the various exercises, each student takes on a number of different roles within the production teams (director, screenwriter, cinematographer, editor, sound). For the final projects, only a handful of proposals are selected for production, so not every participant directs or writes his or her own film, though everyone plays a crucial role in the production.\n\nOn the last day of the program, students screen their completed films at a film festival attended by friends, family members, and other program participants. The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.\n\nStudents should plan to be available to work on their final films on the weekend preceding the final week of the program. Laptops are recommended but not required for this class. Cameras and other film production equipment are provided.\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMark Christopher\n\nDIFI0207 | Section 001 | Call Number 11608\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMaria Maggenti\n\nDIFI0207 | Section 002 | Call Number 12080\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMark Christopher\n\nDIFI0207 | Section 003 | Call Number 11609 - CLASS IS FULL!\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMaria Maggenti\n\nDIFI0207 | Section 004 | Call Number 12081\n\nView course availability\n\nStudio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.\n\nThis week-long class focuses on preparing the drawing portion of a fine art portfolio application for college submissions. As the week progresses, each student receives an in-depth critique from the instructor of their current work and of their plan for their portfolio. The course is focused on completing several large projects so as to showcase observational drawing skills, ranging from still life to architectural space to self-portraiture, as well as conceptual skills.\n\nThe course combines video demonstrations of drawing techniques, individual conferences with the instructor as well as online group critiques, and virtual studio visits with professional artists. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week through group writing prompts and online discussion, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work. An online demonstration of how to professionally document and edit work in Photoshop for a digital application concludes the week.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to contextualize their creative process through language and writing, with assigned creative writing prompts, short presentations, and an ongoing sketchbook practice. A final blog houses a virtual exhibit and work is shared regularly within the community on a social media platform.\n\nStudents will need to acquire their own materials, which will cost approximately $100. This course is intended for students ranging from beginners to advanced artists.\n\nSummer C: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 10:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m. and 1:00–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nIoana Manolache\n\nDRAW0100 | Section D01 | Call Number 12155\n\nView course availability\n\nStudio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.\n\nThis course is aimed at developing a series of foundational drawings for a fine arts college-application portfolio.\n\nStudents explore various approaches to drawing from both observation and imagination while focusing on conceptually creative assignments. Each session develops the students’ approach to various materials, composition, and personal narratives into completed works that can be used for a final portfolio. Students have prolonged time to study and sketch the human figure from live nude models in class. Ideas are explored through assigned writings and developed in a sketchbook throughout the course.\n\nA visit to a museum or gallery is scheduled as part of the course so as to facilitate discussion of relevant art historical concepts as well as contemporary approaches to drawing.\n\nLastly, participants learn how to prepare and digitally document works into a final portfolio for college applications.\n\nSome previous experience with drawing is recommended, and the course is designed for students interested in applying to a visual arts undergraduate program in the future.

The course emphasizes drawing from both observation and imagination as ways to learn traditional drawing techniques and foster creativity and personal interpretation. Course assignments stress observation while focusing on experiments with materials so as to find creative approaches to visual problem-solving. Assignments include exercises in composition, use of charcoal and pencil, graphic drawing techniques, wet media, color theory, and optical illusions.\n\nThe course combines studio work, including the study of the human figure using live nude models, with outdoor drawing, individual and group critiques, and visits to major museums and art galleries. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week in the form of a short seminar, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.\n\nParticipants also learn how to prepare a final portfolio for college applications, and the session concludes with a group show to which parents, friends, and other program participants are invited.\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–4:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nKatherine Blackburne\n\nDRAW0101 | Section 002 | Call Number 11604\n\nView course availability\n\nIn this course, students explore fashion with a particular focus on style and culture in New York City and then develop their own designs.\n\nParticipants get a first-hand look at the field through discussions with active figures in the fashion industry such as designers, marketing directors, and stylists. They take field trips to locations such as the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and the costume collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Readings on the history, theory, and culture of fashion include works by icons, artists, writers, editors, philosopher, and activists such as Diana Vreeland, Susan Sontag, Oscar Wilde, Bernard Rudofsky, and Marilyn Bender. As a springboard for inspiration and discussion, students view the works of a variety of designers through film clips and videos. Through explorations into fashion as art, students will encounter individuals who live and enact fashion through performative dress, at times challenging social and gender expectations\n\nHaving gained a firm grounding in the field, participants research and formulate their own original fashion concepts. Based on these concepts, they design their own unique collections. Concepts may center on a particular motif (e.g., technology as an extension of the human body), period or style (e.g., British monarchy, Imperial China, Ancient Egypt, imagined future, underwater or deep space), or material inspiration (e.g., mylar, fiber optics, recyclables, etc.). While sharing sources of inspiration and research discoveries, with attention to both craft and theory, in addition to producing individual collections, students engage in a collaborative design project.\n\nSummer C: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nEva Goodman\n\nFASH0101 | Section 001 | Call Number 11614\n\nView course availability\n\nThis intensive introduction to key concepts in architecture focuses on architectural history and theory combined with dedicated time for independent design. Participants are familiarized with the fundamental vocabulary employed to describe architectural ideas. The course covers how to analyze a building visually and formally, and introduces a spectrum of significant historical and recent designs while instilling an understanding of how the built environment is generated and transformed. Class discussions are supplemented with architectural tours of the Columbia University campus and visits to prominent works of modern architecture in New York City.\n\nHands-on application introduces participants to the conceptual skills employed by architectural designers.

From visiting museums to reading literature to listening to oral histories, absorbing the stories behind pieces provides perspective and insight into creative expression from all over the world. Through this course, students will explore a variety of works and learn how to analyze and discuss their complexities and meanings. Further, students will become acquainted with period pieces in multiple modalities (sculptures, videos, etc.) and discuss thought-providing interpretations from academics, philosophers, and theorists. Additionally, the course will have an experiential component, providing students with the opportunity to physically and virtually view major collections at NYC landmarks like the Frick, MoMA, the Whitney, the Guggenheim, and the Metropolitan. At course completion, students will be able to intelligently converse about art, as well as acquire a sophisticated foundation for further study.\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nThomas Ian Campbell\n\nARAR0103 | Section 001 | Call Number 10367\n\nView course availability\n\nNYC is one of the most exciting cities in the world. The city grid is filled with iconic architecture, from tenements to skyscrapers. This said, it is no secret that NYC has always symbolized extreme inequality and opportunity all at once. Where one lives in NYC determines access to jobs, schools, food, and even life expectancy. Additionally, with NYC being the most racially segregated metropolitan area in the US, poverty, racism, and unhealthy living conditions are both persistent and contested. Together, the real estate and social justice components yield community design opportunities that budding urban planners and architects need to explore.\n\nThrough this introductory course in NYC community design, students will learn how pressing social justice issues impacts planning, as well as activism. Additionally, through lecture and experiential study, students will learn how to pinpoint community needs, and plan neighborhood development around them. This course culminates in a small design exercise where students design a playground based on community needs.\n\nThis course is a good choice for students interested in community planning, social justice, environmental justice and in the social dimension of architecture.\n\nSummer C: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–4:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nThomas Wensing\n\nARCH0103 | Section 001 | Call Number 10388\n\nView course availability\n\nThis course introduces students to examine and understand the effects of the physical environment on human experience. The students will learn to see architecture not only as a material and formal practice but also as a social one. How does architecture contribute to community building, social (in)equality, and sustainable consumption of natural resources? The course will emphasize hands-on learning and contemporary architecture of New York City, engaging the city as a living laboratory for learning. In addition to learning through reading, direct observation, and analysis, students also learn to expand their imagination through model-making as a way of thinking with their hands, as well as sketching as a means to observe and analyze buildings.\n\nThe class will visit works of architecture in complex urban settings, which may include the Lincoln Center, the Highline, and the Grand Central Station, to look beyond appearance and to study social impacts of architecture. The course is suited for students who may be interested in studying architecture in college, as well as those who want to deepen their understanding of architecture through hands-on experiences.\n\n***Please note this course runs an additional hour in the afternoon to accommodate field trips and model-making.

Stylistic models from both the recent and ancient past have influenced how buildings look today. Likewise, social changes have shaped the way we inhabit the built environment. Understanding architecture in a historic context can enrich our experience of traveling, or of merely walking down the street where we live. It helps us connect our personal spaces and neighborhoods to places from different times and geographies.\n\nParticipants learn to recognize and describe the formal characteristics of architecture broadly defined as Classical, Medieval, Modern, and Postmodern while recognizing that few buildings are designed in a “pure” or exclusive idiom. We analyze historic and modern images of structures which exemplify the most recognizable styles of each era, region, or culture. We also look at current trends in global architecture. When possible, we visit New York City buildings that represent or evoke one or more styles under discussion.\n\nSummer C: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nNenette Arroyo\n\nARAR0101 | Section 001 | Call Number 10370\n\nView course availability\n\nStudio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.\n\nThis course is aimed at introducing students to basic oil painting techniques.

Readings, screenings, the analysis of clips and full-length movies, as well as hands-on exercises such as storyboarding, blocking, shooting, and editing a scene all combine to convey the excitement and artistry of film.\n\nWeek One:\n\nStudents learn how motion pictures developed their own language—their own, universally understood visual system of representation—by studying the masters of early and contemporary cinema: the edge-of-your-seat last minute rescue scenes of D.W. Griffith; the bravura long takes of Jean Renoir; the nail-biting tension created by Quentin Tarantino; and the nerve-tingling suspense that is the hallmark of Alfred Hitchcock. Using their smartphones, students try their own hand at conceptualizing, blocking, and editing scenes in the continuity style of classic Hollywood cinema.\n\nWeek Two:\n\nHaving learned Hollywood’s tricks of the trade, we branch out into international cinema, where other nations developed different systems of representation—their own languages—that challenged but also inspired the American film industry. Meet the Soviet style of filmmaking that revolutionized cinema in every sense of the word; the Gothic excess of German Expressionism, whose use of lighting, setting, and costume echoes in all contemporary horror flicks; and the samurai swordplay of Akira Kurosawa and its reincarnation in gun-slinging Hollywood Westerns. Each student writes a review of one contemporary American film that owes a debt to foreign cinema—or vice versa.\n\nWeek Three:\n\nPutting it all together, Week Three culminates in group analyses of some of the masterworks of classical and contemporary cinema such as Citizen Kane, La La Land, and Run, Lola, Run. We examine and discuss the ways in which sound and image, editing, and the elements of mise-en-scène combine to create transporting cinematic experiences that have the ability to make audiences cry, experience fear, feel empathy and joy and, above all, marvel at the magic of movies.\n\nAssigned readings include film reviews and essays on film analysis, technique, and history. Students are also responsible for an oral presentation on a specific scene, film, or director of their choice.\n\nPlease be aware that some of the films viewed contain violence and mature subject matter.\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMichael M.

Participants are guided through the new venture creation process as applied to student team-selected venture ideas. Through interactive lectures, short case studies, and structured peer activities, students explore the elements of the new venture planning process in an innovative modular format.\n\nFor each student venture, key issues are addressed in a fashion highly consistent with other formal venture-planning processes including: business model development, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, brand development and go-to-market strategies, team selection and management, profit models, financing, and legal considerations.\n\nStudents work through a series of structured activities and assignments that correspond with each phase of new venture planning. Throughout the class they refine their venture’s hypothesized business model on the basis of instructor and peer feedback. At each stage of venture plan development, they learn critical terms, apply tools that support research and decision making, and develop a deep understanding of how each major planning activity fits into formal venture creation. Additionally, they hone critical professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership. By the end of the class, participants have generated robust business models, with supportive venture plan documents, investor pitches, websites, and crowd-funding videos.\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nJack McGourty\n\nENIN0201 | Section 001 | Call Number 10358\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nStephane Goldsand\n\nENIN0201 | Section 002 | Call Number 10415\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nDaniel Ahmadizadeh\n\nENIN0201 | Section 003 | Call Number 10396\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer A: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 5:00–8:00 p.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nSarah Beston\n\nENIN0201 | Section D01 | Call Number 11783\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nJack McGourty\n\nENIN0201 | Section 004 | Call Number 10359 - CLASS IS FULL!\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nStephane Goldsand\n\nENIN0201 | Section 005 | Call Number 10416\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nDaniel Ahmadizadeh\n\nENIN0201 | Section 006 | Call Number 10397 - CLASS IS FULL!\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer B: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 12:00–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nSarah Beston\n\nENIN0201 | Section D02 | Call Number 11784\n\nView course availability\n\nThis intensive course takes an applied, practical approach to the development, testing, and validation of customer or community-driven product solutions. By learning and applying contemporary design-thinking concepts and tools, students generate innovative solutions to important customer or community problems.

Students acquire practical knowledge and tools focusing on the development, testing, and validation of new products that solve real customer problems and needs, from idea to early product development.\n\nStudents can expect to learn how to:\n\nidentify and articulate customer problems in an accurate way, reflecting how individuals truly experience the problem and its challenges\n\ncreate effective customer surveys to help validate your assumptions on customer problems (pain points), solutions, and benefits (expected outcomes)\n\nassess current solutions provided in the marketplace in order to build on best practices as well as identify gap areas\n\ndevelop a minimal viable product in order to gain additional feedback on specific solution features\n\nmeasure and validate customer needs fulfillment or social impact assumptions\n\ndevelop a solution (business or social enterprise) model to test your assumptions about customer interests, acceptance, and use\n\nIn-Person participants are expected to bring laptops for this class.\n\nSummer C: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nJack McGourty\n\nENID0101 | Section 001 | Call Number 10394\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer C: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nStephane Goldsand\n\nENID0101 | Section 002 | Call Number 10417\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer C: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 10:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m. and 1:00–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nSarah Beston\n\nENID0101 | Section D01 | Call Number 11785\n\nView course availability\n\nGame theory is the science of strategy. Within this ever-evolving field, practitioners are responsible for working through economic concepts that depend on rationality, as well as choice and uncertainty. Specifically, those working in this field help with optimal decision making between an independent agent and competing actors. The result of this work can take many forms, including when (and if) to launch a product and how to price it, or when to be cooperative in a negotiation (or not), or even whether to confess to a crime (or not). Throughout the course, students will study the works of key pioneers in Game Theory, as well as synthesize and triangulate readings to topics in economics, business, political science, and project management. Students will be expected to apply learnings to solving work complex probability sets and analyze decision-maker payoffs. By the end of the course, students will have a new appreciation for how Game Theory directly impacts - and influences - major decisions. Additionally, they will be able to work through choices and outcomes better in their own lives.\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nValerie De La Rosa\n\nECON0102 | Section 001 | Call Number 12085\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nAlejandro Reuss\n\nECON0102 | Section 002 | Call Number 12915\n\nView course availability\n\nFall\n\nSaturday, 10:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nECON0104 | Section D01 | Call Number 18692\n\nView course availability\n\nWhat is the impact of the resurgence of populism, nativism, and geopolitical competition on foreign relations and economic growth? Is China’s push to turn the renminbi into a global currency a threat or an opportunity? What are the implications of an unsustainable levels of public debt (U.S., Europe, Latin America, and Asia) on the future of international monetary and financial architecture? Given questions such as these, this course examines the interplay between globalizing pressures and national interests.\n\nWorking from a multilateral perspective, students use case studies to examine the nature of relations between nation-states in a period of increased economic and political integration. Topics include theories of international political economy in relation to foreign aid and sovereign debt, international trade and capital flows, security and non-state actors, rights-based approaches to development and humanitarian emergencies, energy sustainability, and the role of international organizations and financial institutions.\n\nFor counterpoint, students also examine the political, ideological, and social determinants of domestic political economies, including that of the United States. The political mechanisms of economic policy-making and the relationship between domestic policy and foreign policy are explored using theoretical, historical, and topical cases; examples include the political economy of income distribution and social welfare, national defense and hegemony, the national debt, and globalization.\n\nStudents examine these and other topics through lecture, research, academic and policy dialogue, group projects and presentations, peer critiques, and guest speakers. For students enrolled in the in person program, the course typically includes a visit to the United Nations Headquarters.\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nIsabelle Delalex\n\nEGLO0240 | Section 001 | Call Number 12088\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer A: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 8:00–11:00 a.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nAlexander Gordon\n\nEGLO0240 | Section D01 | Call Number 11797\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nElsha Yiu\n\nEGLO0240 | Section 002 | Call Number 12089\n\nView course availability\n\nSummer B: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 5:00–8:00 p.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nAlexander Gordon\n\nEGLO0240 | Section D02 | Call Number 11798\n\nView course availability\n\nThis course focuses on the firm’s financial and economic behavior.

What was once deemed a public value focal point has blossomed into a prudent investment strategy as research has indicated that companies demonstrating a commitment to sustainable business practices, in the long-run, outperform those that do not. The result has been a mass migration towards ESG and Impact investing.\n\nThis course is an introduction to socially responsible investing and an overview of the differences between ESG and Impact Investing. We investigate the relationships between ESG investing, outperforming market returns, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe materials presented in class as well as class discussions empower students to answer questions such as:\n\nHow can investing be reconciled with sustainability and achieving the sustainable development goals?\n\nWill ESG investing become the norm rather than the exception?\n\nWhat are the links between green finance and ESG investing?\n\nThrough a mix of introductory finance and asset management theories, class colloquia, and investment case studies, students gain an understanding of the challenges and opportunities embedded in sustainable investing.\n\nSummer C: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMichael T.

Almost every week brings new headlines about strikes or campaigns to form new unions in a variety of different industries, from auto manufacturing to healthcare to TV and movie production. This course will examine the subject of labor relations through the lens of economics by introducing some of the key tools that economists use to study interactions between workers and firms in the labor market. A major focus will be the role that collective bargaining can play in shaping the terms and conditions of employment, such as wages, benefits, and workplace health and safety protections.\n\nStudents will learn to define fundamental concepts in labor economics and labor-management relations, interpret theoretical models, and identify patterns in real-world data on labor market institutions and outcomes with the help of empirical methods. Class activities and exercises will offer hands-on perspectives on the subject matter, and will include an opportunity for students to practice negotiating their own collective bargaining agreement. Those who complete the course will come away with a greater understanding of how economists use theory and data to gain insight into the workings of the labor market and how unions function in the modern economy.\n\nSummer C: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 10:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m. and 1:00–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMatt Mazewski\n\nBUFE0103 | Section D01 | Call Number 11837\n\nView course availability\n\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other leading investment firms have predicted that the space economy will be worth trillions of dollars within the next few decades.

In the fields of sales and marketing, the connection is obvious, but when we apply to schools and interview for jobs our ability to frame our capabilities comes into play. The work of trial lawyers may clearly require the ability to influence judges and juries, but teachers, engineers, managers – people in every line of work – at some point need to convince others of a different way of thinking. Even in our personal lives, there are times when we want to change others’ minds.\n\nIn this course, students will – through reading, lecture, discussion, exercises, and activities -- learn the art, science and practical techniques used by the most successful marketers and salespeople.

What is the difference between writing that is merely confessional and writing that captivates, questions, and transforms? How do we tell compelling true stories about ourselves while probing the limits of our knowledge, the gaps in our memories, the stories that we don’t yet know how to tell? Writing a personal essay is not only a process of self-discovery—it is also the work of becoming the person capable of writing the essay.\n\nIn this course, we learn to write true stories about ourselves, the cultural artifacts and places we care about, the identities we hold in relation to power, and the ways our experiences change us forever. With the goal of producing up to three compelling personal essays, we explore the process of personal writing, from generating ideas to revising drafts. To become captivating narrators, we practice drafting skills essential to all nonfiction writing, drawing from reporting, research, and our personal archives—be it text messages, photos, or journals—to enhance the emotional specificity and intellectual rigor of our personal narratives.\n\nPart seminar and part workshop, this course introduces students to the genre of personal nonfiction and the practice of critiquing writing as a group. Through close examination of their own experiences and engagement with model texts, students develop storytelling skills that will transfer to their future writing in any genre.\n\nSummer B: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 5:00–8:00 p.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nJasmine Vojdani\n\nCREA0202 | Section D01 | Call Number 12152\n\nView course availability\n\nEngineering\n\nIn this Introduction to Engineering course, you will gain exposure to one of the fastest growing fields today.

It all starts and ends with the individual. What ails society and what good we see in it, is a reflection of the ethics and values we live. Together, we will learn about America’s intellectual revolution; the spark that Emerson lit and gave rise to the movement the transcendentalists embodied and that Nietzsche adopted as the core of his existential philosophy.\n\nThe Transcendentalists were an intellectual and social movement that shaped American politics, literature, social philosophy and education from the 1800s to the present. Using The American Transcendentalists: Essential Writings, we read, study and critique essays and letters; the speeches and correspondence between influential thinkers and public intellectuals who wanted to practice and live what they believed. From the Concord movement to Walden Pond, abolition and early feminism; transcendentalists brought their philosophy of collective social action to reality in the communities they built and movements they joined. Students will have an opportunity to debate the ideas of thinkers from the early to mid 1800’s; Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Louisa May Alcott et. al. Together, we will wonder if their intellectual revolutions are still relevant. Are there movements and traditions of collective social action that inspire us today?\n\nSummer C: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nAlec Milton\n\nPHIL0103 | Section 001 | Call Number 10407\n\nView course availability\n\nThis course introduces students to fundamental issues in philosophy of religion.

(d) Is it reasonable to believe in an afterlife for beings like us?\n\nWe broach such challenging questions by critically reading and writing about them, and in doing so we fine-tune our own views. The broad objective of the course is to develop and refine students' critical reasoning and writing skills.\n\nOther learning objectives include:\n\nTo acquire a richer understanding of and facility with the methodology that philosophers use to answer fundamental questions.\n\nTo develop an understanding of the different branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and moral philosophy.\n\nTo accurately interpret a wide range of historically influential philosophers’ works on fundamental issues in philosophy of religion, and in doing so sharpen our exegetical skills.\n\nTo critically assess, in a careful, charitable, and sophisticated manner, a number of challenging positions and arguments in philosophy of religion, and in doing so develop and refine our critical reasoning skills.\n\nSummer B: Online\n\nMonday–Friday, 8:00–11:00 a.m. ET\n\nOnline\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nJared Peterson\n\nPHIL0101 | Section D01 | Call Number 11841\n\nView course availability\n\nIn this course we explore modern literature from early pioneers such as Dostoyevsky, Dickinson, and Rimbaud through to the full-fledged modernism of Kafka, Woolf, and Hemingway, and beyond to the Harlem Renaissance, the Beats, and magical realism. We focus mainly on short fiction and poetry but may also look at excerpts from some longer works.\n\nWe consider not only the meanings of the works but also what it is about how they are written and constructed that gives them their power. While our approach is grounded in close reading and formal analysis, we also consider historical context and pay attention to how literature sounds and makes us feel.\n\nModern literature has had close ties to trends in visual art, music, theater, and film and so we may look at works from these other art forms and how they reflect back on written texts. The course also includes a field trip to the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nCourse participants are expected to contribute actively to class discussion, write a number of informal reaction pieces, engage in a few short creative projects, and deliver oral presentations on works of their own choosing.\n\nStudents learn how to read actively, think analytically, present their ideas effectively (both orally and in written form), and collaborate with their peers—all skills that will be invaluable to them in college and in their personal and professional lives. They also gain an understanding of and appreciation for modern literature.\n\nNo previous knowledge or course work is required.\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nMark Blacher\n\nLITR0101 | Section 001 | Call Number 10427\n\nView course availability\n\nThis course is designed for students who want to engage in lively debate on a philosopher's ideas, closely read primary texts, and investigate how philosophical concepts are present in our experiences today. In the process of delving into key philosophical texts about love, human excellence, and existential freedom, course participants are familiarized with the basic methodology of philosophical enquiry.\n\nWe begin by reading and discussing Plato's Symposium and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, their respective treatises on love and moral character (virtue ethics). Students debate questions related to the dialogue on love that Plato develops through the voice and character of Socrates. What is love and what does it mean to be a lover of wisdom—a philosopher? In the Ethics, students discuss the topic of human excellence and seek to answer how humans should best live their lives. In a practical sense, what is the purpose of human life and what is the ultimate goal of human endeavor? Why does Aristotle consider friendship a virtue, an excellence one must pursue if one wants a good life, Eudaemonia?\n\nHaving established the classical foundations, we move into the 20th Century and begin a dialogue and exploration of ideas on existential freedom, choice, and responsibility. We begin with readings to explore the ideas of determinism and indeterminism associated with various philosophies of freedom. Specifically, we focus on the foundational works of Jean-Paul Sartre’s concept of existential freedom found in Being and Nothingness and Soren Kierkegaard’s religious freedom from Fear and Trembling, which Donald Palmer introduces in Does the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosophy. This introduction serves as the foundation students need in order to grasp the idea of existential freedom articulated in the essays that make up Albert Camus' seminal work The Myth of Sisyphus. Through this lens students will debate whether it is practical to attempt to live an existential life and how philosophers as diverse as Nietzsche, Camus, and Sartre would define that life.\n\nIn addition to the readings, participants will have an opportunity to critique film and other art forms that present interpretations of existential themes.\n\nSummer B: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 11:10 a.m.–1:00 p.m. and 3:10–5:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nAlec Milton\n\nPENQ0201 | Section 001 | Call Number 10406 - CLASS IS FULL!\n\nView course availability\n\nHow is the mind related to the brain? Are sensations, beliefs, and desires immaterial or physical states? What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?\n\nWe explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.\n\nCourse readings include such influential works as René Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's \"Sensations and Brain Processes,” Hilary Putnam’s “The Nature of Mental States,” and Thomas Nagel’s “What is it Like to be a Bat?” Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.\n\nThe broad goal of the course is to sharpen students’ analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.\n\nSummer A: In Person\n\nMonday–Friday, 9:10–11:00 a.m. and 1:10–3:00 p.m. ET\n\nIn Person\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nJared Peterson\n\nPHMN0101 | Section 001 | Call Number 12212\n\nView course availability\n\nThis course introduces students to fundamental issues in the theory of knowledge. In this course we will critically address questions such as: (a) \"What are the unique kinds of knowledge and what is the relationship between these kinds of knowledge?” (b)\"Does knowledge require justification and if so, what does such justification consist in?” and (c) “What propositions can we know in light of powerful skeptical arguments?” We will investigate such questions by looking closely at how a number of epistemologists from a wide range of traditions have answered them. As we progress through issues directly related to epistemology, we will also see that these issues connect up with important issues in other areas of philosophy as well (e.g., metaphysics and moral philosophy).\n\nWe engage with such challenging questions by critically reading and writing about them, and in doing so we fine-tune our own positions concerning these issues.
