        "text": "SENIOR BOARD MEMBERS\n\nTHOMAS SCHUBERT\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THEATER MANAGER, AND FESTIVAL LIAISON\n\nTommy has been with the Asian Film Festival of Dallas for a little over 12 years and is very proud to now serve as the festival's executive director. A fan of the Asian Film Festival of Dallas since its inception and Asian films in general, Tommy is slowly learning the ins and outs of running the festival, and he is excited to support his fellow board members in accomplishing what they do so well.\n\nFor his day job, Tommy has been working at Garland High School in the International Baccalaureate film department for the last fifteen-plus years, and he has been the department head for going on a decade. Through his job, Tommy helps student members of the Reel Owl Cinema IB Film Program participate in the industry all over the country with their plucky and hilarious films. It's a job he treasures.\n\nWhen he's not working, Tommy can usually be found hanging out with his wife Leslie, his dog Shiner, or engaging in nerdy pursuits. Be it comics, D&D, cars, movies, or video games -- if it's nerdy, it's probably Tommy's jam.\n\nCECILIA LAI\n\nLEGAL\n\nCecilia provides legal counsel for the AFFD. She has been involved with AFFD since 2009 and enjoys sharing the experience of Asian films with a local audience that appreciates the art, culture, film, and music offered in Dallas. Currently, she is a Business Immigration attorney at Berry, Appleman, & Leiden. From 2008 until 2012, Cecilia practiced Entertainment Law.\n\nSHAWN SREEDHARAN\n\nFINANCE, IT\n\nShawn has been with AFFD since 2003. Currently his roles are in Finance and IT. He caught the film bug after his dad took him to watch the Shaw Brothers The 36th Chamber of Shaolin.\n\nBOARD MEMBERS\n\nLEE CARLTON\n\nMARKETING AND STRATEGIC OUTREACH\n\nLee is a second-generation Asian Film Festival Dallas board member, following in the footsteps of his father Stephen Carton, who helped co-found the festival.\n\nLee specializes in marketing and strategic outreach and recently completed his master’s in marketing and analytics at Texas A&M Commerce. Lee has worked at THINK Global School, the world’s first traveling high school, since 2010 and became the school’s marketing director in 2017, a role he still holds.\n\nLee began watching Chinese movies with his father in 1995 through weekly visits to the Cineplex Odeon theater in Richardson. Together they watched many films that have gone on to become classics, including Once Upon a Time in China, Drunken Master 2, Wing Chun, From Beijing With Love, among many, many others. Since those early days, his interests have expanded to include films from all Asian countries and spanning all genres (except horror).\n\nTheir love of Chinese films eventually led to a trip to Hong Kong, and since then, Lee has also had the opportunity to visit Japan and Thailand. Lee looks forward to sharing similar travel experiences with his daughter Bernadette and hopefully passing on the same love for Asian films that his father passed on to him.\n\nDAVID CHONG\n\nEDUCATION OUTREACH, DEVELOPMENT\n\nDavid has been a past volunteer with the Asian Film Fest for many years and is excited to now be a board member. He has previously served as an arts organizer with Kearny Street Workshop in San Francisco, where he connected with many local Asian American artists, including filmmakers and video artists.\n\nHe enjoys exploring the diverse Dallas art scene and meeting the tons of creative folks inhabiting this city. As a strong believer in the power of community, he tries to support many local organizations serving the LGBTQ community and other marginalized populations. He is also a proud Dallas CASA advocate.\n\nDavid is old enough to remember when the only way to catch indie and art house films was at the one special theater in town or if they miraculously made it to the local video store. He is grateful for film festivals like AFFD that continue to shine a light on smaller films that deserve more attention. He has worked in publishing, documentary TV production, and public radio journalism. Currently, he types and stares at computer screens for cash, aka digital marketing.\n\nKATIE GIMENEZ\n\nSECRETARY, FILMMAKER LIAISON, SPONSOR LIAISON\n\nThe daughter of an avid film fan with little regard for the concept of \"kid-friendly\", Katie developed a love of independent and foreign film at an early age. She has fond memories of family movie nights featuring films like Shall We Dance - no, not the one with Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere! Katie's favorite time of year is the week of AFFD, aka Family Movie Week, where she gets to spend countless hours watching great Asian films with her dad and sister.\n\nKatie caught the film festival bug through positions with Dallas Video Festival and USA Film Festival. By day, she serves as Marketing Manager for Reel FX.\n\nKYLE KONDAS\n\nEDUCATION OUTREACH, THEATER OPS\n\nKyle Kondas has been attending the Asian Film Festival of Dallas since 2000, serving as a juror for the shorts division for several years.\n\nKyle holds a BA in Art and Performance and an MFA in Arts and Technology from the University of Texas at Dallas.

This led him to the works of other notable Asian filmmakers like Hayao Miyazaki, Wong Kar-wai, and Stephen Chow.\n\nIn his spare time, Kyle enjoys podcasting, creating video art, playing retro video games, reading comic books, keeping up with the latest Tokusatsu shows, and indulging in all aspects of pop culture.\n\nALEXIS NGUYEN\n\nVOLUNTEER COORDINATOR AND SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nAlexis was an intern for the Asian Film Festival in 2016.

History repeated itself annually until 2020, after years of fandom, Josh joined the Board as Head of Memberships. Today, Josh oversees Grants in addition to assisting the Programming team. A few of his favorite AFFD-screened films over the years include EEGA, THE KING’S WRATH, MOUNTAIN CRY, and THE WAILING, and he recommends you stop what you’re doing to watch them immediately.
