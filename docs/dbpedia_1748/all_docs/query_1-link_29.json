        "text": "nVu Films is a luxury wedding filmmaking brand located in the DC, Maryland, Virgina region.\n\nOwner Vu Nguyen is a husband, father of two beautiful children, and an award winning filmmaker. He began experimenting with filmmaking and video editing in 2014, but has been involved with various visual art mediums since the age of 5. This includes studio art, drawing, painting, sculpting, and photography. Naturally, this translates to his creativity in cinematography. He left his 10 year accounting career to pursue videography full-time, and has built a boutique wedding film brand that is known all over the world. Beyond being passionate about the artistry, he is also dedicated to bringing outstanding customer service to all clients.\n\nWith nVu Films, you deal with a person, not a \"company\" or \"corporation\".

He is detail oriented and quick to respond to your inquiries via email, text, phone, snail mail, etc. Every film by nVu Films is uniquely crafted by Vu Nguyen.
