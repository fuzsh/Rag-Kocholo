        "text": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. (NCC NEWS) — After more than two decades in the military, a Syracuse graduate student is chasing his Hollywood dream.\n\nSean Spratt has had a passion for movies since he was a little boy. Growing up in Los Angeles during the 1970’s, Spratt knew he wanted to be a movie director one day.\n\nAfter working a handful of local news jobs, Spratt was searching for something fresh. Spratt was watching TV one night when something caught his eye.\n\n“It was happenstance,” Spratt said. “I was just flipping through the channels, and something was on that caught my attention. So, I just stayed on it for the end of it watching the credits roll, and that’s when I came across Combat Camera. And I was like, ‘This is what I want.'”\n\nSpratt eventually enlisted in the Navy, where he spent four tours as a journalist. The first two were on an aircraft carrier, but his last two were with Combat Camera covering Seal Team Two and other groups.\n\nJump forward to today, Spratt is pursuing his master’s degree in television, radio and film. Spratt’s toughest decision now is deciding how to balance his two passions: sports and movies.\n\n“I kind of have these two worlds that I’m standing in, and I don’t know which way I’m going to go,” Spratt said. “I don’t want to be like, ‘I’m going all-in on sports’ and then just forget the creative, cinematic side. And I don’t want to go all creative, cinematic side and forget about opportunities that you can have with sports franchises.”"
