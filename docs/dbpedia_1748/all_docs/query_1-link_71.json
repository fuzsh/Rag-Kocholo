But what if there was a device that respected your time, giving you what you need when you need it so you can get back to the more important things in life, like spending time with your family? That’s why Google created the Google Home Hub. It has all the voice assistant features we’ve come to know and love AND it has a screen because sometimes a glance is all you need."
