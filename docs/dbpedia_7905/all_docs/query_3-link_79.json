        "text": "Singer-songwriter James Blunt has sold more than 2 million copies of his debut album, “Back to Bedlam” (Atlantic), in England since its release this past summer, and his breakaway success is obviously infectious.\n\nHis single “You’re Beautiful,” a pleasantly inoffensive confection reminiscent of the best of David Gray and the most simple songs of Coldplay’s Chris Martin, has become ubiquitous on U.S. radio; his record’s gold and climbing the U.S. charts; and his coming-out party at an industry-packed pre-Grammy show at Hollywood’s House of Blues proved he’s not just a one-trick pony but a major rising talent.\n\nThat’s not to say that he doesn’t have shortcomings; critics have derided Blunt for the often emotionally simple lyrics of his songs — a charge clearly legitimate in some of “Bedlam’s” weakest, like the pseudo-groovy “Wise Men” (“Look who’s alone now/it’s not me…”). Where Chris Martin goes for obtuse, Blunt (who has a similarly falsetto-driven voice, with a bit more warble in it) aims for the literal. But the antiwar ballad “No Bravery,” here presented in a stripped down, solo-piano croon, is urgent and effective; though “You’re Beautiful” is being sung (and sold) as a love song, in actuality it’s a lost-love song — a subtle difference that allows it to be strangely universal to both those in love and those hurt by it.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOnstage, though, Blunt’s charisma takes over. He’s clearly made for big rooms, not only for his big, meaty, repetitive choruses but for his ability to look to the balcony and see over and through the audience while looking directly at them. His cover choice — the Pixies classic “Where Is My Mind” — was unlikely and could have been disastrous, but Blunt made it his own, eschewing a distortion pedal in favor of enunciating the song’s melody. For an up-and-coming new artist whose vision is far from singular, that’s definite evidence that Blunt has a good idea of his strengths — and the capability to extend them further."
