        "text": "Cultural Collabs Between Chinese And International Artists Set To be A Growing Trend\n\nWarner Music Asia announced today that iconic British singer James Blunt is releasing a special collaborative version of his song ‘Adrenaline’, featuring Chinese superstar Jason Zhang.\n\nThis special version of ‘Adrenaline’ is a true partnership between the artists and a musical meeting of minds. It is a blend of James and Jason’s styles which mixes perfectly as they sing alternating verses on this infectious track.\n\nJames Blunt is one of the UK’s biggest selling artists. He first captured the world’s attention in 2005 with his debut album Back to Bedlam, which was certified Double Platinum in the US, and its history-making classic #1 single, ’You’re Beautiful’. The British tunesmith has since become one of the most popular singer-songwriters of the modern era, earning staggering global sales of over 20 million albums and 20 million singles, while repeatedly touring to sold-out audiences the world over.\n\nJames has also been the recipient of a remarkable range of top honors, including five GRAMMY® Award nominations, two BRIT Awards, two Ivor Novello Awards (honoring British music and songwriters), and a host of MTV awards.\n\nPop idol Jason Zhang is one of China’s most recognized recording artists and performers. He launched his career in 2004 after winning the reality singing competition My Show, and shot to fame in 2007 after appearing on the audition program Super Boy on Hunan Television. In 2014, he participated in I Am a Singer, an iconic singing competition opened only to well-known professional singers by Hunan Television. Jason’s career has skyrocketed over the last 17 years since the start of his career. He has released 15 albums and has held concerts at Beijing’s National Stadium for two years in a row. He has also held 65 concerts internationally in 34 different cities.\n\nJason has received more than 190 accolades over the years. At various awards ceremonies in China he has been named ‘Best Male Singer’ 21 times, ‘Most Popular Male Singer’ 33 times and has won the award for ‘Best Song’ more than 70 times. He was named “Best Asian Artist” at the Mnet Asian Music Awards, and also became the first Chinese singer to win the prestigious International Artist Award at the American Music Awards. Jason has appeared on many reality television shows and has amassed a social media following of more than 90 million Chinese fans.\n\nJonathan Serbin, Co-President of Warner Music Asia, said: “We are delighted to announce this collaboration between James and Jason as it puts together two of the biggest stars from the world’s largest music markets. Partnerships between Chinese and international artists are set to be a growing trend as international acts want to tap into the vast audiences here and local performers want to take their place on the global stage. Pairing these two iconic artists together means that we can further grow their global audience and amplify their success.”\n\nPaul Samuels, VP A&R Atlantic Records UK added, “Jason is an accomplished artist. This track allows him to build his presence across the globe, giving fans who might not have known about him the opportunity to discover his talent. For James, who has already established a strong presence in China, the track provides an exciting offering for his growing fan base in the region. Their voices blend so well on this memorable track; they both really hope the fans will love it.”\n\nThe special collaborative version of ‘Adrenaline’ will be released today on all major DSPs."
