James Blunt's fifth studio album is unlike any of his past music and he is thrilled to have tapped into a different sound while working with a few major artists.\n\n\"I took two years and made an album that for me is more upbeat and it is not just me on a guitar singing some miserable songs,\" he says. \"I think I kind of put together a dream team of people to help. I worked with Ed Sheeran and Ryan Tedder, who is the lead singer of One Republic.\""
