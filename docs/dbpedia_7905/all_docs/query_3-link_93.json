        "text": "When you are the best selling artist of the decade, share Jacuzzis with naked supermodels and divide your time between LA and Ibiza, does it matter if the folks back home want to punch your face? For James Blunt, it's bluntly no...\n\nJames Blunt has a unique problem. \"A lot of people out there just don't like me,\" he says in a voice devoid of any emotion other than the slightest hint of surprise. \"I guess it's because of my music. It's my music they don't like.\"\n\nIs that it? It must be. I mean, what else could it be? He's a former captain of the Life Guards who served in Kosovo. He's really very good-looking. He's not a self-regarding obsessive, nor has he publicly disgraced himself, or done reality TV.\n\nSo that's it – it must be the music. Which brings us to the unique nature of his problem; it can't be the music at all.\n\nBack To Bedlam, his first album, has just become the biggest-selling album of the millennium. It's sold more than 11 million worldwide. The No 1 song, You're Beautiful, which put him on the map in the first place, is officially the most played song on radio and has taken over from Robbie Williams's Angels as the most popular \"hatch, match and dispatch\" anthem.\n\nScroll down for more ...\n\nEveryone loves James Blunt's music, even more (in terms of proportion of sales) than they loved Madonna or Oasis or the Stones, and none of those acts attracts the opprobrium heaped on Blunt.\n\nHe's not even an annoyingly good boy. He hangs out with Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, parties like a demon and dates and dumps starlets and supermodels like a latterday Rod Stewart; life is too short for just one girl.\n\nWe meet on the bougainvillea-covered terrace of the Bel Air Hotel in Los Angeles. I wonder out loud what naughtiness this most fantastically exclusive place has seen over the years.\n\n\"I once found myself in a swimming pool in LA with nine naked models and I was the only bloke,\" he offers, by way of humouring me. \"But I'd like to think any woman I have known has enjoyed being with me.\"\n\nI am sure they would. In America, he is feted as a god, as befits the man who has shifted more records than any other act in the world in the last seven years.\n\nScroll down for more ...\n\nBut in Britain it's a different story. The truth is that much of the abuse is surely class driven. This, after all, is an artist who has more in common with the landed gentry than the rank and file.\n\nJames Hillier Blount (his real name) was born into an upper-class military family in Tidworth, Wiltshire. His father, Charles, was a pilot and a colonel in the Army and his grandfather was Deputy Lieutenant of Norfolk. Blunt was educated at Harrow and Sandhurst via an Army-sponsored place at Bristol University.\n\nHe shrugs. \"The Army paid for my education, and the deal is you then serve in the Forces for four years which I was happy to do. I ended up serving six years.\"\n\nHe joined the Household Cavalry and served as a captain in the Life Guards, where, as a Nato peacekeeper, he led troops in Kosovo with a guitar strapped to his tank. (\"It was the best place to keep it,\" he says. \"It didn't get sat on.\")\n\nToday he is dressed in a pair of jeans, an old T-shirt and, with several weeks' growth of beard, looks more like a roadie than a superstar. He arrives on time, on his own and demands nothing more than a glass of Coca-Cola.\n\nWhen he speaks his vowels are perfectly enunciated, and although his appearance is relatively scruffy, his posture remains at all times ramrod straight. He surveys his surroundings with a half-smile. \"Isn't this pleasant,\" he says politely.\n\nHe is clearly not even attempting to look, act or behave like a traditional pop star. Even his hobbies set him apart (he is an exceptional skier and gained his pilot's licence at the age of 16, but doesn't get much time for either).\n\nScroll down for more ...\n\nIt is one club he does not naturally belong to. In a world where a criminal record and a hard-luck life are increasingly seen as the badges of \"cool,\" Blunt has committed several unpardonable sins: he is posh, privileged and his success has happened at the speed of light. Blunt shakes his head.\n\n\"Yes, I've had a pretty privileged life but I can't imagine in this day and age people would have a problem with that. It seems ridiculous.\"\n\n\"I spent years in the Army doing a job that was about trying to save lives. I'm proud of that. Why wouldn't I be? I worked with people from all walks of life, all parts of the country and we were in it together. No one ever judged you on your background. It was about what you could achieve in the given situations.\"\n\n\"I put my present unpopularity down to the fact that some people out there don't like my music. I'm not thought to be cool. But I can't worry about it.\"\n\nThe leap from Army officer to pop star isn't as strange as it sounds, says Blunt.\n\n\"I've wanted to be a singer since I was a teenager. At home we just had one CD player so I had limited access to music. But my mum made me learn the recorder when I was three, the violin when I was five and the piano when I was seven.\"\n\nHe was 14 and at Harrow when he discovered the guitar and rock music. His first guitar was a Fender Telecaster.\n\n\"The guys at school obviously had much bigger record collections than I had,\" he says. \"So they introduced me to different types of music: Led Zeppelin, the Pixies, Pink Floyd, a bit of Hendrix and a bit of the Doors, as well as the obvious things that teenagers listen to. That's where I first said, 'Yeah, I'm going to be a musician.' I just had to do a quick stopgap in the Army first of all.\"\n\nBlunt never let go of his teenage ambition while he was in the Forces, and his guitar was his constant companion.\n\n\"Occasionally, I was pulled out to be a performing monkey to boost morale and sing around the campfire. In a certain type of situation it's good to have something that will keep your mind amused and entertain others. I didn't play my songs; mainly I played other things that people wanted to hear.\"\n\nAt the end of 2002, he quit to pursue his dream (among his final Army duties was to stand guard over the Queen Mother's coffin). He didn't have long to wait. One of his first public performances took place at the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas in March 2003. He was spotted by Linda Perry, Christina Aguilera and Pink's producer, and was signed on the spot.\n\nBack To Bedlam took little more than three months to make. The initial idea was to attempt to sell 5,000 copies of the CD and build up a word-of-mouth following, but the plan fell apart – in the best possible way – with the unexpected success of You're Beautiful.\n\n\"I knew how lucky I was – I knew people out there were still struggling to get a deal and I was in this unbelievable position,\" he says. \"To be honest, I'm amazed at how fast things have been and how much success I've had. But you can't over-analyse things.\"\n\n\"You learn in the Army that things just happen and you get on with it. I don't stop and think about it. You just have to keep moving on. There's a new album – All The Lost Souls – and a new tour. That's my focus.\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you how much money I have, but I don't judge myself or my success by my bank account. I can buy a house [he has two, one in London and one in Ibiza] but the big difference to my life is that I can make music all day. That's my success.\"\n\nIn fact, Blunt made it into a rock rich list with a fortune of £9 million, a fact that caused Noel Gallagher to splutter, \"I'm not in it again. He's only been going for a year. I've been going for 12.\"\n\nBut Blunt is adamant he's not a celebrity. \"I'm a musician. I hate the obsession with celebrity – what you are wearing, whether you are cool... What has that got to do with anything?\"\n\nHe looks down at his worn, old T-shirt. \"I'd never go out and buy myself diamonds. To me, that's all wrong. I just couldn't do it. I spent time out in Kosovo where doctors from Médecins Sans Frontières are trying to save lives with minimal equipment and there are people with literally nothing.\"\n\n\"I don't do flash cars, I don't do flash clothes. I'm not really into possessions. They don't mean anything to me. I like to think I can carry everything I need. I've spent the past three-and-a-half years touring the world on a bus.\"\n\n\"I have one bag that contains two pairs of jeans, eight pairs of socks, six T-shirts, which I get free from my mate who runs a website, and a leather jacket. I've been everywhere from awards ceremonies to shows to parties. Maybe people think I'm a bit of a scruff but no one's said so.\"\n\n\"I just don't see the point in separating yourself off from normal people by the things you buy or the things you wear. That's like trying to make a point about being different.\"\n\n\"In London, I'll get the Tube or the bus and I'd rather go to a pub more than some amazing restaurant. When I go to Ibiza, I'll go on easyJet. It's cheap, it's simple. That's why people use it. I don't see any difference in me that would make me want to do anything else.\"\n\nHe has, however, made one extravagant purchase – an 1,100cc Moto Guzzi V11 Sport motorcycle. \"It's not the fastest, but it can induce a little nervousness,\" he says. It is, however, a little more agile than his former Army transport, a Scimitar tank.\n\n\"The tank's actually pretty easy to drive. It's got handles instead of a steering wheel, five forward gears and five reverse. Unlike being on a bike, if something gets in the way you tend to come off rather better – unless, of course, it's another tank.\"\n\nBlunt is slightly awkward in interviews. He has a problem talking about himself. He is unerringly polite but answers questions on a need-to-know basis, and turns understatement and evasion into an art form.\n\nOn Iraq: \"I never found the arguments for war very convincing, but what happens next? There are massive problems in staying and massive problems in leaving.\"\n\nOn girls: well, just ludicrously discreet, given he's been photographed out with Lindsay Lohan and seen surrounded by supermodels on a boat in Cannes.\n\n\"Do people really want to know about this sort of stuff?\" he asks quietly. Well, yes, James, actually they do. His last girlfriend, Czech model Petra Nemcova, discovered that she had been replaced only when she saw him with someone else in a magazine. His previous girlfriend, Camilla Boler, had suffered a similar fate.\n\nBlunt is rather shocked by the idea that he is perceived as something of a bounder when it comes to women. His face falls momentarily.\n\n\"Really,\" he says. \"Do you think people think that?\" There is a moment of uncomfortable silence.\n\n\"I don't ever discuss women,\" he says. \"But I have valued all my relationships. The problem is that gossip columns turn life into cartoons. It's not real. I'm happy with what does actually happen.\"\n\nOn drugs: even more vague. In his songs he sings about taking a \"s***load of drugs,\" and on stage at Hollywood's El Ray later that night, as he tells the crowd he's about to perform Give Me Some Love, he gleefully proclaims, \"This is a song about drugs.\"\n\n\"I have a good relationship with drugs,\" he says as he takes a sip of his Coke, then averts his gaze very slightly. \"I just think people need to educate themselves on the subject. That's all.\"\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss the rather awkward Mr Blunt and concur with the opinions of Gallagher and co. But that would be to miss the point. What motivates him is not what he wants to do but what he has done. His attitude to life is shaped by death and his experience in Kosovo.\n\n\"I'm asked all the time whether I ever killed anyone and I never really answer. To me the most terrible thing would be to try and exploit what I went through, what I saw. Surely you have to keep some honour. You can't come through a war and not be affected by it.\"\n\n\"The job in Kosovo was to stand between two warring peoples and try to save lives. What you face on a daily basis is life and death. It's that basic. It was very ugly and violent and vile.\"\n\n\"The images that remain in my mind are of talking to the local people –\n\nintelligent Serbians and intelligent Albanians. The thing that separated them was this fear and anger that had boiled over into a destructive force. And everything can be over in a second. You learn to live like that.\"\n\nIn many ways this explains Blunt, from his attitude to women to his attitude to fame: make the most of it and move on because you never know what tomorrow may bring. \"I haven't found any difficulty in adapting to this new life,\" he says.\n\n\"Because in many ways it is very similar. You have to be organised. I travel a lot, I meet lots of different people and every week I seem to wake up in a different town. The important thing is that I haven't changed. Success happened at an age when I was old enough and had been through enough experiences to have formed my character and my values.\"\n\n\"Now I wake up every day knowing how lucky I am, that I am doing what\n\nI always wanted to do. What was my dream has become my reality. The rest is just about enjoying it.\"\n\nLater that night, Blunt (wearing the same T-shirt and jeans) is on stage at the El Ray. Actress Reese Witherspoon arrives on her own and pushes close to the front to get the best possible view. The crowd whoops as Blunt leaps on to the piano to perform one of his hits.\n\nAt the after-show party, one TV executive describes a night out with the singer. \"I was told to give him a good time,\" he says. \"But in the end I had to leave him to it. He was the one dragging me round every club in LA. It was 5am and he was still going strong.\"\n\nBlunt laughs. \"The best training I ever did for this job was being in the Army. You travel, you push yourself to the limit and you get up the next day and do it all over again. The only difference is the money. Something's not quite right.\"\n\nAll The Lost Souls is out now on Atlantic. The single Same Mistake is out on December 3"
