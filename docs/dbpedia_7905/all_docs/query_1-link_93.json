        "text": "James Blunt recently stepped into the Radio 2 Piano Room for a stripped back performance on the Elton John piano. The whole amazing experience set us to wondering - isn't JB just great?\n\nJames Blunt performs Goodbye My Lover\n\nJames joins us in the BBC Radio 2 Piano Room to perform a song from his debut album.\n\nNot so long ago he was somewhat maligned by portions of the music press, but he's had a James-aissance and embraced what makes him unique. Here are seven reasons why you should be loving Mr Blunt right now.\n\n1. He's one of the funniest people on Twitter\n\nWhether he's clapping back to insults in witty and indomitable style, or sending himself up on the regular, James Blunt has one of the most worthwhile feeds on Twitter (but be warned - he's not afraid of fruity language).\n\nWe only wish we could be half as fast with our online quips.\n\n2. He's been bold with his latest album\n\nWhich superstar introduced James Blunt to Ed Sheeran?\n\nJames Blunt tells Chris about working with Ed on his fifth studio album 'The Afterlove'.\n\nWhile he's best known as a ballad writing troubadour, James took some interesting sonic risks on his latest album The Afterlove - with many tracks featuring a dance-orientated, electronic vibe.\n\nHe also worked with hitmaker Ryan Tedder and chart dominator Ed Sheeran, showing that those in the know think James is the bomb.\n\n3. He lays on a fun live show\n\nJames Blunt - Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park 2017 Highlights\n\nThe king of the romantic troubadours is sounding as beautiful as ever in Hyde Park\n\nJames created serious stage exit goals when he rounded off his stellar performance at Radio 2 Live In Hyde Park 2017 by launching himself into the crowd on an inflatable rubber dinghy.\n\nHe managed to crowd surf on his Union Jack vessel for a good minute or so, before it finally 'capsized.' We'll say one thing for him - he knows how to make an exit.\n\n4. He had one of the biggest albums of the Noughties\n\nIf it feels like James Blunt's hit You're Beautiful was everywhere for about a decade, that's because it really was. And let's face it, you know all the words, don't you?\n\nHe plays a good game in self-deprecation, but let's not forget that his debut album Back To Bedlam was actually the best-selling album of the 2000s in the UK. It also entered the Guinness Book of World Records for being the fastest selling album in a single year.\n\n5. He has two Ivor Novello Awards\n\nThat's right: not one, but two! Back in 2006, James picked up the awards for Most Performed Work and International Hit of the Year. But that's far from the extent of his gong-based accolades.\n\nFrom Best Selling British Artist at the World Music Awards to Best Pop Act at the BRIT Awards, James has amassed his fair share of awards over the years. His witty Twitter style even saw him nominated in the Best Band Blog or Twitter category at the 2014 NME Awards.\n\n6. He was best friends with the wonderful Carrie Fisher\n\nThis unlikely friendship commenced in 2003, when Carrie - a longtime family friend of James' then-girlfriend - offered him a place to stay while he tried to crack the US.\n\n\"We became very, very good friends by the end,\" Carrie told The Independent in 2006. \"He's a really good soul. I played his music to all my friends that came over, whatever celebrity crowd I could muster at my bungalow. I thought he was very good. I actually helped name his album. He didn't know what Bedlam was before I told him.\"\n\nConfirming that Carrie ensured The Force was always with him, James had this to say about the actress who championed him: \"Carrie fed me soup, showed me old movies and put a cardboard figure of her in Star Wars outside my room to protect me.\"\n\n7. He has a flair for self-deprecation\n\nCase in point: when James appeared on Sesame Street in 2007 and sang a parody of You're Beautiful, titled My Triangle.\n\n\"This shape was brilliant, this shape was pure. I saw three angles, of that I'm sure. And I saw three pointy corners, and then I saw three straight sides. The top was very narrow, and the base was so wide.\"\n\nMaths has never been so catchy!\n\nListen to James Blunt's Radio 2 Piano Room session here..."
