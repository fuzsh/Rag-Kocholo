        "text": "James Blunt is back with his brand new single Beside You.\n\nThe feelgood track is the first to be lifted from the singer-songwriter’s forthcoming seventh album, ‘Who We Used To Be’, and debuts an uptempo electronic direction for the You’re Beautiful hitmaker.\n\n“It’s a bit of a celebration, an upbeat banger about finally being with the one you’ve been searching for your whole life,” says James of the song.\n\n‘Who We Used To Be’ is due October 27 and features 10 new songs, marking his first studio LP since his 2019 album, ‘Once Upon A Mind’.\n\nTwo years ago, Blunt released his first greatest hits record, ‘The Stars Beneath My Feet (2004-2021)’, which features recordings from across his career along with four new songs.\n\nHis latest move comes on the back of a nationwide tour in 2022."
