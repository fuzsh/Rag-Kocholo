        "text": "Hi!\n\nI just wanted to give you a little background to me and what I am doing, have done and will do.\n\nI am a singer/ songwriter and composer from the UK who emigrated to Los Angeles in 2010. I’ve been lucky enough on occasions to be compared to such luminaries as David Gray, Damien Rice, John Mayer, James Taylor and Paul McCartney.\n\nIn 2005, I signed a publishing deal with Cheeky Music (Faithless, Dido) and subsequently a record deal with Champion records. In 2006, my song “Ache” was featured in the hit U.S. television series “Smallville.” Within 24 hours my previous website and Myspace site had taken over 130,000 hits, which led to me becoming the number 1 artist on Myspace in the US in that category for several months.\n\nSince the “Smallville” debut, “Ache” has also been featured on the hit US TV shows “ER”, “Side Order of Life”, “One Life to Live” and just recently “The Vampire Diaries” and “The Lying Game”\n\nAround that time my music came to the attention of film composer Klaus Badelt (Pirates of the Caribbean, Poseidon, The Pledge, 16 Blocks and Constantine).\n\nKlaus commissioned me to write a song for the Werner Herzog movie ‘Rescue Dawn’ starring Christian Bale for which he was composing the score. The song “Lights” ended up being used on the soundtrack of the film and became Herzog’s favourite song on the album. As a result Klaus ended up generously collaborating and producing and financing my record The Dreamers Machine and took over my recording contract from Champion records, signing me to his label, Label Zero based in Santa Monica, California.\n\nTwo of my songs were also used on the award winning documentary, Skid Row featuring Pras Michel fom The Fugees about the desperate plight of the homeless in LA and I was heavily involved in the score working alongside Craig Eastman and Klaus Badelt.\n\nI had the immense privilege of recording the album The Dreamers Machine at the infamous Henson studios, and it features some of the world’s greatest session players including:\n\nMichael Landau (Joni Mitchell, James Taylor) Luis Conte (Phil Collins, Madonna, Jackson Browne, Sade, Colbie Caillat) Tom Coster (Santana) Abe Laboriel (Dolly Parton, Elton John, Ray Charles, Madonna, Paul Simon, Quincy Jones, Leo Sayer, and Michael Jackson) Abe Laboriel Jr. (Paul McCartney, Sting)\n\n“James and Michael Landau”\n\nJames Guthrie, the Grammy Award winning producer and engineer of Pink Floyd, mixed an co-produced the album. It was mastered by Doug Sax who has worked with such luminaries as The Who, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, James Taylor and Jackson Browne. The strings were recorded with the London Metropolitan Orchestra at London’s famous Abbey Road studios.\n\nAs a writer, I’ve also composed the music for the 2009 Toyota online campaign, a Twinings advertising campaign with record producer and composer Magnus Fiennes, along with an album’s worth of material for a new girl group signed to Universal records.\n\nSince settling in Los Angeles in 2010 I have been hard at work co-writing songs for myself, other artists and for tv and film with the following award winning writers:\n\nSacha Skarbek (James Blunt, Jason Mraz, Jon Bon Jovi, Miley Cyrus)\n\nJohn Trivers and Liz Myers (Tina Turner, Eddie Money, Blue Oyster Cult, CBS Evening News)\n\nBlair Mackichan (Will Young, Paloma Faith, Lily Allen),\n\nMartin Briley (Céline Dion, N’SYNC, Michael Bolton)\n\nCraig Eastman (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Pledge, Willie Nelson, Ray Charles)\n\nMateo Laboriel (Sex and the City, The Proposal, Step Up)\n\nDavid Franz (Arrested Development)\n\nIan Honeyman (Pirates of the Caribbean, Miami Vice)\n\nJake Gosling (Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith, One Direction, the Libertines)\n\nPaul Freeman (100 years war, Roger Daltrey)\n\nI am in the process of producing original material for the forthcoming show Tin Star. Written and directed by Rowan Joffe for Sky Atlantic starring Tim Roth and Christina Hendricks."
