        "text": "English singer-songwriter James Blunt debuted with Back To Bedlam (2004), a collection of agonizing acoustic laments that pick up arrangements towards emotional apotheoses. High sounds almost like shoegazing. Out of My Mind turns noisy and loud. So Long Jimmy is the rocking song. However he found stardom with the ultimate romantic ballad You're Beautiful, and skeletal laments such as Goodbye My Lover. Billy sounds like a tribute to Billy Joel.\n\nAll The Lost Souls (2007) lacked even the few good things of the debut.\n\n(Translation by/ Tradotto da xxx)\n\nSe sei interessato a tradurre questo testo, contattami"
