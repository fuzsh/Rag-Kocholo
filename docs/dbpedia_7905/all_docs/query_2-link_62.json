        "text": "Lately, the music world likes to keep springing up surprises! I wonder, did mercury just come out of retrograde or something? For example, I never thought I’d find myself talking about the pop crooner James Blunt, but here we are. Until the New Music Friday releases started to roll out at midnight. The Grammy-nominated singer noticeably released one of the best songs of the week. And now, to top it off, he’s exploring the dance-pop genre with his new track “Beside You,” produced by The Six (Marshmello, Galantis, Clean Bandit and Alan Walker).\n\nJames Blunt has been a fixture in the music industry for over twenty years. He first gained fame as a pop crooner with his hit single “You’re Beautiful“. Now however, he appears ready to branch out exploring new sounds with his upcoming album “Who We Used To Be“, due out on October 27th. According to a recent press release that was sent out. James has collaborated with several talented producers from the pop and EDM worlds. These include Jonny Coffer (Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus), Red Triangle (Louis Tomlinson, Lukas Graham), Jack & Coke (Tove Lo, Charli XCX), and Steve Robson (Olly Murs, 5 Seconds of Summer). It will be interesting to see how James’s new music sounds and what kind of reception it will receive from fans and critics alike.\n\nHey, do you remember if James ever dropped a summer anthem? I’m not quite sure, but “Beside You” seems to be the first song from his latest album “Who We Used To Be” that could fit that description. According to James, “It’s a bit of a celebration. An upbeat banger about finally being with the one you’ve been searching for your whole life.”\n\nI really think that James Blunt’s “Beside You” will be a revelation to a lot of people. It’s not until they hear the song and later find out that it is by James that they will start to see him in a different light. I firmly believe that this track has the power to change preconceptions about his music."
