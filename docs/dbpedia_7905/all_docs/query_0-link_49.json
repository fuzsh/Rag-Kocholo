        "text": "British singer James Blunt has revealed in an interview that he refused an order while serving in the military, which may have been the catalyst for a world war.\n\nThe 'You're Beautiful' singer was at the head of a column of 30,000 NATO troops in Kosovo in 1999, when he was ordered to attack Russian troops, he said in an interview with the BBC.\n\nThe order to seize Pristina airfield, which was occupied by around 200 Russian troops, reportedly came from a US general.\n\n\"The direct command [that] came in from General Wesley Clark was to overpower them\", Blunt told the BBC. \"Various words were used that seemed unusual to us. Words such as 'destroy' came down the radio.\"\n\nBut Blunt held back, fearing the attack on Russian forces would escalate into a much bigger conflict. \"And that's why we were querying our instruction from an American general\", the singer said.\n\nBlunt claims he received support in the form of British General Mike Jackson, who reportedly said, \"I'm not going to have my soldiers be responsible for starting World War Three.\"\n\nGeneral Jackson then ordered the NATO troops to surround the airfield, cutting off the Russians' supplies of food and water, Blunt said.\n\n\"And after a couple of days the Russians there said 'hang on we have no food and no water. Can we share the airfield with you?\"\n\nBlunt says he would have refused the order, with or without Gerneral Jackson's backing, \"There are things that you do along the way that you know are right, and those that you absolutely feel are wrong, that I think it's morally important to stand up against, and that sense of moral judgement is drilled into us as soldiers in the British army.\"\n\nBlunt left the army in 2002 to pursue his career in music, and has since had worldwide hits with 'You're Beautiful' and 'Goodbye My Lover'."
