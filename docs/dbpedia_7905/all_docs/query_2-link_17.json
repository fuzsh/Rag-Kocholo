        "text": "After partnering with German DJ/producer Robin Schulz on “Okay” in May 2017, it seems James Blunt can’t shake the four-on-the-floor bug, as he now teams up with Lost Frequencies on their upcoming single, Billboard Dance can exclusively reveal.\n\nThe record, “Melody,” came about after Blunt had been writing in the studio with Steve Mac (co-writer and co-producer on Ed Sheeran‘s “Shape Of You”) and Ammar Malik (co-writer of Maroon 5‘s “Moves Like Jagger”) on a song called “Hey, Melody.” ?”It didn’t quite fit my album,” Blunt tells Billboard, “but I loved it, so when Lost Frequencies approached asking to work together I was thrilled.” He adds, “I was already a fan of his and really wanted the song to be heard. He plucked the chorus, worked his magic, and made a great summer track out of it.”\n\nFélix (Lost Frequnecies), who was ranked No. 95 on the inaugural Billboard Dance 100, was initially presented a remix opportunity. He says, “I’ve always been a James Blunt fan and when I got asked to do a remix for one of his tracks, we started talking and I proposed instead of doing a remix, it would be cool to make an original track together! That’s when James sent me the demo he had of “Melody,” where I started working on immediately!”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nHe continues, “I did bunch of different versions of the track, always checking with the whole team what they thought of it, until the final version was made and everybody loved it! It was a fairly quick process, considering we both were gone a lot on tour and doing a lot of other projects, I’m super happy we found a version of the track where both our worlds are perfectly balanced.”"
