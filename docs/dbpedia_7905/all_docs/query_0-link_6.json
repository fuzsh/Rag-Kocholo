        "text": "James Blunt is reinventing himself as a TV judge – and putting his palate to the test in the competitive world of beer brewing.\n\nThe 47-year-old star is well known for storming to the top of the charts with his albums Back to Bedlam and All the Lost Souls – as well as topping the singles chart with his iconic 2005 song You’re Beautiful.\n\nNow he is hoping to find new success as the face of a TV competition to find the best beer maker in the land.\n\nA new reality competition is being produced which will see small breweries fighting it out to be crowned the makers of the best pint – with pub owning singer James fronting the show.\n\nA source told The Sun: “James owns his own boozer, The Fox & Pheasant in London, and is a bit of a beer connoisseur.\n\n“The main premise of the series is going to be brewers showcasing some of the best small breweries in the world.”\n\nIt is expected that the competition will look beyond the shores of Great Britain to find fine ales from around the world.\n\nThe source continued: ”It won’t just be in the UK either — the idea is to try to get a number of competitors from across the globe signing up. Once on board, each of them will compete to see who has the best beer.”\n\nThey added: “James will be front and centre of the competition but there will be a judging panel of experts too, who will be the ones to make the decisions.”\n\nThe Sun’s report suggests the show will feature on Amazon – which already has some level of success in creating world travelling talent shows.\n\nHeidi Klum fronts a fashion series called Making The Cut which sees budding fashion designers from around the world travel battling to become winners of a prize that includes having their collection available to buy on Amazon Prime.\n\nWith Prime also delivering alcohol and groceries as part of their package, it is not inconceivable that the winner of the beer making contest could see their brew stocked by the online shopping giant and shipped out across the world.\n\nMeanwhile, James has teased fans that he hasn’t given up his music career completely.\n\nHe joked that he was making new tunes with fellow pop star Harry Styles in a recent social media post.\n\nHe shared a photo of the former One Direction star posing alongside American fashion photographer Ryan McGinley – who Blunty pretended was him as they share a striking resemblance – and joked: \"Writing new songs in LA with @Harry_Styles.\"\n\nHowever, he did confirm he was still performing music over the weekend as he took to the stage of Pub in the Park in Tunbridge Wells on Saturday."
