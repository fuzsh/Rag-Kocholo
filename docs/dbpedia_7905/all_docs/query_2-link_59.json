        "text": "As we approach #IndependenceDay2024, I wanted to provide a few thoughts to have you consider making an impact to #EndALS. Leo Tolstoy once said “If you feel pain, you are alive. If you feel other people's pain, you are a human being”. On July 4, 1939, after 17 seasons as New York Yankees first baseman, Lou Gehrig sadly retired from baseball using the following words in front of 61,808 fans to ensure that he was not going to let ALS define his career or his life: \"Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about the bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this earth.” Lou ended his speech, not with the “feeling of pain” but with these words of hope: \"So I close in saying that I may have had a tough break, but I have an awful lot to live for.\" Recently, on Jim Cramer Mad Money (https://lnkd.in/eCa2FM_C), Bill Nuti, Indu Navar and EverythingALS creates a call to action to put an #EndALS. As Jim Kramer says, “Nuti didn’t give up” instead he is bringing technology, data science and AI to #EndALS (https://lnkd.in/eib67b-Z). For those of us that know Bill Nuti from his work at Cisco and NCR Corporation, he is on a mission to replace people’s pain and ensure they know that they “have an awful lot to live for.” Bill Nuti, like Lou Gehrig, is not letting ALS define his life or his career. For those of us who have worked with Bill, we know he will never be defined by his “bad break” but by his leadership and inspiration. John Kieran, a New York Times Sports columnist, wrote a poem in honor of Lou Gehrig in 1939 but it could have also been written about Bill Nuti as both men have lived lives that where examples of “Hope, Gratitude and Blessings.” I have been honored to know Bill Nuti, learned from him and seen the impact he has had on many people. I think these words are fitting for the work he has done as a leader and his rallying cry to join him to #EndALS “We’ve been to the wars together; We took our foes as they came: And always you were the leader, And ever you played the game. Idol of cheering millions: Records are yours by sheaves: Iron of frame they hailed you, Decked you with laurel leaves. But higher than that we hold you, We who have known you best; Knowing the way you came through Every human test. Let this be a silent token Of lasting friendship’s gleam And all that we’ve left unspoken. Your Pals of the Yankee/Cisco Team.” Celebrate Independence Day by Giving to #EndALS (https://lnkd.in/eib67b-Z), and to reference Tolstoy, it will make you both “alive” and a better “human being”. Please repost and spread the word. Be well, remain kind and stay safe. Happy #IndependenceDay, America. Let’s do something to #EndALS.

Make the summer of 2024 the best by having the best music, BBQ and sports (hopefully baseball) create the atmosphere of celebration and fun. It is well deserved and your friends and family will assist in ensuring that you get this summer off to an amazing start. Enjoy. Also remember throughout the weekend that Monday is #MemorialDay and May is #MilitaryAppreciationMonth. Memorial Day has been a day in our history since 1868 that we remember the men and women that gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. Every Memorial Day Weekend (and often throughout the year), I re-read the Gettysburg address that reminds me of some simple facts including: “ …that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” During this solemn weekend, we remember those that have passed and given the ultimate sacrifice. Although we honor the living and the active military on #VeteransDay, May is also Military Appreciation Month which allows us to be grateful for the those men and women who are currently in service to our country or have been in service to our country. When is it wrong to say #ThankYou? I hope everyone has an amazing weekend and an amazing summer. Because I believe music is the great unifier, I could have attached many artists from Kate Smith to Bruce Springsteen. I thought I’d end with a song that states “and I won’t forget the men (and women) who died that gave that right to me.” Make this an amazing Summer of 2024. Happy Memorial Day. Be well, remain kind and stay safe, PSF."
