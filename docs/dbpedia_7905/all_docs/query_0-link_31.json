        "text": "Singer James Blunt has told the BBC how he refused an order to attack Russian troops when he was a British soldier in Kosovo. Blunt said he was willing to risk a court martial by rejecting the order from a US General.\n\nBut he was backed by British Gen Sir Mike Jackson, who said: \"I'm not going to have my soldiers be responsible for starting World War III.\"\n\nBlunt was ordered to seize an airfield, but the Russians had got there first.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 5 live, broadcast on Sunday, he said: \"I was given the direct command to overpower the 200 or so Russians who were there.\n\n\"I was the lead officer with my troop of men behind us...\n\nThe confusion surrounding the taking of Pristina airfield in 1999 has been written about in political memoirs, and was widely reported at the time.\n\nBut this is the first time Blunt has given an account of his role in the incident.\n\nBlunt, who was at the head of a column of 30,000 Nato troops with his unit, told Pienaar's Politics it was a \"mad situation\".\n\nHe said he had been \"party to the conversation\" between senior officers in which Gen Clark had ordered the attack.\n\n\"We had 200 Russians lined up pointing their weapons at us aggressively, which was... and you know we'd been told to reach the airfield and take a hold of it.\n\n\"And if we had a foothold there then it would make life much easier for the Nato forces in Pristina. So there was a political reason to take hold of this.\n\n\"And the practical consequences of that political reason would be then aggression against the Russians.\""
