The new long player features the bright and breezy uptempo rock track, ‘Beside You’.\n\nProduced by The Six, a Manchester collective who have worked with Clean Bandit, Marshmello and James Arthur, ‘Beside You’ is a feel -good summer anthem.\n\n“It’s a bit of a celebration,” James says. “An upbeat banger about finally being with the one you’ve been searching for your whole life.”\n\nListen to ‘Beside You’ here.\n\n‘Who We Used To Be’ is James’ first studio album since the acclaimed, top 3 album, ‘Once Upon A Mind’, in 2019. This time out he has worked with a variety of producers including Jonny Coffer, Red Triangle, Jack & Coke and Steve Robson. His recent greatest hits collection, ‘The Stars Beneath My Feet’, went Gold selling over 100,000 copies.\n\nJames Blunt has become something of a national treasure as he approaches his twentieth anniversary. He is respected for his honesty, wit, and charm as showcased on record, onstage and with his ever engaging twitter account.\n\nJames’ 2004 debut album ‘Back To Bedlam’ featured the global smash hit, ‘You’re Beautiful’, and is one of the top ten best selling albums of that decade. He’s won two Brit Awards, two Ivor Novello Awards and has received 5 Grammy nominations.\n\nWho We Used To Be Tracklisting\n\n1. Saving A Life\n\n2. Some Kind Of Beautiful\n\n3. Beside You\n\n4. Last Dance\n\n5. All The Love That I Ever Needed\n\n6. The Girl That Never Was\n\n7. Cold Shoulder\n\n8. I Won’t Die With You\n\n9. Dark Thought\n\n10. Glow"
