        "text": "Singer, songwriter and reluctant social media star, James Blunt has become something of a national treasure. Nearly twenty years after his 2004 debut album ‘Back To Bedlam’, which featured the chart-topping hit ‘You’re Beautiful’, James has two Brit Awards, two Ivor Novello Awards and five Grammy nominations under his belt and is adored for the honesty, tongue-in-cheek wit and charm prevalent within both his songwriting and hilariously self-aware Twitter account.\n\nWith the brand new album, ‘Who We Used To Be’ set for release this autumn on Atlantic Records, James marks his triumphant return with the bright and breezy uptempo rocker ‘Beside You’, a feel-good summer anthem which he cites as a celebration of “finally being with the one you’ve been searching for your whole life.”\n\nProduced by The Six, a Manchester collective who have worked with Clean Bandit, Marshmello and James Arthur, ‘Who We Used To Be’ is James’ first studio album since the acclaimed, top 3 ‘Once Upon A Mind’ in 2019. This time out he has worked with a variety of producers including Jonny Coffer, Red Triangle, Jack & Coke and Steve Robson."
