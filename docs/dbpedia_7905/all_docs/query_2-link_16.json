        "text": "When asked to pull up a lyric from his new album, Who We Used to Be, that sums up its ethos, James Blunt’s response is telling. He cites a starry-eyed verse from “Some Kind of Beautiful,” with references to winging through Elysia, shots in the dark and nights that never end. The kicker line: “Heaven’s a place where the lines get crossed.”\n\n“It just feels spontaneous and exciting,” the singer/songwriter we all know for 2004’s “You’re Beautiful,” and its album, Back to Bedlam, tells GRAMMY.com. More than that, it’s reflective of a sea change in his artistry 19 years on — the self-proclaimed past purveyor of “selfish songs about myself” is actively singing outside of himself.\n\n“The questions of life are about not just whether I'll be all right,” says the now-husband and father, ”but whether my children will be all right, the passing of time and how it goes so quickly and that fear that you'll miss out on that time with them.”\n\nEvery song on Who We Used to Be is permeated with this empathetic energy; another key line for him comes from “Glow”: \"I hope that this night never ends,\" he wishes aloud. “It's just that thing — life moves pretty fast,” Blunt says. And it certainly did in the Back to Bedlam days — and he feels lucky to still have a fruitful career, with a renewed label deal under his belt.\n\nRead on for an interview with the five-time GRAMMY nominee about how Who We Used to Be came to be, his memories of the mid-2000s music business, and the self-proclaimed irony of putting out a Greatest Hits release. (“I always joke it should be called Greatest Hit and Songs I Wish You Heard,” he cracks.)\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nWhat was the initial creative spark that led to Who We Used to Be?\n\nI think I'm just at a stage of my life where I've got a ton of different things going on, and that was what I was just going to write about is just the things that were inspiring me at the moment.\n\nAnd once upon a time, I was this young man with a dream to be a musician with so many questions of whether I would achieve that ambition, that dream. Who would I be? Where would I go? Who would I meet? Those kind of things.\n\nI've reached this stage in my life where lots of those questions have been answered. I've met the person I hope to live with for the rest of my life and married her and started a family. And I've been in the music business now for a little while, so I can feel pretty safe about that as a job.\n\nAll the questions I had when I was an aspiring musician, many of them have been answered. But at the same time, I've been thrown a ton of new questions. My parents are getting old, and they need looking after. Instead of them looking after me when I was a child, it's my turn to look after them.\n\nMy position in the world is changing, because I'm a family man, in charge of a family. Having kids raises these questions. And also there are moments of celebration and moments of sadness along the journey.\n\nI've been in the business now for 20 years. I've lost some friends… obviously, you write about those losses along the way, and lost some battles along the way. But fundamentally, it's also an album of celebration.\n\nIf I'm the guy who wrote “You’re Beautiful” about a girl I saw in a subway for one second, then having met the girl who I'm hoping to spend the rest of my days with, the songs better have bigger statements than just saying “You’re beautiful” to her.\n\nSo, that's why this album's got great celebratory songs saying \"All the love that I ever needed/ I got it from you,\" as an example. Oh, “I heard there's a song that God only knows and it's keeping me dancing beside you/ Nobody here knows how the melody goes, but it's keeping me dancing beside you.”\n\nThat's kind of the idea: just to capture where I'm at now, with its highs and with its lows.\n\nWhat would you tell that guy who wrote “You’re Beautiful” if you could?\n\nDon't take the blue pill. [Chuckles.] I don't know. I mean, that the same rules apply as now as when you're starting out, which are: follow your instinct. Don't be pushed into following what other people think is best for you, necessarily, particularly when it comes to art and music.\n\nSo whilst I have a beautiful relationship with my record label [Atlantic Records, since 2003], and I'm very lucky to be with them, sometimes, when you just go on your own journey, that's what makes things stand out.\n\nHow did starting a family change your perspective on art and the world?\n\nWell, I used to write selfish songs about myself — about what was going on in my mind. Now, I write songs with other people in my mind, instead — of people who are more important than me to me.\n\nThe questions of life are about not just whether I'll be all right, but whether my children will be all right, the passing of time and how it goes so quickly and that fear that you'll miss out on that time with them.\n\nSo, there's a song on this album called “Glow,” and it just says, \"I hope that this night never ends.\" It's just that thing — life moves pretty fast. Yeah so that would be it really, just thinking about other people, songs about other people rather than just about myself.\n\nBuild a bridge from that song to another in the tracklisting. Give me another one that takes you out of yourself.\n\nWell, pretty much all of them, I would think. “Saving a Life” is about someone else and the struggle that they have. As a friend to that person, it seems like the answer is so obvious. The way out of the struggle is so easy, but if that person doesn't want that kind of help, then it's not for you to help them.\n\nIt's a frustrating feeling. And everyone has that kind of friend who is either in financial difficulty or is in relationship difficulty or has a problem with addiction. You want to help them. But there's an ocean between you, and you can't.\n\nThe obvious other song on this album is a song called “Dark Thought” for Carrie Fisher, which it took me just a number of years to actually dive into — 2016. So it's taken me a while to write.\n\n*James Blunt. Photo: Michael Clement*\n\nHow did this translate to the music itself? How did it come to reflect that sense of empathy?\n\nI don't think I necessarily thought that the two had to go hand in hand. Each song has got a different idea, a different subject. And with that, every production has been just in keeping with the song, rather than anything else.\n\nWhat do you remember about building up these songs, and imbuing each with its own character?\n\nOnce upon a time, I would get in a studio for maybe four months with a producer like Tom Rothrock, who did my first albums. And we would just bury ourselves to make a body of work that was all interrelated and connected, recorded at the same time, in the same way, with the same musicians. There was a great beauty to that.\n\nI've spoken to him about, \"I missed that. I haven't done that with this album.\" More recently, what I do is I write a song with the guys that I'm in with. We produce it then and there. And there are pros and cons to doing that.\n\nThe con is that you don't craft that song as often and as much as I'd like. Sometimes, we want to go back in and change a lyric and it seems annoying. I have to go and see someone in Copenhagen when I just want to change one lyric, one word.\n\nAnd then, at the same time, the problem I've had sometimes with albums that I've crafted over a long period of time is they lose their spontaneity. You have demo-itis; people will go, \"Oh my God. I love the demo.\" And then you can just smooth off all the edges.\n\nSo, by writing a song and recording a song then and there, it keeps its excitement. It keeps that freshness of a fresh idea.\n\nHow did you and your accompanists jointly craft the sound of the record, the way you wanted it to strike the listener?\n\nWith everything I do, I just know that the more honest it is, the less considered, the less pretentious, the more genuine, then the more the audience will all connect to it. People can really hear that in me.\n\nSo, each song has a different production on it, because each song deserves a different kind of production. I just know to not overthink it, but just to enjoy and feel it.\n\nHow would you compare recordmaking and album cycles in 2023 to back when you got started?\n\nIt's a faster turnover. It's, sometimes, less considered. It's got this kind of organic spontaneity, which is great fun. If I had my way, I think I'd probably prefer to go and sit in a studio and do it over a decent few months. But sometimes, life moves pretty fast.\n\nBack then, how did your relationships change when you skyrocketed to global fame?\n\nWell, they say fame changes you, but they're wrong. Fame changes everybody else.\n\nYou walk down the street, and suddenly, when you get famous, everyone on the street behaves really strangely towards you. They all want a selfie and say \"Hello,\" and they can just respond differently. And so you kind of react to that. In the long term, you have to adapt to that.\n\nBut for me, I'm an English guy who was in the Army, who went to a boarding school. Sent away to boarding school when I was 7. I was very, very independent. But when the madness of the music business took hold, that's when I called my parents. I hadn't really seen them since I was 7 years old, not properly. I've just left home at that stage. And then I called them up.\n\nAnd I've always joked that my parents never saw me again. They put me into boarding school and never saw me again until I was famous. But the real truth is I called them when I got famous saying, \"I really need support. I really need my family around me.”\n\nWhen I've been spoiled — behaved like a trumped up little pop-star — they'd smack me down and tell me to act like a normal human being.\n\nAnd my friends, of course, from whether it be the army or from school or from university, if I was struggling with the press, I could call someone in the army and they'd say, \"You think you're having it hardcore. So-and-so's leg has just been blown off here in Afghanistan.\" That kind of would put things in perspective.\n\nSo, my close friends, and my family, have always been the same throughout that time, and I'm very grateful to them. Because I think they're the ones who've kept me a grounded, normal human being.\n\nI think what I was really lucky about is, I got into this business fairly late. I had a proper job. I was 28 when I got in the business. They always talk about young people who get in the business early. There's always that thing. You never grow older than the age you get famous. So, if Michael Jackson got famous at whatever age, he never grew up beyond that age.\n\nAnd you can see a lot of young people who go into the music business, they don't have a chance then to mature as adults anymore. And I was just lucky to have got in when I was older.\n\nNow that you’ve broken into this fresh emotional territory, what do you feel is next for you?\n\nMy Greatest Hits was released a couple of years ago. That was the end of my record deal. And then, fortunately for me, my record label called up and said, \"We'd love to sign you up to a new deal.\"\n\nNow, as you can imagine, the greatest hits, presumably, has all your best songs on it. So all these next songs that I'm releasing now or releasing in the future, none of them are going to be on my greatest hits. It already exists. So these songs are all just gravy. These are all bonus tracks in my life. So I'm just having great fun. I'm kind of liberated by the experience.\n\nTrain's Pat Monahan Revisits Every Song On Drops Of Jupiter 20 Years Later: \"I'm A Lot Happier Than I Was Back Then\"\n\nIt's no secret that Filipinos can unapologetically belt out a song from Celine Dion, Whitney Houston or any pop diva on the mic. But beyond the viral videos of them singing their hearts out in malls or in their homes, the Filipino music scene is vibrantly filled with heart and emotions; and often taken over by powerful soloists like the Philippine pop princess Sarah Geronimo, balladeers like Martin Nievera or Morisette Amon, and acoustic/rock bands like Ben&Ben or Up Dharma Down that often sing about love, heartbreak and life.\n\nWithin the last decade, we've seen an evolution in the Philippine music scene: while solo stars continue to shine, pop groups have begun to take over the spotlight. The concept of pop groups have existed before in Philippine entertainment, however, were usually formed through variety shows or composed of actors and actresses — not necessarily pop idols that you can compare in other Asian music markets like Japan and South Korea.\n\nIt really wasn't until 2018, during the peak of third-generation K-pop, where we saw the beginning of first generation Pinoy pop idol groups. Inspired and influenced by the K-pop idol training system, some P-pop entertainment companies have begun implementing similar systems, or inviting Korean mentors who are active in the industry for any vocal and dance training needed.\n\nTwo of the most notable first-gen P-Pop groups are SB19 and BINI, who are at the forefront of bringing P-pop to a global audience. Five-piece boy band SB19 became the first Southeast Asian group to be nominated for a Billboard Music Award in 2021, and their 2023 single \"GENTO\" was approved for GRAMMY consideration last year. Meanwhile, eight-piece girl group BINI have earned the title as the Nation's Girl Group after a string of successful viral hits including \"Salamin, Salamin\" and \"Pantropiko\"; just this year, they made history as the first P-pop act to perform at KCON in Los Angeles.\n\nOf course, the P-pop universe wouldn't be complete without solo acts. P-pop fans love to celebrate the timeless discography of Sarah Geronimo or gush over Asia's pop heartthrob Darren Espanto, and there's always new individual talent proving that the scene is still thriving.\n\nAs major P-pop stars continue to make waves, there's tons of blossoming acts who are helping to raise the Filipino flag in the global music scene. In light of the bright future ahead, here are a mix of P-Pop groups and soloists you should check out.\n\nALAMAT\n\nIf the actual country of the Philippines were a pop group, it would be ALAMAT. The six member group — composed of Taneo, Mo, Jao, Tomas, R-ji, and Alas — under Viva Records values Filipino culture in their concepts.\n\nEach member hails from different regions of the Philippines and also speak different dialects from their respective regions. Using dialects and culture to their advantage, ALAMAT often incorporates traditional folk dances, instruments, and lyrics in their native languages; and blends them into the modern sounds of hip-hop, R&B and dance.\n\nBGYO\n\nFormed in 2018 and officially making their debut under Star Music in 2021 with \"The Light,\" the quintet composed of Gelo, Akira, JL, Mikki, and Nate are known as the \"Aces of P-Pop.\" The name BGYO even celebrates their heritage, as it's an acronym for \"Becoming the change, Going further, You and I, Originally Filipino.\"\n\nOften fusing pop sounds with R&B, the boy group isn't afraid to get quirky with their concepts — whether they're singing a ballad in suits or wearing vibrant oversized ones. As a result, their music is helping BGYO score big wins: Their single \"The Baddest\" made them the first Filipino act to top Billboard's Next Big Sound chart in 2021, followed by P-Pop Group of the Year at the TikTok Awards Philippines in 2022.\n\nKAIA\n\nDebuting under SB19's former label, ShowBT Philippines, KAIA is composed of members Angela, Charlotte, Sophia, Alexa, and Charice. The quintet officially made their debut in 2022 with their lead single \"BLAH BLAH\" — a powerful EDM-pop track that can be considered for your gaming playlist.\n\nThe name KAIA is a double entendre: a Cebuano word \"kinaiya\" meaning one's self and personality; and the Tagalog word \"kaya\" which roughly translates \"to be able to\" or \"can do.\" In other words, a P-pop girl group that can give you the extra boost when you need that sonic encouragement on the daily.\n\nInigo Pascual\n\nOne of the Philippine heartthrobs, Inigo Pascual is a suave and smooth pop soloist who aims to make you swoon with his R&B-pop serenades. His pop-doowop hit \"Dahil Sa'Yo\" off his solo debut of the same name became the first song to top the Billboard Philippines Top 20 chart in 2016.\n\nRight from his debut, the actor and singer/songwriter continued to soar in his career when he released his international single \"Options\" in 2019. Just last month, the chart-topping singer unveiled his latest project, Basta't Alam Kong Tayo 1, a three-track single-album under Republic Records Philippines.\n\nG22\n\nIf you already listen to K-pop, then you are familiar with the girl crush concept where the sounds are bass-heavy and the looks are all about dark outfits with smokey makeup. If that's up your alley, then check out G22.\n\nUnder Cornerstone Entertainment, the former quartet-turned-trio composed of members AJ, Alfea, and Jaz are known to be the \"Female Alphas of Philippine Pop.\" The trio officially made their debut in April 2022 with their first single \"BANG!\" which was then followed by their second single \"Babalik!\" in May. But don't be fooled by their powerful demeanors — the trio also has a light and soft side to themselves in their B-sides and singles too.\n\nVXON\n\nIf G22 is dubbed as the \"Female Alphas of Philippine Pop,\" then VXON are said to be the \"Monsters of P-pop\" — so don't be fooled by the pretty boy looks VXON may carry. They are a P-pop group that can balance bubblegum pop with beast-like concepts, as if you're watching the transformation of boys to men. But at their core, they're making music to capture your heart (see for yourself with their viral R&B hit \"Sandal\").\n\nMaking their official debut in January 2022, the group consists of five members: C13, Franz, Patrick, Vince and Sam. After a big first year — they won Favorite Rookie P-Pop Group at Nylon Manila's Big, Bold, and Brave Awards in 2022 — VXON have continued winning hearts, most recently delivering a series of swoon-worthy live sessions on their YouTube channel.\n\nMaymay Entrata\n\nA multi-talented soloist, Maymay embodies Filipino entertainment, a fun and vibrant breath of fresh air within the Philippine music scene. She takes pride in her Visayan roots and stays grounded from her humble beginnings, even naming and singing her songs in Visaya, Tagalog and English.\n\nFirst known as the season 7 winner of \"Pinoy Big Brother\" in 2016, Maymay has made a name for herself as a musical artist in the last couple of years. Signed under the same label as BINI and BGYO, Maymay is grandiose in her music, presenting a plethora of genres in her discography, from disco to dance pop to a little salsa with visuals that encapsulate inspiration from Filipino culture. \"Her journey is only going further as she teased her first and upcoming international single \"Paradise\" at the 'ASAP Natin 'To in California' concert earlier this month.\"\n\nPLUUS\n\nFormerly known as SBTCBoys, the six-member boy group composed of Theo, Gab, Justin, Yen, Haro, and JL made their debut in 2023 with their first EP +.Y.M. (stylized and read as Time). Steering away from the traditional lead single promotions, PLUUS broke boundaries by promoting three tracks at once with \"Amigo,\" \"My Time\" and \"Cross My Heart\" last year.\n\nThe trio of tracks also displayed PLUUS' wide array of talents: \"Amigo\" is a hip-hop-heavy dance pop track celebrating camaraderie; whereas \"My Time\" follows the personal stories of being an idol; and \"Cross My Heart\" is a love song about letting go. They've continued showing their versatility in 2024, with the airy single \"Universe\" and the thumping track \"Summotion.\"\n\n1st.One\n\n1st.One was already putting themselves on the map, and embodying their name, before they even made their official debut in July 2020; the month before, they became the first Filipino act to perform at the Seoul Music Awards. The six members — Ace, Max, Alpha, J, Joker, Jayson — debuted under the Philippine subsidiary of FirstOne Entertainment in South Korea with their single electronic pop single \"You Are The One (Ttak Maja Nuh).\"\n\nIf you're into the nostalgic sounds of second-gen K-pop, 1st.One may be your seamless transition into P-pop. But just like any other group, they've explored different sounds and concepts; earlier this year, the group switched it up and dropped their R&B slow jam single \"Dito\" that was choreographed by member Max.\n\nDIONE\n\n1st.One's sister group, DIONE (or stylized as D1ONE), also debuted in 2020, carrying that girl crush aesthetic with them. Some members of the group were first introduced as LUNA, a project trainee group under FirstOne Entertainment set to debut. Eventually, the quartet composed of Joyden, DK, Clara, and Ella released their digital single \"BLING BLING\" in April 2022.\n\nUpon their official debut, the quartet's image delivered expensive pop, soundtracking their luxurious, high-fashion looks with EDM-driven pop — somewhat reminiscent of the sounds of second-gen K-pop groups like 2NE1 and After School. Their music is fun, energetic and quite tantalizing.\n\nYARA\n\nFairly new to the game, YARA is oozing with charisma, from their rap flows to their dance moves. Signed under Sony Music Philippines, YARA consists of four members — Gelou, Rocher, Christa, and Kim — who blend rap, hip-hop and pop all together.\n\nDebuting in March 2023, the P-pop girl group released their first single \"Adda\" (short for \"Apat Dapat Dapat Apat\"). Earlier this year, the group revived the old school bubblegum pop song \"Bakit Papa?\" by variety show girl group Sexbomb Girls, and gave it an R&B twist. Their recent track \"Katawan Flow\" sees the group making the dancehall genre their own — hinting that their musical direction will always be unpredictable.\n\nMaki\n\nMaki isn't your typical idol pop singer, but that's exactly what makes him a promising soloist. He seamlessly blends alternative rock and pop together, triggering a listener to get in their feels along the way.\n\nWhen he's not dancing to BINI's \"Cherry On Top,\" you can often find Maki strumming a guitar, questioning various love-related situations. And it seems his approach is working: his latest release, \"Dilaw,\" topped the Billboard Philippines' Hot 100 and Billboard Top Philippines Songs for multiple weeks in July.\n\nCALISTA\n\nOfficially making their debut under Tyronne Escalante Artist Management and Merlion Events Production in 2022, CALISTA is working toward being the next P-pop greats. Carrying more of a girl crush vibe, CALISTA's sounds blend dreamy pop with 808 beats and R&B.\n\nOriginally debuting as a six-member ensemble with the trap-inspired pop single \"Race Car,\" the group has spent the majority of 2024 as a quartet comprised of Anne, Dain, Elle, and Denise. Their latest single \"Let Me Know\" has made its way around TikTok, helping them get one step closer to achieving superstar status.\n\nECLYPSE\n\nOriginally known as YAMA, ECLYPSE is fairly new, but definitely promising, to the P-Pop game. Comprised of six former participants of reality-survival show \"Top Class\" (Lex, Gilly, Dean, Clyde, Gab, Joshuel) and one who was announced as a member on the live-streaming app KUMU (Rave), the group have been forming since 2022 and made their official debut this year under GKD Labels.\n\nWhether they're taking on a light or dark concept, their sounds revolve around the EDM genre — a seamless fit for their tones and voices. If you're a fan of synths, harmonies and falsetto, this may be the group for you.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nSummer may be slowly edging toward fall, but the red-hot streak of this summer's musical output shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThis New Music Friday (Aug. 16), Post Malone goes country with his sixth studio album F-1 Trillion, Meghan Trainor adds four songs (and rearranges the track list) to the deluxe edition of her latest LP Timeless, and global girl group KATSEYE unveil their debut mini-album SIS (SOFT IS STRONG). Plus, Muscadine Bloodline share their fourth full-length The Coastal Plain and Nikka Costa drops Dirty Disco, her first album in eight years.\n\nWhen it comes to singles, there's just as many new songs to explore — from superstar collabs like ROSALÍA and LISA's empowered \"NEW WOMAN\" to the latest releases from Hozier and Peggy Gou.\n\nBelow, dive into eight more new releases from pop and K-pop to rap, rock, country, dance, and more.\n\nLady Gaga & Bruno Mars — \"Die With a Smile\"\n\nLady Gaga and Bruno Mars gave the world just 12 hours notice that they were dropping \"Die With a Smile\" this week, sending Little Monsters and Hooligans alike into a tizzy as they braced themselves for the surprise duet.\n\nMars' sensual vocals lead off the moony, apocalyptic love song, which marks Mars' first release since his GRAMMY-winning work with Anderson .Paak as Silk Sonic. Strumming an electric guitar, the 15-time GRAMMY winner vows, \"I, I just woke from a dream/ Where you and I had to say goodbye/ And I don't know what it all means/ But since I survived, I realized/ Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.\"\n\nAs for Mother Monster's oeuvre, \"Die With a Smile\" lands somewhere between Joanne and \"Shallow\" as her fans wait impatiently for LG7. Not to be outdone, Gaga takes over on the second verse, supported by Mars' swooning harmonies as the duo crescendo the intensity of their devotion to meet the literal end of the world.\n\nLISA & ROSALÍA — \"NEW WOMAN\"\n\nOn New Music Friday eve, BLACKPINK member LISA added to her blossoming collection of solo bangers with \"NEW WOMAN,\" an empowering shapeshifter of a duet that sees her joining forces with ROSALÍA.\n\n\"Hit it when I serve/ B—, you better swerve/ Revving up my aura/ Focus on my mind/ Taking my time/ I'm a new woman, woman,\" the K-pop star proudly announces on the chorus of the song before Rosalía slams on the brakes to sing and rap her way through a sultry verse in her native Spanish that translates, in part, to \"I was born pure, yes/ Not an era will be a flop in my future/ W—, I'm Rosalía, I only know how to serve.\"\n\nThe accompanying Dave Meyers-directed video is filled with high-fashion looks (thigh-high boots on fire, that massive, floor-sweeping pearl necklace…or is it made of ball bearings?), Y2K nostalgia (flip phones!) and a bevy of quirky, genuinely off-beat moments that will be sure to help drive the conversation as LISA continues to establish herself — and her nascent LLOUD partnership under RCA Records — as a global force in control of her musical destiny.\n\nBenson Boone — \"Pretty Slowly\"\n\nFresh off \"Death Wish Love\" — his folksy contribution to the Twisters soundtrack — Benson Boone uses his newest single \"Pretty Slowly\" to celebrate his sudden rise as one of pop music's shiniest new stars.\n\nThe deceptively upbeat track's lyrics reflect on the dissolution of a relationship lost to all the recent, stratospheric changes in his life as he croons, \"Oh, how come all the best things fall apart/ And it started pretty slowly/ When you asked about the old me/ Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone/ Oh, I don't know/ I think I left him somewhere I no longer go.\"\n\nHowever, the song's accompanying music video acts as a both a victory lap in the wake of his debut album, Fireworks & Rollerblade, from earlier this summer and and energetic peek into the \"Beautiful Things\" breakout's high-octane live show — complete with thousands of ecstatic fans and his signature, onstage backflips.\n\nYG — 'Just Re'd Up 3'\n\nMore than a decade after his 2013 mixtape Just Re'd Up 2, YG adds to the series with the long-awaited Just Re'd Up 3.\n\nThe Compton native has released six other albums and a litany of other mixtapes and collaborative projects in the interim, and his decade-plus in the spotlight allows him to recruit a wide array of contemporaries for the two-disc LP — from Saweetie (\"SHE PRETTY\") and Ty Dolla $ign (\"IT'S GIVIN,\" \"RESCUE ME\") to Tee Grizzley and G Herbo (\"MALIBU\") and Lil Yachty and Babyface Ray (\"STUPID\").\n\nJean Dawson & Lil Yachty — \"Die For Me\"\n\n\"Die For Me,\" Jean Dawson's new collaboration with Lil Yachty, blends the experimental leanings of the L.A.-based polymath (and musical arranger on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER) with the bubblegum trap rapper's one-of-a-kind flow — and the result is magnetic.\n\nSonically, the swirling track feels like a logical follow-up to Bad Cameo, the \"Poland\" rapper's recent collaborative album with James Blake. After Dawson warbles the hook (\"Don't show up at my funeral/ If you won't die for me\"), Lil Yachty grabs the mic for a blunt-force eulogy that demands repeated listening.\n\nMorgan Wade — 'Obsessed'\n\nMorgan Wade preceded her fourth album, Obsessed, with delicate, heart-on-her-sleeve singles like \"2AM in London\" and \"Time to Love, Time to Kill.\" Arriving almost a year to the day since her previous full-length Psychopath, the country upstart — and occasional Real Housewives of Beverly Hills guest star — is just as vulnerable on the rest of the album.\n\nShowing off her aptitude for laying bare emotional storytelling and heart-crushing nostalgia, Wade cleverly exposes her fragilities and regrets across the album's 14 tracks — whether she's gender-flipping Shakespeare and competing with Romeo on the forbidden \"Juliet,\" finding somber inspiration in fairy tales on the wistful \"Hansel and Gretel,\" or duetting with Kesha on the repentant \"Walked on Water.\"\n\nFalling In Reverse — 'Popular Monster'\n\nSeven years since 2017's Coming Home, Falling In Reverse are back with their fifth studio album, Popular Monster. The LP's rollout has been spread across nearly half a decade, with the title track being released as the lead single way back in November 2019. Six additional singles have followed in the lead-up to the long-awaited project, including collaborations with Tech N9ne and Slaughter to Prevail vocalist Alex Terrible (\"Ronald\") and Jelly Roll (\"All My Life\"), as well as a reimagined cover of Papa Roach's \"Last Resort.\"\n\nAnd while Popular Monster's cover art is plastered with frontman Ronnie Radke's 2012 mugshot for alleged domestic assault, the release is hardly a solo project. In fact, it's the first Falling in Reverse album to feature Max Georgiev on guitar, Tyler Burgess on bass and Luke Holland on drums. (Derek Jones, the band's late rhythm guitarist, also contributed to the title track before his untimely death in 2020 from a subdural hematoma.)\n\nDJ Snake & Fridayy — \"Complicated\"\n\nFridayy is practically begging to keep things simple on \"Complicated,\" his yearning, pulsating new collaboration with DJ Snake. \"Tell me what you want/ Girl, I want to know/ Please don't make it complicated/ We ain't gotta complicate it,\" he repeats over the DJ's hypnotic rhythms filled with Spanish guitar and distant jungle sounds.\n\nEventually, the three-time GRAMMY nominee's desperate pleas morph into an atmospheric echo as DJ Snake's handiwork takes center stage, plunging the track into a spellbinding synth breakdown that dances all the way to the finish.\n\nThe Latest Pop Music News & Releases"
