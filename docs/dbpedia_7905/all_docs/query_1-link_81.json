        "text": "When James Blunt released \"You're Beautiful\" in 2004, it quickly became the most popular song in the world. The album it was on, Back to Bedlam, became the best selling album of the 2000s in the UK. But James was already in his 30s when that song broke, and before that he lived a completely different life. In this episode, you'll hear about James' time in the British army leading NATO troops in Kosovo, his stint as one of Queen Elizabeth's ceremonial bodyguards, and how he randomly became roommates with Carrie Fisher while recording his first album.\n\nLinks from the Show\n\n01.
