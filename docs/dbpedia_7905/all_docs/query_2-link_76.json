        "text": "SAM INSTONE used to be an officer in the Household Cavalry and was once a housemate of James Blunt. Sam is happy to admit that he’s rather dull in comparison to his now famous fellow soldier. Blunt left the Army to become a multi-award-winning singer, selling more than 20 million albums worldwide. Sam Instone, meanwhile, has built an international financial planning business around being boring. And, as he explains, it’s a philosophy that has served his clients rather well.\n\nI recently read an article about why boring is beautiful in investing. It caught my eye because being boring is something I can relate to.\n\nI only need to think back to my Army days. Back in 2000, I was a young officer in the Household Cavalry. In our Officer’s House, lived the very talented James Hillier Blount (later James Blunt).\n\nWhilst having similar jobs, we were otherwise quite opposite. Even before he became a world-famous musician, James was the life and soul of the party. He serenaded girls regularly. Was captain of the ski team. An awesome horseman. And an epic soldier who has some great war stories.\n\nI, on the other hand, read books and played chess. Just three years later, he was one of the biggest-selling singers in the world. Safe to say, his life is pretty exciting. Mine, in contrast, is pretty dull. But I’m unapologetically happy about that.\n\nBoring is better for investors\n\nIn fact, I’ve built a business around being boring. Based on decades of Nobel prize-winning research. Because quite frankly, boring is better for investors.\n\nJust look at this year. Right now, ‘exciting’ portfolios are suffering more than most. It’s like investors are constantly faced with two plates. On one, chocolate cake and on the other, broccoli. Which do most people want?\n\nChances are, they want the cake. And this is normal. Even though their neocortex is telling them the broccoli will keep them alive longer and is better for their body, skin, and immune system, the irrational part of their brain has primal cravings.\n\nThey have control, but make a poor decision. They bite the cake.\n\nThis is how it plays out in investment terms, since January this year:\n\nDimensional at the top, is broccoli.\n\nVanguard LifeStrategy, a handsome five percent below it, spinach.\n\nAt the bottom, you’ve got the remarkably popular Ark Innovation fund and below that Bitcoin, also known as chocolate cake with lashings of cream.\n\nIndexing doesn’t make for great conversation\n\nWe live in a time of FOMO, with get-rich-quick ‘opportunities’ everywhere.\n\nSuccessful investing should be boring. It should be long-term in nature. It requires patience and discipline and the ability to ignore the madness of the crowds.\n\nBut you can’t brag about boring to your friends and co-workers. At dinner parties, people naturally ask me about James Blunt (chocolate cake), not how to diligently save and invest their hard-earned money, keep fees to a minimum and stay the course (broccoli).\n\nThat’s not sexy. Sexy is meme stocks, crypto… and You’re Beautiful… Why wait decades to build wealth when you witnessed someone else do it seemingly overnight?\n\nOf course, it’s easy for me to sit on my high horse, when we see the likes of FTX collapse. But this is one example in many.\n\nMy portfolio is pretty dull. The majority of my net worth resides in low-cost index funds and ETFs.\n\nI won’t get rich overnight\n\nBut index funds don’t have an ego. They’re consistent, reliable and proven.\n\nThey won’t commit fraud against you, shut off withdrawals or transfer your money from one company to the next to cover losses made from stupid mistakes.\n\nYou’re never going to get caught up in a Ponzi Scheme investing in a total stock market index fund.\n\nA high savings rate combined with a bunch of boring, low-cost, tax-efficient investments, helps me (and our clients) sleep at night.\n\nOf course, the stock market is obviously not immune to large losses. But one of my biggest takeaways after nearly 20 years of working in the boring side of financial services, is survival is an underrated quality for success.\n\nI’ve seen many portfolio managers, funds, fad investments and strategies blow up. And many financial plans decimated. Too many.\n\nThere’s something to be said for diligently following a strategy that is durable enough to survive many different kinds of market environments.\n\nIf I ever find myself comparing my life to James Blunt’s, I like to remind myself the boring stuff always comes back in style. When the boring stuff doesn’t work it usually means underperformance. When the exciting stuff doesn’t work, you can lose all of your money.\n\nSAM INSTONE is CEO at AES International, an evidence-based financial planning firm with headquarters in Dubai.\n\nPREVIOUSLY ON TEBI\n\nIs giving investors voting powers on ESG a cop-out?\n\nWhy indexing works and continues to grow\n\nFinancial context is everything\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED INVESTING EXPLAINED\n\nDo you want to learn more about the evidence-based investment strategies that advisers like Sam Instone recommend? This is the book you need.\n\nRobin Powell and Jonathan Hollow have been friends since childhood and share a passion for helping people understand the world of money, savings, pensions and investments.\n\nNow they’ve collaborated on a book called How to Fund the Life You Want, which explains in plain English what you need to know to pay for the life you want to lead. It’s published by Bloomsbury and is primarily written for a UK audience.\n\nIt’s available to buy on Amazon, on Bookshop.org, and in all good bookshops. There’s an eBook and an audio book version as well."
