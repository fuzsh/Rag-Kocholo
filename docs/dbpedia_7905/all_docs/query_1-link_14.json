        "text": "Post by allow that on\n\nThis album is due out on September 20, though I hope it gets pushed back a little to allow his first single more time to kick in (which hasn't gone for adds yet but is getting a lot of airplay in NYC already).\n\nJames is the biggest success story in the UK of the year.\n\nHe used to be a soldier in Kosovo, and he plays over a dozen instruments on his album.\n\nThe album has been at #1 for a month now in the UK, propelled by its third single \"You're Beautiful\" which is also currently at #1 in the UK. \"YB\" is almost definitely the first US single.\n\nYou guys should really check him out!\n\nBack To Bedlam Tracklisting:\n\nHigh\n\nYou're Beautiful\n\nWisemen\n\nGoodbye My Lover\n\nTears and Rain\n\nOut Of My Mind\n\nSo Long, Jimmy\n\nBilly\n\nCry\n\nNo Bravery (a Linda Perry production)\n\nPost by allow that on\n\nLOL, this article is hilarious:\n\nTo be quite Blunt, Harry, all the girls seem to be after James; ALL EYES ARE ON THE PRINCE OF POP AS REAL ROYALTY TAKES A BACK SEAT.\n\nThe Evening Standard (London, England); 7/25/2005\n\nByline: ALISTAIR FOSTER\n\nFOR ONCE all eyes were not on Prince Harry - they were on the latest chart sensation, James Blunt.\n\nThe former soldier, top of both the singles and albums charts, was attracting the female attention at a party last night.\n\nBy contrast, Harry was unusually coy as he sat in a corner with friends - and not a female admirer in sight.\n\nBlunt and Harry were among the famous faces at the Cartier International Polo event, one of the most glamorous dates on the party calendar.\n\nThe 20-year-old prince has become a regular fixture at the event and in past years has been seen drinking and dancing until dawn surrounded by young women.\n\nBut it was Blunt's turn to be the centre of attention as Harry turned in early because he had to get back to his Sandhurst barracks by midnight.\n\nBlunt, 28, arrived with a blonde woman by his side, and was later spotted with actress Martine McCutcheon on his arm. The singer, who was a captain in the Army and served in Kosovo, revealed his plans to crack America.\n\nHe hopes his chart-topping single You're Beautiful and his triple platinum album Back To Bedlam will win him millions of new fans in the US.\n\nHe said: \"I'm absolutely over the moon about my chart positions. Now I'm going to give America my very best shot.\"\n\nHarry seems to have regained his appetite after being kept at Sandhurst's medical centre overnight last week following complaints of a sore throat and general tiredness.\n\nAfter leading the official Prince of Wales team to victory by eight goals to four in the coveted Golden Jubilee Trophy, he ate some burgers from the Cartier tent before heading off to the Chinawhite tent with his friends.\n\nBlunt and the prince drank champagne in the Cartier VIP tent and were joined by Lord Of The Rings stars Orlando Bloom and Cate Blanchett, actress Sienna Miller and model Caprice - who admitted being in the dark over polo.\n\n\"I'm having a great time but actually I don't know anything about polo,\" she said. \"I really came here to look for some fit guys.\"\n\nPost by allow that on\n\nHere's an interview James did in June. It gives a really good idea of what he's all about. He talks about how he learned to play violin, piano, acoustic and electric guitar all before he was 10. He talks about recording his album in Los Angeles. He talks about this time spent in the army in Kosovo. He comes across as very humble, you can tell he's feeling like a fish out of water still by his surprise superstar status overnight.\n\nYou can get the interview here:\n\nwww.toazted.com/artistinfo.php?artist=646\n\nAlso, The Game is apparently a James Blunt fan! :)\n\nwww.mtv.co.uk/mtv.co.uk/news/article.jhtml?articleId=30123821\n\nPost by allow that on\n\nkikimets said:\n\nJames is on the cover of Billboard this week, with a 2-page spread (article plus large photo) in the magazine. I'd scan it, but the magazine is just too big to scan a full page with my scanner.\n\nI saw he was on the cover! That's so awesome! That's unbelievable exposure for him. Is the article any good? I'm very curious in reading his label's plans for marketing him. They can make or break him. I guess if they got him on the cover of Billboard though, they're doing something right. I'll have to look for the magazine but it's been kind of hard to find lately."
