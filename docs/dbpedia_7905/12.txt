James Blunt, an English singer-songwriter and musician, started his career as a commissioned officer in the British Army. He rose to the rank of an army captain and saw action in the strife-torn Kosovo region. After six years of service, he decided to resign from the army to focus on his musical career. He changed his name from James Hillier Blount to James Blunt. He signed with EMI, before securing a recording contract with ‘Atlantic Records’ and ‘Custard Records’. His debut studio album, ‘Back to Bedlam’, initially attracted little critical attention and his live performances received somewhat mixed reviews, where his lack of performing experience became apparent. However, soon his debut album garnered popularity with the masses and the single ‘You're Beautiful’ from the album propelled him to stardom. Another single ‘Goodbye My Lover’ from the same album became immensely popular and Blunt started being recognized for his musical talents. The album sold several million copies worldwide and featured on the UK Albums Chart and also earned great success in the US. His second album, ‘All the Lost Souls’, topped the charts in over 20 countries. His other albums, ‘Some Kind of Trouble’ and ‘Moon Landing’, also did exceedingly well on the charts. The singer has won many accolades, especially for his debut album, and continues to perform in live shows and concerts.
