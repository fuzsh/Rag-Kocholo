Welcome to City Life Church Southampton

City Life Church is part of Godâ€™s family in Southampton, sharing everyday life around Jesus.

We are committed to creating a home together where God can be known and celebrated, and where everyone is welcome. We make our church home, not in one building but in many places and spaces across the city where we live out our everyday lives. Why not take a look in the rooms of our home and discover all the ways we live church life together.
