At City Life Church we strive to create an environment where your whole family can experience God together. You will hear a few words that are full of action - LIVE, LEARN, LOVE, LEAD.

Making a decision to LIVE for God is the best commitment you can make. That's joining us on campus for our services, praying at home with your family & connecting with our community. It's ok if you don't get it all right away, as long as you make a choice to LEARN as you go. We want to follow God's teaching and be good students. Always remember, you are unique. We want you to LOVE how God as created you, and use the gifts He gave you, to advance His Mission here on earth.

As we LIVE, LEARN & LOVE, we can now LEAD others the same way

we have been lead. Join us on in this experience to

Live for God, Learn His Ways, Love our Design and Lead the way.
