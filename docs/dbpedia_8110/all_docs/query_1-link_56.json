        "text": "Garden City\n\nSilicon Valley is both an amazing and challenging place to live and work. Garden City exists to be a growing counterculture to the pressure, loneliness, and consumerism of this place. We invite you to join us. You will find good news to enjoy, a community to belong to, and a mission—a deep sense of purpose—to live.\n\nWe named our church Garden City because the human story started in a garden (Gen.1) and adventures towards a garden city (Rev.22), plus we’re placed in a strategic region that the first settlers called “The Garden City” because everything they planted flourished in our valley’s fertile soil and temperate climate. We’re here to advance this story of flourishing, to impact a place that’s impacting the world.\n\nWe don’t don’t do this by “going to church” on Sundays, but by being the church every day of the week. All week we “Go & Make”—together we walk with Jesus, make disciples, and do work that makes an impact. You can play an important role in our church and in our city, and we’re excited to meet you!"
