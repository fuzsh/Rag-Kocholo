        "text": "Believe it or not the genesis of City Life Church began in Kansas. Our lead pastor, with a group of awesome people, helped plant City Life Church in Wichita. In four years City Life Wichita grew exponentially. In Winter of 2014 God began to call Dale back to his hometown of San Diego for another work. God rallied 12 dedicated people to move the 1600 miles to see the dream become a reality.\n\nJune 14, 2015 with a small group of friends gathered in a home, without much fanfare, City Life San Diego was born. They quickly moved to the backyard to make space but that didn't last.\n\nMay 14, 2016, City Life grew out of the back yard in Southcrest and began to meet in the Gallery in the North Park/University Heights area. It was a bit like having church inside a large closet, but it was still fun.\n\nApril 2, 2017, City Life once again moved to Chollas-Mead elementary school because of steady growth and a desire to be closer to the inner city and a central location, minutes from all of San Diego.\n\nCOVID-19 (The year that seemed to last forever)-\n\nMarch 2020-June 2020, In an instant the world changed and suddenly loving your neighbor meant not exposing them to a deadly virus.\n\nWorship services moved back to the Huntington home for a season.\n\nThe church organized to serve the families in the community in need.\n\nMembers made masks and handed out 4,000 to help those who didn’t have them. Food, baby wipes and toilet paper were handed out to those in need. Almost 500 wagons of food were distributed to meet immediate needs. Easter baskets were safely distributed. Prayer, worship, kids bible studies, book studies, adult city groups, growth groups and even our worship services were moved online. But the church never stopped being the church!\n\nJuly 2020-August 2022—Adapting to the desire for people to safely see each other during a pandemic, City Life moved our worship gatherings to Gompers park. Armed with masks people brought their own chairs and blankets, while worshiping from a safe distance from one another. Baptisms continued, just with masks. Service continued. The food pantry expanded and the Church moved forward and ultimately reverted back to Sunday’s only as emergency need dwindled. Eventually we moved back to Chollas Mead Elementary in August of 2021.\n\nOctober 21 2022—\n\nCity Life purchased our new building at 616 Raven Street in Mount Hope.\n\nWe hope this will be a place for worship and a resource center for those in need."
