How do we know which truths will actually lead to a meaningful life? Let’s find out in our new series.\n\nLife.Church is one church meeting in multiple locations, and we want to help you become the person God made you to be. No matter where you are in your journey, you’re invited to discover your purpose and live it out at Life.Church.\n\nGod is our source of strength and gives us joy in any season of life. This song is an intentional declaration that no matter what life throws at us, we can choose to praise Him.\n\nAt Life.Church, we’re all about the “capital C” Church. When churches work together, we truly can reach the world for Christ. If you’re in ministry, we want to equip you. Access the entire library of Life.Church sermons, graphics, kids lessons, resources, and apps for free."
