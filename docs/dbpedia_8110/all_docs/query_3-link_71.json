We believe God called us to love Him with our hearts, souls, minds, and strength, and that being fully devoted followers of Jesus should be the norm, not the exception. Gathering on Sunday's is a glorious blessing, but we want the heartbeat of our church to exist beyond our building and among God's people. So, if you are curious about what being a Christ-follower means, we'd love to have you join us! Or if you are looking for a place to be in community & fully devoted to Jesus, then we would love to have you join us!\n\nCitylight Lincoln Church exists to magnify Jesus through multiplying disciples and churches. We believe in the truth and love of the Gospel and want to open our doors for all people to come to learn about Jesus, engage in christ-centered community, and worship the Lord!\n\nCitylight Lincoln Church exists to magnify Jesus through multiplying disciples and churches. We believe in the truth and love of the Gospel and want to open our doors for all people to come to learn about Jesus, engage in christ-centered community, and worship the Lord!"
