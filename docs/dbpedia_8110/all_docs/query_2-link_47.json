        "text": "Our North entrance (closest to Murfreesboro Road) is most convenient for those who have preschoolers only or both preschool and elementary age children.\n\nOur South lot (easily accessible from South Royal Oaks Blvd) provides the most parking and fastest access to multiple building entrances. This area is most convenient for all attendees without small children.\n\nKidCity exists to partner with parents in the discipleship of their children by providing experiences and resources which equip the family to live in the way of Jesus. We believe parents are the primary disciplers of their children, and we want to partner with you as you lead them. We desire to help your kids grow in wisdom, faith, and friendship, always pointing them to Jesus!\n\nDuring Sunday services, KidCity is available for ages 6 weeks to 5th grade. Each environment is designed with the age of the child in mind – from small classrooms for our preschoolers ensuring an engaging time to play and learn, to the Theater for our elementary ages complete with space for small group discussion and large group games, bible teaching, and worship.\n\nLearn more about KidCity and our programming or contact our team by visiting our page here.\n\nWednesday evenings are when the students take over our building! From 6th grade to 12th grade, we have programming set up for middle school and high school. During our time together, students are able to hang out and meet other students from the area, have large group time – where we join together in worship and teaching, and we also have intentional small group time.\n\nTo learn more about our City Students ministry, click here.\n\nArrival Time: If it is your first time arriving to our church, we suggest aiming to arrive about 15-20 minutes early. This will allow you time to park, grab some coffee, and find your seat.\n\nService Length: We aim to have each of our services approximately 75 minutes long.\n\nQuestions? You may reach out to us during the week at our 615-465-5000. On Sundays, visit our Information desks located in the middle of the lobby! Our team would love to assist you."
