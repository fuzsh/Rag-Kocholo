We gather as a church for Serve My City events and Partner with local nonprofits and public services to provide consistent support throughout the year.\n\nJesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”\n\nMatthew 22:37-40"
