        "text": "City Life Church East Bay is lead by campus pastors Jony and Maria Volk under the leadership of our central lead pastors Jonathan and Elana Wilkins.\n\nPastors Jony and Maria Volk, natives of the Bay Area, are deeply devoted to their faith, community, and the individual growth of those around them. Their pastoral mission is marked by a dedication to see people become fully alive in Jesus, fostering an environment of support and empowerment. In addition to their pastoral duties, Jony and Maria have both been entrepreneurs for more than 16 years, bringing a unique blend of practical wisdom to their ministry. They place a strong emphasis on family, nurturing children to grow in faith and moral understanding. Through their multifaceted roles, the Volks have combined their love for Jesus Christ and their entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nPastors Jonathan and Elana have served as pastors in the Bay Area for more than 2 decades. Pastor Jonathan is an anointed prophetic voice to this generation. He & Elana are committed to building the local church and have had the privilege of ministering throughout the U.S. and in many countries around the world. They have 4 beautiful children: Erika, Julianna, Jaden & Ethan.\n\nMeet the City Life Pastoral Team\n\nThe East Bay Campus services will be roughly 1 hour 15 minutes. Typically services begin with 20-30 minutes of worship, followed by a message from a pastor. All weekend services include kids classes. These are fun, safe, age-appropriate ways for kids to learn about Jesus and the Bible.\n\nPreaching\n\nWe preach Jesus. This means we teach from the Bible and believe God will speak to you and encourage you. The sermon typically lasts 35-40 minutes.\n\nWorship:\n\nYou may be surprised to hear music that is louder and better than you expcted for “church music”. We have an amazing community of musicians and singers who give their best ever weekend to worship God.\n\nYou can see a previous sermon and worship on our youtube channel @CityLifeSF"
