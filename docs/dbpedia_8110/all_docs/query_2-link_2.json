Located in the heart of downtown Jersey City, we are just one block away from the Grove Street Path Station.\n\nService begins at 10:00 AM and we invite all to come to worship Jesus and explore faith in Him.\n\nCome worship with us as we pursue our mission to Find Home, Encounter Jesus and Pursue Gospel Change Together.\n\nIf meeting in person is not an option, you can watch our Sunday sermon by using the link below. We remain committed to reach the whole of our community as we make this online space available to worship God. Sermons usually post on the Monday following the service."
