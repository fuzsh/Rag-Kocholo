        "text": "1. How do I sign up for Online Giving?\n\nTo give on-line click the Nucleus giving button or link. You will be guided through your online giving account set-up and you will be prompted to select your payment method (bank debit or credit card) and contribution information. It's that easy!\n\n3. What are the advantages of Online Giving?\n\nSecurity and convenience make online transactions an increasingly popular means of donating to an organization. Plus, CityLife enjoys administrative savings (manual check processing and record keeping add up in a hurry). You also can take advantage of the discipline that recurring donations can provide for your giving – it makes it easy to fulfill stewardship commitments, even when you can't attend church. You never have to bring cash or checks to church.\n\n4. How are my contributions automatically deducted from my account?\n\nOnce you set up your online giving account through our church website, the contribution amount you specify will automatically be transferred from your bank account (or credit card account) to the church's bank account.\n\n5. When will my contribution be deducted from my account?\n\nYour first contribution will be debited immediately when you set up your account. Recurring debits will re-occur on the frequency chosen from the first debit. For example, if you set up your account and make a contribution on September 12th, and if you choose monthly contributions as your frequency, the next debit will occur on October 12th.\n\n6. Can I give as little or as much as I want?\n\nDonations must be in whole dollar amounts (i.e. no cents). For example, if you type in $25.09 as your contribution, the contribution amount will read as $2,509. There is a minimum of $1 and there are no limitations on the maximum amount.\n\n8. Is online giving secure?\n\nYes. Online giving is less risky than writing checks or bringing cash to church. Electronic contributions cannot be lost, stolen or destroyed. All information is encrypted with 256 bit SSL encryption. SSL is an acronym for \"Secure Socket Layer\", a security protocol that provides communications privacy over the internet. It is the same technology used by banks and e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com to keep your information safe and secure during transactions.\n\n9. What are the fees involved with online giving?\n\nYou will be charged a fee of 2.9% of the contribution amount + .30 cents per transaction for debit and credit cards, and + .25 cents for ACH bank account transactions (e-checks). These are the most competitive rates we found as we evaluated several different ways to give. Your giving statement will show the full value of your contribution.\n\n10. Can I schedule recurring donations?\n\nYes, you can specify whether you want your contribution made one-time, weekly, every two weeks (bi-weekly), twice per month (bi-monthly), and monthly. You can set up as many schedules as you would like, so it is possible to give a monthly gift as well as a weekly one.\n\n11. Can I contribute to the Deacon’s Fund through online giving?\n\nYes! The default option is the General Fund, so you will need to select the Deacon’s Fund from the Fund field. When you schedule your contribution, click the down arrow on the Fund field and the Deacon’s Fund will appear as an option.\n\n12. How do text contributions work?\n\nUsing your text enabled phone, simply text the amount you'd like to give to TBD. First time givers will be prompted to provide their payment method via a secure web page.\n\n13. Will I still receive paper contribution statements in the mail or via e-mail?\n\nYou will receive a year-end statement in the mail with your year-to-date giving information to use for income tax purposes. Starting January 1, 2018, we implemented a church management software system (Breeze) that interfaces with online giving and you will have the ability to look up the status of your contributions at any point throughout the year."
