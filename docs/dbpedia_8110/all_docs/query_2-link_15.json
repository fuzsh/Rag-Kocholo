        "text": "10 years ago God called us to plant a life-giving church in the heart of San Francisco. With very little resources, a small church planting team, and a whole lot of faith based on a clear word from God, we started City Life Church. God miraculously joined us with Pastor Marquez, a native of San Francisco with a heart for the city. Our churches joined as one to dream about seeing San Francisco and the SF Bay Area reached for Christ. From our location on 6th street to our current SF campus on Bayshore Blvd., over and over again we have seen the miraculous provision and favor of God on our efforts to BE ABOUT IT. Our commitment has never been to church buildings, but to simply BE ABOUT the mission of Jesus by loving, reaching, and serving people in our city and communities. We now stand at another miraculous opportunity to put down roots in SF by funding the purchase of our Bayshore campus, and to launch our East Bay Campus. Wherever we go, we are committed to BE ABOUT IT. Will you join us on this exciting life-giving journey?\n\nOver the next two years, we are going to ask God for MORE as we expand and multiply our disciple-making efforts in SF and in the East Bay. We believe this vision to BE ABOUT IT be greatly accelerated through the launch of our two-year vision initiative that includes three key focuses…\n\nFrom the East Bay to SF and now back to the EB, God has provided a beautiful campus for City Life to BE ABOUT IT in the East Bay. This portion of our campaign will help fund the lease and first year launch costs needed to successfully establish our new campus in the East Bay!\n\nOur goal is for every person who calls The Gathering home to engage in BE ABOUT IT, and, as they do so, to experience their own personal personal transformation as they discover and take steps to grow in their ability to be generous. Whether you’re a first-time giver, an occasional giver, a committed giver, or even an extravagant giver, God has steps He’s calling you to take in this season. If 100% of the City Life family fully engaged, we believe God will provide every resource we need to accelerate the vision and see so much more of our region transformed.\n\nDuring this initiative, we’re inviting every person in our church family to participate in a totally new, unified way of giving, called One Fund. This means ALL of our giving goes to ONE fund that will resource current ministries, missions, and savings for the next two years, while also resourcing our 3 key BE ABOUT IT priorities for our church family, our city, and region. So even if this is the first time you’ve given, you can celebrate being a part of the faith journey God is calling us all to as a church!\n\nOur goal is for every person who calls City Life Church home to engage in BE ABOUT IT, and, as they do so, to experience their own personal transformation as they discover and take steps to grow in their ability to be generous. Whether you’re a first-time giver, an occasional giver, a committed giver, or even an extravagant giver, God has steps He’s calling you to take in this season.
