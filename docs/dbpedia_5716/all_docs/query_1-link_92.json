Thanks, Kiran!\n\nTwenty One Pilots\n\nBlurryface\n\nWait…how many Pilots?\n\nThe early 2010s gave rise to a multitude of alternative-rock bands: Panic! at the Disco, Fall Out Boy, and Cage the Elephant, just to name a few. I, like most other middle/high schoolers at the time, was obsessed with these bands. Twenty One Pilots was no exception. The duo from Columbus, Ohio, exploded into the alternative-rock scene with their 2015 album, Blurryface. Their songs “Stressed Out”, “Tear in My Heart”, and “Ride” were all hits, with “Ride” making the top 5 on The US Billboard 100. The band went on to win the 2017 Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Bandmates Tyler Joseph and Joshua Dun accepted the award without their pants, as a tribute to the way they were watching the Grammys a few years prior to their breakout.\n\nIn his speech, Joseph concluded that “anyone from anywhere can do anything,” which aligns with the overarching message they convey through their music and performances. The duo often sings of mental hardships and social constructs, but have always weaved a positive narrative into their music. Their two most recent albums, Trench (2018) and Scaled and Icy (2021), have intricate story lines that show how perseverance can outstand even the toughest circumstances. Each song plays a different role and serves as a world-building tool. “Dema” is a fictional land that is guarded by several bishops, each representing an inner demon or fear. Throughout several videos, Joesph and Dun befriend the weird creatures and strange rebels in order to escape. These are just a few examples of how Twenty One Pilots uses creative techniques to express raw and difficult emotions and experiences.\n\nAlthough I didn’t understand how relatable these lyrics were at the time, my 8th grade-self fell in love with the intricate bass lines and vibrant drum solos. Since then, my fondness for this band has grown exponentially. While some have outgrown the duo, I have continued to follow their musical journey. Twenty One Pilots is currently on their third world tour and came to the DMV last month. I’ve seen three of their shows over the past six years and have yet to be disappointed. Their stage presence and interaction with the fan base is incredible and truly a unique experience.\n\nIf you’re ready to start an emotional roadshow, come check out Blurryface and other related CDs in Parsons Music Library!\n\nEditor’s note: Arachnophonia (“Arachno” = spider / “-phonia” = sound) is a regular feature on our blog where members of the UR community can share their thoughts about resources from the Parsons Music Library‘s collection.\n\nAll links included in these posts will take you to either the library catalog record for the item in question or to additional relevant information from around the web.\n\nToday’s installment of Arachnophonia is by student manager Deisy (class of 2024) and features Green Day’s 2004 album American Idiot. Thanks, Deisy!\n\nGreen Day\n\nAmerican Idiot\n\nGreen Day is a band that many are fans of and many have heard of. I remember going to my local dentist and waiting to be attended to when their infamous song “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” begins to play. Without fail, every year I would step into this dentist and the song would start playing on the radio. As time went on, I discovered the name of the song and eventually got into listening to the band and have since fallen in love with many of their songs. And I wonder, was this song such a prominent part of other people’s lives just as it was to me, or was I just exposed to it too consistently in that dentist room?\n\nThe band’s official beginnings started in 1989 as a group of teenagers in Northern California came together to create Green Day. Their most successful and biggest hit album, American Idiot, shook the world when it came out in 2004. This album contains songs like “Boulevard of Broken Dreams“, “Holiday“, and “Wake Me Up When September Ends“.\n\nWhile this music may not be to everyone’s taste, it is certainly a genre that can allow one to feel free and youthful. Green Day was known as a band that empowered the youth and was not scared to point out the faults of today’s society. They are the type of band one listens to when trying to de-stress and feel that sense of freedom many young adults crave.\n\nCurrently, the Pearsons Music Library has a copy of American Idiot and other notable albums such as 21st-Century Breakdown (2009) and Dookie, which are available for loans or to simply listen to in our study rooms. If at any moment in the semester you feel like decompressing with some pop-punk, try giving Green Day a listen!\n\nEditor’s note: Arachnophonia is a regular feature on our blog where members of the UR community can share their thoughts about resources from the Parsons Music Library‘s collection.\n\nAll links included in these posts will take you to either the library catalog record for the item in question or to additional relevant information from around the web.\n\nToday’s installment of Arachnophonia is by student worker Cole (class of 2021) and features Explosions in the Sky’s 2003 album The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place. Thanks, Cole!\n\nExplosions in the Sky\n\nThe Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place\n\nYou’re watching a film. It’s a sports movie about a chippy group of underdogs defying all odds and barreling towards impossible success. Or it’s a coming-of-age story about teenagers coping with the incredible, ineffable weight of being. Or it’s a true story of human struggle in the face of calamity–a military operation gone wrong; an oil rig exploding. What music is playing? If the film was made in the past two decades, there’s a very good chance it’s post-rock.\n\nThe term ‘post-rock’ was coined by music journalist Simon Reynolds in 1994. It is used, broadly, in reference to any music that uses rock instrumentation but doesn’t adhere to rock song convention. Post-rock songs are most often long instrumental pieces that focus on musical texture and build to all-out climaxes, a subgenre affectionately dubbed ‘crescendocore.’\n\nIn 2003, Texas-based post-rock band Explosions in the Sky released their third studio album, The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place. This album is widely regarded as their greatest work, and is considered one of the essential works of the genre. Explosions’ brand of post-rock — layers of reverb and delay-laden guitars punctuated by the ever-marching cadence of a snare drum — came to define the genre in the early 21st century, due in no small part to the 2004 film Friday Night Lights.\n\nAfter Explosions released The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place, they were approached by Brian Reitzell, a Hollywood composer, producer, and film music supervisor, about soundtracking the upcoming big-budget sports film Friday Night Lights. At this point, having a relatively unknown post-rock outfit soundtrack a major Hollywood release, let alone a sports movie, was unheard of. Rocky III’s “Eye of the Tiger“, this was not.\n\nAfter Reitzell demoed the group’s music to studio executives, permission was granted to bring the band on board. Musically, the soundtrack to Friday Night Lights retains much of the aesthetic of The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place. The band even adapted the song “Your Hand in Mine” from the album for the film.\n\nFriday Night Lights went on to be both a critical and commercial success, though its greatest influence on the film industry was arguably its Explosions-crafted soundtrack. The film ushered post-rock into the mainstream, and the band’s music quickly found use as ‘temp-music’ — music used by directors when editing their films to give an idea to their composer of how they want a piece to sound (for an in-depth account of what temp music is and how it affects a film’s production, check out this video from Every Frame a Painting). James Rettig of Stereogum even went as far as to call the band’s signature sound to “a cheat code for music supervisors seeking to convey emotional turmoil and the triumph of the human spirit.”\n\nIf the Friday Night Lights soundtrack is the sound that launched a thousand imitators, The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place is the band’s full-length expression of that sound, uncompromised by the necessities of scoring a film. Though their music has inescapable cinematographic connotation, Explosions in the Sky’s albums remain an intensely intimate listening experience. The lack of lyrics in fact enhances the music’s narrative potential: It invites you to construct a mental movie theater for one. You sit down in your seat and gaze up at the silver screen as your own memories are projected in front of you. Scenes from your life play out like a film, a melodramatic filter laid over it all. You conjure some memories that aren’t your own — games never played, starry night skies above fields never lain in, chances never taken — but the feelings are yours. When you open this album, you are greeted by the explanation to its title: “The Earth is not a cold dead place because you are breathing, because you are listening.”\n\nEditor’s note: Arachnophonia is a regular feature on our blog where members of the UR community can share their thoughts about resources from the Parsons Music Library‘s collection.\n\nAll links included in these posts will take you to either the library catalog record for the item in question or to additional relevant information from around the web.\n\nToday’s installment of Arachnophonia is by student worker Elias (class of 2021) and features the Red Hot Chili Peppers‘ 2006 double album, Stadium Arcadium . Thanks, Elias!\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nStadium Arcadium\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers are the most successful alternative rock group of all time. Typically, you’d expect a band to reduce themselves to the lowest common denominator to find success en masse, but the Peppers managed to climb to the top while staying as perfectly weird and beautifully musical as ever. The key behind their success, of course, lies with the band members — and though their lineup has changed a handful of times over the years, there’s no doubt about the definitive Chili Peppers crew. Anthony Kiedis and Flea have been there since the beginning as the lifeblood of the group. Kiedis acts as both the face and voice of the group, and though neither his singing nor his lyricism has ever left me in awe, he remains consistent and passionate in every performance he gives. Flea, of course, is one of the best bassists of all time, and is allowed by the band to shine more so than in almost any other group. Chad Smith, as the definitive drummer, acts as the backbone of the group—and famously resembles Will Ferrell.\n\nAnd then, as the final member of the definitive loadout, there’s John Frusciante. Over the years, Frusciante came and left the group due to bouts with drug addiction and mental illness, eventually parting with the band for good in 2009. To an onlooker, he looks just like any other skilled guitarist, but to the Chili Peppers, he was the brains. His talents as a songwriter were unparalleled in the group, and he excelled at writing songs that succeeded in three parts: they allowed everyone in the group to shine, they appealed to a massive audience, and they sounded uniquely phenomenal. While he wrote many incredible songs during his tenure with the band, there is no better example than his final album with the Peppers: Stadium Arcadium.\n\nIn many ways, Stadium Arcadium is the group’s magnum opus. It’s their longest record, with an astonishing 28 tracks and over 2 hours of run time — but has enough raw content to keep you hooked throughout. It was their first album to debut at number one, marking the group officially as the behemoth they had become. And finally, it brought the band back in touch with their funk roots, combining with their newfound mastery of rock to create, in my opinion, their best work. Across the record, the band stays strong but varied. We ease into things with a song that would top the rock charts for weeks and pick up 2 Grammys along the way: “Dani California.” It’s a very on-brand song for the group—a nice, groovy start with Flea and Frusciante battling for the melody, Smith keeping things moving with a punchy beat, and Kiedis practically rapping over the other members. Finally, Kiedis breaks into song, moving into a grungy, distorted chorus. The appeal of RHCP can be seen perfectly here. You only need to hear the chorus once, and you’ll happily be singing along—the words are simple, yet carry a certain amount of emotion and edginess. For teen America, it was a perfect recipe for success. Finally, late in the song, you hear the first of many Frusciante solos — an aspect unique to Stadium Arcadium. Of course, he performed solos in other songs, but the solos on Stadium Arcadium were completely improvised. He doesn’t sacrifice an ounce of quality, but this fact brings another raw layer of authenticity to the album.\n\nThey don’t pull any punches with the second track, either. “Snow (Hey Oh)” was the first RHCP song I heard, and is likely the most iconic in my mind to this day. It’s light, intricate, sonically beautiful, and an absolute pain to play on guitar. The rest of the 1st disk (named Jupiter —something Spotify won’t tell you) flows back and forth from funk to finesse, before finally landing on “Wet Sand” and “Hey,” two songs that pull back from the fun, upbeat pace and end things on a somber note. “Wet Sand” dives into the difficulty of loving the dark side of a person jointly with the good, ending finally with a repetitive bridge that provides an analogy to being unable to rely on your loved ones during times of struggle, having to, instead, find strength within. “Hey” is almost the continuation of “Wet Sand,” as it talks of the difficulty—but necessity—of breakups. This eloquent end to an otherwise happy disk serves as a cliffhanger, leaving you ready to jump into the second side — Mars.\n\nThe album immediately continues in a somber fashion, with the classic Frusciante anthem “Desecration Smile.” One of my favorite techniques that Frusciante employs (as a guitarist myself) is at the forefront in this song, just as with my favorite Chili Peppers song: “I Could Have Lied” (sadly, not on this album). He combines the acoustic verse with an electric chorus, bringing the song to a crescendo when it most needs it, then calmly returning to a low key verse that juxtaposes the chorus without skipping a beat. The rest of the “Mars” side continues in a similar fashion as “Jupiter,” crescendoing into a funky midsection, but with a much more laid back and melodic aesthetic. It’s almost as if the band wants you to sing and dance your heart out on Jupiter, then collapse and just enjoy the more articulate words and melodies of Mars.\n\nMars ends beautifully with their first homage to the space theme (though not represented lyrically), “Death of a Martian.” Martian was Flea’s dog, one that the group became infatuated with during practices at Flea’s house. The meaning of the song was a happy surprise to Flea, who remarks on it during the CD commentary. Finally, Kiedis ends with a chanting spoken word—apparently a poem he took a particular liking to. As a message, the final track delivers little, but it’s a perfectly “RHCP” song: one that celebrates both their goofiness and empathy. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a goofy rock band. But, as perfectly demonstrated on Stadium Arcadium, they are extremely competent at both music and songwriting. They can break out into a distorted, rocky fanfare, and they can wallow in funky baselines, but they have a complex past, but individually and united. On Stadium Arcadium, they pay tribute to both sides. For a farewell album, Frusciante couldn’t have picked better—and the heart he put into the record is at a perfect forefront. It marks the end of an era, but it does so with finesse.\n\nEditor’s note: Arachnophonia is a regular feature on our blog where members of the UR community can share their thoughts about resources from the Parsons Music Library‘s collection.\n\nAll links included in these posts will take you to either the library catalog record for the item in question or to additional relevant information from around the web.\n\nToday’s installment of Arachnophonia is by student worker Colin (class of 2021) and features Wanted On Voyage, the 2014 debut studio album by British singer-songwriter George Ezra. Thanks, Colin!\n\nGeorge Ezra\n\nWanted On Voyage\n\nI’m fascinated by the vocal talent of musicians and for some reason, I discover a lot of artists that I enjoy through listening to covers of their songs by a cappella groups on YouTube. I had no idea who George Ezra was until I listened to the Trinitones perform a mash-up of “Barcelona,” “Budapest” and “Paradise” over a year ago. The all-male group surprised me with their impressive talent, but also with the arrangement of the songs. I was familiar with the song “Budapest” because it had been playing on radio stations at the time, but the artist behind the song had escaped my familiarity. After listening to Wanted on Voyage however, George Ezra has become a frequent artist on my Spotify playlists.\n\nWanted on Voyage is Ezra’s debut album released in the UK in 2014. He had first been discovered by Columbia Records in 2012 from his videos on YouTube performing his own original songs. After being contracted to work for Columbia Records, Ezra found inspiration for his album in 2013 when he traveled by train across Europe, writing about the places he visited and the people he met. From this collection of memories, Ezra sat down and penned the songs for the album, immortalizing his journey.\n\nThe album gained many positive reviews on release, attributing the success to the relatively simple composition of the songs that are dramatically enhanced by Ezra’s ability to sing. A vital characteristic to Ezra’s music is his voice, which is naturally lower than many popular artists. The pitch of his voice adds flavor to his songs that make it appear as if these songs only fit the register that Ezra is able to perform in. Some highlights of the album for me are “Budapest” and “Barcelona,” which is not a surprise considering these are the songs that led me to George Ezra’s music. The mix between Ezra’s incredible voice and the instrumentation and production on both tracks really drives home the idea of why I enjoy his music so much. Another track I enjoy is “Did You Hear The Rain?” which was released as the first single from the album.\n\nWanted on Voyage is a fantastic album that does not try to create complicated music. The purity of the instrumentation and vocals shine through on every track. George Ezra actually filmed a Mahogany Session video for “Budapest,” which is a video series that allows artists to acoustically perform some of their most famous songs for the world to gain a more intimate view of the artist. This particular video is great, because I honestly cannot tell the difference in the quality of Ezra’s singing between the video and the recorded song from the album. Wanted on Voyage truly shines as Ezra’s first step into the musical world and it manifested a popularity around him that still holds true to this day."
