        "text": "Hard To Imagine The Neighbourhood ever changing\n\nFollowing the huge success of their single 'Sweater Weather' back in 2013 (which hit no.1 on the Alternative Rock charts) The Neighbourhood became the band to watch, and as each album, single and EP were released, their fan base grew. With four albums, and a collection of EP's under their belt, The Neighbourhood return to the road and bring their rocking sound with them!\n\nComprised of Zach, Jeremy, Brandon, Jesse and Mikey, The Neighbourhood first formed in 2011. Starting out, the five piece used the American spelling of neighborhood but were advised to change their spelling by their manager in order to distinguish themselves from another band of the same name."
