        "text": "This paper considers the impact of interdisciplinarity upon sociological research, focusing on one particular case: the academic study of popular music. ‘Popular music studies’ is an area of research characterized by interdisciplinarity and, in keeping with broader intellectual trends, this approach is assumed to offer significant advantages. As such, popular music studies is broadly typical of contemporary intellectual and governmental attitudes regarding the best way to research specific topics. Such interdisciplinarity, however, has potential costs and this paper highlights one of the most significant: an over-emphasis upon shared substantive interests and subsequent undervaluation of shared epistemological understandings. The end result is a form of ‘ghettoization’ within sociology itself, with residents of any particular ghetto displaying little awareness of developments in neighbouring ghettos. Reporting from one such ghetto, this paper considers some of the ways in which the sociology of popular music has been limited by its positioning within an interdisciplinary environment and suggests two strategies for developing a more fully-realized sociology of popular music. First, based on the assumption that a sociological understanding of popular music shares much in common with a sociological understanding of everything else, this paper calls for increased intradisciplinary research between sociologists of varying specialisms. The second strategy, however, involves a reconceptualization of the disciplinary limits of sociology, as it argues that a sociology of popular music needs to accept musical specificity as part of its remit. Such acceptance has thus far been limited not only by an interdisciplinary context but also by the long-standing sociological scepticism toward the analysis of aesthetic objects. As such, this paper offers an intervention into wider debates concerning the remit of sociological enquiry, and whether it is ever appropriate for sociological analyses of culture to consider ‘internal’ aesthetic structures. In relation to the specific case study, the paper argues that considering musical specificity is a necessary component of a sociology of popular music, and some possibilities for developing a ‘materialist sociology of music’ are outlined.\n\nIf the world of jazz in France has often been studied by French sociology (Fabiani, 1986; Roueff, 2003; Perennoud, 2006; Pequeux, 2009), this object often remained confined to the question of the legitimacy of musical forms related to value scales and practices as an objective aim that remained the domain of music called \"learned\". In deed, jazz music has long been for the proponents of critical sociology a strong heuristic power that allowed to observe the legitimacy games at work between two worlds: that of a part of the \"learned' music that the jazz would seek to imitate in its internal organization (Roueff, 2003), another one of popular music, which would be the emanation and where artists naturally seek to distinguish themselves. Pierre Bourdieu considered jazz, as well as cinema and comics, like some \"arts middle\" (Bourdieu 1965; Fabiani, 2010) in search of a social legitimacy. Sign of a now bygone era on the ethnography plan, even the pioneering work of H.S. Becker did not escape the tropism of analyzing jazz musicians with the theoretical and methodological equipment from the sociology of deviance. However, in the 70s and 80s, new looks were worn on jazz. It must first be emphasized the importance of work who approached the musical culture and certain specialized aesthetic in terms of market (Moulin, 1986), or \"world (s)\" (Becker, 1992) where actors and mediators interacting with other motivations as the legitimacy and domination. The study of jazz music has also been approaches that fall within the sociology of work (Menger, 1986), a social anthropology lying in the passeronien inheritance (Fabiani, 1986) or that of gender studies (Buscatto, 2007). Our research consists to study the dynamics of change within the jazz market in France since the early 2000s starting with the awards in the jazz world in particular seeking to inspire communication sciences. Thus, internationally, \"the price is the result of an effort and success\" (Frey, 2005) while in France, our study shows that prices devote more the intermediaries of the creation. To analyze this paradox, one may be tempted to mobilize work on the emergence of musical labels and taxonomies. Our approach extends this Conventions economy approach by asking the question of collective representations about creating jazz in France. Indeed, this niche market reveals many paradoxes where insiders / experts reflect a diversity of aims and expectations of action logics. To do this, the most of these actors part is visible at the awards and professional awards each year at various ceremonies with a role of market regulation (Victoires du Jazz, Academy Award Charles Cros, Defense Springboard, etc.). In the continuation of our work on the issue of work allocation properties as belonging to the authenticity of jazz, the issue of relations (installation, belonging to multiple genres, etc.) with other aesthetics (including « world music ») and question the evolution of form. Through a survey on the reception, distribution, production in the 2000s, recognition can be analysed as a process involving different halfway circles between the arts and markets : the peers, media and critics, market actors, publics.\n\n‘What Is Popular Music’ was the title of the Second International Conference on Popular Music Studies, held in Reggio Emilia (Italy) in 1983. IASPM (the International Association for the Study of Popular Music) already existed then, but IASPM’s Executive Committee members didn’t find it inappropriate to ask scholars from many countries to reflect about ‘what popular music really is’. Later on, it appeared that the question had found an answer: not just in the names and titles of institutions and journals, but especially in the common sense of scholars. At some point, PMS (Popular Music Studies) became a familiar acronym, indicating an interdisciplinary practice that didn’t seem to need any further explication. ‘We all know what popular music studies are’, one could hear saying. So, there came to be not only a commonsense recognition of what popular music is, but also of the dominant practices involved in its study. However, under the thin crust of such an apparently wide agreement, magmatic currents are still moving and clashing, and emerge here and there during scholarly meetings, in blogs and mailing lists, in institutional debates. This article addresses a number of issues that seem to me to be related both to that surface agreement and to those deep streams of disagreement about the identity of the popular music universe. Here are a few examples: 1. The linguistic issue: how does the expression ‘popular music’ translate into other languages? Although it is clear that many communities of scholars accepted to use the English expression anyway, how do ‘local’ terms (like música popular, musica popolare, populäre Musik, musique populaire, musique de varietés, etc.) affect the perception of this/these ‘kinds of music’? 2. The ethnocentric vs. multicultural issue: is popular music just the Anglo-American pop-rock mainstream? What is ‘world music’, then? 3. The ‘popularity’ issue: is popular music just any kind of mainstream? Does ‘unpopular popular music’ really exist? 4. The ‘modern media’ issue: is popular music just media-related music? What about nineteenth century fado, Stephen Foster’s Ethiopian songs, ‘classic’ Neapolitan song? What makes ‘media music’ popular? And is the concept of ‘media’, accepted when the expression ‘popular music’ was adopted, still valid now? 5. The socio-conceptual issue: what is ‘the people’, and what is ‘popular’? My approach to these issues will be based mainly on: 1) a cognitive/semiotic critique of musical concepts and categories; 2) a close conceptual examination of the evolution of music dissemination (and/or ‘popularity’) in the past three decades. I don’t think that it would be easy (or useful) to find a new name for the music that until thirty years ago, and in some countries much more recently, wasn’t studied in academic institutions: ‘popular music’ for me is still probably the best conventional term to indicate such a complex set of musical cultures and practices. However, I suggest that its conventional character shouldn’t be underemphasized, and that quiet assumptions about what popular music is and what popular music studies are should be treated very carefully.\n\nFacing the 'Crisis' In the original invitation to the constructively titled colloquium 'Renegotiating Musicology,' of which this article is a result, organisers suggested that participants should feel free to think as broadly as possible about their particular places in the discipline. This is an unusually fraught request with regard to the musicological study of popular music. For as several respected scholars have noted, the field of popular music studies has quite simply failed to craft a coherent and cohesive body of theories and methods for the analysis of its chosen objects of study. Further, for some, this lack of coherence constitutes a full-blown disciplinary crisis. 1 As Lawrence Grossberg has noted in a scathing essay-in which he registered his disappointment with the entire field-we have a lot of theoretical problems, but not a lot of theories to solve them. Worse, according to Grossberg, few of the explanations we do have are specific to a discipline that lacks a common analytical language. While Grossberg might rightly criticise a familiar array of trans-historical, de-contextualised, apparently universal concerns for a field he seems to suspect may not actually exist, his existential angst is ultimately misleading. The distinction 'popular music' upon which so many of his careful ruminations are based is itself a false analytic category. There is no unifying process, principle or set of common materials that anyone can point to that all versions or iterations of what we call popular music share. Significant exceptions to the standard array of definitions can always be found within music that is nevertheless broadly recognised to be firmly within the family. Too often social categories such as 'popular music' masquerade as aesthetic facts reinscribing essentialist notions of music."
