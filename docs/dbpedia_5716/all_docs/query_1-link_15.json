        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nToday, music listeners face an abundance of choices. In part, this is driven by the advent of on-demand streaming, which presents users with an extensive library of songs to choose from and the ability to effortlessly explore a vast array of musical styles and genres, both old and new. At the same time, digitization has lowered barriers to music creation [7] and distribution [13], enabling artists to release music on an unprecedented scale [29]. To help listeners navigate this vast music landscape, streaming services provide a wide array of recommender systems designed to promote discovery and personalize user experience [34].\n\nThis paper explores the broader dynamics of music discovery. However, novel music can be discovered in different forms, such as encountering an existing song unfamiliar to the user, experiencing a new rendition of a familiar track, rediscovering forgotten music, exploring less-frequented genres, or finding a newly released song [28]. In this work, we operationalize music discovery as streaming new music releases. This approach offers two key advantages. The first is theoretical; it centers on music that is new to everyone, posing a more challenging recommendation problem than music that's merely new to an individual, as we cannot rely on collaborative-filtering techniques alone to recommend new music without prior streaming data. The second is practical; it removes ambiguity when identifying the extent of the novelty of the music to a specific user in the absence of off-platform music consumption. By focusing on newly released tracks, we are confident that the users have never heard of them. Thus, by exploring how new music releases are streamed across genres and users, this paper takes us one step closer to understanding how novel music, in general, is consumed.\n\nWe posit that new music release consumption is not only influenced by individual preferences but also communal factors, involving a degree of shared social awareness about the novelty of a track (or its newness). To this end, we use music genres as a way to understand the role that communities play in new release consumption. Music genres are cultural and social constructs that define music styles and foster communities among artists and listeners [20]. Some genres, such as Pop, reflect current trends in music, whereas others, such as Blues or Rock, describe distinctive styles of music. The link between music genre and new music consumption can arise from internal individual preferences or external social influences. Internally, some genres evoke specific emotions [9], potentially influencing the user's choice of new music. Personal affinities for some genres could also be linked to personality traits [33]. For instance, a fondness for lively jazz music may mirror an energetic personality, while a preference for nostalgic classical tunes might signify a more sensitive personality [6]. Externally, the sociocultural aspect of music can shape listeners’ music choices. Cultural backgrounds, peer groups, self-identity, and societal trends can all steer individuals toward specific genres of music [18, 31]. Music researchers, drawing on social identity theory, consistently find that individuals assimilate the traits and lifestyles of their preferred music-based social group [31]. On the societal level, localized trendiness of new music can also predict whether they will be adopted by other users in the area [18]. Moreover, the media's portrayal of music can impact the consumption and perception of music [31, 35]. Thus, we speculate that genres similarly influence how people adopt new music releases.\n\nTo understand the consumption of new music releases, we leverage a large streaming data of 282K new music releases and music consumption patterns of 1 million users on Spotify. We organize this research around three broad questions:\n\nRQ1: How does new music release consumption vary across different genre communities?\n\nRQ2: To what extent do users’ new release genre preferences align with their prior music genre preferences?\n\nRQ3: Can prior music genre preferences predict users’ new release streaming?\n\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows. First, we present insights into how new music streaming varies across genres (RQ1). New releases from genres serving functional purposes (e.g., Classical music for relaxation [15]) are the least consumed. Surprisingly, new releases in Pop consistently emerge as not highly consumed. Second, we emphasize the distinctiveness between users’ new release preferences and overall music tastes across genres, hinting that recommendation algorithms should consider new release recommendation as a separate task from overall music recommendation (RQ2). Lastly, we find that users’ penchant for a particular genre and their consistent appetite for the latest music reliably predict their new release consumption (RQ3). Our findings contribute practically by offering guidelines to improve new release recommender systems. Moreover, they advance our understanding of novel music consumption patterns. For creators, this understanding can potentially facilitate better alignment with their audiences on streaming platforms and foster the growth of online sociocultural communities centered around music genres. For users, the insights from this work hold the potential to enhance music discovery and exploration. Ultimately, this work doesn't just inform algorithms; it addresses how communities interact with music, facilitating a diverse and socially engaging musical environment online.\n\n4 NEW RELEASES ACROSS MUSIC GENRES\n\nIn this section, we answer RQ1: How does new music release consumption vary across different genre communities? We compare and analyze the streaming volume of new releases across the 18 genres from multiple angles, presented below.\n\n4.1 New vs. Existing Music Consumption\n\nWe compare streaming rates between existing music and new releases categorized by genre. In the absence of better approaches distinguishing familiar from novel music, streaming novel music can signal a preference for novel music. Through a comparative examination of consumption rates between existing and new music across various genres, we can deduce which genres garner higher novel content consumption. In addition, this method rectifies potential biases that may be obscured by genre popularity and availability, potentially leading to inflated new release consumption rates. For instance, Pop may have a higher volume of new releases streamed than Alternative, but this disparity might not hold when considering the total number of existing Pop tracks that are streamed. To this end, we compare the streaming of new releases within a genre to that of other pre-existing tracks in the same genre. Our data encompasses streaming activities from April 1 to June 9, 2023. If the stream of a track occurred within 28 days of the track's release, then it is considered a new release stream; otherwise, it is an existing music stream.\n\nFig. 1(a) presents the proportion of the overall streaming activity within a genre attributed to new releases. While new releases contribute modestly to the entire streaming spectrum in each genre (consistent with current trends [22]), the Rap genre stands out, with new releases accounting for nearly 6% of total Rap streams. This is followed by Dance & House and Latin new releases, contributing around 4% of streaming within their respective genres. This trend is corroborated by analyzing the ratio of the average stream count per track for new releases to that of existing music (only tracks that were streamed at least once are counted here), as depicted in Fig. 1(b). We observe Latin, Country & Folk, and Rap new releases experiencing high consumption rates relative to existing music. Notably, Latin new releases are streamed 6 times as much as existing Latin music.\n\nConversely, a few genres demonstrate comparably lower new release consumption than existing music consumption. Children's new music represents less than 1% of total Children's music consumption, and Classical, Rock, and New Age new releases contribute to less than 1.5% of their total genre stream. These genres similarly rank lower in terms of their streaming activity per track. A discernible pattern emerges within these genres, as they tend to serve functional purposes (e.g., Classical music [40]), were popularized in older eras (e.g., Rock music), or both.\n\n4.2 Widespread Repeated Consumption\n\nPreviously, we compared a genre's new releases’ consumption rate with that of its existing songs. Now, we shift to a horizontal comparison of new release consumption rates across genres. We consider both the number of listeners and the total stream count. A track high in both the number of listeners and total stream count would indicate widespread repeated consumption, suggesting that the users truly “love\" the song [19]. We draw inspiration from the h-index, a metric that assesses the research output of scientists [12]: an individual's H-index is the maximum h such that h of their papers are cited at least h times. Similarly, we define a music track's h-index as the maximum h such that h unique listeners have listened to the track h times. As such, a high H-index would indicate that a substantial number of listeners repeatedly streamed the track. We can then compare genres by examining the number of tracks with high h-indices. Since some genres have fewer listeners and/or fewer tracks, we compare the proportion of songs in a genre with a particular h-index.\n\nFig. 2 summarizes the cumulative proportion of the 282K new releases at each H-index up to 32. We cap it at 32 here because the H-indices of tracks are typically low, with a mean of 11.95 (SD 25.23) and a median of 3. New Age, Classical, Children's, and Jazz exhibit lower repetition rates, as most tracks have low h-indices. In contrast, Rap, R&B, Country & Folk, and Indie Rock boast a higher prevalence of tracks with higher h-indices. Pop falls in the center of the plot, signifying that Pop songs have moderate h-indices. The observed trends remain consistent with the previous section's result despite measuring consumption rates differently. The same genres continue to be characterized by high, minimal, or moderate (namely, Pop) consumption rates.\n\n4.3 Controlling for Recommendation Bias\n\nAlgorithmic recommendations are crucial in streaming services such as Spotify to personalize user experience, promote discovery, and support audience growth. This begs the question: Are our findings influenced by the varying frequency of recommendations for certain genres, which can influence consumption? To test this, we repeat our previous analyses with streams not sourced from a recommendation system. This includes editorial lists that Spotify curates specifically for users. For every track a user has listened to, we extract the first time a user has listened to a track. We then identified if the source of the first stream was directly from a recommendation. We then remove all streams of tracks that were first streamed from a direct recommendation. Due to space constraints, we do not display the full results here, but we confirm that the same genres’ new releases continue to exhibit high or low consumption rates (see Appendix Fig. 7).\n\n4.4 Modeling Tracks’ Streaming Volume\n\nNo. Listeners Model All Not From Rec. %↓ Median (Baseline) 2.298 2.035 - [1pt/1.5pt] Mean (Baseline) 2.286 2.031 0.4% [1pt/1.5pt] Genre Availability 2.215 1.970 3.1% [1pt/1.5pt] Release Details 2.053 1.990 3.4% [1pt/1.5pt] Artist Popularity 2.047 1.863 2.7% [1pt/1.5pt] Genre Popularity 1.916 1.804 0.5% [1pt/1.5pt] Genre 1.867 1.752 2.7% [1pt/1.5pt] Genre + Artist Popularity 1.516 1.498 15.8%\n\nWe run several predictive modeling analyses with different feature sets to rigorously examine what factors predict new release consumption at the track level. We use the following sets of features:\n\nGenre, one-hot encoded as a categorical variable.\n\nGenre Availability: the total number of tracks in that genre category over the course of our study period. We take the average if a track has multiple genres.\n\nGenre Popularity: the average streams per track for all tracks in the genre category. We take the average if a track has multiple genres.\n\nRelease Details: the day of the week the track was released and the one-hot encoded format of release.\n\nArtist Popularity: the number of monthly listeners the artist had in the 28-day preceding period. We take the average if a track has multiple artists. This variable is log-transformed to remove skewness.\n\nThe target variable we are predicting is the number of listeners. To ensure we account for both one-time and repeated engagement, we predict multiple targets at once: the number of listeners that listened to it once, twice, four times, and eight times. To remove skewness, we log transform the number of listeners. If the number of listeners is zero, we add a small ϵ = 0.1 before the log transformation.\n\nWe build a deep neural network with 10 hidden layers, each configured with 32 hidden units, ReLu activation, and L2 regularization. We also employ 20% Dropout layers after each dense layer. The model is trained with an Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 10− 4 for up to 300 epochs, halting early if the validation loss stops improving. The hyperparameter was set after an initial trial run of hyperparameter tuning, where we experimented with the number of hidden layers, units, etc. The dataset is split into a 60%-20%-20% train-validation-test random split, and all features are normalized according to the training set.\n\nWe use the Mean and Median models as baselines, which heuristically predict the mean or median of the training set. In line with our previous efforts to control for recommendation bias, we run prediction models separately for predicting the total number of listeners and the number of listeners not originally from recommendation.\n\n4.4.1 Results. We display our results in Table 1. While all the features demonstrate enhancements over the naive baselines, using genre as a one-hot encoded variable stands out as the most impactful single feature to predict a new release's streaming volume. We also experimented with combining some or all features. Notably, the most effective combination was achieved using genre and artist popularity as predictors, resulting in an additional 15.8% improvement in performance compared to using only genre labels. Intuitively, it is logical that the artist's popularity is a strong predictor of a new release's success. However, we emphasize that relying solely on artists’ popularity isn't sufficient; its full usefulness is obtained when coupled with genre labels.\n\nFor a deeper exploration, we present the Pearson correlation between artist popularity and streaming volume for each genre in Fig. 3. While every genre displays a significant positive correlation, the strength of this correlation varies. Notably, Indie Rock's new releases exhibit a robust correlation of 0.80 between artist popularity and streaming volume, whereas New Age records a meager correlation of 0.01. Corroborating previous analyses, genres associated with older eras or functional roles—New Age, Classical, and Children's—rank the lowest. Somewhat surprisingly, Pop also ranks very low. Upon further analysis, we find that this is attributed to many Pop tracks by famous artists that have lower streaming volumes than other songs by the same artist.\n\nModel MSE % ↓ Diversity Index 0.911 - [1pt/1.5pt] Demographics 0.906 0.6% [1pt/1.5pt] Exploration Index 0.903 0.3% [1pt/1.5pt] Loyalty Index 0.798 11.6% [1pt/1.5pt] Genre 0.758 5.0% [1pt/1.5pt] Past Streaming Vol. (by Genre) 0.590 22.2% [1pt/1.5pt] Exclusivity Index 0.559 5.2% [1pt/1.5pt] Past Streaming Vol. (by Genre & Content Age) 0.475 15.0% [1pt/1.5pt] Past Streaming Vol. (by Genre & Content Age) 0.442 6.9% + Loyalty Index + Exclusivity Index\n\n7 DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper, we elucidate several observations about the consumption of new music releases from the perspective of genres. Below, we present key insights and implications.\n\nVarying Importance of New Releases Across Genres. Our analysis underscores the divergence in new release consumption rates across different genres. New Age, Classical, or Jazz new music tend to amass lower levels of consumption, which may be explained by their frequent use as functional music, catering to specific activities or moods (e.g., playlists titled Lo-fi Meditation, Peaceful Piano, or Coffee Table Jazz), where users may find existing tracks that already meet their music needs. On the other hand, genres associated with cultural identity, such as Latin, Rap, and Country & Folk, exhibit heightened new release consumption. One reason may be that the social aspects of music listening as a form of entertainment foster a sense of community among artists and listeners, incentivizing listeners to keep up-to-date with the latest releases. An alternative explanation is that the genres with higher new release consumption rates are also those that are more relevant in the current music climate, with many aspiring artists and musicians actively creating new music. This, in turn, leads to more media coverage and social media influence, driving user consumption. Genres such as Classical are typically from a bygone era, which could decrease the relevancy of their new releases. We see great potential for future research to further examine the functional, cultural, and historical aspects of genre in new release streaming.\n\nThe Peculiar Position of Pop.\n\nA noteworthy discovery in this study is that the demand for new Pop music, which supposedly should reflect current demand and trends in music, is not highly sought after. Pop music consistently occupies an intriguing middle ground in terms of new release consumption, prompting us to explore possible explanations. The accessibility of Pop music, characterized by a lower entry barrier and a plethora of tracks, perhaps renders it too ubiquitous and homogeneous, leading to a decline in novelty and diminishing interest in new releases. The inherent vagueness of Pop as a genre further complicates matters, possibly acting as a broad “catch-all” category that obscures other nuanced musical styles. Additionally, Pop's mainstream appeal may not actively encourage users to explore new releases, resulting in a “rich get richer” effect as consumption is dominated by established artists and select tracks. We present one piece of evidence of this in the appendix (Table 4), which shows that the top 20% of new Pop music accounts for 99% of all new Pop streams, surpassing all other genres. One future direction is to investigate the role of listener age since Pop may appeal more to younger listeners [30].\n\nDistinctness of User's New Release Genre Preferences. Our findings underscore the distinctness of user preferences for new releases compared to their overall musical tastes, suggesting that new release recommendation should be considered as a separate task from overall music recommendation. That said, we still find that prior genre preference holds substantial power in forecasting users’ new release streaming volume. This is because, again, the importance of new releases is different across genres. Users’ affinity for some genres can predict new release streaming in those genres (e.g., Latin) but not in others (e.g., New Age). Another observation is that the relative preference for genres holds significantly less weight compared to absolute preference. This insight indicates that the competition for new release streaming between genres doesn't necessarily follow a zero-sum dynamic; instead, it could potentially evolve into a mutually beneficial scenario for various genres.\n\nUsers’ Stable Desire for Novelty. We find that users’ preference for new releases is not only influenced by an individual's absolute genre preference but also by their propensity for newer content. Remarkably, we observe that users’ preference for newer or older content is stable, indicating that users range from those who consistently prefer chasing newer content to those who consistently prefer older music. Although demographic features such as age are a possible explanation for these differences, we find that using demographic features alone was a poor predictor of new music listening, suggesting there are other motives influencing user behavior. We present two theories to explain the preferences of individuals favoring older music. Firstly, they might derive enjoyment from the familiar comforts of well-known tracks [39]. Alternatively, they could fall into the category of late adopters in the music consumption process, preferring to rely on their social circles, societal trends, and recommendation algorithms to guide their choices based on popular preferences and recommended content. Future research could look into whether this observed trend holds for not only new releases but any music that is new to a user.\n\nEmpowering Artists through Genre-driven Insights. Our research also contains important implications for artists, particularly emerging ones. Within this dataset, about a quarter of all new releases have yet to receive any streams within 28 days of their release. This highlights a critical need for strategies to effectively target the right users and promote new releases, which is essential for artist growth. Streaming platforms can empower artists by providing genre-specific insights and helping them align their releases with the preferences of their target audience.\n\nTailoring Recommendation Models and Strategies. Based on our central finding that genre is a very predictive feature of new release consumption, we propose a few general guidelines for recommending new music that can help not only users but also artists. To deliver a more personalized music streaming experience, we suggest recommendation algorithms take into account both users’ genre preference as well as their content age preferences. For genres characterized by high new release consumption rates, platforms can emphasize the freshness of content, capitalizing on users’ enthusiasm for the latest releases. Conversely, for genres with lower new release consumption, platforms can adopt a subtler approach, promoting new music by recommending it to users in alternative ways that don't solely hinge on its newness, such as by blending them with existing music in curated playlists. As genre labels are readily available and easily interpretable, we can improve recommender systems by incorporating genre labels in the model. We emphasize that this study does not replace but rather complements existing recommendation approaches in music streaming as part of a holistic view of recommendation algorithms.\n\nFostering Genre-Based Music Communities. We observe that for certain genres, audiences stay updated on the latest releases without relying on algorithmic recommendations. This hints that users are actively following some artists or information of news releases disseminated through social media or other social avenues, which strongly suggests the presence of genre-centric communities where users actively engage. Recognizing this, efforts could be directed toward fostering community development within these new-release-focused genres, benefiting both listeners and music creators.\n\nLimitations. This research has several limitations that warrant consideration. Chiefly, our study relies exclusively on genre labels provided by a third-party source, Gracenote. While Gracenote is a leading music metadata provider in the industry, we are not privy to the exact process by which genre labels are assigned. However, we believe that using a platform-agnostic and independent source of genre labels of expert quality renders our choice sensible. Given that music, like other art forms, is subject to constant evolution, its classification system should similarly evolve [1]. Consequently, our research should be regarded as a snapshot of new music consumption within the current, widely acknowledged context of genre classification.\n\nFinally, while Spotify offers an extensive collection of songs and has ∼ 500 million monthly active users, it may not be the primary music streaming platform in all regions globally. Consequently, our research may reflect a Western-centric or platform-specific bias, potentially leading to the apparent popularity or unpopularity of certain genres in the absence of streaming data from alternative platforms.\n\nBroader Impact. While this work focuses exclusively on music genres and new music releases, the insights learned from our research have broader applicability to other forms of entertainment, such as short videos, podcasts, movies, and audiobooks. These other forms of content can also be classified into genres that resonate with different audiences and serve different entertainment needs.\n\nEthical Considerations. Our research is done in accordance with our ethical principles. We only gathered limited personal information about users to use as baselines for comparisons. In addition, this work presents an opportunity to improve recommendation services in on-demand streaming that can improve user experience as well as support long-tail artists, benefiting the music community. Moreover, we show that these improvements might be accomplished through simple and ethical approaches without invading user privacy, utilizing users’ time allocated to various genres rather than assuming preferences based on, for instance, demographics.\n\nWe emphasize that our results should not be misused or misconstrued. This research does not imply that some genres are more important than others but rather that new releases are consumed differently across genres. Such misinterpretations may pressure artists to make music that fits consumption trends, which would stifle musical creativity and diversity. Additionally, we do not advocate for manipulative recommendation practices to target music at users. Our intent is to provide insights that support ethical and equitable improvements in music streaming."
