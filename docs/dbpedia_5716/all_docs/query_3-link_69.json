        "text": "National and state offices draw a lot of attention, but we cannot overlook the importance of positions at the local level and the direct influence they have on communities. The purpose of The Policy Circle Engagement Guides is to provide context and resources related to local level engagement opportunities, so you can have a say in what’s happening in your community, be an informed community member, and build your network and social fabric. This guide focuses on neighborhood associations, their role in the community, and what to consider if you are interested in being involved.\n\nWhat are Neighborhood Associations\n\nNeighborhood associations are groups of residents who regularly meet to accomplish specific goals in their communities. Members include homeowners, renters, business owners, school faculty, religious institution officials, and members of local community organizations. The goal of a neighborhood association is to identify challenges and concerns among residents, to “support change and improvement efforts, help resolve conflicts, provide volunteers for community initiatives, represent the neighborhood as a whole to elated officials and find resources to make the neighborhood a better place to live.”\n\nNeighborhood associations:\n\nHelp neighbors get to know each other and build community\n\nPlan and host special events and social activities\n\nDiscuss neighborhood concerns and find solutions\n\nEmpower residents to represent the collective interests of the community\n\nMake physical improvements in the neighborhood\n\nEffectively communicate with public officials and other local groups\n\nThe first step to forming a neighborhood association is determining if there is enough interest to start one. If there is, interested residents can form a steering committee to consider the purpose of the association, its bylaws, and the boundaries of the neighborhood. Once these proposals are made, the committee can reach out to the neighborhood to host a meeting where residents can share concerns, come to a consensus on the boundaries and bylaws, and help develop a neighborhood plan. This includes addressing the particular concerns of residents and establishing various committees to address different problems, such as a crime reduction committee or a green spaces committee.\n\nOnce decided, the association can register with the neighborhood or city information center to be put in the neighborhood database. This is not necessary, but it does list the association as the official representative of the neighborhood, allows for direct communication with public agencies, and allows meetings and events to be added to the city’s calendar or events page.\n\nA neighborhood association is not the same as a homeowners association (HOA). HOAs are formal legal entities that are “created to maintain common areas and enforce private deed restrictions.” Most HOAs impose mandatory fees that pay for care for public spaces, as well as rules on what can be done with the exterior of homes. Whereas membership in neighborhood associations is voluntary, property owners in a defined area are required to belong to the HOA and are subject to its rules.\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nStrong neighborhoods and communities have long been central components of American life, and a community’s well-being is related to that of its residents. Local business owners, members of the city council, school faculty, and residents all play an important role in the future of their neighborhoods. Neighborhood associations are a means through which community members can actively engage with one another and provide their communities with beauty, prosperity, and human connectedness. See The Policy Circle’s Stitching the Fabric of Neighborhoods Brief for more on how community engagement and government intervention develop and change neighborhoods.\n\nQuestions to Ask Yourself\n\nWhat needle do you want to move in your community – budget and taxes, education, infrastructure and utilities, healthcare, planning and zoning?\n\nWhat’s your background/experience? What are your skills? Is your LinkedIn profile up to date?\n\nHow much time do you have to give?\n\nWhere to Start\n\nMeasure:\n\nDoes a neighborhood association already exist?\n\nIf so, what are its boundaries? If not, what would those boundaries be?\n\nDo you know the state of social infrastructure (physical places that allow bonds to develop, such as cafes, libraries, and parks) in your community or state?\n\nIdentify:\n\nWho runs your city’s or neighborhood’s information center\n\nWho is actively involved in the neighborhood and community?\n\nHow involved are local public officials?\n\nWho are the contacts at the Community Development Office in your area, or the contacts at your local Chamber of Commerce?\n\nReach out: Find allies and build community networks.\n\nTalk to community members from school faculty to small business owners to see their visions and understand their concerns.\n\nConsider organizing a community meeting, distributing flyers, or going door-to-door.\n\nPlan: Set milestones, don’t try to do it all at once.\n\nFind out if there is enough interest among community members.\n\nMeet with city or neighborhood information center staff to discuss proposed boundaries and bylaws.\n\nIntroduce the idea to residents to get feedback.\n\nRegister with the city or neighborhood information center.\n\nExecute:\n\nPlan to write an opinion piece in your local paper or share remarks at a local meeting.\n\nConsider organizing a steering committee to establish the purpose and boundaries of the association.\n\nHost a meeting where neighbors can share concerns.\n\nAttend regular meetings or events held by the neighborhood association if one already exists.\n\nConsider volunteering for activities, or even becoming a registered member.\n\nAdditional Resources"
