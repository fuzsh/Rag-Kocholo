        "text": "Episode 244 - Understanding Your Book's Neighborhood with Nat Connors\n\nJune 25, 2024\n\n\"Market research is an ongoing process if you're an author. And in fact, I call it market awareness more than market research--we need to be aware of our market, aware of what's going on around us. We make most of our time for writing because that's what we love, but we also have to look up from our keyboards occasionally and see what other people in our genre are doing, see how readers are responding to it, and think a little bit about how that affects us.\" —Nat Connors\n\nAre you getting value from the podcast? Consider supporting me on Patreon or through Buy Me a Coffee!\n\nNat Connors discusses UNDERSTANDING YOUR BOOK’S NEIGHBORHOOD, including the importance of understanding what books you want your book to appear next to and how authors can use data to guide their publishing decisions about positioning their books. We discuss wide versus KU, series versus standalone, pricing, cover design, blurbs, and compliance with genre conventions. We discuss the importance of tracking the best practices in your genre, how to solicit input from readers to get the most valid results, and using categories to educate the retail platforms about your books.

He advocates for what he calls \"market awareness,\" suggesting that authors periodically engage with market trends while balancing writing and promotional efforts.\n\nChoosing Publishing Platforms - Wide vs. Kindle Unlimited (KU):\n\nThe discussion shifts to deciding between publishing wide (across multiple platforms) or exclusively through Amazon's Kindle Unlimited. This decision is noted as genre-specific, with some genres traditionally performing better on KU. Nat mentions how book length and author preference for marketing channels play into this choice, with tools like Draft2Digital facilitating multi-store marketing.\n\nSeries vs. Standalone Books:\n\nConsidering whether to write a series or standalone books is another focal point. Nat points out that series may benefit more from KU due to the binge-reading potential, whereas standalone books might appeal differently to the market. He also discusses the impact of series on book cover design, stressing the need for visual consistency across series.\n\nPricing Strategies:\n\nThe conversation touches on pricing strategies, highlighting the recent trends of increasing ebook prices. Nat discusses the strategic pricing of series books and the implications of Amazon’s pricing policies on royalties, advocating for pricing that aligns with perceived value and competitive positioning.\n\nCover Design and Market Trends:\n\nCover design is a critical topic, with Nat advising authors to revisit their cover designs periodically to align with current market trends. He recommends subscribing to reader-focused newsletters to understand visual trends and stresses the importance of covers in marketing and reader engagement.\n\nBlurb Writing and Genre Conventions:\n\nThe role of book blurbs and the need to keep them updated with genre conventions is discussed. Nat suggests using AI tools like ChatGPT to refresh blurbs, while cautioning against losing originality.\n\nUnderstanding and Utilizing Genre Categories:\n\nNat explores the significance of accurately categorizing books in online retail platforms like Amazon to ensure they appear alongside similar titles, enhancing visibility and sales potential.\n\nKindletrends and Author Resources:\n\nNat concludes by discussing Kindletrends, which provides genre-specific insights and trends to help authors make informed decisions.\n\nTranscript"
