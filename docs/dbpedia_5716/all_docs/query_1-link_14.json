        "text": "Every form of art has genres. Many storytelling art forms, such as theater or writing, have genres such as comedy, horror, or science-fiction. Visual art forms, instead of the traditional “genres” as we know them, tend to be defined by style and medium.\n\nAll genres have subgenres, as well: science-fiction can be soft or hard, space or time travel, romance or tragedy, and anything and everything in-between.\n\nMusic, however, goes far beyond anything that these arts use. Music has hyper-specific subgenres, each with their own distinct mood, sound, and aesthetic.\n\nThere’s not really one definitive explanation for this, although it may be because of the community aspect of the music world. Film and literature may have communities, yes, but music is community. It’s part of the reason why so many of today’s subcultures center around a corresponding music genre — it’s the community that that subculture latched onto.\n\nThis is supported by the fact that most obscure subgenres are acknowledged only by their community or communities surrounding them, suggesting that the community is inherently tied to and thus not separable from the subgenre.\n\nYou can also see this in the way that music subgenres are aligned with mainstream, “parent genres”. Indie, marginalized, and lesser-known artists are most likely to have a tight-knit community, whereas bigger communities around say, pop in general, are looser and less intimate. Because of this (or, at least, presumably because of this,) obscure, “child genres” are more likely to group around the parent genres that have more indie, marginalized, and lesser-known artists, such as punk.\n\nPunk music itself has innumerable subgenres and thus subcultures within it — folk punk, psychobilly, queercore, you name it.\n\nBut I digress. Circling back around to my main point, music has a lot of subgenres, and I think that’s really cool. This article is mainly just to preface another one which I will publish soon, listing and describing some of my favorites.\n\nUntil then, though, I would like to direct your attention to this website, which has a fairly comprehensive list of musical subgenres. I’d highly recommend checking them out, especially if they fall under a parent genre you enjoy.\n\nCiao!"
