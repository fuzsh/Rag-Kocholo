        "text": "Children’s Health Ireland (CHI) Arts in Health Programme is seeking to engage an artist / artists to work with young people in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 on the creation of a body of artwork to be shown as part of their exhibition programme in the concourse of the new children’s hospital in Rialto. The Arts in Health Programme is open to submissions from artist partnerships (e.g. visual artist and spoken word poet).\n\nThe New Children’s Hospital Concourse and CHI Gallery\n\nThe new children’s hospital in the grounds of St James’s Hospital will engage children and young people of all ages through intriguing design, a range of interactive artworks and playful spaces including gardens on the fourth floor level.\n\nThe hospital concourse is the heart of the new hospital. It is a huge space, into which people will arrive from many directions on their way to outpatients appointments, day care and the wards. Almost the length of Grafton Street and four stories high, with an anticipated footfall of 9000+ people a day, this concourse will be Ireland’s largest room, meeting the needs of its smallest people.\n\nThe CHI Arts in Health Programme is creating a dedicated gallery space at the north entrance of the hospital for the display of temporary exhibitions funded by BAM’s Community Benefit Fund for the new children’s hospital, which is a partnership of NPHDB/CHI and the local community. Children and young people from the local community will be invited to make work for the opening exhibition.\n\nCreative Engagement Project and Opening Exhibition\n\nChildren and young people will attend the new children’s hospital from all parts of Ireland and from further afield. For some, it may be their first time in Dublin 8 and yet during their hospital stay, they may not get the chance to explore the neighbourhood.\n\nCHI Arts in Health Programme will support young people attending secondary schools in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 to make a body of art work for the opening exhibition that gives patients a sense of the hospital neighbourhood. The work will be developed in collaboration with the successful artist(s) who will be required to engage multiple young voices across different groups into one coherent body of work.\n\nThe working title for the exhibition is ‘Welcome to the Neighbourhood’. It will be in place when the new children’s hospital opens in 2025 .\n\nBudget\n\nArtist(s) fees including planning, facilitation, research, curation, travel and VAT: €12,000\n\nMaterials and production budget: €8,000\n\nHow to apply\n\nFor details on the application process, submission requirements and timeline, download the briefing document: https://www.artsandhealth.ie/assets/uploads/2024/05/Welcome-to-the-Neighbourhood-FINAL-May-2024.pdf\n\nThe closing date for the receipt of applications is Tuesday, 11 June 2024 at 5pm."
