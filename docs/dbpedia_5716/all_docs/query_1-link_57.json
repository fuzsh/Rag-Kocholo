        "text": "1. Research into Music Genres Sophie Boston G324\n\n2. What is a music genre?  ‘Genre’ can almost be replaced by the word ‘category’. The Oxford Definition for it is ‘A style or category of art, music, or literature: the spy thriller is a very masculine genre the science fiction genre’  The origin of the word ‘genre’ comes from early 17th Century France, literally meaning ‘a kind’.  There are many different genres in the music industry including main ones such as Rock, Pop, Classical, Indie/Folk, House, Dance etc, but there are also sub genres, which are typically songs that are a mixture of the main ones listed above, e.g. Indie Rock.  Genre is important for many reasons, including that whatever genre you decide you’re going to base your media text on, in this case a music video, that genre is going to attract a specific audience, and you will need to keep in with the conventions of that genre to keep your audience interested. Conventions of a genre are also helpful because they set up a template for other media makers. Lastly Genre is an important aspect because it helps associate artists with a particular identity e.g. Avril Lavigne is a pop artist but with a slightly dark, Gothic hint to her. This also applies to music video directors e.g. David Fincher deals with ‘classic’ icons such as Michael Jackson and Madonna. This is an example of Ryall’s Triangle of linking the audience, artist and music video director together.\n\n3. My Genre  The genre of my music video is Indie – “The Power Of Love” though previous versions of the song e.g. Frankie Goes to Hollywood would be classed as Indie Rock, due to the earthy, masculine tones, and the use of drums and bass instruments.  Why does my song fit into this genre?  My song fits into this genre because it fits a majority of the conventions that Indie music involves. “The Power of Love” is a mixture of Indie and Pop, but more primarily Indie. It fits only into the Pop genre as she is wearing fashionable, of the moment clothing, which is slightly hippie, which fits perfectly with the conventions of indie clothing, but borrowing styles from other genres is a typical convention of Pop music. It fits into Pop as well because the lyrics, as Pop usually does, consists of love, however it is not totally Pop because whereas Pop portrays the lyrics and singer as happy or rebellious, Aplin’s version is quite sad, with an almost mournful tone. On the next slide I will display the conventions of Indie Music Conventions and put a tick next to the ones that apply to my video.\n\n4. Indie Music Conventions All of these conventions fit into my music video."
