        "text": "COVID-19 & Neighborhood Strings\n\nPosted June 14, 2020\n\nAriana Falk, WCMS Education Director\n\nThe spring brought a challenge none of us anticipated with the onset of COVID and the subsequent shutdown of the schools and the world as we know it. In the midst of it all, we at WCMS felt the urgent need to keep Neighborhood Strings strong and find a way to keep our connection to our participants.\n\nMany of our families experienced loss of employment and childcare options, and economic distress. Many parents work in essential jobs that left them at daily risk of exposure.\n\nAt the same time, kids were isolated from school, extended family, and activities, often confined to homes that were crowded. For most kids in the program, school provides daily hot meals and access to health care in addition to class.\n\nWe moved quickly to offer our private lessons online through Zoom, Facetime, Skype, WhatsApp, or whatever video or phone technology the families had. The continuing lessons were intense and challenging: kids had to seek quiet space to play in homes that are often crowded or loud; they might be in charge of younger siblings or left alone for periods of the day. Some had instruments that were locked in school and needed to be retrieved; some poor or no internet access. Newer players were not used to tuning their own instruments.\n\nNonetheless, the teachers and parents alike found a wonderful “silver lining” in the intimacy of teaching “in” the kids’ homes. We got to connect with parents, meet pets, and develop a new kind of relationship. By the second week, nearly 75% of participants were taking lessons with teachers 1-2 times a week. In group Zoom gatherings, kids had the chance to socialize and chat with their peers in addition to playing together. The teen club gathered weekly and worked on creating an audio-engineered piece of Baroque chamber music. Kids and parents alike commented that the connection to music, their teachers, and their peers felt like a lifeline during the strangeness of the times.\n\nOn our end, the staff developed a new Online Portal for students that had practice and teaching videos, useful apps and games, and sheet music. The Portal gives any student with internet or phone access a way to stay connected to our community throughout the week.\n\nAn end-of-year “virtual concert” featured the kids recording videos of themselves playing, applauding and chatting each other between performances, receiving nice words from teachers, and eating a non-virtual cookie that was dropped off in a care package at each house. We celebrated our 3 graduating seniors who are all off to college.\n\nFinally, near the end of the spring, our community is engaged in the national conversation around the death of George Floyd and the urgency to commit to anti-racism. The conversation is ongoing, and we feel the trauma experienced by many in our Black community.\n\nIn our group we remain to creating a shared space where all have a voice through music, and\n\nwe can recommit to working toward justice and equity in all of our practices.\n\nOne of the most exciting times of the year for us is when our Neighborhood Strings student musicians receive their instruments! They walk in regular people…and walk out as proud musicians.\n\nOur Education Director and head of Neighborhood Strings, Ariana Falk, said it best that when they receive their instruments for the first time, it’s incredibly exciting and gratifying. “The instrument is like a symbol of the effort and commitment they have already made, but also of so much possibility and creativity. There is so much potential to be creative in those pieces of wood, and so many things to explore. They also feel the trust we are putting in them by giving them these fragile, art-like instruments.”\n\nSurrounded by their families and supporters, the students – most of them from Main South – beamed with pride. For them, receiving the instruments represents much more than having that violin or a viola to finally create music on; it’s a culmination of weeks of preparation, instruction and background of those instruments. Since November, the students, ranging in ages 6-12, attended an after-school program at Woodland Academy two to three times a week to learn music fundamentals. Before the holidays, these students practice their postures and positions by holding cereal-box violins and dowel bows, prepping for the real thing.\n\nBoth 10-year-old Boen and nine-year-old Caleb said they were going to try to “see if they can play it” the minute they got home that night. The two student musicians were among 11 who received their instruments in the sixth annual ceremony for Neighborhood Strings.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about our Neighborhood Strings program, contact Ariana Falk, Education Director for the Worcester Chamber Music Society at Ariana@ worcesterchambermusic.org.\n\nMusic Meets Art for Youth Art Month\n\nPosted March 25, 2018\n\nTracy Kraus, WCMS Executive Director\n\nOur free annual family concert proved to be a crowd-pleaser again. We sold out early and packed the house with an enthusiastic audience of all ages for Sergei Prokofiev’s “Peter and the Wolf,” the musical fairy tale set to music as a that is a popular introduction to classical music for kids.\n\nWorcester Chamber Music Society musicians played while Rohan Gregory narrated the piece, and Neighborhood Strings opened up the concert. To complement Youth Art Month we projected pieces by local art students on the big screen during the musical performance. The art not only punctuated the story, but showcased some excellent pieces by students from Worcester’s Chandler Magnet Elementary School.\n\nWhen we reached out to Ann Rokosky, visual arts educator at Chandler Magnet, she was enthusiastic about working with us on the show. Plus, a parent of one of the students had been attending the annual concert for years with her Girl Scout Troop and urged her to get involved with us.\n\nRokosky shares our belief that Youth Art Month is important to communities, and gives students a chance for their voices to be heard outside of a school setting. By pairing it with our music, the school and the artwork got out to a whole new set of eyes and ears and enhanced the telling of our musical story.\n\n“I appreciated the opportunity to work in tandem with something musical,” Rokosky told us. “Over the past two summers, I have spent some time volunteering and working with the BSO’s Days in the Arts, (DARTS Summer Program). While at DARTS I was able to be reminded of and see that an extraordinarily powerful connection can be made when all of the art forms work together (visual art, music vocal and instrumental, dance and drama). I think that music and visual art truly complement and make each other stronger when paired.”\n\nThe artwork that visually strung through the Peter and the Wolf family concert was done by the 4th, 5th and 6th graders at Chandler Magnet, and were in both 2D and 3D forms. The works were photographed and projected on the screens during the performance, and ten boards were on display in Mechanics Hall.\n\nWCMS delivered Prokofiev’s most frequently performed work through music and narration, and the youth of Worcester brought it further to life with art"
