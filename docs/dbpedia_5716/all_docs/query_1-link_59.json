        "text": "As a content creator, one of the biggest elements in video creation, aside from the actual content, is the music you use. Thoughtfully crafting the audio of your YouTube videos or podcast is essential to adding another layer of emotional connection with your viewers. You might be wondering where YouTubers get their music from. There are a variety of music licensing services out there to help you find the music that you need to complete your story, but what’s the best option?\n\nOne popular option you might have heard of is Artlist. Artlist is a well-known platform among creators, but it might not be the right one for you.

They may want a more intuitive interface that matches their search habits.\n\nPopularity: Artlist is established as a go-to music licensing service in not only the content creator community, but also in the commercial video space.
