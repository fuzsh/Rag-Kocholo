        "text": "These Are The Artists In Your Neighbourhood brings together a bunch of high school students from Thomas A. Stewart Secondary School with a bunch of artists from in and around the metropolis of Peterborough.\n\nThe deal: the students visit the artists’ studios and are permitted to ask any questions they want; the artists welcome the students into their studies and are permitted to decline any questions they want. Then we flip it: artists asking, students answering. Then we separate everyone and ask them what they really thought of each other.\n\nThe whole thing is recorded and deftly edited, eliminating all but the best bits, which are preserved for your listening pleasure.\n\nWhat exactly is an artist? What exactly is a student?\n\nProject Credits\n\nProduced by: Mammalian Diving Reflex\n\nPresented by: Public Energy Performing Arts\n\nGuest Artists: Nicole Bauberger, Anita Murphy, Kathryn Durst, Alice Olsen Williams, Gillian Turnham, Melanie Marion McCall\n\nStudents: Isabella Bravo, Tigerlily Cochrane, Marshall Coker, Rayner Crosby-Bobette, Elliot Cruikshank, Alyssa Cui, Sophie Cuthbert, Khoi Diamond, Leo Francis, Aaliyah Frederick, Molly Gabriel, Alannah Getz, Emileah Gray-Brady, Taylor Hoffard, Jay Hopkins, AJ Livings, Grimm McKay, Talulah (Nomi) McKenzie, Devan Nobes, Jaina Picken, Neo Purdue, Charcoal Reid, Aither Safar, Emmy Tye, Sephira Wildheart, Violet Wuis\n\nCollaboration with Thomas A.
