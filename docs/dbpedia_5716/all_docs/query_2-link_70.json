        "text": "It can be argued that with every passing year, groups and duos within Hip-Hop are increasingly becoming less common within the genre. As more more artists and producers opt for more solo careers or one-off collaborations, the sight of the quintessential Hip-Hop crew is now a rare sight . Challenging this notion however, are the Neighborhood Kids (Amon the Emcee, Verde, DJ JG, Niko Rosy, Gatoz Locoz, and Emerson). A crew of emcees, producers, DJs and live musicians who have not only challenged status quo through their music. But also blend genres and push the boundaries of conventional Hip-Hop. After years of collaborating and working adjacent with one another, this one of a kind crew of crew has quickly made a name for themselves as one of San Diego’s busiest and most promising up-and coming group’s in the region’s underground Hip-Hop scene.\n\nIn our latest installment of Step Off! Radio, group members Amon the Emcee, Verde and DJ JG came on to the show to talk about their experiences as emcees, producers, DJs and to reflect on their general experiences as independent artists in San Diego’s underground Hip-Hop community.\n\nIn this interview you will be able to hear and WATCH our conversation diving into the members early years, their influences, their journey into Hip-Hop, and what eventually led to them founding of the Neighborhood Kids and their quest to be innovators and envelope pushers in the local scene. Likewise, we also discuss what it means to the group to be socially conscious artists, the power to teach and make change through music, discuss upcoming projects and what the future holds for his music. So with that said, we are proud to present to you our conversation with the Amon, Verde, and DJ JG of the Neighborhood Kids!\n\nFeatured below is our full interview with the Neighborhood Kids available through our official SoundCloud page.
