        "text": "POV: Indie is a music genre distinguished by its independent, do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to production and promotion. The genre is recognizable by its lo-fi sound, unconventional instrumentation, and DIY aesthetic. It has close associations with the punk and indie rock scenes and is considered a more accessible alternative to mainstream music. POV: Indie provides independent artists with an avenue to express themselves creatively without the constraints of the mainstream music industry."
