        "text": "We all have our favorites in the music industry, whether you enjoy listening to the most known artists today, or artists with less recognition. One of my top favorites is the band The Neighbourhood (The NBHD). The Neighbourhood is an r&b/alternative rock band who were formed in Newbury Park, California in 2011. If that name sounds familiar, you may recall them by their most recognized songs such as Sweater Weather, Wiped Out!, or one of their newest songs, Stargazing.\n\nIf you’re into the R&B/Alternative Rock genre like I am, then you’ll be enlightened to read this review.\n\nIf you do recognize the name Sweater Weather, that’s because it’s one of their songs released from their first full-length album “I Love You”, which was released in April of 2013. If you want a good starting point for the NBHD, Sweater Weather is a good choice because of how it’s one of their biggest hits.\n\nSongs that I would give the highest rating to recommend are Ferrari, Greetings from Califournia, and R.I.P 2 My Youth from their ’Wiped Out!” (2015) album. This album is what defined themselves as a band when they were first starting out, even with some of their songs like Daddy Issues and The Beach going viral on TikTok in 2020.\n\nOther songs I’d highly recommend include songs from their most recent album, “Chip Chrome and The Mono-Tones” (2020) such as Devil’s Advocate, Lost In Translation, and Middle of Somewhere. Chip Chrome and The Mono-Tones steps away from the moody type of vibe and feel of “Wiped Out!” by introducing more vibrant and different sounds, while still being able to tell similar stories that Wiped Out! told. One of the most anticipated songs for the past 2-3 years has been their most recent single, “Fallen Star”. After a snippet of the song started floating around the internet for a long time, many fans, including myself, anticipated the release of the song ever since then. After such a long wait, I believe it’s time for more people to give it a chance and listen.\n\nI believe the band is greatly underappreciated, and hopefully these songs can expand people’s music inventory and allow others to enjoy the band like I have."
