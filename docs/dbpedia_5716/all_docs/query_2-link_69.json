Daphna Mor will lend her virtuoso recorder playing and vocals to The Shul Band’s high energy sound. They will collaborate on Klezmer songs, Sephardic grooves, Chanukah specials, and more. Special guests TBA.\n\nPraised as a ‘Recorder virtuoso’ and for her “astonishing virtuosity” by The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune, musician Daphna Mor has performed as an instrumentalist and vocalist throughout Europe and the United States both as a soloist and ensemble player. Recent solo appearances include Tanglewood festival, Lincoln center, the Met Museum in New York, and St Martin’s in the Fields in London with Apollo’s Fire Orchestra. As member of the orchestra, Mor performed with The New York Philharmonic, American Classical Orchestra, New York City Opera and Orchestra of St. Luke’s to name few. She has appeared in a duo with Joyce DiDonato on the singer’s album tour for In War and Peace and can be heard on Sting’s album If On A Winter’s Night for Deutsche Grammophon. Mor is an acclaimed interpreter of Sephardic Music, and co leads the Global Music ensemble East of the River together with Nina Stern. Their new album Ija Mia is set for release in March 24 on AVIE records. As an active member in NY’s Downtown Jewish Music Scene, Mor performed with the band Pharaohs Daughter in venues as at the Knitting Factory, Stone, Tonic and recorded for John Zorn Tzadik Label."
