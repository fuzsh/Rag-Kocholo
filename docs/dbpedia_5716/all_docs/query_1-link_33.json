        "text": "Alright, here we go. What type of music do you enjoy? (Or how would you describe it?)\n\nI enjoy rock, alternative rock, J-Pop, and classical.\n\nI like music with energy and spirit. That doesn’t mean that it has to be a fast song. I also prefer louder music over softer music as you can actually hear it, and it has more energy.\n\nSo what other types of music do you like? And are there any of them you have in common?\n\nCHALLENGE: (not a rule of this thread or a barrier to this thread; this is just to make it different from other music threads) Try answering the question without giving any examples of artists or specific pieces.\n\nLots of anime and video game music, mostly of Japanese origin, but some Western series too.\n\nPop songs mostly based on trends in social media and what I might be listening to in lounge places outside (not a fan of the rave/rap places).\n\nAnd a little mix of modern Greek music too.\n\nEven some classical on rare occasions.\n\nJust feel like listening whatever is currently on my mind off all these when I would like to block away most thoughts. Or something emotional makes me feel a certain way more. I do have some songs that have specific meanings because of some inside jokes/context, for these purposes.\n\nI pretty much only listen to video game music, or at least instrumentals; it's very rare that I listen to music with lyrics (although I do love the gibberish vocals in Splatoon music lol). I prefer focusing on the song itself, rather than trying to pay attention to the lyrics, figuring out what they mean, worrying if I'm misinterpreting them or whatnot. (Plus I find that 90% of song lyrics are either edgy/dark/depressing or about love. and neither of those appeal to me)\n\nI've never paid much attention to genres but I tend to like electronic music most, the more energy the better. Other than that I like chiptune (big fan of NES and SNES music), rock, jazz, synthwave, DnB, symphonic metal, eurobeat, electro swing, and various other uncategorized things. I also like mashups or crossovers of genres sometimes, like classical + rock.\n\nI don't usually like slow music or anything that doesn't have a good beat. oddly, I can't stand lo-fi - it gets me anxious and jittery because there's not enough happening.\n\nTaking the challenge to avoid naming any specific artists here...\n\nI've said this before but my number one favorite type of music is pop punk/emo (and any related subgenre you can think of). I've been a very genuine fan of it ever since I was a kid, the sound and lyrical styles just resonate with me and it's helped me work through many dark times and complicated feelings when those come up. In general it represents my personality very well. I don't really care anymore if the majority of people think it's cringy or dated... though I sure cared a lot more back in middle school :p\n\nBut my horizons are pretty broad these days — I listen to a bunch of different genres just depending on what I wanna hear that day, and I honestly can think of very few that I actually unequivocally dislike. Some other faves of mine would probably be speedcore/gabber, smooth jazz, and I also have a really big soft spot for schmaltzy 90s pop (which is occasionally surprising to people who think my tastes are exclusively screamo, lol). Lately I've been enjoying some J-pop on the side too but it doesn't make up that much of my listening habits.\n\nAdditionally, when I was younger I was really into techno trance, happy hardcore, and symphonic gothic metal; I still like all of those of course, just not nearly as intensely as I used to. Also, I'm not really caught up with the modern stuff anymore, but I've been an avid Vocaloid enthusiast ever since the V2 days.\n\nTL;DR if it's loud and abrasive, or if there's a guitar or some corny lyrics in it, I'm probably interested."
