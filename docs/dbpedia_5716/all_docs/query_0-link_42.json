        "text": "“Sweater Weather” is the first single off The Neighbourhood’s debut release I’m Sorry\n\nGenre: Indie Rock, Electronica, Hip-Hop, Melodic R&B\n\nThe Neighbourhood is one of those bands that intentionally likes to fly under the radar. The band doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page! Blending many different types of genres together, this band has the talent to be a breakout, mainstream band. But do they want it that way? What are your thoughts on “Sweater Song”, the debut EP, and the potential of this very young band? Sound off in the comments section below!\n\n“And if I may just take your breath away.\n\nI don’t mind if there’s not much to say,\n\nSometimes the silence guides our minds to move to a place so far away.\n\nThe goosebumps start to raise,\n\nThe minute that my left hand meets your waist.\n\nAnd then I watch your face,\n\nPut my finger on your tongue ’cause you love the taste, yeah.\n\nThese hearts adore,\n\nEvery one the other beats hard is for.\n\nInside this place it’s warm,\n\nOutside it starts to pour”\n\nLinks of Interest:"
