        "text": "Toronto act The Neighbourhood Watch create a story-driven blend of folk and indie rock that has culminated in millions of streams and strong recognition from outlets such as Exclaim! and Indie88. The band is now ready to release their fourth album: a meditation on family, illness, and loving what life gives you nonetheless.\n\nNew single, “Lifeline,” is a reflection on vocalist/guitarist Tristan Surman’s experience with a chronic auto-immune disease that really wreaked havoc on his life between 2021-2022. Because of the illness, Surman had to give up a lot of who he thought he was going to be. He had to accept that this was going to be with him for the rest of his life. He had to dance with the disease rather than push it out.\n\nOur society is still stuck in the mindset of “overcoming” or “succumbing”—but that’s not the only story we need. Chronic and mental illness just live alongside us, our entire lives, like a shadow. Sometimes they become overwhelming to the point we cannot think of anything else. Sometimes they fade to the background. But we have to find a way to accept that.\n\nThat’s what the song is about: fitting illness into your heart, without letting your heart break."
