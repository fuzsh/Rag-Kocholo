        "text": "‘Stuck with me’ is the second single released by American rockers The neighbourhood ahead of their upcoming EP, ‘To Imagine’ that is set for release on January 12th.\n\n‘Stuck with me’ is a slow burning track that opens with soft atmospheric synths before incorporating a toe tap inducing beat that helps to pick the track up. Later in the track, a deep bass is brought in that keeps the classic rock style present in a track with modern aspects.\n\nVery much like the previous release ‘Scary love‘ the lyrics on this track are reflective of self-doubt and the feeling of guilt within a relationship.\n\nCheck out the track here:\n\nThe new EP ‘To Imagine’ is out January 11th on Columbia records."
