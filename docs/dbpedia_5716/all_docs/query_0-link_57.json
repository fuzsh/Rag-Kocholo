It is often characterized by its lo-fi sound, experimental instrumentation, and DIY aesthetic. It is often associated with the punk and indie rock scenes, and is often seen as a more accessible alternative to mainstream music. It is often seen as a way for independent artists to express themselves without the constraints of the mainstream music industry."
