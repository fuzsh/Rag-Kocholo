        "text": "Before any of you come for me and send me hate mail, hear me out. Or rather…read me out.\n\nBack in 2013, The Neighbourhood released a song called “Sweater Weather”, which took the world by storm and I’m almost one hundred percent positive you’ve heard it because if you haven’t…where have you been? It’s one of those songs that is instantly recognized as soon as it is played. I mean, it’s claimed to be the “bisexual anthem”, and for those of you that are completely lost in regards to whatever that means, the song has been used on TikTok as a way for people to come out. Although the song wasn’t created for that purpose, it is inspiring and heart warming to see how the LGBTQ+ community has found a sense of safety in this band’s music, feeling accepted for who they are, and in turn using their song to promote confidence in one’s sexuality.\n\nFor being a band that formed in 2012, the traction they’ve gained these past few years have been rather significant, and have only been proven to keep growing from here.\n\nBesides the respectable number of fans the band has accumulated over the years, there are many factors that play into their credibility and add to the list of reasons as to why I am trying to prove to you that they truly are the best band out there.\n\nWhen describing this band, it is actually quite impossible to pinpoint the exact genre they cater to. When beginning their career, one would describe their sound as dark and eerie, often being labelled as an “indie band”. However, that label has dissipated and is long gone due to their new sound. The Neighbourhood’s sound is constantly changing, assuring the fans that not one album would sound exactly like another. The band changing up their sound completely is not unheard of, and this was especially proven to be true after being the first band to ever put out a mixtape, where they collaborated with many different credible rappers such as French Montana, G Eazy, and even YG.\n\nThey refrain from sticking to one sound, constantly switching it up and forming a new aesthetic altogether. Their originality stands out, especially when looking at their new album.\n\nTheir album “Chip Chrome and the Monotones” revolves around a made up character by the name of Chip Chrome, which is played by the frontman Jesse Rutherford. The backstory of this persona is that Chip is a washed up celebrity, feeling out of place and used by Hollywood. There are many similarities to him and the frontman he is played by, but the two entities are separate.\n\nChip Chrome was created when Jesse Rutherford took a year long social media break due to the constant anxiety and comparisons that came with it, which began to eat the frontman alive. Many of these issues can be heard all throughout the album, which is comforting to many fans, such as myself.\n\nIt’s important for fans to feel connected to the musicians they look up to, and The Neighbourhood makes that very easy, especially since they are constantly referencing issues many others may be experiencing. It gives fans someone and something to relate to, letting them know that they aren’t alone.\n\nI’ve listened to this band for eight years now, and rather than grow apart from the music, I’ve only grown with it. Their music teaches valuable life lessons, and it’s a fresh new sound every time.\n\nYou don’t have to take my word for it, you can just listen for yourself.\n\nLet me know what you think."
