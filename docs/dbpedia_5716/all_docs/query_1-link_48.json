        "text": "“Spider-Man 3” will be one of the biggest movies of 2007. But the producers of the megasequel, which grossed nearly $250 million domestically in the first 10 days of its release, didn’t rely on mainstream rock acts Nickelback or Evanescence to give their story its musical underpinnings.\n\nSnow Patrol’s “Signal Fire” is the soundtrack’s lead single, but after that mainstream entry is a heady slate of indie rock’s finest: the Walkmen, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Oohlas, Black Mountain, Wolfmother, Rogue Wave, Coconut Records, Sounds Under Radio and the Flaming Lips. This soundtrack’s mainstream nod to rock that is independent in nature furthers a trend music fans have noticed more and more the past five years.\n\nThe revolution known as indie rock – a subgenre emphasizing individual creative interests over commercial viability – has landed squarely in the mainstream. Bands that used to rock warehouse tours, playing to crowds of 20 or 30 people throughout the Midwest, are now in major films, primetime broadcast and cable television shows, and commercials for McDonald’s, Dell and Nissan.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s quite a revolution as much as it is an eventuality,” said Ben Gibbard, the singer-songwriter behind Death Cab for Cutie. “People don’t play rock ‘n’ roll on the radio anymore. But the people who grew up loving rock ‘n’ roll – the Beatles and Big Star – the kids 10 years older than us who loved R.E.M. and the Replacements, they didn’t stop liking music.\n\n“The mainstream culture ceased to make it a priority,” he said. “There had to be a breaking point where people were suddenly going to find out about all this music happening in the underground, and I guess that’s where we’re at.”\n\nJordan Tappis, president and owner of the Record Collection label and the executive producer of the “Spider-Man 3” soundtrack, said the move toward indie rock was not “a conscious decision … because it was the flavor of the moment. But I think (Sony) was more open-minded to doing it this way because of the commercial viability of bands like the Shins and Modest Mouse.”\n\nFrom basement to box office\n\nMuch has been made over the recent successes of Death Cab, the Shins, Modest Mouse and others. This slow rise started years ago as these bands first formed and began writing music in their basements. But the unintentional movement slapped everyone in the face in 2003-04 with the help of a couple of key media outlets.\n\n“It was definitely weird a few years ago when it no longer became strange to see your friends on television,” said Sub Pop tour publicist Joan Hiller, “or to be in Nordstrom looking for underpants and hearing your friends’ bands getting played.”\n\n“The O.C.,” the Fox teen soap that ended in February, helped make Death Cab a household name. Zach Braff’s film “Garden State” did the same for the Shins. Modest Mouse largely went the old-fashioned route by scoring one of 2004’s biggest hit singles with “Float On.”\n\nAnd while old media was helping these and other bands, it was new media that cemented their newfound home in the mainstream.\n\n“The Internet obviously is the big motivation for these changes, with more music accessible to more people,” said Amy Phillips, senior news editor at Pitchfork Media. “It’s now easier to hear these bands. You don’t have to know about the cool record store in town or the zine or get a mixtape from your friend. You can just hear about a band and go to their MySpace page, and boom, you hear them.”\n\nAlexandra Patsavas owns Chop Shop Music Supervision in Los Angeles and worked closely with “The O.C.” creator Josh Schwartz on the role music would play in the series, from the onscreen venue The Bait Shop to the six soundtrack CDs the show spawned.\n\n“The Internet has made every band a local band,” she said.\n\nIt helps that many indie bands are experienced players with multiple albums and countless tours under their belt by the time they rise to mainstream consciousness.\n\n“They do come to the mainstream market fully formed,” said the Record Collection’s Tappis. “Most of these bands had a long gestation period with independent labels where they put out two or three records … and they took their time to develop their songwriting.\n\n“Artists like Dylan and the Stones and Bruce Springsteen, their best records were two or three records into their career. These days, major labels don’t have the appetite to develop someone that far.”\n\nTuning out FM support\n\nThese bands are making great music, and that equates to impressive sales. While it’s long been considered notable for an indie band to sell more than 50,000 copies of a record, some contemporary indie bands are topping that without FM radio support. At the other end of the scale, rapper 50 Cent has sold upward of 7 million copies.\n\nFor Death Cab’s first four releases, the sales numbers currently hover between 99,693 (“We Have the Facts and We’re Voting Yes”) and 170,508 (“The Photo Album”). The band’s fifth and final release on indie label Barsuk, “Transatlanticism,” has sold 524,317 copies while Death Cab’s major label debut on Atlantic, “Plans,” has sold more than 873,000 copies.\n\nModest Mouse’s new “We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank” has moved only 291,248 copies. That record’s predecessor, “Good News for People Who Love Bad News,” has sold more than 1.5 million copies.\n\nThe best-selling record on Sub Pop’s indie rock-dominated roster since the recent exposure boom is the Postal Service’s “Give Up,” with 860,000 copies sold. The Postal Service shares something with Death Cab in that Gibbard is the lead singer for both groups.\n\n“It’s proven that if you put good culture in front of people, most likely they’re gonna get it,” Gibbard said. “The Shins are selling lots of records of a record that came out four years ago. James (Mercer) is an amazing songwriter, but a lot of stars aligned in the last couple of years in a way they haven’t before, and it’s benefited all of us.”\n\nThe Shins made headlines in late January when their latest, “Wincing the Night Away,” debuted at No.2 on the Billboard charts with more than 118,000 sales the first week of release. The album has gone on to sell 392,000 copies, and while that’s impressive, it doesn’t stand as tall as previous Shins outings, 2003’s “Chutes Too Narrow” (437,000) and 2001’s “Oh, Inverted World” (512,000).\n\nSo these bands have licensed their music for Outback Steakhouse commercials, and they’ve appeared on television shows such as “The O.C.” They’ve “changed your life” in films like “Garden State.” And unlike some of their predecessors, they’ve made a living doing what they love.\n\n“It was really weird dealing with the Gap,” Shins frontman James Mercer said of his experience with the corporate clothing giant for a 2002 ad. “It’s all in-house – they do their own ads – and they have their own music people. When I sent them my ideas, they immediately answered back, ‘We don’t like any of this.’ Two weeks later they actually liked the third one I sent them.\n\n“I have to admit, I did it for the money.”\n\nSelling out vs. selling CDs\n\nIt takes guts for indie rock musicians, who are supposed to be above commerce, to say they’re doing anything for the money. But there’s a difference between making FM-friendly music for the money and selling artistically minded music for money. While Mercer doesn’t like talking about it, neither does he regret doing it. Ditto for many of his peers.\n\n“I won’t lie – the money, of course, is nice,” said Jimmy LaValle of the Album Leaf. “But it’s also a way to reach out to a different audience. After ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ had aired ‘Writings on the Wall,’ the popularity of downloading that song went up dramatically. It was the top-downloaded song off that record, and that happened within two weeks of it being aired.”\n\nSometimes having your music heard is a bigger deal than the money. This is the case with the Oolahs, whose song “Small Parts” was plucked for the “Spider-Man 3” soundtrack.\n\n“I feel that it’s not really about the money,” said the Oolahs’ Ollie Stone. “It’s more about getting heard. I don’t know what’s so wrong with an indie band having their music heard and being spread around.”\n\nFor the Walkmen, appearing on “The O.C.” meant financial security – albeit with a little embarrassment.\n\n“It paid really well, and we, uhh, don’t exactly have a lot of bread,” said the Walkmen’s Hamilton Leithauser. “The record company people were thrilled that we’d be willing to do something that stupid. I guess we caught them by surprise when we said, ‘Sure.”‘\n\nFor Rogue Wave, licensing their music to the “Stubbs the Zombie” video game, “The O.C.” and films ranging from “Napoleon Dynamite” to\n\n“Spider-Man 3” meant opening doors.\n\n“It really just allowed us to be self-reliant, where we didn’t have to open for somebody, to go out and build our own following,” said Zach Rogue. “It’s not like we were famous.”\n\nWhile music fans are notoriously fickle, indie rock fans celebrate their snobbiness unabashedly. As one blogger snidely wrote upon first hearing Modest Mouse’s break-out record: “Indie kids, prepare to share your favorite band.” Some fans have reacted negatively to these bands’ newfound success.\n\n“Now you’re no longer the one kid in science class who knows about Grizzly Bear,” said Sub Pop’s Hiller. “Now there are three kids in science class who know them. It’s that that makes people (angry) that there was an M&Ms commercial or an ‘O.C.’ spot. Next thing you know, the cheerleaders know about Grizzly Bear.”\n\nBut this indie rock renaissance is going forward whether the kids like it or not.\n\n“My selfish goal from the start was to expose mainstream audiences to independent music,” said the Record Collection’s Tappis. “And one of the reasons we chose to go with bands like the Killers and Snow Patrol was to expose them to unsigned bands like Silence on the Radio.”\n\nPop music critic Ricardo Baca can be reached at 303-954-1394 or rbaca@denverpost.com.\n\nStaff writer John Wenzel can be reached at 303-954-1642 or jwenzel@denverpost.com.\n\nIndie rock milestones\n\nA look at some important moments in indie rock:\n\n1979: Sub Pop Records is born in Olympia, Wash., initially as a fanzine called Subterranean Pop.\n\n1981: Guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo hook up with bass player Kim Gordon and call themselves Sonic Youth.\n\n1984: Minneapolis post-punk band Hüsker Dü releases the “Zen Arcade” double LP, providing a creative blueprint for ambitious underground bands from the Replacements to the Pixies.\n\n1987: Former Dinosaur Jr. bassist Lou Barlow releases “Weed Forestin,” a lo-fi collection of home recordings, under the curious name Sentridoh (a percursor to Sebadoh).\n\n1989: Merge Records is formed in Chapel Hill, N.C.\n\n1991: Sebadoh releases the 7-inch single “Gimme Indie Rock!” The tongue-in-cheek title ironically helps cement the term in the underground-music community.\n\n1993: Liz Phair’s (left) seminal “Exile in Guyville,” a post-feminist response to the Rolling Stones’ “Exile on Main St.,” hits the shelves. That same year, Isaac Brock and two friends form Modest Mouse.\n\n1994: Guided by Voices releases “Bee Thousand,” a proudly messy, amateurish album of brilliant, ’60s-influenced melodies and surreal lyrics.\n\n1997: Death Cab for Cutie starts as a solo project for Ben Gibbard. That same year, the Shins are formed in New Mexico as a side project to frontman James Mercer’s other band, Flake.\n\n2003: “The O.C.” first airs, and Adam Brody is suddenly forever connected with Death Cab. The soundtrack was mostly indie rock. The Fox show runs through February 2007.\n\n2004: “Garden State” is released in theaters, and the Shins, the song “New Slang” and Natalie Portman in a pair of giant headphones expose moviegoers to a big dose of indie rock.\n\n2007: The Arcade Fire releases its second record on Merge, “The Neon Bible.”\n\nRICARDO BACA AND JOHN WENZEL\n\nIndie rock’s hall of fame\n\nA list of essential indie rock albums is something fans could bicker over for years, but here’s our list of a dozen records that help define the subgenre and its exciting history.\n\n“Zen Arcade,” Hüsker Dü: This 1984 double-LP concept album on SST changed the rules in the American underground.\n\n“Tim,” the Replacements: The Replacements were just making their transition to the majors with this release, which was a poetic melding of the hard-core and accessible.\n\n“Daydream Nation,” Sonic Youth: Two LPs, 14 songs and careening art rock made the ground shake in 1988.\n\n“You’re Living All Over Me,” Dinosaur Jr.: This primal, thrashy masterpiece was influenced by everything surrounding it, yet still maintained its originality.\n\n“III,” Sebadoh: You’ll often hear lo-fi thrown around while talking indie rock, and this classic is what they mean.\n\n“Slanted and Enchanted,” Pavement: Of all its records, this is where Pavement tapped the vein.\n\n“Bee Thousand,” Guided by Voices: It took a while for Bob Pollard to be heard outside of Ohio. But this record busted the state line and started something special.\n\n“Exile in Guyville,” Liz Phair: Most records with 18 songs are excessive. Not this one.\n\n“In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,” Neutral Milk Hotel: If you’re a fan of melodic rock music, quirky or not, this record demands to be part of your collection.\n\n“69 Love Songs,” Magnetic Fields: Stephin Merritt is a songwriter of the people, and this is his most impressive outing.\n\n“Kill the Moonlight,” Spoon: Song for song, one of the most consistent indie rock releases of all time.\n\n“Funeral,” the Arcade Fire: An exuberant instant classic that scored a 9.7 rating from the notoriously tough Pitchfork, this record is one of the greatest debuts in rock history.\n\n– Ricardo Baca and John Wenzel"
