Now you can sound like a Grammy-winning artist without breaking a sweat. 😎 Who needs years of practice when you have technology on your side? 🤷♂️ But hold on, folks! This feature is only available on YouTube Shorts, their answer to TikTok. 🤳 Looks like they're taking the \"copy and paste\" approach to originality. 🙄 YouTube claims it's all about creating deeper connections between artists, creators, and fans. 🤝 Sure, because nothing says \"deep connection\" like a computer-generated voice crooning about heartbreak and partying. Move over, Adele! 🎤🎶 And that's not all, my friends! YouTube is teaming up with Google DeepMind to create AI-generated music experiments. 🤯 Brace yourselves for a symphony of copyright infringement lawsuits! 🎵⚖️ Of course, some artists and record labels are raising concerns about the ethical and legal implications of using their voices without consent. 🎙️😡 But who needs consent when you can have a computer program steal someone's artistry? 🤷♀️ In the end, this AI tool is just another example of technology replacing human creativity. 🤖💔 Who needs real artists when you can have soulless algorithms churn out generic music? 😒 Are you excited about this AI music revolution or do you think it's a threat to real talent? Let us know in the comments! ⬇️ And don't forget to check out the full article for all the juicy details: 📰🔗 #AI #MusicRevolution #YouTubeShorts #TechNews #ArtificialIntelligence #MusicIndustry #TalentVsTechnology https://lnkd.in/eWRkzMgg\n\nCOOL TOOL ALERT: SunoAI!

The search engine starts with a large textbox that asks the user “What are you looking for?” But rather than returning a plain list of links, SearchGPT tries to organize and make sense of them. In one example from OpenAI, the search engine summarizes its findings on music festivals and then presents short descriptions of the events followed by an attribution link.\n\nHas anyone tried out Google's AI features called AITestKitchens? It's an AI project that they were working on which can be used for creating videos and music from prompts, and it's now open to the public but still in the testing phase. Right now, you have to join a waitlist for VideoFX, but there are other options available like MusicFX and ImageFX. 🎊 Google always does a great job with UI design, and I think it looks quite sleek. They make good use of white space. Anyway, you should definitely give it a try, especially the MusicFX – it even has its DJ mode! Amazingly, we can create music for personal or commercial projects, maybe not immediately, but certainly in the future. Could this help video editors save time when searching for sound effects or background music? Just a thought! 🤔 I'll share what I've created and the link, so you all can try it out too!

AI Song generates songs from text prompts with help from the large language model Bloom. Users can write out lyrics on the text field when making a post. TikTok will then recommend AI Song to add sounds to the post, and they can toggle the song’s genre. “It’s not technically an AI song generator — the name is likely to change and it is currently in testing at the moment,” Barney Hooper, spokesperson for TikTok said in an email to The Verge. “Any music used is from a pre-saved catalog created within the business. In essence, it pairs the lyrics with the pre-saved music, based on three genres: pop, hip-hop, and EDM.” Read more here: https://lnkd.in/dRvKa8VV"
