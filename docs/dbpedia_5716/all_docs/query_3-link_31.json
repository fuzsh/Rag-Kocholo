City staff members from various departments, including police and community services, work with these eight groups to provide facts and guidance and address issues as necessary.\n\nAny person who lives or owns property in an NPC area may attend meetings, which are open to the public. Each group generally meets monthly but, by charter, meets at least six times per calendar year. Members are appointed by the City Commission, on the recommendation of the NPC chairperson.\n\nEach group's roles and responsibilities include:\n\nGenerating comments and/or recommendations to help the City Commission better understand issues impacting neighborhoods.\n\nProviding informal input and feedback to attending commissioners and/or city staff on citywide initiatives (street improvements, city service improvements, communications, and more).\n\nSharing city proposals with potential neighborhood impacts with NPC members and participating residents.\n\nGenerating strategies for neighborhood improvements.\n\nAlong with attendance, factual guidance, and addressing of issues, city staff also provide administrative support, including mailing of meeting agendas, generating Beautiful Battle Creek awards, and overseeing compliance with the NPC charter, Open Meetings Act, and bylaws.\n\nTo subscribe to notifications about NPC meetings and agenda availability on our Notify Me webpage, and view the citywide calendar at this link."
