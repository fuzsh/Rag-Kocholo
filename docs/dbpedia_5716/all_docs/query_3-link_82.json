        "text": "Neighborhood Councils (NC or neighborhoods) are independent organizations made up residents who live within a certain boundary that meet to maintain and improve the quality of life in Spokane, increase resident participation in local decision-making, and form an effective partnership between the City and neighborhood residents. There are 29 NCs within three Districts recognized by the City of Spokane. The Districts are in northeast Spokane, northwest Spokane and south Spokane. Each District is represented by two City Council Members. More information about City Council can be found on their website.\n\nThe Neighborhood Council is a volunteer board made up of a Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, Treasurer and representative to the Community Assembly, and other positions, depending on the neighborhood’s needs. Neighborhoods hold regular meetings (monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly) that are open to any person 16 years of age or older who resides, runs a business, or owns property within the boundaries of a neighborhood.\n\nJoin Your Neighborhood Council\n\nInterested in joining your Neighborhood Council?
