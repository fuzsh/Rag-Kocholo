        "text": "Although they are a young group of guys (from what I’ve been able to find out) their music speaks of experiences with young love, like the catchy tune Sweater Weather, and even disdain of a personal home life, such as, Female Robbery.\n\nThe Neighbourhood – Female Robbery\n\nBut what I find most spectacular about this band is the way they’ve taken an alternative rock genre, added deep beats, and choruses that no one at concerts and shows will be able to resist to sing out loud. All the while adding the perfect combination of the lead singer’s voice, who is finely tuned for the band’s type style of music. Their influence in appearance may fall into the Hollywood retro style but their sound, I believe, is progressive enough to make them chart toppers on both the alternative, indie rock, and even pop charts.\n\nWhether you are in the mood for something catchy, like their most recent single Sweater Weather, which is currently climbing the charts and can be heard on almost any alternative station, or whether you are looking for something sultry, like the sexy tune A Little Death; The Neighbourhood has much to offer for all types of music fans.\n\nThe Neighbourhood – Sweater Weather\n\nThe Neighbourhood’s EPs’ I’m Sorry… and Thank You, are available to buy now. Be sure to check out their debut album I Love You which will be available on April 23, 2013 in the United States. They are currently on tour, click The Neighbourhood on tour to see if they’ll be coming to a city near you!\n\nFollow The Neighbourhood on Twitter and Like The Neighbourhood on Facebook!\n\n—\n\nUpdated photography provided by:"
