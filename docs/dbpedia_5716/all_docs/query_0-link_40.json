        "text": "Hardcore’s growing popularity in the mainstream is evident. With Knocked Loose going viral, the genre has introduced a new avenue for some artists to explore. Que: The Neighbourhood’s vocalist Jesse Rutherford and his new band, Valley Girl.\n\nThe new group has released a four-song demo on YouTube simply titled “Demo” that runs a little over 10 minutes. The songs sound similar to a ramped-up version of bands such as Turnstile that add indie spice to the mix with a sharpened edge to round out the finished piece. Some of the tracks run longer than the shorter, traditional songs we know in the hardcore world. However, with more time to work with longer songs, it creates a more divisive sound that gives listeners a taste of what Rutherford can do on the opposite end of the alternative spectrum.\n\nFor the release, it credits that the demo was produced by Taylor Young and features drums from Colin Young, who’s also a co-host of the “HardLore” podcast. But the former beau of pop star Billie Eilish is causing some controversy in the hardcore scene with the release. However, the lead singer of Cosmic Joke defended Rutherford’s project in a Twitter post.\n\nRead more: Trophy Eyes Announce European Headline Tour This Spring\n\nHe says that the “Sweater Weather” vocalist has been attending similar shows with him for the past 15 years and that Valley Girl announced their show quietly and anonymously to offset any fans of his indie-rock music. “They opened a 6 band bill and supported every other act. At the end of the day I just wanted to have my friends play our show, and I’m glad I did. They belong here.”"
