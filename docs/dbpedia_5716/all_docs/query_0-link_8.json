        "text": "The NBHD (The neighbourhood) is an American band formed in California ,2011. The band is composed of vocalist Jesse Rutherford, guitarists Jeremy Freedman and Zach Abels, bassist Mikey Margott, and drummer Brandon Alexander Fried.\n\nTheir style mix moody, ’90s-style alt-rock with hip-hop and electronic flourishes, California’s the Neighbourhood broke through with their debut single, “Sweater Weather.” The track, which was included on the group’s 2012 I’m Sorry… EP, first gained momentum online before hitting number one on Billboard’s alternative chart and going platinum. The band has continued to explore a similarly atmospheric, cross-pollinated blend of sounds, even digging into synth-heavy pop on 2018’s ."
