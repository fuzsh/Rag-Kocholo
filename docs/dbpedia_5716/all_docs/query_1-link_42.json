        "text": "When you come up in the DIY rock and roll underground, the community that goes with the music is everything. Unlike most sub-genres of humanity, two punk rockers and a guy in a Slayer shirt will typically find something to talk about over a cheap PBR. The places that house those shared interests are important. These spots are somewhere for the weirdos to hang out, to hear their weird bands, and champion their outsider passions, are crucial for people to feel like they belong somewhere. To hoist drinks in their air in both celebration and sadness. There is often more than people drinking together in a bar. Instead, it’s the social glue that keeps people’s hearts and minds together, too. People like us, we bond over a Crass tape, or get excited about those annual Motorhead parties. Our culture of rock and roll is a brick of our identity and when you’re the kid with the Black Flag sticker on your skateboard who becomes the adult with the son in a Stooges shirt, you take shit personally when it comes to the things that helped craft your identity.\n\nThat’s why losing The Lost Well sucks so hard.\n\nRead More\n\nTaking the hip-hop approach by dropping singles one at a time, Tied Up recently gave us their newest, “Anyway You Like,” on the heels of their prior single, “Gun.” Both are wicked glimpses into what the band will give us moving forward, which says a metric fuck ton, considering they only have two tracks out for public consumption. And those two tracks do not play. This is the rock and roll you want;\n\nRead More\n\nWhen we were kids playing in rock and roll bands, we always dreamed of coming up with the cash to record at Electrical Audio. There were tiers of cost – one to get into the door, one to book either day or night sessions, some with junior engineers, and then, if you could swing it, to record with Steve Albini. For us, just the idea of being in the same room with those who’d recorded the Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Nirvana? Insane. We were in hardcore and punk bands; we weren’t trying to be the noise he was so aligned with; we just wanted to be able to say the guy who made “Scentless Apprentice” sound so raw did it on our heavy chugged nonsense.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Two-Step Inn people are getting this thing right. Last year, being the first kick-off event, there were a few holes in the ship regarding accessibility and general needs being met, but this year, they’ve kicked up everything from just a few notches to feet, including lockers to water stations and tents for drug testing. Last year, I was lucky enough to catch both days. This year, I managed to sneak into the fest only on Sunday, April 21 but what I saw was worth the risk of getting towed.\n\nRead More\n\nSome people hate SXSW. But just the same, another contingency finds magic within the chaos. The festival is draining; it takes a lot out of the festival goer, the musicians, and the service industry staff slinging the tacos, cleaning up the puke, and loading up the plastic cups full of whatever poison gets the job done. Standing late Sunday night at Empire Control Room at the crossroads of that perfect place of drunk and happy, I consistently remain in the latter regarding where SXSW lives within my heart.\n\nRead More"
