        "text": "Olivia Jazwick, Contributing Writer\n\nMusic and chatter echoed throughout the streets of Richmond’s Woodland Heights neighborhood as people gathered for local music and the company of their neighbors on Sept. 24 for the Tiny Porch Concerts.\n\nMusicians and local food vendors spread throughout several blocks of the neighborhood for the event. The neighborhood felt inspired by NPR’s Tiny Desk Concerts, and created their own version, according to Emily McMillen, one of the founding volunteers.\n\nThe neighborhood began organizing this event in April, and has previously hosted the event in June, July and August, McMillen said.\n\nMcMillen describes the group as a “grassroots neighborhood community” that wanted to provide a low-stakes way to get to know their neighbors and build community, McMillen said.\n\n“We know neighborhoods are stronger when you know the people who live around you,” McMillen said.\n\nThey initially planned for only a few small events, but word spread, and Richmonders came running to show their support, McMillen said.\n\n“We really thought we would just do June, July, August, but it got a lot bigger,” McMillen said. “The neighborhood came out in a really exciting way.”\n\nTiny Porch Concerts features neighborhood musicians, like the Blue Orpheus Orchestra and Sean Castleberry, and local Richmond bands — such as Bobby Joe Small who have noticed the initiative and wanted to participate, McMillen said. All the musicians involved are volunteers.\n\nMany of the musicians who performed on Sunday night, such as “folksy” singer-songwriter Elle Christine, heard about the event through a neighbor in the community, Christine said.\n\n“I love walking around and hearing the music,” Christine said. “It’s so well organized with the way they place all these different musicians that are very unique stylistically.”\n\nChristine is originally from Maryland and feels impressed by Richmond’s art scene, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic began subsiding, she said.\n\n“What I see here, is just such a blossoming of arts and creativity, and that’s something that Richmond’s really been pushing forward,” Christine said.\n\nChristine said she feels these kinds of events are important for small artists to gain exposure and build connections.\n\n“The music community here is actually fairly tight-knit and collaborative,” Christine said. “I know a lot of people socially through the scene and they’ve always been so warm and welcoming as a community which is not always the case with music.”\n\nTiny Porch Concerts is a coming together of different minds, backgrounds and personalities, Christine said. It’s all about coming out and enjoying each other’s company, the artistic works of the community and building a sense of togetherness, she said.\n\nAttendees Jenny Dunn and Maggie McVicar have been living in the Woodland Heights area for the past few years and love coming out to these events, they said.\n\nThey had come out to some of the past Tiny Porch Concerts and were continually impressed by the level of engagement and community their neighborhood was presenting, Dunn said.\n\n“It’s kind of like a ‘Porchella,’” Dunn said. “It’s great that it happens regularly and I’m able to walk to it.”\n\nMcVicar said the concerts are organic and natural because the people there are genuinely warm and welcoming.\n\n“This is our neighborhood at its best,” McVicar said.\n\nMcVicar’s experience at Tiny Porch Concerts provided her with a deeper connection and sense of community with her neighbors, she said.\n\nShe encourages people to come to the next Tiny Porch Concerts and bring their lawn chairs, people-watch and listen to some “cool” music, McVicar said.\n\nThe neighborhood will host another Tiny Porch Concert on Oct. 29."
