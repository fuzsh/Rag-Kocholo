        "text": "Are you trying to recruit new elected leadership to your Neighborhood Association? The roles and assigned responsibilities of each board member should be clearly defined within your association's bylaws. The bylaws should also detail your association’s voting procedure, how roles are determined, and how long the terms should be for each elected position.\n\nThough roles and duties may vary from association to association, the most common are:\n\nPresident:\n\nSet and finalize meeting agenda. Facilitate meetings. Can act as main contact for association. Follow processes and procedures outlined in bylaws. Delegate and supervise officer and member responsibilities. Ensure meetings adhere to agenda timelines. Maintain fairness and respectful behavior of meeting attendees.\n\nVice-President:\n\nServes as an alternate to the President. Assist with planning meetings. Help maintain accurate records. Respond to mail and inquiries. Attend other meetings as needed.\n\nSecretary:\n\nMaintain clear and accurate meeting documentation such as minutes, attendance sheets, sign-in forms, and other relevant documentation. Ensure bylaws are maintained. Maintain updated roster of members. Maintain records of association’s agreed-upon plans.\n\nTreasurer:\n\nManage and track association finances. Prepare budget reports. Report on fiscal issues at meeting. Balance bank statements. Maintain association’s tax-exempt status if necessary. File tax returns as needed.\n\nOther elected roles and responsibilities can include:\n\nMembership Representative:\n\nPromote association membership at external events. Greet attendees at association meetings and events. Explain meeting sign-in, membership and communication processes. Explain association dues process as needed. Follow up with new members and attendees.\n\nLand Use Representative:\n\nReceive land use reviews and provide a summary report of notifications at monthly meetings, follow association’s procedure on developing a response to land use reviews, draft and send association’s response to land use reviews, represent the neighborhood at the coalition’s Land Use Committee and City Land Use meetings.\n\nPublic Safety Representative:\n\nReceive any crime reports from Albuquerque Police Department (APD) as needed, report on crime issues to association, act as liaison between APD and association.\n\nCommunication Representative:\n\nMaintain association communication channels. Oversee association communication projects such as newsletters, websites, social media, and e-mail lists. Assist with outreach and promotion of association events, activities and efforts.\n\nCoalition Representative:\n\nRepresent association at coalition meetings. Serve as liaison between association and coalition. Maintain communication between association and coalition on pertinent issues, events and activities.\n\nDepending on your association’s needs and bylaws, there can be other elected board positions as needed. If your association uses Robert’s Rules of Order, the recommended structure of a board has a president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer, but this is not required. Each board is different and may have different structures.\n\nThe Office of Neighborhood Coordination (ONC) recommends reviewing and updating your bylaws every five-10 years to ensure all information, including board members, responsibilities, and election processes, are accurate and reflect the evolving needs of your neighborhood."
