        "text": "Post by narp on\n\nFinally a radio push, probably only because this is blowing up on streaming. I have no idea why they were so apprehensive to push anything from this album when it came out because they probably could’ve gotten at least one hit from it.\n\nPost by macattack on\n\nThis is a really good song for Audacy to boost, and the first time they have pushed an artist who had a previous smash on the format in a long while.\n\nI'm shocked a song with this many hooks and a silky smooth bass line was relegated to a bonus track on a deluxe version of the album. Almost as shocking that it took Columbia this long to push this gem when it's been clear this was a hit since March.\n\nThis could be the band's biggest hit since \"Sweater Weather\". It has that much potential. I could see Hot AC and pop loving this as much as Alternative - and I think Alternative is going to love this one a lot.\n\nPost by wheatsquares33 on\n\nYeah this does sound like quite a big pop hit, actually. I liked Lost in Translation from this new project too, even if it doesn't sound quite as \"of its time\" as this does. That said, I do like this one too. Weird comparison maybe, but kinda sounds like Justice-era Justin Bieber meets New Abnormal-era Strokes? I'll be rooting for this one, it's pretty cool\n\nPost by American Idiot on\n\nI haven't liked much by The Neighbourhood since their first album. I just don't find them very interesting unfortunately. Although, \"Sweater Weather\" I think find to be a banger.\n\nThis song feels like they tried to become The Strokes. Unfortunately for them, they're not even close to that. The vocals are super sleepy for me and while it's probably better than much of what I've heard from them over the last five or six years, I won't care much to come back to this one.\n\nPost by Doc Indie Party Rock on\n\nthis is one is starting to grow on me. catchy and melodic, but what the hell is the music video about? can someone explain it? At first I thought he was one of them people that paint themselves silver and act like a statue, but than he goes to houses and gives people a silver coin. Is that like his calling card like in case they want to contract him as a statue man. It's confusing as hell? and what about the girl? How does she fit in all of this? She looks interested in him, and he leaves her behind. What a dweeb.\n\nPost by Lordef†ones on\n\nthis is one is starting to grow on me. catchy and melodic, but what the hell is the music video about? can someone explain it?

What a dweeb.\n\nHe is performing as his persona Chip Chrome and visiting houses of famous people (Jaden, Lana, Mac DeMarco etc) in a bid to become a star, only for him to realize at the end that he's a star in his own right."
