        "text": "Post by dm2081 on\n\nThis actually isn't bad, much better than the lead single. Not sure how much momentum they have right now, but we will see.\n\nPost by maine on\n\nI like this. I listened to the album and I thought it was overall good, but it didn't have any songs that screamed single material to me. Who knows how they'll do considering \"R.I.P. 2 My Youth\" flopped pretty badly.\n\nPost by Superundercover on\n\nWell I'm still charting \"R.I.P. 2 My Youth\" and it should be going to #1 in a few weeks.\n\nPost by Devin on\n\nThis actually isn't bad, much better than the lead single. Not sure how much momentum they have right now, but we will see.\n\nWell the label sure is moving quickly on a second single, so I'm guessing they'll be pushing this one moderately hard. I expect it to out-peak \"R.I.P. 2 My Youth.\"\n\nPost by Cody on\n\nTo be completely frank I could picture a boy band doing this...that doesn't make it a bad song though.\n\nI could picture a boy band singing \"Hit The Ground\"\n\nPost by Pipa on\n\nTo be completely frank I could picture a boy band doing this...that doesn't make it a bad song though.\n\nI could picture a boy band singing \"Hit The Ground\"\n\nI could picture a boy band singing the Stuck E---no I can't, that's completely unforgivable.\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\n-- 7 THE NEIGHBOURHOOD\n\nWIPED OUT!\n\nCOLUMBIA 22,931 --\n\nAt least they got a top 10 on the pure album sales chart.\n\nPost by Web on\n\nGave this a first listen, and I'm not a fan. R.I.P. 2 My Youth is a solid track imo but this is kind of whiny and forgettable. Also lyrics have never been this band's strong suit but they stuck out in a bad way here.\n\nThough I am listening to the album now, and nothing has stuck out as a better single choice yet. (maybe The Beach) Nope, the only song anywhere close to good so far is Greetings From Califournia). I think this album is just too pretentious for me, it's like The Neighbourhood met Lana Del Rey on the way to the studio and let her drown out the record with insufferable blandness.\n\nPost by Lordef†ones on\n\nI don't know about y'all but I absolutely love the album. It's had me vibing for awhile. Maybe it's cause I live on the beach and it has that gothic beach vibe to it that fits my setting it. It's super chill and emotionally resonant.\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nAlternative flopping this is a disgrace. Easily my favourite Craig David song yet.\n\nI don't think it's done yet.... give it time.\n\nPost by Lordef†ones on\n\nSweater Weather: A-\n\nAfraid: B+\n\nLet It Go: A-\n\nR.I.P. 2 My Youth: A+\n\nCry Baby: A-\n\nVery sad to see them flop. I loved their new album.\n\nPost by bkeysfan on\n\nThe problem with them. They're not good enough for pop and they don't sound alternative at all. I don't mind them but I sort of had to accept that Indy rock is considered alternative now.\n\nPost by Green Baron on\n\nI sort of had to accept that Indy rock is considered alternative now.\n\nHasn't it always though?\n\nPost by bkeysfan on\n\nWell, I guess I should have said Indy pop.\n\nPandora is playing this song though on the main station, so it might get people to want to hear it more(on actual radio stations that count toward mediabase)."
