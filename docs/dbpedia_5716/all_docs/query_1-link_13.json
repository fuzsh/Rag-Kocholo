        "text": "I remember the first time someone looked me dead in the eyes and said, “You’re so indie…” It felt like an insult. “Um, cool?” I responded. What I really wanted to say was; “Okay! Thank you so much! You’re annoying!” As far as I knew, being labeled “indie” was a good thing. However, comments like those got me thinking of the real questions: Where did the term “indie” even come from? And what exactly does it mean?\n\nUnfortunately, giving a straight-up answer is impossible because “indie” seemingly stems from an amalgamation of different origins, dependent on music, movies, pop culture, and fashion. As we all know, indie may be the aesthetic of teenage girls who put vines on their walls as decoration, or a category where we place the people who listen to The Smiths, or lately, The Backseat Lovers (I’m guilty of this one). And while society may be a tad tired of the Doc Martens-wearing, alternative music listeners, I disagree!\n\nBy definition, “indie” is essentially what is unaffiliated; something that cannot be categorized, it stands on its own. After a little deep dive, it’s come to my attention that this subculture truly began with the music industry.\n\nWe have the United Kingdom to thank for this societal development; in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, a movement called “new wave'' emerged. Imagine “dad rock” but make it way cooler, more… avant-garde. This was the time to be alive! Iconic rock bands were releasing music, such as Tears for Fears (as in “Everybody Wants to Rule The World”), New Order (who famously made “Blue Monday”), and Blondie (known for hits like “Call Me”), to name a few. All of this began with music labeled as “independent.” At the time, this burgeoning genre’s tracks and artists couldn't be placed into a pre-existing box. They were bringing sounds that had never been heard before, and absolutely ruled the underground scene – at least, that’s what my dad says (shoutout Jose!). Naturally, this musical explosion trickled into other aspects of society.\n\nA fashion style that emerged before indie was even called indie was “twee” fashion. These are some of the original thrifters and vintage kids, who we have to thank for their influence and non-conformity. They wore Peter Pan collars, Mary Janes, and tights, all of which would be known today as Zooey Deschanel’s looks in New Girl. These people aligned with the counterculture and held their own beliefs pertaining to the British government, which is pretty dang cool.\n\nAs cyclical and derivative as music, fashion, and culture are, not every genre that is revived is brought back the same way as before. For example, some of the subgenres within indie culture that have since developed used new wave and twee styles as a jumping-off point. One subculture that’s received some recent attention – especially if you’ve seen Skins (2007-2013) or Saltburn (2023) – indie sleaze might be on your radar. This is predicted to be a huge craze this year, thanks to early 2000s British dance hall music popularized again by Saltburn and the indie sleaze looks we’ve seen on the streets. Messy and moody makeup is in the game again, alongside a dance beat and rock sound reminiscent of the early 2000s and 2010s. Say goodbye to your “clean girl” slick-backs and hello to authentic effortless hairstyles. In 2024, I want to see sparkles, sass, and so much dark eye makeup it almost hurts. Maybe even Tumblr will make a comeback…\n\nAside from this subgenre, it seems nowadays you can place the word indie in front of anything: There’s indie pop, indie rock, indietronica (a music genre that sounds like a dinosaur name), and more! It’s amazing to see how the subculture has developed, but this makes it difficult to even identify which subgenres are which anymore; it truly is an umbrella term for various avenues.\n\nIronically, the most recent iteration of indie music and style is the newer aesthetic we’re familiar with, which became popular pre-pandemic. Musical artists such as Clairo (“Pretty Girl”), Wallows (“Are You Bored Yet?”), Rex Orange County (“Best Friend”), and Billie Eilish (“Ocean Eyes”) all took the music scene by storm and became staples on the indie community’s playlists. Alongside thrifted looks with baggy cargo pants, graphic tees, and the most eclectic jewelry on the market became absolute essentials.\n\nOn a similar note, indie films have just as much influence as the music and fashion realms. Coming-of-age stories such as Perks of Being A Wallflower (2012) and Lady Bird (2017) continue to resonate with indie audiences, with narratives that highlight teens and young adults going on journeys to fit into society and eventually accept their uniqueness.\n\nI think it's wonderful to see how fashion, music, culture, and stories can work together to create safe spaces where people feel free to express themselves. That’s what being “indie” is: expressing yourself without restraint. While indie may not be as “underground” as before, it doesn’t mean that the label is any less valuable. It just means more people are authentically being themselves – and that’s a win. Go thank the nearest British person to you and be as indie as you can be.\n\nStrike Out,\n\nWriter: Dani Hernandez\n\nEditor: Isabel Wilder\n\nTallahassee"
