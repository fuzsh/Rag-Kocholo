        "text": "Some of the best bands are those comprised of people who have known each other for ages and ages – Vigilantes is a case and point. With over 20 years of friendship, Curly (vocals, guitars and keys), Ryan (guitar), Alex (bass and keys) and Joe (drums and keys) came together to create this unique UK-based band. Pumping American sonic styles with classic British tones, Vigilantes have been described by radio presenters as “powerful indie rock” (Amazing Radio), “very exciting” (BBC Radio Wales) and being able to “blow your socks off live” (BBC Radio 6). The latest addition to their well-received discography is The Neighbourhood.\n\nA collaborative effort between musicians/producers/engineers Bob Cooper, Tom Milner, Al Groves and Vigilantes, The Neighbourhood is the band’s second EP in the past two years. Hot on the heels of their single ‘Tigerwall’, the five-track release sprinkles tinges of alternative rock and pop atop their British-influenced indie-rock sound. Potentially a melding of Queens of the Stone Age, The Strokes and Arctic Monkeys, Vigilantes has a hard-hitting sound; however, while there are comparisons, Vigilantes’ music has a distinctiveness that is purely Vigilantes.\n\nOpening with the EP’s title track, the lads immediately showcase their versatility as a group. A rock-inspired song, there is a gruff edginess to ‘The Neighbourhood’, but an intriguing pop sliver woven into the melody. Dynamic guitars crescendo into catchy choruses as the drums pound in the background with soothing keys – all creating a sonic force of nature. I suppose it is apt considering the track seems to explore the grittiness of reality in its poetic lyricism.\n\nAs I mentioned, Vigilantes is a versatile group, and this innovation is immediately noted with the transition to old-school pop meets indie-rock sound in ‘Better Man’. Tossing me back to the 1980s, there is a soothing flow to the track that effortlessly intoxicates any listener. More nostalgic tones are heard in ‘Secret’ and ‘Tigerwall’; however, the lads highlight a connection with contemporary audiences in the alternative rock song ‘Drawing Auras’. As I said, it’s a sound that is distinctly Vigilantes.\n\nNostalgic and familiar, but fresh and invigorating. Sincere and sentimental, but aggressively desperate. Chaotic but with a sense of sophisticated elegance. Vigilantes’ new EP is a mishmash of emotions and experiences, but something you will certainly enjoy!\n\nFor more from Vigilantes check out their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Spotify.\n\nThis artist was discovered via Musosoup #sustainablecurator"
