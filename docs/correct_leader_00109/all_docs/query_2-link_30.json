        "text": "On Aug. 30, 2013, Foreign Minister Wang Yi held telephone talks with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius of France on the situation in Syria.\n\nWang Yi reaffirmed China's principled position of resolutely opposing the use of chemical weapons. He stressed the need to support UN inspectors in facilitating their independent, just, objective and professional investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. It is to be determined not only whether chemical weapons have been used in Syria but who have used them. And establishing the facts is the prerequisite and conditions for taking any actions.\n\nWang Yi stressed that all parties need to adopt a cautious attitude responsible to history toward the major issue concerning war and peace.\n\nFabius expressed that France holds that necessary responses should be made to the use of chemical weapons. The UN needs to accelerate the investigation process. The political resolution of the Syria issue remains the ultimate way out."
