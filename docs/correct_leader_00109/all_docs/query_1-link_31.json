        "text": "On February 21, 2014, President Xi Jinping met with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius at the Great Hall of the People.\n\nFabius conveyed President Francois Hollande's warm regards to President Xi Jinping. He said that President Hollande is willing to maintain close exchanges with President Xi Jinping and welcomes him to visit France recently. President Hollande believes that the visit will achieve a full success, deepen the friendship and promote the cooperation.\n\nXi Jinping asked Fabius to convey his best wishes to President Hollande. He said that he attaches great importance to China-France relations and is looking forward to meeting President Hollande again in the near future.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping said that the year 2014 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of China-France diplomatic relationship and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of comprehensive strategic partnership between China and France. Fifty years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong and General Charles de Gaulle jointly made the strategic decision of establishing the diplomatic relationship between China and France. This is of great wisdom, laying a solid foundation for the friendly cooperation between the two countries and making the China-France relations maintain at the forefront of the relations between China and the West. Last year when President Hollande visited China, he came to an agreement with President Hollande to hold a grand commemoration for the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and France. Both sides should sum up the successful experience and development law of the relationship between the two countries, inherit the past and break the new ground for the future, so as to promote a greater development of China-France relations in the new era. Both sides should strengthen the strategic communication and enhance the stability of the relations between the two countries. The two sides should advance practical cooperation and people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and constantly enrich the connotation of the bilateral relations. Both sides should strengthen the coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs, jointly cope with the global challenges and maintain the world peace and stability.\n\nFabius said that the establishment of the France-China relationship fifty years ago embodies the foresight and sagacity of the two countries and it deserves a great celebration and a complete summarization. Currently, France and China enjoy a good relationship and the two countries share common views on many major issues. The French side appreciates the significant role China plays in the international community, and is willing to work with the Chinese side to face the future, improve political mutual trust, expand the cooperation in such fields as economy and trade, science and technology, humanities and climate change, intensify the communication and coordination in international affairs, and promote the constant development of the France-China relationship."
