        "text": "On April 12, 2013, President Xi Jinping met with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius at the Great Hall of the People.\n\nAs nations with significant influence, China and France share the same views on many major issues and bilateral friendship has a profound basis, Xi said. As next year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries, both sides should continue to uphold the pioneering spirit, deepen strategic mutual trust, strengthen coordination and cooperation on bilateral affairs and international issues and make continuous efforts to enrich the content of Sino-French new-type comprehensive strategic partnership. Xi expressed his belief that the development of China-France relations benefits not only the two nations and the two peoples, but is also conducive to constructing new patterns for developed nations to work with emerging markets and developing nations, boosting China-European Union relations and making progress in the multi-polarization and democratization of the international relations. Xi said the Chinese side attaches great importance to French president Francois Hollande's upcoming visit, and that he is expecting to exchange views with his counterpart on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern. Xi said he expects Hollande's visit will help promote mutual understanding, increase consensus, expand cooperation and set the direction for the long-term development of China-France relations.\n\nFabius said China and France both value independence in dealing with foreign affairs, and both are committed to pushing for world peace, stability and development. The world needs France and China to enhance cooperation, said Fabius. Fabius said President Hollande will be the first head of state from the Western major countries to visit China after the new Chinese leadership took office, adding this has fully showcased France's commitment to developing its ties with China. He believed this visit will inject new impetus to the development of Sino-French relations."
