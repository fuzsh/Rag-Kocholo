Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will have talks with him. The two sides will exchange in-depth views on China-France relations, China-EU relations and international and regional issues of common interest. We hope this visit will step up their political mutual trust and practical cooperation, enhance their communication and coordination in international affairs and boost the sound and steady development of China-France comprehensive strategic partnership."
