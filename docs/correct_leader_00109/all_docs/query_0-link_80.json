        "text": "In 1958, the Fifth Republic was established in France. General Charles de Gaulle, back in office, pursued an independent foreign policy and attached greater importance to enhancing relations with China.\n\nIn 1963, former French prime minister Edgar Faure briefed President de Gaulle about his visit to China, describing how Chairman Mao welcomed him with the words: \"You arrive on time\".\n\nThree months later, on 27 January 1964, China and France issued a joint communiqu√©, announcing the establishment of diplomatic relations. It also marked the first major Western country recognizing the People's Republic of China since 1950. It was an important step because of the significant light it shed not only on Sino-French relations but on the wider dynamics in Sino-European relations during the decisive period in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFrance and China, while standing firm by their principles, showed flexibility in the negotiations to accommodate as much as they could the concerns of the other side. Both secured the diplomatic relations with a practical and forthcoming approach, setting a fine example of the art of negotiation in the history of diplomacy.\n\n2024 marks the 60th anniversary of France's recognition of the People's Republic of China, making it an opportunity for the two countries to communicate their cooperation and friendship. It is also the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism.\n\nAs a student in 1999, I recall witnessing the then Chinese president Jiang Zemin walking down the streets of Lyon city, through the old quarters of Saint-Jean, with then French president Jacques Chirac. France and China have a long record of understanding and consideration. We share a mutual respect that has grown over the years.\n\nLast year, on his first visit to Guangzhou, I had the chance to visit Shamian island with French President Emmanuel Macron and Sylvain Fourriere, our consul general in South China. We talked about Lingnan culture, Guangdong province and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, and also about the crucial functions and missions being played by our civil institutions such as the French Chamber of Commerce in China, Business France and Alliance Francaise that are always trying to build bridges and relationship between the two cultures.\n\nToday, in this post-pandemic era, we can see the first warning signs of a new global order. So what is the status of the relationship and cooperation between France and China?\n\nThis anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties is taking place against the backdrop of an incredibly special and unstable context, but France has been continuously trying to have a comprehensive and consistent long-term vision about China. French-Chinese cooperation exists in many important fields where France excels. Other than in luxury goods and cosmetics, scientific and technological cooperation between France and China have been a cornerstone of the relationship. From aerospace and the nuclear civil industry to renewable energy, the two countries have made significant strides in joint research and development in fields such as education, academic research, pharmaceuticals, biotech and agriculture.\n\nThe next step in France-China cooperation should be in new emerging technologies such as computational neurocognitive sciences, artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics and knowledge management. France is developing interesting \"research laboratories of excellence\", specializing in breakthrough innovation and exploring avenues such as adjacent innovation and radical innovation. France and China can pool their resources to tackle global challenges, deepen cooperation and open up the future.\n\nThey are engaged in the sectors of renewable energies, biodiversity cooperation and maritime conservation. Both countries are committed to pursuing a prominent level of dialogue about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2030 and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, maintaining a genuine dialogue that differs from others.\n\nChina and France have this ability to inspire others, to communicate and spread new narratives, and new collaborative innovation can encourage the global community to aspire for a future marked by cohesiveness.\n\nSeizing the occasion presented by the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between France and China, China is willing to reinforce dialogue, deepen and expand cooperation, and push bilateral economic and trade relations to a new level. France is also willing to boost communication with China to inject new momentum into France-China economic and trade cooperation. In an interview with Xinhua News two months ago, former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius said that China and France are both committed to independence as well as multilateralism and peace. \"We do not want a bloc policy, with the risks of conflicts that this entails,\" he said.\n\nRecently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed the same ideas, that China and France should strengthen strategic coordination and deepen cooperation to contribute to global peace and stability. He made the remarks during his meeting with Macron in Paris, saying that the two heads of state have established a strong mutual trust and a sincere friendship, and guided the development of bilateral strategic cooperation, exerting a profound and positive influence on the world.\n\nPresident Macron and President Xi Jinping are meeting again in Paris to celebrate and to open up a new page of China-France friendly relations. In these complicated times and challenging periods, let us not focus on economic hostility, but rather on cooperation and common dialogue. China should better understand France's leading role in the European Union, its influence among emerging countries, and its positive role in advancing multilateralism and cultural diversity. As for France, it needs to be more inclusive toward China's development and path to modernization.\n\nIt is time for the whole world to adopt symbiotic cooperation and technological innovation rather than succumb to misguided isolationism and disruptive protectionism. Of late, the focus of global discussions reflects a multifaceted methodology that intertwines economic diplomacy, strategic alliances and a concerted push toward sustainable development. During this period of turbulence and transformation, China and France are pushing for the implementation of initiatives to benefit all.\n\nProgress and advancements in technology have catalyzed a shift in the focus of strategic competition between major powers. New mechanisms are highly needed, and France and China can be even more committed to building a more innovation-driven development architecture, a more inclusive international order, while striving for peace and development. Currently, there is a lack of universally accepted and binding international rules in emerging technologies, to build an innovative technology governance mechanism featuring more cooperation, stimulating the potential of targeted breakthrough innovation.\n\n\"The mutual openness of our two nations is indispensable,\" said the French president. The Xi-Macron meeting in Paris comes a year after the French president visited Beijing and Guangzhou. As the world undergoes profound historical changes, the French believe in engagement with China based on friendship and effective diplomacy. There is a need for interdependence based on mutually beneficial support built on the foundation of mutual trust. By joining hands, China and France will help prevent and avert new divisions in this shattered world, trying to instill hope that both countries will play a positive role in conflict resolutions.\n\nThe author is executive vice president of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China."
