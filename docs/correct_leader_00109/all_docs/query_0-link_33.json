        "text": "On February 16, 2023 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with President of the French Constitutional Council and former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius in Paris.\n\nWang Yi said that as China optimizes COVID-19 response measures, it is enjoying a renewed prospect of strong economic growth. China will continue to pursue high-quality development, promote high-standard opening up, and firmly adhere to the Chinese path to modernization, which will bring new opportunities for China-France cooperation in various areas. As two permanent members of the UN Security Council and major countries firmly standing on their own feet, China and France should shoulder their responsibilities and step up coordination and cooperation in the face of uncertainties in the international situation, firmly support globalization and multi-polarity, and work jointly to practice multilateralism and safeguard the authority of the United Nations and the basic norms governing international relations.\n\nFabius said that France-China relations have developed smoothly. In recent years, challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the necessity for the international community to strengthen cooperation. France and China share extensive common understandings on major international issues, and should work together to steer the international situation in the right direction toward a balanced multipolar world."
