        "text": "The Chauvet cave, presented as a cultural property, is a major site in the history of humanity. It houses a\n\nset of over 1,000 drawings representing human and animal figures made 36,000 years ago. This\n\ncreation is not only the oldest in our history, but constitutes an aesthetic masterpiece where inventiveness\n\ncombines with a perfect technical mastery. The Chauvet cave provides both scientific research and\n\nexceptional for the knowledge of men of this time and to art a jewel whose emotional power is also\n\nstrong today than at the time of its conception. A space of restitution of the cave located in Vallon-Pont-d'Arc (Ardèche),\n\nseven kilometres from the original, the foundation stone of which was laid in October 2012 in the presence of the\n\nCulture and Communication, will allow the public to discover the splendour of the cave.\n\nThe tectono-volcanic ensemble of the Puys – Limagne fault, presented as natural landscapes,\n\nis an exceptional site for its beauty and authenticity. It allows us to understand the emergence of forms\n\nand the structuring of continents. The scientific value of the site, recognized since the 18th century, makes it a place\n\nfounder in the emergence of modern volcanology and the history of science. Site whose purity and harmony of\n\nlines were recognized as early as the 2nd century AD by the Romans, who elected him to establish the largest sanctuary there.\n\nmountain range of ancient Gaul, the Puys chain is naturally enhanced by the Limagne fault. These\n\nvolcanoes of various shapes, exceptionally dense, have become a reference for the visual perception of a\n\nchain of volcanoes.\n\nUnanimously recognized last October by the National Committee of French World Heritage Properties, the cave\n\nChauvet et la chaîne des Puys – faille de Limagne are the two best candidates to bring to forty the\n\ntotal of French properties recognized as World Heritage in 2014.\n\nTwo other excellent French records, the climates of the Burgundy vineyard and the hillsides, houses and cellars of\n\nChampagne, have generated strong support in the territories concerned, thanks to the mobilization of project teams, and\n\nhave assets that must allow them to access the inscription on the list of the heritage of humanity.\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy and the Minister of Culture and Communication warmly congratulate the teams who, for years, have carried out these four files with exceptional competence and commitment and hope that their mobilization in the service of the international influence of the culture and landscapes of our country will be successful."
