        "text": "On August 29, 2020 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met at request with President of the Constitutional Council Laurent Fabius of France in Paris.\n\nWang Yi expressed, China-France relations have maintained a strong momentum of development under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state. After the outbreak of the COVID-19, the Chinese and French governments and people have supported and helped each other. Against the background of regular epidemic prevention and control, China and France should further deepen strategic mutual trust, restore exchanges and cooperation in various fields in an orderly manner and constantly expand cooperation in new fields, so as to inject more stability into the economic recovery of both countries and the world as a whole.\n\nWang Yi emphasized, solidarity and cooperation is the most powerful weapon to defeat the virus. As the current epidemic situation is still severe, the Chinese side is willing to work with the French side and the European Union(EU) to continue to uphold and practice multilateralism, safeguard the current international system and international order, promote solidarity among the international community in fighting against the COVID-19, make the vaccine accessible and affordable for African countries, implement the Paris Agreement on climate change and set an example of benign interaction and win-win cooperation between major countries.\n\nLaurent Fabius recalled the days when he worked with the Chinese side as French Foreign Minister in facilitating the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear issue. Laurent Fabius expressed deep regret for the current unilateral breach of the JCPOA. He said, both France and China are countries with the tradition of independence. As champions of the current international order of multilateralism, France, the EU, and China should continue to adhere to the main theme of multilateral cooperation, lead the international community to take active action, strengthen international cooperation in developing the vaccine for the COVID-19, and jointly respond to global challenges such as climate change, so as to make due contributions to world peace, progress, and prosperity."
