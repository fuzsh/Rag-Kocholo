He is an extraordinary individual, warm, bright and driven by a long-term vision.\n\nThrough supporting orphans from all African countries in order to access the world’s top universities, the goal is to ensure that, in a near future, Africa has an elite contributing to its development. We believe that it is because those elites have been through a lot that they will have what it takes to, in the next 10 to 20 years, make Africa an essential continent to the world’s future."
