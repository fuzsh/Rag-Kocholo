        "text": "France's foreign minister met with Cuban President Raul Castro on Saturday during the first visit to the island by such a high-ranking French official in 31 years and a sign of the quickening pace of improving ties between the European Union and Havana.\n\nLaurent Fabius said he discussed politics, human rights, market-oriented reforms in Cuba and bilateral relations in what he characterized as \"a long conversation'' with Castro.\n\n\"We want to push forward our relations in the areas of culture, education, economics and politics,'' Fabius, a former prime minister, told reporters at the end of a one-day visit to the communist-run Caribbean country.\n\n\"Of course, we have different points of view on certain issues, which doesn't stop us from exchanging perspectives and moving forward,'' he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Fabius met with his Cuban counterpart, Bruno Rodriguez, various Cabinet ministers, Cardinal Jaime Ortega and French businessmen.\n\nSince Fabius took office in 2012, he has tried to shift more of France's diplomatic focus toward winning contracts in markets where French firms are traditionally weak, as Paris looks to find growth opportunities overseas.\n\nFrance is looking to expand its business ties with Latin America and sees Cuba as an important player in the region, given that it hosted a regional summit this year and both Brazil and Mexico are increasing their presence in the country.\n\n\"There are many French firms already here, but it's necessary that this presence is strengthened and our Cuban friends agree,'' Fabius said.\n\nFabius was scheduled to return to France on Saturday evening, having previously visited Mexico.\n\nBilateral trade last year was $388 million (280 million euros), according to the French government, mainly wheat exports to the communist-run Caribbean island.\n\nConstruction and engineering firm Bouygues, beverage maker Pernod-Ricard, the Accor tourism corporation and energy company Total, all have investments in Cuba and are among 60 French firms operating in the country.\n\nFrance has also been leading efforts by the Paris Club of creditor nations to resume debt negotiations with Havana, broken off in 2000.\n\nIn February, the EU agreed to begin negotiations with Cuba to increase trade, investment and dialogue on human rights in its most significant diplomatic shift since it lifted sanctions on the country in 2008.\n\nThe talks are scheduled to begin April 29 in Havana, according to European diplomats, and they said the French foreign minister's visit would test the waters.\n\nCuba has been subject to a U.S. embargo for five decades. It is eager to eliminate the EU's ``common position,'' enacted in December 1996, which links human rights and democracy conditions to improved economic relations.\n\nTo do so, the two sides will have to reach a new accord that is agreeable to all 28 member states, including Poland and the Czech Republic, which have taken a harder line on Cuba given their own communist pasts.\n\nReuters\n\nReuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada. One of the world's largest wire services, it provides financial news as well as international coverage in over 16 languages to more than 1000 newspapers and 750 broadcasters around the globe."
