        "text": "There are two ways to experience La Roue at NYFF61:\n\nSept. 30 at 12:15pm in full (426m) with 30-minute intermission.\n\nOct. 4 at 12pm (eps. 1-2, 232m) and Oct. 5 at 12pm (eps. 3-4, 194m). Oct. 4 ticket holders will present the Oct. 4 ticket on Oct. 5 for admission. No Oct. 5 ticket required for entry.\n\nOne of silent cinema’s undeniable high-water marks, Abel Gance’s monumental work of psychological realism, La Roue, is a narratively and emotionally expansive epic whose technical innovations changed the course of film history. The film recounts the doomed love of a railroad engineer, Sisif (Séverin-Mars), for the orphan he takes in and raises as his own daughter, Norma (Ivy Close); upon realizing that his affection for Norma is as romantic as it is paternal, he inadvertently sets in motion a tragic chain of events. Shot almost entirely on location and marked by a dazzling array of techniques that would influence countless filmmakers in the decades to come—superimpositions, extreme close-ups, and rhythmic montage, to name a few—La Roue is at once a towering classic of early narrative cinema and a genuine formal experiment whose gambits shaped our understanding of film style. A Janus Films Release. New 4K Restoration."
