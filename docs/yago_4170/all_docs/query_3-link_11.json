        "text": "Having rejected their use before the war, the British Expeditionary Force established a Carrier Pigeon Service as a pragmatic response to the difficulties of maintaining frontline communications on the fire-swept battlefields of France and Flanders. The success of the service is a powerful illustration of the significant, if largely unheralded, role played by animals in modern warfare. It serves too, to warn against a tendency to over-emphasise the impact of the technologically-innovative in the writing of military history. Carrier pigeons may have been an 'old' technology, but, during the positional warfare of 1915-17, they were acknowledged to be of more practical utility for units in combat than wireless sets.\n\nJulian Huxley’s experiences of the United States in 1912-16 as a young biological researcher have not been explored in great detail. In particular, his encounter with the postbellum south at Edward McIllhenny’s ‘Bird City’ (an ornithological reserve on McIllhenny’s land at Avery Island in Louisiana) provokes a fascinating discussion around the interlinking of ecology, conservation, biology and racial segregation. In his late memoir Memories (1970), Huxley claimed it as his ‘most exciting (and scientifically profitable) ornithological experience’ to date as he studied the behaviour of the beautiful snowy egrets that McIllhenny encouraged to breed. Yet other elements of McIllhenny’s control over the estate leave an unpleasant taste; Huxley recalls McIllhenny exercising ‘a feudal authority’ over his black workforce, ‘much more arbitrary than anything I had seen in agricultural England’. For Huxley, McIllhenny’s ‘great virtue […] was his love of birds’. Yet McIllhenny’s own writings depict a man whose belief in the order and symmetry of the natural world – the ‘bird city’ that he created mirrored the great human urban conurbations of the United States – was accompanied by a disturbing belief in the natural rightness of white supremacy and the success of southern slavery. ‘Under the slave-system’, McIllhenny writes, ‘the Negro had no care’, and emancipation created 'chaos in the South'. In this paper, I use Huxley’s experiences of ‘Bird City’ and the postbellum south as a way of exploring more troubling and complex interactions between race and racism, conservation, and behavioural biology in the period.\n\nThe article uses posthumanism and animal studies as a framework for making sense of B.F. Skinner’s wartime project of training pigeons to guide missiles, with emphasis on explaining the negative response of the donors and the public. The article first considers the hypothesis that the donors’ incredulity was evoked by the species of the animal. During World War II the United States began a massive program for the training of dogs for the military, and the campaign received unanimously positive publicity in the media. Possibly, thus, dogs were perceived as capable of bravery and sacrifice while pigeons were not. However, messenger pigeons had been traditionally incorporated into the war machine and were perceived as heroic. Thus, the analysis moves on to suggest that the perception of the project as ridiculous was related to the type of behavior performed by the animals: a behavior perceived as trained (artificially acquired) and not instinctive. The analysis then shifts into how the distinction between what is perceived as instinctive (natural) and learned (artificial) behavior influences the reception of different performances involving animals. Performances built around “natural” behaviors generate much stronger positive responses, even if the naturalness of these behaviors is a carefully crafted effect.\n\nThe emergence and organisation of amateur networks of observation in Britain in the period between 1920 and 1940 are addressed in this paper. It examines the geographical, organisational and epistemological associations between networks of ornithological observation (traced through the British Trust for Ornithology), which emerged in the 1920s, and amateur ethnography (traced through Mass-Observation) which emerged in the late 1930s. I approach these ‘observational cultures’ as spaces which brought together concepts and practices of the local, of everyday nature and society, as well as the possibilities of changing the everyday. The paper suggests that popular observation during the period partly constituted a reframing of ways of knowing Britain differentiated through the everyday production of natural and social knowledge and the construction of the active citizen and new communities of practice.\n\nThe eBook Animals in the Great War is one of the didactic proposals that was developed by the cultural association Se. It is in response to the latter’s pledge to promote the history of the twentieth century, disseminating an inclusive knowledge that develops further secondary subjects that have been excluded from institutional accounts with the aim of expanding the definition of a discipline, in this case history, so that it is no longer the “science of man throughout time” but the “science of the living throughout time”. It provides teachers and secondary school students with a tool, that offers updated references to develop line of study in the classroom whilst also offering a methodological support for individual or group work at home."
