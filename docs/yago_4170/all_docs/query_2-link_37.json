        "text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Stephen Harvey is the coordinator of special film projects at the Museum of Art's Department of Film. By STEPHEN HARVEY\n\nFor many moviegoers, the recent presentation of Abel Gance's silent spectacle ''Napoleon'' was not merely the film event of the season, but a full-fledged cultural milestone. In the tumult surrounding the rediscovery of this film, Mr. Gance was credited with nearly every cinematic innovation this side of Smell-O-Vision, while ''Napoleon'' itself has been widely dubbed the greatest achievement of the silent era - most loudly perhaps by those who had never seen a movie by Eisenstein, L'Herbier, Griffith, Murnau or Stroheim.\n\nHowever arguable such claims might be, a new generation of Gance enthusiasts is understandably eager to sample more of this director's outsized filmic visions. In response, an entire Gance program has been scheduled for this Tuesday at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, to be repeated at the Bleecker Street Cinema on the following day. Two of Mr. Gance's early surrealist comedies, ''La Folie du Dr. Tube'' (1915) and ''Au Secours'' (1923), will be grouped on a program with Kevin Brownlow's documentary tribute to the man and his work, ''Abel Gance: The Charm of Dynamite.'' But the real pyrotechnics are in store from the feature which will complete this bill - Mr. Gance's 1937 pacifist polemic, ''J'Accuse.'' Restored for the first time to its original length (a mere two hours and five minutes), ''J'Accuse'' gives New Yorkers a rare opportunity to view an example of the director's work from the sound era, and one which created much controversy, even for Mr. Gance, in its day.\n\nA considerably refashioned adaptation of a 1919 Gance effort with the same name, ''J'Accuse'' is one of Mr. Gance's few post''Napoleon'' films which he himself felt fulfilled his aspirations. After the utter failure of his first sound film (entitled, with typical Gance understatement, ''La Fin du Monde'' (1930) or ''The End of the World''), the director had to turn to more conventional projects in order to keep practicing his metier. Most of the films which resulted made use of his sure craftsmanship but scarcely engaged his passions as a self-proclaimed film artist - a pre-Garbo ''La Dame aux Camelias'' (1934); an adaptation of Charpentier's opera ''Louise''(1938) for the American soprano Grace Moore; and a baroque film, ''La Venus Aveugle'' (''Blind Venus'') (1941), about a lowlife madonna of the waterfront.\n\nPerhaps in quest of parallels to his own frustrated ambitions, Mr. Gance's sympathies were more engaged by films concerning heroic male visionaries, besieged by the small-mindedness of the world surrounding them. One such work was ''Un Grand Amour de Beethoven,'' (1936) featuring the tortured histrionics of Harry Baur as the composer. ''J'Accuse'' was another emphatic example of this genre. Its protagonist, Jean Diaz (played by the distinguished French character actor Victor Francen), is a research scientist obsessed with horrific memories of the trench warfare he experienced in World War I.\n\nDiaz is bent on creating an invention which will forever end such conflicts, but the times are against him. When he learns that his experiments will be used to promote war rather than prevent it, the already alienated Diaz teeters into madness. As a last resort to halt the coming conflagration, Diaz exhorts the dead of Verdun to rise from their graves and shock mankind into keeping the peace. This they do in the delirious danse macabre which concludes ''J'Accuse,'' their gruesome death's-heads superimposed on images of the living populace fleeing in terror.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
