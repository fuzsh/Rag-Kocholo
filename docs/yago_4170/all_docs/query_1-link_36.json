        "text": "This Post 100 Posts and 100 Years Ago…\n\nThis Year… 2020\n\nThis is the year of the great Covid-19 pandemic in which our society closed down and a lot of people died.\n\nThis is the year that these books were published.\n\nThe Church’s Best Kept Secret by Mark Shea,\n\nThe Ickabog by J.

We have an expression, “I remember the first thing we didn’t do together”. I just happen to love writing and have finally found an outlet that lets me hone in and focus on that skill. So, when I hit milestones like my 100th post on our 5th month anniversary of professional blogging I like to write a post about it. I have also come to love timelines by writing several of them. I like to get an overview and glance of history. I like to think of where we’ve been and make connections between people, places, and events. It helps me to ponder the great wonderful mystery of it all and it helps me to really concentrate as I look up facts and figures.\n\nI tried to limit the number of facts I put into this landmark post, but sometimes I found too many interesting things and just kept listing. I tried to find culturally important facts. But I also put other things I just found too darn interesting. Anyway, here is a look into history and into my mind as well. I hope it amuses you like it amused me.\n\nSo, without further ado I want to explore and share with you what happen…\n\n10 Posts Ago The Cross and Sorrows: Meditations SEPTEMBER 14, 2020\n\n10 Years Ago when we got married … in 2010.\n\nApril 20, 2010: An explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico causes the biggest marine oil spill in history.\n\nIt was later turned into a movie ‘Deepwater Horizon” (2016).
