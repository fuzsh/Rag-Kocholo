These three or four siblings have to move to a new house, and their mother is allergic to dust. There is a shed or playhouse in their back yard, and it has a stove in it. A mysterious person comes and gives them a dial for the stove, and they use it to cook some recipes with magical results. The only one I remember is that one or two of the children become invisible. Eventually, the mysterious person takes his dial and leaves the kids with the memory.\n\nM94 (Magic stove dial invisible siblings) is M FOR MISCHIEF by Richard Parker, ill. by Charles Greer 1966. I read this book over and over and am lucky enough to still own my childhood copy, so I am pretty positive this is the one. ~from a librarian\n\nMore on the suggested title M for Mischief by Richard Parker, illustrated by Charles Geer, published by Duell 1966, 90 pages \"Three children, two girls and a boy, who have just moved into an unexciting old house, find an ancient rusty stove, complete with its own baffling cookbook, hidden away in a long-neglected summerhouse. Two settings on a dial - O for \"Ordinary\" and M for \"Mischief\" take the place of the usual oven gauge. Life grows hilariously complicated for everyone in the family when the children experiment with the recipe for boiled eggs which will render the eater invisible. But\n\nMachine\n\n\"Do not fold, spindle, mutilate.\" I am looking for a children's book from the '70s (I think) entitled \"The Machine\". The story concerns a little boy who was given a toy robot (for a birthday, perhaps?) that begins change as it encounters other electronic devices (i.e., it 'sees' a radio and suddenly assumes some of the qualities of a radio--a tapedeck appearing in its chest; it sees a bulldozer and suddenly develops treads like a bulldozer). This continues to occur, and the robot continues to grow larger and more menacing until the little boy fears he may do real harm. At last the boy pulls from his pocket a ticket that came with the robot which reads \"do not fold spindle or mutilate.\" Of course, he does just this (folding, spindling, and mutilating the ticket) and the (now gigantic) robot spurts and rattles and finally shrinks back to its original (and unmenacing) size. I remember the illustrations being particularly enjoyable (b/w cartoonish illustrations). Can you help me out?\n\nShoberg, Lore, Machine, McGraw-Hill (1973). Card catalog description: A boy becomes worried when the machine he receives from a TV celebrity keeps growing and the people in the city want to make it king. ISBN: 0070569886\n\nI saw the listing for my book query today and was so excited to find the book had already been identified. Thank you so much for your help. My 2 1/2 year old son is enamoured with all things mechanical (he already knows the names of most construction vehicles and calls out their names when we pass road crews; \"backhoe, pay-loader, grader!\"). My wife and I don't know where he gets this (we're a couple of book-nerd professors at the U of Utah); but when he recently become enthusiastic about robots, too--I thought, 'here's my chance to share with him a book I loved from my childhood.' I just couldn't for the life of me remember the author's name (and searching under \"Machine\" or \"Robot\" was returning thousands of hits). I had all but given up hope when I found Loganberry books and you. I am so grateful to you. This will be such a wonderful xmas present (for both my son and me). Thanks again and happiest of holidays.\n\nMacmillan Reading Program Primers\n\nJeff, Mary, and Mike textbook(s) My first grade textbook (or series, like the Dick and Jane series) was about Jeff, the oldest child, a brunette with a red bicycle, Mary in the middle, a blond with a blue bicycle, and little brother Mike, sandy-haired with a yellow bicycle. Although I was in first grade in 1968-1969, this was probably early 1960s as Jeff and Mike still had the crew cuts and \"flood pants\" so sadly out-of-style a few years later. A book titled \"Titch,\" written and illustrated by Pat Hutchins and first published in 1971, features children in the same order, the girl also named Mary and the boys\n\nwith one-syllable names (Pete and Titch) and bikes of the same color, though Titch's was a little yellow tricycle. I have to wonder whether this was a coincidence or whether Pat Hutchins, knowingly or otherwise, was paying tribute to Jeff, Mary, and Mike.\n\nPrimers featuring Jeff, Mary, and Mike should appear under the heading \"Macmillan Reading Program preprimers.\" The three books definitely in the Jeff, Mary, and Mike series are Opening Books, A Magic Box, and Things You See, all by Mae Clark and all published by Macmillan in 1965 in softcover, and in 1970 possibly in hardcover. These three are all classified as \"preprimers.\" Another, Lands of Pleasure, is classified as a \"first primer,\" but I don't know if it also features the same characters or is a regular textbook with poems and stories, as are some of the other ten books I found listed under this author and publisher. One book of Mae Clark's I would be interested in which is not Jeff, Mary, and Mike is Worlds of Wonder. It seems to be Book #1 in the \"California State Series.\" You might make another heading for \"California State Series, School Readers\" and list Worlds of Wonder, Book 1(?), Much Majesty, Book 4, First Splendor, Book 5, and Wider Than the Sky, Book 6, and maybe someone will know what Books 2 and 3 are and I can put together the set.\n\nThe entry under Macmillan Reading Program in your \"solved\" section seems to indicate that someone would like more information about these books. When I started teaching first grade in 1968 we used this series of readers. Opening Books was preprimer1, A Magic Box was preprimer2, and Things You See was preprimer3. The next book in the series was Worlds of Wonder and it was called the primer. That book was followed by Lands of Pleasure which was the first reader. Children who did well in school would be expected to go through all of these books in first grade. I have the second grade books from this series also; one of them is called Enchanted Gates. There were 2 books for second grade (teachers referred to them as the 2-1 and 2-2 books). There were also 2 books for third grade. There was just one book each for fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. One thing i liked about these books was that each title was a phrase from a poem about books and reading; the poem would be printed before the title page of the book.\n\nMad Scientists' Club\n\nMonster of the lake is fake. About some kids that make up a ï¿½Loch Ness monsterï¿½ for their own lake, to help a friend out of a lie. To support the lie, the kids construct one, and this is seen by witnesses, this eventually gets out of hand with many sightings, news crews, etc..\n\nSounds like Bertrand Brinley's The Mad Scientists' Club from the early 1960s. It was followed by The New\n\nAdventures of the Mad Scientists' Club and, in the 1970s, The Big Kerplop - which is a prequel written in\n\nnovel form. (That one is not so terrific.) The illustrator was perfectly chosen. The Club is made up of 7 boys aged 12 to 15 or so, and they get involved in all sorts of hijinks with the help of all sorts of WWII surplus electronic equipment that they collect. (Examples: gas balloon race, long-lost fortune, \"high-tech\" prank at the mayor's speech, night rescue of a downed pilot, a cleverly \"haunted\" house, bank robbers, submarine, \"flying saucer\", rainmaking, and kidnappings by the rival club.) They are all out of print, but the reviews at you-know-what dot com are many and passionate - the first two books ARE very funny and you may have to read them first so you won't burst out laughing with every other page when reading to your kids! While somewhat socially dated, as you\n\nmight expect, they are very much worth it and a fascinating look at what kids could (sometimes) really do even before the computer age (though Henry does, in the first story of NAotMSC, reveal that he has a homemade computer!) I often wonder just where it's supposed to be - it's very rural and you know from one story that they're in a Yankee state, but my guess is it's not in New England, anyway.\n\nProbably the Mad Scientists' Club or the New Adventures of the Mad Scientists' Club by Betrand R. Brinley. I know there is a fake monster in the lake chapter in one of those two books.\n\nyes, I'd love to get all three of the Mad Scientist Club books. Just let me know.\n\nMadamoiselle Misfortune\n\nIn this book a young girl is sent by her family to accompany a wealthy older woman on a trip from Paris to Southern France. Trip may have been by train or by car; can't recall. The young girl isn't happy about going, because she finds the old lady rude or brusque or patronizing. I think I recall them buying creche figures in Marseilles -- in that famous market. But I could have this confused with Family Sabbatical where they do that. Of course, the old lady has a heart of gold and all turns out well in the end. I read this book in the 50's.\n\nBrink, Carol Ryrie, Madamoiselle Misfortune\n\nMadeline is Sleeping\n\nBook came out about 5 years ago, 3 girls (and a baby?) in Victorian dress on the sepia-toned cover, author Katherine perhaps? Professor at USC or UCLA or some university in California (I think), the book was very surrealistic and fantastic, the baby was in an interminable state of sleep, there was a trio of circus-like odd people, a pedophile was in there, very strange book. Somehow connected to Alice in Wonderland.\n\nSOLVED: It's \"Madeline Is Sleeping\" by Sarah Shun-lien Bynum, who teaches at UC San Diego (close!). It was nominated for the National Book Award in 2004 (or maybe 2005). I did pretty well, all things considered!\n\nYou sure did! Thanks for your Stumper.\n\nMaggie B.\n\nThis book is from my childhood (I was born in 1969) and features a girl wishing on a star and wanting to take a trip. She magically/via imagination sets sail on the ocean with her baby brother who she is now responsible for. She grows pears and other fruit on the boat for them to eat. They may have a chicken on the boat who lays eggs for them??? A large part of the book seemed to be her growing/making food for her brother. She washes her brother up after their meal, bundles him up, and rocks him to sleep. The book ends with a return to reality, I believe. I would love to locate this book again to share with my young daughter!\n\nThis looks like the same book as M 68: The Maggie B by Irene Haas. It's recently been reprinted and is an adorable book.\n\nI'm the author of G48 and am pleased to say that, yes indeed, The Maggie B. (same as M68) was indeed the book I was looking for! I checked it out of the library and have shared it with my daughter and she loves it too! As a matter of fact I've read it with all my mom friends as well and have told them about this wonderful site. Thank you very much for solving my querry!\n\n---\n\nI read the book to my kids in the late seventies, early eighties.It was a paperback and belonged to my younger brother. It was a picture book story about a little girl, Maggie and her baby brother, who she cared for on their little boat. Actually, I think that \"The Maggie B.\" may have been the name of their boat. She kept a goat, a little garden and fished from her boat. A sweet book. Can you help me find it, or more info. about who wrote it, etc.? Thanks for your help.\n\nI was just browsing through your website, when I came across this \"unsolved mystery\": \"M61: Maggie B.\"\n\nI think I know the title of the book -- it's simply called The Maggie B. by Irene Haas; it was recently reprinted (Aladdin Picture Books). Hope this helps!\n\nM61 is The Maggie B by Irene Haas. A *great* book.\n\nThis does sound like The Maggie B, by Irene Haas (on Solved list) published New York, Atheneum 1975, reprinted various times, 32 pages. \"Before sleep one night, Margaret Barnstable wishes for a ship named for herself. The next morning she awakes on the Maggie B. and the adventure begins! The ship has a garden growing on it, and she cooks and cares for herself and baby brother James. Full color paintings loaded with detail.\" See also G48 Girl on boat\n\n---\n\nI am desperately searching for a children's picture book my mom read to me as a child, probably published in the 70's, - seems thre was a child with his/her grandma out to sea on a ship ...I think they caught crab or lobster and cooked and had warm cozy dinners in the cabin of the boat - I think there were descriptons of food and smells? ...may have been a storm, but I can't quite remember - this book reminds me of warm, cozy, safe memories...Please help me find it once again!:)\n\nThe Maggie B. This book may be The Maggie B., although that is about a girl and her baby brother - no grandmother. The girl does catch and cook their dinner and there is a storm - but they are snug inside and the ship rides it out safely. Definitely a strong feeling of comfort and safety. My daughter & I love this story. I bought it for my daughter in the 80's, but I think it may be back in print.\n\nIrene Haas, The Maggie B, 1975. I think this must be The Maggie B. -- maybe you thought of a grandmother because the illustrations of little Maggie show her wearing an old-fashioned dress and apron, with a kerchief on her head (and of course she does all those grown-up things like cook the lobster stew and bake the muffins, and lash down the ship against the storm).\n\n---\n\n1970s, illustrated. Girl lives on small boat. She's alone, except for animals (including a caged parrot). Smooth sailing for a while, but then a storm hits. Girl gathers animals in cabin; all are warm and cozy inside as girl prepares dinner.\n\nIrene Haas, The Maggie B. This is one of my favorite books! \"A little girl's wish to sail for a day on a boat named for her \"with someone nice for company\" comes true. Maggie's little brother is that \"someone nice\" and the two of them spend the day on their little boat living the sea life. The boat is fully equipped with an apple, peach and orange tree bearing fruit (and a beautiful toucan). There is an abundance of fresh eggs and milk to be had from various chickens and the goat. Maggie herself fishes and serves up sumptuous meals of lobster and peaches with cinnamon and honey for dessert. The day is simple and homey, the only real source of concern a thunderstorm that crashes and booms towards the end of the day. Even then, Maggie thoughtfully battens down the hatches and plays her fiddle to her brother, tucked snugly in his bed.\"\n\nIrene Haas, The Maggie B.Yes, this is the book! Thirty years muddled a few specifics (toucan/parrot, I forgot the little brother), but your description has rekindled the memories. For weeks after first reading of them, I was absolutely relentless in bothering my mother to make peaches and cinnamon. Outstanding - thanks so much!\n\n-------------------------\n\nPicture book about an old woman living on a houseboat of sorts, with only animals as companions. She eats oatmeal with milk from the cow. I don't remember much of a plot. As a child I was just really impressed by her independence, and also the fantasy of living on a boat.\n\nShot in the dark, but could it be THE MAGGIE B. by Irene Haas?\n\nSOLVED: Irene Haas, The Maggie B. Someone solved my stumper! Thank you! Thank you!\n\nMaggie in the Middle\n\nsee The Seven Stone Maggie Muggins\n\nLooking for a book 1960's....Title, Maggie Muggins Every book in series ends with, \"I wonder what we will do tommrow.\"\n\nMary Grannan, Maggie Muggins.

He gets into some trouble, his life is actually in danger and he has a breakthrough and uses the glowing marble to -- I think -- put a shield around himself that makes him invulnerable and he gets away. I think the marble was blue.\n\nM71 - could this be Nicholas Stuart GrayThe Applestone ? Some similarities.\n\nI have to say, the only similarity with The Apple Stone is the size of the item. Gray's book contains no aliens, no force-fields, no blue. Instead, the Apple Stone is golden and speaks for itself, instructing the group of children how to use it. This book sounds more American than English, and more science fiction than fantasy.\n\nMaybe Carl Biemiller's Magic Ball from Mars New York, Morrow, 1953?\n\nM83 and M71 seem to be asking about the same book. Not that that helps either searcher much.\n\nM71 and M83: Carl Biemiller, The Magic Ball from Mars\n\n---\n\nI remember this book from the mid fifties. It was an adventure story about a boy who finds a marble that turns out to be magic. Not sure about title, author. What a fun site to reminisce about the books we loved. Another favorite of mine was The Book of Live Dolls.\n\nMagic Ball from Mars, by Carl L. Biemiller, illustrated by Kathleen Voute, published Morrow 1953, 127 pages. \"An amusing bit of science fiction about Johnny Jenks' adventures with a mysteriously glowing ball of 'marsquartz' given him by a kindly man from 'Out There' who comes to Earth in a flying saucer. Johnny's visit to the Pentagon to show the ball to the authorities and his subsequent kidnapping are lively enough adventures.\" (HB Oct/53 p.360)\n\nI tripped over your site and noted with interest that my father's book, The Magic Ball From Mars, was the subject of one of your stumper questions. About a year and a half ago, I developed a web site devoted to Dad's books and getting them back in print. This link to, \"The Magical Stories of Carl L. Biemiller\" may be of some help to your project. The Magic Ball From Mars should make it back in print this Fall as part of a Forrest Ackerman \"Martianthology\" to be published by The Sense of Wonder Press. Funny how projects and web sites grow. I'm still learning.\n\n-------------\n\nChildren's science fiction book about a boy visited by an alien, a tall thin man if I remember correctly, from the Andromeda galaxy. The man gives the boy a shining marble that he says will protect him, and I think is also a transmitter to the man's spaceship. When the boy is threatened -- I think by thieves with guns -- he almost doesn't believe it will help him but then he takes it out and it makes a cocoon around him and bullets can't get through. There's a song the man's crew sings: \"Out in the Coalsack there's nothing but dust, and nucleonic (?) storms make the instruments rust, Patrols head through but only on trust, we'll be back in old Andromeda, in the morrrrrning.\" Anybody know this book?\n\nI remember the book, but not the title. I do recall that the space marble responded to the boy's thoughts, when one thief took it he told it to burn the man's pocket he called it back when it was lost, and the like. The friendly alien may have taken his marble back when he was worried about what would happen to the boy, but don't recall much more. Hope this helps.\n\nBiemiller, CL, The Magic Ball From Mars. Just remembered the name of the book, about the Martian ball, you can find the text online. It does have the chorus you're talking about.\n\nThat song sounds like a Cordwainer Smith space chanty, but the story is not one of his that I know of. The author could have been a Smith fan. Possibly orHarlan Ellison, James H. Schmitz William Rotsler?\n\nCarl L. Biemiller, The Magic Ball From Mars, 1970, approximate. I think B794, Boy visited by an alien, might be The Magic Ball From Mars. A \"stranger\" visits a boy on earth and gives him a gift, small ball/marble that will protect him.\n\nCarl L. Biemiller, The Magic Ball From Mars, 1952, 1953. This is The Magic Ball From Mars by Carl L. Biemiller. It was serialized in Jack and Jill under another name, which is where I ran into it as a child. The author's son has a website you can check: http://www.biemiller.com/bchapt1.htm\n\nThe book has the song, and the marble, and the boy escapes from people who want to steal the marble.\n\nSOLVED: The mystery is solved! This is the book, The Magic Ball from Mars, by Carl Biemiller. I visited the website below and the whole book is online, with the rest of Biemiller's childrens' stories, and with the original illustrations. Thank you so much to the people who gave me this information, it was so delightful to read it through again.\n\nMagic Bicycle: the story of a bicycle that found a boy\n\nI am looking for a book about a kid who finds a bike in a junkyard. He tries out the bike and finds out that if he pulls back on the handlebars, the bike can fly. There is also a group of evil characters who have an affiliation with a cobra or snake of some kind. Thanks!\n\nA couple of possibilities: The Magic Bicycle the story of a bicycle that found a boy / John Bibee /1983/ \"The Spirit Flyer, a rusty old bicycle found in the city dump, surprises its new owner, John Kramar, when it magically lives up to its name, introducing John to an unknown world and changing his life for good.\" Or maybe The Fabulous Flying Bicycle / Glen Dines / 1960/ (I think this is the one with the ice cream man, but I'm not sure)\n\nBibee, John, The Magic Bicycle: the story of a bicycle that found a boy, 1983. Sounds like the first book in the Christian-fantasy \"Spirit Flyer\" series. Young John Kramer finds a rusty old bicycle in the city dump and discovers that it can fly. This ends up bringing him into conflict with the boys in the Cobra Club, who represent the evil Goliath toy company.

I think there are one or two of them, and they live in an attic until they are discovered by a little girl who takes them out and plays with them.

Magic Elizabeth. Scholastic, Inc., 1966. Young Sally while staying in creepy old house with her Aunt Sarah, tries to find an old doll named Elizabeth. B&W Illustrations by Joe Krush.\n\n---\n\nLove your site! I'm looking for a book about a girl (around 12) who is sent to live with her stern maiden aunt for a summer. I think the aunt's name is Sarah, and she's incredibly stuffy. This girl starts rooting around in the attic and finds a diary, some clothing, a doll, etc. of a girl named Sally and eventually comes to believe either that she *is* Sally reincarnated, or haunted by her ghost. In the end it turns out that Aunt Sarah was Sally. Any help would surely be appreciated.\n\nS64 is Magic Elizabeth by Norma Kassirer. My copy has the title page torn out, so I don't know the year, but it's a pretty common Scholastic Book Services title. Elizabeth is the doll's name.\n\nS64 Stern Aunt Sarah: This is MAGIC ELIZABETH by Norma Kassirer, and it is listed on your solved\n\nstumpers page and may appear on most requested page too. It was recently republished.\n\nThe book you're thinking of is called \"Magic Elizabeth\". I don't know the author, but I know it had wonderful illustrations by Beth and Joe Krush. The story was of Sally, who went to stay at an elderly aunt's house and finds in the bedroom allotted to her a portrait of a little girl her age who looks just like her, holding a wonderful doll. Aunt Sarah tells Sally that the doll's name was Elizabeth and the girl's name was Sally also. Through the book, Sally gets to know and love old Aunt Sarah and her black cat Shadow and has dreams in which she experiences going back in time to be the other Sally. She wants to find Elizabeth, whom Aunt Sarah says disappeared a long time ago. Finally Shadow finds the doll and Sally finds out that the other Sally was her Aunt Sarah and the doll was hers. A favorite book of mine and of my daughter's, who I believe has it now which is why I can't put my hands on the author's name.\n\nS64 has got to be Magic Elizabeth, by Norma Kassirer \"A grumpy aunt, a black cat, a spooky old house, and a doll named Magic Elizabeth,\" says the front cover. The aunt is named Sarah, and the little girl is named Sally.\n\nThanks for the answer! I'm thinking about this book as a gift for a neighbor girl for her birthday later in the year. If I can't find it locally, I'll turn right to you. I appreciate the service you provide. Your website is a lot of fun and brings back tons of good memories!\n\n---\n\ni read a book when i was a child in about 5th grade. that would be around 1969, a young girl spends the summer with her cranky, aged aunt who hates children. while there, the young girl goes into the attic and finds some victorian clothing just right for a girl her age. she puts on the clothing and eventually falls asleep. in her dreams she goes back in time to become her aunt as a child and is able to locate the beloved lost doll her aunt had lost as a child when she finally wakes up out of her time travel dream, for it is the same house her aunt lived in as a child. i dont know the title of this book but i would love to read it again. i have been all over the net looking to find it. thank you.\n\nI think this one is Magic Elizabeth by Norma Kassirer. The little girl goes to stay with her a grandmother, not an aunt, but otherwise the details seem to match.\n\nI think both G66 and T101 are thinking of Magic Elizabeth by Norma Kassirer. It appears on your Solved Stumpers page, and it was recently republished. ~from a librarian\n\nSounds like Magic Elizabeth to me!\n\nA few years ago, on a fluke after I happened to find your website, I entered a request for a search on a book I had read as a 5th grader in 1969 and had loved very much.. Forgetting about the website, about 4 years went by and just this week, I happened to fall upon it again. lo and behold! you had found my book, allthough i havent a clue when. Not even knowing the name of the cherished book, I soon found out it was called, MAGIC ELIZABETH. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for that because I just came home today to find it on my computer desk, a gift from my husband. I have never forgotten how much I had loved this book. It will always be a treasure to me. thank you.\n\n--\n\nSomeone has asked me to help identify a story with a secret garden with a character in it named Elspeth. The person has read the Burnett Secret Garden and that is not it.\n\nI have a suggested book for your stumper, Mandy, by Julie Edwards, published in 1971. The description calls it an \"enchanting bestseller in the tradition of The Secret Garden. Ten-year-old Mandy lived in a lovely orphanage where the kind Matron Bridie looked after her well. The good houskeeper, Ellie, slipped her special treats from the kitchen. Mandy was happy, but nothing Mandy had was hers alone. Until that magical day when she climbed the stone wall at the bottom of the orchard, followed a little path through the forest and found the most beautiful deserted, small cottage, sitting in the sunlight, as if it were smiling at her.\" I only read this once, years ago. I don't know if Ellie was ever referred to as Elspeth, but it's worth a look if the date is right.\n\nNot too likely, but there's Nobody's Garden by Cordelia Jones, illustrated by Victor Ambrus, published NY Scribner 1966, 190 pages. Outgoing Hilary Toft decides to make friends with sullen, withdrawn Bridget, whose parents were killed in WWII. They find a common interest in their love for \"The Secret Garden\" and in recovering the garden of a deserted, bombed-out house, which becomes their own 'secret garden'. No mention of an Elspeth character.\n\nPerhaps ... My Horse Says, by Mary Schroeder, illustrated by P. Stone, published London, Chatto & Windus 1963, 170 pages. \"An imaginative story about three children and their widowed mother who have been given notice to quit their home. They start on the difficult search to find another house to rent and Elizabeth (the youngest), who is visited by a make-believe horse when she is alone, insists that they follow the instructions given to her by the horse. These lead eventually to an old deserted house in a walled garden. This was once the home of the squire, but it holds so many sad memories for him that he will not live in it himself or let it to anyone else. The children find an ally in the squire's sister and they are allowed to restore the garden to its former beauty. In time they get their wish and the house is theirs.\" (Junior Bookshelf Jan/63 p.26) The latter part of the plot is similar to The Secret Garden and Elizabeth is a similar name to Elspeth ...\n\nPerhaps, it is Elizabeth and her German Garden, the first book by Marie Annette Beauchamp--known all her life as \"Elizabeth\", originally published in 1898. It starts like a diary. It is freely downloadable.\n\nHi - don't know how much this will help (or how old the question is!) but I think I know the answer to the above stumper. The book sounds like Ginnie and the Mystery Doll. There is a secondary character named Elspeth, whom Ginnie befriends while staying at her crabby elderly auntie's house. Together Ginnie and Elspeth try to discover the whereabouts of a lost doll mentioned in an old diary.\n\nHi there - I made a mistake earlier! The book in questions is, I believe, Magic Elizabeth, by Norma Kassirer, as referenced in your #T101. I had the general plot right, but the wrong book. It's even still in print. Here's a short summary: Eight-year-old Sally faces an entire summer trapped in a creepy old house with no one for company but her spooky Aunt Sarah and a black cat named Shadow. But soon Sally uncovers a mystery about a beautiful old doll in a portrait -- and a little girl who looks just like Sally herself! In search of clues, Sally is drawn toward the attic and the old mirror that sits there. And when she looks into it, something magical happens....\n\n---\n\nProbably close to 30 years ago there was a childrens book that I read at school. It was kind of a scary mystery about a girl who went to visit her Aunt or her Grandma, and while she was there she found a doll in the attic in a trunk. The doll had special powers. I don't recall the doll being evil or anything . . .but I remember that it was a fabulous mystery. Can you help me locate this story?\n\nA common theme.... Behind the Attic Wall by Sylvia Cassedy? Rachel Field, Hitty: Her First Hundred Years? Checked Solved Mysteries for details. (More likely the former.)\n\nI've checked several of the options, Hitty and Behind the Attic wall, but neither were the one I was thinking of. Additionally it came to me that either the girls name or the dolls name may have been Elizabeth. I also checked the solved stories for that name - but couldn't find it there either. Thank you so much for the assistance in trying to find this book.\n\nCould this be Magic Elizabeth by Norma Kassirer?\n\nSo many hidden dolls...some titles you might try: Ruth M. Arthur, A Candle in her Room, 1966. Very scary. The doll's name is Dido, and it tries to control the girl who finds it. Janet Lunn, Twin Spell, 1969. This one has twins, a hidden doll, a missing doll, and an angry ghost. Jacqueline Jackson, Missing Melinda, 1967. More twins, another missing doll, found in an attic, but not scary. More of a treasure hunt mystery. If it has an old-fashioned feel, it could be one of Rumer Godden's doll books, and I think Mary C. Jane had a missing doll book as well. The others mentioned might be it as well...especially Magic Elizabeth, which is a wonderful story.\n\nNorma Kassirer, Magic Elizabeth. Magic Elizabeth, that's it! I've found a copy and the front cover is exactly the same as I remember now. Thank you so much!! I'm buying the copy for my 11 year old niece so she can enjoy it to. Thanks again!\n\n---\n\n1960's-70s. I can remember everything so vividly EXCEPT for the important parts: The title & author! A child goes to stay with their Aunt who lives in New York City {I believe} in the only Victorian house remaining on the block, surrounded by apartment buildings. The child is frightened at first thinking the aunt who has a black cat, is a witch. Also remember a player-type of piano. The child while playing on an old sled in the carriage house is somehow transported back to the Victorian Era. I believe it was the sled that was magical but it could have been an old diary perhaps?? I really loved this book & remember reading it around the time that, \"The Wednesday Witch\" was popular. Thanks so much!!\n\nNorma Kassirer, Magic Elizabeth, 1966. I'm pretty sure this is the book you are thinking about. Sally has to go stay with her aunt who lives in old Victorian house. She finds a diary of a little girl who use to live in the house and lost her favorite doll. Sally has dreams that correspond to events in the diary. One includes a sleigh ride.\n\nNorma Kassirer, Magic Elizabeth. See solved stumpers!\n\nkassirer, norma , Magic Elizabeth. One of my favorites! I recognized the storyline right away. Sally must stay with her Great Aunt Sarah while her parents and usual caregiver are away. At first she is frightened of her aunt, but is won over as she becomes fascinated by the \"mystery\" of a lost doll, named Elizabeth, and is transported back in time.\n\nMagic Elizabeth.Your details aren't bang-on but they're close enough that this must be the book--sorry it is so hard to find, I'd like a copy myself! Sal goes to stay with her Aunt Sarah and finds out about a doll, Elizabeth, that had been lost in the house years before. She keeps having dreams about going back in time, and eventually she and the aunt's cat find the doll. The \"player piano\" is a melodeon in the parlor.\n\nNorma Kassirer, Magic Elizabeth, 1966. Sounds like this could be the book because Sally, whose parents are out of town, goes to stay with her Great-aunt Sarah at her large and scary-looking old house which is surrounded by apartment buildings. Sally discovers that when she looks into a wall mirror, she sees another girl from the early 1900s, also named Sally, who lived in the house then. She also discovers her diary in the attic.\n\netc.\n\nMagic Everywhere\n\nI'm looking for a specific edition of I *think* A Book of Wizards by Ruth Manning-Sanders. The book is hardbound in a reddish/salmon color with a wizard on the cover and contains numerous color illustrations throughout- not just the frontispiece. I know Long Broad and Sharpsight is in it, I think Farmer Weathersky is in it. I recall a color illustration for Long Broad and Sharpsight of the wizard with iron bands. There is also another color illustration of a lady in a pink gown and hat being liftted out of water (or someplace) by an ugly giant or ogre. I had this book in 1985. thanks!!\n\nMiriam Blanter Huber & Frank Seely Salisbury, Magic Everywhere.Thanks, I found the book I was looking for via the Book Sleuth forum. The seller confirmed with pictures.\n\nMagic Faraway Tree\n\nMagic Forest\n\nI know this is going to sound so vague... this book I am looking for is about a boy, who has to travel through the wilderness to either escape, or get to where he needs to go and has no other alternative. He meets up with someone who helps him, possibly an indian. At one point he ends up being rescued from a river, or has to hide in a river, but somehow loses most of his clothing and must wear this big trenchcoat type of thing, I think provided by his helper, so maybe it wasn't an indian, but there may be indians involved in the story. Yikes, thanks for any help!\n\nB113---sure this isn't The Sign of the Beaver?\n\nB113 boy in wilderness: I don't think this is it, but in The Magic Forest, by Stewart White (first published 1920s, reprinted many times) young Jimmy sleepwalks from a stalled train into the forest, wearing only pajamas and slippers. He is found at the river's edge by canoing Indians who give him native clothes to wear because his are wet through from the snow.\n\nThe Magic Friend Maker\n\nThis was a story I read to my daughter in the early 70's about a girl who moved to a new house and made friends through a stone or rock that when she put it into water turned beautiful colors.\n\nGladys Baker Bone, The Magic Friend Maker. A book that sounds exactly like this came up on the Abebooks booksearch board. It was identified as The Magic Friend Maker by Gladys Baker Bond.\n\nThanks -- not sure it's the same one, but it sounds like it could be! I've sent for a copy and will let you know if it's the same story.\n\nYes, that was the book. Thanks so much.\n\n----\n\n1960s-1970s. This was a book about a young girl and a friend.

Maybe one of the friends was moving away?\n\nBaker Bond, Gladys, The magic friend-maker. Illustrated by Stina Nagel It was published in large format by Whitman in approx 1966.

With this as a starting place, the two girls become inseparable until Jean's family has to move away. As a parting gift, Jean gives her sad friend the special rock. When Beth meets Anna, a new girl moving into the building, she knows just how to start a friendship...\"Would you like to see my rock?\" I too had fond memories of this story and the enchanting pictures, and I tracked it down several years ago.

One book that I loved but was in poor condition was about a little rich girl named Amaryllis whose father ignored her until she ran away from her nurse. She found a boy and his father and they took her to their house which had a gorgeous run-down garden where she found that she was named after a flower. The boy taught her mumblety-pegs. Her father found her and became a wonderful loving Dad after a change of heart because of her running away. The boy became a famous violinist. She would go to his performances in secret and send Amaryllis blossoms. In the end he goes on a ship (I don't recall why) and the ship wrecks (only he missed it). She thinks he is dead.

The boy must develop his concentration skills, and practices by imagining a brick wall, one brick at a time.\n\nCould this be The Magic Grandfather, by Ruth Chew? or maybe another Chew title? She wrote shortish (100 p+/-) books that got picked up by the book clubs in the 80's.\n\nThe Magic Grandfather was actually by Jay Williams, but I haven't read it so I can't tell you whether this is the right book. Plot of The Magic Grandfather: \"An 11-year-old discovers that not only is his seemingly ne'er-do-well grandfather a bona fide sorcerer but he too may have an untapped talent for magic.\"\n\nJay Williams (author), Gail Owens (illustrator), The Magic Grandfather, 1979. This is definitely the book you're looking for! Eleven year old Sam Limner accidentally discovers that his seemingly unemployed, unambitious grandfather is actually a powerful enchanter. His grandfather decides to cast a spell over Sam to make him forget what he has learned, but agrees to let Sam witness one spectacular feat of magic first. (Sam has already seen his grandfather perform some small acts of magic, like mending a broken window, pulling a child's chipped tooth, and repairing a car that won't start. He also sees his grandfather earn money by transporting a pewter tankard from a tavern in 1790 to a present day antique shop, where he sells it for $100.) When Grandfather decides to summon a creature from another world, he allows Sam to hold a necessary piece of equipment. Sam drops the equipment during the spell, and Grandfather is sucked into the other world, where he becomes trapped. Sam, with the help of his cousin Sarah, decides to rescue his grandfather. Sam studies his grandfather's magic books and discovers that he has a talent for sorcery that has been obscured because an addiction to television has ruined his powers of imagination and concentration. He strengthens his imagination by reading a passage from The Wind in the Willows and imagining Badger' kitchen. He has trouble picturing the kitchen's brick floor, and concentrates so that he can imagine it in detail, brick by brick. After many mishaps, Sam rescues his grandfather, who acknowledges his talent and promises to help him develop it. If the author's name sounds familiar, it's because he is also a co-author of the Danny Dunn science fiction series---and he plugs the first book in The Magic Grandfather!

Magic wagon ... travel or voyage??? 1988-1990 In this book, a brother and a sister who are poor meet a magician that comes to their small town. I seem to remember something about them hiding in a haystack to meet him. Soon, they are travelling with him on his wagon, and I remember that he had lots of magical stuff. They end up in a big city (New York, maybe?) and the kids are amazed at the fancy hotel room with running water, which they have never seen. I think the magician was there to put on a show. There was also something about the magician helping poor children and animals in the streets of the city. In the end, I don't remember exactly what happens to the kids, but the magician leaves and tells them he will return when the moon is a certain odd color - maybe orange?? I don't know if this ever happens.\n\n#T105--Two siblings travel with magician: in some ways this sounds like Mr. Mysterious and Company by Sid Fleischman, only in that book the children were his own, so there would be nothing about picking up or leaving\n\nthem.\n\nHi, my book stumper is #T105, \"Two Siblings Travel With Magician,\" and I am just writing to let you know that the book I'm looking for is definitely NOT Mr. Mysterious and Company -- I checked it out. The details I listed are all very accurate -- I remember the plot clearly, but unfortunately I just blanked on the title. I hope someone is able to figure this one out, as I would love to get my hands on a copy of this great book!! Thanks for all your help.\n\nGood news! I went back to my \"childhood\" library this weekend and they still have the book - it's called The Magic Hat of Mortimer Wintergreen. Now I just need to locate a copy of it that I can keep (I tried bribing the librarian but to no avail!) Thanks.\n\nMagic in the Alley\n\nThank you for your site. I hope you can help me find the title of this book. I must have take it out of a public library in Alexandria VA in the early-mid 70's. I have only vague memories of the story line: It was about a boy who was friends with a crow or raven who could talk. At some point in the story, the crow/raven had to choose to give up being able to talk to save the boy. Does this ring any bells with you? Thank you for thinking about this book...\n\nOn the talking raven or crow, I *think* there was such a creature in Alley Magic, by Mary Calhoun, but as I never finished the book I have no idea if it gave up its powers.\n\nThis is really a long shot, but could this be Magic in the Alley by Mary Calhoun? The main character is a girl, with a friend who's a boy, and she reanimates a stuffed crow with magic, which can then talk. At the end of\n\nthe book she must decide whether to use her last magic to turn the crow into a real non-magic crow, who will lose the ability to talk. As I said, really a longshot.\n\nI looked this up and found only one expensive ex-library copy, but here's the info:\n\nCalhoun, Mary: Magic in the Alley. New York: Atheneum, 1970.\n\nOh My! It could be-- as I said all I remember are very vague things. I just remember being really affected by the choice that had to be made... I will now go out looking for this book. Was Mary Calhoun the author of the Katie John books?? I loved them too & could have read this because of that.\n\nThank you so much for your help. I love poring over your site & hope to be able to help someone the way you have helped me!\n\nMagic in the Park\n\nWhat a great site! My sisters and I have all been stumped with this one. We all read this book as kids (late 60s - early 70s) abut can't remember the name or author. It's about two kids in NY who turn into pigeons and go to the island in the middle of the lake in Central Park. I realize this is a very vague description, but I can't remember more than that, other than there was also a stolen bicycle involved. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nP-43 is, I think, another Ruth Chew book. It MIGHT be Earthstar Magic, but I'm not sure.\n\nP43 Pigeons Who Were Once Children: The other person who answered that it was a Ruth Chew book was right on track, but the title is MAGIC IN THE PARK, 1972.\n\nJust wanted to confirm that P43 is definitely Magic in the Park by Ruth Chew. Plot summary: \"Jenny and her friend Mike discover a magic tree and an old man who feeds the birds in the park. They discover that the tree moves around and that they can go underground and become birds with the help of the magic beech tree.\"\n\n---\n\nA chapter book was handed down to me in the early 1970's about a brother and sister who discover an old tree in a city park (New York Central Park?), and climbing up through the trunk they are turned into crows. The setting is in winter. Thanks for any help!\n\nC230 Sounds like it could be MAGIC IN THE PARK by Ruth Chew, 1972 ~from a librarian\n\n---\n\nFantastic website and idea! The book I am looking for was probably a scholastic book from the 70's. I think it was about a girl who moves to the city into an apartment and befriends a boy. Together they discover a tree in the park that is sometimes there and sometimes not (when it is not there, a man who feeds the animals and keeps them safe in the pockets of his coat is there - he of course turns into the tree). They learn how to turn into birds (or squirrels - I can't remember which) and then back into humans by eating nuts (I think from that tree). Any help remembering the title and author is much appreciated! Thanks.\n\nRuth Chew, Magic in the Park. I posted this question last week but think I soon found the answer on your website. I am pretty sure the book is Magic in the Park by Ruth Chew. Thanks!\n\nMagic in the Park by Ruth Chew? What's amazing about her is how she makes writing books for that age level look so easy. She's written about two dozen fantasy books and one non-fantasy book. See Solved Mysteries for her name.\n\nRuth Chew, Magic in the Park\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPossible titles are: A Tree in Winter, or A Tree in the Park, or The Park in Winter. A Boy and Girl meet an old man who feeds the birds in winter, who turns green in the spring, then disappears, but a big tree appears. Kids fall into the tree and turn into birds -- maybe crows. Adventurous tales.\n\nRuth Chew, Magic in the Park, 1972, approximate. Definitely this one! \"It is winter, and Jennifer Mace is new to Brooklyn. She visits Prospect Park and meets an old man who feeds the birds, a raven named Napoleon, and a boy named Michael Stewart. Jen and Michael explore a magic island in the lake that turns into an underground tunnel, and a magic tree that temporarily turns them into pigeons. In the spring, Jen gets a bike for her birthday, but a mean boy named Steve tries to steal it. Mike helps her get it back, but almost gets stuck as a pigeon!\"\n\nChew, Ruth, Magic in the Park. Sounds like Magic in the Park. If thats not the right one, it could be another one by Ruth Chew, like The Wishing Tree or The Secret Tree-House~from a librarian.\n\nRuth Chew, Magic in the Park. I am sure that the book you are looking for is Magic in the Park by Ruth Chew. Plot summary: \"Jenny and her friend Mike discover a magic tree and an old man who feeds the birds in the park. They discover that the tree moves around and that they can go underground and become birds with the help of the magic beech tree.\"\n\nRuth Chew, Magic in the Park, 1974, approximate. I am the original requester. I recognized it immediately. I also recognized the plot of the story from some of your stumper solver comments. Yay. I am so happy. It's really been bugging me trying to find this book. I really want my children to read it, cuz I loved it so much. I see they reprinted it in the 80's, so it must have been pretty popular.\n\nMagic Island\n\nI read this book in the early 1970s when I was about 10 or 12. It is about an orphan girl who is taken in by a rich shipping family in NY or Boston. She is small of stature. The family that takes her in has a daughter her age and an older daughter (18, maybe) who is newly married to the captain of one of the familyï¿½s ships. She goes with the two daughters on a sea voyage to Barbados where she lives on a sugar cane plantation. Because of her small stature, she is able to rescue a young child from a well, which makes her feel better about her size.\n\nMady Lee Chastain, Magic Island,1964. Every detail matches. It's an interesting cultural artifact, and a book that couldn't be written today. Set in the early 1850s, Barbados is depicted as a beautiful, idyllic place, with the dark shadow of slavery lying upon it nearly unnoticed - although the protagonist, Angel, has relationships with some of the slaves! My copy is a withdrawn library copy with the usual defects, but no story pages missing.\n\n---\n\ni remember really enjoying this book but the details in my mind are sketchy. a few girls were taken on a trip, probably with relatives, to a tropical island. i remember that there was a friend named dodie, who thought she wasn't included. when informed of the trip, she said, i h-hope you all have a good time, sniffling. and the person taking them on the trip said, why, dodie, dear! and informed her that of course she was going along. i don't know when it was printed, but i read the book in the sixties. thanks.\n\nI've been looking for this book too. For some reason, I think it's by the author of the Best Friends, books, Mary Bard, if that's any help.\n\nI found it! \"There was a muffled sniffling near the door. It was Dodie putting on her cloak. \"I---I---I hope you all have a wonderful time,\" she said tearfully. \"Dodie!\" cried Aunt Abbie. \"Dodie, dear. It includes you, too.\" From page 45 of Magic Island by Madye Lee Chastain (1964). Angel Thorne, a sickly ten year old, is sent to stay with her grandfather's boyhood friend. He decides to send her to Barbados to recuperate, along with his granddaughter Lissa, and her two friends, Emmy and Dodie. This is the third book Madye Lee Chastain wrote about these girls. The first, Dark Treasure (1954), is about Lissa and her cousin Andy, the captain of a clipper ship. In the second, Emmy Keeps a Promise (1956), Emmy and Lissa encourage a romance between Emmy's sister, Arabel, and Lissa's cousin, Andy. By the third book, Magic Island, Arabel and Andy are married, and they take Angel, Lissa, Emmy and Dodie to Barbados. I don't think Dodie ever got her own book!\n\n---\n\nI remember reading this book during the sixties. It was about three children- all girls, I think- who were taken on a trip to a tropical island. I think two of them belonged to the same family. The third was named Dodie, and she thought she wasn't invited. She cried, \"I hope you all have a very nice time,\" and then some adult in the romm said, \"Why, Dodie! Dodie, DEAR! Of course you are invited too.\"\n\nMadye Lee Chastain, Magic Island. This is the same book as T104, which has been solved. It is MAGIC ISLAND, by Madye Lee Chastain.\n\nMagic Key\n\nAs a child born in 1949, my parents bought many books for my sisters and I to read. One of my favorites was a book about a little boy and girl who were walking along and found an unusual key. The key fit into a keyhole in a toadstool and unlocked the door into fairyland. The children sailed down a river on a leaf and met the queen of the fairies. I thought the book might be a Little Golden Book, but I have been informed by a collector that this is probably not true. Do you know of any book written or published around that time that would fit the description? Any suggestions on ways to locate the title. Thank you for your help.\n\nK1: this book was called The Key That Fit Fairyland I read it in first grade and we used it for a school play. I too thought it was a Little Golden Book.\n\nWell, I looked it up and there is no LGB, Wonder or Elf title exactly like that.\n\nThere was another series of books in the 1950's that was similar to Little Golden Books called Jolly Books. One of the Jolly Book titles is The Magic Key - perhaps this is the book.\n\nI too had a 20 year search for this book after giving our copy to a doctors office when I was a child. My sister (born in 1949) always held me responsible for losing \"her book\" so we had a 20 year quest along the east coast to find it. My first bit of luck was finding the cover in an antique shop (near home), the shop owner thought it was cute and that someone might want to frame it. It was a bargain at 5 cents. It gave us a starting point. The book is The Magic Key by Mary Francis, illustrated by Sylvia Holland it was published by Jolly Books NY , Avon\n\nPublishing, with a copyright of 1952. I called my sister in VA for the storyline (since after locating it from a book dealer, I gave it to her for Christmas in 1998). The storyline is, Tommy and his sister are walking through the woods when they find a key on the ground, They look around and notice a hole in a large rock or boulder and when they put the key in, they are transported to a new place. In this place the toadstools seem to grow (or are they getting smaller?) and as they explore they come across fairies and elves building tables and benches. They meet the head elf, Gruffy who asks them how they got there and if they know the magic words. Tommy tells him the only magic words he knows are \"by hickory and by dickory\" (which happen to be some of \"the magic words of the elves\" ) and Gruffy takes them off to the Queen Fairy to decide what should be done with them. They go to the biggest tree in the forest and a door opens for them to enter. Once inside they meet the queen and it is decided that the children will have to stay till after the Queen's party. The children get to see the fairy party dresses and Tommy gets to sail in an Oak leaf boat.(about 3 pages from the end of the book is a full page illustration of Tommy in the boat.) Whoever was asking about this book had a pretty good recollection to remember the boat part. For me it was the fairy party, the toadstools and the Big rock with the keyhole.\n\n---\n\nHi - hope someone can help me find the titles/authors/sources of 2 stories I dimly remember from many years ago. ... The other had a child, boy I think, finding a mysterious key which opens a door in an old stone wall - I think a horse and a crow or raven also appear in there somewhere. Anybody out there ever read anything that sounds like these beginnings? I can't remember anything more than that, and would like to know how the stories finished!\n\nThe second story ounds like stumper S69 stone wall holds key to mystery\n\nFrances Hodgson Burnett, The Secret Garden, 1911. Regarding the second part of this request: There are two main boy characters in this story, and a girl- she finds a key to a locked garden, and helps her cousin to discover the real world, after being bed-ridden all his life. They make friends with Dickon- a boy from the moors or dales, who has a pony and a crow or some other bird.\n\nI think I missed the second part of this one previously. Also check out The Magic Key on the Solved Mysteries page, that's one that eluded me for a long time since it sounded much like The Secret Garden, but clearly wasn't.\n\n---\n\n1955. This was an illustrated story of a brother and sister who found a gold key in the woods. It opened a tiny door at the base of a large tree, and that led them into fairyland.

At the end the lollipop is used up, and then turns into a banjo.\n\nmy apologies that i forgot about checking back for the past few weeks--it was only when i looked tonight that i saw the response. this is exactly, precisely the book i was thinking about. thanks--i look forward to finding this for my three daughters who, like their mother, enjoy their sweets.\n\nMagic Meadow\n\nA child in a very drab school (orphanage?) can transport to another (better)place with the power of his/her mind.

All I know is content, and a lot of it. I am 33 years old, so that may at least lend a clue as to the age of the book; it was my book as a 6 to 10 year old. The book begins when a magician (could the magician's name be Milicent or that may be the little girl's name?) calls a little girl on stage and turns her current doll or some other toy she is holding into a new doll. She is not very happy about this and I believe the magician convinces her to spend the next week or so with her new doll and see if she likes her more; if not she is to come back and he will magically return her other doll (or toy). The little girl (her name may be Melinda or that may be the doll's name) takes the doll with her on several different 'travels' including a hot air balloon ride and, I believe, a steamer ship voyage. I think her parents buy matching clothing for the girl and her doll. Anyway, by the end of the week or so, the little girl does become fond of the new doll and when she returns to the magician she cannot bring herself to return the doll. Or maybe she does return the doll and then shortly after she returns because she decides she'd like the doll after all. I feel like maybe the little girl was English or perhaps she and her dad travel to England. At the risk of seeming a little nutty, I also seem to\n\nremember that the father traveled and brought the girl clothes for her and her doll or even maybe a different doll( to try and please her ) from one of his travels. I would be so happy if someone remembers this sweet story and can come up with a title or some other clue to this mystery.

I don't know the title, author, or year published, and I only have a sketchy memory of the story line. I recall a grandfather telling stories, possibly bedtime stories, to his grandchild. He wore spectacles as he told the stories. The grandchild found the spectacles and put them on, and he/she discovered that the grandfather saw the stories in the spectacles. It seems that I remember the story that the grandchild saw had something to do with fairies, possibly a fairy wedding.

There was a boy in his bed, who either couldn't sleep and was told a story about this night train, or dreamed of this train speeding through the countryside at night. Most of the illustrations were dark and pen-and-ink-like, and I specifically remember a page where the train was out of control and the boy or conductor (or both) were pulling back hard on the throttle to stop it. I believe the cover was dark, like night. It was a relatively thin hardback. I would love to find this book for my sister, who is now a reading teacher.

She eventually figures out that when she touches the stone at the same time as another girl (whom she doesn't know very well initially), something magical/supernatural occurs. For some reason I can recall the first girl walking across a field to get to the second girl's house. I definitely can picture a book cover, with a girl with long dark hair walking across a field. I think the word \"stone\" may be in the title but am not sure. The book was more \"dark\" than \"fun\" magical in tone.\n\nMight be Penelope Farmer, The Magic Stone. When I read the description I immediately thought of this book, and went looking for descriptions on the web to confirm. Couldn't find any, but I'll make the suggestion anyway.

I hope you can find a copy cheaper than $121, which was what was offered on amazon.com. I don't know why this book has become so important for me, but I am getting the strong desire to own the books that were important to me as a kid, and I hope I can find them here. I can think of no more rewarding collection that the pursuit of books one has loved.\n\nThank you so much for your info!! Magic Summer is out of print and it would be great if you could find a copy for me.\n\nInterpreting\n\nCondition\n\nGrades Streatfield, Noel. The Magic Summer. Illustrated by Edward Ardizzone. Random House, 1967. First edition. Ex-library copy with usual markings. G/G. <ON HOLD>\n\nMagic Tales - Holl\n\nThese are a mix of European, African and Asian tales, IIRC. One is about a tar ox that a farmer builds and that traps many useful animals; one is about hungry animals and a tree that drops its fruit only when the right word is spoken - the downtrodden, exhausted tortoise is the one who manages to find out the magic word and is lavished with gratitude; one is a version of \"Rapunzel\" in which she destroys the witch by cutting off her hair at the right moment; and one, my favorite, is about three girls, kidnapped one by one by a troll to be his houseslaves, only to be tricked by the youngest into carrying them all back home in sacks. The troll takes the form of a pig rooting in the cabbages in the beginning. My guess is that the book was compiled in the 60s or early 70s.\n\nI may have the answer to stumper A20- Anthology, multiethnic It may be MAGIC TALES retold by Frances Ross, Elisabeth Harner, Wilhemine Mohme, Stella M. Rudy and Eugene Bahn.Illustrated by Arthur Griffith, helen Osborn and Phoebe Flory. Published by Charles E. Merrill Company, 1946, 1950. The stories included are The Pig That Was Really a Troll; The Fisherman and His Wife; Little Daughter and the Lion; The Ugly Duckling; The Lost Axe; Rapunzel; The Bear and the Goblin; The Prince of Engalien; The Silver River; East O' the Sun and West O' the Moon; The Rabbit and the Monkey; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs; Cinderella; The Straw Ox; The Green Monkey; The Flying Ship; Blunder; The Emperor's New Clothes. I did not find one about a magic fruit tree and a tortoise. However, The Straw Ox matches the description. The Rapunzel in this book does kill the witch by cutting her hair at the right moment. And a troll (who turns himself into a pig) does kidnap three sisters (on three separate occasions) and the one sister saves them by making the troll bring sacks of wood to the mother, but instead of putting wood in the bag, a sister goes in instead. Illustartions are black and white. The person who wants this book should try to get it through his/her local library first to make sure it is the right one. At the very least, the person has the names of two of the stories- The Straw Ox; The Pig That Was Really a Troll.\n\nThanks, I'll assume it is Magic Tales. Now does anyone know how to find the story about the tree and the tortoise? Another detail: the other animals keep trying to find out the magic word but they all forget it on the way home, but the tortoise is more diligent and simply keeps repeating it as he returns.\n\n---\n\nThis is part of a collection, I think. The story I remember is about hungry animals and a tree that drops its fruit only when the right word is spoken - the animals keep travelling to find out the magic word but they all forget it on the way home. The downtrodden tortoise is more diligent and simply keeps repeating it as he returns and is lavished with gratitude. I think the word was something like \"Bonjo\".\n\nHow about this - The Bojabi Tree, by Edith Rickert, illustrated by Anna Braune, published originally in 1923, reprinted by Doubleday in 1959, 46 pages \"This once-popular picture book 'adapted from an African folk tale' will with its satisfying adventure, repetition of action, humor, and precise, colorful details, give fresh delight to kindergarten storytelling. In the land of All-the-Beasts, the so-HUNGRY animals seek the name of a strange fruit so that they may enjoy eating it. It looked like an APPLEORANGEPEARPLUMBANANA but it smelled like a BANANAPEARPLUMORANGEAPPLE. Four visits to King Leo are required before one of the creatures can remember the name of the fruit. Amusingly illustrated with pencil drawings.\" (Horn Book Feb/59 p.32)\n\nThe Bojabi Tree was published in at least one collection - Told Under the Magic Umbrella, collected by the Literature Committee of the Association for Childhood Education, illustrated by Elizabeth Orton Jones, published\n\nMacmillan 1939. The first story is Ask Mr. Bear, by Marjorie Flack, and the last one is Elsie Piddock Skips in Her Sleep, by Eleanor Farjeon.\n\nWell, Edith Rickert's version certainly fits the plot - but the one I'm looking for is much less cutesy - the animals have no names, IIRC, and they certainly don't wear clothes. In all, it's more streamlined. I remember that one animal forgets because he bumps his head and another because he falls and rolls and bites his tongue too often to pronounce the word properly. The one picture I remember is that of the tortoise looking sadly at the angry wise man.\n\nB96 bonjo: aha! there's another version of this story - The Bojabi Tree: a Folktale from Gabon, written and illustrated by Gerardo Suzan, published Scholastic, isbn 0590728903. I haven't been able to find a publication date or any more information though.\n\nThis sounds a lot like a book I spent years looking for... it turned out (in my case) to be an African Bantu folktale commonly known as The Name of the Tree. I found a nice description of it online about halfway down the page. One version is The Name of the Tree by Celia Lottridge. Sun-bleached illustrations by Ian Wallace are intended to convey the shimmering heat and noon-day mirage of the African landscape. In this Bantu tale from Africa, a humble tortoise saves his hungry animal friends. Only those who know the name of the tree can reach its fruit. When haughty Gazelle and Elephant fail to bring the tree's name all the way back from the king, Tortoise attempts the task. On his journey, Tortoise repeats the name over and over until he reaches the foot of the tree, where the branches respond by bending down to the waiting animals. An enjoyable retelling conveying a theme common to folktales - effort and dedication succeed over talent and pride.\n\nB96 bonjo: another version is called The Magic Tree, and is found with other stories in The Magic Horns, by Forbes Stuart, illustrated by Charles Keeping, published Abelard Schuman 1974. \"The Hare and the Tortoise\n\napparently originated with the Hottentots - and it is good to see our old friend Tortoise once again the hero, in a delightful story called 'The Magic Tree', the humour of which is typical of these African tales. Charles Keeping's running lion, prancing ox and snapping alligator add to the delight of this collection.\" (Children's Books of the Year 74, p.42)\n\nI posted both stumpers and here's the real answer to both: Magic Tales, retold by Adelaide Holl, 1964. The contents are similar to the other identical title, but not quite. They are (in this order): The Bojabi Tree, Wishing Gate, Cat and the Parrot, Cinderella; Five Peas in a Pod, The Flying Ship; Golden Pears, East O' the Sun and West O' the Moon; The Lost Axe; The Monkey's Heart, Troll of the Cave, The Silver River; Prince of Uppland, The Rabbit and the Monkey; Rapunzel; The Straw Ox; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs; The Steadfast Tin Soldier, & The Tinderbox. Three tales are from India. The illustrations, unfortunately, are annoyingly generic. Other than that, the collection is unique and quite good.\n\nMagic to Burn\n\nLeprechaun on a ship with two siblings (stow away on return from Ireland?) He speaks in a code. The book would have been published by 1974 or so. I think it had the word \"Magic\" in the title. I think it opened with two siblings on a ship? returning from a family trip to Ireland? and finding a little man? leprechaun? who has stowed away/accidentally gotten packed in their luggage? I don't remember anything about the plot, but the key detail that sticks with me is that the little man writes letters that sound like advertisements and dry announcements of boring information, but if you count every ten? words, you can figure out the hidden message.\n\nI am not sure about the secret language part, but Ruth Sawyer's Enchanted Schoolhouse has to do with an Irish lad bringing a leprechaun to America! Might be worth a look!\n\nI can't identify the book but was wondering if it might be one of Patricia Lynch's many books possibly one of her Brogeen books.\n\nL99 I think this one may MAGIC TO BURN by Jean Fritz, 1964. It is technically a boggart that stows away with them on the ship, but I remember thinking that the illustrations or description made him sound like a leprechaun. I don't remember him speaking in code, but that doesn't mean he didn't. I think he travels with them because the woods are being torn down to make a road. He comes to America and is really freaked out. Magic happens when he smokes his pipe. I think it ends with the boggart knowing some important information or having an important document of a famous author, which helps the children's father who is a historian/professor/writer? ~from a librarian\n\nL99 Fritz, Jean Magic to burn illus by Beth and Jo Krush Coward, 1964. Irish boggart [like a leprechaun] goes to America - secret code - every 10th word gives the message\n\nMagic Touch\n\nI thought this book was titled The Magic Cookbook, but I haven't been able to find it under that title. I do not know the author's name. I can only date it to the 1980s or earlier (probably earlier). It was a fictional book for young adults. I seem to recall the book was bound with a rough-textured material and it had a very bland, beige color. Here is what I remember of the plot, setting and characters: There were 3 (?) children (I believe there were two boys, one very small, and a girl) who lived at a house on a beach for the summer. I think this was a European setting. Their parents may not have been there. They had a (new?) cook named Fanchon who delighted in cooking rich, fancy foods, which the children could not stand. There was another boy who lived down the beach from them, I think, and they all became friends and he helped them out whenever he could. One day, they found a cookbook filled with magic recipes. This was a lifesaver to the three siblings, since they were starving for not being able to eat the cook's food. Following these recipes they were able to transform their group into various animals. One time they changed into dogs. Another time they changed into cats. Still another time they changed into birds. The recipes involved simple foods and incantations. For example, to change into cats, they had to cook hamburger seasoned with catnip, then recite the incantation, and then eat the prepared meal. Then they'd all lay down for a nap and when they woke up they would be a cat (etc.). They would have to eat a prepared remedy to turn back into humans. As cats, for example, they had to drink milk stirred with a crust of bread. I also remember that the youngest boy always changed into something especially beautiful or different. I also seem to remember that at the end, they finally told Fanchon their problems with her cooking, and so she made them hot dogs (or somesuch).\n\nTHE MAGIC TOUCH by Peggy Bacon, 1968\n\nMagic Toyshop\n\nFor several years I have been trying to find out the name and details of a Christmas Play that we, as primary school children, performed in the 1970s. I remember that it began in a toy shop, and that the toys somehow came to life. There was an old toymaker involved. Pinocchio and Gepetto were in the play, but I don't know whether this play was \"Pinocchio\". There were various songs involved, and I remember being one of a group of 'dancing dollies'. We sang something like \"Look at how we go, all the little dancing dollies, look at how we go, round and round on tip tip toe\" as we danced. I seem to remember a 'train' being involved as well. There were also groups of other toys who had various song/dance routines to perform. Does anybody in Cyberspace recognize this play?\n\nThe standard musical adaptation is John Morley, Pinocchio -- lots of song & dance, but I don't think it's the play you recall. Thre is a musical by Patricia Clapp called The Magic Toyshop, but I don't know anything more than the title. She's been writing since the early '70s.\n\nThanks for your e-mail. The reply certainly sounds promising and I am keen to find more information about \"The Magic Toy Shop\" as it could well be the play that I recall. A search on the internet\n\nuncovered a play by Patricia Clapp called something like \"The Toys That Took Over Christmas\" about some toys in a toy shop that were brought to life, but was advertised as being a 10th anniversary performance, which dates it to 1990. Perhaps Patricia Clapp has written several plays along similiar lines -- the play I recall was performed by us as seven or eight year olds in about 1975 or 1976. As well as groups of toys having their own songs, I seem to recall a toy train taking all the toys to a location outside the toy shop. Pinocchio had a leading role, but I am pretty sure that this was not a musical adaptation of the Pinocchio story. Hopefully someone might have details about \"The Magic Toy Shop\". Thank You! [And later...]\n\nThanks to everyone who thought about the possible answer to my stumper.I have actually found out the answer, which is quite different from what I expected it to be. Eventually I managed to find an e-mail address for my old primary school of 25 years ago, and wrote to ask about the play I remembered. After making various enquiries, the Principal wrote me and said that the play I recall was written by a group of teachers after they had gathered ideas from the children, and incorporated various popular songs. They called it The Magic Toybox, but it is no longer known if a script exists or ever did exist. It's great to have an answer after wondering about this for so long.\n\n"
