        "text": "Owen Wilson to be father for third time\n\nby IANS |\n\nLos Angeles, Sep 28 : Actor Owen Wilson, who has already two children with two different former girlfriends, is going to be a father for a third time.\n\nAccording to pagesix.com, the 49-year-old star is expecting a child with Varunie Vongsvirates, 34.\n\nEarlier, there were reports that the \"Wonder\" star underwent a paternity test, after a third woman came forward claiming that he was the father of her unborn child.\n\nNow it is believed that Vongsvirates, whose LinkedIn lists her job as a business development representative for American Addiction Centres here, is that mystery woman.\n\nVongsvirates on Thursday shared several posts on Instagram about the pregnancy. A recent post showing her and Wilson at the premiere of his movie \"Father Figures\" was captioned \"father figure\".\n\nWhen a follower asked if Owen is the father, Vonsvirates responded \"Yes\".\n\nOwen fathered seven-year-old Robert Ford, born in 2011, with Jade Duell, and had his second child with personal trainer Caroline Lindqvist, who was married at the time.\n\nLatest Cinema Updates"
