        "text": "The ‘Wedding Crashers’ star, Owen Wilson could be a father-of-three, a source told Us Weekly. A woman recently approached Owen and claimed that she was, in fact, carrying his child, according to the source. Owen, 49, has decided to undergo a paternity test to ensure the claims are accurate.\n\nThe source further revealed, “Owen has been a great father to his two boys and has maintained a warm and close relationship with their mothers. Of course, if a paternity test establishes that he is the father of another child, he will fulfill all of his obligations to support his child.”\n\nThe actor already shares a 7-year-old son, Robert Ford, with his ex-girlfriend Jade Duell. He also shares a second son with his ex-girlfriend Caroline Lindqvist. He is a 4-year-old named Finn Wilson. In February 2014, a source told US Weekly that Wilson has an active role in Finn’s life ever since he was born. “He has been visiting his new baby almost every day,” the source told US Weekly. “He lives right around the corner and comes by for a little bit of time each afternoon. He is planning to be a part of the baby’s life and providing financial support.”\n\nBack in June 2017, Owen appeared on ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ and talked about being a father of two. He said: “Ford seems like he might even be a little stuntman in training,” Owen said before showing a video of his son doing a belly flop off a diving board. “Anything Ford says is just the funniest thing ever. And I can make a joke, and it’s, like, crickets. It’s like nothing from those guys.” He added: “Sometimes it feels more like I’m already seeing how they’re gonna be as teenagers, where they’re gonna sort of be ganging up on me.”\n\nHe added: \"We went to Sequoia National Park and they have the biggest tree in the world. Ford's like, 'I've seen bigger.' I’m like, ‘Well, no, Ford, actually you haven't seen bigger, this is the biggest tree in the world. He's like, 'If you say so,'\" he joked.\n\nOwen sure seems like he is a great father. He even took his sons to the ‘Cars 3’ premier with him. He even seems to great with his ex-girlfriends.\n\nIn 2014, Caroline gave birth to Finn, and even though they were 'not in a relationship,' they decided to have a baby, reported the Daily Mail. She opened up about their camaraderie before her due date and said, “Owen and I decided to have a child even though we're not in a relationship. And we're not planning on starting a relationship, either.”\n\nShe added, “Owen and I are two close friends having a baby together. We are really looking forward to it and can't wait to welcome our child at the end of January.”\n\nDaily Mail also reported that a source told E! - “She is just happy that Owen is helping her out any way that he can.” Owen was extremely supportive throughout Caroline’s pregnancy, “They have an amicable relationship and [care about] what's best for their unborn child,\" E! quoted the source as saying.\n\nOwen had an extremely close relationship with his own father, so it makes sense that he would do anything for his two sons.\n\nBack in 2015, Owen opened up about his father’s Alzheimer’s for the first time in an interview with Guide Live. He said: “It’s one of those things where if somebody had said 10 years ago, when my dad and I were joking around, having a putting match, that this is the position your dad’s going to be in, where he basically needs 24-hour care, you’d think, ‘Gosh, I won’t be able to handle that. That’s just not possible.’ But it does happen. Such things just happen in life. You just have to do your best to deal with it. You’ve got no choice but to accept it. And then, you sort of still look for the things to be grateful for. He is at home, taken care of, and he has people around that love him. For me and my brothers, there just wasn’t a bigger influence on us. Maybe it sounds trite or something, but I really believe that his spirit gets carried on through me, the way I like to joke around.”\n\nOwen also opened up about being a parent himself in the interview. He said: “There’s a lot of stress inherent in being a parent. And worrying about your children and wanting them to be OK. When they’re born, you feel this love you’ve never felt before. If they were in danger, you’d just do anything that you could to help them.”"
