        "text": "Owen Wilson is reportedly set to become a father for a third after taking a paternity test.\n\nThe American actor is expecting a child with Varunie Vongsvirates, according to reports in the US.\n\nAnd it's said that the Zoolander and Marley and Me star, 49, took a paternity test during the summer to determine whether or not he was the biological father, according to Page Six .\n\nVarunie has been excitedly sharing her pregnancy on social media, posting a picture of her baby scan on Instagram in June, reports the Mirror .\n\nShe captioned the picture: \"Say hello to Lyla 3 months to go!\"\n\nLast month, Varunie shared a picture of herself stood alongside Owen at the premiere of his film, Father Figures.\n\nShe captioned it: \"#fatherfigure\"\n\nOne follower commented: \"Yay! Finally Owen gets a little girl I bet she s gonna mean the world to him\"\n\n\"he's going to make an awesome #fatherfigure,\" another said.\n\nAnd one wrote: \"Girls are always daddy's girls! I'm sure Lyla will have Owen wrapped around her little finger. She's lucky to have you both as parents\"\n\nVarunie also replied to a fan who asked if Owen was the father of her baby, saying: \"Yes\".\n\nOwen already has two sons, Ford, seven, who he shares with ex-girlfriend Jade Duell, and four-year-old Finn, who he shares with personal trainer Caroline Lindqvist.\n\nIt was reported in June that Owen immediately offered to take a paternity test after finding out Varunie was pregnant and pledged to be a supportive dad if the baby was his.\n\nA source at the time said: \"Owen has been a great father to his two boys and has maintained a warm and close relationship with their mothers.\n\n\"Of course if a paternity test establishes that he is the father of another child, he will fulfill all of his obligations to support his child.\"\n\nSpeaking about faterhood recently, Owen said: \"Sometimes it feels more like I'm already seeing how they're going to be as teenagers where they're sort of ganging up on me.\n\n\"We went to Sequoia National Park and they have the biggest tree in the world.\n\n\"Ford's like, 'I've seen bigger.' I'm like, 'Well no, Ford, actually you haven't seen bigger, this is the biggest tree in the world. He's like, 'If you say so'.\"\n\nOwen's representatives did not want to comment when contacted by Mirror Online."
