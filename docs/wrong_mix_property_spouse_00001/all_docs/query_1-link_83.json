        "text": "Movie star Owen Wilson is a father of three, but he reportedly only pays attention to two of his children. Wilson has not even met his one and only daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActor Owen Wilson is a dad to two sons, Finn and Robert, with whom he shares with two different women. During an appearance on the now-defunct \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in 2017, he talked about parenting his two older boys.\n\nThe Academy Award nominee shared his sons were funnier than him, adding that his oldest, Robert, whom he casually calls, Ford, was the most amusing.\n\nActor Owen Wilson pictured watching play from the stands during the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge on August 14, 2022 in London | Source: Getty Images\n\n\"It's unbelievable. Anything Ford says is the funniest thing ever, and I can make a joke, and it's crickets. It's like nothing from those guys,\" he said.\n\nWilson shares his firstborn with his former girlfriend, Jade Duell, whom he reportedly broke up with back in 2011. In December 2020, People reported that the doting dad was spotted in Maui, Hawaii, with his then-3-month-old son and significant other, Duell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former couple took their son out in LA and brought him to Valentine's Day dinner with pal Woody Harrelson, just a month after Robert was born.\n\nComedian Owen Wilson attending the \"You, Me and Dupree\" London Premiere | Source: Getty Images\n\nIn December 2011, Wilson was spotted with Robert and his mother at a Santa Monica park. Duell also watched her son while playing on the slide and jungle gym.\n\nThe BAFTA Award winner captured the moments on camera, and since his eldest child's birth, he visited the mother and son duo at Duell's Hawaii home.\n\nOwen Wilson attending the \"Flight of the Phoenix\" Los Angeles Premiere | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson and Duell welcomed their son in January 2011. He admitted in an interview with Access Hollywood that he was never interested in newborn babies, but that changed when he had his first child: \"I was never like somebody who was like, 'Oh my gosh, it's a baby! Let me hold it,\" the Texas native confessed.\n\nHe added babies are sensitive but that things become different when they are the parent. Wilson said one gains confidence when they have kids:\n\n\"They're so fragile, but then when it is your own, all of a sudden you feel a lot more confident. You really do have this bond, this real connection with this thing that a month ago wasn't even here It is strange... Their cries are like beautiful music!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson welcomed his second son, Finn, with fitness trainer Caroline Lindqvist in January 2014. He opened up about fatherhood in August 2021 during an interview with Esquire via Us Magazine.\n\nThe \"Zoolander\" star shared that he takes pride in storytelling for his sons at night, adding one of them advised him to do something about it. However, he admitted to not being a great cook, \"I make pretty good sandwiches,\" the Golden Globe nominee joked.\n\nWilson also recalled trimming Finn's fingernails, and he asked him not to go \"below the line,\" but he told him to \"relax.\" He asked his youngest son to thank him, and he did, while also whispering, \"for nothing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proud dad reportedly lives closer to his exes, and they all get along well. Wilson raises his children on a \"single-dad schedule.\"\n\nIn August 2021, his younger brother Luke Wilson revealed that his nephews were big fans of their films, especially the superhero ones. Luke stars in \"Supergirl\" while Wilson appears in \"Loki.\"\n\nLuke plays STRIPE in the DC Comics adaptation as a former superhero sidekick. Meanwhile, Marvel Studios cast his older brother as Mobius, a detective.\n\nWhen Wilson appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" in November 2017, he shared photos of his sons in costumes and talked about the kind of father he was.\n\nWhen asked whether he was strict, the \"Wedding Crashers\" star said, \"I'm only strict about manners,\" adding he was old-fashioned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson Wants Nothing to Do With His Third Child\n\nWhile Wilson lovingly talked about his sons, he came under fire for allegedly neglecting his forgotten child. The Hollywood A-Lister is also a parent to a daughter named Lyla, whom he has not met since birth.\n\nHe shares the child with his ex-girlfriend Varunie Vongsvirates whom he dated for five years. In October 2021, the Vongsvirates revealed to the Daily Mail that Wilson wanted nothing to do with their daughter, whom they welcomed on October 9, 2018.\n\nMoreover, he was not present for childbirth. It remains unclear what happened between him and Lyla's mom, but he refused to be named her father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same year Lyla was born, a source reported that Wilson \"refuses to meet his daughter. He even checked the 'no visitation box' in court. He does not want to visit [and does not] want any custody of her.\"\n\nThe \"Marley & Me\" star voluntarily took a paternity test after Vongsvirates claimed she was pregnant with his child. The test results ruled Wilson as the biological father of Lyla.\n\nHe knew that the business development rep was pregnant at four weeks old. After learning that Vongsvirate was expecting, he never made contact even after birth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2019, Vongsvirate told the Daily Mail that Wilson was \"not involved at all\" in his daughter's life. She even had to beg him to make an effort.\n\nWhen questioned about the involvement, she noted that it was \"ironic\" that the comedian plays fatherly roles in films but could not be there for his daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Lyla needs a father. It's ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he's playing a father in his new movie, and he's never met his daughter,\" the mother of one expressed.\n\nThat said, Wilson still appears to show no interest in being a part of Lyla's life despite her mother's wish for them to meet one day. When the youngster turned three years old in October 2021, Vongsvirate posted a photo of the birthday girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to social media users, Lyla \"looks just like Owen Wilson;\" she has blonde hair and has his blue eyes. Wilson only pays child support, but to Vongsvirate, that is not as important as being a present parent: \"Owen has never met Lyla. Never. He helps financially, but it's never been about that,\" she said.\n\nNow, Lyla's mother shares photos of her daughter on social media without any mention of Wilson. For her birthday in 2022, Lyla's mother shared a photo of her daughter and called her sweet as followers praised the mother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust after Lyla was born, her mother took her on a vacation and shared photos of the scenery as well as photos of Lyla wearing cute outfits and seemingly enjoying herself. Lyla's mother mentioned they were enjoying themselves.\n\nOwen Wilson and his son at the 2022 MLS Cup Playoffs | Source: Getty Images\n\nWhile Wilson shares a relationship with both his sons, he does not have any sort of relationship with his daughter and doesn't want \"any custody of her.\" However, her mother gave her a Thai middle name, Aranya, to honor her father's heritage."
