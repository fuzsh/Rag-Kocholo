        "text": "OWEN Wilson is proving the ultimate comeback kid.\n\nThe Hollywood star is embarking on a more positive chapter in his life and says fatherhood is the best role yet\n\nHis “annus horribilis” four years ago saw him taken to hospital amid an alleged suicide attempt, following a rumoured split with You, Me And Dupree co-star Kate Hudson.\n\nBut fast forward to the present day and it looks like the actor’s life is back on track.\n\nReturning to top comic form with roles in Fantastic Mr Fox, Little Fockers and new comedy Hall Pass.\n\nOwen’s personal life is also on the up. He’s enjoying being a dad and is very proud after welcoming his baby son Robert Ford to the world on January 14 with girlfriend Jade Duell.\n\n“He is cute. I’ve played a father in movies a few times but now I’m doing it for real,” he boasts, chuckling.\n\nThe 42-year-old admits the couple have it easy with their son. “We’ve been really lucky and I have been getting sleep. The baby seems really quiet and he’s not a crier,” he says in his recognisable Texan twang. “He’s a little Zen baby, you know? He always seems really relaxed.”\n\nFortunately, he got some practise with children in Hall Pass, as Wilson’s character Rick has three children with wife Maggie (Jenna Fischer).\n\nWritten and directed by comic siblings Peter and Bobby Farrelly of There’s Something About Mary and Dumb And Dumber fame – and also featuring an appearance by former Warwick University funnyman Stephen Merchant – the premise of the movie follows a “hall pass” from the movie’s long-suffering wives giving permission for the guys to misbehave.\n\nWhile the buddies reminisce over the carefree days of their former youth, in reality, it doesn’t quite turn out to be the respite they expected.\n\nStroking his famously crooked nose, Owen explains: “For a lot of men, it would seem like a dream come true. You remember back when you were single, going out to bars.\n\n“But it’s a double-edged sword. If you’re going to get a hall pass, that means your wife is too – and chances are they might have more luck than you.”\n\nThe actor, who has been linked to Rachel McAdams, Jennifer Aniston and Sheryl Crow in the past, reckons his unconventional looks and Hollywood status don’t offer any assistance in the dating stakes.\n\n“It’s never as easy as you’d like,” he admits.“Just try to make them laugh,” he suggests. “But I do think it’s a myth that men pick up women. Girls let it be known that they’re interested in you.”"
