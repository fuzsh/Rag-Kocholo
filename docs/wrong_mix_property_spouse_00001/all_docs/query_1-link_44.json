        "text": "In the fall of 2022, Byron-Bergen Central School District joined the Lifting Our School Community Challenge through the Genesee Area Healthcare Plan (GAHP) in partnership with Excellus BCBS.\n\nThe Lifting Our School Community Challenge is aligned with the internationally recognized initiative “The Lift Project,” created by award-winning educator, researcher, and well-being expert Dr. Darren Morton (PhD, FASLM). The Lift Project was designed to help individuals live a happier life by providing tools and tips to help “lift” your overall wellness.\n\nAccording to an article published by the American Psychological Association, “Spending time in nature is linked to both cognitive benefits and improvements in mood, mental health, and emotional well-being.”\n\nThrough the Lifting Our School Community Challenge, Byron-Bergen School District secured funding to begin a revitalization and maintenance project for the established Nature Trail on the district campus.\n\nThis project includes updated and increased signage created by BB engineering students as well as the newly created Star Trail in the Northeast quadrant of the woods.\n\nUsing the provided funds, students in Byron-Bergen High School’s Home Maintenance and Repair class were able to create new trail signage, including a Welcome Area and trail markers throughout the woods.\n\nByron-Bergen 11th-grade student Brody Baubie acted as team leader with the guidance of teachers Marc Palmer and Jay Wolcott. Brody created scale models and identified the necessary materials and techniques for his designs to take shape.\n\n“This has been a good learning experience for me”, said Brody. “It helped me see and overcome challenges, problem-solving, and finding resources.” Brody is interested in carpentry work and plans to study construction management after graduation. The welcome kiosk he designed includes a roof and a sitting area.\n\nThe new trail map signage was geolocated and digitally designed by Buildings & Grounds Manager Roger Caldwell and Technology Teacher Marc Palmer and will be displayed in Brody’s welcome kiosk. Printing of the map signage was donated by Tom Chapell at Visual Impact Graphics in Byron, NY.\n\nThroughout the years, the Byron-Bergen Nature Trail has been maintained by several groups and individuals, both district employees as well as valued members of the Byron-Bergen community.\n\nIn the spirit of paying tribute to all of those who have helped to make the trail what it is today, Byron-Bergen Schools hosted a Grand Re-Opening Ceremony in June.\n\n“A big thank you to Roger Caldwell and the Byron-Bergen Grounds Crews as well as our technology teachers and students for their hard work making the trails fresh and inviting,” said Superintendent Pat McGee. “Thank you also to our team of staff Wellness Champions for their organization and planning of the project.”\n\nThe community is invited to enjoy the Nature Trail during daylight hours and dogs are welcome outside of school hours. The trail entrance is located behind the Elementary School and is visible from the road leading back to the softball field and soccer stadium."
