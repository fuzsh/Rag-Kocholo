        "text": "Wow.\n\nZoolander actor Owen Wilson reportedly pays $36,560 a month in child support to the mother of a daughter he’s never met.\n\nThe actor’s daughter, Lyla Aranya Wilson, was born in 2018 to on-off lover Varunie Vongsvirates, and new court documents seen by Radar Online reveal he pays $36,560 a month for her expenses.\n\nThe monthly child support payments amount to roughly $438,720 per year.\n\nIn the US, payments of this nature usually continue until the child turns 18.\n\nRELATED: Charlie Sheen allegedly owes thousands in unpaid child support\n\nRELATED: DNA test proves man who paid $58k in child support isn’t the dad\n\nAccording to The Sun, the 51-year-old actor demanded a DNA test when Vongsvirates claimed he was the father of her child.\n\nDocuments reveal he made a one-off payment of $103,128 to the mother to cover a night nurse, labour coach and Vongsvirates’ legal fees, plus his monthly child support instalment.\n\nWilson reportedly has a net worth of around $100 million.\n\nHe reportedly checked the “none” box under visitation rights on the document but agreed to add Lyla, now one, to his Screen Actors Guild medical insurance.\n\nThe pair dated for five years before they split for good in 2018.\n\nVongsvirates, 35, has sole custody of the child and can legally make all decisions regarding Lyla’s health, education and welfare.\n\nShe regularly posts pictures of the tot on her Instagram and confirmed the birth of her girl in October 2018, writing: “My sweet little princess. Lyla Aranya Wilson, born on 10-09-18.”\n\nEarlier in 2019 Vongsvirates told Mail Online that Wilson “helps financially but it’s never been about that”.\n\nAsking the actor to see his daughter, she added: “She’s incredible, you’re really missing out. She looks just like you.”\n\n“Lyla needs a father. It’s ironic how (Owen) keeps getting these father roles. He’s playing a father in his new movie, and he’s never met his own daughter,” she said.\n\nOwen is a father to two boys already.\n\nHe welcomed his son Robert Ford, 8, with ex-girlfriend Jade Duell, and his second son Finn, 5, with fitness trainer Caroline Lindqvist.\n\nWilson and Ms Lindqvist are thought to have struck up a romance again in recent months."
