        "text": "Actor Owen Wilson has kept quiet since it was revealed he is going to be a dad again - but his baby mama has broken ranks, revealing the platonic pair decided to have a child together, but not enter into a relationship.\n\nCaroline Lindqvist, 41, spoke to Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet and explained the situation behind the happy news.\n\n\"Owen and I are two close friends having a baby together,\" she told the paper. \"Owen and I decided to have a child even though we're not in a relationship. And we're not planning on starting a relationship, either\", she added.\n\nSwedish Lindqvist first met Wilson in 2003 and was reportedly romantically involved with him for a short time before they decided to have a baby together.\n\nIt is believed actor Wilson turned to the personal trainer after his suicide attempt in 2007, which is thought to have been caused by his split from actress Kate Hudson.\n\nThe married personal trainer filed for divorce from her doctor husband just after news broke she was pregnant. She insists her marriage breakdown had nothing to do with her new arrival.\n\nShe added: \"We are really looking forward to it and can't wait to welcome our child at the end of January.\"\n\nWilson, 44, is no longer with Caroline but a source said: “She’ll score big time by having his baby.”\n\nOwen’s ex Jade Duell has reportedly asked that Caroline does not give birth at his home in Hawaii, where she had their son Robert in 2011."
