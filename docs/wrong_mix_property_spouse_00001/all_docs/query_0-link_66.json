        "text": "Wedding Crashers taught an entire generation of moviegoers that the most fun parties are the ones where you don’t know anyone.\n\nThe film, released in July 2005, follows John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn), who attend strangers’ weddings as a method of picking up women. It works out very well until they meet Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) and her sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher), the daughters of an intimidating politician played by Christopher Walken.\n\nThe movie’s wild premise has left fans wanting a sequel for years. In June 2021, Wilson offered a glimpse of hope — revealing there had been talks about a round two.\n\n“Yeah, there is a script and David Dobkin — who directed the first one — has been working on it, and we’ve been talking about it,” he told Collider. “If we can come up with something we think could be great, then I’m sure we’ll do it.”\n\nFisher teased in January 2024 that the cast has been “really close” to getting a sequel made. She told E! News that she is keeping her “fingers crossed we make another one.”\n\nScroll down to see what the Wedding Crashers cast is doing now:"
