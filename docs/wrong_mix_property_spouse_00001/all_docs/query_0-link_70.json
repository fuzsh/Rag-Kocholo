Mobius in the Disney+ series Loki.\n\nOn February 11, 2022, his new movie Marry Me was released in theaters and on streaming service Peacock.\n\nHe stars opposite singer and actress Jennifer Lopez in the movie and co-stars Maluma, Sarah Silverman, and John Bradley.\n\nWhat is Owen Wilson's net worth?\n\nOwen is reportedly worth $70million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nHis films have generated more than $2.25billion in the USA and Canada, with an average of $75million per film."
