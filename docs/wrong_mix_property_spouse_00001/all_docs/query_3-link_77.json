        "text": "Owen Wilson has had a successful career in the film industry, appearing in films such as Starsky & Hutch, Wedding Crashers, and in the Woody Allen film Midnight in Paris.\n\nHowever, on a personal level, Wilson has had a rather tumultuous period. He is said to ‘refuse’ to meet his daughter, Lyla, and even checked the no visitation box in court.\n\nThe little girl just turned 3 years old, and her mother, Varunie Vongsvirates shared a picture of Lyla on her birthday. It’s easy to say that she’s the lookalike of Owen Wilson.\n\nWhen thinking about Owen Wilson, one might not recognize him as a top-notch actor. He’s been in many romantic comedies, and for many experts and film critics, it’s a genre that isn’t quite as “important” when compared to thrillers or drama.\n\nHowever, when looking into Owen Wilson’s career, it’s safe to say that he’s conquered many genres. Over the course of his film industry life, he’s shown off skills in many genres, claiming a spot as one of the top actors in Hollywood.\n\nOwen Wilson â daughter Lyla\n\nThe Academy Award-nominated actor has had a long and successful career, and at the same time, he’s been involved in several relationships. He has two sons from two previous relationships, and in 2018, his daughter Lyla was born.\n\nHowever, Owen Wilson has never seen his daughter, with sources to US Magazine saying that the actor refuses to meet her. It’s quite a tragic story when read through the eyes of a parent, however, Lyla looks to be doing great.\n\nShe recently celebrated her 3rd birthday â and a new picture reveals that she is the spitting image of her father.\n\nOwen Wilson â career\n\nBorn on November 18, 1968, in Dallas, Texas, Wilson had quite a tough childhood. He was very restless, and in private school, he got suspended due to “various incidents of prankery, wisecracking and charming but irritating insubordination.”\n\nAs a result, Wilson enrolled in a New Mexico military school after recommendations from his brother Andrew.\n\n“After heâd been expelled from our high school and he went to New Mexico Military Institute, my dad and I went to visit him,” Owen’s second brother Luke Wilson recalled. “Itâs just barren desert and this fortress out there, and to me, it seemed like The Lords of Discipline. But then seeing Owen out there â buzz cut, uniform, his room and his locker, and how they had to walk in straight lines â he embraced all that. The last thing youâd think he would have taken to.”\n\nThe military school became a hugely different way of life for Wilson. And in fact, it was a turning point for which he is very grateful today.\n\nIf it wasn’t for military school, he could’ve been doing something completely different than working in the entertainment business.\n\nâIt was my roommate at military school who was good friends with [director] Wes Anderson, and thatâs how I ended up meeting Wes,” Wilson told ET Canada. “So we wouldâve never gotten into the entertainment industry.”\n\n“I got kicked out of school for cheating,” he added. “I had to ask permission to eat. Before every breakfast and every dinner for that first year as a new cadet, as a rat it was, ‘Excuse me, sir, could cadet recruit Wilson OC requests permission to use his hands, utensils, in the preparation, transportation, and consumption of his food and drink?'”\n\nSuccessful film career\n\nWhen Owen Wilson went on to study at the University of Texas, he met with Wes Anderson, one of Hollywood’s most respected filmmakers, and the two became friends.\n\nTheir common interest in movies became a partnership, and in 1996, they released their first feature film named Bottle Rocket.\n\nFrom there, Wilson’s career in the film industry skyrocketed. He appeared with Jackie Chan in the 2000 film Shanghai Noon, and at the same time, his friendship with Wes Anderson led him into writing as well.\n\nTogether with Anderson, he wrote three films: Rushmore (1998), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004), in which Wilson also starred.\n\nWith The Royal Tenenbaums, Wilson and Anderson were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nWilson went on to star in several, now classic, comedy films, including Starsky & Hutch, Wedding Crashers, as well as in the Woody Allen film Midnight in Paris. His career is still very much active, and while focusing on his career, Owen Wilson become a father of three.\n\nHowever, his private life has been quite tumultuous, especially regarding his 3-year-old daughter Lyla.\n\nOwen Wilson’s children\n\nIn 2011, Owen Wilson welcomed his firstborn son, Robert Ford Wilson, with then-girlfriend Jade Duell. Robert is named of Wilson’s father.\n\nThe two reportedly split shortly after their son was born.\n\nThree years later, he and Caroline Lindqvist had a boy, Finn Lindqvist Wilson.\n\nParenting his first two children was a wonderful time in Owen Wilson’s life. Speaking on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2017, the actor revealed that Finn idolized his older brother.\n\n“It’s unbelievable. I mean, anything Ford says is just like the funniest thing ever. And I can make and joke and it’s, like, crickets. It’s like nothing from those guys,” he said.\n\n“I’m already sort of seeing how they’re gonna be as teenagers, where they’re gonna be sort of be ganging up on me.”\n\nOne of the best things is telling his two sons stories at night, just like his dad used to do.\n\n“Sometimes telling the stories at night, you do take a little pride that these guys are into this story! One of them even said, âDad, you should do something with this. This is a really good story!’ It was about this little pack of boys in a post-apocalyptic world, and there’s a pack of dogsâI play to my audience,” he told Esquire.\n\nEven though Owen sounds like a magnificent dad, he never speaks about his young daughter, Lyla. And in fact, his relationship with his daughter and her mother Varunie Vongsvirates is very much a mystery.\n\nNever met his daughter Lyla\n\nLyla was born in 2018, and from the start, it seemed like Owen Wilson didn’t want anything to do with her.\n\nEarlier the same year, the 52-year old was said to have undergone a paternity test, after Vongsvirates claimed that he was the father, according to US Magazine.\n\nâOwen has been a great father to his two boys and has maintained a warm and close relationship with their mothers. Of course, if a paternity test establishes that he is the father of another child, he will fulfill all of his obligations to support his child,” the source said.\n\nMonths after Lyla’s birth, it was clear that Owen Wilson was uninterested in having a role in her life. US Weekly sources said that Wilson “refused” to meet Lyla. But from the start, it was very clear that she was the spitting image of him.\n\n“He even checked the no visitation box in court in June. He does not want to visit [and does not] want any custody of her,” the source said.\n\n“The baby looks just like Owen. “She has fair skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes.”\n\nLyla’s mother, Varunie Vongsvirates, sure isn’t happy with Owen Wilson regarding how he’s handled the situation with her beloved daughter.\n\nVarunie Vongsvirates speaks out\n\nSpeaking with The Daily Mail, Vongsvirates said that Wilson is “not involved at all” and has never met Lyla. However, she explained that he helps out in other ways.\n\n“He helps financially but itâs never been about that,” she said.\n\n“Lyla needs a father. Itâs ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he’s playing a father in his new movie, and he’s never met his own daughter.”\n\nIn 2017, Owen Wilson starred as the father in the movie Wonder. He and Vongsvirates dated for a number of years before splitting up.\n\nLyla was born on October 9, 2018, without Owen being by her side, and when speaking to the Mail, Vongsvirates had a message for him,\n\n“You should see your daughter, she’s incredible, you’re really missing out. She looks just like you.”\n\nLyla â spitting image of father Owen Wilson\n\nThere isn’t much known about Varunie, but through her Instagram page, she shares wonderful pictures of her life â as well as on Lyla.\n\nJust as she told the Daily Mail, Lyla really looks just like Owen Wilson. And a new picture, from her birthday celebration, definitely proves it.\n\nThe adoring mother posted a wonderful image of Lyla wearing a straw hat and a white sweater. With her wavy blond hair and blue eyes, she truly is the spitting image of her father!\n\n“Happy 3rd birthday to my wild child! I love you so much!!!!,” Varunie captioned the lovely photo.\n\nOn her Instagram page, Varunie has shared several pictures of Lyla over the years. And hopefully, she will soon get to see her father."
