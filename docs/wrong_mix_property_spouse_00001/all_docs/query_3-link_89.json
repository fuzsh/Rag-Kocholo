        "text": "The apple doesn’t fall far from the Wilson tree when it comes to looks. Actor Owen Wilson was snapped last night playing with his son Robert, who looks just like his old man.\n\nOut for a family dinner with Owen’s ex-wife Jade Duell, Robert had a ball running around with dad’s mobile phone in hand.\n\nOnce Owen caught up with him, the little guy got a big hug from dad and was then gently tossed in the air, providing the perfect moment for these happy snaps.\n\nAs the pictures show, Owen and Robert share an uncanny resemblance - the same Wilson eyes and shock of blonde hair.\n\nThis doting dad has been a bit reclusive lately, so it’s great to see him out and about with the family."
