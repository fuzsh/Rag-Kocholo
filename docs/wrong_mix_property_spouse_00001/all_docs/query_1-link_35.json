In celebration of the movie's big anniversary on July 1, 2023, we're checking up on its cast.\n\nKeep reading to see what the stars of \"Armageddon\" are up to (and look like) today…\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more fun celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\nBruce Willis starred as Harry S. Stamper, the best deep-sea oil driller in the world who becomes the Freedom shuttle leader, in \"Armageddon.\"\n\nMORE: \"Cheers\" cast: Where are they now?\n\n_\n\nAfter saving the world in \"Armageddon,\" Bruce Willis starred in a number of blockbuster action flicks including \"The Sixth Sense,\" \"Unbreakable,\" \"Sin City,\" \"Red,\" \"The Expendables 2\" and \"Looper.\" The two-time Emmy winner also reprised his role as John McClane in 2007's \"Live Free or Die Hard\" and 2013's \"A Good Day to Die Hard.\" He made his Broadway debut in 2015 in \"Misery\" and continued to act in various films the rest of the decade before his family announced his retirement in 2022 following a diagnosis of aphasia; in 2023 he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.\n\nJust a few days before \"Armageddon\" opened in 1998, Bruce and Demi Moore announced their split after more than a decade of marriage and three daughters together. In 2009, he married model Emma Heming, with whom he had two more daughters.\n\nMORE: Child stars: Where are they now?\n\n_\n\nBen Affleck starred as A.J. Frost, the hot-headed drill operator and Independence shuttle crew member who's dating Harry's daughter, \"in Armageddon.\"\n\n_\n\nBen Affleck was still a relative (Academy Award-winning) newcomer when \"Armageddon\" was released in 1998. Today, he's a certified movie star and respected director with two Oscars, three Golden Globes, two BAFTA Awards, two SAG Awards and a long list of successful films to his name. Over the last two decades, Ben's starred in well-received projects including \"The Sum of All Fears,\" \"Gone Girl\" and \"The Accountant\" and directed several critically acclaimed movies including \"Gone Baby Gone,\" \"The Town\" and \"Argo.\"\n\nBen also took on the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne in multiple DC Universe flicks such as \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" \"Justice League\" and \"The Flash.\" More recently, he starred in, directed and produced 2023's \"Air,\" a film about the launch of the Air Jordan shoe.\n\nThe star has also made headlines for his high-profile relationships — and two marriages — since the late '90s. After ending a three-year romance with Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben dated and proposed to Jennifer Lopez. But Bennifer called off their wedding in 2003 and split in early 2004. The same year, he began dating Jennifer Garner, whom he married in 2005. They broke up after 10 years of marriage, three kids and allegations of infidelity.
