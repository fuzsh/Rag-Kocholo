        "text": "We never imagined that Owen Wilson would have something in common with the handsome rapper Future, but he DOES! But Future is way ahead – he has 8 kids with 8 baby mamas while Owen only has 3 kids with 3 baby mamas. Wilson supports his two sons, Robert, 10, and Finn, 7, and gets long with the mamas, while spending time and acting like a father to the boys. It’s NOT the same for Wilson’s lookalike little girl Lyla. Wilson dated her mother Varunie Vongsvirates off and on for five years, and Lyla was born after they split up. Owen demanded a paternity test which confirmed he IS the father, and he does financially support her. Unfortunately, he has NEVER met his 3 year old daughter and sadly, has no interest in doing so, according to Varunie. Suddenly Owen Wilson doesn’t seem like such a nice guy, after all…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA – Varunie and Lyla at Disneyland for her 3rd birthday\n\nJennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson are filming a romantic comedy, Marry Me, in New York, and of course there’s a bulldog in the cast. The plot deals with a pop star who finds out her fiancé is cheating, minutes before their huge wedding at Madison Square Garden. Furious, she instead marries a random guy from the crowd – most likely played by Owen. Colombian singer (and Madonna favorite) Maluma also has a role in the film – we’re guessing he’s the wayward, but gorgeous, fiance…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nOwen Wilson, 48, has more than earned the title of “eternal bachelor,” but he has managed to father a few kids. Wilson’s ex-girlfriend Jade Duell gave birth to Ford (above) six years ago, but they split shortly after. Owen’s personal trainer and longtime friend Caroline Lindquist gave birth to his other son three years ago while she was still married to someone else. She and Owen are “amicable friends.” Apparently the actor has a fear of commitment and prefers the company of his “frat pack” of actor buddies that he has fun making movies with.\n\nPhoto Credit: Pacific Coast News\n\n#owenwilson #janetcharlton\n\nThe mystery of Owen Wilson’s bumpy twisted nose may never be solved. He says he broke his nose several times while growing up. But WHY did he never get it straightened out? It’s an easy fix. Owen’s high school photo on the left indicates he already had issues with his nose in those days. Maybe he wouldn’t be as funny with a normal nose…\n\nOwen Wilson’s romance with Kate Hudson finally seems to be over for good, and no one is happier that Owen’s best friend Woody Harrelson! According to an acquaintance, Woody and Kate NEVER got along, but they put their differences aside for Owen’s sale. (Actually it often happens that best buddies don’t like their pal’s significant others.) Woody is relieved that Kate is out of the picture- he never thought she was the right girl for Owen.\n\nJessica Photo Credit: Buzz Foto\n\nJessica Simpson HAS been spending lot of time with Owen Wilson, but her dad Joe wants Owen out of the picture. Jessica has been insisting to Joe that she and Owen are just friends and he needs friends right now. But when they’re not together, Owen keeps in close touch by calling or messaging Jessica frequently. Joe is planning a big comeback for Jessica and he feels she wastes time getting too involved in her “relationships” and neglects her own career. Joe is very aware of the fact that Jessica falls for guys who are needy and Owen fits the description.\n\nOwen Wilson is probably thrilled that the press has decided that he attempted suicide because of his bustup with Kate Hudson. It’s a very logical explanation for his highly unexpected behavior. Looks good on paper. Plus it sounds touching and romantic – but it couldn’t be FARTHER from the truth. Owen is the one who broke off their relationship. Right now he’s in the psycho ward at Cedars and needs a plausible explanation for his actions because he doesn’t want the truth to come out. Hollywood insiders are buzzing that Owen’s problem is drugs, not women. They speculate that the drugs he’d been using made him depressed and drove him to attempt suicide. Why else would he have a high-powered lawyer at his bedside?\n\nWe hear that Owen Wilson is at St John’s hospital in Santa Monica in a terrible state. A nervous breakdown? We’re told he attempted suicide by slashing his wrists AND taking pills. His family found him clinging to life. Drugs have been rumored to be a problem for him but they didn’t seem to interfere with his work. This is a shock – nobody suspected he was in such bad shape. It’s difficult to imagine a guy so lucky in his career and lucky in love wanting to end his life."
