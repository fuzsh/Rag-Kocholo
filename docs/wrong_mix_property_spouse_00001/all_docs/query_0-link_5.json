        "text": "Owen Cunningham Wilson (born November 18, 1968)[2] is an Academy Award-nominated American actor, comedian, producer and screenwriter.\n\nWilson was born in Dallas, to photographer Laura (Cunningham) Wilson and Robert Andrew Wilson. He has an older brother, Andrew, and a younger brother, Luke. Both brothers are also involved in movie making.[3]\n\nWilson went to the University of Texas at Austin. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English.[4]\n\nThe Sheryl Crow album C'mon C'mon has the song \"Safe and Sound\". The liner notes say it is about Wilson and Crow's relationship.\n\nOn August 26, 2007, Wilson was taken to St. John's Health Center. It was reported as a suicide attempt. He was later moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.[5] His lawyer later said that Wilson had depression.[6] A few days later, Wilson withdrew from starring in Tropic Thunder.\n\nHe dated Kate Hudson in 2006. The pair broke up. It was widely reported that he tried to commit suicide in 2007 after the relationship with Hudson ended. In 2008, it was reported the pair were to marry.[7] However the two would again break up and make up a number of times over 2008 and 2009.[8]\n\nOn January 10, 2011, Wilson's representative said that Wilson and his girlfriend, Jade Duell, were expecting a baby.[9] Just four days later, on January 14, Duell gave birth in Hawaii to a baby boy, Robert Ford Wilson.[10][11]\n\nWilson is a fan of several Dallas-area professional sports teams. He has been spotted at Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks and Texas Rangers games.[12][13] He is also a supporter of the English football team Chelsea F.C..\n\nWilson's bumped nose is because he broke it twice. Once was during a high school fight, and once playing football with friends.[14]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1996 Bottle Rocket Dignan Also writer The Cable Guy Robin's Date 1997 Anaconda Gary Dixon As Good as It Gets N/A Associate producer 1998 Armageddon Oscar Choice Permanent Midnight Nicky Rushmore N/A Writer 1999 The Haunting Luke Sanderson Breakfast of Champions Monte Rapid She's All That Brock Hudson The Minus Man Vann Siegert Toy Story 2 Additional voices 2000 Shanghai Noon Roy O'Bannon Nominated – Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Action Team\n\nNominated – Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor: Musical or Comedy Scream 3 Nigel Green Meet the Parents Kevin Rawley Nominated – Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Supporting Actor – Comedy 2001 Zoolander Hansel McDonald Nominated – MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo The Royal Tenenbaums Eli Cash Also writer\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay\n\nNominated – BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay\n\nNominated – Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated – New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated – Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Screenplay\n\nNominated – Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Cast\n\nNominated – Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Screenplay\n\nNominated – Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor: Musical or Comedy\n\nNominated – Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated – Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay Behind Enemy Lines Lt.
