        "text": "The actor and his sons Ford, 13, and Finn, 10, were spotted watching LAFC take on the New York Red Bulls at BMO Stadium on April 20\n\nOwen Wilson hit the town this weekend to spend some quality time with his kids.\n\nOn Saturday, April 20, the actor, 55, was photographed attending the Los Angeles Football Club's game against the New York Red Bulls at BMO Stadium in L.A. with his sons Robert \"Ford,\" 13, and Finn, 10.\n\nSitting right next to the field in one of the stadium's 1800 Tequila suites, Wilson and his boys could be seen yelling and holding up a jersey featuring forward Denis Bouanga's name and number, 99, as they cheered on the LAFC.\n\nAlthough Wilson has remained mostly private about his relationship with his kids over the years, he's occasionally spoken about how he manages his blended family. He shares Ford with his ex-girlfriend Jade Duell and Finn with his once-trainer Caroline Lindqvist, and is also parent to 5-year-old Lyla with Varunie Vongsvirates.\n\nThough Wilson is not in a relationship with any of his children's mothers, the actor revealed to Esquire in 2021 that he lives near his two sons and everyone \"gets along.\"\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm already seeing how they're gonna be as teenagers,\" Wilson told Ellen DeGeneres about life with his sons. \"Where they're gonna be ganging up on me.\"\n\nRelated: Owen Wilson's 3 Kids: All About Ford, Finn and Lyla\n\nBack in 2014, after Finn was born, Wilson made an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to discuss just how quickly Ford took to being a big brother.\n\n\"Ford is very, kind of protective of his, he always calls him — he doesn't even call him by his name, he always calls him his baby brother,\" Wilson told DeGeneres. \"I think he likes the fact that he's just about 30 pounds, but that Finn is smaller.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe feeling turned out to be mutual, he said. Wilson added that Finn idolized his older brother as he got older, joking with DeGeneres that Finn's nickname was \"Me Too,\" because of how much he wanted to be like his big brother.\n\nRelated: Owen Wilson Reveals His Dream Costar Is Nicolas Cage: 'I've Loved Him in So Many Movies' (Exclusive)\n\nThe LAFC has been drawing large, star-studded crowds over its past few seasons. Last year, the team's games featured appearances from celebs including Prince Harry, Will Ferrell, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jason Sudeikis, rapper Tyga and Selena Gomez, who went viral after a 2023 match for her shocked reaction to an LAFC goalkeeper denying soccer star Lionel Messi a goal.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
