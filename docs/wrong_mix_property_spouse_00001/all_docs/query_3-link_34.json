        "text": "Owen Wilson shocked the world with the unexpected news that he was to become a dad for the first time earlier this month, and now the actor has shocked us all again – by giving his newborn son a normal name!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShunning the weird and wonderful monikers that celebrities usually go for, the 42-year-old choose to name his week- old son, Robert Ford.\n\nDespite rumours claiming that Owen had chosen the name Ford Linton, the actor and his partner Jade Duell actually decided on a more traditional and, dare we say ordinary, name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you’re looking for baby name inspiration, whether it be a quirky name or one with a particular meaning, take a look at our Baby Names Finder."
