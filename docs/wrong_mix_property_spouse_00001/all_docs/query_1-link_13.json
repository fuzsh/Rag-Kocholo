        "text": "Mary-Louise Parker\n\nOne single celebrity who just can’t seem to find the guy of her dreams is Mary Louise Parker, the popular star of the drama show, 'Weeds'. The actress had a lot of success and fame through the show, but unfortunately, she has not seen that sort of success in her love life.\n\nSo far, two men have penetrated the shell of Mary Louise Parker’s armor, with one being Billy Crudup, the American actor and four-time Tony Award nominee, and the other being the charismatic and endearing Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who played a recurring role as Denny Duquette in 'Grey's Anatomy'. Crudup and Parker had a child together but were eventually separated, probably because they were never even engaged in the first place. Morgan and Parker were actually engaged at one point in their relationship, but the marriage was called off for personal reasons and the couple went their separate ways.\n\nMarisa Tomei\n\nMarisa Tomei is an Italian-American actress, last known for her appearances in the Spider-Man films as Spidey's gorgeous aunt May. Over the years she has had many public relationships as she has dated many public men including Lenny Kravitz, Robert Downey Jr., and Christian Slater. However, none of these hotties has managed to pin down this cross-cultured cutie as she is currently still single and living in the US.\n\nMarisa is not recently single either, in fact, the actress has been single for quite a while now, and apparently enjoys living her solitaire life just fine!\n\nKylie Minogue\n\nDon’t let her beautiful looks, incredible talent and amazing personality fool you, this amazing woman is not one for a relationship. After going through some very challenging trials and tribulations, including a very tough bout with breast cancer, the famous singer-songwriter has resolved that she's not the type of person who's built for marriage. Fortunately for her fans, just when they thought that everything was lost, a new hope was found.\n\nA few years ago, Kylie chose to go with her heart instead of her words, as she almost got married to British actor, Joshua Sasse. The two were dating and things were looking up for them, but as is often the case in Hollywood, they ended up breaking up in 2017. In the past couple of years, she's dating Paul Solomons and seems happy enough!\n\nLucy Liu\n\nIt may be the case that Chinese-American actress, Lucy Liu, has managed to scare away some potential suitors by playing the role of an assassin so many times in her various TV shows and films. From the terrifying O-Ren Ishii in 'Kill Bill' to Master Viper from 'Kung Fu Panda'. If that’s not scary enough, we have some cool bits of trivia on the actress that might just shock you.\n\nIn a recent interview, Liu spoke out about how she is a student of different religions and a very spiritual person. Liu is also a mother to Rockwell. Sure seems that Liu just has many more pressing issues on her mind than the prospect of finding a life partner.\n\nCharlize Theron\n\nConsidered by many to be the most beautiful and unique actress in Hollywood, South African beauty Charlize Theron is a powerful media figure and one of the most recognized people in Hollywood. Despite all her success and fame, which include an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, an American Cinematheque Award, and the Silver Bear for Best Actress, Theron has yet to fall head over heels in love.\n\nThe South African actress has not always been single. She dated singer Stephan Jenkins for three years back in 1998 and later went with Irish actor Stuart Townsend from 2001 until 2010. She even had a brief romantic connection with Keanu Reeves. Eventually, the actress found herself in the arms of actor Sean Penn. The two were engaged in 2014 after just a few months together but broke up relatively soon after. Theron has two adopted kids, which she raises by herself.\n\nNaomi Watts\n\nBest known for her performance in 'Twin Peaks', 'The Loudest Voice', and Peter Jackson's 'King Kong', this beauty definitely has to be saved by no less than prince charming. Until then, we’re still waiting for just a committed relationship with her ideal man. Despite being listed by People and Maxim as one of the world's most beautiful women, the actress is still single and looking for love.\n\nThe actress is very private about her personal life, but we have heard that in 2017 she settled down with American actor Billy Crudup.\n\nJon Hamm\n\nJon Hamm, also known as the Mad-Men star, Don Draper, didn’t have much luck in finding his lifelong partner. The talented actor and producer never actually got married, but he did have a long list of lovers, none of whom was ultimately deemed worthy of him popping the big question.\n\nOur first bachelor's most prominent relationship was no fling. Jon dated Jennifer Westfeldt, a famous actress and writer between 1997 and 2015. Now, that’s longer than most marriages last these days! The couple did seem happy together for nearly two decades, but ultimately ended things when Westfield decided she didn’t want to play the role of a mother any longer. Sources say that Hamm’s party-boy lifestyle often left Jennifer in the role of the responsible adult having to take care of him and clean up the mess. Not good, Jon.\n\nEmilia Clarke\n\nFans lusted over Emilia Clarke after seeing her incredible performance in the world’s most popular TV show, Game of Thrones. While many fans wished to see her with Jason Momoa, (the actor who played Khal Drogo) in real life, those wishes unfortunately never materialized.\n\nHowever, she does seem to be enjoying her ever-growing career and free time. There were rumors that Clark was dating actor Seth MacFarlane, the creator of 'Family Guy', just a few years before 'Game of Thrones' debuted. Emilia eventually did admit that the rumors were true and that the two had dated but they had separated since. Clarke also dated James Franco, Cory Michael Smith, and even Jai Courtney in 2015, none of whom took the time out of their busy work schedules to head out to the nearest ring designer.\n\nSandra Bullock\n\nSandra Bullock is one of the highest-earning, most successful actresses in the world. And if that's not enough, she's also one of the best-looking ones. The actress saw her fame jump to celebrity levels after her role in the action thriller, 'Speed', alongside Keanu Reeves. Since then, Bullock went on to act in some of the most profitable films in the last century, and her films combined a worldwide gross that currently stands at over $5 billion.\n\nThe popular actress was once engaged to actor Tate Donovan, whom she met while filming 'Love Potion No. 9'. She also had a controversial relationship with the then-young hotshot, Ryan Gosling. Bullock was 37 years old, while Gosling was just 21! Bullock also dated Matthew McConaughey and NFL quarterback, Troy Aikman. She has two adopted children and is raising them by herself as a single mother. The actress is currently involved in a serious relationship with photographer Bryan Randall and we are hoping this one's a keeper. You go, girl!\n\nDana Delany\n\nLike many Hollywood celebrities and actresses, Dana Delany claims she's happily unmarried. And goes further on the point by saying, “I do like relationships, but I have to admit, the older I get, the more I love my solitude. I don’t want to give that up.” Apparently having the freedom to do whatever you want with your glamorous multi-million dollar life is a big perk of being a Hollywood celeb, and is currently in style.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, the actress, who was included in People magazine's annual list of the 100 most beautiful women, said in an interview that now that she’s in her 50s, she's ready to get married and that she's currently looking for a smart, funny and kind guy to tie the knot with.\n\nShonda Rhimes\n\nRemember the popular medical drama 'Grey's Anatomy'? Of course you do. The show was filled with drama and romance, with Meredith and the other characters being involved in epic relationships. And the brilliant woman that created, wrote, and produced it was Shonda Rhimes. The talented filmmaker is also the executive producer of many ABC shows, such as 'Off the Map', 'How to Get Away with Murder', and 'The Catch'.\n\nRhimes recently revealed that she lost over 100 pounds through exercise and dieting, but despite her success and healthy habits, she has never been married. Shonda Rhimes currently has three daughters, with the first being adopted in 2002, the second in 2012, and the third born via surrogacy in 2013.\n\nSusan Boyle\n\nMost people would agree that Susan Boyle is a true Cinderella story. The Scottish singer rose to fame after appearing on the third season of 'Britain's Got Talent', with her incredible rendition of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from Les Misérables. Her performance catapulted the singer to massive success, and her debut studio album \"I Dreamed a Dream\", which was released in 2009, became the best-selling debut album of all time in the UK.\n\nShe has never married and has been dedicating her life to caring for her aging mother until she died in 2007. When Boyle was asked in 2012 if she would be willing to try internet dating, she said she was too scared to try.\n\nSarah Silverman\n\nSarah Silverman is one of the most divisive figures in comedy. With her jokes revolving around notorious topics such as racism, sexism, politics, and religion, the Jewish comedian has managed to agitate people in both left and right political circles. Silverman has also acted in various films, such as 'School of Rock', 'Wreck-It Ralph', and 'A Million Ways to Die in the West'. The vegetarian comedian had to struggle her entire life with depression and decided she never wants to have kids, citing that ‘there are just too many kids with no parents’ as the reason why.\n\nSilverman has dated the famous comedian and SNL writer, Dave Attell, and even had a thing with Jimmy Kimmel in 2002. She also dated actor Michael Sheen in the past. Recently her name has been linked to American comedian Rory Albanese.\n\nRebel Wilson\n\nEveryone loves Rebel Wilson. The actress appeared in various beloved films, such as 'Bridesmaids', 'What to Expect When You're Expecting', 'Pitch Perfect', 'How to Be Single' and 'Isn't It Romantic?'. Most people don't know that Wilson actually started out in the field of Mathematics, and was very academic in high school.\n\nThe Australian actress has been a leading activist on body positivity and weight loss. She also dated the popular British actor and comedian Matt Lucas in 2012. The couple ended up living together in West Hollywood until the end of their relationship in 2015. In 2019 she met who would later become her husband, Jacob Busch. They ended up divorcing in 2021. She don't need no man though. Wilson recently had a daughter via surrogate.\n\nKristin Davis\n\nEveryone remembers Charlotte York Goldenblatt, the naive believer in love from HBO's romantic comedy show, 'Sex and the City'. She portrayed the role between 1998 and 2004 and received several Emmy nominations. Her character was married twice in 'Sex in the City'. She is also a philanthropist and a lifetime lover of elephants.\n\nIn her personal life, the actress has never been married and currently has two adopted children. The first was adopted in 2011 and is named Gemma Rose Davis, the second was adopted in 2018. This talented star is obviously very giving and generous, but she says she doesn't have time to date.\n\nJacqueline Bisset\n\nThe drop-dead-gorgeous actress, Jacqueline Bisset has been working since 1965 and is still active today. Needless to say, she has never been at a loss for suitors when it comes to the love department. The actress has even had the luck to carry out not 4, but 5 different long-term relationships. But for some reason, she never ended up finding the one that was worth sticking around for.\n\nJust like it is with many other high-profile celebrities, many of Jacqueline’s relationships were inevitably public, including her time spent with Emin Boztepe (1994-2005) - a martial arts instructor, and Vincent Perez (1988-1992), who is a Swiss actor. She even reunited with Boztepe for another short run at love in 2007, but that attempt lasted barely a year.\n\nJorja Fox\n\nAnother star on our list that has a recurring role in a crime drama show is Jorja Fox. Fox is famous for her regular role as Sara Sidle in the CBS police drama, 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'. After CSI, the actress faded relatively into obscurity and wasn't seen as much. She's an avid activist for the Human Rights Campaign and is obsessed with vegetarianism and animal rights.\n\nIt's believed that the actress has dated CSI co-star Lelah Foster. However, rumor has it that she also went out with actor Gary Dourdan, who was another co-actor from the show, and later dated Suzanna Mara - a Hungarian who appeared in a few films from the '90s. So it’s pretty safe to say that Fox ultimately played for both teams. Still, she enjoys being single.\n\nLouisa May Alcott\n\nFamous novelist Louisa May Alcott was also born and raised in the conservative times of the early 19th century and the American civil war. Alcott decided to not get married altogether, opting instead to stay single for her entire life. May Alcott grew up among many of the world's most famous intellectuals of the time, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, so she definitely had her pick of big-brained men to choose from. But apparently, her single lifestyle was entirely by choice.\n\nWhen asked about choosing to stay unmarried (unlike her female written characters), she explained in an interview, \"I am more than half-persuaded that I am a man's soul put by some freak of nature into a woman's body … because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.” That would certainly have cleared things up.\n\nThe Feres Twins\n\nThese identical twins are absolutely gorgeous, and also happen to be accomplished synchronized swimmers, models, and actresses. The twins have been rumored to have competed at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, but it turned out to be false, although the twins still proclaim it on the Instagram account, which boasts almost one million followers.\n\nDespite their looks and popularity, the twins aren't very big in the whole dating scene, probably because of their very high standards and absolute lack of time for anything that isn’t career-related. We've recently learned that Branca has been enjoying a relationship with Brazilian actor Bruno Gagliasso. But Branca claimed that their relationship was strictly professional. We’re still waiting for any news to stir up on Bia, but if her sister is dating, it’s only a matter of time until we see some romantic pics of her as well!\n\nJane Austen\n\nProlific writer Jane Austen is known for writing some of the most important pieces of female literature in history, particularly 'Sense and Sensibility, 'Pride and Prejudice', 'Mansfield Park', and 'Emma', which have all been adapted into films. Although the novelist frequently wrote about romance in her books, she never actually got married herself and was mostly focused on her writing. Austin was just like her heroines: charismatic, beautiful, and flirtatious, but for her, marriage was an economic problem due to the ways that it affected a woman’s estate back in the 19th century.\n\nOne of the most common theories is that Austen didn't marry because she had a taste for women, but there's little evidence to support this claim. She was known to be involved with Tom Lefroy, who later became the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, but the novelist refused to marry. She passed away at age 40, which was not so uncommon just a few centuries ago. When Austen passed away she was still unmarried and had no children of her own, unless you count her novels, which remain a legacy to this day.\n\nLauryn Hill\n\nOur next single celebrity who really shouldn’t be single is Lauryn Hill, a popular rapper and former band member of the Fugees. Hill has won many awards, including a Grammy, with her neo-soul style and strong rap lyrics. Around 1994, Hill began a romantic relationship with Jean, a band member of The Fugees, which inevitably lead to problems inside the band and its eventual disbandment. She then went on to have a very successful solo career that's still going strong today. Hill currently has six children, five of them with entrepreneur and former football player, Rohan Marley, the son of Bob Marley.\n\nWe're not sure why Marley and Hill never closed the deal, but ultimately, they did end up breaking up, possibly due to infidelity on Hill’s part. We bet her children keep her busy enough.\n\nJoan Jett\n\nMany fans regard Joan Jett as the female Ozzy Osbourne, with her black hair, gothic look, and a taste for punk and black attire. The famous rock singer and occasional actress has had a lot of success when it comes to her career, but not as much in her relationship status. Her sexual preferences have been called into question many times, and it is rumored Jett is attracted to women or even bisexuals. When asked about it, the singer never denied nor confirmed it.\n\nIf there’s a Hollywood celebrity that truly likes to keep their private life private, it would definitely be Joan Jett. She has been extremely secretive about her romantic life and has never revealed or even insinuated anything about her likes and dislikes to anyone - as far as partners go. As it stands, we know that Joan isn’t seeing anyone at the moment, and she appears to be very happy about it.\n\nChelsea Handler\n\nOne of the most popular political comedians is the wonderful Chelsea Handler, who unfortunately just can't find her luck in the dating world. The comedian, actress, writer, host, producer, and activist has been the center of many popular shows, such as the late-night talk show 'Chelsea Lately, the documentary series 'Chelsea Does', and finally, the Netflix talk show 'Chelsea'. She also wrote six books that have all become New York Times Best Sellers and was named by Time magazine as one of the most influential people in the world.\n\nIn her romantic life, Chelsea dated Ted Harbert, the former CEO of Comcast, but eventually broke up with him four years later. Handler has also been dating the rich New York hotel owner, Andre Balazs, in the last few years. The couple had been dating off and on again for two years before officially breaking up in 2013. In 2021 she made her relationship with Comedian Jo Koy Instagram official.\n\nMonica Lewinsky\n\nYou can probably recall Monica Lewinsky as the U.S. White House intern that was romantically involved with then-President, Bill Clinton. The scandal made Lewinsky gain national attention and she became an international celebrity. The anti-bullying activist pursued a master's degree in psychology; she recently returned to the public view as a social activist against cyberbullying.\n\nUnfortunately for Lewinsky, due to her history and level of fame, she has dated but never managed to find a stable partner to marry and have children with. Monika currently has no children and also has trouble finding a stable profession outside of her activism and public appearances.\n\nDina Meyer\n\n50-year-old actress Dina Meyer is best known for her recurring role in the Fox teen drama show, 'Beverly Hills, 90210'. She also appeared in various other films, TV shows, and video games. Despite the talented and beautiful actress’s impressive resume, she's still single and currently has no children. The actress used to date actor and musician Shane West between 2001 and 2002, and also singer Billy Joel, later that same year.\n\nOther than that not much is known about Meyer's relationship status. Either she's just not dating anyone and isn't interested in getting married, or she's been hiding a really gorgeous husband somewhere in her closet. While we believe that it’s never too late to find love, it looks like the train is starting to leave the station for Meyer to raise her own children, unless she chooses to adopt, as many Hollywood mothers do.\n\nMiranda Richardson\n\nOut of all our actresses, Miranda Jane Richardson appears to be the most hopelessly single. The British actress is quite popular in the UK and has been nominated seven times for a BAFTA Award and a whopping seven Golden Globe Awards. But although the actress appears to be enjoying a highly successful career, she has never had any major relationship that is worthy of mention and is still unmarried with no children of her own.\n\nPerhaps her passion lies in other areas, as the actress is a keen falconer and has a beautiful bird called Cassiopeia. She claims the birds are very comforting and romantic. In an interview with the Daily Mail regarding her lack of romantic life, she said that you need luck to find Mr. Right, and she doesn't want to settle for less.\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nJennifer Aniston is one of the most beautiful, talented, and beloved actresses in Hollywood. The actress often practices Hatha yoga, Budokan karate, and transcendental meditation. With such a holistic lifestyle, an amazing personality, and a whopping net worth of over $200 million dollars, it's unbelievable that the actress who portrayed sexy fashionista, Rachel Green, in 'Friends' is somehow still single.\n\nAniston was married to hottie Brad Pitt between 2000 and 2005 before he left her for Angelina Jolie. She was also married to film actor and director Justin Theroux, from 2015, but their relationship soon fell apart and they were divorced in 2017. Since then, Aniston has been single, or at least she hasn’t spoken publicly about dating anyone.\n\nKimberly Stewart\n\nIt’s not easy to be the child of famous parents. Young adults and kids have a tough time adjusting to the life of fame as it is, so being born into it sounds like an even tougher ordeal - because you never actually know what normal is. This is the case with Kimberly Stewart, who was born to famous parents, Rod and Alana Stewart. The young celeb was followed by paparazzi from a young age but grew up to become a beautiful and kind person. Stewart was engaged when she was just 19 years old, after a short time of dating MTV’s Laguna Beach actor, Talan Torriero.\n\nAlthough the couple looked like a promising match, they eventually broke off the engagement just two weeks after it was publicized. Their lives eventually separated into very different lanes, and in 2011, Stewart found herself having a child with the famous Puerto Rican actor, Benicio del Toro. Today she's dating Jesse Shapira.\n\nParis Hilton\n\nParis Hilton is the daughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels, and one of the richest and most famous people in the world. She was the center of tabloid gossip for many years and used her fame to start a career that includes modeling, singing, acting, fashion designing, DJing, and writing. Her success is so massive that just her perfume brand alone has made over $3 billion in revenue. She also gets paid tens of thousands of dollars to appear regularly in various clubs and events.\n\nThe business magnate has been involved in a variety of high-profile relationships with some very powerful and demanding people. She used to date Leonardo DiCaprio in 2000. In 2019 she started dating Businessman Carter Reum and in 2021 the two got married.\n\nCondoleezza Rice\n\nAnyone who’s ever been even mildly interested in politics will immediately recognize the name and face of the 66th United States Secretary of State between 2005 and 2009, Condoleezza Rice. While most politicians often have very ordinary and conservative lives with a husband or wife and kids, in Rice’s case, she chose to avoid these things altogether. As of today, Rice is neither married nor has any children of her own.\n\nShe is an incredible inspiration for all women, especially women of color, for what a powerful and accomplished woman looks like. During the ‘70s, when Rice was just in her twenties, she used to date and was even briefly engaged to popular NFL player, Rick Upchurch, but alas, the politician ultimately decided to break it off because she \"knew the relationship wasn't going to work.\"\n\nSheryl Crow\n\nThe 57-year-old singer/songwriter Sheryl Suzanne Crow doesn’t look a day over 40, yet she sure has gone through some major love life drama over the years. She seems to have everything going for her, from looks to talent to the whole Hollywood musical career, but she can’t seem to get it right when it comes to romantic relationships.\n\nWe do know that once upon a time, in 2003, the talented Ms. Crow used to enjoy her relationship with famous cyclist Lance Armstrong. Eventually, the world learned about Armstrong’s illegal substance use during his cycling competitions, which he used to enhance his performance while on the bike. Since his secret was blown after the two had broken up, maybe Lance suspected Cheryl of blowing his cover, or maybe it was just creative differences, but either way, the two never got back together, leaving our Californian country-rock singer single ever since.\n\nKourtney Kardashian\n\nFans have been arguing for years on end on the subject of which Kardashian is the best-looking one, and which one is the best to marry. In our opinion, we think that Kourtney Kardashian is the best answer to both of these questions. She is one of the world’s biggest reality stars and currently has three children from her prior relationship with Scott Disick. But the couple eventually broke up due to various issues and infidelity on Disick’s part.\n\nWith 83 million Instagram followers and her own spinoff show, called \"Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami\" and \"Kourtney and Kim Take New York\", it's a big mystery why nobody has been able to snatch this one up yet. Albeit, her high-profile status may seem intimidating to some. In 2022 Kourtney tied the knot with her new love Travis Barker in Portofino, Italy. Go Kourt!\n\nJanet Napolitano\n\nAmerican politician, lawyer, and university administrator, Janet Napolitano is one of those women that put work before everything else, with such focus that they completely give up on the romantic and familial aspects of their life. Her most prestigious political achievements so far were being elected as the 21st Governor of Arizona from 2003 to 2009, and as the United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013. In 2012, Napolitano was listed by Forbes as the ninth most powerful woman in the world in the world.\n\nNapolitano claims to love basketball, tennis, softball, rafting, and hiking. However, she never had children and has never married. As with such public figures, people tend to speculate. This caused many to speculate that Napolitano may just possibly be gay and in the closet about it. Napolitano responded to these speculations by saying that she is \"just a straight, single workaholic\".\n\nHarper Lee\n\nJust like the other female novelists on our list, Harper Lee, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the iconic 'To Kill a Mockingbird' did not have children and was not married during her lifetime of almost nine decades. She was born in Monroeville, Alabama in 1926, as the youngest of four children, and attended an all-female college in Montgomery. Most people don't know that Lee had only written one book between the mid-’50s and 2015, before writing \"Go Set a Watchman\" as a spiritual sequel to her popular \"To Kill a Mockingbird\".\n\nLee's friend and former neighbor, Marja Mills, wrote a biography of the author called \"The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee\". In her book, she explained that Lee had multiple successful relationships with men, but none of them had ever advanced to the level of marriage. Perhaps Harper, like many others, was just too ahead of her time in her thoughts and beliefs for any man to really handle.\n\nOwen Wilson\n\nIf there’s one actor in Hollywood that’s too sweet to be single, it would definitely be the comedy actor Owen Wilson. This pretty boy has the looks, personality, and sense of humor that most women claim to look for in a man, but despite dating various actresses (including Sheryl Crow, Gina Gershon, Kate Hudson, Jade Duell, Caroline Lindqvist, Scarlett Benchley, and even Varunie Vongsvirates), he has never gotten married — although he did get pretty close!\n\nWilson dated famous actress Kate Hudson when he was 50 and she was in her 40s after the two met on the set of the 2006 comedy \"You, Me and Dupree\". Despite not being married, Owen Wilson currently has two children from two different mothers.\n\nDiane Keaton\n\nDespite acting as the romantic love interest of several actors in various romance films during the ‘70s, Annie Hall has not been having the same experiences in her daily life. Keaton, best known for her role in the 1977 film, Annie Hall, is still single and having a bit of a problem finding a guy to settle with and close the deal.\n\nIn her youth, Diane dated some of the most famous and successful men you could find in Hollywood. Her ex-love interests include Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, and even the famous Keanu Reeves. You’d expect by now that the talented actress would have a ring on her finger, or at least be heading there in a serious relationship. However, it appears that this actress is still single and may just be in that “I don’t care about men anymore” point. Or maybe she has decided to focus on herself and her acting for the time being.\n\nCoco Chanel\n\nGabrielle Bonheur Chanel was a fashion designer who worked profusely between 1909 and 1971. But of course, you know this fashion icon by the name Coco Chanel. Known largely for her designer purses and expensive perfumes, Coco Chanel, despite owning her own multi-million dollar brand and company, lived most of her life without a man by her side.\n\nIn fact, if you take a closer look at the woman behind this ultra-successful company, you'd find that the dazzling glorified Coco may not have been as fulfilled as we may have thought. Considering that, after all, she was one of the world's most famous fashion gurus, this goddess did have her fair share of love interests, most of whom attempted to court the young lady, only to be shot down politely. When asked on several occasions about her love life missing in the public eye, Coco said: “In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.” Fortunately for her suitors, they cannot be replaced anymore.\n\nCote De Pablo\n\nEveryone remembers the Chilean-American actress and singer, Cote de Pablo, for her recurring role as Ziva David in the popular CBS crime show, 'NCIS'. In the show, Ziva is introduced as an Israeli citizen that appeared regularly throughout the series and was disciplined, self-reliant, good with guns, and skilled in hand-to-hand combat. The character had a relationship with various characters from the show, such as Anthony DiNozzo and Leroy Jethro Gibbs. Unfortunately, Pablo's real life is a little different.\n\nOutside of the show, the actress doesn’t run a very successful love life. She used to date an actor named Diego Serrano, between 2000 and 2015. You’d think that after a decade and a half, one would decide that it’s time to get married, but the couple ended up not only unmarried but actually breaking up after an unfortunate string of events. Outside of that relationship, there’s not much to know about her dating history.\n\nJohn Cusack\n\nJohn Cusack began his acting career in the mid-80s and has been consistently appearing in various films ever since. The now 53-year-old actor was often seen with beautiful and successful women, especially actresses. He has been spotted dating Neve Campbell, Minnie Driver, and his co-star Lili Taylor, from the film “Say Anything”. His last public relationship was with the American fashion model and game show host, Brooke Burns. Since then, Cusack has made sure to keep his love life as private as possible.\n\nWomen have been fawning over the acclaimed actor from the day he stepped into the spotlight, and they have never really stopped since. When he was asked in 2009 why he has never been married, Cusack simply said, \"society doesn't tell me what to do.\" We hope a strong-spirited woman might though; we can’t wait to see this handsome devil finally get hitched!\n\nGreta Garbo\n\nBorn in a time when being married was considered a must for women, Greta Garbo was one of the pioneers in her decision to defy society and not get married during the '20s and '30s when her acting career had just begun. The actress actually ended up never getting married and decided to live alone. Her most famous romantic relationship was with frequent co-star, John Gilbert. They did have a good thing going while it lasted and helped each other out with their acting careers.\n\nGilbert was deeply in love with Garbo and repeatedly proposed to the actress, but she would always deny him or back out at the last minute. \"I was in love with him,'' she said. \"But I froze. I was afraid he would tell me what to do and boss me around. I always wanted to be the boss.\" Despite building herself an impressive estate worth around $30 million, the actress died without a partner or children and left all of her belongings to her niece, Gray Reisfield. Recent biographers believe that Garbo was either bisexual or lesbian and had intimate relationships with women as well.\n\nMae West\n\nThe actress, singer, playwright, screenwriter, comedian, and sex symbol was one of the most active people in Hollywood at a time when the entertainment industry was just in its infancy. The actress was secretly married to Frank Wallace in her early years, until the two got divorced in 1942, after 30 years of marriage. Since then (and reportedly even through her marriage), the actress was involved with many men and even dated a man 30 years younger than her when she was 61.\n\nThe vixen’s romantic life is a huge chaotic mess that more closely resembles what you might see on a soap opera than anything else. She was once interviewed regarding her romantic relationships and said: “Men are my hobby – If I ever got married I’d have to give it up.” Despite her opinions and choices, which were quite ahead of her time, May managed to find a partner in Chester Rybinski, the muscle man from her show (who was 30 years her junior). Rybinski ended up taking care of Mae until she passed away in 1980, at the age of 87, but there was no ring on her finger at the time.\n\nMatthew Perry\n\nWhile most women were likely attracted to the sexy “bad boy” Joey from the hit sitcom 'Friends', there were those who would swear by the hilarious and beautiful soul of Chandler Bing. Bing was portrayed by actor Matthew Perry, who became famous through the show and was recognized for his role until his last days.\n\nHe was in a relationship with many actresses over the years, including Lauren Graham, Julia Roberts, and Yasmine Bleeth. He also dated actress and model Lizzy Caplan, from 2006 to 2012. In 2020 he got engaged to Molly Hurwitz. Sadly, however, none of them were able to make things last in the long run and Perry never married.\n\nEdie Falco\n\nEdie Falco has been through some tough things in her life. In 2003 the award-winning actress was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to deal with alcoholism. She has since begun practicing Buddhism, and in 2005 and 2008, she adopted a son and a daughter. It's been alleged that Falco was involved with actor Stanley Tucci. In an interview, the actress did confirm that the couple was once together but has since separated. According to The New York Times, it turned out that their relationship was actually an affair.\n\nOutside of her past relationship with Tucci, the actress is dead silent on anything related to her love life. It’s assumed that she’s a very private person and is not looking for a relationship, which means that we’re probably not going to see a Falco marriage anytime in the future, although you never know how these things turn out. She has been dating Bill Sage since 2009.\n\nEmma Watson\n\nThe world was first introduced to the incredible Emma Watson after her portrayal of Hermione Granger, in the highly successful 'Harry Potter' film series. She has since appeared in various popular films, such as 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' and 2017's live-action remake of 'Beauty and the Beast'. The actress is an avid women's rights advocate and travels the world to speak on the topic.\n\nWatson has been single for a long time, and has insinuated that she has given up men completely when describing herself recently as being \"self-partnered\". She claims to be happy on her own and is not looking for a relationship that will limit her creativity. We get it, girl.\n\nAllison Janney\n\nAllison Janney is the beautiful and talented actress that we've all seen in popular films and TV shows such as 'Juno', 'The West Wing', 'I, Tonya', and 'Mom'. It's been rumored that Janney is currently in a relationship with Philip Joncas, but the actress refuses to confirm or deny the speculation. The alleged couple met somewhere in 2012 and has been seen displaying a lot of affection during film premieres lately.\n\nJanney told Women’s Health that her greatest fear when thinking about marrying someone is that her husband just might turn out to be a very different person. She compared her fear to marrying Arnold Schwarzenegger and finding out that you just married Danny DeVito, but that nobody else can see the difference.\n\nLionel Richie\n\nKnown for being a versatile musician, Lionel Richie also has a degree in economics, with a minor in accounting, gained at the Tuskegee Institute. But it was also during this time that he took a major interest in music and eventually formed the band, The Commodores. The famous American singer, songwriter, and producer placed his studies on hold after being picked up by an agent and going on tour with his band. But he went back to school and earned his diploma in 1974.\n\nIt was also in 1974 when The Commodores got signed with the prestigious Motown label. It was quite a wonderful year for the young lad and his band. Richie has been married twice. His most recent marriage broke off in 2004 and he hasn't been married since, but he has been dating Lisa Parigi since 2014.\n\nSharon Stone\n\nAmerican actress Sharon Vonne Stone is also a producer and a former fashion model for commercials and print advertisements. Her first role was as an extra in Woody Allen's comedy-drama, entitled \"Stardust Memories.\" She later had the pleasure of acting in several films, playing minor characters, until she rose to international fame as a sex symbol, when she starred as Catherine Tramell, in \"Basic Instinct (1992).\"\n\nIt appears that Stone is being proposed to on a regular basis. She has been engaged several times but has only been married twice. Her latest marriage, however, officially broke off in 2004 and she hasn't been married since. She has three sons, all of whom are adopted.\n\nKe$ha\n\nKesha Rose Sebert, formerly known as Ke$ha, is an actress, rapper, songwriter, and singer. A label signed her at age 18, and her first significant success came 4 years after the number-one single \"Right Round\" was released by Flo Rida, featuring her. Her music and image skyrocketed her to fame, but this was unfortunately put to a halt when disputes between her and her producer Dr. Luke started to spread out. She has sold over 59 million records in the US and 76 million records worldwide.\n\nKesha says that gender is not a factor for her when it comes to romantic attraction. The world is basically her oyster. Since 2014 she has been linked to Brad Ashenfelter and it seems like they are still going strong.\n\nJames Franco\n\nEveryone knows James Franco as a famous actor, but he's also a great filmmaker and instructor at NYU, USC, UCLA, Studio 4, Palo Alto High School, and Playhouse West. He has already received a couple of Golden Globes, proving to the world that he's a great actor. Plus, he volunteers for the Art of Elysium charity.\n\nAll that success, charitable work, those magnificent cheekbones, and an IQ of 130, make us wonder how is it that he has never been married. In 2017, he started dating Isabel Pakzad.\n\nAisha Tyler\n\nAisha N. Tyler, famously known as Andrea Marino from the first season of Ghost Whisperer, is an American Actress, director, comedian, and talk show host. Her roles in films and television shows like Criminal Minds, Lana Kane, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation were all independent women using their voices; making her a beacon of inspiration amongst female fans.\n\nRight now, she holds a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host. Tyler has had a 25-year-long marriage to attorney Jeff Tietjens which ended in 2017. In 2020 it was rumored she was dating a woman, but she has never confirmed it.\n\nKate Beckinsale\n\nKathrin Romary Beckinsale is a British actress who made waves after starring in the fantastic movie \"Underworld\". When asked about her past, she told everyone that it was always her dream to be an actress. She was immersed in film ever since she was young and has worked her way up to the top.\n\nHer acting skills and great looks have made many heads spin. She has had an eight-year-long relationship with actor Michael Sheen, a 15-year-long relationship with director Len Wiseman, and another short fling with comedian Pete Davidson. None of them, however, has ever popped the question, which makes you rethink men as a species altogether.\n\nGeena Davis\n\nVirginia Elizabeth \"Geena\" Davis is an American actress who's also an activist, a producer, and a former archer and model. She was one of the brightest celebrities of her time and has received multiple accolades for her work, both in film and television. Her portrayals of authentic and strong female characters have made her such an icon.\n\nShe has an impressive academic background under her belt, as well as a successful acting career. She can thank her incredible IQ of 140 for her excellent portrayals and A+ grades! Apparently, that brain appeals to many, as Davis has been married three times. Actually, four times if you count the 17-year-long relationship with Reza Jarrahy, which ended in 2018. Could husband number 5 be right around the corner?\n\nDavid Duchovny\n\nDavid William Duchovny is an American actor, producer, writer, novelist, director, composer, and singer. He's famous for his role as FBI agent Fox Mulder, on the hit television series \"The X-Files\", and as a writer named Hank Moody, on \"Californication.\" The two roles have earned him Golden Globe Awards.\n\nHe is also the proud owner of a few tattoos. The most visible of them is the AYSF anagram one on his ring finger. He got it instead of a wedding ring when he was married to Tea Leoni. The two got divorced in 2014 and he hasn't been married since. For now, we don't know of any plans he might have to remove the tattoo. Perhaps he's still hoping for a comeback?\n\nLupita Nyong'o\n\nBorn in Mexico, Lupita started her career in the early 2000s, as part of the production crew for many major films. She went on to make her debut as an actress in the short film, East River. In 2009, she wrote, directed, and produced her own documentary about the albino population in Kenya. Shortly after she enrolled in the Yale School of Drama and graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts.\n\nLupita got her big-screen breakthrough shortly after graduating when she was cast in Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave. She went on to star in award-winning films after that, including two Star Wars movies, The Jungle Book, Black Panther, Us, and more. She’s beautiful, talented, AND a genius! There isn't a lot of information on Lupita's personal life, let alone her romantic relationships. We do know, however, that she is not and has never been married. How? Now THAT is the real mystery.\n\nAshley Judd\n\nAshley Judd has been a Hollywood sweetheart since her role in 1990's Ruby in Paradise. She continued to earn recognition as a high-profile actress with her performances in Heat, Someone Like You, Frida, A Time to Kill, Kiss the Girls, Double Jeopardy, and more. Most recently, she landed a part in the Tv show Berlin Station. But there's much more to this actress than artistic talent.\n\nJudd has a Bachelor's degree in French from the University of Kentucky, a Mid-Career Master of Public Administration degree from Harvard University, and a Ph.D. in Public Policy from UC Berkeley. And as if managing three majors wasn't enough, Judd has been doing humanitarian work for more than a decade, plus she is an avid practitioner of various martial arts. She was married to race car driver Dario Franchitti for 12 years. The two split in 2013 and Judd hasn't found a man to be able to handle her skills and brain since.\n\nRihanna\n\nThe super-successful musician and entrepreneur is one of the world’s most popular and richest celebrities, with a net worth of $600 million. Despite Rihanna’s wealth and excessive spending on beauty, fashion, and accessories, she claims that her favorite way to spend her fortune is on others. Riri is also known for her involvement in many humanitarian causes.\n\nHer successful music career led her to win several awards, including Grammys, and she currently ranks as the second best-selling music artist in the world. With the beauty, dance moves, and voice. In 2020 she started dating ASAP Rocky, who is a rapper and record producer. The couple now has a beautiful baby boy, but they won't reveal his name or a photo. Good move if you ask us!\n\nKat Dennings\n\nKatherine Victoria Litwack's beauty makes our jaws drop every time she appears in film screenings. The actress, known professionally as Kat Dennings, made her acting debut in HBO's 'Sex and the City', by playing an obnoxious 13-year-old who hires Samantha to handle PR for her Bat Mitzvah. She is actually Jewish in real life and claims that Judaism \"is an important part of my history\", even though as a whole, religion is not the main part of her life.\n\nToday, we know her better for her performance as Max Black, the busty waitress from '2 Broke Girls' (2011). The talented actress was nominated for 4 acting awards between 2008 and 2014. As of May 2021 is engaged to rock star Andrew W.K.\n\nHalle Berry\n\nHalle Berry began her career as a model and almost won Miss USA in 1986. The actress went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first woman of African American descent to have won the award. During the 2000s, Berry became one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood.\n\nBerry is somewhat of a serial monogamist — she was married three times and got divorced from her most recent husband, Olivier Martinez in 2016. After a period of being happily single, she is now happily involved with musician Van Hunt,\n\nPia Wurtzbach\n\nThis Filipina-German beauty is the winner of 2015’s Miss Universe, and our list would not be complete without her. Pia Wurtzbach is a 30-year-old model, actress, beauty queen, and social media influencer with over 9 million Instagram followers.\n\nWurtzbach is an avid supporter of reproductive and LGBT+ rights in the Philippines. The 2015 Miss Universe winner also advocates for gender equality and claims that she intends to remain unmarried and child-free. But, she doesn't oppose having a boyfriend, at least not when it's Jeremy Jauncey, who is a Scottish entrepreneur.\n\nAdriana Lima\n\nThis Afro-Brazilian beauty is best known for her amazing modeling career as a Victoria's Secret Angel, from 1999 all the way up to 2018. This makes Adriana Lima the world's longest-running model, thanks to the 38-year-old model's ageless look and sharp business acumen. Lima was named \"the most valuable Victoria's Secret Angel\" in 2017.\n\nLima was born in Salvador, Brazil, and speaks four languages: Portuguese, English, Italian, and Spanish. Rumor has it that she is now dating movie producer Andre Lemmers\n\nDrake\n\nMostly known for his career in music, Drake actually made his spotlight debut on TV. He started in the teen drama Degrassi, where he played the role of Jimmy Brooks. His prolific music career includes five albums, many collaborations, and of course, numerous fans that would love to be held in his tattooed arms.\n\nDespite having a few meaningful relationships (one with Rihanna and one with his baby mama, artist Sophie Brussaux), he has never been married. As far as the press is concerned, he isn't seeing anyone right now.\n\nMichael B. Jordan\n\nNot to be confused with basketball player Michael (no B.) Jordan, this handsome fella must have gotten used to making some heads spin. While he is definitely one of the popular kids on the block, Jordan has a geeky side too and he is a fan of superheroes as well as anime. Every woman's dream.\n\nJordan has been rumored to have dated Swedish musician Snoh Aalegra after starring in her music video, but that was way back in 2018 and neither of them commented on those rumors. In 2021 an Instagram post confirmed that he was dating Lori Harvey.\n\nTom Hiddleston\n\nMany would know Tom Hiddleston from the Thor franchise and other Marvel films, where he plays Loki, the trickster god from Norse mythology. But Hiddleston's true character is nothing like the villain he plays in those films. This fine English scone of a man is the perfect gentleman, as any of his co-stars will tell you.\n\nHiddleston has a couple of high-profile relationships under his belt, like a three-year period with actress Susannah Fielding and a few months of dating Taylor Swift. Since 2019 however, he's been dating Zawe Ashton, who he met on a movie set.\n\nHenry Cavill\n\n'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn Of Justice' wasn’t a great movie but it did have some highlights. There was Wonder Woman’s first appearance and there was Henry Cavill playing Superman. Ah, Henry Cavill, there isn’t enough screen time in the world to do justice to all those muscles and perfect bone structure and smoldering gaze and… what were we talking about?\n\nThose interested in turning him into a husband should be prepared to move to London and get along with his dog. Nowadays he has a girl by his side, and while she's part of the entertainment industry, she isn't an actress! Her name is Natalie Viscuso.\n\nRobert Pattinson\n\nThe beautiful face on this lovely English gentleman became famous thanks to his role as Oliver Wood in the Harry Potter franchise. He went on to become even more magical when he played Edward Cullen in the Twilight films. It's almost as if magic follows him around.\n\nThat being said, it appears that magic hasn't been following him as far as romance is concerned. He has had romantic ties to his former co-star Kristen Stewart. Since 2018, he has been dating Suki Waterhouse.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio got an early start in his career, but it reached international heights after his role in 'Titanic'. After finally winning an Academy Award, now he is the proud owner of the full pack: an Oscar, a successful career, and a gorgeous face.\n\nLeo has been known to date supermodels much younger than him. Somehow, however, he's never been married or had children with any of them. In recent years he has been dating Camila Morrone and their relationship seems pretty stable.\n\nMary-Kate Olsen\n\nMary-Kate married French financier Olivier Sarkozy who is the brother of the former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. They made their union official in 2015 at a quiet wedding in New York City with about 50 guests. After five years, the relationship flared up and their divorce went through in May of 2020. An age difference of 17 years between them, he was 50 and she was 33 at the time of the divorce.\n\nMary-Kate hasn't spoken publically about the divorce, but she has been seen in the company of a new man. Still, despite the rumors, her close circle said she is just having fun being single and is not looking for anything serious in the near future.\n\nFran Drescher\n\nYou probably know her as the titular catcher in the show \"The Nanny.\" She went through a terrible public divorce in 1999, after being married for over two decades. Her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, came out as gay.\n\nFran claims she is now all about loving herself before she gets to loving anybody else. She finds it important to not be afraid to do things by herself. The actress said she doesn't feel like she needs to be in a relationship, as she is in a happy one with herself.\n\nKamaro Brown\n\nWe all know and love Kamaro Brown for his role in Netflix's Queer Eye. When he first rose to fame, he was dating Ian Jordan. The two were together for a long time, but in 2020 they decide to part ways and are no longer talking to each other.\n\nThe actor said these are confusing times to date in, so he is fully committed to being single for a while. But, he has admitted to being a hopeless romantic, so maybe there will be a new man in his future.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nBeing so famous has its trade-offs! The singer and actress struggled when it comes to dating, and she got real with the media one time, going as far as to say she “hates” dating.\n\nShe famously dated Justin Biber, who, it seems, broke her heart pretty badly. Dating is difficult for her, and she says she gets “weirded out” by the idea that anyone can Google her to find out everything about her before they met. Yikes.\n\nLil Nas X\n\nMontero Lamar Hill, who is mostly known as Lil Nas X, rose to popularity with the music video for Old Town Road. He prefers to date men, and while he was in a serious relationship with dancer Yai Ariza in the past, the two broke up in 2021. Later that year, the singer admitted that he thinks relationships are a lot of responsibility.\n\nHe added that he feels like he is more committed to his music at the moment. With how successful he's been, maybe committing to his music is a safer bet than committing to a guy right now.\n\nMindy Kaling\n\nMindy Kaily is most known for her role in the office and then for starring in her own show, titled \"The Mindy Project.\" She has been vocal about not feeling like she needs to date someone in order to achieve her dream of starting a family. She decide to become a single mom in 2017.\n\nIn 2020, she gave birth to her second child. She had not revealed the identity of the father, but we guess he wasn't marriage material. Either way, she said she is proud of her choices and doesn't care what others say or think.\n\nTerri Hatcher\n\nTerri Hatcher competed with many other actresses in order to score the lead role in 2004's Desperate Housewives. It ended up becoming her most iconic role. While her character enjoyed the company of men, Hatcher thinks women don't necessarily need to be married in order to be fulfilled.\n\nIn 2019, she told People Magazine that she thinks many women who never remarry after getting a divorce end up being happier. She added that everyone should be proud of their lives, even if they are single.\n\nHailee Steinfeld\n\nHailee Steinfeld has been acting since she was a young girl, but has gained the attention of mainstream audiences with her role in the movie \"The Edge Of Seventeen.\" She was later cast to play Emily Dickinson in the Apple TV series \"Dickinson.\"\n\nIn 2017, the actress opened up about being single, telling Harpers Bazaar that her highest priority right now is her career. She is happy with where she is in life, stating that she is feeling fulfilled with her work, family, and her time to herself. She's single, but she doesn't feel alone.\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nCyrus started her career at a young age. When she was 12, she was cast to play the titular character in the Disney show \"Hannah Montana.\" She has been in the public eye ever since, and after leaving the Disney chapter of her life behind, she was involved in more than one controversy.\n\nWhat wasn't controversial was how much she and Liam Hemsworth loved each other. The two have spent a decade together on and off, got married in 2018, and finally divorced in 2020. Miley still believes in love, but it seems she doesn't believe in \"The One,\" claiming she can love more than one person.\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nDemi Lovato started their career at just 8 years old, acting alongside the purple dinosaur, Barney. They later got their own show on the Disney channel named \"Sonny With a Chance.\" After the show ended they went on to have a successful music career. Demi dated \"That 70s Show\" actor Wilmer Valderrama for over six years, but the relationship ended after Lovato realized they don't know who they are without Valderrama.\n\nDemi was engaged to be married in 2021, to a man named Max Enrich. The relationship started fast and ended even faster. Today, Demi is just happy to be focusing on themselves, saying that love is the most important thing in the universe and that they'll continue waiting for it.\n\nEminem\n\nThe rapper famously wrote a lot of songs about both his ex-wife, Kim Scott, and their daughter, Hailie Jade. After having two more girls, he ended up divorcing Kim in 2006. Now, Eminem finds dating hard.\n\nHe has stated that he would like to be in a relationship again, but he finds it very hard to meet and connect with new people at his level of fame. He also mentioned that he has trust issues and that it's hard to know if people want to be around him because of his fame or because of who he is.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood\n\nThe actress could find her perfect match with either a man or a woman as she is attracted to both sexes. Evan Rachel Wood has had a few high-profile relationships, including one with rock star Marilyn Manson. In retrospect, it seems the relationship wasn't a healthy one, and that's an understatement.\n\nIn 2012, she married Jamie Bell. The two actors had a son together but ended their marriage in 2014. Since then, Rachel has been single and putting her time into her nonprofit organization, The Phoenix Act.\n\nChristina Hendricks\n\nGetting her big break as Joan in \"Mad Men\", Christina Hendricks is often cast for the front-and-center type of roles. Hey, it's hard to imagine that fiery red hair blending into any kind of background. We are sure that the fabulous and talented actress made one hell of a bride in 2009 when she married fellow actor Geoffrey Arend, but sadly, their marriage didn't last.\n\nThe two broke things off in 2019 and Hendricks hasn't expressed any interest in getting into a similar relationship since. (Well, not that she told us, anyway.)\n\nTracee Ellis Ross\n\nTracee is no stranger to the limelight but a stranger to a love life. Yes, the daughter of Motown legend Diana Ross and producer Robert Ellis Silberstein has skimped when it comes to finding a partner. She claims this isn't a problem and sees loneliness as an old friend.\n\nWe see nothing wrong with her choice, and if she is happy with her own company, more power to her. She now channels that energy towards writing and acting, and with an Emmy to her name, it seems to be working. You do you, Tracee. You don't need no man!\n\nLizzo\n\nLizzo, the woman with an anthem dedicated to being single, has no plans to find a partner soon. She is fiercely independent and loves her freedom. However, in a recent interview, she said she sometimes wants one but doesn't think she needs one.\n\nEvidently, the solitude didn't last very long as she is now seeing comedian Myke Write. Let's hope this one sticks! Finding love always happens when you least expect it. That's what happened to our parents, and they are now celebrating their 35th anniversary.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nStevie Nicks, lead singer of Fleetwood Mac, does not see a relationship on her horizon. After having many excellent relationships and boyfriends earlier in life, she may have had enough to last her a lifetime. But, who knows, the man of her \"Dreams\" may come to her in a \"Landslide.\"\n\nShe does say she feels sparkly and excited about everything, so if Mr. Right was around the corner, she could pack her bags and go.\n\nJanuary Jones\n\n\"Mad Men\" alum January Jones has embraced single life and single motherhood. She seems happy raising her son Xander and has a great support system to help her when needed.\n\nThe actress also notes that he doesn't fall into the stereotypical classifications of male/female and chooses what he likes regardless of gender. January has no plans of finding a partner soon. She is content with her life right now and doesn't feel lonely or unhappy with the choices she has made.\n\nLucy Hale\n\nLucy Hale is not a \"Pretty Little Liar\" when she says she loves being single. She treasures the time she gets to be on her own and enjoys the freedom that comes with it. Growing up, she wanted to date someone to complete a missing part of her.\n\nShe was also afraid of being single or being herself. While those sentiments have subsided, it would take someone that elevates her life even further to settle down with a partner.\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nKim Kardashian is not one to be single; it only took her a few days to begin dating Pete Davidson after she and Kanye called off their marriage. So, it's surprising she is still single after breaking it off with Pete.\n\nWe are sure there are not a limited number of suitors that Kim could have, but we are not sure how many want the limelight that goes along with dating a Kardashian. Best of luck to her next partner because you're in for a roller coaster ride.\n\nKhloe Kardashian\n\nKhloe Kardashian is available to date if you're interested. Granted, you will have to be a basketball player (she tends to marry/date many of them) or be rich. That is not us, but you go for it if you match the description.\n\nKhloe says she is happy being single and enjoys the time she gets to spend with her family. It's always healthy to be comfortable spending alone time with yourself; if Khloe is happy, good for her. We hope that next time, she finds a good partner that can support her and her family.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion\n\nMegan Thee Stallion is on her way out of the market, so it seems. Originally from Texas, Megan burst onto the music scene with her single \"WAP\" featuring Cardi B.\n\nShe has had several dating relationships, but none said: \"I do.\" However, that may change as her Instagram followers were happy to hear that she and her bae, rapper Pardison Fontaine are officially dating.\n\nBella Hadid\n\nBella Hadid, a woman known for her beauty and modeling career, is reportedly still single. She has killed it on the runway since her modeling career began at 16, but that has not led to any stable relationship for her.\n\nInstead, she is swamped, and we can't believe all of her international travel would help start a serious relationship. She has had an on-and-off relationship with The Weekend, but that never grew roots.\n\nTimothee Chalamet\n\nTimothee Chalamet has blown up over the last couple of years. His career first started in his role in \"Call Me by Your Name,\" and he has since starred in \"Don't Look Up\" and \"Dune.\"\n\nHowever, Timothee's relationship side has been kept quiet. We don't know if that is because he likes his privacy or has not dated anyone. Regardless of his motives, we are sure he could find a friendly partner if he wanted and if he is happy being single, keep doing that.\n\nMaria Sharapova\n\nOne of the women's tennis greats, Maria Sharapova, seems to focus more on her career than finding a partner. Maria immigrated from Russia to the US in 1994 and was a force on the tennis court until her retirement in 2020.\n\nMost of her relationships have been with athletes, although none of them led to the altar. She seems happy with her life and has her businesses to keep her busy. We hope that is true, but if she changes her mind, there will be a bunch of suitors at her doorstep.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nAngelina Jolie has not dated anyone after her third marriage to Brad Pitt fell apart. That last relationship lasted 12 years, including dating, which is a long time to be with anyone.\n\nTheir divorce in 2016 shocked the world, but what is more shocking is that she hasn't been with a partner since. We guess her six children and movie projects keep her busy, but we are still surprised she made this list.\n\nLindsey Vonn\n\nLindsay Vonn might go down as one of the best downhill skiers of her generation, but that has not helped her find a partner. She was in a relationship with Tiger Woods a few years ago, but that relationship ultimately went nowhere.\n\nMaybe it was because of their schedules or a personality difference. However, there might be some light if she did want to get a partner. She recently tweeted that she needed Valentine's Day Date; we would like to put our name into that hat.\n\nJimmy Garoppolo\n\nJimmy Garoppolo is known for his throws on the gridiron, but he remains single off of it. It's not due to his money or good looks (we know he has both of those in plenty), but maybe because of his time to commit to his job. The NFL is a nine-month job requiring a lot of travel during the year.\n\nThis doesn't add up to a stable relationship. But, if he ever does settle down, there will be plenty of suitors, and they know he is an old-fashioned man who shovels his mother's driveway each time it snows.\n\nLolo Jones\n\nLolo got so much coverage during the Olympics when it came out that she was saving herself for marriage. She believes in an old-fashioned relationship and wants to wait until she gets married.\n\nGood on you, Lolo, for sticking to your values. Now, you have more time to focus on running track and preparing for the bobsled events. The right partner will come along, and you will be all the better for it, Lolo.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr.\n\nBest known for his one-handed catches in the NFL, Odell Beckham Jr. is still incredibly single. He has yet to find the one, but he hopes to one day.\n\nHe has been injured most of his last couple of seasons, so maybe that will give him some more time to settle down and find his partner. He is handsome and rich, so there should be plenty of women who would want to be with him. The question now is if OBJ wants to be with them.\n\nVictoria Azarenka\n\nVictoria Azarenka may play singles on the court, but she is not ready to play doubles in her relationship. Her last one ended badly, and she is currently in the middle of an ugly custody battle for her child. If she wins, she plans to return to Belarus and enjoy a quieter life there.\n\nWe don't blame her, honestly, because we would do the same thing. Maybe after the storm quiets down, she will be ready to get back out there again.\n\nChris Evans\n\nAmerica's Butt still has no one to slap it when he rolls out of bed in the morning. If that were us, we would be cupping it whenever we could. Sadly, that is not the case, and he only has his dog to cuddle him.\n\nHe does keep busy with his movie roles and his non-profit charities, so maybe he doesn't have time for a relationship. On the other hand, George Clooney was 54 when he got married, so Chris does have time, but he had better hope he finds the one in the next couple of years.\n\nFlorence Pugh\n\nHollywood's new darling, Florence Pugh is known for not caring about what anybody says. She couldn't care less about people's comments when she was dating (the much older) Zach Braff, she kept quiet after the rumor mill wouldn't shut up about her beef with Olivia Wilde, and she boldly stands by her bold fashion choices.\n\nThis is also why she probably doesn't feel like she owes anyone any hot takes about being single. Power to you, Flo!"
