        "text": "When Owen Wilson was in Thailand shooting the new thriller “No Escape,” life imitated the script. In the film, out Wednesday, Wilson plays Jack Dwyer, an American businessman thrust into action-hero mode when a violent coup breaks out in an unidentified Asian country. While the movie was in production, Thailand was in the midst of unrest that would eventually lead to a coup d’état. Wilson got caught up in the middle of it.\n\nOn his last day there, he posed in a picture with fans who put a red, white and blue whistle around his neck for the photo. Unbeknownst to the actor, the whistle’s colors identified him as siding with anti-government protesters.\n\n“The production office got a call from the prime minister’s office . . . they were angry and were gonna detain me,” Wilson tells The Post. “Luckily, I had already left, [but] it would [have been] a good story for the talk shows — though there’s a fine line between being in a good story, and being in a Thai prison.”\n\nThe film — which finds Wilson’s character and his wife, played by Lake Bell, dodging bullets and engaging in hand-to-hand combat — might seem like an odd choice for the star of “Wedding Crashers” and various Wes Anderson flicks. But Wilson, who has two young children, empathized with the story of a man fighting to save his wife and kids.\n\n“I could relate to being a father trying to protect his family,” he says. “When I read the script, I thought it seemed like an exciting story, and I could imagine playing the character.”\n\nShooting the film, there was plenty of excitement both on and off set. For a riot scene where Wilson finds himself stuck between an advancing wall of protesters and a lineup of pro-government forces, the production had to be sensitive to a similar struggle happening nearby.\n\n“We had to be done filming by a certain time, because they didn’t want our movie riot to touch off a real one. It was intense,” says Wilson. “It helped to film this movie where we did. It’s easier to sell the idea that you’re confused and don’t know what’s going on, because that’s oftentimes how you feel when you’re traveling in strange places.”\n\nTo shoot a scene where Wilson’s character has to toss his two young daughters from one rooftop to another to escape protesters’ bullets, he had special assistance to get into the role.\n\nHis then-3-year-old son, Robert, was on set with his mother, Wilson’s ex-girlfriend Jade Duell. Having his toddler there helped him summon the right emotions for the moment.\n\n“There’s something hard-wired in us as human beings that, you want to protect a child, even if it’s not your own,” says Wilson, who also has a 1-year-old son named Finn with personal trainer Caroline Lindqvist. “We had these great actresses, Sterling and Claire, playing my daughters. You look at their faces in these scenes, and it’s pretty easy to get yourself worked up emotionally in an intense way.”\n\nBut, Wilson hasn’t totally abandoned comedy for a Liam Neeson career path. He just finished filming “Zoolander 2,” which will hit theaters in 2016. Slipping back into Hansel, the vapid model and foil-turned-ally to Ben Stiller’s Derek Zoolander, felt natural, despite the 14 years that have passed since the release of the original.\n\n“I’ve worked with Ben a million times, so we’re pretty comfortable together,” he says. “Even though it had been such a long time, it was more fun than the first one.”"
