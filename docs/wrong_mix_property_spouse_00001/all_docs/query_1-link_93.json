        "text": "In 2004 Meet the Fockers had us captivated as Jack Byrnes encountered the quirky characters of Rozalin and Bernie Focker.\n\nThe smash hit movie was the sequel to the 2000 film Meet the Parents and the premiere of the film brought together Hollywood icons like Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.\n\nThe film was a box office hit, grossing $522million (£410m) worldwide. It was followed by a sequel, Little Fockers, in 2010.\n\nAs we reminisce about this comedic gem, we’re all wondering where the cast members are now.\n\nREAD MORE: Elvis Presley’s grisly autopsy – constipated for months and covered in sores\n\nFrom serious health scares, a suicide attempt and Me Too allegations, these stars have been very busy since appearing in the cult comedy hit, and many are calling for a fourth instalment.\n\nBen Stiller\n\nIn a previous interview, Ben opened up about a scary health battle he dealt with years after the Meet the Fockers hit theatres.\n\nIn October 2016, the actor revealed he was previously diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\n“It came out of the blue for me.

I saw Robert had had it.
