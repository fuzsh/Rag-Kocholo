        "text": "Stiller And Wilson Enjoyed Finding The Old Groove In Zoolander 2\n\nBy Rich Cline in Movies / TV / Theatre on 12 February 2016\n\nSo why did it take so long for Ben Stiller to return to one of his most beloved, iconic characters? \"We probably would have made a sequel the year after the movie came out,\" he says, \"but nobody came to see the first one in the theatre really, so no one wanted it.\"\n\nOf course, the film is considered a cult classic around the world. So the time finally seemed right for the actors to revisit the characters. \"Comedies don't always translate cross-culturally,\" says Owen Wilson, who plays Derek Zoolander's fellow supermodel Hansel. \"But the characters of Derek and Hansel have a level of ridiculousness I think people appreciate. And a kind of following developed. I noticed when I was travelling that there were a lot of people who came up to me quoting Zoolander.\"\n\nContinue reading: Stiller And Wilson Enjoyed Finding The Old Groove In Zoolander 2\n\nZoolander 2's Stupid Humour Has Left Critics Unenthusiastic\n\nBy Holly Williams in Movies / TV / Theatre on 11 February 2016\n\nOne sequel that has apparently divided critics this month is the long awaited 'Zoolander 2'; apparently not worth the wait as the ridiculous jokes have either been brutally slammed by reviewers, or wholeheartedly accepted as deliberately stupid. Either way, no-one's raving too much about the return of Derek and Hansel.\n\nCritics not laughing so much at Zoolander 2\n\nBen Stiller and Owen Wilson's return for this sequel fifteen years after the first movie, in which their male model characters attempt to save the world while saving face at the same time in the ruthless fashion industry. And while the original movie was praised for its silliness, 'Zoolander 2' doesn't seem to have had the same effect on many critics.\n\nContinue reading: Zoolander 2's Stupid Humour Has Left Critics Unenthusiastic\n\nBen Stiller And Owen Wilson Turn Up As 'Zoolander' Characters On 'SNL'\n\nBy Ed Biggs in Movies / TV / Theatre on 08 February 2016\n\nBen Stiller and Owen Wilson made a surprise appearance on ‘Saturday Night Live’ as their dim-witted characters from the Zoolander sequel, and gave their unique insights into the pressing political issues of the day.\n\nThe pair have reprised their roles as Derek Zoolander (Stiller) and Hansel (Wilson) for the long-awaited follow-up to the much loved 2001 original, which comes out on February 12th, and they came in character to visit the ‘SNL’ segment Weekend Update with Colin Jost and Michael Che on Saturday (February 6th), getting huge cheers as they made their way onstage.\n\nHowever, their commentary on the presidential nomination races didn’t extend to much more than the candidates’ fashion senses, as they were asked about Ted Cruz, Bernie Sanders, Hilary Clinton and, of course, Donald Trump.\n\nContinue reading: Ben Stiller And Owen Wilson Turn Up As 'Zoolander' Characters On 'SNL'\n\nBen Stiller And Owen Wilson Strike A Pose At 'Zoolander No 2' Premiere\n\nBy Stephanie Chase in Movies / TV / Theatre on 05 February 2016\n\nBen Stiller and Owen Wilson brought fun, fashion and laughs to London last night, for the premiere of Zoolander No.2 in the capital’s Leicester Square.

The 44-year-old actor is expecting his second child, this time with personal trainer Caroline Lindqvist.

The movie tells the story of two failed salesmen, who manage to get a second chance at a career with internships at google. On the occasion, Wilson sat down with the Metro to talk about the role of a Google intern, his own experience with technology and his thoughts on second chances.\n\nWilson attended the LA premiere of the film this week.\n\nCheck out more photos from the premiere.\n\nContinue reading: Days Before 'The Internship' Hits Theatres, Owen Wilson Talks Technology And Second Chances\n\nIs Wilson And Vaughn's 'The Internship' Just A Big Wet Kiss To Google?\n\nBy Michael West in Movies / TV / Theatre on 07 June 2013\n\nThis should have worked. This really should have worked. The Internship - the new offering from Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson - is a buddy comedy about salesmen Billy and Nick whose careers are torpedoed by the digital world. In attempt to prove their worth in the contemporary world, the guys land internships at Google, along with a group of precocious students and have to compete among the nation's most elite tech savvy employees. Sounds...sort of great, doesn't it? Well it's not, apparently.\n\nThere was always the danger that this thing could turn into a love letter to one of the world's biggest corporations - which it really doesn't need - and it doesn't appear that Wilson and Vaughn have steered completely clear of that potential hazard. \"The Internship is a big wet kiss to Google wrapped in a buddy comedy that asks us to believe that nobody over 40 knows anything about computers or the online universe,\" said Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star. Time Out New York called it, \"A movie sorely bereft of ideas, laughs and justification for the comic duo's undifferentiating self-regard,\" though the Washington Post made it clear that, although the movie doesn't quite work, it's not through lack of trying from Vaughn and Wilson. The newspaper's critic Jen Chaney wrote, \"The fact that this overlong, often preposterous comedy succeeds at all (which it does, only occasionally) proves that the Vaughn/Wilson charm can still work a measure of magic.\"\n\nNevertheless, The Internship should perform reasonably well at the box-office this week (perhaps in the $15 million range), though audiences will have to forgive Vince Vaughn's two consecutive under-performing efforts (The Dilemma, The Watch) and put faith in his reteaming with Wilson.\n\nContinue reading: Is Wilson And Vaughn's 'The Internship' Just A Big Wet Kiss To Google?\n\nVince Vaughn & Owen Wilson Have A Job On Winning People Over In The Internship: Review Round-Up\n\nBy Joe Wilde in Movies / TV / Theatre on 07 June 2013\n\nVince Vaughn stars and writes the new comedy The Internship, bringing in the often used help of Owen Wilson to co-star and co-writer Jared Stern (Wreck-It Ralph,The Watch) with him for buddy comedy. Bringing in the help of fellow light-hearted comedy veteran Shawn Levy (Night At The Museum) to direct, the film finds two recently unemployed, down on their luck average Joe's (Vaughn and Wilson), whose lives it seems have been made redundant by the digital age. Some how though (it's a movie) the pair manage to talk their way into a job a Google each; and soon realise how out of their depth they are. Don't worry though, because with their infinite wisdom of partying, the boys soon make friends.\n\nWatch the trailer for The Internship\n\nContinue reading: Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson Have A Job On Winning People Over In The Internship: Review Round-Up\n\n'The Internship' Reviews – Sorry Guys, This Job's Not For You\n\nBy Jack de Aguilar in Movies / TV / Theatre on 06 June 2013\n\nThis is how internships go: you slog away unpaid for a few weeks until, hopefully, the boss turns around and hands you a contract. The Internship slogs away for a couple hours and no one’s offering Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson a salary.\n\nWatch Vince and Owen chat about The Internship\n\nThe critics haven’t taken kindly to the comedy pair’s attempt to shed light on the modern phenomenon that is an internship. This is a shame, as it’s a story that needs telling. Thousands of hungry job-seekers turn to internships – an attempt to wow a company by literally working for free – to secure full time employment. “The polar opposite of The Social Network, say RedEye in their review, “depicting innovation and intelligence as if they're merely the fruits of ideas burped out by an aging slacker who doesn't know when to shut up.” USA Today joked: “Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson may be the worst interns since Monica Lewinsky,” while The New York Post say, “Director Shawn Levy's work has, as always, all the edge of a tub of margarine - he's the guy who did \"Night at the Museum.\" And \"The Internship\" has the air of a promotional video for Google.”\n\nContinue reading: 'The Internship' Reviews – Sorry Guys, This Job's Not For You\n\nVideo - Owen Wilson And Vince Vaughn Talk Google Paradise And The Realities Of Their New Movie 'The Internship' In An Interview\n\n'Wedding Crashers' stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn discuss their new movie 'The Internship' in an interview.

(Trailer)\n\nBy Jack de Aguilar in Movies / TV / Theatre on 18 February 2013\n\nPerennial funny guys Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are back with another comedy, this time making light of internships and the ‘wacky’ Google offices, in which some of the film was shot.\n\nFor most, the Google offices are a mystery, so filming inside them was a real treat for Vaughn. He says: \"Being from the Midwest, Google always felt like The Wizard Of Oz or the Chocolate Factory (in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory). It's such a different type of place to work at than what is considered a traditional work environment. With the... access to food, the sports on campus, the massages and all that stuff.\"\n\nContinue reading: The Internship: Are Vince Vaughn And Owen Wilson Googling A Hit? (Trailer)\n\nGoogle Search: Generational Clash; New Trailer For Owen Wilson And Vince Vaughn's The Internship Released\n\nBy Contributor in Movies / TV / Theatre on 14 February 2013\n\nIt’s a safe if uninspiring partnership: Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are back together as co-stars in new movie The Internship, which debuted its first trailer earlier this week. We all remember the pair’s previous jaunt together, as cheeky guys out to get laid at weddings in The Wedding Crashers, and we wouldn’t expect the humour for The Internship to be too much different from that run out in 2005.\n\nThe plot stars the pair as salesmen Billy and Nick, whose careers are struggling with the digital world dominating sales. In order to prove to themselves that they’re not obsolete, the pair manage to get themselves onto an internship at Google where, playing their usual dopey, slightly slacker selves, they come up against some of the finest college minds in the USA. I know, larks right? The trailer certainly suggests it, with John Goodman also making an appearance as the boss of their failing company.\n\nFrom the trailer it looks like a classic case of two generations colliding, with the tech-savvy college kids giving the 80’s film referencing Vaughn and Wilson the run-around. However, if we know how these films usually pan out – and we think we do – we reckon that the ageing salesmen might just have the last laugh. See for yourself below, the film is out in cinemas on June 7, 2013.\n\nContinue reading: Google Search: Generational Clash; New Trailer For Owen Wilson And Vince Vaughn's The Internship Released\n\nVideo - P.

Both films are based on the novel from acclaimed author Elmore Leonard, and though Leonard may be able to pen a worth-reading novel, it's plain to see that transposing his words into a worth-viewing film is often an impossible task.\n\nIn this Bounce, Wilson plays vagabond Jack Ryan, a man who's bad luck and bad choices have landed him on the North Shore of Oahu where he takes a job in construction working for shady hotel developer Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise) and his assistant Bob Jr. (Charlie Sheen). It's not long before Jack gets fired and finds new employment as a handyman at a complex of vacation bungalows owned by Judge Walter Crewes (Morgan Freeman). While working for Crewes, Jack becomes enamored with Nancy Hayes (Sara Foster, the poor man's Bridget Fonda), Ritchie's sexpot girlfriend and house-sitter while he escorts his wife (Bebe Neuwirth) on shopping trips in Honolulu. Nancy has a plan to milk Ritchie out of $200,000, and she needs Jack's help to pull it off.\n\nContinue reading: The Big Bounce (2004) Review"
