A top-charting female vocalist of the 1940s, Dinah Shore (Frances Rose Shore), was born to Jewish immigrant shopkeepers in Winchester, Tennessee on February 29th, 1916, a leap year date. Despite childhood polio, she was a singer and performer from a young age and made her way onto radio in the late 1930s (a disc jockey named Martin Block called her “Dinah” after hearing her sing a song of that name). In 1940, Shore was signed by Eddie Cantor as a regular on his radio show, and in 1943 she landed her own show, “Call to Music,” and appeared in a movie alongside Cantor. A favorite among American soldiers during her World War II USO visits, Shore became a television hostess in 1951 and had a series of immensely popular shows and specials all the way into the 1980s, for which she won ten Emmys. Part of her shtik was to have celebrities doing something down-to-earth or unexpected, e.g., Frank Sinatra making spaghetti sauce or Spiro Agnew playing jazz piano. She was also famous for her trademark end-of-show blowing a kiss with the accompanying “mwah!” Shore’s final album, in 1979, was based on her appearance on Sesame Street. Notwithstanding her all-American, clean-cut image, Shore was a tabloid favorite, romantically linked to numerous male celebrities ranging from Sinatra to Burt Reynolds. To see her singing “Down by the Riverside” with Mahalia Jackson, look below.
