        "text": "Frank Sinatra is often described as the Singer of the Century and few could argue that Ol’ Blue Eyes had a truly remarkable life. Few however know the equally fascinating story of Barbara - his fourth and final wife - who died peacefully at home this week, aged ninety.\n\nI’d been a fan of Sinatra’s music since my early twenties, so it was with considerable curiosity that, in 2009, I accepted the commission to write the memoir of his widow, the woman he affectionately called ‘Lady Blue Eyes’. The offer came to me via a Hollywood literary agent for whom I’d already written the bestselling memoirs of Goldie Hawn and Deana Martin, Dean’s daughter, so it felt like a natural fit.\n\nI half-expected the book to be an open love letter to Frank and thought my biggest challenge would be to stop it from becoming a hagiography.\n\nWhenever I visited her, she’d put me in a guest suite of her penthouse apartment in Los Angeles filled with photos of the two of them in happier days. She’d have her staff create a special cocktail in my honor and, even if she was too unwell to get up, we’d lie together on her bed, toast Frank watching old movies with the mute button on, while she told me one wonderful story after another.\n\n“Cary Grant was the sweetest man on the planet.” Or, “David Niven and Frank were constantly playing practical jokes on each other.”\n\nBut I soon discovered that Barbara’s life before Frank could have merited a book by itself. From our very first encounter, I found her fascinating.\n\nBarbara Ann Blakeley was born soon after the Great Depression in small town Bosworth, Missouri. Like many bobby sox wearing teenagers of the era, Barbara was a Sinatra fanatic and would often be found sneaking off to her local drive-in to listen to Frank’s song.\n\nAt five feet eight inches tall with a stunning figure, she won a local beauty pageant and would later set up a modelling school in California, launch her own cosmetics line, and became a beauty consultant to the first Miss Universe contest. Wooed by a local singer named Bob Oliver, she married in her twenties and they had a son, Robert.\n\n“Having Bobby was the best thing I ever did,” she told me, and by her own admission she became an adoring mother to her only child.\n\nHer marriage wasn’t to last and by the time it ended a few years later Barbara was working as a showgirl on the Las Vegas strip, catching the eye of every man she met from Howard Hughes to Elvis Presley and then the 56-year old Zeppo Marx, the good-looking straight-man member of the Marx Brothers who had retired early. They began seeing each other and realising that she couldn’t manage on her own, Barbara married Zeppo in 1959 and moved to Palm Springs where their next-door neighbour was the elusive Frank Sinatra.\n\nHer contact with Frank only really began when his ex-wife Ava Gardner visited and he had a tennis court built especially for her and asked Barbara to organise a few games. Ava was drunk on Moscow Mules before the match even began and all Frank did was flirt outrageously with Barbara to make Ava jealous.\n\n\"She, in turn, flirted with the tennis pro I’d brought along so in the end I left them all to it”, she recalled.\n\nIn his fifties and married three times, Frank was planning to retire. He repeatedly invited Barbara and Zeppo to his legendary all night card and drinking parties, but Zeppo warned Barbara against him, telling her, “Keep away from Frank. He’s trouble.”\n\nHe was right. Frank finally kissed Barbara at a party held by Eva Gabor a year later. When he followed her on holiday to Monaco that summer and introduced her to his friend Princess Grace, the former actress Grace Kelly, their fate was sealed. “I fell so hard for him that I didn’t really have a choice,” she told me.\n\n“It was the hottest day of the year and I was so nervous when I woke up that morning but Frank rang me in my room and told me he couldn’t wait to make me his wife.” Frank was 60 and she 49, and both shed tears of joy as they recited their vows.\n\nShe would tell me later he was the most romantic man she’d ever met. “He left me little notes on the refrigerator, on my desk, on my pillow,” she said, showing me a scrapbook into which she had pasted them all. “He drew dogs and cats and smiley faces and flew me to a restaurant in Europe just for dinner. I had never been so adored.”\n\nIn return, she encouraged him to keep going when he was worried that he was losing his looks and his voice. It was also she who persuaded Frank to record New York New York. “It was Liza Minelli’s song but I knew it was perfect for Frank.”\n\nShe frequently witnessed his famous trigger temper - especially, she said, after he drank gin - but she also knew of his extraordinary generosity. “If he heard that a night club owner from his early days was in trouble, he’d fly his whole band in and put on a show there and donate all the proceeds.”\n\nFrank also helped her set up her eponymous Children’s Centre for victims of sexual abuse, and auctioned off paintings to raise funds. “Few people know how prolific and talented Frank was as an artist. I think he was happiest either painting in his studio. Frank was just a big kid at heart.”\n\nSensing that their time was running out, Barbara and Frank wept as they retook their wedding vows on their twentieth anniversary in 1996, and in his final years Barbara nursed him through heart problems, cancer, and dementia.\n\nHer beloved Frank died on May 14, 1998, after being rushed to hospital with a suspected heart attack. She told me, “I clasped his hand and urged him to keep fighting but his final words were, ‘I can’t.’ I knew then that I had lost him.”\n\nBarbara’s grief was lifelong and deeply private, she never dated again and lived her life in his blessed memory. As she once told me, “How could anyone ever follow Frank?!”\n\nI last saw Barbara in March of this year at her Palm Springs home, soon after her 90th birthday. Frail and thin in a wheelchair, she was nevertheless still the model and beauty queen, her hair immaculately coiffured, her nails painted electric blue, and wearing a fabulous silk blouse.\n\n“Hi, sweetheart!” she cried every time she saw me. “Come on in, sit down, and tell me everything.”\n\nEach year, on the anniversary of Frank’s death, Barbara visited the desert cemetery in Palm Springs where he is buried to lay flowers on his grave. Standing there with her once, I asked her what her epitaph might be. Having thought about it for a moment, she roared with laughter and suggested, “Me too!”\n\nLady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank Sinatra by Barbara Sinatra is published by Arrow.
