        "text": "The singer was born on December 12, 1915 in Hoboken, New Jersey. Here, he's seen as a young boy on a ship with his mother.\n\nSinatra (far right) joined his first singing group, dubbed the Hoboken Four, in 1935. To make ends meet, he also worked as a singing waiter.\n\nIn 1938, Sinatra was arrested for charges of adultery (a crime at the time) in the district of Bergen County, New Jersey. However, the case was said to have been a misunderstanding.\n\nSinatra married to Nancy Barbato in 1939. Both were from Italian families and met during the summer at the Jersey shore. They were wed on February 4 in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\nAfter releasing his first song \"All or Nothing\" with Columbia Records in 1935, Sinatra landed a coveted spot as a singer in Tommy Dorsey and the Pied Pipers. Sinatra (center) had his first big hit with the group, \"I'll Never Smile Again.\"\n\nAfter signing with Tommy Dorsey's band, Sinatra's solo career began to take off and the singer had to negotiate his way out of his tight contact with Dorsey.\n\nSinatra and his wife Nancy welcomed their eldest daughter, Nancy, in 1940. Here, she and her mother greet the singer at Grand Central Station upon his return home from a performance.\n\nIn 1944, Sinatra appeared in his first movie, Higher and Higher. The singer released a new song to the project, \"I Saw You First.\" That same year he also snagged roles in Step Lively, alongside Gloria DeHaven, and Anchors Aweigh, with Gene Kelly.\n\nFrank and Nancy's second child, a son named Frank Jr., was born on January 10, 1944 in Jersey City. Sinatra wasn't able to be present for the birth, but Nancy was sure to include him by posing for photographers with his portrait.\n\nSinatra was presented a special award at the 1945 Academy Awards for his role in the short film The House I Live In and his advocacy for the Tolerance in America crusade. The entertainer was known for speaking out about discrimination in the U.S. against African American and Italian communities.\n\nSinatra's career exploded during World War II, as many of the popular music acts were overseas serving. Although he was denied active service, the singer did his part for the war effort, collecting goods at clothing depots for refugees and performing in shows for the troops.\n\nIn 1947, Sinatra released the now iconic song \"Tea for Two\" with singer Dinah Shore. The pair would remain professionally linked for years to come.\n\nWhile Frank was away touring and performing, his wife Nancy kept a consistent home life for their three children, Nancy, Frank Jr., and Christina.\n\nRumors of Sinatra's infidelity were known for years and, although his wife knew this, the singer's affair with actress Ava Gardner was too much for their union to overcome. Their divorce was finalized in 1951 and in a historic ruling, Nancy received custody of their children, their Los Angeles home, a Cadillac, and a percent of his annual income in the divorce settlement.\n\nAlthough Sinatra had been having extramarital affairs for years, his relationship with Ava Gardner was different. Soon after his divorce, the couple was the hottest new item in Hollywood.\n\nWeeks after his divorce from Nancy was finalized, Sinatra married Gardner. For the bride's third wedding, she wore a grey and white dress and pearls.\n\nAs far as celebrity marriages go, Sinatra and Gardner were not the most smooth sailing. Between traveling for work and infidelity on both sides, the couple was prone to public spats and gossip. Here, they depart for Nairobi to shoot on location for Gardner's movie Mogambo."
