        "text": "PALM SPRINGS TOP CRIMINAL\n\nDEFENSE LAW FIRM\n\nPalm Springs is synonymous with the socialites of the mid-20th century such as Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Arnold Palmer, Bing Crosby, Dinah Shore, Marilyn Monroe, and Sonny Bono. However, even contemporary celebrities frequently visit Palm Springs such as the Kardashian Family, Travis Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie. Removed from the peering eye of the public, these social elites find relative relief in this desert oasis.\n\nThe Palm Springs Film Festival and the notoriousWhite Party attract millions of people from around the world each year. In 202214.1 million people are reported to have visited this chic desert town. Although Palm Springs is known as a vacation get away, within the desert legal community there is a common saying regarding tourists who visit the desert. “They come for a vacation but leave on probation”. Albeit a little tongue and cheek, it is a proverb that is grounded very much in reality. Palm Springs would not be known as a playground for celebrities and visitors if they did not get into trouble from time to time.\n\nPalm Springs\n\nDomestic Violence and Sexual Assault Amongst Same Sex Couples\n\nForest Wilkerson and Joshua Mulligan have years of experience working with the LGBTQIA2s+ community from young juveniles to adults and retirees. We understand that the legal profession has historically been prejudicial to members of the LGBTQIA2s+ community. But when you meet Forest Wilkerson and Joshua Mulligan you can rest assured you will be met with the upmost respect and professionalism, regardless of your creed, color or code.\n\nJoshua Mulligan has handled dozens of domestic violence and sexual assault cases that involve same sex partners and found a resolution that satisfy both parties. At the end of the day what matters most to these attorneys is the facts of the case and what legal defense is most appropriate for you.\n\n“These guys are awesome! No need to call anybody else! So detail oriented, and they will go to bat for you! I'm not a fan of attorneys, except for these guys! 10 stars!!!”\n\n—Justin S., Client\n\nReviews\n\n“Josh and Forrest care about their clients. They came to see me while i was still in custody, They answer all phone calls and texts. They don't give up even when the cards are stacked up against them.”\n\n— R. Smith, Client\n\n“If you're looking for a successful outcome with a positive experience in the most scariest times of your life in a criminal case or hearing you must consult with her law firm.”\n\n— Anonymous, Client\n\nChem Sex\n\nChem Sex or more commonly known as “party and play” is a unique cultural phenomenon mostly associated but not exclusive to gay men. The term refers to the practice of ingesting drugs to enhance sexually activity. This is a sexual subculture where men meet other consenting parties often time through dating apps such as Grindr. The most common used drugs associated with chem sex are methamphetamine and GHB. Like any recreational activity that is stimulated by the use of drugs certain risk are to be expected.\n\nThe most common risk involved apart from long term health concerns are overdose and consent between intoxicated parties. The issue of consent is complicated by the incapacitating nature of methamphetamine or GHB. You may find yourself accused of sexual assault or even rape from an individual who had granted consent before and during the sexual act. However, due to the involvement of drugs even when both parties’ consent, police and the district attorney’s office may pursue charges. If you find yourself in this situation the most prudent next step is to contact an attorney, preferably one who has managed chem sex cases before.\n\nSection 14\n\nUnbeknownst to many residents of Palm Springs, in the late 1950’s early 1960’s a one-square- mile area near downtown Palm Springs was home to a historic Black and Latino community. This area was known as section 14.\n\nDue to archaic land leasing laws the Agua Caliente tribe was prevented from developing this plot of land until the late 1950’. Coupled with discriminatory housing practice that restricted African- American and Latino families from living in other developed part of the city, the Agua Caliente tribe leased this property to these minority groups. However, as Palm Springs developed and regularly attracted social elites, the plot of land became an eye sore that required pruning. Thus, in the 1960’s the City of Palm Springs condemned and destroyed these homes. With little alternative many families were forced to leave the valley for neighboring communities in San Bernardino, Banning and Northern Palm Springs.\n\nNorthen Palm Springs Gangs\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that these displaced communities faced continued discrimination and some members turned to criminal activities. Most notably in the region is the formation of the Gateway Posse Crips who emerged in the 1980, originating from the northern end of the city and named itself after Gateway drive, in the deserts highlands/ Gateway area. Joshua and Forest are experienced defending clients with ties to criminal organizations. They understand that the Riverside prosecution office aggressively pursues enhance charges against any persons thought or perceived to have connections to gangs. Regardless of your previous affiliation or current status, Forest and Joshua are only concern with the facts of your case and creating the staunchest legal defense available.\n\nAgua Caliente Casino Palm Springs\n\nFor generations, the Coachella Valley has been and still is the ancestral home of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. Given their sovereign status, the Agua Caliente tribe is permitted to own and operate casinos within their territory. The tribe manages three major casinos; the Spa Resort Casino in Palm Springs, the Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa in Rancho Mirage and most recently theAgua Caliente Casino in Cathedral City. Any activity that involves alcohol and large sums of money, tensions may run high and transform a joyous atmosphere into a negative experience. At Wilkerson and Mulligan, we have defended multiple cases that have originated from one of these venues. Ranging from severe charges as assault to a simple charge of public intoxication."
