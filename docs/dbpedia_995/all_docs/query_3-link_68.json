        "text": "Today on Days to Remember, we celebrate Dinah Shore’s birthday.\n\nWhat year was our leap year baby born on?\n\nDinah Shore (born Frances Rose Shore) and was born on February 29, 1916, and was an American singer, actress, television personality, and the top-charting female vocalist of the 1940s.\n\nAfter failing singing auditions for the bands of Benny Goodman, and both Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Shore struck out on her own to become the first singer of her era to achieve huge solo success.\n\nShe had a string of 80 charted popular hits, spanning the years 1940 to 1957, and after appearing in a handful of feature films went on to a four-decade career in American television, starring in her own music and variety shows from 1951 through 1963 and hosting two talk shows in the 1970s.\n\nFrances Rose Shore was born to Russian-Jewish immigrant shopkeepers, Anna (née Stein) and Solomon Shore, in Winchester, Tennessee.\n\nShe had a sister, eight years older, named Elizabeth, known as “Bessie.” When she was two years old, she was stricken with polio (infantile paralysis), a disease that was not preventable at the time, and for which the only treatment was bed rest.\n\nHer parents provided intensive care for her, suggesting rigorous exercising. She recovered, but she sustained a deformed foot and limp.\n\nI remember Dinah Show from her talk show host days, before Oprah came on with her show in the afternoons. Dinah Shore was the queen of the talk show world at that time.\n\nDo you remember the Dinah Shore Show?\n\nToday’s YouTube presentation brought to you by user name, (Ben Ohmart) gives you a little slide show of how Dinah Shore all came about lading her spot in the Queen of Talk Show Hosts.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Shore had a long and happy public romance with actor Burt Reynolds who was twenty years her junior. The relationship gave Shore an updated, sexy image, and took some of the pressure off Reynolds in maintaining his image as a ladies’ man.\n\nThe couple was featured in the tabloids and after the relationship cooled, the tabloids paired Shore with other younger men, including Wayne Rogers, Andy Williams, Iggy Pop and “Tarzan” actor Ron Ely. In her later years, Shore also dated novelist Sidney Sheldon, Dean Martin, and former New York Governor Hugh Carey.\n\nAs we celebrate and remember Dinah Shore, today on her birthday!"
