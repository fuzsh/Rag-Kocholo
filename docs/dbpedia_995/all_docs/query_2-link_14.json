        "text": "1940s\n\nTommy Harrison, a JU music professor and longtime pop music buff, points out that many songs in the 1940s had to make it on their own. People were buying the songs for the music, not a package with an associated lifestyle or star image. That is, aside from Frank Sinatra (the Rat Pack came later). There was also Bing Crosby, Dinah Shore, Glenn Miller, Nat King Cole, Perry Como and a few others whose public personas weren't yet fully developed. Overall, a clean-cut, professional and classy (read: impeccably dressed) group of artists who could sing - without Auto-Tune.\n\nSlideshow: Generational Music\n\n1950s\n\nElvis, considered oh-so risque at the time, explored sexual innuendo. He was a \"package\" that dominated, but there were plenty of others such as Connie Francis, Pat Boone, Chuck Berry, The Everly Brothers, Peggy Lee, Buddy Holly and Little Richard. A quite varied bunch ranging from wholesome to wild, largely because rock 'n' roll entered the picture midway. But even during the rock years, it ranged from the goodness of Buddy Holly to the scandalous marriage of Jerry Lee Lewis to a young girl.\n\n1960s\n\nThere's a plethora of diverse personas from the 1960s. On-the-fringe hippie culture, which transformed into a popular style, wasn't everything. Hippies just seem to get the most attention because of their \"free love,\" long hair, drugs and music by bands such as The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and The Grateful Dead. But there were also folkies like Bob Dylan and Joan Baez singing about social justice; R&B stars like Aretha Franklin and The Supremes; and the British Invasion with The Rolling Stones. One particularly distinct change took place in the latter part: the introduction of drug use as a central part of popular music culture.\n\n1970s\n\nDisco and cocaine, arena rock and heroin. Songs about sweet romance were traded for songs about sex. Again, the personas vary widely. The Bee Gees, Donna Summer and KC and the Sunshine Band were at the top of the flashy, club and dance-oriented disco scene. Arena rock mostly focused on bands as a whole rather than a single star, celebrating the loud, reckless party mode of bands like Aerosmith. Early on, David Bowie was in his dramatic androgynous phase. In the later years, angry and politically charged punk emerged, led mostly by British bands such as The Clash and The Sex Pistols.\n\n1980s\n\nNew wave and punk kicked things off with nonconformist fashions and unconventional ideologies. New Wavers like Talking Heads and Devo had colorful, quirky, humorous personas; punk rockers with a kiss-off attitude used scare tactics by wearing things like chains and mohawks. More men in music started wearing makeup. It was largely in the name of expressing dissatisfaction with societal mores and government. As times changed, artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, Cyndi Lauper and Prince took over, embracing flashiness and taking the solo star phenomenon higher than ever. The more ostentatious, the better. When rap began to rise in status, led by Run DMC and Public Enemy, it shaped the future of pop music personas and much of the music we hear today.\n\n1990s\n\nBoy bands, boy bands, boy bands. New Kids on the Block, Backstreet Boys, Boyz II Men, 'N Sync and others portrayed themselves as slick, smooth-talking and romantic. As with the boy bands, vocals were central with artists like Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, but how much skin they bared was important, too. It's arguable that for women, being \"sexy\" became more important than the music. Many of the biggest rappers - Ice-T, NWA, Snoop Doggy Dog - drew criticism for glorifying violence and drugs, but hip-hop expanded in many different directions. On the rock side, being grungy became desirable. The personas of bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden screamed, \"I don't care.\"\n\n2000s\n\nThink about Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and 50 Cent. Stars' images have loomed over pop music this century. Driven by images of wealth and sex appeal, many stars seemed bigger and less real than ever. Yet, in an age of the Internet and \"American Idol,\" the everyday-person-turned-superstar persona also prevailed. And in contrast to a lifestyle of excess sold by big producers, some artists in genres from rock to hip-hop spread messages of being independent, anti-corporate, socially conscious and green."
