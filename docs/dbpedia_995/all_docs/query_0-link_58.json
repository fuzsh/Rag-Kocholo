        "text": "If we are going to be absolutely serious, the fairest answer would be that no one has an equivalent. Each person is a world into his or her own, artists included. This means that it's not just Frank who doesn't have an equivalent. Irene Kral, Cher, Morgana King (to mention some of the names offered in previous posts): none of them have an equivalent, either.\n\nOkay, that was my attempt at a serious answer.\n\nIsn't this thread more about offering some food for thought and having fun along the way, though? Hope so. With that approach in mind:\n\n(Vocal starts around :14.)\n\nHere are some of the points that I take into consideration as I make my nomination ...\n\nONE\n\nWednesday, December 30, 1942, at the Paramount Theatre, in New York's Times Square: The Dawn of the Vocalist's Era. If you don't know the story, you should. Briefly put, that's the date and event which music critics have traditionally pinpointed as a symbolic marker, signifying the ascension of singers to the top position in music popularity. What happened during that apocalyptic, end-of-the-year engagement at that historical location (\"the center of the world\")? Well, Frank Sinatra's apotheosis -- that's what happened. And guess which female singer was on the same bill, thus being a witness to the dawn and coronation (as well as a side participant)? Yes, that right: Peggy Lee.\n\nTWO\n\nWhile under Capitol contract in the mid-1950s, Frank made arrangements with the label in order to set up his own music imprint. In time, he conceived projects for two Capitol artists, the very first of them being a female singer. Guess who? Yep, Peggy. As most of us who are fans of Frank know, he became heavily involved in the direction and production of the album, conducting the orchestra himself and even making suggestion(s) for the front cover. It could be argued that, had Frank been a woman, this is the concept album that (s)he would have envisioned \"him-herself\" doing at that point it time (1957).\n\nTHREE\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the press asked Frank about female singers whose musical craftsmanship he currently admired and/or approved. (I'm paraphrasing here, since I don't have the article in front of me). Among the two or three women that he singled out for praise: why, Peg, of course. (Conversely, and infamously, he offered negative criticism of Ella Fitzgerald's singing. Fortunately, he would go back to showing enthusiasm for Ella in later years.)\n\n(The Nordic head is tellingly tilting toward\n\nthe Italian bambino, whose gaze says it all.\n\nIrish eyes are not smiling.)\n\nFOUR\n\nIn the late 1980s, Frank and the rest of the rat pack were scheduled to give a concert benefit at Radio City Music Hall, along with Liza Minnelli. When Liza suddenly reported that she was sick and couldn't attend, who was promptly recruited to take on the female role? Um-hmmm. La Lee.\n\nFIVE\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Society of Singers honored Frank with their highest award. As the reporter in this clip aptly states, one of the emotional highlights of the evening took place when a 70-year-old woman sang special lyrics in Frank's honor, to the tune of the standard \"The Man I Love.\" An emotional Mister Sinatra was caught wiping away a tear. The singing septuagenarian was -- who else but -- Miss Lee.\n\nAll the happenings that I described point to a strong connection, both musical and personal, between Sinatra and Lee. He seems to have considered her a close peer, and perhaps one of his \"equals\" in the world of music.\n\nSIX +++\n\nThere are quite a few additional parallels, statistics and factoids that could also be mentioned. Frank offered a very masculine personality to the world; Peggy cultivated a very feminine persona. The dark side of their personalities came out in some of their music. You will be hard-pressed to find other singers of their time who recorded concept albums as dark as She Shot Me Down and Mirrors. Both vocalists were once trapped under the big band wings of hard task makers -- Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman -- whom the singers credited as key influences for some particular aspects of their craft. Both singers shared a strong affinity for the work of Alec Wilder, and were supportive of him; both singers happened to get into trouble with a more famous composer, Richard Rodgers. Like Frank, Peggy would receive lots of critical/peer praise for not only her balladry but also her highly developed sense of swing. While no other contemporary vocalist (male or female ) came close to Frank in the following regard, Peggy was one of the precious few singers of their generation to also manage to have chart hits as late as 1969. The parallel in the charts has has some continuity during recent years, when latter-day compilations by both of them have made the Billboard charts ....... I imagine that I could come up with more stuff, but this is already long enough.\n\nObviously, there are other female singers who could be justly compared with Frank as well, on account of some significant aspects of their career. If we were to concentrate on film, Doris Day would have to come up as a counterpart. (She could actually be the greater film star of the two, I suppose?) If we were to measure equivalency by all-time popularity, Ella Fitzgerald would have to be brought up, because she is the most remembered & revered female singer of that era, just as Frank is for the other gender. But, when we leave aside those very general, broad-stroke similarities, I don't see much in common with either of these great ladies.\n\nSarah Vaughan might be the most frequently mentioned name in this thread, so far. Lest it seems otherwise, let me preface my comment by stating that I'm a fan of hers. I'm likely to have collected nearly everything that she recorded, and I do love lots of it .... With that said, I cannot think of any highly celebrated singer who botched so many lyrics in her lifetime. She herself admitted at one point that the melody was what she really, really loved, and that lyrics were, at best, secondary to her. That's why, even if I were to sense any strong similarities between them, I'd still never be able to name Sarah as a counterpart to an interpreter as exquisitely attuned to the emotional content and meaning of a lyric as Frank (or Peggy) could be. (Once again, don't get me wrong: Sarah is and will forever be divine. Just not Frank's Olympian consort.)\n\nPosts like this are what makes this forum such a great place to spend one's time.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time and effort to contribute this for the rest of us!!!\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nDavid\n\nYeah. I can easily see how the names brought up by Bob might have been the ones that Frank mentioned consistently or repeatedly. At the same time, I bet that, if we kept digging, we'll probably come up with even more female singers that Frank also praised at one particular time or another.\n\nCase in point: I'm pretty sure that I have read comments from Frank in which he was hugely complimentary of Dinah Shore's singing. In that particular case, we would have to take into account the fact that the two of them started together (well, sort of) on the radio, which must have created a bond that they maintained for a lifetime. (Plus, just about everybody seems to have liked Dinah's personality; people probably felt predisposed to flatter and empathize with her.)\n\nThe claim about Frank's love for Nancy's singing: I had heard it before, but had totally forgotten about it. Glad you brought it up. It seems perfectly possible, particularly in the 1960s, when Capitol had Nancy record mostly standards, rather than the more r&b flavored stuff that she apparently favors (i.e., the style toward which she moved later in her career). On the flip side, it's hard to put a whole lot of stock on a third-hand comment, all the more so when it comes from a man who disliked Sinatra's singing for decades (finally changing his mind, for the better, more recently), and from a lady with whom Frank did not exactly cohabit (looks to me like most of what they did was partying and ... hold private meetings from time to time, over the years at her home or elsewhere) ... So: I do not disbelieve this, but I still feel that, until some corroboration shows up, it is indeed a good idea to preface the claim with the words \"if you believe\" ...\n\nAgree that singers naturally have admiration for many of their peers. Some could actually be very (uh) vocal in their public expressions of admiration. By the same token, many a vocalist of that era, including Frank, must have hated the singing of this or that particular peer, but we might never find out about it, because such expressions of dislike are likely to have been voiced mostly in private ... That's one of the reasons why those \"blindfold tests,\" published in jazz magazines, can make for fun reading. Sometimes, while listening to another performer, without knowing who the performer is, the blindfolded artists could be too honest for their own good!"
