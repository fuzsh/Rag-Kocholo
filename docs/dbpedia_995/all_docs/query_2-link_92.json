Growing up in Brooklyn, NY, Frankie Jr. went to the prestigious Music and Art High School as a classical violinist. After moving to Roosevelt, NY., Frank attended Howard University, where he earned a Bachelors Degree in Music Education. While attending Howard, he became a member of OMEGA PSI PHI FRATERNITY, INC. and PHI MU ALPHA SINFONIA MUSIC FRATERNITY. After graduation from Howard, Frank taught vocal music at Mulligan Jr. High School in Central Islip, NY during the day and performed in various New York nightclubs, as a singer and keyboardist, with his own Rhythm and Blues bands. For a decade, from\n\nMusic was heard playing from everywhere during the twenties. Most individuals were celebrating or enjoying themselves due to the economic boost. Therefore, many individuals became flappers during this age. A flapper is simply stated as a “stylish young woman”. During the twenties, the flappers were dancers who were hired to entertain others at bars and various parties. This is when the popular movie, “The Great Gatsby” comes to mind. They show numerous parties where flappers are everywhere and there are also many people, with various instruments, playing jazz. Louis Armstrong became famous during this time with his many popular songs such as, “Blues in the Night”. More famous artists also came about during this time such as, the King and Carter Jazzing Orcchestra and the Ray Miller Orchestra. However, one of the most popular songs known is “What Is This Thing Called Love?” by Cole Porter, which was produced for the musical Wake Up and Dream. This song continued to be a hit for years to come as it was remastered and used in many different various forms. It was redone in 1956 by Clifford Brown and Max Roach with Sonny Rolling and was known to be the best remastered guitar version of its\n\n“We are all gathered here tonight to talk about a recent series of events that has come to my attention,” said Cotton Mather as he looked out at the group of board members. Anne Hutchinson was always the one to speak at these kinds of meetings, but I guess she allowed Cotton to take over for the night. Everyone sat eagerly at the edge of their seats except for Anne, who already knew what this breaking news was. The other board members were Jonathan Edwards and William Penn, two men who never seemed to get along with each other. William just wanted things to be peaceful, but Jonathan always took to more dark and violent route. They sat at opposite ends of the room, and rarely said a word to each other - well, at least not any kind ones. “Two\n\nRay Charles was born on Sept. 23, 1930, in Albany, Georgia, and grew up in Greenville, Florida. At the young age of five, he began losing his sight, and became completely blind by the time he was seven. However, this did not hinder Ray Charles at all, as he continued to persevere in developing his musical talents. One of the most unique aspects of Ray Charles was his unparalleled ability to crossover different genres of music. He mixed together genres such as blues, jazz, gospel, R&B, pop, and even country. With this integration, he created smash hits such as “I Got a Woman,” “Hit the Road Jack,” and “I Can’t Stop Loving You.” When a listener listens close enough to one of Charles’ songs, aspects of the various styles he incorporated can be heard not only through the way the lyrics are\n\nIn the first chapter, this essay primarily addressed the musical aspects of Frank Sinatra. This section will examine his celebrity image, and how it reflected the values of popular culture that spanned his career. Sinatra was the first musician, more specifically a singer, to achieve this kind of fame and notoriety among his audiences. Intentional or not, he started a trend in popular music that would later be replicated by many artists, including Elvis, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, and Barbara Streisand.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, as Sinatra was commonly known, decided to start his solo career in 1942, after a brief period singing with Harry James and the Tommy Dorsey Band. Many well-known singers preceded him, such as Billy Holiday and Bing Crosby. None of these performers, however great, led completely self-sufficient careers of their own. Gardner attests that “Sinatra’s success cemented the notion of the interpretive singer as an autonomous musician – in service to the song but also owning it, at least for the duration of the performance”. Given the type of personality he possessed, this was not surprising. Frank had the “street-smarts”, the intelligence, drive, and talent to sustain a solo career.\n\nHowever, Tony Bennett has a reputation of never making “non-thoughtful records” (Handy). Each duet album he has produced (Duets: An American Classic, Duets II, A Wonderful World) is sublime and has no hint of acting like a last effort for an aging musician. Bennett has been singing for many decades; his career first began when in 1951, when he released “Because of You” his first number one pop song (Grow). Since then Bennett has become one of the most famous names in the contemporary jazz world. His talent has remained consistent over time and his popularity has only continued to increase due to his frequent collaborations with younger popular music\n\nThe music of the 1940’s was the Big Band sound like Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman. Popular singers were the Andrews Sisters, Kay Kaiser and many other famous ones. There were crooner style singers, including Bing Crosby, whose smooth voice made him one of the most popular singers. There was Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Tony Bennett, Pat Boone, Nat King Cole, Kate Smith and Perry Como. All of these very popular singers led the hit parade. They sang the songs that went with the mood of the country in the early 50s. Many of these crooners became the idols of the decade’s later rock and roll stars, who used their influence to create a unique sound.\n\nAs Frank Sinatra grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey, and was a classic representation of an average Italian American. He was the child of two Italian American immigrants, was Roman Catholic, but unlike others, he was particularly interested in singing, and he was good at it. Sinatra started off performing at family get togethers with his ukulele and before everyone knew it he was a great American singer, actor, and producer.\n\nGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen, today we have the great privilege of being able to listen to a man that I like to refer to as the new rap royalty. Picture driving in your car and let’s say you’re stuck in traffic and you’re looking for something to listen to on the radio to buy the time, you can turn on just about half of music stations nowadays and you’ll find one rapper that happens to be everywhere you turn, Drake. Drake has become one of the fastest growing and interesting empires that we have seen from the hip-hop scene in a long time.\n\n“My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” This is a famous quote said by President John Fitzgerald Kennedy when he was getting to take the oath of holding the potential position during the Inaugural address. This quote has been an inspiration of an unaccountable number of American lives.\n\nWalt Disney once said, “It’s kind of fun to do the impossible,” and I guess he was right. Disney made films that made a wooden puppet into a real boy, a thief into a handsome, and a beast into a man. Disney created dreams for little kids of becoming royalty, but was that all they had in mind? Although Disney films may seem full of happy thoughts with true love’s kiss, but in reality they are just bibidi bodibi booed with a dash of pixie dust to hide the real truth behind the films."
