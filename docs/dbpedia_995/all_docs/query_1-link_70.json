        "text": "Arguments regarding the four CV Link-related measures that will appear on Rancho Mirage voters' April ballot were unanimously approved by City Council members at a special meeting Tuesday, despite repeated calls for change from the Coachella Valley Association of Governments.\n\nThe trail, designed as a 50-mile route connecting the Coachella Valley, would potentially allow pedestrians, bikers and slow-speed electric vehicles to travel between Palm Springs and the Salton Sea.\n\nThe $100 million needed before construction begins in 2017 would be paid for through several grants as well as regional transportation funding such as Measure A funds, according to CVAG.\n\nRancho Mirage council members have been openly against allowing the proposed route for the city, citing the proposed costs of operation and maintenance as \"extraordinarily expensive\" in the approved ballot arguments.\n\nIn April, voters will read these arguments in accompaniment to the three advisory measures in connection to the CV Link and a fourth that would require future city councils from allowing small electric vehicles on several designated streets without first going to the voters.\n\nThe four measures Rancho Mirage voters will decide are:\n\nMeasure 1: Shall the city of Rancho Mirage require that any future amendment or repeal of Ordinance No. 1099, which currently prohibits neighborhood electric vehicles (not including golf carts) on or adjacent to certain designated streets including Highway 111; Bob Hope Drive; Country Club Drive; Da Vall Drive; Dinah Shore Drive; Frank Sinatra Drive; Gerald Ford Drive; Magnesia Falls Drive; Monterey Avenue; Plumley Road, and others, be subject to prior voter approval?\n\nMeasure 2: Do you approve of the Coachella Valley Association of Governments (CVAG) spending $100 million or more to construct the CV Link, plus, according to the March 2015 Master Plan, an additional $1.6 million annually to operate and maintain the CV Link pathway, which CVAG proposes to extend through Rancho Mirage business and residential districts?\n\nMeasure 3: If CV Link were to be constructed, would you approve the City Council committing Rancho Mirage to pay for CV Link’s annual operations and maintenance expenses, which on April 6, 2015, CVAG projected Rancho Mirage’s share to be between $110,300 and $251,800 per annum as of the ninth year of operations, and continuing to increase annually at the rate of inflation?\n\nMeasure 4: Because in 2002 County voters approved Measure A, which is a half-cent increase in our sales tax to be used to repair dilapidated and crumbling roads and highways in the Coachella Valley, should CVAG be allowed to divert up to $20 million from this Measure A fund, to pay for the construction of the Neighborhood Electric Vehicles portion of the CV Link?\n\nThe arguments, which will be distributed to voters along with sample ballots, call the CV Link \"expensive,\" \"unsafe\" and \"disruptive\" to residential communities, while detailing financial reasons why council members have long opposed the trail.\n\nErica Felci, governmental projects manager for CVAG, said because of the political nature of the election, the agency would be unable to make specific comments on the ballot arguments, but did add that there have been repeated requests for language changes preceding the approval.\n\nAt the Dec. 17 council meeting, Felci expressed concern that despite the city's assurance that CVAG would be able to weigh in on the language of the arguments, which she has repeatedly called \"misleading,\" city staff have yet to meet with her.\n\nIn order to promote greater public response, she also had recommended that the city wait until Jan. 7 to approve the arguments, which would have given voters until mid-January to submit their arguments to the city instead of the current Dec. 31 deadline.\n\nAt Tuesday's sparsely-attended meeting, no public comments were made. City Clerk Cindy Scott said that as of that day, no opposition arguments had been filed with the city.\n\nMayor Dana Hobart said this lack of opposition means the arguments should make it to the ballot largely unchanged.\n\nRegistered voters have until Dec. 31 to submit their own arguments and suggestions for arguments to the City Clerk.\n\nAnna Rumer is a public safety reporter for The Desert Sun.
