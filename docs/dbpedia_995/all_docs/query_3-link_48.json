        "text": "Dinah Shore and George Montgomery built their first desert home in 1952. Located in the old Movie Colony neighborhood of Palm Springs, the home was built on land purchased from the estate belonging to studio mogul, Daryl Zanuck.\n\nFor decades, Shore was the official hostess of the Colgate and later the Kraft Nabisco Women’s Golf Tournament, which was nicknamed “The Dinah” in her honor. Montgomery, a very talented artist as well as actor, left a great legacy of sculpture and hand-crafted furniture to the Palm Springs Art Museum. The couple is buried opposite each other in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cathedral City."
