        "text": "Before Barbara Sinatra was \"Lady Blue Eyes,\" hobnobbing back and forth from tennis matches with celebrity friends to glittery star-filled charity events, the model turned child advocate was Barbara Blakely, born in Bosworth, Missouri to poor parents. In adolescence she would be criticized for her appearance and country twang.\n\nIt was after her move to Long Beach with her mother that she used her tall and thin demeanor to her advantage and began modeling. She was accepted into the Robert Edward School of Professional Modeling, became a model of the month and, in 1948, was named queen of the Belmont Shore pageant.\n\nShe wouldn’t come to meet Frank Sinatra, her neighbor and friend at first, for years to come.\n\nREAD MORE: Barbara Sinatra dies at 90, remembered as woman who transcended role as 'Mrs. Frank Sinatra'\n\nBarbara’s first marriage was to Bob Oliver, a singer and friend of Nat King Cole who played piano at their wedding. They moved to New York where Barbara became a model represented by Ford Modeling Agency, and got work for Vogue and Life magazines. She also became pregnant with her one and only child, Robert.\n\nShe eventually moved back to Long Beach after Oliver failed to succeed in New York, and opened up her own modeling business – Barbara Blakely School of Modeling. The two eventually divorced.\n\nIn 1956, Barbara gave up her modeling agency and moved to Las Vegas with then boyfriend Joe Graydon, a singer who got a disc jockey job. She became a showgirl in Las Vegas, working at the Riviera Hotel, which is where she met Zeppo Marx, also a singer and one of the famous Marx Brothers. It was also at the Riviera that she reportedly had her first encounter with Sinatra and had to stave off his flirtations.\n\nMarx had a home at Tamarisk Country Club. When she wanted to get out of Vegas to find a safer environment for her son Robert, Zeppo offered to pay Bobby’s tuition to a Long Beach military school and Barbara’s rent at a motel next to the Racquet Club in Palm Springs.\n\nREAD MORE: Barbara Sinatra helped more than 20,000 abused children get treatment\n\nShe divorced Oliver and then married Marx in 1959. Robert was not formally adopted by Zeppo, but eventually took his last name.\n\nMoving to the desert was a turning point in her life as she became a young socialite and a fixture at the star-filled Racquet Club in Palm Springs. She hit tennis balls with Dinah Shore, who became one of her best friends, and Tony Curtis, escorted by Marilyn Monroe while they were having an affair.\n\nThe Marxes were prominent, noted Gloria Greer, who covered the local social scene from 1961 until her death in 2015,\n\n“Certainly she achieved more social prominence because of where she went with Frank. But she did it on her own, too. She and Dinah used to play golf at Tamarisk in the summer and nobody was down here. They used to wear their swimming suits and go around the golf course and jump in people’s pools,” Greer said.\n\nLiving in glamorous Palm Springs was dichotomous to her tough times growing up in Missouri.\n\n“I played a lot of tennis and golf,” said Barbara. “We played golf in the morning, then we’d eat lunch or brunch. Then we’d go to the Racquet Club and play tennis until it was time to have cocktails. It was a wonderful life. At that time, it was total happiness.”\n\nREAD MORE: Sinatra golf event will live on in December without celebrities\n\nBut she never forgot her humble beginnings and began to give back through charitable work like the many other wives of the rich and famous.\n\nBarbara’s good friend Nelda Linsk, whom she met at the Racquet Club, modeled alongside her and together they served on the same boards.\n\n“Florence Swanson was a trustee for Eisenhower Medical at Eisenhower Medical Center and they were building Collector’s Corner. So she called Barbara and asked if we would co-chair a fashion show. So we did that. That was kind of the beginning of our charity work,” said Linsk.\n\nThe Marxes and Sinatra were friends and neighbors living across a fairway from each other at Tamarisk Country Club in Rancho Mirage. They all went on trips together to Las Vegas as well. Barbara and Frank eventually became more than friends, starting an affair while Barbara was still married to Zeppo, who was having his own flings too.\n\n“In the beginning, it was kind of hush-hush,” Linsk said of Barbara and Frank. “But she always said she was going to build a tunnel from her house to Frank’s house across the fairway.”\n\nSinatra’s mother, Dolly, wasn’t happy about the relationship. Sinatra bought her a house next door to his on Frank Sinatra Drive, but Dolly wouldn’t come to her son’s compound if she knew Barbara was there.\n\nREAD MORE: Celebrities remember Barbara Sinatra through the years\n\n“I heard through the grapevine that she’d asked Frank, “Aren’t there enough whores around? Why do you have to work on your best friend’s wife?’” Barbara wrote. “I think she was probably the only person Frank was afraid of his whole life.”\n\nBarbara and Zeppo divorced in 1973. Barbara and Frank began to date openly and finally in 1976, he proposed, kind-of, after being given an ultimatum.\n\nBarbara told him during a Lake Tahoe engagement, if he didn’t commit to marriage, she was leaving. Sinatra didn’t bite and Barbara flew home.\n\nSinatra went to his next concert in Chicago, but tracked Barbara down to a tennis tournament in Las Vegas. He had a driver waiting at her hotel to drive her to the airport, where a plane would fly her to Chicago.\n\nSo, she left in her tennis attire, flew to Chicago, went to his suite and found a room filled with flowers. Sinatra placed a large diamond and emerald on the bed, and said, “You can have these set here in Chicago.” Barbara had them set as an engagement ring, and then she waited for him to propose.\n\n“He decided to give it to me in champagne,” she told The Desert Sun. “He said, ‘Put it on,’ and I said, ‘No, you put it on,’ and I went like this (extending her fingers). I wanted to see if he’d put it on the right finger. And he did.\n\n\"It wasn’t a real proposal, but, she said, “I thought that was the closest I was going to get.”\n\nBarbara wed Frank on July 11, 1976, at the Annenberg estate after a pre-wedding party at Melvyn's in the Ingleside Inn. She signed a prenuptial agreement and was his last wife.\n\nREAD MORE: Barbara Sinatra's funeral to take place in Palm Desert\n\nAt almost 22 years, their marriage lasted longer than any of his three previous marriages. It was while she was with Frank though, that her philanthropic legacy was created in the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center for sexually and physically abused children.\n\nBarbara often wondered why, out of all the women in the world, Sinatra chose her to be his wife after his failed marriage to Gardner and then Mia Farrow in the late 1960s. His first wife, Nancy Barbato, was the mother of his three children and is now 100.\n\n“I’ve tried to analyze it,” Barbara told The Desert Sun. \"I think it’s because we were friends before anything romantic happened. He would call and chat, but it wasn’t romantic until later. It’s something you can’t explain why or how it happened.”\n\nBarbara Sinatra Milestones\n\nBorn: Barbara Blakely, Oct. 16, 1926, in Bosworth, Mo., where her father ran a general store.\n\nFirst recognition: Named the Queen of Belmont Shore in 1948 when she was modeling in Long Beach.\n\nFirst marriage: In 1948 to Bob Oliver, a singer who thought he sounded like Frank Sinatra.

She then helped launch the Miss Universe pageant, developed a cosmetics line, turned \"Barbara Blakely and Her Cover Girl Models\" into a one-year TV series and divorced Bob.\n\nLas Vegas years: Barbara gave up her modeling agency and moved to Las Vegas in 1956 with then boyfriend Joe Graydon, a singer who got a disc jockey job.
