        "text": "Would it sound as good if it were “Frank Sinatra’s Tuna Casserole?”\n\nHey, you know what? Frank tells you to make tuna casserole, you make the tuna casserole.\n\nFortunately for us, it’s sausage and peppers.\n\nFrank Sinatra died this week (May 14) 13 years ago. I still remember it so clearly. I was getting ready for work when my mom called to tell me the news. ‘Oh man,’ I thought, ‘How am I going to break the news to Don Corleone?’\n\nWe had been married only nine months, and this was the first “big” news I had to break to him. He was (and is) a HUGE Sinatra fan. I knew I had to be gentle and sensitive. How would I, in my new role as a loving wife, handle this momentous occasion?\n\nI hung up the phone, went into the bedroom where The Don was dressing for work, and blurt out, “Guess what! Frank Sinatra died!”\n\nSmooth.\n\nDon’t beat around the bush, that’s my motto.\n\nThis is the recipe that Frank Sinatra prepared when he appeared on Dinah Shore’s television show, and you can also find it in her cookbook:\n\nFrank Sinatra’s Sausage and Peppers\n\n1 lb hot Italian sausage\n\n3 green bell peppers\n\n3/4 cup red wine\n\n3 tbsp olive oil\n\nsalt and pepper (optional)\n\nDirections:\n\nRemove stems and seeds from peppers and cut into large chunks. In an ovenproof baking dish that can be used on top of the stove, saute green peppers in oil until they begin to soften. Sprinkle with a little salt. Lift green peppers out of dish and set aside.\n\nBrown the sausage in the same baking dish. When browned, add the red wine.\n\nCover the pan and bake the sausages in wine in a 350F oven for 40 minutes.\n\nUncover and add green peppers back to the dish. Bake for another 30 minutes and serve in the same dish.\n\nI used half hot and half sweet Italian sausages, because I thought the hot would be too much for the kids. I served this with crusty garlic bread and spaghetti with marinara sauce. And salad, which nobody ate because we were all too stuffed from the pasta and sausage.\n\nWow. This was good. I mean really, really good. And I’m not just saying that because I think Frank will send some of his goons to haunt me from the grave. It really was fantastic. My critics agreed:\n\nDon Corleone: It’s ring-a-ding-delicious!\n\nSarah Crewe: I really love the sausage. The peppers are bad.\n\nBatman: The sausage and peppers are really good!\n\nCurious George: I like the sausage. I don’t like the peppers.\n\nElmo ate only pasta. But she didn’t have a nap today, so I think it’s unfair to take her opinion too seriously 😉\n\nIf you’re interested, click here to watch a video on youtube of The Chairman cooking his marinara sauce with Dinah Shore in 1970. It’s fun to watch!\n\nI always loved Phil Hartman’s portrayal of Ol’ Blue Eyes on Saturday Night Live…\n\nEnjoy 🙂"
