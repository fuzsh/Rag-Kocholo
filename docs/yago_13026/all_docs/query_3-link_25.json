In the past you used to write daily, but now have ceased to do so. I am very worried about your unavoidable departure for Petersburg. I am hoping to get your telegram soon telling me about your decision, as the matter is too serious to be ignored. If you have found evidence of the illness and are unable to last until the end of October…then come straight to Petersburg and settle your affairs.\n\nIt is so delightful here. It would be a great pity if Nikolai lags behind since Papa is counting on having him here and is always talking about it. Anyhow, have Nikolai write Papa a letter-a nice letter-he is capable of being nice and amiable when he wants to be. I hope that you are living in peace and harmony, and that all misunderstandings have been forgotten. Agreement between you gives me great comfort. Think about this, both of you, and try not to upset things….\n\nPapa is by the sea, and I have stayed home to write to my Felyunka and to send him a big kiss. Without both of you Koreiz has been boring. A big kiss. Christ be with you."
