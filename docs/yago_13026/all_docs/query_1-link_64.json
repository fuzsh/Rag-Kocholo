        "text": "Born on January 6, 1986, in the small Russian town of Yemanzhelinsk, Irina Shayk, whose full name is Irina Valeryevna Shaykhlislamova, has ascended the heights of international modeling fame. Raised by her mother, a kindergarten music teacher, and her father, a coal miner, Shayk's introduction to fashion and glamour was far from predestined. However, her striking looks, which she owes to her Tatar heritage, soon caught attention. By the age of 20, she had moved to Paris and signed with an agency, marking the start of an illustrious career. Shayk's breakthrough came when she appeared as the face of Intimissimi, an Italian lingerie brand, in 2007. This feat led to her gracing the coveted cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2011, becoming the first Russian model to do so. Her extraordinary beauty and professional dedication have seen her work with renowned fashion houses like Givenchy, Versace, and Marc Jacobs. Also noteworthy is her appearance in music videos, most notably Kanye West's \"Power,\" and her acting debut in the blockbuster movie, Hercules. Despite her glamorous career, Shayk has always remained grounded, attributing it to her small-town upbringing. She is actively involved in philanthropic activities, particularly those relating to children's causes. In addition, she dedicates time to support organizations that aid in the recovery of children affected by Chernobyl radiation. As a mother herself, Shayk's commitment to these causes is deeply personal. From the coal mines of Russia to the glittering runways of Paris and Milan, Irina Shayk's journey is a testament to her determination, beauty, and compassionate heart.\n\nIrina Kulikova (Russian: Ирина Куликова; born 6 August 1991) is a Russian fashion model.
