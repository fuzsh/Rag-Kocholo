        "text": "Elisaveta Feodorovna, Grand Duchess Serge (1864-1918)\n\nElizaveta was the sister of Alexandra Feodorovna. They both were the grand daughters of Queen Victoria. if i'm not mistaken Alix ( Alice, Alexandra) and Ella ( Elizaveta) grew up with their grandma in England.\n\nElla's husband was the uncle of Nikolay II, Sergey Alexandrovich ( the son of the Alexander II, the brother of Alexander III)\n\nSergey Alexandrovich, the general-governor of Moscow was killed by bomb not far from Kremlin. As his father, Sergey Alexandrovich had gone through some attempts.Very often he went in the carriage with the family and killers couldn't through the bomb in children there were dissatisfied people but not animals.\n\nIn the case with the Tsar's family there was the anarchy. plus it was ruler family, the heirs.\n\nElla had no children but she brought up the kids of another brother of Sergey.\n\nThanks AliceV. I do remember reading that a sister of Alix married a Romanov, I didn't remeber her name. What happened to her sister in the revolution? and what was the age difference of both husbands, it seems that the younger sister married the older of the 2, did she marry before Alix? I am fascinated by the Romanovs and by the fact that every Royal family in Europe (almost ) married into them.\n\nauntie,\n\nsorry, Ella was older than Alexandra\n\nElla ( 1864-1818) Alix (1872-1818)\n\nElla married in 1884. Became Orthodox in 1893. Brouhgt up the son and the daughter of Pavel Alexandrovich (the brother of Sergey and Alexander III, which was sent from the country cause he married on divorce women.)\n\nSergey Alexandrovich (1857-1905)\n\nAlix married in 1894. by love. Nikolay and Alix knew& love each other since childhood\n\nThere was almost single Tsar's family , which was happy like common people. Though.....the father of Nikki, Alexander III also was happy in th e marriage with Dagmara-Mariya Feodorovna. ( Paternal name for the foreigh princess chossed by the name of her Ortodox confessor)\n\nThese pictures are of the Grand Duke Sergei (Serge) Alexandrovich, son of Alexander II, Governor of Moscow, taken in 1900.\n\nThe Grand Duke was assassined by a revolutionist in 1905.\n\nThe Grand Duke is in the uniform of General-Adjutant wearing collar of the order of St Andrew, St Vladimir sash, badges of the suites of Alexander II, Alexander III and Nicholas II, Russian and foreign medals and orders.\n\nThe last one, the back is decorated with the Imperial badges of the members of Grand Duke Sergei's family, and the following inscription: \"Photographer of Their Imperial Highnesses Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna , Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nI know these portraits were taken by T. Kon or D. Asikritov.\n\nAlthough three of them are just pictures of pictures.\n\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b164/Layla1971/Serge.jpg\n\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b164/Layla1971/Serge1.jpg\n\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b164/Layla1971/Serge3.jpg\n\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b164/Layla1971/Serge4.jpg\n\nGrand Duke Sergei was asassinated on service to the Kremlin by Socialist-Revolutionary, Ivan Kalyayev on February 18, 1905.\n\nIn 1884, Sergei married Elizabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, (Yelisaveta Fyodorovna) (the daughter of Ludwig IV of Hesse and by Rhine and Princess Alice of the UK, she was the older sister to both Ernst Ludwig of Hesse and by Rhine, and also, Alexandra of Hesse, Empress Consort of Tsar Nicholas II).\n\nI don't know whether he was put in a mine shaft, but he was shot in the asassination.\n\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth became a nun and gave away her jewellery and sold her most luxurious possessions. With the proceeds she opened the Martha and Mary home in Moscow and for many years helped the poor and the orphans in Moscow to foster the prayer and charity of devout women . Here there arose a new vision of a diaconate for women, one that combined intercession and action in the heart of a disordered world. In April 1909 Elizabeth and seventeen women were dedicated as Sisters of Love and Mercy. Their work flourished: soon they opened a hospital and a variety of other philanthropic ventures arose.\n\nIn 1918 the Communist government exiled exiled her to Yekaterinburg and then to Alapaevsk, where she was killed by the local Bolsheviks on July 18, 1918, along with Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich Romanov, the Princes Ioann Konstantinovich, Konstatin Konstantinovich, Igor Konstantinovich and Vladimir Pavlovich Paley, Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez and Varvara Yakovlevna, a sister from the Grand Duchess Elizabeth's convent.\n\nShe was canonised by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2001. Her principal shrine is the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent she founded in Moscow.\n\nLayla1971 said:\n\nGrand Duke Sergei was asassinated on service to the Kremlin by Socialist-Revolutionary, Ivan Kalyayev on February 18, 1905.\n\nI don't know whether he was put in a mine shaft, but he was shot in the asassination.\n\nThe Grand Duke Serge was killed by a bomb thrown into his carriage, just near the Nikolsky Gate in the Kremlin wall.\n\nThose members of the Imperial Family murdered at Alapaievsk, including Ella, were thrown down a mine shaft, some still alive.\n\nAlice. Ella and Alix (as well as their sisters Victoria and Irene and brother Ernie) were raised in England by Queen Victoria. They were brought to England in 1879, not long after their mother died.\n\nElla and Sergei did not have children, so they adopted the children of Sergei's brother Paul: Maria Pavlovna Jr. and Dimitri Pavlovich. Their mother, Princess Alexandra of Greece, died after she gave birth to Dimitri in 1891 and their father, Paul, ran off and married a divorced commoner, Olga Valerianovna Karinovich. Since they married without Nicholas II's permission, Paul and Olga were exiled from Russia. After that, Paul's brother Sergei was appointed gaurdian of his two children, Maria and Dimitri. Paul and Olga had three children together: Natalia, Irina and Vladimir. They were granted the titles of Serenity and Prince(ss) Paley. That's why sometimes Olga Karinovich is seen as \"Olga Paley\".\n\nWilly was always in love with Ella. I believe he even tried to get her out of Russia many times during the revolution.\n\nShe was so much gayer than her sister. Reminds me more of Minnie. At least until they blew Serge up.\n\nAnd what about Marie the younger whom she help raise? Marie has said Ella was cold and unfeeling towards her. I don't think she was.\n\nYou are all correct. What I would like to know, is what did she see in Sergei. Some say he was a homosexual, that I don't know. But he was not noted as being a nice person. Grand Duchess Xenia's husband Sandro, Alexander Mikhilavich, said he could think of no redeeming feature of Sergei. He was disliked by many of his family, least of all the public. Ella was charming, gay, beautiful and, I think, could have made a better marriage. I am just asking opinion, as none of us know what she really thought.\n\nYou are all correct.

Ella was charming, gay, beautiful and, I think, could have made a better marriage. I am just asking opinion, as none of us know what she really thought.\n\nI have always wondered the same. I have also wondered how much truth there was to the information about Sergei and how much was rumors stirred by his family? That would make some intersting research.\n\nLexi\n\nCountess, don't you have the Warwick book? I believe that it has reference to Sergei's homosexuality in there. I am wondering if Ella just wanted to party and Sergei had the means to allow her that. I remember glancing through the Warwick book where he said that she flirted an awful lot and went to a lot of parties.\n\nMarriage of convenience, it would seem to me.\n\nElla: Princess, Saint and Martyr by Christopher Warwick, I haven't read that biography but I do have 'Elizabeth: Grand Duchess of Russia' by Hugo Mager which I found somewhat disappointing.\n\nI believe Ella was indeed enjoying the society of Moscow and St. Petersburg before her husband died and her own sister thought she and her clique were arrogant etc. Not that that was too surprising as Alix basically didn't approve of any relative of course."
