The Scapegoats covers the periods from April 1913 to the outbreak of the First World War, featuring most prominently Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Emperor Franz Josef, Archduke Karl, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nMore information and excerpts from the book can be found here:\n\nShattered Crowns\n\n↧\n\nShattered Crowns: The Scapegoats - now available in paperback\n\nI am happy to say that'Shattered Crowns: The Scapegoats\"is now available in paperback.\n\n↧\n\nMore Details\n\nFOR A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN ROYALTIES - PARTICULARLY QUEEN VICTORIA'S FAMILY - PLEASE VISIT:\n\nQueen Victoria & Other 19th Century Royalties\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nTwo new videos\n\n↧\n\nComing Soon....\n\nThe Sacrifice is the second novel in the Shattered Crowns trilogy, following the royalties of Europe from 1913 to the Treaty of Versailles. The Sacrifice covers the the period from the outbreak of war to the Russian revolution (1914-1917), during which time the Emperors of Austria, Russia and Germany realise that this is not a war for territory or even honour but is rather a means of destroying their autocracies to replace them with secular ideologies and international economic control. As Kaiser Wilhelm, Tsar Nicholas, Emperor Franz Josef, Archduke (later Emperor) Karl and Queen Marie of Roumania face the horrors of war and suffer for their people, they are also confronted by their own personal and family tragedies.\n\nI did not find this book easy to write because the subject matter is so horrific but I trust I have been able to capture these characters as accurately as possible, and have perhaps dispelled some of the myths surrounding their role in the First World War.\n\nThe first book in the trilogy: Shattered Crowns: The Scapegoats is already available on Amazon and in various bookshops\n\nThis book will be available next month and, to celebrate its launch, I have now reduced the price of my earliest novels (The Counting House and The Fields Laid Waste) on Kindle to a minimum!\n\n↧\n\nShattered Crowns: The Sacrifice\n\nNow available on Kindle and paperback...\n\nIn the summer of 1914 the capitals of Europe erupt in a patriotic frenzy as peoples on all sides, roused by the press, rejoice at the outbreak of the 'war to end wars'. The rejoicing soon turns to disillusionment as the full horrors of the bloodiest conflict the world has ever seen become apparent. For the Emperors of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia comes the growing awareness that this war, which they sought desperately to avoid, is not being fought for territory or honour, but rather to destroy the old world order and to replace their autocracies with secular ideologies and international economic control. Amid the intrigue and deception, Kaiser Wilhelm, Tsar Nicholas, Emperor Franz Josef, Archduke Karl, and Queen Marie of Roumania not only face the horrific sacrifice of their people, but are also confronted by their own personal and family tragedies.\n\n'The Sacrifice' is the second novel in the Shattered Crowns trilogy, following the royalties of Europe from 1913 to the Treaty of Versailles. 'The Sacrifice' covers the the period from the outbreak of war to the Russian revolution (1914-1917) and is based on actual events.\n\n↧"
