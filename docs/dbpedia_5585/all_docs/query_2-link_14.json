        "text": "This build­ing com­bines medieval archi­tec­ture with 19th cen­tu­ry archi­tec­ture. It not only con­tains old art­work, but it also fea­tures baths and hydraulic sys­tems that date back to the Roman age. They take care to pre­serve as many of Europe’s ear­ly medieval tapes­tries and build­ings as pos­si­ble. Check out a frag­ment of a canoe that rep­re­sents all the known remains from the Celtic Parisii tribe who were the first to set­tle the mud­dy banks of the Seine and gave Paris her name.\n\nHere you can catch a glimpse of what French life was like in the 18th cen­tu­ry through a 20th cen­tu­ry lens. Between 1900–1927, Ernest Cognac, founder of La Samar­i­taine depart­ment stores (which just reopened after 17 years shut­tered!), and his wife Marie-Louise Jay had amassed a mas­sive eigh­teenth cen­tu­ry art col­lec­tion. Upon Cognac’s death in 1928, he donat­ed his col­lec­tion to the city of Paris, mak­ing it avail­able to the pub­lic. The muse­um has con­tin­ued show­cas­ing this col­lec­tion since 1929. In 1990, the museum’s col­lec­tion was moved to the Hôtel Donon, where it still resides to this day.\n\nThe Musée Car­navalet is also known as Paris’s old­est his­to­ry muse­um and it is ded­i­cat­ed to the his­to­ry of the City of Paris. It opened on Feb­ru­ary 25, 1880, and it show­cas­es over 625,000 works from pre­his­toric times to the present day. As such, like the Musee Cluny, the build­ing has also gone through a lengthy ren­o­va­tion process to make it fit for 21st cen­tu­ry needs. The refur­bish­ments include a café over­look­ing the gar­den, a room that pro­vides an intro­duc­tion to the muse­um itself, and expan­sions to exist­ing areas, leav­ing more room to explore Parisian his­to­ry. Oh, and it’s total­ly free!\n\nThis place ded­i­cat­ed itself to pre­serve the dec­o­ra­tive aspect of his­to­ry. In oth­er words, you can find unique bits of dec­o­ra­tive 18th cen­tu­ry fur­ni­ture all over this muse­um. Moïse de Camon­do com­mis­sioned archi­tect René Ser­gent to build the man­sion to house the col­lec­tion of fur­ni­ture and royalty’s house­hold items. The man­sion itself took a few years to build between 1911 and 1914. It wasn’t open to the pub­lic until 1936.\n\nSince its incep­tion in 1794, the Arts et Métiers Muse­um show­cas­es tech­ni­cal inno­va­tion at its finest. As such, it’s con­sid­ered one of the old­est tech­ni­cal inno­va­tion muse­ums in the world. It has over 2,400 inven­tions (such as watch­es, oven mod­els, a large draw loom, etc.) on dis­play after its 2000 refur­bish­ment. Fun Facts: dur­ing the ear­ly phas­es of exca­va­tion, archae­ol­o­gists dis­cov­ered a series of sar­copha­gi. Also, the audio tours for this muse­um come in eight dif­fer­ent languages.\n\nIf you want to vis­it a place where it’s noth­ing but music 24/7, this place might be right up your alley. On Novem­ber 8, 1793, the instru­men­tal muse­um was open to the pub­lic. The col­lec­tions include instru­ments from peo­ple who had fled the coun­try dur­ing the French Rev­o­lu­tion. In 1995, the col­lec­tions were moved to a new build­ing, la Cité de la Musique. In 2015, the Music muse­um inte­grat­ed itself with Paris’s phil­har­mon­ic orches­tra, mak­ing the instru­ments and oth­er musi­cal col­lec­tions more acces­si­ble to the pub­lic. Part of that acces­si­bil­i­ty to music includes hav­ing live per­for­mances with­in the muse­um itself. Vis­it and find your music!\n\nThis place has a few oth­er names, such as the Lib­er­a­tion Muse­um. As many His­to­ry buffs will tell you, France was not immune from war’s destruc­tion. It’s also ded­i­cat­ed to the two men who helped France nav­i­gate itself through the war; Phillipe de Haute­clocque and Jean Moulin. The lat­ter would not live to see his coun­try lib­er­at­ed, but the for­mer nev­er sur­ren­dered and fought along­side the allied armies to set France free from Nazi occu­pa­tion. Both sto­ries are hon­ored and told along­side France’s 1940 exo­dus. As for the build­ing itself, it was used as a com­mand post for the head of the French forces in late August 1944. About fifty or so years lat­er in 1994, it became a muse­um. In 2017, it under­went a ren­o­va­tion before reopen­ing again in August 2019. While France did fall under Ger­man occu­pa­tion, this muse­um is deter­mined to hon­or the peo­ple who resist­ed and ensure that they nev­er be forgotten.\n\nThis was once a roy­al gar­den ded­i­cat­ed to grow­ing and using plants for med­i­cine, which lat­er became an area known sim­ply as the King’s Gar­den. Then on June 10, 1793, the French Rev­o­lu­tion came along and decid­ed to com­bine the King’s Gar­den with the nat­ur­al his­to­ry cab­i­net, and the rest, as they say, is his­to­ry. Here you can find about 67 mil­lion spec­i­mens to look at, some sci­en­tif­ic research­ing activ­i­ties, and a few more muse­ums and gar­dens nearby.\n\nLand ho, here’s your one-stop for French mar­itime cul­ture with a dash of roy­al opu­lence like only all those Louis’ could. This just-recent­ly reopened muse­um has every­thing: a tro­phy hon­or­ing sail­ing around the world in less than 80 days, paint­ings and mod­els of ships, and two libraries: one ded­i­cat­ed to all you could learn about sail­ing, yacht­ing, and oth­er sea­wor­thy fun and the oth­er pro­vides a resource for anato­my and nat­ur­al sci­ences. The build­ing and décor offer a taste of the sump­tu­ous­ness of the Château de Ver­sailles (with­out the train ride) as this used to be the stor­age build­ing for extra roy­al fur­ni­ture (Lol no won­der the starv­ing mass­es revolt­ed…). A decent view of the Eif­fel Tow­er is the cher­ry on the cake. Locat­ed right in the Place de le Con­corde (where Marie Antoinette and thou­sands of oth­ers lost their heads) this muse­um wasn’t open the last time you were here, so take advan­tage to have some­thing to flex on your friends back home who have been to The Louvre.\n\nAh, l’amour, tou­jours amore, am I right? Well, if you’re expect­ing to find any cupids shoot­ing arrows here, then no, I’m not right. How­ev­er, if you’re expect­ing to find a time cap­sule of the clas­si­cal Roman­tic move­ment, then you’ve come to the right place. Orig­i­nal­ly a house lived in by Dutch artist Ary Schef­fer in the 18th cen­tu­ry, it was sold to the state in 1956 and remains a muse­um. What can we say? We want to keep our title as City with the Most Muse­ums on Earth.\n\nThis is one of the largest col­lec­tions of mil­i­tary his­to­ry you can find in Paris. You can see a great col­lec­tion of uni­forms, weapons, bat­tle armor, draw­ings, and every­day objects such as hel­mets, bugles, note­books, a BBC AXBT mic, and a cryp­to­graph­ic machine. You can also watch some short films and learn every­thing about the French armies from Napoleon to WWII and beyond. Locat­ed in the Invalides com­plex, aka that build­ing with the shiny, real gold dome, it’s worth a vis­it inside and out.\n\nHere, we have one of the old­est ves­tiges of the Palais de la Cité. Once a medieval res­i­dence for roy­al­ty, per­haps it’s more well-known for being used as a prison dur­ing the French Rev­o­lu­tion. Most famous­ly, or rather infa­mous­ly, it’s the last place Marie Antoinette stayed before her date with the guil­lo­tine. Now, I’m not sure if they’ll let you eat cake there in her mem­o­ry, but you could see her memo­r­i­al, which was erect­ed near her cell in 1816.\n\nIt is pret­ty obvi­ous what this muse­um show­cas­es but just in case you’re still in the dark, the entire build­ing is ded­i­cat­ed to works pro­duced dur­ing the 1930s. About 800 sculp­tures, 2,000 paint­ings, dec­o­ra­tive items and even fur­ni­ture are dot­ted around. We all know it is so much bet­ter when some­one focus­es on one thing they are good at. It is safe to say that this place is pret­ty good at show­cas­ing his­tor­i­cal items from the 1930s. It’s also a per­fect place to learn more about French peri­od dur­ing that time [you know, all that inter-war stuff]. So bring your knowl­edge and a notepad, you nev­er know what else you might learn.\n\nLocat­ed in the Palais de la Porte Dorée, this muse­um gives some of the most detailed insights into the his­to­ry of immi­gra­tion over cen­turies. The per­ma­nent exhi­bi­tion show­cas­es 11 key dates from 1685 to the present day, all cen­tered around French immi­gra­tion. They do this by not only look­ing through sci­en­tif­ic data but incor­po­rat­ing real life sto­ries as well [who knows, you might read about your great great grand­par­ents…]. Just like with any­thing French, art is of course still a part of it. In fact, they man­aged to dot around some works from con­tem­po­rary artisits which fit in with the rel­e­vant themes. Check their web­site for their tem­po­rary exhibitions.\n\nThe Phono­mu­se­um is a non-prof­it orga­ni­za­tion look­ing into « the great adven­ture of sounds. » It is the only muse­um in Paris that hous­es such an exten­sive col­lec­tion of these machines. Ever won­dered how our great grand­par­ents jammed to their top hits? Learn about the his­to­ry and devel­op­ment process­es of some of the most authen­tic pieces of sound hard­ware out there. If read­ing about it isn’t your thing they also hold events at the muse­um, includ­ing con­certs which are the per­fect way to demon­strate some of these antique instruments."
