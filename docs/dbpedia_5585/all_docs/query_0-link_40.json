        "text": "7.5K\n\nOur kids love museums, and we often visit natural history museums while we travel, particularly those that participate in the ASTC Travel Passport Program, which provides members of participating museums free reciprocal admission to hundreds of natural history, science and children’s museums. Natural history museums are a great way to extend classroom learning. We asked our fellow family travel bloggers for their favorites and came up with this list of the best natural history museums in the world (asterisked museums are participants in the ASTC Travel Passport Program):\n\nBest Natural History Museums With Kids\n\n#1: American Museum of Natural History With Kids* (New York City, New York)\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History is the largest Natural History museum in the world and is housed in a beautiful building in New York’s Upper West Side, right outside Central Park. It’s crammed full of artifacts from land, sea and space and is super family friendly for visitors with kids. Our favourite section (and I think the favourite for the majority of visitors) is the Hall of Ornithischian Dinosaurs, which contains a huge selection of dinosaur fossils. There is a T-Rex, a stegosaurus, a triceratops and loads more for any dino fans. But it’s not only dinosaurs, the Museum also has a fantastic oceans exhibit – home to the amazing 94 foot long blue whale model, halls featuring birds and reptiles halls (watch out for the 25 foot python!), exhibits about human origins and cultural diversity and a fantastic section about space. All around the museum are interactive touch screens with more information, and don’t all kids love a touch screen?! General admission for adults costs $23 and $13 for children. The Museum opens daily at 10 am, which is the best time to visit to avoid the crowds.\n\nRecommended by Karen from Are We There Yet Kids.\n\n#2: Denver Museum of Nature and Science With Kids* (Denver, Colorado)\n\nRecommended by Lance Hale from Family Well Traveled.\n\n#3: Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa With Kids (Wellington, New Zealand)\n\nMuseum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (commonly referred to as “Te Papa”) is mind-blowing and an unmissable stop on a New Zealand itinerary. Perched on the waterfront in Wellington, this 6 story building is stuffed with awe-inspiring exhibitions on Aotearoa/New Zealand’s history, it’s natural world and cultural treasures. Te Papa Tongarewa (meaning ‘container of treasures”) is literally packed with hands on, interactive exhibits, which our kids, ages 6 and 3 loved. Far from dragging them around the museum, they ran from exhibit to exhibit excited and totally engaged. The five main collections are Arts, History, Taonga Māori, Pacific Cultures, and Natural History. From impressive native species such as the pygmy blue whale skeleton and the world’s largest specimen of the rare colossal squid (weighing 496 kg!) to more light-hearted exhibits such as Peter Jackson replicas of Orcs to more sobering inclusions such as the current Gallipoli exhibition, Te Papa is, in our opinion, one of the greatest museums in the world. FREE ENTRY apart from specific touring exhibitions. Allow a full day!\n\nRecommended by Mags Nixon from The Family Freestylers.\n\n#4: National Museum of Natural History and Science With Kids* (Tokyo, Japan)\n\nThe best museum in Ueno Park for families with kids is the National Museum of Natural History and Science. This is the huge building with a concrete blue whale on one side and a locomotive on the other. That basically sums up what the museum is about – the encounter of people with nature, which in Japanese culture is a continuum rather than a disruption.\n\nThe Museum tells the story of how people came to Japan (via Okinawa), and how the islands looked before they came. That part of the museum is pretty conventional, although English explanations are limited. Audio guides are also available.\n\nThe coolest part of the museum is the “global gallery”, which goes down three levels into the ground, with dinosaurs in the middle. The cartoon movie explanation of evolution one floor below is also very interesting, a bit tongue in cheek, although everyone looks like an American cartoon from the 1950s. We were entertained by the exhibit representing the smart phone as the peak of evolution.\n\nThe upper floors of the global gallery contain exhibits about technology, Japanese technology of course. The upper floors are where kids will get their most lasting memory of their visit in ComPASS, the space for children’s play and communication. It was recently opened after a renovation and is really fun for the kids. It is so popular that visitors have to get a queue ticket at the information desk at the first floor.\n\nEspecially on rainy days, the museum can be crowded. Bring a packed lunch and eat it in the lunch space on the basement floor of the old building (the “honkan”). There are two restaurants, but the wait could be as long as several hours to be seated. Except for the dinosaurs, children do need adult explanation of the exhibits but absolutely love exploring this fact-packed museum.\n\nRecommended by Wisterian from Wisterian Watertree.\n\n#5: Natural History Museum With Kids (London, England)\n\nThere is so much to captivate children at London’s Natural History Museum whether they’re into dinosaurs and furry owls or giant whales and tiny insects. Visitors can feel the earth move in the Earthquake machine, play detective games around the museum and visit colorful butterflies in the Butterfly House. The hands-on Science Centre is a great place for children to examine specimens from around the world, using microscopes and other instruments.\n\nThe most popular gallery is the Dinosaurs, where visitors can get up close to prehistoric specimens, including the skull of a plant-eating Triceratops, an Iguanodon, one of the first species of dinosaur, and of course, the formidable Tyrannosaurus Rex. Hope, a 25 meter long blue whale skeleton, is suspended from the ceiling of the main hall. The Natural History Museum is open daily and admission is free.\n\nRecommended by Nicky of Go Live Young. Find out more from Nicky about London with kids.\n\n#6: Natural History Museum (Vienna, Austria)\n\nVienna’s Natural History Museum was one of the highlights of our trip to Vienna with our kids, aged 3 and 1 years old. We actually pushed this activity as one of the last, since it isn’t specifically geared towards kids, but we are so glad we didn’t miss it! For kids who love animals, this place is a must. We toured the taxidermy exhibit on the top floor of the Museum, where taxidermy of every kind of mammal imaginable was exhibited 3 times and saw every kind of mammals imaginable! The architecture is absolutely breathtaking, and the Museum is enjoyable for adults too. Even our 1-year-old was amazed at all the animals. Families visiting Vienna with kids should not push this museum off – it’s totally kid-friendly and adult friendly too!\n\nRecommended by Emily Jenks from Henry and Andrew’s Guide.\n\n#7: Natural History Museum of Marseille With Kids (Marseille, France)\n\nRecommended by Melissa Delaware of Thrifty Family Travels. Find out more from Melissa about Adelaide with kids.\n\nWe love natural history museums with kids and can’t wait to visit all of these world’s best natural history museums.
