They are held in trust for research, exhibition, education, and public enjoyment now and for future generations.\n\nThe NMNH represents 90% of the Smithsonian Institution’s collections and forms one of the largest, most comprehensive natural history collection in the world. These collections are crucial tools in understanding the diversity of life on Earth, and the geology and chemistry of our planet and its neighbors in the solar system.\n\nOur collections are special resources that allow the museum to make unique contributions to answering significant scientific questions and responding to national mandates, priorities, and concerns. These collections play a vital role in advancing scientific knowledge, addressing societal issues, and increasing the scientific literacy of our nation. The ongoing and intensive scientific consultation of these reference collections also provides critical information links to other collections throughout the world, establishing the NMNH as an important international user facility.\n\nSearch the Collections\n\nThe NMNH is proud to offer access to over 9 million of its specimen records online. Approximately 292,000 represent all of the museum's available extant biological primary type specimen records.
