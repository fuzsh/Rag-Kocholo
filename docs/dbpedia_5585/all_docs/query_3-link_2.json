The museumâ€™s collections tell the history of the planet and are a record of human interaction with the environment and one another.\n\nAs we all work to shape a sustainable world, this record becomes the starting point. It is our guidebook to how the future can look and work.\n\nBecause of the boundless curiosity of our researchers, the breadth and depth of our scientific collections, and our ability to inspire future generations of scientists, we have a vital role to play. Here people can both discover the world and learn to become better stewards of it."
