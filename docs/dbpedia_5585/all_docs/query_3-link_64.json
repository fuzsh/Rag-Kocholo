        "text": "âThis trip, overall, was the greatest life changing experience for me. It was like being so far away from all my troubles and so close to nature, and it gave me a sense of fulfillment. I like to say that it took nine days and 2,800 miles in total to make me feel as though Iâm certain that I want to dedicate my life to biology and the natural sciences.â\n\nâThis camp was a great experience. I especially enjoyed taking a hike to the paleosols in John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. Ever since I was three years old, Iâve wanted to go into the field of paleontology. Going to camp really helped me see how much I love learning about paleontology and geology, and expand my knowledge on these subjects."
