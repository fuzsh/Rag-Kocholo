        "text": "Zoom out. What’s this place all about?\n\nIt’s impossible to miss the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. Set on the National Mall, this 1910 Beaux-Arts building with a soaring rotunda is one of the most visited museums in D.C.—and the world—bringing in 4.2 million visitors in 2019. That’s for good reason: this museum has the world’s largest natural history collection with 146 million artifacts and specimens. The museum awes visitors from the second they walk in thanks to the 13-foot-tall African elephant watching over the rotunda. (His name is Henry.)\n\nWhat will we find in the permanent collection?\n\nYou might think it’d be hard to know where to begin, but that question is actually easy: Start with the dinosaurs. In 2019, the museum reopened its beloved dinosaur and fossil hall after undertaking the most extensive renovation in its history. In the new \"Deep Time\" exhibit, you’ll travel back in time to the Jurassic Era and beyond. T Rex and Triceratops fossils tower over you while you learn about geological events of the past, compare the effects of climate change then and now, and discover how microbes created the world as we know it.But there’s so much to see beyond fossil hall. The National Museum of Natural History is home to the Hope Diamond, early human artifacts, Ancient Egyptian mummies, and a butterfly pavilion. You can also explore ocean life and mammal habitats or learn about the diversity of African cultures. And while the museum takes a wide lens on the natural world, there’s impressive depth to each exhibit—not to mention opportunities to connect what you’re learning to your own experiences.\n\nAnd what kind of temporary exhibits come through?\n\nTemporary exhibitions are just as sensational and educational as the permanent collection, whether you’re learning about narwhals or researching infectious diseases. Throughout the museum, you’ll also get opportunities to experience what you’re learning or watch real scientists in action.\n\nWhat did you make of the crowd?\n\nExpect them. This is a hot spot for families and school trips—nothing animates children like dinosaur bones and giant whale replicas—but the flow moves fairly quickly.\n\nOn the practical tip, how were the facilities?\n\nIt can be a little intimidating to get around this 325,000-square-foot museum. Maps are available for a small fee and it’s worth grabbing one (or checking the online version) to figure out a game plan.\n\nAny guided tours worth trying?\n\nThere aren’t any regular tours, but volunteer interpreters are stationed at exhibitions at various times of the day.\n\nWhats for sale in the gift shop?\n\nThere are several gift shops—including a gem and mineral store and a mammal store located conveniently near the relevant exhibits—full of educational toys, stuffed animals, apparel, jewelry, books, and science kits.\n\nIs the café worth a stop, or should we just plan on going elsewhere?\n\nChoose between two cafés: The Atrium Café offers standards like pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and chicken tenders; the Ocean Terrace Café focuses on salads and grain bowls.\n\nAny advice for the time- or attention-challenged?\n\nYou could spend a full day here and still feel like you need more time. But if you’re in a hurry, start with the Deep Time dinosaur exhibit then head upstairs to scope out the Hope Diamond or the Butterfly Pavilion. You have to buy a ticket to enter the latter, but it’ll be worth it when you’re making friends with one of the hundreds of butterflies."
