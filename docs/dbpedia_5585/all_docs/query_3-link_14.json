        "text": "The National Museum of Natural History is an American museum containing millions of natural specimens. It is part of the Smithsonian Institution and is located in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution began gathering specimens of natural history in 1838 and continued collecting by gift, purchase, or expedition throughout the 19th century. In 1910 the collection was moved to its current location, a 1.5-million-square-foot (139,000-square-meter) building featuring a Roman-style portico entrance and a green domed rotunda. Its public and exhibition space amounts to 325,000 square feet (30,000 square meters). The Beaux-Arts exterior was designed by architects Daniel H. Burnham and Charles McKim. The Washington, D.C., firm Hornblower and Marshall designed the interior to maximize natural light and exhibit space. In 1969 the Smithsonian expanded the museum, adding east and west wings."
