        "text": "I am at the Jardin des Plantes, in the Fifth Arrondissement on the Left Bank of the Seine. Here we find one of the world’s oldest zoos, still officially called a “menagerie,” various greenhouses and rows of brilliant dahlias book-ended by statues of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. We also find the various galleries composing the National Museum of Natural History. These include, not least, the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy, a two-floor exhibition hall built in preparation for the 1900 World Fair, where the skeletons and preserved tissues of thousands of animal species are on display: the massive jaws of sperm whales, cross-sections of elephant molars like great petrified mille-feuilles, countless miniature bat skulls under tiny glass domes.\n\nIt is here, among the many bones, that I have been drawn since my arrival in this city, as if it were the true center of Paris. I sometimes have trouble explaining or even understanding why I moved here, I who care nothing about fashion or fine cuisine or shortened work weeks, who loves wine but is happy as long as it is red. I love art, but I can barely survive 30 minutes in an art museum without my cafeteria-homing instinct kicking in.\n\nWhy do I keep coming back to this bone menagerie? What pull do the skeletons have that the artworks lack? How do they call out when the living beasts across the garden, in spite of their barks and howls, remain silent to me? I return at every opportunity. I offer to give out-of-town visitors a private guided tour, which, after dozens of iterations, is now taking on the quality of a bravura performance.\n\nI also go to the gallery alone, somewhat ashamed to be the only grown-up without any little ones in tow, thus violating the unspoken but undeniable rule: art for the adults, nature for the kids. Around me there are precocious, articulate 7-year-olds lecturing their parents on the difference between mammoths and mastodons, or explaining that birds are, in reality, dinosaurs. They are beaming with pride at their possession of a share of scientific truth. I am not moved by the same love of knowledge. I affirm the authority of science, but I am not here to learn, not exactly. I am here for a certain sort of aesthetic experience, and thus I reject the simple dichotomy between this place and, say, the Louvre across town.\n\nThe gallery, which grew up around the collections of the great French naturalists Buffon, Georges Cuvier, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and others, is the result of a vision of living nature that does not set it sharply apart from art. Twentieth-century artists like Damien Hirst would, with his segmented cows and his immortalized shark, ironize the artifice of the natural-history display. But the treatment of such specimens as objects for aesthetic contemplation is by no means revolutionary. It is borrowed, with a smirk, from an earlier era’s sincere effort to understand nature by recomposing it in a display that captures its beautiful order.\n\nGeorges Pouchet, the 19th-century naturalist who designed the marine mammal display that takes up roughly half of the main exhibition space, claimed that his own intention in placing the diminutive Ganges river dolphin next to the right whale’s massive baleen and across from the narwhal with its mysteriously overgrown tooth masquerading as a tusk, was to organize the cetaceans according to “an aesthetic and systematic logic.” This is my logic too.\n\nThe gallery remains, for the most part, rooted in the 19th century, with fine wooden cabinets, and yellowed labels with names written in elegant calligraphy. There are a few signs of the intrusion of a new mind-set, and I do my best not to notice them. Worst of all are the touch screens with educational quizzes. Children often run right to these screens, as if desperate to latch onto something familiar, doing their best to shut out the reality of the bones. Nature museums have been restyled in recent decades as auxiliaries of the school system, intended for the stimulation of interest in gaining scientific knowledge, which is in turn a precondition of technological progress and increased human domination over the forces of nature. But as recently as the 19th century, when the modern version of the gallery was conceived, those who studied the natural world had not yet forgotten that the ultimate object of their study was beauty, more suitable to relaxed contemplation than to utilitarian learning: beauty as it is revealed through the extravagant, minute and intricate order of nature’s productions.\n\nImmediately upon entering we find a statue of a man, two feet or so high, revealing the muscles and tissues that lie beneath our skin, and, like Adam, donning a fig leaf. He is Jean-Pancrace Chastel’s “Peeled Man,” and his hidden groin, it seems, is the only sign of shame in the entire gallery. From here on, we will see nature unflinchingly, laid bare no matter how strange. To the statue’s left is a glass cabinet with the skulls of various higher primates, including homo sapiens, lined up in different stages of development. Next to the gorilla and the others the human cranium seems freakishly inflated, and its teeth greatly reduced from their former glory. What went wrong? One wonders.\n\nThe overwhelming impression in the main exhibition hall is of a great stampede of animal skeletons. They are all facing in the same direction, hundreds of them, posed as if running. At the vanguard of this formation are various megafauna, each of which would be impressive enough on its own: hippopotamuses, elk, a Steller’s sea cow. As one surveys the great abundance of vertebrate forms, one perceives viscerally and incontrovertibly the unity of this great taxon. The skeletons reveal what living, moving animals could not: that all these different animals are in the end variations on a single theme, built up around a backbone.\n\nMany of the skeletons belonged to animal celebrities. There is the rhinoceros of Versailles, for example, who was assassinated in 1793 by an angry mob of Sans Culottes. There is the Stadhouder giraffe, brought in from the Netherlands in part to disprove the Marquise de Pompadour’s claim that the enormous femur in her possession, from an animal of the same species, had belonged to a human giant. There is Rock Sand, the thoroughbred winner of the 1903 British Triple Crown.\n\nAnd there are the various skeletons of mummified animals brought back by Geoffroy in 1802 from the Napoleonic expedition to Egypt. The naturalist had hoped to use these specimens as corroboration for his version of evolutionism, according to which, over time, species can yield up new morphological variations upon an underlying unity of form. (Geoffroy was a defender of evolution, like many in the century before Darwin. What Darwin would add, principally, was an insight concerning the mechanisms of evolution, most notably that of natural selection.) Unfortunately for the French naturalist, and to the apparent advantage of his anti-evolutionist adversary Cuvier, the Egyptian skeletons — a Dorcas gazelle, a peregrine falcon, an ox — did not seem any different from their modern counterparts, though they were millenniums old. It was of course somewhat naïve to look to the human historical record, rather than to the fossil record, to settle the matter of species change over time. Yet this is the sort of naïveté that in its way gives off unmistakable signs of genius.\n\nCuvier and Geoffroy both recognized a clear parsimony in the structure of the animal kingdom, and above all among the vertebrates. Whatever brought these creatures into being, it had not been necessary to start each time from scratch. Carry out a slight expansion of the spinal column, a reduction of the mandible, or a shortening of the forelimbs, and potentially you could get any species from any other. As early as 1680, the English anatomist Edward Tyson had established that the fin bones of a porpoise are modified hoof bones, yet two decades later, in his anatomical study of a chimpanzee, he refused to draw the conclusion that the incredible similarity of its anatomy to that of a human being might testify to an actual relation of kinship.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, evolution became increasingly fashionable, but the problem of humanity’s place in any evolutionary scheme loomed large. The study of animal nature thus made it possible to think our way into a web of kinship for all living species, before we were quite ready to see ourselves as part of that web. Even the whales had tiny pelvises, unconnected to the rest of the skeleton, with what looked like the traces of hind legs. What were these doing there? One thing was certain: God, or nature, did not tear up its blueprint and begin anew for each species. The quagga, the okapi, the tapir, the various marsupials: All testify to an elegant order, aesthetic and systematic at once.\n\nThis system is further reflected around the walls of the exhibition hall, where more than a hundred glass cabinets feature the skeletons of miniature creatures (indris, pacas, echidnas), as well as countless jars containing the soft parts of animals preserved, for over a century now, in formaldehyde. The vitality of animal tissue cannot be retained for long, and a frog trachea that sits in a jar of pungent liquid for a hundred years, as its label dulls and fades, transforms over time into something entirely unnatural, ashen, dull and ghastly. This is the gallery’s great aesthetic counterpoise to the stark and clean osteology of the great mammals. The bones reveal an elegant order, one that feels timeless, even if we know it has evolved. The tissues remind us that these bones belonged to mortal creatures, which once sprang, leapt and darted about in fields and in trees, with their muscles, organs and joints.\n\nAs one moves clockwise around the back of the hall the displays in the cabinets grow ever more macabre, unspeakable. In the back right corner we find the teratology section, dedicated to the study of what used to be called “monsters” and now are called “birth defects.” There are monstrous fetuses of various humans and animals, classified according to long-forgotten criteria. There is a pig fetus with one eye, called a “simple monster,” and there are two goats joined at the chest, “thoracodelphically.”\n\nGeoffroy had been representative of a broad shift in the history of teratology: from the Renaissance preoccupation with monsters as portents of God’s wrath (the word “monster” after all, suggests that something is being shown, as in de-monstr-ated) to a process of normalization, which was already underway in his early collections of malformed fetuses and which culminated in the massive work published by his son Isidore in 1837, the “Treatise on Teratology.” Birth defects are now seen as opportunities to better understand organic development in general, as exceptions that illuminated the rule. Yet it is hard not to imagine that Geoffroy was just as prone to wonderment at the sight of these animal freaks as any 16th-century village deacon, ever on the lookout for signs of God’s anger, would have been. The exceptions are revolting and wonderful to anyone who sees them, and they force us to marvel that the rule can ever hold at all: that you and I and most everyone we know came out all right.\n\nWe continue to move along the glass cabinets on the outer wall of the gallery and by now even the least squeamish of us begin to feel it is too much: the dried and mounted gorilla jejunum, the alpaca caecum, the jaguarundi lungs in a jar. What a strange world! What excess! And yet, laid out like this, presented in the microcosm of a single gallery, the testimony of the senses leaves no doubt that this strange excess is also a beautiful order, of which the meager holdings in the art museums are at best a pale shadow.\n\nOur reasons for wishing to be where we wish to be are often idiosyncratic, incommunicable. When I try to come up with an explanation for why I wish to be in Paris, the only faint glimmer of an idea that I can find is that I wish to be close to this place: to the Jardin des Plantes, to its menagerie of dik-diks and ostriches, to its greenhouses of prehistoric ferns, and, most of all, to the Gallery of Comparative Anatomy. It is not that I will spend my life in this complex, and it is not that dusty old displays of natural history are entirely unique to this city. It is, rather, that this place embodies a certain intangible spirit that was once much more naturally associated with Paris.\n\nBuffon, Cuvier and the others were not displaying mere curiosities, as the Marquise de Pompadour did with her giant’s femur; nor were they seeking to one-up nature, like Hirst with his shark, by the conceit that their art is more worthy of attention than the creatures that are their art’s subject. The spirit that brought the gallery into existence is one that presupposes the unity of art and nature. It does not shy away from seeing nature itself as an aesthetic object.\n\nIn this spirit, it is among the foremost roles, and greatest distinctions, of a capital city that it be a center of natural knowledge, that it be a point of access to nature as a whole: a portal, through the very densest concentration of human culture, to the order of nature that lies beyond it. The skeletons are like the most vivid embodiments of this order. It would be a great mistake to think of them as dead."
