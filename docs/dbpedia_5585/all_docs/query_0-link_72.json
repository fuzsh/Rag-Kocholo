For those quick to dismiss the museum experience as boring, it's time to think again. Galleries worldwide, from Senegal to Japan, have perfected the craft of designing compelling exhibits on art, history, and culture that can change any naysayer's mind.\n\nWhile the subject matter may vary from location to location, the best museums in the world make visitors think differently about society. An added bonus: Many of these museums are also known for their incredible restaurants and lush landscapes, making a day at the museum a fulfilling experience.\n\nCheck out this comprehensive list of 49 of the best museums and galleries throughout the world with one-of-a-kind displays that educate and inspire. Whether you're interested in discovering the gems of Paris or learning about the Post-Impressionist works of Van Gogh, these incredible collections are well worth the trip. Here, the best museums in the world to add to your travel bucket list.\n\nJust a stone's throw from Jardin Majorelle, the Yves Saint Laurent Museum houses an exquisite collection of haute couture garments, accessories, and sketches from the esteemed fashion designer. This museum stands as a tribute to Saint Laurent's enduring legacy and his love for Marrakesh—a city that inspired many of the creations that graced the runway.\n\nOn the first floor, the library and study room feature a significant collection of 5,000 volumes on botany, fashion, and Moroccan culture— much of the collection was owned by Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé."
