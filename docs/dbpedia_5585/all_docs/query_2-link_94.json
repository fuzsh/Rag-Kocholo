        "text": "Tuesday, 9 June 2020\n\nHistory Matters! The Value of the Humanities in Natural History Museums\n\nHeumann I², Wolenitz D¹, Hermannstdter A²\n\n¹ICOM NATHIST, Ramat-gan, Israel, 2Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany\n\nTuesday, 9 June – 14:30-16:30 UTC\n\nNatural history museums are hybrid and multi-layered institutions. Using a wide range of specimens, they investigate natural history and life on Earth and shape our perception and understanding of nature. In addition, natural history museums are embedded in changing political systems and social transformations and thus articulate and transport cultural values. Given this cultural, historical, and political dimension, natural history museums constitute an exciting research field for the humanities.\n\nRecently, some natural history museums have established humanities departments while others undertake or facilitate individual research projects with a focus on cultural, historical and social issues and contexts. This session aims to present some of these approaches and projects in order to discuss the potentials and values of integrating the humanities within a science institution.\n\nNatural History Collections in Latin America: A Central Piece in the Puzzle of the Discovery and Conservation of Global Biodiversity.\n\nDiaz A¹\n\n1Instituto de Investigacion de Recursos Biologicos Alexander von Humboldt, Villa De Leyva, Colombia\n\nTuesday, 9 June – 21:00-1:30 UTC\n\nCuriosity of humankind and its natural tendency to collect, treasure, and describe the unknown, are powerful reasons that explain why nowadays our world has one of the most important resources for the documentation of biodiversity: natural history collections. They constitute the physical repository of the natural world and are invaluable treasures thanks to which we are able to discover new species, reconstruct their evolutionary history and patterns of distribution, track changes in species composition and morphology over time, prioritize areas and taxonomic groups for conservation, and lead education programs, just to name a few of their uses. In other words, biological collections are crucial for the discovery and understanding of the natural world. Latin America is a vast area that runs from Mexico to Argentina and includes six of the ten most biodiverse countries in the world (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Perú, Ecuador, and Venezuela) and six biogeographic regions identified as Biodiversity Hotspots because of accelerated habitat destruction: Mesoamérica, Atlantic Forest (Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina), Cerrado (Brazil), Valdivian temperate rain forests (Chile, Argentina), Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena (Panamá, Colombia, Ecuador, Perú), and Tropical Andes (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Perú, Bolivia). This means that in Latin America, species are being discovered at a higher rate than in other regions of the world, and at the same time it requires urgent efforts of conservation to prevent extinction in such biodiverse parts of the planet. Natural history collections in the region are key in the achievement of this goal and persist in their mission, some of them even facing isolation, political, and economic challenges. With this symposium we will provide an overview\n\nof the current state of natural history collections in Latin America, their contributions to the knowledge of biodiversity and world change, challenges, and opportunities to connect and collaborate with collections and researchers around the world.\n\nWednesday, 10 June 2020\n\nEnvisioning Collections Management for the Evolving Biodiversity Data Lifecycle\n\nPaul D², McCuller M¹, Hogue G¹, Krimmel E², Livermore L³, James S4 , Marshall C5\n\n¹iDigBio, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, United States, 2North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, 3Natural History Museum, London, England, 4Western Australian Herbarium, Perth, Australia, 5Oregon State University, Oregon, United States\n\nWednesday, 10 June – 21:00-23:00 UTC\n\nThe role of collections management in the biodiversity data lifecycle has been dramatically affected by worldwide specimen digitization programs. Institutions looking to support a visionary future for collections-based biodiversity data need to cultivate a culture of lifelong learning as the expectations of\n\ncollections management evolve. This symposium will highlight key challenges and opportunities involved in designing and driving such a vision that can address impending global challenges.\n\nReviewing actual and potential uses for data generated by digitization programs reveals a rich resource, with significant promise to address critical needs for humans and the planet. Furthermore, groups like the Biodiversity Collections Network envision an “extended specimen network” that would go beyond basic specimen digitization and include complexities parallel to those in the physical world, e.g., trait data, linked data, expanded metadata, etc. Identifying the skills, tools, and personnel roles that could realize such a network and take advantage of its potential highlights challenges on all organizational levels and includes diverse stakeholders. From researchers desiring richer datasets, to collections staff looking for streamlined workflows, to curators interested in sharing knowledge generated from specimen-based research, to museum directors highlighting data assets, the list of stakeholders expands along with our vision for the future potential of biodiversity data.\n\nStakeholder communities have put considerable effort into capacity-building aligned with producing and managing biodiversity data throughout its lifecycle. That said, skills development is a constant need, and the tools that would complement these skills in an extended specimen network require significant enhancement. Concurrently, the personnel roles typically associated with different aspects of the biodiversity data lifecycle (e.g., collection, digitization, mobilization, management, publication) are constantly being refined. As this happens, the people responsible for these roles, and the institutions that house them, may need to re-evaluate capacity, infrastructure, and behavior at an organizational level.\n\nThursday, 11 June 2020\n\nManaging and Mobilizing Collection Data with Specify Software\n\nBeach J¹\n\n¹Specify Collections Consortium, Lawrence, Kansas, United States\n\nThursday, 11 June – 12:00-14:00 UTC\n\nSpecify (www.specifysoftware.org) is an open source collections management platform developed and supported by the Specify Collections Consortium (SCC). The Consortium, comprising 80 collection institutions in 13 countries, represents a cooperative long-term, international investment in governing, innovating, and sustaining open-source cyberinfrastructure for natural history museums. Member institutions have authority and influence in the Consortium with representation in SCC’s Board of Directors and Advisory Committees for Science and Technology, and have direct access to technical support services. Together, the SCC is building on the strength of 20 years of biological collections software engineering to expand the impact of our members’ digital footprint in increasingly integrative global research data systems.\n\nIn this symposium, SCC institutions will describe their collections data initiatives and how they are supported with Specify software. Presentations will show how the Specify 6 desktop application and Specify 7 web platform can be used independently or concurrently to accomplish data management and publishing goals. Among the capabilities to be highlighted are Specify’s ability to customize user interfaces, labels, fields, vocabularies, permissions, and the software data model according to individual collection workflows. Specify’s ability to import data from external files enables inspection and validation before inserting data into the database, and exporting data in Darwin Core (DwC) Archive files through the IPT (Integrated Publishing Toolkit) or directly to aggregators offers the flexibility for participation in broader computing efforts. Specify users will also show how web portal interfaces expose data for public use in various contexts and how web linkages can maintain the network connection between specimen records and associated images, tissues, or DNA samples deposited with external aggregators. Recent revisions in the data model offer new integrative capabilities, and software enhancements promote data collaboration and engagement with user and stakeholder communities.\n\nFriday, 12 June 2020\n\nMIDS and MICS: Minimum Information Out of Digitisation\n\nHaston E¹, Hardisty A², Addink W4, Groom Q5, Petersen M3\n\n¹Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 2Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom, 3Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 4Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, Netherlands, 5Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium\n\nFriday, 12 June – 12:00-14:00 UTC\n\nInformation on the state of digitisation within an institute is essential for efficient curation and budget management of a collection. It also helps decision-makers at all levels to evaluate a collection’s importance. Yet there are no community-wide guidelines for which data should be gathered and in what format. The Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen (MIDS) and the Minimum Information about a Digital Collection (MICS) specifications define the expected and optional information elements that are recommended to be present when publishing digitised information about specimens and collections respectively at various levels of digitisation. This symposium will present work accomplished so far and\n\nexplore how adopting minimum information standards can help to improve the quality of published collections data.\n\nSpecimen Spotlight\n\nCoorough Burke P², Mayer P¹\n\n¹The Field Museum, Chicago, Illinois, United States, 2Milwaukee Public Museum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – 21:00-22:15 UTC\n\nThis symposium consists of short, lightning-round type talks on one special specimen found in a collection. Something that has an amazing story to tell. Presenters will share why that specimen is a favorite or is critical to science or education. Why does it matter? Why is it important? What makes it important? What work has been done on it?\n\nStorage Techniques for Art, Science and History Collections (STASH): Storage Tips STASH Flash Symposium\n\nAbraczinskas L¹\n\n¹Michigan State University Museum, East Lansing, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – 22:30-23:00 UTC\n\nRecent reports from the International Council of Museums Committee (ICOM), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.K. Museums Association, and the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) document the benefits and impacts that museums and\n\ncollection-holding institutions provide worldwide. In order for users to fully benefit from collections, museums must be able to adequately access materials in storage. Recent reports also indicate that overcrowding and poor storage environments are a global challenge.\n\nThe SPNHC Storage Tips symposium is designed to highlight creative approaches to storing natural history collections, thereby facilitating their use for research and programming. The symposium will utilize a lightning round or “tips” format to highlight a broad range of short (5-10 minute) presentations on the following themes:\n\nStorage mounts or support systems that demonstrate ingenuity and utility. These can be scenarios related to disaster preparedness, impacts of changing regulations, moving collections, new solutions to old problems, public access to collections, sustainability, use of new materials, or collections digitization.\n\nMulti-function supports serving more than one purpose, such as storage, examination, travel, and/or exhibition purposes.\n\nCreative storage solutions for collections large and small. Solutions are shared for all natural history disciplines:\n\nZoological specimens (all types of preparation)\n\nBotanical specimens (all types of preparation)\n\nGeological specimens\n\nVertebrate and Invertebrate Paleontological specimens (including microfossils and nannofossils)\n\nPaleobotany specimens (including appropriate microfossils, nannofossils, cyanobacteria, and fossil palynology materials)\n\nEthnography and archaeology\n\nThe presentations will be formatted for inclusion on the Storage Techniques for Art, Science and History Collections (STASHc) website www.STASHc.com. The STASH website includes the original content of the SPNHC publication “Storage of Natural History Collections: Ideas and Practical Solutions” and the interdisciplinary editorial board is composed of representatives from a range of allied organizations, including SPNHC.\n\nThe Anthropocene at the Museum of Natural History\n\nKramar N¹\n\n¹Musée De La Nature Du Valais, Sion, Switzerland\n\nFriday, 12 June – 14:30-16:30 UTC\n\nThe idea of integrating the increasing/growing influence of human activities on the environment in Earth’s history dates back to the 19th century. Yet it was not until the dawn of the 20th century that a real development of this idea became visible in academia through the notion of the Anthropocene. Museums of science and technology, art, history, or anthropology, have produced exhibitions about this topic since 2013. Natural science museums started to address this issue in 2016. Beyond the geological debate, the Anthropocene offers the opportunity to take a step back on any particular environmental problem, as it sheds light on planetary conditions in a comprehensive way. Thus, this session aims, through examples of research or exhibition projects, to discuss the interest for our institutions and our visitors in using this concept.\n\nORAL PRESENTATIONS\n\nSTASHc.com: A Collaborative Online Resource\n\nAbraczinskas L¹, Goldberg L², Perkins Arenstein R³\n\n¹Michigan State University Museum, East Lansing, Michigan, United States, 2Goldberg Preservation Services, LLC, Corning, New York, United States, 3A.M. Art Conservation, LLC, Scarsdale, New York, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Storage Techniques for Art, Science, and History Collections (STASH)\n\nThe STASHc.com (Storage Techniques for Art, Science and History collections) online resource was created to share well-designed storage solutions and has grown annually to include innovative and creative solutions from a wide range of allied collections care professionals. The resource catalogs storage support solutions for art, history, and natural science collections and gives museum professionals from institutions of all types and sizes access to a bank of ideas designed to provide better collections care. The site can be used to find solutions to emergent and recurrent storage problems, prompt the development of new ideas, or build upon what others have accomplished to solve storage conundrums. Unlike some other aspects of preventive care, there are few right or wrong answers in creating storage supports, and a successful solution is the result of numerous choices regarding materials, techniques, skills, and time. The site crowd-sources community driven solutions and creates a platform for connections and commentary between collecting institutions, individuals involved in collections care, and preservation vendors. Entries are vetted by an interdisciplinary editorial committee composed of representatives from a range of allied organizations, including the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC). STASHc.com was launched in 2014 by the Foundation for Advancement in Conservation (FAIC) in collaboration with SPNHC as a way to digitally gather, organize and solicit new storage ideas. The project was generously funded by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation and is based on the understanding that the best ideas for safe and sustainable storage and support come from collaborative solutions. STASHc.com includes the original content of the foundational SPNHC volume “Storage of Natural History Collections: Ideas and Practical Solutions” (edited by Carolyn L. Rose and Amparo R. De Torres). The FAIC initiated STASHc.com as part of a cluster of collections care initiatives targeted at addressing concerns shared by collecting institutions. This presentation provides an overview of the STASHc.com website’s structure and features. The editorial committee is eager to increase the number of published articles and to encourage site activity through assistance from the preservation community worldwide.\n\nThe European Loans and Visits System, ELViS\n\nAddink W¹, Islam S¹, van Dongen W2\n\n¹Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, Netherlands, 2Picturae BV, Heerhugowaard, Netherlands\n\nFriday, 12 June – General (Miscellany) Session 4\n\nDuring 2020-2021 the European Loans and Visits System (ELViS) will be developed within the SYNTHESYS+ project (Smith et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.5.e46404). The system is developed as a service towards smoother, faster and better access to natural history collections across Europe. ELViS will facilitate the placement, assessment, prioritisation and monitoring of requests for visits, loans and digitisation.\n\nInitially it will support access to the facilities participating in SYNTHESYS+. After the project ELViS will be handed over to the DiSSCo (Distributed System for Scientific Collections) consortium to become the first operational core service of the DiSSCo Research Infrastructure. It will then be scaled up to provide access to all European collections in Europe participating in DiSSCo.\n\nWe will demonstrate the initial developments to support the first Virtual Access call (ELViS Minimum Viable Product), reflect on the results of the first usage of the system for the call and we will present the design for the further development towards a fully operational ELViS version 1 at the end of 2020.\n\nMICS-ing Collection and Specimen Descriptions in the European Collections Index to Provide Better Access to Collections\n\nAddink W¹, Islam S¹\n\n¹Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, Netherlands\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: MIDS and MICS: Minimum Information Out of Digitisation\n\nAs one of the core services in DiSSCo, the new pan-European Distributed Infrastructure of Scientific Collections, a European Collection Index (ECOI) will be provided as a catalogue to the DiSSCo natural scientific collections. This service will make use of Minimum Information on Digital Collections (MICS) to describe collections and will combine that with Minimum Information on Digital Specimen for collection items that have been digitized already to the specimen level. Both can make use of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) Collections Descriptions (CD) standard under development (https://github.com/tdwg/cd) to describe collections.\n\nThe European Loans and Visits System (ELViS) is a service developed within the SYNTHESYS+ project (Smith et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.5.e46404) to improve access to natural history collections across Europe. It will make use of ECOI to enable discovery of collections for loans, visits and digitization on demand, at the most granular level possible. It will make use of collection level descriptions for\n\nnon-digitized collection items and will combine that with specimen level descriptions for items in the same collection that have been digitized.\n\nIn the presentation we explain the initial design of ECOI and how the service is going to be used in ELViS. A first version of ELViS is planned to be operational at the end of 2020, which means that a pilot version of ECOI will also be in place at that time, as a micro service within the ELViS services.\n\nLooking Ahead: Perspectives for the Future of Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi Collections\n\nAkama A¹\n\n¹Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, Belém, Pa, Brazil\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: Natural History Collections in Latin America\n\nThe Goeldi Museum is the oldest Brazilian research institute in the Amazon and holds a large collection of animals and plants. The Museum is listed as being within the top 5 largest Brazilian collections for mammals, birds, plants, insects and spiders, and herpetofauna. Moreover, the collections are rapidly growing; for example, the fish collection had 4,000 lots in 2014 and now has more than 40,000 lots to date. The rapid growth rate and the harsh Amazon climatic conditions pose a difficult task on storage and maintaining millions of specimens. Therefore, to face the future, the museum is under modernization including new buildings, collections moving to compact shelving, and installation of an inert gas fire suppression system.\n\nImprovements also include a new data center and a project for improved scientific communication, which is based on virtual environments, to disclose scientific reports, and share images and 3D models for the general public.\n\nWith the recent advances in DNA studies, all collections are moving towards preserving tissue samples that are kept in 96% alcohol at -18 °C. The Goeldi Museum has a large collection of tissues (about 100,000) from\n\nall taxonomic groups. The Museum will operate a cryogenic facility able to hold more than 110,000 samples starting in 2020, becoming the first Brazilian biological depository dedicated to cryogenic preservation of the Amazon Biodiversity.\n\nDespite all these favorable improvements, which enable the Museum to face the 21st century challenges, the institution is now facing an impending threat. Our lack of personnel is a major obstacle to the curatorial needs for all collections. As many of the technicians and curators are retiring in the next five years, a serious problem for management of the collections is soon to start.\n\nHUA: A Very Active Herbarium in Colombia, Working on the Knowledge of Biota and its Conservation in One of the Most Diverse Regions of the Planet\n\nAlzate F¹, Cardona F¹, David H¹, Murillo J¹\n\n¹Institute of Biology. University of Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: Natural History Collections in Latin America\n\nThe HUA Herbarium, founded in 1969 at the University of Antioquia, located in the city of Medellin, northwest of Colombia, currently has about 230,000 specimens, mainly from groups such as Angiosperms with 160,000, Ferns 20,000, Mosses 15,000 and Fungi with 13,000. The collection includes 1,745 type collections, 88.5% of these being from plants occurring in Colombia and 59% (1,027) from the department of Antioquia. Parallel to this collection, the herbarium has a growing tissue bank with about 2,000 specimens, which have been used in the definition of phylogenetic relationships, evaluation of regional biogeographic hypotheses, character evolution and barcoding. The scientific activity of the herbarium has promoted the exploration of unknown geographical areas which, due to the armed conflict that Colombia has experienced, had not been explored. This biological collection has a high research activity focused on specimens and the generation of new results combining classical taxonomy and current phylogenetic methods, a process in which a considerable number of students and professionals participate. Purposes and tasks of the herbarium include the determination of conservation states for the species occurring in the department, the exploration of strategic ecosystems such as the paramos and the dry forest, the conduct of systematic studies that include evolutionary hypotheses and taxonomic developments, exploration of the potential of biological collections in ecology and conservation studies, and community work to promote the conservation of regional flora and ecosystems. Transcending the basic activities of a biological collection, this herbarium has also participated in developing environmental policies, and in joint work with other institutions and botanists both nationally and internationally. The challenges of recent years have allowed research on floristic diversity to be financed from productive capital funding campaigns and the results are mutually beneficial for the generation of knowledge and the conservation of resources that historically have been little valued in one of the megadiverse nations of the planet.\n\nThe Poppy that Means I’m Home\n\nBarteau P¹\n\n¹New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: Natural History Collections in Latin America\n\nWhat does it mean to belong somewhere? For me, nothing evokes the feeling of belonging more than the sight of an Argemone poppy. My favorite specimen in our herbarium is Herb 2881, which is an Argemone poppy from Catron County, like me, and like me, it has a complicated relationship with home. They are a native plant where I grew up, and the altitude at which they grow makes the transition into their range\n\ndistinct. They are, however, an aggressively invasive plant in many parts of the world, yet one species is so private that it is only known to live in a single canyon where its gene pool has become so minute that it will soon disappear. As hyperaccumulators, they possess the potential to treat contaminated soil, but due to this property are highly toxic and have caused many cases of human and animal poisoning. Partial to disturbed soil, they create a brilliant visual record of overgrazing and overexpansion. The multifaceted existence of this genus of flower elegantly illustrates the complexity of what it can mean to belong in the Anthropocene.\n\nA History of Successful and Productive Collaboration Between Avocational and Professional Paleontologists\n\nBauer J¹, Topor M²\n\n¹University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, 2Friends of the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nWednesday, 10 June – General (Potpourri) Session 1\n\nThe University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology (UMMP) as it currently stands was established in 1926. This departmental unit is a research museum with curatorial faculty and collections staff that provide insight for exhibits, secure funding for the collection, and provide curatorial expertise. The Friends of the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology, referred to as the Friends, was founded in 1971 by R.V. Kesling, R.B. Chilman, and J.D. Wright as a local group to engage the community with fossil collecting and paleontological knowledge. Since its origin, the Friends have been closely connected to the UMMP with faculty and staff being greatly involved. The Friends have donated countless specimens, purchased or financially supported specimens, been co-authors on 20+ papers, been acknowledged 15+ times in publications, have supported 5+ graduate student theses, have 25+ taxa named after them, and have been recognized for national awards.\n\nFurthermore, the Friends donated specimens to the UMMP to help the grand re-opening of our public facing Natural History Museum. These are exquisite specimens that they have chosen to share with not only the Ann Arbor community but with everyone who visits the University of Michigan. Over the past 25 years, they have contributed funds to preserve and procure fossils for display. In the recently established exhibit space, the Friends were granted a special display case that will rotate out with their own specimens that they are allowed to select and curate. This partnership has persisted for 49 years and has been a rewarding and productive relationship for both the Friends and the faculty and staff at the UMMP. The total impact is immeasurable. I hope others can learn from us to make science and collections more accessible.\n\nThe Chiapas Digitization Project 1 Year On\n\nBenson L¹\n\n¹Independent/The Chiapas Maya Project, Bath, Maine, United States\n\nThursday, 11 June – General (Polyphyly) Session 2\n\nThe original idea of The Chiapas Digitization Project was to create an all-encompassing virtual archive of objects, images, recordings, and written records to document a rapidly changing culture. Existing material of culture collections had not been sufficiently documented or were readily accessible. The scope of the project was initially deemed impractical and should be scaled back. After rethinking the project, a new plan was presented to the first partners, Museo Na Bolom, and the weaving cooperative, Sna Jolobil, with formal memorandum of understanding documents. Due to prior miscommunication, we feel these agreements were critical to moving forward. The Project Lead in the US is investigating Mukurtu (https://mukurtu.org/) as the database for collections in Mexico not currently digitized or imaged. It is affordable, open-source,\n\nscalable, and websites can provide access to specific communities. The last criterion is essential to one of our collection partners, concerned with access and intellectual property rights. Once chosen, necessary fields will be mapped to the existing Mukurtu data fields, a test collection entered, standards developed, and the resulting data entry procedure guide translated into Spanish. A lexicon will be developed by project collaborators using standardized fields and conventional terminology for partner collection use. A project website, www.chiapasmayaproject.org, is in development. Initially, it will contain the test collection, blog posts by collaborators, project prospectus, lexicon, and a digital exhibit.\n\nCDP continues to face problems with the lack of infrastructure and equipment, technical support, and funding. Collaborators are exploring the steps needed to apply for nonprofit status in both the US and Mexico, a necessary step for grant funding. In the meantime, we are looking for a financial sponsor. The Science Museum of Minnesota, our US partner, recently applied for a grant to digitize their collection as their part of this project. Once funding is found for needed infrastructure and staffing, we will continue digitizing collections and move to Phase II. Phase II of the project includes internships and training in documentation, curation, and conservation for indigenous and local students. We hope to establish connections with collections and conservation communities in the Americas and worldwide.\n\nA Multifaceted Museological Commitment to the Anthropocene Busillis\n\nBernardi M¹, Caliari S¹, Caola A¹, Giovannini A¹, Maiolini C¹, Tombolato D¹, Lanzinger M¹\n\n¹Muse – Science Museum, Trento, Italy\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Anthropocene in the Natural History Museum\n\nThis presentation provides an overview of the projects and activities promoted by MUSE Science Museum, Trento (Italy) in recent years on the overarching topic of the Anthropocene. The theme is the pivotal foundation of the museum strategy: all the departments are committed to support it – exhibition & events development, naturalistic research, communication, corporate membership & fundraising – to highlight the questions, incongruences, and emergencies but also to underline the revolutionary power of the current, unique time we are living in.\n\nA number of examples will help to provide an understanding of the wide range of activities made by the museum team, including staff training, traditional natural science exhibitions about the extinction of biodiversity, political lobbying activity to support SDGs, creation of events and exhibitions intertwining philosophy and science of the Anthropocene. The ultimate goal for the museum is to play the activist role society calls for.\n\nWhat About the African collections at the Meise Botanic Garden Herbarium (BR)?\n\nBogaerts A¹, De Smedt S¹, Huybrechts P¹, Trekels M¹, Dillen M¹, Engledow H¹\n\n¹Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium\n\nWednesday, 10 June – General (Potpourri) Session 1\n\nThe central African herbarium collection of Meise Botanic Garden is the most important in the world: 85% of all specimens ever collected in central Africa are kept at BR. In 2018 the Herbarium of Meise Botanic Garden finished the digitisation of the whole African vascular plant collection. A total of 940,000 herbarium sheets were digitised under the mass digitisation project DOE! which was funded by the Flemish Government. The preparation of the collection was done in-house by all technicians and volunteers over 1.5 years. The images were captured by Picturae and the data was transcribed partly by our own staff and partly by a subcontractor of Picturae, Alembo. The transcribed data consisted of species name, collection date, locality, collector, collector number, altitude and geographical coordinates. All images and data were made available on our new virtual herbarium www.botanicalcollections.be and on GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). The data compiled through the transcription of the labels was used for data analysis and revealed that our collection houses a wealth of important data.\n\n‘Animals Brought from Every Part of the Globe’: A Study of the Imperialist Aspect of the First Generation of Zoological Societies in the Nineteenth Century\n\nBroekhuis W¹\n\n¹Artis Royal Zoo Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: History matters! The Value of the Humanities in Natural History Museums\n\nThis thesis is an inquiry into the imperialist and nationalist aspect of nineteenth-century zoological societies. The aim is to get a full view on how these institutions were connected to the colonies and whether embodying an imperialist ideology was an aspect of the early zoological societies. Subjects of research are the Zoological Society of London (1826), Amsterdam’s Natura Artis Magistra (1838) and The Antwerp Royal Society for Zoology (1843).\n\nThis inquiry starts with the founding of each Society. Their mission statements aimed to contribute to the establishment of collective pride, related to national commercial and political successes and royal patronage. The view on nature was utilitarian. Next, the ways in which these societies gained their collections (and whether a colonial network existed) are explored. In general, the animals were donated by members or benefactors: members of royal houses, foreign politicians or nobility and colonial officials who were members of the societies. The majority of animals in each garden came from the colonies of the respective country. The act of giving helped construct a sense of collectivity. Together with the status of the animals as a colonial commodity, this strengthened the ideological element of these institutions.\n\nThe way the collections were presented and experienced in the gardens of the societies is next addressed. Attention is paid to architecture, the animals, cases in which exotic humans were showcased, and the public. Zoo buildings often had strong exotic influences. The animals were seen and presented as representatives of their colonized homelands. The presence of indigenous keepers helped add an exotic dimension. Experiencing all this colonial splendour in the city, provided self-affirming pride to the visitors.\n\nThe conclusion is that there was definitely an imperialist element to these institutions, at least because of the way animals were brought to the zoo either as diplomatic gifts or gifts from colonial officials. Zoos were not purely a ‘tool of the empire’, but this aspect of their history is not to be ignored either. Could further study on the significance of this colonial past be incorporated in the educational mission and conceptual vision of modern day zoos?\n\nThe Story of Jack: Life and Legacy of the First Elephant of Natura Artis Magistra\n\nBroekhuis W¹\n\n¹Artis Royal Zoo Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: History matters! The Value of the Humanities in Natural History Museums\n\nIn 1839, the Amsterdam Zoological Society Natura Artis Magistra, founded only a year earlier, acquired her first elephant. The bull Jack was originally brought to Europe from Ceylon and ended up in Amsterdam as part of the travelling animal collection of Cornelis van Aken. Once bought by the Society, the elephant became one of its main showpieces. From 1847 onwards, however, Jack proved to be increasingly unmanageable. He was eventually shot in 1849. His skeleton was thereafter displayed in the museum of the Society (Groote Museum), amidst other skeletons and stuffed animals.\n\nWith this paper an attempt was made to uncover and describe as much of Jack’s life as possible, by examining municipal archives, the archives of Artis, the inventory of van Aken’s travelling menagerie, nineteenth-century newspaper articles, as well as old photographs and artworks. Writing a biography about a non-human being may be unconventional, but works well within the contemporary tendency of the Humanities to take an interest in the natural world.\n\nThis episode in the history of Artis not only appeals to the imagination. It can tell us a great deal about the spirit of the times with regard to the relationships between man and nature, the West and the colonies and the development and shifting role of zoological parks since their inception up to this present day. Jack’s skeleton and story is of both natural- and cultural-historical importance and relates a valuable tale about our changing way of looking at and interacting with nature. What can be done with the information gathered about Jack nowadays and how can it contribute to the story that Artis as a modern zoo wants to tell in this current day and age?\n\nCretaceous World TCN: Digitizing the Western Interior Seaway Collections at the Yale Peabody Museum Final Report\n\nButts S¹, Sorojsrisom E¹, Norris C¹\n\n¹Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – General (Miscellany) Session 4\n\nAs a participant in the Cretaceous World TCN (Thematic Collections Network – US NSF Award\n\n#DBI-1601884), the Yale Peabody Museum (YPM) digitized invertebrate, vertebrate, and microfossil collections from the Western Interior Seaway, including iconic fossils like Archelon, Hesperornis, Xiphactinus and the Karl O. Waage invertebrate collection. The Western Interior Seaway (WIS) was a shallow sea that covered the western United States in the Late Cretaceous during a greenhouse climate. The goal of the project is to completely digitize our collection and make it available for researchers via iDigBio and GBIF. These data will allow scientists to answer fundamental questions about this changing ecosystem, which are relevant to the modern challenges of our changing climate.\n\nOver three and a half years, we have digitized over 107,000 lots (over 161,000 specimens). Most are georeferenced with multiple images of each specimen. To achieve this, we developed high throughput digitization protocols using Inselect (Natural History Museum, London). Inselect, available on GitHub, was developed for digitization of pinned insects. We have modified the protocols to digitize concretions, microfossil slides, and specimen lots. This project builds on the successes of the iDigPaleo data aggregator, funded by the Fossil Insect Collaborative (FIC) TCN (idigpaleo.org). The data model and front-end of iDigPaleo was skinned as the Cretaceous World site, which hosts the aggregated educational portal Cretaceous World (cretaceousworld.org). Both the FIC and Cretaceous World TCNs are in the process of ingesting data directly from iDigBio, which includes data from our partners: YPM, University of Colorado, American Museum of Natural History, the University of Kansas, the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (submitted PEN), Oklahoma Sam Noble Museum, Fort Hays-Sternberg Museum, South Dakota School of Mines and Tech, University of Texas at Austin, the Paleontological Research Institute, and the US National Museum of Natural History. We have produced 3D scans of 48 YPM specimens, archived morphosource.org (project name Western Interior Seaway). Eleven undergraduate students have been\n\ntrained in specimen digitization techniques. Four high school students, participants in “EVOlutions” the Yale Peabody Museum after-school program, interned on the Cretaceous World TCN.\n\nKronosaurus and the Woman in the Red Dress\n\nByrd C¹\n\n¹Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Specimen Spotlight\n\nToday, Kronosaurus queenslandicus is the logo for the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) at Harvard University and a visitor destination for the MCZ’s exhibits in the Harvard Museum of Natural History in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This extinct marine reptile from the Cretaceous of Australia made a splash at the museum after it was brought to Massachusetts and prepared by Dr. Alfred Romer and his team of fossil preparators. When the fossil was fully prepared, reconstructed, and ready for exhibit, it received its day in the spotlight with the lady in the red dress. The resulting image, originally used for a Museum postcard, became an icon that is widely recognized today. Join me on a brief trek through time to explore this iconic image, learn about the lady in the red dress, and the influence of this image in the museum and paleontology communities.\n\nAre Those Teeth?: An Oreodont’s Story From New Mexico\n\nCantrell H1\n\n1New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Albuquerque, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Specimen Spotlight\n\nNew Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science stores a unique and fascinating specimen of Merychyus major, a member of the Oreodontidae family, which is an extinct group of browsing ungulates endemic to North America that lived 35 to 7 million years ago (Ma). The specimen was discovered in 2008 by two geologists of the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources as they were mapping in Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, just 18 miles south of Socorro, New Mexico. After a permit was obtained for excavation, New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science (NMMNHS), New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) worked together to collect the fossil. The specimen included a nearly complete skull, mandible, and partially articulated postcranial skeleton. To make the story even more interesting, the skull was found on one side of a fault line while the rest of the skeleton was found on the other, about one meter higher than the skull. This individual is significant for numerous reasons, the first being that it possesses an ossified larynx. The presence of an ossified larynx is extremely rare among mammals and is related to sound production. An example of a mammal alive today with an ossified larynx would be the Howler Monkey, so it is believed that this species of oreodont was able to produce loud vocalizations. Secondly, this individual was the first and remains the only one of its kind to be found in the Popotosa Formation, part of the Santa Fe Group. In addition to this oreodont being the largest of the genus Merychyus currently known, a nearby radioisotopic date indicates a late Miocene age of about 10 Ma, making this the youngest oreodont known from New Mexico.\n\nWhat Happens When You Let an Ecologist Loose on Your Specify Database: Semi-Automated Data Cleaning Using R\n\nCarper A¹, Karim T¹\n\n¹University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, Boulder, Colorado, United States\n\nThursday, 11 June – Symposium: Managing and Mobilizing Collection Data with Specify Software\n\nWhile there is a push to digitize more and more specimens, less attention has been paid to the tremendous task of verifying primary and associated digitized specimen data after it has been created. Batch processing has increased the speed and accuracy of data generation, but it has also created additional needs for quality control, as user error and/or other issues during automated processes may be magnified when applied through high throughput processing. Moreover, with millions of records in need of verification, individually checking each one is impractical, if not impossible. Thus, mechanisms to identify errors and automate identification and removal of those errors are needed to ensure higher quality data. Here, we describe our method for verification of image attachments in our Specify 6 database and discuss its potential application to other institutions.\n\nThe Invertebrate Paleontology section at the CUMNH has imaged over 60,000 fossil terrestrial arthropods since 2013 as part of the Fossil Insect Collaborative TCN (Thematic Collections Network). Images were batch uploaded into Specify using the Import Attachment Mapping File option. In order to verify that attached images are associated with the correct specimen record, we created a query in Specify to return the catalog number, comments, and the entire original file name of the image. These data were exported as csv files in batches of 20,000 records or less and merged in R, resulting in a file containing information about 61,096 image attachments. Data were initially summarized in Excel and explored using pivot tables and other formulas to understand, for example, how many attachments were associated with a single specimen record and whether the catalog number in the original file name matched the catalog number of the record to which it was attached. These types of queries enabled us to narrow down the number of records that need individual checking from over 60,000 to just a few hundred. Lastly, this workflow was standardized and made into an R script so that the same series of QC steps could be repeated periodically (e.g., when new large image datasets are imported), and more easily adapted to meet the needs of different collections.\n\nNo Môr Plastic: Utilising the Permanent Natural History Displays at Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales to Support Youth Led Climate Activism\n\nCarter J¹, Younan S¹\n\n¹Amgueddfa Cymru National Museum Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom\n\nThursday, 11 June – General (Mixed Collection) Session 3\n\nNo Môr Plastic (a play on words where ‘môr’ means ‘sea’ in the Welsh language) was a pilot project for Amgueddfa Cymru’s ‘Hands on Heritage’ programme supporting the format of the creative ‘museum intervention’; a fast-paced and temporary way to bring contemporary topics into the museum and provide young people with a platform.\n\nSuch youth-led intervention projects can provide opportunities to reassess and raise awareness of museum practices and to enable young people, and wider audiences, to influence displays and interpretation in the museum environment. These projects also open up the wealth of objects and specimens found in museum collections and enable a widened active participation in highlighting key issues around our environment, culture and heritage.\n\nThe ‘No Môr Plastic’ intervention used the permanent marine displays in the Natural History galleries to highlight the growing impact of plastic waste in the marine environment. The ideas around the intervention were led by the Museum’s Youth Forum, who in keeping with the museum format of showing authentic materials, decided that ‘real’ beach plastic should be brought into the museum and used. For this the collections and exhibitions team played an active role in supporting the intervention through their knowledge of materials, collections and the display environments, whilst keeping the overall control of the project with the Youth Forum itself.\n\nThis presentation will explore the collaborative work that occurred to develop the ideas, the process of collecting and conserving the waste to enable it to be safely used in the museum gallery environment, and the reaction and impacts of the project on visitors, staff, and the Youth Forum alike.\n\nNew Museum Guides by the Swedish National Heritage Board Concerning Human Remains and Repatriation\n\nChef Holmberg I¹, Eldh K¹\n\n¹Swedish National Heritage Board, Visby, Sweden\n\nThursday, 11 June – General (Polyphyly) Session 2\n\nAll over the world, we see movement of objects. Many objects require repatriation back to countries or groups of origin, particularly human remains. In a joint presentation, will we present two newly written guides for Swedish museums published and produced by the Swedish National Heritage Board. The first one is about museums work with the return of objects. Return of objects relates to all types of categories.\n\nHuman remains, objects with colonial context, objects stolen during Nazi times, objects belonging to indigenous peoples, etc. The other is about handling human remains in museums and describes collection management specifically based on human remains. The focus is on the processes themselves, collection, documentation, storage, research, display, deaccession, and disposal. The importance of ethical stances, communication and putting into context is emphasised.\n\nBoth guides have been written in consultation with the Swedish Central Museums and the Sami Parliament. We have encountered many questions and discussions regarding the work of both of these guidelines that we like to share. The guides have been jointly developed as many parts affect both guides. Both are intended to be read and used by museums and to inspire internationally. The guides do not create legal obligations or establish mandatory rules for museums. Museums do not have to follow the advice, as they are rather intended to facilitate the ability to act ethically and legally, through case-by-case basis. In the first part, we want to present the process in the preparation of the guides. We will focus on the process in developing the guides and how they can be used. The second part is about human remains. The presentation discusses two questions based on the experience of working with the second guide: What distinguishes human remains from other museum objects? What to consider when displaying human remains?\n\nBuilding an Online Catalogue for a Marine Invertebrate Collection Using Combined Data Sources\n\nChin C¹, Mills S¹, Wood B¹, Robbins J¹, Macpherson D¹\n\n¹National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, Wellington, New Zealand\n\nWednesday, 10 June – General (Potpourri) Session 1\n\nThe National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) holds one of New Zealand’s nationally significant collections – the NIWA Invertebrate Collection (NIC), which has an extensive collection of marine invertebrates collected since the 1950s from New Zealand, the Ross Sea region of Antarctica, and the South West Pacific. NIC uses two separate data management systems to manage their data: 1) Specify Software, a database for retaining collection records; and 2) AtlasMD, an online digital asset management tool for storing marine specimen images with embedded metadata.\n\nNIC is currently developing an online portal: an open access catalogue that provides researchers quick and direct access to information from the NIC Specify database and AtlasMD. The online portal will provide mapping tools to visualise species observations, high resolution specimen images, full search queries from selected fields available in the Specify database, and the ability to download data and images.\n\nThere are two key challenges of the online portal development: 1) linking specimen images from AtlasMD to their corresponding records on the Specify database; and 2) pre-grooming and extracting collection data for a public portal. We will discuss how we link AtlasMD images to Specify, the SQL query and taxon hierarchy table created in Specify that allows us to extract data to our portal specifications, and our experience of building the NIC Portal framework using the two combined data sources.\n\nExtending the use of Specify Software in South African Natural Science Collections\n\nCoetzer W¹\n\n¹South African Institute For Aquatic Biodiversity, Grahamstown, South Africa\n\nThursday, 11 June – Symposium: Managing and Mobilizing Collection Data with Specify Software\n\nThe South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB) has been using Specify Software with great success for 20 years. In 2018 we launched the Biodiversity Information Management Platform, through which we make Specify7 web servers available to other South African natural science institutions (seven museums are currently using the Platform). Support requests are coordinated by the Platform Manager and relayed to the team in Lawrence, Kansas, when necessary. Users have expressed their satisfaction with the Specify7 software and the Platform. Having a central Systems Administrator (who is the SAIAB Systems\n\nAdministrator), to administer the web servers of several museums, is a good way to keep up with evolving technology in the context of South African natural science museums. Many of these museums face decreasing budgets and other institutional challenges that would prevent them from adopting the Specify7 platform independently.\n\nWe manage samples of tissue and DNA using the collectionrelationship table to link to voucher specimens. All records of genomic samples are imported using the Specify Workbench. We have a central tissue workbench spreadsheet that reflects a series of consecutive slots in the freezer boxes. Records are imported as batches from this spreadsheet. This allows us to give each sample a freezer location as its record is created.\n\nWe have successfully re-used the Specify schema and Workbench application to manage data that do not represent physical specimens (structured biodiversity inventories: human observations of fish recorded in underwater videos, or invertebrates in underwater photoquadrats). Another way in which we have used the Specify schema is by creating a typical annotated checklist of taxa. The resultant data are formatted as a Darwin Core archive and published to the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) Data Portal as a checklist. The taxon, taxoncitation, and referencework tables have all the necessary fields to record literature citations, and distinguish between nomenclatural and other citations. Recording species-level information, such as country distribution and associated species in Specify (e.g., host-plants and parasites) is not possible, but we got around this by linking Specify records to records in a MS Access database. This is an area that could potentially be enhanced in future.\n\nA Lysorophian from the Mazon Creek Lagerstätte: A Story Brought to You by Citizen Scientists\n\nCoorough Burke P¹\n\n¹Milwaukee Public Museum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Specimen Spotlight\n\nVP 359229.1 and VP 359229.2 arrived at Milwaukee Public Museum along with thousands of other Mazon Creek concretions in a donation from an ambitious and energetic collector named Robert Kallas. As some of you may know the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) Mazon Creek Lagerstätte, Illinois, USA, is exceptional for the diversity and abundance of preserved fauna and flora found within siderite concretions. The flats of concretions collected by Mr. Kallas waited years before attention was given to cleaning, sorting and labeling them. In 2016 a group of knowledgeable volunteers and MPM staff began the great sorting. Hundreds of specimens were processed and a few treasures discovered, including this aquatic tetrapod, a likely Lysorophian. The specimen is currently on loan to Carleton University, Ottawa, for study by doctoral student Arjan Mann, who specializes in Permo-Carboniferous tetrapod evolution, with a focus on Mazon Creek tetrapods.\n\nThe Discoloration of Plants in Botanical Fluid Collections: A Challenge for Research and Conservation\n\nDangeon M¹\n\n¹He-arc, Neuchâtel, Switzerland\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Storage Techniques for Art, Science, and History Collections (STASH)\n\nFluid plant preservation has been and still is a method used by botanists for research purposes. Fluid conservation offers advantages that go far beyond those of herbarium and dry jar conservation: ease of use, rapidity of preparation, preservation of volumes (3D) and tissues, possibility of implementing it directly at\n\nthe moment of plant harvest (also during field campaigns). As a result, these collections are a great resource for vegetal biodiversity.\n\nUniversity of Zurich’s Botanical Collection is an academic collection built since the end of the 19th century to the end of the 20th century. The fluid collection, fallen into oblivion since 1976, presents significant degradation, very representative of the alterations encountered on this type of artefact. The main problems lie in the leaks in the jars and the aging of the joints. Another, more specific problem is the discoloration of the specimens in fluids. From this problem arose a research project titled FLUIDIS, which aims to explore different conservation solutions and their impact on the discoloration of plant specimens.\n\nThe plant discoloration leads to modification of the color of the preservative fluid. This event is clearly linked to the presence of specific dyes inside certain plant species. However, the involved mechanisms have not yet been completely clarified. The main problem with the coloring of the preserving fluid is related to the research value of the artefact as well as its exhibition value for museums. Indeed, the specimen is completely masked by the color of the fluid and it cannot be correctly observed. This phenomenon can go up to the total opacity of the fluid.\n\nWith the FLUIDIS project, we want to understand the mechanisms and phenomena related to the discoloration of botanical specimens preserved in fluid. We aim at determining the influence of the traditional recipes and modern proposals for fluid preservation. We also seek for different procedures or new liquids for the correct preservation of colours in botanical fluid collections.\n\nWhat Do You Get When You Mix Filipino Silversmiths, President Taft, and a Giant Shell? A Massive Punch Bowl!\n\nDi Giacomo M¹\n\n¹Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Specimen Spotlight\n\nAt the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, it is not rare to find treasures in the collections. However, some treasures are more puzzling than others. One morning, the conservation team was called to do an assessment of a set of objects that had been rediscovered in the Invertebrate Zoology collection. To our surprise, they consisted of a massive punch bowl made of a Tridacna gigas shell with a highly decorated silver base with fish and mermaids. In addition to the punch bowl and its ladle, a skillfully decorated 30-piece coffee and tea set is included. After initial assessment, research began. Two trays are the only pieces that have inscriptions. These point towards when and where the set was made, Manila, Philippines, 1903. More importantly, they point to the maker, Fernando Zamora. Further research revealed that it was likely that the silver and gilt set was made by brothers Fernando and Tomás Zamora, members of an award-winning family of silversmiths from Manila. Collections catalogs determined that the set, USNM 1454928, was transferred to the Smithsonian on January 13th, 1906 from the War Department, more specifically, from then Secretary and future President William H. Taft. It was then transferred from Anthropology to Invertebrate Zoology on May 3rd, 1965. The set was brought to the United States to be exhibited in the St. Louis World Fair in 1904, in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. William H. Taft was Governor of the Philippines 1900-1903, and given that the Philippines had a prominent place in the exhibit, it is likely that after the Fair ended, the set was transferred to the War Department, where he was Secretary. The set was later exhibited in the Lewis and Clark Exposition in 1905 and the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in 1906. After its transfer to Invertebrate Zoology, the punch bowl became a feature in the Department until for some reason, it was forgotten. After our assessment and initial cleaning, the punch bowl has recovered its popularity within the Department of Invertebrate Zoology, becoming once again an important piece of the history of the collection, the Smithsonian, and the USA.\n\nTaking Care of Ground Sloths and Glyptodonts: Conservation, Research, and Outreach at the Arroyo Del Vizcaíno Collection in Uruguay\n\nDi Giacomo M¹, ³, Batallés M², ³, Tambusso S², ³, Varela L², ³, Fariña R², ³\n\n¹Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, New Haven, Connecticut, United States, 2Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay, 3Servicio Académico Universitario y Centro de Estudios Paleontológicos, Universidad de la República, Sauce, Uruguay\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: Natural History Collections in Latin America\n\nThe Arroyo del Vizcaíno collection in the locality of Sauce in Canelones, Uruguay, houses nearly 2000 fossils of Pleistocene mammals, mainly ground sloths and glyptodonts, but also carnivores like Smilodon and notoungulates like Toxodon. All the fossils collected were obtained from the same site: the bottom of the Arroyo del Vizcaíno stream. The collection began informally in 1997, when a summer drought forced farmers to use water from the stream for their crops. As the bottom of the stream was exposed, hundreds of bones became visible. Teachers and students from the local highschool went to the rescue, extracting over 300 bones and storing them in the school premises. In 2011, our team of paleontologists began excavating the site and the collection was formally established. Since then, the fossils have been relocated several times. In October 2018, construction of new collection and lab spaces was finished, and the collection was moved one last time. After the February 2019 field expedition, recently excavated fossils were brought into the new spaces and shelving was installed. The last move was an opportunity to rehouse the collection using appropriate materials and to create cavity mounts for delicate fossils. Planning of the spaces was done with expansion of the collection in mind and current monitoring will allow for future environmental controls. Preparation of the fossils now occurs in a separate lab space, avoiding the generation of dust in the clean collection space. Outreach activities by the team started early in the collection’s history and now occur on a more regular basis, with didactic and exhibit materials especially created to engage the local community and also those who cannot visit through websites and social media. Research on the fossils has produced several papers in peer-reviewed journals and digitization has contributed to both research and outreach. The collection is now part of the Universidad de la República and an official educational institution in the country. Many fossils remain to be collected, ensuring a decade of future excavations. The collection will face new challenges as more fossils are collected, while continuing to preserve and showcase the paleontological heritage it holds.\n\nFacing Environmental Challenges in the Midst of Megadiversity: How are the Natural History Collections of the Colombian National Biodiversity Institute Contributing to This Goal?\n\nDíaz A¹, Acevedo-Charry O¹, Borja-Acosta K¹, Díaz J¹, DoNascimiento C¹, Espitia D¹, Lozano-Florez J¹, Neita J¹, Ocampo-Rincón D¹, Mendoza-Cifuentes H¹, Tovar-Luque E², Acosta-Galvis A¹, Gomez-Posada C¹\n\n¹Instituto de Investigacion de Recursos Biologicos Alexander von Humboldt, Villa De Leyva, Boyaca, Colombia, 2Instituto de Investigacion de Recursos Biologicos Alexander von Humboldt, Palmira, Valle del Cauca, Colombia\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: Natural History Collections in Latin America\n\nThe world is currently facing some of the most accelerated and hard environmental challenges, which are putting at risk our sources of energy, food, and water. Loss of biodiversity, impacts of climate change, and over-use of natural resources, are among these devastating factors whose effects are particularly serious in megadiverse areas of the planet, such as the tropics, where the total biodiversity is still unknown and threatened. In the particular case of Colombia, the country with the second-highest biological diversity in the world, a recently ended internal armed conflict was an additional cause that kept vast areas of the country unexplored for a long time, while facing threats like deforestation, urbanization, and mining. In the face of this dual necessity of documenting local diversity and conserving it, natural history collections of Colombia’s national biodiversity institute, the Alexander von Humboldt Institute, have played a key role during their 25-year history. What started as five collections of the main biological groups, with the solely mission of storing vouchers of the National Biodiversity Inventory, today constitutes one of the biggest repositories in the country with seven open, systematized core collections (amphibians, birds, fish, herbarium, insects, mammals and reptiles) that contain the largest representation of specimens from protected areas of the country, and four extended collections whose novel data seek to provide tools to respond to local environmental challenges: the Environmental Sounds Collection, which started in collaboration with Cornell University, providing acoustic data of Colombian biodiversity; the Seed Collection, part of the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership with Kew, contains germplasm of endemic and endangered plant species from strategic ecosystems; the Tissue Collection, provides fresh material, ready to be sequenced, of all biological groups, and the Egg Collection, with eggs from 1871 until today and harbors more than 25,000 eggs with valuable information on reproductive biology of ca. 2,000 bird species worldwide. All the data, statistics, and particulars that come from the collections are coupled with the labor of researchers and curators, who bring this information beyond the concept of biodiversity libraries to practical scenarios into fields like education, conservation, and decision-making.\n\nShifting a Collection Data Paradigm: Data Migration Between BG-BASE and Specify\n\nDrinkwater R¹, Cubey R¹, Haston E¹, King S¹\n\n¹Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n\nThursday, 11 June – Symposium: Managing and Mobilizing Collection Data with Specify Software\n\nBG-BASE and Specify have fundamentally different ways of constructing collection data. In BG-Base the physical collection event and herbarium specimen have a one-to-one relationship; in Specify a collecting event is associated with an abstract collection object, to which all specimens are attached in a one-to-many relationship.\n\nIn BG-BASE altering taxonomic or geographic attributes for a particular specimen has no effect on other specimens. In Specify, the tree structure that is utilised for taxonomy and geography means that any change has global impacts across all specimen records. This has significant implications for both the mapping and migration of collection data and the physical curation of herbarium collections. We will discuss the processes that were undertaken to successfully navigate these significant differences as part of our data migration between these two collection management systems.\n\n“Blast to the Past”: A Historic Walking Tour Organized by a Natural History Museum\n\nFang H¹, Lin Y¹\n\n¹National Taiwan Museum, Taipei, Taiwan\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: History matters! The Value of the Humanities in Natural History Museums\n\nThe National Taiwan Museum, established in 1908 during Japanese colonial period, is the oldest natural history museum in the country dedicated to natural studies. It has been considered a monument of the Japanese colonial power that was used to market Taiwan as a bountiful colony. As a result, how the Museum seeks to leave behind the colonial impression and emphasizes a reflexive view on Taiwan’s cultural communities became a major issue. In 2004, the Museum initiated the “Taiwan Museum System Plan” based on four modern architectures in downtown Taipei from Japanese period, each representing a pivotal part of Taiwan’s modern history. With the Plan, the Museum extended its space by renovating and utilizing culture heritage sites, bringing close the citizens to the heritage and terminating the building’s long standing reputation as a structural symbol of authoritarianism. By organizing a walking tour of old Taipei, “Blast to the Past”, that connects all museum branches that scatter in the old walled city area, the Museum finds a new way to interpret its history and turns the old Taipei City constructions into an atypical roofless museum that incorporates the historic buildings as a category of museum collections direct-coupled with outreach.\n\nIn Taiwan, the enforcement of cultural heritage preservation, environmental movements, and human rights movements were climaxing in the 1980’s, and more or less resulted from or were connected with Taiwan’s democratization movement. Revisiting the modern history of Taiwan during the walking tour allows both the staff and the audience to reflect on the role of the Museum in the society, and to consider the sustainable development of the institute, the different ethnic groups in the society and the environment of the island.\n\nWerner Wildlife Museum: Fifty Years and Counting\n\nFinkle P¹, Innella Maiers V¹\n\n¹Casper College Museums, Casper, Wyoming, United States\n\nTuesday, 9 June – Symposium: History matters! The Value of the Humanities in Natural History Museums\n\nThe Werner Wildlife Museum at Casper College began as a hunter’s trophy collection and has grown to over 400 birds, fish and mammals. As we celebrate an important milestone, we are taking the opportunity to look back over the museum’s last 50 years. What started out as an impressive collection located in a basement is now a growing museum focused not only on the mounts themselves but also on their habitats, behaviors, and ranges.\n\nDr. Innella Maiers and I have been working on the stories of both Mr. Werner, the museum’s founder as well as the history of the collections to determine where these mounts came from and which were original to the museum. Unfortunately, the records from the earliest days have been lost, leaving us with only grainy newspaper photographs and vague stories. As the collections grew, and the museum changed, donations came in from all around the state. We have a large collection from polar bears to bison, and from quetzals to chickadees.\n\nWe are working to piece together the history of the collection and to determine what actually belongs to the museum and what is on “long term loan”. We also seek to find how the collections were gathered, who donated what, and who might be interested in donating to the museum in the future.\n\nTogether we have begun researching the history of collections practices at other museums and universities, and hope to learn more about the college/ museum relationship. At Casper College, the museum is actively seen as both a public facing institution and a research space for students. While we strive to be both, the educational aspect for students working on a degree is limited by the current presentation of the collections and the museum’s space restrictions. With this in mind we must work to determine what the next 50 years will look like and how we can facilitate these roles in the future.\n\nBetter Together: Merging our Knowledge About People, Places, Collections, and Taxonomies with Wikidata\n\nFichtmueller D¹, Güntsch A¹, Paul D³, Bourgoin T², Agosti D,4 , Häffner E¹\n\n¹Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 2ISYEB, UMR 7205 MNHN-CNRS-Sorbonne Université-EPHE, Paris, France, 3Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, United States, 4Plazi, Bern, Switzerland\n\nWednesday, 10 June – Symposium: Envisioning Collections Management for the Evolving Biodiversity Data Lifecycle\n\nIn recent years, biological collections worldwide have begun to rethink their local data management and to open up the possibilities for inter-institutional cooperation in data management. There are opportunities for cooperation at various levels, e.g., in the joint creation and maintenance of controlled vocabulary, or the complete abandonment of locally stored data in favour of a central database. In the context of the EU initiative DiSSCo (Distributed System of Scientific Collections, https://www.dissco.eu/), a debate is currently underway on the extent to which a radical opening of specimen data into a freely accessible and editable centralized system would lead to a considerable increase in efficiency in data maintenance and at the same time open up completely new integration possibilities for collection data.\n\nWikidata (http://www.wikidata.org) and the underlying Wikibase system offer valuable functionality that is difficult and costly to implement and maintain in traditional collection systems. These are, for example, the possibility of annotating data on the web, the use of uniform controlled vocabularies, versioning of data, the assignment of stable identifiers for collection objects and the linking of textual information (e.g., personal names and geographical units) with existing semantic resources. In our presentation we will explain various examples of cross-institutional data management and discuss the potential of collaborative data management.\n\nA Juniper in a Carolina Forest\n\nFlannery M¹\n\n¹St. John’s University, Jamaica, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Specimen Spotlight\n\nThe A.C. Moore Herbarium at the University of South Carolina, Columbia has the largest plant collection in the state including material collected by Henry William Ravenel, a noted 19th-century botanist. Born near Charleston, he later farmed in Aiken, South Carolina, an inland community near Georgia. While he had been interested in botany his entire life, he returned to it seriously after the Civil War when his farm was no longer profitable, and he needed to find other sources of income. Ravenel sold the remaining sets of his five-volume Fungi Caroliniani Exsiccati as well as many of his botanical books. He also wrote for horticultural publications, collected specimens which he sold, and attempted to start a nursery business. Through all this he maintained a keen interest in the plant world around him and collected on his walks near Aiken as well as in more coastal areas where he had first lived and where many of his relations remained. Yet Ravenel notes in his journal that the specimen I discuss here was found, not by him, but by his son, Henry St. Julien Ravenel, known as “Harry,” who collected it in what is now known as Hitchcock Woods. Ravenel identified the specimen as Juniperus cammunis, now Juniperus communis L. depressa Pursh. The botanist wrote in his journal that “this spot is in virgin forest of Pine, Oak, etc. and there are no signs of clearing or of former cultivation, by which their introduction may be traced to hand of man……. Strange that the Alpine form of a tree which grows 1000 mi north, should be found here.” I consider this specimen interesting because I too am a northerner living in Aiken. More importantly, the story of Ravenel’s botanical work and his continuing links with botanists in both northern and southern states is part of the history of attempts by Southerners to rebuild their professional lives after the Civil War. In addition, the fact that over 2,100 acres of Hitchcock Woods are preserved today, suggests the continuing importance of the natural world to the people of Aiken.\n\nABS Implementation in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin and its Collection Database\n\nGiere P¹, Glöckler F¹\n\n¹Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, Berlin, Germany\n\nThursday, 11 June – General (Mixed Collection) Session 3\n\nCompliance with the Nagoya Protocol and its legal implementations is mandatory for institutions located in countries that are party to the protocol — countries that signed and legally acknowledged this international agreement. This entails the need to establish institutional procedures for compliance as well as for the documentation of activities such as access to and utilization of genetic resources (i.e., biological samples). For institutions within the EU, this is required for genetic resources collected in countries of origin that are party to the protocol after 12 October 2014. The related information is part of the metadata for the specimen or sample and it is required to hand on this information to subsequent users or when the specimen is handed on. Thus, linking up this information with the collection database is essential for keeping this data connected to the respective specimens. This, however, is difficult as ready-made collection management systems are limited in supporting institutions’ individual workflows and requirements for the proper documentation of ABS related information. Furthermore, in many cases the metadata needs to be stored and curated by administration staff even before there are any specimens collected. In this case using the collection database might be unsuitable for storing the ABS core metadata in the first place.\n\nTo solve this issue, Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (MfN) uses an instance of the Generic Data Module (GDM). It has been developed by MfN in the DFG funded project German Federation For Biological Data (GFBio, https://gfbio.org); in order to overcome the challenges of connecting additional research data and metadata with existing collection management systems. It allows for extending data models by attaching arbitrary additional data. Additionally, it can be used as a standalone tool for data curation and is so flexible that it can be used for samples, associated documents and also to manage metadata even in a non-museum research context. This presentation will outline the procedures implemented at MfN and provide insights to the application of the GDM for ABS compliance and how it ties in with the existing collection management system at the MfN.\n\nPhotographs as a Complement of Herbarium Vouchers: Implementation of “Photo Voucher” and “Fusion Voucher” Methodology in BC Herbarium\n\nGómez-Bellver C², Ibáñez N¹, López-Pujol J¹, Susanna A¹, Nualart N¹\n\n¹Botanic Institute of Barcelona (IBB, CSIC-Ajuntament de Barcelona), Barcelona, Spain, 2Unit of Botany and Mycology, Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Espanya\n\nThursday, 11 June – General (Mixed Collection) Session 3\n\nIn the herbarium of the Botanic Institute of Barcelona (BC) we have begun implementing a standardised protocol to complement traditional specimens with photographs. Although the use of photographs to complement specimens has been used in some herbaria, here we propose for the first time an international standard that should regulate the use of photographs; such standard has been recently published in Taxon (https://doi.org/10.1002/tax.12162). Standardized images allow us to have a record of a field occurrence, and therefore must meet a series of technical requirements. The photographs should allow the precise identification of the plant and should reflect the size, habitat, and details of the main organs or other elements that can help the correct determination of the taxon. As an additional suggestion, we recommend the use of a ruler and, if it is possible, a standard color chart. In a “Fusion voucher” the sheet contains, in addition to the plant sample, one or several photographs. This method for vouchering is useful in plants that may present certain difficulties at the time of their collection, due of the type of material (phototoxic or very spiny plants) or the excessive size of the specimen (e.g., palm trees and tree ferns), or because drying may have a negative effect on some taxonomic characters (such as orchids). In a series of cases, however, it may be impossible to collect material and, thus, photographs may be the only option to document the presence of a plant in a given locality. A “Photo voucher” is exclusively a set of standardized pictures and, therefore, represents a solution for plants protected by law (e.g., threatened or endemic species) for which there is no collection permit or in cases where it is not possible to access the collection site (e.g., specimens located on cliffs). Standardizing and incorporating these kinds of vouchers in herbaria and plant collections represents a significant improvement in order to solve the underrepresentation of those species more difficult to collect, such as plants that would result in very large specimens, spiny, thorny or prickly plants, or threatened species.\n\nA complete digitization of German herbaria is possible, sensible and should be started now\n\nBorsch T¹, Stevens A-D¹, Häffner E¹, Güntsch A¹, Berendsohn W¹, Appelhans M², Barilaro C³, Beszteri B4, Blattner F5, Bossdorf O6, Dalitz H7, Dressler S8, Duque-Thüs R7, Esser H-J9, Franzke A10, Goetze D11, Grein M12, Grünert U6, Hellwig F13, Hentschel J13, Hörandl E2, Janßen T14, Jürgens N15, Kadereit G16, Karisch T17, Koch M10, Müller F18, Müller J13, Ober D19, Porembski S11, Poschlod P20, Printzen C8, Röser M21, Sack P10, Schlüter P7, Schmidt M22, Schnittler M23, Scholler M24, Schultz M15, Seeber E23, Simmel J24, Stiller M12, Thiv M25, Thüs H25, Tkach N21, Triebel D9,26, Warnke U3, Weibulat T26,29, Wesche K27, Yurkov A28, Zizka G8,30\n\n¹Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 2Department of Systematics, Biodiversity and Evolution of Plants, University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany, 3Landesmuseum Natur und Mensch, Oldenburg, Germany, 4Universität Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany, 5Leibniz-Institut für Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung (IPK) Gatersleben, Gatersleben, Germany, 6Universität Tübingen, Institute of Evolution & Ecology, Tübingen, Germany, 7Universität Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany, 8Senckenberg Museum Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 9Staatliche Naturwissenschaftliche Sammlungen Bayerns, Botanische Staatssammlung München, München, Germany, 10Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, 11Universität Rostock, Lehrstuhl Allgemeine und Spezielle Botanik und Botanischer Garten, Rostock, Germany, 12Übersee-Museum Bremen, Bremen, Germany, 13Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Department of Systematic Botany with Herbarium Haussknecht and Botanic Garden, Jena, Germany, 14Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institut für Biologie, Späth-Arboretum der Humboldt-Universität, Berlin, Germany, 15Institut für Pflanzenwissenschaften und Mikrobiologie, Herbarium Hamburgense, Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany, 16Institute for Molecular Physiology, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Mainz, Germany, 17Museum für Naturkunde und Vorgeschichte, Dessau, Germany, 18Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany, 19Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Botanisches Institut und Botanischer Garten Kiel, Kiel, Germany, 20University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany, 21Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany, 22Stadt Frankfurt am Main – Palmengarten, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 23Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany, 24Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, 25Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany, 26Staatliche Naturwissenschaftliche Sammlungen Bayerns, SNSB IT Center, München, Germany, 27Senckenberg Museum of Natural History Görlitz, Görlitz, Germany, 28Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany, 29GFBio – Gesellschaft für Biologische Daten e.

They are the basis for human well-being, providing food, materials and medicines. Specimens of all three groups of organisms are accommodated in herbaria. The large number of specimens in herbaria provides an ample, permanent and continuously improving knowledge base on these organisms and an indispensable source for the analysis of the distribution of species in space and time critical for current and future research relating to global biodiversity. In order to make full use of this resource, a research infrastructure has to be built that grants comprehensive and free access to the information in herbaria and botanical collections in general. This can be achieved through digitization of the botanical objects and associated data.\n\nThe botanical research community can count on a long-standing tradition of collaboration among institutions and individuals. In the spirit of this collaborative history, 51 representatives from 30 institutions advocate to start the digitization of botanical collections with the overall wall-to-wall digitization of the flat objects stored in German herbaria. Germany has 70 herbaria holding almost 23 million specimens. 87% of these specimens are not yet digitized.\n\nMaking full use of the data gained by digitization requires the set-up of a digital infrastructure for storage, archiving, content indexing and networking as well as standardized access for the scientific use of digital objects. A standards-based portfolio of technical components has already been developed and successfully tested by the Biodiversity Informatics Community over the last two decades.\n\nHerbaria constitute a large part of the German botanical collections that also comprise living collections in botanical gardens and seed banks, DNA- and tissue samples, specimens preserved in fluids or on microscope slides and more. Once the herbaria are digitized, these resources can be integrated, adding to the value of the overall research infrastructure. We have compiled nine scientific use cases of immediate societal relevance for an integrated infrastructure of botanical collections. We propose to start this initiative now in order to valorize German botanical collections as a vital part of a worldwide biodiversity data pool.\n\nChief Red Cloud’s War Shirt\n\nHarding D¹\n\n¹Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Specimen Spotlight\n\nRed Cloud was a very important chief among the Lakota Sioux.

Yet the term is understood diversely among natural science collections professionals and especially from one digitization initiative to another, the outputs can be quite different.\n\nDigitization can lead to digital data for collections as a whole (i.e., an overview), for sub-parts of collections (inventories of trays of insects or boxes of herbarium sheets, for example) and to digital data for individual specimens. The first two categories contribute towards providing coverage information about the assets of a collection-holding institution, in terms of scope and extent. Digitization of individual specimens provides explicit and precise details about each object curated in a collection, that can be used for varied purposes. Even so, digitization of individual specimens is based on diverse aims, the needs of specific projects and the specific practices and workflows in different institutions. Capturing and presenting such data from future digitization in standard forms is essential so that data can be more easily understood, compared, analysed and communicated via the Internet. By harmonising a framework that clarifies what is meant by different levels of digitization (MIDS level, MICS level), as well as the minimum information to be captured at each level, it becomes easier to consistently measure the extent of digitization achieved over time (e.g., collection digitization dashboard) and to set priorities for the remaining work. Similarly, ensuring that enough data are captured, curated, and published with specified quality is essential so they are useful for the widest possible range of future research, teaching, and learning purposes.\n\nThe Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen (MIDS) specification, and its companion specification for information about collections – the Minimum Information about a Digital Collection (MICS) specification – aim to address these problems. MIDS/MICS are ‘minimum specifications’, by which is meant that the information specified as necessary at a specific MIDS/MICS level are the minimum expected to be made digitally available following each major stage of digitization. More is not precluded.\n\nThe Trials and Tribulations of a Hardy Geranium\n\nHarvey Y¹, Booth-Downs C¹\n\n¹Royal Horticultural Society, Wisley, United Kingdom\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: Specimen Spotlight\n\nIn April 2010 Horticulture Week reported that a Dutch grower had been forced to stop growing Geranium ‘Jolly Bee’, after DNA testing showed it to be exceptionally close to another cultivar. Devastated by the decision, the Dutch grower estimated that the battle had cost him in excess of €200K. Geranium ROZANNE (‘Gerwat’ PBR) was the cultivar that caused his loss.\n\nIn the Summer of 1990 the Waterers, keen horticulturists based in Somerset, UK, spotted the deep blue summer flowering Geranium himalayense and the autumn flowering G. wallichianum ‘Buxton’s Variety’ flowering (and setting seed) together. The following summer, Donald Waterer noted the potential of one of the seedlings and called it Rozanne, after his wife. He passed the new cultivar to Blooms of Bressinghams Nursery and by 2000 they had enough stock to officially launch the ‘sensational new Geranium’ at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Chelsea Flower Show with the trade name of ROZANNE, and its cultivar name ‘Gerwat’. Blooms also obtained ‘Plant Breeders Rights’ (PBR) for the new plant.\n\nAround the time of the launch of ROZANNE a Dutch grower also discovered a new cross. His plant, ‘Jolly Bee’, was granted protection by Plant Variety Rights (PVR) in 2003. In the UK, ‘Jolly Bee’ became publicly available via Thompson & Morgan, an independent seed and plant supplier. Unbeknown to them, their ‘magnificent new cultivar’ matched ROZANNE.\n\nIn 2006 the RHS ran a Trial of hardy geraniums, and both cultivars were entered. The judges unsurprisingly reported that ‘these entries were found to have no characters which could be used consistently to distinguish them and are therefore described together’. Together they achieved the ‘Award of Garden Merit’. The RHS herbarium, specialising in UK ornamentals, has specimens of both taxa, made during their launches, and also specimens from the plants Trialled in 2006. Although no longer available alive, everyone can view ‘Jolly Bee’ online via rhs.org.uk or in person at RHS Garden Wisley.\n\n‘Yours and a Crowd’\n\nHarvey Y¹, Paterson L²\n\n¹Royal Horticultural Society, RHS Garden Wisley, England, UK, 2Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK\n\nThursday, 11 June – General (Polyphyly) Session 2\n\nFormerly viewed as the almost exclusive territory of an elite band of plant enthusiasts, large public gardens such as the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (the Botanics) and the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) Garden Wisley, are being rediscovered by new audiences who now view them more as living museums/immersive experiences. Custodians of the gardens are sparking the imagination of a much wider audience by the use of innovative interpretation: using stories of the plant collectors, tales of how the plants were found, their societal uses and more besides. In so doing, they are discovering new ways of reaching, and interacting with a wide-range of visitors.\n\nThere can’t be a single garden that isn’t touched in some way by George Forrest, the Scottish plant hunter. The Botanics and the RHS share his archives, living and dried plant collections and these have, and are being used in ways to inspire, inform and involve their new audiences. As a botanic garden, the Botanics has a large number of plants of wild origin. Specialising in ornamental horticulture, RHS Garden Wisley contains thousands of cultivars whose origin lie with Forrest’s introductions.\n\nWhen Forrest’s plant introductions were made in the early 20th century, horticulturists and scientists were terribly excited by his new finds. Today we too marvel at his discoveries, but we see them with an enlightened eye. We are able to use our collections (living and dead) to explore numerous topics including some of our current concerns such as conservation, climate change, and decolonisation.\n\nHow Many Specimens Have We Digitised and What Can We Do With Them? Well it Depends What You Mean by Digitised …\n\nHaston E¹, Hardisty A², Petersen M³, Groom Q4\n\n¹Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 2Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom, 3Museum\n\nfür Naturkunde Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 4Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium\n\nFriday, 12 June – Symposium: MIDS and MICS: Minimum Information Out of Digitisation\n\nThe priority to digitise our collections has become more accepted by natural science institutes and funders and the majority of institutes are now actively digitising their collections. This has resulted in the current number of 168,228,196 preserved specimen records in GBIF which can be considered as digitised to some extent. However, there is a wide range in the amount of data present in each of these records and the term ‘digitised’ cannot encapsulate this variation. For collection managers who are reporting on their digitisation programmes, for researchers who will be using the resulting data, and for bioinformaticians who will be including the digital specimens in processing pipelines, there is a need for additional clarity regarding the level of digitisation of the specimens. The proposal for a Minimum Information Standard for Digital Specimens (MIDS) is intended to provide that information for these users. This presentation describes the need for this system and an outline of the structure that such a system could take.\n\nMediasphere for Nature: A Model Example for a Media Application Lab Promoting Collaboration of Institutions Holding Attractive and Diverse Media Content Originating From Research and Scientific Collections With SMEs of the Media – and Creative Industries\n\nHoffmann J¹, Dobberthin J¹, Schneider T¹, Hoffmann A¹, Tata N¹\n\n¹Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, Berlin, Germany\n\nThursday, 11 June – General (Mixed Collection) Session 3\n\nApplication Labs are places for transferring research results into products, processes, and services. They represent a powerful interface between science and industry. As integrated infrastructure units they build on the scientific and technological expertise of the respective research institution reaching out to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME), in particular. The innovative approach of a media application lab is to promote the collaboration of institutions holding attractive and diverse media content originating from research and scientific collections with SMEs of the media- and creative industries. Such an approach creates an environment for publication, exchange and re-use of object related multimedia and (scientific) domain knowledge through online search portals and other digital tools. It also fosters the creation of technological or non- technological prototypes and products, such as applications and services for end-users, in close collaboration with the content holding institution.\n\nOne example of such an open lab infrastructure is the Leibniz Application Lab, Mediasphere for Nature. Its vision is to become the first place to go for Start-ups, SMEs, industry and society to develop knowledge-based products and services relevant for nature and society at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (MfN). Through this open lab infrastructure the MfN partners with about 20 different SMEs in the region in designing, testing, and implementing prototypes, e.g. demonstrators, show-cases, and feasibility studies, and products, e.g. applications and services, in a collaborative, non-customer/contractor approach. Furthermore, it sustains a partner network of almost 40 interested start-ups, SMEs, associations, and individuals. A number of prototypes and products in the area of VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality) and interactive design were already developed. Mediasphere for Nature supported a number of innovative initiatives, e.g. the hackathon Coding da Vinci, and provides regular network meetings and workshop formats for improving its partner network. The success of this media application lab hints towards the potential need for such an infrastructure for content and knowledge exchange as well as technology transfer also at other research museums. Furthermore, it provides a rich reservoir of lessons learnt and established processes and showcases, which can be compared to other, similar initiatives at GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) institutions.\n\nThe Dynamic Role of Collections Managers\n\nHogue G¹, McCuller M¹\n\n¹North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States\n\nWednesday, 10 June – Symposium: Envisioning Collections Management for the Evolving Biodiversity Data Lifecycle\n\nThe basic definition of collections management seems straightforward — preserve and develop collections for their long-term sustainability while fulfilling the institutional mission statement. However, while this definition still forms the foundation for collections managers, the services that are expected have increased exponentially in depth and breadth. Assumed responsibilities currently include, but are not limited to: taxonomic expertise, numerous digitization methods, data and software management, outreach, personal research, supervisory and mentorship responsibilities, grant writing and management, maintaining the applicability of the collection for current and future research needs, and showcasing the relevance of the collection to the public. Nested within these expectations are multiple, time-consuming sub-tasks. For example, outreach can encompass myriad platforms such as social media, non peer-reviewed publications, museum events, tours, and workshops. The knowledge requirements usually far surpass the available institutional support, leaving staff feeling over-burdened and under-prepared. In addition, while the job duties increase for those already in collections management positions, new hires are usually expected to have all of the necessary skills up-front. Despite the ever-increasing responsibilities, collections management work is very gratifying and dynamic. The future promises a lot of excitement and possibilities as we work towards the implementation of extended specimen networks and the increased use and applicability of collections. We intend to discuss the role of collections managers and the services that we provide. We will also discuss possible solutions for the prioritization of those services within the greater context of the collection’s needs, avail"
