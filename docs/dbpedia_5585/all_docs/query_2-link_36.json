        "text": "Beautiful, unusual and captivating – these ammonites come from the collection of the founder of English geology himself! They are Britain’s oldest species of ammonite, a fascinating mollusc related to living squid that jet propelled through the ocean more than 65 million years ago. It was through discovery and inspection of fossils like these that William Smith was able to create the first geological map of Britain. Smith’s ability to map Britain’s geology was made possible by a lengthy understanding of fossils. He knew that distinct combinations of fossils in a rock – like these amazing ammonites – could be used to identify it. Do you want to learn more about the man behind the geological map? 🤔\n\nThese flightless birds can teach us a great lesson about the dangers of human greed to the natural world. 😮 The great auk was a flightless bird that bred on remote islands around Canada, Greenland, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and the UK. They were very sadly driven to extinction in 1844, after years of exploitation. European fisherman and whalers devastated their entire population for food, feathers and fat. Whilst the great auk is extinct, we’re still making new discoveries about this fascinating species. In 2017, we started a groundbreaking project with the University of Sheffield to compare the structure of great auk eggs with their closest living relatives to learn more about their breeding ecology. The Museum holds six of the remaining 75 known great auk eggs – one of which is approaching 250 years old! An example of the great auk can be found in the Treasures Cadogan gallery. Had you heard this story before?\n\nFor #HomeEducationDay next month, we're hosting a day at the Museum that gives home educated children the opportunity to enjoy a day of exclusive learning activities, talks and workshops, led by our amazing Learning Facilitators and Museum scientists. From meeting our scientists to exploring 3D printing, and even a quiet multi-sensory calm space away from the busy museum, we're excited to inspire young learners! 😍 Tag a home educator who you think would be interested in this event 👇 Find out more and book your ticket here 👉 https://lnkd.in/eW-i6HqR\n\nWe want to say a massive thank you to this group of talented blind and partially sighted young people who co-created our audio guide for the new Museum gardens! 👏 One of the key focuses of our gardens was to make a space that was inclusive and accessible to all, so we conducted a week of workshops and creative sessions with poet, rapper and writer Testament and the young people from our Youth Advisory Panel. From smelling soil samples to feeling the shape of fossils that are millions of years old, they explored their sensory reactions to the objects and their emotional reactions to stories from our scientists. Their experience has been captured and shaped into 13 spoken word pieces. You can now explore the garden in their own words in our audio guide 👇 https://lnkd.in/eXWfAUdH\n\nNature never ceases to amaze! 😍 This is a carrier shell. It has the peculiar habit of collecting and attaching foreign objects to its body as it grows, including corals, other mollusc shells, pebbles, fossils, and even man-made materials like plastic! Whilst we aren’t entirely sure why the carrier shell is such a collector, it could be for camouflage or to increase its shell strength. 🐚 Their full name, Xenophora pallidula, reflects their tendency to pick things up – it is derived from two ancient Greek words meaning ‘carrier of foreign objects’. You can find this remarkable shell in our Marine Invertebrates Gallery. Why not come and see if you can spot it?\n\nCoelacanths are a fish thought to have gone extinct 66 million years ago – so you can imagine Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer's shock when she witnessed a living one in 1938. Caught up in a trawl net, the fish was 1.5 metres long with vivid blue scales and strange, fleshy fins. It looked as though it had swum right out of a sci-fi film! Latiner brought on the assistance of fish expert, JLB Smith. He was equally astounded at the sight of the living fossil and became determined to find a second specimen. In 1952, a fisherman called Ahmadi Abdulla, a fisherman from the Comoro, rose to the task. Whilst this was Western science’s second recorded living coelacanth, locally they had been named Gambessa, and two to three had been caught each year during night fishing. We don't know how many coelacanths there are, but their bombshell appearance on the scientific scene has certainly made fishing them more popular. Certain species of coelacanth are now considered vulnerable or endangered. Finding this living fossil has further developed our understanding of evolution and the natural world. What do you think of this fascinating fish?\n\nHave you encountered our animatronic deinonychus before? 😨 Deinonychus was a small meat-eating dinosaur that lived in the early cretaceous in what is now North America. The first deinonychus fossils were found in southern Montana in 1964. It turns out that deinonychus was a bit of a trend setter. Its discovery contributed to a broader change of view in scientists globally. Previously, dinosaurs were considered to be slow, lumbering and cold-blooded beasts. The discovery of deinonychus made us realise they could be athletic, warm-blooded animals! They had a large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each foot, which was kept off the ground to ensure it stayed sharp.\n\nHintze Hall boasts some very special specimens - but you can’t miss these two! These 4.35-meter-tall giraffes tower above visitors near the main door, greeting you as you enter. There are many theories to suggest why the giraffe’s neck evolved to be quite so long... 🌳 It was first believed that their long neck was used to eat from the very highest branches. 💪 Some believed that male giraffes would use their necks to fight each other! 🌄 Perhaps they used their necks to look for predators far on the horizon? 😅 Or... maybe it was just chance that caused their neck to grow so long! Comparing the anatomy of our taxidermy and skeleton pair is a tribute to the work of Richard Owen and teaches us how these graceful giants came to walk the Earth. Have we left out any theories? Let us know in the comments! 👇\n\nWe believe that making a difference to UK nature needs to be done in collaboration with others, and protecting nature can’t wait. 🌿 For our Urban Nature Project, we’ve partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to use their cloud technology to make it easier and quicker for our scientists to reach conclusions and practically support UK urban nature recovery. Thanks to this blending of science and technology, our newly transformed gardens will become one of the most intensively studied urban sites of its kind. 😮 Read more about the technology in our new gardens below 👇 https://lnkd.in/e36MtkuY"
