        "text": "The Museum is committed to providing an environment free from harassment or discrimination in the treatment of individuals with respect to employment, and admission or access to Museum facilities, programs or activities, and therefore does not permit harassment or discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, religion, age, disability, marital status, partnership status, gender (including sexual harassment), sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, pregnancy and lactation accommodations, alienage or citizenship status, current or former participation in the uniformed services, status as a veteran, caregiver, pre-employment marijuana testing, sexual and reproductive health decisions, salary history, or national or ethnic origin, or on account of any other basis prohibited by applicable City, State, or Federal law.\n\nAdditional protections are afforded in employment based on arrest or conviction record, status as a victim of domestic violence, stalking and sex offenses, unemployment status, and credit history, in each case to the extent provided by law.\n\nAccessibility / Language Assistance and Limited English Proficiency (“LEP”)\n\nConsistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is the policy of the Museum to provide reasonable accommodations when requested by a qualified individual with a disability, unless such accommodation would cause an undue hardship.\n\nAdditionally, the Museum strives to make its facilities and programs accessible for everyone, including those individuals who need language assistance, including those who have limited English proficiency.\n\nPlease visit the Accessibility and Language Assistance at the Museum section of our website to learn more about Museum facilities, resources, and programs. If you have any questions about accessibility or LEP at the Museum or would like to request an accommodation, please contact us at [email protected] or 212-769-5250. In addition, if the format of any material on the Museum’s website interferes with your ability to access that material, please contact us for assistance.\n\nGrievance Procedures for Visitors\n\nVisitor inquiries or complaints regarding any form of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation may be directed to [email protected]\n\nIf a visitor thinks that they have been denied meaningful access to the Museum’s services, programs, and/or activities, the Grievance Procedures below will be followed pursuant to the Museum’s obligations under relevant federal, state, and local laws.1\n\nBasis for Complaint\n\nComplaints may be submitted if a visitor believes the Museum failed to provide reasonable language assistance for people of limited English proficiency, or if the visitor believes the Museum committed unlawful discrimination based on the visitor’s disability or other protected characteristic.\n\nHow to Submit a Complaint\n\nSend an email to [email protected], or submit a complaint in person at the Museum Security Desk at 79th Street on the First Floor in the Theodore Roosevelt Rotunda.\n\nGrievance Procedures\n\nWhere there is found to be a violation, the Museum will take immediate steps to end the prohibited conduct, to prevent its recurrence, and to remedy its effects. The Museum will address allegations of prohibited conduct as follows:\n\nComplaints must be submitted in writing (or, if necessary, in a different accessible format) and must contain the following information: (i) the name, address, and phone number of the person(s) submitting the complaint; (ii) a brief description of the nature of the complaint; and (iii) a description of the circumstances giving rise to the complaint, including the date/time/location/name(s) of relevant information and individuals, if available.\n\nComplaints should be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days after the alleged incident, but early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived problems. The Museum’s ability to investigate and respond effectively may be reduced with the passage of time and the loss of reliable evidence.\n\nThe Museum will conduct an investigation as may be appropriate based on the receipt of a complaint. The investigation will be prompt and informal, but also thorough. All interested persons will have an opportunity to submit relevant information. Generally speaking, the Museum will contact the person(s) who submitted the complaint within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the complaint to discuss the allegations, gather additional information, if needed, and discuss possible resolutions.\n\nThe Museum will generate and provide a written document summarizing its findings from the investigation, along with any proposed solution(s), generally within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the complaint. This timeline may be altered for good cause, such as the complexity of the investigation or availability of witnesses. Any extensions will be communicated to the person(s) who submitted the complaint.\n\nThe person(s) who submitted the complaint may request an appeal of the findings based on either of the following: (1) there is previously unavailable relevant evidence which could significantly impact the outcome of the investigation; or (2) the Museum failed to follow these Grievance Procedures when investigating the complaint. Any appeal must be submitted in writing (or, if necessary, in a different accessible format) within ten (10) calendar days of receiving the findings. The Museum will forward the request to the appropriate Museum administrator(s) for further review (e.g. the Vice President of Human Resources if an employee is alleged to have committed misconduct, or to the Chair of the Accessibility Working Group for issues related to exhibit access or visitor experience issues). The Museum will generally respond to the appeal in writing or another accessible format within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the appeal. Any extensions will be communicated to the person(s) who submitted the complaint and appeal. The appellate decision is final.\n\nThe Museum shall maintain all files and records relating to the submitted complaint consistent with the Museum’s record retention policies.\n\nIndividuals May Also File Compaints, As Applicable, With These Agencies:\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, which has its regional enforcement office at Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education, 32 Old Slip, 26th floor, New York, NY 10005-2500, 646-428-3900, or [email protected];\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, located at 33 Whitehall Street, 5th floor, New York, NY 10004, 800-669-4000;\n\nThe Department of Justice: Federal Coordination and Compliance Section, U.S. Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20530; or\n\nThe Department of Justice: Disability Rights Section, U.S. Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20530.\n\n1 For visitor complaints against specific employees of the Museum, separate policies and procedures may apply depending on the nature of the complaint and surrounding circumstances.\n\nThese Grievance Procedures are subject to change at any time.

This policy focuses on transactions in which the aforementioned individuals, their Relatives and Related Entities, as defined below, have financial interests, as well as other situations in which an individual’s personal interests may not align with the best interests of the Museum.\n\nI. Conflicts of Interest A conflict of interest may arise when an individual with a fiduciary duty to the Museum has a personal or professional interest in the outcome of a situation involving the Museum. Upon encountering or becoming aware of such a situation, the individual shall disclose it to the Chair of the Audit Committee, through the Museum’s General Counsel. If the individual is present at any meeting when the matter is considered, he or she shall withdraw from the meeting prior to commencement of deliberations and vote on the matter, and otherwise not make any attempt to improperly influence the deliberation or voting on the matter giving rise to the conflict. These actions, including the Audit Committee’s determination, shall be recorded in the minutes of any meeting considering the matter. Such a situation is not necessarily prohibited or adverse to the Museum and may be permitted or managed to protect against any adverse effect on the Museum, in either case if the Audit Committee determines that it is in the best interests of the Museum to do so at the time of the determination.\n\nII. Related Party Transactions A “Related Party Transaction” is any transaction, agreement or other arrangement with the Museum in which a Trustee, Officer, Committee Member, Key Person, or a Relative or a Related Entity to any of the above, has a financial interest, except that a transaction shall not be a Related Party Transaction if (i) the transaction or the Related Party’s financial interest in the transaction is de minimis; (ii) the transaction would not customarily be reviewed by the Board or boards of similar organizations in the ordinary course of business, and is available to others on the same or similar terms; or (iii) the transaction constitutes a benefit provided to a Related Party solely as a member of a class of the beneficiaries that the Museum intends to benefit as part of the accomplishment of its mission, which benefit is available to all similarly-situated members of the same class, on the same terms. Page 1 of 3 A “Relative” of an individual means (i) his or her spouse or domestic partner as defined in section 2994-A of the New York Public Health Law; (ii) his or her ancestor, brother or sister (whether by whole or half-blood), child (whether natural or adopted), grandchild, great grandchild; or (iii) the spouse or domestic partner of his or her brother, sister, child, grandchild or great grandchild. A “Related Entity” is an entity in which a Trustee, Officer, Committee Member, Key Person (or a Relative of any one of them) has a 35% or greater ownership or beneficial interest (or in the case of a partnership or professional corporation, a more than 5% direct or indirect ownership interest). Any Trustee, Officer, Committee Member, Key Person who encounters or otherwise becomes aware of a proposed Related Party Transaction, shall promptly disclose the material facts of the financial interest, prior to deliberations and decision on the transaction, to the Chair of the Audit Committee through the Museum’s General Counsel, and the transaction will be deferred pending resolution by the Audit Committee. The individual shall disclose in good faith to the Audit Committee the material facts concerning their financial interest. If the individual is present at any meeting when the transaction is considered, he or she shall withdraw from the meeting prior to commencement of deliberations and vote, and otherwise not make any attempt to improperly influence the deliberation or voting on the transaction. These actions, including the Audit Committee’s determination, shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Such a transaction is not necessarily prohibited or adverse to the Museum. A Related Party Transaction may be permitted or managed to protect against any adverse effect on the Museum, provided that the Museum shall not enter into the Related Party Transaction unless the Audit Committee determines that the transaction is fair, reasonable and in the best interests of the Museum at the time of the determination. In addition, if the Audit Committee determines that the financial interest is a substantial financial interest, the Audit Committee must also review alternative transactions, to the extent available, before making its determination. The Audit Committee must also review appropriate comparable data if a transaction pertains to compensation for services, the transfer of property, or other economic benefit to that party or any other person or entity which would be considered a “disqualified person” for purposes of the IRS’ excess benefit transaction rules, to determine that the amount being paid by the Museum does not exceed the value of what the Museum will receive. When considering the comparability of compensation, the types of relevant comparability data which the Audit Committee may consider include, but are not limited to (1) compensation levels paid by similarly-situated organizations, both exempt and non-exempt; (2) the availability of similar services within the same geographic area; (3) current compensation surveys compiled by independent firms; and (4) written offers from similar institutions competing for the same person’s services. When the transaction involves the transfer of real property as consideration, the relevant factors include, but are not limited to (i) current independent appraisals of the property, and (ii) offers received in a competitive bidding process. The Audit Committee is free to consider other indicators of comparability, as it sees fit. Page 2 of 3 The minutes of the meeting of the Audit Committee shall record the disclosure of the Related Party Transaction, the terms of the transaction, the interested person’s abstention from consideration of the matter, and basis for the determination, if made, that the transaction is fair, reasonable and in the best interest of the Museum at the time of the determination, and the consideration of alternative transactions or comparability data where required.\n\nIII. Annual Written Disclosures and Statements Each Trustee, Officer and Key Person must, prior to his or her initial election or appointment, and on an annual basis thereafter, disclose the following information to the best of his or her knowledge, in writing to the Secretary of the Board, or his or her designee: (i) any entity of which such person is an officer, director, trustee, member, owner (either as a sole proprietor or a partner), or employee and with which the Museum has a relationship; (ii) any transaction in which the Museum is a participant and in which such person might have a conflicting interest; and (iii) other information about their familial and business relationships as required for purposes of the Museum’s ongoing reporting obligations. In addition, each Trustee, Officer and Key Person must annually sign and submit to the Secretary of the Board, or his or her designee, a statement which affirms such person: (a) has received a copy of this Policy, (b) has read and understands this Policy, and (c) has agreed to comply with this Policy. The Secretary, or his or her designee, will provide a copy of all completed statements to the Chair of the Audit Committee and keep copies in the Museum’s files.\n\nAmerican Museum of Natural History Policy and Procedures on Financial Conflict of Interest Related to Federally Sponsored Projects Policy\n\nWhenever an investigator has a significant financial interest in an enterprise which might reasonably appear to be affected by discoveries in the investigator’s sponsored project, there is the potential for a real or perceived conflict of interest. Although the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) does not require investigators to disclose their personal financial interests as a matter of routine, AMNH is sometimes obligated to require disclosure under federal regulations. Such disclosures are the most widely accepted method for identifying and managing actual or potential conflicts of interest related to federally sponsored projects.\n\nIt is the policy of AMNH that all investigators on federally sponsored projects are required to disclose significant personal financial interests related to that project, pursuant to circumstances specified by this policy. When AMNH determines that such an interest might reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the sponsored project, AMNH will take steps either to manage or to eliminate the conflict.\n\nThis policy implements federal requirements pertaining to U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), which includes National Institutes of Health (NIH), and which are published in 42 CFR Part 50 and 45 CFR Part 94. This policy also implements federal requirements contained in the National Science Foundation Award and Administration Guide’s “Conflict of Interest Policies.” Both agencies require AMNH maintains an appropriate written policy on conflict of interest disclosure as a condition for receiving their grants. These requirements, as implemented in this policy, are applicable to all proposals and awards for federally sponsored projects at AMNH.\n\nDefinitions\n\nAMNH Reviewing Official\n\nAn official designated by AMNH to collect and review completed Financial Interest Disclosure Forms and to make the initial determination whether any reported financial interest would reasonably appear to directly and significantly affect or be affected by the sponsored project. The AMNH Reviewing Official is currently the Director, Government Grants.\n\nInstitutional Responsibilities\n\nInstitutional responsibilities are defined as an Investigator’s professional responsibilities on behalf of AMNH, and may include activities such as research, research consultation, teaching, and AMNH committee memberships.\n\nInvestigator\n\nAny individual responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of the results of work performed or to be performed under the sponsored project. This includes the Principal Investigator, Co-Investigators, and any other individual who has independent responsibility for designing, conducting or reporting the results of the sponsored project. This term is not intended to include individuals who are purely advisory and thus are not in a position to influence design, conduct or reporting of the project.\n\nSignificant Financial Interest\n\nA financial interest must be reported when required by the above-referenced federal regulations. The requirement that an Investigator must report a significant financial interest under the terms of this policy does not in and of itself imply the existence of an actual or potential conflict of interest. The existence of a conflict of interest is determined subsequently by the designated AMNH Reviewing Official, responsible Senior Vice President and, when necessary, review committee. If a conflict is identified, additional steps to manage or eliminate the conflict may be required.\n\nConsistent with current federal regulations, AMNH identifies two sets of definitions of Significant Financial Interest, one applicable to all federally-funded project proposals and awards except for those funded by PHS, and the other applicable only to PHS-funded project proposals and awards. This policy defines Significant Financial Interest as anything of monetary value, including, but not limited to:\n\nAll federal project funding except for PHS:\n\nIncome from a single business entity, including salary, consulting payments, honoraria, royalty payments, dividends, loans from the entity, or any other payments or consideration with value, exceeding $10,000 during the prior twelve months when aggregated for an Investigator, Investigator’s spouse/domestic partner and dependent children;\n\nIncome from a single public or nonprofit entity, including salary, consulting payments, honoraria, royalty payments, dividends, loans from the entity or any other payments or consideration with value, exceeding $10,000 during the prior twelve months when aggregated for an Investigator, Investigator’s spouse/domestic partner and dependent children, excluding income from seminars, lectures, teaching engagements, or service on advisory committees or review panels for public or non profit entities;\n\nAn equity interest, in the form of stock, stock options, real estate, or any other investment or ownership interest, a 5% ownership interest, or a loan to the entity, exceeding $10,000 in value, for any one enterprise when aggregated for an Investigator and the Investigator’s spouse/domestic partner and dependent children;\n\nA management position such as board member, director, officer, partner, or trustee, held by the Investigator; or\n\nIntellectual property interest held by the Investigator or Investigator’s spouse/domestic partner or dependent children on a patent, patent application, or a copyright of software that would reasonably appear to be affected by the sponsored project at issue.\n\nPHS project funding:\n\na. A financial interest consisting of one or more of the following interests of the Investigator (and those of the Investigator’s spouse/domestic partner and dependent children) that reasonably appears to be related to the Investigator’s institutional responsibilities:\n\n(i) With regard to any publicly traded entity, a Significant Financial Interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure and the value of any equity interest in the entity as of the date of disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000. For purposes of this definition, remuneration includes salary and any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary (e.g., consulting fees, honoraria, paid authorship); equity interest includes any stock, stock option, or other ownership interest, as determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value;\n\n(ii) With regard to any non-publicly traded entity, a Significant Financial Interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, or when the Investigator (or the Investigator’s spouse/domestic partner or dependent children) holds any equity interest (e.g., stock, stock option, or other ownership interest); or\n\n(iii) Intellectual property rights and interests (e.g., patents, copyrights), upon receipt of income related to such rights and interests.\n\nb. Investigators also must disclose the occurrence of any reimbursed or sponsored travel (i.e., that which is paid on behalf of the Investigator and not reimbursed to the Investigator so that the exact monetary value may not be readily available), related to their Institutional Responsibilities; provided, however, that this disclosure requirement does not apply to travel that is reimbursed or sponsored by a federal, state, or local government agency, an institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an institution of higher education.\n\nIn all cases, the term Significant Financial Interest does not include the following types of financial interests: salary, royalties, or other remuneration paid by AMNH to the Investigator if the Investigator is currently employed or otherwise appointed by AMNH, including intellectual property rights assigned to AMNH and agreements to share in royalties related to such rights; income from investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, as long as the Investigator does not directly control the investment decisions made in these vehicles; income from seminars, lectures, or teaching engagements sponsored by a federal, state, or local government agency, an institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an institution of higher education; or income from service on advisory committees or review panels for a federal, state, or local government agency, an institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an institution of higher education.\n\nInvestigator Responsibilities\n\nAll Investigators on proposed or funded federally supported projects are required to become familiar with the current AMNH policy and procedures for managing conflicts of interest (this document), and to distribute copies of the policy and procedures to all individuals who will participate as Investigators on the federally supported project.\n\nThe federal regulations require that Investigators submit to the AMNH Reviewing Official financial disclosures related to a federally supported project in advance of submission of the application to the agency. Specifically, an Investigator must disclose all Significant Financial Interests that would reasonably appear to be affected by the activities funded by the agency, or that are in entities whose financial interests would reasonably appear to be affected by such activities.\n\nTo comply with federal regulations, AMNH will require the following actions from Investigators on federally funded projects:\n\nAn Investigator with no Significant Financial Interest to disclose must so certify by signing the Proposal Certification Form in advance of proposal submission, or re-certify by signing the annual Financial Interest Disclosure Form.\n\nAn Investigator with Significant Financial Interests which may reasonably appear to affect the design, conduct or reporting of a federally funded project must submit a Financial Interest Disclosure Form to the AMNH Reviewing Official prior to proposal submission.\n\nWithin 30 days of discovering or acquiring a new reportable Significant Financial Interest, submission of a Financial Interest Disclosure Form to the AMNH Reviewing Official is required from all Investigators with current awards or pending applications for federally funded projects.\n\nCompletion of a Financial Interest Disclosure Form will be required at the beginning of the calendar year from all Investigators with current awards.\n\nAdditional Investigator Responsibilities under PHS-funded Projects\n\nPHS-funded Investigators will complete training on Financial Conflicts of Interest in advance of proposal submission or prior to engaging in research related to a PHS-funded project and at least every four years thereafter. Investigators may use the NIH online course at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coi/tutorial2011/fcoi.htm, or, subject to approval from the AMNH Reviewing Official, another institution’s training course. Information on the training requirement will be provided by the AMNH Reviewing Official.\n\nIn addition to the above-required disclosures, PHS-funded Investigators must disclose reimbursed or sponsored travel related to their Institutional Responsibilities, as defined above. The disclosure will include the purpose of the trip, the identity of the sponsor/organizer, the destination, and the duration. The AMNH Reviewing Official will determine if further information is needed, including a determination or disclosure of monetary value, in order to determine whether the travel constitutes a Significant Financial Interest with the PHS-funded project.\n\nAMNH Responsibilities\n\nThe Investigator will forward the Financial Interest Disclosure Form to the AMNH Reviewing Official, who will review it and confer with the responsible Senior Vice President as appropriate. Disclosures that in the opinion of the responsible Senior Vice President need the review of an ad hoc committee will be referred to a committee appointed by the Senior Vice President; composition of the committee will be determined by the Senior Vice President, and will typically include both scientists or educators and administrators. An Investigator who desires to have his/her own disclosure reviewed by the committee may so inform the AMNH Reviewing Official, for referral to the responsible Senior Vice President. Investigators may also elect to have the committee review other financial interests not related to federally sponsored project covered by this policy (in which case the portion of the policy regarding AMNH’s responsibility to report certain circumstances to the funding agency is not applicable). The committee will review disclosures referred to it and initiate steps to manage, reduce or eliminate potential conflicts in consultation with the responsible Senior Vice President. The information disclosed will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law.\n\nAdditional AMNH Responsibility for Retrospective Review of PHS-funded Projects\n\nIf AMNH determines that a financial conflict of interest was not identified or managed in a timely manner, including but not limited to an Investigator’s failure to disclose a Significant Financial Interest, or failure by the Investigator to materially comply with a management plan for a financial conflict of interest, the responsible Senior Vice President and/or their review committee will, within 120 days of a finding, complete a retrospective review of the Investigator’s activities and the PHS-funded project to determine whether the project conducted during the period of non-compliance was biased in the design, conduct or reporting. AMNH will document the review, develop a plan to manage any identified financial conflict of interest, and notify PHS as required.\n\nMethods to Manage Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe responsible Senior Vice President and/or their review committee is responsible for determining what mechanisms are appropriate for managing, reducing or eliminating real or potential conflicts of interest. Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage, reduce or eliminate conflicts of interest include:\n\nPublic disclosure of Significant Financial Interests;\n\nMonitoring of project activities by independent reviewers;\n\nModification of the project plan;\n\nDisqualification from participation in the portion of funded project that could be affected by the Significant Financial Interests;\n\nDivestiture of Significant Financial Interests; and/or\n\nSeverance of relationships that create actual or potential conflicts.\n\nEnforcement Mechanisms\n\nCertain federal regulations require that sanctions for non-compliance be imposed where necessary. Possible sanctions might include a letter of reprimand sent to the individual Investigator; a requirement for special certifications or assurances of compliance; restrictions on any grant awards involving the Investigator; barring the Investigator from submitting any new proposals through AMNH; suspension; dismissal, or other action as appropriate. These disciplinary sanctions are also referenced in the Museum’s Protocol for Responding to Allegations of Scientific Misconduct in Research.\n\nAgency Notifications\n\nAll federal funding agencies except for PHS: If a conflict of interest cannot be resolved on a federally-funded project, the appropriate agency official must be so notified. The responsible Senior Vice President will provide appropriate written notice to the agency.\n\nPHS: Prior to the expenditure of any funds under a PHS award or within 60 days of determination that a financial conflict of interest exists or annually during an award period to report on the status of an identified financial conflict of interest, the responsible Senior Vice President will report to PHS the finding of a conflicting interest and AMNH’s plan to manage the conflict. The report will contain all elements required under 42 CFR 50.605.\n\nRecord Retention\n\nThe AMNH Reviewing Official will maintain records of all financial disclosures and of all actions taken to resolve actual or potential conflicts of interest until at least 3 years after the later of the termination or completion date of the award to which they relate, or the resolution of any government action involving those records.\n\nPHS Subawards, Subcontracts and Collaborators\n\nFor all PHS-funded projects carried out through subgrantees, contractors or collaborators (e.g., those persons or institutions conducting a substantive portion of the PHS-funded project, who will design, conduct or report the results of the project, and who are accountable to AMNH for programmatic outcomes and compliance matters), AMNH will ensure that Investigators working for such entities comply with the applicable PHS regulations, either by requiring those Investigators to comply with the AMNH policy or by requiring the entities provide assurances of compliance with applicable PHS regulations.\n\nPublic Accessibility\n\nAMNH will post its Policy and Procedures on Financial Conflict of Interest Related to Federally Sponsored Projects on its public website at www.amnh.org. Requests for information on PHS-funded financial conflicts of interest must be directed to the Reviewing Official; responses to requests will be issued per the PHS regulations at 42 CFR Part 50 within five business days of receipt of the request.\n\nJanuary 2003\n\nUpdated April 2010; August 2012"
