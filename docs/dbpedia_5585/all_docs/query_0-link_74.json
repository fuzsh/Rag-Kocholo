        "text": "About ICOM NATHIST\n\nICOM NATHIST is the International Committee for Museums and Collections of Natural History of the International Council of Museums.\n\nThe Committee for Museums and Collections of Natural History (NATHIST) of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) comprises about 400 institutions and individuals across the world. NATHIST supports the collection, preservation, research and interpretation of diverse biological, paleontological and geological collections, the scientific study of the world’s natural heritage and natural environments, and the engagement of schools and the broader public in these and related subjects.\n\nMission\n\nNATHIST provides a point of contact and a forum for professional interaction for all those who work in nature and science focused museums with a responsibility for, or affinity with, natural history collections as well as those who work in institutions with related aims, including zoological and wildlife parks, botanical gardens, aquaria, nature centers, paleontological and geological sites, etc.\n\nActivities\n\nNATHIST holds an international annual conference in cooperation with innovative museum host venues focused on topical themes that feature special guest speakers, seminars, training series, workshops, and site visits.\n\nNATHIST members work are dedicated to improving best practice standards. In 2013, NATHIST produced the ICOM Code of Ethics for Natural History Museums which has now been translated into eight languages; in 2014, it produced the Taipei Statement on Museums and Conservation of Biodiversity; and in 2016, it launched a white paper on Natural History Museums and Wildlife Trafficking.\n\nNATHIST has championed a series of important publications, including Intangible Natural Heritage: New Perspectives on Natural Objects in 2012 and The Future of Natural History Museums in 2017. These spring from our annual conferences and feature the writing of our members.\n\nOften as predecessors to publications, several working groups have also been formed to advance the NATHIST goals, including Ethics ; Wildlife Trafficking; Taxidermy and, most recently, the Anthropocene.\n\nFrom time to time, NATHIST engages in the creation of an initiative that fosters greater understanding and capacity of the natural history museum field. Our most important current initiative is PLATFORM 2022, a project on natural history museums and sustainable development, managed by the National Taiwan Museum.\n\nThrough its website and newsletters, NATHIST disseminates important information to its members, industry personnel and other interested individuals. It is not necessary to be a NATHIST member to receive this free service.\n\nNATHIST maintains relationships with international organizations to partner on mutually beneficial initiatives. These include the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) and the Society for Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC).\n\nNATHIST offers student bursaries to ICOM triennial congresses and, when possible, to its annual conferences.\n\nPresident\n\nDorti WOLENITZ\n\nRead more\n\nVice President\n\nPhilippe GUILLET\n\nRead more\n\nSecretary\n\nFANG Hui-shih (Phaedra)\n\nRead more\n\nBOARD\n\nAnita HERMANNSTÄDTER\n\nRead more\n\nBoard\n\nCésar Augusto GRIBAUDO\n\nRead more\n\nBoard\n\nDr. Dacha ATIENZA\n\nRead more\n\nBoard\n\nHenry MCGHIE\n\nRead more\n\nBoard\n\nHUNG Shih-Yu\n\nRead more\n\nBoard\n\nDr. Juhi Sadiya\n\nRead more\n\nBoard\n\nDr. Nicolas Kramar\n\nRead more\n\nBoard\n\nSlavko SPASIĆ\n\nRead more\n\nBoard\n\nDr. YABE Atsushi\n\nRead more"
