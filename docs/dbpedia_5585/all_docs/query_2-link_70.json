Past the front doors, that cliff face morphs. It becomes an atrium in the guise of a towering canyon, a city block deep.\n\nFor its architects, Jeanne Gang and her team, Gilder was clearly a gamble and leap of faith, bucking today’s innocuous norms, almost begging for charges of starchitectural self-indulgence.\n\nNow that it’s built, I love it."
