The division carries out its mission through collections, research, exhibitions, publications, teaching and lectures, performances, broadcasts, and other presentations. The areas of focus for collections and programs are: music, dance, theater, film, broadcast media, sports, recreation, popular culture, home life, gender identity, life cycles, lifestyles and family structure, work, patterns of domestic production and consumption, standards of cleanliness and health, diverse forms of housing, modernization and the role of technology, invention, leisure, community institutions, religion, and education.\n\nOur collections represent the daily life of America’s diverse population from the 17th to the 21st century. The areas of focus for some collections and programs are music, dance, theater, film, broadcast media, sports, recreation, popular culture, photographic history, printing and the graphic arts. Additional subjects explored include home furnishings, food, clothing, domestic production, religion, community organizations, and patterns of migration and immigration. Childhood and the development of leisure time are examined, along with the roles technology and invention play in home and community life. The examination of these themes leads to a greater understanding of the American experience. The collections include ceramics and glass, textiles, domestic life, and costume, as well as the ethnic, education and religion collections.\n\nResearch Staff\n\nGonzalves, Theodore. Curator. B.S.

It focuses on political relationships between groups and interests; institutions of government; and changing practices of representative and participatory democracy in a nation of diverse people and cultures. The team is especially interested in changing definitions of citizenship and political rights; contested political ideologies; governmental policies and their impact; the role of political parties; elections; protest and reform movements; varied and changing expressions of nationalism; predictive opinion and media effects; and traditional political techniques and forms of communication.\n\nThe military history team collects the material culture of the American military experience from the French and Indian War to the contemporary War on Terrorism. Notable elements of the museum’s military collections include the Japanese American internment experience during WWII, and the September 11 attacks on the United States, women’s military history, and firearms technology. Collectively, the team works uses the materials and interprets these in relation to the country's social and cultural history. The division's collections, exhibitions, public programs, research, and writing put America's armed forces into historical context.\n\nUniforms, Accoutrements, and Insignia These collections contain uniforms, accoutrements, and insignia from the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Army Air Corps, and Coast Guard.

A majority of the collection deals with World War I military art.\n\nGunboat “Philadelphia” A warship used by the Continental forces under General Benedict Arnold in the battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776. The ship was burned and sunk in the battle and raised in 1935. It came to the Smithsonian in 1960.\n\nJapanese American Internment This collection explored a period when racial prejudice and fear upset the delicate balance between the rights of the citizen and the power of the state. The 200 plus objects tell the story of Japanese Americans before, during, and after their internment between the years 1942-1945.\n\nSeptember 11th Collection The division houses the bulk, but not all, of the Museum’s collections that relate to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
