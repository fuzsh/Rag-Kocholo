The museum grounds spread through the wings built between the 15th and 18th centuries, with each new corner sharing a piece of local history, from an old hospital ward to a convent.\n\nThe collection of tapestries, sculptures, and Flemish porcelain adds to the enticing preserved history of Lille. While small, the museumâs collections speak loudly by demonstrating a tangible sense of Lilleâs past and how it informed the present.\n\nA France tour unveils the beauty of the past and the unforgettable style of contemporary culture.
