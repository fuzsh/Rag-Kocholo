        "text": "Product Description\n\nWith more than 124 million specimens, the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History houses one of the world's most important collections of natural history artifacts. This lavishly illustrated guidebook offers a beautiful tour and souvenir of the exciting collections.\n\nStarting with the history of the museum and a peek behind the scenes, readers then enter the museum through the Rotunda, where they are greeted by the famous elephant diorama—the world's largest mounted specimen of this enormous mammal. The tour continues into the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals, home to the legendary Hope Diamond. The Fossils section traces the history of life on earth, from the earliest organisms to the great diversity of plants and animals in the modern world. Biology features living species, including the incredible array of furry creatures in the brand new Kenneth E. Behring Family Hall of Mammals. The Anthropology section examines human evolution, exploring cultures from all over the globe. The book's final section is devoted to experiences beyond the museum galleries—the IMAX theater, Jazz Café, and naturalist center in Leesburg, Virginia, where visitors get hands-on experience doing scientific research. This sturdy, flexibound guide also includes phone numbers, directions, hours, and all the other essential information needed to ensure a rewarding visit."
