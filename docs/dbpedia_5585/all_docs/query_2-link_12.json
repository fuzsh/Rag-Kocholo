        "text": "Some of the world’s most famous museums, such as the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay, are in Paris. But there are many other French regions that are worth visiting, and plenty of museums you may like to explore, depending on your interests.\n\nWe don’t like to recommend visiting too many museums in one trip, as we think you get a more immersive and authentic experience of present-day French culture by exploring outside and interacting with the locals (you’ll get plenty of opportunities to do this on one of our self-drive France itineraries!).\n\nHowever, a museum is always a good option if the weather is bad or if you have a particular interest in a period in history or a specific style of art, for example, and would like to see some original pieces or artifacts. We’ve listed some of our favorite museums in this post. We hope you’ll find it useful!\n\nWe've included museums in the following regions, in case you would like to scroll down to the region you're interested in:\n\nLyon\n\nFrench Riviera\n\nProvence\n\nBasque Country\n\nLoire Valley\n\nDordogne\n\nBurgundy\n\nBrittany\n\nNormandy\n\nAlsace\n\nLille\n\nBordeaux\n\nChampagne\n\nVerdun\n\nSomme\n\nThe Best Museums in Lyon\n\nFamous around the world for its gastronomy and its fascinating architecture, these are some of the museums you may like to visit in Lyon, France’s third largest city after Paris and Marseille.\n\nInternational City of Gastronomy, Lyon\n\nIf you’re a gourmet like we are at France Just For You, you shouldn’t miss Lyon's International City of Gastronomy (Cité Internationale de la Gastronomie de Lyon). This museum is dedicated to food and wine, with plenty of interactive exhibits and opportunities for tastings during your visit.\n\nYou’ll learn about the culinary traditions that are particular to Lyon, and how these have influenced French cuisine in general. The on-site restaurant showcases some of Lyon’s most famous food products and dishes, so you may like to stop for something to eat there.\n\nMusée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon\n\nThe Fine Arts museum in Lyon includes more than 70,000 works of art by artists such as Monet and Rembrandt - a must for art-lovers.\n\nMusée des Confluences\n\nWe think you’ll be fascinated by the impressive modern architecture of this museum, which explores the history of nature, science and societies. Exhibits range from prehistoric fossils to items of modern-day technology, so the Musée des Confluences may be interesting to those with diverse interests.\n\nWe’ll customize our Lyon Tours to suit your interests and preferences.\n\nThe Picasso Museum, Antibes\n\nThe Picasso Museum is housed in a beautiful 14th-century castle in Antibes, where visitors can appreciate over 200 pieces of art that show how his style evolved during his career. Bring a picnic or some snacks if the weather’s good so you can enjoy the garden and its stunning sea views after exploring the museum.\n\nMarc Chagall National Museum, Nice\n\nShowcasing the work of Russian-born French painter Marc Chagall, you’ll be able to walk around this small museum in about an hour. The permanent collection includes 17 large gorgeous canvas paintings depicting scenes from the Bible. Visitors may also visit the garden and the concert hall hosts regular classical music concerts.\n\nMusée d'Art Moderne et d'Art Contemporain (MAMAC), Nice\n\nIf you’re in Nice, lovers of modern art will enjoy exploring the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. There are more than 1,300 pieces of art spanning the 20th and 21st centuries. It’s a great way to spend half a day - make sure you check out the views from the roof terrace!\n\nThe MAMAC will be temporarily closed for an extended period from January 7th, 2024 for major renovation work. Check the MAMAC’s website for the latest updates.\n\nWe’ll customize any of our self-drive tours in the French Riviera based on your preferences.\n\nThe Pope's Palace, Avignon\n\nThis French UNESCO World Heritage Site dates back to the 14th century, when it was the seat of the Catholic Church. Now, the Pope’s Palace is a museum focusing on the history and architecture of the palace. There are beautiful frescoes to see and inside you’ll see tapestries decorating the palace's halls and rooms.\n\nCézanne's studio, Aix-en-Provence\n\nArt lovers will be fascinated by a visit to Paul Cezanne's studio in Aix-en-Provence, where he worked for many years. Nowadays it is a museum that shows the studio as it would have been during his lifetime. You can see some of Cézanne's personal belongings, unfinished works, and the lovely garden that featured in many of his paintings.\n\nMUCEM, Marseille\n\nThe Museum of Civilizations of Europe and the Mediterranean showcases the history and cultures of this region.\n\nThere are over a million works of art and artifacts spanning from prehistory to the present day. You can also see exhibits on current-day migration and the environment.\n\nIf you’re in Marseille, it’s worth strolling over to the MUCEM just to see its impressive modern architecture, inspired by traditional Mediterranean architecture. The lattice-like concrete shell wraps around the museum and provides shade and ventilation while evoking the latticed screens that are typical of the region.\n\nThe large footbridge connects it to Fort Saint-Jean, which dates back to the 17th century and now also houses part of the museum's collection.\n\nThe Lavender Museum, Luberon\n\nIf you’re in Provence between April 1st and December 23rd, the family-owned Lavender Museum is just a 35-minute drive from the city of Avignon. It’s only a very small museum, so possibly not worth making the journey especially, but it’s a nice place to stop off if you’re passing by on your way to somewhere else.\n\nHere you can learn about Lavender’s history from the 16th century to the present day. You can also learn about its botany, cultivation and the machines and processes used to distill it to make various lavender products. Many of these products are available to buy in their shop.\n\nIf you book one of our Provence tours, we’ll share with you our favorite places to buy authentic locally-produced lavender products!\n\nMusée Basque, Bayonne\n\nThe Basque Museum in Bayonne will give you an introduction to the history and culture of the Basque Country. It has a collection of more than 2,000 objects showcasing the Basque region's traditions, art, and folklore. There’s also a collection of traditional Basque costumes, an exhibit about the history of whaling in the Basque Country, and you can even have a go at playing pelote, the Basque sport.\n\nEspace Chemins-Bideak, Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port\n\nIn you’re interested in learning about the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route, which traverses the Basque Country, this is the museum to visit. There are exhibits about the history of the pilgrimage, Basque traditions and customs, and the art and architecture of the region. People also visit the museum to learn more about the different pilgrimage routes along the Camino de Santiago as they plan their own pilgrimage.\n\nMusée de la Mer, Biarritz\n\nThe Biarritz Aquarium and Museum hosts over 150 species of marine life. You’ll also discover the history of fishing, the biology of the ocean, and surfing, a popular water-sport in Biarritz, which attracts surfers from all over the world. Find out more in our post about the best things to do in Biarritz.\n\nIn our Basque Country tours, we will immerse you in beautiful landscapes and fascinating culture of this part of France.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts, Tours\n\nThe Musée des Beaux-Arts de Tours is contained within a beautiful 18th-century mansion. Its collection of more than 12,000 works of art, include paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts by artists such as Degas, Delacroix and Rubens.\n\nMusée de la Vigne et du Vin, Anjou\n\nThis is the place to learn about the history and culture of winemaking in the Loire Valley. You’ll find exhibits on the different types of wine produced in the region, the history of viticulture, and learn about different winemaking techniques. If you attend one of their wine-tasting sessions, you’ll be able to sample some of the local wines.\n\nHowever, if you book a tour of the Loire Valley with us, we will arrange for you to have a special and memorable wine-tasting experience with an expert wine guide!\n\nOur Loire Valley tours will take you to our favorite vineyards and castles of the Loire Valley!\n\nLascaux IV, Montignac\n\nThis is a replica of the original Lascaux cave, which was discovered by four local teenage boys in 1940 and is home to some of the most striking and well-preserved prehistoric monochrome cave paintings in the world.\n\nThousands of visitors explored the original cave in the decades that it was open to the public. Eventually though, it had to be closed due to the damaging effect that the humidity from so many visitors was having on the paintings.\n\nAnd so a replica cave, Lascaux IV was created so that visitors today can continue to get a sense of the magnitude and beauty of the cave paintings. Experts used the latest technology and techniques to recreate a realistic experience of how the cave would have been when it was inhabited around 17,000 years ago. As well as replica paintings of bison and wooly mammoths, they have recreated the conditions and smells within the cave too. The museum teaches you about the culture of our prehistoric ancestors who created them.\n\nMusée National de Préhistoire, Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil\n\nAnother museum focusing on the prehistoric period of the Dordogne region, if you have time you may like to visit this museum after visiting prehistoric caves to help put what you’ve seen into context.\n\nAt the National Museum of Prehistory you may learn about the evolution of humanity, how prehistoric people lived, and how their art and culture evolved across different periods. You can also see some prehistoric tools and weapons, and replicas of some of Dordogne’s prehistoric sites.\n\nMusée de la Truffe, Sarlat\n\nIf you’re driving through Dordogne, a visit to the beautiful medieval town of Sarlat is a must! If you have some extra time, the Truffle Museum will give you an introduction to the history and practice of truffle-hunting in the region, with a small tasting experience at the end. You might enjoy this if you’re a gourmet with a particular taste for truffles!\n\nAnd in that case, we would also recommend going on a truffle-hunting experience in this region - we can arrange this for you if you book one of our Dordogne self-drive tours. You’ll go on a hunt with specially-trained dogs and expert truffle-hunters, and then have an excellent truffle-tasting experience at the end!\n\nYou can discover these museums, delve into prehistoric caves, admire gorgeous landscapes, visit centuries-old castles and enjoy a truffle hunt on a custom Dordogne self-drive tour with France Just For You!\n\nThe Medieval Hospices, Beaune\n\nThis stunning 15th-century building has exhibits on the history of the hospices in Beaune and the care of the sick and dying in medieval times. You can also see some of the hospital's original furnishings and artefacts and admire the building’s impressive Gothic architecture.\n\nOur tours of Burgundy, France will take you to the finest wineries, the best restaurants and the most interesting historical places (that most tourists don't know about!)\n\nThe International City of Gastronomy and Wine, Dijon\n\nThe Cité Internationale de la Gastronomie et du Vin in Dijon has exhibits on the history of food and viticulture in Burgundy. You may also be interested in the cooking and winemaking workshops, and of course you must take the opportunity to try some of the local wines and cuisine on offer.\n\nMusée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon\n\nOne of France’s oldest fine art museums, the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Dijon is housed in a 15th century former Dukes’ palace. Among the 13,000 pieces of art spanning the 14th and 19th centuries are masterpieces by Rubens, Titian, and Veronese.\n\nThe Bayeux Tapestry Museum, Bayeux\n\nThe Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux is home to the most famous tapestry in the world. An 11th-century historical record, the Bayeux Tapestry tells the story of the 1066 Norman Conquest of England.\n\nPlease note that the museum is scheduled to close for refurbishment for about two years from late 2024. Restoration work on the tapestry will also be carried out during this period. It is then expected that the Bayeux Tapestry will be on loan to the UK during the rest of the museum’s refurbishment.\n\nThe D-Day Museum - Musée du Débarquement, Arromanches\n\nWe think you’ll find the D-Day Museum in Arromanches-les-Bains interesting if you like learning about the history of the second world war. There are exhibits on the Normandy landings, including film footage, models and artifacts.\n\nCaen Memorial, Caen\n\nThe city of Caen suffered extensive damage during the bombings of World War II. The Mémorial de Caen is both a war memorial and a history museum. You can learn about the causes of the war, find out about the events of the Battle of Normandy, and the Cold War.\n\nIf you book one of our Normandy tours and you tell us you’d like to visit some of the key WWII sites, we’ll arrange for a WWII expert to guide you around the most important places of interest. They will recount the events that happened at each place, and if you have a relative who was killed in action in the Battle of Normandy, they will research where their grave is located so you may visit it and pay your respects during your trip.\n\nMusée Eugène Boudin, Honfleur\n\nEugène Boudin was a famous painter from Normandy, known for his landscape and seascape paintings of the region. He was also a mentor of Impressionist Claude Monet and other landscape painters. In the Eugène Boudin Museum you’ll see the artist’s work, and some of the art of those he mentored and inspired.\n\nIf you like the idea of a self guided driving tour of Normandy where all the planning is taken care of by experts, contact us!\n\nMusée d'Unterlinden, Colmar\n\nThis 13th-century Dominican convent and former public bath is now the Unterlinden Museum, the most visited museum in Alsace. It has more than 700 paintings, sculptures, and other works of art, including pieces by Picasso and Monet, and the Isenheim Altarpiece by the German Renaissance painter Matthias Grünewald.\n\nAlsatian Museum, Strasbourg\n\nLearn more about the culture and history of Alsace at the Musée Alsacien in Strasbourg.

Once we know your interests and preferences, we'll be able to craft a tour of eastern France, just for you!\n\nMusée de la Reddition, Reims\n\nIt was in this building that World War II officially ended. In the early hours of May 7th, 1945, the Germans signed the declaration of unconditional surrender. The building was a school and was used as General Eisenhower’s HQ. It’s still a school today - the Lycée Roosevelt - and the room where the surrender was signed is now the Museum of the Surrender.\n\nThere’s a short documentary film when you go in which explains the significance of this building and the events that took place here. Then you can visit the map room, which has been kept exactly as it was at the time of the surrender. There are also exhibits of war souvenirs, uniforms, artifacts and press reports from the time.\n\nIf you’re interested in World War history, a visit to the Musée de la Reddition is a must while you’re in Reims. It is quite small so you won’t need longer than an hour to take in the rooms and the exhibits.\n\nVerdun Memorial\n\nThe Mémorial de Verdun museum is an absolute must-see if you’re interested in WWI history. It helps visitors better understand what happened during the important but devastating Battle of Verdun, giving the history from both the German and French sides.\n\nFleury-devant-Douaumont\n\nYou might think of Fleury-devant-Douaumont as a kind of memorial or open-air museum that pays homage to the villagers that once lived there. The village was very close to the Verdun battlefield and was completely destroyed by German artillery during World War I.\n\nNowadays what remains are signs indicating where different landmarks once stood in the village: the school, the church, the local store… and paths that weave in and out of bumpy land and trees. Walking through this area is quite a sobering experience and interesting to combine with a visit to the Verdun Memorial.\n\nIf you book one of our World War 1 Battlefields tours, we will arrange for an expert WWI guide to give you a private tour of the key Verdun battle sites, including the Verdun Memorial and Fleury-devant-Douaumont.\n\nThe Thiepval Museum\n\nAbout a 40-minute drive from Amiens is the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme. The small museum helps you learn more about the history and consequences of the battle, including an incredible panoramic mural by Joe Sacco depicting the battle of July 1st, 1916.\n\nThe facts and images you’ll see in the museum along with the size of the memorial monument covered with the names of the fallen will give you a real sense of the vast scale of the battle and the numbers who perished.\n\nDelville Wood South African National War Memorial\n\nTen minutes’ drive from Thiepval is the Delville Wood War Memorial, dedicated to South Africans who fought in the Battle of the Somme. In addition to the memorial and the war cemetery, the museum has information and artifacts relating to the South African troops and their participation in the battle.

This museum commemorates the experiences, contributions and sacrifices made by the Australian troops during World War 1.\n\nIf you visit the memorial during opening hours you’ll be able to climb to the top for a view over the cemetery.\n\nSomme 1916 Museum, Albert\n\nThe Somme 1916 museum is set in underground tunnels in the town of Albert, and explores the experience of WWI soldiers through guided tours, many artifacts, recreated war scenes and mannequins of soldiers. Definitely worth a visit if you’re passing through Albert.\n\nJules Verne House, Amiens\n\nIf you’re a fan of Jules Verne - who wrote classics such as Around the World in 80 days and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea - we think you’ll enjoy visiting Jules Verne House in Amiens, where he lived and wrote for 18 years.\n\nIn the house, you can learn about how history, science and geography inspired his books. In one room there’s a huge map that shows the 80-day journey around the world that features in one of his most famous novels.\n\nThe library contains around 12,000 books, which Jules Verne consulted while he was researching and writing his novels. There’s also a section dedicated to movies that were inspired by his novels, with original movie posters.\n\nEven if you haven’t read any of Jules Verne’s books, you might find that a visit to his house inspires you to read one!"
