It emerged as a separate state when lateral branches of the house of Jin æ extinguished the main branch and divided its territory into three, namely Wei, Han é and Zhao è¶. Wei played an important role during the Warring States period æ°å (5th cent.-221 BCE) as one of the large regional states fighting against the state of Qin ç§¦. The territory of Wei covered part of modern Shanxi province (called Hedong æ²³æ±, Hequ æ²³æ²) and the southeastern parts of Shaanxi (called Hexi æ²³è¥¿). The first capital was Huo é (modern Huoxian éç¸£, Shanxi), later Anyi å®é (modern Xiaxian å¤ç¸£, Shanxi). Wei later expanded to the east and covered the western parts of the modern province of Shandong and the northern and western central of Henan (called Henei æ²³å ).\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Wei é­ (403 - 230 BCE)\n\nMap according to Tan Qixiang è°­å ¶éª§ (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji ä¸­å½åå²å°å¾é. Wei was located in the centre of Zhou-period China and was thus exposed to pressure from all sides. In addition to that, its territory was dispersed over a large area difficult to control. It nevertheless survived for relatively long before it was conquered by the expanding kingdom of Qin. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe ruling house of Wei was founded by Ji Gao å§¬é«, Duke of Bi ç¢ (Gao, Duke of Bi ç¢å ¬é«), a son of King Wen å¨æç, the founder of the Zhou dynasty. When King Wen's son, King Wu å¨æ­¦ç, destroyed the Shang dynasty å (17th-11th cent. BCE) , Ji Gao was made regional ruler of Bi (close to modern Chang'an é·å®, Shaanxi) and was granted to use Bi as his family name. His descendants lost their noble status.\n\nOne descendant was called Bi Wan ç¢è¬. He served Duke Xian of Jin æç»å ¬ (r. 677-651) and participated with Zhao Su è¶å¤, ancestor of the house of Zhao, in the campaign against the lords of the statelets of Huo é, Geng è¿ and Wei é­. For his merits Wan Bi was given the territory of Wei and was allowed to bear the title of grand master (dafu å¤§å¤«). A diviner prognosticated to him a brilliant future. After the death of Duke Xian, Bi Wan adopted the family name Wei. His son, who is known as Viscount Wu of Wei é­æ­¦å­, served Prince Chong'er éè³ (the eventual Duke Wen of Jin ææå ¬, r. 637-628) of Jin and accompanied the latter during his long years in exile.\n\nHis grandson Wei Jiang é­çµ³ (posthumous title Viscount Zhao of Wei é­æ­å­) was appointed chief minister of Duke Dao of Jin ææ¼å ¬ (r. 573-558) and was able to pacify the Rong æ and Di ç¿ tribes. Wei Jiang moved his seat to Anyi å®é. Viscount Wei's grandson Wei Ying é­å¬´ (posthumous title Viscount Xian é­ç»å­) was one of the six ministers-commander (liuqing å ­å¿) appointed by Duke Zhao of Jin ææ­å ¬ (r. 532-526). He was chief minister of Duke Qing of Jin æé å ¬ (r. 526-512) and participated in the annihilation of the noble houses of Qi ç¥ and Yangshe ç¾è.\n\nViscount Wei was succeeded by his son Wei Chi é­ä¾, who is known as Viscount Xiang é­è¥å­. He allied with Zhao Yang è¶é (Zhao Jianzi è¶ç°¡å­) and attacked the houses of Fan è and Zhonghang ä¸­è¡ who also belonged to the six ministers-commander. His son and successor Viscount Huan é­æ¡å­ (Wei Ju é­é§) sided with Viscount Kang of Han éåº·å­ and Viscount Xiang of Zhao è¶è¥å­ to kill Zhi Yao æºç¤, the Earl of Zhi ç¥ä¼¯. From 453 on, there were only three ministers commander left that became ever stronger and threatened the ducal house of Jin.\n\nUnder the rule of Marquis Wen of Wei é­æä¾¯ (r. 424-387, marquis since 403), war erupted with the state of Qin in the west and Zheng é­ in the east. Wei therefore began erecting fortification walls along critical parts of its border. Marquis Wen was open to education and was instructed by disciples of Confucius å­å­ like Zixia å­å¤, Tian Zifang ç°å­æ¹ and Duangan Mu æ®µå¹²æ¨, yet he was also advised by the legalist thinker Li Kui ææ and by Di Huang ç¿ç and his own younger brother Wei Cheng é­æ, who is known posthumously as Wei Chengzi é­æå­. General Yue Yang æ¨ç¾ commanded the successful campaign against the semi-barbarian state of Zhongshan ä¸­å±±. The famous military strategist Wu Qi å³èµ·, author of the book Wuzi å³å­, was governor (taishou å¤ªå®) of the commandery of Hexi, Ximen Bao è¥¿éè±¹ magistrate of Ye é´, and Qu Hou Fu å±ä¾¯é®, was mentor (fu å ) of Wei.\n\nMost important are probably the reforms by Li Kui, who introduced household registers and a new tax system to increase government revenues. His lost book Fajing æ³ç¶ \"The Book of Standards (Laws)\" was the oldest legalist treatise. Between 413 and 409, Wei conquered several towns owned by the state of Qin and repelled this western state to the western banks of the River Luo æ´æ°´. It 408, Wei waged a campaign against Zhongshan. From 405 to 401, an alliance (meng ç) of Zhao, Wei and Han was able to occupy the outskirts of the state of Qi. The three states also defeated Chu æ¥ two times, namely in 400, and 391. Wei became one of the strongest states of these decades. Yet Qin would be able to regain its former strength and then gradually encroached on the territory of Hexi.\n\nMarquis Wen was succeeded by his son Prince Ji æ, who is known as Marquis Wu é­æ­¦ä¾¯ (r. 387-371). At the beginning of his reign, the throne succession crisis in Zhao caused Marquis Wu to side with Prince Shuo æ, who instigated Wei to attack the capital of Zhao, Handan é¯é², yet the troops of Wei were defeated. War with Qi continued. In 376, the states of Zhao, Han and Wei divided the territory of their former lord, the dynasty of Jin, among themselves. Marquis Wu was at that time so powerful that he even dared attacking the state of Chu in the south, and conquered the town of Luyang é­¯é½. Marquis Wu was succeeded by his son Prince Ying ç½, who is known as King Hui of Wei é­æ ç (r. 371-335, the title of king was adopted in 344).\n\nYet Prince Ying had to defend the right of succession against Prince Gongzhong Huan å ¬ä¸­ç·© (also called Gongzi Huan å ¬å­ç·©). Prince Gongsun Xin å ¬å­«é  tried to solve the question by involving Marquis Yi of Han éæ¿ä¾¯ (r. 371-359) into the conflict who joined with Marquis Cheng of Zhao è¶æä¾¯ (r. 375-350) to destroy the state of Wei. In the battle of Zhuoze æ¿æ¾¤, the troops of Wei were defeated. The survival of the state of Wei was only possible because of a quarrel between Zhao and Han which deliberated whether to divide up Wei as a whole or to claim just some territory from it. A year later, the marquis of Wei was even able to beat the troops of Han at Maling é¦¬éµ and those of Zhao at Huai æ·. In 362, Wei was defeated by Qin in the battle of Shaoliang å°æ¢, and the general of Wei, Prince Gongsun Cuo å ¬å­«ç¤, was captured.\n\nIn 354, the troops of Wei besieged Handan, capital of Zhao. Zhao therefore sent for help to the state of Qi, whose troops defeated Wei at Guiling æ¡éµ. A further attack by various regional rulers (zhuhou è«¸ä¾¯) caused the marquis of Wei to build a fortification wall. The game was repeated in 341, and Qi this time used the famous general Sunzi å­«å­ (i.e. Sun Bin å­«è) to defend the ally Zhao. Wei entrusted the army to general Pang Juan é¾æ¶ and Prince Shen ç³, yet their troops were defeated at Maling; the Prince was captured and Pang Juan died. This defeat offered the chance for Qin, Zhao and Qi to jointly attack Wei. The armies were commanded by Shang Yang åé , the legalist reformer of Qin. Prince Gongzi Ang å ¬å­å¬ of Wei was defeated. The marquis of Wei thereupon decided to move the capital to Daliang å¤§æ¢ that was not as closely located to the border of Qin as the original capital Anyi.\n\nThe move to Daliang was the reason why King Hui of Wei is also known as King Hui of Liang. In his new position as a king, King Hui assembled the regional rulers at Fengze é¢æ¾¤ and ordered them to pay homage to the old and venerated house of the kings of Zhou. He can therefore be seen as the last hegemonial lord of the Zhou period. Prince Gongzi He å ¬å­èµ« was made Heir Apparent of Wei, to make good for the loss of Prince Shen. When Duke Xiao of Qin ç§¦å­å ¬ (r. 362-338) died, Shang Yang tried to escape to Wei, but the borders were closed, so that Shang Yang was eventually arrested and was executed by the new ruler of Qin.\n\nKing Hui of Liang is known as a patron of scholars and philosophers. He hosted the Yin-Yang é°é½ thinker Zou Yan éè¡, the coalition advisor Chunyu Kun æ·³äºé«¡, and, most important, the Confucian philosopher Meng Ke å­è»» (Mengzi å­å­). The most famous discussion between Mengzi and King Hui was about \"profit\" (li å©) that the King interpreted militarily and financially, while Mengzi argued that the \"profit\" to be aspired for by a ruler was nothing else than a people made happy by royal humankindness (ren ä») and righteousness (yi ç¾©)\n\nKing Hui was succeeded by Prince Si å£, who is known as King Xiang é­è¥ç (r. 335-319). It might be that King Xiang was the first ruler of Wei who adopted the title of king, while King Hui is only called so posthumously. The downward trend of the power of Wei had begun in the second battle at Maling in which Qi defeated the troops of Wei. After the battle at Diaoyin éé° (also written å½«é°) with Qin, Wei had to give up the territory of Hexi, which opened to Qin the corridor to the Yellow River plain. In the next years the territories of Jiao ç¦ and Quwo æ²æ² several times changed the owner, often depending on coalitions. In 329, Wei attacked Chu and defeated its troops at Xingshan éå±±. Six years later, Chu triumphed after the battle of Xiangling è¥éµ. The famous coalition advisor Zhang Yi å¼µå, formerly counsellor of Qin, was for a short time counsellor of Wei. He returned to Qin when King Xiang died and was succeeded by King Ai é­åç (r. 319-296).\n\nA joint attack of the five states of Wei, Zhao, Han, Yan and Chu against Qin which had been initiated by counsellor Gongsun Yan å ¬å­«è¡ failed, and in return Qin sent out Prince Chulizi æ¨éå­ (Chuli Ji æ¨éç¾), who conquered Quwo. In 311, when the armies of Wei é­ threatened to destroy the state of Wei è¡, grand master Ru'er å¦è³ and the Lord of Changling æéµå pursued King Ai not to conquer this ancient state. Wei often changed sides and sometimes fought at the side of Qin against Chu, and sometimes on the side of Qi and Han against Qin.\n\nKing Ai was succeeded by King Zhao é­æ­ç (r. 296-277). Under his reign Qin grew stronger and stonger. It occupied a large tract of land of Wei east of the great Yellow River bend. A force of the allies Qi, Han and Wei was able to enter the Hangu Pass å½è°·é and repelled Qin to the west, yet in 293, Qin defeated Wei and Han at Yique ä¼é. Three years later, Wei had to cede to Qin a large part of the region of Hedong. The coalition advisors Su Qin èç§¦ and Li Dui æå  created a joint army of troops from Zhao, Qi, Chu, Wei and Han which planned to attack Qin, yet the army dissolved at Chenggao æç, and Wei soon lost the town of Anyi again. In 286, Wei participated in the coalition against the state of Qi in the east that was almost wholly occupied by inimical forces. Two times, in 283 and in 275, the troops of Qin advanced into the vicinity of Daliang, and the only chance to have them withdrawn was to offer the town of Wen æº« to Qin.\n\nKing Zhao's successor was his son King Anxi é­å®éç (r. 277-243). Facing the loss of more and more towns to Qin, King Anxi requested the help of the coalition advisor Su Dai èä»£, a brother of Su Qin. Su Dai suggested that it was not the correct method to pacify Qin by granting land. In 273, Qin defeated Zhao and Han in the battle of Huayang è¯é½ and executed 150,000 prisoners of war. The siege of Daliang could only be avoided by offering the town of Nanyang åé½.\n\nWhen Qi and Chu attacked Wei, the king of Qin refused to send help. Tang Ju åé therefore offered traveling to Qin to pursue the ruler of Qin to support Wei because the territory of Wei was an important shield for Qin against the states of Qi and Chu. King Anxi later decided to ask the king of Qin for support in a campaign against of the state of Han, yet Lord Xinling ä¿¡éµå warned him to trust a king with the \"heart of a tiger or a wolf\" (hu lang zhi xin èç¼ä¹å¿). The ever-active state of Qin (fei wu shi zhi guo éç¡äºä¹å) was preying on Wei because Wei was for Qin to conquer easiest of all regional states.\n\nLord Xinling thereupon took over command over the army of five allies against Qin, found a willing supporter in Lord Chunshen æ¥ç³å of Chu, and was able to force the Qin general Meng Ao èé© to give up the siege of Handan, capital of Zhao. The king of Qin thereupon threw Prince Ceng å¢, the Heir Apparent of Wei, who dwelled in Qin as a hostage, into jail, but he was pursued not to kill him. In 254, Wei conquered the old state of Wei è¡.\n\nIn 243, Prince Ceng succeeded to the throne. He is known as King Jingmin é­æ¯æ¹£ç (r. 243-228). During his reign, Qin occupied more and more towns of Wei. The last ruler of Wei was King Jia å (r. 228-225), who was not given a posthumous title because already in his third reign year the troops of Qin under general Wang Ben çè³ inundated the capital Daliang and captured King Jia. Wei was transformed into a commandery of the empire of Qin.\n\nThe name of Wei that had dominated the south of modern Shanxi province was later not only used for imperial princedoms, but for several mighty empires that dominated north China, like the Cao-Wei Dynasty æ¹é­ of the Three Empires (Sanguo) ä¸å and the Northern Wei (Beiwei) åé­ empire of the Tuoba æè·.\n\nTable 1.
