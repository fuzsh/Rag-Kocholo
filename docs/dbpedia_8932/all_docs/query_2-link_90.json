It is definitely worth taking a closer look.There is also a historical play that reflects the culture of the palace.\n\nKaifeng Mansion: The Government Offices of the Northern Song Dynasty Officials, The Offices of the Successive Generations of Prefecture Governors\n\nKaifeng Mansion was the first capital of the Northern Song Dynasty. The successive generations of prefecture governors worked and judged trials here.The Kaifeng Mansion scenery was also rebuilt, basically recreating the original installation of that era.Here, you can see past scenes of government offices, and wax sculptures of Lord Bao judging trials.Inside the prison cell, you can see a multitude of ancient tools used for torture.In addition, there is also a biography that introduces the successive generations of prefecture governors.\n\nMillennium City Park: Marketplace Culture of the Northern Song Dynasty\n\nThe famous Song Dynasty painting “Along the River During the Qingming Festival” painted by Zhang Zeduan is the blueprint for the bustling street scene of the Northern Song Dynasty in the Millennium City Park.You can see many famous buildings of Northern Song Dynasty architecture, as well as restaurants, teahouses and other living facilities. The staff are all dressed up in Song Dynasty costumes, which will take you back to the Song Dynasty with them.Read “The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor”, it is a well-known book about Kaifeng's marketplace culture, detailing the prosperity of that era.“The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor” in Millennium City Park is a large-scale live water performance that is performed every night. The historical reproduction of the Northern Song Dynasty painting “Along the River During the Qingming Festival” and “A Dream of Splendor” is illustrated through classic Song poetry and their artistic conception.\n\nMemorial Temple of Lord Bao: Reputable Official of the Northern Song Dynasty, Bao Zheng’s Ancestral Shrine\n\nLord Bao is a reputable official of the Northern Song Dynasty. He was renowned for his just and fair reputation.The Memorial Temple of Lord Bao was relocated in the 1980s and houses a three-meter-tall bronze statue of Lord Bao. It also contains Lord Bao’s biography, legends and historical relics.However, many of these artifacts are replicas, and the original artifacts have been transferred to the museum.\n\nYang Warrior Memorial Museum: The Manor of Yang Ye, A FamousGeneral of the Northern Song Dynasty\n\nYang Ye is one of the most famous generals in the Northern Song Dynasty, and stories of the Generals of the Yang family are also widely celebrated.The Yang Warrior Memorial Museum is the restoration of Yang Ye’s manor, which comprises government offices, gardens and military training grounds.There are many sculptural monuments of classic events, such as Yang Ye’s dispatch of troops to You Prefecture to rescue the Emperor, the selection of Yang Family generals by She Saihua (Dowager She) etc., and many other performances that portray past events.The true story of the “Generals of the Yang Family” has been told in many ways, some even fabricated, as it has been adapted into several films and television programs.Although the entire Yang family consists of loyal and courageous warriors, the only confirmed Generals of the Yang Family are Yang Ye, his son, Yang Yanzhao and his grandson, Yang Wenguang.Yang Yanzhao is known as Yang Liulang (Liulang means “sixth son” in Chinese) because the Liao Dynasty considered the Liulang Star their nemesis, but that does not mean that he was the sixth son.\n\nYue Fei Temple: A Reputable General Who Fought Against the Jins’in the Song Dynasty\n\nYue Fei Temple is located in the suburb of Xiangfu District, Chengjiao Township in Zhuxian Town, where Yue Fei led the army to gain a landslide victory against Jin Wuzhu.The renowned statues depicting “Five Traitors Kneeling to the Loyal One” can be found here, and the stelas of “Dao Ziya Zhang's Northern Expedition” and “The River Runs Red” are worth a visit.Who exactly are the people featured in the “Five Traitors Kneeling to the Loyal One”? In the center of the statues depicting “Five Traitors Kneeling to the Loyal One”, is the notorious Qin Hui.The woman next to Qin Hui is his wife, Wang Shi.Beside Wang Shi, is Qin Hui’s advisor, named Luo Ruji. On the other side of Qin Hui is Zhang Jun, who surrendered to Qin Hui despite still being in the army.The statue farthest to the side is Moqi Xie, the Official of Court of Judicial Review. He was incredibly cruel to Yue Fei and others, and was Qin Hui’s henchman.\n\nDaxiangguo Temple: Imperial Temple of the Northern Song Dynasty\n\nIf you are familiar with the “Water Margin”, you might remember that Lu Zhishen was the one who guarded the vegetable garden at the Daxiangguo Temple and uprooted a willow.Daxiangguo Temple was first built in the Northern Qi Dynasty, but was at the peak of prosperity during Northern Song Dynasty and became the Imperial Temple at the time.You can visit the buildings, which have been largely rebuilt in recent years, and only a few historic sites and a statue of Lu Zhishen in the courtyard that remain.\n\nSongduyu Street: Replica of Song Dynasty’s Commercial Street\n\nThe Imperial Street in the Northern Song Dynasty was a major road along the central axis of the city. It was the main road along which the Emperor would worship his ancestors and hold grand ceremonies in the southern suburbs.Today, it is a replica of the commercial street that has been rebuilt on the site. Most of the items sold are Kaifeng specialty products, antique paintings and calligraphy. There is an old-fashioned vintage charm to the street and you can pay it a visit.\n\nPo Pagoda: One of the Only Remaining Historical Sites of the Northern Song Dynasty\n\nLocated east of Kaifeng Railway Station, Po Pagoda was built during the Northern Song Dynasty, and is one of the oldest remaining above-ground buildings in Kaifeng. It is also one of the only remaining historical sites of the Northern Song Dynasty.Po Pagoda is a three-story pagoda, with a six-story small pagoda.
