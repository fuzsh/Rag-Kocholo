        "text": "Sao Tome and Principe, officially the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea, off the western equatorial coast of Africa. It consists of two islands: So Tom and Prncipe, located about 140 kilometres apart and about 250 and 225 kilometres, respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. Sao Tome, the sizable southern island, is situated just north of the equator.\n\nBackground History\n\nDiscovered and claimed by Portugal in the late 15th century, the islands' sugar-based economy gave way to coffee and cocoa in the 19th century - all grown with African plantation slave labor, a form of which lingered into the 20th century. While independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not instituted until the late 1980s. The country held its first free elections in 1991, but frequent internal wrangling between the various political parties precipitated repeated changes in leadership and two failed coup attempts in 1995 and 2003. In 2012, three opposition parties combined in a no confidence vote to bring down the majority government of former Prime Minister Patrice Trovoada. The new government of Prime Minister Gabriel Arcanjo Ferreira Da Costa is entirely composed of opposition party members with limited experience in governance. New oil discoveries in the Gulf of Guinea may attract increased attention to the small island nation.\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry Name:\n\nconventional long form: Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe\n\nconventional short form: Sao Tome and Principe\n\nlocal long form: Republica Democratica de Sao Tome e Principe\n\nlocal short form: Sao Tome e Principe\n\nCapital:\n\nname:Sao Tome\n\ngeographic coordinates:0 12 N, 6 39 E\n\ntime difference: UTC 0 (5 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)\n\nIndependence:\n\n12 July 1975 (from Portugal)\n\nGovernment Type:\n\nrepublic\n\nExecutive Branch:\n\nchief of state: President Manuel Pinto da Costa (since 3 September 2011)\n\nhead of government: Prime Minister Patrice Emery Trovoada (since 25 November 2014)\n\ncabinet: Council of Ministers appointed by the president on the proposal of the prime minister\n\nelections: president elected by popular vote for a five-year term (eligible for a second term); election last held on 17 July and 7 August 2011 (next to be held in 2016); prime minister chosen by the National Assembly and approved by the president\n\nLegislative Branch:\n\nstructure: unicameral National Assembly\n\nJudicial Branch:\n\nstructure: Supreme Court (judges are appointed by the National Assembly)\n\n​\n\nPeople & Society\n\nPopulation:\n\n190,428 (global rank: 186)\n\ngrowth rate: 1.89% (global rank: 60)\n\nNationality:\n\nnoun:Sao Tomean(s)\n\nadjective: Sao Tomean\n\nMajor Cities:\n\nSao Toma (capital): 71,000\n\nEthnic Groups:\n\nmestico, angolares (descendants of Angolan slaves), forros (descendants of freed slaves), servicais (contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde), tongas (children of servicais born on the islands), Europeans (primarily Portuguese), Asians (mostly Chinese)\n\nReligions:\n\nCatholic 55.7%, Adventist 4.1%, Assembly of God 3.4%, New Apostolic 2.9%, Mana 2.3%, Universal Kingdom of God 2%, Jehovah's Witness 1.2%, other 6.2%, none 21.2%, unspecified 1%\n\nLanguages:\n\nPortuguese 98.4% (official), Forro 36.2%, Cabo Verdian 8.5%, French 6.8%, Angolar 6.6%, English 4.9%, Lunguie 1%, other (including sign language) 2.4%\n\nLife Expectancy at Birth:\n\ntotal population: 64.22 years(global rank: 178)\n\nmale: 62.94 years\n\nfemale: 65.53 years\n\nInfant Mortality:\n\ntotal population: 49.16 deaths/1,000 live births(global rank: 41)\n\nmale: 51.16 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 47.1 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nHIV/AIDS:\n\nadult prevalence rate: 0.64% (2013 est.)

Cocoa production has substantially declined in recent years because of drought and mismanagement. Sao Tome and Principe has to import fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a substantial amount of food, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. Over the years, it has had difficulty servicing its external debt and has relied heavily on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Sao Tome and Principe benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries program, which helped bring down the country's $300 million debt burden. In August 2005, the government signed on to a new 3-year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program worth $4.3 million. In April 2011 the country completed a Threshold Country Program with The Millennium Challenge Corporation to help increase tax revenues, reform customs, and improve the business environment. Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies. Potential exists for the development of petroleum resources in Sao Tome and Principe's territorial waters in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, which are being jointly developed in a 60-40 split with Nigeria, but any actual production is at least several years off. The first production licenses were sold in 2004, though a dispute over licensing with Nigeria delayed the country's receipt of more than $20 million in signing bonuses for almost a year. Maintaining control of inflation, fiscal discipline, and increasing flows of foreign direct investment into the oil sector are the major economic problems facing the country.\n\nGross Domestic Product:\n\nGDP (PPP): $612 million (global rank: 210)\n\nGDP per capita (PPP): $3,100 (global rank: 188)\n\nreal growth rate: 5% (global rank: 55)\n\ncomposition by sector: agriculture:18.8%, industry: 16.1%, services: 65.1%\n\nCurrency:\n\ncurrency: Sao Tomean Dobra (STD)\n\nexchange rate (per US Dollar): 18,347\n\nPoverty:\n\nunemployment rate: NA\n\npopulation below poverty line: 66.2%\n\nAgricultural Products:\n\ncocoa, coconuts, palm kernels, copra, cinnamon, pepper, coffee, bananas, papayas, beans; poultry; fish\n\nIndustries:\n\nlight construction, textiles, soap, beer, fish processing, timber\n\nExport Commodities:\n\ncocoa 80%, copra, coffee, palm oil\n\nImport Commodities:\n\nmachinery and electrical equipment, food products, petroleum products\n\nGeography\n\nLocation:\n\nCentral Africa, islands in the Gulf of Guinea, straddling the Equator, west of Gabon\n\nArea:\n\ntotal:964 sq km(global rank: 185)\n\nland: 964 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncomparative: more than five times the size of Washington, DC\n\nClimate:\n\ntropical; hot, humid; one rainy season (October to May)\n\nLand Use:\n\narable land: 9.06%\n\npermanent crops: 41.67%\n\nother: 49.27%\n\nNatural Resources:\n\nfish, hydropower\n\nCurrent Environmental Issues:\n\ndeforestation; soil erosion and exhaustion\n\nTransnational Issues\n\ninternational disputes: none\n\nPublished: Friday, April 24, 2015\n\nSao Tome and Principe, officially the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea, off the western equatorial coast of Africa.
