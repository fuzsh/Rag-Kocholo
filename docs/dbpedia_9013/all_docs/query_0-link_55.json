Wikle, Oklahoma State University\n\nDOI: 10.21690/foge/2021.64.2f\n\nIntroduction\n\nValued at more than US $100 billion, chocolate is easily the most profitable sector of the worldâs confectionary industry (Abesamis 2019). Looking across continents, Europe consumes half of the worldâs chocolate followed by the U.S. and Canada (25%), Asia (15%), Latin American (7%) and Africa (3%). While consumption is weighted towards wealthy countries, chocolateâs principal ingredient is grown and harvested in the developing world. Like coffee, cacao trees used for harvesting cacao beans are grown within low latitude rainforests. However, in contrast to coffee where distributers emphasize connections with regions or countries in their marketing efforts (i.e. Central America or Ethiopia), geographic sources of cacao beans are seldom mentioned in promoting chocolate. Instead, most know chocolate through brand names such as Godiva (Belgium), Teuscher (Switzerland), Cadbury (United Kingdom) and Ghirardelli (U.S.).\n\nUnknown to most consumers, the commercial chocolate industry was once closely tied to islands off Africaâs west coast. For several years, the tiny Portuguese colony of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe was the worldâs most important source of chocolateâs basic ingredient. However, unknown to chocolate makers and the public, the islandsâ remote location concealed an ugly secret where men and women toiling on humid plantations were subject to slave-like conditions. This article explores the development, decline, and rebirth of cacao production on SÃ£o TomÃ© Island. Along with a historical look at plantation life, we examine the former colonyâs recent efforts to promote tourism and other types of economic diversification.\n\nGeography and History\n\nThe island nation of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe (in English, Saint Thomas and Prince) is Africaâs second smallest country and among its most isolated (Becker 2008). Located on the Equator (Figure 1), the country is formed by rocky archipelagoes surrounding two larger islands. Measuring 50 by 30 kilometers, SÃ£o TomÃ© Island is 200 kilometers west of Gabon and geologically part of a massive shield volcano rising 3000 meters above the ocean floor (Mountjoy and Hilling 1988). About 140 kilometers to the northeast is the smaller island of PrÃ­ncipe. Together, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe are part of the Cameroon Volcanic Line that includes Equatorial Guineaâs Bioko and AnnobÃ³n Islands. The islands have a rugged topography with high interior mountains, dense rainforests, and coastlines punctuated by beaches and small inlets. Along with basalt flows, massive volcanic eruptions have produced iconic features such as Pico CÃ£o Grande (Great Dog Peak; see Figure 2). With an average annual temperature of 27ËC, the islands receive between 1,000 and 4,000 millimeters of rain each year (Burgess 2004). Similar to other tropical regions, the islands have an impressive array of flora and fauna. More than 900 species of vascular plants and 63 endemic bird species have contributed to its nickname, âAfrican Galapagosâ (Law 2018).\n\nSÃ£o TomÃ© was uninhabited when discovered by Portuguese explorers JoÃ£o de SantarÃ©m and PÃªro Escobar in 1486 (Garfield 1992). Five years later, Portuguese King John II granted Ãlvaro Caminha rights to establish a permanent settlement on the island. Efforts to promote European immigration were mostly unsuccessful as a result of extreme isolation and threats from tropical diseases. To hasten settlement, the Portuguese began forcibly transporting undesirable groups including criminals and prostitutes (Schorsch 2009).\n\nFaced with the task of making their colony profitable, government officials supervised the clearing of forest lands on SÃ£o TomÃ©âs northern lowlands for sugar cane plantations (Hodges 1986). Lacking a native population, slaves were brought from the African mainland to work on the fazendas (farms) and by the mid-16th century, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe was Africaâs largest producer of sugar (Gemery and Hogendron 1979). However, competition from other colonies such as Brazil affected profits and despite the influx of slaves, efforts to sustain a source of labor remained problematic. Fleeing to live in nearby mountains, escaped slaves often returned to raid plantations for food (Clarence-Smith 1978). With only a small number of European overseers, fear began to grow about an organized slave revolt. By the mid-1500s, SÃ£o TomÃ©âs sugar production was in decline and for the next few decades the island was used as a staging point to house slaves captured on the African mainland before their transport to the Americas (Law, Schawarz and Strickrodt 2013).\n\nPortuguese administrators continued searching for activities that would generate income. In 1780 they introduced coffee production and in 1824, cacao was successfully grown on PrÃ­ncipe (Maxwell 2003). Cacao production can be traced to South America (Solly 2018). Later cacao plants were transported northward into Central and North American where indigenous groups introduced European explorers to a sweet liquid xocoatl that was consumed in rituals or as a type of medicine. Spanish explorer HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s was the first to bring cacao to Spain and by the late 1500s, cacao beans arriving from the Americas were being used to make a sweet liquid for the Spanish elite (Dillinger et al. 2000).\n\nCacao Trees and Cacao Production\n\nCacao beans come from the Theobroma cacao tree, a broadleaf evergreen that thrives in latitudes within 18 degrees of the Equator (Ortiz 2016). The first cacao trees grown on the islands were of the Amelonando variety that originates in Brazil (Aikpokpodion et al. 2009). Whereas coffee is grown on hillsides and mountain slopes, cacao is best suited to lower elevation areas that receive shade from other trees. The trees themselves are delicate and easily damaged by disease or changes in microclimate including too much or too little sunlight. Pollinated by the wind or insects, cacao trees begin to bear fruit (pods) when they are four to five years old. Growing directly from the trunk or a large branch, cacao pods are harvested when they reach a red-yellow color (Figure 3). Each pod contains 20 to 60 beans surrounded by a sweet and sticky white pulp.\n\nLabor is the most costly element in growing and harvesting cacao with workers needed to keep the area around trees free of weeds. The pods themselves must be harvested manually so as not to damage the tree. Using a machete, a single fieldworker can harvest about 600 pods a day. After being detached, a curved knife is used to remove purplish-colored beans. The beans are then fermented for six days to give them a distinctive flavor and aroma and subsequently dried to reduce their moisture content from 60% to 7.5% (Figure 4). The reddish-brown colored beans are subsequently cleaned and sorted before being transported to overseas chocolate makers. Upon arrival in Europe or the U.S., the beans are subject to additional preparation and processing beginning with roasting to reduce acidity and to develop flavor and sweetness. Outer shells are removed, leaving small pieces called ânibsâ that are ground into a non-alcoholic liquor used to make bars and other products. About 900 beans are needed for each kilogram (2.2 pounds) of chocolate.\n\nAs demand for cacao increased in the late 1800s, Portuguese investors began purchasing land from local crioulos (persons of mixed African and Portuguese/European ancestry) and soon the colony of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe was the principal source of cacao for Great Britainâs three largest chocolate makers, J.S. Fry and Sons (Bristol), Rowntree (York), and the Cadbury Brothers (Birmingham). However, sustaining a sufficient number of plantation laborers remained a significant challenge since Europeans and most forros (free descendants of slaves) were unwilling to work in the fields (Higgs 2012). A longstanding source of free labor ended when slavery was abolished within all Portuguese colonies following an 1869 treaty with the U.S. and Great Britain. One ready source of workers were convicts brought to the islands from Portugalâs other African colonies including Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde. Subsequently, men and women were recruited from the mainland to serve five year terms as serviÃ§ias (contract workers). To locate new serviÃ§ias, recruiters followed former slave routes into the continentâs interior. At least some men and women were pressed into service against their will after being forced to march to the coastline wearing shackles (Nevinson 1906a). Estimates suggest that between 1888 and 1908 as many as 67,000 Africans were shipped to plantations on SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe to become low wage contract workers who possessed few rights.\n\nThe plantation or roÃ§a (pronounced âraw-saâ) was the focus of large-scale coffee and cacao production. RoÃ§as operated as self-sufficient cities with schools, stores, and chapels. A typical roÃ§a had buildings arranged along the edge of an open area called a plaza. Plazas were used for the daily roll-call, drying beans, and other purposes. Infrastructure on larger roÃ§as sometimes included narrow-gauge tracks used by small locomotives and carts to facilitate the movement of cacao to processing facilities and coastal shipping stations. Specialized facilities were also built for fermenting, drying, roasting, and storing cacao beans. ServiÃ§ias lived in houses or barracks called senzalas that resembled long sheds subdivided inside by partitions (Nevinson 1906b). Built for the plantation owner or manager, the largest house was called the patrÃ£o. Most large roÃ§as were equipped with a hospital for treating tropical diseases, often with separate wards for men and women (Figure 5). Constructed using ornate designs and capped with a Mediterranean-style tiled roof, the hospital and patrÃ£o were symbols of a roÃ§aâs power and prestige. Social stratification on roÃ§as stipulated areas off limits to serviÃ§ias including the patrÃ£o and upper floors of the hospital reserved for Europeans. By 1906, more than 70,000 hectares of land on SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe Islands were under cultivation within roÃ§as (Figure 6).\n\nLife on a roÃ§a was arduous with men responsible for harvesting and transporting cacao pods and women tasked with extracting and preparing beans for fermentation and drying. Most serviÃ§ias worked 62 hours a week with a half-day off on Sundays. Wages were low. During the early 1900s, men received a monthly salary of around 2,500 reis per month (about US $2.50) and women, just 1,800 reis (Nevinson 1906b). Most serviÃ§ias were well-fed and provided with good housing and medical care. The basic diet included beans, rice, fish, and vegetables. Other staples such as clothing, tobacco, soap, cotton, cooking utensils, and rum could be purchased from a store using currency printed on the roÃ§a. Since a workerâs wages could only be spent at the company store, nearly all money paid to workers came back to plantation owners (Nevinson 1906b). Alcoholism was widespread and tropical diseases, especially malaria, took a severe toll.\n\nRoÃ§as dispensed their own brutal forms of justice with serviÃ§ias enjoying few personal freedoms. Among other restrictions, serviÃ§ias were prevented from growing their own food or leaving the roÃ§a without permission. Runaways and others who violated rules were subject to severe punishment. To maintain a steady labor supply, some plantation managers renewed contracts without their workersâ knowledge and at least some serviÃ§ias who did not renew their contracts discovered that the meager funds they earned were insufficient to pay for transportation back to the mainland. Although limited in scope, the Portuguese implemented policies to protect workers. For example, the children of serviÃ§ias (called tongas) were not compelled to work until age 11 and at age 16 they were given the option to sign a contract.\n\nUnaware of working conditions or the absence of freedom experienced by serviÃ§ias, European chocolate makers continued importing cacao beans from the islands. However, by the late 1800s, stories about slave-like conditions found their way to Europe and the U.S. (Scientific American 1897). In 1901, William Cadbury (grandson of Cadbury and Sons founder, John Cadbury) saw an advertisement listing buildings, equipment, and more than a hundred workers as assets of a SÃ£o TomÃ© plantation that was for sale. The information was shared with others on his companyâs board of directors and soon after, the company joined other chocolate makers in an investigation of working conditions and labor practices within SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe. Joseph Burtt was hired to carry out the inquiry. Arriving first in Angola on the Africa mainland, Burttâs reports described men and women transported, ââ¦against their will, and often under conditions of great crueltyâ (Pierson 1910). Traveling next to SÃ£o TomÃ© Island he visited several roÃ§as and met with plantation owners and government officials (Satre 2005). Another visitor to the islands was British war correspondent Henry Nevinson whose 1906 article in Harperâs Magazine drew attention to annual death rates of 14% among adults and 20% for children (Nevinson 1906a; Figure 7). The most common causes of death were noted to be dysentery, anemia, and smallpox. As Nevinson noted, unlike slaves, serviÃ§ias cost plantation owners nothing; if they became sick and died the manager could rely on Portuguese administrators to find replacements.\n\nThree years passed without action by the chocolate makers. Finally in 1909, J.S. Fry, Rowntree and Sons, Cadbury Brothers, and Stollwerck implemented a boycott on imports from SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe while shifting to cacao supplies coming from the British-controlled Gold Coast (now Ghana). The response by plantation owners was to increase exports to chocolate producers elsewhere in Europe and the U.S. Instead of declining, shipments increased and by 1913, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe was the worldâs largest cacao producer, exporting more than 36,500 tons in a single year (Dulcine 2012). However, the production boon proved to be short-lived. In 1919, tiny insects called thrips devastated nearly all of the colonyâs cacao crop (Keisow 2017). At the same time, brutality towards the serviÃ§ias was making it increasingly difficult to sustain a supply of workers. As profits declined, buildings and equipment fell into disrepair (Figure 8) and by 1935, a global recession made it necessary for the roÃ§as to move towards self-sufficiency by growing their own food. By the early 1940s, production per hectare had fallen well below that of other West African countries. The islands experienced other problems related to labor. Rumors that Portuguese administrators might confiscate land and force forros to work in the fields led to violence in the early 1950s.)\n\nOver the next 25 years the roÃ§as produced modest quantities of cacao and coffee. The end of colonial rule came in 1975 when a military coup in Portugal brought independence to all Portuguese colonies in Africa (Seibert 2003). Viewing the roÃ§as as symbols of colonialism, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipeâs new Marxist government nationalized the islandâs largest roÃ§as into 15 state-owned companies. Other medium-sized roÃ§as and smallholder properties called glebas remained in private hands but were subject to new regulations. It was believed that land reform would be a catalyst for economic diversification. However, within a few months more than 4,000 persons, mostly Europeans and Angolans, left the islands. The exodus created additional trouble for the roÃ§as as experienced managers were replaced with newcomers who possessed limited knowledge about plantation operations. Between 1975 and 1987 cacao production dropped from 10,000 tons to 3,900 tons per year (World Bank 1991). Many roÃ§as fell into disrepair or were abandoned and occupied by squatters who grew subsistence crops (Figure 9).\n\nRecognizing the countryâs economic dependence on cacao production, international aid organizations stepped in to provide assistance. For example, a 1980 World Bank project provided funding for gravity-fed irrigation systems, solar driers, and greenhouses. In 1990, the countryâs centrally planned economic system was replaced by a free market economy and a year later, Miguel Trovoada became SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipeâs first freely elected president. To stimulate innovation, the new government subdivided some large plantations to create smaller farms. Unfortunately, a 1998 slump in cacao prices led to an additional drop in production. With limited funds to purchase supplies, many farmers stopped using fungicides and insecticides and at least some grew cacao only as a means of preserving their property rights.\n\nA Visit\n\nOfficially the Democratic Republic of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, the former Portuguese colony is not a popular tourist destination. Although itâs possible to find non-stop flights from Lisbon, the majority of international flights to SÃ£o TomÃ© City pass through other West African capitals such as Accra (Ghana), Malabo (Equatorial Guinea), or Libreville (Gabon). Upon arrival, visitors find few tourist amenities. In lieu of currency exchange desks or ATM machines, itâs necessary to find a âblack marketâ money trader willing to exchange Euros or U.S Dollars for Dobras. Island culture is a blend of European and African traditions with most people speaking both Portuguese and a crioulos language such as SÃ£otomense, Angolar, or Principense. Like other former colonies, religious beliefs combine elements of Catholicism with animist traditions. The countryâs population of 208,000 includes forros (the descendants of European immigrants and African slaves), angolars (the descendants of Angolan slaves), Mozambicans, Cape Verdeans, and others (Antalya Organize Sanayi BÃ¶lgec 2019). Along with beans and rice, food staples include locally grown maize, bananas, citrus fruits, roots, fish, and bush meat. A popular dish called calulu is made from seafood combined with okra, eggplant, and tomato. Meats consumed on special occasions include goat, beef, and chicken.\n\nWith a 2017 per capita gross domestic product of just $1,900, a significant part of the population lives below the poverty line (Global Finance 2019). Isolation and the absence of economic diversification contribute to the countryâs standing as among the worldâs largest per capita recipients of foreign aid. The population is young with a median age of 18 years and a life expectancy (65 years) that is close to the world average. With no minimum age for working, child labor is widespread. Educational attainment is a symbol of status leading families with the financial means to send children to live with relatives in SÃ£o TomÃ© City where they can attend a secondary school.\n\nOutside cacao production, the country has few economic activities for generating hard currency. With limited domestic food production, the island imports most of its food. Some income is generated through timber exports and the sale of fishing permits (see Figure 10). Challenges to economic development include a poor road infrastructure and a lack of deep water ports, making it necessary for larger ships to be loaded or unloaded using barges. Although without known mineral resources, an agreement with Nigeria has established a pathway for the joint exploitation of petroleum resources within the Niger Delta. Manufacturing is limited to a few small factories that make soap, bricks, or beverages. Although the tourism industry has expanded in recent years, growth in international visitors is constrained by difficult travel connections, poor infrastructure, and threats from disease. As a result of these issues, the former colony remains one of the least visited countries in the world (Smith 2019). Despite reforms, government corruption remains an issue. In recent years the countryâs leaders have taken measures to attract foreign investment, reduce the longstanding budget deficit, and privatize industry.\n\nSÃ£o TomÃ© City has the charm of a place untrammeled by hotel chains or hordes of tourists. Along wide boulevards lined with walnut trees are colonial-era buildings designed in the Salazarist style to project power and prestige (Figure 11). Many have fallen into disrepair with faded pastel colors, dilapidated balconies, and shuttered windows. Ironically, the cityâs open-air markets offer clothing, tools, household goods, fish, fruit, and palm wine but no chocolate. Near the city center and overlooking the entrance to the Bay of Ana Chaves is the 16th century Fort SÃ£o SebastiÃ£o. Despite the dominance of urban areas, most lead an agrarian life. Within villages are wood plank houses called luchÃ¡ns (Figure 12) or Portuguese-style homes constructed on concrete foundations. Built on the sides of some houses are lean-to shelters used to sell goods. The countryâs most well-known natural area is the 195 square-mile ObÃ´ Natural Park. Covering 35% of SÃ£o TomÃ© Island, the parkâs virgin rainforest has been classified by the World Wildlife Fund as among the most important biological areas on Earth (World Wildlife Fund 2000).\n\nDespite many roÃ§as having been reclaimed by rainforest, cacao and coffee continue to be produced on both larger plantations and smallholder farms. Some larger plantations are owned and operated by foreign companies while many smaller holdings have been organized into cooperatives that share equipment and facilities for bean fermentation, drying, and storage. One example is CECAQ-11, an association of more than 1,100 small growers. Although production has increased from where it was in the mid-1980s, the country is no longer among the worldâs most important cacao producing nations, now led by the Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Indonesia (Cacaoweb 2019).\n\nVisiting a roÃ§a is like stepping back in time. Two of SÃ£o TomÃ© Islandâs largest are RoÃ§a Agostinho Neto (formerly Rio de Ouro RoÃ§a or River of Gold) and RoÃ§a Ãgua IzÃ© (farm near the water). Named for a former president of Angola, Agostinho Neto is located on the islandâs northern plains. A wide road lined with pastel-colored buildings leads past the plantationâs residential area to its hospital complex (Figures 13 and 14). When Burtt visited in 1905 the plantation was managed by retired general Claudio de Sousa e Faro, who supervised the work of more than 1,500 seriÃ§ais (Higgs 2012). Today, Agostinho Netoâs population is estimated to be 1,000. Located on the eastern coastline, the islandâs oldest cacao plantation is RoÃ§a Ãgua IzÃ©. In the early 1900s more than 1,800 seriÃ§ais and tongas lived there under the oversight of JosÃ© Maria de Sousa e Almeida, a crioulos credited with making the plantation among the countryâs most profitable. One of Ãgua IzÃ© most impressive features is its hospital that features an elaborate entryway and exterior staircase (Figures 15 and 16). Today the building is occupied by squatters including children who run to greet Europeans and Americans shouting âbranca!â (white person!). Near the hospital are tracks from the plantationâs narrow gauge railway, once used to transport cacao to coastal shipping stations. Not far away is a narrow coastal channel and blowhole cut by erosion through pillow-shaped basaltic lava called Boca do Inferno (Mouth of Hell; Figure 17). A legend from the early 1900s holds that a cruel European overseer at Ãgua IzÃ© used the channel for instantaneous travel back to the Portuguese Kingdom. Locals feared that he could reappear at any time. A few roÃ§as have been converted to other purposes such as boutique hotels or cafes. For example, RoÃ§a Sundy was initially a cacao and coffee plantation and later served as a vacation home for the Portuguese royal family. Today, the former plantation operates as a 12-room hotel featuring a restored planterâs house with a high ceiling and balconies that overlook a garden.\n\nIn recent years the islandâs cacao producers have found ways to be more competitive by serving specialized chocolate markets. For example, in lieu of competing with high volume operations elsewhere in West Africa, some farmers have shifted to producing eco-friendly, âfair tradeâ beans (Constable 2019). While ecofriendly beans come from cacao grown in the absence of chemical inputs such as fertilizers and herbicides, fair trade prices recognize costs associated with sustainable living and production. The growing demand for organically grown beans has been compared to the emphasis on premium ingredients used within the craft beer industry. Craft chocolate differentiates itself by flavor, the types of beans used, and the origin of ingredients. Confectionaries that purchase fair trade beans from SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe include Cadbury, Divine, and the German chocolate maker FranÃ§ois Pralus. The islandsâ best-known producer of organically grown cacao is Claudio Corallo, an Italian businessman and farmer who purchased a 120 hectare roÃ§a in 1997 called Terreiro Velha. Along with overseeing cacao production on his plantation, Corallo gives demonstrations at his laboratory and chocolate factory in SÃ£o TomÃ© City. Inside a room lined with teak paneling are long wooden tables used for testing velvety and bittersweet dark chocolate containing between 60 and 100% pure cacao. As visitors watch, Corallo prepares samples for tasting that include additives such as ginger, orange, grapes, raisins, salt and pepper, and cacao bean slivers (to provide a nutty flavor and crunchy texture; Figure 18). Sold through his website, Coralloâs chocolate isnât cheap. A 160 gram box sells for US $18 (see https://www.claudiocorallo.com/index.php).\n\nConclusion\n\nIsolation has remained a defining element in the settlement and economic history of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe. The islands are distinct from other locations within Africa in having been occupied by humans for a relatively brief period of time. In its early years, Portugalâs remote outpost was unattractive to most Europeans. Seeking ways to make the colony profitable, government administrators brought slaves from the African mainland to work in the sugar cane fields. Income from cacao exports during the mid-1800s led to a new labor shortage, prompting government officials to import laborers from other Portuguese colonies. Working within fields and processing facilities, men and women from Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde endured harsh treatment from European overseers. Along with creating challenges for contract workers hoping to return to their homelands, the colonyâs remote location shielded the mistreatment of workers from outside eyes.\n\nToday, the landscape of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe continues to project its colonial past. Interspersed among dilapidated buildings are the rusting hulks of equipment and machinery used for processing and preparing cacao beans before shipment to Europe or the U.S. While some former plantations have been reclaimed by the rainforest, others are occupied by the descendants of contract workers who grow subsistence crops. Change has been slow in coming. Despite efforts to diversify the economy, cacao continues to be the countryâs most important export. Recognizing the challenge of competing with high volume producers, some farmers have shifted production towards demand for premium beans. Despite its unique role in the story of chocolate, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe remain virtually unknown to all but a handful adventurers who come to learn about former colonyâs culture, pristine forests, and unfortunate past.\n\nReferences"
