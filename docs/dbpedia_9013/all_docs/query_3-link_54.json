        "text": "About the map\n\nSao Tome and Principe is an African island country, which lies off the west coast along the equator. It consists of two main islands approximately 150 kilometers apart. First, Sao Tome is the largest island in the south, which contains the capital city of Sao Tome situated to the northeast.\n\nWhereas the island of Principe is the smaller of the two islands to the north with just 4% of the nation’s population. But it also holds several other small islands such as Ilheu das Rolas, which is directly on the equator south of Sao Tome.\n\nThere are also Ilhéu Caroço, the Cabras Islets, Tinhosa Grande and Tinhosa Pequena, which are all uninhabited and situated between the two main islands. Other than its capital city of Sao Tome, other major cities include Santo Amaro, Neves, and Santana.\n\nSao Tome and Principe in Google Maps\n\nPHYSICAL MAP\n\nSao Tome and Principe Elevation Map\n\nRainforests cover large areas of land on both islands with waterfalls and a ring of beaches surrounding the island. Because the country is positioned close to the equator, it has a wet and tropical climate. Sao Tome is the more mountainous of the two islands and contains Pico de Sao Tome in the central-west region. At 2,024 m (6,640 ft), this is the highest peak in Sao Tome and Principe."
