        "text": "São Tomé and Príncipe, one of the smallest African countries, is located on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. It has a total area of around 1,001 sq. km and a coastline of about 209 km. As observed in the physical map of the country, it has two major islands, São Tomé and Príncipe from where the name of the country is derived. These islands are separated by a distance of around 181.55 km and are surrounded by many smaller islands forming archipelagos. Being an island nation, it shares no land borders but is in close proximity to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nSão Tomé is the largest island in the country and is located just above the equator as visible on the map above. It is more mountainous than Príncipe. The highest peak here (Pico de São Tomé) is at 2,024 m which is also the highest point in the country. The highest point on Príncipe is at 948 m. Both islands are part of a long-extinct volcanic range. At 0 m, the Atlantic Ocean is the lowest elevation in the country.\n\nRivers and lakes are nearly non-existent on each island but there is an abundance of small streams and creeks that wind across the country. São Tomé and Príncipe both have a generally wet and hot climate with the average yearly temperature being around 27 °C (80.6 °F) and with an average annual rainfall of 5,000 mm (196.9 in). The rainy season lasts between October to May."
