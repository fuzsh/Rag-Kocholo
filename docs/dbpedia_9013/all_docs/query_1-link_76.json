        "text": "A National Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCP) is a key document that provides guidance on how to respond to an oil spill in the case of an incident.\n\nSensitivity mapping of the various types of environments and resources potentially exposed to oil spills enables the identification of the most sensitive sites or resources and provide a basis for the definition of priorities for protection and clean-up, and information to plan the best-suited response strategy.\n\nPolicies on the use of dispersant ensure oil spill dispersants as a response option can be made available in a timely manner, and that suitable products are available for use if required.\n\nWhen oil reaches the shoreline, considerable effort may be required to clean affected areas. It is therefore essential that comprehensive and well rehearsed arrangements for shoreline clean-up are included in Contingency plans.\n\nThe waste management policy is a vital component of any oil spill contingency plan. A well-developed policy addresses components like waste recovery and recycling opportunities or a logistics chain comprising temporary storage sites and transportation that has the ability to interface with the existing available waste infrastructure.\n\nAn Incident Management System (IMS) facilitates command and control of an oil spill by organizing leaders, functions, response teams and other resources through a scalable structure with pre-identified roles, responsibilities, reporting relationships and authorities necessary to manage an incident.\n\nWhere there is the potential for trans-boundary movement of spilled oil, or if personnel and equipment may need to be transported across borders, regional and bilateral agreements can provide response actions and sharing of resources. Prearranged procedures are vital for rapid resolution of issues such as liability concerns, emergency immigration and import provisions, and financial compensation processes.\n\nThe International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation 1990 (OPRC 90) is the international instrument that provides a framework designed to facilitate international co-operation and mutual assistance in preparing for and responding to major oil pollution incidents and requires States to plan and prepare by developing national systems for pollution response in their respective countries, and by maintaining adequate capacity and resources to address oil pollution emergencies.\n\nMore information\n\nLike the OPRC Convention, the OPRC-HNS Protocol aims to establish national systems for preparedness and response and to provide a global framework for international co-operation in combating major incidents or threats of marine pollution.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Civil Liability Convention was adopted to ensure that adequate compensation is available to persons who suffer oil pollution damage resulting from maritime casualties involving oil-carrying ships. The Convention places the liability for such damage on the owner of the ship from which the polluting oil escaped or was discharged.\n\nMore information\n\nThe 1992 Fund Convention, which is supplementary to the 1992 CLC, establishes a regime for compensating victims when compensation under the 1992 CLC is not available or is inadequate. The International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, 1992 (1992 Fund) was set up under the 1992 Fund Convention.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Convention was adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt, and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil, when carried as fuel in shipsâ€™ bunkers. The convention is modelled on the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969.\n\nMore information\n\nThe HNS Convention was adopted in 1996 to insure adequate and efficient compensation to victims of accidents involving HNS, such as chemicals. The Convention is based on the two-tier system established under the CLC and Fund Conventions.\n\nMore information"
