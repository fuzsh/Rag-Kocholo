        "text": "São Tomé and Príncipe, an African island nation close to the equator, is part of a volcano chain featuring striking rock and coral formations, rainforests and beaches. Discovered and claimed by Portugal in the late 15th century, the islands' sugar-based economy gave way to coffee and cocoa in the 19th century.\n\nIt has a rather chequered history of the slave trade and slave labour, of colony and colonisers, of revolutionaries and freedom movements, of military coups and elections. Visitors to the islands swear by its cocoa, by its virgin beaches and crystal clear waters, steamy jungles and extinct volcanoes, by its Creole culture and Afro-Latin music – reasons enough to visit the islands.\n\nThe best time to visit São Tomé and Príncipe is during the dry season, which runs from June to September. During this period, the weather is generally sunny with lower humidity and less rainfall, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking and exploring the beaches.\n\nIt's worth noting that even during the dry season, there can still be occasional rainfall, and temperatures can vary depending on the location and altitude.\n\nThe rainy season in São Tomé and Príncipe typically runs from October to May, with the highest rainfall occurring between March and May. While this period can be challenging for some activities due to the heavy rains, it is also a great time to see the lush green landscapes, vibrant flora and fauna, and waterfalls.\n\nUltimately, the best time to visit São Tomé and Príncipe depends on your personal preferences and interests. If you're looking for sunny weather and outdoor activities, the dry season is the best time to visit. But if you want to experience the stunning natural beauty and unique culture of the islands, the rainy season can also be a great time to go.\n\nSão Tomé and Príncipe offers visitors a unique blend of natural beauty, history, and culture.

Take a snorkeling or diving excursion to see colorful fish, sea turtles, and even whale sharks.\n\nRelax on the beautiful beaches: São Tomé and Príncipe has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Spend a day lounging on the white sand of Praia Banana or Praia Piscina, or take a boat tour to discover hidden coves and secluded beaches.\n\nVisit the smaller islands: Ilhéu das Rolas and Lagoa Azul are two small islets off the coast of São Tomé Island that offer unique experiences. Visit the equator line on Ilhéu das Rolas or snorkel in the crystal-clear waters of Lagoa Azul.\n\nGo birdwatching: São Tomé and Príncipe is home to a number of unique bird species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world.
