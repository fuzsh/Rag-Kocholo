        "meta_description": "The two islands of Sao Tome and Principe hover just above the equator, 250km off the coast of Gabon. While other tropical paradises have been taken over by resorts, Sao Tome and Principe remain thankfully much as they were when the Portuguese first discovered them in 1470, save for the addition of the odd cocoa plantation and charmingly crumbling colonial town.",

        "text": "The climate is equatorial and maritime, so hot and humid all year round. There are two rainy seasons, February to May and October to December. The main dry season from June to September tends to be cloudier with moderate temperatures.\n\nThe rainy season is best for spotting orchids, but for comfortable hiking, come in January when the orchids are still in bloom above 800m.\n\nYou can see migrating humpback whales off the coast from August to October. From mid-January to mid-February, the island’s birds are sporting their mating plumage. Many visitors come between November and March to see marine turtles laying their eggs or September and April to see the hatchlings return to the sea. The best time to go diving in terms of visibility is between December and March.\n\nIt’s a short flight between the islands in a comfortable two-propeller plane and flights run most days. There is currently no real regular, reliable boat service between the two islands.\n\nThere are a few tarmacked roads on the two islands, supplemented by countless dirt roads and tracks. Most of the locals use shared yellow taxis. These can also be hired individually by paying for all the seats. For more flexibility, hire a vehicle with 4WD or a mountain bike.\n\nSao Tomean cuisine is fish-focused. Fried flying fish and grilled swordfish are particular delicacies and fish also appears in calulu, Sao Tome’s signature dish – a stew made with lady’s fingers, palm oil, chilli and plenty of fresh herbs.\n\nGorge yourself on Sao Tome’s wonderful array of exotic fruits: jackfruit, bananas, pineapple, mangosteen, custard-apple, mango, pawpaw and casamangas, for example.\n\nVegetarians will find plenty of options, even if many Sao Tomeans don’t know what the word means. Just memorise the useful phrase “nem carne, nem peixe”.\n\nThe local beers Nacional and Criollo and Portuguese-imported Sagres and Super Bock are widely available. Ask around to sample palm-wine.\n\nCheck you’re up-to-date with your tetanus, polio, diphtheria and hepatitis A jabs. Although the cases of malaria are diminishing on both islands, the disease is still present so it’s recommended you take anti-malarials. Minimise the risk of being bitten by taking insect repellent with you, and, if you’re staying in budget accommodation consider buying an insect net. Stick to purified or boiled water.\n\nSao Tome and Principe is generally very safe. However, pickpockets do operate on the islands. Discos and beaches are the most common place for things to be stolen. Consider investing in a waterproof pouch, which you can put valuables in and take into the water."
