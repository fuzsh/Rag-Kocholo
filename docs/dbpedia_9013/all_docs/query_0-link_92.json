        "text": "We found the two-story edifice cloaked by the shadows of towering teak trees and snarled in ferns, palms, and woody liana vines.\n\nNo wonder the site was hardly known in the surrounding village that bears the same name, Praia Melão. Vegetation shrouded the building, and those who were aware considered it a place best avoided, a gathering ground for ghosts. Many people had died there. Their spirits do not rest in peace.\n\nThe Praia Melão engenho and estate is the first archaeological site identified in São Tomé. Since 2020, one of us (Cruz) has led a group of international and Santomean scholars to investigate the locale—in the process introducing archaeology to a country that has not hosted this kind of work before.\n\nOur research at Praia Melão is of global importance, as it explores the origins of plantation slavery in the 16th century. São Tomé became the first plantation economy in the tropics based on sugar monoculture and enslaved labor, a model exported to the Americas, where it developed and expanded. São Tomé’s role in this devastating and transformational history is largely unknown—some people have never heard of the tiny nation. Our team aims to illuminate the island’s central and brutal place in world history.\n\nENSLAVED SUGAR MAKERS\n\nSão Tomé’s early history was closely linked to Elmina Castle, in today’s Ghana, the first European trading post built in the Gulf of Guinea. Then, São Tomé functioned as an import-export stop for European trade of African gold and enslaved people. By the 1530s, São Tomé emerged as a profitable node in the Portuguese colonial empire, with sugar plantations ringing most of the island’s coastline and its sugar dominating European markets.\n\nHistorical documents and maps from the late 16th and early 17th centuries mention Praia Melão, depicting it as the island’s largest estate. Many enslaved mainland Africans and perhaps some Portuguese convicts labored on the plantation.\n\nOur observations of the site have colored in more intimate details. The architectural ruins show the sugar mill and estate house were in a single two-story building about the size of a tennis court.\n\nThis past July, Dona Didi, Edsiley’s mother, visited the site while we were clearing the interior of the workroom with students. She entered gingerly, not daring to walk the full length of the room, barely 20 meters long. Having lived about 150 meters away all her life, she remarked, “I am 60 years old, and this is the first time I enter this place. We were always afraid.”\n\nOur work at Praia Melão will succeed not simply by unearthing the forgotten traces of one of the world’s earliest plantations. We are also seeking to build an informed, empowered local consensus about heritage preservation that will carry forward as Santomeans use archaeology to understand and celebrate the country’s rich, complex history.\n\nThe island’s prominence was short lived. It subsided before the start of the 17th century due to the poor quality of its sugar, the dominance of Brazilian sugar, and local events—particularly extensive insurrections by enslaved Africans. The resulting political instability and destruction of mills led most white landowners to move to Brazil, taking with them technology, equipment, and financing. Nevertheless, the island had a foundational role in the creation of the plantation slavery model that came to define the Atlantic world for generations.\n\nThe dense forest engulfing the eerie ruins and the belief in troubled ancestors have hidden the site from destructive designs and curious eyes, but also from the knowledge of Santomeans. It is time to make the Praia Melão engenho known to neighbors and the wider world."
