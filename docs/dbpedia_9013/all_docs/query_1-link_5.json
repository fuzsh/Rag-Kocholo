        "text": "Sao Tome and Principe, once a leading cocoa producer, consists of two islands of volcanic origin and a number of smaller islets lying off the coast of Africa.\n\nFrom the late 1400s Portugal began settling convicts on Sao Tome and establishing sugar plantations with the help of slaves from the mainland. The island was also important in the transshipment of slaves.\n\nThe colony's aspirations for independence were recognised after the 1974 coup in Portugal and at first the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe was the country's sole political party. However, the 1990 constitution created a multi-party democracy.\n\nThe island of Principe assumed autonomy in 1995.\n\nThe country hopes to reduce its dependence on donors and cocoa exports by exploiting offshore oil. It has strong links with Angola, which is a major business partner.\n\n1493 - First successful settlement of SÃ£o TomÃ© by Portugal's Ãlvaro Caminha - the islands were uninhabited before the arrivbal of teh Portuguese.\n\n1500 - PrÃ­ncipe settled.

Portuguese government recognises islands' right to independence, acknowledges MLSTP as sole representative in negotiations. Unrest followed by exodus of Portuguese.\n\n1975 - Independence, with Manuel Pinto da Costa (MLSTP) as president; and Miguel Trovoada as prime minister. Plantations nationalised, strong ties built up with communist countries.\n\n1978 - Government announces suppression of coup attempt, brings in Angolan troops for support.\n\n1979 - Trovoada arrested, accused of complicity in coup attempt. He is released and goes into exile in 1981.\n\n1980s - Government scales down links with communist world as economy deteriorates. Declares itself nonaligned, seeks Western support for recovery plans.\n\n1988 - Coup attempt.\n\n1990 - New constitution allows opposition parties, provides for multi-party elections and restricts president to two five-year terms. Trovoada returns from exile.\n\n1991 - First multiparty elections. Renamed MLSTP-PSD loses majority. Transitional government installed, pending presidential elections, subsequently won by independent candidate Trovoada.\n\n1992 - Popular unrest sparked by austerity measures.\n\n1995 - Trovoada toppled and detained in bloodless coup by soldiers but is reinstated within days after pressure from donor countries.\n\n1996 - Trovoada re-elected president. Popular protests over economic hardships.\n\n2002 - President De Menezes announces plans for a US naval base in the country, which would aim to protect Sao Tome's oil interests.\n\n2003 - Military coup topples the government.

A general amnesty is given to the coup leaders.\n\n2004 - President De Menezes sacks the prime minister and government after a series of corruption scandals. A new prime minister is sworn in.\n\n2005 - Sao Tome - jointly with Nigeria - signs its first offshore oil exploration and production-sharing agreement with international oil firms.\n\n2007 - World Bank, IMF forgive $360m in debt owed by Sao Tome. This represents about 90% of the country's foreign debt.\n\nNigeria and Sao Tome agree to establish a joint military commission to protect their common oil interests in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\n2008 - Several high-ranking former government officials, including to ex-prime ministers, appear in court in Sao Tome's largest corruption scandal.\n\n2009 - Government says coup plot foiled. Nigeria and Sao Tome agree to set up a joint maritime military commission to protect offshore oil fields.\n\n2010 - Opposition leader Arlecio Costa, jailed over 2009 coup plot, is pardoned.\n\n2016 - Sao Tome re-establishes diplomatic relations with China after cutting ties with Taiwan.\n\n2022 - Sao Tome says \"four citizens\" were killed in a gunfight in an attempted coup, which also involved 12 soldiers from South Africa's officially disbanded Buffalo Battalion. One of the dead is Arlecio Costa.\n\nMedia reporting of images of what appear to be tortured suspects surrounded by soldiers before and after their deaths sparks outrage and calls for a probe into the killings\n\n2023 - A Sao Tome court dismisses charges against former army chief Olinto Paquete over the 2022 coup attempt, citing a lack of evidence. Paquete was among soldiers charged with torturing and killing the four suspects accused of the failed coup. He resigned shortly afterwards."
