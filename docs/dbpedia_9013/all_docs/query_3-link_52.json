        "text": "Our columnist, Jada Yuan, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2018 list. This dispatch brings her to São Tomé and Príncipe; it took the No. 22 spot on the list and is the 39th stop on Jada’s itinerary.\n\nThe immense wall of crumbling, whitewashed stone might have belonged to an abandoned castle. Turrets lined a roof that was no longer there, and watchtowers poked the sky at each corner. This had been the province of horses, though, not kings, servicing a Portuguese cocoa plantation on the tiny island of Príncipe. All that remained inside the stone stables was rain forest overgrowth in shades of green and purple .\n\n“This,” said my host, Claudio Torres, “is the place where you can finally confirm that nature wins.”\n\nLooking at a map of the dual-island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe, Africa’s second-smallest country — some 140 miles off the coast of Gabon, right on the Equator — cannot prepare you for the otherworldly feeling you get when stepping off a plane there. Even before you land, it is difficult to imagine that those two dots of dense, tropical forest in the expanse of blue below you are an entire nation.\n\nSão Tomé, the larger of the two islands, has an international airport and a Portuguese-speaking popu lation of 200,000. Roosters wander past pink and turquoise facades threaded with wild foliage in the capital city (also called São Tomé). Drive 10 minutes and urbanity gives way to quiet fishing villages and banana groves.\n\nIt wasn’t until I got there that I realized I should have brought euros to either use or to convert to dobras — since, like many places in West and Central Africa, cash is king. Luckily, my lovely hotel, Omali Lodge, was one of the places that took credit cards. And when the banks opened after the weekend, I was able to exchange some British pounds.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
