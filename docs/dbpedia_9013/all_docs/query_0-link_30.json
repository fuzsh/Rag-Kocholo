        "text": "São Tomé & Príncipe hold some of Africa’s best kept secrets, steeped in history & culture born from Tropical Equatorial African roots merged with a Portuguese Colonial past.\n\nAnd yet these islands feel almost Cuban when you add this mix to their cinematographic beaches of clear water & golden sand.\n\nJust 240 km from the coast of Gabon, you will arrive fast but not as fast as the feeling of being in a land so strikingly different.\n\nIndulge yourself in Principe, the smallest island, only 142km² with 60% of its territory a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO.\n\nHere you easily lose yourself to its marine life, beaches, forests, waterfalls, plantations, and wildlife.\n\nThe biosphere reserve is home to great biodiversity in terrestrial as well as in marine ecosystems, with high rates of endemism (species unique to the island) in many groups of organisms, especially vascular plants, molluscs, insects, birds, reptiles and bats. It is part of the biodiversity hotspot of tropical forests of West Africa, containing a wide range of plant communities and habitats of high international importance such as primary tropical forests, forest shade, palm trees and lowland riparian habitats.\n\nAn area of huge interest for the conservation of global biological diversity – vital, considering the importance that this area has for the reproduction of sea turtles, seabirds and cetaceans, as well as coral reefs.\n\nA mind-blowingly beautiful, rare, and special habitat that is both remote and wild – The epitome of a See Wild Travels’ location!\n\nChocolate is hard to miss on a trip to these islands that are famous for the growing the sought after Claudio Corallo delicacy.\n\nCocoa plant was taken from Brazil to Principe and Sao Tomé for the first time around 1822. From there, it spread to Nigeria and Ghana. By 1908, Sao Tome had become the world’s largest producer of cacao and had earned its name …\"the chocolate islands\". Although São Tomé islands is no longer the world's biggest supplier of cacao, it is capable of exporting some of the best-quality beans on earth. Over the years, the world's cacao growers have sacrificed quality for the sake of high yields. On the São Tomé archipelago, however, there are still descendants of the original forastero plants that the portuguese brought from South America in 1822.\n\nThis kind of magic only happens in Terreiro Velho (Principe island) and Nova Moca (Sao Tomé island), two old plantations (locally known as \"roça\") devoted to coffee and cacao. The man who runs the place, Claudio Corallo, an Italian who spent most of his life in Africa, is working with these surviving plants, farming organically to produce a limited-yield superior cacao. Corallo has been for the past decade on a quest to produce some of the finest dark chocolate in the world. His bars, which range in cocoa content from 60 per cent to 100 per cent, when the raw ingredients are this good you don’t need to add dairy or vanilla. Some of these delicious bars that may contain ginger, arabica coffee beans, orange rind or plump raisins soaked for months in his home-made cocoa-pulp alcohol, have been going to a few small luxury stores in Europe, the United States and Japan. They have to be tasted to be believed! In Principe's Sundy Praia you can do that in style at their weekly \"back to Cacao\" evenings run in partnership with Claudio corallo."
