        "text": "In brief\n\nPolitical stability will be broadly maintained until the next legislative election, in 2026. The ruling party, Acção Democrática Independente, led by the prime minister, Patrice Trovoada, holds a majority of seats in parliament and controls the presidency. However, economic and financial conditions will remain dire. São Tomé is suffering from severe fiscal and balance-of-payments strains, and the government has been trying to negotiate a new programme with the IMF since the previous programme collapsed in December 2022. A staff-level agreement agreement was reached in March 2023, but the board has not approved a new programme as yet, owing to a lack of commitment by the government to implement and enforce strict fiscal and monetary tightening. We expect the IMF's Executive Board to approve a new programme by early 2024, which will catalysing vital financial assistance from donors. Portugal bailed the country out in December 2022, with a US$16m direct budgetary grant. Growth will remain subdued and average 2.7% in 2024-25, and inflation will remain very high, averaging 12% in the same period.\n\nRead more: São Tomé and IMF fail to agree on new funding programme\n\nRead more: São Tomé misses final disbursement under IMF programme"
