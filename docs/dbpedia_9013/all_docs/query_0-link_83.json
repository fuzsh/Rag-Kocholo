        "text": "The two main islands of São Tomé and Príncipe, along with several smaller islands, make up this small volcanic archipelago that sits in the southern part of the Gulf of Guinea. A six-hour flight from Europe will land you in Cidade de São Tomé, the country’s capital, located on the island of São Tomé. The official language is Portuguese, but most people in the tourism industry speak English well, among other languages.\n\nSão Tomé and Príncipe, once a leading cocoa producer, consists of two islands of volcanic origin and several smaller islets lying off the west coast of Africa. These two fascinating islands offer dramatic landscapes with torrents and waterfalls along its slopes, white and black sand beaches, sheer cliffs dropping into the sea, tropical forests filled with exotic birds, and extensive cocoa plantations with their beautiful colonial houses. For adventurous travelers, this unspoiled Atlantic gem is still Africa’s best-kept secret both above and below the water. The tropical scuba diving in São Tomé and Príncipe is pristine with much yet to discover."
