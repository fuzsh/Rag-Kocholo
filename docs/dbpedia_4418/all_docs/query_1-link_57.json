        "text": "Do you need to install an Ignition Interlock Device to regain your driving privileges and are wondering how does an Interlock Device work? Look no further! In this article, we’ll explain the ins and outs of these devices in a way that’s easy to understand. Smart Start, a leading provider of Ignition Interlock technology, is here to help you grasp the basics.\n\nWhat is an Ignition Interlock Device?\n\nTo understand how Ignition Interlock Devices work, it’s best to explain what it is and its purpose first.\n\nAn Ignition Interlock Device (IID), also called a car breathalyzer, is typically installed in your motor vehicle as part of a legal requirement after drunk driving. Looking for a reliable Ignition Interlock vendor? Smart Start has designed Ignition Interlock Devices that are compact and easy to use. They’re about the size of a smartphone and can be discreetly installed near the driver’s seat to avoid drawing attention.\n\nThe Ignition Interlock Device comes into play when you want to start your motor vehicle. It requires you to provide a breath sample before the engine can start. Simply blow into the mouthpiece, and if your breath sample falls within the allowed limits, your car will start without any issues.\n\nHow does an Ignition Interlock Device work?\n\nAn Ignition Interlock Device is installed in a motor vehicle and measures the driver’s breath alcohol concentration (BrAC). Users provide their breath sample into the device’s mouthpiece. If a breath sample is provided with alcohol present in the user’s system, the vehicle will not start. The vehicle will only start after a passing breath sample. Accurately measuring your Breath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) is important for Ignition Interlock testing. Smart Start’s devices use advanced fuel cell technology to achieve precise and reliable BrAC measurements.\n\nWhat’s the difference between BrAC and Blood Alcohol Content?\n\nExplaining Ignition Interlock Tests\n\nPart of understanding how Ignition Interlock Devices work is knowing that there are two different types of tests: the initial test and random rolling retests.\n\nInitial tests\n\nWhen you enter your vehicle and place your key in the ignition, or push the start button, you must provide an acceptable breath sample into your Ignition Interlock. You’ll find that, depending on the Interlock provider you chose, there are specific breathing, humming and/or suck-back patterns you need to fulfill to provide a passing sample into your device. Smart Start will not offer unsanitary breath test patterns like sucking back! Read more about our easy Ignition Interlock test patterns on the blog.\n\nThese breath patterns ensure it is an actual person taking the test, preventing ‘workarounds’ or bypassing attempts. With Smart Start, we provide the easiest and most sanitary breath testing patterns.\n\nIn any case, initial tests prove you are sober and safe to drive. Upon a passing breath sample, your vehicle will successfully start and you can begin your trip.\n\nRandom rolling retests\n\nRemember that throughout your drive you’ll need to continue proving your sobriety. That’s why the Ignition Interlock Device will randomly prompt for a breath sample during your trip. These tests are commonly referred to as random rolling retests.\n\nRandom rolling retests do NOT shut off your vehicle during your drive. If a random rolling retest is skipped, missed or failed, the consequences differ in every state in the United States. However, an Ignition Interlock will never turn off your vehicle as a result.\n\nSmart Start recommends pulling over and parking safely to perform your random rolling retest. Once you provide an acceptable breath sample, you can continue with your drive.\n\nThe Importance of Regular Device Calibration\n\nRegular breathalyzer calibration is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of your Ignition Interlock Device. State Authorities require calibration every 30 to 90 days, depending on which state you live in and which device you have.\n\nDuring calibration, a technician will check your Ignition Interlock system, perform any necessary updates, and download test data to share with the authorities. Calibration usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes and can be done at any of Smart Start’s 1,800+ service center locations. The device will alert you when it needs service. Missing an appointment may prevent your car from starting, so make sure to visit a Smart Start service center to unlock it. Some jurisdictions may even provide a temporary unlock code for you to drive to the service location.\n\nHow does a temporary unlock code work?\n\nUnderstanding Your Ignition Interlock\n\nWhile Ignition Interlock Devices are designed to be user-friendly, there might still be things you’re unsure about, especially when starting your Interlock program or dealing with local DUI laws and regulations.\n\nThat’s why Smart Start offers exceptional customer care, available 24/7/365. Our knowledgeable professionals are ready to answer your questions and provide assistance throughout the entire process to help you gain back your driving privilege.
