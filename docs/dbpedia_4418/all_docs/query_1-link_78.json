        "text": "Electronic Ignition vs. Standing Pilot Light: Which is Better?\n\nUnderstanding the Differences\n\nElectronic ignition and standing pilot light are two ways to ignite burners in natural gas appliances. The main difference is that electronic ignition uses an electric spark to ignite the gas when the appliance is turned on, while a standing pilot light is a small flame that remains lit continuously.\n\nIn recent years, electronic ignition has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency and energy-saving benefits, as it only uses gas when needed.\n\n“Can I still use my fireplace, cooktop, or water heater when the power goes out?”\n\nNatural gas appliances and fireplaces have traditionally used a standing pilot light to ignite the flame/heat source. Because these systems do not rely on external electricity, they work seamlessly even if the power goes out for an extended period of time.\n\nNewer generations of gas fireplaces and appliances use an electronic ignition system. This does require electricity to start up. In the event of a power outage, a battery backup system will allow you to continue lighting your fireplace/using an appliance.\n\nDid you know? A 24/7 pilot light costs about $8-10 each month to run.\n\nElectronic ignition eliminates this cost. An additional perk is that you may qualify for a rebate and/or a tax credit. Be aware when purchasing a new appliance or fireplace that there is no way to retrofit an electronic ignition system to a fireplace or appliance that is designed to work with a pilot light.\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nHow to operate your natural gas fireplace during a power outage\n\nDid you know a natural gas fireplace can keep you warm even when the power is out? We’re here at NW Natural Appliance Center to show you how to access the battery backup for a natural gas fireplace.\n\nMake sure the fireplace is off and cold before accessing the battery module.\n\nRemove the metal front by lifting up and out. If your fireplace has a decorative louver, it may be hinged down to access the area under the fireplace.\n\nLook for the battery tray which will be connected to the fireplace by a series of wires. Some of these trays are completely removable. But it’s best to leave it in place so you don’t lose it.\n\nMake a note of what size batteries you need and keep a supply of backups on hand.\n\nThere may be a manual switch on the fireplace or on a nearby wall. Set it to the “on” position.\n\nOnce the batteries are in place the fireplace should start with the manual switch or the fireplace’s remote.\n\nTuck the tray back into place and replace the front.\n\nOutside of power outages, it’s best to avoid storing batteries in the battery tray. Once your power returns, turn the fireplace off, let it cool, and remove the batteries following the steps above.\n\nPlan to have your fireplace serviced annually and ask your technician for details about your specific model.\n\nHow to operate your natural gas cooktop during a power outage\n\nEven when the power’s out, you can cook on most models of natural gas cooktops available at NW Natural Appliance Center.\n\nWhen you turn the knob on your cooktop, the “click-click-click” you hear is the electronic igniter trying to light the natural gas burner. When there’s no power, you won’t hear this clicking sound.\n\nTo get cooking again, all you need is a long-handled lighter — they’re available in most stores and online.\n\nClick the lighter on and place the tip near the burner you want to light.\n\nTurn the knob to “light” — and that’s it!\n\nTo be safe, always double-check to make sure the burner is turned off when you’re finished cooking.\n\nHow to operate your natural gas water heater during a power outage\n\nMost gas water heaters (models with tanks and tankless units) can operate during a power outage. Gas water heaters should function during a power outage as long as the pilot light remains lit. If your pilot happens to go out, however, review your hot water heater’s manual to see how to relight it.\n\nSome tank hot water heaters may have special features that require electricity. If this is the case, a battery backup may be a good solution for your home. In addition, tankless hot water heaters do need electricity to operate. The best thing to do is invest in a battery backup for your tankless water heater — before the winter storms come! A battery backup charges while the power is on and then operates automatically during a power outage.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the advantages of using electronic ignition?\n\nThe main advantage of using electronic ignition is that it’s more energy-efficient than standing pilot light, which can save on energy bills by eliminating the need for a constantly burning flame.\n\nCan electronic ignition fail?\n\nIssues with electronic ignition are very rare. In fact, electronic ignition is generally considered to be more reliable than standing pilot light.\n\nWhat happens if the power goes out with electronic ignition?\n\nSome models have a battery backup or can be manually lit with a match or lighter so you can still use your appliances when the power goes out.\n\nReady to learn more?\n\nCall us at (503) 220-2362 or contact NW Natural Appliance Center online to learn more about our selection of natural gas fireplaces, cooktops, and other appliances.
