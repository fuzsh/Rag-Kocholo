        "text": "Like in most land vehicles, an ignition switch enables you to activate the ignition system of your boat by connecting it to the source of power. In order to fulfill this task, two positions of the switch are enough, however, depending on the vessel's configuration, this part may have three or even four positions. Additional positions can be used for powering various accessories and auxiliary systems which can be employed even when the engine is not running. For instance, a typical four-position switch features the Accessory, Off, On, and Start modes.\n\nIn our online store, you can choose from numerous switches available in different kinds and designs. Some of them come with a key, while others have a push-pull or push-button system, aside from lanyard kill switches used to automatically stop a boat if the helmsman suddenly falls overboard. Other factors to consider are the number of keys you need and the thickness of your boat's dashboard panel in which you're going to install the switch. Made of corrosion-resistant materials with quality in mind, our boat ignition switches meet the highest industry standards and are meant to serve for years to come."
