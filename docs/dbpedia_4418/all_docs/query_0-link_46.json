        "text": "Is there no spark in the engine of your lawn mower, snow blower or outdoor power equipment? Follow this guide to test your ignition system - including coil, switch & module - to identify any problems and troubleshoot repairs.\n\nIf you know your specific problem, jump down to the section for step-by-step instructions.\n\nHow Do Ignition Systems Work in Small Engines & Lawn Mowers?\n\nServicing Spark Plug Problems\n\nHow to Test the Ignition Coil in Your Small Engine\n\nTesting & Replacing a Stop Switch\n\nIgnition Module Failure\n\nHow To Inspect the Flywheel & Key\n\nThe ignition system is the starting system for your small engine. Whether you start the engine with a pull rope or the turn of a key on an electric start motor, you're relying on the ignition system to produce a spark inside the combustion chamber.\n\nSmall Engine Ignition Parts\n\nFlywheel with magnets\n\nCoil or Armature\n\nPush Button starting or Pull Cords (depending on your engine type)\n\nSpark Plug Lead\n\nSpark Plugs\n\nWhen you start your lawn mower or small engine, you turn the flywheel and its magnets pass the coil (or armature). This creates a spark. The ignition system coordinates the timing so that the spark will ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber just as it reaches maximum compression in each engine cycle- thus, maximizing the engineâ€™s power.\n\nOnce the engine is running, the flywheel keeps rotating, the magnets keep passing the coil and the spark plug keep firing based on a specific timing.\n\nTypes of Ignition Systems\n\nSolid-state systems: the more modern option, these systems use a tiny transistor in the coil or armature to close the electrical circuit that travels through the spark plug lead to the spark plug(s).\n\nBreaker point systems: used on engines made before 1980, these systems use a mechanical switch instead of a transistor to close the electrical circuit used to produce a spark.\n\nCommon Flywheel Problems\n\nIf you are experiencing ignition timing issues, this is most often due to a sheared flywheel key. You can also test the flywheel magnets for any potential issues.\n\nFor information regarding this, please visit our Inspecting the Flywheel and Key FAQ.\n\nCommon Spark Plug Problems\n\nThe required spark plug gap and voltage can vary depending on temperature, altitude and your engine settings.\n\nOld, damaged or fouled spark plugs can also require service or replacement"
