        "text": "An Ignition Interlock is a device installed on motor vehicles to prohibit individuals from operating the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. It requires the driver to provide a breath sample before the engine will start and the driver is periodically required to provide breath samples while driving.\n\nFor safety reasons, the vehicle will not shut off if the driver fails a breath test while driving. However, the device records the event and, depending on the circumstances, could prevent the vehicle from re-starting once stopped.\n\nPre-Trial Diversion or Preferred Prosecution Programs:\n\nIID Term: Length of Program License Suspension/Revocation: Stayed\n\n**The Court can Order the Ignition Interlock as a requirement of these programs**\n\nUpon 1st Conviction:\n\nBlood Alcohol Content (BAC) < 0.15\n\nIID Term: 90 Days License Suspension/Revocation: 90 Days\n\n**Entire suspension is stayed if ignition interlock is voluntarily elected and installed**\n\nBlood Alcohol Content (BAC) > 0.15\n\nIID Term: 1 Year License Suspension/Revocation: 90 Days\n\n**Mandatory Ignition Interlock, suspension stayed w/proof of IID installation**\n\nUpon 2nd Conviction:\n\nIID Term: 2 Years License Suspension/Revocation: 1 Year\n\n**After serving 45 days of suspension or revocation, mandatory ignition interlock**\n\nUpon 3rd Conviction:\n\nIID Term: 3 Years License Suspension/Revocation: 3 Years\n\n**After serving 60 days of suspension or revocation, mandatory ignition interlock**\n\nUpon 4th or Subsequent Conviction:\n\nIID Term: 4 Years License Suspension/Revocation: 5 Years\n\n**After serving 1 year suspension or revocation, mandatory ignition interlock**\n\nRefusals:\n\nIID Term: Additional 1 year License Suspension/Revocation: Varies per Offense\n\n**One additional year is added to the Ignition Interlock Term, except on 1st Conviction**\n\nExceptions:\n\nAdditional time may be imposed when certain factors exist:\n\nConviction is prior to July 1, 2018\n\nPassenger under the age of 14 was in the vehicle at time of offense\n\nDriver Refused the Chemical Test\n\nA crash occurred where another person was injured\n\nDriver had a BAC of .15 or higher\n\nUpon conviction, whether the use of an IID is elective or mandatory, the Judge will sign and forward an Order to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA).\n\nThe Offender shall have an approved IID installed in their vehicle and provide proof of installation to the ALEA to obtain the required ignition interlock restricted driver license. There is a $150 fee for this driver license.\n\nThe offender shall remain in compliance of the ignition interlock requirement for the duration of the IID Term, which begins upon issuance of the Ignition Interlock restricted driver license and based off the law. The IID Term may not be the same as any restriction periods imposed by the court. Any violations committed during the mandated ignition interlock period shall extend the duration of IID Term use for six months.\n\nThe device can only be removed upon completion of the IID Term and when the court of conviction confirms to the ALEA that the offender has successfully completed all requirements and no longer subject to the ignition interlock device requirement."
