        "text": "Push button Start Modules\n\nDelta Systems has supplied the outdoor power equipment industry with key ignition switches over the past 25 years. We now provide a solution for customers desiring an automotive-style push button ignition switch that is fully sealed from harsh environments such as rain, ice, snow and debris. Features include a removeable actuator that controls switch operation, an illuminated button, and a 3-year warranty. The panel cut out is the same as our key-on ignition switches.\n\nRotary Ignition Switch\n\nDelta Systemsâ€™ rotary ignition switches are used to start and stop small internal combustion engines and electric vehicles and to switch accessories on and off by controlling the make and break of up to seven connections. Both nut and snap mount are available. Snap-in models have a bezel that can include molded or printed graphics and can be customized to match your panel. Switch actuation is by a non-coded key. Two, three, and four position switches are available with a variety of standard circuit configurations."
