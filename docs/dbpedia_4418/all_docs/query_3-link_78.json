        "text": "Fuel and Ignition System\n\nHow does my vehicle's fuel system work?\n\nYour vehicle's fuel system works to provide fuel to your car's engine as needed, to keep your vehicle running smoothly. The fuel system is made up of several parts, including the fuel tank, filter, pump, fuel lines, and the injections or carburetor. Over time, buildup forms on these fuel system parts which can cause the system to slow down. This is why it is so important to periodically bring your vehicle to Jamie's Tire & Service in Fairborn. We've been repairing cars since 1975 and are very familiar with all parts of your fuel system.\n\nYour vehicle's fuel pump sends fuel from the gas tank to your car's engine. Some vehicles, including Chevrolet, Honda, Toyota, and Volkswagen, have multiple pumps and tanks so ensure you always have fuel when driving on different terrains, such as when taking a sharp turn or driving on a steep incline. The fuel pump also has fuel lines that send fuel from the tank to the engine, where it is combusted. To make sure the proper amount of fuel is distributed to the engine when needed, your vehicle has an electronically operated gate called a fuel injector that opens just long enough to meter the perfect amount of fuel to run the engine.\n\nHow does fuel injection work?\n\nWe at Jamie's Tire & Service in Fairborn are very familiar with how fuel injection works. In order for your vehicle's engine to run smoothly, it needs to be provided with the proper ratio of fuel to air. A fuel injector is an electronically controlled valve that supplies fuel from the fuel pump to the vehicle's engine. The fuel injector is capable of opening and closing multiple times a second. When the injector is activated, an electromagnet moves a plunger that opens the valve, allowing pressurized fuel to squirt out through a tiny nozzle. The nozzle is designed to make the fuel as fine a mist as possible so that it can burn easily. The fuel injector is controlled by the vehicle's engine control unit or ECU.\n\nHow does a vehicle's ignition system work?\n\nWhen your engine mixes air and fuel, it adds a spark to create an explosion. This spark is referred to as the ignition. The ignition system consists of an ignition coil, distributor, distributor cap, rotor, plug wires, and spark plugs. Here's a brief overview of what each of these parts does:\n\nThe ignition coil takes your relatively low battery power and turns it into a spark powerful enough to ignite fuel vapor.\n\nThe distributor is a spinner that distributes sparks to the appropriate spark plug at the right time. It does this through a spinning electrical contact called the rotor.\n\nThe spark plug makes a nice big, blue spark that ignites the fuel and air mixture and creates combustion.\n\nYour vehicle's ignition system repeats this process thousands of times per minute as you drive. It is integral that each part of your fuel and ignition systems work smoothly. If you are experiencing any trouble with your vehicle, don't hesitate to bring it to Jamie's Tire & Service in Greene and Montgomery today.
