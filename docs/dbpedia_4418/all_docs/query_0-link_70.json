        "text": "What is an Ignition Interlock Device (IID)?\n\nAn IID is a small, handheld breathalyzer for car ignitions that’s installed to prevent users from being able to start their vehicle after drinking alcohol. Sometimes they’re referred to as car breathalyzers, or as a breath alcohol ignition interlock device (BAIID). They’re small, about the size of a TV remote.\n\nHow Long Do I Need an Ignition Interlock Device?\n\nEach state has its own ignition interlock law that determines when to install the device, how long it will need to be installed, what type of IID you need, what monitoring authority will oversee your IID requirement (probation officer, court, DMV, DOT, etc.) and more. Because each state varies, Intoxalock staffs state specialists who know exactly what you need to get your license back.\n\nAfter you’ve successfully completed your IID requirement, you’ll be allowed to remove the device and reinstate your license. The process for removal varies from state to state, with some requiring you to receive approval from your monitoring authority, some requiring you to call your DOT for an eligibility date or more. Our customer support can help you understand what your state requires to remove the device.\n\nView State Requirements Call Now 877-272-5195\n\nEvery device varies, but all require users to submit a breath sample in order to test their Breath Alcohol Content, or BrAC. Intoxalock ignition interlocks feature a one-button operating system, which helps reduce errors.\n\nTo use an Intoxalock IID:\n\nPress the button and wait for the device to indicate it is ready\n\nSubmit your breath sample using the proper method. Your technician will show you how to use the device at installation, but if you are unsure, Intoxalock has a variety of resources and our state specialists are happy to answer any questions.\n\nWait for the results. If you pass, you will be able to start your vehicle.\n\nIf you fail, you will need to wait to re-test. Be aware that some many states will automatically lock you out of your device following multiple repeated failures in a row.\n\nWhile a failed sample means you won’t be able to start your car, you can be assured the device will NOT be able to turn off your car once it is running. Once your vehicle has been started, no ignition interlock device is able to turn it off. If you fail a random retest, your vehicle will remain on until you remove the keys from the ignition. At this point, your device may lock you out.\n\nIgnition interlock devices are intended to prevent drivers from starting their vehicle after they’ve been drinking alcohol. Therefore, your car will only start if your breath sample passes.\n\nEach state handles failed breath samples differently. While all states allow you to retest a new breath sample after a waiting period, some have a retest limit. If you hit that limit, you’ll get locked out after multiple failed attempts. Other states allow you to keep submitting samples until one passes."
