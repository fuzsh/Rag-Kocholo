        "text": "I've been trying to diagnose an ignition problem where my boat will try to start while it is already running. Even if I turn off the engine and leave the key in the \"run\" position it will eventually/sporadically start up on it's own. I'm thinking this is probably the ignition switch itself so I'd like to try replacing it to see if that helps. Could someone identify the ignition switch based on these photos? It is a turn key ignition (without push choke) that goes to a 2007 Mercruiser 5.0 220hp 305.\n\nAlso, bonus question, what is the small button located aft of the engine compartment blower switch?\n\nAttachments\n\nphoto244961.JPG\n\nphoto244962.JPG\n\nphoto244963.JPG\n\nphoto244964.JPG\n\nphoto244965.JPG\n\nphoto244966.JPG\n\nphoto244967.JPG\n\nphoto244968.JPG\n\nphoto244969.JPG\n\nFor the ignition switch, can the switch it self come out of the housing ( part with the square on the bottom )? If so, it looks to be a standard Mercruiser 5 wire ignition switch. Something like this part number - 87-17009A 5 - Switch Assembly. If not, it may be a custom switch unique to your 2007 Princecraft Vacanza 220.\n\nAs far as the button aft of the blower switch, no idea. I looked at the owners manual for your boat and did not see it. You will have to trace the wires and report back on what you find.\n\nWhile your key switch looks like a three position, do you know if it is a 3 or 4 position key switch? There are two key switch models with different cut out hole sizes. 3/4 and 7/8 inch. While unlikely but just to be sure, is the engine digital throttle shift?\n\nYours looks to be the following... Mercury/Mercruiser New OEM Ignition Key Switch & Harness arnuber 87-897716K01 http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_fro...on+Key+Switch+&+Harness+87-897716K01&_sacat=0\n\n87-897716K01 is a three position key switch with shorter key and mounting length. (Off, Run, Start) Loose switch only. 3/4\" cut out. Includes switch with decal and washer. Can be used on DTS as well as Non DTS installations.\n\nIf it was to be a four position switch with DTS, had a 7/8 inch hole cutout and a longer key switch then part number 87-893353A02 would of been needed, http://www.ebay.com/itm/141646675591\n\nBe sure to mount the switch with the drain hole in the down position.\n\nThe 827 number on the side is for matching the key number so should you have lost your key you could order just a new key using the 827 (87-897716827) vs buying a new switch...\n\nCan't make out the switch symbol... Does it look like this below? If not, then here' a good selection of switches to sort through, http://greatlakesskipper.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Switches&cat=\n\nFor the ignition switch, can the switch it self come out of the housing ( part with the square on the bottom )?

It does come out of the housing, along with a harness and connector. I was beginning to think that the ignition switch is kind of a generic, non-specific, part that could be replaced so long as it was a 3 position, 5 wire, switch."
