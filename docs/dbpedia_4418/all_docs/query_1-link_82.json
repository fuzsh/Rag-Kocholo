        "text": "Introduction:\n\nThe ignition system provides the spark to ignite the mixture in the cylinders\n\nMost small aircraft use a direct-cranking electric starter system\n\nThe systems consists of:\n\nMagnetos\n\nSpark Plugs\n\nIgnition Switch\n\nSolenoids\n\nStarter/Starter Motor\n\nWires link the system all together\n\nTogether, the system enables starting an aircraft's engine\n\nMost standard certificated aircraft incorporate a dual ignition system with two individual magnetos, separate sets of wires, and two spark plugs per cylinder to increase reliability of the ignition system through redundancy\n\nThis is designed so if one magneto or spark plug fails, the other is unaffected and will continue to run normally, with a slight decrease in power\n\nIn a spark ignition engine the ignition system provides a spark that ignites the fuel/air mixture in the cylinders and is made up of magnetos, spark plugs, high-tension leads, and the ignition switch [Figure 1]\n\nMagnetos:\n\nMagnetos are self-contained engine-driven units to supply electrical current to the spark plugs\n\nA permanent magnet is used to generate this current completely independent of the aircraft's electrical system\n\nThe magneto generates sufficiently high voltage to jump a spark across the spark plug gap in each cylinder\n\nThe system begins to fire when the starter is engaged and the crankshaft begins to turn\n\nIt continues to operate whenever (or however) the crankshaft is rotating\n\nSee more in the hand propping section\n\nEach magneto operates independently to fire one of the two spark plugs in each cylinder\n\nMagneto Checks:\n\nMagneto checks test the ignition system's operation and are a critical element to ground checklists\n\nWhen checking magnetos there a few conditions must be satisfied to ensure proper functionality:\n\nThe magneto grounding wires are connected\n\nIf not connected, there will be no drop in RPM when that magneto is selected\n\nThe drop in RPM falls within the recommended limits as defined in the Pilot Operating Handbook\n\nA drop, but continued operation of the engine, ensures the aircraft can fly on a single magneto, albiet at reduced performance\n\nThe differential drop between magnetos is within limits as defined in the Pilot Operating Handbook\n\nExcessive differentials demonstrate a malfunction in one of the magnetos\n\nIf the drop is greater than the recommended limits as defined in the Pilot Operating Handbook\n\nConsider running the engine to a cruise/near-cruise RPM and leaning to peak EGT\n\nRun lean of peak at high RPM for about 30 seconds\n\nIf magneto checks after a second or even third time, have the engine looked at by a mechanic\n\nIf equipped, pilots should also monitor EGT for a rise on all cylinders\n\nNote that when checking EGT, a drop in a single cylinder's EGT is one way to identify the malfunctioning magneto\n\nNo drop indicates there is a break in the grounding wire, and they will remain hot even when they are supposed to be off\n\nIf not grounded magnetos may fire while \"OFF,\" if the propeller rotates\n\nAny fuel that remains in the cylinders could ignite if the magnetos fire, causing serious injury to anyone around the propeller\n\nAlthough magneto checks are normally performed on the ground, they may also be performed in flight\n\nNote that aging magnetos can manifest themselves and provide a warning through hot starts, before ever performing the magneto check\n\nMagneto checks are usually performed before takeoff to:\n\nAllow the aircraft to warm up\n\nCheck condition prior to takeoff (taxi may foul)\n\nAvoid propwash concerns in the ramp area\n\nThe ignition switch is moved from BOTH to \"R\" (right) and \"L\" (left) to ensure a drop in Rotations Per Minute (RPM) occurs\n\nMoving the ignition switch to \"R\" means you're running on the right magneto\n\nMoving the ignition switch to \"L\" means you're running on the left magneto\n\nMechanically, it doesn't matter which side is checked first\n\nChecking the right magneto (two clicks to left) first means when checking the left second (one click to the left), it is less likely to accidentally select the left (not BOTH) magnetos following the check, often before takeoff\n\nFailed Magneto Checks:\n\nIf an anomoly in the magneto check occurs, the ignition system is not operating correctly\n\nAnomolies are not meeting one of the previous mentioned conditions during the check, or something unexpected excessive rough engine idling during the check\n\nA common culprit are the spark plugs\n\nPoor engine performance (rough idle) may be caused by fouled spark plugs which could be burned off with a few seconds of high idle and with a lean of peak mixture setting\n\nAnother cause for rough idle could be poor ignition timing\n\nLow EGTs and high CHTs are a likely corresponding indication\n\nElectronic Ignition:\n\nElectronic ignition systems are becoming more common, supplementing or all-out replacing magnetos\n\nThese systems maintain the same functionality, but change the interface from an ignition switch with magneto selection usually via a key, to push-start systems\n\nThese systems generally maintain aircraft performance as compared to those with magnetos, but reduce maintenance costs through the use of a more simple system\n\nSpark Plugs:\n\nSpark plugs provide the source of ignition\n\nEach cylinder has two spark plugs which improves combustion of the fuel/air mixture, results in a slightly higher power output, and provides redundancy\n\nIgnition Switch:\n\nThe operation of the magneto is controlled in the flight deck by the ignition switch [Figure 3]\n\nThe switch has five positions:\n\nOFF\n\nR (right)\n\nL (left)\n\nBOTH\n\nSTART\n\nWith RIGHT or LEFT selected, only the associated magneto is activated while BOTH uses the two simultaneously\n\nA malfunctioning ignition system can be identified during the pre-takeoff check by observing the decrease in rpm that occurs when the ignition switch is first moved from BOTH to RIGHT, and then from BOTH to LEFT\n\nThe permissible decrease is listed in the AFM or POH\n\nIf the engine stops running when switched to one magneto, the rpm drop exceeds the allowable limit, or no drop occurs, do not fly the aircraft until the problem is corrected\n\nThe cause could be fouled plugs, broken or shorted wires between the magneto and the plugs, or improperly timed firing of the plugs\n\nFollowing engine shutdown, turn the ignition switch to the OFF position\n\nEven with the ignition, battery, and master switches in the OFF position, if the ground wire between the magneto and the ignition switch becomes disconnected or broken, the engine could accidentally start if the propeller is moved with residual fuel in the cylinder because it requires no external power\n\nIf this occurs, the only way to stop the engine is to move the mixture lever to the idle cutoff position\n\nThe video below is an example of a magneto check\n\nAlways follow the procedures and limits listed in the AFM/POH for your aircraft when performing this check\n\n(i.e., 125 RPM is this aircraft's maximum drop, yours may be different)\n\nStarter/Starter Motor:\n\nStarting An Aircraft:\n\nMost aircraft have starters that automatically engage and disengage when operated, but some older aircraft have starters that are mechanically engaged by a lever actuated by the pilot\n\nThe starter engages the aircraft flywheel, rotating the engine at a speed that allows the engine to start and maintain operation\n\nElectrical power for starting is usually supplied by an on-board battery, but can also be supplied by external power through an external power receptacle\n\nWhen the battery switch is turned on, electricity is supplied to the main power bus bar through the battery solenoid\n\nBoth the starter and the starter switch draw current from the main bus bar, but the starter will not operate until the starting solenoid is energized by the starter switch being turned to the \"start\" position\n\nWhen the starter switch is released from the \"start\" position, the solenoid removes power from the starter motor\n\nThe starter motor is protected from being driven by the engine through a clutch in the starter drive that allows the engine to run faster than the starter motor [Figure 4]\n\nWhen starting an engine, the rules of safety and courtesy should be strictly observed\n\nClear the area visually and make a call, \"Clear prop!\"\n\nIn addition, the wheels should be chocked and the brakes set, to avoid hazards caused by unintentional movement\n\nWhen using a starter, don't hold the started for more than a few seconds or it can burn out due to excessive heat\n\nTo avoid damage to the propeller and property, the aircraft should be in an area where the propeller will not stir up gravel or dust\n\nCombustion:\n\nDuring normal combustion, the fuel/air mixture burns in a very controlled and predictable manner\n\nIn a spark ignition engine the process occurs in a fraction of a second\n\nThe mixture begins to burn at the point where it is ignited by the spark plugs, then burns away from the plugs until it is all consumed\n\nThis type of combustion causes a smooth build-up of temperature and pressure and ensures that the expanding gases deliver the maximum force to the piston at exactly the right time in the power stroke [Figure 5]\n\nAbnormal Combustion:"
