        "text": "Unlimited Design Clients\n\nBuilt to help individuals and teams work more quickly and effectively, the Ignition Designer comes standard with an unlimited number of design clients per license. You can launch an infinite number of Designers, and have multiple people work simultaneously on the same project without locking anyone out of shared project resources. This capability allows groups to build together seamlessly, so you can cut your project development time in half.\n\nEasily Design for Any Device\n\nWith Ignition Perspective®, you can easily design for a wide variety of applications that perform well at any screen size. The Perspective Module adds powerful mobile-responsive components and tools so you can easily create mobile-optimized screens that scale effortlessly to different sizes, all in one design environment.\n\nRapidly Build and Easily Customize Large Projects\n\nDevelop large applications in hours instead of weeks. Ignition's simple project inheritance file system makes it easy to define an overarching corporate project that shares resources such as templates, scripts, and themes across multiple applications. Changes made at the top level are inherited down to all projects that share that resource and those changes can also be overridden at the local level. This gives you the power to change projects system-wide with a single action, and the flexibility to keep site-specific projects customized to what works best locally.\n\nCreate Custom Graphics and Animations\n\nUse powerful 2D vector drawing tools to create any shape with a variety of line strokes, color fills, patterns, and gradients, or import your own Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). You can also choose from thousands of pre-designed graphics available in Symbol Factory. Plus, you can create animations for your projects and even animate individual layers of your graphics.\n\nAdd Dynamic, Data-Driven Symbols\n\nStreamline your development while adding beautiful graphics to your projects by using Perspective Symbols. All Perspective Symbols come with built-in animation, three distinct style options, and are easy to customize. With Perspective Symbols for valves, motors, pumps, and more, you can beautifully display your plant floor data in no time. No need to add layers or additional scripting — just drag, drop, configure and let Perspective Symbols do the rest.\n\nLearn more about Ignition Perspective\n\nPowerful Python Scripting\n\nEngine Built Right In\n\nWith the popular Python scripting engine fully integrated into Ignition, alongside an easy-to-use script builder, scripting in Ignition is powerful and effortless. Just point-and-click your way to your first Python script without having to type any code yourself, and create time-saving script modules, so you can write your code once and use it everywhere. Ignition gives you the full power of the entire Python scripting language to build practically any kind of application.\n\nHigh-Performance Tags\n\nEasily add custom properties and setpoints to any tag and subscribe directly to any tag attribute without scripting. With many customization options and seemingly instantaneous tag editing, moving, browsing, and importing, you can effortlessly handle huge amounts of tags without slowing your project down.\n\nExplore and Learn in the\n\nSample Project\n\nThe Designer includes a sample project for new users. The sample project lets you explore all the features and learn how to configure and use them. You can explore and change it as much as you want so you learn by deconstructing and experimenting with it.\n\nAdd Pre-Built Resources from the Ignition Exchange\n\nThe Ignition Exchange brings a community of ideas together in one place. Explore our constantly growing library of valuable resources and useful templates that will accelerate your development pipeline, built by engaged contributors from the worldwide Ignition user community.\n\nExplore the Exchange\n\nCreate Beautiful Projects\n\nIgnition makes it easy to create attractive projects, with a variety of display types and powerful CSS3 styles for changing the appearance and position of anything in your application. There is even a wide variety of clearly rendered fonts to choose from."
