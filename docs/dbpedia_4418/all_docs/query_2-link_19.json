        "text": "Push button starts are innovative features that are making the ignition key almost obsolete. However, not every vehicle comes with a push button start as standard equipment. The push button start helps you turn on your vehicle automatically, without having to turn an ignition key.\n\nHow Does Remote Start Work? Everything You Need to Know\n\nEASYGUARD EASYGUARD EC004 Smart RFID Car Alarm System Push Engine Start Button & Keyless Go System Fits for Most DC12V Cars\n\nNow 20% Off\n\nWhat Is a Push Button Start Key Fob?\n\nA push button start key fob is a button that allows drivers to start their engine by pressing it. That said, you won't be able to turn on your car if you don't apply your vehicle's brakes. Likewise, your push button start won't stop your engine if you don't put your gear in park.\n\nPush-button starts are only available on keyless ignition systems. Mercedes Benz was the first automobile brand to create keyless ignition systems on a large scale. Today, other premium car brands like Rolls Royce, Acura, and Lexus make their branded keyless fobs.\n\nAlthough keyless fobs are now quite popular, they are yet to dominate the market. Many affordable vehicle brands still use manual keys. Nevertheless, elderly drivers and arthritis patients are starting to prefer keyless ignition systems because of the difficulty they experience when trying to grip a car key.\n\nThe is unique to each car. Each key fob has a signal that links it to the ignition of the vehicle. As such, your car's ignition will only come on when you press the push button start of your original key fob. To activate your car's engine with your push-button start on your key fob, you must press the button within a few feet of where your vehicle is parked.\n\nThe benefits of push button start key fobs include:\n\nPush-button start key fobs protect your vehicle against theft. By ensuring that the ignition doesn't start until it receives a signal from its paired key fob, a keyless ignition system bars entry from car burglars.\n\nPush-button start fobs reduce the chances of car accidents. If you use a keyless ignition system, your engine won't start until you put your foot on your brake and press the push button start key fob. Such vehicles are less likely to work without their drivers' input.\n\nSome keyless ignition systems prevent drivers from locking their key fobs inside the car. These systems have alarms that set off whenever drivers abandon their key fobs in the trunk or inside the vehicle. Car brands with such alarm systems are Toyota, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Mazda, Ford, Honda, Nissan, and GM.\n\nKeyless ignition systems allow you to start your engine even when your key fob's battery is dead. The easiest way to unlock your car in such cases is to contact your manufacturer through their emergency service center. You can reach out to your carmaker via a phone call or on the brand's mobile app.\n\nSome premium brands even provide roadside assistance services to customers where they send a technician to unlock your vehicle for you. If you are lucky, your carmaker may even hide a substitute mechanical key inside your key fob. You can insert the substitute key into your vehicle's emergency port to open the car.\n\nDangers of Push Button Start Key Fobs\n\nHere are some disadvantages of push button start key fobs:\n\nSince most new vehicle models have noiseless engines, you can easily forget to switch off your engine when using a keyless ignition system. Drivers who use mechanical keys rarely face this problem because they can see the key inserted in the ignition system. However, users of push button start key fobs may leave their car without switching it off because the key fob is probably tucked into their pockets.\n\nA few drivers have sustained injuries because they forgot to put the gear in park before getting out of the vehicle. If you leave your car while it is in gear, your vehicle may spring forward, pull you, and launch itself into an obstacle or another vehicle.\n\nIt is easier to hack push button start key fobs than conventional keys. Tech-savvy car thieves can use artificial intelligence systems to pick the unique signal from the key fob and use it to unlock or even activate a vehicle's engine.\n\nHow to Choose a Push Start Button Kit\n\nHere are things to consider when buying a push start button kit/remote start kit:\n\nOperating range: It is important to consider the operating range of the kit as it determines the distance from which you can start your car remotely.\n\nMobile compatibility: Some push button start kits offer smartphone connectivity. This feature increases the utility of the device and allows you to lock, unlock, start, and switch off your car.\n\nManual cutoff switch: For added protection, some remote start devices come with a manual cutoff switch that allows you to shut off the car engine remotely. This is a useful feature, especially if your car is stolen.\n\nNumber of key fobs: You also have to consider the number of remote key fobs that come with the device. Most vendors include just one, but you may need more. So, remember this before settling for a product.\n\nHow to Use Your Push Button Start\n\nDisclaimer: The guidelines in this article are general and not meant to replace instructions for your specific vehicle. Please consult your owner's manual or repair guide before attempting repairs.\n\nTake the steps below to switch on your vehicle's engine with the push button start:\n\nStep on your vehicle's brake and hold it.\n\nPress the push button start on your key fob, and hold the button until your engine starts.\n\nTo turn off your car's engine, follow these steps:\n\nPut your vehicle in the park gear.\n\nPress and hold the push button start, and keep doing so until your engine goes off.\n\nHearst Autos Research, produced independently of the Car and Driver editorial staff, provides articles about cars and the automotive industry to help readers make informed purchasing choices.\n\nHearst Autos Research, produced independently of the Car and Driver Editorial staff, provides articles about cars and the automotive industry to help readers make informed purchasing choices."
