        "text": "In the event of a fire, we are all confronted with the decision of whether to fight the flames with an extinguisher or evacuate the building immediately. This is probably the most important decision you will face when a fire breaks out.\n\nIf you are not trained in portable extinguisher use, the answer is easy: you should evacuate, and never attempt to fight a fire if you do not have extinguisher training. If you are trained with extinguishers, however, there are many things to consider when deciding whether to fight or take flight.\n\nQuestions to Fight By\n\nAsk yourself these questions when determining whether to fight a fire with a portable extinguisher or evacuate the building.\n\nIs the fire small enough to be controlled by a portable extinguisher?\n\nThe time to use a portable extinguisher is during the early stages of a fire. Once a fire starts to spread, your best option is to evacuate the building.\n\nAm I safe from toxic smoke and gases?\n\nRemember that all fires produce carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless toxic gas. Many fires will produce other toxic gases in addition to carbon monoxide. If the fire is producing large amounts of smoke, or you suspect the fire involves a hazardous material, your best option is to evacuate the building\n\nDo I have an escape route?\n\nBefore attempting to extinguish a fire, always ensure you have a reliable escape route. If you are in a room or confined area, position yourself between the fire and the exit door. In other words, when you are facing the fire the exit door should be at your back, ensuring you are not trapped if the fire is not quickly extinguished.\n\nDo I have the right extinguisher?\n\nMake sure the extinguisher’s label indicates it is rated for use in fighting the type of fuel that is burning, and check if the extinguisher is fully charged. If the extinguisher is not fully charged, or is not the proper type, your best option is to evacuate the building. You can find information about extinguisher ratings in Know Your Fire Extinguisher ABCs.\n\nWhat do my instincts tell me?\n\nIf you do not feel comfortable trying to extinguish the fire, do not attempt to. Evacuate the building and let the fire department do their job. Remember: firefighters have equipment, training, and experience that you do not possess.\n\nFight the Fire\n\nIf you decide to attempt to extinguish the fire, take the following actions:\n\nActivate the fire alarm system to notify building occupants of the emergency\n\nNotify the university police or the Austin Fire Department of the fire by dialing 911 or instructing someone to else to call. Dialing 9 from university phones is NOT necessary.\n\nRemember: Do not attempt to extinguish a fire until these actions are completed\n\nPosition yourself between the fire and your escape route, approximately six to eight feet from the fire\n\nRemember the acronym PASS:\n\nP – Pull the pin that unlocks the operating handle\n\nA – Aim the extinguisher low at the base of the fire\n\nS – Squeeze the lever on the extinguisher to discharge the agent\n\nS – Sweep the nozzle or hose from side to side, and continue to sweep the extinguisher back and forth at the base of the flames until the fire is out or the extinguisher is empty\n\nIf your suppression efforts are unsuccessful…\n\nQuickly leave the room, and close the door behind you to confine the fire\n\nEvacuate the building, and, if possible, inform responding firefighters of the fire location and your suppression efforts.\n\nAfter the Fire is Out…\n\nMonitor conditions for at least 30 minutes to ensure the fire does not reignite.\n\nMaintain a reliable escape route until the possibility of re-ignition no longer exists\n\nAvoid exposure to the extinguishing agent, because inhalation of the agent may irritate your respiratory system\n\nTake Flight\n\nIf you do not attempt to extinguish the fire, your only course of action is to evacuate the building. During evacuation you should take the following actions:"
