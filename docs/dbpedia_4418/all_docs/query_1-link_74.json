        "text": "2017-2024 Scout Keyed Ignition\n\nScout, Scout Sixty and Scout Bobber models have an ignition/light key switch located on the ignition cover on the left side of the motorcycle (1). The ignition/light key switch controls the electrical functions of the motorcycle.\n\nThe switch has three positions: OFF (2), RUN (3) and PARK (4).\n\nTurn the ignition switch to the OFF position and remove the ignition key when leaving your motorcycle unattended.\n\nPush the key into the ignition switch while turning it to the PARK position, In PARK, the taillight, indicator lights and license plate light illuminate. Vehicle powered accessories (if equipped) can be operated and the instrumentation is active. The ignition key can be removed.\n\n2025 Scout Keyed Ignition\n\nSome Scout models have an ignition switch located on the ignition cover on the left side of the motorcycle. Turn the ignition switch to the OFF position and remove the ignition key when leaving the motorcycle unattended.\n\nThe key switch has 2 positions: OFF (1) and RUN (2).\n\nSome models are equipped with a power switch (3) that utilizes a key fob (4). If the motorcycle is moving and the engine is running, press and hold the power switch for three seconds or more to disable all electrical power. For more information about the key fob, read Keyless Ignition Operation.\n\nFTR Keyed Ignition\n\nFTR 1200 models feature a keyed ignition.\n\nThe FTR 1200 ignition switch has four positions: Steering Lock (1), OFF (2), RUN (3) and PARK (4).\n\nIn PARK, the taillight, front position lamp, indicator lights and license plate light illuminate. Vehicle-powered accessories (if equipped) can be operated, and the instrumentation is active.\n\nWhen leaving the motorcycle unattended, use the Steering Lock position. Turn the ignition switch to OFF, push the key into the ignition while turning it to the LOCK position and remove the key. The handlebars will not be able to turn while the ignition is in LOCK.\n\nPARK Position\n\nOn motorcycles with a keyed ignition, the PARK setting is intended for emergency and low light conditions.\n\nWhen in PARK, the front parking light, taillight and hazard lights can remain on while the key is removed from the motorcycle.\n\nFor example, if you run out of gas along the side of a road at night, you can put your ignition in the PARK position to keep your bike visible without leaving the key in it.\n\nTo turn on the lights and put the bike in PARK, insert the key in the ignition and turn it clockwise to the RUN position. Then turn on your hazard lights, push the key inward and then turn it clockwise to the PARK position. Then remove the key.\n\nFor more information on your particular motorcycle, consult your Owner's Manual.\n\nFind a dealer near you with the Dealer Locator.\n\nTo find diagrams and replacement part numbers, use the online parts catalog."
