        "text": "Hi Tommy,\n\nThis is a very interesting question. Out of curiosity, why are you asking?\n\nOne of the most well known examples is Inductive Automation’s CRM. It is an Ignition project.\n\nThis related topic might be interesting:\n\nviewtopic.php?p=39432\n\nBesides some SCADA, we are using it to:\n\n-step by step Production Process tracking & analysis (not connected to a machine) based on operator input\n\n-Product Shipping notifier (emails certain people when the shipper presses a button)\n\n-Complete statistical analysis of Operator performance metrics\n\n-Virtual Area Board management system (virtual factory)\n\n-Combined statistical report of important product quality metrics\n\nand some other things (FFT analysis, but that’s complicated). I’ve thought about using it at home to log things, and also maybe with an Arduino, but haven’t had the time to put into that…yet…\n\nThank you all for your replies!!\n\nI’m looking at several possible applications, but one that particurlarly interests me is a child check-in/check-out kiosk at our kids church facility. We’d like to tie it to our member database and possibly display photos when an RFID device is swiped… Our pastor and staff want to make sure that we keep our kids as safe as possible!!\n\nI’m also interested in inventory tracking applications with barcode readers as well.\n\nI’ve got many SCADA related examples here in my own world (Oil & Gas), but I’m interested in what Ignition can do for me in other areas that I am involved in outside of work…\n\nI have had a couple of conversations with a hospital administrator that I know and I can’t find any reason that would prevent Ignition being used in a hospital (perhaps compliance with special regulations)\n\nFrom a data perspective, a patient is just a consumer of services and a data producer. basic things like location tracking, drug list, drug usage (drug limits and alarming for failure to dispense?) temperature and blood pressure trending and reminders. drug track and trace. surgical tool track and trace. I know its very complicated but it could be an interesting project for anyone brave enough"
