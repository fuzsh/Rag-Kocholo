        "text": "I'm also working on a 1980 Scout II with a ralley wheel wanting to repair a faulty switch or the rod. The key position for starting seemed to advance its self on a clock face from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock where by you had to contort your wrist before it would start. Well it finally failed to start.\n\nThe first thing that is confusing is that there is no lock plate as shown in my repair manual and I also do not see a snap ring.\n\nPictured here is where I'm at and my question is does this cancelling cam suppose to just pull of? the broken part of it leads me to beleive the po tried to pry it off and broke the edge.\n\nAny help appreciated,\n\nmjolnir\n\nAttachments\n\ncancelling cam 035.jpg\n\nThe cancelling cam (yellow) is a tight \"slip fit\" on the steering shaft.\n\nDisconnect the battery (which I hope is already done).\n\nSince it has not come off easily, you May want to put a couple drops of wd-40 or similiar around the steering shaft.\n\nThe metal rig around the shaft looks to be part of the cam -- sometimes they are separate (other old vehicles).\n\nWith two slim bladed screw drivers pry very carefully and slowly at opposite sides and you should be able to work it free without further damage eventually.\n\nFrom the point of view of when the vehicle was new, you would just grasp the cam with your fingers and lift straight with the shaft and it would just slide off. But, we are past the \"when it was new\" with these vehicles...\n\nRobert:\n\nthe clip can't be seen unless you press down the cancelling cam. I'm wondering if the cancelling cam is stout enough to press against to overcome the upper bearing preload spring. If its not I'll be looking for a plan \"b\". Actually I still need a plan \"a\" or a idea for a tool to do the job. I guess I will modify the type shown in the manual.\n\nHoping dilinan will jump in here.\n\nThere are snap ring pliers -- different types to \"open\" (and install) the different types of rings.\n\nSears or a real good hardware store May be the best choice. Imo, the \"generic brand\" parts stores do not have much selection. You can look at sears.com...\n\nSome rings are just an open metal ring -- the tool has small \"flat tabs\" that you place in the opening and then press the pliers which will open the ring enough to get it off.\n\nOther snap rings have \"ends\" with small holes -- another kind of plier has different sets of \"tips\" and you use the tip that tightly fits the ring you are trying to remove.\n\nWear safety glasses because sometimes the ring can \"fly off\"...\n\nI had to purchase a tool to press down on the preloaded spring in order to remove the snap riing. I tried several times before admitting defeat to the spring and buying the tool. It was only $11 dollars and should be available at most auto parts stores. It's called a steering wheel lock plate tool remover and installer. The retainig ring on my truck was a simple wire type and I was able to remove it simply enough with two small straight screwdrivers. After that, use great care in pulling the turn signal cam out so you don't break any wires. I was able to pull mine loose enough to get access to the release for the ignition switch cylinder. You will need a small bladed screwdriver to get to the release. There is an access hole right beneath the top right, cast screw hole. I found another thread on this forum that had pics to locate the hole. It was very useful or I would have never found it. It was under basic tech questions and titled replacing ignition lock cylinder. Hope this helps.\n\nDan\n\nRobert & dan:\n\nI made the tool last night and got the snap ring off this morning.\n\nDan; a couple questions: did your's look exactly like my 1st pic? I'm thinking that is the way all the 1980's are which is different than what is shown in the repair manual?\n\nSecond ? Was the ring above the yellow canceling cam: again my manual shows it below the yellow canceling cam on the exploded view. I'll just go back the way I found it as I never had any issues.\n\nJust wondering if its a 1980's thing or a po thing.\n\nThanks for everyones help. At least I haven't broken anything yet while I'm trying to fix it. Of course I'm not done yet\n\nAttachments\n\nsteering wheel 002.jpg\n\nRobert & dan:\n\nI'm thinking that is the way all the 1980's are which is different than what is shown in the repair manual?\n\nYour statement (above) and the statements of a couple other people plus my experience with the rear brakes (just looking) of my 1210 t/a leads me to believe that\n\nthe service manuals are a \"guide\" for fixing / repairing an IH vehicle -- not the end all / be all reference guide to every \"variation\" that exists among a large group of IH vehicles.\n\nTo find what your vehicle had stock from the factory (before po \"improvements\"), you need the parts manual for the vehicle along with the LST. The service manual May not be showing you the \"correct\" picture.\n\nSo, putting it back together as taken apart is the best plan.\n\nI have no idea, but there May be slight variations in the steering columns between different year scouts; maybe diesel scouts are slightly different from gas scouts... Maybe the cancelling cam / snap ring are the same for all Scout steering columns; maybe not...\n\nI had my t/a serviced at the dealer where I bought it. The first thinig they asked for was the LST (I did not know what it was). The parts guy used the LST to go against the parts book (microfiche in those days) to find the correct parts."
