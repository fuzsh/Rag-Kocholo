Jump to: news — teaching — talks — research.

In 2006 I received my Ph.D. from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. My advisor was the incomparable Silvio Micali.

My research interests include cryptography, lattices, coding theory, algorithms, and computational complexity. A particular focus is on cryptographic schemes whose security can be based on the apparent intractability of lattice problems. Further information may be found in my research summary.
