Germany is considered one of the most democratic societies in the world today, assuming the position of moral leader in Europe as it embraces hundreds of thousands of refugees. These developments could not have been imagined in 1945. Through personal stories, the film explores the country's transformation from silence about the Holocuast to facing it head on.\n\nFlyer\n\nCharity as a Transformative Experience\n\nNovember 2, 2017\n\nThe Center hosted an interfaith colloquium organized by graduate students form the interfaith and inter-disciplinary seminar \"Poverty and the Poor: Between Justice and Charity\" The colloquium shared with the wider campus community the work of the seminar; brief presentations on the subject of charity as a transformative practice were followed by a panel discussion concerned with the personal experiences of seminar participants.\n\nFlyer\n\nThe Other Peace Process: Interreligious Dialogue, A View from Jerusalem\n\nRabbi Dr. Ron Kronish\n\nOctober 23, 2017\n\nRabbi Ron Kronish discussed his most recent book The Other Peace Process: Interreligious Dialogue, A View from Jerusalem and the issues it addresses: methods and messages of interreligious dialogue, the history and context of the political peace process, and peace-building educational initiatives in Israel and the surrounding region. He offered realism yet hope in addressing the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nFlyer\n\nLuther in America\n\nProf. Christine Helmer\n\nOctober 5, 2017\n\nProf. Christine Helmer, 2017-2018 Corcoran Chair in Christian-Jewish Relations, spoke at a Boisi Center luncheon on the topic of Luther in America. Searches in the twentieth century for the historical Luther can be seen as a development in viewing Luther from two confessional perspectives. The search for the \"Protestant Luther\" characterizes Luther scholarship in Germany beginning at the turn of the twentieth century, while the search for the \"Catholic Luther\" takes the ecumenical spirit of Vatican II as inspiration to see Luther as historically rooted in the Middle Ages. How have American Luther scholars contributed to an emerging understanding of Luther as Catholic theologian who loves philosophy? Prof. Helmer's talk reviewed recent scholarship on Luther in America to address these questions. This event was co-sponsored by the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life and the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning.\n\nShores of Light\n\nSeptember 25, 2017\n\nThe Center presented a screening of the film Shores of Light. The film tells the poignant, true story of thousands of displaced persons, Holocaust survivors, who arrived in Southern Italy on their way to the Land of Israel at the end of World War II. Local Italian Catholics, though poor and on the losing side of the war, welcomed them and displayed the ancient Italian tradition of kindness toward the downtrodden. In the beautiful setting of the Italian shore and through the kindness of the local Italian Catholics, the survivors began to recuperate and heal. About 350 Jewish couples married and hundreds of babies were born, a true testament to life and redemption after the Holocaust. The film revolves around three of those babies born, Rivka, Esther, and Shuni, both in Santa Maria de Leuca in 1946, as they return to their birthplace in search of the traces left behind by their parents and reconnect with those Italians who remember those days of resilience and hope on Italy's Shores of Light.\n\nFlyer\n\nArticle in The Heights, 10/1/2017\n\n2016-2017 Programs\n\nKings and Messiahs: Reconsidering Kingship in the Hebrew Bible, Judaism, and Christianity\n\nProf. Garrett Galvin\n\nApril 6, 2017\n\nProf. Garrett Galvin, O.F.M., Assistant Professor of Sacred Scripture at the Franciscan School of Theology in California, spoke in Prof. Andrew Davis' \"Book of Kings\" course, expanding our view of kingship in ancient Israel by adding the more positive perspectives of Chronicles and Psalms to the negative assessments of the Book of Kings. Since Israelite kingship is foundational for Jewish and Christian understandings of messiah, his expanded view helps us rethink some of the assumptions that lie behind the concept in each tradition.\n\nFlyer\n\nThe Gospel of John and Jewish-Christian Relations\n\nApril 2-3, 2017\n\nThe 2017 Corcoran Chair Conference\n\nThe Gospel of John is one of the most beloved books of the Christian canon, appreciated and admired for its sublime theology and poetic language. But the Gospel is also the source of potent anti-Jewish ideas, including the association of the Jews with the devil, that persist to this very day. By focusing on such diverse areas as art, film, music and liturgy, on thinkers such as Luther and Bultmann, on Protestant, Catholic as well as Orthodox Christianity, and, of course, on the Fourth Gospel itself, this conference considered the role that the Gospel has played and continues to play in Jewish-Christian relations.\n\nFlyer\n\nConference Program\n\nThe Music of the Psalms: From King David's Time to Our Own\n\nRobert Cohen\n\nMarch 22, 2017\n\nMusic historian Robert Cohen delivered a musically rich presentation on the Psalms, which occupy a paramount place in the world's liturgy. His lecture addressed: What is it about their spiritual scope and emotional breadth that gives them such power? What can we learn from their language and poetry, and from the music of the Psalms: from the time of the Second Temple through the Renaissance, and from Colonial to contemporary America? And how do the diverse styles of their musical settings--cantorial and choral music; Hasidic and American folk; European and American classical; bluegrass and reggae; a cappella, gospel, and \"world music\"--speak to us and move us?\n\nFlyer\n\nThe Psalms: Jewish-Catholic Dialogue through Shared Praise\n\nAndrew R. Davis\n\nMarch 2, 2017\n\nAndrew Davis, Assistant Professor of Old Testament at Boston College, delivered a lecture exploring the Psalter as a valuable resource for Jewish-Christian dialogue. Christian readers of scripture have long been enlightened and inspired by Jewish exegesis, and today we have more opportunities than ever to read Scripture through the eyes of other faith traditions. Reading \"shoulder to shoulder\" with Jews is a way to learn the Psalms' significance in Jewish tradition and also to reflect in new ways about their importance for Christian faith.\n\nThe Confessions of the Flesh in the Foucault Archives\n\nAgustin Colombo\n\nFebruary 23, 2017\n\nCenter Visiting Scholar Agustin Colombo delivered a talk on the newly available personal archives of Michel Foucault. The presentation focused on the unpublished 4th volume of the History of Sexuality: \"The Confessions of the Flesh\" housed at the Fonds Foucault. It tackled the Augustinian problematization of desire (libido). By considering this particular point, the talk aimed to use a key topic of Foucault's unpublished book in order to better approach its relevance for the whole project of the History of sexuality and the new perspectives and readings that it opens. This talk took place in conjunction with the Center-sponsored research project \"Erotic-Spiritual Articulations of the Early Christian Way of Life: Foreshadowings of Anti-Judaism and Anti-Semitism?\"\n\nMark, Women, and the Representation of Judaism in Mark 5:21-43\n\nProf. Mary Rose D'Angelo\n\nFebruary 21, 2017\n\nAs part of the Center's Jewish-Christian Lecture Series, Prof. Mary Rose D'Angelo spoke in Prof. Angela Harkins' Gospel of Mark course.\n\nFlyer\n\nJesus of Hollywood\n\nAdele Reinhartz\n\nNovember 9, 2016\n\nProf. Adele Reinhartz, the 2016-2017 Corcoran Chair in Christian-Jewish Relations, delivered a film screening and talk to the Jewish-Christian Dialogue group titled \"Jesus of Hollywood.\" Since the advent of the cinema, Jesus has frequently appeared in our movie houses and on our television screens. Indeed, it may well be that more people worldwide know about Jesus and his life story from the movies than from any other medium. The talk examined a number of clips from the Jesus movies, to chart some of the different ways in which Jesus of Nazareth is remade into Jesus of Hollywood.\n\nTowards the Ends of the Earth: Land in the Jewish-Christian Dialogue\n\nThe Fifth Annual John Paul II Lecture in Jewish-Christian Relations\n\nRev. David Neuhaus, S.J.\n\nOctober 30, 2016\n\nFlyer\n\nLuncheon Talk by Prof. Dov Waxman\n\nSeptember 27, 2016\n\nProf. Dov Waxman of Northeastern University gave a talk to the Jewish-Christian Dialogue Group on his volume Trouble in the Tribe: The American Jewish Conflict Over Israel (Princeton, 2016). The talk and following conversation focused on chapter 1 \"The Changing American Jewish Relationship with Israel\" and chapter 3 \"The Argument About Israel.\" The book educates readers on the diversity of voices in the Jewish community, a need in contemporary Christian-Jewish dialogue.\n\nJesus' Sermon on the Mount: For the Law or Against the Law?\n\nSeptember 20, 2016\n\nAs part of the Center's Jewish-Christian Lecture Series, Prof. Jonathan Klawans spoke in Prof. Angela Harkins' \"Gospel of Matthew\" class, situating Jesus' teachings about the law in Matthew's Gospel within a broader late Second Temple context. In addition to his lecture, Prof. Klawans led students in a discussion of purity and the Temple in first-century Judaism.\n\nFlyer\n\n2015-2016 Programs\n\nEtty: A Play\n\nApril 27, 2016\n\nEtty is a play drawn from the diaries of Etty Hillesum, a poetic, young Dutch woman, searching for the meaning of her life--and all life--during the terror Nazi occupation. This performance at Boston College was co-sponsored by the Center and the Theology Department.\n\nPoster\n\nA Dedication Honoring Fr. Jakob Raile, S.J.\n\nApril 10, 2016\n\nThe Center hosted a dedication for Fr. Jakob Raile, S.J., who is recognized by Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Memorial Center as \"Righteous Among the Nations\" for having risked his life while saving hundreds of Hungarian Jews. Fr. James Bernauer, S.J., Kraft Family Professor and Center Director, delivered welcoming and introductory remarks. Prof. Deborah Dwork, Rose Professor of Holocaust History and Director of the Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University, spoke on the historical context and heroism of Fr. Raile's actions.\n\nFlyer\n\nBooklet\n\nFringe Benefits: Marginality and Identity in the Ancient Mediterranean World\n\n2016 Corcoran Chair Conference\n\nApril 3-4, 2016\n\nThis conference examined the ideas of \"hybrid identities\" and its component terms--hybridity and identity--by considering a selection of individuals and groups whose activities, allegiances, and/or ideas straddle the boundaries constructed by ancient Jewish, Christian, and pagan leaders.\n\nFlyer\n\nConference program\n\nA Catholic Society in Transition: Religion in Recent Quebec Films\n\nFebruary 16 and March 14, 2016\n\nProf. Adele Reinhartz, the 2015-2016 Corcoran Chair, hosted a two-part film series, featuring films from Quebec that relate, in different ways, to the rapid transformation of Quebec society from one of the most traditionally Catholic societies in the world to one of the most secular. One aspect of such transformation pertains to relationships to \"others\" including Jews and to other societies, including Israeli/Palestine.\n\nFlyer\n\nA Rebellious Son? Jesus and His Mother at the Wedding in Cana\n\nMarch 2, 2016\n\nIn the Gospel of John, chapter 2, Jesus, his mother, his brothers, and the disciples are at a wedding in Cana in the Galilee. Inexplicably, the wine runs out while the celebrations are in full swing. When Jesus' mother points out the problem to her son, hoping he will help, his answer is surprising: \"Woman, what does this have to do with you and me?\" This lecture by Prof. Adele Reinhartz, 2015-2016 Corcoran Chair in Christian-Jewish Relations, looked closely at this exchange in the context of the norms and expectations of parent-child relationships in Jewish and Greco-Roman societies, and considered its role in the Gospel's overall presentation of Jesus. This event was co-sponsored by the School of Theology and Ministry and the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning.\n\nHistory, Trauma, and Testimony\n\nNovember 6, 2015\n\nAs part of the Center's Jewish-Christian Lecture Series, Dr. Murray Schwartz spoke in Prof. Vanessa Rumble's \"Freud and Philosophy\" class, discussing the tensions between Holocaust history on the one hand and trauma and testimony on the other.\n\nFlyer\n\nThe Politics of Apocalypticism: Assigning Authorship and Jewish-Christian Relations\n\nNovember 6, 2015\n\nAs part of the Center's Jewish-Christian Lecture Series, Dr. Kelley Coblentz Bautch spoke in Prof. Angela Harkins' \"Apocalypses and Apocalyptic Literature\" class.\n\nSchedule\n\nCouncil of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations Fourteenth Annual Meeting\n\nNovember 1-2, 2015\n\nThe Center hosted the Fourteenth Annual Meeting of the Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations (CCJR), which included four speaker panels open to the public.\n\nAnnouncement\n\nA Celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of Nostra Aetate\n\nNovember 1, 2015\n\nProf. James O'Toole, Clough Millennium Chair in History at Boston College, delivered the keynote lecture, titled \"Boston and Nostra Aetate\" as part of the Center's \"Celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of Nostra Aetate.\" Prof. James Bernauer, Kraft Family Professor and Director of the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning, provided introductory remarks.

Michael McGarry of the Paulist Center; Dr. Jennifer Howe Peace, Associate Professor of Interfaith Studies at Andover-Newton Theological School; and Rev. Dr. Demetrios Tonias, Dean of Annunciation Cathedral of Boston. Ruth Langer, Professor of Jewish Studies and Associate Director of the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning, served as the panel's moderator.\n\nAnnouncement\n\nJesuit Kaddish: Encounters Between Jesuits and Jews and Why These Might Matter to Us\n\nOctober 26, 2015\n\nProf. James Bernauer, S.J., Kraft Family Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning at Boston College, spoke at the College of the Holy Cross (Worcester, MA) and offered an overview of how Jesuits became a leader in dialogue with Jews.

In Orthodox Judaism, only husbands could grant divorces. In evangelical Protestantism, divorced men and women were treated as damaged goods. Today, in all three traditions, times are changing. This conference examined how much, and how fast.\n\nConference Program\n\nAgreeing to Disagree: How Jews and Christians Read Scripture Differently\n\nProf. Amy-Jill Levine\n\nMarch 19, 2015\n\nAlthough Jews and Christians share common books--the Jewish Tanakh and the Christian Old Testament--we read our shared stories in different ways. Differences in translation, punctuation, definitions, theology, emphasis, and even canonical order all lead to differences in community self-definition. Prof. Levine addressed how we have a conversation if we see the world, and the text, through different lenses. The event was sponsored by the School of Theology and Ministry and the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning, and generously supported by the Kitz Family in honor of Richard J. Clifford, S.J.\n\nRighteous Among the Nations: A Conference Exploring the Spiritual & Ethical Witness of Holocaust Rescuers\n\nMarch 12-13, 2015\n\nThe Israeli Holocaust Memorial Center, Yad Vashem, has honored over 25,000 individuals with the title \"Righteous Among the Nations\" for having risked or lost their own livesin rescuing Jewish lives during the Shoah. How do their activities still question us spiritually and ethically? The Center for Christian-Jewish Learning at Boston College sponsored this conference in order to examine the implications of this extraordinary human achievement, accomplished in the midst of genocidal violence.\n\nPoster\n\nWhoever Saves a Single Life\n\nMarch 9-April 17, 2015\n\nThis exhibit by the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous showcased some of those rare--but exceedingly important--instances where people fought to safeguard their Jewish fellow citizens during the Holocuast.

This exhibit was co-sponsored by the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning, the Boston College School of Theology & Ministry, and the Boston College Libraries.\n\nJ.S. Bach's St. John Passion: A Performance and Discussion on Anti-Semitism\n\nFebruary 27, 2015\n\nBoston Baroque performed J.S.

Members of the Institute formed a community of like-minded Nazi Christians who remained active in Germany's post-war years. Kevin Spicer, C.S.C., professor of History at Stonehill College responded to Heschel.\n\nThe Jesuit Order as a Synagogue of Jews: Jesuits of Jewish Ancestry and Purity of Blood Laws in the Early Society of Jesus, Robert A. Maryks\n\nFebruary 24, 2010\n\nOn the occasion of the publication of his book The Jesuit Order as a Synagogue of Jews, Robert Maryks explained how Christians with Jewish family backgrounds went within less than 40 years from having a leading role in the Foundation of the Society of Jesus to being prohibited from membership in it. In his book, Maryks works at the intersection of two important historical topics--the early modern histories of the Jesuit order and of Iberian \"purity of blood\" concerns. His analysis of pro- and con-verso texts advances our understanding of early modern institutional Catholicism as religious reform interacted with the new racism in Spain and its broader diffusion.\n\nFreud's \"Moses and Monotheism\": In its Historical Setting, Michael Mach\n\nFebruary 16, 2010\n\nMach contended that Freud's last work \"Moses and Monotheism\" has remained a puzzling piece even 70 years after its publication. Attempts to solve the riddle by \"analyzing\" Freud's personal problems may have brought some insights, and yet they do not explain the inconsistencies in \"Moses\" nor Freud's obsession with it. Mach suggested that we read it as part of the anti-Facist literature that had brought forth a series of \"historical novels\" mostly by German writers in exile but also sometimes within Germany as well. Mach's proposed interpretation is that Freud's text be considered a work of literary fiction with a political aim.\n\nThe Word Set Free: Presenting the New Testament in its First Century Context, Daniel J.

Wills, “Through-lines and Fault-lines: Gospel of John ‘Within Judaism’?”\n\nAs part of the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning's Jewish-Christian Lecture Series, Prof. Lawrence M. Wills presented his lecture “Through-lines and Fault-lines: Gospel of John ‘Within Judaism’?” in Prof. Angela Harkins’ course \"John: Gospel and Letters.\" The recent trend to interpret New Testament texts “within Judaism”—Matthew, Paul, Acts, Hebrews, Revelation—has also been applied to John. Yet the Gospel of John resists this approach in that “the Jews” is very often used for the opponents, those who simply will not believe that Jesus has a direct relation to God. Scholars are now split on this issue: Does John reflect a troubled but ultimately resolvable conflict with the wider body of Jews, or does John embrace a dualism between the “true” followers of Jesus (not all followers of Jesus?) and “the Jews”? Prof. Wills outlined key positions of scholars and proposed a solution to this problem.\n\nApril 7-8, 2024\n\n2024 Corcoran Chair Conference \"RANKING RELIGIONS: Taxonomic Comparison in Medieval Christian, Jewish, and Islamic Thought\"\n\nWithin the polemical inter-religious context of the Middle Ages, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim thinkers developed systematic and sophisticated ways of comparing their own faiths with those of others, including non-monotheists. Although each thinker maintained that his own community’s system of belief and practice was superior to those of other groups, they nonetheless engaged in a kind of comparative practice that prefigured or arguably lay foundations for the modern study of Comparative Religion. One element of this comparative practice was the production of taxonomies of religions and systems of ranking them, sometimes using the discourse of “proximity” and “distance” to conceptualize their interrelation. In this conference, presenters examined how Muslim, Jewish, and Christian thinkers produced taxonomies and rankings of other religious communities focusing on the underlying reasons for producing the taxonomies adopted and the shifting grounds of comparison itself (doctrine, ritual, revelatory status, prophetology, etc.).\n\nConference Program\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nA Book Event for Shai Held's \"Judaism Is About Love”\n\nA Dialogue between Shai Held and Stephen Pope\n\nThe Torah contains three great love commandments: love of God, love of neighbor, and love of the stranger/sojourner. Love of the stranger/sojourner, repeated for emphasis in both Leviticus and Deuteronomy, represents one of the Torah's greatest moral revolutions. This event was a dialogue between Rabbi Shai Held and Prof. Stephen Pope to probe the meaning of the commandment, ask why it was so radical in its (and our) time, and explore the relationship between memory of past sufferings and commitment to present-day love.\n\nVideo\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\nMatthew Goff, \"The Book of 2 Esdras: Jewish, Christian, Both, Neither\"\n\nAs part of the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning's Jewish-Christian Lecture Series, Prof. Matthew Goff presented his lecture “The Book of 2 Esdras: Jewish, Christian, Both, Neither” in Prof. Yonder Gillihan's course “Early Christianity in Its Jewish Context.” Relatively unknown to most readers of scripture, most of 2 Esdras (also called 4 Ezra) is a Jewish apocalyptic text written around 100 CE, roughly the same time as the composition of the book of Revelation. 4 Ezra offers a crucial window into how Jews in the late first century CE reinvented their traditions in the crucible of national trauma. The book teaches that the diversity and creativity of their responses to losing the temple become harder for us to appreciate if we think about them only through the lens of what later became Christianity and rabbinic Judaism. This event is sponsored by the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning, the Theology Department, the Institute for the Liberal Arts, and the Jewish Studies Program.\n\nVideo\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\nMatthew Thiessen, “A Jewish Paul: Restoring the Apostle Paul to His Roots”\n\nDid Paul break from Judaism to start a new religion called Christianity? For most readers through history, the answer to this question is a resounding Yes! But in his lecture, Prof. Matthew Thiessen reasoned that a careful reading of his letters in their historical context demonstrates the thoroughgoing Jewishness of this oft-misunderstood ancient Jew.\n\nVideo\n\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\nPeter Ochs, 2024-2025 Corcoran Visiting Chair in Christian-Jewish Relations\n\nBoston College and the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning are pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Peter Ochs to the 2024-2025 Corcoran Visiting Chair in Christian-Jewish Relations.\n\nAnnouncement BC Chronicle Article\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nDaniel Joslyn-Siemiatkoski, Amy-Jill Levine, Karma Ben Johanan, Michael Azar, and Katharina von Kellenbach, \"Christ Jesus the Jew in the Wake of October 7th\"\n\nCenter Director Daniel Joslyn-Siemiatkoski spoke on a panel about Jewish-Christian relations after October 7.

Rising Antisemitism and Jewish-Christian Relations\"\n\nThe work of Jewish-Christian relations is built on the premise that confronting antisemitism is a first order priority. At the same time, many scholars involved in Jewish-Christian dialogue tend to treat antisemitism as a thing of the past. Given that antisemitism is now growing at an alarming rate, panelists Rita George-Tvrtkovic (Benedictine University), Daniel Joslyn-Siemiatkoski (Boston College), and Malka Simkovich (Catholic Theological Union)—with moderator Glenn Dynner (Fairfield University)—considered how those engaged in Jewish-Christian relations, and interreligious relations more broadly, ought to react to the current moment.\n\nVideo\n\nJanuary 25, 2024\n\nJames Bernauer, S.J., \"Auschwitz and Absolution: The Case of the Commandant and the Confessor\"\n\nThe Center hosted a celebration of the publication Auschwitz and Absolution: The Case of the Commandant and the Confessor (Orbis Books, 2023).

This conference explored what the French scholar Gilbert Dahan has called “the encounter over Scripture,” the exploration of the shared textual heritage by Jewish and Christian scholars in the Western Middle Ages (c. 500-1500 CE), which opened the door to interactions between Christians and Jews, ranging from learned discourse to hostile confrontation.\n\nConference Program\n\nMarch 14, 2023\n\nJonathan Decter, 2023-2024 Corcoran Visiting Chair in Christian-Jewish Relations\n\nBoston College and the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning are pleased to announce the appointment of Jonathan Decter to the 2023-2024 Corcoran Visiting Chair in Christian-Jewish Relations.\n\nFull Announcement\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nMichal Bar-Asher Siegal, \"The Babylonian Talmud and Jewish-Christian Literary Relations in Late Antiquity\"\n\nIn her talk, Dr. Michal Bar-Asher Siegal presented the argument that Talmudic literary traditions must be examined as part of the Late Antique boundary-creating discourse between the rabbinic authors and contemporaneous Christians.

However, the abbey of Saint Victor, in the mid-twelfth century, also witnessed a different kind of interaction between Christians and Jews: an encounter centered not on what divided but on what united them. Prof. Frans van Liere spoke on how the discovery of a shared scriptural heritage could lead to mutual learning, although it was not always without challenges.\n\nVideo\n\nJuly 18-20, 2022\n\nRemembering the Holocaust: Voices of Survivors\n\nBoston College, in collaboration with the International Institute for Holocaust Research, Yad Vashem, hosted a three-day virtual seminar on remembering the experiences of women and children during the Holocaust.

Meyer, The Suffering Jewish Jesus and Christian Memory\n\nHow does remembering Jesus’ Jewishness affect Christian approaches to suffering?

These discussions, each co-led by a faculty member and graduate student, engaged three moves innate to the theological classroom: introducing theology to those with a different or no experience of religion; complicating the discipline of theology for students who do have some religious background, but one that might be more catechetical in nature; and empowering students to engage the theological discipline themselves through their own theological reflection or the use of theological skills in other aspects of their lives.\n\nIntroducing Theology\n\nDr. Amey Victoria Adkins-Jones and Nathan D.
