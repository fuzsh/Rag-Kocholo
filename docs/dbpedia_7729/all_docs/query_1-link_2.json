It is important to assess the security needs of each facility within our community, as any given building has its own security concerns that we can help address. Target Hardening of a facility can be accomplished in various ways. We do not need to turn our buildings into fortresses, and we will discuss inexpensive ways to secure your building. These assessments are free of charge and also will assist in your applications for security grants.\n\nPlease take the time to schedule a consultation with the Federation security team. The assessment will be a thorough walk-through and discussion of security concerns you may have."
