(Please read this BEFORE EMAILING ME).\n\nResearch Interests\n\nI am interested in all aspects of theory of computation, especially in cryptography, network algorithms, and search and classification of large-scale, high-dimensional data. I find these topics fascinating to work on, not only due to their philosophical and theoretical centrality in computer science, but also due to their practical significance. Below, is a more detailed list of topics, with links to papers written on each topic. (You can also search Publications by Year or Google Scholar or DBLP.)\n\nPublications by Topic\n\nThe papers below are also available in a chronological list or organized by topics.
