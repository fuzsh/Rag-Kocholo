In this work\n\nwe explore a different facet of this notion, not addressed by prior\n\ndefinitions. Specifically, prior definitions concentrate on capturing\n\nthe properties of the verifier, and do not pay much attention to the\n\nproperties of the prover.\n\nOur new definition is strictly stronger than previous ones, and captures\n\nnew and desirable properties. In particular, it guarantees prover\n\nfeasibility, that is, it guarantees that the time spent by the prover\n\nin a proof of knowledge is comparable to that it spends in an “extraction”\n\nof this knowledge. Our definition also enables one to consider meaningfully\n\nthe case of a single, specific prover.\n\nePrint: https://eprint.iacr.org/1998/015\n\nSee all topics related to this paper.\n\nFeel free to post resources that are related to this paper below.\n\nExample resources include: implementations, explanation materials, talks, slides, links to previous discussions on other websites."
