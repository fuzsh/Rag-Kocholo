Join us as we bring together more than 25 of the most important writers, thinkers, and leaders from across the Jewish world to discuss, debate, and reassess the deepest questions of Jewish life in the wake of the devastation and war in Israel. This gathering will include deep dives on peoplehood, antisemitism, diaspora institutions, Zionism, literature, ritual, and more—and you will have the opportunity, over a full day, to engage directly with some of the most essential Jewish voices today.\n\nThis event signifies a pivotal moment for The Weitzman, as it embraces the role of a nationwide leader and convener of Jewish thought leadership.\n\nAs the only organization anywhere dedicated to exploring, preserving, and interpreting the nearly four centuries of American Jewish history from the dawn of our nation to the present day, the Jewish Priorities Conference is a natural extension of our mission to unleash the power of education as an antidote to antisemitism.\n\nThe conference is in conjunction with and has been inspired by the much-awaited release of Jewish Priorities: Sixty-five Proposals for the Future of Our People. This trailblazing anthology, skillfully edited by David Hazony—and featuring essays by many of the distinguished participants in this conference—serves as a powerful catalyst for opening dialogues, embracing disagreements, and fostering understanding.\n\nConvened by The Weitzman, presented with Unorthodox\n\nQuestions?
