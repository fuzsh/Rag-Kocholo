Before that, I was a postdoc at the ISG group at RHUL, working with Martin Albrecht and Rachel Player. Before that, I worked as a Research Scientist at Intel AI Research in San Diego. I completed my PhD at Bristol University, under the supervision of Nigel Smart. I am interested in privacy-preserving machine learning, fully homomorphic encryption and more broadly, computing on encrypted data, lattice-based and post-quantum cryptography. My research is in part sponsored by Intel. You can contact me at anamaria.costache1992@gmail.com .\n\nCommunity Service: I have served as a program committee member for MathCrypt 2019 and 2021, Workshop on Encrypted Computing & Applied Homomorphic Cryptography (WAHC) 2020 and 2021, the Fifteenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium (ANTS-XV) (2022), FHE.org 2023 and 2024, ACM CCS 2022 and 2023. I am on the Editorial Board for the new IACR Communications in Cryptology journal."
