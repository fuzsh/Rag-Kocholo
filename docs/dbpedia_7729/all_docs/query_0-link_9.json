In this work, we revisit zero-knowledge proofs and focus on adaptive adversaries, which ...\n\nOn Relationships between Statistical Zero-Knowledge Proofs\n\nThis paper solves several fundamental open problems about statistical zero-knowledge interactive proofs (SZKIPs). The following two theorems are proven: If language L has a statistical zero-knowledge interactive proof against an honest verifier, then L ...\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs from Secure Multiparty Computation\n\nA zero-knowledge proof allows a prover to convince a verifier of an assertion without revealing any further information beyond the fact that the assertion is true. Secure multiparty computation allows $n$ mutually suspicious players to jointly compute a ...\n\nInformation & Contributors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\n836 pages\n\nISBN:9781450372664\n\nDOI:10.1145/3335741\n\nEditor:\n\nOded Goldreich\n\nWeizmann Institute of Science\n\nCopyright Â© 2019.\n\nPublisher\n\nAssociation for Computing Machinery\n\nNew York, NY, United States\n\nPublication History\n\nPublished: 04 October 2019\n\nPermissions\n\nRequest permissions for this article.\n\nCheck for updates\n\nQualifiers\n\nResearch-article\n\nAppears in\n\nContributors\n\nOther Metrics\n\nBibliometrics & Citations\n\nBibliometrics\n\nArticle Metrics\n\n0\n\nTotal Citations\n\n45\n\nTotal Downloads\n\nDownloads (Last 12 months)1\n\nDownloads (Last 6 weeks)0\n\nOther Metrics\n\nCitations\n\nView Options\n\nGet Access\n\nLogin options\n\nCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution to get full access on this article.\n\nSign in\n\nFull Access\n\nView options\n\nPDF\n\nView or Download as a PDF file.\n\nPDF\n\neReader\n\nView online with eReader.\n\neReader\n\nMedia\n\nFigures\n\nOther\n\nTables\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nShare this Publication link\n\nCopied!\n\nCopying failed.\n\nShare on social media\n\nAffiliations\n\nOded Goldreich\n\nWeizmann Institute of Science\n\nRequest permissions Authors Info & Affiliations"
