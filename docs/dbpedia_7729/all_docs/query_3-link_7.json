Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1109, Pages 201-215, Springer-Verlag, 1996.\n\nAbstract: We present a very practical string-commitment scheme which is provably secure based solely on collision-free hashing. Our scheme enables a computationally bounded party to commit strings to an unbounded one, and is optimal (within a small constant factor) in terms of interaction, communication, and computation.\n\nOur result also proves that constant round statistical zero-knowledge arguments and constant-round computational zero-knowledge proofs for NP exist based on the existence of collision-free hash functions.\n\nNote: A similar construction was described by I. Damgard, T. P. Pedersen and B. Pfitzmann, \"On the existance of statistically hiding bit commitment schemes and fail-stop signatures\", Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO '93., Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 773, Pages 250-265, Springer-Verlag, 1993.\n\nAvailability: Paper available as PDF (186 Kbyte)."
