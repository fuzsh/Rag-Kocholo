The security of these constructions is based on the hardness of a relatively new hard problem in lattice-based cryptography ‘Ring-Learning With Errors’. This talk will describe the problem, its applications, and discuss its security from the perspective of recent attacks.\n\nBIO: Katherine Stange is an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, and was a student of Joseph H. Silverman. She is a number theorist with interests ranging from cryptography to elliptic curves to Apollonian circle packings.\n\nCentrally Banked Cryptocurrencies Sarah Meiklejohn (University College London) 7/28 1:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: Current cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin, build a decentralized blockchain-based transaction ledger, maintained through proofs-of-work that also generate a monetary supply. Such decentralization has benefits, such as independence from national political control, but also significant limitations in terms of scalability and computational cost. We introduce RSCoin, a cryptocurrency framework in which central banks maintain complete control over the monetary supply, but rely on a distributed set of authorities, or mintettes, to prevent double-spending. While monetary policy is centralized, RSCoin still provides strong transparency and auditability guarantees. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the benefits of a modest degree of centralization, such as the elimination of wasteful hashing and a scalable system for avoiding double-spending attacks.\n\nBIO: Sarah Meiklejohn is a Lecturer in the Departments of Computer Science and Security and Crime Science at University College London. She has broad research interests in computer security and cryptography, and has worked on topics such as anonymity and criminal abuses in virtual currencies, anonymous credentials, and understanding the interface between cryptographic primitives and their mathematical underpinnings. Previously, Sarah received a PhD from University of California, San Diego in May 2014 under the guidance of Mihir Bellare and Stefan Savage, as well as an Sc.B. in Mathematics in 2008 and an Sc.M. in Computer Science in 2009, both from Brown University.\n\nSieving for shortest vectors in lattices using locality-sensitive hashing Thijs Laarhoven (Eindhoven University of Technology) 6/22 1:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: Most lattice-based cryptographic primitives rely on the shortest vector problem (SVP) on lattices being hard. To assess the computational hardness of SVP and breaking these schemes, one commonly relies on the estimated time complexity of enumeration for solving SVP. In 2001 the breakthrough work of Ajtai et al. showed that SVP can actually be solved faster in high dimensions, using a technique called sieving. Although this technique seemed impractical at first, various improvements have since shown that sieving may be competitive with enumeration after all. In this talk we will look at recent advances in sieving using a technique from nearest neighbor searching, locality-sensitive hashing.\n\nBIO: Thijs is a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, studying the unrelated topics of fingerprinting and group testing algorithms, lattice algorithms, and the Collatz conjecture.\n\nTowards Practical ORAM Tarik Moataz (Colorado State University and Telecom Bretagne) 11/19 1:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: Although Oblivious RAM (ORAM) has recently received a lot of attention, its high communication and storage cost still render it impractical for real-world scenarios. We present a general construction to reduce the communication cost of all recent tree-based ORAMs. The main idea behind our new construction dubbed “r-ORAM” is a recursive ORAM tree structure, where nodes in the tree are roots of other trees. We demonstrate that the expected cost saving is around 35% for any binary tree ORAMs. Besides reducing communication cost, r-ORAM also reduces storage overhead on the server by 20%. r-ORAM is general and can be applied to all recent tree ORAMs, both constant memory or poly-log client memory ORAMs. Furthermore, we will introduce first steps towards “Resizable ORAM”, enabling a client to adapt and change their ORAM’s storage requirement and therefore cost in any tree based ORAM.\n\nBIO: Tarik Moataz is a second year Ph.D. student in a French-American joint Ph.D. program between Colorado State University and Telecom Bretagne. His main interest lies in designing new cryptographic protocols for operating on outsourced data.

In particular, being able to plausibly deny that a hard disk contains certain encrypted information is a very useful and interesting research goal. However, it has been known for some time that existing ?hidden volume? solutions, like TrueCrypt, fail in the face of an adversary who is able to observe the contents of a disk on multiple, separate occasions. In this talk, I will explore more robust constructions for hidden volumes and present HIVE, which is resistant to more powerful adversaries with multiple-snapshot capabilities. At the core of HIVE, I will present a new write-only Oblivious RAM, which is of independent interest. I will show that, when only hiding writes, it is possible to achieve ORAM with optimal O(1) communication complexity and only poly-logarithmic user memory, a significant improvement over existing work. I will go on to show that this write-only ORAM is specially equipped to provide hidden volume functionality with low overhead and significantly increased security compared to existing solutions.\n\nBIO: I started my academic career at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County where I worked with Alan Sherman and others on the secure cryptographic voting system Scantegrity. From there, I entered the PhD program at Northeastern University working with Agnes Chan and Erik-Oliver Blass. My research is currently on cryptographic protocols for efficient secure cloud computation and data retrieval, focusing specifically on practical Oblivious RAM schemes and their real-world applications.\n\nFrom Circuits to RAM Programs in Malicious 2-party Computation Mike Rosulek (Oregon State University) 8/27 3:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: Secure 2-party computation (2PC) is becoming practical in some domains. However, most approaches are limited by the fact that the desired functionality must be represented as a boolean circuit. In response, the random-access machine (RAM) model has recently been investigated as a promising alternative to circuits. In this talk, I will discuss some pitfalls of basing malicious-secure 2PC on the RAM model rather than circuits. I will then describe two new protocols for malicious-secure 2PC of RAM programs, whose performance relative to the semi-honest model matches the state of the art for circuit-based 2PC techniques. For malicious security with statistical security parameter $2^{-s}$, our protocol without preprocessing has overhead $s$ compared to the semi-honest model; our protocol with preprocessing has overhead $sim 2s/log T$, where $T$ is the running time of the RAM program. This is joint work with Arash Afshar, Payman Mohassel, and Zhangxiang Hu.\n\nBIO: Mike Rosulek is an Assistant Professor in the School of EECS at Oregon State University. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois and a B.S. in Computer Science from Iowa State University. His research interests are in cryptography, focusing on protocols for secure computation.\n\nKey-Versatile Signatures and Applications Sarah Meiklejohn (UCSD) 7/23 3:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: This talk will discuss key-versatile signatures. Key-versatile signatures allow us to sign with keys already in use for another purpose, without changing the keys and without impacting the security of the original purpose. This allows us to obtain advances across a collection of challenging domains including joint encryption and signatures, security against related-key attack (RKA), and security for key-dependent messages (KDM). Specifically, we can (1) add signing capability to existing encryption capability with zero overhead in the size of the public key; (2) obtain RKA-secure signatures from any RKA-secure one-way function, yielding new RKA-secure signature schemes; and (3) add integrity to encryption while maintaining KDM-security.\n\nBIO: As of September 2014, Sarah Meiklejohn will be a Lecturer at University College London with broad research interests in cryptography and security. Previously, she obtained her Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where she was co-advised by Mihir Bellare and Stefan Savage. Before that, she received an Sc.M. in Computer Science and an Sc.B. in Mathematics from Brown University.\n\nProvable security of advanced properties of TLS and SSH Douglas Stebila (Queensland University of Technology) 7/18 10:30am\n\nABSTRACT: Cryptographic protocols are fundamental to securing communication on the Internet. The protocols that are used in practice tend to be more complicated than the protocols in academic papers and have more complex security goals. As a result, there has been a significant gap between our mathematical understanding of their security and their real-world security. In this talk, I’ll discuss a series of results aimed at reducing this gap.\n\nI’ll begin by giving an introduction for non-cryptographers to “provable security”, which is the tool we use to formally describe and analyze the security properties of cryptographic schemes. Then I’ll discuss two important security properties that have not received a systematic treatment in the cryptographic literature—long-term key reuse and renegotiation—and connect these properties with real-world protocols: the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol used to secure billions of transactions on the web and the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol used for remote logins. I’ll present security models that better define the properties expected of these complex protocols, and results that demonstrate the conditions under which they have these properties.This talk covers joint work with Ben Dowling (QUT), and Florian Giesen, Florian Kohlar, and Jorg Schwenk (Ruhr-Universitat Bochum).\n\nBIO: Dr Douglas Stebila is a researcher in information security and cryptography at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia.

The proposed formulas generalize the use of Jacobian coordinates on elliptic curves, and their application improves the speed of performing cryptographic scalar multiplications in Jacobians of genus 2 curves over prime fields by an approximate factor of 1.25x. For example, on a single core of an Intel Core i7-3770M (Ivy Bridge), we show that replacing the previous best formulas with our new set improves the cost of generic scalar multiplications from 243,000 to 195,000 cycles, and drops the cost of specialized GLV-style scalar multiplications from 166,000 to 129,000 cycles.\n\nBIO: Huseyin Hisil is an Assistant Professor at Yasar University in Izmir, Turkey, who is known for contributions to curve-based cryptography.

In this paper we present a new dynamic SSE scheme that is simpler and more efficient than existing schemes while revealing less information to the server than prior schemes, achieving fully adaptive security against honest-but-curious servers. We implemented a prototype of our scheme and demonstrated its efficiency on datasets from prior work. Apart from its concrete efficiency, our scheme is also simpler: in particular, it does not require the server to support any operation other than upload and download of data. Thus the server in our scheme can be based solely on a cloud storage service, rather than a cloud computation service as well, as in prior work. In building our dynamic SSE scheme, we introduce a new primitive called Blind Storage, which allows a client to store a set of files on a remote server in such a way that the server does not learn how many files are stored, or the lengths of the individual files; as each file is retrieved, the server learns about its existence (and can notice the same file being downloaded subsequently), but the file’s name and contents are not revealed. This is a primitive with several applications other than SSE, and is of independent interest.\n\nBIO: Muhammad Naveed is a third year PhD student in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is interested in cryptography, security, and privacy. His current research focuses on secure cloud storage, secure multiparty computation, functional encryption, smartphone security and genomics privacy.\n\nCandidate Indistinguishability Obfuscation and Functional Encryption for all circuits Mariana Raykova (SRI International) 2/19 1:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: In this work, we study indistinguishability obfuscation and functional encryption for general circuits:Indistinguishability obfuscation requires that given any two equivalent circuits $C_0$ and $C_1$ of similar size, the obfuscations of $C_0$ and $C_1$ should be computationally indistinguishable.\n\nIn functional encryption, ciphertexts encrypt inputs $x$ and keys are issued for circuits $C$. Using the key $SK_C$ to decrypt a ciphertext $CT_x=enc(x)$, yields the value $C(x)$ but does not reveal anything else about $x$. Furthermore, no collusion of secret key holders should be able to learn anything more than the union of what they can each learn individually.We give constructions for indistinguishability obfuscation and functional encryption that supports all polynomial-size circuits. We accomplish this goal in three steps:\n\nWe describe a candidate construction for indistinguishability obfuscation for $NC^1$ circuits. The security of this construction is based on a new algebraic hardness assumption. The candidate and assumption use a simplified variant of multilinear maps, which we call Multilinear Jigsaw Puzzles.\n\nWe show how to use indistinguishability obfuscation for $NC^1$ together with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (with decryption in $NC^1$) to achieve indistinguishability obfuscation for all circuits.Finally, we show how to use indistinguishability obfuscation for circuits, public-key encryption, and non-interactive zero knowledge to achieve functional encryption for all circuits. The functional encryption scheme we construct also enjoys succinct ciphertexts, which enables several other applications.\n\nJoint work with Sanjam Garg, Craig Gentry, Shai Halevi, Amit Sahai, Brent Waters\n\nBIO: Mariana Raykova is a researcher in cryptography at SRI International.

From a category-theoretic point of view: we’ve got a reasonably good handle on (most of) the objects in our diagrams, but we have a chronic shortage of effective arrows!\n\nIn this talk, we consider some of the problems involved in computing with isogenies and endomorphisms of low-genus Jacobians, with a special focus on their applications in cryptography. For example: isogenies can be used to accelerate point counting, to relate ostensibly different discrete logarithm problems, and to improve the efficiency of cryptographic operations on elliptic and genus 2 curves. We will survey these constructions, consider their limitations, and give an idea of some open problems.\n\nBIO: Benjamin Smith is a research scientist at INRIA (France) and an adjunct assistant professor at the Ecole Polytechnique. He has made a number of contributions to the field of curve-based cryptography, including novel attacks on genus 3 curves, accelerated methods of point counting on genus 2 curves, and very recently, a new way of obtaining and exploiting endomorphisms on genus 1 elliptic curves.\n\nWho is Afraid of Vectors – Optimizing Cryptography Using SSE, AVX, NEON, and Co. Peter Schwabe (Radboud University Nijmegen) 8/26 10:30am\n\nABSTRACT: Most computer architectures, for example, x86, AMD64 and ARMv7 support efficient operations on vectors of data. The computational power of these instructions are most easily exploited if the same long streams of computations are carried out on independent sets of data. This is, for example, the case in many cryptanalytic computations. However, also single cryptographic computations can benefit from the computational power of vector instructions. In my talk I will consider various examples of such cryptographic computations and describe what implementation techniques are required to make best use of the vector instruction sets of various computer architectures.\n\nBIO: Peter Schwabe is an assistant professor at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands. He graduated from RWTH Aachen University in computer science in 2006 and received a Ph.D. from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Eindhoven University of Technology in 2011. Afterwards he worked for two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Information Science and the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation of Academia Sinica, Taiwan and at National Taiwan University.\n\nHis research area is the optimization of cryptographic and cryptanalytic algorithms in software.

He has also published articles on fast cryptanalysis, in particular attacks on the discrete-logarithm problem.\n\nOptimal Pairings on Abelian Varieties with Theta Functions Damien Robert (University of Bordeaux) 8/8 1:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: Pairings on elliptic curves have allowed the development of new cryptographic protocols like anonymous certificates, multicanal broadcasting… For an elliptic curve, or more generally a Jacobian, computing the pairing uses an algorithm due to Miller that explicitly compute some functions associated to divisors on the curve.\n\nIn this talk, we show how one can use Riemann relations on the Theta model to compute the Tate and Weil pairings on abelian varieties that are not necessarily Jacobians. We show how to generalize this to pairings reducing the loop length of Miller’s algorithm (ate, twisted ate, optimal ate), and also how to compute symmetric pairings on Kummer varieties.While elaborated for general abelian varieties, this algorithm is surprisingly fast in low dimension, and is almost competitive with the fastest known pairings computation on elliptic curves.This is a joint work with David Lubicz.\n\nBIO: Damien Robert is an INRIA researcher in the LFANT team at University of Bordeaux. Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research (MSR) in the cryptography group. Damien works in the field of applications of abelian varieties in public key cryptography, with main subjects of interest Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves (and more specifically genus 2 curves), computing isogenies and point counting, and also arithmetic with theta functions and class polynomials generation. Damien Robert worked on his PhD thesis under the supervision of Guillaume Hanrot in the Caramel team at Nancy.\n\nHomomorphic Encryption and Erroneous Number Theory Jung Hee Cheon (Seoul National University) 8/6 1:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: This talk provides an easy introduction of somewhat homomorphic encryptions. After the talk, anyone should be able to memorize at least one homomorphic scheme and understand how it works. We start with privacy homomorphisms proposed by Rivest et al in 1978. As those schemes, homomorphic encryptions could be vulnerable to the known plaintext attack with several pairs of plaintext and ciphertext. To repair previous weak schemes, we may consider a technique to insert errors intentionally as in Gentry’s fully homomorphic encryption. We introduce how to repair the privacy homomorphisms with this approach. Interestingly, the base hard problems of somewhat homomorphic encryptions can be regarded as number theoretic problems whose input contains some errors. This opens a new area about approximate computation in number theory, and raise a lot of interesting problems. We introduce some of them.\n\nBIO: Jung Hee Cheon is a Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and a director of Cryptographic Hard Problems Research Initiatives at Seoul National University (SNU). He received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics at KAIST in 1991, and 1997, respectively.

His research focuses on computational number theory, cryptology and their applications to practical problems.\n\nEfficient Cryptography for the Next Generation Secure Cloud Alptekin Kupcu (Koc University) 8/1 1:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, and client-server type storage and computation outsourcing constitute some of the major applications that the next generation cloud schemes will address. Since these applications are just emerging, it is the perfect time to design them with security and privacy in mind. Furthermore, considering the high-churn characteristics of such systems, the cryptographic protocols employed must be efficient and scalable.\n\nIn this talk, I will focus on an efficient and scalable fair exchange protocol that can be used for exchanging files between participants of a P2P file sharing system. It has been shown that fair exchange cannot be done without a trusted third party (called the Arbiter). Yet, even with a trusted Arbiter, it is still non-trivial to come up with an efficient solution, especially one that can be used in a P2P file sharing system with a high volume of data exchanged. Our protocol is optimistic, removing the need for the Arbiter’s involvement unless a dispute occurs. While the previous solutions employ costly cryptographic primitives for every file or block exchanged, our protocol employs them only once per peer, therefore achieving O(n) efficiency improvement when n blocks are exchanged between two peers. In practice, this corresponds to one-two orders of magnitude improvement in terms of both computation and communication (42 minutes vs. 40 seconds, 225 MB vs. 1.8 MB). Thus, for the first time, a provably secure (and privacy respecting when payments are made using e-cash) fair exchange protocol is being used in real bartering applications (e.g., BitTorrent) without sacrificing performance.\n\nFinally, if time permits, I will briefly mention some of our other results on cloud security including ways to securely outsource computation and storage to untrusted entities, official arbitration in the cloud, impossibility results on distributing the Arbiter, and keeping the user passwords safe (joint work at Microsoft Research). I will also be available to talk on these other projects after the presentation.\n\nBIO: Alptekin Kupcu has received his Ph.D. degree from Brown University Computer Science Department in 2010.

The FFT map is a bijection of the space of n-dimensional vectors that respects addition and changes convolution multiplication into coordinate-wise multiplication. If n is large, it is a difficult problem to recover a small vector v from partial knowledge of its FFT. We describe how to use this hard problem to create both a public key cryptosystem and a digital signature scheme. An earlier digital signature scheme based on this problem suffered from information leakage in trascripts, We explain how to use rejection sampling to avoid such leakage. Finally, we describe how the partial-FFT problem is naturally equivalent to a certain closest vector lattice problem, which can be used to (heuristically) analyze the security. (This is joint work with Jeff Hoffstein, John Schanck, and William Whyte.)\n\nBIO: Joseph Silverman received an Sc.B. from Brown University in 1977 and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1982 under the direction of John Tate.

There have been a number of amazing results (homomorphic encryption, attribute-based encryption for general circuits, multilinear maps) that were not previously possible. Hence, the area is extremely active, with major new papers appearing almost every month. However, a few inconvenient truths have been swept under the carpet along the way. Although known to the experts, some of these issues are possibly not well-known in the wider community.\n\nBIO: Steven Galbraith is a Professor in the Mathematics Department at the University of Auckland.

The corresponding decision problem is NP-hard and the most efficient algorithms for solving the computational problem all take exponential time. This talk discusses the complexity of the best known algorithms which are based on information-set decoding and the implications for code-based cryptography as well as the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem.\n\nBIO: Christiane Peters is a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark, and visiting researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond.

In the past ten years, RFID systems have gained popularity in many applications, such as supply chain management, library systems, e-passports, contactless cards, identification systems, and human implantation. RFID is one of the most promising technologies in the field of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. Many new applications can be created by embedding an object with RFID tags.

CryptDB is a system that provides practical confidentiality in the face of these attacks for applications backed by SQL databases. CryptDB’s approach is to execute SQL queries over encrypted data. It can do so practically with two techniques: using a collection of efficient SQL-aware encryption schemes, two of which are new, and onions of encryptions which allow dynamic adjustment of encryption schemes. An analysis of a trace of 126 million SQL queries from a production MySQL server shows that CryptDB can support operations over encrypted data for 99.5% of the 128,840 columns seen in the trace. Our evaluation shows that CryptDB has low overhead, reducing throughput by only 26% for queries from the standard SQL benchmark TPC-C when compared to unmodified MySQL.\n\nBIO: Raluca Ada Popa is a third year Ph.D. student in computer science at MIT, advised by Prof. Nickolai Zeldovich.

This is however not the case for authentication of data streams in which the message is very long, possibly infinite, and not known in advance to the sender. Trivial solutions for authenticating data streams either suffer from a long delay at the receiver?s end or cannot perform well when the communication channel is noisy.\n\nWe suggest an efficient, constant rate, authentication scheme for data streams over a noisy channel in the shared-randomness model. We show that for every given noise rate c < 1, there exists a scheme that correctly decodes and authenticates a (1-c)-fraction of the stream sent so far, with high probability. We also show that no constant-rate authentication scheme recovers more than a (1-c)-fraction of the stream, which implies that our scheme is optimal.Joint work with Matthew Franklin, Rafail Ostrovsky, and Leonard Schulman.\n\nBIO: Ran Gelles is a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at UCLA.

We initiate the first general and formal study of the security of symmetric encryption against such attacks. We extend the SSH-specific work of Paterson and Watson (Eurocrypt 2010) to develop security models for the fragmented setting. We also develop security models to formalize the additional desirable properties of ciphertext boundary hiding and robustness against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks for schemes in this setting.\n\nWe illustrate the utility of each of our models via efficient constructions for schemes using only standard cryptographic components, including constructions that simultaneously achieve confidentiality, ciphertext boundary hiding and DoS robustness.\n\nJoint work with Alexandra Boldyreva, Jean Paul Degabriele, and Kenneth G.

Since then, many new constructions have been provided, as well as new security definitions that seek to refine and strengthen the ones originally proposed. As the name suggests, the desired functionality of a VES scheme intuitively allows a user to encrypt, in a publicly verifiable manner, a signature on a message, coupled with the ability for either that user or some trusted third party (such as an arbiter) to later pull out the underlying signature. Such schemes allow for the fair exchange of digital signatures, in which two untrusted parties interact in the hopes of obtaining each others’ signatures on some message (e.g., a contract), and either both parties get what they want or neither does.\n\nIn this paper, we argue that even the refined definitions for VES security do not sufficiently capture this desired functionality. To support this claim, we generically construct a secure VES scheme using only signatures; this immediately suggests that the existing security notions are not capturing the “verifiable encryption” part of VES. To therefore bridge this gap between the desired functionality and the existing definitions, we propose a new definition called resolution independence and show that our signature-based construction cannot satisfy this definition, whereas all existing VES schemes can; resolution independence therefore provides a separation of sorts between our contrived construction and those that do provide the desired functionality. As further support for our new definition, we then show that any secure VES scheme satisfying a slightly stronger notion of resolution independence implies the existence of encryption.\n\nThis is joint work with Theresa Calderon, Hovav Shacham, and Brent Waters.\n\nBIO: Sarah is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego, entering her fourth year and working in the Security and Cryptography Group.

It is however not an absolute property: it will depend on the ballot format, tallying rules, voter turnout and preferences. Furthermore, it is achieved using various techniques, creating new trade-offs with the adoption of end-to-end verifiable voting systems for instance.\n\nWe describe various contributions to the analysis of the privacy properties that voting systems provide:\n\nWe propose privacy metrics, inspired from classical information theoretic (IT) quantities, and illustrate their use on the public audit data provided for the 2009 Takoma Park election based on Scantegrity.\n\nWe propose computational analogs of our IT metrics, together with a more traditional style cryptographic game-based privacy definition and show that this game-based definition can be conveniently used to bridge the gap between our IT and computational metrics.\n\nFocusing on a large class of voting protocols where voters interact with the authorities in one single pass, we identify conditions that guarantee that an encryption scheme is appropriate for the submission of ballots and apply these conditions to analyze the security of the Helios voting system.\n\nFinally, we propose a new type of encryption schemes, as well as efficient constructions that can be used to build voting schemes that offer an IT private audit trail and computational privacy towards authorities.\n\nThis talk is based on joint works with David Bernhard, Veronique Cortier, Edouard Cuvelier, Thomas Peters and Bogdan Warinschi.\n\nBIO: Olivier Pereira is a professor at Université catholique de Louvain and a research associate of the Belgian Science Research Foundation FNRS.

One of the approaches is the “Pret a Voter” concept, in which the vote is encoded by randomising the order of candidates. In this talk I will outline the Pret a Voter concept and describe its development over the roughly eight years since its inception. The design has evolved in the face of newly identified threats, advances in cryptographic primitives and demands for greater flexibility and efficiency. I will also outline the Pretty Good Democracy scheme and the incorporation of ideas from PGD in Pret a Voter, giving rise to Pret a Voter with Confirmation Codes.\n\nBIO: Peter Ryan is Professor of Applied Security at the University of Luxembourg.

Unfortunately, in their eagerness to have the most modern and best election equipment and to take advantage of almost $4 billion in federal funding, well-meaning election officials were quick to accept accuracy and security claims of computerized voting system vendors. Few questions were asked about crucial issues. How secure, accurate, and reliable are these machines? How easy are they to use, especially by people with disabilities? How could an election audit or recount be conducted? There was little or no consultation with independent technical experts on these questions, and remarkably little scientific research. Standards and regulations were inadequate to nonexistent. The implicit assumption appears to have been that no recount would ever be needed, because the new systems were so completely secure and accurate that there would no longer be any reason to challenge an election result.\n\nThere is now a widespread perception that Internet voting is the wave of the future and the way to save money while increasing voter participation, especially participation of young people. (I can bank online; why can’t I vote online?) Not having learned from previous mistakes and against the advice of essentially all computer security experts, Internet voting is currently being used in several countries and in some U.S. States. There is also strong pressure to adopt Internet voting in the U.S. for members of the military and civilians living abroad. In this talk I examine some of the threats of Internet voting in the hope of encouraging the technical community to oppose Internet voting unless and until these threats can be eliminated.\n\nBIO: An expert on electronic voting, Dr. Barbara Simons recently published Broken Ballots: Will Your Vote Count?, a book on voting machines co-authored with Douglas Jones.

One of the oldest, and most efficient blind signature schemes is the one due to Schnorr that is based on his famous identification scheme. Although it was proposed over twenty years ago, its unforgeability remains an open problem, even in the random-oracle model. In this work, we show that current techniques for proving security in the random oracle model do not work for the Schnorr blind signature. Our results generalize to other important blind signatures, such as the one due to Brands. Brands’ blind signature is at the heart of Microsoft’s UProve system, which makes this work relevant to cryptographic practice as well.Joint work with Foteini Baldimtsi\n\nBIO: Anna Lysyanskaya is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Brown University.

Solvers are used for a variety of practical applications, from VLSI verification to transportation route planning. Recently several authors have attempted to use solvers to perform one of the most challenging tasks in modern computer science – cryptanalysis of symmetric block ciphers such as AES. To use a solver for cryptanalysis, we provide it with a known plaintext, a known ciphertext and the set of mathematical equations which use an unknown secret key to transform between the two. The solver is then expected to output the secret key which links the given plaintext and ciphertext, thus satisfying the equation set. Fortunately, solvers are not currently capable of directly attacking modern ciphers. However, the situation is drastically different when side-channel data (information leaked from the cryptographic device due to its internal structure) is introduced into the equation.This talk will introduce side-channel cryptographic attacks, survey our latest efforts in using machine solvers to attack cryptosystems, and conclude with a successful attack on the AES cipher which requires surprisingly little side-channel data and computation time.\n\nJoint work with Mathieu Renauld, Francois-Xavier Standaert and Avishai Wool\n\nBIO: Yossi Oren is a Ph.D. student at the Computer Network and Security Lab at Tel-Aviv University.

A device that knows how much time has elapsed between queries from an untrusted reader could better protect against attacks that depend on the existence of a rate-unlimited encryption oracle. The TARDIS (Time and Remanence Decay in SRAM) helps to locally maintain a sense of time elapsed without power and without special-purpose hardware. The TARDIS software computes the expiration state of a timer by analyzing the decay of existing on-chip SRAM memory. The TARDIS enables coarse-grained, hourglass-like timers such that cryptographic software can more deliberately decide how to throttle its response rate. Our experiments demonstrate that the TARDIS can measure time ranging from seconds to several hours depending on hardware parameters. Key challenges to implementing a practical TARDIS include compensating for temperature and handling variation across hardware. Our contributions are (1) the algorithmic building blocks for computing elapsed time from SRAM decay; (2) characterizing TARDIS behavior under different temperatures, capacitors, SRAM sizes, and chips; and (3) three proof of concept implementations that use the TARDIS to enable privacy-preserving RFID tags, to deter double swiping of contactless credit cards, and to increase the difficulty of brute force attacks against e-Passports.

In theory the cryptographic schemes used within these standards solve well understood problems, yet a parade of damaging attacks leave us with the question: What gives? Theoreticians often suggest (at least in private) that the problems are well-understood and attacks arise because standardizers misunderstand cryptographic theory. I’ll use some of my recent work which uses provable-security techniques to analyze important standards (including TLS, HMAC, and PKCS#5) to argue that, just as often, it is the theoreticians who don’t have all the answers: analyzing practically-useful cryptography requires pushing models and proof techniques in never-before-considered directions. We’ll see how (what I’ll call) practice-driven cryptographic theory can lead to new understanding and improved confidence in cryptographic practice.\n\nThis talk will cover joint work with Mihir Bellare, Scott Coull, Yevgeniy Dodis, Kevin Dyer, Kenneth Paterson, Thomas Shrimpton, John Steinberger, and Stefano Tessaro.\n\nComputing Elliptic Curves over Q(√5) Alyson Deines (University of Washington) 7/31 10:30am\n\nABSTRACT: I will discuss creating (conjectural) tables of elliptic curves over Q(√5) ordered by conductor up to the first curve of rank 2. We computed these curves by first computing weight (2,2) Hilbert modular forms over Q(√5) using an algorithm of Lassina Dembélé.

The aim is to provide a proof which uses two-variable $p$-adic $L$-functions in a manner analogous to the Greenberg-Stevens proof of the Mazur-Tate-Teitelbaum conjecture for elliptic curves. In the Kubota-Leopldt setting, we use the Katz two-variable $p$-adic $L$-function attached to an imaginary quadratic field $K$. This is joint work with Ralph Greenberg and Shaowei Zhang.\n\nBIO: Benjamin Lundell is Acting Assistant Professor at the University of Washington.

The CRT method used to compute these polynomials needs to find first a jacobian with maximal endomorphism ring over a finite field, and then enumerates all others jacobians having maximal endomorphism ring using horizontal isogenies. For $ell> 2$, we use Galois cohomology and the Tate pairing to compute the action of the Frobenius on the $ell$-torsion. In view of application to Igusa class polynomials computation, we deduce an algorithm to verify whether the jacobian of a genus 2 curve has locally maximal endomorphism ring at $ell$. Moreover, we derive a method to construct horizontal isogenies starting from a jacobian with maximal endomorphism ring.\n\nSummer Number Theory Talk 4: Asymptotic nonlinearity of Boolean functions Francois Rodier (IML) 7/24 2:30pm\n\nABSTRACT: The nonlinearity of Boolean functions on the space Fm2 is important in cryptography. It is used to measure the strength of cryptosystems when facing linear attacks. In the case low degree of approximation attacks, we examine the nonlinearity of order r of a Boolean function, which equals the number of necessary substitutions in its truth table needed to change it into a function of degree at most r. Studies aimed at the distribution of Boolean functions according to the r-th order nonlinearity. Asymptotically, a lower bound is established in the higher order cases for almost all Boolean functions, whereas a concentration point is shown in the first and second order nonlinearity case. In the case of vectorial Boolean functions, a concentration point is shown in the first order nonlinearity case.\n\nSummer Number Theory Talk 3: The distribution of zeroes of the zeta functions of Artin-Schreier covers over finite fields Alina Bucur (UC San Diego) 7/24 11:30am\n\nABSTRACT: I will give a quick overview of some new developments in studying the distribution of points and zeroes of the zeta functions for curves over finite fields. Then we will concentrate on the distribution of the zeroes of the zeta functions of the family of Artin-Schreier covers of the projective line over a fixed finite field as the genus goes to infinity.

The situation is similar for p-adic numbers; we begin by introducing the analogue of floating-point arithmetic for p-adics. We then describe some known and conjectural examples of p-adic numerical stability in which algebraic structures (e.g., cluster algebras) work behind the scenes to keep the loss of numerical precision much lower than one might initially expect. A key example is the Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) condensation algorithm for computing determinants, for which we obtain a partial result towards a conjecture of Robbins.

First, we produce differentially private measurements of interesting graph statistics using our new version of the PINQ programming language, Weighted PINQ, which is based on a generalization of differential privacy to weighted sets. Next, we show how to generate graphs that fit any set of measured graph statistics, even if they are inconsistent (due to noise), or if they are only indirectly related to actual statistics that we want our synthetic graph to preserve. We do this by combining the answers to Weighted PINQ queries with a probabilistic inference technique that allows us to synthesize graphs where the statistic of interest aligns with that of the protected graph. I will show how to cast a few graph statistics (degree distribution, edge multiplicity, joint degree distribution) as queries in Weighted PINQ, and then present experimental results of synthetic graphs generated from the answers to these queries.\n\nJoint work with Davide Proserpio (BU) and Frank McSherry (MSR).\n\nBIO: Sharon Goldberg is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Boston University.

This means by definition that for every natural number A coprime to p there is a natural number e with A^e equiv B bmod p. The smallest such exponent is classically called the index of A modulo p with respect to the base B. Indices are discrete analoga to logarithms, and accordingly nowadays they are usually called discrete logarithms. The question for their efficient computation was already raised in the 19th century but it gained particular relevance because the security of a great number of cryptographic protocols is based on the difficulty of index computation, or, as one says, on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem.Index calculus is a method to compute indices efficiently. Now indices or discrete logarithms can be defined in any finite group, and the question arises if one can substitute the group Fp by another group in which index calculus is not possible. This question lead to the development of elliptic curve cryptography.In the talk I will present the index calculus method and discuss the question if index calculus is possible in elliptic curves.\n\nBIO: Claus Diem is visiting from the University of Leipzig.

Our main motivation is the construction of succinct arguments of NP-statements that are quick to construct and verify. QSPs seem well-suited for this task, perhaps even better than Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs).\n\nIn 2010, Groth constructed a NIZK argument in the common reference String (CRS) model for Circuit-SAT consisting of only 42 elements in a bilinear group. Interestingly, his argument does not (explicitly) use PCPs. But his scheme has some disadvantages — namely, the CRS size and prover computation are both quadratic in the circuit size. In 2011, Lipmaa reduced the CRS size to quasi-linear, but with prover computation still quadratic.\n\nUsing QSPs we construct a NIZK argument in the CRS model for Circuit-SAT consisting of just 7 group elements. The CRS size is linear in the circuit size, and prover computation is quasi-linear, making our scheme seemingly quite practical. (The prover only needs to do a linear number of group operations; the quasi-linear computation is a multipoint evaluation and interpolation.)\n\nOur results are complementary to those of Valiant (TCC 2008) and Bitansky et al. (2012), who use “bootstrapping” (recursive composition) of arguments to reduce CRS size and prover and verifier computation. QSPs also provide a crisp mathematical abstraction of some of the techniques underlying Groth’s and Lipmaa’s constructions.\n\nBIO: Bryan Parno is a researcher in Microsoft Research’s Security and Privacy Research Group.

In this work we focus on the basic question of constructing a multiparty computation protocol secure against a malicious, adaptive adversary in the stand-alone setting without honest majority in the plain model.It has been believed that this question can be resolved by composing known protocols from the literature. We show that in fact, this belief is fundamentally mistaken. In particular, we show:\n\nRound inefficiency is unavoidable when using black-box simulation: There does not exist any o(frac{n}{log{n}}) round protocol that adaptively securely realizes a (natural) n-party functionality with a black-box simulator. Note that most previously known protocols in the adaptive security setting relied on black-box simulators.\n\nA constant round protocol using non-black-box simulation: We construct a constant round adaptively secure multiparty computation protocol in a setting without honest majority that makes crucial use of non-black box techniques.Taken together, these results give the first resolution to the question of adaptively secure multiparty computation protocols with a malicious dishonest majority in the plain model, open since the first formal treatment of adaptive security for multiparty computation in 1996.

Lossy Trapdoor Functions yield simple constructions of pseudorandom generators, collision resistant hash functions, IND-CCA secure cryptosystems, deterministic encryption, leaky pseudoentropy functions and more.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show a number of new constructions of LTFs from a variety of cryptographic primitives and number theoretic assumptions. These constructions can be cast into two broad categories: exploiting (group) homomorphisms of common cryptosystems, and derandomizing randomized lossy primitives.\n\nBIO: Brett Hemenway received his Bachelor’s degree from Brown University in 2004 and his PhD in mathematics from UCLA in 2010 under Rafail Ostrovsky.

This increased privacy awareness has renewed the interest of the research community on cryptographic primitives, such as private information retrieval, oblivious transfer, oblivious RAM, and searchable encryption, which are designed to help users preserve the privacy of their queries and/or access to curious or malicious hosts. In this talk, I will show how we revisited the computational practicality of private information retrieval schemes and found the end-to-end response times of a single-server lattice-based scheme and two multi-server information-theoretic PIR schemes to be one to three orders of magnitude (10 — 1000 times) smaller than the trivial scheme for realistic computation power and network bandwidth. Then, I will describe how we utilized PIR to enhance the scalability of the Tor anonymous communication network by two orders of magnitude. We clarify existing result on the computational practicality of PIR and provide an extension to multi-server PIR schemes and single-server PIR schemes that do not rely heavily on number theory.\n\nBIO: Femi Olumofin earned his PhD in computer science from the University of Waterloo in 2011.

We introduce a new approach to circumventing this result: we consider randomized voting rules that approximate a deterministic voting rule and are approximately strategy-proof. We show that any deterministic voting rule can be approximated by an approximately strategy-proof randomized voting rule, and we provide bounds on the parameters that can be achieved.\n\nBIO: Eleanor Birrell is currently a PhD student at Cornell University, where she works with Rafael Pass and Fred Schneider.\n\nOblivious Access to Remote Data Storage Olya Ohrimenko (Brown University) 2/21 1:30 pm\n\nABSTRACT: The ”cloud” is emerging as the next generation of data storage where users can remotely keep their data and leave its management to a third party, e.g. Amazon S3 or Microsoft Azure. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the data raises new challenges in terms of data privacy. Storing the data in encrypted form is a key component in maintaining the privacy of the data. However, encrypting the data is not enough since information about the data may be leaked through the pattern in which users access the data. We show how to achieve efficient privacy-preserving data access using a combination of encryption, which directly hides data values, and stateless oblivious RAM simulation, which hides the pattern of data accesses.\n\nIn this talk we propose a method with O(log n) worst-case access overhead for simulating users’ requests to outsourced data of size n, using a scheme that is data-oblivious with very high probability. We assume that the simulation has access to a small private workspace but does not maintain state in between data access requests. Our simulation makes use of pseudo-random hash functions and is based on a novel hierarchy of cuckoo hash tables that all share a common stash. The method outperforms all previous techniques for stateless clients in terms of access overhead.\n\nExisting oblivious storage solutions typically involve small amortized overheads for obscuring the access pattern, but nevertheless involve potentially huge variations in access times, depending on when they occur. To this end, we show how to de-amortize oblivious storage simulations so that each request takes a worst-case bounded amount of time.\n\nWe also provide experimental results from a prototype implementation of our scheme. We show that the involved constants are small resulting in at most 2log n round trips for each client request. Finally, we demonstrate that the performance of our stateless scheme is comparable to a more powerful scheme where a client is allowed to keep a state.Joint work with: Michael T.

As a result, many advanced cryptographic protocols are now efficient enough to be considered practical, yet research in the area remains largely theoretical and little work has been done to use these protocols in practice, despite a wealth of potential applications.\n\nThis paper introduces a simple description language, ZKPDL, and an interpreter for this language. ZKPDL implements non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge, a primitive which has received much attention in recent years. Using our language, a single program may specify the computation required by both the prover and verifier of a zero-knowledge protocol, while our interpreter performs a number of optimizations to lower both computational and space overhead.Our motivating application for ZKPDL has been the efficient implementation of electronic cash. As such, we have used our language to develop a cryptographic library, Cashlib, that provides an interface for using e-cash and fair exchange protocols without requiring expert knowledge from the programmer.\n\nThis is joint work with C.

It is similar to oblivious transfer except that the sender is commited to its input. We then generate protocols for Generalized Oblivious Transfer by secret sharing using the Verifiable Oblivious Transfer primitive based on previous work. The protocols are universally composable. The GOT protocol is used to instantiate Batch Single-Choice Cut-And-Choose OT which in conjunction with a modification to the main protocol of [LP11], achieves constant round secure function evaluation based on Yao’s Garbled Circuit. In addition, the idea of GOT is used in conjunction with linear secret sharing and commitments to instantiate a primitive known as Multi-Sender K-Out-of-N OT. This primitive is the most important building block of the optimization of the IPS compiler presented in [LOP11]. In contrast to their specific computational assumptions, our protocols only require black-box Verifiable OT. In addition, the GOT protocols can be used to execute Priced Oblivious Transfer.\n\nPrivacy Amplification and Non-Malleable Extractors Via Character Sums Xin Li (University of Washington) 11/10 2:00 pm\n\nABSTRACT: In studying how to communicate over a public channel with an active adversary, Dodis and Wichs introduced the notion of a non-malleable extractor. A non-malleable extractor dramatically strengthens the notion of a strong extractor in the sense that it requires the output to be close to uniform given the seed as well as the output of the extractor on an arbitrarily related different seed.\n\nWe construct the first explicit non-malleable extractor. Our extractor works for sources with entropy rate above half. To achieve a polynomial running time when outputting many bits, we rely on a widely-believed conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions.\n\nUsing our non-malleable extractor, we obtain protocols for “privacy amplification”: key agreement between two parties who share a weakly-random secret. Our protocols work in the presence of an active adversary with unlimited computational power, and have asymptotically optimal entropy loss. When the secret has entropy rate greater than 1/2, the protocol takes two rounds. When the secret has entropy rate delta for any constant delta>0, our protocol takes a constant (polynomial in 1/delta) number of rounds. Our protocols run in polynomial time under the above well-known conjecture about primes.Joint work with Yevgeniy Dodis, Trevor D.

Both projects are related to the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP): the theoretical foundation of many modern cryptosystems. First I will outline how we have set a new record by solving the ECDLP over a 112-bit prime field using a cluster of PlayStation 3 game consoles in 2009. Next, the negation map optimization is discussed: this is an technique to speed up the Pollard rho method when solving the ECDLP. It is well known that the random walks used by Pollard rho when combined with the negation map get trapped in fruitless cycles. I will present that previously published approaches to deal with this problem are plagued by recurring cycles: effective alternative countermeasures are proposed.\n\nBIO: Joppe Bos is a PhD student under supervision of Prof. Arjen Lenstra at the laboratory for cryptologic algorithms, EPFL, Switzerland.

There are legitimate reasons for biometric matching to be performed by two mutually distrustful parties, where due to privacy and liability considerations, neither party is willing to share its data. Alternatively, biometric experiments run by a single entity are often so large in scale that they are inevitably placed on an untrusted computational cloud or grid, where sensitive biometric data must also be protected. This gives rise to the need to develop secure computation and outsourcing techniques over biometric data where no information is revealed to the participants except the desired outcome of the computation and the outcome of the computation can be trusted. In this talk, I will describe our recent results for securely comparing biometric images and outsourcing computation over biometric data in a robust manner. Most of the talk discusses techniques for matching of iris codes.\n\nBIO: Marina Blanton is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.

I will also explain some applications of our construction to pattern matching and intrusion detection.

For instance, it is commonly assumed that a user wishing to perform secure computation has access to perfect randomness and is performing his computation on a device whose internals are completely shielded from adversarial observation and tampering. This talk will survey some of my recent results on designing cryptographic primitives that are secure under less-than-ideal conditions. I will first present a brief overview of my work on enabling even users with just weak secrets such as biometrics and passwords to do cryptography. I will then present the details of my work on tamper-resilient cryptography which removes the assumption that cryptographic computation is performed in a perfectly sealed black box.\n\nThis talk is based on joint works with Yael Kalai and Amit Sahai (CRYPTO 2011) and Nishanth Chandran, Rafail Ostrovsky and Leonid Reyzin (STOC 2010).\n\nBIO: Bhavana Kanukurthi is a post-doctoral researcher at UCLA, working under the guidance of Prof. Rafail Ostrovsky.

It sidesteps many of the inherent vulnerabilities of the Internet and client platforms but it does not provide end-to-end verification that votes are counted as cast. In this paper, we propose a simple technique to enhance the verifiability of code voting by ensuring that the Vote Server can only access the acknowledgement codes if the vote code is correctly registered by a threshold set of Trustees. The mechanism adds an extra level of verifiability in registering and counting the vote. Voter-verification is simple and direct: the voters need only check that the acknowledgement code returned to them agrees with the value on their code sheet. To ensure receipt-freeness we propose the use of a single acknowledgement code per code sheet, rather than individual acknowledgement codes for each candidate as with usual code voting.\n\nI will first present Pretty Good Democracy for voting schemes in which the voter selects a single candidate, then show how it can be extended to more expressive voting schemes such as Borda, approval voting and STV.(Joint work with Peter Ryan, University of Luxembourg, and James Heather, University of Surrey.)\n\nBIO: Dr Vanessa Teague is a researcher at the University of Melbourne.

Both have many applications to cryptography and coding theory, and the main computational problems for number fields, such as computing the ring of integers and computing the class group and the unit group, have analogues over function fields. The complexity of the number field problems has been studied extensively and these problems have been the source of some exponential speedups by quantum computation. In this paper we study the analogous problems in function fields. We show that there are efficient quantum algorithms for computing the unit group, the class group and for solving the principal ideal problem in function fields of arbitrary degree. We show that compact representations exist, which allows us to show that the principal ideal problem is in NP. Unlike the number field case, we are also able to show that these compact representatives can be computed efficiently.\n\nBIO: Sean Hallgren is an Associate Professor at Penn State University. He works on quantum computation, with an emphasis on understanding when there are exponential speedups by quantum algorithms.

This work has advanced our understanding of basic technologies such as public key encryption, key agreement, and digital signatures. Moreover, it has given us entirely new paradigms for securing data, such as Attribute Based Encryption, anonymous credentials and techniques for computing on encrypted data.\n\nDespite these advances, only a trickle of new cryptographic technology has filtered down to the systems community in the form of useable cryptographic implementations. Even supported prototype research implementations are few and far between. This is a major loss for researchers, to say nothing of industry and the open source community.\n\nIn this talk we introduce Charm, an extensible Python-based framework for rapidly prototyping cryptographic systems. Charm was designed from the ground up to support the development of advanced cryptographic schemes. It includes support for multiple cryptographic settings, an extensive library of re-usable code, along with the infrastructure necessary to quickly implement interactive protocols. Our framework also provides a series of specialized tools that enable different cryptosystems to interoperate.\n\nThis paper describes Charm and the various capabilities provided through our modular architecture. Through several examples, we show that our approach produces a potential order of magnitude decrease in code size compared to standard C implementations, while inducing an acceptable performance impact.\n\nBIO: Matthew Green is an Assistant Research Professor at the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute.
