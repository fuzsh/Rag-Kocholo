        "text": "Research\n\nShai Halevi's research interests are in cryptography and security. He has published numerous original technical research papers, three of which were awarded the IBM Pat Goldberg memorial best-paper award (in 2004, 2012, and 2013). Notable contributions by Shai Halevi include:\n\nObfuscation. Halevi is a co-inventor of the first candidate general-purpose cryptographic obfuscation schemes, with security based on a mathematical conjecture. This development generated much interest in the cryptography community and was called \"a watershed moment for cryptography.\"\n\nCryptographic Multilinear Maps. Halevi is a co-inventor of Cryptographic Multilinear Maps (which constitute the main technical tool behind crytographic obfuscation and many other applications), solving a long-standing open problem\n\nHomomorphic Encryption. Halevi is one of the leading researchers on homomorphic encryption. He authored many articles, gave invited lectures and tutorials on the topic, and he is also the principal developer (together with Victor Shoup) of the HElib homormophic-encryption software library.\n\nThe Random Oracle Model. Halevi co-authored the influential work that pointed out for the first time the existence of \"structurally flawed\" cryptosystems that nonetheless have a proof of security in the random-oracle model.\n\nSince 2013 Halevi is the chair of the steering committee of the Theory of Cryptography Conference. He served on the board of directors of the International Association for Cryptologic Research. He chaired the CRYPTO conference in 2009 and co-chaired the TCC conference in 2006. Halevi also gave many invited talks, including in the USENIX Security Symposium in 2008 and the PKC conference in 2014.\n\nSoftware\n\nHalevi maintains two open-source software projects: The HElib homomorphic-encryption library, and a web-system for submission/review of articles to academic conferences"
