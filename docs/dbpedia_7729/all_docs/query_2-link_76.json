        "text": "Topics in group theory students seminar\n\nThe Hebrew University\n\nAlon Dogon and I organized a graduate student's seminar on topics in group theory.\n\nOther past organizers: Oren Becker, Bharatram Rangarajan, Amitay Kamber.\n\n2022 Fall semester\n\nThe topic of this semester is algebraic and arithmetic groups. We work in parallel to the IAS seminar organized by Alex Lubotzky and Peter Sarnak.\n\n2021 Spring semester\n\nProfinite rigidity. Notes. (Amir Behar)\n\nCommuting probabilities of finite groups. Notes 1,2 (Tzoor Plotnikov)\n\nBuildings in the context of symmetric spaces. (Ido Grayevsky)\n\nIntroduction to character theory. (Itamar Vigdorovich)\n\nClassical rigidity theorems via characters on groups. Notes (Alon Dogon)\n\nTopological full groups and local embeddings into finite groups. (Danielle Dona)\n\nThe seminar takes place on Wednesdays 16:00 to 17:30 in room 110 Manchester building\n\n2021 Fall semester\n\nInvariant Random Subgroups: Stuck-Zimmer Theorem Notes. (Amitay Kamber)\n\nSimple groups of dynamical origin. Notes. Additional notes (Alon Dogon)\n\nBounded cohomology and simplicial volume. Notes.

(Alon Dogon)\n\nVertex expansion and spectral expansion. Notes1. Notes2. (Amitay Kamber)\n\nThe seminar takes place on Tuesdays, 14:00 to 15:45 on ZOOM.\n\n2019 Spring semester\n\nKazhdan's Property (T): characterizations, proofs for various groups and applications -- [Notes] (Oren Becker)\n\nOzawa's proof method of Property (T) for Aut(Fn). (Hagai Levner)\n\nGarland's method in the combinatorial setting -- [Notes] (Amitay Kamber)\n\nBroder-Shamir's theorem on the expansion of random graphs. (Michael Chapman)\n\nThe seminar took place on Sundays, 17:00 to 20:00, at the Junior Staff Room, Ross Building (near the kitchen).\n\nPossible future topics\n\nIntroduction to algebraic and arithmetic groups.\n\nGroup Actions on Trees and Bass-Serre theory.\n\nThe profinite topology on abstract groups with interesting examples.\n\nHyperbolic groups.\n\nGrowth in groups: subgroup growth, Dehn function, Gromov's polynomial growth theorem.\n\nThe talks are meant to be highly accessible to all graduate students.\n\nStallings' Foldings and their applications\n\n2017-2018 spring semester -- The Hebrew University\n\nNoam Kolodner and I, with help from Ori Parzanchevski, organised a seminar centred around Stallings' foldings and their applications. The goal of the seminar was to study the paper Measure Preserving Words are Primitive by Puder and Parzanchevski. Lecture notes (Partially Hebrew): [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]\n\nJuly 2019 update: Recently Ofir David uploaded to arXiv a paper related to what we have done in the seminar and specifically to the talk he gave (link to the paper on arXiv)\n\nAnnouncement June 2021: There is a second round of this amazing workshop. YouTube. Website. This year the topics are\n\nIsoperimetry.\n\nCubulated groups and virtual specialness.\n\nThe Poisson boundary and bounded harmonic functions on groups.\n\nAnosov representations of hyperbolic groups.\n\nAcylindrically and relatively hyperbolic groups.\n\nArtin groups\n\nJuly 20-31, 2020\n\nI mentored the \"Expander Graphs\" exercise session.\n\nVideos from the workshop are available in the following link: GGTWB YouTube. If you want to learn either of the following subjects, the videos are highly recommended:\n\nExpander graphs.\n\nBass-Serre theory.\n\nThe mapping class group.\n\nAutomorphisms of free groups and outer space.\n\nIncoherence.\n\nHierarchically hyperbolic groups."
