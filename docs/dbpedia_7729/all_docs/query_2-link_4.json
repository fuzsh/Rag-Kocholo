        "text": "Sound the pibroch loud and high. We lost Ross Anderson yesterday. He was many things: security researcher, teacher, cryptographer, blogger, Cambridge professor, consultant, conference organiser, FRS, FREng, campaigner and piper. If you want to understand cybersecurity, there is no better way to start than by reading Ross' book: \"Security Engineering\". Typically for Ross, chapters are freely available on Ross' home page at the Cambridge Computer Lab. Or by watching the Security Engineering lecturers he recorded with Sam Ainsworth (Edinburgh University) and uploaded to YouTube. Ross showed us the importance of thinking clearly about security. Not the hype, but the engineering. He was always willing to listen to new ideas, consider them fairly and to share his insights. When I started thinking about the implications of Post Quantum Cryptography it was Ross that told me to think about compliance, audit and cyber-insurance in large enterprises. Ross' legacy is in the students he taught, the PhDs he supervised and the people he inspired. I will miss him. #security #cryptography #cambridge https://lnkd.in/d6C2MKi9\n\nRoss Anderson, professor and famed author of ‘Security Engineering,’ passes away. Why it matters: 1. The loss of Ross Anderson, a leading figure in the cyber security field, is significant as his prolific contributions to computing, machine learning, and security helped shape a new generation of best practices. 2. Anderson's groundbreaking work in cryptographic protocols and hardware reverse engineering made him a vital part of global data protection. His departure adds a layer of vulnerability to these areas. 3. As an ardent advocate for individual privacy, Anderson's absence shines a crucial spotlight on the ongoing importance of privacy and security in the digital age. His commitment to education underscores the need for continued professional development in this evolving field.

I cannot believe it has already been over three years. One topic I did not dive into was Lattice-based cryptography. I recently took time to work on understanding this area of post-quantum cryptography and felt that it is important in understanding our future of information security. Lattice-based #cryptography relies on the mathematical structure of lattices, which are grids of points in a multidimensional space. Their perceived computational difficulty is what provides us a promising landscape of post-quantum cryptographical solutions. As the number of lattice points increases the difficulty of finding certain lattice vectors increases. Under the assumption of this security it is believed that the difficulty spans traditional computation and quantum computation. Currently, there may be no efficient algorithms able to solve lattice problems across the board without a level of exponential time growth in completing it. Luckily there are many experts working on this aspect of #informationsecurity, such as those with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Microsoft, and IBM, or more specific researchers such as Shai Halevi and Vinod Vaikuntanathan, because my mere summary here does lattice-based cryptography minimal justice. I look forward to learning more and to the future of information security in a post-quantum computing age. Lattice by lattice for quantum-resistant tomorrow.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt said, “In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.” We are seeing doing nothing play out. In computer science, the concept of mitigation represents a critical crossroads where the path chosen has profound implications for the integrity and security of a system. Understanding this involves recognizing the binary and bifurcated nature of decision-making within the field. Mitigation can be equated to a choice to tolerate and manage an existing error rather than taking corrective action to rectify the root cause. In computer science, where decisions are binary and once made, persist until deliberately changed, the choice to mitigate retains the error and attempts control the fallout or damage stemming from that error. “Scientific integrity of action”, in this context, involves a commitment to correcting errors when they are identified rather than opting for a path of tolerating failure and managing the resulting damage. Correcting errors aligns with the fundamental principles of computer science, where decisions are considered as bifurcations, and once on a specific path, the only way to transition to another fork is to revisit the initial decision and make the necessary correction. The choice between correcting errors and mitigating their impact represents a philosophical divergence in computer science practices. Corrective action adheres to the principles of scientific integrity by addressing the root cause and preventing its recurrence. On the other hand, mitigation, while managing the immediate consequences, perpetuates a flawed system, leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed, and geometrically growing, while inviting future exploits. In essence, the decision to mitigate or correct errors embodies a broader philosophical stance within computer science. Mitigation accepts the persistence of flaws, leaving a system vulnerable to repeated incidents, while correction aligns with the principles of binary decision-making, acknowledging that a flawed choice requires revisiting and rectification. Ultimately, scientific integrity of action in computer science requires an ongoing commitment to identifying and rectifying errors, ensuring that systems operate in accordance with established principles and standards. This approach not only aligns with the binary and bifurcated nature of decision-making but also reinforces the discipline's core values of precision, accuracy, and security. Unrestricted public access to a company’s secure activity is the persistent unaddressed error in cybersecurity, EAID technology corrects the error eliminating the source of most exploits.
