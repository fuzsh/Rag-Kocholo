Title:

More on Proofs of Knowledge

Authors: Shai Halevi, Silvio Micali

Abstract:

The notion of proofs of knowledge is central to cryptographic

protocols, and many definitions for it have been proposed. In this work

we explore a different facet of this notion, not addressed by prior

definitions. Specifically, prior definitions concentrate on capturing

the properties of the verifier, and do not pay much attention to the

properties of the prover.

Our new definition is strictly stronger than previous ones, and captures

new and desirable properties. In particular, it guarantees prover

feasibility, that is, it guarantees that the time spent by the prover

in a proof of knowledge is comparable to that it spends in an “extraction”

of this knowledge. Our definition also enables one to consider meaningfully

the case of a single, specific prover.
