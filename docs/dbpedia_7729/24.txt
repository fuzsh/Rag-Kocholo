Weizmann Institute of Science

Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science

Lecture Series in Cryptography and Complexity

This lecture series is planned to feature approximately 20 lectures a year, by leading researchers in the field. The focus on Cryptography and Complexity is aimed to build on Weizmann's strength in these areas and to enrich is by offering a variety of new perspectives and new developements.
