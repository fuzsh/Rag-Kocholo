        "text": "2003: Debut album 'Fallen'\n\nAfter being signed by Wind-up Records in 2002, the band released their debut album 'Fallen' in 2003. To promote the album, Evanescence headlined the Nintendo Fusion tour in 2003. 'Fallen' spent a whopping 43 weeks in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 and was certified 7Ã— Platinum in the US after selling more than 17 million copies worldwide. The album included hit singles 'Bring Me to Life', 'My Immortal', 'Going Under' and 'Everybody's Fool'. Mega hit 'Bring Me to Life', featuring guest vocals from Paul McCoy from the band 12 Stones, was an international success, reaching Number 5 on the American Billboard Hot 100 and hitting the top spot in the UK Chart.\n\n2006: Line-up change and follow-up record\n\nAfter parting ways with both Will Boyd and Ben Moody, Evanescence and the success of their Grammy wins, Evanescence went back into the studio to record their follow-up album. After 18 months of writing and producing, the band released 'Open Door' in 2006. The album featured singles 'Call Me When Your Sober', 'Lithium', 'Weight Of The World' and 'Sweet Sacrifice' and debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard 200. The album and single 'Call Me When You're Sober' have since achieve 2x Platinum and Platinum status in the US respectively.\n\n2012: Hiatus and Amy Lee's solo project\n\nEvanescence announced that they would be going on a hiatus in 2012, with Amy announcing in NME: \"I haven't been sitting down to write. I'm thinking we'll take a break first. I'm really not sure what I'll do next. At the end of any really long tour you need to get your head in order. I think at the end of the run we'll go on a break for a while and figure things out.\n\n\"Taking long breaks is seen as a bad thing, but I don't think it's a bad thing. People have the idea that you have to keep putting stuff out while people remember you. But I'd rather make something that's awesome and then make people remember again. I hope it doesn't take five years, but I don't want to put a timeline on it either. We'll all be doing our own thing for a while. They're (my bandmates) very talented and they'll all be fine.\"\n\nAmy Lee went on to release solo album 'Aftermath' in 2014, a soundtrack for Mark Jackson's film War Story. She said of the project: \"It's not what you'd expect; there's a lot of blending of sounds, a lot of ominous tones. I play a lot of keyboard, and a lot of Taurus pedal. There's a lot of low drones.\"\n\n2020: Brand new music\n\nIn 2020, Evanescence released four new singles, 'Wasted On You', 'The Game Is Over', 'Yeah Right' and 'Use My Voice', which all appear on the band's fifth album, 'The Bitter Truth'. First announced in 2018, it was meant to be released in 2020, but had to be delayed due to the pandemic. 'The Bitter Truth' is not only the band's first album in three years, but also their first album with all-new material since 'Evanescence'.\n\n2023: 'Fallen' CD eyeshadow palette\n\nIn January 2023, Evanescence announced that they had collaborated with cosmetics brand HipDot, creating a 'Fallen' CD eyeshadow palette to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Taking inspiration from the colour palette from the album's cover, the eight different shades are also inspired by, and named after, songs on the album. Examples include a matte muted blue called 'Bring Me To Life', and a foiled royal blue for 'My Immortal'.\n\nSharing the news of the palette's launch, the band wrote: 'We're excited to announce that we've partnered with @hipdot to create this Fallen CD eyeshadow palette to celebrate its 20th anniversary this year!\n\nThe collection is vegan, free of harmful ingredients, certified cruelty-free, and curated to embrace all skin tones.'\n\n2023: 'Fallen' celebrates its 20th anniversary\n\nOn 28th September 2023, Evanescence celebrated the 20th anniversary of their debut album 'Fallen', which brought us huge tracks such as 'Bring Me To Life' and 'Going Under'. To celebrate, the band released remastered versions of the album and a Super Deluxe Edition box set, with the physical copies containing more hidden gems.\n\nThey wrote: 'Thank you for an incredible two decades!! ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Fallen, we'll be releasing remastered versions of the album on 2-LP, 2-CD, digital, and in a Super Deluxe Edition box set. All physical formats will include previously-unseen photos from the era, a handwritten foreword, and a rare selection of B-sides and recordings. The limited edition box set includes a cassette of 10 previously unreleased demos and voice notes, a book featuring new track-by-track notes, a custom turntable slipmat, plus a set of rare photo prints and enamel pin set round out the collection.\n\n'All Fallen 20th anniversary items are available for preorder in the link in bio! The double vinyl, 2-CD, and digital remasters will be available on November 17th, and the deluxe box sets will be out in February '24.' (sic)"
