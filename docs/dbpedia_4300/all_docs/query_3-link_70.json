        "text": "With their unique blend of haunting, atmospheric and gothic-flavored rock, multi-platinum-selling group Evanescence first broke into the mainstream in the early 2000s, bringing much-needed disruption to the male-dominated hard-rock scene of the time. Fronted by one of the most dynamic women in rock —singer-pianist Amy Lee — Evanescence had humble beginnings. Initially a duo, the band was formed when Little Rock, AR-based Amy and guitarist Ben Moody met at camp. The teens played and recorded throughout the latter-half of the ‘90s, eventually filling out the group with guitarist John LeCompt, drummer Rocky Gray and bassist Will Boyd. The quintet released their full-length debut, Fallen, in 2003 to wide commercial success. Having sold over 17 million copies worldwide to-date, the album peaked at Number Three on the Billboard 200—bolstered by hit singles “Bring Me To Life,” “My Immortal” and “Going Under”—and earned the band five GRAMMY® nominations including two wins: Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance.\n\nThe group, which would undergo several lineup changes over the years, including the departure of Moody in 2003, followed with studio LP The Open Door (2006), as well as a live album and concert film Anywhere but Home (2004). Proving the band’s enduring appeal, The Open Door went to Number One and led to an exhaustive worldwide tour for Evanescence. After some time off, fans were eager for new material, and the band didn’t disappoint, dropping a self-titled record in October of 2011. The highly-anticipated album debuted, once again, at Number One, kicking off another lengthy tour of the world.\n\nIn recent years, Amy Lee has continued to write and record her own music, releasing two solo titles, while also appearing live with Evanescence. In 2017, the band issued a vinyl retrospective box set, The Ultimate Collection, and ended their six-year recording hiatus with album Synthesis, which reinterprets the band’s classic material with orchestral arrangements and beautiful new vocal performances by Lee."
