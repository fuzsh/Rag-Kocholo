The discussion touched on an essential question: Is the historical sidelining of certain departments or teams contributing to a siloed mindset, hindering cross-departmental collaboration and strategic involvement from the outset? üí° The shift towards a more integrated approach can lead to more robust strategies, innovative solutions, and a stronger, more cohesive organizational culture. Let's use this insight as a catalyst for change, advocating for a seat at the table for all departments and professionals, and ensuring diverse perspectives are not just welcomed but actively sought out. #Collaboration #StrategicInclusion #OrganizationalCulture #Leadership #Innovation\n\nGreat example from Dominic Barton ex Global CEO McKinsey and Co. Valid points taking ownership of your learning and journey. Shape a vision that is exciting and challenging for your team (or division/unit/organization). Translate that vision into a clear strategy about what actions to take, and what not to do. Recruit, develop, and reward a team of great people to carry out the strategy. Focus on measurable results. Foster innovation and learning to sustain your team (or organization) and grow new leaders. Lead yourself ‚Äî know yourself, improve yourself, and manage the appropriate balance in your own life."
