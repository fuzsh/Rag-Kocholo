        "text": "The episode you’re about to hear is all about… giant robots, plastic and the sea. Now, you might be thinking, how on earth are these three things connected? And what do they have to do with innovative solutions?\n\nFortunately, today’s guest is here to help explain everything. In this episode you’ll hear from Ben Moody, the co-founder of Seven Clean Seas, an organisation that’s on a mission to rid our oceans of plastic waste whilst empowering coastal communities. Ben and the team have been hard at work building scalable solutions to plastic pollution in some of the most affected places on the planet, with several active projects across Thailand and Indonesia. The natural flow of rivers in these locales makes them especially vulnerable to accumulation of plastic waste, which is why the Seven Clean Seas team have made them a top priority.\n\nThe company utilises a suite of best-fit solutions, including plastic collection efforts, recycling and even transforming plastic waste into energy. And in the process, the teams not only clean up the environment, but also foster social impact, through the creation of local jobs and education initiatives.\n\nBen and I took a deep dive, pardon the pun, into the ways in which Seven Clean Seas actually gets to the business of… well… achieving seven clean seas, including the launch of what the company calls a “super-mega plastic-killer robot.” We probably spent way too much time on that one.\n\nWe also talked about how a chance encounter during a random beach cleanup led to the founding of the company, how they are helping local communities, why research alone won’t solve the plastic crisis, how each of us can start making a difference right now, and much more.\n\nBen’s enthusiasm, authenticity and passion around the topics of environmental and social initiatives is absolutely contagious, in fact it’s one of the first things I noticed during our conversations – you can sense it immediately and can’t help but want to get on board with what the team is trying to achieve. We actually went into that as well, exploring both the ambitious goal of removing 10 million kilos of plastic from the ocean by 2025, but also why he’s so optimistic and excited, and how that plays into the company’s messaging and communications strategy.\n\nThis is a classic episode in every sense – it’s a story of innovation, of shifting your mindset from noticing problems to seeking solutions, and finding New Ways to create positive impact, for people and the planet.\n\nAbove all else, I left this conversation with a newfound respect for the awesome power of optimism… and I hope you do as well.\n\nBen/Seven Clean Seas\n\n⁠sevencleanseas.com⁠\n\n⁠@sevencleanseas⁠\n\n@sevencleanseas\n\nben@sevencleanseas.com\n\nTopics we cover\n\nThe events that led to the company’s founding\n\nWhy they built a “super-mega plastic-killer robot” (HIPPO)\n\nThe link between social and environmental issues\n\nHow research alone won’t solve these problems\n\nStorytelling and getting people to care about their mission\n\nThe power of optimism\n\nWhy empathy and authenticity are so important\n\nWhat makes Ben so excited about the future\n\nThe plan to remove 10 million kilos of ocean plastic by 2025\n\nWhat’s next for Seven Clean Seas\n\nBen’s take on a modern remedy for the challenges we are facing\n\nResources"
