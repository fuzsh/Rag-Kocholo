        "text": "Evanescence star addressed rumours she was LP’s new singer\n\nEvanescence vocalist Amy Lee has addressed rumours that she might be Linkin Park’s new singer, saying they’re not true but adding that it was a “huge compliment” and that she could do it “part time”.\n\nRumours that Linkin Park were working with a female vocalist apparently started after Orgy frontman Jay Gordon appeared on the ‘Wired in the Empire’ radio show.\n\nTalking about Linkin Park he said: “It’s going to be tough without Chester Bennington, but we’ll see. I hear they got a girl singer now. That’s what I heard.”\n\nWhen pressed further he added: “Don’t quote me on that. I’m not sure who the singer is going to be, but I heard it was gonna be female. They might just try to move on like that. That ought to be interesting.”\n\nHe later rowed back on the comments on social media but not before Amy Lee was established as a fan favourite for the role.\n\nWatch: Linkin Park and Evanescence mash-up - 'Numb Life'\n\nAsked about the rumours on Canada's iHeart Radio, Lee said: “That is an incredible compliment.\n\n\"I have not heard that. No, I have not been contacted or anything like that. But (I'm a) huge fan, feel like our worlds, our fanbases are a lot of the same people.\"\n\nShe continued: \"That's really sweet…I don't know if (Evanescence and Linkin Park) were on a festival together or whatever. We met. We were in the studio at the same time. When we were making 'Fallen', I just briefly got to have a conversation or two with Chester. He was really sweet.”\n\nReturning to the rumours that she was Linkin Park’s new singer she clarified: \"But no, it's not true. But that's awesome. They should ask me about that. I don't have a ton of free time, but I might do it part time.\"\n\nGallery: Evanescence through the years\n\nListen to Absolute Radio across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen or by asking your smart speaker to \"play Absolute Radio\"."
