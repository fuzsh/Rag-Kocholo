I understand\"\n\n\"No Amy\" he said grabbing her hand looking at it for a minute before like looking up at her eyes. \"I'm married\"\n\n\"What? Why would you kiss me if you're m-\" she asked. Stopping half way.\n\nA tear ran down her face. And Ben reached up to wipe it.\n\n\"Stop\" she said before he could.\n\nHer pain turned to anger. \"I swear you are still the biggest asshole then you were back then\" she said referring to back when he was In the band. \"I'm leaving\"\n\n\"No wait Amy\" he said\n\n\"Why? Why should I stop for you? So you can feed me lies about how great of a guy you are? Huh is that it Benjamin.\"\n\n\"Amy I'm sorry. I really sorry.

You are a dick\"\n\nAmy got up and started walking away till she found the exit.\n\nShe then texted her mother asking if she could come get her.\n\nAbout 45 minutes of waiting her mother showed up.\n\n\"So how'd it go?\"\n\n\"I miss josh\" she said bursting into tears."
