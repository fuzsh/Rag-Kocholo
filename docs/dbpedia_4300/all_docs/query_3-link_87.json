        "text": "It has been a joy to serve with Cru for almost 25 years. My first 6 years were spent at Kansas State University where I had the blessing of mentoring over 30 students as they grew in their love for Christ and their understanding of His word. A majority of these women continue to influence their families, their communities, and their coworkers for Christ. One of them, Melissa, now serves with her husband and their 3 sweet kids in Francophone Africa.\n\nFollowing my time at K-State God allowed me to serve as the STINT/Intern Coordinator for the Great Plains International Region for three years. It was incredibly exciting to recruit, train, send, and care for over 60 interns each year who served all over the world.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, I joined the staff team at the University of Colorado in Boulder. It was developmental to serve on this spiritually diverse campus. I am so thankful for the opportunities that God gave me to share the Gospel and to walk with students as they grew in their love for Jesus. Five of these students now serve as missionaries around the world.\n\nSince 2010, I have called Orlando, FL home. During my first seven years here I served in the US Campus ministry on both the National 100% Sent Team and the National Summer Missions Team. These two teams gave me the opportunity to live out one of my greatest passions, seeing missional leaders equipped and sent to make an impact for God's glory. In 100% Sent, we focused on preparing every Cru graduate to live surrendered lives to Christ and make Him known in their spheres of influence, by providing tools, conversations, vision and experiences to help them live that out. Our prayer is that every single alumni will become a lifelong. multiplying disciple. Every year we sent over 3,000 students on Summer Missions on over 200 summer missions around the world.\n\nI joined the Global Student-Led Movements team in 2017. Our team is led by Cru's Vice President of Student Led Movements. Student-led movement refers to all of Cru's global college, university, and high school movements. It is such a blessing and privilege to have a front-row seat to see God’s work in the lives of students around the world. God has allowed me to live out my passion to see graduates sent well in my role as co-leader of the 100% Sent strategy Globally. I believe that equipping our students to walk with Christ and have an impact in their context is one of the most significant things we can do as Cru staff. I am trusting God for the day with thousands of graduates living surrendered lives to Christ and using their gifts for His glory."
