        "text": "Ring\n\nViscount/Viscountess of EvThreads\n\nKaty > Gaga\n\nPosts: 600\n\nPost by Ring on\n\nThis entire thing was explained on EvBoard already.\n\nDouble A Edit:\n\nThis was originally posted on Josh Newell's MySpace. The link on EvBoard now does not work which leads us to assume he deleted his profile. Do not go looking for this guy or cause any trouble with him. He just went with the flow so-to-speak, and did what he was told to do by writers and producers.\n\nand now for the true story: about two years ago, a production company approached the studio with the idea of shooting a reality show based on what it's \"really like\" working at a studio. studio recording's not quite as cut and dry as they make it look on tv and in the videos, and it's an interesting business. people come from all over the country to LA to try to make it in the industry, in bands and as engineers, neither of which is very easy.\n\ni agreed to participate in the taping of the footage for the show's trailer/pitch tape. initially, the show was pitched to us as being very documentary style, but it soon became obvious that they wanted to focus on the celebrities. made sense to me. people like celebrities.\n\nwell, to be honest, being at a studio isn't always all that exciting. most of the time it's just running errands or sitting in a room playing things over and over 'til you get them right. since they had a time frame to work in, they decided to stage some events, just for the sake of the trailer so they could get the footage they needed fast.\n\nat the time, kelly clarkson was in working on some songs with ben and david, who since their departure from evanescence have been producing fairly regularly. the studio had received a platinum record for the evanescence album (most of it was recorded at our place), but neither ben nor david were in the photo on the plaque.\n\nben's a friend of the studio and is there a lot working on projects so he called their label and had them send out a plaque with a different photo on it. that's understandable. he put a lot of work into the album; he and david wrote it, and he's the one at the studio a lot.\n\nwhen the tv guys found this out, they had us stage the whole getting the plaque in and ben and david getting pissed off bit. the next part of the little faux story line was to have ben, david, kelly clarkson, and matt zane go toilet paper \"amy lee's\" house. i was asked to go along so that they'd have someone from the studio in the shots too.\n\nthey rented a van, and then had us drive out to jay gordon's house. jay is the singer of orgy and another friend of the studio's. we toilet papered his house, which was really funny for me as i've now toilet papered a yard with a number of platinum-selling artists.\n\nso no harm, no foul, as it was all faked.\n\nthe show never got picked up. and so we've had this trailer sitting around. matt zane (who you may know from the band society 1) has continued to try to get the show picked up, and my guess is that he's the one who re-edited the clip and posted it online to generate some publicity. as the clip is posted as \"Kelly Clarkson Vandalizes House With Matt Zane of Society 1,\" and it's been re-edited to remove the bulk of the cast member introductions except for his, i'd venture my guess is probably pretty accurate.\n\nand i guess it's gotten some publicity. it is/was a top-viewed clip on youtube, and as i said, i got an e-mail from a friend of mine saying she saw it on E!\n\nlast i heard, the production company wants to sue matt, kelly clarkson's people are pissed, as are ben and david's, and i haven't even talked to anyone from the studio about it yet.\n\nand apparently evanescence fans are now upset at kelly clarkson for getting involved in a faux argument. then again, these kids think evanescence is good so why should one expect them to have the capacity to differentiate between reality and television?\n\non the plus side for me, i always thought the way the original production company edited the show made me look like a bit of a cliched \"i'm from a small town and am rebelling\" kind of douche bag. now with this edit, it just looks like spend my time running around the hollywood hills \"vandalizing\" houses with celebrities. yeah, it's a hard job, but someone's got to do it.\n\nRarkphoenix\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nAlways find my place among the ashes...\n\nPosts: 1,416\n\nPost by Rarkphoenix on\n\nAndromeda - Evanescent-Killjoy I know right? I'm sure it was totally necessary to add this:\n\nthen again, these kids think evanescence is good so why should one expect them to have the capacity to differentiate between reality and television?\n\nMeh, it's their loss if they happen to dislike Evanescence. \"Good\" and \"bad\" are subjective after all. It does amuse me that they're implying that being an Evhead automatically makes one an idiot, in my experience it's invariably the opposite - but then I am biased\n\nI actually enjoyed this clip, a reality T.V./docudrama show based in a studio isn't a bad idea in my opinion, as long as they throw in some genuinely useful facts along the way and keep it grounded in reality then I don't see why you can't have crazy little things like Ben teepeeing Amy's house as long as it's made clear at the beginning and end of the programme that it's a drama rather than a pure documentary. It could only have been funnier if it was done now that the dust has settled a bit and they got Amy to play herself charging after them with her baseball bat, hehe."
