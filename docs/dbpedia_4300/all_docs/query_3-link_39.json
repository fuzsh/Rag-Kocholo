        "text": "At Cornell\n\nMoody played in three contests in 2011, earning two carries. He had a four-yard run against Wagner and also saw time against Bucknell and Harvard before missing the final seven games of the season due to injury. Moody missed the entire 2010 season due to injury, but has the speed and football instincts to earn significant time at receiver in 2012. He played running back, wide receiver and on special teams as a freshman while earning his first varsity letter in 2010. Moody ran the ball nine times for 36 yards and his only catch came on a 16-yard touchdown strike against Dartmouth. In the season finale against Penn, Moody ran six times for 31 yards, including a 21-yard run against the Ivy League's top defense. Moody is enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nAt Lakeview\n\nMoody was named Associated Press honorable mention Division III All-Ohio as a senior at Lakeview HS, a season in which he he ran for 1,228 yards and 17 touchdowns and had 276 yards and four touchdowns receiving. He rushed for over 100 yards four different times, highlighted by a career-best 341 yards, five touchdown performance. Moody was also a four-time letter-winner as a member of the schoolâ€™s track and field team. As a senior, Moody took first in the state in the 100 and the 110 hurdles, was part of the bronze medalist the 4x100 relay and was fourth in the long jump.\n\nPersonal\n\nBenjamin Robert Moody is the son of Robert and Kathy Moody."
