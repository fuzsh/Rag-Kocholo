        "text": "Hi! This time I’m doing a post on the song Everything Burns by Anastacia and Ben Moody. The song was produced in 2005 for the movie Fantasic Four. Here are the lyrics, and here is the video:\n\nAnastacia has a very special voice, which some people don’t quite like, but I do. I thought at first this sounded like a strange duo, but after listening to the song a couple of times, I got used to the idea, and I think the song is nice. The lyrics are a little sad, but also pretty good. I think the piano melody towards the end was sweet. I like the fact that they take it slow with just the guitar until the second refrain, and then taking it all out till the end.\n\n“All of this hate, and all of this pain\n\nI’ll burn it all down, as my anger reigns\n\n‘Till everything burns”\n\n(Everything Burns – Anastacia feat Ben Moody)\n\nWell, Hello! Today’s song, and first artist for this challenge, is “Innocence” by the American rock band Halestorm. The band was founded by the siblings Lzzy(her actual name is Elizabeth, but her stage name is Lzzy) and Arejay Hale (thereof the name Halestorm). The song was released on their self titled album (Halestorm) in 2009. The song was actually co-written by Ben Moody, which is the co-founder, and previous member of Evanescence (ironically, I’ve listened to this for a while, and checked out just now about the song, and there his name was… funny how things like that happen to me). You can read the lyrics here. Enjoy the song!\n\nI absolutely adore the guitar riffs. Really fantastic. Lzzy’s got an amazing voice (her actual name is Elizabeth Hale, but her stage name is Lzzy). You really hear it in the mid of the song, after the bridge, “Child don’t follow me home”, I got chills the first time I listened to that.\n\nThey’re different. The lyrics are not all that mushy and all about love. The song is more of the bitchy type, if you know what I mean. She’s still the girl, but the roles are kind of different, turned in a way. Normally you would think that it’s the girl who’s the “child”, but since it’s Lzzy who’s singing, it seems as she wants a boy’s “innocence”. That’s pretty neat to me, it makes me feel powerful as a girl. You can hear it in their other songs too, the kick-ass lyrics, you get confidence as a girl when you listen to them, and that’s great. Different, but definitely brilliant.\n\n“If you choose to stay you’ll throw it all away\n\nAnd I just want to take your innocence”\n\n(Innocence – Halestorm)\n\nHi there again! Sorry for the long stop in my blogging. Family is really time consuming!\n\nAnyway, now I’m back, and today I’ve chosen Burn by We Are The Fallen. First, as usual, we have the lyrics here.\n\nThe song was first released on the album “Tear The World Down” in 2010. And next, as usual, we have the video:\n\nNow, after taking in that beautiful, strong and hard core song, I need to say that it’s one of the best songs by We Are The Fallen I’ve heard. They’re relatively fresh, so it’s just been one album, but it was great all the same. Well, I feel it’s necessary to say, for those who didn’t know, that the band consists mostly of ex-Evanescence members: Ben Moody, Rocky Gray and John LeCompt (and another guitarist, Marty O’Brien), and also powered by vocals from Carly Smithson. Some of you, who knows a little about their history, they will probably think that I’m being “unfaithful” to Evanescence or something, but I just care about the music, (although I find some of Ben’s comments really annoying) and I still love Evanescence above all artists, not that it matters…\n\nNow, for the real mission: The song.\n\nFor the song, I would say, after listening to it many times, that it’s simply hard core. Well, to make a deeper comment, it starts on with hard, cool guitars and drums, and it smooths out in the refrain with violin and a slower beat, but I like that too! And the lyrics is kind of dark, but at the same time, it’s about love, so it’s not so dark after all. It’s beautiful.\n\nHope you’re not all too disappointed in me for not immediately posting my review on “What You Want”, but I kind of want to wait until I can get my hands on the music video too! (And plus, you can’t always get what you want! Ha-ha).\n\n“My heart is waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight”\n\n(Burn – We Are The Fallen)"
