        "text": "Mirsaid Rahmonov\n\nThe relationships and meetings of writers can lay the foundation for developing and connecting human love and affection. Memorable moments are often published in memoirs, celebrated on important dates in their literary lives, and serve as lasting testaments to their friendship. Here, we present an article for lovers of science and literature in honor of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s birthday (February 13, 1911) and his literary friendship with the renowned Tajik poet and advocate for peace, Mirzo Tursunzoda.\n\nRemembering important dates and personal stories of writers allows us to appreciate their achievements and dedication to social progress. These masters of language, through their unique styles, eloquently articulate knowledge, wisdom, and critical perspectives. By tirelessly addressing pressing societal issues, they earn a place in our hearts and guide us towards a brighter future.\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz (1911-1984) and Mirzo Tursunzoda (1911-1977) were noteworthy figures in poetry, literature, and politics. Articles and collections discussing their lives and works in Central Asia, particularly Tajikistan and the Indian Subcontinent (including Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh), have been published. These works delve into the creative talents of these writers. Notably, both were born in 1911 and experienced their time’s events and state policies.\n\nAt that time, contemporary India was under British colonial rule, and modern Tajikistan was part of the former Soviet Union. Later, in 1947 and 1991, these regions emerged on the world map as autonomous countries: Pakistan and Tajikistan.\n\nIn 1977, orientalists Habibullah Rajabov and Abdullojan Gafforov selected and translated four poems by Faiz Ahmed Faiz: ‘Screaming Role,’ ‘Dasti Sabo,’ ‘Zindonnoma,’ and ‘Dasti Tahi Sang.’ Tajik poets Maston Sherali, Qutbi Kirom, and Gulrukhsar then adapted them into poems published in a book titled ‘Free Spirit.’ This collection is considered the only collection of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s poems.\n\nEmerging from different environments, Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Mirzo Tursunzoda shared a passion for humanity and artistic expression. Faiz nurtured in a complex social landscape, poured his heart into themes of love, freedom, and social justice. Tursunzoda, raised in a newly formed socialist nation, championed peace, patriotism, and cultural exchange. Both wielded the power of their pens to address human struggles, historical events, and the fight for their people’s well-being.\n\nThrough their creative weapons of wisdom, literature, and culture, the remarkable writers matured into influential figures of their time – writers, thinkers, and even politicians. Their legacy of powerful words, insightful ideas, and impactful actions continues to resonate with their people, etched in hearts and minds to this day.\n\nThe honorable writers understood the world’s suffering with deep empathy and wisdom. They consistently advocated for the protection of their nations, urging their fellow citizens to stand together in defense of their borders, cultural heritage, and shared values with words like:\n\nTu zinda bosh ai watan khonai umedi khalq,\n\nKi be tu nest dilu joni shodmon hanuz.\n\nLong live the homeland – the home of people’s hope.\n\nWithout you, no hearts or souls shall ever find true happiness.\n\nIn his story “Sweet Soul,” Mirzo Tursunzoda, exploring themes of patriotism, compassion, friendship, peace, justice, and opposition to war and violence, mentioned the poet and peace advocate Faiz Ahmed Faiz. He then went on to express:\n\nYod dori az muboriz shoiron,\n\nFaiz bud dar khonai mo mehmon\n\nAz watan gap sar kuni dar megirigt,\n\nDar misoli hezumi tar megirift\n\nDo you remember the struggling poets?\n\nFaiz was once a guest in our house.\n\nIf you spoke of the homeland,\n\nHis emotions would churn, like flames licking wet wood.\n\nHe stressed the importance of raising children with knowledge, good manners, and love for their country. He believes that such upbringing fosters peace, happiness, and societal development. Only in a peaceful nation can people thrive, have influence, and mothers find joy, ultimately leading to societal progress.\n\nFor centuries, the people of the Ferghana Valley dreamt of liberation from the tyranny of foreign rulers, yearning for peace in their homeland, where children’s laughter could echo freely and the downtrodden could find solace. As Mirzo Tursunzoda poignantly reflected in his story:\n\nSulh gui misli gul khandon shawand,\n\nJang gui az ghazab tufon shawand\n\nSay “peace,” and they bloom like flowers.\n\nBut call for war, and they storm with anger.\n\nThe life of a poet and his fight for peace and homeland serve as a powerful example for young people, a model for self-knowledge and resilience. His poems, brimming with love for his nation and strong bonds of friendship, reflect this commitment. According to Faiz himself:\n\nOshiqi rui watan kori man,\n\nIshqu umedi hama afkori man.\n\nMy homeland’s passion burns within my soul,\n\nHope and love’s fire consumes me whole.\n\nPeople across Central and South Asia, particularly in Tajikistan, Pakistan, India, Iran, and Afghanistan, readily connect with the rich works of Mirzo Tursunzoda and Faiz Ahmed Faiz. The shared linguistic heritage enables them to understand the meaning and content deeply.\n\nBoth literary and political figures, Tursunzoda and Faiz dedicated their lives to promoting freedom, peace, and prosperity for their homelands. Their evocative works celebrate the hardworking people, the land with its majestic rivers, valleys, mountains, and fertile fields.\n\nTheir travels and encounters with diverse lives fueled their creative fires, sparking new works and forging deeper bonds among people. This sincere friendship and literary connection between Mirza Tursunzoda and Faiz Ahmed Faiz, ignited upon their first meeting in Lahore, Pakistan, in November 1949, continues to resonate between the citizens of their respective nations to this day.\n\nAfter the death of Mirza Tursunzoda in 1977, Faiz Ahmadi Faiz wrote about the poet in his memoirs: “I remember, once in one of the cities of Pakistan, he spoke to workers and shopkeepers in Farsi-Tajik, and they understood him easily, because he could talk to people with eyes and heart. Ustad Mirzo Tursunzoda was not only a great Tajik poet, but also the most respected and beloved representative of this people. Everywhere he is sincerely respected. The poet loved his homeland and his people. He spoke and wrote in the classical Persian language, that is, Tajik, which was a Ghazal dialect. Although Mirzo Tursunzoda is not with us, he is in our hearts.”\n\nIn memory of his dear friend, Faiz Ahmad Faiz Tursunzoda presents a verse in Bedil’s ghazal as a gift:\n\nBiyo Yoram ki chamshmam muztarib bahri tamoshoyat,\n\nKujo rafti ki yoron dar taloshi omadanhoyat\n\nCome, beloved, for our eyes yearn to behold you.\n\nWhere have you vanished that friends seek your return?\n\nIn October 1981, the Tajik Society of Cultural Relations, research institutes, and the National Academy of Inspirations joined forces to organize a grand celebration in Dushanbe’s Palace of Friendship for Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s 70th birthday. It was a night dedicated to the renowned poet, with Tajik scholars and writers like Mehrubon Nazarov, Habibullah Rajabov, and Maston Sherali presenting insightful reports on his life, work, and translated poems. Warm memories of their literary friendship with Mirzo Tursunzoda were also shared.\n\nAmong the highlights was Urdu scholar Qurbanov Haidar’s article on Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Mirzo Tursunzoda. He observed how both poets captured crucial moments in history, life’s struggles, and the beauty of art and literature, even through their quiet verses. Haidar suggested that this reflected the immense depth and expansiveness of their worldviews.\n\nThe deep friendship and literary connection between Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Mirzo Tursunzoda transcended borders and languages. These literary giants, champions of peace and harmony, viewed the world with wisdom and compassion, their words aiming to ensure freedom, prosperity, and security for their people. Through the power of cultural diplomacy and their insightful works, they left a lasting legacy that continues to inspire and unite diverse communities.\n\n*The author is affiliated with the Institute of Asian and European Studies, National Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan."
