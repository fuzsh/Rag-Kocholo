        "text": "May is South Asian Heritage Month. This poem was originally published in Rebel Youth #26 (Winter 2020-2021). To receive the newest issue of Rebel Youth – Jeunesse Militante, subscribe here!\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz (1911—1984) was a communist, a staunch internationalist, and one of the most celebrated poets of the Urdu language. Born under colonialism in Punjab, he served not only as editor of the Pakistan Times, but as vice-president of the Pakistan Trade Union Federation, and was an active member of the World Peace Council. Faiz was arrested in 1951 during a wave of mass-arrests of communists and spent four years in prison, after which he was exiled to England and the USSR. After briefly returning to Pakistan in 1964, he was again exiled, this time to Lebanon. Following the Lebanon War, he returned to Pakistan in poor health, where he died at the age of 73. He recieved the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962 for his work.\n\nBased on a translation by Mustansir Dalvi\n\nHum mehnat-kash jagwaalon se jab apna hissa maangenge\n\nIk khet nahin ik desh nahin hum saari duniya maangenge\n\nWhen we, who toil by the sweat of our brow, will ask the people of the world for our share,\n\nWe won’t be content with a farm or a country, we’ll ask for the whole world for ourselves.\n\nYaan sagar sagar moti hain yaan parbat parbat heere hain\n\nYeh saaraa maal hamaara hai hum saara khazaana maangenge\n\nWe may find pearls in every sea or dig out diamonds from every peak;\n\nAll of this is ours and we shall ask for all the world and its treasury.\n\nJo khoon bahaa jo baag ujde jo geet dilon mein qatl hue\n\nHar qatre ka har ghunche ka har geet ka badla maangenge\n\nFor blood that was spilt, for gardens laid bare, for every song stillborn in our hearts,\n\nFor every drop, every flowering bud, for every song, we shall seek amends.\n\nSe seth byopaari rajwaade dus laakh to hum das laakh karod\n\nYeh kitne din Amrika se jeene ka sahaara maangenge\n\nBosses, businessmen, preening royalty: they may be one million strong, but we are twenty trillion!\n\nHow long will they rely on America to shoulder the burden of their lives?\n\nJab saf seedhi ho jaayegi jab sab jhagde mit jaayenge\n\nHam har ik desh ke jhande par ik laal sitaara maangenge\n\nWhen every path will straighten, when all strife will end,"
