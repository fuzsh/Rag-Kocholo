        "text": "Al-Fatah came into circulation during an especially volatile period as far as domestic and international politics go. It reported on the conflict between the East and West wings of Pakistan as the December 1970 elections drew closer, and the subsequent 1971 War between the two which led to the formation of Bangladesh. Being a pro-PPP publication, Al-Fatah naturally found itself taking the side of the western wing, albeit in a roundabout manner by suggesting, through its pieces, that the tensions between the two Pakistans were due to a concentrated effort on part of both India and the United States of America.\n\nIn the first half of the 70s, Rao and his colleagues found many opportunities to demonstrate their socialist leanings. Being an inherently pro-China publication, Al-Fatah found itself adopting a pro-China stance on many international matters, such as Indo-China border tensions. Simultaneously, instances like the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 and the Vietnam War allowed it to address the dangers of US imperial powers which continued to destabilize regions worldwide for their personal gain.\n\nWhen Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) came into power in 1971, it was felt that Pakistan would enjoy a degree of freedom that was stripped away by the military regimes of Ayub Khan (1958-1969) and Yahya Khan (1969-1971). While the former is credited with exceptional economic and agricultural reforms, he was also known for limiting press freedom and voices critical to his administration. For instance, he had used the Safety Act to arrest Sibte Hassan, the editor of Lail-o-Nahaar, for his criticism of the government 1Rahman, Ahfaz Ur. Freedom of the Press: The War on Words (1977-1978). Oxford University Press, 2017.\n\nThis was because Bhutto and the PPP had built themselves up in the public eye as champions of democracy, as well as the champions of workers and the poor through their socialist ideologies. To this end, their slogan was “Roti, Kapra, Makaan,” [Food, Clothing, Shelter] which were the basic amenities they promised to the struggling masses of the country. However, Bhutto’s rise to power came with its own unique set of problems. He was noted as having abandoned the politics of the poor with which he had gained popular support 1Rahman, Ahfaz Ur. Freedom of the Press: The War on Words (1977-1978). Oxford University Press, 2017.. Rather than giving more rights to the workers, in line with his party’s socialist stance, he continued to deny them higher wages and further limited the power of labor unions. These policies, which ultimately alienated workers and unions, led to several instances of worker revolts like the one at Landi-Korangi and Kot Lakhpat in 1972 3Ahmed, Ishtiaq. “The Rise and Fall of the Left and the Maoist Movements in Pakistan.” India Quarterly 66, no. 3 (2010): 254–55. http://www.jstor.org/stable/45073152..\n\nFurthermore, Bhutto’s nationalization of major industries gave him considerable power over employment and advertisement. By exploiting this, and ordinances like the Press and Publication Ordinance of 1963, he continued to silence critical voices in publications like Al-Fatah and Musawat, amongst others, by banning the magazines, jailing journalists or meddling with their revenue streams . In doing so, Bhutto started to appear very much like his predecessors – in certain aspects if not wholly. 1Rahman, Ahfaz Ur. Freedom of the Press: The War on Words (1977-1978). Oxford University Press, 2017..\n\nThe political scene darkened further when Zia-ul-Haq came into power after establishing martial law once again. There are few figures in Pakistani history as polarizing as Zia, who was beloved by the Islamic Right and despised by the progressives and leftists. Under his regime, Pakistan underwent a process of Islamic radicalization, which saw secular elements in Pakistani society being overtaken by religious, Islamic ones. Simultaneously, voices of dissent were actively silenced – often through violent means. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and its most critical members – as well as socialist activists who were presented as threats to Islam – were often targeted and jailed. Student unions and activists were also deemed a threat by virtue of their rebellious and disruptive qualities. The National Students Federation, which had played a pivotal role in protesting against Ayub Khan’s regime, also took on a similar role as a response to Zia’s draconian government. Its members were actively mobilized to protest against the government, such as the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (1983), which resulted in its leading members, such as Meraj Muhammad Khan, being arrested and jailed.\n\nNumerous cases of torture and death were reported while these individuals were held captive. This became the spark for the Freedom of the Press Movement of 1977-78, to which Irshad Rao and Wahab Siddiqui were seen as pivotal. Both were eventually arrested for their opposition to Zia’s regime and its draconian practices. Subsequently, Al-Fatah was banned. However, it continued to be circulated to the masses, albeit under different names so as to evade authorities.\n\nThroughout its run, Al-Fatah found itself in a political climate where critical, leftist voices were continuously silenced. However, its team – especially members like Rao and Siddiqui – would find themselves actively opposing these oppressive regimes and, in doing so, making a wider statement on the role and integrity of journalists in Pakistan. Apart from such journalists’ contributions in publications like Al-Fatah and Musawat, they continued to organize protests and pool together to pay fines that were imposed on them for their oppositional stance 5Since accounts were often blocked, journalists would pool together to pay the fines of their colleagues. These journalists would also go on hunger strikes which doubled as both a means to gather more support and to pressure Zia’s regime. The Karachi Press Club became one of the many sites nationwide where such protests actively took place, much to the authoritarian regime’s chagrin.\n\nAl-Fatah’s role in this political climate was not a passive one by any means. It gave many critical individuals a platform to speak up against widespread injustices, whether they be the military dictatorship which Pakistanis were experiencing the horrors of domestically or whether they be the injustices faced internationally by groups such as the Palestinians or the Vietnamese. However, more so than existing as a mere weekly publication, Al-Fatah allowed for the organization and mobilization of a team of progressive journalists, often associated with organizations like the PFUJ, who zealously attempted to protect the sanctity of journalism in a regime which was actively engaged in the process of destroying it.\n\nIrshad Rao – Chief Editor\n\nIrshad Rao was a prominent figure in the anti-dictatorship movement during Zia-ul-Haq’s military rule, and his contributions as a journalist were instrumental in mobilising the masses. As the founder and chief editor of Al-Fatah, Rao wielded his pen to challenge state oppression, campaigning for press freedoms and the rights of working journalists. In navigating the thorny landscape of censorship and repression, he became a beacon of hope for those involved in the struggle for democracy.\n\nRao used his platform to challenge military dictatorship, and bring attention to how it stifled the voices of Pakistani journalists. His work extended beyond print media since he was also a committed socialist, who took a pro-labor stance in his magazine. In one instance, he served as an arbitrator to resolve a dispute between labour and management at the Daily Tameer, in which he took the side of the workers 1“Subsequently, there were three courses of action available to the labor unions; firstly to go on strike, secondly to take the matter to the labor court, and thirdly to involve an arbitrator. The inexperienced labor unions never realizing the usefulness of the arbitration process used to tap the first two options more often. The arbitrator was supposed to hear the standpoint of both the parties i.e., management and the labor union, and then render a verdict just like an expedient labor court. However, arbitration is a modern progressive way of resolving issues, and this mechanism is rarely deployed in Pakistan even now.” Hashmi, Waqar Haider, and Riffat Bawa. “Labor Unionization in Pakistan – History & Trends.” Pakistaniaat: A Journal of Pakistan Studies 2.2 (2010): 78-82..\n\nAl-Fatah was driven by Rao’s revolutionary and socialist-democratic vision, which was closely aligned with the ideas of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan People’s Party. As a Marxist, Rao’s writing reflected the ideologies of Lenin and Mao, and his periodical was defined by its leftist perspectives on local, national, and regional socio-economic concerns. In promoting the PPP’s motto and platform before Bhutto came to power, and after his execution, Al-Fatah created a space for dissent, and added to the variety of perspectives on political issues. Moreover, Rao inspired a new generation of middle-class youth who were passionate about trade union activism, populist politics, and ideological stances. In the late 1960s and 1970s, these ideas played a central role in Pakistan’s struggle for social justice and democracy 2Raza, Mansoor. “A Red Revolution in Karachi for 50 Paisas a Week.” Samaa, 29 Apr. 2020, www.samaaenglish.tv/news/amp/2018742..\n\nDuring Zia-ul-Haq’s military regime, Al-Fatah saw some of the worst forms of suppression in the domain of media and journalism. It is during this time that Al-Fatah played a crucial role. Zia’s Revised Press and Publication Ordinance (RPPO) of 1980 led to torture, detention, and lashings for journalists, as well as the closure of numerous media outlets 3Hussain, Nazir. “Reassessing the Role of the Media in Pakistan.” Afficher La Page d’accueil Du Site, Feb. 2011, www.ifri.org/en/publications/editoriaux-de-lifri/lettre-centre-asie/reassessing-role-media-pakistan.. The state flouted democratic checks on its power, brutally suppressing the media, imposing strict censorship controls, and imprisoning journalists who tried to assert their independence. Irshad Rao and other senior journalists in the country made significant professional sacrifices during the Zia years, and their experiences made them fiercely protective of their freedom of expression.\n\nUnder martial law, regulation 33 mandated a period of seven years of jail and 20 lashes if found indulging in “any political activity by words, signs or visible representation” Regulations were introduced that prohibited “dissent, criticism by word, action or gesture, and stifling all forms of expression” 4Farhad. “Curbing Free Thought.” Index on Censorship, vol. 14, no. 2, 1985, pp. 33–36.. This led to the targeting of individuals who possessed the means to mobilise opposition, such as by using their platform to articulate the discontent of the masses. Maliha Safiullah, the daughter of Irshad Rao, revealed that Al-Fatah was banned on nine occasions during General Zia’s rule. Yet, it managed to continue circulating under many different names, until Irshad Rao was apprehended and subjected to torture in a military cell 5“Veteran Journalist Irshad Rao Passes Away .” Pakistan Press Foundation, 16 Nov. 2022, www.pakistanpressfoundation.org/veteran-journalist-irshad-rao-passes-away/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=veteran-journalist-irshad-rao-passes-away..\n\nIrshad Rao was imprisoned and subjected to mistreatment for almost two years due to allegations of “printing objectionable literature, creating unrest among the masses and disaffection with the armed forces.” During this time, he was declared a Prisoner of Conscience by Amnesty International, and The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) also initiated a global campaign to secure his release. As a result of this outcry, some US Congress senators reportedly wanted to question Zia about Rao’s imprisonment, during one of his official visits to the US 6McGrory, Mary. “Zia Need Not Worry, He’s the Kind of General Reagan Likes.” The Washington Post, 7 Dec. 1982, www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/12/07/zia-need-not-worry-hes-the-kind-of-general-reagan-likes/b7a2a8f3-98d7-42dd-a615-2f2de63db09a/..\n\nIn 1981, Irshad Rao took upon himself to take Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s widow, Begum Nusrat Bhutto, to a meeting of opposition leaders where the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD) was formed. Subsequently, he worked as the managing editor of the Daily Frontier Post. When Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s daughter Benazir became Prime Minister in 1993, she appointed him as her official spokesperson and then as an advisor on information in her first cabinet. Later, in 2007, he joined the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) as the Director of Publications. Rao passed away in November 2022 5“Veteran Journalist Irshad Rao Passes Away .” Pakistan Press Foundation, 16 Nov. 2022, www.pakistanpressfoundation.org/veteran-journalist-irshad-rao-passes-away/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=veteran-journalist-irshad-rao-passes-away..\n\nAt the end of this section is an excerpt containing two editorials written by Irshad Rao: “Awaam ki Jang” [The People’s War] from the 2 September 1971 issue, and “Jidd o Jehad Aakhri Fatah Tak” [Fight Till the Final Victory] from the 6 January 1973 issue. The excerpt contains the original Urdu text (Source: SARRC, Islamabad) alongside their English translations (translation by authors).\n\nFacing Censorship\n\nNonviolent Methods\n\nThe magazine faced censorship on many levels. First, there were instances of using bureaucratic red tape as a way of controlling the content published. This was a practice more common before Zia’s time, when PPP was in power. In 1971, all official advertisements for the magazine were stopped. In another instance, the newsprint quota was cancelled under the pretense that all the required documentations had not been submitted to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. Failure to do so meant no certification, resulting in no newsprint quota. Except the team had already submitted all the documentations and proof a year ago. Although the method of enforcing censorship did change with the shift in leadership, even Zia resorted to a variation of using government bodies to practice pre-publication censorship. In February 1980, after Al-Fatah was restored, a government official was assigned to go through the magazine before giving it the go-ahead for publication.\n\nBrutality, Raids and Censorship\n\nA more common manifestation for censorship under Zia was one full of brutality, imprisonments, and incidents of violent raids. Intimidation was the main weapon, that could be wielded in an almost endless range of manifestations. The first representation of this was the firing of Minhaj Barna, the bureau chief of Pakistan Times as well as the president of PFUJ. The reason for his dismissal was his regular contributions for Al-Fatah. By 1978, the attack shifted onto the magazine itself. In April 1978, Wahab Siddique published an article regarding the worker massacre in Colony Textile Mills, Multan, the magazine was banned. Siddique was also imprisoned in Lahore.\n\nHere is where the resilience of the editorial team comes into focus. Despite the ban, the editor, Irshad Rao published Al-Fatah under 12 different the names and covers. These included Rahi, Zulfiqar, Parbhaat, Awaz and Inqilaab amongst others. These were all run by leftist revolutionaries and critics of Zia, such as the famed Urdu poet Fahmida Riaz, the founder of Awaz. Each time he came up with a new one, the State banned the last one. Within 15 months they were all shut down.\n\nThe State recognized the resilience behind the magazine and started using methods of coercion addressed not just towards the magazine as an independent body, but towards the individuals behind it. On 1st January 1981, an army major led a police raid on Al-Fatah’s office and Irshad Rao’s home. He was arrested and imprisoned for two and a half years 3Rahman, Ahfaz Ur. Freedom of the Press: The War on Words (1977-1978). Oxford University Press, 2017..\n\nOrganising Against Censorship\n\nDespite facing the brunt of censorship, itself, Al-Fatah remained an integral piece in the Freedom of Press Movement. At a time, when the core exerts unquestionable authority over the intellectual production and physical conditions of Pakistan, Al-Fatah became a tool for the oppressed to organize themselves into an alternate core- resisting against the oppressor. Its primary purpose was to report on the sensitive information that was being erased. It covered the movement- articulated the demands, as well as published lists of arrested volunteers. In his work Freedom of The Press: The War on Words, Ahfaz Ur Rehman compiled a list from the material he could recover from the existing copies of Al-Fatah.\n\nIn addition to that, it distributed information to workers all over Pakistan, news agencies and newspapers to ensure a dissemination of reality before it could be erased. In fact, the trigger for the movement was the ban of the magazine Musawat. The central action committees of the PFUJ (Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists) and APNEC (All Pakistan Newspapers Employees Confederation) met to start a movement against censorship. From that point, Al-Fatah has played the role of sharer of information 3Rahman, Ahfaz Ur. Freedom of the Press: The War on Words (1977-1978). Oxford University Press, 2017.. In retrospect, the timely publishing of such significant events puts Al-Fatah not just in a position of engaging with the forces present, but also undertaking archival work of sorts.\n\nAt the end of the day, it came down to protecting the voice of resistance. That’s exactly what Al-Fatah did. Even when the activists had to succumb to state pressures, or were physically detained, their voices were carried on in the magazine. Letters from prominent leaders were published while they were incarcerated. This allowed the magazine to, in a way, perform the task of ensuring the momentum of the movement as well. It seemed to be saying: So, what if our leaders and our journalists get arrested? So, what if they beat us publicly? Threaten our families?\n\nNothing can contain the power of words, not even a prison cell.\n\nApart from poems that shed light on Pakistan’s working class, Al-Fatah also published literary pieces that showed support for socialist or anti-imperialist revolutions in other countries, and recognised key figures in these movements. For example, the magazine published two poems on Vietnam in early 1973, following the Paris Peace Accords, written by Saqi Javed and Rashid Mufti. In addition, Mahmood Shaam published a poem supporting the Palestine freedom struggle in 1970, a month after conflict broke out between the Jordanian army and Palestinian guerrilla fighters. Raees Amrohi contributed a poem on Sukarno, the Indonesian president, shortly after his death, and the Vietnamese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh was written about in two poems – one by Abdul Aziz Khalid, and the other by the eminent poet Habib Jalib (translated into English by Raza Naeem here).\n\nMoreover, the magazine also found its literary influences in writers from other locales. It published a translated poem by Pablo Neruda titled “Khooni Chowk” [Bloody Square] – one of his many poems about the Chinese people. In addition, it published an article on the life and works of Jean-Paul Sartre, reviewing his contributions to existential philosophy, as well as his preface of Frantz Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth.\n\nA prominent trope that emerges across the poetry selection in Al-Fatah, which might also be an original feature of socialist literature produced in South Asia, is the metaphor of Karbala for the struggle against oppression. In the year 680, the grandson of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, Imam Hussain, was killed along with his family and supporters by the Umayyad caliph Yazid, at the site of Karbala in Iraq. The event has become a cornerstone in Islamic history, and Hussain emerges as a beacon of sacrifice, an exceptional figure who upheld righteousness in the face of evil. Many of Al-Fatah’s contributors have adopted the narrative of Karbala in their writings, using it as a metaphor for the raging injustice and oppression they saw in the country at the time.\n\nPerhaps one of the magazine’s most illustrious literary features is a poem by Faiz Ahmed Faiz, published posthumously in the 7 July 1990 issue, titled “Khwab Basera” [Dream Abode]. Here is a link to its English translation, by Mustansir Dalvi.\n\nThe ghazal is a poem, usually untitled, made up of at least five rhyming couplets, with each couplet following a different theme. It is also the most common literary form featured in Al-Fatah by far, followed by the nazm and afsanay. In spite of the Progressives’ apparent distaste for the form, the ghazal was still favoured by many of the movement’s writers, and especially popularised by Faiz. As the modernist Urdu writer N. M. Rashid said, Faiz’s poetry “enables the timeworn cliches of the Persian and Urdu ghazal to acquire a renewed sensitivity and to be recharged with meaning, so that the solitary suffering of the disappointed romantic lover is transformed into the suffering of humanity at large” 1Mir, Ali Husain and Raza Mir, Anthems of Resistance: A Celebration of Progressive Urdu Poetry. Roli Books Private Limited, 2006..\n\nBelow is a video of Faiz reading his poem at his last televised mushaira (a gathering for reciting poetry).\n\nIn this poem, Faiz’s disillusioned tone embodies the broader sense of despair that was settling into the country forty years after the Partition of the subcontinent. From the death of the country’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah a year after Partition, till the tumultuous rule of Zia-ul-Haq, the country’s political climate had perhaps never truly settled. It was increasingly dawning upon people that the Pakistani state may have failed to live up to the promises made to them at the time of the Partition – and Faiz was only too aware of this, having been imprisoned in 1951 for a government conspiracy, and eventually retiring to Beirut in self-exile after Bhutto’s execution. He returned only two years before his death, which is when he is reported to have penned “Khwab Basera”.\n\nAl-Fatah, too, is thought to have stopped publishing in 1990, leaving behind a memorable legacy of political resistance and leftist thought and practice. While on its own, it carved a space for itself for nuanced socio-political discourses under rather precarious and oppressive political climates, the periodical and its associated members were also part of a much larger social and political movement that unequivocally strived to ensure press freedom and, more broadly, the Pakistani people’s agency to be critical of those who govern them, be they democratically elected or authoritarian regimes.\n\nAl-Fatah was not a stand-alone force against much larger stifling regimes and governments. Other publications and organizations, such as its contemporary, Musawat, and the PFUJ sought to intricately weave their leftist rationales and journalistic prowess to become a force of mobilization against censorship and draconian policies which military rule imposed upon the nation state. More than just a leftist publication, Al-Fatah served to counter anti-democratic practices, and worked towards redirecting the political landscape that guaranteed freedom of thought and expression. In doing so, not only did Al-Fatah’s contributors simply pen down their voices against governments that deliberately sought to silence critical thought, but they actively resisted, without fear, the perpetrators by collaborating with like-minded contemporaries who formed a large, progressive network. In doing so, these individuals constructed a legacy of resistance which Pakistan needed to preserve democracy and accountability in an increasingly unstable socio-political climate."
