        "text": "THIS is not the first time that champions of liberty in India have sung the verses of Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Although born in Sialkot (now in Pakistan), as was Iqbal, Faiz acquired a huge following all over the subcontinent well before the tragic partition of India. Nearly half a century ago, during the Emergency, political prisoners in India’s jails found inspiration in his poem. It is all too appropriate that the protesters opposed to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) should chant Faiz.\n\nOne of the most insightful comments on Faiz has come from a public intellectual of world class whom India has produced, Professor Amartya Sen. In an interview to the Kolkata daily The Telegraph on Republic Day this year, he referred to the wave of protests that have swept across the country in these terms: “And that is the context in which Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s beautiful song, Hum Dekhenge , became such a positive thought. What is the point of that idea? Faiz is saying a different day will come. Don’t assume that any nasty thing that you can do now—and you can do it with impunity—would never be brought into reclaiming. The fearlessness of the authoritarian rulers makes them ruthless, and that has to be challenged. It is in this context, among others, that Faiz’s simple poem Hum Dekhenge becomes very important. It’s the cry of the underpowered, who is getting strength from an attitudinal change. Faiz, with his usual range, even brought into the poem a touch of religion, nothing exclusively Islam (as it has sometimes been wrongly interpreted). The idea of the good triumphing over evil and the evil acts being brought up for reckoning is not only a Muslim thought. It is also a Hindu thought, also a Parsi thought, also a Christian or Sikh thought. And it can also be the thought of an atheist.… It is a universal thought. Hum Dekhenge is a reminder to all potentially ruthless rulers.”\n\nFaiz and Iqbal were the greatest poets in Urdu that India produced in the 20th century. Iqbal was a poet-philosopher. Faiz was a poet-ideologue, the pride of the Left. It is not well known that Iqbal drank deep at the fount of Hindu philosophy and wrote a moving poem on Swami Ram Tirth, on his death.\n\nAfter Partition, to which Faiz was strongly opposed, he had, perhaps more soulmates in India than in Pakistan, where the Left was gasping for breath. Faiz read widely and well. He knew the great English poets as he did the great Urdu poets. There is a good collection of his English writings ( Culture and Identity: Selected English Writings of Faiz compiled and edited by Sheena Majeed, Oxford University Press, Karachi, Rs.395). In a talk on “Problems of Cultural Planning in Asia”, he said: “Alien imperialist domination of Asian countries was not merely a passive process of pure political supremacy. It was also an active process of social and cultural subversion. It tried on the one hand to kill or destroy whatever was good, progressive, and forward-looking in the old feudal or pre-feudal structures by way of arts, skills, customs, manners, humanist values or mental enlightenment. It tried to sustain and perpetuate, on the other, whatever was unwholesome, reactionary, or backward-looking, ignorance, superstition, servility, and class exploitation. What was handed back to the newly liberated countries, therefore, was not the original social structure taken over at the point of their subjugation but the perverted and emasculated remnants of the structure. Superimposed on these remnants were cheap, spurious and second-hand imitations of Western cultural patterns by way of language, customs, manners, art forms, and ideological values.”\n\nFaiz married an Englishwoman, Alys, who was a member of the British Communist Party. The great Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah performed the marriage (nikah) ceremonies at Srinagar. Faiz’s first poem is perhaps the best. In it the loner warns his beloved not to ask him to love her as before, though he loved her still. Revolution now claimed his love, first. Noorjehan sang the song so beautifully that Faiz declared that the poem was no longer his. It belonged to her. The great composer Arshad Mahmood has not received his just dues for putting the poem to music. The poem and its English translation are reproduced in an excellent compilation by Faiz’s friend Victor Kiernan ( Poems by Faiz , George Allen & Unwin). It is dedicated to Alys. The poem is reproduced in Urdu, written in the Roman script, with a translation in English. I reproduce both. It is an immortal contribution.\n\nMUJH-SE PAHLI-SI MAHABBAT, MERI MAHBUB NA MANG\n\nMujh-se pahli-si mahabbat, meri mahbub, na mang.\n\nMain-ne samajha tha ke tu hai, to darakhshan hai\n\nhayat,\n\nTeri gham hai to gham-e-dahr ki jhagra kya hai?\n\nTeri surat se hai alammeri baharon ko sabat,\n\nTeri ankhon ke siwa duniya men rakkha kya hai?\n\nTu jo mil-jae to taqdir nigun ho-jae.\n\nYun na tha, main-ne faqat chaha tha yun ho-jie.\n\nAur bhi dukh hain zamane men mahabbat ke siwa.\n\nRahateri aur bhi hain vasi ki rihat ke siwa.\n\nAn-gimat sadyon ke tarik bahemana tilism\n\nResham o atlas kamkhab meri bunwae hue\n\nJa-ba-ja bikte hue kucha o bazar men jism\n\nKhak me lithare hue, khun men nahlae hue,\n\nJism nikale hue amraz ke tannurron se,\n\nPip bahti hui galte hue nasuren se—\n\nLaut-jati hai udhar ko bhi nazar, kya kije?\n\nAb bhi dilkash hai tera husn, magar kya kije?\n\nAur bhi dukh hain zamane men mahabbat ke siwa.\n\nRahaten aur bhi hain vasl ki rahat ke siwa,\n\nMujh-se pahli-si mahabbat,meri mahbub, na mang.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nDO NOT ASK FROM ME, MY BELOVED LOVE\n\nLIKE THAT FORMER ONE.\n\nDo not ask from me, my beloved love like that former\n\none.\n\nI had believed that you are, therefore life in shining,\n\nThere is anguish over you, so what wrangle is there\n\nover the sorrow of the age?\n\nFrom your aspect springtimes on earth have\n\npermanence;\n\nWhat does the world hold except your eyes?\n\nIf you were to become mine, fate would be humbled.\n\n—It was not so, I had only wished that it should be so.\n\nThere are other sufferings of the time (world) besides\n\nlove.\n\nThere are other pleasures besides the pleasure of\n\nunion.\n\nThe dark beastly spell of countless centuries.\n\nWomen in silk and satin brocade,—\n\nBodies sold everywhere in alley and market.\n\nSmeared with dust, washed in blood,\n\nBodies that have emerged from the ovens of diseases,\n\nPus flowing from rotten ulcers—\n\nMy glance comes back that way too: what is to be\n\ndone?\n\nYour beauty is still charming, but what is to be done?\n\nThere are other sufferings of the time (world) besides\n\nlove,\n\nThere are other pleasures besides the pleasures of\n\nunion;\n\nDo not ask from me, my beloved, love like that former\n\none.\n\n......................................................\n\nThis was a poet who spoke to his rival in love without bitterness.\n\nRAQIB SE\n\nAa ke vabasta hain us husn ki yaden tujh-se\n\nJis-ne is dil ko pari-khana bana-rakha tha,\n\nJiski ulfat men bhula-rakkhi thi dunya ham-ne,\n\nDahr ko dahr ka afsana bana-rakha tha.\n\nAshna hain tere qadmon se vo rahen jin-par\n\nUski madhosh jawani-ne inayat ki hai,\n\nKarawan guzare hain jin-se usi ran a I ke\n\nJiski in ankhon-ne jbe-sud ibadat ki hai.\n\nTujh-se kheli hain vo mahbub hawaen jin-meri\n\nUske malbus ki afsurda mahak baqi hai;\n\nTujh-pe bhi barsa hai us bam se mahtab ka nur.\n\nJis-men biti haui raton ki kasak baqi hai;\n\nTu-ne dekhi hai vo peshani, vo rukhsar, vo hont\n\nZindagi jinke tasawwur men luta-di ham-ne,\n\nTujh-pe utthi hain vo khoi hui sahir ankhen,\n\nTujhko malum hai kyun umar ganwa-di ham-ne.\n\nHam-pe mushtaraka hain kihsan gham-e-ulfat ke,\n\nItne ihsan ke ginwaun to ginwa na sakun;\n\nHam-ne is ishq men kya khoya hai, kya sikha hai,\n\nJuz tere aur ko samjhaun to samjha na sakun.\n\n‘ajizi sikhi, gharibon ki himayat sikhi,\n\nYas o hirman ke, dukh dard ke mani sikhe,\n\nZerdaston ke masaib ko samajhna sikha,\n\nSard ahon ke, rukh-e-zard ke mani sikhe.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nTO THE RIVAL\n\nCome, for memories are linked with you of that\n\nbeauty\n\nWho turned this heart into a fairy-house,\n\nIn attachment to whom I had forgotten the world,\n\nI had turned the age into a fable of an age.\n\nFamiliar with your steps are those paths on which\n\nHer intoxicated youth bestowed itself,\n\nBy which the caravans of her charms have passed\n\nThat these eyes profitlessly adored.\n\nWith you have played those beloved breezes in which\n\nThe faded scent of her dress remains;\n\nOn you too has rained from that roof the light of the\n\nmoon\n\nIn which the pain of bygone nights remains.\n\nYou have seen that forehead, that cheek, that lip,\n\nIn contemplation of which I squandered existence;\n\nOn you have been raised those lost-in-thought ma\n\ngical eyes;\n\nTo you is known why I wasted life.\n\nOurs in partnership are the favours of the pain of\n\ndevotion,\n\nSo many favours that if I were to count I would not be\n\nable to count;\n\nWhat I lost in this love, what I learned,\n\nIf I were to explain to anyone except you I would not\n\nbe able to explain.\n\nI learned helplessness, I learned protection of the\n\npoor;\n\nI learned the meaning of despair and frustration, of\n\nsuffering and pain,\n\nI learned to understand the afflictions of the\n\ndowntrodden,\n\nI learned the meaning of chill sighs, of livid faces....\n\n(Sun g again, most admirably, by Noorjehan.) It is typical of Faiz to blend romance with realism, love and political and social injustices.\n\n.......................................................\n\nIn August 1947, he wrote:\n\nSUBH E-AZADI (August 1947)\n\nYe dagh dagh ujala, ye shab-gazida sahar,\n\nVo intizar tha jis-ka, ye vo sahar to nahin,\n\nYe vo sahar to nahin jis-ki arzu lekar\n\nChale the yar ke mil-jegi kahin na kahin.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nDAWN OF FREEDOM (August 1947)\n\nThis stain-covered daybreak, this night-bitten dawn,\n\nThis is not that dawn of which there was expectation;\n\nThis is not that dawn with longing for which\n\nThe friends set out, (convinced) that somewhere\n\nthere would be met with.\n\n......................................................\n\nFaiz was put in priso n twice after conviction in the Rawalpindi Conspiracy case and, later, but not before he saw dictatorship creep across Pakistan.\n\nNISAR MAIN TERI GALYON KE\n\nNisar main teri galyon ke, ai watan, ke jahan\n\nChali hai rasm ke koi na sar uthake chale,\n\nJo koi chahne-wala tawaf ko nikle\n\nNazar churake chale, jism-o-jan bachake chale;\n\nHai ahl-i-dil ke liye ab ye nazm-e-bast-o-khusad,\n\nKe sang o khisht muqaiyad hain aur sag azad.”\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nMAY I BE A SACRIFICE TO YOUR STREETS\n\nMay I be a sacrifice to your streets, oh fatherland,\n\nwhere\n\nIt has become custom that no-one shall go with head\n\nlifted,\n\nAnd that any lover who comes out on pilgrimage\n\nMust go with furtive looks, go in fear of body and life;\n\nApplied to the people of heart now there is this\n\nmethod of administration,\n\nThat stones and bricks are locked up, and dogs free.\n\n......................................................\n\nHum Dek henge had its precursor in his poem on Dogs:\n\nKUTTE\n\nYe galyon ke awara be-kar kutte,\n\nKe bakhsha-gayi jinko zauq-e-gadai,\n\nZamane ki phitkar sarmaya unka,\n\nJahan bhar ki dhatkar unki kamai,\n\nNa aram shab ko no rahat sawere,\n\nGhilazat men ghar, nalyon men basere;\n\nJo bigren to ek dusre se lara-do,\n\nZara ek roti ka tukra dikha-do—\n\nYe harek ki thokaren khanewale,\n\nYa faqon se uktake mar-janewale.\n\nYe mazlum makhliq gar sar uthae,\n\nTo insane sab sarkashi bhul-jae;\n\nYe chahen to dunya ko apna bana-len,\n\nYe aqaon ki haddiyan tak chaba-len—\n\nKoi inki soi hui dum hila-de.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nDOGS\n\nThese wandering stray dogs of the streets,\n\nOn whom has been bestowed ardour for beggary,\n\nThe curses of the age their property,\n\nThe abuse of the whole world their earnings,—\n\nNeither rest at night nor comfort in the morning,\n\nDwellings in the dirt, night-lodgings in the drains;—\n\nIf they rebel, make one fight another,\n\nJust show them a piece of bread—\n\nThey who suffer the kicks of everyone,\n\nWho will die worn out with starvation.\n\n—If these oppressed creatures lifted their heads,\n\nMankind would forget all its insolence;\n\nIf they wished they would make the earth their own,\n\nThey would chew even the bones of the masters—\n\nIf only someone showed them consciousness of\n\ndegradation,\n\nIf only someone shook their sleeping tails!\n\n......................................................\n\nIn this spirit Faiz advis es writers:\n\nMata-e-lauh-o-qalam chin-gai to kya gham hai,\n\nKe khun-e-dil men dabo-li hain ungliyan main-ne.\n\nZaban pe muhr lagi hai to kya, ke rakh-di hai\n\nHarek halq-e-zanjir men zaban main-ne.\n\nIf m y tablet and pen are taken away, what grief is it,\n\nWhen I have nipped my fingers in the blood of the\n\nheart?\n\nA seal has been set on my tongue: what of it, when I\n\nhave put\n\nA tongue into every link of my chain?\n\n......................................................\n\nZulfika r Ali Bhutto took Faiz along to Bangladesh, his first visit. He had enlisted Faiz as his adviser on cultural affairs. What Faiz wrote on his return is a fine blend of romance and realism, a unique verse on estranged lovers who do meet again but part because neither could speak frankly to the other. The poem was sung by Nayyara Noor, whom Faiz had come to like a lot. It reads:\n\nDHAKA SE WAPSI PAR\n\nHum ke thahre ajnabi itni mulaqaton ke baad/ phir\n\nbanenge asana kitni mulaqaton ke baad/ Kub nazar\n\naaega bey daagh subze ki bahar/ khoon key dhabbey\n\ndhalenge kitni barsaton key baad.\n\nThey bohat bey dard lumhey khattun dard ishq key/\n\nthen bohat bey make subhen mehrbaan raston key\n\nbaad.\n\nDil to chaha pur shikastay dil ney mohlat hi na\n\ndi/ Kuch giley shikvey bhi kar letey manajaton key\n\nbaad.\n\nUn sey jo hame gaye they Faiz jam sadqa kiya/ Un\n\nkahi hi rehgai who baat sub baton key baat.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nOn Return from Dhaka\n\nWe remain strangers, though times out of\n\nmind we met,\n\nHow many reunions will it take to be\n\nfriends again?\n\nWhen will the eye behold the sight of\n\ngrass without blemish?\n\nHow many rains will it take for\n\nthe blood spots to wash away?\n\nThe moment of separation was\n\ncruel, of pain without respite,\n\nAnd unforgiving was the morn\n\ning after the night of union,\n\nThough the heart wanted, there\n\nwas to be no time\n\nTo speak of how we felt after beg\n\nging forgiveness.\n\nWhat we wanted to say, Faiz, our\n\nheart in our hand\n\nRemained unsaid when all else\n\nhad been said.\n\n......................................................\n\nTo end with Hum Dekhenge, there is an able translation in O City of Lights: Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Poems Selected and Edited by Khalid Hasan, translation by Daud Kamal and Khalid Hasan (Oxford University Press, Karachi). Khalid Hasan was a friend and devotee of Faiz. Iqbal Bano gave her voice to it and made the song unforgettable.\n\nHUM DEKHENGE\n\nLaazim hai ki hum bhi dekhenge\n\nWoh din jiskaa ke waada hai,\n\nJo lau-e-azi mein likha hai\n\nJab zulm-o-sitam ke koh-e-garaan\n\nRooi ki tarah udd jaayenge,\n\nHum mehkoomon ke paaon tale\n\nJab dharti dhad dhad dhadkegi,\n\nAura hl-e-hukam ke sar oopar\n\nJab bijli kad kad kadkege,\n\nJab arz-e-khudaa ke kaab se\n\nSab but uthwaaey jaayenge,\n\nHum ahl-e-safaa mardood-e-haram\n\nMasnad pe bithaaey jaayenge.\n\nSab ttaj uchaaley jaayenge.\n\nSab takht giraaey jayeenge.\n\nBas naam rahega Allah kaa,\n\nJo ghaayab bhi hai, haazir bhi,\n\nJo manzar bhi hai, naazir bhi.\n\nUtthegaa ‘An-al-haq’ kaa naara\n\nJo main bhi hoon, aur tum bhi ho,\n\nAur raaj karegi khalq-e-Khuda\n\nJo mai bhi hon, aur tum hi ho.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nWe Shall Overcome\n\nWe shall live to see,\n\nSo it is writ,\n\nWe shall live to see,\n\nThe day that’s been promised,\n\nThe day that’s been ordained;\n\nThe day when the mountains of oppression,\n\nWill blow away like wisps of cotton;\n\nWhen the earth will dance\n\nBeneath the feet of the once enslaved;\n\nAnd heavens’ll shake with thunder\n\nOver the heads of tyrants;\n\nAnd the idols in the House of God\n\nWill be thrown out;\n\nWe, the rejects of the earth,\n\nWill be raised to a place of honour.\n\nAll crowns’ll be tossed in the air,\n\nAll thrones’ll be smashed,\n\nAnd God’s word will prevail,\n\nHe who is both present and absent\n\nHe who’s beheld and is the beholder.\n\nAnd truth shall ring in every ear,\n\nTruth which is you and I,\n\nWe, the people will rule the earth\n\nWhich means you, which means I.\n\nIt was writte n in the United States in January 1979.\n\nThe Shaheen Baghs that grew all over India reclaimed Faiz as truly one of us, a fighter against oppression, bigotry, poverty, destitution and imperialism."
