        "text": "Ralph Russell looks at different aspects of Faiz’s life and concludes that Faiz replicated his attitude in poetry, life, and politics. Faiz desired luxurious life and the same can be reflected in his poetry and social interaction. Russell shares that Faiz desired praise, comfortable life while concealing facts should not be the attitude of a progressive person. Russell was told that in practical life Faiz had nothing to do with the depressed people and he never stepped in a muddy house. He only liked the floors “covered with the most expensive carpets.” Many literary people sarcastically said on Faiz’s return to Pakistan after self-exile that Faiz would create poetry against the martial law and its injustice when Gen. Ziaul Haq had died (Hameed, 2013: 51-53 and 61). Gopi Chand Narang is also of the same opinion that Faiz was not a rebel poet (Ibid., 65). Faiz could not bear the physical torture, hardships and imprisonment because of the decaying age factor (Ibid.). Dr. Ayub Mirza, a staunch admirer of Faiz, produced a devotional accounts regarding Faiz yet Faiz’s personality and poetry needs deeper and objective study. Faiz Ahmed Faiz was a poet, journalist, teacher, voice of the depressed, advocate of peace and tranquility, labour rights activist and sympathizer of the left-wing ideology in politics. After the emergence of Pakistan, owing to his tilt towards communism and Russia, a few governments persecuted him but this affiliation enabled him to win the Lenin Peace Prize. He for some time rendered his services to the Pakistani governments which assigned him the duty to promote literature and culture while sometimes the governments considered him their rival and sent him to jail. Faiz as a dynamic and vibrant personality has influenced everyone who understands Urdu language and has sympathy for the marginalized groups. People, working for humanity and labour class throughout the world, remember Faiz in good words. This enadeavour focuses on Faiz’s struggle for rights, and sufferings as depicted in his poetry and other accounts. Left-wing politics and the Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case raised several questions. Being far away from the electoral politics, Faiz focused merely on the intellectual contribution to the rights of the deprived groups. Sometimes he practically participated in the trade unions and raised his voice for the oppressed people living in any corner of the world. Brutality and inhuman action by any government anywhere was taken up by Faiz which highlights his vision and his polite and peaceful nature. Faiz’s personality and work reflect his clear-cut vision about a society especially of Pakistan in which rule of law and justice should be ensured. This study concludes that not a theocrat but as a balanced Muslim, Faiz loved Islam, democracy, Pakistan and the system which could provide justice and prosperity to the depressed classes."
