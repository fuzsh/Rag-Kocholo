        "text": "Listening to ghazals\n\nListening to the finest ghazals is like entering a garden, where each flower has a different fragrance and colour, but all share the same essence. They are the ones that have been sung by masters of the art - Mehdi Hasan, Pankaj Udhas, Jagjit Singh, Farida Khanum.\n\n28 Feb, 2024, 11:04 PM IST\n\nListening to ghazals\n\nGhazals are a form of poetry that can evoke deep emotions and transport listeners to a different realm. Sung by masters of the art such as Mehdi Hasan and Jagjit Singh, these songs have the power to soothe, inspire, and console. Whether contemporary or old, ghazals have the ability to make one smile or sigh, and their lyrics are crafted by renowned poets like Mirza Ghalib and Faiz Ahmad Faiz.\n\n28 Feb, 2024, 12:32 PM IST\n\nGaanaGPT, the next new old hit song\n\nConnoisseurs would, of course, scoff at the very idea. But how many times have we heard a singer sound like a favourite without being the one, and we derive pleasure from it? Kumar Sanu and others come to mind. A Mohammed Rafi-style new AI-generated song may do that impossible - bring something new to our ears while feeding our nostalgia buds at the same time.\n\n02 May, 2023, 11:31 PM IST\n\n'MAN-SIZED/I'M HEADING ON/HANDSOME/GOT MY LEATHER BOOTS ON'\n\nWhat PJ Harvey sang about with acute irony, the likes of Bruce Chatwin, and present company, extoll their rugged beauty with pride and joy: a sturdy pair of boots.\n\n07 Jan, 2023, 11:46 PM IST\n\nPakistan's melody queen Nayyara Noor, adored by millions from both sides of the border, passes away at 71\n\nShe leaves behind an enviable legacy and a treasure trove of mellifluous renditions.\n\n22 Aug, 2022, 08:40 AM IST"
