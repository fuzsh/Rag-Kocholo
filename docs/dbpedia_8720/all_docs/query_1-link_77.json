        "text": "Ali Shehzad Zaidi\n\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY URDU poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz (1911-1984) retains its transformational power. Recently, Faiz’s “We Will See” became a rallying cry during student protests in India against the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act which grants a path to citizenship only to non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.\n\nThe act also denies citizenship to those Indian Muslims who, lacking the means to acquire identity papers and birth certificates, are subjected to disenfranchisement, deportation, and imprisonment even if they were born in India.\n\nFaiz wrote “We Will See” in defiance of Zia-ul-Haq’s military dictatorship (1977-88). Its title, which evokes Judgment Day, is taken from a refrain in the Qur’an (Singh):\n\nWe will see.\n\nCertainly we, too, will see\n\nThat promised day —\n\nThat day ordained\n\nWhen these colossal mountains\n\nOf tyranny and oppression\n\nWill explode into wisps of hay —\n\nThe day when the earth under our feet\n\nWill quake and throb\n\nAnd over the heads of despots\n\nSwords of lightning will flash —\n\nThe day when all the idols\n\nWill be removed from this sacred world\n\nAnd we, the destitute and the despised,\n\nWill, at last, be granted respect —\n\nThe day when crowns\n\nWill be tossed into the air\n\nAnd all the thrones utterly destroyed.\n\nOnly the name of God will remain\n\nWho is both absent and present —\n\nBoth the seen and the seer.\n\nThe cry “I am Truth” will rend the skies\n\nWhich means you, I, and all of us.\n\nAnd sovereignty will belong to the people\n\nWhich means you, I, and all of us.\n\n(Faiz in English 24-25)\n\nThe poem deposes the idols of money, power, and prestige while seeking meaning in collective existence. The words “I am Truth” are those uttered by the Persian Sufi mystic Mansour Hallaj who was executed in the early 10th century. They affirm the unity of all creation, heightening the paradox of God existing, seemingly at once, everywhere and nowhere.\n\nEven before the partition of India, Faiz had become a literary sensation with the publication of his first collection of poetry Naqsh-i-Faryadi (The Lamenting Image) in 1941. After Pakistan’s independence in 1947, Faiz became the chief editor of The Pakistan Times.\n\nIn 1951, Faiz came further into national prominence during the Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case, in which he and many of his associates were imprisoned, blacklisted, or forced underground. Among them was Sajjad Zaheer, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP) who, like Faiz, spent four years in jail.\n\nIn 1954, while Zaheer was still imprisoned, the CPP, repressed since its inception, was banned outright. After his release from jail in 1955, Zaheer went into exile in India. In his memoir The Light, written in prison, Zaheer affirms:\n\n“History is witness to the fact that conservative rulers and unlawful governments have always tried to put down the voice of truth with force and violence. If they have not been able to buy off or intimidate an independent mind, a truthful tongue, or a bold pen, they have used the iron chair, the poison cup, or the executioner’s sword to achieve their end. But history also proves that the free spirit of man can never be confined. No true scholar, poet, or artist, whose work reflects the evolving reality of his times, can be suppressed. Even if he is forcibly silenced, the very reality that is denied free expression bursts forth like clear springs from the hearts of millions of the common people.” (The Light 72)\n\nFaiz was released from prison the same year as Zaheer and went into exile in London. As had been imprisonment, exile proved to be a seminal and defining experience for Faiz, as in “Resolution”:\n\nMy heart, my restless traveler:\n\nagain it has been decreed\n\nthat you and I be banished\n\nfrom this our beloved land.\n\nWe will construct our poems\n\nin foreign towns\n\nand bear our contempt for oppressors\n\nfrom door to door.\n\n(Faiz in English 28)\n\nTravel would remain a constant for Faiz. Late in life, Faiz wrote two memoirs of his visits to socialist countries: Cuban Travelogue (1973) and Months and Years of Friendship: Recollections (1981), which concerns his impressions of the Soviet Union.\n\nExile, Return and War\n\nAfter co-founding the Afro-Asian Writers Movement at the 1958 conference in Tashkent, Faiz returned to Pakistan but was arrested upon arrival. He spent two years in prison and, after his sentence was commuted, again went into exile in London.\n\nFaiz returned to Pakistan in 1964 to become the principal of Abdullah Haroon College in the working-class neighborhood of Lyari in Karachi. During his exile, the regime of General Ayub Khan had consolidated power through its Inter-Services Intelligence agency.\n\nAyub won the 1965 presidential election despite losing the popular vote to Fatima Jinnah, sister of Pakistan’s founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In a tainted indirect election, Ayub claimed victory with the support of more than 62% of the electors. Two years later, Fatima Jinnah, who had become a symbol of resistance to the military regime, died in her home under suspicious circumstances.\n\nIn 1968, the student protests that were sweeping Paris, New York, Mexico City, and other major cities, spread to Pakistan. Popular support for the demonstrations and strikes against the military dictatorship forced Ayub to resign in March 1969. Ayub was succeeded as president by the Army Chief of Staff, General Yahya Khan.\n\nAlthough he allowed direct elections to be held in 1970, Yahya refused to yield power to the winner of those elections, namely, the Awami League, which had pledged autonomy for East Pakistan. In March 1971, Yahya suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly, causing the leader of the Awami League, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to call for the independence of Bangladesh.\n\nThe Pakistani Army massacred Bengali nationalists and intellectuals, including students and professors at Dhaka University. Meanwhile, Bengali mobs and the separatist guerillas known as the Mukti Bahini were massacring Biharis and other Urdu-speaking Pakistanis.\n\nWar between India and Pakistan began in December 1971, ending that month in the surrender of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. In this excerpt from “Return from Dhaka,” Faiz mourns the communal madness that had transpired:\n\nTwisted brass bangles\n\nand laughter\n\nslit from ear to ear.\n\nOn every tree\n\na crucified nightingale.\n\nThe river reflects the sky\n\nand the sky is the growl\n\nof a tiger.\n\nWill the monsoons restore\n\ncolour to the earth?\n\nHow long\n\nwill the fuel of pain\n\nburn?\n\n(The unicorn and the dancing girl 96)\n\nThe image of the tiger recalls the tigers that roam the Sundarbans, the mangrove forests of Bangladesh, as well as the ferocity of the cataclysmic events taking place there. The sky’s reflection in the river awakens the memory of the monsoons during the seventies that resulted in floods as well mass famine in Bangladesh in 1974.\n\nIn a speech about the classical Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib, Faiz said that the mark of a poet’s greatness is the ability to encompass the world’s pain in one’s art (Hashmi 100-101). This ability, a measure of Faiz’s own greatness, is on full display in “Return from Dhaka.”\n\nTheme for a Poet\n\nThrough his alchemic imagination, Faiz turned pain into something beautiful and lasting, as in “Theme for a Poet.”\n\nImagine roses blooming\n\nin a limestone quarry\n\nand wine squeezed out of\n\ndesert thorns.\n\nMountain stream\n\ncleaved in two\n\nby a dark boulder.\n\nFear and hope.*\n\n(Faiz in English 31)\n\nRoses connote love, passion, and divine contemplation. The image of limestone, which has healing properties, conveys the poet’s quest to transmute suffering in the parched spiritual wilderness evoked by the desert thorns. Wine symbolizes initiation into mystical knowledge and joyous communion which can be realized even amidst desolation.\n\nThe mountain stream is an image that combines water, the source of life, with the mountain, representing spiritual ascension and stature. Although a dark boulder blocks the mountain stream’s path, water, to take the long view, will eventually find its way. The temporarily thwarted progress towards justice awakens both fear and hope.\n\nAccording to the Urdu poet N. M. Rashed, Faiz was influenced by the Romantic poets, especially Keats and Shelley (8). Faiz found in the 19th-century composer Chopin a kindred romantic soul. In “Chopin’s music,” Faiz summons a bitter-sweet world of destruction and creation:\n\nRain-spears and the night a sieve.\n\nWeeping walls, houses sunk in silence\n\nAnd freshly-bathed plants.\n\nWinds in the lanes and alleys.\n\nChopin’s music is being played.\n\nThe moon’s pallor\n\nOn the face of a wistful girl.\n\nBlood on the snow\n\nAnd every drop a leaping flame.\n\nChopin’s music is being played.\n\nLovers of freedom ambushed by\n\nthe enemy.\n\nA few escaped.\n\nOthers were slaughtered.\n\nThey will always be remembered.\n\nChopin’s music is being played.\n\nA crane covers her eyes with her wings\n\nAnd weeps alone\n\nIn the sky’s blue wilderness.\n\nA hawk pounces on her.\n\nChopin’s music is being played.\n\nGrief has petrified a father’s face.\n\nThe mother sobs as she kisses\n\nThe forehead of her dead son.\n\nChopin’s music is being played.\n\nThe season of flowers has returned\n\nAnd lovers rejoice.\n\nEverywhere there is the dance of water.\n\nNeither clouds nor rain.\n\nChopin’s music is being played.\n\n(Faiz in English 59)\n\nThe image of rain-spears evokes tears and piercing pain. In China, the crane symbolizes longevity and its migratory flight heralds the arrival of spring besides evoking the soul’s immortality. In India, the crane is associated with treachery (Chevalier and Gheerbrant 240-241), which can be seen in the crane’s fate in “Chopin’s Music.”\n\nThe moon’s pallor recalls Percy Shelley’s “To the Moon” in which the moon is a disconsolate pilgrim of history:\n\nArt though pale for weariness\n\nOf climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,\n\nWandering companionless\n\nAmong the stars that have a different birth, —\n\nand ever changing, like a joyless eye\n\nThat finds no object worth its constancy?\n\n(Shelley 1081-1082)\n\nThese poignant images in “Chopin’s Music” beckon us to, if not to intervene in the world, at the very least to bear witness. To invest an unjust world with feeling is to become its heart and conscience.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nChevalier, Jean and Alain Gheerbrant. Dictionary of Symbols. Tr. John Buchanan-Brown.
