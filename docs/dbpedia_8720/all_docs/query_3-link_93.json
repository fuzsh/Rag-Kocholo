Focusing on modern and contemporary visual art history, it identifies key milestones in the relationship between art and politics in the region—a rich and extensive history stretching from the early 20th century during the anti-colonial struggle to the geopolitical shifts of the 1990s. Over this period, the dynamic interplay between art and politics gave rise to groundbreaking artistic forms, shaping the perspectives of contemporary activism in South Asia, whether through rejection or adoption. Employing a chronological approach to this subject allows for an understanding of the major trends that characterize the art field in a rapidly changing context. Simultaneously, the examination of specific regional examples helps identify expressions of the evolving connection between aesthetics and politics, shedding light on the distinctive and fluid role of artists engaged in political expressions.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n3In the field of art sciences, it should be noted that academic studies on the art-politics dialectic have appeared since the early 2000s, showing a wide range of approaches and analytical perspectives. D. Achar and S. K. Panikkar (2012), for example, brings together articles on current developments in activist art in South Asia. Similarly, the writings of K. Zitzewitz (2014) and those of T. Guha-Thakurta and V. Zamindar (2024) question the secularist dimension of art in South Asia, in the light of the violent challenges and attacks to which it has recently been subjected. S. Ramaswamy (2011) gathers a series of essays on the significance of the attacks carried out by Hindu nationalist organizations against the artist M. F. H., while S. Mathur’s work (2019) analyzes the effects of the writings of art critic G. Kapur on the directions of engaged contemporary art in India. Finally, M. Maheshwari (2019) approaches the question of censorship, blasphemy, and the right of expression in the arts by combining sociology, political, and legal sciences.\n\n8In presenting this historical and aesthetic panorama, I will focus on three artistic movements that have maintained specific relationships with political and social junctures in South Asia, and that continue to exert a certain influence on the development of contemporary artistic activism. This will provide an initial insight into the diversity of forms of articulation between art and politics that have taken place in the 20th century: firstly, the Bengal School and its links with the Swadeshi movement in the early 20th century, then artistic primitivism from the 1920s to the 1930s and its correlations with a political primitivism initiated by Gandhi, and finally the progressive art movement from the 1930s to the 1950s and its correspondences with the international anti-fascist and progressive movement. In this overview, I will put particular emphasis on the significance of the ideological and aesthetic line adopted by the progressive movement, which had a significant impact on the engaged art of the immediate post-independence period right up to the imposition of the state of emergency in India (1975–1977), and I will conclude with a discussion on the survival of these different legacies (between rejection and adoption) within contemporary artistic activism in South Asia.\n\n9Thus, the aim of this article is to contribute to the development of a narrative surrounding the history of socially committed art in South Asia. The goal is not merely to establish direct connections between political upheavals and artistic advancements, but rather to recognize how these political events have influenced the formal and conceptual innovations within the avant-gardes of this region.\n\n1. The art of the Bengal School and the political thought of Swadeshi\n\nIndian aesthetics are an inexhaustible treasure trove of refined invention. But have you never noticed that all these inventions come from the past, that modern India, anglicized India has produced neither beauty nor poetry, but has profoundly destroyed the beauty and poetry of our heritage. … Swadeshi must be more than a political weapon. It must be a religious and artistic ideal. (Coomaraswamy 1912:1–2)\n\n2. Political primitivism and artistic primitivism\n\n14Around the 1920s, the advent of a “political primitivism,” nourished in particular by the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi, redistributed the definition of Indianness and led to the emergence of an “Indian artistic primitivism.”\n\n17The origins of Indian artistic primitivism are therefore eminently political. The Indian nationalist movement, in the wake of Orientalist studies, recognized traditional, popular, rural, as well as many forms of tribal and “subaltern” art, as explicit manifestations of the “authentic” expression of the Indian soul. The nationalist elite then constructed the mythical image of the “Indian peasant,” the naive bearer of the “authenticity” of the nation’s values, perpetuating cultural practices unchanged since times immemorial, while in comparison the urban world, exposed to the various invasions (Persians, Afghans, the Portuguese, and the British), had long since lost its “cultural purity” to a decadent cosmopolitanism. Rural communities were seen as living manifestations of a kind of original Indian society (an ideal image of a golden age of Indian history and culture).\n\n18We can identify four major reasons for the emergence of rural art as a source of expression of national authenticity and the construction of the myth of “rural art.” First of all, Indian rural art was seen as a radical antithesis to Western academicism. Promoting rural art was a way of advocating art for the masses and condemning the elitism of bourgeois and aristocratic art, which had adopted the values of European academic naturalism or those of the Bengal School. From then on, the aristocratic style of the Bengal School, with its miniaturization, preciosity, literary themes, and taste for historicism, no longer embodied the new values granted to Indianness. But the art of rural India also reinforced the myth of the poverty and simplicity of the original India. In adopting the spinning wheel, Mahatma Gandhi understood perfectly well the political significance of the image of rural craftsmanship. The ancestral character of Indian craftsmanship in rural areas was magnified and the idea of an unchanging India erected as a national myth. Indian intellectuals of that time drew parallels between local rural art and a certain Western modernity, if only in the purification of forms and visual simplification. Finally, this glorification of rural craftsmanship helped define an Indian identity, and more specifically a Hindu one. Popular practices in the countryside evoked the myth of a “pure” and “authentic” India, impervious to foreign pollution.\n\n19The village would remain central to national imagery in the context of the modernization driven by Nehru’s socialism in the first decades after independence.\n\n20The aesthetic reference to folk and tribal art was unanimously accepted and encouraged by all political components of the independence movement. For the left wing of the Congress and for the Communist Party, revaluing popular art meant stimulating a mass art form that had been ignored for too long in South Asia by the cultural superstructure of the bourgeoisie. The new appreciation of traditional crafts also satisfied the right wing of the Congress and the various Hindu components of Indian nationalism. It allowed them to re-emphasize Vedic national values and the idea of an “authentic” India that was not only pre-British, but pre-Muslim. The remarkable contribution of Islamic cultures to Indian popular art was thus minimized, if not eliminated.\n\n22Primitivism thus gave rise to political debate, but also to an aesthetic one. In the West, the primitivism movement in art, in its explicit desire to overturn the values of rationalism, gave birth to the criticism of industrial capitalism, cultivating the myth of the Golden Age. These European critics were nourished, in particular, by a certain type of Eastern philosophy, filtered through the proponents of Theosophy and establishing a duality between materialism and spirituality. Kandinsky, for example, made connections between the Russian Orthodox faith and Indian spirituality. Malevich was strongly influenced by the writings of Vivekananda, and Mondrian was an avid reader of the Bhagavad-Gita, the Upanishads, as well as the writings of Krishnamurti.\n\n23In Western theological interpretations of a modernity renewed by primitivism, the South Asian art world found the tools to forge its own identity. Primitivism presented itself as an alternative to Western rationalism and colonialism, through its willingness to critically consider the spiritual needs of a technological civilization. For the elite of the subcontinent, as for certain proponents of modern art in Europe, the primitivist movement opened up the possibility for an aesthetic of globalization, including non-Western achievements, as an integral part of Art history. The postulate of primitivist aesthetics was thus objectified: recognition of the absolute universality of artistic language, where any art object could be understood independently of the meaning it had in the society in which it was conceived. The connoisseur’s interest in primitive objects had to be directed primarily to the plastic qualities of the figures—their effect of line, surface, and mass color—regardless of any sociological and cultural data (it was felt that the ethnological context could confuse the appreciation of the plastic qualities in themselves).\n\n3. Political progressivism and artistic progressivism\n\nThe left cultural front—PWA and IPTA\n\n27The policy instigated by the then Secretary General of the CPI, P. C. Joshi (in office from 1936 to 1948), was decisive in the creation and dynamism of the PWA and the IPTA, by recognizing a significant role for culture and the arts in the political struggles (Adjania 2016). The PWA and the IPTA were veritable melting pots where writers, actors, and artists came together and worked in synergy, in a totally original and innovative way. Among the many writers affiliated with or close to the PWA, we can cite: M. R. Anand (English-language writer): Coolie (1936), The Sword and the Sickle (1942); Y. Singh (Hindi-language writer): Dada Kamred (“Comrade, the big brother,” 1941), Deshdrohi (“Traitor,” 1943); T. S. Pillai (Malayalam-language writer): Thottiyude Makan (“Scavenger’s son,” 1947); Randidangazhi (“Two measures,” 1947); T. Bandyopadhyay (Bengali-language writer): Ganadevata (“The people as God,” 1942), Bingsho Shatabdi (“The 20th century,” 1945). In the field of visual arts, it was with the formation of the Calcutta Group (CG) in 1943, and then the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG) in 1947, that progressive aesthetics began to be embodied in modern art. Artistically, progressive artists rejected the academic realism of R. Varma and the sentimentalist and Orientalist aesthetics of the Bengal School of A. Tagore. For the progressive artists of this period, the defense of progressive values went hand in hand with the affirmation of international artistic modernism. Their formal references drew on the modernist formalism of the Euro-American avant-gardes (Singh 2023). But progressive masters could also borrow from Asian traditions, cultivating the idea of a universal human community. As Z. Jumabhoy points out: “Progressives consistently drew on these hybrid traditions because their work argued for a plural nation, providing a visual counterpoint to Nehru’s plea for ‘unity in diversity’” (Jumabhoy 2018:22).\n\n28The Indian People’s Theater Association (IPTA) was founded on May 25, 1943, at the National Conference of Theater Artists held at the Marwari School, Bombay. The name of this theatrical association was chosen in reference to Romain Rolland’s eponymous work Le Théâtre du Peuple, published in 1903. Through this association, it was in the field of theater that the link between art and politics seems to have been the most active (Nercam 2011). Most IPTA members were Communists or Communist sympathizers. Working in the performing arts, the IPTA was made up of actors, singers, dancers, directors, and teachers, who were organized into “brigades.” The IPTA’s aesthetic and ideological line differed little from that of the PWA, of which it was an offshoot. The theater group aimed to forge connections with audiences from peasant and working-class backgrounds through their campaigning efforts (mobilizing the people through shows, in order to prepare for the revolution, combining revolutionary and nationalist fervor). This led affiliated troupes to work outside the aesthetic and logistical framework of traditional urban theaters. Events in the streets, in suburban factories, or in the heart of villages became the new formulas for theatrical productions.\n\n30The IPTA became the center of a new theatrical form involving stage design and acting, as well as a new cinema. In the field of theater, for example, let us cite the Bengali director and actor B. Bhattacharya and his play Nabanna (Harvest) produced in 1944, and the troupe director U. Dutta. In the same vein, the Gananatya theater troupe, also a member of the IPTA, collected rural folk songs and disseminated them to the working population of the metropolises of northern India. In the field of cinema, let us limit ourselves to mentioning the names of personalities who helped to build and animate the IPTA: the Bengali filmmakers R. Ghatak and M. Sen, the Hindi filmmaker K. A. Abbas, the film actors P. Kapoor and B. Sahni. This movement should be recognized for its pivotal role in catalyzing liberation efforts, harnessing the creative energy of young people in the national struggle, and addressing the challenges posed by local feudalism, British imperialism, and fascism. In Sri Lanka, the Marxist-based Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) was founded in 1935 and was as much involved in the anti-colonial fight and the construction of a nationalist policy as it was in defending the working classes. Essential to the formation of the LSSP were Sri Lankan students returning from English or American universities, who had been exposed to international communist politics and the ideas of Indian communism. The LSSP was also at the origin of an active progressive cultural policy in Sri Lanka (Hoek and Sunderason 2022).\n\nAn “aesthetics of the left”\n\n31These associations (PWA, IPTA, LSSP) enabled the expression of a new artistic sensitivity, representing the social and political realities of South Asia at that time (the throes of war, famine, and anti-colonial struggle) and denouncing the oppression of the feudal conservative system and of colonial and capitalist imperialism. As cultural organizations affiliated with Marxism, they forged a novel connection between political and social activism and modern art in the subcontinent, marking significant milestones in the cultural history of South Asia (Panikkar 2017). The emerging aesthetic centered on a fundamental question: how to encapsulate the lived experiences of struggle among the populace and ignite efforts toward social and political change?\n\n32The artists, writers, filmmakers, poets, and art critics associated with or sympathetic to these groups endeavored to craft forms that resonated with their ethical and political convictions. Their aim was to disseminate revolutionary Marxist ideas within the context of the anti-colonial struggle, striving to break free from the artistic norms of their time. Their objective was to enable the expression and portrayal of repression and inequality, shedding light on the plight of the oppressed. Artists such as Chittoprasad Bhattachraya (1915–1978), Z. Abedine (1914–1976), and playwright B. Bhattacharya (1906–1978) exemplified this approach through their depictions of the horrors of the 1943 famine. The question of artistic form and its participation in a broad political mobilization was, of course, central to the aesthetic debate within the PWA. In the visual arts, the PWA rejected colonial academicism and the Orientalism of the Bengal School, and was wary of the Parnassian dimension (“art for art’s sake”) and formalism that the association attributed to the Western avant-gardes. While acknowledging the contribution of artistic primitivism, the association advocated an aesthetic of realism, in line with the “critical realism” approach developed by Berthold Brecht who invited the committed artist to “reveal the complex causality of social relationships …, denounce dominant ideas …, underline the moment of the evolution of everything” (Brecht 1976:117). The PWA drew on G. Lukacs’s description of the “realist artist”:\n\nEvery major realist fashions the material given in his own experience, and in so doing makes use of techniques of abstraction, among others. But his goal is to penetrate the laws governing objective reality and to uncover the deeper, hidden, mediated, not immediately perceptible network of relationships that go to make up society. (Lukacs 1938, 2001:1043)\n\n33Realism was an aesthetic form that allowed an “objective representation of reality in order to reveal contradictions in social relations and thus show the way for revolutionary change” (Sarkar 2009:70). The realism cultivated by this association was far removed from a verist representation of reality. From the progressive artistic movements of the 1930s–1940s, linked to the Marxist cultural movements, there developed in South Asia what L. Hoek and S. Sunderason call “an aesthetics of the left” (Hoek and Sunderason 2023), which initially manifested within the framework of the decolonization struggles and debates and, once independence was achieved, defined the main links between art and politics.\n\n34These committed artists and artists’ collectives, which were originally aligned with the ideological stance and commissions of the Communist Party, reoriented political aesthetics towards “national-popular art” (Hoek and Sunderason 2022) in the post-1947 political context. The forms developed by this “aesthetics of the left” were mobile and singular in their relationship to political and ideological content (Hoek and Sunderason 2022). Such a collaboration between nationalism (working for liberation from the colonial yoke) and the left (working for a socialist revolution) relied on the use of a common vocabulary: “people,” “popularization,” “popular,” “politics / art / artist,” “progressive.” The left largely supported Gandhian populism, interacting with a revolutionary popular imagination (Hoek and Sunderason 2022).\n\nThe notion of “progress”\n\n35The PWA and IPTA viewed “progress” as a transformative shift, especially considering the prevailing social and political circumstances, notably the conditions of colonial and feudal oppression. The role and objective of progressive arts and culture were to contribute to the promotion and realization of these changes, by creating a necessary social and ideological sensitivity that would allow the participation of the people in this process of change (giving access to a degree of consciousness that would allow conservatism to be transgressed). The manifesto drawn up by the All India PWA at the association’s first congress, held in Lucknow on April 10, 1936, sets out the concept of “progress” in these terms:\n\nWe believe that the new literature of India must deal with the basic problems of our existence today—the problem of hunger and poverty, social backwardness and political subjection. All that drags us down to passivity, inaction and unreason we reject as reactionary. All that arouses in us the critical spirit, which examines institutions and customs in the light of reason, which helps us to act, to organize ourselves, to transform, we accept as progressive. (Pradhan [1975] 1985:75)\n\n36The notion of “progress” was therefore conditioned by a specific historical context linked to the conditions of colonial South Asia. It was clearly opposed to the “colonialist,” “fascist,” “imperialist,” and “reactionary” forces (it was in these oppositions that the ability of associations to federate was to be found), in the light of Marxist and Communist conceptions of social progress and the emancipation of humanity. Progressive culture was expected not only to militate for, or even actively participate in, changing the conditions of the material world, but above all to stimulate creation in the fields of literature, theater, the arts, and all forms of cultural actions. The aim was to create “the cultural needs” to bring about these political and social changes. The President of the first session of the PWA, M. Premchand, highlighted this dimension in his inaugural speech:\n\nWe shall consider only that literature as progressive which is thoughtful, which awakens in us the spirit of freedom and of beauty; which is creative; which is luminous with the realities of life; which moves us; which leads us to action and which does not act on us as a narcotic; which does not produce in us a state of intellectual somnolence—for if we continue to remain in that state, it can only mean that we are no longer alive. (Prem Chand 1985:44)\n\n37The idea of “progressive” culture, promoted mainly by the left-wing parties of that time, had a strong regional impact in Bombay, Calcutta, Chittagong, Dhaka, Lahore, Karachi, Kashmir, and Colombo. Across South Asia, this rhetoric of progressive art, carried by writers and artists, was rooted in the demands of a Universalist modernism of artistic forms, associated with socialist values. The leading figures of this progressive cultural movement in South Asia, such as M. R. Anand in India or F. Ahmad Faiz in Pakistan, cultivated a dialogue between national identity and international values. The assimilation of M. R. Anand’s thought into Nehruvian modernity—defense of secularism and a multicultural Indian nation—and F. Ahmad Faiz’s exile—imposed by a repressive Pakistani regime—helped to build a Left culture that blended “alienation” and “assimilation.”\n\nProgressive aesthetics after independence\n\n38The period of the anti-colonial struggle was therefore clearly a moment of particular convergence between art and politics. The political investment of the artistic avant-garde, which was in the orbit of the independence movement, contributed in its own way (however modest), and in the field of art and culture, to the advent of independence: the proclamation of independence, on August 14 and 15, 1947 for Pakistan and India, and on February 4, 1948 for Sri Lanka. In this way, the relationship between art and politics in the first half of the 20th century could be perceived as particularly effective; the figure of the artist as a “subjective and subversive agent” (Achar and Panikkar 2012) was able to demonstrate its effectiveness and power to change society. Members of the political and artistic world might have believed in a form of harmony between artistic revolution and political revolution. In South Asia in the 1930s and 1940s, the art-politics nexus came together at a time of particularly acute crisis (world war, anti-colonial combat, famine, partition, migratory flows), in a period where politics, like culture and art, were fractured concepts. This fracturing of concepts would be the legacy of the colonial period, and the artists of immediate independence—artists whom the art critic J. Appasamy describes as “transitional artists” (Appasamy 1987:26–28)—would have to recompose an art-politics articulation on new bases.\n\n39Once the independence of the countries of South Asia had been achieved, the development of a progressive art would take forms and directions linked both to the contingencies of the Cold War and to the local specificities of social and political development. The 1960s and 1970s were critical years, marked by the intensification of decolonization, by the crises between the USSR and China, and by the spread of the revolutionary ideology of Maoism, which fascinated not only Western intellectuals but also students from the Third World.\n\n41In West Pakistan, the painter and calligrapher S. Ahmed Naqvi (1930–1987) joined the PWA in the late 1940s. From the beginning of his career, his allegorical paintings depicted the struggles of workers and the toiling masses, accompanied by Kufic calligraphy.\n\n42After Partition, Z. Abedin settled in East Pakistan and helped found the Institute of Arts and Crafts at Dhaka University (now the Faculty of Fine Arts) in 1948. His art would remain strongly imbued with the themes of famine and peasant suffering, and his pictorial style would remain marked by the realistic/expressionist aesthetic of these drawings of the 1943 famine. In 1954, he helped to organize the first All Pakistan Art Exhibition, bringing together artists from both Pakistan and India (Dadi 2010). In East Pakistan (Bangladesh in 1971), the left was at the origin of cultural and political demonstrations on a national scale, allowing dialogue with peasants, tribes, and the working class—all linked to student movements—to contribute to the construction of a Bangladeshi linguistic and cultural identity. In January 1969, students at Dhaka University drew up an 11-point political and cultural program against the dictatorial military regime of General A. Khan. Then, in February 1969 (in the wake of the Naxalite movement), a socialist peasant uprising was led by Maulana Bhashani, the leader of the National Awami Party peasant party (Hoek and Sunderason 2022).\n\n43In Sri Lanka, the left was also involved in building a politics of identity in a country where the issue of language and the relations between Sinhalese and Tamil cultures are particularly tense. On the island, 1971 was marked by Maoist-inspired popular and student uprisings claiming solidarity with the Naxalite movement.\n\n44The narratives of the left in postcolonial South Asia have were dynamic, multifaceted, and shaped by activists and sympathizers with informal connections that transcended the ideological and political boundaries of nation-states and parties. These historical junctures were thus characterized by personal experiences, artistic expressions, national aspirations, and transnational influences, forming a complex web of intersections.\n\n4. Artistic activism in South Asia: between globalization and local roots\n\n45It was during the national liberation movement that the defining traits of the “committed artist” were solidified, a designation that set the standard for creative practitioners until the 1980s. Under the Nehru/Gandhi dynasty, the Indian Republic regarded the artist as “an ideal representative of the national community” (Kapur 1981:1–9). The community of artists and intellectuals was expected to embody the progressive values advocated by the central State, by placing its social and artistic investment beyond community antagonisms, in order to contribute to the advent of an acceptable transition towards modern, democratic, and “secular” governance.\n\nThe “secular identity” of the artist\n\n46Embodying what G. Kapur calls “secular identity” became the credo of the artistic community (Kapur 2000). Artists and art critics largely adhered to the emancipatory ideology defended by the “Indian way.” This helped to endow the Congress government with a positive aura, presenting it as the Indian people’s one and only recourse towards political, economic, and cultural emancipation. The artist M. F. Husain (1915–2011), a founding member of the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), embodied this post-independence “national artist.” Born into a Sunni Muslim community in Maharashtra, M. F. Husain knew how to borrow from different iconographic and visual registers (references to Hindu iconography, textile motifs, modern Western formalisms, etc.) to build a visual vocabulary for the Indian nation.\n\n47This political protocol between the artistic world and Central government, organized around the defense of Congress values, began to crack when I. Gandhi, then Prime Minister, imposed the Indian Emergency from 1975 to 1977. The Congress government, badly shaken by a determined political opposition and a series of electoral defeats, decided to suspend the democratic process by imposing a state of emergency in order to combat, in its own words, a situation of “national anarchy.” Many artists decided to defy these bans and exhibit their paintings, sculptures, and street performances, often provoking a muscular reaction from the police or army. It was at this point that the notion of a “national culture” began to take hold in Indian intellectual and artistic circles, and the question of cultural plurality became a central issue.\n\n48The Place for People exhibition, organized by G. Kapur in New Delhi in 1981, crystallized the new aspirations of a committed art. In its catalogue (Kapur 1981:1–9), the art historian asserted that the polarities that had structured modern Indian art (in particular “Indian art / Western art” and “art / national identity”) were now outdated. The works of the invited artists—B. Khakhar (1934–2003), G. M. Sheikh (b. 1937), J. Chowdhury (b. 1939), V. Sundaram (1943–2023), N. Malini (b. 1946), S. Patwardhan (b. 1949)—presented a wide range of figurative art, intimately blending borrowings from classical art, Indian popular and urban art, American pop art, and European Figuration Libre.\n\n49In 1989, in the ideological wake of this exhibition, the Indian Radical Painters and Sculptors Association was created, being made up of young communist activists from the state of Kerala. In their manifesto, the Radicals, drawing on the theories of subalternist historians, criticized modern Indian art for its lack of independence and its institutional character. In their view, the lack of singularity in artistic modernity stemmed from a failure (or even a refusal) to analyze its colonial origins. Denouncing the ideological predominance of a “culture of elites,” the Radicals advocated an art with a political protest content aimed at the most disadvantaged, the voiceless in political and economic life (Spivak 1988). Despite its short life, this association played a crucial role in unveiling the falsehoods within the democratic state’s discourse on minorities and contributed significantly to revitalizing the connection between political activism and artistic expression.\n\nArt and intercommunal conflicts\n\n52For the artist V. Sundaram, the events in Ayodhya had a decisive impact on his artistic production; he abandoned painting on canvas, his preferred medium at that time, to devote himself to installation, which he felt was better able to convey the political message of his artistic creations with plastic and ideological relevance. In 1993, the artist presented his installation, Memorial, in which he depicted the death of a stranger during communal clashes. This artwork became the emblematic image of the decline of the conception of a tolerant and secularist India, guaranteeing peace between communities. The work is intended as a warning to citizens who could be abused. According to V. Sundaram, religious fundamentalism is used to distract communities from a serious analysis of the ideological driving forces of capitalist globalization, whose economic interests are, in principle, transcommunitarian.\n\n53Among the many reactions of artists to the rise of Hindutva (political-religious concept claiming that India is intrinsically Hindu), the SAHMAT association (Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust), which is a forum of artists and intellectuals set up in 1989, stands out. Under its slogan “Artists Alert!” SAHMAT mobilizes academics, artists, and social actors at events where democratic rights are being called into question. The association is still very active on the minorities front, defending their rights and their security within the national cultural space. The events in Ayodhya were a major catalyst for its actions. As well as producing and distributing 200,000 posters across the country, denouncing the actions of Hindu nationalism and the passivity of the government, on January 1, 1993, SAHMAT organized Anhad Garje, an experimental, syncretic, and itinerant musical program where the popular musical traditions of Sufi-Bhakti, a blend of Muslim musical traditions and Hindu devotional music, were given a contemporary flavor (Moos and Rahman 2013).\n\n54In 2003, S. Gupta decided to express her anger and frustration at the extreme violence of the communal clashes in the state of Gujarat. She produced an intervention called Blame (2002–2003). On a local train in Mumbai, the artist offered passengers the chance to buy, for the sum of 10 rupees, a bottle called “Blame,” filled with a red liquid imitating the color of blood. Each bottle read: “BLAME. Blaming you brings me so much happiness. So, I make you responsible for what you cannot control. For your religion. For your nationality. I want to blame you because it brings me happiness.” In each compartment of the train, she presented her product and declared, somewhat provocatively: “If you are a Hindu, you can blame a Muslim. If you are a Muslim, you can blame a Hindu. Buy this Blame bottle and put it above your television at home” (Bombay Maximum City 2006:160).\n\n55Intervention groups of Hindu nationalist organizations continue to intimidate the artistic world with violent actions in the name of condemning blasphemy and the defamation of religion. Their targets are artists, training places, galleries, and exhibition centers. One of their notable coups took place on November 21, 2015, during the Jaipur Art Summit. A far-right Hindu group protested against artist S. Kararwal’s installation in a public place entitled Divine Bovine. It was a “flying cow” made of polystyrene and suspended from a balloon. The artist’s intention was to draw the public’s attention to the consumption of plastic and waste by cows in urban areas. For nationalist activists, the hanging work was provocative as it gave a degrading and insulting image of the sacred animal. The police decided in favor of the nationalists and Kararwal’s cow only remained in the air for around thirty minutes (Pal 2015).\n\nConclusion\n\n56The complex history of the frequently strained interaction between art and politics laid the groundwork, both practically and theoretically, for numerous contemporary manifestations of artistic activism in South Asia. Activist collectives in South Asia frequently draw upon diverse sources, including classical and medieval artistic traditions (inherited from the Bengal School) as well as tribal and rural South Asian arts (inspired by primitivism in the arts), to enrich their endeavors. This is evidenced by the emergence of Dalit and Adivasi art on the contemporary South Asian art scene, which claims a specific history and practice. The main lesson to be drawn from the example of progressive art is that artistic production should be as close as possible to social events and political protest movements. Thus, with Hum Sab Ayodhya (1993), the SAHMAT collective did not hesitate to locate its interventions in the heart of Ayodhya site, which was highly contested at that time.\n\n57One of the most distinctive features of South Asian artistic activism, and one that creates a significant break with the history of committed art, is its distrust of institutionalized political and trade-union forces. The artists’ experiences as fellow travelers of various political parties (communists as well as nationalists) demonstrated the incompatibility between political revolution and artistic revolution. In India, the exploration of the progressive perspective shed light on forms of anti-colonial political and cultural struggle that had been ignored or downplayed by Congress power.\n\n58Exploring the diverse expressions of artistic activism in South Asia prompts us to contemplate the epistemology of both art studies and the sociology of political and social movements. These reflections and debates on the nature of engaged art in South Asia influence, either directly or indirectly, the various contemporary activist forms, imbuing them with a broad theoretical spectrum. While this theoretical diversity is evident in many South Asian artistic activist productions showcased at major international multicultural events today, it also resonates in locally and regionally focused activism that may lack institutional visibility."
