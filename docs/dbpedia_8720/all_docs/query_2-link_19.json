        "text": "Faiz Ahmad Faiz was a renowned Pakistani poet, writer, and intellectual who is considered one of the most celebrated Urdu poets of the 20th century. He was born on February 13, 1911, in Sialkot, which is now part of Pakistan. Faiz came from a family of intellectuals and was exposed to literature and poetry from an early age.\n\nEducation played a significant role in shaping Faiz's worldview. He studied at the Murray College in Sialkot and later at the Government College in Lahore, where he obtained his bachelor's degree. During his time at college, Faiz became involved in progressive and leftist political movements. He joined the All India Students Federation (AISF) and became an active member of the Communist Party of India.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Faiz began his career as a teacher and lecturer at M.A.O. College in Amritsar and Hailey College of Commerce in Lahore. He also worked as an editor for various literary magazines, including the prestigious \"Adab-i-Latif.\"\n\nFaiz’s poetic journey started in the early 1930s when he published his first poetry collection,\n\n\"Naqsh-e-Faryadi\" (The Image of Solitude), in 1941. His poetry reflected his deep concerns for social justice, equality, and the struggles of the common people. His subsequent works, including\n\n\"Dast-e-Saba\" (The Breeze's Hand), \"Zindan-Nama\" (The Prison Diary), and \"Dast-e-Tah-e-Sang\" (The Hand Under the Rock), cemented his position as a prominent voice in Urdu poetry.\n\nIn addition to his literary pursuits, Faiz remained actively involved in political and social movements throughout his life. He advocated for the rights of the working class, peasants, and the oppressed, and his poetry often highlighted their struggles. Faiz's association with progressive politics led to his imprisonment on several occasions, both by the British colonial government and later by the Pakistani authorities.\n\nIn 1947, when Pakistan gained independence from British rule, Faiz moved to Lahore and became an influential figure in the country's cultural and literary circles. He played a vital role in establishing the Pakistan Writers' Guild and worked as an editor for the \"Pakistan Times\" newspaper. Faiz's poetry resonated with people from all walks of life, and his popularity continued to grow both within Pakistan and internationally.\n\nDuring the military rule of General Ayub Khan in the 1960s, Faiz faced political persecution and spent four years in prison on charges of conspiracy against the government. However, even in confinement, his poetry became a symbol of resistance and resilience for those fighting for democratic values and social justice.\n\nFaiz's poetry has been translated into several languages, earning him a global readership. His works often tackled themes of love, humanism, revolution, and the quest for freedom. His poem \"Lab Pe Aati Hai Dua Ban Ke Tamanna Meri\" (My Wish Takes the Form of Words on My Lips) has become an anthem for hope and inspiration for many.\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz received numerous accolades for his contributions to literature and social activism. He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962, making him the first Asian poet to receive the prestigious honor. Faiz also served as a lecturer and a visiting professor at various universities, including the University of Punjab and the University of Karachi.\n\nSadly, Faiz passed away on November 20, 1984, in Lahore, leaving behind a rich legacy of poetry and activism. His work continues to inspire generations of poets, writers, and social activists, and his impact on Urdu literature remains profound. Faiz's poetry stands as a testament to his unwavering commitment to justice, compassion, and the power of words to create meaningful change in society."
