        "text": "Gintama's license is doing pretty well between manga, anime and live-action movie. Continuing its momentum, a year later, a sequel to the first part named Gintama 2 has just been released! So we find Gin and his friends in a crazy and fun adventure.\n\nGintama 2\n\nOriginal title:銀魂2: 掟は破るためにこそある – Gintama 2: Okite wa Yaburu Tame ni soko Aru\n\nGender: Action – Comedy – Supernatural\n\nCountry: Japan\n\nRelease date: August 17, 2018\n\nOriginal manga: Hideaki Sorachi\n\nSynopsis :\n\nGintoki Sakata, Shinpachi Shimura and Kagura ran out of money while running their Yorozuya office.They are unable to pay their rent and decide to work part-time. As they begin their work, they meet the Shogun-sama. At that time, the Shinsengumi special forces, led by Isao Kondo, were divided among themselves. The internal conflict with the Shinsengumi is related to a plot involving the Shogun-sama.\n\nMain cast\n\nShun Oguri: Gintoki Sakata (Museum)\n\nMasaki Suda: Shinpachi Shimura (Todome no Kiss)\n\nKanna Hashimoto [Rev. from DVL.] : Kagura (Gintama)\n\nMasami Nagasawa: Tae Shimura (Gintama)\n\nMasaki Okada: Kotaro Katsura (Gintama)\n\nJiro Sato as Cabaret Manager (Gintama)\n\nYuya Yagira: Toshiro Hijikata (Gintama)\n\nRyo Yoshizawa: Sogo Okita (Gintama)\n\nTsuyoshi Muro: Gengai Hiraga (Gintama)\n\nMidoriko Kimura: Otose (Ubai Ai, Fuyu)\n\nKankuro Nakamura: Isao Kondo (Gintama)\n\nTsuyoshi Domoto [KinKi Kids] as Shinsuke Takasugi (Gintama)\n\nHaruma Miura: Kamotaro Ito (Otona Koukou)\n\nMasataka Kubota: Bansai Kawakami (Tokyo Ghoul)\n\nJunki Tozuka: Sagaru Yamazaki (Gintama: Mitsuba hen)\n\nThe live adaptation of Gintama 2 had obviously attracted a certain audience whether fans of the license or curious people. We also recall that the first film made nine hundred and eighty-two million yen in the first four days of its release, the second film earned eight hundred and seven million yen in the first three days, breaking a new record. The choice to keep an identical cast, favorable reviews and word-of-mouth seem to have conquered the spectators, restoring the image of the adaptations. It should be noted that new characters make their appearances such as Shinichi Tsutsumi, Ryo Katsuji, Natsuna Watanabe among others. The theme song of the film, meanwhile, would be the work of the Japanese rock band Back Number.\n\nImpossible to miss one of the many videos (see official website below) made to promote the second part of the series. It will be about continuing the adventures of our heroes through the arc centered on the Shinsengumi and the Shogun. In view of the information cited above, success seems well on its way to being at the rendezvous! Moreover, although the information is not yet confirmed, at a recent event in Tokyo, director and lead actor Shun Oguri would have nothing against a third film. If you were skeptical about this sequel, we can only advise you to discover it.\n\nGintama 2 trailer and making-off:\n\nIn conclusion, we leave you all the useful information about the feature film of Gintama 2 (below) as well as a photography gallery. To make sure you don't miss any of the news, don't forget to visit our guide to live movies 2018!"
