        "text": "Basic Information:\n\n‚Ä¢ Title: From Me, To You | Kimi Ni Todoke | Reaching You | Âêõ„Å´Â±ä„Åë\n\n‚Ä¢ Genre: Romance, High School, Sclice Of Life, Drama\n\n‚Ä¢ Director: Naoto Kumazawa\n\n‚Ä¢ Writer: Karuno Shiina (Manga) | Rika Nezu, Naoto Kumazawa (Script)\n\n‚Ä¢ Release Date: 25 September, 2010\n\n‚Ä¢ Runtime: 128 Mins\n\nSynopses:\n\nWell-meaning, but socially awkward, Sawako Kuronuma (Mikako Tabe) is nicknamed ‚ÄúSadako‚Äù by her classmates because of her similar hair cut with the main character from the horror movie ‚ÄúRingu‚Äù. Her life then takes a turn when Shota Kazehaya (Haruma Miura), the most popular boy in school, falls for her ‚Ä¶\n\nShota Kazehaya (Haruma Miura) is classmates with Sawako. Unlike Sawako, he is outgoing and popular with all the students. He is even polite with Sawako, which makes Sawako respect him and even admire him.\n\nWith help from Kazehaya, Sawako gets better at interacting with her classmates and even makes friends with Chizuru Yoshida (Misako Renbutsu) & Ayane Yano (Natsuna Watanabe ).\n\nDuring this time, a cute girl named Ume Kurumizawa (Mirei Kiritani), who has been friends with Kazehaya since middle school, appears in front of Sawako and confesses her feelings for Kazahaya and asks for her help ‚Ä¶\n\n(Sorry, I shortened it because every summary I found was spoiler filled‚Ä¶ Wtf?)\n\nCast:\n\n„ÉªMikako Tabe as Sawako Kuronuma\n\n„ÉªHaruma Miura as Shota Kazehaya\n\n„ÉªMisako Renbutsu as Chizura Yoshida\n\n„ÉªNatsune Watanabe as Ayane Yano\n\n„ÉªMirei Kiritani as Ume Kurumizawa\n\nThoughts:\n\nLOVED the Manga (not seen the Anime, but I‚Äôll assume that‚Äôs great, too.) I was SO excited when I heard about this and was even more excited when I heard Haruma Miura would be the lead roll (I mean‚Ä¶ Whoever has seen him in Koizora will understand). So, as excited as I was for this Live adaption of the Manga‚Ä¶\n\nI was seriously let down. (Wait, hear me out!)\n\nI think the reason for this is that I‚Äôm of an older audience to what the Director was aiming for (I.E- Young teenage girls who genuinely fit the Shoujo manga audience). I felt that perhaps I would have enjoyed it more had I been younger‚Ä¶ Which was disappointing, because I really enjoyed the Manga, and hoped it would transcend over well. But, in (my my old lady opinion) it didn‚Äôt.\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôll try discuss this without comparing with the Manga, since many may want to watch this as a stand alone film (which it can be) when they haven‚Äôt read or watched the anime. However, I may sometimes make comparisons to the plot, so please excuse me (I‚Äôll try not too? üòÄ )\n\nMikako Tabe as Sawako Kuronuma was amazing. I hadn‚Äôt heard of her before watching her in this (though I did almost watch the film Hinokio she‚Äôs in, but in the end never did.) I was very impressed with her acting, especially with how she was able to pull off a girl who is a shy, timid, romantically dense, ‚Äúscary‚Äù yet misunderstood girl who just wants to get along with people. Her past has effected her quite a bit and though the viewer may watch it and think ‚Äòis that it?‚Äô you can see how the isolation she had endured because of reasons she can‚Äôt exactly help (her name) has affected her and made her into who she is.\n\nI thought her voice and characteristics as Sawako were perfect and she really helped me feel the emotions of Sawako and her dream of having friends and people to talk too. My only real complaint is the amount of times she cried. I mean, every little emotional thing and BAM! There she was crying. Of course, this is no doubt the writers fault, but it just came across as tiresome after a while and every-time the water works began I literally rolled my eyes. Maybe it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs supposed to show her welcoming new emotions and experiences, but it‚Äôs just my personal feeling that it became too much after a while. There‚Äôs nothing worse than a female lead who aaalways cries.\n\nBut of course, Haruma Miura as Shota Kazehaya was the roll I was most looking forward to seeing and honestly? I was a little disappointed. The most he seemed to do was look intently at the character of Sawako, smile charmingly and kind of just look over Sawako as more of a friend? He pulled off more of a shy, awkward guy with a crush than a popular guy that I think the writer was going for (and what he was in the Manga omg I‚Äôm sorry I had to say it üò¶ ). I was hoping for more chemistry or at least fluff (dammit I wanted Haruma Miura fluff!!) but sadly, it wasn‚Äôt delivered. It felt more like a coming of age story and Shota‚Äôs roll was merely support.\n\nI didn‚Äôt really understand his reasoning for falling for her (other than seeing her smile, once I might add‚Ä¶) nor really feel any kind of chemistry between the two. I KNOW he‚Äôs a good actor from seeing him in Gokusen, Koizora and Bloody Monday, so it‚Äôs a blatant fault on either the director or scriptwriters part, so I can‚Äôt really blame him as an actor, but rather the character they made him portray.\n\nSeriously, this guy knows how to create chemistry when playing a romantic lead but for this film he really fell short.\n\nMisako Renbutsu who played Chizura Yoshida and Natsune Watanabe as Ayane Yano were two characters who I loved. They were fierce, supportive and sassy girls who knew how to defend their new friend and stick up for themselves as well, whilst also showing an emotional side, proving that in the end, they are just regular high school girls and rumours effect them, too. Misako was an actress I had never heard of before, but Natsune starred in the live adaption of Ranma (half) so I had heard of her. Both girls did not disappoint in their rolls as the best friends and I found their rolls refreshing and of course, loved the Girl Power performance that reminded me of my own high school days‚Ä¶\n\nI thought I‚Äôd lastly mention Mirei Kiriani, who played the ‚Äúmean girl‚Äù Ume Kurumizawa, who was in Kazahaya‚Äôs middle school. She does an excellent job, first as coming across as a nice girl who just wants to make friends and is misunderstood, then later as the nasty b*tch who sets out to isolate Sawako. I loved her. I say this all the time but if a ‚Äúnasty‚Äù character makes you want to reach through the screen and throttle them, then they are doing their job well ‚Äì and she did it well üòâ I was almost booking a plane ticked to Japan to hunt her down xD (Ofc i‚Äôd never actually do that‚Ä¶)\n\nAs well as these actors played their rolls, however, I felt that they were honestly just huge walking embodiments of high school drama stereotypes. Sawako is your typical shy, timid and misunderstood girl who keeps to herself, but wants friends desperately. She‚Äôs socially awkward yet somehow makes friends of the popular crowd, I.E Kazehaya, who is handsome, kind, well liked and therefore popular and likes her without any kind of reasoning. Her friend; Chizura was the typical tough girl who loves sports and is friendly with guys but wants to be feminine in front of the guy she likes. Ayane as the fashionable, pretty girl who is considered a slut out of jealousy by the other girls, but is really a nice person.\n\nIt all seemed so‚Ä¶ Clich√©, and the so called ‚Äòlove‚Äô between the two leads was just so forced. There was no chemistry and it was a mystery, to me at least, what even brought them together. If you‚Äôve read the Manga (oh, here we go haha) you will see lots of small instances and occasions which show the pair growing closer. Since this movie tried to concentrate more on them just being together, rather than the HOW, they missed all of this out, so rather than being showed a growing relationship, it was more of a ‚Äúhe likes her, deal with it.‚Äù Sort of thing.\n\nThe pacing of the whole thing was awful as well. Now, those of you who have read the Manga (and she‚Äôs at it again /shot/) will know that it has a very slow pacing, but honestly, a mMnga can get away with it whereas movies cannot. The first half DRAGGED and with the abrupt scene transactions, the whole thing seemed‚Ä¶ Sloppy. Some scenes seemed rushed (which is a shame, because they were always vital ones!) whilst other, less important scenes dragged for ages. This is a long film at 128 mins, and it could have been cut down to at least 100 mins I think, and be a lot better (or be kept the same length with the boring scenes cut and the actually interesting ones expanded on and fleshed out.)\n\nHowever, despite all my negative comments, it wasn‚Äôt a painful watch. Although slow moving and having little chemistry between the two main leads, it was still a nice, sweet watch. It showed typical high school themes of friendship, love, bullying and acceptance whilst following the story of a girl who has been avoided all her life, and is now beginning to emerge from her shell. It was cute, light-hearted and filled with lots of smile worthy moments (and adorable character smiles).\n\nBut like I said, if you an older viewer, you may find this a little‚Ä¶ Tiresome, to watch. It really is aimed at a younger audience and if you‚Äôre planning to watch, I suggest shutting down your logical thinking brain a little first, since it‚Äôs not something to watch whilst questioning, or else you‚Äôll end up (like me) becoming irritated at some of the relationships and situations. Enjoy it for it‚Äôs cuteness, and you‚Äôll do fine.\n\nTLDR: If you like a romance which shows development and reasoning, this isn‚Äôt for you. If you like cute movies without any real plot substance‚Ä¶ This IS for you.\n\nPK Rating:\n\n(3) / (5)\n\nA cute, light-hearted watch, but nothing deep and moving. Easily forgettable.~\n\nYou might also like:\n\n‚Äì Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge (2010) ‚Äî A Japanese series (based on a Manga) about a scary looking girls moves into her aunts house, where she meets four good looking guys tasked with turning her into a lady. The closest match really to Kimi Ni Todoke in terms of a scary looking girl who is secretly kind, and who falls in love with a hot guy haha. Based on the manga ‚ÄòWallflower‚Äô it‚Äôs a great watch and is very funny.\n\n‚Äì Lovely Complex (2006) ‚Äî Although this certainly doesn‚Äôt follow the same themes, it does show a girl who has issues with how she looks and shows how she grows to accept those complex‚Äôs she has. I wrote a review, here. Check it out ^^\n\nExtra:\n\nI‚Äôd like to share the theme song, which is by a band called Fumpool. I loved this song üôÇ\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuD2ccchswg ‚Äì Kimi Ni Todoke theme by Fumpool.\n\n[[August 26, 2013 at 1:51 pm edited. Word count: 1839]]"
