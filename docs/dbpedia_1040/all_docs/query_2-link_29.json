        "text": "Arianna Dagnino in her essay Transcultural Literature and Contemporary World Literature points out that “with the denationalizing wave of globalization, even national literatures are under pressure to find new arrangements of form and content to adapt to a changed cultural and social paradigm. In other words, a mutation is under way within the global acumen of letters where new notions of belonging, as well as definitions of selfhood and identity are externalized through new creative artistic and literary processes. Within this emerging social, cultural, and literary scenario, scholars feel the urge to identify new relevant literary paradigms, especially when dealing with the so-called \"New Literatures in English\" represented by the works of, say, Zadie Smith, Hanif Kureishi, Kamila Shamsie, Michael Ondaatje, or Joy Nozomi Kogawa” or recently through Anime with its heavy borrowing of motifs from western canonised literature and its gradual popularity as an emerging form of literary creativity. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, anime is \"a style of animation originating in Japan that is characterized by stark colorful graphics depicting vibrant characters in action-filled plots often with fantastic or futuristic themes.\" While Oxford Dictionary dictates anime as \"A style of Japanese film and television animation, typically aimed at adults as well as children\", the Urban Dictionary explains anime as \"a style of animation that originated and is still heavily centered in Japan.\" However like any other art form, confining this art within just few words would be highly unjust. Still to provide a more technical approach, we can look forward to animenewsnetowrk.com's definition of anime, which perhaps shed more light on this complicated matter. According to them anime is \"Japanese word for cartoon and animation. In Japan, \"anime\" refers to any and all animation or cartoon - regardless of the genre, style, or nation of origin. Outside of Japan the word \"anime\" has come to refer specifically to animation of Japanese origins, or animation of a particular style...\" The vast world of anime has its roots embedded very deep inside light novels, manga, visual novels, games and much more, which altogether known as the ‘otaku culture’ in Japan. Japan’s existence as an island civilization, far separated geographically from the mainland of Asia has led to the development of its own distinct culture and Anime is a reflection of Japan’s own cultural heritage; far distinct from its pan-Asian counterpart. It can be said that anime is a high quality art form, a much ignored one though. But it is an art form of purest quality which have protected itself from the cultural imperialism and proved itself truthful to regional originality for almost a century. The growth and popularity of anime was quite evident since its origin. Anime first surfaced as propaganda feature films during World War II, later it fully bloomed in the hands of 'Godfather of Anime' Osamu Tezuka. Just like Walt Disney's works, it made strong appeal to children. However later the plots and arts became more oriented towards the young-adults too. Certainly it paved anime's way towards a constant growth. As researchomatic.com states “... However, the familiarity of anime and manga is not restricted to the adolescents; but, it has been successful in attracting adults over a period of time...” Another reason for its growth could be its intricate character detailing and building, to which the audience can easily relate themselves and emphasize. One must not ignore the metaphysical aspects of anime too, as a Quora user Sawyer Cotherman points out “People watching a live-action show relate the show's universal metaphysics more to our own universe (reality). In an animation, we do not relate the metaphysical laws in its universe to our own as much and we are more ready to accept what is posited, therefore, we may concentrate on the other aspects which an animation presents: the relationships which characters have between one another, the human virtues, justice, ambition, and other human qualities of life.\" And perhaps this strong harmony of metaphysics and escapism which has provided anime this alluring enigma throughout the ages. Though it is true that anime and serious literature have always been hostile towards each other, however with the coming of the new century new hope arises as more liberal minds are considering different arts as part of literature, such as music and painitings. One can hope in near future anime shall be considered as a serious art form too. To state that fact the Otaku stereotype was a prevalent theme in almost every literary work from the literature review. While very little of the western canonized literature has been adapted into anime, yet some of the exceptional and remarkable works are, Howl's Moving Castle, Romeo × Juliet, Agatha Christie no Meitantei Poirot to Marple, The Story of Cinderella, Jungle Book Shōnen Mowgli, The Secret World of Arrietty , Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo , World Masterpiece Theater, Tales from Earthsea, Nils no Fushigi na Tabi, Blast of Tempest, Takarajima, Tokyo Godfathers, Pandora Hearts or Miyuki-chan in Wonderland. However, it seems that the negativity toward Otaku culture progressively lessened as the articles approached modern times. There is still a slight negative stigma to anime, despite attempts to educate people on the nature of anime, and people still believe anime to be a violent art form (Borrelli, 2002). Acceptance of Otaku culture and the anime wave has become more acceptable, however, as more scholarly research is conducted and more libraries stock anime (Halsall, 2010).” (Samantha Nicole Inëz Chambers, Anime: From Cult Following to Pop Culture Phenomenon)."
