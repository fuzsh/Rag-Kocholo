Chizuru's childhood friend and Shōta's best friend.\n\nTaciturn, according to Chizuru, he is either sleeping, eating, or playing baseball. He says his strength is his patience. He has a poor ability to express emotions, and is often considered difficult to understand by those around him. He also has a very hard time remembering people's names.\n\nHe has been a regular member of the baseball team since his first year, batting fourth and playing as a catcher.\n\nHe has had feelings for Chizuru, who he has grown up with like siblings, since they were children, and is the only character who calls her \"Chizuru.\" He knew she did not see him as a romantic interest, but during the school trip, he wanted to step beyond their \"siblings\" and \"childhood friends\" relationship and confessed his feelings to her.\n\nIn his third year, he became the captain of the baseball team and devoted himself to practice aiming for the national high school baseball championship at Koshien, but they were defeated in the semifinals of the qualifiers. Afterwards, it was decided that he would go to a university in Sapporo on a sports recommendation. He promises to become a family with Chizuru when he returns.\n\nHis motto is \"Actions speak louder than words.\"\n\n(Recently Edited: K K )\n\n(Last edited time: Aug. 13, 2024, 6:17 p.m.)\n\n(View edit history)\n\nVoice Actor\n\nEdit\n\nFeatured Anime\n\nOther Characters\n\nView All\n\nAniBase.Net\n\nFor data accuracy, this feature requires you to log in.\n\nLog in with Google account"
