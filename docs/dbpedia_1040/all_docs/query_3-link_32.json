        "text": "And so I am back, posting again on the same day as my last, puny post, with my first real post in four years but…\n\nIt is a post from 10 years ago that I never published! This draft has been setting in my site, waiting to see the light of day for ten years.\n\nSo here it is, ten years late.\n\nAnd yes, I will be posting something new THIS YEAR, sooner than later. Stay Tuned!\n\nAugust 2014\n\nI recently had a trip to Kobe. It was the first time I had visited there since 1995, one month before the Great Hanshin earthquake.\n\nIn December of 2014, when I was living in Kochi city, I went to Kobe to take the Japanese Language Proficiency test level 2 (and I passed). Little did I know that one month later, the great earthquake would hit. As I watched the news about the earthquake on my television, I was horrified to see the destruction of places I had just visited, including the Sannomiya Center Street.\n\nAfter 1995, when I moved back to Texas, I visited Japan several times, and have also lived there twice (including now). During all of those summer and fall visits, and also a period of living here for two years from 2007 – 2009, I never once visited Kobe again, even though it is one of my favorite cities in Japan.\n\nSo now after moving to Japan for the third time, I finally made it back to Kobe. This time it was for my summer, or Obon, vacation.\n\nWhy is Kobe one of my favorite cities? I like kobe because it is situated between mountains and the sea. Visually, it is a beautiful place. I also like the people of Kobe. They have the straight forward characteristics of people from Kansai, but also have a unique Kobe charm of kindness and Hospitality.\n\nMy dates of travel were from August 14th to August 16th. I was given August 13th – August 17th off, and I chose to go one day after the summer travel rush started, and come back to Tokyo one day before the end of the vacation period to avoid some of the travel congestion. Even though I avoided the heaviest traffic days, it was still pretty hectic. I used the Tokkaido Shinkansen, or bullet train, for my travel to and from Kobe. For my lodging, I used my own companies’ service, Rakuten Travel. I was able to book a nice room with a queen bed at the Kobe Motomachi Tokyu Bizfort hotel. It was the first time that I had used my own companies’ service, and it was fun.\n\nMy hotel was located right next to Kobe’s China town, also known as Nanking Matchi. I was never around the area when I was actually hungry, so I didn’t eat any of the good morsels there, but it was fun to walk through it a few times for sight seeing.\n\nOn my first day in Kobe, I visited the Merikin Park in the harbor. There, I found the Memorial for the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake. I felt a connection to it, since I was in Kobe before it hit, and also I felt the seismic waves myself.\n\nThen after that, I had two more good days in this nice city. I went to a nice bar owned and run by a nice lady. I ate Kobe Beef at a local restaurant. I visited the husband of my friend I met in Dallas, but they moved back to Japan. My friend wasn’t available, so I had dinner with her husband, whom I also knew.\n\nI also took a walk around the port. Overall, it was a great trip!\n\nLA Sunset during stopover on the way back to Japan\n\nI recently left Japan and came back by following the new immigration rules established on 8/28/2020.\n\nI was glad to be able to visit my American family and then come back to my Japanese family safely and smoothly.\n\nThe new rules allow foreign nationals residing in Japan to re-enter as long as they have residence status, have a re-entry permit, and follow the new procedures.\n\nBefore these new rules, foreign nationals residing in Japan could not re-enter Japan if they visited a country on the entry-blocking list.\n\nThe Country I went to was my home country of America, and it is on the list of blocked nations currently.\n\nSummary of new Procedures\n\nAgree to comply with quarantine measures and additional epidemic prevention control measures\n\nSend an email request of intention to re-enter Japan to the Immigration Services Agency of Japan.\n\nGet an email receipt from the Immigration Services Agency of Japan that approves your re-entry\n\nPresent your email receipt to Immigration officers when you depart Japan\n\nTake a Covid-19 test in the destination country 72 hours before returning to Japan and get a doctor’s signature on a Japan Immigration supplied test result form.\n\nPresent the email receipt and negative test Covid-19 test results to the immigration agent when returning to Japan.\n\nThe above is a summary of the official process that can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.moj.go.jp/content/001327551.pdf\n\nThe original Japanese version is here:\n\nhttp://www.moj.go.jp/nyuukokukanri/kouhou/nyuukokukanri07_00245.html\n\n#Note: the above is only my summary to act as an overview and cannot be used as the official process. Follow the information in the above two links for the official process.\n\nExperience of following the Procedures\n\nI prepared the email required to request the re-entry, and I got a response in less than 24 hours. The instructions say that responses may take up to 3 days or so, so I was lucky to get a quick response. I added a note in my email request that my travel was for the purpose of a serious family issue back in the United States, and it is possible they may have helped me by expediting the response after seeing my purpose for travel.\n\nAfter getting tickets, on the day of travel to the US, I needed to show my email-receipt and non-filled in Covid-19 test form to the airline agent before they let me board the plane in Japan.\n\nBack in the States, it was a challenge to find a place to get tested that would fill in my Covid-19 test form with a Doctor’s signature, and also get tested with results in the 72 hours window.\n\nI made many phone calls, and went to one place that said the rapid antigen test that they offered was probably not the kind of antigen test that Japan Immigration required, so they referred me to another place that did Rapid PCR testing. This place also filled in my form, signed it and it was free. In case you are an Expat from Texas that wants to go there and come back to Japan, I can recommend https://www.facebook.com/heal360frisco/. They tested efficiently in time, and a doctor personally took care of me by filling-in the form and sending it to me in time. Also, they are a free service.\n\nOn my way back to Japan, I was surprised to find out that I needed to go through Covid-19 testing again upon arrival. I thought that only Japanese nationals had to do that since they are not required to get the test overseas. But I took the saliva Covid-19 test in Haneda airport along with everyone else.\n\nThe flight I took to Japan wasn’t crowded at all, so I got results in about 40 minutes compared to the 2 or 3 hours they said it might take. The testing in Haneda was very organized and efficient, so that part was good.\n\nOnly after getting a negative result on the Saliva test could we go to immigration, where I showed them my immigration approval card (from the saliva test) along with my re-entry email, and filled-in US side Covid-19 test results.\n\nAfter showing them all of these documents, the immigration officer unlocked the inspection both exit door (this was new) and let me in.\n\nSo in the end, I could smoothly travel to the US and back again following the newest procedure. I am thankful that the Japanese government made these new rules so that I could see my US family in a timely manner.\n\nIt is both better than and not as good as what George Lucas could make\n\nI have been a huge fan of Star Wars since May 28, 1977, the day my parents first took me and my little brother to see “A New Hope” at the big Northpark General Cinema theatre in Dallas Texas. Yes, me and millions of other people.\n\nSo as a big fan of Star Wars, of course, I was waiting with great anticipation to see “The Force Awakens” on opening day Dec 18, 2015. I watched the trailers over and over again, studying each frame to see the new characters and settings. December 18th didn’t seem like it could come fast enough.\n\nFinally the day came, and my fiancé and I saw it in one of the first IMAX showings in Tokyo. It was worth the wait, and the film lived up to the hype. It was thrilling to see the old characters, the new, and the many great sci-fi action sequences.\n\nAs the credits rolled, I felt happy and delighted. But after exiting the theatre, I got a sense that something was missing from the movie.\n\nWhy “The Force Awakens” is not as good as what George Lucas could Make\n\nAbrams can make a great action movie. He has proved it with “Mission Impossible 3”, “Star Trek 1” and “Star Trek 2”, and “Super 8”. He works great with actors, and is really good at creating atmosphere and intrigue for action and sci-fi movies.\n\nHis handling of “The Force Awakens” was masterful. He was able to blend the original characters with the new, and keep the fast pace of editing and motion that Star Wars movies are known for. It really “felt” like a Star Wars movie, even though George Lucas was barely, it at all, involved.\n\nBut a few things are missing from “The Force Awakens” for me. These are a sense of grand visions and fairy tales, and mysteries that Lucas brought to the original six films. With the release of every single Star Wars movie that Lucas has made, there was always something new and eye-opening to bring feelings of awe, inspiration, and wonder.\n\nThe story and settings of “The Force Awakens” did not convey this sense of awe and wonder for me.\n\nIn some ways, it seems like a remake of episode IV. This by definition signifies a lack of originality. The film has a droid with secret information hunted by Imperials. The final battle takes place at a Death Star. These are all things we have seen before.\n\nAlso, where was the mystery of the force? It was mentioned and used by the characters, but it seemed like some kind of mutant power that the characters innately had, and not a mystical and majestic energy field.\n\nI can understand that Rey is strong in the Force, but how could she possible perform the Jedi mind trick and wield a light sabre in a way to defeat the expert Kylo Ren? In all of the other Star Wars films and TV shows, there was always a mentor figure that taught others how to use the Force. Max Katana seems like she fit the role as a Force mentor, but she was only telling the characters things out of a kind of knowledge, and not showing them anything.\n\nAdditionally, there were no new and exciting planets, like we got in every one of the 6 original films. Planets like the swamp world of Dagoba, the beehive-like mountainous Genosis, and the giant sink hole riddled Utapau to name a few. Each one of Lucas films showed us totally different planets that we have never seen before.\n\nThe Force Awakens gives us two green forest like planets with Takodana and D’Qar. We have seen Tatooine in 5 of the original films. There is nothing special about another desert world in Jakku.\n\nWe get an Ice planet (probably Ilum) which is similar to Hoth. That is it! Four planets that are not new.\n\nAdditionally, the scale of the locations on the planets seems much smaller. Nima outpost on Jakku was puny. I understand that it fits the story, but it doesn’t lend to the Space Opera style of the other movies, like Mos Eisley does on Tatooine.\n\nGranted, The cantina scene on Takodana was filled with many new characters that were very well done, even better done than the original one in Episode 4, but it is only one part of the planet, and we don’t get a sense that the planet is very big.\n\nThe “alien marketplace” designs in the “Art of The Force Awakens” seem much more interesting than what we got in this film.\n\nAlso, compare the Resistance Bunker on D’Qar to the original Rebel Base on Yavin IV in Episode 4. The Resistance base has an airfield with seemingly not enough ships on it, and a bunker operations center, that seems claustrophobic, even smaller than the headquarters in the ice mountains of Hoth. The Rebel Base in Episode 4 and a feeling of scale, of it being a large indoor hanger inside a huge temple complex, but the base on D’Qar didn’t.\n\nI guess part of the plan with the new Trilogy is to start smaller like Episode 4, then build up to bigger locales and conflicts like the original trilogy did. Maybe this is the reason “The Force Awakens” feels too small for me.\n\nBesides the locations and scale of the film, one of the things I always looked forward to in new Star Wars movies was totally new designs of everything, from space ships, speeders, robots, creatures, buildings etc.\n\nThe Force Awakens seems to have less new designs. Many of the visual items in the film are redesigns of classic ones. X-wings fighters, Tie Fighters, and Storm Troopers look almost the same as they did before.\n\nIn terms of new spaceships, the new designs for Han and Chewie’s freighter, as well as Leah’s troop carrier really don’t look cool and inspiring at all. Kylo Ren’s shuttle was very cool looking, but it was still very derived from Darth Vader’s shuttle from Episode 6.\n\nGranted, there are some totally new designs in “The Force Awakens”, and these were refreshing. The new Star Destroyer does look cool. The Jakku junkyard was appealing visually, and the new design of a rounder and smaller BB-8 was delightful and cute. But these things weren’t enough to instil deep feelings of wonder and awe in me. Just medium shallow feelings.\n\nSo for these reasons above, “The Force Awakens” feels like it doesn’t fit with the other films. It doesn’t feel like an Episode VII to me, more like Episode 1 of a redesigned franchise (like Abrams did with Star Trek).\n\nBut having said all of the above, I still loved the film, and look forward to more instalments.\n\nWhy “The Force Awakens” is better than what George Lucas could make\n\nMany criticised the prequel episodes I – III as not having the personal charm of the original Star Wars. Trilogy. I agree with this. The characters of Obi-Wan, Padme, and Anakin were fun to watch, but were never as compelling as the original trio of Han, Leia, and Luke.\n\nPoe, Rey, and Finn are wonderfully compelling and fun new characters. Abrams did a good job here, and I am sure this is one of the reasons ”The Force Awakens” is doing so well at the box office. George couldn’t make these kinds of characters in the Prequels.\n\nI especially think that Rey is awesome. She is wonderfully portrayed by Ridley Daisy. She is a complex and likeable character. To see her pilot the Millennium Falcon brought chills down my spine in the way that it totally represented the blending of the old and the new. She is also the first strong Force using lead female character shown in the films, and this is refreshing and inspiring.\n\nFinn was also an excellent new character. He is a new kind, a warrior without necessarily having Force powers. John Boyega’s performance was fresh and magic. His chemistry with Rey was fun to watch. His fierce drive and lively energy did bring a new freshness to the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe character of Kylo Ren was also delightful. He is following a reverse Jedi path, trying to resist the temptations of the light side. This is new and very interesting. His sword is the coolest thing since Darth Maul’s double blade. His voice is also really cool.\n\nOscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron was also well done. Right away with his first meeting of Kylo Ren, he exhibits class and humour in a Star Wars kind of cocky way that was thrilling to watch. It is also neat to see a genius pilot that is not a Force user… or is he?\n\nI also liked the new Storm Troopers. They seemed more dangerous and skilful than the ones in the original films with their nazi like cruelty and more militaristic manner.\n\nSo, as proved in “The Force Awakens”, Abrams strengths lie with characters, action, and pacing. He excelled at creating excellent chemistry between the characters and in displaying their unique characteristics. These elements did bring a newness and freshness to the Star Wars universe that was lacking in the prequels.\n\nSo in the end, Abrams is better with characters and situations, and Lucas is better at visuals. Too bad they couldn’t have co-directed, and then we would have had the perfect Star Wars.\n\nDrinking in Japan\n\nOne of my hobbies is drinking. I like to drink for the taste, not necessarily for the buzz. Like coffee, I only drink quality items. I am picky with my beans, and I am also picky with my booze.\n\nI typically like to drink spirits straight, or with a little bit of water, or on the rocks. I love martinis, margaritas, and whiskey.\n\nBefore moving to Japan for the third time in 2007, I mostly drank beer, wine, martinis and margaritas.\n\nThis all changed after I settled in Tokyo for the Third-time.\n\nIn the US, as well as in Japan, I mostly drink socially. When living in the US, I also occasionally drank at home mixing my own perfect martini recipe. In the US, social occasions were not as common it seems as in Japan.\n\nIn the US, you need to be careful when going out after driving to the restaurant or bar. You have to pace yourself and not get too drumk, lest you have to give the barkeep your keys and take a taxi home.\n\nIn Japan, i find myself drinking way more than in the US for two reasons.\n\nThere are more social drinking occasions stemming from work and friends.\n\nIn Tokyo, you can take trains and don’t have to worry about driving home drunk.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have seen many Japanese drink more than they can handle because they don’t limit themselves for the drive home. Sometimes you see professionals in nice suits and dresses parked in the corner of a train platform while trying to discreetly retch their over indulgences.\n\nBeing an American, and also being one to drink more for pleasure and not to get drunk, I find I do have the skill to not overindulge (usually).\n\nSo, how did my drinking style change after getting to Japan?\n\nThe biggest difference as I mentioned above is the frequent social drinking in Japan. They call these occasions, “nomikai”, or “drinking parties”, and they are a blast. Japanese culture is group oriented, and this is very evident during nomikais. They usually take place at “izakayas”, or Japanese style tappas bars/pubs.\n\nMany times, the seating in izakayas are in traditional Japanese rooms with tatami floors. Othertimes, they take place around long family style tables at restaurants, or at izakayas with western style seating. This type of seating goes along with the Japanese style of group conversation, as opposed to the two or three person conversions at stand up bars in the US.\n\nFamily-style eating is the standard way to order at izakayas. Items on the menu include japanese or japanese-western style tapas or appetizers that everyone can share. All you can drink plans are common to go along with the family style eating.\n\nThese all you can drink plans usually go for about $30 US. it does seem a bit expensive, but when you remember you can drink as much as you can handle without worrying about driving home, it is a great way to unwind, have fun with friends, and get your fill of tasty drinks.\n\nAfter going to several of these events, I started to realize how differently Japanese drink compared to me. Beer and wine is common enough, but the wine is served in tiny glass, and the red wine is often chilled. You have to specify room temperature for reds if you want to drink them that way.\n\nThe beer on the other hand is sold in tall glass mugs ice cold. After a hard day of work or after sports, it is very refreshing!\n\nBesides beer and wine, I was intrigued to see how Japanese handle spirits. They almost never drink them straight (except for sake), and usually mix them with one or more non-alcoholic beverages.\n\nOut of these, it seems to me the two most popular kinds are “Highballs” and “Sours”.\n\nHighballs\n\n“Highballs” are just like the western equivalent, which are defined as a spirit mixed with a larger portion of non-alcoholic beverage in a tall glass.\n\nBut this is where the similarity ends. “Highballs” usually mean only “whiskey” + “some form of carbonated beverage”. And the carbonated beverage is usually soda water.\n\nOut of “highballs”, the most common type is “Suntory Kakubin” whiskey with soda. This is type of highball is sometimes called “Kaku-high” as well. “Kakubin” means “square bottle” and it is Suntory’s most popular brand of whiskey . The bottle is made of square glass with beveled “scales” on it, thus the naming “kakubin”. It is brilliant marketing as the bottle and naming is very distinctive.\n\nThe photo at the top of this posting shows a high-ball in a large tumbler with a very popular food paring: Japanese friend chicken or “kara-age”.\n\nIf Japanese order a different form of highball from the standard, they call it something else.\n\nFor example “Ginger High” is whiskey and ginger ale.\n\nBesides “Highballs”, Japense also drink a category of mixed drink called a “Sour”. This is also known as “Chu-Hai”, which is short for “shochu higball”. Shochu is a form of native Japanese vodka made from potato or wheat. Sours are usually served in izakayas or restaurants, and “chu-hais” are usually sold as canned beverages, but the ingredients are the same.\n\nSours\n\nSours are similar to the western style of sour cocktail in that they are often a spirit mixed with a sour type of juice, like lemon or lime, and soda.\n\nThe similarity ends here, because Japanese sours usually do not use sweet mixers, and the base spirit is usually shochu and not gin or whiskey.\n\nThey also look different, in that they are served many times in large glass mugs or tumblers instead of half-highball glasses.\n\nThere is a large variety of mixers for Japanese sours including various sweet juices as wells as sour ones, but usually not together\n\nThe most common fruit mixers seem to be lemon juice, lime juice, grapefruit juice, or plum syrup.\n\nBesides juices, sours also can be mixed with teas, as in green tea and ulong tea. In the case of these varieties, no soda is added.\n\nThere is also another type of sour that you mix yourself called a “Hoppy Set”.\n\n“Hoppy is a type of non-alcoholic malt beverage. A bottle of it (you can choose light or dark) is pared with a glass of shochu on ice.\n\nYou pour in the hoppy yourself. Since the bottle of hoppy can fill more than one glass of shochu and ice, you can order more shochu called “naka” to put back into the mix after you finish the first glass of a hoppy set.\n\nThe other day, I saw a variation of a “hoppy set” sold with “cola” instead. This was called a “cola sour”. This is illustrated by the photo below.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nDrinking in izakayas is a great way to relax. The different types of highballs or sours are nice drinks to go with lively conversation.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in Japan and you are over 21, I highly recommend trying many varieties of Highballs and Sours.\n\nBelow, I will summarize what Highballs and Sours are, as the names and types tend to blur together.\n\nUntil my next blog, have fun and drink responsibly!\n\nJapense Mixed Drinks: Highballs and Sours Reference\n\nHighballs\n\nSprits:\n\nSuntory Kaku-hai\n\nSuntory Torys\n\nNikka clear\n\nNikka black\n\nNon aloholic Mix-ins\n\nSoda water\n\nGinger ale\n\nGarnish\n\nLemons\n\nLimes\n\nSours\n\nSpirits list\n\nShochu\n\nVodka\n\nUmeshu\n\nTypical Mix-ins\n\nGrapefruit juice\n\nLemon Juice\n\nLime Juice\n\nGreen tea\n\nshequasar (lemon from Okinawa)\n\nPlum syrup\n\nUlong tea\n\nThe above are the common mix-ins for the highball sour type of cocktails.\n\nSweet Mix-ins\n\nApple\n\nGrapes\n\nPears\n\nStrawberry\n\nPineapples\n\nMore\n\nNon-juice Mix-ins\n\nSoda\n\nGreen tea\n\nUlong tea\n\nHoppy\n\nCola\n\nMitsuwa Cider\n\nSparkling Calpico\n\nGANTZ Live Action Movie Review Part II\n\nIt has taken me a little while to get back to my blog, but here is part 2.\n\nThe quality of the film was very good. It was obvious that this was a D-Cinema presentation, the current standard for digital projection.\n\nSpoilers ahead…\n\nThe story opens with Ninomiya’s “Kei” character standing on a crowded sub way station that I was actually familiar with. It was one of the stations on the Rinkai or Bay-Coast train line which I have ridden many times when I lived in Tokyo. In fact, the station looked very similar to the Oimachi station that I used most often, but I wasn’t sure if that was it, since I didn’t recognize the train destinations listed on the electronic train info displays. Who knows, maybe they changed the train destinations to match the managa or something.\n\nThe film progressed through the train accident death scene, to the GANTZ apartment introduction, and then the first “Alien Eradication” mission for the Onion-head aliens. After the first three scenes, it was obvious that the screenplay was taken from the manga/anime, as the story progression is the same.\n\nOne thing that was interesting for me to note was that the violence seemed less extreme than the anime version, and there was no nudity or sex scene either, although nudity was highly suggested when the girl Kishimoto first appears, slowly being “assembled” by laser beams from GANTZ while dripping wet and naked from the bath she was summoned from.\n\nI supposed this is fitting, since the anime and manage versions have over the top violence, nudity, and sex and seem to be aimed for a hard-core adult otaku crowd, while the film is aimed for more general audiences.\n\nAfter the Onion-head episode, the story progresses to the first interlude back in the “real world” where Kei gets to know Kishimoto (played by the currently popular young acctress Natsuna Watanabe) better, and we find out about Katou’s living with his little brother.\n\nAfter the first interlude, we go to the Suzuki alien robot episode, a life-size action figure-like robot with a funny-looking 50’s style asian face, followed by another real-life interlude, and then the climatic great buddhas episode, where giant buddhist statues at a temple come to live, terrorize the GANTZ warriors, and bleed exploding foam when damaged by the high-tech GANTZ distruptors.\n\nOverall, the three leading actors did a good job as the main characters, and the English dubbing was pretty good, but I would have preferred if they spoke Japanese so I could hear the native voices of the actors.\n\nI was mostly satisfied with the film version of the GANTZ, as I enjoyed seeing a live action version with popular Japanese actors running around with fully realized power suites and futuristic weapons. It had pretty decent special effects, and it was also need to see the GANTZ ball too, with a real bald and muscular guy inside.\n\nBut think I still prefer the anime version.\n\nThe film version seemed to mimic the anime-style tension device of having characters panic to the point of barely fighting, or not fighting at all, even though they poses incredibly powerful weapons. It works with anime voice acting and illustration, but seeing live actors stutter and limp around seemed silly, and it also greatly slowed down the actions scenes.\n\nEven the real life interlude scenes seemed to move slow with stilted dialogue. Perhaps the Japanese voice track would be better.\n\nIt was cool to see photo-realistic buddha enemies, but the temple setting seemed less impressive than the anime version, which was more stylized and fantastic looking.\n\nThe movie credits were followed by an epilogue, where the supposedly dead Katou is seen in a crowded rainy scene.\n\nThe Epilogue was followed by previews for the sequel movie due out in April.\n\nFolowing this, we were returned to the live feed from Hollywood. Matsuyama and Ninomiya once again came to the stage and offered lively answers to Patrick Macias’s questions.\n\nAt one point, Macias joked about the possibility of GANTZ being nominated for an Academy Award as it was being shown in Hollywood. He bemused about the possibility of Matsuyma and Ninomiya winning Oscars.\n\nFor the Q & A session, Matsuyama and Ninomiya spoke only in Japanese. The English translation provided by two bi-lingual guys standing behind them was adequate, but a few important points were missed. It must of have been challenging for these guys to interpret to a live audience as well as to 330 theaters across the US, especially when Matsuyama was speaking at length without pause for translation.\n\nAt one point, Matsuyama and Ninomiya mentioned that they hope this screening of GANTZ can encourage more in-roads to Japanese cineima beyond historical pieces like The Last Samurai and Memoirs of a Geisha.\n\nOne thing I think that Matsuyama said that was not translated was that the live-action part 2 movie will have new material different from the Manga or Anime versions. I hope the original screenplay for it is good, but I don’t have much expectation for it. I have experience watching manga-based anime episodes (Naruto!) that present brand-new stories completely separate from the manga story arcs. They are usually not nearly as interesting as the episodes based on manga stories.\n\nAfter the interviews, the Fathom Event came to an end, and it was time to go home.\n\nOver all, I enjoyed the Fathom experience of a live-event and film, and will probably try out another Fathom event soon… maybe I will check out a Met Opera showing….\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nFor more information, please see the following links.\n\nActors Information\n\nhttp://wiki.d-addicts.com/Watanabe_Natsuna\n\nhttp://wiki.d-addicts.com/Matsuyama_Kenichi\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsuyama_Kenichi\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazunari_Ninomiya\n\nGANTZ Anime\n\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3641\n\nLast week I had a chance to see the US premier of the GANTZ live action movie via satellite broadcast courtesy of Fathom Events.\n\nThis is part one of a two-blog post series. This post covers general information about Fathom Events, as well as describing the pre-show leading up to the main event, and the live event introduction.\n\nThis was my first Fathom Events experience and I very much enjoyed it. I liked watching a live event in HD on a large screen. The movie was fun to watch, even though it was English dubbed (not my favorite), and it was neat to see the two main actors in a live broadcast as well.\n\nFor those that are not familiar about Fathom Events, they happen at movie theaters around the US and are venues for live programming via satellite. A good example of a typical type of Fathom Event: Live New York Metropolitan Opera performances can be seen at Fathom Events, without having to actually be there.\n\nInterestingly enough, I was considering going to an Anime related Fathom event in 2009, and then I was going to make it my first blog. The event was the movie version of Eureka Seven (English dubbed) followed by live commentary and QA by the English voice actors. Too bad I missed it.\n\nNow, a year and four months later, I finally got to a Fathom Event, and my plans of writing a blog post about it have finally materialized.\n\nThe GANTZ event I went to had 4 segments: A pre-show, a live introduction from the Mann Chinese theater in Hollywood, the HD presentation of the film with English dubbing and a Q&A session following the film with the two male lead actors Kenichi Matsuyama and Kazunari Ninomiya.\n\nBefore this event, I was already familiar with the GANTZ franchise after renting the first season of the GANTZ anime DVDs from Netflix several years ago.\n\nWhen I found out about the Fathom Events GANTZ live action showing, I became excited at the chance to see the movie in the US.\n\nSegment 1 was the pre-show, which I only saw about half-of since I arrived 15min before the main event.\n\nThe pre-show was well done and featured Fathom commercials, and information about the upcoming events. I thought the quality of this pre-show was better than FirstLook, the pre-show that runs before regular films at some movie theaters. Incidentally, the parent company of Fathom Events is also the parent company for FirstLook: NCM Media Network. (NCM stands for National CineMedia).\n\nCompared to what I am used to with FirstLook, The Fathom pre-show seemed slower paced and less “spastic” in that the transition between each segment was calmer, more focused, and there were only commercials related to Fathom Events.\n\nThe pre-show ended with a transition to a full-screen title for the GANTZ “World Premier”. This full-screen title (full-quality HD image) then faded-in to a live video feed of the actual movie theater screen at the Mann Chinese theater, and a small stage in front of that. Soon after the fade-in, Patrick Macias, Editor in Chief of Otaku USA magazine, came to the stage wearing a dark blazer, and aGANTZ t-shirt. He made a spirited introduction to the film, gave the obligatory “no photos” warnings with a cool otaku-twist, and then welcomed the actors Matsuyama and Ninomiya to the stage.\n\nI have been familiar with Matsuyama’s work since about 2007, when I saw him on the Japanese comedy/drama TV show “Sexy Voice and Robo”. I will write a blog about his work that I am familiar with later on.\n\nThe comments from the two stars started out with Ninomiya, from the popular J-Pop group Arashi, giving some brief introduction and welcoming comments all in English. Matsuyama also gave some comments in English. Both speeches were charming and admirable considering neither of them can speak English fluently.\n\nAfter the introduction, the screen faded back into the full screen GANTZ title, then the TOEI Film corporation animated logo came to the screen.\n\nEnd part one.\n\nWatch for part-two of this blog series soon.\n\nFor more information, please see the following links.\n\nEureka Seven Fathom Event\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=950898853963\n\nhttp://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/BrentSprecher/news/?a=9798\n\nGantz Information\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantz\n\nhttp://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/47679/gantz-live-action/\n\nI am a big Neon Genesis Evangelion fan, and I was very excited to find out that the second re-imaged film “Evangelion 2.0: You Can (Not) Advance” was released in US theaters this weekend. I happened to catch the news on the Otaku USA News page. The nearest showing to me was in Southlake TX, a suburb of Ft. Worth.\n\nI have been lucky enough to have already seen this film. I saw it during its original theatrical release in the summer of 2009 in Yokohama Japan.\n\nEven though I have seen the Evangelion 2.0 film already, I wanted to show my support to the US theatrical market by going this weekend. Plus I thought it would be cool to see it again on the big screen. Actually, it was a double-feature with “Evangelion 1.0: You are (Not) Alone” playing before it, which I also saw the original release for in 2007 in Japan.\n\nI am not planning to write a review here. For that, see a link at the bottom of this post. Needless to say I greatly enjoyed seeing “Evangelion 1.0” and especially “Evangelion 2.0” in Japan and got excited at a another chance to see these movies on the big screen this weekend.\n\nSo with great anticipation, I made my way to the Harkins Southlake theater this morning.\n\nWhen I first entered the theater, I choose a seat in the 5th row from the front, and then I looked up to the projection booth. I was VERY disappointed when I noticed a “portable” digital projector sitting in front of the regular projector in the projection booth. I got a sinking feeling that I wouldn’t get main-stream theater quality today, and I didn’t.\n\nWhen the movie started my hunch was realized, and I could see the individual pixels. This immediately took me out of my “suspension of disbelief” as I was preoccupied by the little squares on the screen. Not only that, but the screen image didn’t fill the whole screen, and it was considerably dimmer than a regular movie theater digital projector would be. I am not sure, maybe it was just the fault of the projector they used.\n\nSo for today, Evangelion 1.0 and 2.0 were both shown from a Blu Ray player connected to a portable projector. At 1920 x 1080p, Blu Ray is great for home, but it doesn’t scale-up well to the movie theater experience, where the standard is full-screen 2048 x 1080 pixel resolution or twice that.\n\nAfter the the first fight scene of Eva 1.0, I moved back to the middle of the theater, and could no longer see the individual pixels, so I could then relax and start to enjoy the films. But today’s presentation still was not as nice as seeing the regular full-screen cinema releases in Japan.\n\nI wonder what the theaters in other parts of the country are showing for Eva 2.0?\n\nI get the impression that Funimation is getting a license to publicly show the Blu Rays that they sell themselves, but they either can’t afford, or are not trying to get either the 35mm, or D-Cinema versions of the films they are showing in the DFW area.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed seeing these two films again today, and it was nice seeing them on a big screen, but I hope future such releases by Funimation (or another licensee) can show these films at full-screen, D-Cinema quality.\n\nRelated links:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_(anime)\n\nhttp://www.otakuusamagazine.com/Main/Home.aspx\n\nhttp://www.funimation.com/evangelion/\n\nhttp://www.otaku2.com/articleView.php?item=427\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema\n\nThis past weekend, I had a chance to see the Russian circus performance Artania at South Fork Ranch outside of Dallas Texas. I didn’t know what to expect before I got there, but I was pleasantly surprised. The show is a sort of Cirque du Soleil meets traditional Russian horse riding.\n\nThe show’s imagery is based upon a legendary Russian kingdom with the same name. The costumes, lighting, and music were all very well done, and matched the mythical kingdom feel. The trampoline and circus wheel acrobatics were excellent, as were two segments of exotic dancing. There were also very entertaining clown segments, and a fancy ring tossing act.\n\nThe main attractions though, were those acts that involved the beautiful horses with names like Audi, Gegemon, Napoleon and Ronald.\n\nTowards the beginning of the show, a beautiful queen-like character (shown in the picture) danced with an equally beautiful blonde horse. Other horse-centric acts involved caped men with elaborate horse-like head dresses riding on the backs of two horses each, and a polo-like fur tossing and catching routine.\n\nBut by far, the most memorable horse sequence was the grand-finale, where eight or so horses ridden by barbarian warrior types raced around the ring, then split up into groups of two with each rider performing signature tricks like leaning upside down over the side of the swiftly moving horses , doing flips while standing on them, or hoping on and off the horses very quickly.\n\nProbably the most impressive horse trick was when a rider “crawled” around a horse’s mid section, completing a loop about the horse, all while the equine creature was rocketing around the circle.\n\nAccording to the website and show program, these horse tricks originate from North Ossetia Russia. In 1947, a circus performer Alibek Kantemirov broke off on his own, and together with his sons, created a troupe of horse riders performing special equine tricks that appeared in Soviet cinema. The horse tricks performed and perfected by Alibek and his family later featured in circus acts through the world.\n\nFast forward to 1994 and Mairbek Kantemirov, grandson of the founder Alibek, has updated the show to become a modern circus that has performed in Europe, Canada, and now the US.\n\nEarlier this year, the Artania troupe came to Texas, first starting in Houston, then making its way to Dallas. However, according to the Royse City Herald Banner, the promoter that was working with with the performers abandoned them after Mr. Kantemirov refused to sell the entire circus act to him. Legal and financial problems ensued, and it seems that Kantemirov Productions was taken advantage of and left high and dry with no money.\n\nFlash forward to now, and the Artania crew has been able to get back into the ring by securing a long-playing run at South Fork Ranch.\n\nThe promotional materials for the show were designed and produced by my friend Jonathan Caustrita, creator of Tiki Coladas from Purple Box Studios. I think he did a great job capturing the mystery and excitement for the South Fork run.\n\nThe show runs until Halloween, and I wish the troupe the best!"
