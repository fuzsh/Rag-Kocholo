        "text": "In Gantz, the movie version of the manga with the same name, people that should be dead are not. Instead they are teleported into a room with a mysterious black sphere known as \"Gantz\". There, \"players\" are forced into a game of hunting aliens through timed tasks.\n\nChildhood friends Kei Kurono (Kazunari Ninomiya) and Kato Masaru (Kenichi Matsuyama), and others, most notably Kishimoto (Natsuna Watanabe), are forced into this brutal game of survival of the fittest.\n\nAfter each round, players are awarded points and Gantz comments on their performance. Players who accumulate 100 points can either be released from the game or can revive a previously eliminated character. New players come in as quickly as those that are eliminated.\n\nThe continual cycle of new players makes this a great concept for a printed manga series. However, for a film, the opposite is true. The last thing we want is to see is our favourite characters eliminated. We lose interest once our favourites have gone. What's more, characters and relationships never develop.\n\nThose hoping for a faithful adaptation of the comic books will find this straying too far from the original. And, for first-timers, too much seems to be left unexplained.\n\nAt its highest points the film is engaging enough; sadly, those moments are too few."
