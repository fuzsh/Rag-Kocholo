        "text": "An exhilarating and entertaining comedy about a bizarre plan to steal a large sum of money from people consumed by desire.\n\nThe main character, Dahko (Nagasawa Masami), is a confidence woman whose age and real identity are unknown. She is a woman prone to making silly mistakes and with a soft spot for money, fashion and food. She resides in the suite of a luxury hotel in Tokyo, where she spends her days and nights crafting elaborate frauds. Her partners in crime are serious and dedicated young confidence man Bokuchan (Higashide Masahiro) and battle-hardened veteran confidence man Richard (Kohinata Fumiyo). The team of three resorts to any means necessary to steal money from money-mad unscrupulous company bosses and Mafia dons. Watching them cheating and be cheated, sometimes even deceived by their friends, and wonder what tricks they will use next in order to take money from their targets..And so, an unpredictable game of deception begins.\n\nA human drama set in a nursing school that focuses on the lifestyles of each of the four female students.\n\nOn the day of the nursing school entrance ceremony, as the other new students were solemnly listening to the speeches, Kizaki Rumi (Shinkawa Yua) was staring off into space. Rumi did not particularly want to be a nurse, and was only there to satisfy her mother, who told her to get her qualifications for financial reasons.\n\nAt practicum, Rumi was put in a group with the clumsy Chika, the housewife Saeki, and the law school graduate Tono. Tono had actually enrolled at nursing school in order to get revenge on a doctor who had killed her sister due to a medical error.\n\nRumi spends three years with them, sometimes helping each other and sometimes clashing with each other, and the various experiences Rumi has makes her grow, and she falls in love for the first time with Takumi, a medical student. A delicate love triangle emerges with Shunya, who Chika has a crush on. During the practicum, they are confronted with the lives of patients they meet, and learn that nursing means to become the person closest to the patient. But sometimes the hospital does not allow them to do so. Under such contradictory circumstances, how will Rumi and the others choose to live their lives?\n\n“You have the right to quit this company.”\n\nAn unconventional human resources consultant is about to expose the darkness of the company! No evil can escape this beautiful-but-ruthless dark heroine in red stilettos.\n\nHuman resources consultant Tsubaki Mako (Nanao) has been dubbed the “devil of human resources” for her iron-fisted ways. She struts her way into a well-established firm and tackles sexual harassment, power harassment, bitter rivalries between factions, and monstrous employees, all of which are issues that can strike any company, with her extreme methods. Mako is like a devil who solves problems with her bold tactics. This is a refreshingly zany office drama for children and adults alike!\n\nWork or romance, it’s always an uphill battle. Yet nothing gets this neophyte prosecutor down. This zany workplace drama is sure to perk you up!\n\nMain character Takemura Ririko (Yoshitaka Yuriko) just entered her second year of work at the Yokohama Public Prosecutors Office. The eldest daughter of a tofu shop owner in downtown Tokyo, she is 29 years old and lives with her parents. Ririko is still a novice and quite clumsy all around, but she gives 100% to everything that comes her way. Your image of a “prosecutor” might be that of a perfect person, but Ririko is a character full of human flaws. She is inflexible and a vocal champion of justice, but she also laughs, cries, and readily expresses her joy and anger. Ririko is certainly the type anybody would want to root for.\n\nIt goes without saying that the job of a prosecutor is an enormous responsibility. On top of that, there are convicts who underestimate women simply because of their gender, which makes the profession even more emotionally challenging. As if her career isn’t already tough enough, everything in Ririko’s life seems to be hanging by a thread. Her boyfriend is pushing her to choose between marriage and work, her father might be having an affair, and there’s a chance one of her suspects was charged on false accusations. But as she solves one crime and one personal problem after another, Ririko matures as a prosecutor and a woman.\n\nAs she tackles every case head-on without giving up despite the worries and pains that come with being a prosecutor, Ririko will inspire women the world over to wake up to a new day with optimism and strength.\n\nIt has been 10 years since the serial drama “BOYS OVER FLOWERS” took Japan by storm and concluded its story in the movie “BOYS OVER FLOWERS the movie”. Based on the comic, “BOYS OVER FLOWERS SEASON 2”, a new chapter to “BOYS OVER FLOWERS,” this new drama brings viewers a youthful love story of a new generation of characters who each possesses a “secret”. Hana Sugisaki stars in a serial drama for the first time alongside a promising cast of young actors.\n\nTen years have passed since Makino Tsukushi and Domyoji’s F4 graduated from Eitoku Academy – a once prestigious school which is now suffering a decline in funding and student enrollment. Oto (Sugisaki Hana) attends Eitoku Academy but is secretly just a “commoner” who is struggling financially due to the bankruptcy of her father’s company. She is afraid her secret will be disclosed if she becomes the target of “commoner hunting” which Kaguragi Haruto’s (Hirano Sho) C5 is doing to maintain the school’s dignity. Meanwhile, Momonozono Academy where Hase Tenma (Nakagawa Taishi) serves as student council president, is quickly catching up to Eitoku Academy as a result of Tenma’s achievements. Tenma and Oto are in fact engaged to one another and are to be married, but only on the condition that Oto attends Eitoku Academy until she turns 18.\n\nThis drama brings viewers a thrilling love story of two married couples who struggle with everyday trials and tribulations, which is said to resonate with many people for its realistic depiction of issues that often arise in a marriage.\n\nSato Mayumi (Nakatani Miki) has been married to Hideaki (Tamaki Hiroshi) for 13 years and they have a teenage daughter, Reina (Sakurada Hiyori). Raising Reina has become easier over the years, but Mayumi and Hideaki simply cannot afford the expenses of putting Reina through a private junior high school. Mayumi therefore decides to return to work for the first time in over 10 years to help out with the household finances, but becomes frustrated at Hideaki’s lack of cooperation. The Nasuda family – Taro (Santamaria Yusuke) , Ayako (Kimura Tae) and their son, Shingo (Hagiwara Riku) – live all together with Taro’s parents. Ayako is a devoted wife who never complains despite the behavior of her domineering husband. One day, Ayako and Taro visit Hideaki’s housing company’s model home. Hideaki feels an instant attraction to Ayako, who is a contrasting type of woman to his wife, Mayumi.\n\nHaruta Soichi (Tanaka Kei) is 33-years-old, single and works at a real estate office. He wants to get married, but he isn’t popular with women. Soichi has a comfortable life living with his parents. One day, his mother kicks him out of their house and tells him to become independent. Soichi has a hard time living alone. He doesn’t know how to do simple things like how to cook or how todo laundry. He begins to live with Maki Ryota (Hayashi Kento). Ryota was sent from the head office to work at the real estate office where Soichi Haruta works. Unlike Soichi, Ryota is good at cooking and cleaning.\n\nMeanwhile, Soichi’s senior at work, Kurosawa Musashi (Yoshida Kotaro) is gay and confesses his feelings for him. Ryota also tells Soichi that he has feelings for him. Soichi is totally straight and his peaceful days is completely ruined.\n\nThe Ninth Unit of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department’s First Investigative Division led by Kano Rintaro solved difficult cases through teamwork. But the members were disbanded and went their separate ways after Rintaro was deployed to the Cabinet’s Counter-Terrorism Office. However, after one year, the police commissioner (Satomi Kotaro) orders the formation of an independent investigation team to swiftly crack cases from the initial investigation to turning over suspects to the public prosecutor’s office. And so, Asawa Naoki (Inohara Yoshihiko), Komiyama Shiho (Hada Michiko), Murase Kengo (Tsuda Kanji) and other former members of the Ninth Unit get back together. The new leader of this investigation unit is Munakata Sakutaro (Terao Akira), a man of many mysteries, who worked in the personnel division but retired several years ago due to some incident. He has returned to the police force after persuasion from the police commissioner. Even his reinstatement has been kept under wraps for some reason.\n\nAfter waking up from a month-long coma due to injuries sustained in a reckless, heated investigation, detective Yashiro Tomo (Haru) quickly returns to work at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. She is ordered to transfer from the First Investigative Division’s Violent Crimes Unit to the Sixth Special Investigations Unit. Located in the basement, it is in charge of deciphering documents of unsolved cases. Despite Tomo’s bewilderment, she begins work in her new post along with a brusque senior detective Narumi Risa (Suzuki Kyoka) who is called the expert of document deciphering for her unusual ability to predict the personality and thoughts of a writer from writings. However, the reality is that this kind of work is nothing more than that of a “storekeeper” of investigation materials.."
