Here comes a teaser for the new movie directed by Ken Ochiai, based upon the manga series \"Tiger Mask\" by Ikki Kajiwara. The film has attracted a lively cast however, including the likes of Eiji Wentz (Kitaro and the Millennium Curse), Natsuna (Gantz), and Shô Aikawa (Dead or Alive). The Tiger Mask persona is instantly recognisable by its trademark mask, designed to look like a tiger's head, as well as the combination of high flying attacks and martial arts in the wrestling ring. This will be the third movie based on the manga, the first two arriving in the 1970s, though the Tiger Mask persona has continued to appear in wrestling arenas since that time. The Tiger Mask opens its cape and its doors sometime in November 2013. The teaser trailer doesn't give much away but it will certainly do for now.\n\nAs previously reported, Tiger Mask (タイガーマスク) follows lead Eiji Wentz (Brave Story) as Naoto Date, a character that gets mixed up in a shading wrestling operation and then breaks rank to oppose their forced acquisition of an orphanage.

This new interpretation focuses on lead hero Naota Date, who fights in opposition to an evil wrestling organization and to save a children's orphanage. Date was actually at one time a member of the evil organization, Tora no Ana, before setting down the path to become a hero. The original manga ran from 1968 to 1971 in such publications as Weekly Shōnen Magazine while the anime aired in 1969. Many real-life Japanese wrestlers have donned the 'Tiger Mask' persona over the years. The manga recently became popular again in Japan after a mysterious donation was made a few years back to a children's organization which sparked others to contribute in what became known as \"The Tiger Mask\" movement.\n\nPut a dead body in a small apartment, lock up a young woman on a bed, and set a young man free to investigate a murder -- but only within the same small apartment. That appears to be the premise for Captivity Detective. the literally-translated English title of Kankin Tantei, according to Nippon Cinema. Based on a manga by Abiko Takemaru, the film stars Miura Takahiro and Natsuna as a couple of strangers who wind up in the same apartment where a murder has been committed. The young man suspects the young woman of the crime, so he ties her to a bed while he decides to investigate, but she has some detective skills of her own, or so she claims.

In a nutshell - big black balls. Gantz and its sequel Gantz: Perfect Answer are based on a hit manga series created by Hiroya Oku. Directed by Shinsuke Sato, Gantz stars leading Japanese actors Kazunari Ninomiya (Letters from Iwo Jima) and Kenichi Matsuyama (Death Note, Detroit Metal City). After an accident on a train platform, recently deceased childhood friends Kei and Kato find themselves transported to an empty apartment populated by several confused strangers and a mysterious black ball known as Gantz. The big black ball issues them a set of strange suits, instructing them to exterminate \"dangerous aliens\" from Earth in a series of bloodthirsty games. They are given high-tech weaponry, and the opportunity to collect points depending on how many aliens they kill.\n\nOne of the biggest and most eagerly awaited Japanese blockbusters for some time arrives in the form of the explosive science fiction thriller “Gantz”, adapted from Oku Hiroya’s ongoing manga. Having already made it to the small screen as a cult hit anime, which controversially had to be censored during its original airing due to graphic content, the live action version sees director Sato Shinsuke (“Sands’ Chronicle”) taking the reins, with a script from Watanabe Yusuke, who previously worked on the sprawling “20th Century Boys” adaptation. Split into two parts, with this first instalment being followed by “Gantz: Perfect Answer”, the films are slick, big budget affairs with an impressive youth-friendly cast headed by Arashi boy band member Ninomiya Kazunari (also in “The Lady Shogun and her Men”) and popular actor Matsuyama Kenichi (known for the “Death Note” series, and who recently starred in “Norwegian wood”), with female eye...\n\nThe Gantz: Part II: Perfect Answer Movie Trailer has premiered. Shinsuke Sato‘s Gantz: Part II: Perfect Answer (2011) stars Kazunari Ninomiya, Kenichi Matsuyama, Kanata Hongô, Natsuna Watanabe, and Yuriko Yoshitaka. Gantz: Part II: Perfect Answer‘s plot synopsis: Part II continues were Part I left off where “after trying to rescue a man on the subway tracks, two teens wake up in a room dominated by a mysterious black sphere that sends them to hunt down and kill aliens hiding on Earth”. We previously posted the Gantz (2011) Movie Trailer for Part One. The movie trailer starts out slowly but then the action kicks in around the half way point. I wish there were english subtitles for this movie trailer but the viewer gets the feeling that there is internal strife in the protagonist’s group.\n\nMore about this sequel:\n\nIn the sequel (which was preceded, of course,...\n\nOn Saturday, the official website for Shinsuke Sato‘s upcoming 2-part live-action adaptation of Gantz was updated with a new 90-second theatrical trailer as well as a second teaser.\n\nThe films are based on Hiroya Oku’s long-running manga about two students who die in a train accident only to be brought back to life by a mysterious black sphere called Gantz. The pair, played by Kazunari Ninomiya of the pop group Arashi and actor Kenichi Matsuyama, receive enhancement suits which give them the superhuman abilities needed to complete a series of alien assassination missions. Through these missions they earn “points” toward buying their own freedom, but various incidents complicate matters along the way.\n\nOther announced cast members include Yuriko Yoshitaka as Tae Kojima, Kanata Hongo as Joichiro Nishi, Natsuna (formerly Natsuna Watanabe) as Kei Kishimoto and Takayuki Yamada as Shigeta Masamitsu.\n\nToho will be releasing Part 1 (Zenpen) on January 29th.\n\nHere is what I'm assuming is the latest preview for the upcoming 2-part live-action adaptation of Hiroya Oku's Gantz and the closest thing to a genuine trailer that's been released so far. Mercifully, this one is completely free of morning show graphics, talking head reaction boxes, and chatty announcer voices yapping over the best parts.\n\nThe films star Kazunari Ninomiya as as Kei Kurono and Kenichi Matsuyama as Masaru Kato, two college students who die in a train accident only to be brought back to life by a mysterious black sphere known as Gantz. Equipped with advanced weaponry and special suits that give them superhuman abilities, they're forced to carry out alien assassination missions, earning \"points\" toward eventually buying their freedom. However, various incidents along the way complicate matters. Additional cast members include Yuriko Yoshitaka as Kurono's girlfriend Tae Kojima, Kanata Hongo as a young veteran of the Gantz world named Joichiro Nishi,...\n\n[Update: Added an extended footage clip.]\n\nSome actual footage broadcast from a Japanese entertainment news show for Shinsuke Sato's upcoming two-part live-action adaptation of Gantz has been uploaded on Youtube. Also, there is a promo clip with a behind-the-scenes shots from the set and a preview at the several Gantz participants. Here's the official synopsis via Ntv:\n\nCollege student Kei Kurono (Kazunari Ninomiya) witnesses his childhood friend Masaru Kato (Kenichi Matsuyama) attempting to help a drunk who has fallen onto the subway train tracks and spontaneously jumps in to help him. However, both are run down by the oncoming train...\n\nIn the next instant, they are transported to a strange apartment with others who should also be dead. In the center of the living room is an enigmatic black orb known as 'Gantz'.\n\nGantz enlists each of them on a mission to hunt down and exterminate 'aliens', providing them with fighting suits and weapons.\n\nIs..."
