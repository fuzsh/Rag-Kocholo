        "text": "Takanori Nishikawa, the 40-year-old actor better known for his singing career under the name T.M. Revolution, will have his first starring role in a live-action television series this spring with a remake of the manga-based show Okusama wa 18-sai (My Wife Is 18 Years Old). Miyoko Motomura’s original shōjo manga revolved around the secret marriage between a Japanese-language teacher (Nishikawa) and a female high school student. 21-year-old Natsuna Watanabe, the actress best known for her role in the first Gantz film, will play the student.\n\nThe new four-episode series will premiere on March 27 on Fuji TV’s CS satellite channel. Shooting for the series began on February 1.\n\nThe original Okusama wa 18-sai manga ran in Shueisha’s Weekly Margaret magazine from 1969 to 1970. The first live-action romantic comedy series based on the manga aired for one year starting in September of 1970. The late actor Tetsuo Ishidate and the actress Yuki Okazaki starred in that first live-action version, which garnered a top rating of 31.1%\n\nSankeiSports\n\nAnimenewsnetwork"
