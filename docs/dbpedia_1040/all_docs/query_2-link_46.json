        "text": "I actually bought this one at random before I bought ‚ÄúKimi ga Suki‚Äù and didn‚Äôt realize they were by the same author. I really like the cover on this one, even though it is yet another one of those random ‚Äúclose-up of a girl‚Äôs face‚Äù covers. She is cute üòÄ The bright yellow is eye-catching. I like this author‚Äôs art style inside the book as well. This is the first volume of a series. The story reminds me a lot of ‚ÄúKoukou Debut‚Äù and in fact, they even declare at the beginning that the heroine is having her ‚ÄúHigh School Debut‚Äù but even with the similarities, this is a cute series.\n\nKASHIWAGI Nene is determined that her high school days will be different and exciting, and normal. Back in junior high, she was a member of the volleyball team, and was not very fashionable. She has never had a boyfriend, and thinks getting one would be nice. Now in high school, she has started using make-up and has a nice hairstyle, and is ready to be a normal high school student. The only thing making her life a bit difficult is her friend from junior high, ENDOU Jun. Jun is an ‚ÄúIkemen‚Äù or, a really good looking guy, but as far as Nene is concerned, he is her nemesis. They always tease and argue with each other. However, in spite of their fighting, they are good friends.\n\nWhen Nene finally lands herself a date, Jun is the one who helps her get ready for it. He happily cheers her on, and makes her feel more confident. When something disastrous happens, and the date goes poorly, Jun is also there to comfort her and convince her that she really is not as horrible and ugly as she seems to think. This nice, supportive side to Jun slowly makes Nene think she might be falling for him‚Ä¶\n\nHowever, Jun obviously does not feel the same way about her. Even though he is her good friend, and does care a lot about her, his heart obviously still belongs to a girl named Izumi. Izumi had been Jun‚Äôs first love back in Elementary school, and he had done something amazingly stupid, and drove her away. He has always regretted it. When he encounters Izumi again in high school, it is painfully obvious to Nene that his feelings for Izumi never faded, and he is in love with her.\n\nWith Jun so very head-over-heels for Izumi, Nene‚Äôs heart aches. But what can Nene do, but cheer on Jun as he plans to confess his feelings to Izumi? He was so supportive of her, as his friend she must return the favor, no matter how painful it is. But how does Izumi feel?"
