        "text": "Whoever said it was easy to confess your feelings to the person you like obviously hasn't seen Kimi ni Todoke the movie... or the anime... or even read the manga. I swear, if I was as oblivious about love like Sawako, I'd just save myself the trouble and enter a nunnery! Just kidding... or am I?\n\nSo I finished watching the movie a couple of hours ago but I'll be re-watching just to make sure I liked it not only because of the favorable reviews I'd read before I watched it. I mean, I'm sure that's not what happened... but you never know. Anyway, before I re-watch, this is what I thought the first time around. Btw, I'll be screen-capping like crazy so if you don't want to be spoiled, now would be a great time to look away :)\n\nThe Plot\n\nI think the plot is one of the things that's unique about the movie. For once, we don't have the plucky, boisterous heroine who melts the heart of the icey dude with a heart of gold. For once, the heroine's the one who's ... not cold exactly but kind of reserved and closed off. Sadly, it's through no fault of hers. Sawako, in an attempt to please the people around her, acts the way they think she acts which is totally how they think she should act. This, of course, makes her isolated and cut off from everyone else. Long story short, the movie is about how her interactions with Kazehaya opens up a new world with includes friends and people to talk to. A world she has always wanted to enter but had been denied entrance due to her appearance and reticence. Wow, I sound kind of good, if I do say so myself :)\n\nThe Characters and Actors\n\nHaving not even heard about the movie until recently, I wasn't particularly invested in the casting part of the movie so I don't have any misgivings about any of the actors. That said, after reading the manga and watching season one of the anime, I do have a picture of what I would have liked Sawako to look like. However, all my preconceived ideas about how she was supposed to look shattered when I watched the movie.\n\nTabe Mikako as Kuronuma Sawako\n\nDoesn't she look scary?\n\nHere are other pics where she looks much better, more pretty, more non-scary\n\nShe looks really pretty!\n\nWhat can I say? She's a perfect Sawako. I read somewhere that her eyes make her shine as Sawako. I agree. She's good with her eyes. I loved her scenes with Miura Haruma. I can buy that they liked each other. I don't know if it's the character or the actress I like. I love Sawako but it could be I liked her more because she was portrayed by Mikako, who I also liked in Yasuko to Kenji so I'm guessing I like the actress.\n\nMiura Haruma as Kazehaya Shota\n\nCuteness ^^\n\nWhat the hell, here's another one ...or two...or three\n\n(Help! Stop me!)\n\nIt's no secret that I'm a fan of Miura Haruma but I think in this case, his portrayal of Kazehaya has made me slightly obsessed with him. Slightly, I said. Don't write me off as a rabid fan just yet. I wish I had a Kazehaya as my boyfriend(I'm dreaming, I know, but don't wake me up). He's handsome, outgoing and popular, nice to even the \"little people\" (I mean the unpopular people not, you know, little people), he's very single minded when it comes to love, he's just... ideal. Usually, I'm a bit wary of those kind of people, the people who seem perfect on the surface, but (maybe because Miura Haruma portrays him so well?) I can see a person like Kazehaya existing in real life.\n\nNatsuna Watanabe as Yano Ayano\n\nSophisticated and worldly, I think Natsuna captured Ayano incredibly well and even though her character wasn't delved into in depth in the movie, I still feel like anyone who has no knowledge of the manga can understand who she was supposed to be. And isn't that all we really ask for from an adaptation? I haven't ever seen the actress in anything before but if I do, I'll remember her turn as Ayano and watch whatever it is.\n\nRenbutsu Misako as Yoshida Chizuru\n\nIt took me a while to realize that I knew this actress. I'd seen her in the jdorama Nanase Futatabi which I reviewed here earlier this month. But it's not all my fault that it took me that long to recognize her. Her character in Nanase Futatabi and the character of Chizuru are very different. I'm thinking I like her portrayal of Chizuru best. Chizuru , in my opinion, is slightly less dense than Sawako but has the single mindedness of Kazehaya. Misako is very good at bringing alive Chizuru's tom-boyishness and sensitivity in a way that doesn't make her seem like a mess. The scene with her crush and his fiancee broke my heart even though I've seen it in both the manga and the anime. I was a bit disappointed that the scene with Ryu afterward didn't happen in the movie. But I understand. Too much info, too little time.\n\nAoyama Haru as Sanada Ryu\n\nHe had too little screen time, IMHO, and I would have loved to see more of his scenes. Especially the ones with Chizuru. I've never come across this actor so I can't say much about whether or not he's a good actor in general. I do know that he portrayed Ryu very well and his scene with Kazehaya towards the end just about made me start shipping them.\n\nKiritani Mirei as Ume \"Kurumi\" Kurumizawa\n\nFor a third party in a relationship, I didn't really hate her. And that's saying a lot about both the character and the actress. I was so prepared to hate her on principle until I saw one of the scenes during the ending credits (you know the one if you've watched it!) But even before that, I admire her in a totally you-were-kind-of-annoying-till-you-redee med-yourself way. She's a woman who knows when she's lost and how to back off elegantly, unlike some third parties in the drama world. And I think the actress did well in making me feel that way about the character.\n\nWhat I Liked\n\nIf it's still not very clear, I loved the movie! I loved the plot, the actors, the acting, everything. I loved that it's about the different types of love. There's love for friends, love for classmates, and romantic love. It's not a choice between friendship and love. It's the sense that love can grow through friendship and vise versa. The last jmovie I watched that made me feel anything was Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac (does that count as a jmovie anyway?) and it left me a bit depressed afterwards even though it didn't end badly . I'm through with bittersweet movies and Kimi ni Todoke fills my needs for sweet and lovable.\n\nThese caps summarize the whole movie...\n\nThe Friendships\n\nThe Love\n\nI mean, seriously. The guy you like asks you to go out with him. Your answer: \"But today I have an urgent matter.\" Really, Sawako, Really?!\n\nWhat's Iffy\n\nI don't have any big issues with the movie since I liked the whole thing... but I do feel a little disappointed that not everything from the manga was used. I know it's totally unrealistic for that to happen but I can't help my feelings. Sorry :{\n\nOther than that, there's nothing offensive or hinky about the movie :}\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nI'm not going to lie or pretend that I know what constitutes a \"great\" production. All I know (or care about, really) is how it makes me feel or how much enjoyment I got from it and for those purposes Kimi ni Todoke delivered spectacularly. Keep in mind that it is based on a shoujo manga so don't anticipate any hardcore plot or action scenes. If you've never read the manga or watched the anime, just take it as it's meant to be taken: a light, refreshing story about love. If you have watched or read any of its predecessors, remember that not all adaptations are this good. Just saying."
