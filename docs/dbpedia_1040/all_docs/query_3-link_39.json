        "text": "Teenage high school student Kei Kurono is waiting for a subway train home when he recognizes an old childhood friend Masaru Kato on the same platform. Suddenly, a drunken commuter falls on the tracks just as the station’s speaker system announces the approach of a non-stopping express train. Kato immediately goes to the man’s assistance but struggles to lift him to safety on his own. Reluctantly, Kurono joins him and they manage to save the man but are unable to get clear of the oncoming train, which hits them and kills them instantly. A split second later, Kurono and Kato find themselves in a bare room in an unfurnished apartment containing several strangers and a large, black spherical object. They quickly discover that all the people in the room have recently died and been instantly resurrected by the mysterious sphere. But their second chance at life comes at a price. To remain alive, those chosen must follow the sphere’s instructions in seeking out and destroying numerous bizarre alien life forms secretly inhabiting the earth. But what it the origin of the sphere, how is it able to restore life to the dead and what does it want...?\n\nGantz (2011) is based on the manga series by Hiroya Oku, which also spawned a 26-episode anime series produced by Gonzo. For those that loved the anime then this is a fairly faithful adaptation of the story, but without any nudity - which may come as a disappointment to teenagers across the globe.\n\nThe effects are impressive and the tricky comedy is well handled - the robot fight sequence is particularly amusing. But this won't be to everyone's taste. However, if you enjoyed the manga and anime this is well worth checking out.\n\nExtras include The Making of Gantz (18 min, 01 sec worth of raw behind the scene footage with very little in the way of explanation); Interviews (28 min, 09 sec cast and crew interviews which plays as one long feature); 3 Teaser Trailers; 2 Trailers; and 3 TV Spots.\n\n7\n\nDarren Rea"
