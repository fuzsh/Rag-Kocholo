Sounds nice but the two have a love hate relationship – specifically, she hates boys. Things get even worse after Ranma falls into a magical spring named The Spring of the Drowned Girl whilst training at a cursed training ground in China. As a result of that mishap he now changes into a cute red haired girl (Natsuna Watanabe) whenever cold water is splashed on him and requires warm water to revert back to being male. Just as bad is the fact that his father Genma (Arata Furuta) also fell into a spring and now changes into a panda bear. The two must find a secret spring that can cure their curse if they are to resume their lives but the female Ranma gains a series of admirers.\n\nNTV’s adaptation of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½ stars Kenta Kaku who was in the recent live-action Paradise Kiss film as the male Ranma.\n\nranma-otoko by Mercury Rex, on Flickr\n\nNatsuna Watanabe, who played Kei Kishmoto in the live-action version of Gantz, is the female version.\n\nranma-onna by Mercury Rex, on Flickr\n\nThe series is set to air on the 9th of December.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.animenewsnetwork.co.uk/news/2011-11-23/live-action-ranma-tv-special-1st-ad-aired\">Source</a>\n\nvashdaman said:\n\nYeah. I posted this in the news thread recently. It looks pretty jokes. And after seeing that trailer I thought \"Damn, I really wish somebody would let these guys make the Akira movie\".\n\nAlthough the trailer looks bad I must admit that after watching the live-action Arakawa Under the Bridge I'm willing to watch this show and other television adaptations of manga with an open mind. However I don't think an Akira movie would be within their grasp (or budget)."
