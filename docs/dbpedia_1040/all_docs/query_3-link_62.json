        "text": "“Meishi Game” is a Japanese drama which I expected to have more horror components than it does have. Even though it’s part of the “Death Game” genre, I’d describe it as a psychological drama. Read on if you’d like to find out more. There aren’t any story spoilers, but I do discuss the male lead which will reveal some information about this drama.\n\nStory\n\nTV producer Tatsuya Kanda (Shinichi Tsutsumi) awakes in a cage. He doesn’t know where he is and how he got here. When he looks around, he discovers that there is another person in the room with a cloth on their face. That’s when suddenly the TV screens in front of him turn on. He sees snippets of his popular quiz program until the screen changes to a man he has never seen before. He introduces himself as Mr. X (Masaki Okada). Mr. X starts to explain to him that he is going to be the participant in his ‘Meishi Game’. Kanda is not willing to play some weird game, until Mr. X reveals that the other person in the room, is his daughter, Mina (Karen Otomo).\n\nTo show what will happen to her if he doesn’t oblige, Mr. X activates the necklace around the neck of a doll. The exact same necklace which Kanda and his daughter are wearing. The head explodes off of the doll. Kanda stares at the leftovers in horror. Mr. X proceeds by throwing a bunch of business cards in Kanda’s cage. The screens activate again. There are three people in three separate rooms. Kanda has to find the right business card to each of them. If he makes a mistake his daughter will die. If he can’t find the business card within two hours, his daughter will die. Or he can activate a button in the corner of the room to save her. But that will activate the necklace around his neck and kill him. Kanda accepts the game. He has to save his daughter. The “Meishi Game” is about to start.\n\nThoughts\n\nI had a bit of trouble binging this. Which had nothing to do with the acting or the story? Both were superb. Well, it did have to do with the story, but not because it had plot holes or was uninteresting. It was so intense, I felt physically sick. And I don’t mean the death game. “Meishi Game” is not really bloody or gruesome. It is more gruesome on a human level I’d say? Kanda is a despicable human. Transformed from a shy and caring father by power into an extorting and manipulative man who is only looking out for himself. And he totally deserves to be in that cage. He deserves punishment. As he is our main character the focus does lie on him, but we’ve got to be fair here. There are a lot of other shitty humans in this story, who are only interested in getting the best piece of the cake. If it’s the woman who only looks for a wealthy man and thinks the chubby owner of a bento delivery service is the ideal mark. She can still put him on a diet to change him to her liking, can’t she? Or the touchy-feely manager who disregards completely that his advances are unwanted by his female co-worker.\n\nSexual harassment and female exploitation are a red thread throughout the whole story. Maybe that is another reason why I had so much trouble to watch it in one go. Because those two topics felt like too much of a mirror of the real world to me. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t live in a candy cotton packed world. Nor do I only watch movies where everyone is holding hands while dancing and singing in a circle. But I went in with another expectation for this drama. You know, blood, gore, screams. Just, mindless horror. And not a look into the abyss of the depraved human mind which “Meishi Game” offered. But I think it also speaks for this drama that it affected me as deeply as it did. Even though I had to take breaks in between, I was still looking forward to the next episode. The next chapter of Kanda’s shameful behavior. And awaiting his ultimate punishment.\n\nWith this, I’m ending my review. I would definitely recommend this drama to you. Just don’t await a bloody slaughter-fest. And maybe you’ll experience it in another way than I did. You should let me know your thoughts then.\n\nIf you are interested in checking out “Meishi Game” for yourself, here is the trailer:"
