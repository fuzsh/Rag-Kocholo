Iruma personally inspects crime scenes to prevent a miscarriage of justice and bring the truth to light. Although his demeanour is far from the image of a stuffy judge, he is feared by lawyers as well as prosecutors because he is not bound by obligations, prejudices and preconceptions and has an inquiring mind. On the other hand, the judge Sakama Chizuru (Kuroki Haru) is the complete opposite of Iruma. A graduate of Tokyo University’s Faculty of Law, she is an elite among elites. She has been transferred to the First Criminal Investigations Department to reform it due to the unbelievably small number of cases that have been closed. This is the equivalent of a company in the red to the extent of going bankrupt. As someone who takes great pride in maintaining public order by handling cases accurately and promptly, Chizuru cannot understand Iruma’s style which frustrates her to no end. However, when she realises that Iruma believes in treating a case as an individual’s life, she is faced with the question, “What can a judge do aside from issuing a ruling?”\n\nWebsite: www.fujitv.co.jp/ichikei\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/ichikei_cx\n\nPreview: Ichikei no Karasu CM\n\nFM999 999 Women’s Songs\n\nDate: From 9.30 p.m., Mondays, 29 March – 7 June 2021\n\nNetwork: WOWOW\n\nEpisodes: 10\n\nScriptwriter: Nagahisa Makoto\n\nDirectors: Nakamura Takeshi, Okuma Kazuhiro\n\nCast: Yukawa Hina, Okabe Takashi, Kura Yuki, Tarako, Miyazawa Rie (guest star), Meiling (guest star), Ota Rina (guest star), Yashiro Aki (guest star), Motola Serena (guest star), Goto Mariko (guest star), Tomosaka Rie (guest star), Aoi Yamada (guest star), Miura Toko (guest star), Yuriyan Retriever (guest star),\n\nSynopsis: On her 16th birthday, high school student Koike Kiyomi (Yukawa Hina) is a mixture of anxiety and happiness.
