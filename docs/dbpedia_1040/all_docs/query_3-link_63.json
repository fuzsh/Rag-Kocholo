        "text": "The Gateway Drug\n\nGANTZ (2010)\n\nType `gantz manga’ into Google Images right now. Go ahead, I’ll be right here.\n\nYeah, right? What can I say?\n\nIt’s not uncommon for a Manga series to have a huge international following, but as you just saw, GANTZ’s creator Hiroya Oku is an artist that has fully delved into the depths of sexual and ultra-violent experimentation through artwork. You could also add his 2 other major successes, Zero One or HEN, to that Google search list, but suffice to say they’re all centered around creating works that ride western culture shock with extreme Japanese subcultures and forge a dedicated local readership.\n\nAfter pouring through a couple of issues of the GANTZ Manga series for what I initially called `research,’ it’s clear that Oku’s narratives and depictions hold true to the visual splendor and creative freedom that is part of Manga’s potential as a print medium. Over the years, digital Anime and live-action remakes have tried to engross more people in the same visually striking worlds that these artists have created. And it’s this idea of more people, more posers coming into that subculture that produces the perspective that the films aren’t the true form the stories are meant to take. As a result, they often don’t quite hit the mark as their R18 rated Manga origins do.\n\nComing from the same producers that had relative success with the Death Note (2006) live-action film, GANTZ has plenty of money and talent in bringing the Manga series closer to real-life; Kazunari Ninomiya leads the pack as Kei Kurono and there’s all the dramatic pauses and courageous, determined faces of a shy nobody turning into an accomplished combatant in the GANTZ blood-fest. Ken'ichi Matsuyama and Natsuna Watanabe are both kind of given the roles of token old best friend (Kato) and token love interest (Kishimoto) that are both designed to foster courage and loyalty in Kurono. Despite this, the seeds of teen perspectives of life and reasons for being are sewed right at the start of the film as Kurono is introduced just as another kid on his way to a job interview, rehearsing a big spiel about everyone having a place in the world that doesn’t ring true for him, just yet…\n\nGANTZ made more than 3 times it’s budget (7.4 billion yen from a 2.1 billion budget) which, by return on investment, actually makes GANTZ one of the success stories of live-action remakes. Speed Racer (2008) and Inital D (2005) couldn’t break budget and Death Note just broke even in 2006. The credit here should go to both screenplay writer Yûsuke Watanabe and director Shinsuke Sato who oversaw both the original and the sequel. Even if it can’t keep up with the sexual-explicit, ultra-violence of the Manga series, they managed to make a GANTZ live-action film that doesn’t suffer any real lulls in plot-drive or visual detail. Granted, some shots just lean that little too much on making props seem terrifying with intense zooms, but that’s a license to the ridiculous that live-actions have earned. Laughing out loud at GANTZ makes it closer to the hyper-reality of the Manga which spawned it.\n\nGANTZ is a live-action remake with balls, big ones, and it needs those balls to get as far away from that PG-13-ness, that need to make money that plagues so many other live-action films. Prudes are still going to shoot it down, but it does make an almost all-together insane universe reasonably accessible for the Manga novice and certainly sparked my interest in looking up more of Oku’s works. So GANTZ is both a gateway drug to hardcore Manga and a well-oiled action machine in it’s own right. The Manga of GANTZ doesn’t satirise the convention of films that we are used to, and that is one line between fantastic and ridiculous that makes it’s live action counterpart fun.\n\nPlease comment if GANTZ or its sequel are stuck in your head too.\n\n-thespectrumperspective."
