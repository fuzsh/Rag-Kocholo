Blood type AB.\n\nA classmate and best friend of Sawako.\n\nNickname is \"Yanochin\". A gal-style girl with pierced ears. However, despite her appearance, she is polite and somewhat shy. Sensitive to the nuances of others' emotions.\n\nInitially, like others, she was afraid of Sawako, but after being approached by Sawako in the summer of their first year, they became friends and eventually best friends.\n\nShe has had many romantic relationships but has never truly been in love, which made her feel inferior. During the school trip in their second year, she was confused by Kent's advances but was moved by his sincere attitude and started dating him.\n\nHowever, she could not come to love Kent and decided to change herself, who always chose the safe path and had never fully committed to anything. She decided to go to a university in Tokyo alone, breaking up with Kent.\n\nLater, she realizes her first love for Pin, who had always guided her, and confesses to him on Valentine's Day when she gets accepted into university, but is rejected.\n\nHer motto is \"Beauty in both talent and appearance.\"\n\n(Recently Edited: K K )\n\n(Last edited time: Aug. 13, 2024, 6:17 p.m.)\n\n(View edit history)\n\nVoice Actor\n\nEdit\n\nFeatured Anime\n\nOther Characters\n\nView All\n\nAniBase.Net\n\nFor data accuracy, this feature requires you to log in.\n\nLog in with Google account"
