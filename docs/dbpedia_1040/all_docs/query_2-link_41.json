        "text": "Luna, Artemis, and Diana\n\nLuna, Artemis, and Diana are cats from the planet Mau, which is named after the Chinese word \"貓\", meaning \"cat\", who act as advisors to their owners. They are capable of speech and have a crescent moon symbol on their forehead, and can also assume a human form. The two older cats, Luna and Artemis, lived in the Moon Kingdom millennia before the events of the series and were advisors to Queen Serenity; the third, Diana, is much younger and was born on Earth. The cats serve as mentors and confidantes, as well as a source of information and new tools and items. Although Luna has the largest role of the three, Artemis was the first to appear and was also prominent in Codename: Sailor V.\n\nIn Act 55 of the manga, Sailor Tin Nyanko, a false Guardian from Mau, attacks them. Artemis calls it a peace-loving world, but Tin Nyanko informs him that Sailor Galaxia wiped out its people after he and Luna left. She blasts them on their crescent moon symbols and they turn into ordinary cats, unable to speak. Later, as they care for the cats, Princess Kakyuu informs Usagi that they have powerful Star Seeds which are as brilliant as Sailor Crystals. In Act 56, they are brought to the River Lethe and Sailor Lethe kills them, but are reincarnated at the end of the series along with everyone else.[note 1]\n\nIn the live-action series, Luna and Artemis are portrayed as stuffed toys rather than real cats. They are usually represented using puppets, though CGI effects are used for complicated scenes.\n\nWriter Mary Grigsby considers the cat characters to blend pre-modern ideas about feminine mystery with modern ideas such as the lucky cat.[30]\n\nLuna\n\nMain article: Luna (Sailor Moon)\n\nLuna (ルナ, Runa) is a black cat who was a devoted servant to Princess Serenity and advisor to her mother, Queen Serenity. When the kingdom fell, she and Artemis were put into a long sleep and sent to Earth to look after the Sailor Guardians, who are reborn there, with parts of her memory suppressed so that she must find the Sailor Guardians.[18]: Act 9 She also provides them with many of their items. She first encounters Usagi and teaches her to become Sailor Moon, unaware that she is actually the reincarnated Princess Serenity. Over the course of the series, Luna develops a close bond with Usagi, though it is initially on uneasy terms, as Luna often upsets her by giving her unsolicited advice. She and Artemis have an implied romantic relationship, which is confirmed when they meet Diana, their daughter from the future.\n\nArtemis\n\nArtemis (アルテミス, Arutemisu) is the white cat companion to Minako Aino, who trains her to become Sailor V and remains by her side when she takes on her proper role as Sailor Venus. He first guides Usagi through the Sailor V video game at the Crown Game Center arcade without revealing his true identity. In the anime, when a technical problem reveals him, Luna is annoyed to learn that he was guiding her.[31] Later, he fills Luna in on the details of her true mission.[18]: Act 9 In the Sailor V manga and the live-action series, he gives special items to the Guardians, but unlike Luna does not seem to produce them himself. He does not seem to mind the fact that he is named after a female goddess, even when Minako teases him about it.[17] He is more easy-going than Luna and has a \"big brother\" relationship with Minako, although it is implied he is attracted to her.[16]: Act 43 He also cares deeply for Luna, often comforting her when she is distressed and stating his admiration of her. In addition, he is a good father to Diana, as evidenced by her affection for him.\n\nIn Japanese, Artemis is voiced by Yasuhiro Takato in the first anime adaptation, by Yohei Oobayashi in the first three seasons of Crystal, and Taishi Murata in the Eternal and Cosmos films.[32] In the live-action series, he is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi. He appears in the first Sailor Moon musical, played by a cat-suited Keiji Himeno. In English, he is voiced by Ron Rubin in the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation and by Johnny Yong Bosch in the Viz Media English adaptation.\n\nDiana\n\nDiana (ダイアナ, Daiana) is the future daughter of Luna and Artemis, who first appears when the Sailor Guardians travel to the 30th century in the Black Moon arc. After defeating Death Phantom, she joins them after they return to the 20th century. In the anime, she first appears in Sailor Moon SuperS, calling Artemis her father, to Luna's initial dismay. It is later revealed that she is from the future and that her mother is Luna. Just as Luna and Artemis guide Usagi and Minako, Diana acts as a guardian to Chibiusa. She is curious, eager to help, and polite, always addressing Usagi and Mamoru with the Japanese honorific \"-sama\" and calling Chibiusa by her formal title, Small Lady. Despite her youth, she is occasionally able to help the Sailor Guardians, often because of the knowledge she has gained in the future.\n\nIn Japanese, Diana is voiced by Kumiko Nishihara in the first series and by Shoko Nakagawa in Crystal. In English, she is voiced by Loretta Jafelice in the Cloverway English adaptation, by Naomi Emmerson in Sailor Moon SuperS: The Movie, and by Debi Derryberry in the Viz Media English adaptation.\n\nIn one of her reviews of Sailor Moon Crystal, IGN writer Meghan Sullivan admitted that the scene in which Diana tells Sailor Pluto to go and help Chibiusa and the Sailor Guardians while she guards the Door of Time and Space made her tear up, stating: \"Here was this tiny cat - who by her own admission has no powers and is too small to fight, offering to help however she could. It's moments like these that remind me why I love Sailor Moon so much.\"[33]\n\nSailor Starlights\n\nThe Sailor Starlights (セーラースターライツ, Sērā Sutāraitsu) are a group of Sailor Guardians composed of Sailor Star Fighter, Sailor Star Maker, and Sailor Star Healer; in civilian form they go by the pseudonyms Kou Seiya, Kou Taiki, and Kou Yaten, respectively. They are from the planet Kinmoku (キンモク星, Kinmokusei), whose princess, Princess Kakyuu, left to escape Sailor Galaxia's assault and heal her wounds. They tracked Kakyuu to Earth and then Japan, where they disguised themselves as the male pop star group The Three Lights (スリーライツ, Surī Raitsu) and embedded their music with a telepathic broadcast to attract her attention. They attend Jūban High School along with Usagi and her friends. Eventually, while headed to the Galaxy Cauldron, Galaxia's henchwomen Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi kill them.\n\nIn the anime, the Starlights were given a major role. On Earth, they physically change into males in their civilian forms and become women again when transforming into Sailor Guardians, as opposed to their manga counterparts, who disguise themselves as men as civilians. As Starlights, they distance themselves from the other Sailor Guardians, deeming that Earth is not their responsibility. They survive several direct battles with Galaxia herself, and help Sailor Moon defeat Chaos to save Galaxia. Takeuchi expressed surprise at Toei Animation's decision to make the Starlights lead characters in the anime adaptation, but was even more shocked by their treatment of their' sex.[34] In the Italian dub, instead of changing sex, the team has six members, as the Three Lights summon their twin sisters instead of transforming, as the original depiction was very controversial in Italy.[35]\n\nThe Starlights are featured in several of the Sailor Moon musicals (Sailor Stars, Eien Densetsu, and their revised editions, as well as Ryuusei Densetsu, Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin and Le Mouvement Final). Despite being portrayed by women, it is meant to be ambiguous as to whether they take on male forms or cross-dress, though their personalities reflect the former. Their story also combines elements from both the manga and the anime; for instance, they travel to the Galaxy Cauldron as in the manga, but survive the battles against Galaxia as in the anime. The pairings with the Sailor Guardians from the anime are also featured in some musicals.\n\nTheir exact relationship to each other is unknown; according to the manga, they are not siblings.[29]: Act 51 Their name \"Kou\" (光) has several meanings, including \"light\", making the name \"Three Lights\" a pun. In the original English manga, \"Kou\" was translated to \"Lights\" and was used as their shared family name.\n\nSailor Star Fighter\n\nKou Seiya (星野 光, Seiya Kō) is the leader of the Starlights as Sailor Star Fighter (セーラースターファイター, Sērā Sutā Faitā) and the lead vocalist for the Three Lights. In general, Seiya acts arrogant and tends to be, at least on the surface, confident in their own abilities.\n\nSeiya becomes the star player of their local high-school American football team and the school's star athlete, upsetting Haruka Tenoh, who was the previous star athlete on the track and field team. Eventually, Seiya raises the suspicions of the Sailor Guardians as to their identity. In the anime, Taiki and Yaten consider them to be prone to bouts of childishness, such as when they show off their basketball skills before the school,[36] but generally follow their lead.\n\nSeiya develops strong feelings for Usagi, calling her odango, like Mamoru does, their attempts to forge a bond with her providing the primary romantic tension of the season. The two go on a date at an amusement park, which is interrupted when Sailor Iron Mouse attacks.[37] Seiya makes their interest in her clear when they spend time together practicing softball, telling her, \"I like your light.\"[38] However, their feelings are not reciprocated and they acknowledge the one-sided romance.[39]\n\nThe relationship between Sailor Star Fighter and Princess Kakyuu is slightly ambiguous. In the anime, when Seiya daydreams of their home planet, they think of an image of her, which is suddenly superimposed by an image of Usagi, much as Usagi had seen Seiya's image overlaid by Mamoru in previous episodes.[40] In the image poem released for their CD single, however, they suggest that their feelings for her are because they are \"carrying the heart of a boy\" and because they were attracted to her light.\n\nIn the band, they have the role of lead vocals, guitar, and lyrics, but were also playing the drums in their hideout because they believed Kakyuu had not heard them yet. According to Takeuchi, when she created them, they were meant to be a combination between Haruka and Mamoru, and were modeled after Jenny Shimizu.[15] Her theme color is sky blue.\n\nIn Japanese, they were voiced by Shiho Niiyama in the original series in one of her final roles before her death and by Marina Inoue in Sailor Moon Cosmos. In English, they are voiced by Melissa Hutchison.[41] In the musicals, Seiya has been portrayed by Sayuri Katayama, Chinatsu Akiyama and Meiku Harukawa.\n\nSailor Star Maker\n\nKou Taiki (大気 光, Taiki Kō), also known as Sailor Star Maker (セーラースターメイカー, Sērā Sutā Meikā), is the most intellectual and cool-headed of the trio. Their abilities rival that of Ami, though they consider her romantic notions foolish. However, in the anime, Ami's appeal for them to see the good in dreaming does begin to have an effect. In combat with a phage, Star Maker is the first of the Starlights to willingly allow Sailor Moon to heal the monster rather than trying to kill it themselves, because it had been a teacher who Ami respected.[42] Later in the series, as they are beginning to lose hope in finding Princess Kakyuu, they visit a sick girl named Misa in the hospital. She shows them a drawing of the Princess that she sees when she listens to the Three Lights' song,[43] giving them renewed hope.\n\nLike Yaten, Taiki believes that Seiya should stay away from Usagi after learning she is Sailor Moon, despite their wish, shared by Princess Kakyuu and the Sailor Guardians, for them to work together. However, their views on Usagi change for the better near the end of Sailor Stars.\n\nIn the band, they have the role of background vocals, keyboards, and composition. They also enjoy poetry and are part of the literature club at school. Taiki is meant to be a more-distant Setsuna Meioh.[15] Her theme color is violet.\n\nIn Japanese, Taiki is voiced by Narumi Tsunoda in the original series and by Saori Hayami in Cosmos. In English, they are voiced by Erika Harlacher.[41] In the musicals, Taiki has been portrayed by Hikari Ono, Akiko Nakayama, and Riona Tatemichi.\n\nSailor Star Healer\n\nKou Yaten (夜天 光, Yaten Kō), also known as Sailor Star Healer (セーラースターヒーラー, Sērā Sutā Hīrā), is a lonely person who does not like to socialize or interact with others, preferring to focus on their mission. Their remarks are often sharp-edged and blunt, which further separates them from others, which the other Starlights mock them for as it may reduce their fans.[44] Yaten is egotistical and nurses grudges, and hates injury.[15] However, they and Luna get along well.\n\nYaten has the most spiritual awareness of the three and is able to tell when Star Seeds are taken by Galaxia. They view humans as untrustworthy and want to find Kakyuu so they can leave Earth as soon as possible. After learning that Usagi is Sailor Moon, Yaten believes that Seiya should stay away from her, despite their wish, shared by Princess Kakyuu and the Sailor Guardians, for them to work together, a view shared by Taiki and Sailors Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. However, like Taiki, their views on Usagi change for the better near the end of Sailor Stars. In the anime, Yaten is shown to be physically stronger than Makoto Kino in their civilian form, and bonds with her as they share moments together.\n\nIn the band, they have the role of background vocals, bass guitar, and song arrangement. They also enjoy photography, but do not belong to any school club, preferring to just go home.[15] Their theme color is chartreuse.\n\nIn Japanese, Yaten is voiced by Chika Sakamoto in the original series and by Ayane Sakura in Cosmos. In English, they are voiced by Sarah Anne Williams.[41] In the musicals, Yaten has been portrayed by Momoko Okuyama, Mikako Tabe, and Saki Matsuda.\n\nOther humans\n\nIkuko Tsukino\n\nIkuko Tsukino (月野 育子, Tsukino Ikuko) is Usagi's mother, who is often seen cooking and lecturing her for her grades in school. They are shown to be close, since she gives Usagi advice on relationships and eagerly accepts her relationship with Mamoru. She cares for Chibiusa when she is present, whom she believes to be her niece, but in reality is her future granddaughter. She also cares for Chibi-Chibi, whom she believes to be her second daughter. Ikuko's name and design are modeled after Takeuchi's mother.[45]\n\nIn the live-action series, Ikuko is portrayed as an outgoing, quirky, and determined person. She changes her hairstyle almost every day, is constantly trying out new omelette recipes, and loves to be in the spotlight. She is a high-school friend with Minako's manager, and it is said they were participants in their school's theater program.\n\nIn Japanese, Ikuko is voiced by Sanae Takagi in the original series and in Crystal by Yūko Mizutani until her death in 2016,[46] a role later taken over by Wakana Yamazaki in Cosmos. In English, she is voiced by Barbara Radecki in the DIC and Cloverway English dubs and by Tara Platt in the Viz Media English dub. Kaori Moriwaka portrays Ikuko in the live-action series.\n\nKenji Tsukino\n\nKenji Tsukino (月野 謙之, Tsukino Kenji) is Usagi's father. He is a stereotypical well-meaning Japanese salaryman, who works as a magazine reporter[12]: Act 4 and later as an editor-in-chief.[47] Early on, he becomes jealous when he sees Usagi with Mamoru Chiba, thinking he is too old for her.[48] Like his wife, Kenji is unaware of Usagi's real identity. He senses a maturity in her when she is finally aware of her status as Princess Serenity, and notes that at times, her beauty seems serene.[25]: Act 10 Kenji appears less frequently after the anime adaptation's second season.\n\nHe does not appear in the live-action series, which is explained by him being away on business trips. However, he appears briefly in the direct-to-DVD Special Act, crying at Usagi's wedding.\n\nIn Japanese, Kenji is voiced by Yuji Machi in the original series and by Mitsuaki Madono in Crystal. In English, he is voiced by David Huband in the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation and by Keith Silverstein in the Viz Media English adaptation. In the Special Act of the live-action series, he is portrayed by series director Ryuta Tasaki.\n\nShingo Tsukino\n\nShingo Tsukino (月野 進悟, Tsukino Shingo, called Samuel \"Sammy\" Tsukino in the original English dub) is Usagi's younger brother, making her the only Sailor Guardian with a known sibling. His influence in her life is alternately helpful and mocking; he considers her well-meaning, but also an accident-prone crybaby. He generally does not get along with her very well and sometimes gets into arguments with her, but they care for and love each other. Though unaware of his sister's true identity, Shingo is impressed by the urban legends of Sailor Moon and Sailor V, especially Sailor Moon because she rescued him from Dark Kingdom forces early in her career.[49] Like his older sister, he enjoys video games, but unlike her, is a diligent student. Shingo's favorite book is Shonen J*mp (a reference to the manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump).[15] In the anime, Shingo appears in several episodes of the first season, but appears less frequently afterwards.\n\nIn the live-action series, Shingo dislikes much of what his sister and mother do, and does not care much for life in general. In the video game Sailor Moon: Another Story, Shingo is kidnapped by the villains in an attempt to force Usagi to hand over the Silver Crystal.\n\nIn Japanese, Shingo was voiced by Chiyoko Kawashima in the original series until her retirement in 2001, with Seira Ryū taking over the role in Crystal.[46] In English, he is voiced by Julie Lemieux in the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation and by Nicolas Roye in the Viz Media English adaptation. In the live-action series, he is portrayed by Naoki Takeshi.\n\nNaru Osaka\n\nNaru Osaka (大阪 なる, Ōsaka Naru, called Molly Baker in the original English dub) is Usagi's best friend and schoolmate at the start of the series. She and her mother are the first victims of a monster attack, and she idolizes Sailor Moon for saving them. Throughout the series, she continues to be a frequent target of villains and monsters. In a \"memorable subplot\" of the anime adaptation,[6]: 284–285 Naru falls in love with Nephrite, who eventually returns her feelings and attempts to atone for his misdeeds. His death while protecting Naru devastates her throughout the first season, which Kotono Mitsuishi was particularly touched by.[50] In the anime, Naru later dates Gurio Umino.\n\nNaru plays a more important role in the live-action series, learning most of the truth about the Sailor Guardians. She is also a more confident and outgoing person. For a short while, she and Ami share a conflicted relationship, as both seem to be jealous of the other's closeness with Usagi. However, they resolve their differences and become good friends.\n\nNaru's younger sister, Naruru, is featured in a short side-story in the Stars manga.[51]: Chibiusa's Picture Diary #4[52] In the anime it is stated that she is an only child.[53] Naruru at first appears with Haruka, Michiru, and Usagi at the high school and is shown getting along with them.\n\nIn Japanese, Naru is voiced by Shino Kakinuma in the original series and by Satomi Satō in Crystal.[46] In English, she is voiced by Mary Long in the DIC/Cloverway English version[13] and by Danielle Judovits in the Viz Media English version. Chieko Ochi portrays her in the live-action series, and Yuka Yamauchi portrays her in the musical Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon - Nogizaka46 Version.\n\nGurio Umino\n\nGurio Umino (海野 ぐりお, Umino Gurio, called Melvin in the original English dub) is a student in Usagi's class at school, who at the beginning of the series has an infatuation with her. His defining characteristic is his glasses, which are drawn with swirls denoting their thickness. Umino is commonly portrayed as a \"nerdy\", \"weird\", and \"know-it-all\" otaku, regularly keeping Usagi informed on current events, new students, gossip, and other information she might appreciate. Despite his ordinarily nerdy appearance, Umino is implied to be \"relatively handsome\" with his glasses off, which was later confirmed by Takeuchi.[54] In the first anime, he develops a relationship with Naru, but their importance gradually decreases after the first season.\n\nThe kanji in Umino's surname mean either \"ocean field\" or \"of ocean\"; as such, it is constructed in the same way as Usagi's and those of other Sailor Guardians.\n\nIn Japanese, he is voiced by Keiichi Nanba in Sailor Moon and Daiki Yamashita in Crystal.[46] In English, he is voiced by Roland Parliament in the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation and by Benjamin Diskin in the Viz Media English adaptationn. In the musical Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon - Nogizaka46 Version, he is portrayed by Marina Tanoue.\n\nHaruna Sakurada\n\nHaruna Sakurada (桜田 春菜, Sakurada Haruna, called Patricia Haruna in the original English dub) is a junior high school teacher who often lectures Usagi for her laziness. Haruna intends to find a husband, which makes her an easy target for the Dark Kingdom during the first arc, and she often engages in seemingly childish things in this regard. She appears less frequently as the series progresses, and is never seen after Usagi and her friends start high school. In the live-action series, Haruna assigns pop quizzes and clean-up duty when needed. She is eccentric and friendly and motherly towards her students, even Usagi.\n\nThe kanji in her name mean \"cherry blossom\" (sakura), \"rice field\" (da), \"spring\" (haru), and \"vegetables\" (na). The \"spring\" part of her name becomes a pun in the context of other works by Takeuchi: Haruna appears in her earlier series, The Cherry Project, which features her sister Fuyuna in one of its side stories. Two other characters with similar names appear in Takeuchi works: Natsuna in Codename: Sailor V and Akina in PQ Angels, and also have the surname Sakurada. The Japanese words fuyu, natsu, and aki mean \"winter\", \"summer\", and \"autumn\", respectively.\n\nIn Japanese, Haruna was originally voiced by Chiyoko Kawashima in Sailor Moon until her retirement in 2001, with Akemi Kanda voicing her from Crystal onwards.[46] In English, she is voiced by Nadine Rabinovitch in the DIC English adaptation and by Julie Ann Taylor in the Viz Media English adaptation. She is portrayed by Tomoko Otakara in the live-action series and by Kasumi Hyuga and Kiho Seishi in the musicals.\n\nMotoki Furuhata\n\nMotoki Furuhata (古幡 元基, Furuhata Motoki, called Andrew Hansford in the original English dub[55]) works at the Crown Game Center, a video arcade Usagi frequently visits, and at the Crown Fruit Parlor, and is also a KO University student along with Mamoru Chiba. After he recognizes the Sailor Guardians and learns their true identities, he vows to keep their identities secret. In the anime adaptation, Usagi calls him \"Big Brother\" Motoki (元基お兄さん, Motoki-oniisan) and has a crush on him in the beginning of the series. Motoki and Mamoru also attend the Azabu Institute of Technology.[25]: Act 11 He is naive, as he says that he views the girls as younger sisters and is oblivious to the fact that they have crushes on him. He has a little sister, Unazuki Furuhata, who is friends with Usagi and the others. His girlfriend is Reika Nishimura, a science student, and they both knew Setsuna when she studied at their university.[56] In the continuity of Sailor Moon Crystal, Motoki's background is the same, but he does not know Mamoru, who is still a high school student.\n\nIn the live-action series, the Crown Center is a karaoke parlor. There is an initial flirtatious relationship between Motoki and Makoto until it intensifies, and in the Special Act, which takes place four years after the series finale, Motoki proposes to Makoto, who accepts.\n\nIn Japanese, Motoki is voiced by Hiroyuki Satō in Sailor Moon and by Hiroshi Okamoto in Crystal.[46] In English, he is voiced by Colin O'Meara in the DIC English adaptation, by Steven Bednarski in the Cloverway dub, and by Lucien Dodge in the Viz Media English adaptation. He is portrayed by Masaya Kikawada in the live-action series.\n\nReika Nishimura\n\nReika Nishimura (西村 レイカ, Nishimura Reika, called Rita Blake in the original English dub) is Motoki Furuhata's girlfriend and fellow student at KO University, where she later befriends Setsuna Meioh. In the anime, she is the reincarnation of the Great Monster Rikokeidā. After leaving Japan twice to study abroad, she eventually leaves the country for 10 years, but Motoki is still willing to wait for her.[57] In Japanese, she is voiced by Rika Fukami in the original series and by Mai Nakahara in Crystal. In English, she is voiced by Wendy Lyon and Lindsay Collins in the DIC English adaptation, by Sara Sahr in the Cloverway dub, and by Erica Mendez in the Viz Media English adaptation.\n\nRei's Grandfather\n\nRei's grandfather (レイのおじいさん, Rei no ojiisan) is a Shinto priest and Rei Hino's grandfather, who lives at the Hikawa Shrine. In the anime, he has a different physical appearance and has a more prominent role as one of the holders of the Rainbow Crystals that make up the Silver Crystal. He often flirts with anyone, regardless of their gender.[58] In Japanese, he is voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura in the first anime adaptation and by Hirohiko Kakegawa in Sailor Moon Eternal. In English, he is voiced by David Fraser in the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, by John Stocker as a stand-in in Sailor Moon S episode 99, by Michael Sorich in the Viz Media English adaptation, and by Todd Haberkorn in Sailor Moon Eternal.\n\nYuichiro Kumada\n\nYuichiro Kumada (熊田 雄一郎, Kumada Yūichirō, called Chad Holdenford in the original English dub) is an anime-only character who helps out at the Hikawa Shrine. His family is very rich and has a mountain lodge, where he takes Rei and her friends for skiing. After falling in love with Rei, Yūichirō decides to stay at Hikawa Shrine to be near her. Despite her not reciprocating his love, he remains faithful to her and tries to protect her, with her warming up to his personality over time. In Japanese, he is voiced by Bin Shimada in the first anime series. In English, he is voiced by Steven Bednarski in the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, by Damon D'Oliveira in Sailor Moon S, by Jason Barr in Sailor Moon SuperS), and by Wally Wingert in the Viz Media English adaption.\n\nUnazuki Furuhata\n\nUnazuki Furuhata (古幡 宇奈月, Furuhata Unazuki, called Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Hansford in the original English dub) is Motoki Furuhata's younger sister, who works as a waitress at the Crown Fruit Parlor and attends T•A Private Girls School with Rei Hino. She first appears sporadically, with her initial appearance being in Sailor Moon R as a mistaken love rival for Mamoru Chiba. She dreams of her first kiss in Sailor Moon S, which results in her being targeted by the Death Busters. Unazuki appears more frequently in SuperS as a major supporting character who is usually among Usagi's group. In Japanese, she is voiced by Miyako Endou in the first series, with Eriko Hara as a stand-in. In English, she is voiced by Sabrina Grdevich in the DIC English adaptation, by Sabrina Grdevich in the Cloverway dub, by Catherine Disher in Sailor Moon S, by Daniela Olivieri in SuperS, and by Veronica Taylor in the Viz Media English adaptation.\n\nKotono Sarashina\n\nKotono Sarashina (更科 琴乃, Sarashina Kotono) is Kyusuke Sarashina's elder sister and a student at T•A Academy for Girls, where she is the president of its Supernatural Research Club. Like many students at T•A, she seems to have an admiration for Rei Hino. She first appeared in Act 15, when the disguised Koan created a rival club with a fortune-telling booth at the school festival. She made a Sailor V button for her brother, which Kyusuke refused to get for Chibiusa despite her liking it. However, after they help defeat the vampire Lilica Hubert, he has Kotono make a Sailor Moon button for her as well. She is voiced by Akemi Kanda in Sailor Moon Crystal and by Tara Sands in the Viz Media English dub.\n\nIttou Asanuma\n\nIttou Asanuma (浅沼 一等, Asanuma Ittō) is introduced in the Black Moon arc of the manga as Makoto's friend, who is interested in science fiction, UFOs, and local paranormal activity. He greatly respects Mamoru, who is an upperclassman at his school. Asanuma initially thinks that the Sailor Guardians are aliens, but after he hears Luna talk, Makoto confesses the Guardians' identities to him.[59] Asanuma is later attacked by Ayakashi sister Calaveras and rescued by Sailor Moon.

When the Dead Moon Circus conquered Elysion, Helios was captured and Queen Nelehenia transformed him into the alicorn Pegasus (一角天馬（ペガサス）, Pegasasu).[15] Helios remembered a vision of a maiden who would save Elysion and astral projected his Pegasus form to the surface, where he assumed Chibiusa to be this maiden while providing her and Usagi with information and weapons.

She has red-pink hair worn in a hairstyle similar to Usagi's, being worn in heart-shaped odango with ringlets at the sides,. Her name is a doubling of the Japanese word chibi, meaning \"small person\" or \"small child\", and is also because of her similarity to Chibiusa. It is also a pun, as the word Chibi-Chibi means \"making something last\".[70]\n\nChibi-Chibi is first shown floating down to Earth and appearing at the Tsukino house.[29]: Act 44 In the anime, she first meets Usagi in the park and starts to follow her around, saying only \"chibi chibi\" without having been prompted.[71] Chibi-Chibi attaches herself to Usagi's family, whose memories are modified so that they believe her to be the youngest child of the family, like how Chibiusa had made them believe she was her cousin.[note 3] Chibi-Chibi is the caretaker of a small ornate censer in which Princess Kakyuu is resting, hidden from Sailor Galaxia.[29]: Act 51[72] Eventually, she uses her own power to transform into the Sailor Guardian Sailor Chibi-Chibi.[51]: Act 54 In her Sailor Guardian form, she wields a heart scepter and uses it to defend herself and Sailor Moon, but is not shown using attacks of her own.[51]: Act 56 Her childlike form is a disguise for Sailor Cosmos, a powerful Sailor Guardian who is the future version of Sailor Moon.[5]: Act 59\n\nIn the anime, Chibi-Chibi is Galaxia's Star Seed, who had once been a great force for good.[73] When Galaxia fought Chaos, she defeated it by sealing it inside her own body. To prevent her Star Seed from being corrupted, she sent it away to Earth, where it became Chibi-Chibi.[73] The Starlights refer to Chibi-Chibi as the \"light of hope\" (希望の光, kibō no hikari), as she is their final hope to defeat Galaxia. Ultimately, Chibi-Chibi transforms into the Sword of Sealing (封印の剣, Fuuin no Ken), which Galaxia had used to seal away Chaos, and asks Sailor Moon to use it to defeat them. During the battle, Galaxia shatters the sword, killing Chibi-Chibi. However, she is revived along with the other fallen Sailor Guardians after Sailor Moon cleanses Galaxia of Chaos.[69]\n\nChibi-Chibi is voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi in Japanese and by Stephanie Sheh in English.[74] In the stage musicals, she has been portrayed by Mao Kawasaki, Mikiko Asuke, Yuka Gouchou, and Mina Horita.

At first, she wants Sailor Moon to destroy the Galaxy Cauldron altogether, ensuring Chaos' destruction, but she protests after realizing that if the Cauldron is destroyed, no more stars will be born, leaving the Galaxy without a future. Sailor Moon chooses to sacrifice herself to the Cauldron and seal Chaos away, which Cosmos realizes to have been the right decision. Reminded of the strength and courage she needs to have, Sailor Cosmos returns to the future with new hope.[5]: Act 60 After the end of the anime adaptation, Takeuchi commented that she wished Sailor Cosmos had been used in Sailor Moon Sailor Stars.[77] In Sailor Moon Cosmos, she is voiced by Keiko Kitagawa.[78] In the musicals, Sailor Cosmos is portrayed by Satomi Okubo, who had also portrayed Usagi from 2013 to 2015."
