Geneva City School District is a school district in Geneva, New York, United States. The superintendent is Mrs. Patricia Garcia.

The district operates four schools: Geneva High School, Geneva Middle School, West Street School, and North Street School.

History[]

Relatively little is known about the early history of Geneva public schools. On June 19, 1812, the New York State legislature passed an act for the establishment of Common Schools which became the basis of the common school system in the State of New York. The date of the first public school established in Geneva in compliance with this act was in 1815.[1] Subsequently, a number of schools were established in Geneva.

In 1853, the Geneva Union School was incorporated and authorized to maintain a classical department and to instruct a normal class. In 1863, Geneva schools were desegregated. On March 16, 1869, the Union School’s corporate title was changed to “The Geneva Classical and Union School.” It was the first Union School built in New York State[1].

In 1924-1925, a commodious High School building was built at the corner of Milton and Pulteney Streets in the City of Geneva. The school was erected on the grounds formerly occupied by a cemetery; the bodies from which were exhumed and removed to Glenwood Cemetery[1].

In 1981, the high school was moved to its present location at 101 Carter Road in the City of Geneva.

The District offices are located at 400 West North Street in Geneva. The current Superintendent is Mrs. Patricia Garcia. Previously, the school's offices were located at 649 South Exchange Street in Geneva, but were moved before the 2010 school year[2].
