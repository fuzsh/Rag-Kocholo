A goal of The Geneva School is to educate the whole child: mind, body, and soul. We recognize there is a great kingdom calling on every life, and take seriously the opportunity to shape a child for his or her calling. The Geneva School not only aims to equip students for college, but also to instill in them a life-long love of learning and delight in Godâ€™s truth that will enable them flourish in life and their chosen vocation.
