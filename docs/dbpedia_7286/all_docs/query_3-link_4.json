        "text": "Classical Pedagogy\n\nThe best way to understand or learn about a topic is to experience, examine, evaluate, question, and even fail at itâthis is fundamental to joyful discovery.\n\nWe are devoted to advancing language and reasoning skills by employing a time-proven classical pedagogy that aligns with the natural stages of child development. This purposeful training, led by Geneva Schoolâs experienced faculty, instills wisdom and sparks an enduring love of learning.\n\nLearn More\n\nChristian Principles\n\nWe believe that God is the Author and Creator of all things and that the Bible articulates Godâs truth to humanity. At Geneva School students discover the world through the lens of biblical truth as a foundation for all of lifeâs pursuits.\n\nWe believe it is impossible to separate the soul from the mind and body and so seek to provide an academic environment where children strive to achieve their full God-given potential. The programs and activities at Geneva School are designed to foster the spiritual development of our students. We encourage students to ponder deep spiritual truths as they would any academic subject.\n\nLearn More\n\nCivic Presence\n\nWe believe that a Christian community should reflect the multifaceted nature of God and endeavor toward the peace and prosperity of the city.\n\nOur location in the heart of Manhattan is a gift, and we commit to wide-ranging diversityâin ethnicity, geography, faith practices, and socioeconomic backgroundsâto foster the fullest expression of human flourishing and the most complete picture of our Creator.\n\nLearn More\n\nCommitted Parents\n\nWe believe that deeply involved parents and guardians are one of our greatest assets and ensure the nurturing environment we desire for our students.\n\nWe partner with Christian families and value parental input and involvement. We affirm that educators and parents together promote studentsâ academic success while instilling a cohesive biblical perspective imperative to lifelong faith practices.\n\nLearn More\n\nConsecrated Purpose\n\nWe believe the ultimate goal of academic pursuits is to use oneâs gifts for the glory of God and the good of others.\n\nWe aim to foster a community that showcases the fruit of the Spiritâlove, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-controlâso that Geneva School and its graduates are known for strength of character and acts of generosity.\n\nLearn More"
