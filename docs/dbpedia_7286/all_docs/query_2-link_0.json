        "text": "The Geneva School of Boerne exists to provide a classical education from a biblical worldview to equip students for a lifetime of learning, service and leadership to the glory of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe classical method provides a liberal arts education with an emphasis on truth, beauty and goodness. We teach from a Christ-centered worldview and graduate well-spoken students who have a firm understanding of their faith and are equipped to do hard things.\n\nWe are dedicated Christian educators who invest in the Geneva mission to provide a time-tested and rigorous education. We partner with parents to challenge and empower students by caring for the whole person as we pursue excellence in all things.\n\nGeneva is a community of people who are rooted in the hope of Jesus Christ and depend on His grace to actively love others with a spirit of humility and kindness. We value sacrifice and ownership as we serve together and seek to make a difference for the cause of Christ in this world.\n\nNOTICE OF NON-DISCRIMINATORY POLICY\n\nGeneva School of Boerne prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, nationality, disability, age or ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, tuition assistance, financial aid, employment policies or any other programs administered by the school. Employment decisions will be made on the basis of each applicantâ€™s job qualifications, experience and abilities. Additionally, the school does not discriminate against an employee or applicant who acts to oppose such discrimination or participates in the investigation of a complaint related to a discriminatory employment practice.\n\nThe school reserves the right to use religion as a hiring and admissions criterion for all positions, due to the mission and nature of the school as a Christian faith-based institution, as permitted by law."
