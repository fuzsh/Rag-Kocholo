        "text": "We believe that as Eternal Father, He is the Father of all men in the non-salvation, Creator- creature sense, the Father of the nation Israel, the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the spiritual Father of all who believe in Christ. He is the author of salvation, the One who sent the Son, and the disciplinarian of His children. (Ex. 4:22; Ps. 2:7-9; John 5:37; Acts 17:29; Gal. 3:26; Eph. 1:3-6; Heb. 12:9; I Pet. 1:3).\n\nWe believe Jesus Christ is God incarnate, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, completely God and completely man. We believe in His pre-existence, His sinless life, His substitutionary atonement, His bodily resurrection from the grave, His ascension into Heaven, and His bodily return from Heaven. (John 1:1, 14, 18; Luke 1:35; Rom. 3:24-26, 4:25; I Pet. 1:3-5; Eph. 4:11-16; I Thess. 4:13-18; Heb. 1:3, 7:23-25; I John 2:1-2).\n\nIn the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. The Father is neither begotten, nor proceeding: The Son is eternally begotten of the Father: the Holy Spirit eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. (I John 5:7; Matt. 3:16, 28:19; II Cor. 13:14; John 1:14, 15:26; Gal. 4:6).\n\nWe believe man was created in the image of God; that Adam in his first sin condemned not only himself but all mankind to an estate of sin. All of mankind in Adam is now separated from God and in need of a redeemer. (Gen. 1:1, 27, 2:17, 3:1-19; Isa. 14:12-14; Luke 20:36; Heb. 1:13-14, 2:5-8; I Pet. 2:4; Jude 6; John 12:31; Heb. 2:14; Rev. 20:10; John 1:1-3, 8:44; Col. 1:16-17; Rom. 5:12-21; Eph. 2:1-3).\n\n\"In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory. In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory” (Eph. 1:11-14). We affirm that these believers are eternally secure, have everlasting life, will not come into condemnation, and shall never perish. We believe that assurance comes to the believer from three primary means: trusting the Word of God’s promises, the witness of the Holy Spirit, and a persevering walk with the Lord. (John 1:12; I John 2:3, 17; II Cor. 5:17-21; Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7; Dan. 12:1-2; Matt 25:31-46; John 3:16, 36,5:24, 10:28-29, 11:25-26; Rom. 8:28-39; I John 4:11-13; Jude 1; Rev. 20:12-15).\n\nWe believe in the Church, both universally and locally, as the spiritual body of which Christ is the Head. The church exercises Christ’s authority until His return. We also believe that the church is entrusted with the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper. (Matt. 16:18; cf. Acts 1:5, 11:15, and I Cor. 12:13; Eph. 1:22-23, 4:11-16, 5:22-23; Col. 1:18).\n\nWe believe that those whom God has saved are sent into the world by Christ as He was by the Father. Those sent are ambassadors, commissioned to make Christ known to the whole world and to make disciples teaching them to obey all that Christ has commanded. (Matt. 28:18-20; John 15:8, 17:18, 20:21; Acts 1; Rom. 10:14-15; II Cor. 5:18-20; Col. 4:2-6; II Tim. 2:14-26)."
