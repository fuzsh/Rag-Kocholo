        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Geneva School is a private, college-preparatory school rooted in providing a Classical Christian education to its students. In 2014, the design firm worked closely with School stakeholders to develop a program and 40- acre master plan for a brand upper-class campus. The exterior design incorporates classical architectural details and proportions found in European colleges to reflect the Geneva Schoolâ€™s academic solid philosophy. The school was designed and constructed to be a modern, 21st-century learning environment with a Da Vinci studio, highly flexible learning labs that promote project-based learning, and collaborative flex spaces that engage interaction among students. The Upper School also includes traditional classrooms, science labs, a graphic and sculpture arts lab, a black box theatre, and a gymnasium."
