        "text": "When we joined The Geneva School 8 years ago, we were drawn in to the community immediately. In countless ways, Geneva has provided an exceptional education, opportunities to grow in faith, and life-giving relationships. Our oldest two (class of 2019 and class of 2021) have both stayed very close to their classmates. Our youngest (class of 2026) has expressed a desire to return to Geneva to teach in the future. I am so grateful for the support our kids have received over the years from teachers who have wanted the best for them. No school is perfect, but Geneva strives to nurture students with the goal of sending graduates into the world who love the Lord, serve their neighbors, and seek goodness, truth, and beauty.\n\nThis school is terrible. They are stuck up and pretentious. They do not care about the The children. I was shocked at how we were treated when inquiring about transferring our son to school. I spoke to several different people at the school and they were more interested in asking me questions then telling me about the school then when I had questions they danced around the answers, they also made it very clear to say that if our child didn’t score in the top 10% of their testing, they might not be a good fit for the school and we might need to look other places ,\n\nWe have loved our experience with Christian Classical Education at The Geneva School. The kids are immersed in their subjects, versus dull worksheets and memorization, which results in profound learning. For instance, in 2nd grade's studies of Egypt students create hieroglyphics in art, make a salt map in geography, mummify a chicken leg in science, perform the story of Exodus in theatre and so much more! It's a one-of-a-kind magical space where learning is just what you'd hope it could be.\n\nThe Geneva School is truly an incredible place. I am so thankful I found this school. I don’t feel like I work here, rather I feel like I’m part of a community, using my God given talents for the community. The staff, parents, and kids that attend Geneva are my favorite part. I love partnering with parents to have their kids grow in their love of learning, sports, reading and most importantly God. I hope everyone can find a place to be apart of like The Geneva School!\n\nWe have been with Geneva for 8 years now. Great school! We love the community, How the teachers connect with out kids and the quality of education we are getting in this school. The christian principles they provide and how it is reflected in everything the kids do in school is what we prayed and hoped for. We have now 1st grader and 7th grader in Geneva and hopefully my kids graduate from Geneva!\n\nBuilding on a positive experience at another local school, our children joined Geneva in the 9th grade. We are pleased with the integrated Christian classical-school approach and emphasis on teaching our children how to think and solve problems, not what to think. Courses do not shy away from secular topics but teach them within a Christ-centered framework. 9th grade biology is almost worth the tuition on its own. As with any school, faculty quality varies. But most have extensive experience. There is a transition period coming from other education models, but faculty and administration were helpful and our children thrived within a semester of their transfer.\n\nThe Geneva School has impacted the lives of my children and our whole family in tremendous ways. Not only do they provide an exceptional Classical Christian education, with amazing hands on learning experiences, plays\n\nand field trips, but the community is like no other. Our family experienced the devastation of a flood in our entire house after Hurricane Ian last year, and the Geneva School community showed up in such amazing ways. We were greatly supported and all our needs were met to help us recover and get back to a normal life. With the community at Geneva we were able to maintain our hope, despite our dire circumstances. We're forever grateful to this amazing school.\n\nWe moved here from Pennsylvania so that our kids could attend the GenevaSchool. We love living so close to the new campus and enjoy so many fun activities that the kids are involved in. The teachers seem to love our children almost more than we do. The close knit classroom of students tend to feel like friends for life and each new year. Seems to come with closer and closer knit friendships. We appreciate the fact that the school keeps the classrooms smaller in size for the one on one attention that is needed. We love the fact that the GenevaSchool makes learning so much fun and instills a love of learning in the students. One drawback would be the cost. We definitely make sacrifices on a daily basis to keep our children there, and know that it is worth it in the long run. However, at times the cost seems overwhelming. God has always provided, and we have been privileged to receive scholarships that have helped out tremendously. We are thankful and grateful.\n\nGeneva has given me the opportunity to serve others, to love learning, to make incredible friends, and to be reminded I am known and loved by God. My teachers pray over me and for me, establish a relationship with me that they hope blossoms into a love of Jesus, and encourage and challenge me academically.\n\nThe school is clearly focused on nurturing the student to become a leader. Academics, Arts, Sports are all required to help create well-rounded students and citizens. While being a large k-12 institution, the feeling is still personal and tailored. I appreciate the classical approach to learning, and the Christian worldview is key in understanding the chaos all around. I think my daughter will be well-equipped to navigate the world upon graduating.\n\nIt is a great community at The Geneva School. We love the families. We live the curriculum. We love how it teaches our child about God and social skills.\n\nWhat we would like to see changed is diversity. We need diverse teachers and more diverse students to make everyone feel welcome and also to truly show the love of Christ. We sadly do not show this quality at this time. Also, there is a lot of busy daily homework that can get quite repetitive. After a long school day, I’ve seen and heard a lot of students break down after school and show signs of anxiety (seen this as a former teacher at this school and in my own child).\n\nIt was pretty great! I just finished freshman year and I'm going to be a sophomore in August. I think the best part of Geneva is the teachers. They are so nice and you can tell that they really care and love their job! The worst part has to be the heavy homework load. On a regular day we're looking at 4 hours a night. I'd just like more compassion from the teachers when it comes to homework."
