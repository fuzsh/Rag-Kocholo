The Geneva School perennially outranks the aggregate measurements of academic success among other school groups, including independent private schools, religious private schools, public schools and all schools nationally. But we strive for far more than simply academic success. We desire our students to grow in wisdom and discernment, to develop godly dispositions of love, compassion, and humility, and to serve their fellow man through the use of their various gifts and callings. We seek by God's grace to educate the whole person.

The Geneva School seeks to provide students in grades K4-12 an extraordinary education, by means of an integrated curriculum, pedagogy and culture, both distinctly classical and distinctively Christian, that pursues goodness, truth, and beauty in all spheres of life, while viewing these spheres as elements of a divinely ordered whole. Further, Geneva seeks to instill in students a desire to love beauty, think deeply, and pursue Christ's calling.

The Geneva School is known for its popular and ever-exciting auction each spring, but it's probably best known for SALT. SALT—Serving and Learning Together—is an annual expression of what we highly value at Geneva, the development of Christian character through service and giving. SALT mobilizes nearly 700 students, teachers, and parent volunteers who in a single day donate approximately 3,500 service hours to the community at over a dozen non-profit organizations throughout Central Florida.

The Geneva School has two campuses, with the lower school currently located in Winter Park, FL, and the upper school on a permanent campus in Casselberry, FL, both just north of Orlando. A few miles from both campuses you'll find beautiful state parks and just 45 minutes south are Universal Studios and Walt Disney World. Orlando is also home to a phenomenal science center, acres of botanical gardens, and a rich theater and arts scene.
