Prompt fault detection and diagnosis is a best way to handle and tackle this problem. Dc motor plays a very vital role in steel industry and there is a strong demand for their reliable and safe operation. The history of fault diagnosis and protection of electrical machines is as old as such machines themselves. However, nowadays, condition monitoring of electrical machines has become increasingly essential. It plays a very important role in their safe operation and helps to avoid heavy production losses in industry. The conditioning monitoring and fault-detection techniques of electrical machines have moved in recent years into artificial intelligence techniques. When an artificial intelligence technique is used, fault detection and evaluation can be accomplished without an expert. In this paper, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are used to build a condition monitoring system that has incremental learning capabilities. The condition-monitoring of dc motor using AI technique schemes have concentrated on sensing specific failure modes in field windings.\n\nElectric Motor Asset Management\n\nElectric Motor Asset ManagementLeonardo ENERGY\n\nElectric motors are available for a wide range of applications and in a variety of power outputs. They are the ideal drivers for a huge number of operations. Electric motors are the primary mover for a vast majority of industrial and tertiary sector activities. Some motors are visible as a separate entity; others are built into boxed applications such as air compressors, heat pumps, water pumps, and fans. Electric motors account for approximately 65% of the electricity consumed by EU industry. Despite their importance, they are rarely viewed as a production asset in their own right. However, they should be since the manner in which they are purchased, maintained, and replaced can make a major difference in profitability. When motors are not managed optimally, the result is higher energy losses and—even more significantly—a reduced reliability and availability at the production site. Early replacement of electric motors is a rare practice. In most companies, motors run to failure. Once failure occurs, they are repaired or replaced as quickly as possible. Replacement typically takes place without considering more than the basic technical requirements. A more detailed look at all cost factors reveals however, that an early replacement of an electric motor is often paid back in a very short time. This payback is fed by improved energy efficiency, by reduced maintenance costs, and by avoiding unplanned outages and their associated losses. Electric motors are a forgotten asset. By making them subject of a full asset management programme, companies can improve their performance and gain a competitive advantage.\n\nPower distribution system fault monitoring device for supply networks in Nigeria\n\nPower distribution system fault monitoring device for supply networks in NigeriaIJECEIAES\n\nElectric power is the bedrock of our modern way of life. In Nigeria, power supply availability, sufficiency and reliability are major operational challenges. At the generation and transmission level, effort is made to ensure status monitoring and fault detection on the power network, but at the distribution level, particularly within domestic consumer communities there are no fault monitoring and detection devices except for HRC fuses at the feeder pillar. Unfortunately, these fuses are sometimes replaced by a copper wire bridge at some locations rendering the system unprotected and creating a great potential for transformer destruction on overload. This study is focused on designing an on-site power system monitoring device to be deployed on selected household entry power cables for detecting and indicating when phase off, low voltage, high voltage, over current, and blown fuse occurs on the building’s incomer line. The fault indication will help in reducing troubleshooting time and also ensure quick service restoration. After design implementation, the test result confirms design accuracy, device functionality and suitability as a low-cost solution to power supply system fault monitoring within local communities."
