The following is a sample sequence of screens that appear.\n\nManual Setup If the operating system does not automatically recognize the new USB key, then the drivers can be installed by running the Device Driver setup. On the installation CD in the CopyProtection\\USB Key folder (or downloaded from our website) is a file named Page 7 HASPUserSetup.exe. Double-click on this file. The same set of screens will appear as described in the During Installation section. The files hasp_com_windows.dll and hasp_windows_68889.dll must be copied to the Windows\\System32 folder. The file hasp_com_windows.dll must also be registered. To register the file select Run from the Start menu, enter ‘regsvr32 hasp_com_windows.dll’ (without the quotes) and click OK. You will get a confirmation screen stating that the registration was successful. On a 64-bit operating system these files need to be put in the SysWOW64 folder. Depending on your user permissions you may need to register them using an elevated command prompt (right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator). Support Diagnostics Setup There are several support and diagnostic applications that will be installed. HASPKeyFind has been developed to gather information from the USB key and assist in updating/configuring the key with codes provided by AFT. Two other diagnostic applications are provided by Aladdin. DiagnostX can be used to help troubleshoot the key and afthaspRUS which can be used to remotely update the key. AFT recommends that HASPKeyFind be used as a first step then the others if there are continued problems. During Installation If the Support Diagnostics option is selected to be installed then a message will appear explaining that some support applications are installed by running a separate application. The diagnostics are installed using a setup application provided by Aladdin. Below is a sample sequence of the screens you should encounter. By default it is located in C:\\Program Files\\Aladdin\\DiagnostX Page 8 Manual Setup HASPKeyFind.exe can be copied directly from the CopyProtection\\USB Key folder of the AFT CD or downloaded from our website at /support/usb-key-support. The Aladdin support files can be installed by running the setup manually or copying a file to the hard disk. On the installation CD in the CopyProtection\\USB Key folder (or downloaded from our website) is a file named aksdiag32.exe. Double-click it to launch the installation if the DiagnostX application. The same set of screens will appear as described in the During Installation section. The file custom.dll should be copied from the CD. The file afthasprus.exe can also be copied from the CD. Network License Manager Setup If you are accessing the key over a network then a network license manager must be installed. AFT highly recommends that this be set up as a service. If it is setup as an application, it should be included in the startup folder so that it is automatically running each time the server is restarted. If it is setup as a service, it should always be started. During Installation If a network USB key (red) is being used and the Network License Manager option is selected to be installed then a message will appear explaining that the network license manager is installed by running a separate application.\n\nSeriesCisco ISRRouter Connection TypeWi-FiColorBlackNo Of Antenna2SizeA4\n\nMinimum order quantity: 1 Piece\n\nCisco® 1900 Series Integrated Services Routers build on 25 years of Cisco innovation and product leadership.

The platform is based on MPLS-TP (Multi-protocol Label Switching with Transport Profile) technology that maintains deterministic performance through packet based communications providing utilities with increased efficiency and ease of integration.\n\nThe JunglePAX platform employs an optimized version of MPLS-TP coupled with a SONET/SDH-transport layer to produce a converged communications platform to reliably transport 64 kbps, T1/E1 TDM and Ethernet services across an optical Wide-Area Network (WAN). With a flexible mix of WAN connectivity, access options, and with hardware redundancy on critical modules and control functions, the JunglePAX provide utilities a cost effective, single streamlined solution to better protect energy assets and improve system reliability.\n\nKey Benefits\n\nImprove service quality with a secure and dependable platform that provides reliable communications for utility applications within harsh industrial environments.\n\nMaximize service uptime using specially designed hardware to ensure utility-grade performance through layers of redundancy. Address emerging applications by implementing a flexible and scalable solution to assist with network convergence where traffic and application mix change.\n\nImprove system-wide manageability with integrated and application-driven software that simplifies network management. Increase control and promote information assurance with an advanced cybersecurity platform that employs defense-in-depth strategies.\n\nTeleprotection Application\n\nUtilities are concerned about the impact on critical infrastructure and damage or injury associated with a fault condition on the transmission network. Teleprotection is a critical utility application that enables protection devices to communicate in a coordinated, reliable and expeditious way. Distance or directional comparison relays that send tripping signals require deterministic communications with low propagation delay edge (substation) to edge (substation), often as low as within 8ms. The faster the tripping signal can be transmitted across network, the quicker the dangerous energized state can be removed. Due to their importance, tripping signals cannot tolerate network disturbances affecting availability, capacity, physical communication failures, maintenance related outages or security vulnerabilities.\n\nJunglePAX Solution for Teleprotection\n\nThe JunglePAX platform has been designed for teleprotection applications with layers of redundancy to ensure there is no single point of weakness, industry leading protection switching within 3ms, and low end-to-end service latency within 1ms excluding propagation delay.\n\nBelow is a teleprotection application example, which walks through the sequence of events that the JunglePAX platform would perform to ensure that critical teleprotection circuits are delivered securely and dependably across the network.\n\nApplication Defined Networking\n\nThe Lentronics JunglePAX is ideal for power utility operations and IT applications, supporting the following typical applications:\n\nCritical Operational Traffic (OT)\n\nTeleprotection\n\nEssential Operational Traffic (EOT)\n\nSCADA\n\nMaintenance & Emergency Voice\n\nAsset health and status\n\nCritical Information Traffic (CIT)\n\nSurveillance & Intrusion detection\n\nMetering\n\nEssential Information Traffic (EIT)\n\nBusiness service backhaul\n\nConnecting field offices and mobile users with operational data"
