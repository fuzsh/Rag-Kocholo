        "text": "One of the striking aspects of world-wide-web is how it has empowered ordinary nontechnical people to participate in a digital revolution by transforming the way services such as shopping, education and entertainment are offered and consumed. The proliferation of networked appliances, sensors and actuators, such as those found in digital homes heralds a similar ‘sea change’ in the capabilities of ordinary people to customise and utilise the electronic spaces they inhabit. By coordinating the actions of networked devices or services, it is possible for the environment to behave in a holistic and reactive manner to satisfy the occupants needs; creating an intelligent environment. Further, by deconstructing traditional home appliances into sets of more elemental network accessible services, it is possible to reconstruct either the original appliance or to create new user defined appliances by combining basic network services in novel ways; creating a so called virtual appliance. This principle can be extended to decompose and re-compose software applications allowing users to create their own bespoke applications. Collectively, such user created entities are referred to as Meta –appliances or –applications, more generally abbreviated to MAps. Deconstruction and user customized MAps raise exciting possibilities for occupants of future intelligent environments, and sets significant research challenges. For example, how can MAps be constructed and managed by ordinary non-expert home occupants? At one extreme it is possible to use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and equipment, such as autonomous intelligent agents. These monitor an occupants habitual behaviour, modelling their behaviours, and creating rule-based profiles (self-programming) so they can pre-emptively set the environment to what they anticipate the user would like. However, some people have privacy concerns about what is being recorded, when it is being recorded and to whom (or what) any information is communicated. These concerns are particularly acute with autonomous agents, in which people have little direct control. Such matters are especially sensitive when the technology is used in the private space of someone’s home. Frequently, end-users are given very little choice in setting-up digital home technology and are obliged to accept whatever is offered. Apart from the issues of privacy and trust, we argue that creativity is an essential and distinctive human quality, and that many people would enjoy the process of creating their own novel networked appliances and personalising their ’electronic spaces’, providing they can be shielded from unnecessary technical complexity. This has parallels to the common practice of people decorating their own homes with paintings, walls hangings, pictures, colour schemes and furniture. This rationale has led many researchers to investigate what is termed ‘end-user programming’, a methodology aimed at allowing non-technical people to personalise their own digital spaces with network enabled embedded-computer based devices. Historically, programming has only been accessible to well-qualified professionals, such as computer scientists, or the outcome of self-programming (learning) using autonomous intelligent agents. The challenge for achieving an end-user programming vision is to devise programming methodologies that are usable by non-technical people. This chapter explores these issues and offers some solutions."
