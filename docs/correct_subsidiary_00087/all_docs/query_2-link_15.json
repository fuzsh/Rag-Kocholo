He possesses unique skills having worked as a transactional/M&A attorney at the beginning of his career.’\n\n‘Fernando Dantas is a very strong litigator in the product liability space. Arthur and Fernando are both stellar and my go-to for cases in Brazil.’\n\n‘Excellent service provided.

The firm provides exceptional services, both technically and from a strategic standpoint.’\n\n‘Tomaz Lyra has excellent technical and strategic knowledge.
