        "text": "New credit cards containing Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) chips for enhanced security, and for in-store purchases (rather than online purchases) have been adopted considerably in recent years. EMV supposedly protects the payment cards in such a way that the computer chips in a card referred to as chip-and-pin cards generate a unique one-time code each time the card is used. The one-time code is designed such that if it is copied or stolen from the merchant system or from the system terminal, it cannot be useful for creating a counterfeit copy of that card or counterfeit chip of the transaction. However, in spite of this design, EMV technology is not entirely foolproof from failure. This paper dis-cusses the issues, failures and fraudulent cases associated with EMV Chip-And-Card technology. The work also evaluates peopleâ€™s understanding of these issues and the consequential precautions they take to safeguard their information while using the EMV cards for transactions.\n\nATM cards and systems have changed the lives of people. Now they have access to money all round the clock. This ease of access to money has brought forth a serious problem as well. There has been an increase in the amount of credit card frauds caused due to impersonating as the owner of the card in shops and also obtaining the PIN (Personal Identification Number) of the customer through some illegal means. The system proposed here ensures that only the authorized user can do any kind of banking transactions both in ATMs and in shops. The customers must initiate a transaction request from their mobile phones using the SMS (Short Message Service) feature that is present in all mobile phones. The customer sends a message to the bank server before he actually performs an actual banking transaction. After that he will approach either an ATM system or a shop that accepts card payments. The transaction request is sent to the bank server and hence authenticated."
