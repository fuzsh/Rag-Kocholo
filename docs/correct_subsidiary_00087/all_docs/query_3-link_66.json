Grokking Simplicity is a friendly, practical guide that will change the way you approach software design and development. It introduces a unique approach to functional programming that explains why certain features of software are prone to complexity, and teaches you the functional techniques you can use to simplify these systems so that they’re easier to test and debug.\n\nPurchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.\n\nAbout the technology\n\nDevelopers rightly fear the unintended complexity that infects most code. This book shows you how to write software that keeps complexity close to its inherent minimum. As you write software you should distinguish between code that alters your system’s state, and code that does not. Once you learn to make that distinction, you can refactor much of your state-altering “actions” into stateless “calculations.” Your software will be simpler.\n\nAbout the book\n\nThe book also teaches you to solve the complex timing bugs that inevitably creep into asynchronous and multithreaded code. In ad­vanced sections of the book you learn how composable abstractions help avoid repeating code and open up new levels of expressivity.\n\nWhat's inside\n\nPatterns for simpler code\n\nPowerful time modeling approaches to simplify asynchronous code\n\nHow higher-order functions can make code reusable and composable\n\nAbout the reader\n\nFor intermediate and advanced developers building complex software. Exercises, illustrations, self-assessments, and hands-on examples lock in each new idea.\n\nAbout the author\n\nEric Normand is an expert software developer who has been an influential teacher of functional programming since 2007.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1 Welcome to Grokking Simplicity\n\n2 Functional thinking in action\n\nPART 1 - ACTIONS, CALCULATIONS, AND DATA\n\n3 Distinguishing actions, calculations, and data\n\n4 Extracting calculations from actions\n\n5 Improving the design of actions\n\n6 Staying immutable in a mutable language\n\n7 Staying immutable with untrusted code\n\n8 Stratified design, part 1\n\n9 Stratified design, part 2\n\nPART 2 - FIRST-CLASS ABSTRACTIONS\n\n10 First-class functions, part 1\n\n11 First-class functions, part 2\n\n12 Functional iteration\n\n13 Chaining functional tools\n\n14 Functional tools for nested data\n\n15 Isolating timelines\n\n16 Sharing resources between timelines\n\n17 Coordinating timelines\n\n18 Reactive and onion architectures\n\n19 The functional journey ahead\n\nLanguageEnglishAuthorAlan J.

It all points to a world that is getting faster at a dizzying pace.\n\nAzeem Azhar, renowned technology analyst and host of the Exponential View podcast, offers a revelatory new model for understanding how technology is evolving so fast, and why it fundamentally alters the world. He roots his analysis in the idea of an “exponential gap” in which technological developments rapidly outpace our society’s ability to catch up. Azhar shows that this divide explains many problems of our time—from political polarization to ballooning inequality to unchecked corporate power. With stunning clarity of vision, he delves into how the exponential gap is a near-inevitable consequence of the rise of AI, automation, and other exponential technologies, like renewable energy, 3D printing, and synthetic biology, which loom over the horizon.\n\nAnd he offers a set of policy solutions that can prevent the growing exponential gap from fragmenting, weakening, or even destroying our societies. The result is a wholly new way to think about technology, one that will transform our understanding of the economy, politics, and the future.\n\nLanguageEnglishAuthorRichard A.

Layered Landscapes Lofoten, Understanding of Complexity, Otherness and Change aims to challenge internalized concepts about how landscapes are considered and investigated, to open for alternative research, and legitimize subjective, singular and experimental approaches as valid and appreciated as a foundation for an informed process. These approaches take into consideration both the landscape and the practices taking place in the landscape, that are consistently full of individual and collective stories and experiences―the complexity created in both time and space, which influences our societies not only as traces of historical events, but as present realities and even expectations and what is to become. Under the concepts of complexity, imbrication, vulnerability, fieldwork, flexibility and reorientation ideas are developed, all based in the contemporary and historic layers of the dramatic and contested landscapes of the Lofoten Islands in Northern Norway―where pressure from political decisions and structural changes, increasing tourism, a potential new oil industry and uncontrollable global forces’ impact on nature and societies and cause continuous transformation and alteration of landscapes and topography, surrounding the traditional and modern fishing communities.\n\nGenreFictionName Of BookFinding Rest in Illusion English, Hardcover BookAuthorLongchenpa (Author), Padmakara Translation Group (Translator)LanguageEnglishBook NameFinding Rest in the Nature of the Mind: The Trilogy of Rest, Volume 1 (Trilogy of Rest, 1) PaperbackPositionNewCalendar StandsJanuary 8, 2019YearJanuary 8, 2019Binding TypeHardcoverMaterialBookPages336 pagesSize5.8 x 1.03 x 8.79 inches\n\nMinimum order quantity: 1 Piece\n\nA new translation of the Tibetan master Longchenpa’s famous work that systematically presents the path of yogic conduct according to the Dzogchen tradition\n\nFinding Rest in Illusion is the third volume of the Trilogy of Rest, Longchenpa’s classic exposition of the Buddhist path. The purpose of these teachings is to introduce us to our most basic nature—the clear and pristine awareness that is the nature of the mind. According to the traditional Tibetan Buddhist formula of view, meditation, and action, this volume follows Finding Rest in the Nature of the Mind, which establishes the view of the Buddhist path generally, and specifically that of the teachings of the Great Perfection, and Finding Rest in Meditation, which outlines the main points of meditation, namely, where one should meditate, what qualities a practitioner should possess and develop, and what should be practiced.\n\nThe Padmakara Translation Group has provided us with a clear and fluid new translation of the final volume of the trilogy, Finding Rest in Illusion, along with its autocommentary, The Chariot of Excellence, both intended to elucidate the appropriate action of a Buddhist practitioner. Finding Rest in Illusion describes in detail the conduct of those who have stabilized their recognition of the nature of the mind and how to apply the Buddhist view when relating to ordinary appearances. Drawing extensively from classic Buddhist works, the author uses well-known examples of illusion found throughout Mahāyāna literature to illustrate the illusory nature of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, thus revealing their ultimate nondual nature. This is an invaluable manual for any genuine student of Buddhism who wishes to truly find rest through the path of the Great Perfection.\n\nName Of BookAdvanced Digital Design with the Verilog HDL, 2/e Paperback BookAuthorD.

QasimLanguageEnglishName Of BookWASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS : PLANNING DESIGN AND OPERATION Paperback BookMaterialBookPositionNewCalendar StandsNovember 22, 2017YearNovember 22, 2017\n\nMinimum order quantity: 1 Piece\n\nStep-by-step procedures for planning, design, construction and operation:\n\n* Health and environment\n\n* Process improvements\n\n* Stormwater and combined sewer control and treatment\n\n* Effluent disposal and reuse\n\n* Biosolids disposal and reuse\n\n* On-site treatment and disposal of small flows\n\n* Wastewater treatment plants should be designed so that the effluent standards and reuse objectives, and biosolids regulations can be met with reasonable ease and cost. The design should incorporate flexibility for dealing with seasonal changes, as well as long-term changes in wastewater quality and future regulations. Good planning and design, therefore, must be based on five major steps:\n\ncharacterization of the raw wastewater quality and effluent,\n\npre-design studies to develop alternative processes and selection of final process train,\n\ndetailed design of the selected alternative,\n\ncontraction, and\n\noperation and maintenance of the completed facility.\n\nEngineers, scientists, and financial analysts must utilize principles from a wide range of disciplines: engineering, chemistry, microbiology, geology, architecture, and economics to carry out the responsibilities of designing a wastewater treatment plant. The objective of this book is to present the technical and nontechnical issues that are most commonly addressed in the planning and design reports for wastewater treatment facilities prepared by practicing engineers. Topics discussed include facility planning, process description, process selection logic, mass balance calculations, design calculations, and concepts for equipment sizing. Theory, design, operation and maintenance, trouble shooting, equipment selection and specifications are integrated for each treatment process. Thus delineation of such information for use by students and practicing engineers is the main purpose of this book."
