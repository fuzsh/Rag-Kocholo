In Cocktail Codex, these experts reveal for the first time their surprisingly simple approach to mastering cocktails: the “root recipes,” six easily identifiable (and memorizable!) templates that encompass all cocktails: the old-fashioned, martini, daiquiri, sidecar, whisky highball, and flip. Once you understand the hows and whys of each “family,” you'll understand why some cocktails work and others don't, when to shake and when to stir, what you can omit and what you can substitute when you're missing ingredients, why you like the drinks you do, and what sorts of drinks you should turn to—or invent—if you want to try something new.\n\nPraise for Cocktail Codex\n\n“Learn the template, and any cocktail you can think of is within reach.”—Food & Wine\n\n“Too bad all college textbooks weren’t this much fun.”—Garden & Gun\n\n“A must for amateur and pro mixologists alike.”—Chicago Tribune\n\n“If Dora the Explorer turned twenty-one, split herself into three people, and decided to write the Magna Carta of booze books, this would be the result.

Bank 4. 0 explores the radical transformation already taking place in banking, and follows it to its logical conclusion. What will banking look like in 30 years? 50 years? The world’s best banks have been forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviors; regulators are rethinking friction, licensing and regulation; Fintech start-ups and tech giants are redefining how banking fits in the daily life of consumers. To survive, banks are having to develop new capabilities, new jobs and new skills. The future of banking is not just about new thinking around value stores, payment and credit utility — it’s embedded in voice-based smart assistants like Alexa and Siri and soon smart glasses which will guide you on daily spending and money decisions. The coming Bank 4. 0 era is one where either your bank is embedded in your world via tech, or it no longer exists. In this final volume in Brett King’s BANK series, we explore the future of banks amidst the evolution of technology and discover a revolution already at work. From re-engineered banking systems, to selfie-pay and self-driving cars, Bank 4. 0 proves that we’re not on Wall Street anymore. Bank 4. 0 will help you: Understand the historical precedents that flag a fundamental rethinking in banking Discover low-friction, technology experiences that undermine the products we sell today Think through the evolution of identity, value and assets as cash and cards become obsolete Learn how Fintech and tech “disruptors” are using behaviour, psychology and technology to reshape the economics of banking Examine the ways in which blockchain, A.

When the biggest bank in the world isn’t any of the names you’d expect, when branch networks are a burden not an asset, and when advice is the domain of Artificial Intelligence, we may very well have to start from scratch. Bank 4. 0 takes you to a world where banking will be instant, smart and ubiquitous, and where you’ll have to adapt faster than ever before just to survive.

At its beginnings in the 1870s were dynamite, the telephone, photographic film, and the first light bulbs. Its peak decade - the astonishing 1880s - brought electricity - generating plants, electric motors, steam turbines, the gramophone, cars, aluminum production, air-filled rubber tires, and prestressed concrete. And its post-1900 period saw the first airplanes, tractors, radio signals and plastics, neon lights and assembly line production. This book is a systematic interdisciplinary account of the history of this outpouring of European and American intellect and of its truly epochal consequences. It takes a close look at four fundamental classes of these epoch-making innovations: formation, diffusion, and standardization of electric\n\nsystems; invention and rapid adoption of internal combustion engines; the unprecedented pace of new chemical syntheses and material substitutions; and the birth of a new information age. These chapters are followed by an evaluation of the lasting impact these advances had on the 20th century, that is, the creation of high-energy societies engaged in mass production aimed at improving standards of living.\n\nGenreBusinessName Of BookCompeting in the New World of Work Hardcover BookAuthorKeith Ferrazzi (Author), Kian Gohar (Author), Noel Weyrich (Author)LanguageEnglishBook NameCompeting in the New World of Work Hardcover BookBinding TypeHardcoverMaterialBook\n\nMinimum order quantity: 1 Piece\n\nA Wall Street Journal bestseller\n\nThe #1 New York Times bestselling author on how to use radical adaptability to win in a world of unprecedented change.\n\nYou've shed antiquated systems and processes.

At the same time, many have lost their hard-earned money trying to invest in financial assets, including debt and equities. Such losses have occurred due to many reasons, such as corporate frauds, weak business models and misallocation of capital by the companies in whose shares unsuspecting investors parked their savings. What options do Indian savers then have to invest in, and build their wealth?\n\nDiamonds in the Dust offers Indian savers a simple, yet highly effective, investment technique to identify clean, well-managed Indian companies that have consistently generated outsized returns for investors. Based on in-depth research conducted by the award-winning team at Marcellus Investment Managers, it uses case studies and charts to help readers learn the art and science of investing in the US$3 trillion Indian stock market.

Forged from passionate life experiences and the arduous journey of experiential mathematical learning, these poems lie at an unexpected crossroads: one which challenges the notion of separation between the intellectual stimulus provided by mathematics and experiences provoking deeply felt emotions. Placing a “favorite color” on a different footing than a “favorite mathematical object” is a controversy rather than an accepted reality in these verses. With topics ranging from elementary mathematics to advanced concepts from abstract algebra, statistics, real and complex analysis, and topology, these poems delineate the powerful emotions evoked throughout the experiential learning of celebrated theorems and concepts in mathematics. Using the language of mathematics, these poems take the reader through a surprising range of emotions and provoke deep philosophical contemplation. With mathematical and emotional context provided by the author for each poem, this poetry book caters to a wide audience, from the average intellectually curious high schooler, to seasoned members of the scientific community. A unique literary experiment, cloaked in philosophical revelation and shaped by mathematical insights, Abstract Intersections provides a profoundly original alternative in facing the challenges of life and mathematics, one where each is mirrored in the other.\n\nName Of BookPass the Pig: Leadership by Attraction Paperback BookAuthorAnne Lakusta (Author),Jeff Lakusta (Author)LanguageEnglishMaterialBookPositionNewCalendar StandsDecember 24,2020YearDecember 24,2020\n\nMinimum order quantity: 1 Piece\n\nWall Street Journal Bestseller\n\nUSA Today Bestseller\n\nForcing people and results is less effective than attracting them.

Though there are political and ideological differences between these two entities, it may not hamper the strong bond as there are many common shared values among these nations. The history of these nations identifies that the cooperation between them in terms of trade and commerce is not upheld per the given potential of these nations. In the past, the Indian economy was linked with Southeast Asian countries under the \"Look East\" policy, which has been re-energized again under the present government. Now, the \"Look East\" policy is practically more vibrant than ever before with the motto \"Act East.\" This policy facilitates these countries in emphasizing the importance of better regional connectivity for tourism as well as robust trade and commerce. It leads to a phenomenal growth in terms of imports and exports for these countries. Evaluating Trade and Economic Relations Between India and Southeast Asia sheds light on the trade and economic linkages between India and Southeast Asia and their impact on the nations in the past, present, and for the future. The chapters study whether the win-win strategy works for the strengthening of these countries in terms of both trade relations and political integrity, as well as in facing common enemies across international boundaries. Some of the topics covered include food security, tourism opportunities, trade blocs, trade relations, and economic relations between countries. This book is a valuable reference tool for economists, government officials, policymakers, trade analysts, practitioners, researchers, academicians, and students interested in the policies and relations between India and Southeast Asia that affect trade and the economy.\n\nName Of BookResearch Handbook on International Drug Policy Hardcover BookAuthorDavid R.
