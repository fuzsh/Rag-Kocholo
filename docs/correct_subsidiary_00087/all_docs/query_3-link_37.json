        "text": "Recent research on anidolic daylighting systems: highly reflective coating materials and chronobiological properties\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLinhart, Friedrich; Wittkopf, Stephen K.; MÃ¼nch, Mirjam; Scartezzini, Jean-Louis\n\n2009-08-01\n\nMaking daylight more available in buildings is highly desirable for reasons of energy efficiency, visual comfort, occupant well-being and health. The Anidolic Integrated Ceiling (AIC) is a highly efficient daylighting system, designed to gather and redirect daylight from the outside of a building into its interior with minimal losses. The reflective coating materials used within AICs have a major impact on the optical efficiency of such systems. The first part of our article presents a new computer model of an AIC consisting of more than 30 distinct components. We discuss on which of them the use of expensive, highly reflective coatings makes the most sense. We conclude that coating the component \"Anidolic element 1\" is always a good choice and that considerable financial savings can be obtained by following an appropriate optimization sequence.The second part of our article discusses chronobiological properties of Anidolic Daylighting Systems (ADS). We recorded daytime irradiance values for several weeks from March to May 2009 in an experimental office setup in our laboratory using a portable digital spectroradiometer. Our results showed to which extent different sky conditions influenced daylight exposure of office workers in an ADS-equipped office room. We conclude that for the tested ADS-equipped office room, daylight supply can be considered largely sufficient during long periods on most working days. However, complementary artificial lighting with blue-enriched polychromatic fluorescent tubes might be useful on days with predominantly overcast skies as well as before 09:00 and after 16:30 on all days.\n\nMinimizing lighting power density in office rooms equipped with Anidolic Daylighting Systems\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLinhart, Friedrich; Scartezzini, Jean-Louis\n\n2010-04-15\n\nElectric lighting is responsible for up to one third of an office building's electricity needs. Making daylight more available in office buildings can not only contribute to significant energy savings but also enhance the occupants' performance and wellbeing. Anidolic Daylighting Systems (ADS) are one type of very effective facade-integrated daylighting systems. All south-facing office rooms within the LESO solar experimental building in Lausanne (Switzerland) are equipped with a given type of ADS. A recent study has shown that these offices' occupants are highly satisfied with their lighting environment. The most energy-efficient south-facing offices have a lighting power density of lessmoreÂ Â» than 5W/m{sup 2}. The lighting situation within these ''best practice''-offices has been assessed using the lighting simulation software RELUX Vision. Because this lighting situation is very much appreciated by the occupants, it was used as a starting point for developing even more energy-efficient office lighting designs. Two new lighting designs, leading to lighting power densities of 3.9W/m{sup 2} and 3W/m{sup 2}, respectively, have been suggested and simulated with RELUX Vision. Simulation results have shown that the expected performances of these new systems are comparable to that of the current lighting installation within the ''best practice''-offices or even better. These simulation results have been confirmed during experiments on 20 human subjects in a test office room recently set up within the LESO building. This article gives engineers, architects and light planers valuable information and ideas on how to design energy-efficient and comfortable electric lighting systems in office rooms with abundant access to daylight.

Making daylight more available in office and commercial buildings can lead as a consequence to important electricity savings, as well as to the improvement of occupants' visual performance and wellbeing. Over the last decades, daylighting technologies have been developed for that purpose, some of them having proven to be highly efficient such as anidolic daylighting systems. Based on non-imaging optics these optical devices were designed to achieve an efficient collection and redistribution of daylight within deep office rooms. However in order to benefit from the substantial daylight provision obtained through these systems and convert it into effective electricity savings, novel electric lighting strategies are required. An optimal integration of high efficacy light sources and efficient luminaries based on non-imaging optics with anidolic daylighting systems can lead to such novel strategies. Starting from the experience gained through the development of an Anidolic Integrated Ceiling (AIC), this paper presents an optimal integrated daylighting and electric lighting system. Computer simulations based on ray-tracing techniques were used to achieve the integration of 36W fluorescent tubes and non-imaging reflectors with an advanced daylighting system. Lighting power densities lower than 4 W/m2 can be achieved in this way within the corresponding office room. On-site monitoring of an integrated daylighting and electric lighting system carried out on a solar experimental building confirmed the energy and visual performance of such a system: it showed that low lighting power densities can be achieved by combining an anidolic daylighting system with very efficient electric light sources and luminaries.\n\nHeliostat design for the daylighting system.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Chih-Hung; Hsiso, Horng-Ching; Chang, Cheng-Ming; Wang, Chen-You; Lin, Tzung-Han; Chen, Yi-Yung; Lai, Yi-Lung; Yen, Cho-Jung; Chen, Kuan-Yu; Whang, Allen Jong-Woei\n\n2014-10-10\n\nThe daylighting system is designed to guide sunlight into buildings for illumination. It has the best illumination performance when sunlight vertically impinges on the collector of the daylighting system, while it has low performance when sunlight impinges obliquely. To overcome the problem, this paper investigates the design of a heliostat that reflects sunlight vertically onto a daylighting system. This study proposes a 3Ã3 mirror matrix heliostat, which is different from the traditional heliostat with one single mirror. With the heliostat, the system efficiency increases as high as 3.32 times.\n\nADASY (Active Daylighting System)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVÃ¡zquez-MolinÃ­, Daniel; GonzÃ¡lez-Montes, Mario; FernÃ¡ndez-Balbuena, Antonio Ã.; BernabÃ©u, Eusebio; GarcÃ­a-Botella, Ãngel; GarcÃ­a-RodrÃ­guez, Lucas; Pohl, Wilfried\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThe main objective of ADASY (Active Daylighting System) work is to design a faÃ§ade static daylighting system oriented to office applications, mainly. The goal of the project is to save energy by guiding daylight into a building for lighting purpose. With this approach we can reduce the electrical load for artificial lighting, completing it with sustainable energy. The collector of the system is integrated on a vertical faÃ§ade and its distribution guide is always horizontal inside of the false ceiling. ADASY is designed with a specific patent pending caption system, a modular light-guide and light extractor luminaire system. Special care has been put on the final cost of the system and its building integration purpose. The current ADASY configuration is able to illuminate 40 m2 area with a 300lx-400lx level in the mid time work hours; furthermore it has a good enough spatial uniformity distribution and a controlled glare. The data presented in this study are the result of simulation models and have been confirmed by a physical scaled prototype. ADASY's main advantages over regular illumination systems are: -Low maintenance; it has not mobile pieces and therefore it lasts for a long time and require little attention once installed. - No energy consumption; solar light continue working even if there has been a power outage. - High quality of light: the colour rendering of light is very high - Psychological benefits: People working with daylight get less stress and more comfort, increasing productivity. - Health benefits\n\nEffect of dividing daylight in symmetric prismatic daylight collector\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYeh, Shih-Chuan; Lu, Ju-Lin; Cheng, Yu-Chin\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis paper presented a symmetric prismatic daylight collector to collect daylight for the natural light illumination system. We analyzed the characteristics of the emerging light when the parallel light beam illuminate on the horizontally placed symmetric prismatic daylight collector. The ratio of the relative intensities of collected daylight that emerging from each surface of the daylight collector shown that the ratio is varied with the incident angle during a day. The simulation of the emerging light of the daylight collector shown that the ratio of emerging light is varied with the tilted angle when sunshine illuminated on a symmetric prismatic daylight collector which was not placed horizontally. The integration of normalized intensity is also varied with the tilted angle. The symmetric prismatic daylight collector with the benefits of reducing glare and dividing intensity of incident daylight, it is applicable to using in the natural light illumination system and hybrid system for improving the efficiency of utilizing of solar energy.\n\nHybrid daylight/light-emitting diode illumination system for indoor lighting.\n\nPubMed\n\nGe, Aiming; Qiu, Peng; Cai, Jinlin; Wang, Wei; Wang, Junwei\n\n2014-03-20\n\nA hybrid illumination method using both daylight and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for indoor lighting is presented in this study. The daylight can be introduced into the indoor space by a panel-integration system. The daylight part and LEDs are combined within a specific luminaire that can provide uniform illumination. The LEDs can be turned on and dimmed through closed-loop control when the daylight illuminance is inadequate. We simulated the illumination and calculated the indoor lighting efficiency of our hybrid daylight and LED lighting system, and compared this with that of LED and fluorescent lighting systems. Simulation results show that the efficiency of the hybrid daylight/LED illumination method is better than that of LED and traditional lighting systems, under the same lighting conditions and lighting time; the method has hybrid lighting average energy savings of T5 66.28%, and that of the LEDs is 41.62%.\n\nLighting system combining daylight concentrators and an artificial source\n\nDOEpatents\n\nBornstein, Jonathan G.; Friedman, Peter S.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA combined lighting system for a building interior includes a stack of luminescent solar concentrators (LSC), an optical conduit made of preferably optical fibers for transmitting daylight from the LSC stack, a collimating lens set at an angle, a fixture for receiving the daylight at one end and for distributing the daylight as illumination inside the building, an artificial light source at the other end of the fixture for directing artifical light into the fixture for distribution as illumination inside the building, an automatic dimmer/brightener for the artificial light source, and a daylight sensor positioned near to the LSC stack for controlling the automatic dimmer/brightener in response to the daylight sensed. The system also has a reflector positioned behind the artificial light source and a fan for exhausting heated air out of the fixture during summer and for forcing heated air into the fixture for passage into the building interior during winter.\n\nA sensor-less LED dimming system based on daylight harvesting with BIPV systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoo, Seunghwan; Kim, Jonghun; Jang, Cheol-Yong; Jeong, Hakgeun\n\n2014-01-13\n\nArtificial lighting in office buildings typically requires 30% of the total energy consumption of the building, providing a substantial opportunity for energy savings. To reduce the energy consumed by indoor lighting, we propose a sensor-less light-emitting diode (LED) dimming system using daylight harvesting. In this study, we used light simulation software to quantify and visualize daylight, and analyzed the correlation between photovoltaic (PV) power generation and indoor illumination in an office with an integrated PV system. In addition, we calculated the distribution of daylight illumination into the office and dimming ratios for the individual control of LED lights. Also, we were able directly to use the electric power generated by PV system. As a result, power consumption for electric lighting was reduced by 40 - 70% depending on the season and the weather conditions. Thus, the dimming system proposed in this study can be used to control electric lighting to reduce energy use cost-effectively and simply.\n\nLunar Daylight Exploration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGriffin, Brand Norman\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWith 1 rover, 2 astronauts and 3 days, the Apollo 17 Mission covered over 30 km, setup 10 scientific experiments and returned 110 kg of samples. This is a lot of science in a short time and the inspiration for a barebones, return-to-the-Moon strategy called Daylight Exploration. The Daylight Exploration approach poses an answer to the question, What could the Apollo crew have done with more time and today s robotics? In contrast to more ambitious and expensive strategies that create outposts then rely on pressurized rovers to drive to the science sites, Daylight Exploration is a low-overhead approach conceived to land near the scientific site, conduct Apollo-like exploration then leave before the sun goes down. A key motivation behind Daylight Exploration is cost reduction, but it does not come at the expense of scientific exploration. As a goal, Daylight Exploration provides access to the top 10 science sites by using the best capabilities of human and robotic exploration. Most science sites are within an equatorial band of 26 degrees latitude and on the Moon, at the equator, the day is 14 Earth days long; even more important, the lunar night is 14 days long. Human missions are constrained to 12 days because the energy storage systems required to operate during the lunar night adds mass, complexity and cost. In addition, short missions are beneficial because they require fewer consumables, do not require an airlock, reduce radiation exposure, minimize the dwell-time for the ascent and orbiting propulsion systems and allow a low-mass, campout accommodations. Key to Daylight Exploration is the use of piloted rovers used as tele-operated science platforms. Rovers are launched before or with the crew, and continue to operate between crew visits analyzing and collecting samples during the lunar daylight\n\nField Commissioning of a Daylight-Dimming Lighting System.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFloyd, David B.; Parker, Danny S.\n\nA Florida elementary school cafeteria, retrofitted with a fluorescent lighting system that dims in response to available daylight, was evaluated through real time measurement of lighting and air conditioning power, work plane illumination, and interior/exterior site conditions.

No such application of this class of techniques, optimally combining mathematical-modeling and physical-modeling experimentation, is known to the author previously in the literature. Daylighting systems in buildings have a large impact on both the energy usage of a building as well as the occupant experience within a space. As such, a renewed interest has been placed on designing and constructing buildings with an emphasis on daylighting in recent times as part of the \"green movement.''. Within daylighting systems, a specific subclass of building envelope is receiving much attention: complex fenestration systems (CFSs). CFSs are unique as compared to regular fenestration systems (e.g. glazing) in the regard that they allow for non-specular transmission of daylight into a space. This non-specular nature can be leveraged by designers to \"optimize'' the times of the day and the days of the year that daylight enters a space. Examples of CFSs include: Venetian blinds, woven fabric shades, and prismatic window coatings. In order to leverage the non-specular transmission properties of CFSs, however, engineering analysis techniques capable of faithfully representing the physics of these systems are needed. Traditionally, the analysis techniques available to the daylighting community fall broadly into three classes: simplified techniques, mathematical-modeling and simulation, and physical-modeling and experimentation. Simplified techniques use \"rules-of-thumb'' heuristics to provide insights for simple daylighting systems. Mathematical-modeling and simulation use complex numerical models to provide more detailed insights into system performance. Finally, physical-models can be instrumented and excited using artificial and natural light sources to provide performance insight into a daylighting system\n\nThe design and evaluation of three advanced daylighting systems: Light shelves, light pipes and skylights\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBeltran, L.O.; Lee, E.S.; Papmichael, K.M.\n\n1994-03-01\n\nWe present results from the design and evaluation of three advanced daylighting systems: a light shelf, a light pipe, and a skylight. These systems use optical films and an optimized geometry to passively intercept and redirect sunlight further into the building. The objectives of these designs are to increase daylighting illuminance levels at distances of 4.6-9.1 m (15--30 ft) from the window, and to improve the uniformity of the daylight distribution and the luminance gradient across the room under variable sun and sky conditions throughout the year. The designs were developed through a series of computer-assisted ray-tracing studies, photometric measurements,moreÂ Â» and observations using physical scale models. Comprehensive sets of laboratory measurements in combination with analytical routines were then used to simulate daylight performance for any solar position. Results show increased daylight levels and an improved luminance gradient throughout the year -- indicating that lighting energy consumption and cooling energy due of lighting can be substantially reduced with improvements to visual comfort. Future development of the designs may further improve the daylighting performance of these systems.Â«Â less\n\nPredicting energy savings attributed to daylighting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRobbins, C. L.\n\n1982-08-01\n\nA method is described for estimating a building's energy savings attributed to daylighting by predicting the percentage of the year that the electric lighting system is not in use. This depends on the particular control strategy chosen, a standard work year, and the amount of light (as a daylight factor) reaching on daylight and sunlight availability for selected cities in the United States.\n\nHolographic daylighting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLudman, Jacques E.; Riccobono, Juanita R.; Savant, Gajendra D.; Jannson, Joanna L.; Campbell, Eugene W.; Hall, Robyn\n\n1995-09-01\n\nDaylighting techniques are an effective means of reducing both lighting and cooling costs; however, many of the standard techniques have flaws which reduce their effectiveness. Daylighting holograms are an efficient and effective method for diffracting sunlight up onto the ceiling, deep in a room, without diffracting the light at eye-level. They need only cover the top half of a window to produce significant energy savings. They may be used as part of a new glazing system or as a retrofit to existing windows. These holograms are broadband and are able to passively track the movement of the sun across the sky, throughout the day and year.\n\nLuminescent Solar Concentrator Daylighting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBornstein, Jonathan G.\n\n1984-11-01\n\nVarious systems that offer potential solutions to the problem of interior daylighting have been discussed in the literature. Virtually all of these systems rely on some method of tracking the sun along its azimuth and elevation, i.e., direct imaging of the solar disk. A simpler approach, however, involves a nontracking nonimaging device that effectively eliminates moving parts and accepts both the diffuse and direct components of solar radiation. Such an approach is based on a system that combines in a common luminaire the light emitted by luminescent solar concentrators (LSC), of the three primary colors, with a highly efficient artificial point source (HID metal halide) that automatically compensates for fluctuations in the LSC array via a daylight sensor and dimming ballast. A preliminary analysis suggests that this system could supply 90% of the lighting requirement, over the course of an 8 hour day, strictly from the daylight component under typical insolation con-ditions in the Southwest United States. In office buildings alone, the total aggregate energy savings may approach a half a quad annually. This indicates a very good potential for the realization of substantial savings in building electric energy consumption.\n\nDaylighting and shuttering: RIB system mechanical design and preliminary performance data\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKinney, L.; Reynolds, D.\n\n1983-12-01\n\nThe Reflective, Insulating Blind (RIB) system is a flexible, user-controlled daylighting device which also has direct thermal advantages: it can reject a considerable portion of summer sun while still retaining an adequate daylighting function; and it functions as moveable insulation to significantly decrease thermal losses through fenestration during evening hours. The conceptual design of the RIB system was accomplished by Barnes and Shapira at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Mechanical design and prototype fabrication was accomplished by the authors and 29 systems were installed immediately inside existing south-facing windows of an energy-efficient office and dormitory at ORNL. The buildingmoreÂ Â» is a heavily-instrumented, passively-solar-heated structure for which reliable performance data was gathered and analyzed before the addition of RIB systems, thus facilitating the interpretation of ''after RIB'' performance data.Â«Â less\n\nPredicting energy savings attributed to daylighting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRobbins, C.

This method depends upon the particular control stragegy chosen, a standard work year, and the amount of light (as a daylight factor, DF) reaching any given station in the building.\n\nOptimizing indoor illumination quality and energy efficiency using a spectrally tunable lighting system to augment natural daylight.\n\nPubMed\n\nHertog, W; Llenas, A; Carreras, J\n\n2015-11-30\n\nThis article demonstrates the benefits of complementing a daylight-lit environment with a spectrally tunable illumination system. The spectral components of daylight present in the room are measured by a low-cost miniature spectrophotometer and processed through a number of optimization algorithms, carefully trading color fidelity for energy efficiency. Spectrally-tunable luminaires provide only those wavelengths that ensure that either the final illumination spectrum inside the room is kept constant or carefully follows the dynamic spectral pattern of natural daylight. Analyzing the measured data proves that such a hybrid illumination system brings both unprecendented illumination quality and significant energy savings.\n\nDaylighting in Schools: An Investigation into the Relationship between Daylighting and Human Performance.

Highly efficient, strategically placed windows maximize the use of natural daylight in a building, lowering the need for artificial lighting without causing heating or cooling problems.\n\nModified optical fiber daylighting system with sunlight transportation in free space.\n\nPubMed\n\nVu, Ngoc-Hai; Pham, Thanh-Tuan; Shin, Seoyong\n\n2016-12-26\n\nWe present the design, optical simulation, and experiment of a modified optical fiber daylighting system (M-OFDS) for indoor lighting. The M-OFDS is comprised of three sub-systems: concentration, collimation, and distribution. The concentration part is formed by coupling a Fresnel lens with a large-core plastic optical fiber. The sunlight collected by the concentration sub-system is propagated in a plastic optical fiber and then collimated by the collimator, which is a combination of a parabolic mirror and a convex lens. The collimated beam of sunlight travels in free space and is guided to the interior by directing flat mirrors, where it is diffused uniformly by a distributor. All parameters of the system are calculated theoretically. Based on the designed system, our simulation results demonstrated a maximum optical efficiency of 71%. The simulation results also showed that sunlight could be delivered to the illumination destination at distance of 30 m. A prototype of the M-OFDS was fabricated, and preliminary experiments were performed outdoors. The simulation results and experimental results confirmed that the M-OFDS was designed effectively. A large-scale system constructed by several M-OFDSs is also proposed. The results showed that the presented optical fiber daylighting system is a strong candidate for an inexpensive and highly efficient application of solar energy in buildings.\n\nDaylighting Makes a Difference.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHeschong, Lisa; Knecht, Carey\n\n2002-01-01\n\nExamined the role of daylight in student achievement in three schools and found a uniformly positive and statistically significant correlation between the presence of more daylight and better student test scores.

(EV)\n\nFrom dark to bright: novel daylighting applications in solid state lighting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdler, Helmar G.\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe term \"daylighting\" is used in various ways, on one hand in a more architectural sense, i.e. using existing daylight to illuminate spaces, and on the other, more recently, for using light sources to replicate daylight. The emergence of solid state lighting (SSL) opens up a large number of new avenues for daylighting. SSL allows innovative controllability of intensity and color for artificial light sources that can be advantageously applied to daylighting. With the assistance of these new technologies the combination of natural and artificial lighting could lead to improvements in energy savings and comfort of living beings. Thus it is imperative to revisit or even improve daylighting research so that building networks of the future with their sensor, energy (e.g. HVAC) and lighting requirements can benefit from the emerging capabilities. This paper will briefly review existing daylighting concepts and technology and discuss new ideas. An example of a tunable multi-color SSL system will be shown.\n\nDaylight Makes a Difference: Daylight in the Classroom Can Boost Standardized Test Scores and Learning.

Consideration has been given to factors such as field of view and spectral width, to cut down the deleterious effect from background light levels. Suitable optical sources such as lasers and RCLEDs have been investigated as well as optimal wavelength choices, always with a view to building a compact and robust system. The implementation of background reduction measures resulted in a system capable of operating in daylight conditions. An autonomous system was left running and generating shared key material continuously for over 7 days.\n\nMeasured daylighting potential of a static optical louver system under real sun and sky conditions\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nKonis, Kyle; Lee, Eleanor S.\n\n2015-05-04\n\nSide-by-side comparisons were made over solstice-to-solstice changes in sun and sky conditions between an optical louver system (OLS) and a conventional Venetian blind set at a horizontal slat angle and located inboard of a south-facing, small-area, clerestory window in a full-scale office testbed. Daylight autonomy (DA), window luminance, and ceiling luminance uniformity were used to assess performance. The performance of both systems was found to have significant seasonal variation, where performance under clear sky conditions improved as maximum solar altitude angles transitioned from solstice to equinox. Although the OLS produced fewer hours per day of DA on average than themoreÂ Â» Venetian blind, the OLS never exceeded the designated 2000 cd/m2 threshold for window glare. In contrast, the Venetian blind was found to exceed the visual discomfort threshold over a large fraction of the day during equinox conditions. Notably, these peak periods of visual discomfort occurred during the best periods of daylighting performance. Luminance uniformity was analyzed using calibrated high dynamic range luminance images. Under clear sky conditions, the OLS was found to increase the luminance of the ceiling as well as produce a more uniform distribution. Furthermore, compared to conventional venetian blinds, the static optical sunlight redirecting system studied has the potential to significantly reduce the annual electrical lighting energy demand of a daylit space and improve the quality from the perspective of building occupants by consistently transmitting useful daylight while eliminating window glare.Â«Â less\n\nDaylight and absenteeism--evidence from Norway.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarkussen, Simen; RÃ¸ed, Knut\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBased on administrative register data from Norway, we examine the impact of hours of daylight on sick-leave absences among workers. Our preferred estimates imply that an additional hour of daylight increases the daily entry rate to absenteeism by 0.5 percent and the corresponding recovery rate by 0.8 percent, ceteris paribus. The overall relationship between absenteeism and daylight hours is negative. Absenteeism is also sensitive to weather conditions. Heavy snowfall raises the incidence of absence during the winter, while warm weather reduces the probability of returning to work during the summer. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Daylight is an energy-free and efficient-cost lighting source. Natural light is the best source for light due to its good quality, which matches the visual response of the human eyes. Daylight positively affects people by providing a sense of liveliness and brightness in the living space. The positive impact of daylight on the building occupants' visual comfort, health and performance is well recognized. However, daylight is not widely utilized to supplement artificial lighting, because there is a lack of information and tools to evaluate daylighting and potentials for energy savings. The efficient utilization of natural lighting will not only affect the interior environment and the occupants' health and performance but also has a direct impact on the building energy performance. Therefore, this paper reviews and discusses the effects of daylighting on the building energy performance mainly in schools and office buildings. This includes lighting energy performance, total energy consumption, cooling load. The methods, which are used to estimate the possible reduction in total energy consumption, are also reviewed in this research paper. Previous studies revealed that a clear reduction can be obtained in the energy consumed by electric lighting, as well as in the total energy end-use when a suitable lighting control system is applied to utilize the available natural light.\n\nConventional and tubular skylights: An evaluation of the daylighting systems at two ACT{sup 2} commercial buildings\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAllen, T.\n\n1997-12-31\n\nAs part of the ACT{sup 2} project, sponsored by a major northern California utility, two occupied single-story commercial buildings were equipped with similar yet different daylighting systems in an effort to reduce electric lighting loads and provide a better workspace. The daylighting system, at the newly constructed 15,000 sq.ft. California State Automobile Association (CSAA) office building in Antioch, California, incorporates skylights with louvers, perforated blinds on the windows, and dimming ballasts which control T8 fluorescent fixtures. At the 7,500 sq.ft. retrofitted Verifone office building in Auburn, California, the building required a different kind of skylight to provide daylighting. Die tomoreÂ Â» the 10 foot attic space on the single-story building, a tubular-type of skylight was installed. The tubular skylight incorporates a long cylinder with a reflective internal surface to direct available sunlight into the workspace through a white diffuser. In addition, T8 fluorescent fixtures were controlled by dimming ballasts and light level controls. Annual lighting energy consumption at the CSAA building was reduced by 32% with a favorable reaction from the occupants. While the occupant response to the lighting at Verifone was generally good, thee were some problems in calibrating the lighting controls, thereby reducing energy savings.Â«Â less\n\nCould Daylight Glare Be Defined Mathematically?Results of Testing the DGIN Method in Japan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNazzal, Ali; Oki, Masato\n\nDiscomfort glare from daylight is a common problem without valid prediction methods so far. A new mathematical DGIN (New Daylight Glare Index) method tries to respond the challenge. This paper reports on experiments carried out in daylit office environment in Japan to test applicability of the method. Slight positive correlation was found between the DGIN and the subjective evaluation. Additionally, a high Ladaptation value together with the small ratio of Lwindow to Ladaptation was obviously experienced sufficient to neutralize the effect of glare discomfort. However, subjective assessments are poor glare indicators and not reliable in testing glare prediction methods. DGIN is a good indicator of daylight glare, and when the DGIN value is analyzed together with the measured illuminance ratios, discomfort glare from daylight can be analyzed in a quantitative manner. The DGIN method could serve architects and lighting designers in testing daylighting systems, and also guide the action of daylight responsive lighting controls.\n\nProject Lateday : The Level of Accidents Under the Effect of Daylight Saving All Year\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1975-10-01\n\nYear-round daylight saving time (YRDST) has recently been observed in the United States.

The main issue is to be able to find these objects autonomously in a set of training images captured under a wide variety of daylight illumination conditions, and to extract their colors to determine color space regions that are representative of the objects' colors and their variations. The work begins by modeling color formation under daylight using the color formation equations and the semi-empirical model of Judd, MacAdam and Wyszecki (CIE daylight model) for representing the typical spectral distributions of daylight. This results in color space regions that serve as prior information in the initial phase of learning which consists in detecting small reliable clusters of pixels having the appropriate colors. These clusters are then expanded by a region growing technique using broader color space regions than those predicted by the model. This is to detect objects in a way that is able to account for color variations which the model cannot due to its limitations. Validation on the detected objects is performed to filter out those that are not of interest and to eliminate unreliable pixel color values extracted from the remaining ones. Detection results using the color space regions determined from color values obtained by this procedure are discussed.\n\nDaylighting Strategies Promote Healthy High Performance Buildings\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGille, Steve\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThere are many reasons to incorporate daylighting into the building or renovation of K-16 learning facilities.

However, due to the availability of inexpensive electricity, natural lighting strategies became insignificant, and been overlooked by designers. With the current concern over rapid increment on electricity cost, many designers now try to revitalized daylighting strategies in buildings. This includes educational buildings. In Malaysian cases, it is a norm that universities; especially during lecture and studio sessions, used artificial lighting throughout the day. Definitely, this is not parallel with the âgreenâ aim made by the Government in the Malaysian Plan. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the impact of daylight strategies for educational studios in universities, by maximising the penetration of natural daylight into the space towards creating a more green-conducive studio. The paper review literature about the types, criteria and benefits of daylight strategies. This paper also presented a pilot study that has been performed in one university in Perak, Malaysia, by selecting architectural studios as the main subject.\n\nReduction of lighting energy consumption in office buildings through improved daylight design\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPapadouri, Maria Violeta Prado\n\nThis study aims to investigate the lighting energy consumption in office buildings and the options for its reduction. One way to reduce lighting energy consumption is by improving the daylight design. A better use of daylight in buildings might be an outcome from the effort made in different directions. Like the improvement of a building's fabric and layout, the materials, even the furniture in a space influences the daylight quality considerably. Also very important role in lighting energy consumption has the development of more efficient lighting technology like the electric lighting control systems, such as photo sensors and occupancy sensors. Both systems are responsible so that the electric light is not used without reason. As the focusing area of this study, is to find ways to improve the daylight use in buildings, a consequent question is which are the methods provided in order to achieve this The accuracy of the methodology used is also an important issue in order to achieve reliable results. The methodology applied in this study includes the analysis of a case study by taking field measurements and computer simulations. The first stage included gathering information about the lighting design of the building and monitoring the light levels, both from natural and from the electric lighting. The second stage involved testing with computer simulations, different parameters that were expected to improve the daylight exploitation of the specific area. The results of the field measurements showed that the main problems of the space were the low natural light levels and the poor daylight distribution. The annual electric lighting energy consumption, as it was calculated with the use of computer simulations, represented the annual energy consumption of a typical air-conditioned prestige office building (energy consumption guide 19, for energy use in offices, 2000). After several computer simulations, the results showed that initial design parameters of the building\n\n75 FR 36089 - Payment System Risk Policy; Daylight Overdraft Posting Rules\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-06-24\n\n... and includes only Accounts Receivable Entry (ARC), Back Office Conversion Entry (BOC), Point-of... account balance and daylight overdraft balance in Account Management Information (AMI), which is a service... under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget.

Use of daylighting as a design strategy is not always synonymous with effective use of daylighting as an energy-saving strategy unless both approaches are jointly pursued by the design team. Criteria for visual performance, disability and discomfort glare, historical perspectives on daylight utilization, building form as a limit to daylight penetration, beam sunlighting strategies, luminous efficacy of daylight versus efficient electric light sources, comparative thermal impacts, peak load and load management potential, and nonenergy benefits are reviewed. Although the energy benefits of daylighting can be oversold, it is concluded that in most cases a solid understanding of the energy and design issues should produce energy efficiency and pleasing working environments.\n\nDaylighting in Classrooms.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWilli, John G.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nDescribes how one elementary school was designed to be a flexible, innovative campus that connects learning and the learning environment.

Interestingly, daylighting`s resurgence is being furthered by mounting evidence of occupant dissatisfaction with predominantly electrically-lit offices, and two recent reports support growing concern that the lack of daylighting in these interiors has led not only to unhappy workers, but to potentially significant reductions in workplace productivity. Clearly pressure is mounting on designers to produce buildings responding to these concerns, and as the role of precedents in the evolution of design practice is unquestioned, demand has been increasing for publication of office-based daylightingmoreÂ Â» case studies. In an attempt to address this need, this paper examines two recently completed British buildings in which daylight has explicitly informed the architecture, and although data concerning the resulting energy savings is not yet available, these projects currently offer the design community two excellent examples of workplace daylighting where compelling visual environments are generating noteworthy occupant satisfaction.Â«Â less\n\nDaylight Saving Time Transitions and Road Traffic Accidents\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLahti, Tuuli; Nysten, Esa; Haukka, Jari; Sulander, Pekka; Partonen, Timo\n\n2010-01-01\n\nCircadian rhythm disruptions may have harmful impacts on health. Circadian rhythm disruptions caused by jet lag compromise the quality and amount of sleep and may lead to a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and loss of attention and alertness. Even a minor change in time schedule may cause considerable stress for the body. Transitions into and out of daylight saving time alter the social and environmental timing twice a year. According to earlier studies, this change in time-schedule leads to sleep disruption and fragmentation of the circadian rhythm. Since sleep deprivation decreases motivation, attention, and alertness, transitions into and out of daylight saving time may increase the amount of accidents during the following days after the transition. We studied the amount of road traffic accidents one week before and one week after transitions into and out of daylight saving time during years from 1981 to 2006. Our results demonstrated that transitions into and out of daylight saving time did not increase the number of traffic road accidents.

In quest of such simulators a first requirement is quantitative information on the average spectral distributions of natural sources such as daylight and skylight. Recent investigations of the spectral energy characteristics of natural daylight and skylight made it possible to determine such average conditions. With these conditions established, a search was undertaken for an artificial light source that would simulate these average natural distributions with a minimum of filtering. Certain fluorescent lamps and combinations of them were considered first, but, although it was possible to achieve fairly good visual matches of daylight and skylight, the spectral characteristics and the variability of such combinations are drawbacks to their use in critical scientific work. For this purpose, therefore, xenon arc lamps were found to be superior.\n\nDaylighting in the Springfield (Ohio) Museum of Art\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMoore, F.\n\nThis paper describes daylighting strategies used in the addition to the Springfield Museum of Art, Springfield, Ohio.

The search for and collection of daylighting analysis methods and algorithms led to two important observations. First, there is a wide range of needs for different types of methods to produce a complete analysis tool. These include: Geometry; Light modeling; Characterization of the natural illumination resource; Materials and components properties, representations; and Usability issues (interfaces, interoperability, representation of analysis results, etc). Second, very advantageously, there have beenmoreÂ Â» rapid advances in many basic methods in these areas, due to other forces. They are in part driven by: The commercial computer graphics community (commerce, entertainment); The lighting industry; Architectural rendering and visualization for projects; and Academia: Course materials, research. This has led to a very rich set of information resources that have direct applicability to the small daylighting analysis community. Furthermore, much of this information is in fact available online. Because much of the information about methods and algorithms is now online, an innovative reporting strategy was used: the core formats are electronic, and used to produce a printed form only secondarily. The electronic forms include both online WWW pages and a downloadable .PDF file with the same appearance and content. Both electronic forms include live primary and indirect links to actual information sources on the WWW. In most cases, little additional commentary is provided regarding the information links or citations that are provided. This in turn allows the report to be very concise.

The physiological and psychological benefits of daylighting have made it an increasingly important topic in multidisciplinary research. Although multiple studies have been written about the impact of daylight on physiological responses, few investigations have been made into the nonvisual effects related to resident mood, satisfaction, and stress level. In addition, researchers typically propose recommendations for quantitative aspects of illuminance, rather than addressing the behavioural outcomes. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to address the research questions. Thirty-four participants, who were living temporarily in the inpatient rehabilitation units of two skilled nursing facilities, were subjects in semistructured interviews and a 7-question 5-scale survey. While residents expressed the need to have direct visual access to the outdoors, they indicated that daylight was of even higher benefit. Additionally, they noted that size and location of windows impacted their stress levels, moods, and activities. More than half of the facility residents reported changing their postures for either better outdoor views or less light disturbance while sleeping. The results of this study emphasize the importance of daylighting for residents in rehabilitation units. Architects should acknowledge the role of daylighting and window views in the design of rehabilitation facilities.

This method considers pixel brightness information to be a linear combination of diffuse and directional light components, as received by a web cam from the walls and ceiling of an occupied office. The nature of these components in each image is determined by building orientation, room geometry, neighboring structures and the position of the sun. Considering daylight in this manner also allows for an estimation of the sky conditions at a given instant to be made, and presents a means to uncover seasonal trends in the behavior of light simply by monitoring the brightness variations of points on the walls and ceiling. Significantly, this daylight characterization method also allows for an estimation of the illumination level on a target surface to be made from image data. Currently, illumination at a target surface is estimated through the use of a ceiling-mounted photosensor, as part of a lighting control system, in the hopes of achieving a suitable balance between daylight and electrical lighting in a space. Improving the ability of a sensor to estimate the illumination is of great importance to those who wish to minimize unnecessary energy consumption, as a significant percentage of all U.S. electricity is currently consumed by light fixtures. A photosensor detects light that falls on its location, which does not necessarily correspond in a fixed manner to the light level on the target areas that the photosensor is meant to monitor. Additionally, a photosensor cannot discern variations in light distribution across a room, which often occur with daylight. By considering pixel brightness information to be a linear combination of diffuse and directional light components at selected pixels in an image, information about the light reaching these pixels can be extracted from observed patterns of brightness, under different light conditions. In this manner\n\nEmpirical assessment of a prismatic daylight-redirecting window film in a full-scale office testbed\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nThanachareonkit, Anothai; Lee, Eleanor S.; McNeil, Andrew\n\n2013-08-31\n\nDaylight redirecting systems with vertical windows have the potential to offset lighting energy use in deep perimeter zones. Microstructured prismatic window films can be manufactured using low-cost, roll-to-roll fabrication methods and adhered to the inside surface of existing windows as a retrofit measure or installed as a replacement insulating glass unit in the clerestory portion of the window wall. A clear film patterned with linear, 50-250 micrometer high, four-sided asymmetrical prisms was fabricated and installed in the south-facing, clerestory low-e, clear glazed windows of a full-scale testbed facility. Views through the film were distorted. The film was evaluated in amoreÂ Â» sunny climate over a two-year period to gauge daylighting and visual comfort performance. The daylighting aperture was small (window-towall ratio of 0.18) and the lower windows were blocked off to isolate the evaluation to the window film. Workplane illuminance measurements were made in the 4.6 m (15 ft) deep room furnished as a private office. Analysis of discomfort glare was conducted using high dynamic range imaging coupled with the evalglare software tool, which computes the daylight glare probability and other metrics used to evaluate visual discomfort. The window film was found to result in perceptible levels of discomfort glare on clear sunny days from the most conservative view point in the rear of the room looking toward the window. Daylight illuminance levels at the rear of the room were significantly increased above the reference window condition, which was defined as the same glazed clerestory window but with an interior Venetian blind (slat angle set to the cut-off angle), for the equinox to winter solstice period on clear sunny days. For partly cloudy and overcast sky conditions, daylight levels were improved slightly. To reduce glare, the daylighting film was coupled with a diffusing film in an insulating glazing unit.

Radiance, a lighting simulation program, has been used to conduct daylighting simulations for complex fenestration systems. Depending on the configurations, the simulation can take hours or even days using a personal computer. This paper describes how to accelerate the matrix multiplication portion of a Radiance three-phase daylight simulation by conducting parallel computing on heterogeneous hardware of a personal computer. The algorithm was optimized and the computational part was implemented in parallel using OpenCL. The speed of new approach wasmoreÂ Â» evaluated using various daylighting simulation cases on a multicore central processing unit and a graphics processing unit.

(15 U.S.C. 260a note) This report presents the results of impacts of Extended Daylight Saving Time on the national energy consumption in the United States. The key findings are: (1) The total electricity savings of Extended Daylight Saving Time were about 1.3 Tera Watt-hour (TWh). This corresponds to 0.5 percent per each day of Extended Daylight Saving Time, or 0.03 percent of electricity consumption over the year. In reference, the total 2007 electricity consumption in the United States was 3,900 TWh. (2) In terms of national primary energy consumption, the electricity savings translate to a reduction of 17 Trillion Btu (TBtu) over the spring and fall Extended Daylight Saving Time periods, or roughly 0.02 percent of total U.S. energy consumption during 2007 of 101,000 TBtu. (3) During Extended Daylight Saving Time, electricity savings generally occurred over a three- to five-hour period in the evening with small increases in usage during the early-morning hours. On a daily percentage basis, electricity savings were slightly greater during the March (spring) extension of Extended Daylight Saving Time than the November (fall) extension.

An experiment was conducted with 7 luminous conditions including daylighting. The suitability of a luminous environment was measured by asking the subjects to select suitable activities and unsuitable behaviors from a given list of possible activities. The result showed the selection of unsuitable behaviors was more useful than the selection of suitable behaviors. Furthermore, lighting installations offering a steady luminous environments, were not suitable for many behaviors including refreshing and rest. The luminous environments which were bright but had some fluctuation and some non-uniformity of brightness, obtained by use of direct sunlight, were judged to be suitable for negotiating, refreshing, and meeting.\n\nThe power of policy to influence behaviour change: daylight saving and its effect on physical activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosenberg, Michael; Wood, Lisa\n\n2010-02-01\n\nTo measure the impact of the introduction of daylight saving in Western Australia in December 2006 on when during the day adults engaged in physical activity. In early December 2006, 1,300 Western Australian adults were telephoned and asked about how the introduction of daylight saving would influence when during the day they typically engaged in physical activity. At the end of the daylight saving period in March 2007, 1,083 of the baseline cohort agreed to answer questions relating to how daylight saving had affected when during the day they were physically active. Almost half the cohort (45.5%) reported that daylight saving had affected when during the day they were physically active. During daylight saving fewer people exercised in the morning and more people exercised in the evening. When analysed at the individual level, 23% of the cohort ceased to exercise in the morning during daylight saving and 22% exercised in the evening only during daylight saving. In addition, to changes in when during the day people exercised, there was also an overall reduction in the average number of daily exercise sessions, with 8% not exercising at all during daylight saving. The results suggest that the introduction of daylight saving, a relatively modest compulsory change to increase daylight by one hour had an impact on patterns of when during the day people were physically active. The study results reinforce the value of focusing on policy as an effective means of supporting population behaviour change. Â© 2010 The Authors.

Through introduction and example, this paper illustrates the utility of the OpenStudio building energy modeling platform to leverage existing simulation tools for integrated building energy performance simulation, daylighting analysis, and reportage.Â«Â less\n\n78 FR 79498 - Notice Pursuant to the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993-OpenDaylight...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-12-30\n\n...

Nevertheless, the influence of daylight in modeling natural image statistics is not fully understood and has received little attention. The aim of this work was to analyze the influence of daylight changes in different high-order chromatic descriptors (i.e., color volume, color gamut, and number of discernible colors) derived from 350 color images, which were rendered under 108 natural illuminants with Correlated Color Temperatures (CCT) from 2735 to 25,889 K. Results suggest that chromatic and luminance information is almost constant and does not depend on the CCT of the illuminant for values above 14,000 K. Nevertheless, differences between the red-green and blue-yellow image components were found below that CCT, with most of the statistical descriptors analyzed showing local extremes in the range 2950 K-6300 K. Uniform regions and areas of the images attracting observers' attention were also considered in this analysis and were characterized by their patchiness index and their saliency maps. Meanwhile, the results of the patchiness index do not show a clear dependence on CCT, and it is remarkable that a significant reduction in the number of discernible colors (58% on average) was found when the images were masked with their corresponding saliency maps. Our results suggest that chromatic diversity, as defined in terms of the discernible colors, can be strongly reduced when an observer scans a natural scene. These findings support the idea that a reduction in the number of discernible colors will guide visual saliency and attention. Whatever the modeling is mediating the neural representation of natural images, natural image statistics, it is clear that natural image statistics should take into account those local maxima and minima depending on the daylight illumination and\n\nColour Mixing Based on Daylight\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMeyn, Jan-Peter\n\n2008-01-01\n\nColour science is based on the sensation of monochromatic light. In contrast to that, surface colours are caused by reflection of wide sections of the daylight spectrum. Non-spectral colours like magenta and purple appear homologous to colours with spectral hue, if the approach of mixing monochromatic light is abandoned.

Weather conditions may not always allow daylight PDT outdoors. We compared the spectrum of five different lamp candidates for indoor \"daylight PDT\" and investigated their ability to photobleach protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Furthermore, we measured the amount of PpIX activating daylight available in a glass greenhouse, which can be an alternative when it is uncomfortable for patients to be outdoors. The lamps investigated were: halogen lamps (overhead and slide projector), white light-emitting diode (LED) lamp, red LED panel and lamps used for conventional PDT. Four of the five light sources were able to photobleach PpIX completely. For halogen light and the red LED lamp, 5000 lux could photobleach PpIX whereas 12,000 lux were needed for the white LED lamp. Furthermore, the greenhouse was suitable for daylight PDT since the effect of solar light is lowered only by 25%. In conclusion, we found four of the five light sources and the greenhouse usable for indoor daylight PDT. The greenhouse is beneficial when the weather outside is rainy or windy. Only insignificant ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) radiation passes through the greenhouse glass, so sun protection is not needed.\n\nAlternatives to Outdoor Daylight Illumination for Photodynamic TherapyâUse of Greenhouses and Artificial Light Sources\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLerche, Catharina M.; Heerfordt, Ida M.; Heydenreich, Jakob; Wulf, Hans Christian\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDaylight-mediated photodynamic therapy (daylight PDT) is a simple and pain free treatment of actinic keratoses.

III; Holder, L.M. IV\n\n1999-07-01\n\nThe project was designed by the Overland Partners Architectural Firm for Riverbend Church of Austin as an Auditorium for Sunday Services and a venue for special theatrical presentations for the church and the community as well. It is an amphitheater on a hillside overlooking the Colorado River Valley. The amphitheater was selected as the building form to keep the audience closer to the speaker. A 175 ft wide by 60 ft tall arched window was installed on the north face to allow the audience to see the panorama views of the tree covered hills on the other side of themoreÂ Â» valley in the Texas Hill Country. Although the design is quite effective in achieving the program goals, these characteristics make it difficult to achieve effective daylighting without glare for the audience and television cameras since both face the north glazing. The design team was faced with providing quality daylighting for the audience and television cameras from the wall behind the stage. Most television studios have carefully controlled lighting systems with the major lighting component from behind the cameras. Virtually all television facilities with daylight contributing to the production lighting are in a building with high shading coefficient glass producing illumination on all areas equally or almost all glass and daylighting from skylights and clearstories above. All television networks have requirements for control of the quality of the video images to parallel those conditions for the program to be aired.Â«Â less\n\nYear-Round Daylight Saving Time Study : Volume 1.

D.; Kittler, R.\n\nSolar eclipses are unique phenomena not only for astronomical and space observations but also for terrestrial; they create unique conditions of sunbeam blockage which cause not only the reduction of direct sunlight but also the dimming of skylight from the whole sky vault. Very favorable conditions were met during the recent August 1999 solar eclipse in Athens, Greece and Bratislava, Slovakia. General class daylight stations operate within the International Daylight Measurements Program in the two cities. One-minute data of global/diffuse illuminance and zenith luminance from those stations have been used to provide information about their levels and the daylight reduction rate during the eclipse. An approximate formula for the estimation of sunlight and skylight illuminance levels as well as zenith luminance using relative luminance sky patterns is also presented in this work. To achieve this, recently developed sky standards together with their parameterizations are utilized.\n\nSeasonality in trauma admissions - Are daylight and weather variables better predictors than general cyclic effects?\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ¸islien, Jo; SÃ¸vik, Signe; Eken, Torsten\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTrauma is a leading global cause of death, and predicting the burden of trauma admissions is vital for good planning of trauma care. Seasonality in trauma admissions has been found in several studies. Seasonal fluctuations in daylight hours, temperature and weather affect social and cultural practices but also individual neuroendocrine rhythms that may ultimately modify behaviour and potentially predispose to trauma. The aim of the present study was to explore to what extent the observed seasonality in daily trauma admissions could be explained by changes in daylight and weather variables throughout the year. Retrospective registry study on trauma admissions in the 10-year period 2001-2010 at Oslo University Hospital, UllevÃ¥l, Norway, where the amount of daylight varies from less than 6 hours to almost 19 hours per day throughout the year. Daily number of admissions was analysed by fitting non-linear Poisson time series regression models, simultaneously adjusting for several layers of temporal patterns, including a non-linear long-term trend and both seasonal and weekly cyclic effects. Five daylight and weather variables were explored, including hours of daylight and amount of precipitation. Models were compared using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). A regression model including daylight and weather variables significantly outperformed a traditional seasonality model in terms of AIC. A cyclic week effect was significant in all models. Daylight and weather variables are better predictors of seasonality in daily trauma admissions than mere information on day-of-year.\n\nDaylight saving time transitions and hospital treatments due to accidents or manic episodes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLahti, Tuuli A; Haukka, Jari; LÃ¶nnqvist, Jouko; Partonen, Timo\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Daylight saving time affects millions of people annually but its impacts are still widely unknown. Sleep deprivation and the change of circadian rhythm can trigger mental illness and cause higher accident rates. Transitions into and out of daylight saving time changes the circadian rhythm and may cause sleep deprivation. Thus it seems plausible that the prevalence of accidents and/or manic episodes may be higher after transition into and out of daylight saving time. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of transitions into and out of daylight saving time on the incidence of accidents and manic episodes in the Finnish population during the years of 1987 to 2003. Methods The nationwide data were derived from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. From the register we obtained the information about the hospital-treated accidents and manic episodes during two weeks before and two weeks after the transitions in 1987â2003. Results The results were negative, as the transitions into or out of daylight saving time had no significant effect on the incidence of accidents or manic episodes. Conclusion One-hour transitions do not increase the incidence of manic episodes or accidents which require hospital treatment.

Because of the risk of transformation of AK to invasive squamous cell carcinomas, consensus guidelines recommend that AK are removed using appropriate therapies to prevent progression to invasive disease. Daylight photodynamic therapy (PDT) is emerging as an efficacious treatment for AK, particularly for patients who require treatment of large areas of chronic actinic damage that can be exposed easily to daylight. Daylight PDT with methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) cream is a simple treatment for AK, almost painless, well tolerated and convenient, requiring minimal time in the clinic. Randomised controlled studies from northern Europe and Australia support the use of daylight PDT as an effective therapy for grade I and II AK on the face and scalp. There is sufficient daylight to conduct daylight PDT in Australia at any time of the year and during most weather conditions. Hence, daylight PDT with MAL can be included as an effective and wellâtolerated new treatment option for the treatment of AK in Australia. These consensus recommendations provide guidelines for Australian clinicians on the use of daylight PDT in the treatment of diagnosed AK.

Although colour constancy has evolved under a constrained subset of illuminations, it is unknown whether its underlying mechanisms, thought to involve multiple components from retina to cortex, are optimised for particular environmental variations. Here we demonstrate a new method for investigating colour constancy using illumination matching in real scenes which, unlike previous methods using surface matching and simulated scenes, allows testing of multiple, real illuminations. We use real scenes consisting of solid familiar or unfamiliar objects against uniform or variegated backgrounds and compare discrimination performance for typical illuminations from the daylight chromaticity locus (approximately blue-yellow) and atypical spectra from an orthogonal locus (approximately red-green, at correlated colour temperature 6700 K), all produced in real time by a 10-channel LED illuminator. We find that discrimination of illumination changes is poorer along the daylight locus than the atypical locus, and is poorest particularly for bluer illumination changes, demonstrating conversely that surface colour constancy is best for blue daylight illuminations. Illumination discrimination is also enhanced, and therefore colour constancy diminished, for uniform backgrounds, irrespective of the object type. These results are not explained by statistical properties of the scene signal changes at the retinal level. We conclude that high-level mechanisms of colour constancy are biased for the blue daylight illuminations and variegated backgrounds to which the human visual system has typically been exposed.\n\nTeaching Science: Beats the Daylight Out of Me.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLeyden, Michael B.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nPresents activities for observing, measuring, collecting, and graphing data about times of sunrise and sunset to teach an understanding about arrival of Daylight Savings Time in April.

The aid uses the augmented view concept and provides subjects with visual information from outside their visual field. The tests were carried out in daylight conditions. The optoelectronic aid comprises a FPGA (real-time video processor), a wide-angle mini camera and a transparent see-through head-mounted display. This optoelectronic aid is called SERBA (Sistema Electro-Ã³ptico Reconfigurable de Ayuda para Baja VisiÃ³n). We previously showed that, without compromising residual vision, the SERBA system provides information about objects within an area about three times greater on average than the remaining visual field of the subjects [1]. In this paper we address the effects of the device on mobility under daylight conditions with and without SERBA. The participants were six subjects with retinitis pigmentosa. In this mobility test, better results were obtained when subjects were wearing the SERBA system; specifically, both the number of contacts with low-level obstacles and mobility errors decreased significantly. A longer training period with the device might improve its usefulness.\n\nLight-scattering properties of a Venetian blind slat used for daylighting applications\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNilsson, Annica M.; Jonsson, Jacob C.\n\n2010-12-15\n\nThe low cost, simplicity, and aesthetic appearance of external and internal shading devices, make them commonly used for daylighting and glare-control applications. Shading devices, such as Venetian blinds, screens, and roller shades, generally exhibit light scattering and/or light redirecting properties. This requires the bi-directional scattering distribution function (BSDF) of the material to be known in order to accurately predict the daylight distribution and energy flow through the fenestration system. Acquiring the complete BSDF is not a straightforward task, and to complete the process it is often required that a model is used to complement the measured data. In this project,moreÂ Â» a Venetian blind slat with a white top surface and a brushed aluminum bottom surface was optically characterized. A goniophotometer and an integrating sphere spectrophotometer were used to determine the angle resolved and hemispherical reflectance of the sample, respectively. The acquired data were fitted to a scattering model providing one Lambertian and one angle dependent description of the surface properties. These were used in combination with raytracing to obtain the complete BSDFs of the Venetian blind system.

However there is a problem in that the counterintuitive reflectance characteristics of various common scene elements can cause slowed reaction times and impaired situational awareness-consequences that can be especially detrimental in emergency situations. While multiband infrared sensors can be used, they are inherently more costly. Here we propose a technique for adding a daylight color appearance to single band infrared images, using the normally overlooked property of local image texture. The simple method described here is illustrated with colorized images from the visible red and long wave infrared bands. Our colorizing process not only imparts a natural daylight appearance to infrared images but also enhances the contrast and visibility of otherwise obscure detail. We anticipate that this colorizing method will lead to a better user experience, faster reaction times and improved situational awareness for a growing community of infrared camera users. A natural extension of our process could expand upon its texture discerning feature by adding specialized filters for discriminating specific targets.\n\nOn the development of new SPMN diurnal video systems for daylight fireball monitoring\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMadiedo, J. M.; Trigo-RodrÃ­guez, J. M.; Castro-Tirado, A. J.\n\n2008-09-01\n\nDaylight fireball video monitoring High-sensitivity video devices are commonly used for the study of the activity of meteor streams during the night. These provide useful data for the determination, for instance, of radiant, orbital and photometric parameters ([1] to [7]). With this aim, during 2006 three automated video stations supported by Universidad de Huelva were set up in Andalusia within the framework of the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN). These are endowed with 8-9 high sensitivity wide-field video cameras that achieve a meteor limiting magnitude of about +3. These stations have increased the coverage performed by the low-scan allsky CCD systems operated by the SPMN and, besides, achieve a time accuracy of about 0.01s for determining the appearance of meteor and fireball events. Despite of these nocturnal monitoring efforts, we realised the need of setting up stations for daylight fireball detection. Such effort was also motivated by the appearance of the two recent meteorite-dropping events of Villalbeto de la PeÃ±a [8,9] and Puerto LÃ¡pice [10]. Although the Villalbeto de la PeÃ±a event was casually videotaped, and photographed, no direct pictures or videos were obtained for the Puerto LÃ¡pice event. Consequently, in order to perform a continuous recording of daylight fireball events, we setup new automated systems based on CCD video cameras. However, the development of these video stations implies several issues with respect to nocturnal systems that must be properly solved in order to get an optimal operation. The first of these video stations, also supported by University of Huelva, has been setup in Sevilla (Andalusia) during May 2007. But, of course, fireball association is unequivocal only in those cases when two or more stations recorded the fireball, and when consequently the geocentric radiant is accurately determined. With this aim, a second diurnal video station is being setup in Andalusia in the facilities of Centro Internacional de Estudios y\n\nDifferences in geometry of pedestrian crashes in daylight and darkness.\n\nPubMed\n\nSullivan, John M; Flannagan, Michael J\n\n2011-02-01\n\nPrevious studies have shown that increased risk in darkness is particularly great for pedestrian crashes, suggesting that attempts to improve headlighting should focus on factors that likely influence those crashes. The current analysis was designed to provide information about how details of pedestrian crashes may differ between daylight and darkness. All pedestrian crashes that occurred in daylight or dark conditions in Michigan during 2004 were analyzed in terms of the variables included in the State of Michigan crash database. Additional analysis of the narratives and diagrams in police accident reports was performed for a subset of 400 of those crashes-200 sampled from daylight and 200 sampled from darkness. Several differences were found that appear to be related to the characteristic asymmetry of low-beam headlamps, which (in the United States) distributes more light on the passenger's side than the driver's side of the vehicle. These results provide preliminary quantification of the how the photometric differences between the right and left sides of typical headlamps may affect pedestrian crash risk. The results suggest that efforts to provide supplemental forward vehicle lighting in turns may have safety benefits for pedestrians. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
