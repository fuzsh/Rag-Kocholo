A little over a year after en¬ tering a contract estimated at between $100 million and $300 million, EDS and Signet are eval¬ uating whether to move Signet’s data center facilities from their current location to EDS’ Hern¬ don, Va., processing center, ac¬ cording to Signet Executive Vice President William Dieter. Such a move could threaten scores of information systems jobs at Signet.

Compaq to take radical tack Will recastas integrator, software provider BY MICHAEL FITZGERALD CW STAFF HOUSTON — Compaq Com¬ puter Corp. is undergoing a quiet metamorphosis from a hardware maker into a single point of con¬ tact for integrating systems and providing software to high-end users. Compaq said pieces of the plan will be announced during the course of the year. A stumbling Compaq intends to become a go-between for Sys- temPro users in multivendor shops by working to integrate lo¬ cal-area networks into multiplat¬ form environments. The plan also calls for Compaq to provide technical support and service for other vendors’ products and to sell or bundle software. Howev¬ er, pricing is not yet available. Last week, Compaq made good on a 4-week-old promise to bundle Novell, Inc.’s NetWare and offer software that could provide mainframe server-like capabilities. This week, it is ex¬ pected to unveil its lowest priced line of personal computers yet.

CW Chart: Michael Siggins DEC flip-flops on Unix workstation strategy BY MARYFRAN JOHNSON CW STAFF MAYNARD, Mass. — A freight train of customer outcry pushed Digital Equipment Corp.’s Unix strategy back on track last week, forcing the vendor to reverse its recent decision to put Ultrix in¬ stead of the DEC/OSF/1 operat¬ ing system on future versions of the DECstation/DECsystem line. DEC officials now say then- entire Unix-based workstation and server line will get a produc¬ tion-quality version of DEC / OSFyi to follow the advanced developer’s kit, which is avail¬ able only on a limited number of DECstation models. The catch is that delivery of an end-user release of DEC/ OSF/1 for the DECstation line will be delayed until sane time next year. Many customers said they were originally told it would be available this summer or by early fall. The latest rendition of DEC’s strategy calls for implementing the Open Software Foundation’s OSF/1 on Mips Computer Sys¬ tems, Inc.’s R2000-, R3000- and R4000-based DECstations and DECsystems and to make that implementation compatible with OSF/1 on future Alpha-based systems. The company will also support its own Ultrix Unix op¬ erating system on the R4000- based DECstations and DECsys¬ tems. Continued on page 14 all strategy appear to be part of an ambitious, if not radical, effort by Compaq to separate itself from the PC pack. It also may represent the first bid by a desk¬ top hardware maker to muscle in on the kind of integration ser¬ vices traditionally provided by Firms such as IBM, Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett- Packard Co. Ronnie Ward, Compaq’s di¬ rector of product development, told Computerworld recently, “In the new paradigm of the ’90s, [users should] consider No¬ vell almost a division of Compaq, or Intel and Microsoft a division of Compaq.

NEWS Notes productivity claims eyed Survey says workgroup software could offer ROI of more than 100% BY ROSEMARY HAMILTON CW STAFF BOSTON — Lotus Develop¬ ment Corp. last week took its first stab at defining productivity gains from its Notes workgroup software, releasing a report that claims returns on investment of 100% or more are possible. Some customers said that Noteworthy Ictus’ Notes increased its user base. 3.5 times in one year Worldwide installed base 115,000 1990 1991 Source: International Data Corp. while the report is a good first ef¬ fort to quantify Notes productiv¬ ity, they would not count on the numbers to sell Notes to their bosses. Workgroup software, they said, does not lend itself easily to traditional measure¬ ments of productivity and so this kind of early data could be mis¬ leading. What is more, they sug¬ gested it may not be necessary. “Before this can be powerful¬ ly persuasive, there has to be more quantitative analysis,” said Bruce Hasenyager, senior vice president of corporate systems at Chemical Bank in New York. Yet he said he is impressed with the Lotus software and has over¬ seen a group of Notes users that has grown to 800 members in the past 18 months. The Lotus study, released to attendees at the LotusWorld conference last week, was com¬ pleted in conjunction with the re¬ search firm Telesis, Inc. in Prov¬ idence, R.I. It examined 11 customer-designed Notes appli¬ cations at eight customer sites. Each customer implemented Notes more than a year ago and had at least 200 Notes nodes. Each application was designed as a core business program rather than a more basic application, such as mail. Productivity was defined as a combination of time savings and revenue gained as a result of using Notes. The report estimated annual benefits over a period of three years, and the median, pretax re¬ turn on investment was 353%. On average, the projects paid for themselves within four months. Some of the returns on in¬ vestment are whoppers. Dell Computer Corp., a study partici¬ pant, showed returns of 979% and 1,344% on two in-house de¬ signed applications. The two software projects cost less than $10,000 to design and together are expected to bring net annual benefits of close to $100,000. Yet Tim Deagan, manager of service tools development, said the numbers do not tell the whole Notes story. “There are no good measure¬ ments for identifying efficiency in this area,” Deagan said. “Bot¬ tom line, people are finding their answers more quickly. You used to walk down the hallway to ask someone a question. Now that person can be two doors down or in Ireland.” Deagan and others said work¬ group software often allows workers to tackle issues in new ways, such as with the teamwork that Notes discussion databases help foster. As a result, the new approach may have no basis for comparison. James Henry, Lotus’ vice president of strategy, who man¬ aged the study, said the goal was to give some hard numbers on Notes use and that the company “does not pretend” that this is the complete analysis. Robert Holmes, computer technology research analyst at Southern California Gas Co., which is planning to test-drive Notes later this year, said the Lotus study results include such high percentages that “they could generate disbelief in the executive suites.” “It’s the ability to change and become more of what your busi¬ ness requires that is the real val¬ ue in products like Notes,” he said. Analysts contacted last week said they were not aware of much quantitative research on benefits to products such as Notes. “It’s interesting that Lo¬ tus is trying to tackle this, but how do you really prove the pro¬ ductivity side of this issue?” said Mary McCaffrey, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell, Inc. “It’s tough.” Note-able companions Lotus is scheduled to introduce a trio of imaging products for its Notes work¬ group platform today, marking the of¬ ficial launch of its Notes companion product strategy. The software will ship within two to three months, and pricing will be released at that time, Lotus said. Previously, Lotus and Eastman Ko¬ dak Co. officials had said the imaging software will be priced under $500. Lotus Notes: Document Imaging, which was co-developed with Kodak’s Desktop Document Imaging Group in Rochester, N.Y., is being test¬ ed at Cincinnati Bell Information Systems, Inc. That firm is using the imaging software to help reduce the paper load of customer documenta¬ tion and correspondence. “I’ve looked at a lot of imaging applications, and they have lots of capabilities, but [often] aren’t well-integrated with the environment,” said Greg Buchanan, director of technical plan¬ ning and development at Cincinnati Bell. “This one integrates well with Notes.” Lotus Notes: Document Imaging allows users to store documents in a Notes database as an “embedded” database or on a separate server. Within Notes, documents can be represented by an icon. A user can click on the icon, which acti¬ vates the imaging software. The software then searches for the document and retrieves it from the Notes database or the “linked” database. A second Notes product scheduled to debut today is an optical character recognition pro¬ gram using technology developed with Calera Recognition Systems, Inc. And an incoming fax gateway product developed with Gamma-Link Co. would allow Notes users to receive faxes. ROSEMARY HAMILTON Angry AS/400 users ready for end to tiered pricing BY KIM S. NASH CW STAFF The cost of new hardware was not the only expense that Ron Songstead, the information sys¬ tems director at Jimmy Dean Foods, had to justify to manage¬ ment when the Sara Lee Corp. unit stepped up from an IBM Ap¬ plication System/400 Model B50toaB60. Systems Software Asso¬ ciates, Inc. (SSA), Jimmy Dean’s third-party supplier, told Song- stead that a follow-on upgrade of its Business Process and Control System application would cost $100,000 — just as much as IBM charged Jimmy Dean for up¬ grading its hardware and system software. This, despite the fact that the only thing about the package that would change was the model number of the mini¬ computer it would run on. Such tiered pricing schemes, where application prices in¬ crease as hardware models go up the line, may make Songstead and other AS/400 users angry, but they continue to bear what they consider excessive costs. As a result, most independent software vendors in the mid¬ range realm seem unfazed by complaints. Their customers are not ranting in numbers large enough or voices loud enough to change the tiered scheme, ac¬ cording to vendors such as Mar- cam Corp. and Computer Appli¬ cations Specialists (CAS). Users interviewed recently, who called tiered pricing every¬ thing from “a tough situation” to “gouging,” frequently called for an alternative plan based on the number of users. User-based pricing would “prevent us from being penal¬ ized for taking advantage of hardware,” said Todd Ihrig, project manager at Northrop King Co. in Golden Valley, Minn., an agriculture seeds firm that has been using Marcam’s Prism manufacturing and finan¬ cial systems for two years. IS shops frequently upgrade hard¬ ware not to add more users to the system but to access new features on the latest box, Ihrig explained. The idea is making headway among mainframe software makers, including Computer As¬ sociates International, Inc. [CW, June 8], but not among its mid¬ range brethren. “It may make people upset, but that’s the way of life right now,” said Carson Soule, president of Beltsville, Md.-based CAS. “People will always get hurt in any kind of arrangement,” said Paul Margolis, chief execu¬ tive officer at Newton, Mass.- based Marcam, adding that the issue is “in constant debate” among vendors. He explained that to stay alive, the company must meet specific revenue goals to cover development costs, but Marcam is “willing to talk this through with customers who have com¬ plaints,” he said. Not all vendors subscribe to tiered plans. For example, Soft¬ ware 2000, Inc. does not charge for moving to the next series lev¬ el within the same model family. Upgrading from an AS/400 B45 machine to a D45 or E45, for ex¬ ample, would be free. Tiered systems “stick in our craw,” Songstead said. Although SSA eventually dropped its ask¬ ing price 50%, “next time I ne¬ gotiate about this, whichever vendor doesn’t charge me for up¬ grading will get my business,” he vowed. Meanwhile, some users are looking for ways to dodge what they consider to be out-of-line fees. “I understand the need to recoup development money, but it really ouches when they slap you with those prices,” said Reba Archer, director of infor¬ mation technology at Fort Worth, Texas-based Young Oil Co. That is why the company opted to build most of its pro¬ grams in-house and buy off-the- shelf utilities from a small suppli¬ er, Archer said.

Meanwhile, Ken Bouldin, president of the Computer Dealers and Lessors Asso¬ ciation (CDLA), a group that represents many of the independent vendors, said IBM has “stonewalled” his association’s attempts to help determine which memo¬ ry boards IBM considers to be counter¬ feit. The most recent lawsuit alleges that Phoenix Computer Associates, Inc. in Westport, Conn., has knowingly sold counterfeit memory cards to customers. Phoenix Computer President Lawrence Erdmann was also named as a defendant. A Phoenix Computer spokeswoman re¬ fused to comment. An IBM spokesman said IBM found out about the counterfeit cards from Phoenix Computer after the cards failed at some user sites. He declined to say which user firms are involved or how many there are. A “substantial” number of cards are in¬ volved, he added. A counterfeit memory card is general¬ ly soldered together from authentic IBM parts: two 32M-bit cards joined to make one 64M-bit card, for example. Some¬ times the counterfeiters affix what looks like an IBM label with a parts number. But if the card itself is not authentic — manufactured and tested by IBM — it is not entitled to IBM service, according to the company. cards are IBM-approved — is at the heart of the argument between the CDLA and IBM. According to Bouldin, one of the association’s commit¬ tees, which is in the process of drafting a policy statement over what constitutes a coun¬ terfeit board, “went to IBM and asked them to tell us the limits — what we can do, and what we can’t. They would not cooperate,” Bouldin said. An IBM spokesman said “no one is aware” of any formal CDLA request, although individual CDLA members have asked for guidelines about how to detect counterfeit cards. However, it is “impossible” to allow third parties to per¬ form the tests because they involve matching the parts numbers on the cards with “confidential” manufacturing records, according to the spokesman. IBM will not do the tests for the les¬ sors, the spokesman added, because “IBM does not elect to be in that busi¬ ness, except for end users.” IBM will send a technician to a user site to test, for $300 per hour, a suspi¬ cious memory component. But the test requires a user to shut down the proces¬ sor. IBM Europe has taken a different ap¬ proach because of widespread problems with suspicious memory boards in 3090s and midrange machines. Earlier this month, it unveiled a trade-in service that allows customers to have IBM technicians test their machines for fake memory cards. If any are found, new cards are swapped in. However, no such program is available here, an IBM spokesman said.

In October 1991, IBM sued Comdisco, Inc., based in Rosemont, Ill., alleging that it, too, traded in counterfeit cards. That suit is still pend¬ ing. In May, IBM sued three other compa¬ nies — known in leasing parlance as “re- furb houses” — that perform technical work to reconfigure computers that les¬ sors then trade. Those companies are Da- tanon, Inc. in Carol Stream, Ill.; Allen- Myland, Inc. in Broomall, Pa.; and BSM Corp. in Roselle, Ill. All of IBM’s legal activity may begin to have an adverse impact on the 3090 leas¬ ing industry, one industry watcher said. “To the extent that users get leery and begin to suspect that their computers may have counterfeit boards in them, they might avoid them altogether,” said Thomas Donovan, an independent analyst in Medfield, Mass. “That could destroy a whole industry.” But Darrell Balmer, a vice president at Gartner Group, Inc. in Stamford, Conn., disagreed. “I don’t think this suit will have that much of an impact. The memory problem is pretty well-known out there,” he said. The “real problem,” he added, is “finding out which memory components are bona fide and which are not. It’s rath¬ er difficult to do that.” That issue — how to determine which FDRREORG\"' provides an easy and automated method of reorganizing VSAM, IAM and PDS files, dramatically reducing the wall clock and resources required.

Pathworks for NetWare rep¬ resents a quantum leap in DEC’S efforts to open up its proprietary VAX/VMS environment to oth¬ er vendors' client/server prod¬ ucts, sources said. “What we’ve heard from DEC is that [Pathworks for NetWare] will actually turn the VAX into a file server for NetWare clients — which is what we want,” said Ed Honko, VAX systems manager at Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Cos. The company will be receiving a beta- test copy of Pathworks for NetWare in a couple of weeks. No strings to bind “What DEC is saying is that NetWare won’t be DECnet-de- pendent,” said Jamie Lewis, a vice president at The Burton Group, a Salt Lake City consult¬ ing firm. “That’s a major change in strategy: They’ll have to go back and do the same thing” for the original Pathworks, which is based on Microsoft’s LAN Man¬ ager, he added. Mark Shardon, strategy de¬ velopment manager at DEC’s software products group, im¬ plied that DEC is working on this (see story at right). DEC needs to take Novell into account as it seeks to ex¬ pand its client/server presence beyond its own customer base. Out of 9,400 DEC VAX sites in Computer Intelligence’s data¬ base, approximately 30% were also identified as NetWare users. “We have to accommodate [No¬ vell’s] 60% share”of the LAN market, Shardon said. One of the key features Dr. Pepper expects from the NetWare version of Pathworks is bidirectional file and printer sharing between VAX/VMS sys¬ tems and NetWare clients, Honko said. NetWare for VMS, a former Novell product now marketed by developer Interconnections, Inc., allows NetWare users to ac¬ cess VAX files and printers but does not allow VAX users to ac¬ cess files and printers on the per- COMPUTERWORLD sonal computer LAN, Honko ex¬ plained. “We also hope Path- works for NetWare will give us better speed than the Intercon¬ nections product, which is slow,” he added. DEC has promised that Path- works for NetWare will actually allow NetWare clients to access files, applications and services on the VAX using Novell’s IPX transport protocol, NetWare Loadable Modules and NetWare Control Protocols, Honko said. DEC will begin by implementing basic functions such as opening and closing files and then adding additional Network Control Pro¬ tocols gradually, sources said. A number of users applauded the idea of being able to use na¬ tive Novell protocols to access both VAX files and DEC’s Net¬ work Application Support family of enterprisewide services. DEC’s current product, Net¬ Ware Coexistence, is said to al¬ low a PC to access either NetWare or VAX servers but provides no real integration be¬ tween the two, Honko said. Pathworks for NetWare will also eliminate the need for users to load IPX for NetWare access and DECnet for VAX access, po¬ tentially overloading a PC’s main memory, several sources con¬ firmed. However, Dr. Pepper is still concerned about how much memory Pathworks will take up on a PC, Honko said: “We want to load just NetWare on the PC to access VAX services; we real¬ ize we’ll need some Pathworks on the PC, but we hope it will just be pieces, not the whole thing.” E-mail link needed Another common user request was for the ability to exchange electronic-mail messages across NetWare and VAX servers. “We definitely want one serv¬ er to pass E-mail to another,” so that clients on one type of sys¬ tem can address clients on the other, said Jim Bucher, superin¬ tendent of computer services at Inco Ltd., a Canadian manufac¬ turer. Pathworks for NetWare will provide this, but with a catch: Users will have to install a CCITT X.400 gateway between the two types of systems, sources said. Novell’s NetWare Global Messaging will support an X.400 access module by the fall, a Novell spokesman said. Not all users want to install X.400 on their client/server sys¬ tems, however. “Right now, X.400 is an awfully expensive way to go,” Honko said. “We’d like to see a product to trans¬ late” NetWare and VAX E-mail protocols directly, he added. High ambition DEC’s upcoming Pathworks for Novell’s NetWare promises to provide a much higher level of integra¬ tion than does the original Pathworks, which is based on Microsoft’s LAN Manager. But long-term cooperative efforts by DEC and Microsoft will eventually leapfrog the DEC/Novell effort to pro¬ vide a still higher level of integration between Microsoft’s Win¬ dows environments and DEC’s enterprise services, said Mark Shardon, strategy development manager at DEC’s software group. “The basic strategic issue here is that Microsoft would love to provide a much higher level of enterprise computing, and we’d love synergy with Microsoft’s vast success on desktops and LANs,” he said. In the short term, Microsoft and DEC are working to close the interoperability gaps between LAN Manager and Path- works/VMS, Shardon said. For example, the two companies are working to achieve consistency between Microsoft Mail and DEC Mail protocols, he said. Longer term, DEC and Microsoft are working to “align our architectures” through a common set of application programming interfaces (API) now being devel¬ oped, Shardon added. In contrast, Pathworks for NetWare will need to perform translations between NetWare and VMS networking protocols, he explained. Microsoft intends to implement the new APIs in Windows Open Services Architecture, while DEC does so in its Network Application Support (NAS) architecture, Shardon said. This will allow Microsoft’s Windows NT and DOS client systems to ac¬ cess NAS services such as global naming and directory, E-mail, file sharing and compound document architecture. The basic engine for linking clients to multiple servers and services will be based on the remote procedure calls and APIs defined by the Open Software Foundation’s Distributed Com¬ puting Environment. ELISABETH HORWITT JUNE 15, 1992 NEWS Zenith Data reworks line in bid to recapture lost momentum BY MICHAEL FITZGERALD CW STAFF PARIS — Striving to recharge its stagnant market presence and regain profitability after a red-ink stained two years, a hopeful Zenith Data Systems last week unveiled a completely re¬ vamped product line. “They were hemmed in with an outdated product line; now they have a full [up-to-date] product line that does not have just a single focus,” said John Dunkle, president of WorkGroup Technologies, Inc. in Hampton, N.H. Zenith Data, acquired by Groupe Bull in late 1989, has long been known primarily for portables. As of last week, Zenith Data’s product line ranges from low- end Intel Corp. 80386SX-based notebooks to monitors to high- powered tower-type servers. Together, the products repre¬ sent a four-pronged focus for Ze¬ nith Data. Future product generations will stress investment protec¬ tion (through upgradability), ease of use, connectivity and de¬ sign, Zenith Data said. “The modular concept and the idea of investment protec¬ tion [are] reasonable ones,” said Richard Amacher, manager of personnel, finance and adminis¬ tration at General Motors Corp.’s Motor Sports Technol¬ ogy Group in Warren, Mich. While focused largely on porta¬ ble computing, Amacher said his group also liked Zenith Data’s emphasis on built-in networking. More than products The company’s makeover went beyond the more than 40 prod¬ ucts it introduced, said Enrico Pesatori, Zenith Data’s presi¬ dent and chief executive officer. He pointed to a 25% increase in research and development spending and the inauguration of a customer assistance center, as well as efforts to expand direct sales to corporations. Analysts gave Zenith Data strategy qualified praise. “It’s pretty good stuff, and it’s quite a departure from the normal ZDS — they’ve always been kind of ‘me-tooish’ and ex¬ pensive,” said Bruce Stephen, a personal computer hardware an¬ alyst at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. At the same time, Stephen said, “It’s going to be tough for them [to regain U.S. market share]. They hope to join the league of Dell, AST, Compaq and IBM, but a lot of people want to get there.” Pesatori acknowledged that Zenith Data faces strong compe¬ tition. The company’s market- share has shrunk from 5% in the late 1980s to less than 2%, ac¬ cording to industry estimates. The write stuff Zenith Data will demonstrate its first pen-capable sys¬ tem next week at PC Expo in New York, the company confirmed last week. Tentatively called the Z-Notepad, the “technology” demonstration will show a pen option for its Z-Note line of notebooks, according to Katie Klosterman, director of pen- based systems at Zenith Data. She said the Z-Notepad will feature an in-house designed screen that can be pulled off and used separately from the key¬ board, which is unlike the pen-top marketed by Momenta Corp. or the NEC Technologies, Inc. Ultralite SL/20P, but similar to an expected product from Tusk, Inc. The digitized screen ac¬ cepts pen input. The pen will be attached by a cable to the screen, and the screen in turn will be connected to the body of the notebook, giving it power while it is detached. Because the entire notebook screen has to be replaced, Ze¬ nith Data will provide upgrades, which are expected to cost be¬ tween $500 and $1,000 when they are released in the Septem- ber-October time frame, Klosterman said. She added that the pen option will not work with the active-matrix color version of the Z-Note. Z-Notepad will ship with Microsoft Corp.’s Windows for Pen Computing and Slate Corp.’s Day-timer software. Klosterman said Zenith Data will likely support Go Corp.’s PenPoint operat¬ ing system with future, pen-only products that it will build as the market develops. MICHAEL FITZGERALD A complete makeover Zenith Data’s 40+ new systems - ranging from servers and desktop PCs to notebooks - represent a total overhaul of the company’s product line. Here’s a sampling: CPU Hard drive Memory Bus Street price* Z-Station 32SSH Model 80 (includes Ethernet adapter and Super VGA card) 25-MHz 386SX 80M-byte 4M bytes (supports 64) XT/AT $1,799 Z-Station 433DEH Model 200 (includes Ethernet adapter and Super VGA card) 33-MHz 486DX 200M-byte 4M bytes (supports 128) EISA $3,399 Z-Server 450DE (upgradable to P5) RAID-5 capable 50-MHz 486DX 500M-byte 4M bytes (supports 192) EISA $9,399 Z-Sport 325S Model 60 (notebook) 25-MHz 386SX 60M-byte 2M bytes XT/AT $2,199 All products are currently available 'Expected CW Chart: Stephanie Faucher “It is difficult to see it [being] stiffer than what it is today,” Pe¬ satori said. At the same time, he also confirmed that Zenith Data will build 150,000 notebooks an¬ nually on an OEM basis for IBM, which gives it an important source of volume. Range of chips The eight models of the Z-Serv- er line use Intel’s 25-MHz I486SX and 33-MHz and 50- MHz 486DX chips. A pop-out motherboard will allow users to install Intel’s P5 chip when it ap¬ pears later this year. The Z-Station includes 19 models using a range of chips, from Intel’s 25-MHz 386SX to the 25/50-MHz 486DX2 proces¬ sor. The modular, upgradable systems come equipped with Su¬ per VGA, an Ethernet NE2000- compatible module adapter and built-in network shells for No¬ vell, Inc.’s NetWare, Microsoft Corp.’s LAN Manager and Ban¬ yan Systems, Inc.’s Vines pre¬ installed. The Z-Sport, a line of low- cost 386SX and 486SX note¬ books, and two new monitors, in¬ cluding a new 17-in. flat-screen one, were also announced. The new lines add to the Z- Note series of high-end note¬ books [CW, April 6]. A design firm was hired to create a distinctive look with im¬ proved ergonomics. Among oth¬ er things, the new design yielded a cabinet for desktops that can be removed via a single screw and simple, icon-based direc¬ tions for easy upgrades. The new four-part focus will guide Zenith Data through some other “things in the works,” Pe¬ satori said, indicating that these would include other new prod¬ ucts and more distribution agreements that would help the approximately $1.1 billion ven¬ dor become profitable by next year. He pointed to a cut in em¬ ployees, from 4,200 to 2,900, and upcoming products and dis¬ tribution agreements that will help to achieve this. Compaq to take radical track CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 companies to do it.” Analysts said Compaq has a shot at successfully executing its ambitious plan. “They can pull it off — they’ve got the money, and they’ve told Wall Street it will take them a while to re¬ coup,” said Andrew M. Seybold, editor of industry newsletter “The Outlook on Professional Computing” in Boulder Creek, Calif. Added John Dunkle, presi¬ dent of Hampton, N.H. -based market research firm Work¬ Group Technologies, Inc., “When you look at the trend in downsizing, Compaq has the po¬ tential to become a force here.” Some information systems managers contacted last week expressed interest in the plan; others, however, were skepti¬ cal. “The concept is stellar, and if an organization can pull it off, I would expect someone like Com¬ paq could,” said Douglas Mur¬ phy, director of IS at Comcast Corp. “The single point of con¬ tact is nice, but IBM tried it, and there are enough horror stories about that.” “We haven’t found anybody to date that can be on top of ev¬ erything, especially with the rap¬ idly changing industry,” agreed Patty Houk, manager of LAN systems planning at American President Lines in Oakland, Calif. “You get to a certain point in dealing with multiple vendors where you end up with a lot of fingerpointing, and sometimes it is more than difficult to get around the integration issues,” she said. At Texas Commerce Bank- shares, Inc., however, Compaq has passed an initial test with fly¬ ing colors. Allen Coumyer, senior vice president of technology opera¬ tions at the Houston-based bank holding company, said he worked with Compaq, Viewstar Corp. and ComputerLand Corp. to set up a 300-node imaging- based LAN in nine months. “They worked with us . . . hands-on in the development of a very large imaging project, basi¬ cally as a systems integrator. They had a strategic relationship with Viewstar, and [Compaq] solved a lot of things for us, down to the BIOS level,” Coumyer said. Attention grabber He added that “Compaq gets companies’ attention. We looked at communications cards, and they actually resolved some problems for me that I doubt I could have resolved by myself, since I was buying just one or two cards. They also helped us with Novell. Compaq was very responsive.” Coumyer added that he was currently working with Compaq on \"some CICS right-sizing proj¬ ects.” Still, some Compaq users, such as* Eric Singleton, director of IS at the Orange County Ap¬ praisal Office in Orlando, Fla., flatly said they would not go to a single point of contact. IN THE NEW paradigm of the ’90s, [users should] consider Novell almost a division of Compaq, or Intel and Microsoft a division of Compaq. If [users] need changes, we’ll work with the companies to do it.” RONNIE WARD COMPAQ 8 COMPUTERWORLD JUNE 15, 1992 A CMPHUnVE-SERVER DANUBE FROM ORACLE The world’s largest database company introduces a revolutionary new technology called a cooperative-server database. A cooperative-server database hides the complexity of computer networks by enabling applications to access data located on multiple computers just as if all the data were stored on a single computer. In this way, a cooperative-server database simplifies application building and improves decision making by making access to information easier... much easier. “Oracle’s always been the leader in building database technology. One of the great things about Oracle’s approach is that they’re hiding the differences between all the machines out on the network running on various platforms. ” Bill Gates Chairman and CEO Microsoft Corporation “ORACLE 7’s breakthrough in hiding technological complexity is analogous to the ease-of-use breakthroughs accompUshed by the introduction of the Mac in 1984.” “The fundamental problem with early client-server database management systems is that apphcations cannot access data on more than one server without a lot of extra programming. This programmatic approach to accessing data on multiple servers is in stark contrast to the totally automatic approach provided by ORACLE 7. ” Larry Ellison President and CEO Oracle Corporation John Young President and CEO Hewlett-Packard Company John Sculley Chairman and CEO Apple Computer, Inc. “With HP systems and ORACLE7, our customers will have the desktop to high-end performance they need for a fraction of the cost of mainframe computing solutions. ” “ORACLE7 is really solving the complexities of the distributed computing environment cost-effectively. Plus, it supplies the reUabihty and security that are required in a distributed computing environment.

The court, in a 6-3 vote, ruled that Eastman Kodak Co. can be brought to tri¬ al on evidence that it tied the sale of spare parts to the sale of Kodak service con¬ tracts, thus preventing independent ser¬ vice organizations from getting spare parts. In the computer field, experts said, the antitrust ruling will make it easier for in¬ dependent service firms to challenge computer manufacturers’ practice of de¬ nying access to diagnostic software, spare parts or software upgrades unless the customer gets hardware maintenance from the manufacturer. That will be good news for customers, who can expect to benefit from the price competition between inde¬ pendent service providers and hardware manufacturers, said Esther Roditti Schach- ter, an attorney and editor of the “Computer Law & Tax Report” newsletter based in New York. “To say that we’re elated would be an understate¬ ment,” said Rodger Young, an attorney representing Virtual Maintenance, Inc. in Rochester Hills, Mich. The independent computer maintenance firm’s $25.4 mil¬ lion award from an antitrust judgment against Prime Computer, Inc. was re¬ versed on appeal in March, but the Su¬ preme Court ruling makes it likely that the independent firm will ultimately win it back. \"This opens up the so- called aftermarket to the scrutiny of the antitrust laws . . . and will stimulate price competition for maintenance and repair,” Young said. Rebecca Segal, an analyst at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., said third-party service firms usually charge 15% less than the hardware manufactur¬ ers, although the hardware vendor some¬ times offers lower prices in order to hang onto key customers. More options for users Segal said the court ruling will in fact give users more choices, but she warned against an overzealous price war that could reduce service quality. The U.S. computer service market amounted to $18.5 billion last year, she said. In its ruling, the high court rejected Kodak’s economic theory that it is impos¬ sible to monopolize the service aftermar¬ ket when the original equipment market is fiercely competitive. The justices did not rule on the merits of the Kodak case but said there is sufficient evidence of mo- THAT WILL BE good news for customers, who can expect to benefit from the price competition between independent service providers and hardware manufacturers. nopolistic practices to warrant a full trial. Computer manufacturers such as Digi¬ tal Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Unisys Corp. and Wang Laborato¬ ries, Inc. have sided with Kodak, so the ruling is seen as a tactical defeat for them as well, observers said. On the winning side of the case, Ronald S. Katz, a San Francisco attorney repre¬ senting a coalition of independent com¬ puter service firms, predicted that as a re¬ sult of the ruling, the current batch of bundling cases will be resolved in out-of- court settlements. Then there will be a new wave of law¬ suits filed by independent service firms that had stayed on the sidelines until now, Katz said, predicting that many of those suits will be settled, too. The computer industry acknowledged that it will now have to defend its bundling practices in a new round of lawsuits. “Af¬ ter it all shakes out, hopefully these prac¬ tices will be quite secure, but there may be some litigation around the edges,” said Simon Lazarus III, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers As¬ sociation.

BOZMAN CW STAFF NEW YORK — After a three- year prelude, Oracle Corp. will unveil today its next-generation relational database management system, pitching it to informa¬ tion systems shops that are mov¬ ing from monolithic to distribut¬ ed client/server architectures. Oracle will trumpet Version alysts said last week. Sources close to Oracle said new features were added to counter a new wave of competitors’ products. “When you have the domi¬ nant market share in an industry, you don’t have to leapfrog the competition. Just being status quo can be very powerful,” said Terence Quinn, a vice president of research at Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York.

The distributed database software was delayed by more than a year for both technical and marketing reasons, industry an¬ Version 7.0 — or Coopera¬ tive Server, as it is expected to be dubbed — allows users to store application code right in¬ side the database engine. The “stored procedures” code can be reused, making for quicker response times because those in¬ structions do not travel over a network to reach the database. Overall programming time is also reduced because application programs on client machines can “trigger” the server’s stored procedures, users said. “Oracle is giving you the tools,” said James Bosco, a sys¬ tems consultant at ITT Hartford Life Cos.’ Employee Benefits Di¬ vision in Hartford, Conn. The Hartford is one of Oracle’s 14 Al¬ liance Partners that have tested Version 7.0 code since August 1991. “You have to know when to use them,” Bosco said.

Kenny Co., a municipal bond firm in New York, said Version 7.0 was ap¬ preciably faster than older ver¬ sions. “Historically, when we ran Oracle in a LAN, we got 10 transactions per second. When we ran it in a VAXcluster, we got 30 to 40 transactions per sec¬ ond. And now we’re getting 300 to 500 transactions per second on a Sequent 2000 Model 750,” he said. However, some analysts re¬ main skeptical about the robust¬ ness of the Alliance Partner tests, which were often limited to one or two physically isolated machines. \"They haven’t stress-tested Version 7.0 as if they were run¬ ning it in a production mode,” said Charles Phillips, a senior software analyst at SoundView Financial Group, Inc. in Stam¬ ford, Conn. “More bugs may come out when users really start using all of Version 7.0’s fea¬ tures.” Some early users have al¬ ready tried to put Oracle’s dis¬ tributed processing and recov¬ ery claims to the test. A team of database programmers at Mobil Corp.’s Paulsboro, N.J., refinery tried to crash the Version 7.0 system in order to show its resil¬ ience. “We submitted a job to run just three minutes before the host machine went off-line,” said Bob Manieri, a database adminis¬ trator. “We let it get clobbered because the machine was shut off.” The team then queried the in¬ terrupted database to see what data survived and whether bro¬ ken transactions had disap¬ peared. “Everything got rolled back and taken away,” Manieri said, “just as it should have.” Many Oracle 6.0 users are ex¬ pected to migrate to Version 7.0 next year. Some will get free up¬ grades for options providing pro¬ cedural programming and paral¬ lel server functions [CW. March 23]. RDBMS vendors claim they have shadowboxed with Version 7.0 in user bids since 1990. “They’ve talked to customers about it, and we’ve had to ad¬ dress it competitively even though it hasn’t been in the mar¬ ket openly,” said Stewart Schus¬ ter, vice president of marketing at Sybase, Inc. The Ask Cos.’ Ingres Prod¬ ucts Division wrote a white pa¬ per that compared Ingres with Oracle Version 7.0 features, many of which Ingres claimed to have had since the late 1980s. Informix Software, Inc. said its product answers most Version 7.0 features, except for a multi¬ threaded server expected to ship this year (see chart). Experience talks The following are a few tips from users who have tried distributed database technology: • Plan carefully. Trying to update too many data¬ base servers simultaneously may slow down your data network. You may decide that some servers can be up¬ dated overnight or later in the same day. • Review security procedures. You do not want your users to have to log on to each database server they access. You may decide to assign those access rights to database applications. • Pick a reference point for your global network. Many users have picked Greenwich Mean Time for time/date stamps throughout the network. • Do not try to do too much, too soon. Establish a pilot pro¬ gram with a small number of distributed databases, learn how to work with them and then build up your inventory of distribut¬ ed database servers. JEAN S. BOZMAN FBI closes bulletin board, seeking piracy evidence BY JAMES DALY CW STAFF MILLBURY, Mass. — Federal Bureau of Investigation agents last week began a long, hot sum¬ mer of strikes against software pirates when they raided the headquarters of an international computer bulletin board that was allegedly distributing more than 200 illegally copied software programs. The move against the Davy Jones Locker service, based here, marked the first time fed¬ eral agents have closed a bulletin board for distributing copyright¬ ed programs — and signals a new crackdown on software pi¬ racy. \"We expect the pace of these raids to accelerate as the FBI discovers that the prosecution of copyright infringement crimes is easier than they thought,” said Ken Wasch, executive director of the Software Publishers Asso¬ ciation (SPA), a Washington, D.C.-based trade group that tipped the FBI on the case. Several similar raids on other bulletin boards are already in the advanced planning stages, Wasch said. SPA officials said the federal government is only just begin¬ ning to recognize the serious¬ ness of the billions of dollars that software makers lose each year as a result of illegally copying their programs. In related news last week, the Senate passed a bill that would make the illegal distribution of copyrighted software a felony. Executing a criminal search warrant, six FBI agents raided the base of Davy Jones Locker and seized several personal com¬ puters, modems, financial re¬ cords and a program that was used by the board. Although the FBI made no arrests, the seized material will be examined to de¬ termine if an arrest warrant should be filed. Meanwhile, the SPA filed a civil lawsuit against the alleged operator of the bulletin board, Richard Kenadek, and charged him with violat¬ ing copyright laws. Kenadek could not be reached for com¬ ment. SPA officials said they have not determined whether to go af¬ ter the people who downloaded the bootleg software. For a $99 yearly fee, the Davy Jones Locker bulletin board offered subscribers in 36 states and 1 1 countries the abili¬ months ago ty to download a wide menu of popular business and entertain¬ ment packages, including well- known offerings from Borland International, Inc., IBM, Micro¬ soft Corp., Lotus Development Corp., Software Publishing Corp., Symantec Corp., Word¬ Perfect Corp., Autodesk, Inc. and Fox Software, Inc. The SPA only became aware of the illegal activities several through various computerized messages, but the board has been in opera¬ tion for years, Wasch said. Subscribers to Davy Jones Locker not only download¬ ed copyrighted software but were encouraged to contribute additional copyrighted programs to the well. “Imagine a video store that lets you make illegal duplicates of copyrighted movies onto blank video tapes, but limits the number of movies you can copy unless you bring in new inven¬ tory — copies of new movies not already on the shelves,” said Ilene Rosenthal, SPA’s director of litigation. Some observers said the FBI raid will prove to be more of a scare tactic than an actual deter¬ rent to crime. “While the FBI’s raid was ap¬ propriate, I still think only a small percentage of software pi¬ racy is being done on bulletin boards. Most of it occurs every day in the offices of big busi¬ ness,” claimed Mike Godwin, staff counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation in Cam¬ bridge, Mass. Wasch acknowledged that the SPA has not paid enough atten¬ tion to illegal pirating activity on bulletin boards in the past. “But now we’re going to con¬ centrate on it,” he said, estimat¬ ing that of the thousands of com¬ puter bulletin boards that exist, perhaps “several hundred” en¬ courage the practice of down¬ loading copyrighted software. 12 COMPUTERWORLD JUNE 15, 1992 Informix Database Technology Helps World Vision Reach The Children.

NEWS DEC flip-flops workstation strategy CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 Whether these assurances from DEC will restore its credi¬ bility with customers is an open question, however. “DEC has changed stories so many times, changed products so many times and changed dates and promises so many times that I simply do not trust DEC any longer,” said Robert Granvin, the computing administrator at the University of Minnesota’s School of Statis¬ tics, which has about two dozen A change of heart DEC's decision to extend its DEC/OSF/1 offering will be good news for many user sites Worldwide installed base of 76,637 DECstations/ DECsystems 39,127 DECstations. Granvin offered some advice for DEC’s management: “Please don’t ever do this again. My Maalox budget is completely shot.” Several users said they be¬ lieved the controversy could cost DEC dearly in sales lost to Sun Microsystems, Inc., IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co. “I don’t think I would buy a DECstation now, although I will probably upgrade my existing boxes,” said Ken Krallman, MIS director at Carleton Technol¬ ogies, Inc. in Orchard Park, N.Y. “It scares me that they haven’t got the troops all marching in the same direction.” Some users also expressed concern about the delay until 1993 for delivery of a produc¬ tion-quality DEC/OSF/1. That is likely to hurt software develop¬ ers who were planning to use DECstations to develop applica¬ tions for Alpha systems, they said. DEC’s overall strat¬ egy remains based on migrating all of its VAX/VMS and Ultrix customers to the up¬ coming Alpha systems, which will run VMS, OSF/1 or Microsoft Corp.’s Windows New Technology (NT). Matt Kochan, a DEC marketing executive, tried last week to por¬ tray the controversy as a “misunderstanding” by the press and indus¬ try analysts, whom he said mistook personal opinions of DEC execu¬ tives for official compa¬ ny positions. Industry observers rejected that notion as absurd. “This has been a disaster for DEC,” said Thomas Kucharvy, president of Summit Strategies, Inc. in Boston. “I think they finally made the right choice, but they’ve sort of shaken my confidence a little bit,” said Jim Reiss, a software engineer at Accelr8 Technology Corp. in Denver. “I would say the damage is minor, but it will affect people’s buying decisions for at least a year or two. Nobody likes a vendor waffling like that.” “As long as they give me a reasonable release of Ultrix, I can live with that,” said Mo- hamed El-Lozy, director of sci¬ entific computing at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Bos¬ ton. “What I cannot live with is being orphaned: having Ultrix development stopped and never being able to get to OSF / 1 . ” Struggling for power Sources close to DEC said its Unix group has been caught up in power struggles between a handful of top executives and Da¬ vid Stone, DEC’s vice president of software engineering. In the most recent reorganization, Stone gained control over the Unix workstation group, and his decision to halt OSF/1 develop¬ ment on future DECstations re¬ portedly caused as much of an in¬ ternal uproar as it did an external one. Kochan said DEC heard from hundreds of alarmed customers, in comments collected by sales representatives, during the past two weeks. Many had counted on being able to migrate their Ul¬ trix applications to OSF/1 on the Mips-based DECstations. “I think they wanted to save money by dropping OSF/1 devel¬ opment on the Mips line, so they wouldn’t have to maintain the [operating system] kernel on two architectures,” said Michael Santangelo, Unix and VMS sys¬ tems manager at the University of Maryland University College in College Park. “It was very good to hear they’ve changed their minds. It’s called coming to your senses before losing a great deal of market share.” Source: Computer Intelligence/Infocorp DEC user society to educate users on migrating to Alpha BY MELINDA-CAROL BALLOU CW STAFF MAYNARD, Mass. — The Digi¬ tal Equipment Computer Users Society (DECUS) will offer DEC users advice and the tools need¬ ed to migrate to the next-gener¬ ation Alpha systems at a sympo¬ sium this fall in Anaheim, Calif. DECUS officials said they will focus on migration at the sympo¬ sium to educate users, many of whom are concerned over this is¬ sue. Digital Equipment Corp. us¬ ers can expect data about tools that can ease the transition to Al¬ pha and to supplement those of¬ ferings with their own kit. Many DECUS officials will speak from experience. Some, in fact, are in the process of porting major portions of DECUS’ own VMS Starter Kit to Alpha VMS for release at that time. “There will be seminars pre¬ ceding the week-long sympo¬ sium, and we’ll be offering the whole shebang — everything you need to do conversion and porting,” said Rich Dejordy, a technical specialist at The Faxon Co. in Westwood, Mass., and chairman of DECUS’ VMS Spe¬ cial Interest Group. “By then we hope to have a good body of us¬ ers who will have done it, and you’ll be able to talk to them di¬ rectly.” The DECUS Starter Kit will offer the most popular applica¬ tions and tools available with the current VMS Kit, including Ker- mit; Command File, which lets users tweak attributes of files on the system; The Verb, which an¬ alyzes Digital Command Lan¬ guage command tables; Watch¬ er, which shuts down idle terminal processes; and Modify, Set and Default utilities. Problems in making the tran¬ sition to Alpha are generally minimal, provided developers were disciplined in their code¬ writing, according to several members of DECUS involved with porting millions of lines of the VMS Starter Kit to Alpha. “There have been headaches where there were bad program¬ ming practices and people didn’t adhere to standards,” said Ted Nieland, a senior communica¬ tions consultant at Hassler Com¬ munication Systems Technology in Dayton, Ohio, and a member of the VMSSIG and the library committee at DECUS. Some information systems managers, however, are worried about the VAX-to-Alpha migra¬ tion. “There is a lot of code out there which is dependent on lit¬ tle quirks in the operating sys¬ tem or on the [VAX hardware],” said Connie Beckman, director of computing services at Alfred University in Alfred, N.Y. “I’m worried about what will happen IBM endorses fiber for workstations - BY ELISABETH HORWITT CW STAFF WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — IBM last week announced its inten¬ tion to add the American Nation¬ al Standards Institute’s (ANSI) Fibre Channel Standard (FCS) to its artillery of high-speed, fiber- based networking products. IBM and fiber switch vendor Ancor Communications, Inc. said they are co-developing an FCS-based switch that will “tightly couple” IBM RISC Sys- tem/6000s at speeds of up to 1G bit/sec. The switch will be avail¬ able within two years, IBM said. For companies looking for a shorter term solution, Ultra Network Technologies is ex¬ pected next week to announce the UltraNet RS/6000 Network Processor, a proprietary, fiber- based network adapter. The product is scheduled for avail¬ ability next month, and it is priced at $6,500. Supportive technology FCS, now in draft form at ANSI, defines a nonblocking technol¬ ogy that can support hundreds or even thousands of simultaneous, uninterrupted connections “with little or no contention,” an IBM spokesman said. IBM will initially target the switch at us¬ ers of distributed computing en¬ vironments and other applica¬ tions that require multiple RS/6000s to be “loosely clus¬ tered” in a local or campus envi¬ ronment, he added. The National Center for Su¬ percomputing Applications is al¬ ready discussing FCS’ potential usefulness with IBM, said Randy Butler, manager of network technology at the University of Illinois facility. IBM has told the center that its Fibre Channel switch will provide the same throughput as ANSI’s High Per¬ formance Parallel Interface (HPPI) standard but will beat both HPPI and Fiber Distributed Data Interface networks in terms of cost, Butler said. But the center already uses Ultra Network’s UltraNet net¬ work to interconnect a hetero¬ geneous environment of Cray Research, Inc., Convex Comput¬ er Corp. and Silicon Graphics, Inc. systems. Now the university is considering using Ultra Net¬ work’s new RS/6000 product. “We don’t want a network that just links RS/6000s,” Butler said. “It’s good that IBM is pro¬ moting [the standard] to other vendors.” Not for mainframes However, IBM emphasized that it has made no definite plans to port FCS to its mainframe pro¬ cessors, adding that it sees FCS as complementing, not compet¬ ing with, its fiber-based Escon for mainframes. Mansfield did say that FCS could be used as a higher speed alternative to Es¬ con, which supports only approx¬ imately 130M bit/sec. IBM’s Fibre Channel switch will initially support Transmis¬ sion Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), as well as the IPI3 disk access protocol and Small Computer Systems Inter¬ face, IBM said. Ultra Network’s product also supports TCP/IP. It has a total bandwidth that is only 25% of FCS’, according to company spokesman Kent Bossange. However, Ultra Network’s pro¬ prietary software enables mul¬ tiuser RS/6000s to realize a throughput of up to 110M bit/ sec. — a far greater percentage of total bandwidth than is typical in fiber-based networks, Bos¬ sange said. to our applications — we have 1,600 programs which we devel¬ oped ourselves. I expect it to take months.” But according to some DECUS officials, the process may not be as painful as people think. All in the planning With careful planning and code that follows the rules, migration ought not to be significantly dif¬ ferent than moving from Version 4.0 of VMS to Version 5.0, ac¬ cording to Dejordy. DEC will also provide tools that help users find VAX -depen¬ dent code, and it will soon open migration centers for users. Key to the strategy is DEC’s Gem cross compiler, which al¬ lows application migration for programs written in high-level languages such as Fortran, C and Cobol. The GEM compiler levels performance differences be¬ tween languages as a result of its back-end optimization, accord¬ ing to Nieland, minimizing the need to write for Fortran when seeking high performance. For programs that are writ¬ ten in lower level Macro assem¬ bler code, DEC is offering a Mac¬ ro compiler, which acts as a complex instruction set comput¬ ing-to-reduced instruction set computing translator, turning the Macro code into a higher lev¬ el language. DEC is also offering a series of translation tools for those who do not have access to source code, or for languages for which DEC is not providing compilers. 14 COMPUTERWORLD JUNE 15, 1992 NEWS Borland stalks IS dollars CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 land’s director of sales marketing. “At this point, we’re a day late and a dollar short,” conceded Snyder, who said the August programs were designed to remedy the situation. Among the moves to be disclosed are the following: • Strategic sales and marketing agree¬ ments with half a dozen large systems in¬ tegrators. • Borland’s top nonsales executive will call on some large corporate accounts. • A volume licensing agreement that would allow IS shops to qualify for dis¬ counts on products purchased through re¬ sellers. • A series of seminars designed to edu¬ cate IS executives on Borland’s product line. The PC software company is negotiat¬ ing agreements that call for joint sales calls with half a dozen integrators. The firm expects to finalize terms during the next several weeks, Synder said. He declined to reveal the names of the integrators, but one source inside Borland Borland will appoint each of its vice presidents as the lead point of contact for specific corporate accounts. said the company is talking to Electronic Data Systems Corp., Andersen Consult¬ ing, Computer Sciences Corp. and De- loitte & Touche, among others. In an interview last summer, Borland Chairman Philippe Kahn insisted that the internal consulting efforts then recently launched by rivals Microsoft and Lotus constituted the wrong approach. It was better, he said, to partner with third-par¬ ty consultants than to compete with them. Analysts said partnering with integra¬ tors or other companies better known to IS management should help Borland’s corporate sales effort. Borland now has a small direct sales team of about 50 and generates most of its overall sales through mail order and resellers. “I don’t think any desktop company can go to the next level by themselves,” observed Michael Heylin, a senior asso¬ ciate at market research firm Creative Strategies Research International, Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif. “MIS is the next gatekeeper they have to go through,” added Neal Hill, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. “I think the systems integrators are key [to making those high- level IS contacts] because a lot of the MIS people really don’t know Borland.” VP contacts Under a program that Borland will call Executive Adopt an Account, Borland will appoint each of its vice presidents — in¬ cluding those in charge of such nonsales areas as finance, operations and IS — as the lead point of contact for specific cor¬ porate accounts. “Their job will be to build a personal relationship with the senior IS manager or CIO,” Snyder explained. According to Snyder, Kahn has been very active in making personal calls on IS chiefs and will continue to be. “We want to broaden that activity among all the executives,” Sny¬ der said. Analysts such as Hill said the program sounds like “a step in the right direction,” but he expressed some skepticism. “It’s one of those things that sounds like a good idea that others have tried, but does it work? I mean, the [vice president] of finance has a job to do,” he said. The educational seminars should be useful in explaining the intricacies of Bor¬ land’s forthcoming PC version of its Inter- base client/server database. The new ver¬ sion will tie the Paradox and dBase front ends into the Interbase engine. Unlike Borland, which is moving up to the client/ server model from a sin¬ gle-user orientation, many of the other client/server vendors have moved down from a larger system envi¬ ronment and therefore are more entrenched in IS shops. “Borland wasn’t the first on the block, so they’ll have to work hard¬ er and work smarter,” said Greg Salcedo, a systems analyst at Boeing Computer Services in Seattle. Other programs slated for an August launch include what Sny¬ der called a “Sales Agent” plan in which Borland will authorize its resellers to offer volume license agreements. Snyder said Borland now offers an in¬ formal volume program only on a direct basis. He also said the Sales Agent initiative will pro¬ vide a more structured, ac¬ cessible volume plan, but he did not elaborate. Also in August, Borland will be¬ gin offering a maintenance contract to all IS users — not just volume license customers — that provides dis¬ counted upgrades, Snyder said.

IBM rings up grocery outsourcing contract BY JOHANNA AMBROSIO CW STAFF TARRYTOWN, N.Y. — IBM’s outsourcing unit last week served a soup-to-nuts deal to a supermarket chain. Harvest Foods in Little Rock, Ark., has contracted with IBM’s Integrated Systems Solutions Corp. (ISSC) for data center op¬ erations, data network and appli¬ cations development. The value of the 10-year deal was not dis¬ closed. ‘‘They’ll be running all our data processing services — maintenance, operations, devel¬ opment, you name it,” said Rob¬ ert Rough, chief financial officer at Harvest Foods. The company operates 54 stores in four South¬ ern states. Also part of the deal are new applications that ISSC will devel¬ op and implement, including in¬ store systems for checkout and customer service and electronic funds transfer, as well as other functions that Rough would not specify. For now, ISSC will run Har¬ vest Foods’ existing data center, which houses an Enterprise Sys¬ tem 9000 mainframe. In the fu¬ ture, Rough said, ISSC may move the company’s operations into one of its own data centers. All of Harvest Foods’ 26 infor¬ mation systems employees will work for ISSC when the contract begins July 1. Among the factors that were considered before outsourcing, Rough said, were “financial as¬ pects” that included both “hard dollars and soft dollars in terms of developing new applications more quickly than we could have otherwise.” Another reason for signing up was “we felt we could give our employees better opportunities. Being a data processing person for a grocery chain, there’s only so far you can go,” he said. Strain in EDS/Signet pact CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 One Signet source said EDS proposed the shift in order to save money through payroll reductions and to be able to move processing to its larger machines in Herndon where it benefits from greater economies of scale. Signet’s interest is in freeing up space now occupied by IBM, Amdahl Corp. and Unisys Corp. mainframes for other purposes, according to Dieter. An EDS spokesman declined to comment on the Dallas-based systems integrator’s interest in tion to some of the employees af¬ fected by the possible move, he said. Dieter last week described the data center proposal as one of many contract changes on the table at Signet, both inside and outside of data processing opera¬ tions, all aimed at running the bank more efficiently. A source close to both compa¬ nies said switching data centers would entail a renegotiation in terms and conditions, because the original contract called for operations to stay on-site here. THAT CONVERSION, which was to have been completed by May 1 — 12 months after the contract signing — has fallen almost five months behind schedule. changing venues. Dieter would not say exactly how many jobs may be threat¬ ened. Of the 250 employees, he said approximately 150 pro¬ grammers and analysts would retain their jobs and would oper¬ ate from Richmond through re¬ mote connections to Herndon. A handful of employees who work in areas that would not transfer to Herndon would also keep their jobs, according to Di¬ eter. Those include workers that run Signet’s Tandem Comput¬ ers, Inc. -based automated teller machine operations and those who work in the company’s print facilities. EDS may offer reloca- Dieter said the revised terms would be worked out during the course of the evaluation. The current EDS/Signet con¬ tract calls for EDS to consolidate Signet’s Unisys, Amdahl and IBM mainframes onto Amdahl and IBM-only platforms at the bank’s Shore Point data center located outside of Richmond. EDS took over ownership of Signet’s mainframes early in the contract and would either sell or move the IBM and Amdahl iron in the event of a data center shift.

ROSEMARY HAMILTON and Washington, D.C., had accu¬ mulated an unweildy combina¬ tion of various hardware and software brands. This in turn led it to an outsourcing pact with EDS. Slow hand The contract also called for EDS to convert Signet’s slew of third- party and in-house banking pro¬ grams to a single integrated banking package provided by Software Alliance Corp. in Berkeley, Calif. That conversion, which was to have been completed by May 1 — 12 months after the con¬ tract signing — has fallen almost five months behind schedule. The two companies are now tar¬ geting Sept. 17, Dieter said. “The project was a lot larger and bigger than we originally es¬ timated,” Dieter said, referring to the software conversion. In a separate data processing matter at Signet, Dieter said the company is considering convert¬ ing its Unisys check sorting op¬ eration in Baltimore into a Un¬ isys image-based system. Dieter also said that a sepa¬ rate outsourcing deal calling for St. Louis-based CSI Technol¬ ogies, Inc. to take over the bank’s Mastercard operations is on schedule and that CSI should take over operations by August. 16 COMPUTERWORLD JUNE 15, 1992 YES, I want to receive my own copy of COMPUTERWORLD each week.
