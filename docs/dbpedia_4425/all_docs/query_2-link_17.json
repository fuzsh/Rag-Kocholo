        "text": "Vastly greater numbers of electric cars on United Kingdom roads could pose problems for the power supplies used to recharge them—if, that is, they all plug in during the day. Frank Mitchell, head of SP Energy Networks a unit of ScottishPower, said a rush to electric cars in the U.K. could burden the power grid if owners opt to charge those cars during peak hours when electricity demand is highest. Mitchell told the U.K.'s Financial Times late last year that charging in the high-demand hours shouldn't be restricted, but owners who add electrons during peak times “then have to pick...\n\nScotland fuels car with biobutanol derived from whiskey production\n\nElectric cars may receive most of the attention within the realm of alternative propulsion methods, but liquid hydrocarbon fuels will be with us for many decades to come. The challenge then becomes how to reduce the carbon footprint of extracting, transporting, refining, and burning those fuels to...\n\nSean Szymkowski July 21, 2017\n\nScotland Launches New Electric-Car Incentive: Interest-Free Loans To Buy\n\nIncentives to purchase zero-emission cars come in a wild variety of types, from California's rebates--essentially a four-figure check in the mail--to single-occupant access to carpool lanes. The U.S. government has a Federal income-tax credit of $2,500 to $7,500 for purchase of a plug-in car that...\n\nJohn Voelcker August 31, 2015\n\nElectric Cars To Aid Scottish Independence From England?\n\nEngland has been at war with many dozens of countries over the last few millenia, but its neighbor to the north has to be one of its most frequent rivals.

That's why Fisker and Scottish leather producer Bridge of Weir have announced their partnership for the Karma. The...\n\nAntony Ingram November 17, 2011\n\nSingle-Malt Powered Electric Car Offers Travel Sans Hangover\n\nYou might feel a little \"green around the gills\" the following morning, but a night of drinking Bruichladdich whisky from the UK helps to do your bit for green transportation. Mark Reynier is managing director of the whisky distillery in Scotland, and every day drives to work in his recently...\n\nAntony Ingram August 10, 2011\n\nWhisky-Based Biofuel Developed In Scotland\n\nThere seems to be no end to the number of organic materials that can be converted into usable biofuel to power a car. We’ve seen fuel derived from garbage before, a race car that ran on chocolate, and even a Volkswagen Beetle running on fuel generated from human waste, and now we have news of a...\n\nViknesh Vijayenthiran August 19, 2010"
