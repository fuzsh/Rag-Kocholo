        "text": "This is the view from the road. While travelling from one picturesque location to another on the Isle of Skye, the Cuillin is the dominant feature of the landscape that will have you stopping at every available opportunity, of which there are few.\n\nSince I was having problems with my knees before my trip, I almost cancelled because I wasn’t going to be able to do any hiking. But in the end I decided to go anyway because surely there would be some shots I could get from the road. Good call!\n\nThe Cuillin is a mountain range on the Isle of Skye that has two sides separated by the Glen Sligachan (Glen is a Scottish term for valley). On one side is the Black Cuillin which has high dramatic peaks including 11 Munros (a Scottish term for a mountain that is over 3,000 feet). This is where the experienced hikers go. On the other side is the Red Cuillin, which has smaller, rounded, vegetation covered hills.\n\nSligachan River\n\nWhen I arrived on the Isle of Skye, my first stop was at the Sligachan River. My rubber boots came the rescue once again as I trudged through the bog, each step making a sucking sound as I pulled my boot out until I got to the rocky river’s edge.\n\nThe river is stunning especially with the autumn foliage lining each side and the Black Cuillin in the background. I was pretty happy with my very first stop on Skye.\n\nThe Black Cuillin\n\nAlways majestic, the jagged peaks of the Black Cuillin are made all the more dramatic by the ever changing clouds. I’ve heard that hiking the Black Cuillin is what dreams and nightmares are made of.\n\nThe Red Cuillin\n\nThe rolling hills of the Red Cuillin appear more gentle in comparison to the Black Cuillin, but still contain challenging hikes. At the B&B, people described their hikes on the Red Cuillin as punishing and fierce, but at least you don’t have to be a rock climber or mountaineer to attempt it. Maybe next time!\n\nThe only problem photographing The Cuillin from the road is that there are not many places to pull over. I saw so many dramatic landscapes that I desperately wanted to photograph, but there was nowhere to park! The roads have absolutely no shoulder whatsoever, and on the edge is the bog that will undoubtedly suck your car in. I didn’t want to be one of the many tourists I saw waiting for a tow!\n\nBut still, I managed to stop where I could and get some photos I am happy with either right from the road or by walking a short distance. If I go again, I’ll take my dashcam because the drive is incredible."
