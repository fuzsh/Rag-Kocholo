        "text": "Just Stop Oil eco-warriors have vowed to continue blocking the entrance to a depot in Scotland until they are 'forcibly removed' as part of their latest effort to disrupt Britain's oil supply and persuade the government to stop future fossil fuel investments.\n\nThe mostly Gen Z activists have also climbed among the pipes and atop tankers at the Nustar Clydebank terminal, near Glasgow, resulting in dozens of police officers being called to the scene.\n\nIn videos posted on Twitter, groups of activists can be seen holding up orange banners carrying their organisation's name, while demonstrators - some as young as 17 - warn they will push on with their 'disruptive action' across the country until the UK government releases a 'meaningful' statement agreeing to their demands.\n\nIt comes just days after a total of 35 people were cuffed after members of the eco-mob damaged pumps and glued themselves to the tarmac and vehicles at two petrol stations on the M25.\n\nMeanwhile, drivers were warned last night that Petrol and diesel prices could hit new records within weeks – just in time for the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday getaway in early June.\n\nOne protestor told Capital Scotland News on Tuesday that the group's demand to stop investment for new oil fields that 'won't be operational for decades to come' was 'more than reasonable'.\n\nHe added: 'We don't want to be here, we don't want to be inconveniencing people, we don't want to be shutting people out of their work, we don't want to have police here wasting their time with this frankly, when they have got better things to be doing...\n\n'Our plan is to stay here until we are forcibly removed, and over the longer term we are going to keep doing these disruptive actions until we get a meaningful statement from the government that they're going to halt the expansion of oil and gas.'\n\nA spokesperson for the group told MailOnline there have yet to be any arrests and that many plan to protest at the Scottish site 'for several days'.\n\nIn one video recorded in the early hours of this morning, a 20-year-old named Eilidh said her generation will 'have no future' if fossil fuels are not stopped, before taking a swipe at older generations who 'should have done this years ago'.\n\nThe group said up to 40 of its members descended on the terminal at around 4am and climbed on top of tankers and 'locked on at the entrance.'\n\nIt said others entered the terminal itself where 12 protesters are sitting on pipes and three are on the silos to halt operations.\n\nIt is the group's first action in Scotland since they began disrupting the UK's oil supply on April 1, in a campaign which has seen more than 1,000 arrests.\n\nJust Stop Oil's protests were partially to blame for previous price increases after they blocked several oil terminals in the south east of the country at the beginning of last month.\n\nIn her video address this morning, Eilidh said: 'Oil destroys communities, one in four people in Scotland live in fuel poverty, the drilling of oil is on our doorstep... it does not benefit any of us apart from the CEOs.\n\n'We need to stop this now, we should have done this years ago.\n\n'It shouldn't be me sitting on this road, it should have been the generation before me.\n\n'I'm here now because I don't have a choice. I'm really desperate. If we don't act now then none of us will have a future.'\n\nIn a later video, 17-year-old Jasmine Robertson spoke to the camera while sitting under an umbrella in the rain by the site's entrance.\n\nShe said she grew up in the Highlands and 'knows how great wind farms and renewable sources of energy can be' for Scotland.\n\nShe said: 'I'm protesting because I know the future is not oil... and I'm scared for my future and for the generations to come, and for everyone else in the world suffering already.\n\n'I'm here because I know scientists have told us we cannot continue to function this way, and that the government is continuing to fund and source new oil in the North Sea... we can't continue to do this our future is not going to be liveable.'\n\nThe activists have said they are taking action in support of their demand that the UK Government ends new oil and gas projects in the UK.\n\nNeil Rothnie, 69, a retired offshore oil and gas worker from Glasgow, said: 'North Sea oil and gas does not offer energy security. The North Sea oil and gas industry has one priority and it is not the climate crisis. It's not the future of North Sea oil and gas workers.\n\n'And it's certainly not whether the poor can stay warm. If the Government was serious about a just transition, we would be seeing it here in Scotland.\n\n'Where are the turbine factories in Scotland? Where are the yards building platforms for offshore wind? Where are the projects to properly insulate our houses? When will we get free public transport?'\n\nA Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Officers are currently engaging with a group of people who are carrying out a protest at Rothesay Dock in Clydebank, which was reported to police around 4.10am on Tuesday 3 May 2022.\n\n'Police Scotland is a rights-based organisation that puts our values of integrity, fairness, respect and a commitment to upholding human rights at the heart of everything we do.\n\n'This means that we will protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest, balanced against the rights of the wider community.'\n\nIt comes after a mob of 40 Just Stop Oil activists descended on Cobham Services and the Clacket Lane Services in Kent at around 7am last Thursday, before sitting outside the entrances and gluing themselves to the tarmac.\n\nIt was not until 2pm that Surrey Police announced 40 officers had cleared the demonstrators from the forecourts - but they again faced questions about why they did not act faster to remove the group, who vowed to continue causing hell to drivers at further stunts in the coming weeks.\n\nThe force said it had to use specialist de-bonding equipment to remove the protesters.\n\nJust Stop Oil claim 1,000 activists have been arrested since the start of the month, when they blocked a series of oil terminals in a move that was partially blamed for pushing up petrol prices.\n\nSurrey Police said the stunts had caused 'considerable disruption' and 'huge financial loss' with the pumps switched off and motorists being diverted away from both stations.\n\nIt comes after analysis by the AA, released yesterday, found wholesale prices surged by 5p a litre last week – a rise which takes two to three weeks to be passed on at the pumps.\n\nIt could mean a repeat of the situation in March, when prices were hitting new records daily.\n\nThe latest figures show average fuel prices were 162.4p a litre for petrol and 176.5p for diesel last week, down from a record 167.3p and 179.9p.\n\nThe AA's Luke Bosdet said: 'Drivers need to brace themselves for a jump in the cost of petrol.'\n\nIt is the latest hammer blow for Britain's 33million motorists, many of whom are already feeling the pinch and cutting back on journeys due to the spiralling cost of living.\n\nIt also spells pain at the pumps for drivers planning on getaways during next month's Platinum Jubilee Bank Holiday and over the summer.\n\nThe four-day Bank Holiday has been created to mark the Queen's 70 years on the throne.\n\nMillions are expected to take to the roads to be with friends and family for a series of events across the country marking the milestone.\n\nPrices were hitting new daily records for several weeks up until mid-March after the war in Ukraine pushed up costs amid fears of future fuel shortages. Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer.\n\nPump prices only started falling after Chancellor Rishi Sunak slashed fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p a litre in his March mini-budget.\n\nMr Bosdet said: 'Supermarkets, because of their contracts, will take longer to pass on the increases and that is where drivers should be heading to keep their costs down.'\n\nHe said motorists should look to adjust their driving style if they want to further cut back on costs.\n\n'Motorists can soften the impact of the pump price rises,' he said, 'by moderating their speeds and smoothing their driving by leaving more space between them and the car in front.\n\n'Accelerating more gently can also save pounds.'\n\nHe said one of the major factors pushing up prices was a predicted surge in demand for fuel in America and other countries as their drivers start to hit the road for their summer holidays, with the extra global demand inflating prices.\n\nHe added: 'The predictable seasonal boost to petrol prices is coming into play.' The continued war in Ukraine also continues to have an impact.\n\nIn March, average petrol and diesel prices surged more than any other month on record - 11p and 22p a litre respectively - meaning motorists have already endured the most costly Easter and early May Bank Holiday getaways on record.\n\nIt is often at least a few weeks before retailers pass on wholesale increases because this is the time it takes to sell their cheaper stocks before re-stocking at the higher price."
