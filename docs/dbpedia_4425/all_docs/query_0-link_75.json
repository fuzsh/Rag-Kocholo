        "text": "CLIMATE campaigners climbed to the top of The Kelpies tourist attraction today as part of action targeted at the fossil fuel industry in Scotland.\n\nTwo activists from This Is Rigged scaled the 100ft steel equine sculptures between Falkirk and Grangemouth at 5am.\n\nThey said they would “not be lured underwater” by the fossil fuel industry, in reference to Scottish folklore where kelpies were shape-shifting creatures that charmed young children before drowning them.\n\nThe popular tourist attraction was forced to close as the protesters remained on the landmark later into the afternoon.\n\nOne of the climbers said: “The Kelpies is a monument to the horses and the people who’ve worked to develop our industry and agriculture to where it is today, yet the Scottish government is now leaving our oil workers without support for a fair transition to renewables.\n\n“This means unemployment, insecurity and exploitation for workers as well as fossil-fuelled climate collapse.\n\n“Horses powered our past and renewables power our future. Continuing fossil fuel extraction will power nothing but our death.”\n\nLast week, protesters from the group staged blockades at oil terminals in Grangemouth and Clydebank, which stopped oil tanker deliveries across the country."
