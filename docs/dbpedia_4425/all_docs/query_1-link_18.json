        "text": "Ever feel impotent in the face of doom and crisis that surrounds us?\n\nRead this.\n\nAt 7pm last night three people blocked Powdrake Road in Grangemouth by locking themselves to a washing machine halting traffic in both directions. As all oil tankers have to use Powdrake Road to access the Ineos oil terminal at Grangemouth, which supplies the majority of Scotland’s petrol the obstraction has halted all petrol distribution from the Grangemouth oil terminal.\n\nThis renewed obstruction, combined with the past two days of disruption, will likely mean fuel pumps will start to run dry in Scotland.\n\nEven when the system seems unstoppable and any action seems pointless, opportunity remains. The system is fragile and vulnerable.\n\nThe group are from This is Rigged who are demanding that the Scottish government vocally oppose all new oil and gas licences, and create a fair and fully funded transition for oil workers.\n\nIn April this year, following a series of disruptions at First Minister’s Questions (in which the group attempted to bring the question directly to politicians, and instead received 6 month bans from parliament), This is Rigged threw red paint at the front of Scottish parliament and vowed to escalate tactics until their demands are met. They threatened then to shut down Scotland’s oil industry, with the Herald reporting that the actions would cause fuel shortages around Scotland, comparing them to the 2000s fuel protests which caused petrol pumps to run dry.\n\nThis action forms part of a sustained series of actions, in which This is Rigged has vowed to “shut down the Scottish oil industry”. From 4am on the 19th of July, 20 people halted fuel distribution from the Grangemouth terminal by occupying the road, oil pipes and oil tankers. They were removed and arrested by Police Scotland after 12 hours. Also on the 19th of July, 4 people with This is Rigged halted fuel distribution from the Clydebank oil terminal by occupying a fuel silo. The occupation lasted over 40 hours. Two people were removed and arrested by police on the 20th of July. The other two were arrested just after midnight on the 21st of July.\n\nHannah Bright, a community worker and This is Rigged co-founder said:\n\n“These blockades are about hope over fear. I’m here to stand up for my own – for ordinary people in Scotland and all over the world who have been screwed over for far too long by the people in power – and I’m not going anywhere, even if that means I have to cement myself to a road. We won’t be cowed by well polished corporate BS, or police bullying. We’re here to stay. The only way to stop us is to meet our demands.”\n\nWhile licensing new oil and gas is a power reserved to the Westminster government, the Scottish government has yet to even oppose any of the 130 new proposed North Sea licences. A spokesperson from the group claims that this is the “bare minimum they must do to begin to mitigate some of the worst effects of the climate crisis.” Scotland is already suffering the effects of runaway climate collapse: in June, we saw warnings that Scotland will be facing record breaking heatwaves and droughts. Cannich in the Highlands recently suffered one of the worst wildfires in UK history. With one of the largest oil and gas industries in Europe, it is crucial that Scotland makes a rapid transition away from fossil fuels in order to limit the worst of global climate collapse.\n\nThe Scottish Government has full control over the transition fund for Scotland’s oil workers and, at present, the money is being invested in unproven carbon capture technology rather than in supporting oil and gas workers to transition to greener jobs, despite a coalition of 1000 North Sea workers setting out their demands for a fair transition.\n\nScotland has massive potential for green energy: 60% of all of Europe’s potential for wind, and 25% of its potential for tidal, with only 1% of the population. The vast majority of the population are in support of a rapid transition. This Is Rigged are calling on the Scottish government to listen to the voices of its people, and on the Scottish public to join them in civil resistance and direct action to secure a fair and liveable future.\n\nRebecca Solnit has written: “We need a litany, a rosary, a sutra, a mantra, a war chant of our victories. The past is set in daylight, and it can become a torch we can carry into the night that is the future.” This is it."
