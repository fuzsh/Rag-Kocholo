        "text": "Millions of years ago, algae and plants lived in shallow seas. After dying and sinking to the seafloor, the organic material mixed with other sediments and was buried. Over millions of years under high pressure and high temperature, the remains of these organisms transformed into what we know today as fossil fuels.Â Coal,Â natural gas, and petroleum are all fossil fuels that formed under similar conditions.\n\nToday, petroleum is found in vast underground reservoirs where ancient seas were located. Petroleum reservoirs can be found beneath land or the ocean floor. Their crude oil isÂ extracted with giant drilling machines.\n\nCrude oil is usually black or dark brown, but can also be yellowish, reddish, tan, or even greenish. Variations in color indicate the distinct chemical compositions of different supplies of crude oil. Petroleum that has few metals or sulfur, for instance, tends to be lighter (sometimes nearly clear).\n\nPetroleum is used to make gasoline, an important product in our everyday lives. It is also processed and part of thousands of different items, including tires, refrigerators, life jackets, andÂ anesthetics.\n\nWhen petroleum products such as gasoline are burned for energy, they release toxic gases and high amounts of carbon dioxide, aÂ greenhouse gas. Carbon helps regulate Earthâs atmospheric temperature, and adding to the natural balance by burning fossil fuels adversely affects ourÂ climate.\n\nThere are huge quantities of petroleum found under Earthâs surface and inÂ tar pits that bubble to the surface. Petroleum even exists far below the deepest wells that are developed to extract it.\n\nHowever, petroleum, like coal and natural gas, is a nonrenewable source of energy. It took millions of years for it to form, and when it is extracted and consumed, there is no way for us to replace it.\n\nOil supplies will run out. Eventually, the world will reach âpeak oil,â or its highest production level. Some experts predict peak oil could come as soon as 2050. Finding alternatives to petroleum is crucial to global energy use, and is the focus of many industries.\n\nFormation of Petroleum\n\nThe geological conditions that would eventually create petroleum formed millions of years ago, when plants, algae, andÂ planktonÂ drifted in oceans and shallow seas. These organisms sank to the seafloor at the end of their life cycle. Over time, they were buried and crushed under millions of tons of sediment and even more layers of plant debris.\n\nEventually, ancient seas dried up and dry basins remained, calledÂ sedimentary basins. Deep under the basin floor, the organic material was compressed between Earthâs mantle, with very high temperatures, and millions of tons of rock and sediment above. Oxygen was almost completely absent in these conditions, and the organic matter began to transform into a waxy substance calledÂ kerogen.\n\nWith more heat, time, and pressure, the kerogen underwent a process calledÂ catagenesis, and transformed intoÂ hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are simply chemicals made up of hydrogen and carbon. Different combinations of heat and pressure can create different forms of hydrocarbons. Some other examples are coal,Â peat, and natural gas.\n\nSedimentary basins, where ancient seabeds used to lie, are key sources of petroleum. In Africa, the Niger Delta sedimentary basin covers land in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea. More than 500 oil deposits have been discovered in the massive Niger Delta basin, and they comprise one of the most productiveÂ oil fields in Africa.\n\nChemistry and Classification of Crude Oil\n\nThe gasoline we use to fuel our cars, the synthetic fabrics of our backpacks and shoes, and the thousands of different useful products made from petroleum come in forms that are consistent and reliable. However, the crude oil from which these items are produced is neither consistent nor uniform.\n\nChemistry\n\nCrude oil is composed of hydrocarbons, which are mainly hydrogen (about 13 percent by weight) and carbon (about 85 percent). Other elements such as nitrogen (about 0.5 percent), sulfur (0.5 percent), oxygen (1 percent), and metals such as iron, nickel, and copper (less than 0.1 percent) can also be mixed in with the hydrocarbons in small amounts.\n\nThe way molecules are organized in the hydrocarbon is a result of the original composition of the algae, plants, or plankton from millions of years ago. The amount of heat and pressure the plants were exposed to also contributes to variations that are found in hydrocarbons and crude oil.\n\nDue to this variation, crude oil that is pumped from the ground can consist of hundreds of different petroleum compounds. Light oils can contain up to 97 percent hydrocarbons, while heavier oils andÂ bitumens might contain only 50 percent hydrocarbons and larger quantities of other elements. It is almost always necessary toÂ refineÂ crude oil in order to make useful products.\n\nClassification\n\nOil is classified according to three main categories: the geographic location where it was drilled, its sulfur content, and its API gravity (a measure of density).\n\nClassification: Geography\n\nOil is drilled all over the world. However, there are three primary sources of crude oil that set reference points for ranking and pricing other oil supplies: Brent Crude, West Texas Intermediate, and Dubai and Oman.\n\nBrent Crude is a mixture that comes from 15 different oil fields between Scotland and Norway in the North Sea. These fields supply oil to most of Europe.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) is a lighter oil that is produced mostly in the U.S. state of Texas. It is âsweetâ and âlightââconsidered very high quality. WTI supplies much of North America with oil.\n\nDubai crude, also known as Fateh or Dubai-Oman crude, is a light, sour oil that is produced in Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates. The nearby country of Oman has recently begun producing oil. Dubai and Oman crudes are used as a reference point for pricing Persian Gulf oils that are mostly exported to Asia.\n\nThe OPEC Reference Basket is another important oil source.Â OPECÂ is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The OPEC Reference Basket is the average price of petroleum from OPECâs 12 member countries: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.\n\nClassification: Sulfur Content\n\nSulfur is considered an âimpurityâ in petroleum. Sulfur in crude oil canÂ corrodeÂ metal in the refining process and contribute toÂ air pollution. Petroleum with more than 0.5 percent sulfur is called âsour,â while petroleum with less than 0.5 percent sulfur is âsweet.â\n\nSweet oil is usually much more valuable than sour because it does not require as much refining and is less harmful to the environment.\n\nClassification: API Gravity\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) is a trade association for businesses in the oil and natural gas industries. The API has established accepted systems of standards for a variety of oil- and gas-related products, such as gauges, pumps, and drilling machinery. The API has also established several units of measurement. The âAPI unit,â for instance, measures gamma radiation in a borehole (a shaft drilled into the ground).\n\nAPI gravityÂ is a measure of the density of petroleum liquid compared to water. If a petroleum liquidâs API gravity is greater than 10, it is âlight,â and floats on top of water. If the API gravity is less than 10, it is âheavy,â and sinks in water.\n\nLight oils are preferred because they have a higher yield of hydrocarbons. Heavier oils have greater concentrations of metals and sulfur, and require more refining.\n\nPetroleum Reservoirs\n\nPetroleum is found in underground pockets called reservoirs. Deep beneath the Earth, pressure is extremely high. Petroleum slowly seeps out toward the surface, where there is lower pressure. It continues this movement from high to low pressure until it encounters a layer of rock that isÂ impermeable. The petroleum then collects in reservoirs, which can be several hundred meters below the surface of Earth.\n\nPetroleum can be contained byÂ structural traps, which are formed when massive layers of rock are bent or faulted (broken) from Earthâs shifting landmasses. Oil can also be contained byÂ stratigraphic traps. Different strata, or layers of rock, can have different amounts of porosity. Crude oil migrates easily through a layer of sandstone, for instance, but would be trapped beneath a layer of shale.\n\nGeologists, chemists, andÂ engineers look for geological structures that typically trap petroleum. They use a process called âseismic reflectionâ to locate underground rock structures that might have trapped crude oil. During the process, a small explosion is set off. Sound waves travel underground, bounce off of the different types of rock, and return to the surface. Sensors on the ground interpret the returning sound waves to determine the underground geological layout and possibility of a petroleum reservoir.\n\nThe amount of petroleum in a reservoir is measured in barrels or tons. AnÂ oil barrelÂ is about 42 gallons. This measurement is usually used by oil producers in the United States. Oil producers in Europe and Asia tend to measure in metric tons. There are about six to eight barrels of oil in a metric ton. The conversion is imprecise because different varieties of oil weigh different amounts, depending on the amount of impurities.\n\nCrude oil is frequently found in reservoirs along with natural gas. In the past, natural gas was either burned or allowed to escape into the atmosphere. Now, technology has been developed to capture the natural gas and either reinject it into the well or compress it into liquid natural gas (LNG). LNG is easily transportable and has versatile uses.\n\nExtracting Petroleum\n\nIn some places, petroleum bubbles to the surface of Earth. In parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, for instance, porous rock allows oil to seep to the surface in small ponds. However, most oil is trapped in underground oil reservoirs.\n\nThe total amount of petroleum in a reservoir is calledÂ oil-in-place. Many petroleum liquids that make up a reservoirâs oil-in-place are unable to be extracted. These petroleum liquids may be too difficult, dangerous, or expensive to drill.\n\nThe part of a reservoirâs oil-in-place that can be extracted and refined is that reservoirâs oil reserves. The decision to invest in complex drilling operations is often made based on a siteâs proven oil reserves.\n\nDrilling can either be developmental, exploratory, or directional.\n\nDrilling in an area where oil reserves have already been found is calledÂ developmental drilling. Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, United States, has the largest oil reserves in the United States. Developmental drilling in Prudhoe Bay includes new wells and expanding extraction technology.\n\nDrilling where there are no known reserves is calledÂ exploratory drilling. Exploratory, also called âwildcatâ drilling, is a risky business with a very high failure rate. However, the potential rewards of striking oil tempt many âwildcattersâ to attempt exploratory drilling. âDiamondâ Glenn McCarthy, for example, is known as the âKing of the Wildcattersâ because of his success in discovering the massive oil reserves near Houston, Texas, United States. McCarthy struck oil 38 times in the 1930s, earning millions of dollars.\n\nDirectional drillingÂ involves drilling vertically to a known source of oil, then veering the drill bit at an angle to access additional resources. Accusations of directional drilling led to the first Gulf War in 1991. Iraq accused Kuwait of using directional drilling techniques to extract oil from Iraqi oil reservoirs near the Kuwaiti border. Iraq subsequently invaded Kuwait, an act which drew international attention and intervention. After the war, the border between Iraq and Kuwait was redrawn, with the reservoirs now belonging to Kuwait.\n\nOil Rigs\n\nOn land, oil can be drilled with an apparatus called anÂ oil rigÂ or drilling rig. Offshore, oil is drilled from anÂ oil platform.\n\nPrimary Production\n\nMost modern wells use an air rotary drilling rig, which can operate 24 hours a day. In this process, engines power a drill bit. AÂ drill bitÂ is a cutting tool used to create a circular hole. The drill bits used in air rotary drilling rigs are hollow steel, with tungsten rods used to cut the rock. Petroleum drill bits can be 36 centimeters (14 inches) in diameter.\n\nAs the drill bit rotates and cuts through the earth, small pieces of rock are chipped off. A powerful flow of air is pumped down the center of the hollow drill, and comes out through the bottom of the drill bit. The air then rushes back toward the surface, carrying with it tiny chunks of rock. Geologists on site can study these pieces of pulverized rock to determine the different rock strata the drill encounters.\n\nWhen the drill hits oil, some of the oil naturally rises from the ground, moving from an area of high pressure to low pressure. This immediate release of oil can be a âgusher,â shooting dozens of meters into the air, one of the most dramatic extraction activities. It is also one of the most dangerous, and a piece of equipment called a blowout preventer redistributes pressure to stop such a gusher.\n\nPumps are used to extract oil. Most oil rigs have two sets of pumps:Â mud pumps and extraction pumps. âMudâ is the drilling fluid used to create boreholes for extracting oil and natural gas. Mud pumps circulate drilling fluid.\n\nThe petroleum industry uses a wide variety of extraction pumps. Which pump to use depends on the geography, quality, and position of the oil reservoir. Submersible pumps, for example, are submerged directly into the fluid. A gas pump, also called a bubble pump, uses compressed air to force the petroleum to the surface or well.\n\nOne of the most familiar types of extraction pumps is theÂ pumpjack, the upper part of a piston pump. Pumpjacks are nicknamed âthirsty birdsâ or ânodding donkeysâ for their controlled, regular dipping motion. A crank moves the large, hammer-shaped pumpjack up and down. Far below the surface, the motion of the pumpjack moves a hollow piston up and down, constantly carrying petroleum back to the surface or well.\n\nSuccessful drilling sites can produce oil for about 30 years, although some produce for many more decades.\n\nSecondary Recovery\n\nEven after pumping, the vast majority (up to 90 percent) of the oil can remain tightly trapped in the underground reservoir. Other methods are necessary to extract this petroleum, a process calledÂ secondary recovery. Vacuuming the extra oil out was a method used in the 1800s and early 20th century, but it captured only thinner oil components, and left behind great stores of heavy oil.\n\nWater flooding was discovered by accident. In the 1870s, oil producers in Pennsylvania noticed that abandoned oil wells were accumulating rainwater and groundwater. The weight of the water in the boreholes forced oil out of the reservoirs and into nearby wells, increasing their production. Oil producers soon began intentionally flooding wells as a way to extract more oil.\n\nThe most prevalent secondary recovery method today isÂ gas drive. During this process, a well is intentionally drilled deeper than the oil reservoir. The deeper well hits a natural gas reservoir, and the high-pressure gas rises, forcing the oil out of its reservoir.\n\nOil Platforms\n\nDrilling offshore is much more expensive than drilling onshore. It usually uses the same drilling techniques as onshore, but requires a massive structure that can sustain the tremendous strength of ocean waves in stormy seas.\n\nOffshore drilling platforms are some of the largest manmade structures in the world. They often include housing accommodations for people who work on the platform, as well as docking facilities and a helicopter landing pad to transport workers.\n\nThe platform can either beÂ tethered to the ocean floor and float, or can be a rigid structure that is fixed to the bottom of the ocean, sea, or lake with concrete or steel legs.\n\nThe Hibernia platform, 315 kilometers (196 miles) off Canadaâs eastern shore in the North Atlantic, is one of the worldâs largest oil platforms. More than 70 people work on the platform, in three-week shifts. The platform is 111 meters (364 feet) tall and is anchored to the ocean floor. About 450,000 tons of solidÂ ballastÂ were added to give it additional stability. The platform can store up to 1.3 million barrels of oil. In total, Hibernia weighs 1.2 million tons! However, the platform is still vulnerable to the crushing weight and strength ofÂ icebergs. Its edges are serrated and sharp to withstand the impact of sea ice or icebergs.\n\nOil platforms can cause enormous environmental disasters. Problems with the drilling equipment can cause the oil to explode out of the well and into the ocean. Repairing the well hundreds of meters below the ocean is extremely difficult, expensive, and slow. Millions of barrels of oil can spill into the ocean before the well is plugged.\n\nWhen oil spills in the ocean, it floats on the water andÂ wreaks havoc on the animal population. One of its most devastating effects is on birds. Oil destroys the waterproofing abilities of feathers, and birds are notÂ insulated against the cold ocean water. Thousands can die ofÂ hypothermia. Fish and marine mammals, too, are threatened by oil spills. The dark shadows cast by oil spills can look like food. Oil can damage animalsâ internal organs and be even more toxic to animals higher up in the food chain, a process calledÂ bioaccumulation.\n\nA massive oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, theÂ Deepwater Horizon, exploded in 2010. This was the largest accidental marine oil spill in history. Eleven platform workers died, and more than four million barrels of oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico. More than 40,000 barrels flowed into the ocean every day. Eight national parks were threatened, the economies of communities along the Gulf Coast were threatened as the tourism and fishing industries declined, and more than 6,000 animals died.\n\nRigs to Reefs\n\nOffshore oil platforms can also act as artificial reefs. They provide a surface (substrate) for algae, coral, oysters, and barnacles. This artificial reef can attract fish and marine mammals, and create a thriving ecosystem.\n\nUntil the 1980s, oil platforms were deconstructed and removed from the oceans, and the metal was sold as scrap. In 1986, the National Marine Fisheries Association developed the Rigs-to-Reefs Program. Now, oil platforms are either toppled (by underwater explosion), removed and towed to a new location, or partially deconstructed. This allows the marine life to continue flourishing on the artificial reef that had provided habitats for decades.\n\nThe environmental impact of the Rigs-to-Reefs Program is still being studied. Oil platforms left underwater can pose dangers to ships and divers. Fishing boats have had their nets caught in the platforms, and there are concerns about safety regulations of the abandoned structures.\n\nEnvironmentalists argue that oil companies should be held accountable to the commitment they originally agreed upon, which was to restore the seabed to its original condition. By leaving the platforms in the ocean, oil companies are excused from fulfilling this agreement, and there is concern this could set a precedent for other companies that want to dispose of their metal or machinery in the oceans.\n\nPetroleum and the Environment: Bitumen and the Boreal Forest\n\nCrude oil does not always have to be extracted through deep drilling. If it does not encounter rocky obstacles underground, it can seep all the way to the surface and bubble above ground. Bitumen is a form of petroleum that is black, extremely sticky, and sometimes rises to Earthâs surface.\n\nIn its natural state, bitumen is typically mixed with âoil sandsâ or âtar sands,â which makes it extremely difficult to extract and an unconventional source of oil. Only about 20 percent of the worldâs reserves of bitumen are above ground and can be surface mined.\n\nUnfortunately, because bitumen contains high amounts of sulfur and heavy metals, extracting and refining it is both costly and harmful to the environment. Producing bitumen into useful products releases 12 percent more carbon emissions than processing conventional oil.\n\nBitumen is about the consistency of cold molasses, and powerful hot steam has to be pumped into the well in order to melt the bitumen to extract it. Large quantities of water are then used to separate the bitumen from sand and clay. This process depletes nearby water supplies. Releasing the treated water back into the environment can further contaminate the remaining water supply.\n\nProcessing bitumen from tar sands is also a complex, expensive procedure. It takes two tons of oil sands to produce one barrel of oil.\n\nHowever, we depend on bitumen for its unique properties: about 85 percent of the bitumen extracted is used to make asphalt to pave and patch our roads. A small percentage is used for roofing and other products.\n\nBitumen Reserves\n\nMost of the worldâs tar sands are in the eastern part of Alberta, Canada, in the Athabasca Oil Sands. Other major reserves are in the North Caspian Basin of Kazahkstan and Siberia, Russia.\n\nThe Athabasca Oil Sands are the fourth-largest reserves of oil in the world. Unfortunately, the bitumen reserves are located beneath part of the boreal forest, also called theÂ taiga. This makes extraction both difficult and environmentally dangerous.\n\nThe taiga circles the Northern Hemisphere just below the frozen tundra, spanning more than 5 million square kilometers (two million square miles), mostly in Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia. It accounts for almost one-third of all of the forested land on the planet.\n\nThe taiga is sometimes called the âlungs of the planetâ because it filters tons of water and oxygen through the leaves and needles of its trees every day. Every spring, the boreal forest releases immense amounts of oxygen into the atmosphere and keeps our air clean. It is home to a mosaic of plant and animal life, all of which depend on the mature trees, mosses, and lichen of the boreal biome.\n\nSurface mines are estimated to only take up 0.2 percent of Canadaâs boreal forest. About 80 percent of Canadaâs oil sands can be accessed through drilling, and 20 percent by surface mining.\n\nRefining Petroleum\n\nRefining petroleum is the process of converting crude oil or bitumen into more useful products, such as fuel orÂ asphalt."
