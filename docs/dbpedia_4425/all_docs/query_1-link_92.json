However, you won’t believe the amount of calls we get from people requesting an emergency call out.\n\nWe want to help you avoid these panic moments, not just because you have got enough on your plate; but it is also better for your heating system and stove appliances that you don’t let the tank run dry.\n\nThe Watchman Alarm is designed to measure your oil continuously and sound an alarm when there is a sudden drop in the tank level.\n\nThis helps prevent and alert you to oil theft. It also gives the option of an audible setting which will transmit a buzzing tone when your oil levels are running low, helping you monitor your fuel too.\n\nThis technology gives you the peace of mind that your oil tank is always protected.\n\nThe Watchman Sonic acts as a level sensor for your fuel tank, indicating to you how much oil you have left.\n\nIt remotely monitors the level and sends this information to a receiver which can be plugged in a socket inside your home or office. When your oil reaches below ten percent a symbol will appear on the receiver, notifying you that you need to fill up your tank. It also gives the option of an audible setting which will transmit a buzzing tone when your oil levels are running low, helping you monitor your fuel too.\n\nThis technology ensures you’ll never be caught short again."
