        "text": "About us\n\nAt Home Energy Scotland we're here to offer free advice and support to help you make your home warmer, reduce energy bills, and contribute to a greener, more sustainable future. Our service is funded by the Scottish Government and managed by Energy Saving Trust. We are committed to positively impacting the lives of people throughout Scotland.\n\nOur primary focus is tackling fuel poverty and the climate emergency, by helping people stay warmer at home for less and reducing their carbon footprint; all critical priorities for the Scottish Government.\n\nActive travel\n\nActive travel (walking, wheeling and cycling) is a great way to get from A to B without fossil fuels. Whilst some journeys and situations may require a car, the more journeys you replace with active travel, the more money and carbon you will save. Active travel isn't just good for your wallet and the environment, it also improves health and wellbeing.\n\nGreen travel\n\nClimate change and the cost of living are immediate and urgent problems.\n\nTransport plays a critical role in the solution. Discover how to embrace sustainable travel to suit your needs and budget while saving money and helping the planet."
