        "text": "Just Stop Oil eco protesters are still at a Scottish fuel depot nearly 40 hours after storming the site.\n\nThe mostly Gen Z activists climbed among the pipes and atop tankers at the Nustar Clydebank terminal, near Glasgow yesterday, resulting in dozens of police officers being called.\n\nHowever, the demonstrators still remain at the scene, as they push on with their 'disruptive action' across the country until the UK government releases a 'meaningful' statement agreeing to their demands.\n\nThe group says eight people are sitting on the pipes inside a terminal building and another three are on top of one of the silos.\n\nSo far there have been two removals of those inside the facility, and all of those arrested yesterday were released this morning with £40 fines, campaigners said.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly a dozen of their fellow activists have skipped a court appearance to protest outside Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire.\n\nOf the 11 who appeared this morning holding placards, eight had been summoned for a full committal hearing at Birmingham County Court for previously breaking the injunction, and three have a bail hearing at the court.\n\nAll chose instead, to not attend court and to travel to Kingsbury, breaking the private injunction again.\n\nJust Stop Oil says arrest warrants have been issued for all 11 and the court case has been adjourned until May 10.\n\nAction across the country has led to some petrol shortages and almost 200 arrests at Kingsbury alone.\n\nOne of the activists, Margaret Reid, 51, from Cumbria said: 'The climate emergency is growing more and more serious, but the measures taken against climate activists are becoming more and more draconian.\n\n'We're just trying to safeguard the future of our planet. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel industry, the government and the legal system are combining all their powerful forces to shut down a small group of ordinary people protesting peacefully on a grass verge. Is that really justice?'\n\nGwen Harrison, 44, from Kendal, added: 'The scientists have told us in no uncertain terms that there can be no new fossil fuel projects if we want a liveable future.\n\n'And yet, our Government is planning 40 new North Sea oil and gas fields and is subsidising the fossil fuel industry to the tune of £236m/wk.\n\n'No sane, rational or moral person can think that's OK and neither should the courts or legal system.'\n\nElsewhere, Barclays and Standard Chartered today had their annual shareholder meetings disrupted by protesters calling for the banking giants to stop investing in fossil fuels.\n\nBarclays' annual general meeting (AGM) in Manchester got off to a chaotic start with a series of disruptions from climate change activists in the audience.\n\nChairman Nigel Higgins was forced to pause the meeting while security officials removed the protesters after he was repeatedly interrupted, with the activists dominating the first hour of the event and setting off alarms.\n\nA number of protesters glued themselves to their seats in the Manchester Central Convention Complex to avoid being removed.\n\nProtesters criticised the bank over its investment strategy, claiming it is continuing to invest heavily in fossil fuels and accusing it of 'greenwashing'.\n\nExtinction Rebellion and sister movement Money Rebellion said they had disrupted the Barclays AGM and that of fellow bank Standard Chartered to demand they stop financing fossil fuels.\n\nA total of around 60 people interrupted speeches at both meetings, they said.\n\nOne activist at the Barclays AGM said the bank is 'morally bankrupt'. He said: 'Barclays has ploughed 160 billion US dollars (£128 billion) into fossil fuel extraction.'\n\nAnother added: 'You did say you were going to do it last year and you failed. Please, I'm begging you, after this meeting, change your policy.'\n\nMr Higgins - appearing flustered amid the disruption - had asked protesters to wait until the question and answer session at the end of the meeting, but was forced to ask security to step in.\n\nThe environmental campaigners claim Barclays is the UK's largest investor in fossil fuels, having put 19.6 billion US dollars (£15.7 billion) into the industry in 2021, and that Standard Chartered has put in 6 billion dollars (£4.8 billion).\n\nAidan Knox, 22, a student and member of Money Rebellion, who took part in the action at the Standard Chartered AGM, said: 'We are disrupting the AGMs because we are in a climate crisis, but Barclays and Standard Chartered are more interested in their profits than a habitable planet.'\n\nHe pointed to warnings from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of a 'code red for humanity' and the International Energy Agency's (IEA) calls for no more investments in fossil fuel expansion if the world is to meet global targets to curb dangerous temperature rises.\n\nHe warned that both banks put billions into companies expanding oil and gas in 2021, and said: 'We are scared for the future and we have no other option but to pressure these UK banks to change.'\n\nMia Watanabe, a member of campaign group Market Forces, who was at the Barclays AGM, said: 'Barclays' refusal to listen to climate protesters and instead to drown them out with loud videos is a perfect metaphor for the bank's attitude towards climate change.'\n\nShe added: 'Barclays can either align themselves with the science or continue to be the biggest fossil fuel funders in Europe. It can't do both.'\n\nIn response to a barrage of climate change questions from shareholders at the event, Mr Higgins said Barclays will not pledge to immediately stop investing in oil and gas firms, but insisted net-zero aims are a priority for the group.\n\nBarclays has tabled a new advisory resolution on climate for shareholders to vote on at the event, after a proposal for the bank to reduce fossil fuel finance was rejected last year despite heavy campaigning from activists and investors.\n\nMr Higgins told investors at Wednesday's AGM: 'We get the point. We share the ambition and are aligning the IEA scenarios with the targets that we are setting, but there's a hell of a lot else that needs to be done to make that scenario come to fruition.'"
