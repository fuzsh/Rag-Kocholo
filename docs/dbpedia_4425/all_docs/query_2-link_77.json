        "text": "Destination Wedding Photographer\n\nTelling your unique love story through documentary wedding photography in Scotland, Europe and destinations worldwide.\n\nRomantic wedding photography in castles, chateaux, estates and villas around the world … from Morocco to Bali and beyond.\n\nINTIMATE SCOTLAND WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER COVERING DESTINATIONS WORLDWIDE\n\nHi, I’m Bernadeta, a wedding photographer with a romantic and natural style.\n\nI love to capture the little moments — the squeeze of a finger, the wink of an eye, the afternoon light on a laughing couple — that weave together to tell the story of your unique connection.\n\nThat’s where the joy and challenge of my work lies (and that I relish) in capturing that special something in the spark you share with your partner. I strive to do this in the most natural way possible, using the available light and compelling compositions to frame you in the most graceful manner.\n\nIt’s this aspect of fine art wedding photography that I adore and absorbs my creative energy.\n\nROMANCE. ELEGANT. BEAUTY.\n\nNAMED ONE OF RANGEFINDER’S 30 RISING STARS\n\nOF WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY 2021\n\nI specialise in destination weddings and adventure elopements in authentic and historic places around the world. My artistic wedding photos seamlessly bring out the best in these enchanting settings, and lay the platform for my enamoured couples to look and feel their absolute best.\n\nI’m an adventurer at heart, and extremely curious about the world around me and within. It’s that curiosity that led me to photography and fuels my projects, but also what drives my passion for trying new things — exploring new places and meeting new people. I have an innate longing to have one last look around the bend.\n\nThat’s why I love what I do as it gives me the opportunity to explore and I’m thrilled to now be able to focus on weddings in beautiful destinations around the world such as Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Mallorca, Croatia, Ireland, Greece, Morocco, Bali, and Thailand … and my stirringly beautiful home of Scotland, of course.\n\nJust as every couple has their own unique connection, every castle and villa has its own story and I love to merge the two to chronicle the special moment when the two meet for one glorious day.\n\n“She’s like Caravaggio with the light and composition of her photographs.”\n\nEmily & David\n\nARTISTIC. HONEST. ATMOSPHERIC.\n\n“Her style is beautiful, but also flexible, and knowing. Throughout the process, she made us feel comfortable (which neither of us usually is in front of a camera) and took so much time to get to know us and our relationship and represent it authentically in her photos. Her genuine enthusiasm and joy at being part of our day were warming and delightful. At the same time, her presence on the day was a light touch, silent as a mouse from place to place to capture every moment, which she did. Every. Moment. Simply put, she is a class above any wedding photographer I’ve ever seen. We’re so, so glad she could be there for us..”\n\nAnna & Robert\n\nLATEST STORIES\n\n“I must have spent thousands of hours pouring over Instagram at different intimate Scotland wedding photographers, but her photos always grabbed me with their emotion and storytelling. When she took our photos it was more than just incredible art we got out of the experience, we got a support system and a friend.”\n\nLaura & Cole\n\nENQUIRE NOW\n\n“Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever… It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything.”\n\n— Aaron Siskind\n\nGUIDES\n\nInsider tips and advice on the best locations, venues, and vendors for weddings and elopements in Scotland & destinations worldwide.\n\nWEDDINGS\n\nA collection of intimate, fine art wedding photography from Scotland and around the world.\n\nELOPEMENTS\n\nAs an adventure elopement photographer, I’ve captured a range of intimate elopements for wonderful couples."
