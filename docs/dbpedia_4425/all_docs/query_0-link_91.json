        "text": "The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch\n\nSir Henry Raeburn, circa 1795\n\nI love the slightly preening air of this 18th-century minister: he’s kind of a puffed-up guy, very dapper, and there he is skating in an incredibly gymnastic pose on Duddingston Loch. The late first minister for Scotland, Donald Dewar, had it as his Christmas card, which I thought was apt, as he was always one to prick pomposity. Recently it’s been disputed whether the painting was a Raeburn, but I don’t think it matters. It embodies a lot of old Scotland for me – wit and humour. There’s a sense of fun and satire, and I like the outfit: sombre black, but with a rather jaunty hat.\n\nLa Cocarde\n\nJD Fergusson, 1910\n\nIsn’t she beautiful? I learned about the Scottish colourists – though the term was not coined until long after the work was made – from my parents as I was growing up. The group, which included Samuel Peploe, Francis Cadell and Leslie Hunter, talked passionately about modern art, and although they all spent time living and painting in France they exhibited in Scotland and sold their work here too. Fergusson’s elegant Edwardian woman has a wonderfully direct gaze, and I think that reflects a Scottish sensibility.\n\nYellow Tide – Achill\n\nBarbara Rae, 2010\n\nBarbara Rae captures the wildness and vividness of Scotland in her canvases and carpets. Her abstract landscapes are stunning, and in her use of colour she’s a virtuoso. She was commissioned to do a round carpet for the tower of the Royal Scottish Museum [now part of the National Museum of Scotland], and it was just a beautiful work of art. To me her work – and its often fabulously clashing colours – suggests great joy. When she was younger she was a grouse-beater in the Highlands, where she started drawing landscapes. She is in the tradition of the colourists: they elevated colour in a way that is not always obvious in the Scottish landscape, turning its muted hues into something vibrant.\n\nForth rail bridge\n\nDesigned by Sir John Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker, opened 1890\n\nThe Forth rail bridge is more than a bridge: to me it’s an art installation, a strong ochre-red iron sculpture across the Firth of Forth. It reflects Scotland’s feats of engineering so magnificently. It’s painted the most wonderful burnt red-brown, and when you see it from a distance it has these great big diamond shapes. I love its structure and the perspective you have on it from different angles: from underneath, from the sides. I saw it first when I was five years old. When I’m on the train between Glasgow and Edinburgh I search for it in the distance.\n\nThree Children at a Tenement Window\n\nJoan Eardley, 1961\n\nEardley painted tender, vivid canvases of poor children in Glasgow’s tenements, which were near her studio. She brought an incredible empathy to her subjects, but she also painted it like it was. She died young at the age of 42, of breast cancer, in 1963. She was quite a solitary woman who often worked in extreme weather. For a while after her death, her paintings sold very cheaply. I always wish I’d bought one of them then, but Scotland woke up to her talent.\n\nChrist of St John of the Cross\n\nSalvador Dalí, 1951\n\nMany late 18th- and 19th-century industrialists in Glasgow and the west of Scotland showed off their wealth by building grand houses and collecting art. After the great exhibitions in 1888 and 1901, the city’s interest in art carried on growing. Salvador Dalí painted this in 1951 and it was bought incredibly quickly by the city of Glasgow: the purchase was a bold move, which speaks volumes about our international artistic ambition. My grandmother took me to see it when I was seven and I found it absolutely terrifying. It’s a very powerful image, especially for a child who was still going to Sunday school at that time.\n\nLittle Sparta\n\nIan Hamilton Finlay, 1966\n\nFinlay was a thought-provoking artist addressing the power of language with his concrete poetry. He was a terrific fuel for Scotland, different from anything else. He had a huge international reputation, but was firmly rooted in Scotland, and that’s what I love. Little Sparta is a six-acre garden near Edinburgh which he created with his wife, Sue Finlay, with artwork embedded in the garden, on columns, in the walls, in standing stones, all with finely carved inscriptions, poetry and wordplay. The garden itself is a work of art and his classical language is very moving.\n\nGalloway Farmhouse\n\nDorothy Johnstone, 1919\n\nJohnstone is a fine artist who is not well known. She was part of the Kirkcudbright school: from the 1840s to 1949 it was an artists’ town that attracted painters such as Jessie M King and EA Taylor. A lot of her work was kept in the family and doesn’t often come up for sale, but I have this watercolour of hers of a farmhouse, which I cherish. I was the producer of the general election coverage for BBC Scotland in 1983, and I spent the £250 bonus I received on this picture. It’s a painting that I have in my bedroom, and look at every day. I love the red hayloft door in the whitewashed wall. I used it as the model for the farmhouse in my novel.\n\nPhantom\n\nAlison Watt, 2008\n\nAlison Watt is a sublime painter. Beginning as a portrait artist, she became entranced by Ingres. She went on to create these incredible paintings of sensuous folds of fabric, or is it alabaster? The effect is light and weighty at the same time. She paints slowly and adores the solitude of her work. I visited her in her new Edinburgh studio, which is dominated by three tall Georgian windows. She’s a painter of such stature and yet such quietude, and her work is incredibly contemplative. She did a two‑year residency at the National Gallery in London, but she’s come home to Scotland and I celebrate that. I think her life in Edinburgh will inspire her.\n\nThere Will Be No Miracles Here\n\nNathan Coley, 2006\n\nI think of Coley as Finlay’s inheritor. He is one of a number of Scottish artists who studied environmental art at Glasgow School of Art, and often takes it into the open air. Scotland is a country where art is all around us. There Will Be No Miracles Here sits boldly in front of the National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. It says something about the nation, that we’re not interested in miracles, and it’s a kind of motto for modern art in Scotland. It’s such a great line."
