        "text": "At 4am on Wednesday morning, 24 people with This is Rigged halted operations at two oil terminals which supply the majority of Scotland’s petrol – the terminal at Grangemouth and an oil terminal in Clydebank.\n\nREAD MORE: Climate activists vow to hold Ineos to account at protest camp\n\nThe group is demanding that the Scottish Government vocally oppose all new oil and gas licences.\n\nWhat happened at the protest?\n\nAt 5am on Wednesday morning, 24 people “cut off all of Scotland’s petrol supply”, according to This is Rigged.\n\nThe terminal in Grangemouth provides around 70% of the country’s fuel supply. Four people climbed into the pipework of the tanker loading bay.\n\nThe group added that eleven people have blockaded the access road to the site, preventing tanks from entering or exiting, while a further five disabled tankers in the site’s storage carpark.\n\nA further four people occupied a fuel silo at an oil terminal in Clydebank.\n\nWhy have the group taken action?\n\nEmma Brown, 32, is a community worker based in Glasgow and is among those taking action at the site.\n\nShe said: “We’re not asking passively anymore – this is too important. We are demanding the Scottish Government stand up for what’s right and oppose all new oil and gas projects and use the devolved powers they have to retrain our workers.\n\n“We want decent jobs on a liveable planet.”\n\nFrances Moore, 61 from South Queensferry, was also at the protest and said: “I am furious that the powers that be are willing to sacrifice our Earth in exchange for their greed and monetary gain.”\n\nA spokesperson for Ineos said: “We are aware of a number of protesters at the Petroineos Road Terminal in Grangemouth.\n\n“We have mobilised our incident management team and we are liaising with Police Scotland.\n\n“The protester action is confined to a small area of the site and our manufacturing operations remain unaffected.\n\n“We urge the protesters to consider the safety of themselves, our colleagues and the wider community.\n\n“Our primary concern is always safety. We are taking steps to ensure the safety of all involved and have temporarily closed the terminal to traffic.”\n\nPolice have arrived at the scene and a cordon has been set up.\n\nA spokesperson for Police Scotland said: \"We are aware of a number of protesters at Ineos in Bo'Ness Road, Grangemouth and the Oil Depot at Rothesay Dock, Clydebank.\n\n\"Officers are in attendance.\"\n\nA Scottish Government Spokesperson said: “The Scottish Government is aware of ongoing incidents at the Grangemouth and NuStar sites. We are in close contact with Police Scotland as they seek to resolve the issue."
