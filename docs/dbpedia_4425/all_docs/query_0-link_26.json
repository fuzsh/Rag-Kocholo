        "text": "I’ve always been fond of losing myself in nature, and it’s become important to me to take time each year to let my mind slow down, and to let the pace of my own two feet set the rhythm of my life for a while.\n\nThis year, we decided to embark on the Cape Wrath Trail across the highlands of Scotland, navigating our way northward for 400 km, ending at what seems like the edge of the world - the lighthouse on Cape Wrath. Starting from Fort William, we caught the ferry across the water and began the first of what would be 19 days of walking. This walk felt extra special for a couple of reasons… first, because I had attempted the same trek solo last year, but I had to stop on day 6 because of the absolutely wild and dangerous weather, which left me a sopping wet mess with a broken tent and completely humbled with awe at nature’s power. This year, the forecast looked more promising, and what was even more special was that my love, Kris, was there to share the journey with me – the first time I’ve ever had anyone join me on such a long-distance trek!\n\nIt quickly became apparent that we had, as usual, over-packed our bags with grand ambitions and at least 20 kg of weight each – half of which consisted of camera gear, endless batteries, a drone, and photo props including a medieval dress and a sword, because… you know… it’s Scotland, and we like to be ready when any creative photography ideas come along (which, they did!).\n\nSo with sore legs and aching backs, we walked north: navigating our way through the wild highlands, over rivers, climbing up mountains and descending back down, every day, over and over again, always new rivers and new mountains and new views. And despite the aching muscles and fatigue as our bodies adjusted, it was pure bliss. I never once took the endless sun for granted – it was the complete opposite of the first 6 days I spent on the same portion of the trail last year… an entirely new and welcome experience.\n\nOn day 7 (about 116 km into the trail), we woke up feeling refreshed after spending the night in a small town campground, where we had our first showers and then devoured our weight in food at the local pub before picking up more re-supply food and stove fuel, and readying ourselves for the next portion of the trail. From here, we were continuing north, and into fully unknown territory to me… and as the air cooled and the moody atmosphere returned to the skies, our legs felt adjusted and stronger than ever, and our hearts ready to embrace what lay ahead in the never ending and ever changing horizon.\n\nBy two weeks and over 250 km in, we found ourselves settling deeper into our rhythm... a routine that became way of being. A way of ease, and peace. Even despite the challenges, which we learned were easiest to deal with as they came, to not overthink anything. There was a certain beauty in this simplicity, in simply trusting each moment.\n\nLife was simple. Life was waking up. Life was feeling the cold air greet our skin. Life was walking. It was breathing. It was eating. It was finding a new place to rest each night, and then life was resting and waking and walking again.\n\nWe were the walk. We were the mountains. We were the wind, the rain and the snow. The walk and the wilderness were one with us, us with the world. And in the shadows of the mountains I could feel my inner worries being swept away… weightless in the grand scheme of things.\n\nIn the end, it took us 19 days to reach the end of the land at Cape Wrath lighthouse – and just over 400km of trekking, including the times we got slightly lost. It was a surreal feeling to drop our bags at the Lighthouse cafe – bittersweet, a feeling of triumph, relief, and also loss, knowing we wouldn’t be walking again tomorrow. We were going home.\n\nBut maybe that’s the beauty of these walks... To learn how to not take nature for granted, to allow enough time to let the stillness make its home in us, and then to bring that feeling with us back into the world.\n\nAt least, for as long as we can… before we choose our next walk, our next nature immersion experience… Letting it become a regular practice of reconnecting with the earth, and ourselves.\n\nAs for the Cape Wrath Trail… would I do this walk again? Absolutely, I would."
