        "text": "To date, 27 DAC plants have been commissioned in Europe, North America, Japan and the Middle East. Most of these plants are small scale, with only a few commercial agreements in place to sell or store the captured CO2, while the remaining plants are operated for testing and demonstration purposes. Only three plants are capturing 1 000 tonnes of CO2 per year or over: Climeworks Orca plant in Iceland, the Global thermostat headquarters plant in Colorado, and Heirloom’s first large-scale facility in California.\n\nThree DAC projects are currently under construction, with the largest two expected to come online in 2024 in Iceland (36 kt CO2/year) and in 2025 in the United States (500 kt CO2/year, with potential to scale up to as much as 1 000 kt CO2/year).\n\nFast-growing demand for air-captured CO2, for both carbon removal and low-emission synthetic hydrocarbon fuel production, is translating into several announcements for new, larger plants. Overall, plans for at least 130 DAC facilities are now at various stages of development. Some of the largest projects under development are in the United States, (Stratos, South Texas DAC hub, and HIF eFuels Matagorda County project in Texas, Cypress DAC hub in Louisiana, and Bison in Wyoming), Norway (the Kollsnes DAC project) and Iceland (the Mammoth project). Two megatonne-scale projects have also been announced in Kenya and the UAE, but are still at early stage.\n\nOut of the 130 DAC plants in planning, only around 15 facilities are currently in advanced development or under construction. If all these planned projects go ahead and steadily capture CO2 at full capacity, DAC deployment would reach around 3 Mt CO2 by 2030; this is more than 500 times today’s capture rate, but less than 5% of the 80 Mt CO2 needed to get on track with the NZE Scenario. All the remaining projects are still at an early stage, with no funding committed, and, in certain cases, not even an identified location for deployment.\n\nCapturing CO2 from the air is more energy intensive – and therefore more expensive – than capturing it from a point source. This is because CO2 in the atmosphere is much more dilute than, for example, in the flue gas of a power station or a cement plant.\n\nIn current DAC plant configurations, the proportion of heat in the total energy needed is influenced by the operating temperature of the technologies. Both S-DAC and L-DAC were initially designed to operate using both heat and electricity, with flexible configurations allowing for heat-only or electricity-only operation.\n\nA diverse portfolio of technologies exists for S-DAC, differing in energy intensity, operating temperature, and therefore cost.\n\nWhile S-DAC could be powered by a variety of low-carbon energy sources (e.g. heat pumps, geothermal, nuclear, solar thermal and biomass-based fuels), the current high temperature needs of today’s L-DAC configuration does not allow that level of flexibility. At best, L-DAC could operate using low-carbon fuels such as biomethane or renewables-based electrolytic hydrogen, but in the future L-DAC could shift to fully electric operation (currently only available for small-scale calcination). Large-scale L-DAC plants have been designed to use natural gas for heat and to co-capture the CO2 produced during combustion of the gas without the need for additional capture equipment. This integration substantially reduces the L-DAC plant’s overall emissions and can still enable carbon removal. However, any future ability of renewable energy to supply high-temperature heat could further reduce the process emissions, maximising the potential for carbon removal and associated revenue streams. Accelerating the commercial availability of large-scale electric calcination technology is considered a high priority to enable L-DAC plants to operate purely on renewable energy.\n\nA major advantage of DAC is its flexibility in siting: in theory, a DAC plant can be situated in any location that has low-carbon energy and a CO2 storage resource or CO2 use opportunity. Yet there may be limits to this siting flexibility. To date, DAC plants have been successfully operated in a range of climatic conditions, mostly in Europe and North America, but further testing is still needed in locations characterised, for instance, by extremely dry or humid climates, or polluted air. In the Middle East, at least eight small-scale projects are investigating or plan to investigate DAC operating performances in the region, for storage in peridotite formations. One of them, when operational, will become the first DAC-based carbon removal project relying on sea water for its operation. Several companies have also announced potential projects in Kenya, including Climeworks and Octavia Carbon.\n\nThe choice of location also needs to be based on the energy source needed to run the DAC plant. The energy used to capture the CO2 will determine if and how net-negative the system is and can also be a significant determinant of the cost per tonne of CO2 captured. For instance, both S-DAC and L-DAC technologies could be fuelled by renewable energy sources, while recovered low-grade waste heat could power an S-DAC system.\n\nCarbon removal requires the CO2 to be permanently stored. While the overall technical capacity for storing CO2 underground worldwide is understood to be vast, detailed site characterisation and assessment to render potential storage sites operational are still needed in many regions. An operating CO2 storage site can take around three to ten years to develop from project conception to CO2 injection. This could become a bottleneck for DAC deployment (and CCUS deployment in general) without accelerated efforts to identify and develop CO2 storage sites.\n\nThe development of agreed methodologies and accounting frameworks based on life cycle assessment (LCA) for DAC – alongside other CDR approaches – will be important to support its inclusion in regulated carbon markets and national inventories, and to serve as a tool to assess the benefits of subsidy schemes for DAC. Notably, the latest IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories do not include an accounting methodology for DAC, meaning that CDR associated with DAC cannot be counted towards meeting international mitigation targets under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nEfforts to develop carbon removal certification, including for DAC-based CDR, have commenced in Europe, the United States and Canada, as well as through initiatives such as the Mission Innovation CDR Mission and the UNFCCC Article 6.4 Supervisory Body. These efforts should be co-ordinated, with the aim of establishing internationally consistent approaches.\n\nThe CDR field would also benefit from leading jurisdictions acting on transboundary projects, where financing, demand, and/or fabrication come from one jurisdiction, but the facility is hosted in another jurisdiction. It is anticipated that in the future we will need a globally integrated industry for CDR, similar to that which exists today for energy, and a few early transboundary efforts would foster this development.\n\nThe market for DAC-based CO2 removal is expanding substantially. These carbon removal services are offered exclusively through the voluntary carbon market and are being purchased mostly by single companies (including Airbus, Shopify, Swiss Re, Microsoft, UBS) or demand aggregators such as Frontier (which committed to buy USD 1 billion of permanent carbon removals, including from DACS, recently from CarbonCapture Inc. and Heirloom) and Next Gen (who recently purchased CDR credits with the goal of reaching over one million CDRs by 2025, including but not exclusively from DACS) to meet their own climate targets. Amazon has pledge to buy 250,000 metric tonnes of carbon removal over 10 years from 1PointFive first DAC plant under construction in Texas. JP Morgan Chase has announced agreements with several players in the voluntary carbon market for the purchase of USD 200 million in high quality, durable CDR. In February 2024, Rockwell Automotive, signed an agreement to purchase DAC-based credits from the same 1PointFive plant. Online marketplaces such as Patch are also emerging to facilitate smaller companies in the purchasing of credits with the goal of accelerating the voluntary carbon market.\n\nThe popularity of these DAC-based carbon removal services stems mainly from their very high removal potential when associated with geological storage. Most of them are currently oversubscribed due to the very limited installed operating capacity available at present, despite the high price compared to other CDR solutions on the market (the price of the subscription varies, depending on the amount of removal purchased, from USD 600/t CO2 to USD 1 000/t CO2)."
