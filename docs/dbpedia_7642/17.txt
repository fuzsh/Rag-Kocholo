Arnold Schwarzenegger had success as a body builder, winning many titles, before becoming a famous actor known for roles in films like The Terminator. He switched careers from bodybuilding to acting despite having a thick Austrian accent. Schwarzenegger later got involved in politics as a Republican and was elected Governor of California in a 2003 recall election of the incumbent Democrat Gray Davis. The election attracted many unusual candidates beyond politicians due to the publicity of the recall. Schwarzenegger won with around 48% of the vote.
