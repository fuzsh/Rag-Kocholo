What happened to the top 10 finishers in 2003’s gubernatorial recall election?

1.) Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), 4,206,284, 48.58%

After seven years as California’s governor and the subsequent breakup of his marriage over his affair with a housekeeper that produced a child, Schwarzenegger, 66, is back to being an international movie star. A spokesman said he was unavailable for an interview because he was on location shooting a zombie movie in New Orleans. And apparently he’ll be back for a fifth “Terminator” film.

2.) Cruz Bustamante (D), 2,724,874, 31.47%

The then-lieutenant governor lost a 2006 race for insurance commissioner, then explored but didn’t enter a 2012 Central Valley congressional race. Now 60, he has a business and governmental consulting firm in Sacramento. Bustamante said his campaign urged voters to oppose the recall but vote for him if they didn’t “despite the fact that we knew it was a mixed message … because we believed it was the right message to give out.” He added that the entire recall process and Schwarzenegger’s win were the result of experienced politicians’ failure to communicate with voters.

3.) Tom McClintock (R), 1,161,287, 13.41%

Then a conservative Southern California state senator, he also lost a 2006 race for lieutenant governor, but in 2008 won a Northern California congressional seat that he holds today at age 57. “The recall was the last exit off a road to ruin that the state had been on — ironically, we took the exit and then two years later we got right back on that road,” he said, citing Schwarzenegger’s tax increases and new environmental regulations.

4.) Peter Camejo (Green), 242,247, 2.8%

The investment adviser from Folsom was presidential candidate Ralph Nader’s running mate in 2004, ran again for governor in 2006 and died of lymphoma in 2008 at age 68. In his posthumously published memoir, “North Star,” Camejo wrote that his recall run taught him the power of television: “I was on an airplane when a young woman saw me and yelled out so just about the whole airplane could hear, ‘Oh my God, I’m on the same plane with Peter Camejo!’” he wrote. “I shook her hand and said something genial. But most amusing to me was that the guy sitting next to me was clueless and asked me if I was a rock star.”

5.) Arianna Huffington (Independent), 47,505, 0.55%

The socialite-cum-commentator dropped out a week before the vote, urging her supporters to vote against the recall. She founded the Huffington Post in 2005 and was named among Forbes’ Most Influential Women In Media in 2009. She sold her company to AOL in 2011 for $315 million, but at age 63 remains president and editor-in-chief. She declined to be interviewed.

6.) Peter Ueberroth (R), 25,134, 0.29%

The president of the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics and former Major League Baseball commissioner dropped out a month before the vote, not long after most media outlets skipped his job-fair campaign event to go see Schwarzenegger toss T-shirts to a crowd. “There was no way that what I was talking about was going to be strong enough, so I quit spending my money and other people’s money and paid them all back,” he said. “But, no regrets.” He led the U.S. Olympic Committee from 2004 to 2008, and at age 76 is an investor in and chairman of the Newport Beach-based Contrarian Group investor forum.

7.) Larry Flynt (D), 17,458, 0.20%

His “Vote for a Smut-Peddler Who Cares” slogan never caught on, so the Hustler publisher and outspoken First Amendment activist soldiered on as a political muckraker: He offered a $1 million reward for information on 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s unreleased tax returns. “It was pure chaos. I didn’t get in the race because I had any illusions of going to Sacramento, I just wanted to raise a little hell and hope I didn’t get beat by Gary Coleman,” said Flynt, 70. “I was just taking part in the dysfunction.”

8.) Gary Coleman (Independent), 14,242, 0.16%

The former child star’s candidacy was conceived of and backed by the East Bay Express weekly newspaper to “point out the folly of replacing an imperfect but duly elected governor with an actor whose primary appeal appeared to be his fame,” then-Editor Stephen Buel later said. But many media outlets missed the satire, framing his “candidacy” as evidence of California’s lunacy. Coleman, who faced money and health problems for most of his life, died in 2010 at age 42.

9.) George Schwartzman (Independent), 12,382, 0.14%

“Schwartzman” might be mistaken for “Schwarzenegger” if you squint, but he insists his good showing was the result of campaigning around the state on a platform of fiscal conservatism, banning junk food in schools and creating prison work programs. Schwarzman, 67, of Indian Wells, now sits on the board of a medical-records company he cofounded and also has a gift-card business. “I finished right under Gary Coleman and right on top of a porn star,” he said. “That’s a line I use a few times a week.”

10.) Mary Carey (Independent), 11,179, 0.13%

The star of almost 100 porn films ran for governor again in 2006 as a write-in candidate but dropped out to care for her ailing mother, and she was on VH1’s “Celebrity Rehab” in 2008. Carey, 33, of Los Angeles, now makes soft-core films for Cinemax, does photo shoots and hosts a weekly online talk show, “Politically Naughty.” She said of the recall: “It made me a well-known name in the adult industry and a household name without having to do 200 or 300 movies. And I think it was great for politics in general because it showed we live in a true democracy, where anybody from all walks of life can run for office.”
