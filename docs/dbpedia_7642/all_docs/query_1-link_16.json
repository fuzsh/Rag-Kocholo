        "text": "In an emphatic end to an extraordinary campaign, Californians voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to recall Gov. Gray Davis and chose as his replacement Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born bodybuilder and movie actor making his first run for office.\n\nWith nearly 30 percent of the votes counted, the recall question on the two-part ballot was passing 55 percent to 44 percent, closely mirroring results from a survey of voters conducted for The New York Times and other news organizations. The interviews with more than 4,000 voters showed deep dissatisfaction with Mr. Davis's performance in office and a profound desire for change in direction in California, the nation's largest state.\n\nIn the contest to replace Mr. Davis, Mr. Schwarzenegger led his nearest competitor, Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, 50 percent to 31 percent, with 27 percent of the vote counted.\n\nIn an appearance before cheering supporters late in the night, after being introduced by the talk show host Jay Leno, Mr. Schwarzenegger thanked his wife, Maria Shriver, saying, ''I know how many votes I got because of you.''\n\nMr. Davis called Mr. Schwarzenegger shortly before 10 p.m. Pacific time to concede the election. Addressing supporters in a Los Angeles hotel ballroom a few minutes later, Mr. Davis said, ''Tonight the voters decided it's time for someone else to serve. My friends, we've had a lot of good nights over the last 20 years, but tonight the people did decide it's time for someone else to serve, and I accept their judgment.''\n\nWhen he said California would soon have a new governor, his supporters began to chant ''Recall, recall,'' perhaps a portent of further instability and bitterness.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
