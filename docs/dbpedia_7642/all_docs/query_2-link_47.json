        "text": "Jason Kelce is so darned popular in Pennsylvania that he could probably make a solid run at governor.\n\nAnd maybe he should, if that is something that really appeals to him. At least, that is, according to Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nSchwarzenegger was the guest on Jason and Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast this week, and Travis asked the bodybuilding legend, actor and former governor of California what he thought about Jason running for governor.\n\n“I mean, he’s got it all,” Travis said.\n\n“Yeah,” Schwarzenegger responded. “But it has to be in his heart.\n\n“He maybe has the right combination,” he continued. “The most important thing — number-one — is name recognition, so, of course, he has that. But the second most important thing is you have to be passionate, you have to really say, ‘I see myself as the governor.’”\n\nSchwarzenegger said he saw himself as governor and was convinced he could do a better job than the politicians who were in office at the time.\n\nPro Football Hall of Famer hospitalized, family asking for prayers\n\nFormer NFL receiver survives largest cut in ‘American Idol’ history\n\nFormer Eagles QB Carson Wentz has a new football home\n\nPhillies star Bryce Harper makes major life announcement heading into the season\n\nStar Pirates prospect Paul Skenes’ move to help veterans, first responders has social media talking\n\n“There was certain things that I felt very strongly (about) and the people elected me because of that,” he said. “And so, it depends, you know, if you are into the public service thing or not, if you are, of course you can win because you’re an imposing figure, you speak really well, you’re very clear, and all you have to do now is just convince the people (that) ‘I’m the man.’”\n\nTravis piped up and said, “Which, they already know you’re the man.”\n\n“Don’t get me pumped up and do this right now,” Jason said. “I got a clear vision of my career right now.”\n\nJason tried to end it there.\n\nArnold and Travis kept it going with Travis suggesting they start with a run for mayor.\n\n“No forget the mayor,” Schwarzenegger said. “You go for governor and then president.”\n\nJason wasn’t having it, and it is easy to understand why.\n\nThe 36-year-old just wrapped up a remarkable 13-year career in the NFL. He probably wants to rest up some and then reset.\n\nBut ... hey, there’s no doubt he could get votes. Probably a lot of votes.\n\nSo, maybe one day, Pa. will have Governor Kelce in office."
