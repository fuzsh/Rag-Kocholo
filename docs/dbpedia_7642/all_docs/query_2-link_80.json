        "text": "“Terminator” and now also “Governator” was born on July 30, 1947.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Did Schwarzenegger’s political strength or position change radically since he started as a Governor in 2003? How would you characterize his influence inside the Republican party and US politics generally?\n\n2. Do you think that some of the presidential candidates would seek Schwarzenegger’s support? Can such support help actually? Or you think that he’ll wait until the republican presidential candidate will emerge from the primaries and support only the winner?\n\n3. As California governor has maximum limit of two terms serving, given Schwarzenegger’s quite still young age for politics, what political career do you think he will pursue after finishing his terms? Or do you think that he is done with politics?\n\nAnswers:\n\nThad Kousser, Associate Professor of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley\n\n1. To answer your first question, I’ve attached some figures from a book chapter that I recently wrote on Gov. Schwarzenegger. I’ve also attached the text if you are really interested, but you can see the ups and downs of his popularity just by looking at Figure 4, which I have also pasted below.\n\n2. I think that any Republican candidate for president – and any Democrat, for that matter – would love to have the support of the popular governor of the nation’s largest state. He may try to exert an influence over the Republican primary, but I don’t think that any Republican candidate is likely to change his policy positions in order to get Schwarzenegger’s support. California has been a reliably blue state in recent presidential elections, and while Arnold’s endorsement will help a Republican in California, it is unlikely enough to carry the state.\n\n3. Your third question is on the mind of many CA political observers, and no one has a clear answer. The governor might run for Barbara Boxer’s Senate seat in 2010 (she may want to retire by then), but those who know him personally have told me that he could never be merely one of 100 Senators. He needs to be the star of the show, and it looks like there are no blockbuster productions available to him (barring a constitutional amendment making him eligible for the presidency).\n\nDavid Karol, Associate Professor, Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley\n\n1. His popularity was initially very great. It declined greatly in 2005 when moved to the right and provoked a confrontation with the state employee unions. They spent millions of dollars on television ads attacking him and helped convince the voters to reject all his proposals that November. He quickly learned his lesson and returned to policies more attuned to public opinion in the state. He has embraced environmentalism and practices what he calls “post-partisan” politics, working with the Democratic majority in the legislature on many issues. In short, he has learned how to survive in a state in which conservative Republican politics is no longer a winning strategy.\n\nHe has very limited influence in the Republican Party in California, let alone nationally. Right now he is in conflict with Republicans in the legislature over the budget. In general Republican activists and officials are far more conservative than Schwarzenegger. In 2004 they were happy to give him the opportunity to speak at the Republican National Convention and campaign for President Bush because of his popularity, but they have not embraced his policies. For his part, Schwarzenegger seems to have decided to worry about his own popularity and not to tie himself too closely to a party that is in the minority in California.\n\n2. I think most Republican candidates would still be very happy to have his support, if only because he attracts the attention of the media. The effect of any individual’s endorsement is limited, but candidates make a great effort to win the support of officials far less prominent than Schwarzenegger, suggesting that they believe endorsements have some value. Research conducted by me and my colleagues suggests that endorsements do help presidential candidates.\n\nI don’t know if or or when Schwarzenegger will endorse anyone. At one time he was seen as close to John McCain, but I think he doesn’t want to back a candidate who seems likely to lose.\n\n3. It is hard to know. There has been speculation that he would run for the Senate, but I don’t think that being one of a hundred and going to lots of committee meetings is his style.\n\nDavid McCuan, Assistant Professor of Political Science, Sonoma State University\n\n1. The Governator’s political strength has waxed and waned since the start of his term in 2003. Recently, both his popularity and political capital were on the upswing, but they have pulled back a bit according to the latest polls.\n\nThis more recent ebb from the recent rise in his popularity has occurred as the Governor and his handlers have attempted to get away from the dull, hot boredom that is California politics during budget season.\n\nTo wit, Arnold has gone out of his way the last few months to build his profile as a “Green” Governor, seeking support outside of California and overseas – notably in Europe – to be seen as the “Green Superhero.”\n\nThis has raised his stature in the US some, and outside of California certainly, in preparation for fellow politicians, i.e., Republican presidential candidates, seeking his endorsement as we head to the February 5th CA presidential primary. He’ll be a big, HUGE player in the “invisible primary” behind the scenes channeling dollars, support, and resources to whichever candidate strikes his fancy.\n\n2. Like any good Hollywood producer and marketing guy, the Arnold will wait, building the momentum and anticipation about which candidate he’ll endorse…he’ll build the suspense for as long as possible. Since the state primary occurs but two days after our US Super Bowl for football, I wouldn’t be surprised to see him that Sunday night, when all of the world is watching the two football teams announce his support at that critical juncture. I’ll explain why below.\n\n3. Two things here, first, Arnold while turning 60 now, his dad died at the age of 58, I believe. And, his dad’s father died at about the same age. This guy has poor genes, so he, in a very personal, yet, ironically public way, is living on borrowed time. He knows his genetic roots work against him being elected to say, national office, later on in his mid to late 1970s. He is not likely to be around that long.\n\nHe still wants to be president, and I don’t think will run for U.S. Senate anytime soon after he is termed out in 2010. Being a U.S. Senator is not an “executive” enough position for him. So, he’ll work nationally on several issues, putting ballot measures onto state ballots, building his profile, and seeking to build an ad hoc “Change the Constitution and Draft Arnold” movement. He is not done yet as he hasn’t conquered the Universe yet.\n\nHe is not done being in the public eye and being in politics. But, his age and the constitutional amendment process will work against his own self-imposed time constraints.\n\nAnd, when Tony Blair fails to bring peace to the Middle East, the Governator will be the next politician to step up to the plate to a crack at that job. His ego and his ambitions know no bounds.\n\nNicholas Cull, Professor of Public Diplomacy and Director of the Masters Program in Public Diplomacy, University of Southern California\n\n1. Schwarzenegger won on negative votes against Gray Davis and then tried a very right wing, Republican agenda. He clashed with the Trade Unions and that looked very ugly. When he lost his pretty much everythin he put on the ballot for the November 2005 vote he quite simply changed his color. He sacked his Republic advisors, hired Democrats and reinvented himself as a middle of the road guy. He is clearly no friend of Bush and the two avoid eachother. He has given the public what they want.\n\n2. I’m not sure how he’ll play the presidential election — his big contribution already has been to move the primary from June to February (it will happen on 5 February 2008) so candidates have to pay attention to California. In the past the race was decided before California got to choose — they just came here to raise money!\n\n3. I assume that Schwarzenegger will look to a Senate seat and that the Mayor of Los Angeles is after the governorship."
