        "text": "We asked readers, 10 years after the recall of Gov. Gray Davis, what is the legacy of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\nHe got little right except environment, gay rights\n\nThere is nothing good to say about Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor.\n\nI was one of the 11 percent who did not view his early performance as laudable. Doing away with the vehicle tax rise (which in reality was not a raise, but only restored the tax to its original value before it got reduced for some reason I cannot remember) cost the state $4 billion a year, which over Arnold’s terrible reign of seven years equals $28 billion — the exact amount he left the state in debt.\n\nHis position on driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants was not very far-sighted or understanding. His unwarranted ballot initiatives were another blunder.\n\nWhat did he get right besides a liberal view on gay rights and the importance of protecting the environment? I give him good marks there, but as far as ranking him as a good governor, he was one of the worst, up there with George Deukmejian.\n\n— Larry Kittiver, Harbor City\n\nElection victory wasn’t legitimate in the first place\n\nEvidently very few in the electorate realize how Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor.\n\nHe could not get the nomination from his own party, so even before the election, he had already organized a vicious and unscrupulous recall of Gray Davis, with himself to be the victor.\n\nHis legacy is zero with a capital Z. His wife Maria Shriver could fill in the blanks if necessary.\n\n— Pat Ostrye, Monrovia\n\nSchwarzenegger was long on talk and short on action\n\nLike former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was long on talk and short on positive action and results.\n\nHe had his cigar tent, while the former mayor had his plane ticket and ever-present cameras. Great for them but not us.\n\n— Morris Chapnick, West Hollywood\n\nSchwarzenegger didn’t keep promise of an audit\n\nI voted for Arnold Schwarzengger because he promised to have a major audit of how and where the state government was spending the taxpayers’ money, and then publish a comprehensive report to us.\n\nHe did not keep that promise. I now consider my vote a mistake.\n\n— Trudy Saltmarsh, West Covina\n\nNot many governors could taunt foes as ‘girlie men’\n\nSchwarzenegger’s legacy: “Girlie men.”\n\n— Gary Murph, Bellflower\n\nFrom our online comments section:\n\nHe lacked the political muscle the job required\n\nMy sense of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s time in office is that he was in over his head.\n\nHe wrote that Arthur Laffer was an economist that he liked, yet he didn’t try to implement any of Laffer’s ideas on tax reform.\n\nHe didn’t come across as a strong personality in a leadership position, which is how he and his voters saw him.\n\nHe hit on ideas and thinking that didn’t let you think he was a true believer.\n\nHe was more successful in bodybuilding and acting, but that success didn’t carry over to politics, where a different kind of personality helps.\n\n— Russell Jeans\n\nFrom a San Jose Mercury News commentary by Terry Christensen, co-author of “Recall! California’s Political Earthquake”:\n\n“(Arnold) Schwarzenegger wasn’t a bad governor, but he failed to solve the state’s basic budget problems — a key issue in the recall election. In fact, he made some decisions that worsened the situation.\n\n“And like (Gray) Davis, he had problems with the legislature, not least because he couldn’t lead his own party there. Schwarzenegger could negotiate with Democrats but he couldn’t count on the support of Republican legislators, who were mostly more conservative than he was.\n\n“So the most obvious expectations of the recall did not come to fruition. But it seems likely that current political leaders of our state learned something from it. And it may have precipitated a wave of political reform that has done more to make California governable than the recall itself did.”"
