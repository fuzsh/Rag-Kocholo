        "text": "SACRAMENTO — Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger claimed victory Wednesday in his effort to reform the way California draws its legislative districts.\n\nOpponents of the hotly contested ballot initiative, however, insisted it was premature to declare the election over because possibly hundreds of thousands of absentee and provisional ballots remained uncounted.\n\nIf Proposition 11’s slight lead indeed turns into an outright win, Schwarzenegger’s effort would be his first successful attempt at preventing legislators from drawing and approving the geographical boundaries of their own legislative districts, which critics call a self-serving task that leads to partisan gridlock.\n\n“This is really the first time that an initiative like this has won in America,” Schwarzenegger told reporters in Los Angeles. “This is why this is historic — the first time where really citizens independently of the Legislature . . . will draw the district lines in the future.\n\n“So this is a huge, huge victory for us, and I just want to say thank you to the people.”\n\nWith all precincts reporting late Wednesday, Proposition 11 was winning, but only by about 100,000 votes.\n\n“We really don’t know how it’s going to turn out,” said “No on 11” spokesman Paul Hefner. “Are there enough votes out there to change the outcome? I don’t know, but we sure want to see what those ballots look like before we start declaring winners and losers.”\n\nA win would give Schwarzenegger much-needed momentum at the ballot box — where governors turn when they fail at getting their political agendas approved by the Legislature.\n\nVoters in 2005 rejected Schwarzenegger’s four government-reform measures, including an initiative on redistricting. And next year, Schwarzenegger plans to ask voters to approve budget-reform measures to keep the state from racking up budget shortfalls, which the governor is expected to announce today is now at $11 billion.\n\n“He desperately needs political capital going forward in this economic crisis that the state has,” which will help Schwarzenegger promote next year’s special election ballot measures, said GOP consultant Rob Stutzman.\n\nSchwarzenegger, who is termed out of office in early 2010, won’t benefit from Proposition 11 because legislative districts would be drawn in 2011 at the earliest.\n\nStutzman said the initiative nonetheless is important to Schwarzenegger’s legacy “because it achieves one of the primary political reforms that he’s always sought to accomplish.”\n\nPolls leading up to Tuesday’s vote showed Proposition 11 with an advantage, though about a quarter of the electorate was undecided on how to vote.\n\nThat indecisiveness, along with a well-funded “Yes on 11” campaign led by Republican Schwarzenegger and a “No on 11” campaign promoted by many Democrats, may have prompted the tight race, analysts said.\n\nIn addition, said Mark Baldassare, president and chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California, Proposition 11 confused voters “about how this process would work and whether it would lead to improvement.”\n\nUnder the current law, committees consisting of sitting legislators meet every 10 years to redraw political boundaries for the Assembly, Senate and state Board of Equalization, responding to population changes based on the latest U.S. Census data. The committees present their recommendations to the full Legislature for vote.\n\nBut the proposed law would give the job of redistricting to a 14-member citizens commission, including five Democrats and five Republicans.\n\nProponents, including Common Cause California and AARP, said the initiative would prevent districts from being drawn solely to benefit a particular political party, which only guarantees that the candidate from that party will be re-elected.\n\nOpponents, including Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata, D-Oakland, categorized the initiative as “unfair” because it proposes to empower a small commission to make important decisions for all of California. Critics also noted that with 10 commission seats chosen by the party affiliation, there’s no guarantee this won’t be political. And, critics add, once the lawmakers are elected, there’s the possibility they will always vote along party lines, which causes gridlock."
