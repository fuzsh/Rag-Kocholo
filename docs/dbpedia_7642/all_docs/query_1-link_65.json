        "text": "On Tuesday, December 22nd, Hollywood action star and former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, presented Democracy Action Hero Awards to public officials who showed true leadership, bravery and a commitment to American democracy in the 2020 general election. The online award ceremony honored five individuals who stood up to attacks and intimidation while working diligently to ensure the integrity of our election process. The awards ceremony revealed surprise insights from five of the most exemplary heroes of American democracy and what really happened on the ground in the election.\n\n“The public servants we are honoring usually don’t spend their time in the spotlight,” said Arnold Schwarzenegger. “They usually don’t make headlines. And they usually don’t get much credit. But they are the backbone of our democracy. They work to make sure that all of us, regardless of our party or who we vote for, have the ability to vote and trust our elections. I want to thank every elections administrator, every poll worker, and every volunteer around the country. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You are all the heroes who make our democracy work.”\n\nThe Democracy Action Hero Awards follow the nonpartisan Democracy Grants for Voting Access and Election Administration initiative launched by Schwarzenegger ahead of the November 2020 elections. Administered by the USC Schwarzenegger Institute, the initiative awarded $2.5 million in grants to 33 counties in eight states formerly protected by the Voting Rights Act. This funding helped reach 3.5 million voters. Counties that received nonpartisan Schwarzenegger grants opened 1,305 early voting and election day polling places, and voter turnout increased by 6.3% points.\n\nIn an introductory letter to officials, Schwarzenegger said, “These grants are completely non-partisan and will be offered to those who demonstrate the greatest need and ability to close gaps in voting access. I don’t care if you are an independent authority, a Democratic elections official, or a Republican elections official – I just don’t want a single American to lose their ability to vote because of a lack of funding.”\n\nPARTICIPANTS:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, 38th Governor of California\n\nBrad Raffensperger, Georgia Secretary of State\n\nChristopher C. Krebs, Former Director, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure at the US Department of Homeland Security\n\nShauna Dozier, Director of Elections and Registration, Clayton County, GA\n\nNancy Boren, Director of Elections and Registration in Muscogee County, GA\n\nChris Hollins, Former County Clerk, Harris County, TX\n\nDr. Dana Goldman, Interim Dean, USC Price School of Public Policy\n\nDr. Christian Grose, Academic Director, USC Schwarzenegger Institute\n\nPROGRAM:\n\nWelcome\n\nDr. Dana Goldman, Acting Dean, Price School of Public Policy\n\nMaster of Ceremonies\n\nDr. Christian Grose, Academic Director, USC Schwarzenegger Institute\n\nVideo\n\nUSC Schwarzenegger Institute Democracy Grants Initiative\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nGov.
