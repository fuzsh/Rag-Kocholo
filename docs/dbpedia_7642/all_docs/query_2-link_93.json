        "text": "If he could, Arnold Schwarzenegger would join the race to be elected president of the United States of America in 2024. This was confirmed by the renowned actor during a recent interview with the Who’s Talking podcast on CNN. His desire to make it possible is so great that he even shares the reason why they would vote for him.\n\nWhy isn’t Schwarzenegger running for President of the United States?\n\nWe must remember that the country’s Constitution requires that the president be born in the United States of America in order to be elected, a requirement that Schwarzenegger fails to meet: he was born in Graz, Austria, in 1947. Although he has been a US citizen since 1983, it is not enough to aim a little higher in his political career.\n\nWhen asked if he would run for the race in 2024, the actor answered emphatically: “Absolutely. Put me in because it’s, look – it’s a no brainer. I see so clearly how I could win that that election,” he emphasized. Schwarzenegger alludes to his time as governor of California, where he learned what people are looking for when they enter their ballot.\n\n“When that was, you know, running for governor, it was clear that people are looking for some new answer, not a right wing or left wing, but someone that can bring the nation together and doesn’t see the other party as the enemy…There’s just so many things that need to be done. And can be done. And what makes it so wonderful is because it’s doable. It’s all doable, or at least it’s just people coming together and say yes, we can do it,” he concludes. Unfortunately, the chances of it happening are not in his favor.\n\nAs far as Arnold Schwarzenegger is concerned, Netflix has just premiered his latest work on the platform: FUBAR. The series allows him to return to comedy without forgetting the action and the high-voltage moments that have accompanied him for so many years. You can watch the first season in its entirety as part of the catalog right now."
