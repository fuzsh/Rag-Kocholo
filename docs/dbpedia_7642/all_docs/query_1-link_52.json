        "text": "For many, it was probably their easiest — and only — chance to run for governor of the nation’s most populous state.\n\nTo get on the statewide ballot in the 2003 California recall, you only had to submit 65 signatures of registered voters and pay a $3,500 fee. No partisan primaries to slog through and less than 11 weeks of campaigning. Plus plenty of free media attention as the eyes of the world were on California that chaotic summer.\n\nSo ultimately 135 Californians qualified to run for governor, a mix of legitimate political contenders, publicity-seekers and some who just thought it would be fun to see their names on the ballot. Besides the names like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lt. Gov Cruz Bustamante and political commentator Arianna Huffington, the candidates included porn mogul Larry Flynt, Green Party representative Peter Camejo and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth.\n\nU.S. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Sacramento, who was in the state Senate representing Thousand Oaks at the time, didn’t agree with some in his party who thought he shouldn’t challenge Schwarzenegger, who was also a Republican, but far more moderate. The conservative lawmaker ended up finishing third with 13.5 percent of the vote.\n\n“The feeling was that if two Republicans ran, neither would win,” McClintock said. “I didn’t agree with that. And I think me being in the race brought out voters who supported the recall, and it wouldn’t have happened without them.”\n\nMcClintock said his candidacy also forced Schwarzenegger to take more conservative positions on issues such as the car tax and workers’ compensation reform.\n\nMcClintock said he continues to believe the recall was valuable and sent a message that reverberates with politicians today.\n\n“The recall is an important safety valve,” McClintock said. “Human beings make mistakes, and the recall is an opportunity to correct that mistake.”\n\nThe race also had its share of fringe or novelty candidates — those who clearly had no shot at winning but joined the race anyway.\n\nMary “Mary Carey” Cook, a porn actress, decided to jump in at the urging of her production company.\n\n“I was 23 and a theater major in college,” recalled Carey, who ran as an independent. “I had taken some political science classes, but I never graduated.”\n\nShe said she viewed the campaign almost like theater. She showed up at Los Angeles City Hall to collect signatures wearing skimpy jean shorts and a red-white-and-blue bikini top, and declared campaign positions that included a tax on breast implants and making lap dances tax deductible.\n\nShe finished 10th with more than 11,000 votes.\n\n“I’m sure there were a lot of people who came in 20th or 30th who were more qualified than me, but what I learned is that if you are a good public speaker, have a great personality and charisma, it goes a long way,” Carey said.\n\nCarey said she actually voted against the recall of Gov. Gray Davis, but then voted for herself for governor.\n\nShe also flirted with running for statewide office in 2005 and says she would like to run again some day.\n\n“I learned that I loved politics and how it all works,” Carey said. “And, I saw people can make a difference. My top issue was allowing gay marriage, and now it’s happening. I guess I was ahead of my time.”\n\nLos Angeles billboard icon Angelyne also ran, finishing 29th with 2,536 votes. Watermelon-smashing comedian Leo Gallagher finished 16th. Flynt came in seventh.\n\nPerhaps the best known novelty candidate was actor Gary Coleman. An Oakland newspaper put him up to running, paying his fee and promoting his candidacy to highlight the comical nature of the whole recall effort. Coleman himself said he would not campaign and would vote for Schwarzenegger. Coleman, who died in 2010 at age 42, finished eighth with more than 14,000 votes.\n\nSome were just motivated by the ease of getting on the ballot and the thrill of calling themselves a candidate for governor.\n\n“Where else, for $3,500 and a few friends, would I have a chance to be on a statewide ballot?” recalled Robert Mannheim of Agoura Hills, who ran as a retired businessman and a Democrat and received all of 914 votes out of more than 9.4 million cast.\n\n“I told one reporter that where else could I get all this cool memorabilia like bumper stickers, flags and pens that my children and grandchildren will have to sell at swap meets.”\n\nMannheim said he has no regrets about running for governor and that he learned a great deal about the demands of political life.\n\nDr. Ronald Friedman of Woodland Hills said he finds it hard to believe that 10 years have passed since the recall, in which he received 419 votes.\n\n“I thought it was a unique opportunity to get involved and be more than just a voter,” Friedman said. “I got to meet some interesting people and got my friends and family involved in a process of government they never would have otherwise.\n\n“What’s amusing, as I look back, is that I received something like 400 votes. Since then, I must have run into 2,000 people who said they voted for me. I’m not sure what that says about my friends.”\n\nFriedman, like Mannheim, never ran for any other political office but says the overall experience was worth it.\n\n“Looking back, I’m not sure the recall changed anything,” Friedman said. “I’m not sure Schwarzenegger did anything different or better than Gray Davis. What I have noticed is that the whole discussion has gotten so loud and harsh. It’s not people working out their problems.”"
