        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Arnold Schwarzenegger has voted for his successor but he won't say who should get the lead role in the sequel to his term as California's governor.\n\nSchwarzenegger voted Tuesday morning in West Los Angeles. He told reporters he won't reveal until nighttime whether he chose Democrat Jerry Brown or fellow Republican Meg Whitman.\n\nHe did urge voters to oppose Proposition 23, which is funded primarily by Texas oil companies and would effectively put the state's greenhouse gas emissions law on hold. Schwarzenegger says he's confident voters will reject efforts to suspend it.\n\nThe governor, who's faced criticism over the state's financial crisis, says he thinks he'll be remembered for increasing environmental protections and reforming the state's worker's compensation law."
