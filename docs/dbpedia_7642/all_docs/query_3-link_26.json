        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10 - Chastened but not quite contrite, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Thursday that he alone was at fault for the decisive voter rejection of the four ballot measures he had promoted on behalf of his self-styled reform agenda.\n\n\"The buck stops with me,\" the governor said in a televised news conference at the Capitol in Sacramento, two days after the special election in which his proposals were defeated. \"I take full responsibility for this election. I take full responsibility for its failure.\"\n\nHe declined, however, to apologize either to his opponents, whom he attacked throughout the campaign, or to voters, for spending $50 million of public money to conduct the election.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger called the election to try to win passage of measures that would have altered the rules for teacher tenure, limited unions' political fund-raising, capped state spending and changed the way legislative districts are drawn. Voters rejected all four of his initiatives, as well as four unrelated measures.\n\nThe governor, a Republican, maintained Thursday that the public supported his ideas, or at least some form of them, but wanted him and the Democratic-controlled Legislature to resolve their differences through the usual political process, not through an expensive, high-volume ballot campaign.\n\n\"If I would do another 'Terminator' movie,\" he said, \"I would have Terminator travel back in time and tell Arnold not to have a special election.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
