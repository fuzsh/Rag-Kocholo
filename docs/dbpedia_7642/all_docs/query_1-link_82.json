        "text": "When election workers in North Carolina logged onto a video call Monday, they likely expected the early voting updates and preparation plans for Election Day to be discussed.\n\nThey likely did not plan, however, to see Arnold Schwarzenegger looking back at them on the screen.\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections welcomed the former California governor, movie star and voter access advocate on its check-in call with election board staff from all 100 counties as motivation and a surprise.\n\nSchwarzenegger praised the North Carolinians for their work conducting early voting and preparing to count votes cast in the ongoing 2022 midterm elections, calling them the “true democracy action heroes” and saying he wanted to “pump you up a little bit.”\n\n“We never should forget that people do work at the poll sites and organize and make it possible for us to vote,” said Schwarzenegger, “because that is the ultimate [act] of democracy.. And so this is why it is so important today to let you know that you’re doing an extraordinary job and a very, very important job.”\n\nThe former body building champion likened planning and holding elections to running in a marathon. He said the “last few miles” are the most critical time in the entire process, calling the next week of finishing early voting and working through Election Day “extremely important.”\n\nSchwarzenegger also addressed the challenges poll workers have endured in the last election cycle, including facing increased harassment and threats from voters and poll-watchers since the 2020 elections. He told the North Carolina workers to continue working toward the goal of maintaining a non-partisan process and voting environments.\n\n“I know poll workers have a tough time this time,” he said. “People try to intimidate them. People try to threaten them. But nothing should intimidate you — because whatever you do, it is such wonderful, wonderful work to make it possible for all of us to vote and to participate in this democracy.”\n\nAt one point of the call, Schwarzenegger paused his comments to welcome his pet miniature donkey onto the call and feed him a cookie.\n\nNorth Carolina State Board of Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell said she had been working to recruit Schwarzenegger to make an appearance to encourage the election staff since July. She said it was achieved through collaboration with the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy at the University of Southern California. Bell also credited and thanked the former California governor’s institute for giving grants to election sites in 2020 to help fund and keep voting sites open.\n\nOn the call, Bell told Schwarzenegger it was an “honor” to hear him speak and that his advice of “don’t count the hours, count the votes” resonated with her.\n\n“The comments are tremendous over in the chat,” said the state elections director with a laugh. “You definitely have pumped us up and given us an extra bit of adrenaline to get going for this week.”\n\nEarly voting in North Carolina runs through Saturday, November 5 and Election Day is on Tuesday, November 8. The full video of Schwarzenegger’s visit to the North Carolina Board of Elections’ call can be watched here.\n\nMore information about local elections and voting information can be found on Chapelboro’s Local Election News page.\n\nPhoto via the North Carolina State Board of Elections.\n\nChapelboro.com does not charge subscription fees, and you can directly support our efforts in local journalism here.
