        "text": "The collapse of Malaysia’s multiethnic reformist government by a party coup in February 2020 called “Sheraton Move” can be assessed along at least three dimensions: first, inter-personality-clash power struggle between key Malay leaders and their parties; second, the deep ethnic divide which drives for rejection of a multiethnic government in favour of return to a more pro-Malay equilibrium; third, dysfunctional legislative-executive relations and dysfunctional parties, which reduce Parliament to the Prime Minister’s electoral college, deny constructive roles in policy competition and law-making to opposition parliamentarians and government backbenchers, so centralise power within parties that cyclical infighting and splintering is made inevitable, collectively making the party system vulnerable to defections and chaotic realignments. This paper focuses on the parliament-party dimension and examines how Malaysia’s deviations from the Westminster model have contributed to the political impasse, how the payroll vote is cynically used to sustain a fragile government and how keeping the system unchanged may lead to greater instability and cause multiparty democracy to be discredited.\n\nThis research paper traces the historical role played by the political parties and their impact on the national unity in Malaysia. This research paper aims to grasp the realities of politics and homogeneity of political alliances in Malaysia, which help to consolidate and mobilize support to achieve social, economic and political goals. The paper gives the conceptual idea about the political parties and their effectiveness for the national integration.\n\nThis article analyses factionalism within ruling and opposition parties in Malaysia, with a focus on party splits and/or the toppling or near-toppling of dominant factions at the national level. Political parties are either composed of clientelist or programmatic factions or represent hybrids that combine clientelist and programmatic factionalism. The strength and the type of factionalism depend upon policy space and the intensity of control over party groups. Programmatic factionalism is more probable if policy space is wide. Policy space is an effect of the positioning (relatively dependent or independent from other parties in the coalition) and the basic ideology of a party, that is, the major stance on religion, ethnicity, and the shape of the political system at large. If there is hardly any policy space, factionalism will be clientelistic rather than programmatic. Whether this type of factionalism arises is contingent upon the intensity of control over groups within the party ...\n\nThe political party considers the association of the peoples who have same views about the governance of the state. This study discusses the goals and purposes of its members through the attainment and by the use of political influences. It is the constitutional right of citizens to develop a political party with the collaboration of people who have the same vision to obtain the goals. Malaysia has Multi Political Party System. The main Malay party is BN (Barisan Nasional), and a coalition of fourteen Parties of different ethnicities, in this coalition-leading party, UMNOsince the freedom of Malaysia analysed through the data. Otherpolitical parties are Democratic Action Party (DAP), Parti Islamse Malaysia (PAS) and Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR). The alliancewas made in 1952 by the participation of different parties, inwhich Parties leading party United Malays NationalOrganization (UMNO) and the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) are most important. Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC)also became part of this coalition, and BN became the nation’s dominant political party and worked for the betterment of nation.\n\nMalaysian politics in the post-2008 has started to gain its own currency. People’s proclivity towards the rapid rise of the opposition was perceived as an emerging trend due to political instability. The direction is indeed escalating in a more persuasive ways. The advent of inter-party system establishment, particularly the opposition, has provided a significant political comprehension as it grew out of the misplaced ideological attachment. People started to opt for the opposition and perceived it as the bringer of dissenting voices and awaited yardstick to ensure greater participation and pave the way for democratization. The emerging trend in the post-2008 has to a certain extent disclosed an uneasy feeling for the ruling BN in maintaining some sort of penetrated status quo. However, the case was a bit different in the September 2014 Pengkalan Kubor by-election. The by-election was called to be held and witnessed the struggling competing parties, namely between BN (UMNO) and PR (...\n\nThis article explains how the electoral one-party state of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in Malaysia is maintained through constituency delimitation. It examines how the means of inter-state malapportionment, intra-state malapportionment, gerrymandering, pre-delimitation boundary changes and seat increase are used in the on-going delimitation exercises. Malapportionment and gerrymandering in the last cycle of delimitation exercises in 2003–5 had secured Prime Minister Najib Razak a comfortable 60% parliamentary majority in 2013 despite winning only 47% of popular votes. While Razak may sufer greater attrition of votes due to his global fnancial scandal involving Malaysia’s state sovereign fund, 1MDB, he may still win a bigger parliamentary majority in the upcoming election, which must be held latest by August 2018. The article questions if the First- Past-the-Post (FPTP) electoral system, which is not only susceptible to manipulations, but also very winner-takes-all in nature, suits Malaysia’s plural society."
