They overwhelmingly questioned her readiness for the job despite her three and a half years as vice president,” said Margaret Talev, director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism & Citizenship in Washington.\n\nJuly 10, 2024 | WRVO\n\nJoshua Darr, a professor at Syracuse University, said this means if you’re watching TV, your ad breaks are going to be filled with political ads. “Districts that are drawn to be competitive like this one are even rarer than they used to be,” Darr said. “At the same time, there is more money than there used to be in buying ads. That combination means that Syracuse is going to get soaked.”\n\nJuly 10, 2024 | Newsweek\n\nJoshua Darr, an associate professor of political communications at Syracuse University, told Newsweek that “Pelosi’s plea for Biden to decide is at odds with his clear statements that the only way he’s dropping out is if ‘the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me to.’ I can’t know what she’s thinking, but I doubt she’d still be imploring him to decide if he’d come to the decision she thought was best.”\n\nJuly 10, 2024 | AP News\n\nPolitical advertisements on social media are one of the best ways for candidates to reach supporters and raise campaign cash. But as a new report from Syracuse University shows, weak regulations governing online ads and haphazard enforcement by tech companies also make ads a prime source for misleading information about elections — and a tantalizingly easy way for con artists to target victims.\n\nJuly 10, 2024 | SU News\n\n“The prevalence of inauthentic groups, scams and deepfake voices just within the parameters of the search shows a massive amount of manipulation and misinformation targeting Americans through the political information consumed online,” says Margaret Talev, Kramer Director of the IDJC, professor of practice in the Newhouse School and a journalist.\n\nJune 26, 2024 | NBC News\n\n“These voters were really angry RFK won’t be on the debate stage and saw it as a collusion between the major parties and mainstream media,” Talev said. “Several believe his independence from both parties makes him more likely to make or get deals. In 2008, [Barack] Obama was the outsider. In 2016 Trump was the outsider. These voters see RFK as this year’s version of that.”\n\nJune 19, 2024 | Podcast episode\n\nSummary: The steady decline of traditional media seems a near certainty. In this podcast episode, Rick speaks with Margaret Talev, a journalist and head of the Institute for Democracy, Journalism, and Citizenship at Syracuse University. They discuss the evolving challenges in the news industry, including the decline of local news, the rise of misinformation on social media, and the growing distrust in media, particularly among conservatives. Talev emphasizes the importance of reliable news sources for a healthy democracy and describes efforts to rebuild local news and civic engagement. She also shares insights from focus groups and polling on voter behavior and media consumption, highlighting the impact of media sources on public perceptions and polarization.\n\nMay 23, 2024 | NBC News\n\nMargaret Talev: “They view Biden as failing to take actions at the border — and they credit Trump with trying to take action even if they disagreed with many of the actions themselves. Trump’s promise to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico may be his best known plan — these voters panned the idea and don’t want him to try again if he’s re-elected — yet they don’t hold it against him.”\n\nMay 7, 2024 | AP News\n\nStromer-Galley analyzed more than 24,000 political ad buys on Instagram and Facebook that were placed by 1,800 organizations from Sept. 2023 through February. Overall, the ads cost $15 million and were displayed nearly 870 million times. The findings were published Tuesday by the ElectionGraph Project at Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism & Citizenship through a partnership with the data science firm Neo4j.\n\nMay 7, 2024 | SU News\n\nJohanna Dunaway, professor of political science and research director of the Syracuse University Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship (IDJC), has been named a 2024 Carnegie Fellow. She is one of 28 distinguished scholars and writers selected as a Carnegie Fellow to study political polarization.\n\nMay 2, 2024 | NBC News\n\nMargaret Talev: Several of these young voters said outright that Biden’s signing of a law that could lead to TikTok being banned in the U.S. could make them less likely to vote for him — and some said if Trump protected their TikTok access, that might sway them to support him.\n\nApril 4, 2024 | NBC News\n\nMargaret Talev: It may largely be a rationalization or picking up on talking points by union voters who already prefer Trump. But talking about being pro-worker also may resonate more broadly in this era of increased focus on the individual and decreased faith in institutions.\n\nMarch 13, 2024 | Yahoo! News\n\nJoshua Darr: It’s clearly a different election this time around — you could argue both Biden and Trump are weaker, and it’s a matter of relative weakness — but with a long eight months of unknowns in the way.\n\nDecember 6, 2023 | Edelman Trust Institute\n\nAmericans, like news consumers everywhere, not only need but want to have better media literacy, a better grasp on how government and the economy work, and the skills to avoid being manipulated or misinformed. But most people don’t know where to get these, or whom to trust.\n\nNovember 17, 2023 | Axios\n\nTwenty years ago today, Arnold Schwarzenegger was sworn in as California’s unlikely 38th governor. He spoke with Axios earlier this week to promote a new audiobook on the legacy of that recall election.\n\nOctober 26, 2023 | SU News\n\nTwo Syracuse University institutes are welcoming researchers, academic leaders, policymakers and journalists for discussions in Washington, D.C., about innovations, vulnerabilities and the future of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe two-day AI Policy Symposium that begins today in the nation’s capital is organized by the Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship (IDJC) and the Autonomous Systems Policy Institute (ASPI).\n\nOctober 17, 2023 | PolitiFact\n\nHe spent eight years in the White House, nearly every move recorded by press and watched by staff. But six years after former President Barack Obama left office, some conservative media figures aggressively circulated a salacious rumor: that Obama is secretly gay.\n\nSeptember 6, 2023 | SU News\n\nThe Axios-Generation Lab-Syracuse University AI Experts Survey of computer science professors finds that a majority of computer science experts at top U.S research universities want to see the creation of a new federal agency or global organization to govern artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAugust 2, 2023 | PBS Newshour\n\n“For those Americans or those citizens who are only watching the national news, they often only get this sort of game-frame style coverage, that it’s almost like sports reporting with Democrats on one side and Republicans on the other,” says Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship research director, Johanna Dunaway.\n\nJuly 17, 2023 | Axios Today\n\nLife is about to get pricier for millions of families, with a triple whammy of pandemic-era safety net programs coming to an end around the same time this fall. How will this all pan out?\n\nJuly 7, 2023 | Washington Week\n\n“It’s a potential lifeline or at least a big help for Ukraine, but also it’s not what Ukraine really wants, which is NATO membership,” says Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship director, Margaret Talev.\n\nFebruary 27, 2023 | CNN\n\nCNN political analyst Margaret Talev reacts to a new video released by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) and whether it’s an indication that he’ll run for president in 2024.\n\nDecember 14, 2022 | SU News\n\nAs a Los Angeles Times political writer, Seema Mehta ’98 B.A. (PSt) used to hear grumbling about the press at campaign events, but voters still understood she had a job to do. “They would say, ‘Oh, the media’s so biased, but I’m not talking about you, honey,’” she laughs.\n\nDecember 14, 2022 | SU News\n\nAmericans on opposite sides of the political divide may not agree on anything other than the divide itself. And what may have at one time felt like a crack now feels like a chasm.\n\nNovember 15, 2022 | SU News\n\nThe S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications today announced the appointment of veteran political journalist Margaret Talev as the Kramer Director of the Syracuse University Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship Institute.\n\nJune 9, 2022 | SU News\n\nSyracuse University will soon launch the new Center for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship in Washington, D.C. A joint effort of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications and the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, the center will promote nonpartisan, evidence-based research and dialogue in the public interest and support the work of faculty and students."
