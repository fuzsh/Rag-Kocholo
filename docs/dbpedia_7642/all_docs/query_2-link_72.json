        "text": "Recall vote / Oct. 7\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nLt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante holds a\n\nwide lead over Arnold Schwarzenegger in the race to succeed Gov. Gray Davis,\n\naccording to a new Los Angeles Times Poll, which finds the Republican vote splintered\n\namong several GOP contenders.\n\nAs the sole major Democrat running\n\nto replace Davis -- should the incumbent be ousted Oct. 7 -- Bustamante enjoys\n\nthe support of 35 percent of likely voters.\n\nSchwarzenegger received 22 percent\n\nsupport, followed by three fellow Republicans: state Sen. Tom McClintock with\n\n12 percent, businessman Peter V. Ueberroth with 7 percent and Bill Simon Jr.\n\n-- the GOP's 2002 gubernatorial nominee -- with 6 percent.\n\nSimon abruptly quit the race Saturday,\n\nafter the poll was completed. He said ''there are too many Republicans'' running\n\nand expressing concern his candidacy would undercut GOP efforts to oust Davis\n\nand replace the Democrat with one of their own.\n\nThree other gubernatorial contenders\n\nwho have won prominent mention lag far behind the major-party hopefuls, according\n\nto the Times Poll. Independent Arianna Huffington received just — percent support\n\nfrom likely voters and the Green Party's Peter Camejo drew — percent, tying\n\nhim with Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt.\n\nUnder the idiosyncratic rules that\n\ngovern the recall vote, all 135 candidates from assorted parties are listed\n\non the same ballot. The candidate who gets the most votes will become governor\n\n-- if Davis is kicked out of office, which is the first matter to be decided\n\nin the Oct. 7 election.\n\nThe Times Poll, completed Thursday\n\nnight, found that 50 percent of likely voters favored the recall of Davis and\n\n45 percent were opposed, with 5 percent undecided.\n\nBut the contest remains unsettled\n\nand polling is a particular challenge in this environment, given the special\n\nnature of the election and the way the campaign has been collapsed into a relatively\n\nbrief, two-month time frame. The poll suggested a great deal of fluidity: While\n\nviews on the recall itself were quite fixed, 46 percent of likely voters said\n\nthey could change their minds about who to support between now and Oct. 7.\n\nDemocrats were more certain of their\n\nchoice, with six in 10 saying they had definitely made up their minds, compared\n\nwith 46 percent of the likely Republican voters.\n\nDespite the smorgasbord of choices,\n\nlikely voters do not appear terribly enamored with their candidate options.\n\nOf the leading contenders to replace Davis, only Bustamante and Uebberoth are\n\nseen in a largely positive light, though only half of likely voters indicated\n\nthey knew enough about Ueberroth to make a decision. Others are even lesser\n\nknown or, in the case of Flynt, Huffington and Simon, are seen in mostly negative\n\nterms.\n\nSchwarzenegger has a mixed image\n\namong likely voters, with 46 percent saying they have a favorable impression\n\nof the action-movie star and 44 percent saying they have a negative impression.\n\nMuch of his campaign strategy is\n\nbased on his cross-over appeal to non-Republican voters, given his comparatively\n\nmoderate positions on issues such as gun control, abortion and gay rights. But\n\nless than two weeks into his first run for elected office, Schwarzenegger has\n\nalready become a politically polarizing figure.\n\nRoughly seven in 10 likely Democratic\n\nvoters have an unfavorable impression of Schwarzenegger, while the same number\n\nof likely Republican voters expressed a favorable view.\n\nThe actor won the support of 39\n\npercent of likely Republican voters, 20 percent of independents and 7 percent\n\nof Democrats. McClintock received 21 percent of the Republican vote, Simon received\n\n12 percent and Ueberroth 10 percent.\n\nOverall, 50 percent of likely voters\n\nsee Schwarzenegger as a political moderate. Twenty-seven percent view him as\n\na conservative, 11 percent as a liberal and the remainder were not certain or\n\ndeclined to say.\n\nThe survey suggested that for all\n\nthe novelty of the campaign and the unconventional backgrounds of many of those\n\nrunning, no candidate has yet captured the imagination of California voters.\n\n(End of published text\n\nBustamante, serving his second term\n\nas lieutenant governor, is vying to become the first Hispanic elected governor\n\nin California in modern times. He is pursuing a dual strategy, urging a ''no''\n\nvote on the recall question but also asking voters to support him in the event\n\nDavis is thrown out of office.\n\nAsked if Bustamante's candidacy\n\nmade them more likely to go the polls on Oct. 7, an overwhelmingly majority\n\nof likely voters - including Democrats - said it did not. Even his fellow Hispanics\n\nwere not dramatically more inspired: 75 percent said Bustamante's running made\n\nthem no more likely to take part on the recall vote.\n\nOverall, the lieutenant governor\n\nwon 65 percent of the Democratic vote and the backing of one in five independent\n\nvoters and 8 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe survey found Bustamante winning\n\nthe support of 51 percent of likely Hispanic voters, followed by McClintock\n\nwith 13 percent and Schwarzenegger at 12percent.\n\nAmong union members, a crucial part\n\nof the Democratic Party base, Bustamante was receiving 39 percent support, with\n\nSchwarzenegger at 18 percent and McClintock at 15percent.\n\nAs with Bustamante, for all the\n\nstar power Schwarzenegger brings to the race, he has not made voters notably\n\nmore inclined to take part in the recall election. Seven in 10 likely voters\n\nsurveyed said the actor's run made no difference in their intentions to vote,\n\na finding that was constant across party lines and regardless of political philosophy.\n\nThe poll suggested that Schwarzenegger,\n\nwho Wednesday launched the first paid advertising of the recall campaign, still\n\nhas a selling job to do with many voters who doubt his credibility as a potential\n\ngovernor.\n\nOne such skeptic was Linda Lackey,\n\na 55-year-old insurance agent in Downey.\n\n''He may care about certain things,\n\nhe may care about children and stuff, but he really has no background in this\n\ntype of thing,'' Lackey said in a follow-up interview. ''And he's very quiet\n\nabout what he actually thinks and what he plans on doing. He doesn't put his\n\nideas out well.''\n\nSchwarzenegger has made his political\n\nnewcomer status a central part of his campaign, vowing to ''clean house'' in\n\nSacramento if elected. But that promise is met with widespread skepticism: Nearly\n\nsix in 10 likely voters predicted ''politics as usual'' if Schwarzenegger becomes\n\ngovernor, while just about a third said they expected he could rein in the power\n\nof ''special interest groups.''\n\nJill Darling Richardson, associate\n\ndirector of the Times Poll, and Claudia Vaughn, the poll's data management supervisor,\n\ncontributed to this report.\n\nMore inside\n\n* HISTORY: Background on Bustamante,\n\nSchwarzenegger. -- Page A3\n\n* ENERGY CRISIS: Davis had little\n\ncontrol. -- Page A5"
