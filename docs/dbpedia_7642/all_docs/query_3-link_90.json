        "text": "First came stories about groping, group sex and marijuana. Then an allegation of admiring words for Hitler. The steady stream of reports about Arnold Schwarzenegger's past raises a challenging question for all American voters -- how much should they forgive and forget?\n\nMany prominent politicians have been compelled in recent years to admit to marital infidelity, yet still managed to stay in office. Others -- voluntarily, or under varying degrees of duress -- have acknowledged using marijuana.\n\nIn the case of Schwarzenegger, a strong contender to be elected California governor if Gray Davis is recalled next Tuesday, no political track record exists to balance against the reported indiscretions. Voters' views of his personal past could weigh heavily in the recall outcome.\n\n\"I would want to give him the benefit of the doubt,\" said the Rev. Stephen Bouman, a New York-based bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. \"If we're looking at 1975, I wouldn't want to be held accountable for everything I did, either.\"\n\nEarlier in the recall campaign, Schwarzenegger acknowledged that he had smoked marijuana; this week, news reports said six women accused him of groping and sexually harassing them in incidents from 1975 to 2000, and that he spoke admiringly of Hitler in a 1975 interview.\n\nSchwarzenegger said he recalled no such comments about Hitler; he acknowledged doing \"things that were not right\" on freewheeling movie sets and pledged to work for women as governor.\n\n\"What bothers me isn't morality per se, but leaders who think they can run roughshod over everyone,\" Bouman said. \"Does he have a sense of entitlement -- 'I can do what I want, touch what I want, whenever I want.' Does this have anything to do with his ability to lead, to listen to others?\"\n\nNicol Rae, a political science professor at Florida International University, said specific political circumstances dictate the extent of the public's tolerance and forgiveness.\n\n\"President Clinton's problems (with Monica Lewinsky) would have been a whole lot more serious had the economy been in the tank,\" Rae said. \"If this stuff about Schwarzenegger doesn't have much of an impact, maybe it's an indication Californians are keen to get rid of Gray Davis.\"\n\nAs for Schwarzenegger's reported comments about Hitler, Rae drew a parallel with Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.\n\n\"Early in his career, Byrd was a member of the Ku Klux Klan,\" Rae noted. \"It's not held against him. Everybody reveres him now.\"\n\nSome conservative groups that emphasize morality and family values have suggested that Schwarzenegger, a moderate Republican, deserves forgiveness. Others have condemned him harshly and urged their supporters to vote instead for Tom McClintock, who has a long record as a conservative GOP officeholder.\n\n\"What someone does outside elected office does matter,\" said Randy Thomasson, executive director of Campaign for California Families. \"Bill Clinton was wrong for having oral sex with an intern, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is wrong for fondling women.\"\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Center, said a key question, in Schwarzenegger's case, was whether he sincerely repented.\n\n\"It's good to be forgiving, but the question is whether the activity continues,\" Perkins said. \"There needs to be a recognition that the activity was wrong.\"\n\nDecrying the prevalence of personal attacks in politics, Perkins said he would prefer that opposition to Schwarzenegger focus more on his moderate stances regarding abortion and gay rights.\n\nAnother prominent conservative, Janice Crouse of the Beverly LaHaye Institute, said a candidate's sexual behavior should definitely be considered a relevant issue for voters.\n\n\"I want to know how recent was the latest episode -- is it something that has continued since he was married?\" she said of Schwarzenegger. \"If it's behavior when he was not married, when he was new to this country, and young and foolish, it should not be a disqualifier for voting for him.\"\n\nIn the context of the other reported indiscretions, Schwarzenegger's admission of past marijuana use has drawn little scrutiny.\n\n\"In general, voters have become relatively accepting, and politicians are relatively willing to acknowledge marijuana in the relatively distant past,\" said Bruce Mirkin of the Marijuana Policy Project. \"What almost nobody is willing to go near, so we don't know what the voter reaction would be, is to talk about having used it recently.\""
