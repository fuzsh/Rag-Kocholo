        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger surged ahead of the recall pack last weekin one category: music.\n\nThebodybuilder-turned-Hollywood-actor-turned-candidate-for-governorhas selected a campaign theme song: Twisted Sister’s “We’re NotGonna Take It.”\n\nThe choice was a natural one, campaign officials said. Thecampaign had been using the song to introduce Schwarzenegger atevents since August. Twisted Sister lead vocalist Dee Snider plansto perform it at a campaign event this afternoon in Sacramento.\n\n“It is a fabulous song, like a theme song for our campaign,”Schwarzenegger said. “People really connect to it.”\n\nBut that hardly seems fair. No candidate should be able tocorner the market on campaign theme songs. So I asked colleagues atthe North County Times to come up with some theme-song ideas forother candidates. Here’s what they came up with.\n\nFor Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who first vowed to stayoff the replacement ballot, then jumped into the middle of therecall fray: “Back Stabbers,” that catchy 1970s O’Jays tune.\n\nFor embattled Gov. Gray Davis, who wanted all major Democrats tostay off the ballot and who continues to refuse to endorseBustamante: The Monkees’ “I’m Not Your Stepping Stone.”\n\nFor state Sen. Tom McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, who thumbs hisnose at GOP insiders who suggest he get out of Schwarzenegger’s wayso Republicans don’t split their vote: “I Did It My Way” by FrankSinatra.\n\nFor independent Arianna Huffington, who dropped out last week:The theme from the “Green Acres” television show. “I always confuseher with Eva Gabor,” says NCT staffer Gary Warth.\n\nFor Green Party candidate Peter Camejo: “It’s Not Easy BeingGreen,” of Kermit the Frog fame.\n\nAnd for skin-magazine publisher Larry Flynt: “The Hustle.”\n\nWho’s right?\n\nTuesday’s election will not only decide whether Davis remains inoffice and who will replace him if he does not, it may determinewho’s the most accurate pollster.\n\nThe Field Poll, Public Policy Institute of California and LosAngeles Times Poll have been saying that about 55 percent of likelyCalifornia voters plan to vote to boot out the governor.\n\nThen along came CNN/USA Today/Gallup last weekend, predictingDavis will be blown out by a 63 percent to 35 percent margin on therecall question.\n\nGallup also reported that Schwarzenegger received such a hugebounce from the Sept. 24 televised debate that he may trounceBustamante by 15 percentage points — even with McClintocksplitting the GOP vote.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres flatly rejectedthe Gallup numbers as “phony.”\n\n“The Gallup polls of only 581 likely (voters) included a bias of49.2 percent Republicans among likely voters in a turnout of 51percent,” Torres said. “No other poll has showed a Republican(share of the) turnout of anywhere near 49.2 percent.”\n\nRepublicans make up 35 percent of all California registeredvoters, and most pollsters predict that GOP voters will comprisebetween 39 percent and 42 percent of the group that votes thisElection Day, he said.\n\nHowever, any way one slices the electorate pie, it doesn’t lookgood for Davis.\n\nDavis calls Arnold a wimp\n\nDavis, seeing the election morphing into a two-man race,challenged the muscle-bound actor to a debate last week.Schwarzenegger refused.\n\n“I don’t know what Mr. Schwarzenegger is afraid of,” Davis said.”I mean, I never participated in a Mr. Universe contest. I weighmaybe 165 pounds on a good day. I’m ready to go to him toe-to-toe,but he seems to be the one on the run.”\n\nMcClintock said he’d gladly accept an invitation to debate. Nothanks, said Davis.\n\nLabor unites with green\n\nDuncan McFetridge, the influential San Diego County backcountryconservationist, picked up an endorsement for his Rural LandsInitiative last week from an unlikely source: The 120,000-memberSan Diego-Imperial Counties Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO.\n\nThe connection between the anti-urban-sprawl initiative andlabor?\n\n“Sprawl development usually uses less skilled workers anddoesn’t pay livable wages and benefits,” said Allen Shur, businessrepresentative for the International Brotherhood of ElectricalWorkers, Local 569, who voted to back the initiative.\n\nThe measure, which is likely to make the March 2004 ballot,essentially would draw an urban growth boundary similar toPortland, Ore.’s around the 18 San Diego County cities, restrictingurban-style development on about 700,000 acres of backcountryforest and farmland. Developers would have to appeal directly tovoters countywide for permission to build on rural lands."
