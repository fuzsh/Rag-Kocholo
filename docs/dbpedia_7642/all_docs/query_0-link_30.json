        "text": "Elections\n\n1992\n\nAfter redistricting, State Assemblyman McClintock decided to retire in order to challenge Democratic U.S. Congressman Anthony C. Beilenson in California's 24th congressional district. He won the nine-candidate Republican primary with a plurality of 34% of the vote, beating second-place finisher Sang Korman by eleven percentage points. Beilenson defeated McClintock 56–39%.\n\n2008\n\nOn March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in California's 4th congressional district, which was hundreds of miles away from the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district's nine-term incumbent, fellow Republican John Doolittle, decided to retire. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election. Although for most of the year he lived in Elk Grove, a suburb of Sacramento which was within the 3rd district at the time, his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, within the borders of his state senate district. The California Constitution requires state senators to maintain their legal residence within the district they represent.\n\nUpon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans Rico Oller and Eric Egland withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed McClintock. McClintock was endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus, Club for Growth, and U.S. Congressman Ron Paul. McClintock faced former U.S. Congressman Doug Ose, a moderate represented the neighboring 3rd District from 1999 to 2005. Like McClintock, Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a carpetbagger and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose 54–39%.\n\nThe Democratic nominee was retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charlie Brown, who ran an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving payments totaling over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the state senate even though he lived in Elk Grove for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his State Senate district. He stated, \"Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here.\" However, Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock does not own or rent a home in the 19th district, but claimed his mother's home in Thousand Oaks as his state senate district residence. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stays with his mother in order to better care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband. McClintock ran ads attacking Brown's participation at a 2005 protest by Code Pink, an infamous anti-war group, and argued Brown supported gay marriage but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBy November 23, 2008, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.4% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from El Dorado County shortly after Thanksgiving. On December 1, 2008, McClintock declared victory and on December 3, 2008, Brown conceded the race. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes. He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in Placer County, the largest county in the district. Brown won just three of the district's nine counties: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%). Ultimately, McClintock won mainly on the strength of coattails from John McCain, who carried the 4th with 54 percent of the vote, his fifth-best total in the state.\n\n2010\n\nMcClintock was challenged in the Republican primary again, this time by Michael Babich. He easily defeated Babich 78–22%. On November 2, he easily won re-election to a second term, defeating businessman Clint Curtis 61–31%, winning all of the counties in the district.\n\n2012\n\nRedistricting pushed the 4th well to the south. It now stretched from the Sacramento suburbs to the outer suburbs of Fresno. Only three counties remained from the old 4th: Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado. However, it is as strongly Republican as its predecessor.\n\nHe easily won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Jack Uppal 61–39%. He won all but two of the district's ten counties: Nevada (37%) and Alpine (41%).\n\n2014\n\nMcClintock won re-election, finishing first in California's \"top two\" primary, and defeating moderate Republican challenger, National Guard Major Art Moore in the general election, 60–40%.\n\n2016\n\nMcClintock again finished first in the primary and subsequently defeated Democrat Robert W. Derlet, a physician, environmentalist and retired UC Davis professor, in the general election, 63–37%.\n\n2018\n\nMcClintock defeated his Democratic challenger Jessica Morse in the general election, receiving 184,401 votes to her 156,253 (54.1% to 45.9%).\n\nTenure\n\nDuring the 112th Congress McClintock was one of 40 \"staunch\" members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills. In 2011, McClintock voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. McClintock's Chief of Staff, Igor Birman, was a candidate for Congress in California's 7th congressional district in 2014.\n\nIn 2009, McClintock signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.\n\nMcClintock voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He voted against the first version of the bill, displeased with the removal of deductions related to medical expenses, student loan interest and casualty loss. Those three items were addressed in the final version of the bill which McClintock voted 'yay'. McClintock claims the bill will \"restore American workers to an internationally competitive position.\" He has expressed concern regarding the bill's impact on the budget deficit and anticipates that it will be addressed \"by spending reforms this coming year.\"\n\nIn 2017, McClintock voted against the repeal of Obamacare budget.\n\nIn 2017, McClintock called for special prosecutor Mueller against President Trump. McClintock felt that the firing of Comey justified the special prosecutor.\n\nAfter President Trump pulled 1,000 U.S. troops from Kurdish-held territory on the Syrian border south of Turkey in 2019, a bipartisan resolution was passed in the House, 354-60, that condemned the president for abandoning those U.S. allies that would allow the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to reestablish and regroup its forces, and allow the Turks to attack the Kurds. McClintock was one of the two from the 53-member California congressional delegation to vote against it.\n\nIn 2020, McClintock was the sole House Republican to cosponsor the Ending Qualified Immunity Act, which was proposed in response to the police killing of George Floyd and the widespread protests it spawned. The Act was introduced by Justin Amash (L-MI) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and cosponsored by 62 House Democrats in addition to McClintock. Because primary sponsor Amash was a registered Libertarian as of the Act's introduction in June 2020, McClintock's support technically made the Act the first tripartisan piece of federal legislation in modern U.S. history.\n\nLegislation\n\nMcClintock supported the Water Rights Protection Act, a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. The bill was a reaction to the United States Forest Service's decision to pursue a \"new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands.\" McClintock supported the bill, saying that the Forest Service's regulation \"illustrates an increasingly hostile attitude by this agency toward those who make productive use of our vast national forests, in this case by enhancing and attracting the tourism upon which our mountain communities depend.\"\n\nFor his five terms in office, McClintock was the primary sponsor of three bills that were enacted into law.On June 14, 2013, McClintock introduced the bill To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to take certain Federal lands located in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the benefit of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians (H.R. 2388; 113th Congress), a bill that would take specified federal land in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians.The other two bills were to rename Post Offices.(H.R. 3892 and H.R. 3319).\n\nCommittee assignments\n\nCommittee on the Judiciary\n\nCommittee on Natural Resources\n\nSubcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs\n\nSubcommittee on Federal Lands\n\nSubcommittee on Water and Power\n\nCaucus memberships"
