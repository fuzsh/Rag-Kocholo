Please search your name as it appears on your drivers license or voter ID by clicking here.\n\nHow do you properly fill out a mail in ballot?Watch this video to see each step necessary to vote by mail and ensure your vote counts.\n\nCan I view a sample ballot?\n\nYes, sample ballots are viewable by clicking here.\n\nCan I vote by mail?\n\nYes. Voters can apply for an absentee ballot or mail-in ballot for October 29th. Voters who wish to vote by mail should apply as soon as possible; should apply online through PA Department of State instead of on a paper application; and should consider returning their voted ballots in person to the Board of Elections.\n\nCan I cancel my permanent absentee status or permanent mail-in status?\n\nYes. The voter needs to complete a Request to Cancel Permanent Status form that is available on the Board of Election website or by contacting Voter Services to request it by mail.\n\nWhen will I receive my absentee ballot or mail-in ballot?\n\nVoters who wish to vote by absentee or mail-in ballot are encouraged to apply now, but should expect to wait until late April or early May to receive the ballot. Ballots cannot be mailed until after they are designed and tested, and after PA Department of State has certified the final content of the ballot to the counties. Please consider that contacting the Board of Elections regarding the status of your absentee or mail-in ballot detracts from our staff’s processing time."
