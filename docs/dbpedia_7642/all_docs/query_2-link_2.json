        "text": "Newspaper: Aides dispute records\n\nNORWALK, California (CNN) -- The most talked-about candidate hoping to become California's next governor hasn't voted in a presidential election in a decade -- when the elder George Bush, Bill Clinton and H. Ross Perot were on the ballot.\n\nThat's according to voting records on actor-turned politician Arnold Schwarzenegger from the Los Angeles County Registrar's Office.\n\nThe records show that in the 1996 and 2000 general elections Schwarzenegger requested absentee ballots, but never returned them. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that aides to the candidate said he had turned in the absentee ballots and are investigating what happened.\n\nIn the 1992 general election, he did vote, although the records do not indicate for which candidate.\n\nHis record in non-presidential years is better.\n\nHe voted in both the 2002 general election and primary. In 1998, he did not vote in the primary, but did vote in the general election. And in 1994, he voted in both the primary and general election.\n\nSchwarzenegger did campaign actively in 1988 for former President Bush, the last Republican president to win California.\n\nBut while the current President Bush has scheduled no campaign appearances for Schwarzenegger, he has said he thought he would make a good governor.\n\nMore than just Schwarzenegger's voting record is being examined since he announced he's running.\n\nGeorge Butler, who produced and directed the documentary, \"Pumping Iron\" which featured Schwarzenegger during his bodybuilding days, considers the Republican actor his friend. He said the Austrian-born naturalized American citizen is one of the most ambitious people he's ever met. (Full story)\n\nBut there will be many other choices for voters in California's colorful, confusing and potentially costly gubernatorial recall race.\n\nThe Secretary of State's office is scheduled to release a certified list of candidates by the close of business Wednesday. (Full story)\n\nCNN Producer Justine Redman contributed to this report.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
