        "text": "About the Project\n\nThe USC Center for Inclusive Democracy and the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy are partnering to strengthen American democracy by providing proven tools and direct assistance to ensure that the right to vote is protected and practiced.\n\nBoth idealistic and practical, this nonpartisan project provides (1) mapping tools to equitably site polling places and ballot drop boxes, (2) an innovative ballot return tool that tracks ballots cast in real time at the local level, and (3) direct assistance to local election officials that increases their frontline resources for elections. To date, all three have been proven to improve access to the polls – particularly for those who have historically faced obstacles to voting. When combined and expanded to additional states, we expect these efforts will dramatically strengthen our democracy.\n\nVoting Location Siting Tool\n\nThe non-partisan USC Center for Inclusive Democracy, formerly the California Civic Engagement Project, has developed a new Voting Location Siting Tool to help election officials and communities identify accessible and equitable U.S. voting locations for the upcoming November 2020 General Election.\n\nThis data-driven mapping tool is particularly important, given the logistical challenges currently faced by elections officials due to the coronavirus health pandemic. These challenges include likely shifts in voting behaviors related to social distancing and government implemented shutdowns, more limited poll worker availability, and the critical need to assure poll accessibility by diverse and underserved voting populations.\n\nFirst launched in California during the 2018 primary election cycle, the tool is now being made available in 10 states that represent 43% of the U.S. population:\n\nArizona\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nFlorida\n\nGeorgia\n\nMichigan\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTexas\n\nWisconsin\n\nThis fall, the Siting Tool will launch in four additional states: Ohio, Hawaii, Virginia and Nevada.\n\nHow does the Tool work?\n\nThe Voting Location Siting Tool uses a web-based interactive data mapping system to identify areas within a half\n\nmile in diameter where vote centers and polling places would likely have the most success in serving voters,\n\nespecially harder-to-reach underserved voting populations. Areas are identified through a facility allocation\n\nmodel that incorporates local demographic and historical voting data, which can then be customized based on\n\nspecific local needs.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using the Tool?\n\nBy using data-driven decision making, the Voting Location Siting Tool takes the guesswork out of locating polling\n\nsites and voting centers. It provides election officials a range of siting options that help assure impartial access\n\nto the ballot box for all in the community. In addition, the Tool provides a uniquely transparent and nonpartisan way of voting site selection that the public can readily understand.\n\nWhat has been the experience of those using the Tool?\n\nThe success of the Voting Location Siting Tool has been noted by many registrars and voter advocacy groups\n\nworking toward the accessible and equitable siting and implementation of voting locations. Read their testimonials\n\nto learn more.\n\nBallot Return Tool\n\nDeveloped by the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID) at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, the Ballot Return Tool is a first-of-its-kind, data-driven interactive mapping resource for visualizing early ballots cast in real time by registered voters during an election, whether the voting is done inperson or by mail.\n\nUsing publicly available voter data, the web-based Ballot Return Tool produces visualized data maps of early ballots cast by registered voters at the county or precinct level. The technology allows users to increasingly pinpoint community-level voting activities by hovering or zooming in on a particular area or neighborhood. CID updates the maps daily as voting data is made available.\n\nFirst introduced in Los Angeles County during the 2020 General Election, the Ballot Return Tool provides election officials, community advocacy groups and the general public a better way to track voting and transparently monitor voting activity, as well as plan voter services and outreach. The Tool was most recently rolled out in the state of Georgia to assist election officials and community groups there involved in voter outreach for the January 2021 U.S. Senate runoff elections.\n\nThe Ballot Return Tool is one of two web-based applications offered by CID to help election officials and voting advocates plan election-related decision making and outreach. The CID Voting Location Siting Tool—a web-based interactive data mapping system initially launched in California in 2018—is now available in 10 states. The Siting Tool helps communities identify accessible vote centers and polling places likely to have the most success serving voters. Its robust and detailed data maps have also been widely used to inform voter outreach efforts at the community level.\n\nDemocracy Funding Toolkits\n\nIn 2020, the USC Schwarzenegger Institute provided direct monetary grants to local election administration in eight states with histories of voter discrimination. The funding opened 1,047 election day polling places and set up 258 in-person early voting polling places or ballot drop boxes. Grants also supported the hiring of poll workers, implementation of COVID measures, and extended hours at polls. For example, Gwinnett County in Georgia received $100,000 for PPE and hazard pay for poll workers. In rural Appalachian counties in North Carolina, new polling places in remote parts of the mountain counties were opened.\n\nAs a result, voter turnout increased. Funded counties experienced a 6.3%-point increase in voter turnout (compared to 4.50% for unfunded counties).\n\nThis initiative is based on the success of the Democracy Grants. But, instead of a cash infusion, we will provide robust tools and support training for election administrators and community groups to advocate for increased budgets from county and state funding sources. This will be a long-term solution with lasting impact on future elections.\n\nDemocracy Grants Initiative\n\nOn September 23rd, 2020, the Schwarzenegger Institute launched the Democracy Grants for Voting Access & Election Administration. See below for the note from our Chairman Arnold Schwarzenegger announcing the launch:\n\nDear elections officials and good government organizations,\n\nThe United States gave me everything I have, and I believe it is my duty to repay the kindness of this country every day of my life. Everything I achieved – my bodybuilding success, my movie roles, my investments, my governorship, my family – would have been impossible anywhere but America.\n\nI’ve read news stories about over a thousand polling locations closing around the country, even before the pandemic, and I’ve seen over and over that these closures are based on a lack of funding. As a former Governor who had to make a lot of cuts I didn’t like, I completely understand the dilemmas of a budget crunch.\n\nAs someone who has been a fanatic about voting since I became a citizen in 1983, I want every American to have equal access to the right to vote – yes, even the people who voted against me! As I read stories about counties that only have one voting location for hundreds of square miles and people who wait in line for four hours to vote, I started thinking about this more and more and realized the solution is easy. If you have a budget problem that keeps you from reopening polling stations, I want to help. I made millions because of this country, and spending my money to help my fellow Americans vote is the least I can do.\n\nI am making grants available for local and state elections officials who want to reopen polling stations they closed because of a lack of funding. These grants are completely non-partisan and will be offered to those who demonstrate the greatest need and ability to close gaps in voting access. I don’t care if you are an independent authority, a Democratic elections official, or a Republican elections official – I just don’t want a single American to lose their ability to vote because of a lack of funding. I think this could be one of the best investments I have ever made.\n\nYou can apply for the grants right now, and we will be getting the money out as fast as possible. I know the next month is crucial for setting up this infrastructure, so please apply as soon as you can. You can fill out the form here: https://www.pollingaccessgrants.org. We will get back to you within a week.\n\nThank you for your consideration. I hope this can be a win for all of the fantastic citizens of our country.\n\nSincerely,\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger\n\nGrant Recipients\n\nCameron County, Texas – Funding to support the opening of polling super centers, curbside voting and early voting\n\nDouglas County, Georgia – Funding to support advanced/early and Election Day poll workers in order to operate polling sites\n\nSurry County, North Carolina – Funding to support the hiring of one-stop and Election Day poll workers in order to operate polling sites\n\nWarren County, North Carolina – Funding to support hiring one-stop and Election Day poll workers in order to operate polling sites\n\nBarnwell County, South Carolina – Funding to support additional poll workers\n\nMuscogee County, Georgia – Funding to support in-person advance/early voting polling sites, in-person election day voting sites, PPE, and hiring new poll workers\n\nNelson County, Virginia – Funding to support election day polling sites\n\nYoung County, Texas – Funding to support poll workers\n\nHertford County, North Carolina – Funding to support polling sites and PPE at polling sites\n\nChatham County, Georgia – Funding to support hiring new poll workers, PPE for polling sites, and space for polling sites\n\nCraig County, Virginia – Funding to support 38 election day and absentee processing workers and other support for polling sites\n\nGwinnett County, Georgia – Funding to support additional hazard pay for additional poll workers\n\nHinds County, Mississippi – Funding to support poll workers at election day polling sites and PPE\n\nLamar County, Georgia – Funding to double the number of ballot drop boxes from 1 to 2\n\nRichmond County, Virginia – Funding to support changes to polling sites to speed check-in and shorten lines\n\nBuchanan County, Virginia – Funding to support polling sites and PPE for poll workers\n\nColleton County, South Carolina – Funding to support hazard pay for new poll workers and polling site locations\n\nJames City County, Virginia – Funding to support hiring more poll workers to increase voter access\n\nPerry County, Alabama – Funding to open 4 new COVID-safe portable polling sites\n\nTaliaferro County, Georgia – Funding to support PPE for poll workers and polling site locations\n\nWythe County, Virginia – Funding to support polling sites for increasing voter access\n\nClayton County, Georgia – Funding to open 7 new election day polling places.
