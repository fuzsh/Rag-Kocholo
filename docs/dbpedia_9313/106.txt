Gregory E. Davis, 73, of Boise, Idaho passed away July 22, 2023 after a courageous battle with cancer.

Greg was kind, funny, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. His quick wit endeared him to anyone with whom he spoke, long-time acquaintances and strangers alike. He never forgot a person’s name and would happily share his time with anyone willing to share theirs. These gifts, coupled with his seemingly inexhaustible work ethic, made him an excellent husband, father, salesman, and friend.

Greg enjoyed the outdoors; he appreciated fishing and hunting across Idaho, relaxing at the Oregon coast, and tending to his beloved backyard garden and flowerbeds throughout his life. He loved music…real music with actual instruments (as he would say). Greg had an immense love for sports, particularly basketball, which he enjoyed playing and watching. The NCAA tournament was always a favorite event for him to attend with friends whenever possible.

Most of all, Greg enjoyed the simple times with friends and family. He delighted in taking his granddaughters to Yen Ching for dinner, to Ben & Jerry’s for ice cream, and to Zoo Boise and swimming pools for extra fun. His love, care, and dedication to family was boundless, and certainly anyone who spoke with him heard about them within the first few minutes of conversation.

Greg is preceded in death by his mother and father. He is survived by his wife of forty-seven years, brother and sister-in-law, nieces, son, daughter and son-in-law, and granddaughters.

Greg’s surviving family members are extremely grateful for the compassionate care Greg received from St. Luke’s Meridian Cancer Infusion Center, St. Luke’s Meridian Oncology, thoughtful friends, neighbors, and relatives throughout his treatment.
