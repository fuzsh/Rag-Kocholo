        "text": "Gregory Daniel Davies ( DAY-viss; born 14 May 1968) is a Welsh comedian, actor, presenter, and writer. He is best known for his roles as Mr Gilbert in The Inbetweeners (2008-2010), Ken Thompson in Cuckoo (2012-2019), Dan Davies in Man Down (2013-2017) and Paul \"Wicky\" Wickstead in The Cleaner (from 2021). Since 2015 he has hosted the comedy panel game show Taskmaster and he has also appeared on Mock the Week, Fast and Loose, Live at the Apollo and Would I Lie to You?\n\nFor his performance in Cuckoo, Davies was nominated for the BAFTA Television Award for Best Male Comedy Performance in 2013.\n\nEarly life\n\nGregory Daniel Davies was born in St Asaph, Flintshire, Wales, on 14 May 1968. His Welsh parents lived in England at the time, but his father drove his mother across the border to make sure he was born in Wales, so that he would be eligible to play rugby for the Wales national team. He grew up in Wem, Shropshire, which he regards as his home. His father's origins lie in Porthmadog. In a 2017 edition of BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? he discovered that he is descended from Owain the Great.\n\nDavies was educated at Thomas Adams School in Wem, before studying drama and English at Brunel University, graduating in 1990. Prior to embarking on a career in comedy, he taught drama for 13 years at a number of secondary schools: Langleywood School in Slough, Orleans Park School in Twickenham, and Sandhurst School in Sandhurst.\n\nCareer\n\nTelevision\n\nIn 2003 Davies made an appearance on the children's TV show Dick & Dom in da Bungalow, playing a caricatured version of himself named \"Massive Greg\".\n\nIn 2005 Davies played a caricature of cricketer W.

The classroom used in the show is the same classroom in which Davies taught at Sandhurst School.\n\nSince July 2015 Davies has been the host of the panel game show Taskmaster. In December 2015, he starred in BBC Two's comedy drama A Gert Lush Christmas where he played Tony, the uncle of Russell and Kerry Howard's characters.

The show was subsequently taken on his first ever tour the following autumn.
