        "text": "For media inquiries, please contact Jared MacDonald at jared.macdonald@wku.edu.\n\nBennie Purcell USTA Kentucky Coach of the Year\n\nTOPSYs Co-Head Coach of the Year\n\nCareer head coaching record of 320-182 (.637)\n\n4x National Coach of the Year\n\n3 National Titles\n\nThe 2023-24 season was the sixth for Greg Davis at the helm of the WKU Women's Tennis program. He was named the eighth head coach of the Lady Topper Tennis program on June 26, 2018. He boasts a 320-182 all-time record in his collegiate head coaching career since 1999.\n\nDavis has led WKU to its winningest three-year stretch in program history, with 47 wins over that period. That includes a 30-12 record at home over the last three seasons, which is also the best mark in program history. Davis' teams now hold the No. 2, 3, and 4 spots in program history for wins in a season, and he is fifth in program history in coaching wins with 63.\n\nThe Lady Toppers that Davis has coached during his six seasons have their names scattered throughout the program record book. Davis has had five players finish in the program's top 10 in career singles wins, with four in the top five, including Rachel Hermanova, who broke the program career singles wins record in a match at Samford on March 22, 2024. Davis also has had five players finish in the top five in singles wins in a season. That includes Hermanova, who holds the record with 19 wins in 2022 and is also tied for second with Sofia Blanco for their 18 wins in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The top seven spots on WKU's career doubles wins record list belong to Davis' players, with Samantha Martinez leading the pack with 56. Eleven of the top 15 spots on WKU's single-season doubles wins list belong to Davis' players. Martinez and Blanco hold the record with 17 doubles wins in 2022.\n\nWKU posted a 14-11 record during the 2024 season. The 14 wins are tied for the fourth-most in a season in program history, while the 11 wins the Lady Toppers claimed at home were the second-most in program history and marked only the second time the program has won double-digit contests at home in a season. WKU recorded a program-long eight-match home winning streak during the campaign. The Lady Toppers were the No. 5 seed in the Conference USA Championship, which was the highest seed ever for the program in the event, and the team played in the quarterfinals for the first time since the 2018 season. Following the season, Blanco was named All-CUSA Singles Second Team, marking the program's first All-CUSA selection since the 2018 season.\n\nDavis' teams had posted two of the program's three winningest seasons the two years prior. In 2022, the Lady Toppers came two wins shy of tying the program's single-season win record with a 18-9 mark – the 1984-85 team posted 20 wins. In 2023, WKU went 15-11, marking the third-most wins in a single season in program history. That year, the team beat No. 69 North Texas 4-1 for the program's first-ever win over a ranked opponent.\n\nWKU started the 2022 campaign 5-0 for its best start ever, then won nine of its last 11 including the final five of the regular season. The Lady Toppers also went 2-1 in Conference USA play, recording their first winning record in league action since 2016-17. WKU went 12-4 in home matches in the 2022 season, increasing their home slate significantly through a partnership with the Warren County Tennis Facility at Michael O. Buchanon Park.\n\nThe Lady Toppers have also succeeded in the classroom and been named a Intercollegiate Tennis Association All-Academic Team in each of the last four seasons leading up to 2024. At least five Lady Toppers have been honored in each of the last three years as Scholar-Athletes with grade-point averages over 3.5.\n\nDavis came to WKU from Walden on Lake Houston where he served as Director of Tennis and Assistant Director of Junior Tennis for the past seven years at the Houston City Club.\n\nPrior to his tennis leadership in the Houston area, Davis was the head men’s tennis coach for three years (2007-10) at Lamar University. In his final season, the Cardinals posted the second winningest season in 28 years with 13 wins and featured a nationally ranked top-10 doubles tandem.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007, Davis was the head coach of the women’s tennis team at Louisville. Over the course of five seasons, Davis directed the team through its transition from Conference USA to the Big East while compiling a record of 99-48. That still ranks as the most wins in a five-year span for the Louisville program. He coached multiple All-Conference student athletes and led the team to its highest national ranking in program history at the time, No. 50 on the Intercollegiate Coaches Association Poll.\n\nDuring his time as head coach of men’s and women’s tennis at Auburn University Montgomery, Davis was named the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Men’s Coach of the Year and NAIA Men’s Tennis Coach of the Year in 2002 as well as the NAIA Women’s Tennis Coach of the Year in 2000 and 2001. He coached the men’s team to an NAIA National Team Title in 2002 and the women’s team to the same championship in 2001 and 2000. His men’s 2002 squad was also named an ITA Academic All-American Team with a GPA of 3.6.\n\nBefore becoming a head coach, Davis was an assistant men’s tennis coach for Rice, Wake Forest, and Northwestern between 1994 and 1999. He helped coach the Northwestern and Wake Forest teams to the NCAA Tournament in 1999 and 1998, respectively.\n\nAs a collegiate tennis player himself, Davis played at Kankakee Community College in 1989 and 1990 before transferring to IUPUI to finish his career. In his senior year in 1992, he was a team captain and played both singles and doubles for the Jaguars."
