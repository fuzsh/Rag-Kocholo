        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nGreg Davis, Jr.\n\nTitle\n\nRunning Backs Coach\n\nGreg Davis, Jr. enters his sixth season as Tulane[apos]s running backs coach in 2005 with a full stable of running backs featuring a pair of players who tied for the Green Wave team lead in rushing a year ago. A year after the departure of Tulane and C-USA career rushing leader Mewelde Moore, who set 24 school records during his career and is now a running back with the Minnesota Vikings, Davis and the Green Wave offense turned to Jovon Jackson and Matt Forté in 2004. The duo combined for 1,248 rushing yards, nine TDS, and 309 receiving yards. Jackson and Forté return in 2005 along with Ray Boudreaux, Ade Tuyo, and freshman Christian Ducré. In his additional role as coach of the Green Wave specialists, Davis returns the league[apos]s top punter in junior Chris Beckman, a first-team all-league choice who has averaged more than 43 yards per punt during his career. Davis also sent Tulane all-time leading scorer Seth Marler to the NFL in 2003. Marler kicked for the Jacksonville Jaguars as a rookie that season after winning the Lou Groza Award as the nation[apos]s best kicker in 2001. Davis came to Tulane from Alabama A&M, where he coached quarterbacks in 1999. He spent the 1998 season at the University of Texas as a quality control coach. In his year at Texas, the Longhorns won the Cotton Bowl. At North Carolina in 1996 and [apos]97, Davis worked with the defensive backs on a pair of Gator Bowl championship squads. Davis[apos] name is familiar to Tulane fans as his father, Greg Davis Sr., is a former Green Wave head coach (1988-91) and is currently the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Texas. A 1989 graduate of Grace King High School in Metairie, La., Davis attended Nicholls State University, where he was a student assistant coach. Upon graduating from NSU in 1994, he went to Southeast Missouri State University, where he spent two years coaching the wide receivers and kickers. A member of the AFCA, Davis is married to the former Karen Erbelding, of Johnson Bayou, La. The couple has two daughters, Taylor Amanda (3), and Kaylen Dawn, born in April 2005.\n\nPersonal\n\nFamily: Wife, the former Karen Erbelding; Daughters, Grant Taylor (3) and Kaylen (infant).\n\nPlaying Experience\n\nTulane (1987-88)\n\nCoaching Experience\n\n2000- Tulane 1999 Alabama A&M 1998 Texas 1996-97 North Carolina 1994-95 Southeast Missouri 1992-93 Nicholls State\n\nBowl Experience\n\nCOACH\n\n2002 Hawai[apos]i\n\n1998 Cotton\n\n1997 Gator\n\n1996 Gator"
