        "text": "At the Books' first-ever concert in Boston, the sold-out crowd was visibly excited-- in some cases literally shaking. People grabbed their stubs back from the tickettakers at the door; four art students sitting in the row behind me made someone take their photo. For about 30 minutes before the start of the show, the back third of the theater was inexplicably roped off, as if the venue had to restrict how many Books fans could be in the room at once. What were we going to do, go so berzerk when they played that we would start frothing digits, or singing to our iPods, or chewing on our cell phones?\n\nNobody knew what to expect. The Books were on the first week of their first tour, with only one other show-- an appearance at the Chicago Third Coast Festival in 2003-- under their belts. It was hard to guess how they would translate their seamless edits and manipulations onto a stage, and with a band that had already grown so much from record to record, anything could happen in concert.\n\nThe Books came to town in the middle of the two-week Boston Cyberarts Festival of interactive and multimedia art. And if you believe the scathing review of the Festival that just ran in The New York Times, the bar had been set fairly low for the Books to make one of the best statements on mixing handmade and digital art. Instead of ending up at one of the usual sticky-floored bars in Central Square, they landed the amphitheater at the Museum of Fine Arts-- a large, pristine white room with a handful of tacky cherub statues nailed to the wall and a video screen at the back of the stage. The opening duo, Greg Davis and Keith Fullerton Whitman, had laid out two tables cluttered with laptops, sine wave generators, pedals, and small percussion instruments, but stage right the Books had a simple layout of a few violins and a keyboard.\n\nDavis and Whitman played a set of nuanced, sustained drones that filled the theater like digital mouths opening and closing, accompanied by two videos, including a hypnotizing stop-action tour film constructed by Whitman. They left us in a serene state with our minds cranked open like lotuses, or at least tulips. But between sets, the mood broke as people got up and chatted or hit the can, and when the Books showed up, they ambled on stage casually like a pick-up band at a hootenanny: the all-American-looking Nick Zammuto, followed by the taller Paul de Jong, who looks like, well, a gangly European cello player. They were joined by guest singer and multi-instrumentalist Anne Doerner, who dressed like she'd spent the day hauling lobster traps. Someone plugged in an instrument and triggered a loud \"POP\" that shook the room: Doerner joked, \"That's just to clear your ears out a little bit.\"\n\nThe Books produce their albums cleanly and even serenely, but live, they stomped and snorted. The acoustic instruments almost cast them as a folk band, but right from the start they were joined by their sampler-- from extra percussion and found sound to the acoustic guitar loop that doubled Zammuto on \"That Right Ain't Shit\". The electronics were an equal member of the band. Instead of adding extra color or a polite complement, the loops were as cranked and raucous as the rest of the musicians. If the humans played one song without accompaniment-- Doerner singing a slow, swollen French Creole ballad-- the gear got its own solo features, like a video clip where a sampled voice repeated the word \"meditation\" over and over while a series of slides rearranged the letters (\"do it in meat,\" \"I tamed Toni\").\n\nThe setlist covered all three albums, and their recent, less-warmly received Lost and Safe, came to life on stage-- partly thanks to Doerner's vocals. But they threw in new songs and extra material, like a song written by Nick's brother Mikey, a.k.a. \"Mikey Bass,\" who came on halfway through the set to play bass guitar. Sometimes they acted like they'd settled on a genre: anywhere else, Doerner's ballad might have sounded sentimental, as if Djimon Hounsou from In America was about to walk on stage and cry, \"Give us our freedom\"; the \"meditation\" video wasn't far from being a Blue Man Group routine; and the home videos that they screened behind Mikey's number show the simpler, sentimental side that sweetens the band's experiments and that crops up in gestures like the peace symbol embedded in their latest album cover.\n\nBut by threading all of those ideas and more into the same performance, the Books ducked all labels. In Cyberarts (or at least cyberhype) speak, they are disruptive and transformative. Their erratic wordplay makes sense in a country where we take for granted that our politics and culture run on doublespeak, and the easy shifts between the live and the prerecorded stayed intriguing because the on-stage and off-stage players never defined their roles. The Books don't bring a message so much as a process, and the music sounds sweet not because it lacks tension, but because every note feels like it's taking you somewhere new.\n\nAnd for all their playfulness, the strongest number was \"Be Good to Them Always\", where de Jong amplified his cello almost to the point of pain. He bowed the melody like he was performing a Caesarian, and his urgency underscored the found speech clips that run through the piece: \"I can hear a collective rumbling in America.\" The song could be political, or it could be about anything, or it could just be for laughs. Anything is possible."
