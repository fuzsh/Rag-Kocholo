This guitar-playing journeyman has played from Wildwood to Japan and with such local Philly icons as Kenn Kweder, Beru Revue, David Uosikkinen of The Hooters as well as gigging solo, in duos and trios for the past 30 years.\n\n“I have a burning desire to play music. I figured out a way to get out there and play,” said the Swarthmore music man who just finished a gig at World Cafe Live that featured a Philly all-star line-up including Jeffrey Gaines, Tommy Conwell and the Soul Survivors playing Uosikkinen’s “In the Pocket” series of Philly originals.\n\nDavis caught the music bug at an early age. “I got a guitar at eight-years-old and my first paid gig – a bar mitzvah – at 11. It was just a guitar and drums. We played all original music.”\n\nThe burgeoning guitarist improved his licks by studying with noted South Philadelphia guitar teachers Pat Martino and Joe Sgro. After high school, Davis attended the prestigious Berklee School of Music in Boston.\n\nIt was a summer gig in Wildwood at a club called the Oceanic that prevented Davis from returning for his third year of college. “It was a steady gig in the summer of ’79 and I never got back,” recalled Davis. “I’ve come a full 30-year circle. For the last six summers I’ve been playing weekends at the Pier 6600 Hotel in Wildwood Crest.”\n\nStraight from Wildwood, Davis headed to South Street where he became part of the seminal local music scene of the early 80s. He was recruited by Kweder to be one of the Secret Kidds.\n\n“Basically I saw an extremely gifted and fully developed artist at the very young age of 21,” said Kweder, who will perform with Davis and the Men from WAWA at the Tin Angel on Nov. 21. “[He’s] as dead serious about music as some zealots can be about the bible. Charisma and lightning in a bottle, all wrapped up in one.”\n\nKweder and the Secret Kidds played the clubs and cabarets in Philadelphia as well as in New Hope, Brandywine, Emerald City in New Jersey…anywhere within a 50 mile radius of the city. They also got local radio play. “The club scene was pretty healthy in Philly. It was a great time for making music…so much fun and energy,” remembered Davis.\n\nBob Beru was the events manager for the band and after a successful two-year run, Kweder’s band basically morphed into Beru Revue. Davis became best known as the guitar player in Beru’s theatrical rock review that entertained Philly music fans throughout the 80s.\n\n“I met Greg in 1978 when I was working with Kenn Kweder. Kenn refreshed the Secret Kidds with a new kid on the scene from the Berklee Music School. Even at that time Greg could turn your head with his playing,” said Beru who considers Davis a good friend.\n\n“When I thought of taking a stab at performing, Greg was the first person to sit down and take me seriously. ‘King of England’ was the first of many collaborations.”\n\nAlthough well versed in rock, Davis brought what Beru calls “a classically trained appreciation of jazz and fusion” to his guitar playing.\n\nNewly-appointed WMMR mid-day man Pierre Robert caught Beru’s act at the East Street Cafe in Upper Darby and instantly became a rabid fan and promoter for the band. “He fell in love with the band and got WMMR on our side,” said Davis. “We went from playing before 60 people to 600.”\n\nDavis continued to play with Kweder and Beru Revue and host what has become known as “the longest running jam session in the city” at JC Dobbs.\n\nDavis played in the house band known as the Last Minute Jam Band that jammed every the Tuesday night at the venerable Dobbs from 1986 to 1996. Scores of area and national musicians would show up week after week to play with Davis on guitar, Wally Smith on keyboards, Michael Radcliffe on bass and George Manney on drums.\n\n“It was a place where musicians would hang out and some would play,” said Manney, who made a documentary of those heady days called “Meet Me on South Street” which is archived at the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.\n\n“Members of Yes and Bon Jovi would hang out and players included Ace Frehley from Kiss, Spencer Davis, members of Cinderella and Robert Plant’s touring band. Although we never missed a Tuesday night, one night in 1989 we started an hour later so Nirvana could play. This was right before ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ came out.”\n\nIn the latter part of the 90s, Davis ended up playing a long term gig in Nagoya, Japan. “I went from playing the Atlantic City circuit to playing a gig in Japan. Two months turned into six years,” recalled Davis. “I played mostly cover songs at the Hotel Hilton in Nagoya in a band called Christina and the Americats.”\n\nDavis returned to the area and rekindled old musical friendships. He continues to play with Kweder, Beru and Uosikkinen. It’s a fraternity of rockers he’s proud to be a part of.\n\n“It’s a friendly conglomerate of musicians. There’s a lot of water under the bridge between us all. I’ve really gotten to know the guys more,” Davis said.\n\nDavis continues to ply his trade in his own band reincarnations such as Cross Town Traffic and the Greg Davis Trio. He’s released his first solo CD called “Parallel Universe” featuring five original tunes with Ronny Crawford of The Daves and Lisa Loeb fame on drums, the ubiquitous Chico Huff on bass, and longtime Dobbs compadre Wally Smith on keyboards.\n\nThese days he’s happy to be teaching and playing guitar professionally.\n\n“I’m thankful to make a living and raise a family playing music. And I’m still excited about making music.”\n\nBeru Revu plays “One More Time” at World Cafe Live Saturday, Nov. 17, 8:00 pm\n\nKenn Kweder and the Men from WaWa Play the Tin Angel, Wednesday, November 21\n\nVisit:\n\nwww.berurevue.uc\n\nwww.kennkweder.com\n\nwww.gregdavisguitar.com\n\nOriginally Published: November 6, 2012 at 10:00 p.m."
