        "meta_description": "Ku by Greg Davis &amp; Jeph Jerman, released 30 June 2006\n\n1. First Strata\n2. Second Strata\n3. Third Strata\n\nThe act of conjuring remarkable sound from found objects is at the\r\nvery heart of this recording from American musicians Greg Davis and\r\nJeph Jerman. Having met in Arizona some years back, Davis and\r\nJerman commenced working together on a series of recording\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nImprovising with a range of implements and devices ranging from\r\nsticks, stones and low-fi electronics to prepared instruments, gongs\r\nand broken percussion, the pair sought to develop a personal\r\nlanguage that reflected their individual approaches but also created\r\na shared sensibility and aesthetic quality. Placing their work in a range\r\nof environments, most of which orbit around Jerman’s ranch in\r\nCottonwood, Davis and Jerman create a richly textured array of\r\nsounds from the most modest of sonic tools.\r\n\r\nEach of the works featured here collects together multiple improvised\r\nsessions, which have been edited to create a flowing sense of\r\nmovement and space. These tempered post-concréte works resolve a\r\njoint interest from these two musicians in the act of freeform found\r\nsound improvisation and experimentation.",
