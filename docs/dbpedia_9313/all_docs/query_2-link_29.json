Concert therapy is here after Greg Davies saw the perfect opportunity to use his lockdown to create the album he has always wanted to release.\n\nPre-Save Here – Release Date: 31st August\n\nThe idea formed from a need to invite the best musicians associated with Greg himself and join him on a guitar driven, instrumental ride! For those of you who love the works of Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Frank Zappa and Jeff Beck, there is no holding back as Greg Davies includes many genres within this release. We’re talking rock, funk and blues, to metal, country and even dance! Each song showcases the talents of all the different players on the album and the musicianship is really quite something at certain points! One more thing, play it loud!\n\nGreg Davies is a rock musician based outside of Manchester UK. Greg has been playing the guitar since the age of 12 and has been performing on the UK music scene for over 20 years. Having played in a series of bands as well doing regular session work across the UK and Europe, Greg Davies recently released an EP ‘A Different Order’ with the band ‘Elements‘ which has been successful on UK rock charts.\n\nIn the last 10 years Greg Davies has performed alongside some of the best guitarists & musicians the UK has to offer including Guthrie Govan, Andy James and Alex Hutchings. As well as his work as a recording artist and performer Greg Davies is a well respected music teacher and music therapist who runs a business called ‘Access Music’. No doubt we will see Greg Davies on the live circuit again but for now, we’re excited to see this release follow his recent rock chart success!\n\nSupport Greg Davies on Social Media – Facebook | Instagram\n\nListen to more of Greg Davies – Soundcloud"
