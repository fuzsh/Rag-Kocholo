        "text": "The final of Taskmaster is upon us and we can't wait to see whether Joanne McNally, John Robins, Nick Mohammed, Sophie Willan or Steve Pemberton will scoop the final trophy.\n\nAlthough the contestants of the show are always changing, we can always count on Greg Davies and Alex Horne and their bemused responses to the antics of the stars. But how much do you know about host Greg's love life away from cameras?\n\nFind out if the funnyman is married and if he has children here...\n\nGreg's relationship status\n\nGreg tends to keep his personal life private. And while he is not married, we do know that he previously dated Labour party politician Liz Kendall, who is the party's Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, between 2007 and 2015.\n\nAt the time, Liz told The Mirror: \"I am not going to be the sort of politician who does all that stuff about their private life because it's very precious to me and really important to me that I have that space that’s personal and just to me. We are not together any more but we remain really good friends.\"\n\nGreg is currently believed to be single and the comedian previously joked that he had \"given up\" on romance during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show. During the chat, he revealed that his grandad had unwittingly walked on him and a girlfriend during a risqué moment. He joked: \"It's not for me, romance... that was the day I gave up on romance.\"\n\nHe also revealed to The Times that an ex-girlfriend convinced him to switch from a teacher to a career in comedy, explaining: \"I've been doing comedy for about 15 years now. I always wanted to do it, I just never had thick enough skin. A girlfriend I had while teaching was a pragmatist and always told me that if you want to do something then go for it. So eventually I made the switch. Comedy is definitely where I'm happiest.\"\n\nGreg's family life\n\nWhile Greg is known for portraying protective father Ken in the sitcom Cuckoo,the actor himself does not have any children. He does, however, have lots of experience looking after kids as he was a secondary school drama and English teacher for 13 years before moving into comedy.\n\nDISCOVER: Where is the Taskmaster house located?"
