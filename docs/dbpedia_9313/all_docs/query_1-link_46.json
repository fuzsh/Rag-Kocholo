        "text": "Many words have been used to describe the tenure of Greg Lovelady as head coach at Wright State--unprecedented, never before, first time ever. Yes, these words are all true, but it didn't happen over night.\n\nGreg Lovelady was named as the fifth head baseball coach in Wright State history on August 28, 2013.\n\n2016 was a memorable year for Raider Baseball fans as Wright State won a school record 46 games and its second straight Horizon League tournament title. Lovelady and his staff of Justin Parker, Jeff Mercer and Matt Talarico led their team to its second straight NCAA Regional Final in Louisville, falling to the #2 ranked and host Cardinals 3-1. Along the way, WSU posted a 7-3 win over Ohio State.\n\nAlong with being named the Horizon League Coach of the Year for the second time, Lovelady was also selected as the ABCA/Diamond Mideast Regional Coach of the Year.\n\nEight Raiders were honored with Horizon League postseason awards, including the Freshman of the Year in Caleb Sampen, who was later named to the Louisville Slugger All-American Freshman Team. Senior Jesse Scholtens, who made history by pitching the first perfect game in WSU history at Dayton on March 11, was chosen First Team All-Horizon League and First Team ABCA/Rawlings All-Mideast Region while senior outfielder Ryan Fucci was also named First Team All-Horizon League and Third Team ABCA/Rawlings All-Mideast Region.\n\nTo cap the 2016 season, five, yes five, Raiders were selected by the Major League Baseball Draft over a three-day period. Catcher Sean Murphy went to the Oakland A's in the third round followed by Scholtens to the San Diego Padres in the ninth round, shortstop Mitch Roman to the Chicago White Sox in the 12th round, pitcher Robby Sexton to the Boston Red Sox in the 14th round and Fucci to the Seattle Mariners in the 25th round.\n\nIn 2015, Lovelady guided the Raiders to new heights as Wright State won a then-record 43 games and advanced to the NCAA regional finals against host Illinois after beating Ohio and Notre Dame. 11 Raiders were honored by the Horizon League, including Andrew Elliott being named Relief Pitcher of the Year and Gabe Snyder selected as the Freshman of the Year. Elliott was later drafted by the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nHis first season at the helm paid dividends as he guided the Raiders to a 35-22, 25-4 record and the Horizon League regular-season title. 10 Raiders received postseason honors, including Lovelady, who was named the Horizon League Coach of the Year as his squad set a new record for wins in league play. In all, the Horizon League honored WSU with 10 Players of the Week throughout the season.\n\nMore honors came in after the season as Andrew Elliott was named Third Team All-American by ABCA as well as First Team All Mideast. Sean Murphy was chosen as a Freshman All-American by Louisville Slugger. Michael Timm received accolades as well, being named to the All-Mideast Second Team, CoSIDA District Academic All American and to the Horizon League Spring Academic Team. In June, Travis Hissong signed a contract with the New York Yankees.\n\nAlong with his success with the Raiders, Lovelady has also been involved with USA Baseball, including a lead role in the tryout phase for the 14U team that won a gold medal in Mexico in 2015 and for the 15U team in 2016.\n\nBefore being named head coach, Lovelady was on Rob Cooper's staff for nine seasons, the final seven as associate head coach. Lovelady served as the pitching coach and worked with the catchers while off the field, he was the recruiting coordinator for the program, helping WSU to NCAA Tournaments in 2006, 2009 and 2011.\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, career win #250 came for the duo of Cooper and Lovelady at UIC on April 22 in the form of a 4-3 decision. The Raiders also posted the program's second-longest winning streak ever as the Raiders reeled off 14 straight victories during March and April, outscored their opponents 185-67 in the process. Also, during that stretch, WSU took home the Joe Nuxhall Classic title for the first time. Two pitchers were honored with Horizon League honors as Michael Schum was selected as the Relief Pitcher of the Year and Jordan Marker was voted to the HL's second-team.\n\nThe 2011 season saw head coach Rob Cooper record his 200th coaching victory with an 8-2 decision at home over Youngstown State on March 26. That season also saw Jake Hibberd become his fourth Horizon League Player of the Year, Michael Schum pick up his second HL Relief Pitcher of the Year and Corey Davis named the second League Newcomer of the Year under Cooper and Lovelady. Early-season wins over The Citadel and West Virginia helped catapult the Raiders to a sixth-straight 30-win season.\n\nThe 2010 season saw the Raiders win 30 or more games for the fifth straight year. Sophomore pitcher Casey Henn earn First Team All-Horizon League honors as he posted a 7-0 record with a league-leading 3.19 earned run average and 82 strikeouts in 84.2 innings while holding the opposition to a league-best .241 batting average. Senior pitcher Alex Kaminsky was named to the Second Team after winning five games with 88 strikeouts while senior catcher Gerald Ogrinc was selected to the First Team after throwing out 16 of 26 base stealers and recording five pickoffs to lead the league.\n\n2009 saw freshman Michael Schum receive the Horizon League's Relief Pitcher of the Year award after leading the conference with a 1.95 ERA and 13 saves, striking out 57 in 74 innings. Schum was also named to the Second Team and the All-Newcomer Team.\n\nIn 2008, Lovelady led a pitching staff that saw Jon Durket earn First Team All-Horizon League honors. As a staff, Wright State ranked second in wins and led the Horizon League in Fewest Hits Allowed. Durket led the league in ERA and Alex Kaminsky led the league in wins and opponents batting average against.\n\nIn 2007, the Raiders boasted the most wins in the Horizon League (36) and held the second best team ERA. The Green and Gold boasted only the sixth pitcher in WSU history to win 10+ games in a season, Kyle Kearcher, and compiled the seventh highest win total in school history. The Green and Gold also set the school standard for league wins in a season with 21 victories.\n\nIn 2006, the Raiders pitching staff set a new school mark for pickoffs in a season (28) and came within 1/3 of an inning of breaking the school mark for innings pitched in a season. The Green and Gold own a team ERA of 5.14 over the past three seasons and have won 94 games in that span.\n\nLovelady has also started to shape his pitchers and catchers into major league form. Relief pitcher Joe Smith opted to leave WSU after a spectacular junior season and was taken with the 93rd overall pick in the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft by the New York Mets organization. Smith made his Major League debut on April 1, 2007, in St. Louis.\n\nLovelady came to WSU after a successful playing career and three-year stint with one of the nation's elite teams in Miami (FL). The Hurricanes won two national championships, in 1999 and 2001, with Lovelady as the catcher. A four-year letterman for the 'Canes, Lovelady captained the 2001 squad that won its second national championship in three years.\n\nLovelady hit a career best .314 with a 14-game hitting streak during his 1999 campaign. Lovelady was also a fan favorite in Coral Gables, receiving the Arnold Novins Award in 2001, an honor bestowed on the \"Most Popular Player\" as voted by the fans of Miami. The 'Canes made a postseason appearance during each of Lovelady's years as a player and coach in Coral Gables. UM Reached the College World Series five times and advanced to the NCAA super regional seven times while Lovelady was on campus.\n\nLovelady graduated from Miami in 2001 with a degree in Finance and a minor in Sports Management as a member of the university's deans list. Professionally, Lovelady played with the Utica Blue Sox, an affiliate of the Florida Marlins, and helped develop two UM catchers and numerous pitchers into major league draft choices.\n\nLovelady and his wife Lindsay have two sons, Noah Preston, who was born on December 16, 2008, and Gavin Philip, born on June 10, 2012."
