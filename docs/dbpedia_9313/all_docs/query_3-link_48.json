        "text": "GREG DAVIS\n\nGreg Davis is an internationally recognized electronic musician & composer who has been releasing music and performing since 2001. Davis has released albums on labels such as Important, Kranky, Ekhein, Room40, Install, Home Normal, Digitalis, NNA, Greyfade, Carpark Records, as well on his own Autumn Records.\n\nDavis’s music draws from a wide variety of sources, including guitar, field recording, various world/ethnic/traditional instruments, percussion, and voice, all processed through digital manipulation. Davis moved toward computer-based music in 1997, after years of experience in hip-hop groups, jazz combos, free improvisation, and experimental composition. He studied classical and jazz guitar alongside composition at Depaul University in Chicago.\n\nDavis moved to Boston in 1999 to pursue a master's degree in composition while independently immersing himself in the study of electronic music. Since 2001, he has played shows all around the world, collaborating with Keith Fullerton Whitman, Ben Vida, Sebastien Roux, Chris Weisman, Steven Hess, Jeph Jerman, Akron/Family, Toby Aronson (as Harmonizer), and Zach Wallace (as Sun Circle)."
