        "text": "Greg Davis\n\nJul 23, 1960 -\n\nJan 19, 2023\n\nHe is really gone this time. Greg Davis, 62, passed away Thursday morning, Jan. 19, 2023, in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nAfter a rich life and successful career, Greg demonstrated an unusual ability to cheat death over the past few years with several serious non-COVID-19 related health issues. He bounced back each time with a zest for life and love of family and friends giving everyone hope for a long, fun-filled future. Thursday morning was a different situation. While successfully recuperating from routine surgery intended to put him back on the road to good health, his fight for life suddenly ended.\n\nGreg was born in San Jose, Calif., on July 23, 1960, to Patricia Howie and Bob Davis as the middle child. He is survived by two brothers, Gary and Mike. As a child of California in the 1970s and 80s, Greg learned the value of hard work as it relates to good times. He obtained his journeyman electrical license and applied his energy and talent to a variety of positions until landing in Kuparuk as an electrician at CPF1.\n\nAlong the way, he spent time as a guide on the world-famous Kenai River. Greg was a very talented fisherman. He would say whatever he wanted, regardless of gender or political persuasion, often using very colorful language, while leaving everyone laughing. His ability to speak his mind and deliver very clear, concise feedback is legendary.\n\nHis success and happiness took on extra special meaning in 1998 when Greg and Terry Davis became husband and wife. Their partnership was strong from the beginning and continued to thrive into the 21st century.\n\nGreg embraced his life experiences and was always ready for the next adventure. With a heavy heart, we share the obituary for our friend, taken before his time. Instead of offering a moment of silence, let's all come together and celebrate the fact that, while Greg did not live as long as he should have, he knew how to make the most of the time he was given. May we all strive to become the cheeseburger, pizza and steak connoisseur that he defined.\n\nGreg touched the lives of many, loved actively, hugged aggressively and taught us all how to do the same. He was an inspiration that enjoyed laughing at himself and loved laughing at the rest of us. His unwavering enthusiasm for his Sharks, 49ers and Giants will remain with his friends forever.\n\nGreg was everyone's best friend and coincidentally everyone would agree that they thought they were his best friend â€¦ and they are all correct. Greg connected with people genuinely and authentically. We will all miss him and understand that the trite expression \"he is in a better place\" might apply to this situation. Beaver Creek will not be the same without him and we all have a Greg-shaped void in our hearts.\n\nThe family wishes to extend their gratitude to the devoted staff of the Central Peninsula Hospital and Providence Healthcare for their care, kindness and support."
