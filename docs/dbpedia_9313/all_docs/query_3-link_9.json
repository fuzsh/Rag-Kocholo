        "text": "Greg Davis is the second longest tenured and second winningest head coach in the history of the Northeast Mississippi Community College football program.\n\nDavis, who trails only multi-time hall of famer W.B. “Bill” Ward in both those categories, was selected as Northeast’s 14th headman in 2015. He begins his 13th year overall on the Tigers’ staff in 2024.\n\nNortheast is coming off a second consecutive winning season and its third in four years. The Tigers went 6-3 and finished at No. 19 in the final national ranking from JCGridiron.\n\nThe Tigers boasted the top tackler in the country in Keaton Thomas, who was a consensus first-team All-American and signed with Baylor (Texas) University. CJ Barney, Jermaine Ray, RJ Whitehead and Jalik Yancey joined Thomas as JCGridiron All-Americans.\n\nTriston Newson led a defensive unit in 2022 that allowed the fewest yards per game in the state. The University of Missouri signee obtained National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) honors with more than 100 tackles.\n\nThe Tigers pieced together one of their best seasons ever in 2020 after claiming the Mississippi Association of Community Colleges Conference (MACCC) North Division runner-up spot with a 5-1 record.\n\nNortheast was awarded with a national ranking of No. 13 from JCGridiron at the conclusion of the 2020-21 academic year. It is the second final top 15 rating for the Tigers under Davis with the first coming in 2016.\n\nThe Tigers tied for the most individual All-MACCC recipients that season with 14. Northeast also garnered seven Fall All-America honorees from JCGridiron, including defensive backs Keyshawn Cobb, Deantre Prince and Tony Washington; defensive linemen Jamal Ellis and Cedric Hillsman; offensive lineman Will Derico; quarterback Kevin Hurley and linebacker Jamarcus Smith.\n\nThe aforementioned 2016 campaign was just as special. The Tigers went 6-3, including a sweep of its opponents from the MACCC South Division, and ascended into the top 10 of the NJCAA poll.\n\nNine of Davis’ former Tigers have signed professional contracts. That includes seven – Joe Horn, Jr., of the Baltimore Ravens, Xavier Malone of the Atlanta Falcons, Antonio Moultrie of the Green Bay Packers, Daniel Ross and Prince of the Jacksonville Jaguars, Anthony Rush of the Tennessee Titans and Sam Williams of the Dallas Cowboys – in the National Football League (NFL).\n\nPrince is Northeast’s most recent NFL Draft Selection. The lockdown corner was taken in the fifth round with pick number 153 by the Jaguars in 2024.\n\nWilliams was the 56th overall pick in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Cowboys. He is the fifth draft pick in school history and the first since Michael Boireau in 2000.\n\nWilliams became one of the most decorated athletes in school history after receiving NJCAA Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2018. He accumulated 75 takedowns, 28.5 tackles for loss and 17.5 sacks during his sophomore campaign with the Tigers.\n\nMore than 100 Northeast standouts have advanced to the four-year level since Davis took command of the program, including Power Four signees Reginald Hughes, Brenden Williams, Williams and Prince to the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss); Ethan Smart to Purdue (Ind.) University and Andison Coby to Indiana University.\n\nNortheast has also placed an emphasis on academics with Davis at the helm. The Tigers have boasted seven College Sports Communicators (CSC) Academic All-America® selections in four years, including Guy Gillespie, Ben Mauney, Carter Putt, Barney, Thomas and Smith twice.\n\nThe Tigers have received 84 Academic All-MACCC accolades in Davis’ nine seasons. Northeast has also secured 37 NJCAA Academic Student-Athlete Awards in that same span, including two-time winners Carson Banks, Tommy Branyan, John Daniel Deaton, Cameron Dill, JT Moore, Cedrick Wilder, Jr., Barney, Gillespie, Mauney, Putt and Smith.\n\nDavis made his way to Booneville in 2012 after serving at Kentucky State University for two years. As the assistant head coach, offensive coordinator and offensive line coach for the Thorobreds, he helped lead a pair of running backs in Anthony Boykins and Shannon Frieson to 1,000-yard seasons in 2009.\n\nWhile serving in Frankfort, Ky., Davis was chosen to attend the 2011 NFL and NCAA Football Academy at Disney's Boardwalk Inn. He learned how to improve and reinforce various aspects of managing and excelling at various coaching positions at the collegiate level.\n\nBefore his stretch at Kentucky State, Davis was part of Sul Ross State (Texas) University's staff where he held the titles of offensive line coach and offensive coordinator as well. Davis preceded his stint with the Lobos by spending a pair of seasons in Arkadelphia, Ark., at Henderson State University.\n\nIt was during his time as the Reddies' offensive line coach that Davis made a name for himself. He had four linemen selected to the NCAA Division II All-Southeast Region Team, three elected to the All-Gulf South Conference (GSC) Team and one tabbed as an All-American.\n\nHenderson State's Kurt Kutscher was also a finalist for the 2007 Gene Upshaw Award, which is given to the best offensive lineman in NCAA Division II, under the direction of Davis.\n\nDuring the 2004-05 seasons, Davis was at Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC) member Upper Iowa University. Before becoming a Peacock, Davis was the offensive line coach and strength coordinator at Muskogee, Okla., based Bacone College.\n\nHe began his coaching career at Stephen F. Austin State (Texas) University. Davis then moved to Independence (Kan.) Community College where he served in multiple roles, including assistant head coach, run game coordinator and offensive line coach.\n\nHe starred on the gridiron at Texas Christian University (TCU) in the mid-1990s. Davis participated in the 1994 Independence Bowl and was named to the 1998 All-Sun Bowl Team after guiding the Horned Frogs to a 28-19 victory over the University of Southern California.\n\nDavis signed with the practice squad of the NFL’s New York Giants following his senior campaign in 1999. He then returned to the Lone Star State and inked with the Arena Football League's (AFL) Houston Thunder Bears.\n\nHe saw action on both sides of the pigskin at center, nose guard and long snapper for the Thunder Bears. Davis made seven tackles and forced one fumble for Houston from 2000-01.\n\nDavis has a Bachelor’s degree from TCU and a Master’s degree from Stephen F. Austin. He and his wife Karri, who served for three years as Northeast’s cheerleading coach, have two sons, Reed and Rece."
