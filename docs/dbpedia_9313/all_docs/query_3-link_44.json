No matter how simple or complex your condition, Dr. Davis treats all his patients with considerable care, kindness, and respect.\n\nDr. Davis has also been the recipient of several awards for excellence in patient care, including the “Top Doc” Award from Seattle Met Magazine for the years 2011-2019, Seattle Magazine from 2019-2022, Castle Connolly Top Doc Awards, the American Academy of Otolaryngology’s “Honors Award”, and the “Patient Top Choice” Award from Vitals.com.\n\nHe is a physician, educator, and co-director of the American Rhinologic Society’s Summer Sinus Symposium. He also co-directs the annual Seattle Otology and Advanced Rhinology Course. Dr. Davis is on the Board of Directors for the ARS. He is also a past-president of the Northwest Academy of Otolaryngology. Over the years, he has given numerous national and international lectures on improving medical and surgical treatment of sinus disorders.\n\nDr. Davis is married and has two adult children. He enjoys traveling, skiing, scuba diving, hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering, and camping."
