        "text": "Greg Davies is back on-screen for a new series of the hit comedy panel show tonight.\n\nThe 55-year-old funnyman, co-host of Taskmaster, is thought to have never married or had children - but he has spoken about his love life in interviews. The star, who rose to fame as Mr Gilbert in The Inbetweeners, revealed one girlfriend provided the encouragement he needed to make the switch from a steady teaching career to trying to make his name in the comedy world.\n\nAnother romance was understood to be with a Labour MP and Greg also had a huge crush on a popstar's mum. This evening, the comedian will be joined by Alex Horne to judge a whole new lineup of contenders, including Joanne McNally, John Robins, Nick Mohammed, Sophie Willan and Steve Pemberton, who will battle it out to become the 17th Taskmaster champion.\n\nAmid the new series, The Mirror takes a look at the ups and downs of Greg's complicated love life...\n\nSupportive ex-girlfriend\n\nDuring an interview with The Times, Greg revealed that an ex-girlfriend encouraged him to take a leap of faith and pursue comedy in his early 30s, after more than a decade of teaching. Greg, who is originally from the small Welsh city of St Asaph, revealed: \"I've been doing comedy for about 15 years now. I always wanted to do it, I just never had thick enough skin.\n\n\"A girlfriend I had while teaching was a pragmatist and always told me that if you want to do something then go for it. So eventually I made the switch. Comedy is definitely where I'm happiest.\"\n\n'Terrible crush' on Blue Peter star\n\nDuring an interview with OK! magazine, Greg admitted that he had quite the crush on former Blue Peter star Janet Ellis, who also happens to be the mother of popstar Sophie Ellie Bextor. Unfortunately, a chance encounter at a chip shop didn't quite go quite as smoothly as he'd hoped.\n\nMortified Greg recalled: \"I met Janet Ellis once in a fish and chip shop. I used to have a terrible crush on her, all throughout my childhood. Then I finally met her and said something humiliating, I think chips-based, that guaranteed I would never end up in the relationship I craved.\" He added: \"I met her daughter Sophie on a show once and told her I fancied her mum and she rolled her eyes and said 'everyone does'.\"\n\nLabour politician ex\n\nIt's understood that the 6ft 8in funnyman was previously involved with Labour MP and current Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Liz Kendall. The pair were together for several years but called it a day in 2015, just a few weeks before the general election.\n\nSpeaking with the Mirror at the time, Liz said: \"I am not going to be the sort of politician who does all that stuff about their private life. It's very precious to me and really important I have that space that's personal and just to me.\" She went on to clarify: \"We are not together anymore but we remain really good friends.\""
