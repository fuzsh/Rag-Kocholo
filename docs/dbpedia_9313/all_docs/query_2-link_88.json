        "text": "Greg is a singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His competence as a professional was demonstrated when he toured Europe as Bassist with ‘Micheal J Sheehy and the Hired Mourners’ in 2009. Greg began teaching in 2010 at CCP working alongside Malaki Patterson helping young musicians to succeed. Greg was introduced to George Moorey around the same time. Greg was encouraged to grow as a musician, providing workshops at Pittville School, Wychwood 2010, End Of The Road 2010, WIRED Summer Sound 2010 and Cheltenham Music Seminar 2011. Greg studied with Music Leader at Colston Hall in Bristol, is a qualified member of Youth Music Network and teaches Guitar, Bass and Singing at Pittville School. Greg is available for private lessons in Cheltenham.\n\n\"Greg has learnt through having an open mind and continues to learn through experience, of which he has a vast amount for his age.\" George Moorey (WIRED Records)\n\n“Greg worked for us on the 2010 Teenage Rampage project. He coordinated the Gloucester heat of the tour and did a fantastic job from start to finish. Greg went well beyond what we had requested. We were impressed that he maintained contact with all concerned. I recommend Greg highly.” Matt Booth (BMF Bristol Music Foundation)\n\n“I have used Greg a number of times as both a session bass player and songwriter. I was very impressed with his performance on sessions. He was punctual and a very solid player as well as being a great source of creative ideas when appropriate. I would use Greg again without a second thought.\" Brendan Davies (Modern World Studios)\n\n\"Greg is a multi-instrumentalist and a musician with integrity, he is cool and level headed under pressure, has a wonderful personality. He works well as a team player but also has great integrity as a soloist. It has been a pleasure to know and to work with him.\" Ropert McKenzie\n\n\"Exemplary.\" Michael J Sheehy"
