        "text": "Greg Davies is a familiar face on television as the host of Taskmaster, the BAFTA-winning game show, and he has achieved sell out national arena tours as a stand-up. His on-screen breakthrough came in 2008 when he played the head of the sixth form, Mr Gilbert, in the highly successful teenage comedy series the Inbetweeners. He wrote and starred in the black comedy the Cleaner and co-wrote the sitcom Man Down in which he played a man in the grip of a midlife crisis.\n\nGreg was born in St Asaph in north Wales and grew up in Shropshire. At school he gravitated towards what he calls the silly boys who created characters and devised comedy sketches in the playground. When he was 18 he discovered Eddie Murphy whose stand-up routines about his relatives spurred Greg to look to his own family as comedic source material.\n\nGreg spent 13 years as an English and Drama teacher â€“ a time he looks back on with mixed emotions and which he has mined for his stage act. When he was 33 he left teaching and started performing stand-up gigs and performed his first solo stand-up show at the Edinburgh Festival in 2010.\n\nGreg lives in south London.\n\nDISC ONE: Baggy Trousers - Madness\n\nDISC TWO: Wichita Lineman - Glen Campbell\n\nDISC THREE: 100% Endurance - Yard Act\n\nDISC FOUR: Circlesquare - The Wonder Stuff\n\nDISC FIVE: Cemetry Gates - The Smiths\n\nDISC SIX: Consider Yourself - Jack Wild (The Artful Dodger) and The Orchestra, conducted by John Green.
