He was literally a coach on the field and was the main reason we shut out seven teams last year. He reads extremely well and is very quick to the ball. He will probably play at around 225 in college. I think Mike Riley has found a diamond in the rough in Greg. He was overlooked by a lot of people and I think he will be a big time player in college.\""
