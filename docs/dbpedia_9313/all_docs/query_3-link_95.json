We are honored and excited to welcome BACK Dr. Greg Davis of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology!\n\nLast time Dr. Davis was here he absolutely fascinated and captivated our in-person and Zoom audiences! We are so thrilled to have him return to enrapture us all once again with everything that is going on with the Jet Propulsion Lab and space itself!\n\nDr. Gregory Davis has worked for the past 32 years as a member of the technical staff at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, where he is a Principal Technologist. Greg has recently completed an assignment as its Associate Chief Technologist and has held numerous other technology leadership roles there. Greg was also a Lecturer in Aerospace Engineering at Caltech for 10 years. In addition to his work in technology, he has also worked on numerous JPL flight projects including Juno, orbiting Jupiter since July 4, 2016 and 3 Mars landers: Sojourner, Spirit, and Opportunity. Greg’s current interests include R&D work in Computational Mechanics, and flight work on NASA’s Human Landing System and Mars Sample Return projects. He is the recipient of numerous NASA awards, including an Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medal for his work on Mars Pathfinder. Before arriving at JPL, he worked as an exploration geophysicist in Houston, TX and as a high school physics teacher in Stow, OH, both for 5 years. Greg holds a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Rice University, B. S. and M.S. degrees in Physics from the University of Akron, and an EMBA from the Drucker School of Business at Claremont Graduate University. He and his wife Alix live in Granada Hills."
