After playing infamously psychotic Head of Sixth Form 'Mr Gilbert' in \"The Inbetweeners\" (Channel 4) and its two spin off feature films, Greg went on to appear in BBC Three's Cuckoo alongside Andy Samberg and Taylor Lautner, which earned him a BAFTA nomination for Best Male Performance in a Comedy Programme. In 2015 Greg began hosting UKTV's new comedy show \"Taskmaster\". Greg has been on two sell out stand-up tours, most recently \"The Back of My Mum's Head\" in 2013. Greg's debut solo stand up show \"Firing Cheeseballs At A Dog\" was nominated for the prestigious Foster's Edinburgh Comedy Award in 2010. The DVDs of both shows were Top 10 bestsellers.\n\nGreg's TV appearances include hosting \"Would I Lie To You\" (BBC1), \"Never Mind The Buzzcocks\" (BBC Two) and \"Live At The Apollo\" (BBC One). He has also made guest appearances on \"The Royal Variety Show\", \"Room 101\" (BBC One), \"Mock The Week\" (BBC Two), \"Let's Dance For Comic Relief and Sport Relief\" (BBC One), \"The Graham Norton Show\" (BBC One), \"Live At The Apollo\" (BBC One), \"Frank Skinner's Opinionated\" (BBC Two) and \"8 Out Of 10 Cats\" (Channel 4).
