        "text": "WACO, Texas â€” Former University of Iowa offensive coordinator Greg Davis has been selected as the recipient of the 2023 AFCA Outstanding Achievement Award, it was announced Tuesday.\n\nThe AFCA Board of Trustees created the Outstanding Achievement Award to recognize AFCA members, past and present, who have achieved outstanding success while coaching football. Davis will be honored at the AFCA Awards Luncheon on Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, during the annual AFCA Convention in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nDavis began his coaching career at the high school level in 1973 before joining the world of college football in 1978. He ended up spending 43 years in the profession, retiring in 2016. He was a longtime assistant coach at Texas A&M, Tulane, Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Iowa.\n\nDavis was hired in 2012 as the offensive coordinator at Iowa, where he coached until 2016. During his five seasons, the Hawkeyes won 39 games, appeared in four January bowl games, and won the Big Ten West Division in 2015 with a school-record 12 victories.\n\nConsidered by many as one of the best assistant coaches in college football, Davis was a finalist for the Broyles Award in 1999 and won it in 2005 after helping Texas to the national title that season. Throughout his 38 years in college football, Davis coached in 22 bowl games and two BCS national title games."
