        "text": "Greg Walker was named the 10th head coach of the volleyball program in February 2020. Walker is currently the head coach of the U.S. Men's Sitting National Team. Prior to Smith College, he was an assistant volleyball coach at the University of Southern California.\n\nIn his first season of competition at Smith College, Walker led the Pioneers to one of the best season turnarounds in the country. It was its most successful season since 2013, guiding the Pioneers to a tremendous 21-11 record and a post season, NEWMAC Tournament appearance, Smith’s first since the 2013 season. One of the keys to the team’s resurgence was an outstanding recruiting class that included 12 first-years. As a team, the Pioneers finished first in the conference in all point scoring categories with team kills, service aces and blocks. The Pioneers had six student-athletes receiving post season honors by the NEWVA for their success on the court this season. Olivia Smith was named to the 2021 NEWMAC Fall All-Sportsmanship Team. Walker was selected by his peers as the 2021 NEWMAC Coach of the Year.\n\n\"We are pleased to welcome Greg Walker to Smith College Athletics,\" said Hughes. \"His experience and proven ability to turn around programs speaks for itself.

Troy was the MPSF Tournament runner-up and, for the first time since 2012, qualified for the NCAAs. USC, playing the nation's toughest schedule, had 7 wins over teams ranked in the AVCA Top 10 at the time and won 11 of its last 15 matches. Its in-season No. 4 AVCA ranking was the program's highest since 2015 and its final No. 5 ranking was its best finish since 2012. Troy was undefeated at home (12-0) for the first time since 2000 and was 5-2 on neutral courts. At USC, Walker oversaw all recruiting efforts, planned and ran all of the practices, created scouting material and was the point person for admissions, compliance, academic support, strength and conditioning, facilities, sports information and equipment.\n\nHe guided Sacred Heart University of the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association to a 15-11 mark in 2017 (the third most wins overall in school history and most DI/II wins during the NCAA NC format, including a pair of victories over Penn State and a school-record 8 EIVA conference wins), school first volleyball AVCA All American and was named the EIVA Coach of the Year that season.\n\nSince 2015, Walker was an assistant with the Sacred Heart women's team, helping the 2016 squad to a school-record 22 wins and the Northeast Conference regular season title. In 2015, the Pioneer women advanced to the Northeast Conference tournament semifinals. Sacred Heart had the NEC Player of the Year in both 2015 and 2016.\n\nFrom 2013-14 Walker served as the assistant coach of the Mississippi State women's volleyball program followed by a year as the head coach of the Alderson Broaddus University men's team. Under his tutelage at MSU, he coached a program first – two AVCA All-American’s and a SEC Freshman Team selection. At ABU, he transitioned a club program into a varsity program and in his first season posted a 21-6 overall record while leading them to a Conference Championship.\n\nHis first head coaching job came at Pfeiffer University, where he was in charge of both the men's and women's teams, leading the men to the Conference Carolinas conference championship in 2013.\n\nWalker began his career as a volunteer assistant for the Juniata College men's team, before moving on to volunteer assistant positions with the women's programs at Mercer University and the University of Oregon.\n\nProven success at EVERY level (Power 5, D1, D2, D3) with establishing an empowering program culture and building winning programs.\n\nJumped ranking ranking of 135 teams to NCAA Regional Ranking in one season.
