Michael (Mike) K. Simpson is serving his eleventh term in the House of Representatives for Idaho’s Second Congressional District. Mike was born in Burley, Idaho, and raised in Blackfoot. He graduated from Utah State University and earned his DMD from Washington University School of Dental Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. After graduation, he joined his father and uncle at the Simpson Family Dental Practice in Blackfoot.

Mike married his high school sweetheart, Kathy, and next year they will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary! He is an avid reader and golfer who also enjoys painting and experiencing the exceptional scenery Idaho has to offer, with Kathy and their dog Charley.

Mike serves on the House Appropriations Committee. He is the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development. He also serves on the Interior and Environment Subcommittee. These committees have jurisdiction over funding for a number of programs critical to Idaho, including the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, the Forest Service, and our National Parks.

Simpson fights hard for Idaho, whether it is advocating for an energy policy that emphasizes national independence, including research and development for improved nuclear energy technologies, or taking on the EPA when they overreach in Idaho industry, Mike stands strong.

He has also gained national attention for his bill to split the massive, overburdened 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Simpson’s leadership also led to the passage of his legislation that provided historic forest management reforms, most notably treating wildfires like other natural disasters.

Mike loves Idaho and works hard on her behalf every day.
