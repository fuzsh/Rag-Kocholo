        "text": "Washington, D.C. – Today, Representatives Mike Simpson (R-ID) and Robin Kelly (D-IL) introduced the bipartisan Action for Dental Health Act for reauthorization. The legislation is co-authored by Congressman and dentist Mike Simpson and Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust Chair, Congresswoman Robin Kelly. The bill was overwhelmingly approved by the House and signed into law in 2018 and is due for reauthorization this year.\n\nThis legislation directs federal support to organizations that provide oral health care to underserved populations, especially seniors, children and those living in rural and urban communities. The bill strengthens the impact of existing resources that provide oral healthcare to populations that may lack sufficient access.\n\nThe legislation will continue to reduce the number of oral health emergency room visits by increasing access to holistic, preventative dental care.\n\n“This reauthorization is an important step in addressing barriers to oral health care services. The more we can address early diagnosis, intervention, and preventative dental treatments, the better off our patients and our health care system will be. As co-chair of the Congressional Oral Health Caucus, I am pleased to reintroduce this bill and look forward to its progress in Congress,” said Simpson.\n\n“I am proud to lead this bipartisan effort with Congressman Simpson for a second time to ensure that more Americans can access the oral health care that they need,” said Kelly. “Oral health care is a critical part of our overall health, and preventative dental care can reduce costs for families and help so many people live better lives.”\n\n###"
