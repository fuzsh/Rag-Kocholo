        "text": "\"The office is always clean and friendly. My hygienist is a friendly efficient lady that always gives me great feedback. The dentist is thorough and polite. I usually only wait about 5 minutes but today was longer. With all the precautions they take I wasnât surprised. All in all I would highly recommend this practice.\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"Dr. Simpsonâs staff provides excellent dental care in a very efficient manner. I never encounter long wait times and the hygienists always provide thorough dental cleanings and a friendly smile. Front office staff is always very helpful and efficient. Highly recommend Dr. Simpson.\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"I liked waiting in my vehicle, getting my temperature checked, rinsing with Listerine and the knee operated sink to wash your hands. All of this takes place before even sitting in the dentist chair. Knowing the staff are wearing two masks and having a Hepa filter in each room is also a great practice for safety.\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"Super friendly and great service. The waiting time has never past 15 minutes for my visit This is a huge benefit for me since I donât like to wait for a service\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"I have been treated so well at this office. From the time you come in until you leave the staff shows you care, concern and will listen to you and answer any questions you may have. My teeth were a mess from several other dentists in other states. Dr. Simpson was able to save and repair my teeth and now I get positive check ups where before with the other dentists it always led to misery and $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Thanks to all of you !!!!!!!\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"Iâve been a patient if the practice since 1987. Dr. Simpson has been my Dentist over 21 years. The office staff is wonderful from check in to check out. All questions are answered. Having TMJ makes dentist visits painful, they are tolerant and patient. My family has used the same practice and have highly recommended Dr. Simpson. If you are looking for a friendly, caring dental practice I recommend Oviedo Premier Dental. If you panic seeing a dentist they will put you at ease and make you feel part of the family!\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"Have been going to Oviedo Premier dental for a number of years and I always have an excellent experience. The staff is very kind and professional. I would recommend this dentist office.\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"Can't express my gratitude at having such an intelligent, knowledgeable, and caring Dentist and staff. Every visit I have had, has been excellent. He must have some magic formula for hiring staff because one again his assistant was super sweet as well as very competent. Every person that works in his office is as nice and competent as he is.\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"I did not have to wait because I was call for my appointment on time. The staff was very professional and explained what they were going to do. I got out quicker than I expected. My visit was great..\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"I had an issue with a crown, anticipating a huge bill. Dr. Simpson was amazing. He could have easily recommended a whole new crown, but instead told me I just needed a repair. He spent a lot of time with me explaining what the procedure would entail and what I should do in the mean to maintain healthy gums in that area with certain toothpastes. I have been going to this office for years and have I NEVER felt that this office has ever tried to \"up sell\" be on money making, unnecessary procedures! Thank you Dr. Simpson and staff for always making what would ordinarily be an unpleasant trip to the dentist office, a pleasant one!!\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\"\n\n\"Great service and the staff is very friendly. I was called back at the time my appointment was scheduled and didn't have to wait in the lobby.\n\nThis review was submitted for the provider's practice, and may reference another provider within the practice.\""
