He enjoyed hanging out with family and friends, reminiscing about his childhood, playing pranks on his family and friends, he loved his church family even though he had not been able to attend due to medical issues, and he loved to tease his grandchildren, but they always knew grandpa would give them a dollar or two or three.\n\nThe family would like to thank Sooner Hospice for their thoughtfulness and guidance through this rough time. Also, we want to thank Skyview Nursing Home and their staff for their compassion. We would love to thank Brother and Sister Been.\n\nA Memorial Service for Michael will be held at Portland Avenue Pentecostal Church on 39th and S. Portland, Oklahoma City on Saturday, October 24th at 2pm with interment at Arlington Memorial Gardens"
