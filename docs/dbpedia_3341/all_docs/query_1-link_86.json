        "text": "Guthrie Public Schools (GPS) says it plans to use more portable classrooms this year. Amid overcrowding issues, district leaders recently added one at Charter Oak Elementary.\n\nFox 25 is told there are at least six portable classrooms districtwide.\n\n\"I like that they came up with a temporary solution,\" Parent Kristen Holzbaugh said.\n\nHolzbaugh has two kids who go to Charter Oak.\n\n\"Last year I know my kids were in classrooms that had 24+ kids in each one.\"\n\nSuperintendent Dr. Mike Simpson says at the end of last school year, GPS was at nearly 88% capacity. Cotteral Elementary went over the limit at 100.3%, and Charter Oak was at 94%.\n\n\"We were out of classrooms,\" Dr. Simpson said. \"In fact, we took a computer lab that was originally built as a computer lab and turned it into a small classroom.\"\n\nHolzbaugh says this year, her fourth grader will probably experience what a portable classroom is like. She's okay with that.\n\n\"I feel like it's going to be more one-on-one time with the teachers,\" Holzbaugh said.\n\nDr. Simpson says this resource will allow the school to have smaller classes and hire more teachers.\n\n\"In a perfect world, we'd all be inside the building in classrooms,\" Dr. Simpson said. \"But if you look around the state of Oklahoma, I think you're going to find that it's going to be very hard to locate a district that truly is growing that's not utilizing these in some form or fashion.\"\n\nThough the district doesn't want to continue relying on them, as it's going to hold a bond election at the end of August.\n\nIf the $45 million bond passes, Dr. Simpson says it will give Charter Oak and Cotteral more classrooms. It would also build a new elementary school.\n\n\"We want to provide for the growth. We've got over 900 homes that are platted just inside our city limits. We are the third fastest growing county in the state, and a large portion of our school district is in that footprint.\"\n\nThe bond election will happen on August 27."
