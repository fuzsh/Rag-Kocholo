He was 48 years old when he was running his last mission in Afghanistan.\n\nDr Mike Simpson recently wrote a book called “Honed: Finding Your Edge As A Man Over 40” and it was so good that I read the whole book in an afternoon. You all know that I am extremely passionate about my physical fitness and this book was right up my alley. Mike tells us about his background in this episode, goes into what the book is about, and we dismiss some of the myths that come with physical fitness at an older age.
