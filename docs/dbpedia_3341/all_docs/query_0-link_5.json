        "text": "Congressman Mike Simpson D.M.D (ID-02)\n\nIn this episode of Tooth Talk from the halls of Congress, Sarah and Peter sit down with Representative Mike Simpson of Idaho, to learn what it is like to be a dentist serving in Congress. We learn about the path Congressman Simpson took from Blackfoot, Idaho to Washington D.C., his work on the House Appropriations Committee, and his feeling on the signing into law of The Action for Dental Health Act which he introduced. Rep. Simpson also provides advice to dentists thinking of running for office."
