        "text": "‘This massive consolidation of NIH’s institutes and centers amounts to Congress dictating science’\n\nThe ADA is expressing opposition to provisions in the fiscal year 2025 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, specifically language that would restructure the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIn a July 10 letter to House Appropriations Committee chair Tom Cole, R-Okla., and ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the ADA urged removal of the language that calls for a reorganization of the NIH.\n\n“Structural and policy changes of this magnitude must be considered through an open, transparent process that includes public hearings and a thorough review of the impact on biomedical research,” wrote ADA President Linda Edgar, D.D.S., and Executive Director Raymond Cohlmia, D.D.S. “They must be legislated thoughtfully and deliberately — through an appropriate authorizing body — not simply written into an appropriations bill.”\n\nThe current version of the House appropriations bill would consolidate the NIH’s 27 institutes and centers into 15 newly renamed institutes and centers. It would place the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research under the jurisdiction of the Institute of Neuroscience and Brain Research.\n\n“NIDCR is the nation’s primary biomedical and behavioral research and research training organization specializing in dental, oral, and craniofacial health,” the ADA leaders wrote. “Diminishing NIDCR’s institute-level status would threaten the United States’ position as the world’s leader in dental, oral and craniofacial health research.”\n\nNIDCR recently celebrated its 75th anniversary of conducting biomedical and behavioral research and research training, specializing in dental, oral and craniofacial health. The organization works to prevent, detect and treat dental, oral and craniofacial diseases and conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the ADA joined 222 other organizations in a July 9 coalition letter also opposing the NIH restructuring proposal.\n\n“This massive consolidation of NIH’s institutes and centers amounts to Congress dictating science; it would affect all research conducted at the NIH and be detrimental to the research enterprise,” the coalition wrote. “A policy of this magnitude — and one affecting one of our nation’s preeminent research institutions — should not be included in an appropriations bill.”\n\nDuring a July 10 appropriations markup meeting, Congressman Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, spoke about the importance of the NIDCR.\n\n“As a former dentist for over two decades, I know the unique challenges that hinder advancements in oral health. Shifting NIDCR to this broader context will dilute its focus and risk the loss of prioritization of the important research this Institute carries out. I urge the committee to consider preserving the NIDCR’s economy as a unique and separate Institute and I stand ready to work with the committee to achieve this goal,” he said."
