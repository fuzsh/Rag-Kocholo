For example, Lisa Simpson was shown \"The Big Book of British Teeth\" by her orthodontist. Is there actual evidence that British teeth are worse than anyone else's?\n\nDavid Dreaming Bear, Horsethief Canyon, California USA\n\nBritish teeth are not bad, but irregular by American standards. American middle class children are normally tormented with gratuitous cosmetic dentistry to make them look like Stepford wives, so that any dental individuality is regarded as strange. An American woman I know whose parents resisted this fashion was bullied at school for her \"bad\" teeth, although she doesn't have a filling in her head at the age of 45.\n\nChristopher Young, Sheffield England\n\nI don't know the basis for it but it is definitely a stereotype the Americans have about us. I was talking to an american woman recently, and in the middle of the conversation she broke off to exclaim at what \"remarkably white teeth\" I had.\n\nPeter, London England\n\nSurely this stereotype has arisen out of the American preoccupation of spending large amounts of money on having their teeth done, a pastime which, like cosmetic surgery, the British find too vain to become involved in.\n\nClive, Sydney Australia\n\nIt's actually Canadian humor. Mike Myers (Canadian) gets the credit for this from \"Austin Powers\". Americans are quiet on the subject of teeth since our first president didn't have any (except made of ivory and held together by frightful metal springs).\n\nDan Morgan, Boston US\n\nI understand that before the second world war the Americans' dental health was apalling. Visiting servicemen spread the use of toothbrushes when they went 'back home'.\n\nJonathan, Lancaster UK\n\nIt was actually 'The British Book of Smiles'. Americans spend loads dewonkifying their teenagers' teeth so they just look better. British children's teeth are much better today than when I was young, despite all those American soft drinks.\n\nTomas Santos, Hove UK\n\nIts not that ours are bad but that Americans are obsessive about their's. Its catching on here too with just about all kids getting fitted with braces. Don't remember anyone at my school who had a brace. Notice that Austin Powers has snaggly teeth reflecting the American view of a Brit.\n\nGeorge, Edinburgh Scotland\n\nUntil the NHS started up, and before the availability of fluoride in toothpaste (or water), our British teeth were spectacularly ugly. Look at any film footage of average Britons before about 1945, and weep. The standard of living of the contemporary American probably afforded them better dental care; and, I suspect, a certain cultural austerity would have meant that corrective procedures such as braces would be regarded by us Brits as extravagance and vanity.\n\nSimon Gilman, London UK\n\nI think Simon Gilman has put it best. Having spent my first 20 years in America and 14 years since living in the UK, I find that the average Brit is satisfied with teeth that might be crooked, stained, even slightly rotten, if they aren't causing much discomfort to their owner. Average Americans have much higher standards of expectation in the state of their dental health -- regardless of whether they have to pay for dental treatment or not, they feel very strongly that good teeth are a wise investment in looks and health. Many visits to the dentist by average Brits happen only after something has gone horribly wrong with their teeth, whilst Americans take an actively preventative approach with semi-annual dental checkups and intervention before any problems become severe. As a result of the greater amount of attention that Americans pay to their teeth, they are far more likely to notice and comment on the state of other people's teeth.\n\nWendy James, London UK\n\nJapanese culture has a stigma attached to teeth. Women cover their mouths while laughing because of this. Fortunately this also helps to cover up their awful teeth. An attractive girl will quite often be ruined by a horrifying set of gnashers. In my opinion free dental care for children on the NHS gives us far better teeth than the Japanese and leaves us with more natural smiles than our American cousins.\n\nJohn Mullen, Kitakyushu Japan\n\nI don't know about the States, but here in Mexico the common phrase to describle 'wonky' teeth is 'dientes ingles' (English teeth).\n\nIain Pearson, Mexico City Mexico\n\nI just returned to the US after having lived in England for seven years. The concept of \"bad British teeth\" is certainly an unkind stereotype, but I agree with the fact that the English are more comfortable with the idea of having manky teeth as long as they don't actually hurt. I think the NHS is to blame, in part for not having enough dentists in certain parts of the country to allow for visits twice a year, and also by establishing the attitude that that having white teeth, free of decay, are hard to achieve rather than a normal healthy state of being. In the US, health insurance often does not cover dental work, and does not cover braces at all, but since sound teeth are a class indicator here, people would be hard put to just accept having a missing tooth or visible decay for fear of being thought a hillbilly.\n\nValene Harris, New York US\n\nAs an American who has lived the past 3 years in the UK, I am sorry to say that I must agree with the \"bad teeth\" stereotype. I know that some Brits (as I have been reading in the above comments) see us Americans as being \"obsessed\" with good teeth, but some of the teeth I see here are absolutely appalling. Otherwise attractive people are rendered hideous by mis-shapen, stained, rotton teeth. One time a man I was talking with in a pub claimed he was getting drunk that night so he could go home and pull his bad tooth. When I asked why he didn't go to a dentist he announced, with pride, that he had never been to a dentist in his life. I found it absolutely disgusting - just as if he had announced he had never bathed. I have also seen women in the UK spend thousands of pounds on cosmetic surgeries, including breast augmentation, while completely ignoring a mouthful of crooked, fang-like tobacco stained teeth that badly effect their appearance more than anything else. Sorry, Britian. Us \"yanks\" happen to be right about this one!\n\nJovanka Steele-Williamson, London UK\n\nim a dental hygienist in ny. the people I see here are just as ignorant about oral hygiene as anywhere else. many people interested in whitening have periodontal disease, their teeth are actually loose but rather than pay to see a periodontist to save them they would like them bleached because that seven hundered dollars is easier to come up with than the money to actually save the teeth. alot of people want their teeth pulled and nice white dentures put in instead. how about some preventitive measures like regular check ups or floss it costs a dollar. even if you dont have insurance chekups at the most are way way less than the average price of sneakers most people have a low dental IQ no matter what country.we need to change this.tooth loss is not necessary even if you're 80. floss!!!\n\nheather, new york usa\n\nI have to say, as a tourist here in London for the millionth time, I am always astounded by the bad teeth here which I believe is caused mostly by smoking. I think it's cool to have iregular shaped teeth, but staining and rot...these are syptoms of bad hygeine, not vanity and not genetics. Apart from being the most disgusting habit in the world, smoking really makes teeth look gross. When I am attracted to someone, I imagine kissing them. If I can't get past that initial imagining (ie. if the person opens their mouth and has terrible teeth) it's NEVER going to happen. Instead of being obsessed with highlights, tans and boob jobs, why not invest a few bob in a trip to the dentist, a bleaching tray and some dental floss? The world would be a better place!\n\nGary, San Francisco USA\n\nAs a Briton living in the US for the past four years, I can honestly say that British people do have worse teeth. I came to US considering myself lucky to have a good set of teeth; however, over time I realized that my teeth were far from perfect. And all it would have taken was braces for a year or so. Americans do have far straighter and whiter teeth than English people. On a trip back to England I asked my dentist about British teeth, he said even when he offered corrective braces, crowns, bridges for free, people were not interested. I think British people are starting to care, but have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nP. Doodes, Chicago, USA\n\nI hate to admit it, but American teeth are (generally) whiter and straighter than us Brits. However I fall into the typically British camp of, although I would like to have whiter teeth, the thought of cosmetic surgery or self-manipulation seems vain and slightly shallow. I believe you should be happy with yourself, crooked teeth or not.\n\nKarl Gilbert, London, England\n\nI must have misunderstood the stereotype. I always assumed \"British Teeth\" to refer to large, even rows of well-spaced, uniform-sized teeth (easier to floss). I spent years in braces, had a couple of painful oral surgeries, and I still look like Terry-Thomas, so you won't hear me complaining. I actually find my concept of \"British Teeth\" rather attractive.\n\nJeff Meade, San Francisco, United States\n\nAs a geneticist, I'm dying to claim that the state of British teeth is at least partly genetic. Otherwise, I can't explain why the dirt-poor janitor at my research centre, who grew up in Eritrea and hadn't seen a toothbrush till he was twenty-seven, has flawless white teeth; whereas Prince Charles, who presumably had access to every toothy luxury, keeps his lips shut when he smiles.\n\nPremee Mohamed, St. Albert, Canada\n\nI admit that I have heard or seen things that have to do with the English having bad teeth, but I don't think it's an \"American\" thing, especially when 99.9% of people I know don't think anything of it and don't pay any attention. Besides, even if their teeth aren't 200% perfect, they have the most fabulous accents EVER!\n\nRenee Chastine, Ann Arbor, USA\n\nI think that some of the 60s pop stars are to blame for some of the stereotype. Peter Noone? Keef?\n\nBill Moran, Fairmont, WV, USA\n\nIf you look at history, poor dention of the English is recorded as far back as when sugar was introduced to the upper classes and coveted to the point of their teeth falling out in the 14th century. It's probably mostly Anglo-Saxon genetics. I don't understand why people get their panties in a bunch and have to call Americans \"vain\" and so forth. Don't be so touchy. As an American I've gotten used to every other nation having some crap thing to say about \"my people\", and usually it cuts further than a comment on my teeth.\n\nPeg, Reno, Nevada, USA\n\nBeing French born living in the US I can testify that: 1) the appalling state of British teeth is shared by ALL Europeans. Their teeth are crooked and YELLOW even in the upper classes. 2) The American standards are WAY higher; most of my employees have flawless WHITE teeth. 3) And, yes, I had my teeth redone to match my social environment ($30,000)\n\nStephane, Michigan, USA\n\nWell, I live in Norway, and most people here have nice teeth, also before braces. But the times I've been in UK, I really did notice how everyone's teeth are more uneven than I'm used to. So I don't think it's only a US stereotype.\n\nChristine, Oslo, Norway\n\nWhile I agree somewhat that Americans are peculiarly obsessed with cosmetic dentistry, I don't think it's only for aesthetic reasons that Americans pay for things like orthodontia. Crooked and overcrowded teeth are more likely to fall out, so there are health benefits too. I'm sure you guys are right that some Americans get tooth whitening for themselves and braces for their kids just because they're worried about how they look, but if the fear of developing yellow teeth motivates people to brush and floss more often, then I'm all for it.\n\nBeth Gabor, New York City, USA\n\nI'm with Peg from Reno Nevada. Well said, Peg. But the part about \"why people get their panties in a bunch\" made me laugh so hard my teeth hurt. The newest addition to my lexicon.\n\nJack, New Canaan, USA\n\nA friend's daughter, a beautiful young blonde (who wore braces in her teens) met a charming Solicitor on a visit to London. As the transatlantic romance progressed (they are now married), the first thing she told her mother about him was that he had terrible teeth!\n\nBennett, New York, NY, USA\n\nMy dad hauled my family and me off to Denver, Col. in the late Seventies, which was nice. But he suffered badly from 'British tooth syndrome', and it wasn't simply about a lack of toothy symmetry or luminosity! I recall that he suffered terrible, agonising problems with his molars at the time, but all of these were solved in a few, admittedly expensive, sessions with a local dentist. So I submit that it's not just vanity, but a better standard of dentistry, that was (is?) the main cause of the Anglo-American 'gap'. A gap that is I think, these days, thankfully narrowing due in no small part to great improvements in general dental hygiene here (and improvements in treatment, no doubt, if you can afford them - perhaps it's just that more people can).\n\nJon Lishman, Llanelli, Wales\n\nBritish people drink 180 million cups of sugary, milky tea every day. Here in the north we also smoke constantly and drink dark beers. No wonder our teeth ain't white. But at least we're not all obese.\n\nPatalicious, Darlington, UK\n\nI have to agree with Gary and Premee.\n\n1 - I could never be attracted to someone who had skank teeth. Skank teeth = skank breath and also tells me that the person is unhygienic and probably has bad health. Not an attractice combination.\n\n2 - I was in the UK when the Queen Mother died, and was appalled at the state of her teeth- ugh! Black and nasty, what were they doing with all their money? Obviously not spending it on a toothbrush and some toothpaste. In my travels there (I've been quite a few times), a lot of the people I encountered had nasty teeth. You may think they're nice looking til they open their mouths, and it was hard to hide the shock-horror that registered on my face time and again. I don't have \"Hollywood teeth\", but I do take good care of mine!\n\nBev., South Carolina, United States\n\nLeave it out Bev, the Queen Mother was well over 100 before she died, so she would have been in age where all the fancy treatments wouldn't have been around. Wasn't much she could do. And to all those going on about it being a health issue rather than a cosmetic one, better take a long hard look at you Americans, so obese as a nation it's sickening. All those heart attacks, diabetes et al the highest in the world. Don't try and preach yo us.\n\nMichael, Nuneaton, England\n\nI first really noticed bad English teeth watching British comedies. It amazed me that actors such as John Inman (Mr. Humphries) in \"Are You Being Served\" and Geoffrey Hughes (Onslow) in \"Keeping Up Appearances\", did nothing about their awful looking crooked, broken and stained teeth over the years. I could understand Onslow's character having bad teeth, but with Mr. Humphries, who was in the public eye, why did the producers think that his teeth look attractive?\n\nMarcia Smith, New York, US\n\nSounds like a gross generalisation - as daft as saying \"all Americans are stupid\", \"all Americans are warmongers\", or \"all Americans are religious maniacs\"...\n\nChristopher, Brighton, UK\n\nWhen i was in Britain I didnt see any bad teeth, just some crooked like mine. But when i was in the USA people had all prefect straight teeth but they had a lot of fillings.\n\nPaul, Bremen, Germany\n\nAs an American-born resident of London, I hold the steretype is based on fact. Brits have terrible teeth! As a few have pointed out, Americans are obese. As a whole, we are also more wasteful and harder workers than the Britsih, but those are equally irrelevant to the discussion at hand. There may be a serious weight problem in the US, it does not, however, negate the essential helath benefits connected with regular dental hygene and dentist appointments. Despite the absurd claims of Brits being unconcerned with appearances (the short skirts, bleached hair, and orange spray-on tans up and down Oxford Circus beg to differ), Americans are encouraged to care for their teeth for non-cosmetic reasons. Admittedly as a result, straight white teeth is now the norm and thus, perhaps vainly, expected of the population at large, but looking more attractive is a small \"price to pay\" to a few more years without dentures. The obesity argument, besides being entirely off topic, is not a particularly strong one either. Twenty minutes in the dentist chair twice a year and 2 minute sof brushing a day is an easy way to improve your health and appearance. While not particularly positive, the amount of work necessary for the average American fatty to get physically fit would be far more intensive. The question then, for the purposes of THIS discussion, is \"Why won't the Brits invest 40 minutes per annum and 2 minutes a day to look and feel better and live longer (not flossing regularly has been linked ot heart disease, gum disease leads to high blood pressure)?\"\n\nJames, Washington, DC USA\n\nI can only speak for Belgium and the neighboring countries but I also see the \"terrible teeth\" syndrome here as well. There is nothing wrong with having crooked teeth or not having teeth that are perfectly straight. What there is no excuse for is in fact disgusting hygiene. I see here in Belgium tons of people with rotting,yellow or brown stained teeth and I do not understand it,considering the availability of inexpensive dental care. Do not be afraid of a toothbrush and toothpaste.It will not bite.\n\ndino, los angeles Belgium\n\nYou have all made some pretty good points. Some better than others, but hey we're all different kinds here. OK, so the majority of Americans are a little obsessed with dental work. My dad (a baby boomer) was tormented by the fact he had to wear head gear to school in the early sixties. My grandparents wanted better for their kids then they had.. and when it came time for me to have braces, you bet I had them strapped on my mouth for a couple of years even though I didn't even need them. Perfection right! Now, all that money spent on braces went down the drain... I didn't wear my retainer. I still get compliments on my teeth but I don't really go crazy on making them perfect. I brush twice a day, sometimes floss, but I do use a whitening mouthwash.. it helps! So, I'm going on a date with a fine guy from Newcastle tonight, and although I haven't seen pictures of him smiling teeth and all, I'll have the worst thoughts of nightmare teeth imaginable, but I'm more excited to see what kind of person he is!! Yes, a person with his own identity and flavor! Sorry, if this wasn't really relevant. We are all not perfect no matter where we come from, we should embrace our differences and just simply get along.\n\nTina, Los Angeles, United States\n\nI am not sure of this but i believe that it may be because Americans have been putting Fluoride in there water. In the UK bout 10 per cent of the population, six million people, receive fluoridated water, mainly in the Midlands and north-east, and the government plans to extend this, with Manchester expected to be next. About 170 million Americans live in areas with fluoridated water.\n\nGary Bell, Blackpool England\n\nOk maybe it is due to Americans having fluoridated drinking where it is advailable to 170 million but in England only 10% of the population get fluoridated drinking water. I know this American guy he does not brush his teeth for days on end whereas i am constantly brushing mine and my teeth are nasty- well not that bad considering, but they do feel like it.\n\nGary Bell, Blackpool England\n\nAmerica is insecure and will pick out any little thing that promotes themselves! But as stated above, I'd rather crooked teeth (although mine are 100% perfect - shock horror) than weigh 400 lbs. And as \"nice\" as the American smile is, half of them don't know where in the world they are. Let's compromise - Brits are to spend more on Colgate, Americans to spend more on Weight Watchers and education (Geography in particular).\n\nMatt Green, Brighton, England\n\nThe issue for me comes down to bad breath, plain and simple. I don't have any problem with unique teeth, but chronic bad breath, well, I think you can safely say that it is the single worst turn off known to man. I've lived in Japan, which has to have the worst dental hygeine in the developed world. Cases of dragon breath abound. Part of it has to be genetic, because I have lived in Nicaragua, a developing country where most people can't afford a toothbrush, toothpaste, let alone a checkup, and a high percentage of them had decent teeth. Please do the world a favor and spread sweet smelling kissable breath. Floss, and go to your dentist at least once a year. You don't have to get braces if you don't want to, ok? Deal?\n\nSeth, Connecticut USA\n\nAfter reading the article and comments, I have to say that both sides are right, and wrong. Americans DO have a much higher health standard with our dentistry. But many of the Brits are right too in which the U.S. has a sickening problem with coronary disease and obesity. Crooked, plaque infested teeth are disgusting and very unhealthy. But so is eating at McDonalds everyday and many American schools cutting physical education. We both have issues to work on.\n\nJohn, Chicago, IL U.S.A\n\nI would never generalise and say all Brits have bad teeth, any more than I would say all Americans are loud and fat (although many are!) It's just the way it is, with dental care here. When I was a child in the 70s and 80s my family had no money, could barely pay the light bill, but my Mom scraped for the dentist. Not for vanity, but it was equated with doctor visits. You go to the doctor, you go to the dentist. It may be vanity now with whitening,etc. but there was none of that then, it was just thought the healthy thing to do.\n\nLisa, Connecticut, USA\n\nI think it's an interesting point that the person made about \"if the American dental standard is because of \"health concerns\", why is America so record-breakingly unhealthy on so many other fronts?\" It strikes me that it's to do with spending money, and the American cultural attitude towards that. It costs lots of money to have the regimented, flawless teeth of an American. It costs hardly anything to eat healthily and not be fat. In fact, it costs MORE to be fat. Therein seems to lie the truth; in America's spend-happy, consumer culture, anything which is cheap is avoided and anything on which vast amounts of money can be spent is gravitated towards - irrelevant of health issues. So dental care is costly and coincidentally it's good for you. Eating to the point of weighing literally twice as much is also expensive and coincidentally it's bad for you. Buying a huge, inefficient car is expensive and coincidentally it's bad for everyone. The average American spends way more on items related to in-active entertainment, such as home cinema systems and video game consoles, than any other person in the world; conversely they spend far below average on sports equipment and things such as bikes. The former things are far more expensive (afterall it costs next to nothing to play a game of football, whereas a HDTV can cost $1000s) and is, coincidentally, unhealthy. If you think in terms of Americans being \"preyed\" on by people wanting their money - whether it be food companies or dentists - then it all starts to make sense.\n\nWill Ondore, Milan Italy\n\nWow! I was lucky to come across this conversation. I am actually doing a project on British teeth for my High School's Foreign Language Club's Mulitcultural Week. I'm somewhat fascinated with Great Britain (I blame it on your actually having a history) and so I chose to do my project on this. But I've had trouble coming up with a reason that everyone thought British teeh were bad, seeing as how when I typed into Google (or the like)I came up with many sites on British Dentistry. I found that odd if everyone supposedly has \"skank teeth\"...I thought that if the rumor were true I could blame it on a lack of flouride in your water, but I have since learned that is a false thought. And, personally, I have a crooked tooth I was born with and when my mother offered braces I told her (quite affrontedly) that that tooth added character!\n\nRachel, Missouri USA\n\nMany of you Brits feel that it is Americans vanity that engage us to worry about the health of our teeth. It is also consideration for others. I am not the one that has to look at my teeth all day. I might see my teeth twice a day during each of my brushings but my co-workers and family are the ones who have to see them all day long. I can't help but stare at the yellow stained, crocket teeth. I find myself having to purposely stop staring. Your right it does bring character to the face. Just don't feel uncomfortable when I stare.\n\nBrandy, Hermosa Beach now Otley USA now UK\n\nFirst off I would definitely have to agree that British people have worst teeth then Americans. I don't understand it when British celebs, such as Katie Price (aka Jordan) get boob jobs, dye their hair, and tan but don't bother to fix their awful teeth. It's like building a new house with termite wood. Also, yeah the Queen's mother was 100 and was living before mass dental health care was available, but I live in the rural South and have met people who are 122 whose teeth were in much better shape than hers. And secondly, Americans may be obese but you Brits are sure catching up with us being the second most obese country after Americans. Getting your teeth checked and cleaned is more a matter of health than vanity. There have been documented cases of people who have died from tooth infections that can spread to the brain. Just look at the little boy who recently died in Maryland from a tooth infection because he didn't have the health insurance to pay to see a dentist. Brits have health care provided by their government at least do us all a favor and use it, especially when so many here in American aren't given the option by our government.\n\nMalathia, Atlanta, GA United States\n\nThe first I ever heard about bad teeth in England was an article in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine by P. J. O'Rourke. I believe it was titled \"Among the Euroweenies\". He relates a story of a very condescending Brit in a bar, who merely grinned at O'Rourke's responses to his anti-American comments, and I believe the last sentence of the article was \"Don't these people have dentists?\" I understand that this article is an excerpt from O'Rourke's book titled \"Holiday in Hell\", published in 1988.\n\nRita Dalon, USA\n\nOral health is not based solely on cosmetics, as many Brits tend to suggest. It has to do with overall personal hygiene and quality of life. Gum disease, tooth decay and oral cancer affect nearly a third of all adults in the US. I'm betting 99% of adult Brits have suffered \"facial pain\" in the last 6 months.\n\nN. Saxon, Boston, USA\n\nBrandy, your argument is absurd. I am hardly obsessive about my teeth, but I was lucky to be born with a straight set. The idea that I should maintain my teeth to avoid disgusting someone else rather than for my own health is just silly. I'm almost inclined to use your argument about some of the fatties we have here though. I shouldn't have to vacate an entire hallway just to let someone pass...\n\nDave, Long Island, NY USA\n\nI think it's a macho thing for the Brits. I have a few Brit friends and they refuse to see doctors until things get life threatening. Stiff upper lip syndrome,.....and I guess it's the same thing with their teeth.\n\nFreddy, Kaohsiung Taiwan\n\nSorry folks, you can't use the obesity argument anymore. According to a recent WHO publication, about 74% of Americans can be classed as overweight, but Britain is close behind with 63%. Pot calling the kettle and all that. As to teeth - I think a middle ground would be nice. I don't care if you have snaggly teeth if they're clean. Hygiene first!\n\nMaya, Sacramento USA\n\nSimply a different dental culture. From the time we (Americans) were children it was always 2 Dentist trips a year, fluoride in the water, and floss, floss, floss. White teeth in American culture is much more a symbol of 'hygiene' than of obsessive vanity.\n\nAJ, London UK\n\nIt is undoubably true that Americans have straighter teeth then the british, it is for the same reason that at the turn of the century chinese women had much smaller feet then british women. As a people we seem to shy away from performing painfull procedures on our children for a percieved cosmetic benifit.\n\nErik, Derby England\n\nWell... On television I see a lot of Americans with very white teeth... but white and even doesn't mean healthy, repeated whitening treatments are very bad for teeth - one thing you can say about us Brits - we're far less likely to end up needing false teeth!It's not bad dental hygiene - our teeth are healthy, we don't have bad breath - we just also don't have the vanity to spend hundreds of pounds on cosmetic surgery every few months. Also, I'd rather be stereotyped for having slightly yellow teeth than being obese, stupid, war-mongering, sheep. Perhaps Americans should think about the way the rest of the world views them, before going on about how \"disgusting\" they think we look.\n\nLucy, Driffield E. Yorks\n\nIt's a cultural thing, obviously. I learned this early on from my father's attitude towards dental hygene, and he hails from the U.K. I was visiting relatives there--this was about 20 years ago--and without exception the guys and girls both cared not for dental hygene. It was weird to see so many truely attractive cousins just neglecting something so basic as your smile.\n\nMike McNally, Toronto Canada\n\nOn a related note, I was wondering ... since there are clearly no dental records anywhere in Great Britain how does Scotland Yard identify murder victims? It must be a real bugger.\n\nWibbett McFreeling, Gasping Ridge, New Jersey, USA\n\nWhat you have to remember is this-Americans are constantly looking for things to make themselves feel better-who has the better car, who has the nicer home, who wears designer clothing. I am constantly forced to defend the Southern US (where I come from) because the rest of the country thinks we are all a bunch of backwoods hillbillies with no teeth and old tires in our front yard. Don't pay any attention to Americans. So many are ignorant of anyone outside of their 50 mile comfort zone. P.S.-My teeth are just fine.\n\nStephanie, Asheville, NC USA\n\nStay away from fluoride! It's poison,is possibly a major contributor to the incidence of Alzheimers disease, lowered IQ, and it reads right on the toothpaste tube to call the poison control center if ingested. Whatever you do, do not swallow much of it! And remember, U.S. water supplies are full of fluorides(added). It will be shown in the future that fluoride has been a leading cause of the above ailments and many others that plague us. Wait and see!\n\nSteven , Great Falls USA\n\nIn the Victorian era in Britain, it was fashionable to have bad/rotting teeth as a sign of wealth. Having black teeth displayed your affluence and ability to afford sugar products and confectionaries. Some upper-class citizens used to paint their teeth black to emphasise the effect. I'm guessing that this - and the American pre-occupation with a Hollywood smile - made up this misconception.\n\nEmily, Middlesbrough United Kingdom\n\nYes people in the UK DO have bad teeth - but so do other people across the world. And there are also people in the UK who have NICE teeth, just like everywhere else in the world!\n\nMichelle, Manchester United Kingdom\n\nI thought bad teeth were more of a European thing, rather than just the British. I am one of those people who has never even been to Britain, but still has that idea of British= bad teeth. Ignorant, I'm sure, but there is some merit to it. The royal family is a good example (and I am not referring to the elderly Queen either.) Nonetheless, the British still have the most amazing accents (although I cannot understand much of what they're saying.)\n\nHeather, Rio Rancho, NM United States\n\nI never associated bad teeth with the British, but more with the Asian community, specially the Chinese. I know not everyone has bad teeth or good teeth but as a joke the British teeth thing is kinda funny.\n\nM16, Compton, USA\n\nHow about americans shut the hell up for once saying we have bad teeth, look at their teeth huh? they are white, straight and oh yeah don't forget, have loads of fillings, like all their moviestars. We don't have as many fillings as them so we have better teeth then them. They're just so pathetic too get their teeth bleached, painted, capped whatever you wanna call it, its pathetic. Yeah i'm British and I do kind of get put off by horrid teeth but all the people i know my age, 17 - have fine looking teeth. My teeth are a bit crooked and they aren't dazzling white however I use colgate every morning and night, listerine clear mint mouthwash every morning and as a result, im 17, i have not a single filling and i've been told my teeth are so clean I don't have to go to the dentist for a year. Americans have dirty teeth they are just made to look white and straight, if they weren't paying for good dental work they would have dreadful teeth. Oh and sorry yanks but you're still fat *****!! xD\n\nNick , London, UK\n\nI was born and grew up in Australia, and I can confirm that this stereotype is by no means limited to the United States. Also, for what it's worth, I continually found myself staring at what I can only describe as 'British people's weird and warped teeth.' Sure, this doesn't apply to everyone in Britain, but I'd say that most people I've ever seen in Britain have more warped teeth than back in Australia. Perhaps the stereotype is on to something?\n\nOliver Bisazza, Aberystwyth, United Kingdom\n\nI would like to think humans have evolved beyond the use of stereotypes, but, to address a stereotype, America isnt exactly known for its world wide love of others and knowledge of the world. And how any American can preach about geography or the metaphysical concept of shame is beyond me. For those interested Im getting my sources from the Jerry Springer show  just like America gets theirs from Austin powers ISNT THAT FAIR!?!? (btw, that was satire, look it up)\n\nDaniel Sawyer, Witham UK\n\nI was born in the UK and emmigrated to the USA at 34, where I've lived for the past 14 years. I therefore feel pretty qulified to comment. With few exceptions, the state of American teeth is exceptionally good, regardless of social class. It has nothing to do with vanity. It's just good oral hygeine. British teeth are better than they used to be, but are still shockingly bad for a country so wealthy. The staining is attributable to smoking and tea drinking. Brits drink vast amounts of strong dark tea. The crooked teeth are due to a lack of interest in getting dental check-ups. Although I grew up on a British council estate (that's the projects to you Americans), my mother was a nurse, so she made sure that I got proper dental services. As an American now, my good teeth are \"up to standard\", thanks to my mother. It's not a stereotype. British teeth are not easy on the eye. Also, the British/American comparisons are not the answer to the issue, as Brits tend to think that Americans are all obsessed with cosmetic surgery. Make the teeth comparison with countries like Germany, Spain, Italy, etc.\n\nNeal Richardson, New York USA\n\nHere in the US we do think that the UK has horrible teeth - not rotten - but apparently getting them straightened hasn't occurred to many people. Add in the horror stories of people yanking their own teeth because they can't see a dentist for some reason (I've seen the prices, cost isn't really a factor). \"British Teeth\" in the US is slang for someone that has teeth that look like a ancient stone fence that has mostly fallen over and been haphazardly repaired once or twice.\n\nHarvey Moul, Seattle USA\n\nI don't think Americans in general are obsessed with teeth. It's just that many of us have a habit of routinely going to the dentist. My insurance won't cover my dental appointments unless I go two times per year. Any less than twice a year and treatment becomes too expensive - it's all preventative. Americans may have a headstart on the use of fluoride because, if I recall correctly, it was discovered in Colorado. Mine workers has brownish black teeth that were otherwise in far better condition than anyone had ever seen. It was from the natural fluoride in the water. (Those who keep bringing up US obesity might want to scan the web for stats comparing obesity rates in the U.S. and in the U.K. They're not very different.)\n\nMichelle Wagner, Lansing, Michigan, USA\n\nOk, well yeah, some Americans are fat but, thats not the issue here. Yes most people think British people have bad teeth, mostly because they don't have flouride and don't frequently go to the dentist. Also, there is nothing wrong with getting braces retainers or Vaneers (fake teeth made of porcelain that they put over your original teeth). I had braces for two years got my teeth whitened and i'm getting Vaneers next month. This is more out of just wanting to look nice than vanity. There is a diference between being vain and just wanting your teeth to be presentable. By the way, Steven from Great Falls, you are an idiot conspiracy theorist - flouride is not poisonous, what is poisonous is whatever the hell you're on.\n\nKatie, Washington, D.C. USA\n\nWell, I was very surpised to see responses from Brits here about Americans being \"obsessed\" with white teeth to the point of making them appear unnatural. All I can say is that I would choose \"unnatural\" and risk being called vain every day of the week before I'd settle for a nasty mouth. your smile is what you greet the world with, and nobody (at least not most normal people) wants to come face to face with a mouth that looks as though its owner couldn't care less about keeping it clean and healthy. Good oral hygiene, for the VAST majority of Americans, is about not being physically gross and offensive, and NOT about getting teeth that are perfectly straight or white. My own teeth and those of my children are not really straight, or brilliant white, but at forty-six I've never had a cavity. Neither have any of my children, and I'm proud of that. We are not well off, by any means, but I make sure everyone brushes and flosses well, and we see dentists regularly for preventive care. It's all about good health, people! Taking good care of your teeth and gums helps prevent MANY other health problems in other body systems, including those related to the heart. If you're genetically predisposed to having bad teeth, all the more reason to give your mouth pointed attention!\n\nMia, Winston-Salem, NC USA\n\nI was unaware of this stereotype until a few minutes ago when I stumbled across this discussion. Here's my 2 cents: a. Straightening teeth is an ORTHODONTIC procedure - it's highly specialized dentistry that isn't absolutely necessary. b. Good oral HYGIENE means acceptable breath, strong gums and not having severely discolored teeth. You should be brushing your teeth, gums and tongue and flossing regularly. If Brits or anyone in the world has bad oral hygiene, that can be fixed easily. So I don't really know what people mean when they say Brits have \"bad\" teeth. But good oral hygiene is a must so take care of your mouth no matter how your teeth are arranged in it.\n\nManju S., Olympia USA\n\nBrits have the worst teeth. It has nothing to do with Americans being vain- why are we to be faulted on vanity grounds for good oral hygiene? YUCK who would want to kiss, let alone look at a face full of mangy crooked teeth. Most of the brits i have met have teeth going north south east and west- no thank you!\n\nMelissa, New York NY\n\nIt's quite obvious from the posts made by the British commenters that they believe we Americans come about our good teeth through artificial means. I find this both surprising and somewhat flattering. I hate to rob you of your illusions, but that simply is not the case. Plain and simple: it's genetics. The overwhelming majority doesn't require ANY cosmetic enhancement, and will never get any. I see very few people with braces. I don't recall braces and retainers being very common when I was growing up. In grade school we teased kids with 'metal mouths' and retainers because it was not the norm to see kids with bad teeth. The average American is born with a good set. The shape may not be perfect, but the overall condition of our teeth is excellent. We don't go to the dentist biannually because we're vain, but to maintain the health and condition of our teeth. I don't know if the British are born with bad teeth, or if their's deteriorate do to neglect. That's only for you to answer.\n\nNina Hertz, Philadelphia, PA USA\n\nI think only Manju is making any sense to me, I live in England always have done, met some Americans in Germany on a boat on the Rhine. They commented on my teeth and it was the same stereotype, one asked if I'd had them whitened? I said no, it was quite funny really. I know only two people who had bad teeth, they got them fixed, which is where my argument that this is a stereotype comes from. Somebody mentioned genetics which is rubbish, you can't use a Liberian who'd never used a toothbrush in 27 years, since the diet of a British male and that of a Liberian male are entirely different, most notably the consumption of sugar. There is no arguable basis for this stereotype, which is why it is just that... A STEREOTYPE!!!\n\nConor Smith, Manchester England\n\nIt's wrong to blame the NHS entirely for the extent of oral disease and amount of rotten teeth in the UK. Many areas in the UK have no problem with NHS dentists and the prevalence of tooth decay, gum disease etc is still very high because people do not take pride in, or care of, their mouths. I think people are starting to care a bit more especially on the cosmetic side, but there are still a massive number of people who neglect their oral hygiene. Many people never go to the dentist until there is a severe problem which is why it is so unpleasant when they finally go. However, a bit of crookedness adds character to any smile, as long as it doesn't prevent proper cleaning, what's the problem?\n\nNellie Lacka, Newcastle\n\nOrthodontics are not just for looks. Having malaligned teeth can affect your bite and cause improper tooth wear. Well aligned teeth stay cleaner and healthier longer and help your teeth last your whole life.\n\nPatrick, Ohio, US\n\nWell, I had braces for about 3 years when I was at school. I do not now have straight teeth, so maybe it's just that our NHS dentists/orthodontists are not very good..! I definitely don't have any dental hygeine issues though, and no fillings at age 24 (I do have all my wisdom teeth though). In fact apart from the removal of 4 extraneous teeth and the braces wearing when I was at school, I have had no dental work at all and now don't go to the dentist. I would only go if there was some problem with my teeth. Christian Bale got his British teeth 'fixed' for American Psycho, stating: \"I'm English. Our dentistry is not world famous. But I made sure I got moldings of my old teeth beforehand because I miss them.\" So maybe we just like being ourselves however we happen to have been moulded by genetics and environment. I have to say though that it seems to be only Americans who have such gleaming dead straight teeth. I think Americans and Brits compare teeth as we compare other things because we share a common language we assume other cultural things to be more comparable than with other countries'. My boyfriend has a tooth missing and slightly crooked teeth, and actually I kinda like it! Maybe we just have a different idea of what is asthetically pleasing.\n\nEllie, London England\n\nFirst off, if many brits (not all because that would of course be sterotyping) want to have crooked teeth, who cares? I'm sure I have had more cavaties filled than most of the UK despite my lovely smile. On a different note I can handle your generalizations that we are fat and obnoxious but I won't stand for an assault on geography! Just because we didn't try to colonize the entire world with our culture doesn't mean we don't know where things are. And finally as for the war-mongering, excuse you? Whose spineless Prime Minister followed the lead of our hapless Commander in Chief? Who always follows our lead no matter how bad the idea is? I wish your leaders would get some pride and stand up to ours for a change. Just a thought.\n\nChris, Minneapolis USA\n\nI don't think its just Britain, but I can honestly say there are a lot of Brits I notice that should have had a brace and I cannot understand why hey did not. Children I went to school with (many years ago) did wear braces and there was no shortage of NHS dentists like there has been in more recent years. Interestingly my own teeth suffered at the hands of American dentists who did a survey in Britain years ago providing free toothpaste and dental care for two years. On going back to my family dentist he said I must have been over prescribed fillings (having gone from none to six at the start. Subsequently my troubled teeth and extraction thereafter have been those very teeth with others being fairly sound through good oral hygiene. The bottom line is that Amercians appear to have much better teeth, although I have noticed that some celebrity smiles are over-perfect making it obvious work has been done which I dislike and think defeats the object (a bit like many fake boobs being obvious!). I think a much more natural line should be adopted when correcting teeth.\n\nDavid Cockling, Isle of Wight, UK\n\nIt's simple, really. As Americans, we brush, floss, and go to the dentist. I really don't think that should be considered vain. It's just good hygiene. Obesity and education (geography, etc.) have nothing to do with comparing teeth. Let's try to keep it relevant.\n\nCaitlin, Dallas, Texas United States\n\nI'm 16 currently and have had extensive dental work to the fact that two of my adult teeth never grew so need fake ones put in. Many of my friends have also had braces etc... However I think that much of the stereotypes has occurred because up until the early 90s dentists were paid by the number of fillings they did so it was in their own interest to drill when and where unnecessarily, this meant they would get paid then and would then have repeat custom in the future.\n\nJack, London Borough of Bexley, England\n\nI brush my teeth daily (twice, if you want to go into details), I smoke (again, between 5-15 a day if you want exacts), I do not drink tea, I drink water and milk, ocassionally Ribena (you Yanks dunno what you're missing there ;)). My teeth are probably considered \"bad\" by American standards. Yes, I have gaps in my teeth, and they are also slightly discoloured. My problem wasn't poor dental hygene, bad genes or whatever other crap you guys are spinning. The gaps? Sadly, I fell as a child, and lost several of my front teeth as a result. When they grew back, I was too young to get braces (we're talking three/four here), and when the gaps became a \"problem\" in my teenage years, we couldn't afford braces even if I'd been conceited enough to get them. Discoloration? Well, I won't get too into that, but yes I had an eating disorder, no, that isn't strictly British. Smoking probably doesn't help, but it's better for my teeth than puking up my meals. Sorry if our teeth aren't even, whiter-than-white and perfectly straight, but to be honest I'm more focused on keeping trim, keeping my heart healthy and not starting wars my country can't finish. Or did America forget their luggage in Iraq the first time and go back to collect them? ;) Yes, I am talking about those \"WMD's\"\n\nLeanne, Edinburgh Scotland\n\nI grew up in England but now live in Colorado. Just about EVERYONE I know in the States has had braces and has had their wisdom teeth pulled out, even when they were not causing a problem. Part of this is that dentists, like doctors here, make enormous profits from the procedures they do. I admit that in general, Americans care more about their teeth and certainly floss more, but in fact most young people I know in the States simply don't go to the dentists anymore because they simply cannot afford it....\n\nLaura, Yorkshire USA\n\nI'm British and found that episode of the Simpsons hilarious. People need to lighten up and learn to take a joke. I spent 4 years living in the States and their dental wipes the floor with what we have in the UK. But by world standards I don't think our teeth are that bad, though we do seem to suffer a lot of cavities from all those sweets we have. :)\n\nJohn Pope, UK\n\nI have never been to the UK, and I don't judge anyone on teeth, unless they're disgusting and black. My interest in folks from the UK is that I like the accents. As far as teeth, I have straight, white teeth which were accomplished by frequent visits to dentists in addition to good oral hygeine and good genes. I have several fillings, most likely due to my affinity for chocolate, but like the true vain American I am, the fillings are white to match the teeth. I never wore braces, but I had to have my wisdom teeth removed at age 17, owing to chemotherapy, my teeth were coming in spongy and already decayed. My point is: I live in the South, and around here, it's pretty disgusting how people will be 20 years old and have all of their front teeth gone from decay. I don't mean crooked. Crooked doesn't bother me. It's poor hygiene that gets me. I've heard that people from areas where fishing is a popular (or the only) way to eat, have beautiful teeth, because of the vitamins and minerals found in the fish. I need to eat more fish and less chocolate. As far as the trends, history shows Americans copying other countries and then other countries copying the USA. Just as long as someone is happy and healthy, I really don't see the problem.\n\nTeena, USA\n\nWill Ondore is sadly mistaken; it is far more expensive to eat healthily in the US. You can get lots of fat-laden menu items at McDonald's, Wendy's or Taco Bell for less than a dollar. You can't get the ingredients to make a fresh salad for less than a dollar. People living at the poverty level can usually afford a fast food meal and have their belly feel full; they can't afford skinless chicken breasts or lean meat and fresh vegetables (and many poor people don't have the facilities necessary to prepare and cook healthy meals every day). Good dental hygiene is all about staying healthy, not vanity. Look up bacterial endocarditis some time.\n\nJill, Michigan, USA\n\nI'm American and I've lived in London, HK and Osaka. Yes Brits seem to care less about the state of their teeth than Americans - but compared to Asians the British Teeth are pristine. That Japanese have some of the nastiest breath on the planet, it was a serious problem with dating when I lived their. And Hong Kong forget about it! The problem just gets worse as you travel into mainland China, serious bad breath and body order in general. While living in HK I mainly dated British women and never had a problem with their teeth or breath. Now I'm married and my wife is British, her teeth are sparkling and her cooking sucks.\n\nJeffrey , New York, NY USA\n\nHey, we practise sound dental hygiene, so shoot us.\n\nBuster, New York, USA\n\nWell, I have straight white teeth without cosmetic procedures and bleachings. I am a 19 year old that brushes her teeth twice a day and flosses. I see my dentist at least twice a year. Now about USA being obsessed with perfect teeth, this may be true but it has been proven that healthy teeth are connected to a healthy body. And I just can't see how someone can be alright with rotten teeth. Food stuck on and between your teeth. BACTERIA! Your mouth is an eating device and if your not going to eat off of dirty dishes, then why would you eat with a dirty mouth?\n\nSky Nunez, Bridgeport ,Connecticut USA\n\nMaybe one reason Americans perceive that the English have bad teeth is because people in such high power or visible to us e.g. Tony Blair have very distinguishing flaws in their teeth. Maybe it has to do with the history but rotten teeth are not unique and do not qualify as character, anyone can have rotting teeth if they try long enough. The statement that wanting aesthetically pleasing teeth is vain, is not true. Is trying to clear up acne, vain? Is dying my hair back to my natural color to cover up the gray vain? Is plucking my uni-brow vain? I can definitely understand why others think that Americans are vain I just dont think teeth are necessarily the determining factor. Oh yeah and if Americans are so vain why arent all the fat ones working out?\n\nElizabeth, Dallas, US\n\nI'm an American who spent 2 years living in England. I personally believe that part of the reason that British teeth are ugly is because of the large percentage of smokers. Though this wouldn't attribute to snaggled or uneven teeth it certainly discolors teeth to a disgusting brown. (Another thing is in Mary Poppins the kids have frightening teeth if you ever noticed.)\n\nJohn Smith, Nowhereland America\n\nI just paid a visit to the UK, and met a very nice fellow with quite a number of missing or black-rooted teeth. I didn't say anything, because I couldn't convince myself it was any of my damn business, but I also couldn't help wondering how that could have happened. He's not rich, but not poor, either, and I'm pretty sure English dentistry is less expensive than American, even excluding National Health. All I can think is: different priorities. As for comparing the US and the UK, I wonder if a greater fraction of the UK population neglect their teeth than the fraction of the US who voted to re-elect President Ubu.\n\nJohn, Winston-Salem, NC USA\n\nWhy do Brits always bring up Hollywood movie stars as if they're representative of everyday Americans? Seriously, if one's only knowledge about American culture comes from movies and Baywatch episodes, then you're opinion is not well-informed. You're most likely guilty of using stereotypes, just as an American who believes all British have horrid teeth would be.\n\nJohn, Alabama USA\n\nI've been to Australia, and to England, and both countries have an overflowing amount of people with horrible teeth. I've seen several children in Australia with yellow teeth who ate the same thing that my child of the same age ate, and brushed everyday and the australians teeth were still yellow. Also, in England, I've stayed with people who also brush their teeth everyday, twice a day, and even use mouthwash and still their teeth are yellow. So I think it's a misconception that the English, and other countries do not brush their teeth and have poor dental habits. I think the person above who said it had to do with the fluoride in the water was spot on. If 170 million Americans teeth are bleached from the day of their birth, by drinking flouride infused water, then we're all just going to have whiter teeth. haha and as far as the weight comments go about Americans.. I suggest you Brits come on over to the USA and have some of our food. It tastes better than yours. That's why we're fatter. *wink*\n\nHelena, Pittsburgh USA\n\nFor all those Brits who think they are intellectually superior; why do you divert the discussion from poor British hygiene, to American obesity? Are you so much smarter than us that you are incapable of staying on topic. You argue like 5 year olds. Change the topic when you feel hurt or embarrassed. During my business trips to the U.K., I met many Brits whose teeth were so filled with the food from previous meals, you couldn't tell where one tooth started and the next stopped. That's disgusting. Learn to brush and floss your teeth.\n\nRichard, Palm Beach, FL USA\n\nThe power of suggestion is incredibly strong, you know, guys. If you go to Britain expecting to see the stereotype of bad teeth, you will only notice those with the bad teeth because they fit the stereotype. It would take a fine pair of gnashers (e.g. Simon Cowell) for you to notice that their teeth are actually quite nice, because you expect them to be rotten. When you see an ugly pair of teeth on a Brit, it registers in your mind and you think \"Hah, see, it's the truth!\". In a different situation, I've travelled to the US before and seen fat people about. I also saw plenty of thin people, but it was only the fat people I noticed because then I could go \"Look, another American fast-food addict..\". See what I mean? It's all psychological in my opinion. I don't think British people have worse teeth than anywhere else in the world. Mine are fine and I've never had any kind of dentist work done on them other than regular checkups every 6 months. I've been lucky enough to have naturally straight white teeth that I've looked after. Most of my friends have nice teeth too, after wearing braces. But even if someone I knew had wonky teeth, there is no way I'd hold that against them. That'd be like prejudice against someone's glasses or freckles or hair colour. Utterly ridiculous.\n\nEmily, Middlesbrough UK\n\nI have straight teeth, and for those obsessed with saying that all Americans get their teeth whitened, I have never had my teeth whitened - just routine dental care. I think that is a Hollywood myth that people in Europe think that Americans live like the movie stars. Also, I was in the Bahamas recently and was sitting by this really obese woman. Was she American? No, she was British. Check out the fat statistics darlings, you all are closing in on us. By the way, I don't eat fast food from McDonald's, etc, and I'm not fat. Stereotypes are so stupid don't y'all think? I'm sure that bad teeth doesn't pertain to ALL of Britain. Just like not ALL Americans are fat and uneducated. To even say it makes one look like a dumbbell.\n\nKaye LeBlanc, New Orleans, USA\n\nNo one in my family or me has stained or crooked teeth, its just a stereotype, if someone sees a British person on the street with bad teeth compared to a Brit with good teeth, youre going to notice the one with the bad teeth because its such a famous stereotype for us. Its like saying all Americans are fat, because of the junk food, but its not true, and personally, I think its quite unnatural to have a set of perfectly sized perfectly white and square in your mouth like a set of polished dominoes.\n\nMegan Foley, Somerset UK\n\nUntil reading these responses, I never knew British citizens actually refer to braces as \"cosmetic dentistry.\" I think that about answers the question. Until now, I thought it was peculiar to hear a dental professor from the UK tell a news reporter actually advocating for \"annual dental visits.\" I recall once, I waited 7 months for a dental exam and had a guilt trip. But waiting an entire year? Beyond absurd. On a side note: I have a friend who wanted to become a dentist to help give kids braces in developing nations. I guess you folks think that's \"cosmetic\" though... that's weird. Go see a dentist. It's not attractive, and it's not \"cosmetic\" to see a dentist and get braces. Before reading these responses, I wanted Obama's medical coverage. Now I'm scared.\n\nCharles Shoemaker, Boston USA\n\nI know this much - I am frequently on websites in which people display pictures of themseleves and there are many Brits and many Americans. It took very little time before I could determine what country someone was from with about 90% accuracy just by looking at their teeth. It's amazing! And, I can only conclude the Brits,in general, do not feel it is important to have straight teeth. It seems sad to Americans because so many otherwise attractive people look awful to us.\n\nRandy, Chicago USA\n\nI think that the whole reason Americans have better teeth is because they have to pay for their dentistry, so therefore they pay as much as possible to get sparkly white teeth. While in Britain, we have free dentistry, and therefore, our dentists are going to be payed the same amount no matter what they do, so instead of working overtime to get your teeth in tip' top shape, they do a quick check then run off to their private islands in the Caribbean. Simple as that.\n\nCallum, Watford Hertfordshire UK\n\nPeople like Richard from palm beach USA (above), notice how uptight this American gets when we mention American obesity, sounds like you're the one thats is hurt and embarrassed, and when you say something like above, we have every right to mention American obesity. Now i can finish the argument for you, we don't all have bad teeth, we don't all think we are intellectually superior and the comment you left was rude and made you sound very ignorant.\n\nI work in the aerospace industry with several British contractors (from London and the Isle of Wight). They all have very nice teeth and also love living in America! Our employer provides dental insurance, which pays for two cleanings per year and other coverage as required. In addition, braces are also included in our plan. Perhaps the people with the horrible teeth are relying on a welfare program for their trips to the dentist?? I say, land a job with good benefits. If you don't have marketable skills, learn a trade or get a degree. In the meantime, don't let that stop you for taking care of your teeth. Flossing every day can add three to five years to your life. Crooked teeth are fine, but rotten teeth can literally kill you. Cheers and happy hygiene :-).\n\nJordan, Seattle USA\n\nI find it odd that so many Americans I've met comment on my teeth. They seem amazed that I have white, relatively straight teeth. My front couple of teeth are fractionally crooked by a degree or two, and my canines are slightly longer than the norm but otherwise they are strong, clean and healthy. It seems there are two stereotypes here getting mixed up. There is the idea that brits have large, mishapen, crooked teeth, and then the idea we have actual rotten and unhealthy teeth. Americans focus more on our royalty and 'upper' classes than the rest of us. They are widely known for incestuous inbreeding and this restrictive genepool leads to type 1 'british teeth'. The rest of us who don't marry our cousins tend to have more uniform gnashers. Type 2 'british teeth' are simply the result of a lack of care. I brush my teeth and use mouthwash twice a day and visit my dentist (NHS) twice a year. I don't floss but that's not too necessary if you brush properly (there is no matter left after I brush). The problem here is largely education and it tends to be worse amongst the poor usually due to bad diet. I spend about a third of my year in the US and the rest in the UK and I see these 'type 2' teeth in both countries. It seems the type 1 draws attentions to Britain and type 2 justify it. I'd say from experience that bad teeth are universal on both sides of the pond, in equal amounts, but that Americans are more conscious of both their and others dental health than Brits. Understand, not being overly conscious of my teeth doesn't mean I don't look after them. It's just that cleaning my teeth is side by side with brushing my hair and tying my shoelaces - part of my daily routine, no more no less.\n\nBilly, Darlo England\n\nI'm an American living near Leeds in England, and everyone I knew from an early age knew we were supposed to visit the dentist every 6 months to clean plaque. We were taught that there are health reasons for good dental hygiene. I did have braces too, but not as much for cosmetic reasons, but to fix some wacky tooth alignment problems that might've caused headaches as I grew older. I also makes it easier to chew foods like carrots. When I go back to the US, I get a bit depressed to see how fat we are, but I also notice that the Brits are \"catching up\" to the US on fat at an alarming rate. In Yorkshire, it's not unusual for me to see healthy, thin, attractive parents with chunky children. As few people I know here eat fast food (there's not that many McDonald's around, and the Burger Kings are disgusting inside), there must be some other lifestyle change going on.\n\nWill, Leeds, UK\n\nI keep reading Brits comment about the obesity levels in the US, as if this is some kind of a great comeback for the dental stereotype. Give me a break, you all are only a few percentage points behind the US in obesity rates, coming in at about 20% to the US's 25%. Some of you all make it sound like you're a country filled with fit and healthy people, when the truth is quite the contrary.\n\nDave, Virginia Beach, USA\n\nI was on a first date with a British guy and noticed what I thought were tons of whole black peppercorns stuck on his teeth. I thought nothing of it at first--we were at dinner, his teeth weren't straight, so I thought maybe he ate some black peppercorns and they got stuck between his teeth. On our second date, the peppercorns were still there. I realized it was rot. He tried to kiss me and his breath reeked so badly. I was so turned off I had to turn my face. I don't mind so much the crooked or imperfection in his teeth. But rot and poor hygiene are something else. Yes, I agree Americans are obese. But nasty and rotten teeth are just as bad. Plus they are linked to cardiovascular issues and bacteria from your bleeding gums can actually go into your blood stream and cause other problems too. Could you imagine kissing someone with rotting teeth and bloody gums? He said he had only been to the dentist twice in his life and he was in his mid 30's.\n\nJenn, California USA\n\nNothing is wrong with crooked teeth, so I ain't gonna bother with braces...but yellow or rotting teeth is pretty nasty. It is not just British people who can have bad teeth. Yes, even you Yanks can get bad teeth if you don't brush. It is just that some people don't take care of their teeth and it is these people who gave us this stereotype...so why is it that it is just us that have this stereotype? As I have read up the top there, the Japanese have worse teeth and bad teeth aren't uncommon throughout the whole of Europe, so why?\n\nRich, Torbay England\n\nI just finished the British writer Martin Amis' memoir, \"Experience\" - you get approximately two sentences about his falling out with another writer, perhaps five about his first partner, while maybe five hundred sentences are given to Mr. Amis' rotting teeth and his father Kingsley's decaying molars. The entire book is one long crescendo of dental repair. We, the Americans, rest our case.\n\nPearly White, Plaquefreeville, USA\n\nA few comments: 1.) I watched \"4 Weddings and a Funeral\" on an HDTV last night. As far as I'm concerned, all of the bad teeth in that flick made it scarier than the \"Exorcist.\" 2.) Mike Myers of \"Austin Powers\" fame is Canadian. 3.) Obesity AND rotten teeth are both health issues. To wit, do we fat Americans know we should be exercising more and eating better? Yes, we're just too lazy to do it. Do the Brits know about the modern advances in dental hygiene? I think so, but as a Yank I wonder if they truly believe in them or care. 4.) War is bad for everyone. 5.) The comment about Scotland Yard being unable to solve some crimes because they can't check dental records made me laugh aloud.\n\nTim, Atlanta, USA\n\nI've met British people who had bad teeth, and I've met British people who were obsessive about their teeth, one woman carried whitening strips in her purse. But I have to say, of the people in society who choose to let their teeth go, both in America, and England, the British are, by far, the worse of the two. And, personally, I commend them for it. Too many Americans are overgroomed, overdressed, and have become whiny little pussies because of it. Get a Brit and a Yank in a barfight, and I'm putting my money double-or-nothing on the Brit.\n\nDave, San Francisco, USA\n\nI'm an American living in the UK. Despite the fact that I do not have Hollywood bleach-white veneers on my teeth, am not overweight, do not drive a Hummer, and have not spent my entire life living within a 50-mile radius, I'm amazed by how many Brits approach me in pubs, at parties, etc and treat me as if I did. Why do we - Americans, Brits, whomever - focus so much on stereotypes?\n\nPeter, Bristol, UK\n\nThere are stereotypes on both sides of the pond. Americans think that all Brits have \"bad\" teeth. Brits seem to have misunderstood our stereotype and think that we are all just being vain, materialistic, and superficial, supporting their own stereotype. I don't know ANY American who thinks that a Brit has \"crooked\" teeth to the point where they would be unattractive. When Americans sterotype Brits as having \"bad\" teeth, what they really are thinking of is \"decayed\" teeth. In short, not a lack of orthodontics, a lack of dental hygiene. Obviously that isn't true of the whole or even a majority of the populace. I just thought I would comment because many Brits seem to think Americans are bothered by a lack of orthodontics. That isn't the root (no pun intended) of the stereotype at all. This is a stereotype of dental HEALTH, not dental appearance.\n\nMichael, Omaha, NE, USA\n\nFirst, teeth in UK aren't too shabby, but they aren't grand either. Next, based on my travels, the French have the worst teeth anywhere in the EU, hands-down. As for any POMs being a bit ticked about the program or American stereotyping, hey now, it's all about who'll watch this rubbish. As I recall it, \"your\" BBC carried the show! Heck, we Yanks are the real victims here guys! Ha! Enjoy and remember, you need to floss chaps!\n\nPatrick , Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nI came across this discussion while looking for answers related to my worsening TMJ problems. I personally believe both genetics and hygiene/cosmetic concerns play a part in the American/British teeth issue. I'm not yet 30, am of overwhelmingly English (colonial) ancestry, and was frequently complimented on my straight, white teeth through my childhood and teens, although I always had a slight overbite and a few odd gaps between teeth. My childhood dentist said my teeth were straight, so I didn't need braces (other kids with more obvious problems were getting them left and right, but twenty years ago, as long as teeth were straight, braces weren't considered necessary. It seems that they are now considered necessary to deal with any irregularity of spacing, etc.). I brushed, flossed, and visited the dentist regularly. Although my jaw has popped since I was 9 or 10, I considered myself to have \"good teeth\" with no real dental issues until sometime in the past 10 years. In that space of time, it appears to me that ultra-white, perfect teeth have become the norm in America, and a new dentist (5 years ago) told me that I *should* have had braces as a child, to correct the slight gaps along the sides of my front teeth, as well as to help with my apparently hereditary jaw deformity (small jaw joint), which is supposedly a common cause of TMJ problems (?). I have had more fillings than I can count, one crown so far, and two TMJ splints. I don't have any visible decay showing (a couple of fillings a year!), but my teeth still have odd gaps and, since I'm unwilling to pay for expensive bleaching treatments, are less than ultra-white (though not a color I would have considered unnatural or unhealthy 15 years ago). I've joked to my husband (also of English Southern colonial ancestry, who has \"great\" teeth--he had braces to fix his more obvious problems as a child, and his TMJ issues don't cause him much more than headaches--yet) that my teeth would probably fit right in in England, because they are generally imperfect. My dad has similar teeth to mine, isn't yet 60, and is on his way to dentures, and my mom has decent looking teeth, but lots of fillings, crowns, and TMJ problems since she was a teenager, and the list goes on. I grew up in a rural area without fluoride, and being a Southerner, have drunk tea (both with and without milk, with sugar!) my whole life, so those two factors may play a part in decay and tooth-color issues. My long-winded point is, however, that our genes catch up to us eventually. My \"dental genes\", of whatever origin, cause me increasing problems (and money) each year. Being that I am an American, I feel pressure to keep my teeth appearing decently \"healthy\", a standard which seems to be raised every year and is becoming increasingly unattainable for those of us with naturally imperfect teeth. I'm convinced that if I stopped taking pains to restore my deteriorating teeth, I could move to the UK and fit the English stereotype perfectly! There's something to be said for regular brushing, cleaning and flossing, but also merit to resisting an expensive and unattainable standard for perfect teeth.\n\nMeg, Deep South USA\n\nUnfortunately, it's probably true nowadays that a lot of my fellow Brits have poor dental care. Thanks to our oh-so-wise government in their money-grubbing wisdom deciding that dentists in the UK could opt to go private, many people especially in the south of England where I'm from can no longer get a dentist on the NHS. That, combined with the truly tragic lack of jobs in my area, ensures that 90% of people can't afford a dentist. I was without one for 16 years, sadly, and I've only recently started getting the care I need.\n\nBill, Exeter UK\n\nI love the British. But one thing which must be \"contagious\" here is the inability to read. Most of us Americans have written comments trying to correct the absurd idea that Americans take care of our teeth out of vanity; but it seems no British were reading. Look, to take care of ones teeth in the US is JUST AS IMPORTANT as bathing and taking care of ones ARMPITS! Good God people!! I'm met too many people from Europe and Great Britain with such bad teeth -- and I don't mean crooked! I mean they obviously don't brush, or if they do, it's too late. Or something. I no longer care about the \"cause\" of Brits nasty, nasty teeth. Whatever. But as adults, why on earth don't you do something about those nasty mouths? Because you live in a culture which says it's okay to have a nasty horrible face. Yes, FACE. Your mouth is just as much a part of your face as your eyes! Why don't some of you Brits know that? As for criticizing Americans? Oh yeah, there's plenty to criticize. If you are from someplace else and getting very defensive (immature). Look. The article was about Brits teeth. That's the TOPIC. Not Americans. Not comparing. Geesh.\n\nLinda , Austin, USA\n\nWhat is this argument all about! You are all like kids fighting! OK, you Americans are the greatest, you have the best white teeth in the universe, you are genetically superior, you are bigger and better than any nation on this planet! Are you people happy now? You've won! Ok, we British are as we are, if you don't like us or our teeth then do us a favour and stay where you are - far,far away over the Atlantic!\n\nJillian, Southport, UK\n\nI didn't get to read all the comments that was made on this forum, but why does the majority of British population think Americans are fat? I personally think it's unattractive to have a person that is stick-thin with no shape. Americans have some fat people, don't get me wrong, but we have better figures (bottom and top) and better teeth. I work in the beauty industry and majority of people I see are most definitely not fat. They are bigger than the average European I see, but bigger in a good way. Your teeth are important, as is your weight, but downing Americans for their weight is just a low blow.\n\nHoai, Tampa, Florida US\n\nI lived in the USA all my life its not that we're all dental crazy people. Since health care isn't like the ones in the UK and other places. We have to care for our teeth since surgery cost tons of money. It pretty much easier to just keep them healthy then spend the rest of your life paying to get them fixed.\n\nPrice:\n\nInitial Surgical Consultation $97.00 - $145.00\n\nSimple Extraction (single tooth) $145.00 - $204.00\n\nSimple Extraction (each additional tooth) $151.00 - $194.00\n\nSurgical Extraction $281.00 - $339.00\n\nSoft Tissue Impaction $339.00 - $407.00\n\nPartial Bony Impaction $481.00 - $562.00\n\nFull Bony Impaction $704.00 - $795.00\n\nComplicated Impaction $1149.00 - $1570.00\n\nPanarex $122.00 - $165.00\n\nGeneral Anesthesia - per unit $229.00 - $291.00\n\nSurgical Implant Placement $2770.00 - $4324.00\n\nAbutment Implant Placement $1469.00 - $2301.00\n\nThe insurance usually does not cover you since all they care about is therir money. British people can choose not to care since it doesn't cost as much to take care of them, no?\n\nGiselle, NYC, USA\n\nHello - I'm English and I've been to America a few times, I think us English honestly don't care really. I mean it's not natural to have eye burning white teeth, and as long as it doesn't cause any pain, whats the issue? Are we so obsessed with what we look like, that we ignore what the person is like on the inside?\n\nSam Burnham, Burstwick, England\n\nInitial Surgical Consultation $97.00 - $145.00 so going by the latest exchange rates that is to us Brits is £60-£70 a visit but then we have the NHS...\n\nK Rutter, Lichfield, UK\n\nI have to laugh at most of the comments on here. None of my family, friends and work colleagues have rotten teeth. Not all are British though most are European. I have met a few people with bad teeth, and they have mostly come from a poorly educated background. I think you'll find that the vast majority of Brits visit the dentist twice a year, brush twice a day, floss and use mouthwash - the difference is we don't think straightening teeth for purely cosmetic reasons is that important. Major tooth mis-alignment would be sorted out, but a few teeth not perfectly at 90 degrees to each other is not important. Orthodontics in this country is about helping someone with teeth/jaw/mouth problems that cause trouble. I've never had a filling in my life, I've never had to have any corrective surgery in my mouth, my teeth aren't black or crooked - I can't be British can I?\n\nDanny Monaghan, Sheffield UK\n\nI think that the Americans are right about the British have bad teeth but the English are also right bout what the Americans say about the way that many Americans are unhealthy and obese. So i think both countries and their people need to sort their priorities as individuals to be able to over come their differences.\n\nVikum Kodituwakku, Letchworth, UK\n\nApparently few bother to read the previous posts before adding their own thoughts... This conversation is going around in circles, no one adding anything new. To the gentleman in Milan who suggested that America's preoccupation with the way our teeth look, as well as our health problems, have to do with wanting to spend money, I disagree, but I think you have a point. I don't think it's about money, though, I think it's about time: we work too much, don't get enough sleep, grab dinner at McDonald's on the way home (which may not be cheaper than a healthy, home-cooked meal, but is very cheap indeed when it comes to prepared food), then get home and plop on the couch in front of our big screens because we're too tired to do anything else.\n\nSarah Shafer, Fort Collins, USA\n\nSurely 'confirmation bias' has to be partly responsible for this? If Americans hear about the sterotype of British people having bad teeth, then when they come over hear for first time and notice the occasional person with bad teeth, it confirms to them that all Brits have bad teeth. They probably won't notice that most people have perfectly reasonable and healthy teeth. Sterotypes always start from somewhere though, but being British and living here for most of my life, I don't know many people with bad teeth, so I expect that it is something that was more usual a few generations ago and the stereotype has stuck. And aside from teeth that are rotten and severely stained, surely the odd 'odd' tooth adds a bit of character!? Absolute perfection is rarely that beautiful. Remember the gap toothed Wife of Bath from Chaucer's tales? Her gap tooth was a sign of her sexuality and lustfulness!\n\nSarah Law, London UK\n\nThe Americans look as if they have false teeth. Teeth by nature grown unevenly and are not a perfect shape. Then again, you need good teeth if you eat vast amounts of steak ...\n\nMike Ellison, Warrington, England\n\nUnless someone has horrifically misshapen nashers I honestly don't notice. I don't think I've ever seen someone who at first seemed attractive but was immediately proven to be repulsive as soon as they smiled. Perhaps this proves that English teeth are so bad that I've been totally desensitised to the fact that I'm surrounded by walking eye-sores. Perhaps, on the other hand, it proves that us Brits go for the natural look?\n\nDavid Carter, London U.K.\n\nI believe that the last comment about steak is quite possibly the most hilarious and absurd answer ive read on this board so far.\n\nAustin Terry, Dallas, Texas, USA\n\nContrary to some of the posters in denial here, white teeth are natural. White is the only color they come in originally. They only get discolored if they are stained by consumption of things that stain teeth, then not brushing them properly. The other reason teeth turn any other color but white is disgusting rot, also obviously caused by very poor oral hygiene. It's a HYGIENE issue in the US, not a cosmetic issue. And braces aren't seen as cosmetic here, either. Straight teeth work better, are easier to take care of, and prevent problems with jaw alignment. The reason many Americans have lots of fillings is because we go to the dentist regularly and get our teeth repaired when a cavity appears. Lack of oral hygiene causes periodontal disease, missing teeth can cause bone loss, plaque allowed to fester in the mouth has been shown to make it's way into your blood stream, clogging arteries and other important stuff. Good oral hygiene has been shown to translate into a generally healthier body. Get braces for yourself or child if they need them, floss and brush at least twice a day, and see a dentist at least twice a year and your British teeth will look just like our \"unnatural\" straight, white, American teeth. And guess what? We Americans can't get an \"NHS\" dentist either. We pay for our own dental care. It's considered akin to bathing or keeping a wound clean here. Common sense hygiene.\n\nFrank Annsirs, Seattle, USA\n\nYou're all correct about Americans being obese. In the last 20 years we've become hogs. What a sorry, sorry way to be. I was born with straight teeth.\n\nMary, Vincennes, IN, USA\n\nIt is an odd thing, but I know several Brits and their teeth are vary large, crooked and discolored. Im not saying they are worse (beauty in the eye of the beholder) - but they are all consistently: large, crooked and discolored. I think the words: worse than is a matter of opinion but they are: large, crooked and discolored. It's up to individual taste as to if they are better or worse.\n\nSharon Andrews, Chicago, USA\n\nAmerica has had fluoride in its water ever since the 70s and I think that plays a huge role. All of these comments I see posted by people in the UK saying we pay lots of money for our 'unnatural' looking teeth are false. I was born with straight teeth and my teeth are white because American kids are raised with parents, teachers, kid shows etc telling us to brush after every meal. And pretty much every American kid with noticeably crooked teeth gets braces to straighten them out because they are easier to take care of when they are straight. On top of all that most Americans go to the dentist for check ups twice a year. Having bad dental hygiene is bad for your health. We don't try to have good looking teeth, we do it because we were brought up with great dental hygiene.\n\nAndrew, Orlando, Florida, USA\n\nReading this thread has been all too funny and actually, extremely entertaining! I believe I will save it for future reference. Yes, I admit that I was led to this \"discussion\" by Googling \"Austin Powers\" and \"bad teeth\". Okay, blame Mike Myers, though he is Canadian. You know, actually, many of us have a parent or sibling from each country. This whole thread acutely illustrates the stereotypes, ignorance and fears on both sides; the attempts to defend 'God' and 'Country' ... and it's all over TEETH! Now, imagine a real world issue and the confusion that causes on our planet. Maybe, now, we can understand why it is so hard to get together and solve some of the most serious problems affecting this planet. It seems to become so difficult when someone is always drawing a line in the sand and forcing the inevitable taking of sides; instead of us all trying to have some empathy and relate to each other as fellow citizens of this planet. Im from Houston in the US but I love the United Kingdom and its wonderful, kind people - the land of my forefathers. Love and peace, people ... and great, healthy teeth to everyone!\n\nKen, Houston, USA\n\nFunny that the Americans are knocking the Brits for bad teeth, and the Brits are knocking Americans for being fat. The truth is we (Americans) are fat due to our sugar intake, and you Brits have bad teeth for the same reason. We do concentrate more on oral health, and possibly you concentrate more on physical health. Although, you're not far behind on the obese scale. Please, people, don't say it's the flouride. Flouride is completely toxic and IS NOT the reason for good teeth.\n\nKimberlie, Michigan, USA\n\nI have been living in London for about 6 months now, and I am surprised to find that (generally) most people my age (23) have nice teeth. I have noticed that the older generations tend to have some pretty awful teeth (sorry). My flatmate's father is actually missing a tooth, and he's OK with it. I have noticed this in several older adults. I am quite paranoid about teeth, so if mine look a little yellow, I'll immediately make a dentist appointment. Having lived in the UK for a few months, I have DEFINITELY noticed that my teeth have gotten more yellow, although I have kept my same dental hygiene habits. I don't understand how you can overlook dental hygiene. It's a part of your health. Tooth decay and gum disease can lead to heart disease. How this doesn't make sense to people, I just don't get. The older generations just don't care. And hey, to each his own. But, your teeth are visible basically all the time - when you eat, talk, smile, etc. Why wouldn't you want them to look nice? And I'm not talking PEARLY white, but why put up with yellow teeth? And missing teeth? So what about crooked teeth, but good Lord, missing teeth? We're not teething any more.\n\nValentina , Atlanta, USA\n\nI think we British don't have as bad teeth as it was in the past. Younger generations such as people my age (17) have pretty perfect teeth, usually a \"Hollywood smile\". However, looking at older generations, my mother and father don't have fantastic teeth. I think it's probably to do with the fact we all care about how we look now, but the bad teeth stereotype about Britain is starting to fade nowadays.\n\nJamie Perry, Doncaster, UK\n\nI am sorry but it's true. Brit teeth are horrible. I have seen far better teeth in Africa and the Mid East than I have here. It must be genetic. Brit teeth = gross.\n\nVirgil Donarski, Bradford, UK\n\nOf course Brits have the worst teeth in the world. Well below average. I have been living in the UK for 10 years and only know one English girl who has nice teeth and is proud of her smile. It's unbelievable. What's wrong with you people? Save money that you spend on crisps and get your teeth fixed!!!\n\nJay Geneviciute, London, UK\n\nWell, I don't think the braces explanation is sufficient when comparing British people to Americans. There appears to be a disproportionate number of British people (at least among those of Anglo-saxon/Anglo-celtic backgrounds) who have incredibly poor jaw and mouth structures. Braces do little to fix this.\n\nAndrew, Sydney, Australia\n\nI live in the USA and my teeth are definetly not the greatest, but they are white, and I brush them twice a day. But it's true that in America if you don't have nice teeth you get frowned upon. And being that my teeth are not straight that seems to be the first thing that people notice about you, they figure if you don't look picture perfect then your not worth their time.\n\nTamra Lutes, Beattyville, KY, USA\n\nWe British have wonky teeth but they are just as bad in other places in the world, like Belgium for instance. Besides, Americans have straight teeth with fillings - a stereotype. You cannot say British have bad teeth, its a stereotype as well.\n\nRobert Nikhwai, Chatham, Kent, UK\n\nMy wife recently shipped over one of the top UK consultants in sales over to the USA to help her staff, whilst the training was excellent the majority of the course feedback slips were concerned with the consultants bad (wonky) teeth. When my wife latter gave the feedback the consultant laughed, and mentioned she would rather have bad teeth and have a job than be fat and broke. 2 Months later my wife closed down the department due to poor figures and outsourced it to Canada. I am American, and I know that we are concerned with showing our wealth even when it serves no purpose or if it is damaging to the environment (watering our lawns even though our water supply with be gone in the next 20 years,wearing retainers in our late 30's even though we have a stronger chance of heart attack/stroke than any other country, taking the large gas guzzling SUV 1 mile down the road to go shopping!). I think the UK has the right idea, and like my wife says 'a pig with lipstick on, is still a pig'.\n\nBob Nortway, Chicago, USA\n\nSee this link, there are a lot of Americans here with 'bad' teeth. Seems a shame that people with good teeth are referred to as having bad teeth because whilst clean and healthy they're not unnaturally straightened. http://nowthatsnifty.blogspot.com/2009/10/celebrities-with-bad-teeth.html\n\nJames Page, Newcastle, Northumberland, UK\n\nI have lived in the US for 37 years having grown up in the UK in the '50s with NHS dentistry. My teeth are still crooked and discolored even though I have always had regular preventative care here. I wish I had had better care in the UK as a child. I made sure my kids all had orthodontic care if they needed it. It was never offered to me. By the way, it's obvious from the posts that the Brits spell more accurately than the Americans!!\n\nPat Duran, Littleton, USA\n\nI think that there is definitely some truth in the stereotyping of \"british teeth\". Some of this stems from bad oral hygiene, poor discipline and the so-called 'stiff upper lip'. However, I think more is attributable to the cost of dental care here. True, we have the NHS. However, this is inaccessible to many, and for those who do have access offers only basic treatment when things go wrong. I personally have two cavities in need of repair, I am unable to find an NHS dentist willing to take me on and therefore am forced to go privately. After a 10 minute 'consultation' - for which I was charged £100 I was informed that the cost of dental work was approx £2,500. The average salary in the UK is circa £25,000. That's nearly 10% of an average annual wage. There is no way that I could afford this at the moment, therefore I will have to save for the work, by which time things may have deteriorated and the cost increased. It's a vicious circle. I can't compare this cost with that of dental work in the US, but I struggle to believe that it would be a similar percentage compared to earnings.\n\nTerry Smith, Newmarket, UK\n\nI have lived in the US for over 30 years now, and I have to say that many Americans have teeth that are worse than any I ever encountered in England. I grew up in north west England, and my parents took my sister and me to the dentist on a regular basis, as did the parents of most other children of our age. We were by no means wealthy and went to NHS dentists. I had never seen teeth as rotten as some I saw in the US when I emigrated here. Not just the \"Bubba Teeth\" that were the stereotype of the American South where I live, some of the worst were in the mouths of people from the north (New York, Chicago, Detroit).\n\nReg Davies, Charlotte, USA\n\nMany of the comments by the yanks here are infuriating. I have been to the US a few times now and I've seen some pretty awful teeth there. In fact I'd say the worst set of gnashers I've ever seen were in the US - Atlanta, Georgia, to be precise. Although I do admit that the upper classes (such as our simpleton Royals) seem to have inexplicably wonky teeth - maybe down to centuries of inbreeding perhaps? In the UK we have good dental hygiene, but we don't overly worry about having the straightest teeth. When I was 13 I went to the orthodontist and had a brace fitted on my top teeth. After a year (I think) the braces were removed and the OD suggested I could have tracks fitted to my lower teeth as they were starting to crowd a bit. I WAS 13! Of course I wasn't going to opt to have another year of mouth-metal! And my parents certainly didn't try to push me into it either. It was my choice and that's that. I wish I'd chosen different now but I made plenty of other terrible decisions at 13. So I now have one tooth which sits further back in my mouth than its neighbours and you yanks think that means I'm disgusting? And that I have bad breath/gum disease/poor hygiene? I have 2 fillings and I'm 40. How many of you can claim the same? And don't give that crap that most Americans don't have corrective treatment. My sister in law is American and her whole family have had 'retainers'. Apart from her dad, who has wonky teeth. To Chris in Minneapolis who said \"Just because we didn't try to colonize the entire world with our culture...\" You are kidding right? Why do you think we all despise the yanks? And the British didn't try to colonise the world with our culture - we colonised it with big guns and excellent seamanship. However that was hundreds of years ago and we either lost or gave back the places we colonised/stole or invaded. We have a vast history compared to yours - we've been invaded and colonised ourselves too you know - and we've matured. The USA will too, we all hope, one day. The simple fact is this: Most of the rest of the world have worse LOOKING teeth than the Yanks and Aussies. However the Yanks just have this really weird inferiority complex about the Brits which makes us the target of most of their racial jokes. And finally, to those idiots who keep suggesting its genetics, this is proof positive that the yanks think they are a different, superior, species (cue all the comments from some immature Yanks claiming exactly that). Genetics? WTF? Those few who suggested that here are total morons. Can you please explain to me how 'superior' genetics could cause teeth to straighten and become miraculously white in less than a century? What, you evolve fast over there do you? And really finally, I actually love most of the Yanks I've met, and the country, but collectively you really are a pain in the ass (which is a donkey/pony hybrid, incidentally). And, just like us Brits, your government and your foreign policy really lets you down.\n\nMatt Hill, Richmond, Surrey, UK\n\nI think that Americans have set this standard of teeth being nice whether the face is nice or not. I've heard from many Americans say things about European people. Maybe European people and British people have more things to care about other than looks... Trust me, Americans have bad teeth but they get to fix them, maybe some Britons don't want to fix their teeth.\n\nAlex, Limassol, Cyprus\n\nTo all the insult-slinging British and Americans: Try to behave like adults! Resorting to stereotype-based insults is just pathetic of you. Not all British people have bad teeth (though some do), not all Americans are fat, stupid and vain (though some are). There are bad teeth in the USA, just as there are fat, stupid, vain people in the UK. The responses above certainly prove one thing both nations have in common: the ability to be idiotically childish over something of little importance.\n\nJen, Oregon, US\n\nI'm Scottish and very proud of that but I must admit that we Scots have the worst teeth in the developed world. It stems from bad diet and poor dental education. My fiancée who is black African comes from a very impoverished background but has the most perfect white teeth I've ever seen!. She hates my many missing teeth and it causes many an argument! Moral to the story: look after your teeth wherever you come from.\n\nGordon Campbell, Coylton, Scotland, UK\n\nWe recently hosted a Korean girl as an exchange student. Her front teeth were so big and stuck out so far that she could barely close her lips over her teeth. We live in a community where most every teen has braces. While she lived with us, my two children and myself were all in braces. Interestingly enough, guess what she did as soon as she returned to Korea? She was in braces within the month! I think she will be so much more attractive, have an easier time of eating politely, and have great career advantages with nice straight teeth.\n\nSarah, Dallas, US\n\n@Sarah. Yes because, heaven forbid, she should look like she hasn't had corrective surgery!\n\nMatt H, Richmond UK\n\nTo be completely honest, I hadn't even heard of this \"Brits with bad teeth\" stereotype until I stumbled upon this conversation. As a matter of fact, I NEVER hear ANYONE \"making fun\" of the British. If anything, people around here admire the British. I have no clue where this idea came from that Americans walk around thinking that we are better than everyone else; in my experience it's just not true. Now, let's stop slinging stereotypes, aight? I mean come on, people, it upsets me to see so many hurtful words on here, from both parties. Obviously both the US and UK and EVERY country on this planet have some sort of thing that they need to work on. So what? I really feel that in a \"modern\" and \"enlightened\" age we can finally learn to stop being asses to each other.\n\nKari Hicks, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States\n\nI don't know about British teeth, but one thing I know since I spent years in the US (Minneapolis and NY), is that American teeth ar far from being perfect! In fact, the Americans all having good teeth (or at least \"aesthetically correct\" in their view) is as much a cliché as the British having bad ones! I've encountered lots of people who had \"bad teeth\", and some who had \"nice\" ones too of course (well, their opinion of what are \"nice\" teeth is really subjective, I think it looks more extraterestrial than anything else, but that is not the question). But what is the most annoying is the American obsession about those kind of things! It really tells a lot about their culture and society, where appearance is so important. As if you could judge the value of someone by looking at her or his smile... Someone said on this forum that while talking to this American woman, she stopped him only to tell him how incredibly white his teeth were. That sums this up quite well! And a similar story happened to me one day too, I was grocery shopping with a friend of mine in Minneapolis and this girl came to me to tell me I had great teeth! I really did not know how to react or what to say, but one "
