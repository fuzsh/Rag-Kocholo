        "text": "I never bought a new Bigsby before... It has 3 little felt dots on the bottom and I assume that these are peeled off when it is mounted to the guitar permanently so it sits flush against the body. I have no expectations of ever not having a Bigsby on this guitar and I drilled the mount holes for it..\n\nAttachments\n\n20140416_224942.jpg\n\nThat looks sweet. Don't be afraid to squirt a liberal amount of graphite powder inside the roller bar on the Bigsby (and take the Bigsby off the body to do this).\n\nI like that color.... it's not too often that you see green used on a Tele. That neck looks real good, I have been waiting to find the right piece of Birdseye. I've enjoyed following your build!\n\nI like that color.... it's not too often that you see green used on a Tele. That neck looks real good, I have been waiting to find the right piece of Birdseye. I've enjoyed following your build!\n\nNo doubt. I've always fantasized about a green finish w gold hardware. Maybe Fastback green, or candy apple with a little metallic sparkle to snazzy it up a touch?\n\nGreat build Mike.\n\nI think the green is an excellent throw back to the Gretsch color schemes. And it just plain looks cool. You nailed this one Mike. Great job.\n\nThanks friends.\n\nI got home late from work last night and I didn't get much done... I have a gig tonight 7pm to 11pm at The Desert Eagle Brewery in Mesa and tomorrow afternoon 2pm to 6pm at The Spirit Room in Jerome. Jerome is a 2 1/2 hour drive each way but it is a really cool gig. I won't get back to this until Saturday night or Sunday.\n\nToday I wired up the pots and output jack. I used an old control plate to hold the pots the right distance apart. Drilled the screw holes for the electro socket and the back cover plate.\n\nAttachments\n\n20140420_154537.jpg\n\n20140420_155743.jpg\n\nI made the nut from a bone I buy at Petsmart. Sliced it up on the bandsaw and shaped it on the belt sander.\n\nAttachments\n\n20140420_212721.jpg\n\n20140420_215856.jpg"
