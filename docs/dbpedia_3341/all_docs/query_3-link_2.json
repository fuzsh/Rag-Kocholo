        "text": "The methamphetamine epidemic has led to a growing need for costly dental care. Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson joined House colleagues in introducing bi-partisan legislation, H.R. 1671, the Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, that will aid providers in combating this pandemic.\n\n\"The only chance we have to combat meth is through education,\" said Simpson. \"This bill will fund local, school-based initiatives to educate primary and elementary school students about what using meth will do to their teeth. Meth causes teeth to blacken, rot and fall apart - often meth users end up with no teeth at all and students need to hear this message.\"\n\nLittle is known about what actually causes meth mouth. Some have speculated that the drug's ability to dry the mouth and the tendency of users to grind and clench their teeth are factors. However, few peer reviewed studies have been published about its prevalence, its causes, its physical effects, or its cost to the public. H.R. 1671 will help answer some of these important questions."
