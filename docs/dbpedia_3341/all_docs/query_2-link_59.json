        "text": "By: Sean Luster\n\nOriginally from Kalispell, Montana, Michael Simpson, a COBE Signature Student, started out his education interested in medicine and even went to law school for a year. He ended up with his first degree in psychology from Pomona College in 2001, then, after serving in the Air Force, he decided to pursue an accounting degree which he will graduate with this spring.\n\nAfter graduation, Michael plans to continue his education by earning a master of accountancy-taxation and eventually working toward a CPA. Michael has always been numbers-oriented, but he also enjoys the people side of tax advisement. His father has 40 years of accounting taxation experience, so Michael could see career opportunities in Boise and also thought it was a great place to raise his kids.\n\nBeing a father and an older student with many life experiences under his belt, Michael contributes a different perspective to the classroom. The Henry Ford quote, “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t – you’re right,” resonates with Michael as he employs a can-do attitude in all that he does. He hopes that he has been able to positively add to the college experience of other students with that attitude."
