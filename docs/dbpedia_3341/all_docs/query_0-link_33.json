        "text": "Out of the office: Dr Simpson has a keen interest in sport and can be found riding his bike around Cheshire. Also he has been a lifelong Manchester City fan.\n\nJenny works alongside Lisa Guatella who joined the practice in 2006. Jenny and Lisa aim to provide a friendly atmosphere, putting patients at ease the moment they step through the door.\n\nOut of the office: Outside of work, Jenny is a dedicated mum to 4 young boys. She enjoys baking and days out with the family.\n\nDuring his career in the UK, Anand successfully cleared the MFDS exam from Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh, completed training in implant supported restorations and also went on to complete his Masters in Aesthetic and Restorative dentistry, with a well-earned distinction from the University of Manchester. He is currently a part time honorary teacher at the Manchester Dental School's Masters in the Advanced Restorative Dentistry programme. Anand enjoys all aspects of restorative dentistry, especially minimally invasive aesthetic treatments, and likes to promote prevention of dental diseases.\n\nOut of the office: Anand lives with his wife and two daughters. Apart from dentistry, Anand usually spends his time taxiing the girls to different classes and, when time permits, does what he loves: cooking, gardening, walking and reading.\n\nProfile: Olivia graduated from the University of Liverpool school in 2014. After graduating she spent 2 years in North Wales completing VT year and working in the Community Dental Service in Wrexham. She then covered maternity leave at Frodsham dental surgery before starting at Helsby in 2016. She has worked alongside Katy Rowe (GDC 270119) ever since then.\n\nOutside of work Olivia enjoys cooking and baking and spending time with her animals.\n\nJanet is the practice manager. She joined the team in 2004 and is a fully qualified nurse. Janet is also qualified in Management and Leadership. Dr Simpson describes her as his ‘right hand man’.\n\nGinnette Curry joined the team in 1996 and is a fully qualified nurse.\n\nAs the deputy manager, the role encompasses many aspects of the daily running of the practice that contributes to the friendly and professional service.\n\nOne of the best things about this practice is the care that goes into every visit with the dentist. My treatment is always explained fully and I am given a treatment plan. I feel very comfortable attending this practice as going to the dentist used to make me feel anxious. Since joining in 2014 I no longer feel anxious before appointments, I am always welcomed by the friendly reception staff."
