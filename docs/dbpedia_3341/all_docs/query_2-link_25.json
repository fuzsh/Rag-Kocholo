        "text": "Michael Simpson is a principal research associate in the Health Policy Center with 25 years of experience developing economic models and using survey and administrative data. His current work focuses on using Urban’s Health Insurance Policy Simulation Model to project health insurance coverage and spending both in the baseline and under policy alternatives. Before joining Urban, Simpson developed the Congressional Budget Office’s long-term dynamic microsimulation model. He analyzed numerous policy reform proposals, investigated differences between various projections of Social Security finances and benefits, quantified the importance of Monte Carlo variation in model results, and created multiple methods to demonstrate uncertainty in projections."
