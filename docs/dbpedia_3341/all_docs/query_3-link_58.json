He is an excellent cosmetic dentist. I was referred to him by my dentist in... New York, also an excellent cosmetic dentist. He heard I was moving to Colorado and immediately said “I know an incredibly skilled dentist in Denver you must see”. I have invested a lot of money in my teeth and feel confident that I am getting the best continued care with Dr RADZ. He is not cheap! But I am willing to pay for good care. I gave him four stars only because of the cost and because his dental assistant is less than friendly, though certainly polite. That may not matter to most people, but it does to me! As far care and skill, I don’t think there is anyone better than Dr RADZ.read more\n\nStephen Alderete\n\n17:50 22 Jul 21\n\nExceptional service from entering, to my exam, to a detailed explanation from Dr Kissinger and then back to reception... before departing from my appointment!
