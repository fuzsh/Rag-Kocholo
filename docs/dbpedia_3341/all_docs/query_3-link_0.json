        "text": "“February is National Children’s Dental Health Month, during which dentists and oral healthcare providers work together to raise awareness about the importance of oral health. As a part of their awareness efforts, dentists and dental hygienists from across the country and in Idaho join together and volunteer their time to provide free care to children.\n\n“As a dentist, I understand the need for children to receive proper dental care. This includes going to the dentist regularly for check-ups and treatment when problems arise. Oral health is critical to a person’s overall health and means more than healthy teeth. Research continues to show that many diseases and conditions show themselves in the mouth. For people who don’t have access to dental care, oral disease is almost 100% inevitable—and almost 100% preventable.\n\n“This is particularly heartbreaking when it affects our children. Children with poor oral health can have problems eating, sleeping properly, paying attention in school and even smiling, because they suffer constant pain. Unfortunately, many of us don’t realize the extent and severity of untreated dental disease in children.\n\n“In Idaho, over 35% of children lack dental insurance. More than 25% of elementary school-aged children in Idaho suffer from untreated tooth decay. If the problems go untreated, a child will often end up in a hospital emergency or operating room, which costs far more than a trip to the dentist.\n\n“To help provide children with better oral care, I have introduced two pieces of legislation. HR 1781, the Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2007, would improve access to dental care under the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). It also establishes several new grant programs aimed to increase access to oral health care services to our underserved children and children living in rural areas. It would also provide new support for school-based oral health literacy programs and school-linked dental sealant.\n\n“HR 2472, the Essential Oral Health Care Act of 2007 will improve the delivery of dental services in state Medicaid and SCHIP programs, provide grants for Community Dental Health Coordinator training programs and volunteer dental projects and provide tax credits for donated dental services.\n\n“We are fortunate to have the Caring Foundation in our state. This Idaho-based, non-profit organization that provides free dental care to low-income, uninsured children whose families cannot afford private coverage and receive no government assistance. It has already served over 8,000 children in Idaho and is continuing to reach out to other eligible children throughout the state.\n\n“Hundreds of Idaho dentists and oral healthcare providers donate their time and energy to help this cause, and I graciously thank them. While National Children’s Dental Health Month will not solve the issues of access to oral healthcare by itself, it is a great opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of oral health and provide care to our most important and vulnerable resource—our children.”"
