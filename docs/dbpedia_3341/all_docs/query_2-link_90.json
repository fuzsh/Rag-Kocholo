        "text": "RCAP and network partner RCAC recognize a member of Congress from their service territory who are exceptional allies of the RCAP Network and rural and Tribal communities across the U.S.\n\nWashington, D.C. (May 2, 2024) — The Rural Community Assistance Partnership Incorporated (RCAP) and its national network of six regional partners honored U.S. Representative Mike Simpson (R-ID-2) with the 2024 Congressional Champion Award for his outstanding service, dedication, and tireless advocacy on behalf of rural communities and small towns across the nation.\n\nOver the past 10 years, RCAP has provided technical assistance to more than 160 small and rural Idaho communities, enabling them access over $125 million in federal funds to address water and wastewater infrastructure needs through its network partner Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC), based in Sacramento, California.\n\nRCAC assisted 14 Idaho communities with their lead service line inventories during the past year, including some in the Congressman’s district, like Albion and Franklin.\n\n“As a kid growing up in rural Idaho, my town faced challenges with its water system, which impacted our access to safe drinking water and community health,” said Ari Neumann, RCAC Chief Impact & Policy Officer. “Throughout his career, Rep. Simpson has demonstrated a deep understanding of Idaho’s rural communities, their challenges and inherent value. We are grateful for his ongoing, strong commitment to programs that ensure rural Idahoans have access to safe drinking water.”\n\nEstablished in 2019, RCAP’s bipartisan congressional awards are given to policymakers who have gone above and beyond in supporting policies that support small communities and take actions to make it a reality. RCAP Congressional Champion Award recipients have shown themselves to be exceptional allies of the RCAP Network and the needs of rural America during their tenure as elected officials.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout RCAP\n\nRCAP is a national non-profit network providing opportunity, assistance, and practical guidance to small communities in all fifty states, the U.S. territories, and on Tribal lands to ensure access to safe drinking water, sanitary waste disposal, and economic prosperity for rural America. RCAP and its more than 350 technical assistance providers work together with rural communities and partners across the country to elevate rural voices and build long-term local capacity to improve quality of life, starting at the tap."
