        "text": "Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson has introduced a resolution recognizing community water fluoridation as an effective and important public health measure. This year marks the 70th anniversary of communities utilizing fluoridated water which helps strengthen teeth and prevent tooth decay.\n\n“The oral health community is in steadfast agreement that water fluoridation is a vitally important public health measure,” said Simpson. “Communities who have chosen this proactive measure receive improved oral health benefits for people of all ages.”\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service recommends adding fluoride to drinking water for its effectiveness in preventing tooth decay. The decision about whether to fluoridate public water supplies is always made at the local or state level.\n\n“Twenty-two years of practicing dentistry showed me firsthand the value of good oral health and the consequences of neglect, especially among children,” said Simpson. “That is why improving access to oral health care has been a top priority for me since coming to Congress. This resolution sheds light on a cost-effective measure that has helped improve the health of millions of Americans.”\n\nCommunity water fluoridation was recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. Water fluoridation has been proven to reduce tooth decay by 25% among children and adults, and school children on average have roughly 2 fewer decayed teeth compared with children who live in communities without fluoridated water. As of 2012, almost 75% of Americans who use public water supplies had access to optimally fluoridated water supplies.\n\nCongressman Simpson, co-chair of the Oral Health Caucus and a former dentist, introduced the resolution with a bipartisan group of cosponsors including two former dentists."
