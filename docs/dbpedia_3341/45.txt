WASHINGTON—Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson applauded the passage of H.R. 3843 – the reauthorization of the Action for Dental Health Act. Originally passed and signed into law in 2018, this bipartisan bill will continue support to organizations that provide oral health care to underserved populations, especially seniors and children living in rural communities, through Fiscal Year 2028. The Action for Dental Health Act is co-authored by Rep. Simpson and Rep. Robin Kelly (D-IL).

“Since its implementation, the Action for Dental Health Act has improved dental care in communities across the United States, strengthened the dental safety net, and brought disease prevention and education into underserved communities,” said Rep. Simpson, co-author of this bill. “This reauthorization is an essential step in continuing to address barriers to oral health care services that still exist, like tackling the oral health workforce issues and reducing the number of adults and children living with untreated dental diseases.

“As a former dentist in Blackfoot, Idaho, I know that the more we can provide patients with an early diagnosis, the better off our patients and our health care system will be. As co-chair of the Congressional Oral Health Caucus, I am proud to once again join Congresswoman Kelly in this effort. I am pleased to see the House of Representatives work in a bipartisan fashion by passing this crucial reauthorization.”
