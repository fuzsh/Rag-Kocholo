        "meta_description": "Tarikh e Babul Wa Nainawa (History of Babylon and Nineveh) is a history in Urdu of these two ancient cities. Babylon was founded early in the third millennium BC, at a site between the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, south of present-day Baghdad, Iraq. It became important under Hammurabi (ruled 1792--50 BC), was ruled by the Neo-Babylonian emperor Nebuchadnezzar II (circa 634--562 BC, reigned circa 605--562 BC), and was conquered by Alexander the Great in 331 BC. Nineveh was on the east bank of the Tigris in ancient Assyria, across the river from the modern city of Mosul, Iraq. Settlement at Nineveh first occurred by about 6000 BC, and by 2000 BC the city was a center of worship of the fertility goddess Ishtar. Sennacherib (ruled 704--681 BC) transformed Nineveh into a magnificent city with new streets, squares, and a canal system within a walled area and built a vast and splendid palace. After Nineveh fell to the Medes and Babylonians in 612 BC, the city was destroyed and never regained its earlier significance. Besides giving the early history of Babylon and Nineveh, the author details natural disasters and discusses the religious, socio-political, and cultural aspects of life in the two cities.",
