        "text": "The Ancient City of Nineveh is part of the Tentative list of Iraq in order to qualify for inclusion in the World Heritage List.\n\nNineveh comprises the remains of the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. It became the largest city in the world under King Sennacherib (c. 700 BC), with new streets and squares and the South West Palace. It was abandoned in 612 BC. Today, Nineveh's location is marked by two large mounds, Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus, and the remains of the city walls (about 12 kilometres in circumference) with five gateways."
