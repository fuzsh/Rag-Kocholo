        "text": "Irrigation Landscapes in the Heartland of the Assyrian Empire\n\nThe kings of the Assyrian Empire, particularly Sennacherib (ruled 704-688 BC), created huge irrigation systems to support their new capitals at Nimrud and Nineveh. Previous investigations of Assyrian landscapes have been limited to small soundings, opportunistic ground observation, and testimony from local residents, and since 1990 no fieldwork has been possible in northern Iraq. However, it has been possible to use aerial photography and declassified CORONA and KH-7 satellite photographs to map the traces in a Geographic Informations Systems (GIS) computer program. This research has identified and mapped over 60 km of canals across a wide swath of Assyria, many of which have never been recognized on the ground before.\n\nThe unexpected extent of Sennacherib's canals must be understood within the context of his other actions. Upon the death of his father, he moved the capital to the newly expanded city of Nineveh. As known from the Bible and his own inscriptions, he was a very prolific deporter of conquered populations; many of them were settled in his new capital but many others filled in the productive agricultural hinterland of the capital. It appears that the canals were part of a grand scheme to remake the demography of Assyria: a new capital was constructed and populated, and labor was imported and agricultural infrastructure was created to support it. Not all of the water went to mundane agriculture; Sennacherib's inscriptions also describe elaborate parks and gardens designed to emulate the wetter landscapes of Anatolia and Babylonia, which were undoubtedly fed by his canal network.\n\nCanals in the Hinterland of Nimrud\n\nThe canal from the Khazir/Upper Zab to the imperial capital at Nimrud.
