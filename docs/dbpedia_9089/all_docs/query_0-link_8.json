        "text": "Generations of bitter warfare characterize the history of the ancient Near East, and especially that of ancient Mesopotamia. In a concerted campaign to end Assyrian dominance Babylonia led an alliance in an attack in 612 bce against the Assyrian capital, Nineveh, the ruins of which are now surrounded by modern-day Mosul, Iraq. The city, whose heyday had come earlier in the 7th century under the leadership of King Sennacherib, was comprehensively sacked after a three-month siege, and Assyrian King Sinsharushkin was killed. Although his successors clung to power for a while, the days of Assyrian ascendancy were gone.\n\nIn the early centuries of the second millennium bce, Babylon had been the dominant power in Mesopotamia and the Middle East. Since then, the city had been increasingly marginalized. Its pride remained, and it had several times attempted to rise up against Assyrian domination, but it had never been close to succeeding. In 626 bce, however, a new king, Nabopolassar, sensed that the hold of Assyria’s rulers was weakening.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA History of War\n\nIt took Nabopolassar ten years to expel Assyrian forces from Babylonia itself, and in 616 bce he led an invasion of Assyria. By then, other discontent peoples were eager to enlist in the Babylonian cause, including several from what is now Iran. Soon, Nabopolassar was heading an army that included the people of Susa—a city-state in the foothills of the Zagros Mountains—and the Scythians, mounted nomads (and formidable cavalrymen) from the steppe. The Medes, a people from the plains of northwestern Iran, marched south to take the Assyrians’ original home city of Assur in 614 bce, after which they too struck an alliance with Nabopolassar.\n\nTogether, under Babylonian leadership, the allies, which now included Chaldeans, Aramites, and Lydians, moved against the Assyrian capital, Nineveh. Resistance was fierce, and it was three long months of fighting before it fell. The city was sacked, and Assyria’s King Sinsharushkin killed. Even then, the Assyrians rallied around a new, would-be ruler, Ashuruballit, but he was finally defeated in 608 bce in a battle in which an Egyptian army joined the Assyrian cause. In the aftermath of the destruction of Nineveh, Babylon emerged as the region’s strongest power, with further conquests let by King Nebuchadnezzar II. The siege is depicted in biblical accounts in the books of Nahum, Amos, Jonah, and 2 Kings, indicating Nineveh’s importance to ancient Israel.\n\nThe ruins of Nineveh were further deteriorated in 2014–16 following a campaign of attacks on the part of Islamic State in Iraq, determined to erase supposedly idolatrous images in the form of bas-relief sculptures, winged bulls, and other artifacts, some housed within the Mosul Museum.\n\nLosses: Unknown."
