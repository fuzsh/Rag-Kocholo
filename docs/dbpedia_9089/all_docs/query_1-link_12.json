It was the largest empire in the world at the time and covered much of modern-day Iraq, Syria, and parts of Iran, Turkey, and Egypt. The Neo-Assyrians were known for their military might, efficient administration, and innovative use of technology, including the development of siege warfare and the use of iron weapons. They also had a well-organised system of government, with a king who had absolute power and a bureaucracy that helped him govern.\n\nOne of the most notable achievements of the Neo-Assyrians was their expansion of the empire through military conquest. They employed a standing army, which was one of the largest and most well-trained in the ancient world. The army was divided into specialised units, such as archers, infantry, and charioteers, and was equipped with advanced weapons and tactics. The Neo-Assyrians also developed a reputation for their brutal treatment of conquered peoples, often employing mass deportations and massacres to ensure obedience.\n\nDespite their military might, the Neo-Assyrians were also known for their cultural achievements, particularly in the fields of art, literature, and science. They were great patrons of the arts and architecture, and built impressive structures such as the palace of King Sargon II at Dur-Sharrukin. They also produced great works of literature, including the epic of Gilgamesh, and made significant advances in science and medicine, with scholars producing important works on astronomy, mathematics, and the human body.\n\nMap of the area of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nPhoto: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Vorderasiatisches Museum, AusfÃ¼hrung: Christoph Forster, datalina\n\nSource: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum\n\nKings of Neo-Assyria Name Clickable\n\nImage Years Dates Comments Ashur-dan II 23 934 BC - 912 BC Ashur-Dan II, son of Tiglath Pileser II, was the earliest king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. He was best known for recapturing previously held Assyrian territory and restoring Assyria to its natural borders, from Tur Abdin (southeast Turkey) to the foothills beyond Arbel (Iraq). The reclaimed territory through his conquest was fortified with horses, ploughs, and grain stores. His military and economic expansions benefited four subsequent generations of kings that replicated his model. Ashur-Dan was the first king to conduct regular military campaigns in over a century. His military campaigns primarily focused on northern territories along mountainous terrain that made controlling it problematic. These areas were vital because they lay close to the Assyrian heartland and thus were vulnerable to enemy attacks. Adad-nirari II 21 911 BC - 891 BC Adad-nirari firmly subjugated the areas previously under only nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting troublesome Arameans. After subduing Neo-Hittite and Hurrian populations in the north, Adad-nirari II then twice attacked and defeated Shamash-mudammiq of Babylonia. He also campaigned to the west, subjugating the Aramean cities of Kadmuh and Nisibin. Along with vast amounts of treasure collected, he also secured the Kabur river region. His reign was a period of returning prosperity to the Middle East region following expansion of Phoenician and Aramaean trade routes, linking Anatolia, Egypt under the Libyan 22nd Dynasty, Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean. Tukulti-Ninurta II 7 890 BC - 884 BC Tukulti-Ninurta consolidated the gains made by his father over the Neo-Hittites, Babylonians and Arameans, and successfully campaigned in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, subjugating the newly arrived Iranian peoples of the area, the Persians and Medes, during his brief reign. Tukulti-Ninurta II was victorious over Ammi-Ba'al, the king of Bit-Zamani, and then entered into a treaty with him, as a result of which Bit-Zamani became an ally, and in fact a vassal of Assyria. Tukulti-Ninurta II developed both Nineveh and Assur, in which he improved the city walls, built palaces and temples and decorated the gardens with scenes of his military achievements. Ashurnasirpal II 25 883 BC - 859 BC During his reign he embarked on a vast program of expansion, first conquering the peoples to the north in Asia Minor as far as Nairi and exacting tribute from Phrygia, then invading Aram (modern Syria), conquering the Aramaeans and Neo-Hittites between the Khabur and the Euphrates Rivers. His harshness prompted a revolt that he crushed decisively in a pitched, two-day battle. The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth and art. He was renowned for his brutality, using enslaved captives to build a new Assyrian capital at Kalhu (Nimrud) in Mesopotamia where he built many impressive monuments. He was also a shrewd administrator, who realised that he could gain greater control over his empire by installing Assyrian governors, rather than depending on local client rulers paying tribute. Shalmaneser III 35 858 BC - 824 BC Shalmaneser III expanded the Assyrian Empire to include parts of modern-day Turkey, Iran, and Syria. He was known for his military campaigns, which he recorded on the Black Obelisk, a monument that lists the kings he defeated and tribute he received. One of Shalmaneser's most significant military campaigns was against the state of Urartu, located in modern-day Armenia. He attacked Urartu several times, almost every year of his reign, and eventually defeated the Urartian king Sarduri II in 843 BC. Shalmaneser also campaigned against the Aramaean states, including Damascus and Israel. He besieged Damascus twice but was unable to capture it. However, his campaigns weakened the Aramaean states and allowed Assyria to gain control over them. Shalmaneser was also known for his building projects, including the construction of the Central Palace at Nimrud. The palace was decorated with reliefs depicting scenes from Shalmaneser's military campaigns and showed his power and authority as the king of Assyria. He also built several temples in his honour, including the temple of Ninurta at Kalhu. Shamshi-Adad V 13 823 BC - 811 BC The first years of Shamshi-Adad's reign saw a serious struggle for the succession of the aged Shalmaneser. The revolt was led by Shamshi-Adad's brother Assur-danin-pal, and had broken out already by 826 BC. The rebellious brother, according to Shamshi-Adad's own inscriptions, succeeded in bringing to his side 27 important cities, including Nineveh. The rebellion lasted until 820 BC, weakening the Assyrian empire and its ruler. Later in his reign, Shamshi-Adad campaigned against Southern Mesopotamia, and signed a treaty with the Babylonian king Marduk-zakir-shumi I. In 814 BC, he won the Battle of Dur-Papsukkal against the Babylonian king Marduk-balassu-iqbi, and a few Aramean tribes settled in Babylonia. The extent of Shamshi-Adad's victory was such that he obtained the submission of the Babylonian king and, after obtaining booty from several Babylonian cities, he returned to Assyria with palace treasures and sacred statues of gods. Adad-nirari II 28 810 BC - 783 BC Adad-nirari's youth at the time of his ascension to the throne, and the struggles his father had faced early in his reign, caused a serious weakening of Assyrian rulership over their indigenous Mesopotamia, and made way for the ambitions of officers, governors, and local rulers. He led several military campaigns with the purpose of regaining the strength Assyria enjoyed in the times of his grandfather Shalmaneser III. He was the builder of the temple of Nabu at Nineveh. Among his actions was a siege of Damascus in the time of Ben-Hadad III in 796 BC, which led to the eclipse of the Aramaean Kingdom of Damascus and allowed the recovery of Israel under Jehoash (who paid the Assyrian king tribute at this time) and Jeroboam II. Despite Adad-nirari's vigour, Assyria entered a several decades long period of weakness following his death. Shalmaneser IV 10 782 BC - 773 BC The accession of Shalmaneser IV marks the beginning of an obscure period in Assyrian history, from which little information survives. This period also extends throughout the reigns of his two immediate successors, his brothers Ashur-dan III and Ashur-nirari V. By the end of Adad-nirari III's reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was declining. In particular, the power of the king himself was being threatened due to the emergence of extraordinarily powerful officials, whom while they accepted the authority of the Assyrian monarch in practice acted with supreme authority themselves and began to issue their own inscriptions, similar to those of the kings. This arrangement continued during the reign of Shalmaneser and his immediate successors, a time from which inscriptions from such officials are more common than inscriptions by the kings themselves. At the same time, the enemies of Assyria grew stronger and more threatening. This period of Assyrian decline coincided with the peak of the northern Kingdom of Urartu. Ashur-dan III 18 772 BC - 755 BC Ashur-dan ruled during a period of Assyrian decline from which few sources survive. As such, his reign, other than the broad political developments, is poorly known. At this time, the Assyrian officials were becoming increasingly powerful relative to the king and at the same time, Assyria's enemies were growing more dangerous. Ashur-dan's reign was a particularly difficult one as he was faced with two outbreaks of plague and five of his eighteen years as king were devoted to putting down revolts. Ashur-nirari V 10 754 BC - 745 BC Like his predecessor, Ashur-nirari ruled during a period of Assyrian decline from which few sources survive. An unusually small share of Ashur-nirari's reign was devoted to campaigns against foreign enemies, perhaps suggesting domestic political instability within Assyria. In 746 or 745 BC, there are records of a revolt in Nimrud, the Assyrian capital. Tiglath-pileser III 18 744 BC - 727 BC Tiglath-pileser was one of the most prominent and historically significant Assyrian kings. He ended a period of Assyrian stagnation, introduced numerous political and military reforms and more than doubled the lands under Assyrian control. Because of the massive expansion and centralisation of Assyrian territory and establishment of a standing army, some researchers consider Tiglath-Pileser's reign to mark the true transition of Assyria into an empire. The reforms and methods of control introduced under Tiglath-Pileser laid the groundwork for policies enacted not only by later Assyrian kings but also by later empires for millennia after his death. Tiglath-Pileser early on increased royal power and authority through curbing the influence of prominent officials and generals. After securing some minor victories in 744 and 743, he defeated the Urartian king Sarduri II in battle near Arpad in 743. After defeating Sarduri, Tiglath-Pileser turned his attention to the Levant. Over the course of several years, Tiglath-Pileser conquered most of the Levant, defeating and then either annexing or subjugating previously influential kingdoms, notably ending the kingdom of Aram-Damascus. Tiglath-Pileser's activities in the Levant were recorded in the Hebrew Bible. After a few years of conflict, Tiglath-Pileser conquered Babylonia in 729, becoming the first king to rule as both king of Assyria and king of Babylon. Shalmaneser V 5 726 BC - 722 BC Shalmaneser campaigned extensively in the lands west of the Assyrian heartland, warring not only against the Israelites, but also against the Phoenician city-states and against kingdoms in Anatolia. Though he successfully annexed some lands to the Assyrian Empire, his campaigns resulted in long and drawn-out sieges lasting several years, some being unresolved at the end of his reign. The circumstances of his deposition and death are not clear, though they were likely violent, and it is unlikely that Sargon II was his legitimate heir. It is possible that Sargon II was entirely unrelated, which would make Shalmaneser V the final king of the Adaside dynasty, which had ruled Assyria for almost a thousand years. Sargon II 17 721 BC - 705 BC Modelling his reign on the legends of the ancient rulers Sargon of Akkad, from whom Sargon II likely took his regnal name, and Gilgamesh, Sargon aspired to conquer the known world, initiate a golden age and a new world order, and be remembered and revered by future generations. Over the course of his seventeen-year reign, Sargon substantially expanded Assyrian territory and enacted important political and military reforms. An accomplished warrior-king and military strategist, Sargon personally led his troops into battle. By the end of his reign, all of his major enemies and rivals had been either defeated or pacified. Among Sargon's greatest accomplishments were the stabilisation of Assyrian control over the Levant, the weakening of the northern kingdom of Urartu, and the reconquest of Babylonia. From 717 to 707, Sargon constructed a new Assyrian capital named after himself, Dur-Sharrukin ('Fort Sargon'), which he made his official residence in 706. Sennacherib 24 704 BC - 681 BC The second king of the Sargonid dynasty, Sennacherib is one of the most famous Assyrian kings for the role he plays in the Hebrew Bible, which describes his campaign in the Levant. (II Kings, II Chronicles, and Isaiah). Although Sennacherib was one of the most powerful and wide-ranging Assyrian kings, he faced considerable difficulty in controlling Babylonia, which formed the southern portion of his empire. Because Babylon, had been the target of most of his military campaigns and had caused the death of his son, Sennacherib destroyed the city in 689 BC. Sennacherib transferred the capital of Assyria to Nineveh, where he had spent most of his time as crown prince. To transform Nineveh into a capital worthy of his empire, he launched one of the most ambitious building projects in ancient history. He expanded the size of the city and constructed great city walls, numerous temples and a royal garden. His most famous work in the city is the Southwest Palace, which Sennacherib named his 'Palace without Rival'. In 681 BC, he was murdered by two of his sons who hoped to seize the throne, but another son, Esarhaddon raised an army and seized Nineveh, installing himself as king as intended by Sennacherib. Esarhaddon 12 680 BC - 669 BC Esarhaddon is most famous for his conquest of Egypt in 671 BC, which made his empire the largest the world had ever seen, and for his reconstruction of Babylon, which had been destroyed by his father. After a very difficult ascension to the throne, Esarhaddon was plagued by paranoia and mistrust for his officials, governors and male family members until the end of his reign. As a result of this paranoia, most of the palaces used by Esarhaddon were high-security fortifications located outside of the major population centres of the cities. Also perhaps resulting from his mistrust for his male relatives, Esarhaddon's female relatives, such as his mother NaqiÊ¾a and his daughter Serua-eterat, were allowed to wield considerably more influence and political power during his reign than women had been allowed in any previous period of Assyrian history. Despite a relatively short and difficult reign, and being plagued by paranoia, depression and constant illness, Esarhaddon remains recognised as one of the greatest and most successful Assyrian kings. He quickly defeated his brothers in 680, completed ambitious and large-scale building projects in both Assyria and Babylonia, successfully campaigned in Media, the Arabian Peninsula, Anatolia, the Caucasus, and the Levant, defeated and conquered Lower Egypt, and ensured a peaceful transition of power to his Ashurbanipal after his death. Ashurbanipal 38 668 BC - 631 BC Ashurbanipal is generally remembered as the last great king of Assyria. Inheriting the throne as the favoured heir of his father Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal's 38-year reign was among the longest of any Assyrian king. Though sometimes regarded as the apogee of ancient Assyria, his reign also marked the last time Assyrian armies waged war throughout the ancient Near East and the beginning of the end of Assyrian dominion over the region. Much of the early years of Ashurbanipal's reign was spent fighting rebellions in Egypt, which had been conquered by his father. Much of Ashurbanipal's late reign is poorly known. Ashurbanipal is chiefly remembered today for his cultural efforts. A patron of artwork and literature, Ashurbanipal was deeply interested in the ancient literary culture of Mesopotamia. Over the course of his long reign, Ashurbanipal utilised the massive resources at his disposal to construct the Library of Ashurbanipal, a collection of texts and documents of various different genres. Perhaps comprising over 100 000 texts at its height, the Library of Ashurbanipal was not surpassed until the construction of the Library of Alexandria. Ashur-etil-ilani 8 630 BC - 623 BC The spread of inscriptions by Ashur-etil-ilani in Babylonia suggest that he exercised the same amount of control in the southern provinces as his father Ashurbanipal had, having a vassal king (Kandalanu) but exercising actual political and military power there himself. His inscriptions are known from all the major cities, including Babylon, Dilbat, Sippar and Nippur. Too few inscriptions of Ashur-etil-ilani survive to make any certain assumptions about his character. Excavations of his palace at Kalhu, one of the more important cities in the empire and a former capital, may indicate that he was less boastful than his father as it had no reliefs or statues similar to those that his predecessors had used to illustrate their strength and success. There are no records of AÅ¡Å¡ur-etil-ilÄni ever conducting a military campaign or going on a hunt. His Kalhu palace was quite small with unusually small rooms by Assyrian royal standards. Sin-shar-ishkun 11 622 BC - 612 BC On taking the throne, Sin-shar-ishkun was immediately faced by the revolt of one of his brother's chief generals, who attempted unsuccessfully to usurp the throne for himself. This failed attempt on the throne contributed to instability, and Sin-shar-ishkun lost control of Babylonia to Nabopolassar, who consolidated his power and formed the Neo-Babylonian Empire, restoring Babylonian independence after more than a century of Assyrian rule. This Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the newly formed Median Empire under Cyaxares, then invaded the Assyrian heartland. In 614 BC, the Medes captured and sacked Assur, the ceremonial and religious heart of the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC their combined armies attacked, brutally sacked, and razed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital. What doomed Assyria might have been the lack of an effective defensive plan for the Assyrian heartland, which had not been invaded in five hundred years, combined with having to face an enemy which aimed to outright destroy Assyria rather than simply conquer it. Ashur-uballit II 3 612 BC - 609 BC Ashur-uballit II was the final ruler of Assyria, ruling from his predecessor Sin-shar-ishkun's death at the Fall of Nineveh in 612 BC to his own defeat at Harran in 609 BC. He was possibly the son of Sin-shar-ishkun and likely the same person as a crown prince mentioned in inscriptions at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh in 626 and 623 BC. Over the course of Sin-shar-ishkun's reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had been irreversibly weakened. However, Ashur-uballit rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at Harran where, bolstered by an alliance with Egypt, he ruled for three years. His identification as 'king of Assyria' comes from Babylonian sources. Contemporary Assyrian inscriptions suggest that the Assyrians saw Ashur-uballit as their legitimate ruler, but continued to refer to him as 'crown prince' seeing as he could not undergo the traditional Assyrian coronation ceremony at Assur and thus hadn't formally been bestowed with the kingship by the Assyrian chief deity, Ashur. His rule at Harran came to an end when the city was seized by Medo-Babylonian forces in 610 BC. Ashur-uballit's attempt at retaking it in 609 BC was repulsed whereafter he is no longer mentioned in contemporary chronicles, signalling the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy.\n\nTable of Neo-Assyrian Kings, adapted from various sources, including cdli.ox.ac.uk and Wikipedia.\n\nKing Ashur-dan II\n\nMap of Assyria 1392 CC - 934 BC\n\nThis map shows the extent of the Assyrian Empire when King Ashur-dan II came to the throne.

The stela consists of a small boulder, on one face of which a fiat panel has been sunk, leaving figures and symbols standing out within it in low relief. The greater part of the inscription has been carved upon the flat surface of the panel, but the last seven lines extend below the panel to the base of the stone.\n\nThe stela is set up in honour of Adad-etir, the dagger-bearer of Marduk, by his eldest son. The name Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, which occurs in l. 4, is that of Adad-etir's son, not the name of the king to whom Adad-etir owed allegiance; and the two figures standing on the lower ledge of the panel represent Adad-etir and his eldest son, not Adad-etir and the king. The stele is closely related to a kudurru, since it is protected by carved symbols and by the addition of imprecatory clauses to the text. These symbols include (1) winged solar disc; (2) crescent; and (3) lion-headed mace upon a pedestal.\n\nFindspot: Marduk Temple (Babylon)\n\nDiameter 127 mm, height 380 mm, thickness 127 mm, width 270 mm.\n\nInscription translation of cuneiform: (1) (This) image of Adad-etir, the dagger-bearer of Marduk, (2) adorned by Sin, Shamash, and Nergal, (3) who fears Nabu and Marduk, who owes allegiance (4) to the king, his lord, Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, (5) his eldest son, has fashioned, (6) and for future days, (7) for his seed and his posterity, (8) has set up.

The figures represent father and son together, and their shaven heads show that they are both priests, it being normal in ancient Mesopotamia for a son to adopt his father's profession\n\nThere are three divine symbols above the two priests: a winged solar disc representing the sun-god Shamash, a crescent of the moon-god Sin and a lion-headed mace on a pedestal.\n\nThe cuneiform inscription includes curses on anyone who may deface the stela. It translates: 'May Marduk, the great lord, in anger look upon him, and his name and his seed may he cause to disappear. May Nabu, the scribe of all, curtail the number of his days. But may the man who protects it be satisfied with the fullness of life.'\n\nSince the fourth line of the inscription, taken from its context, contains the words 'the king his lord Marduk-balatsu-ikbi,' the stele has been traditionally assigned to the reign of Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, king of Babylon about 830 B.C.\n\nThat the two figures do not represent Adad-etir paying homage to his king is sufficiently obvious, from the absence of any royal headdress and other royal insignia from the taller figure. Further, the phrase 'ka-rib Å¡arri-Å¡u' is simply a descriptive title, on a par with 'si-mat (ilu)Sin (ilu)Å amaÅ¡ u (ilu)Nergal' and 'pa-liá¸« (ilu)NabÃ» u (ilu)Marduk'; the three phrases describe Adad-etir's personal endowments and his correct attitude towards divine and human authority. The writer merely refers to Adad-etir's loyalty: the name of the reigning king is immaterial and is therefore omitted.\n\nOn the other hand, Adad-etir's eldest son, who set up the stele as an act of piety, was not likely to omit his own name; and in the sculptured figures he represents himself paying homage to his father. It may be noted that the figures are dressed precisely alike, the only difference being that the father is taller than the son. Each raises one hand and rests the other on the handle of the dagger in his belt.\n\nThis stela comes from the Temple of Marduk in Babylon. It is a commemorative monument set up in honour of a private individual called Adad-etir. He was an official in the temple, known as 'the dagger bearer', and this stela was erected by his son Marduk-balassu-iqbi. The figures carved in relief on the front represent the father and son together. Their shaven heads show that they are both priests, it being normal in ancient Mesopotamia for a son to adopt his father's profession. There are three divine symbols above the two priests: a winged solar disc representing the sun-god Shamash, a crescent of the moon-god Sin and a lion-headed mace on a pedestal.\n\nAssociated names:\n\nNamed in inscription: Adad-Etir (temple official)\n\nNamed in inscription: Marduk-balassu-iqbi (Dedicator of stela)\n\nNamed in inscription: Marduk\n\nNamed in inscription: Nabu\n\nNamed in inscription: Sin\n\nNamed in inscription: Shamash\n\nAssociated places\n\nNamed in inscription: Marduk Temple (Babylon)\n\nAsia: Middle East: Iraq: Iraq, South: Marduk Temple (Babylon)\n\nCatalog: Diorite or granite, ME 90834\n\nPhoto: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nSource: Original, British Museum\n\nText: © Card with the display at the British Museum, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nKing Tukulti-Ninurta II\n\nReign of King Tukulti-Ninurta II (890 BC - 884 BC)\n\nWall-tile\n\nGlazed wall-tile of fired clay showing a charioteer.

It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as the largest city in the world for several decades. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country's Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.\n\nIt was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, Persians, Scythians and Cimmerians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of a Christian bishop. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 13th century AD.\n\nIts ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul, in Iraq's Nineveh Governorate. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell NabÄ« YÅ«nus, site of a shrine to Jonah, the prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large amounts of Assyrian sculpture and other artifacts have been excavated there, and are now located in museums around the world.\n\nPhoto: Layard (1853) from a sketch by James Fergusson (1808â1886)\n\nProximal source: New York Public Library\n\nText: Wikipedia\n\nRestoration of a hall in an Assyrian Palace.\n\nPhoto: Layard (1849)\n\nProximal source: New York Public Library\n\nNineveh - Mashki Gate\n\nThe reconstructed Mashki Gate of Nineveh.

Large quantities of such ivory works were excavated in special store rooms in Nimrud, particularly in Fort Shalmaneser. This inlay displays a typical Egyptian motif, which may be related to Hathor, the Egyptian goddess who often took the form of a cow and suckled royal infants.

From Nimrud.\n\nThis protective spirit guarded the entrance into what may have been a banquet hall.\n\nFrom the ninth to the seventh century B.C., the kings of Assyria ruled over a vast empire centered in northern Iraq. The great Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (reigned 883â859 BC), undertook a vast building program at Nimrud, ancient Kalhu. Until it became the capital city under Ashurnasirpal, Nimrud had been no more than a provincial town.\n\nThe new capital occupied an area of about nine hundred acres, around which Ashurnasirpal constructed a mudbrick wall that was 120 feet thick, 42 feet high, and five miles long. In the southwest corner of this enclosure was the acropolis, where the temples, palaces, and administrative offices of the empire were located. In 879 BC Ashurnasirpal held a festival for 69 574 people to celebrate the construction of the new capital, and the event was documented by an inscription that read: 'the happy people of all the lands together with the people of Kalhu â for ten days I feasted, wined, bathed, and honoured them and sent them back to their homes in peace and joy.'\n\nThe so-called Standard Inscription that ran across the surface of most of the reliefs described Ashurnasirpal's palace: 'I built thereon [a palace with] halls of cedar, cypress, juniper, boxwood, teak, terebinth, and tamarisk as my royal dwelling and for the enduring leisure life of my lordship.' The inscription continues: 'Beasts of the mountains and the seas, which I had fashioned out of white limestone and alabaster, I had set up in its gates. I made it [the palace] fittingly imposing.'\n\nAmong such stone beasts is the human-headed, winged lion (lamassu) pictured here.

Occasionally, on narrow panels, part of the text was omitted. Otherwise there was no significant variation and the catalogue of royal titles, claims and achievements was simply repeated over and over again.\n\nPalace of Ashurnasirpal, priest of Ashur, favourite of Enlil and Ninurtya, beloved of Anu and Dagan, the weapon of the great gods, the mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria; son of Tukulti-Ninurta, the great king, the mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria; the valiant man, who acts with the support of Ashur, his lord, and has no equal among the princes of the four quarters of the world; the wonderful shepherd who is not afraid of battle; the great flood which none can oppose; the king who makes those who makes those who are not subject to him submissive; who has subjugated all mankind; the mighty warrior who treads on the neck of his enemies, tramples down all foes, and shatters the forces of the proud; the king who acts with the support of the great gods, and whose hand has conquered all lands, who has subjugated all the mountains and received their tribute, taking hostages and establishing his power over all countries.\n\nWhen Ashur, the lord who called me by name and has made my kingdom great, entrusted his merciless weapon to my lordly arms, I overthrew the widespread troops of the land of Lullume in battle. With the assistance of Shamash and Adad, the gods who help me, I thundered like Adad the destroyer over troops of the Nairi lands, Habhi, Shubaru, and Nirib. I am the king who has brought into submission at his feet the lands from beyond the Tigris to Mount Lebanon and the Great Sea (the Mediterranean), the whole of the land of Laqe, the land of Suhi as far as Rapiqu, and whose hand has conquered from the source of the river Subnat to the land of Urartu.\n\nThe area from the mountain passes of Kirruri to the land of Gilzanu, from beyond the Lower Zab to the city of Til-sha-Zabdani, Hirimu and Harutu, fortresses of the land of Karduniash (Babylonia), I have restored to the borders of my land. From the mountain passes of Babite to the land of Hashmar I have counted the inhabitants of my land. Over the lands which I have subjugated I have appointed my governors, and they do obeisance.\n\nI am Ashurnasirpal, the celebrated prince, who reveres the great gods, the fierce dragon, conqueror of the cities and mountains to their furthest extent, king of rulers who has tamed the stiff-necked peoples, who is crowned with splendour, who is not afraid of battle, the merciless champion who shakes resistance, the glorious king, the shepherd, the protection of the whole world, the king, the word of whose mouth destroys mountains and seas, who by his lordly attack has forced fierce and merciless kings from the rising to the setting sun to acknowledge one rule.\n\nThe former city of Kalhu (Nimrud) which Shalmaneser king of Assyria, a prince who preceded me, had built, that city had fallen into ruins and lay deserted. That city I built anew. I took the peoples from whom my hand had conquered from the lands which I had subjugated, from the land of Suhi, from the whole of the land of Laqe, from the city of Sirqu on the other side of the Euphrates, from the furthest extent of the land of Zamua, from teh Bit-Adini and the land of Hatte, and from Lubarna, king of the island of Patina, and made them settle there.\n\nI removed the ancient mound and dug down to the water level. I sank the foundations 120 brick courses deep. A palace with walls of cedar, cypress, juniper, box-wood, meskannu-wood (Dalbergia sissoo, terbinth (Pistacia terebinthus) and tamarisk, I founded my royal residence for my lordly pleasure forever.\n\nCreatures of the mountains and seas I fashioned in white limestone and alabaster, and set them up at its gates. I adorned it, and made it glorious, and set ornamental knobs of bronze around it. I fixed doors of cedar, cypress, juniper and meskannu-wood in its gates. I took in great quantities, and placed there, silver, gold, tin, bronze and iron, booty taken by my hands from the lands which I had conquered.\n\nText above: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, Â© Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nPlan of the citadel of Nimrud.\n\nRephotography: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nSource and text: Poster with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, Â© Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nThe Citadel of Nimrud.\n\nRendering of the citadel at Nimrud, extracted from the virtual world of the citadel created by Learning Sites; inset is a traditional plan of the same site.\n\nPhoto: © 2015 Learning Sites, Inc.\n\nSource: Sanders (2015)\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nWinged human headed bull.\n\nAssyrian, about 883 - 859 BC.

The sculptures above are from the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (reigned 883â859 BC), a king whose military expeditions to the west reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, and helped lay the foundations for an empire that came to dominate the Near Eastern political landscape from the ninth through seventh centuries B.C. The king himself is depicted on one of the reliefs (32.143.4). Ashurnasirpal moved from the traditional Assyrian capital, Ashur, to Nimrud, and there built a new and spectacular palace, today called the Northwest Palace for its position on the siteâs citadel. Texts survive describing the palaceâs completion and inauguration, involving a banquet for almost 70 000 people. The number is probably exaggerated, but there is no doubt that this was a huge festival.\n\nLike most ancient Near Eastern palaces, the Northwest Palace was made of mud brick. Ashurnasirpal seems to have been the first Assyrian king to line his palace walls with stone bas-reliefs, and his inscriptions boast of finding and utilising the stone that made it possible. This stone, which could be quarried locally, is a gypsum, sometimes called alabaster (it is almost white when first cut) and colloquially known as 'Mosul marble' after the nearby modern city. The slabs are extremely heavy, and simply quarrying and transporting the stone for use in the palace was a major undertaking. Once in position, the carving of the reliefs, with their carefully modelled figures and perfectly smooth backgrounds, represented another enormous task. An inscription describing the kingâs achievements, today called the Standard Inscription was carved across the centre of each panel. It seems likely that the repetition of the inscription, like that of the reliefsâ imagery, formed part of the magical protection of the palace and the king. Finally, the reliefs were brightly painted. Some pigment can still be seen in rare cases (31.72.1), and analysis of microscopic traces can sometimes reveal the original colours even when no paint is visible. Many of the figures in the reliefs wear clothes with embroidered patterns, rendered on the stone as fine engraving (1982.1188.4); these would originally have been picked out in contrasting colours.\n\nMap of the central area of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nPhoto: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Vorderasiatisches Museum, AusfÃ¼hrung: Christoph Forster, datalina\n\nSource: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nSpirit\n\n865 BC - 860 BC\n\nGypsum wall panel relief, of a winged human-headed horned protective spirit with right hand raised and a branch in the left hand, facing right.

The relief shows the king, standing on a light hunting chariot, which is guided by a charioteer and pulled by three horses. Three arrows have hit the lion. The King once again aims an arrow at the lion. The lion has turned its head back and seems to roar at its attacker in pain. The royal lion hunt is a symbol of the King overcoming the dangers and challenges to the Assyrian state by its ruler.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is in the initially coloured bas-relief of detail, such as in hunting chariots and weapons, as well as in the richly decorated horses with their teeth.\n\nThis section of the relief is only the lower part of a three-walled wall relief, the total height of which was about 2300 mm.\n\nWhile the upper register with another narrative relief is lost, only a few remnants of two lines of cuneiform have been preserved from the middle register, which bore the kingâs standard inscription.\n\nAn almost identical representation, now in the British Museum in London, shows the bow-shooting king, who has just killed a male lion.\n\nNimrud has been one of the primary sources of Assyrian sculpture, including the famous palace reliefs.\n\nA series of the distinctive Assyrian shallow reliefs were removed from the palaces, and sections are now found in several museums, in particular, the British Museum and the Pergamon Museums. These show scenes of hunting, warfare, ritual, and processions. There are about two dozen sets of scenes of lion hunting in surviving Assyrian palace reliefs.\n\nNeo-Assyrian palaces were very extensively decorated with such reliefs, carved in shallow reliefs on slabs that are mostly of gypsum alabaster, which was plentiful in northern Iraq. Other animals were also shown being hunted, and the main subject for narrative reliefs was the war campaigns of the king who built the palace. Other reliefs showed the king, his court, and 'winged genie' and lamassu protective minor deities.\n\nNimrud is an ancient Assyrian city located 30 kilometres (20 mi) south of the city of Mosul, in the Nineveh plains in Upper Mesopotamia. It was a major Assyrian city between about 1350 BC and 610 BC. The city is located in strategic position north of the point that the river Tigris meets its tributary, the Great Zab.\n\nIn the mid 19th century, biblical archaeologists proposed the Biblical name of Kalhu (Calah), based on a description in Genesis 10. The city gained fame when king Ashurnasirpal II (883â859 BC) of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911â605 BC) made it his capital at the expense of Assur. He built a large palace and temples in the city, which fell into disrepair during the Bronze Age Collapse of the mid-11th to mid-10th centuries BC.\n\nArchaeological excavations at the site began in 1845, and many vital artifacts were discovered, with most being moved to museums in Iraq and abroad. Historical artefacts from Nimrud can now be found in over 76 museums worldwide, including 36 in the United States and 13 in the United Kingdom. In 2015, the terrorist organization, the IslÄmic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), destroyed much of the site. The excavated remains were damaged because of its Assyrian history.\n\nThe relief from the western wing of the so-called Northwest Palace of the royal residence in Kalchu (today Nimrud/Iraq) is only the lower part of a three-register wall relief, the total height of which was approx. 2300 mm. The king is depicted standing on a light hunting chariot, which is led by a driver and drawn by three horses.\n\nHeight 970 mm, width 1830 mm, depth 110 mm, weight 555 kg.\n\nCatalog: Gypsum alabaster, Nimrud, VA 00959\n\nPhoto: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nSource: Pergamon Museum, Berlin, www.smb-digital.de/\n\nPermalink: id.smb.museum/object/1743971/relief-mit-darstellung-einer-l%C3%B6wenjagd\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nWall panel; gypsum alabaster relief from the North West Palace of Nimrud.\n\nCirca 883 BC - 859 BC.\n\nGypsum alabaster wall panel depicting a protective spirit in relief: this figure, a man with wings like an angel, is a protective spirit, probably an 'apkallu'. He carries a goat and a giant ear of corn ( i.e. wheat or barley - Don ), possibly symbolic of fertility though their precise significance is uncertain.\n\nHe wears a kilt with long tassels hanging from it, indicating his semi-divine status, and a fringed robe, embroidered with clusters of dates, which is drawn round the body and thrown over his shoulder, leaving the right leg exposed. There are sandals on his feet. A bead necklace round his neck is held in position by a tassel at the back. His armlets have animal-head terminals, and there are rosettes on his wristlets and on his diadem.\n\nHe has the magnificent curled moustache and long curled beard and hair typical of ninth-century figures. The musculature of his leg is exaggeratedly drawn, with a prominent vein encircling his ankle.\n\nAcross his body runs the standard inscription. This was incised after the carving of the figure was complete, and it cuts through some of the fine details of decoration on the dress.\n\nHeight 224 cm, width 127 cm, thickness 12 cm.\n\nThis figure was probably one of a pair which guarded an entrance into the private quarters of the king. It was previously described on a label as from Room Z rather than T.\n\nShipped by the excavator, Sir Austen Henry Layard, on the 'Apprentice'; arrived January 1849.\n\nCatalog: Gypsum alabaster, pigmented, Nimrud, BM/Big number 124561\n\nPhoto: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nSource: Original, British Museum\n\nText: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, Â© Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nTribute Bearers\n\nCirca 883 BC - 859 BC.\n\nGypsum wall panel relief from the North West Palace of Nimrud, carved and showing tribute bearers. One has a North West Syrian type turban and raises clenched hands in token of submission; the second may be Phoenician and brings a pair of apes.\n\nThere is an inscription written in cuneiform script with partial white infilling in some of the signs. The panel originally had traces of black paint at the top.\n\nHeight 263 cm, width 259 cm.\n\nThis panel was part of the faÃ§ade of the throne room. Layard (1849, 'Nineveh and its Remains', vol. I, p. 118) refers to how at the time of discovery there were extensive traces of black pigment covering the face of the man with the monkeys, and he speculated that this was either from a deliberate attempt to depict a negro or that the paint had washed down from the man's hair. No traces of this are now visible to the naked eye (2008).\n\nLayard refers to the survival at the time of excavation of pigment on selective portions of other sculptures at Nimrud, specifically on the hair, beards, eyes and sandals of some sculptures and the red-painted tongue of an eagle-headed genie (ibid., pp. 71-72, 126). The white infilling in the inscription on this particular scuplture may also be ancient and resembles a feature noted on Persepolitan (the capital of ancient Persia) inscriptions.\n\nCatalog: Gypsum alabaster, pigmented, Nimrud, BM/Big number 124562\n\nPhoto: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nSource: Original, British Museum\n\nText: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, Â© Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nEagle Headed Winged Genie\n\nGypsum alabaster wall panel relief, circa 865 BC - 860 BC, showing an eagle-headed protective spirit in the character of a fertiliser of the date-palm, facing right and holding a bucket in one hand and in the other a spathe (leaf-like sheath for the flowers) of the date palm.

There are three common stylistic tendencies in reliefs with genii. First there are bearded, winged figures wearing a horned helmet. Next there are bearded, winged figures wearing a diadem instead of helmet. Finally there are winged, muscular, male figures with bird heads. They are usually adorned with rosettes on their diadem and/or wrists. Most often they are wearing a short sleeved, knee-length tunic with a tasseled hem. Over the tunic is an ankle length fringed shawl that covers the near leg, wraps around the body and drapes the left shoulder, with the end hanging down the back to the waist.\n\nCatalog: Gypsum alabaster, repaired from fragments, Nimrud, North West Palace, Room G, panel d 1, BM/Big number WA 124576\n\nPhoto: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nSource: Original, British Museum\n\nText: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, Â© Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nAdditional text: various sources including Wikipedia\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nEagle Headed Winged Genie\n\nHeight 220 cm, width 163 cm.\n\nCatalog: Gypsum alabaster, VA 00941, Nimrud, Northwest Palace, Room F\n\nPhoto: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nSource and text: Pergamon Museum, Berlin, recherche.smb.museum\n\nAs always, click on this small image to see the full size photo.\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nEagle Headed Winged Genie\n\nEagle-headed protective spirit.\n\nHeight 106 cm, width 69 cm.\n\n( This fragment is asymmetrical - Don )\n\nCirca 865 BC - 860 BC\n\nPhoto: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nSource: Original, British Museum\n\nCatalog: Gypsum alabaster, Nimrud, North West Palace, BM/Big number 118921\n\nText: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, Â© Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nAs always, click on this small image to see the full size photo.\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nHuman Headed Winged Genie\n\nWinged genie with bucket and cone.\n\nRelief Plaque.\n\nHeight 232 cm, width 162 cm.\n\nPhoto: Don Hitchcock 2015\n\nCatalog: Gypsum alabaster, Found Nimrud, Northwest Palace, Room C, present location Pergamon Museum, Level 1, Museum of the Near East, Room 11, VA 00943\n\nSource and text: Pergamon Museum, Berlin, recherche.smb.museum\n\nAs always, click on this small image to see the full size photo.\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nStone Reliefs.\n\nThese stone reliefs were originally painted, to judge by the traces of colour detected on the sandals of several of the figures.

A river at the bottom is represented schematically by lines and spirals, and the rough ground by a pattern of scales. The king can be identified by his crown, a conical hat with a pointed top, and his is the grandest beard. The two arrows held upright in his right hand, with the bow lowered in his left, symbolise victory. He wears a sword slung on a swordbelt over his shoulder, and the end of the sheath is decorated with a pair of lions back to back. He has two wristlets; both incorporate rosettes, worn in the position of a modern wrist-watch. A spare bow and two quivers of arrows, an axe and a short javelin are carried in quivers on the side of the cab; decoration including a prancing bull is incised on the quivers.\n\nThe rear of the chariot, from which a spear-shaft projects diagonally backwards, is closed by a spiked shield with a central boss in the shape of a lion's head. An attendant holds a sunshade over the king's head; in battle this man would use a shield to protect the king from arrows.\n\nThe charioteer holds four reins in each hand, together with a whip. This is a typical Assyrian royal chariot of the period, holding a maximum of three people (most chariots carried only two crew) with six-spoked wheels. The two legs of a 'Y' shaped yoke pole is visible, rising from the base of the cab and shown in a distorted false perspective. A patterned cloth is visible above the horses' shoulders, attached to the front of the cab and the yoke. The horses themselves, of which royal chariots probably had a team of four (as revealed in river-crossing scenes) although only three are shown, are led by a groom in front. The tasselled harness is shown in detail, with crests and blinkers on the headstall.\n\nAn armed groom in front is helping to lead the horses. His raised arm wears a wristlet similar to the king's. This is one of two pieces that originally formed the lower section of a single right-angled panel in the corner of a room; they were sawn in two for ease of transport in the 19th century. At the top of the panel can be seen a few signs of the so-called 'standard inscription'.\n\nHeight 1010 mm, width 860 mm, thickness 200 mm.\n\nIn set with BM 124558, above.\n\nPhoto: British Museum, Â© Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n( I was unable to photograph the relief at the time of my visit to the BM, since it was on loan - Don )\n\nSource: Original, British Museum\n\nCatalog: Gypsum alabaster, Nimrud, North West Palace, 124557\n\nText: www.britishmuseum.org/, Â© Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nAs always, click on this small image to see the full size photo.\n\nReign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)\n\nAshurnasirpal II\n\nProduction date circa 865 BC - 860 BC.\n\n124553 (left): Gypsum wall panel relief showing a battle scene.
