I am no historian, but I thought the big bad Assyrians had their capital at Ninevah - right up until Chaldeans did an Assyria and massacred all the inhabitants. So why does Civ V have Assur as their capital? Is Ninevah to Assyria what Sydney is to Australia?\n\nW|M\n\nImmortal\n\nJoined\n\nAug 29, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n9,440\n\nLocation\n\nBrazil\n\nSep 8, 2013\n\n#2\n\nIt's because it has Ass in the name\n\nDachs\n\nHero of the Soviet Union\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 23, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n32,588\n\nLocation\n\nMoscow\n\nSep 8, 2013\n\n#3\n\nNineveh was the most prominent city in the Neo-Assyrian Empire - the famous one - but Assur seems to have been the capital of the Akkadian warlords that struck out on their own and founded the first incarnation of Assyria a millennium prior.\n\nPangur BÃ¡n\n\nDeconstructed\n\nJoined\n\nJan 19, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n9,021\n\nLocation\n\nTranstavia\n\nSep 9, 2013\n\n#4\n\nThe city names for civ games are usually mad anyway, so I wouldn't try to rationalize it too much. But as a happenstance fact it does make sense for Assyria to have as its capital the city that appears to bear the 'empire's' name, so probably a sensible choice.\n\nsydhe\n\nKing of Kongs\n\nJoined\n\nNov 4, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n2,426\n\nLocation\n\nNorman Oklahoma\n\nSep 9, 2013\n\n#5\n\nBecause Assur was the capital until the Neo-Assyrian Empire, when the capital was moved to Calah then to Nineveh. Nineveh was only the capital for the last century of the Empire.\n\nLouis XXIV\n\nLe Roi Soleil\n\nJoined\n\nMar 12, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n13,586\n\nLocation\n\nNorfolk, VA\n\nSep 9, 2013\n\n#6\n\nAssyria has had many capitals. Assur was likely the first (it's where the name Assyria comes from). They also had capitals at Callah (Nimrud) and Dur-Sharrukin (Khorsabad).\n\nNineveh might be the most famous (partly because it was an impressive cosmopolitan city, partly because some guy visited that place after spending time in a giant fish).\n\nDachs\n\nHero of the Soviet Union\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 23, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n32,588\n\nLocation\n\nMoscow\n\nSep 9, 2013\n\n#7\n\nAlso because an apocalyptic war-ending battle was fought there fourteen hundred years ago. Can't forget that one."
