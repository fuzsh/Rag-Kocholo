        "text": "Nineveh\n\nNineveh (Akkadian: ð·ðð¡ð uru NI.NU.A Ninua - The first sign uru ð· is a marker for city in Akkadian) is located in northern Mesopotamia on the eastern bank of the Tigris river, next to current day Mosul in Iraq. As the capital of Assyria, it was the largest city in the world around 650 BCE, with over 100,000 inhabitants. The city of Nineveh was 750 hectares or 7.5 km2, enclosed by a 12 km long brick wall.\n\nThe city of Nineveh was probably founded around 6000 BCE. The city grew in importance under the Assyrian Empire, in particular during the Neo-Assyrian Empire (900-600 BCE). King Sennacherib made Nineveh into a city without rival around 700 BCE, with wonders such as his 80-room palace. He also built incredible gardens that might have been the \"Hanging Gardens of Babylon\", fed by a 40km long acqueduct."
