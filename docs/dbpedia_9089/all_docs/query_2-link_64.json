        "text": "The Destruction Of Nineveh\n\nby David Padfield\n\nThe city of Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian Empire, was destroyed in 612 B.C. The fall of that great city was not a matter of chance, but rather a fulfillment of Bible prophecy.\n\nNineveh was established by Nimrod, \"the mighty hunter\" (Gen. 10:8-10). It served as the capitol of the Assyrian Empire for many years. For years skeptics questioned the existence of the city since it could not be found. However, British archeologist A. H. Layard excavated the site in 1845-1854. He unearthed the great palace of King Sargon along with a library of over 22,000 cuneiform documents. King Sargon was mentioned by Isaiah the prophet (Isa. 20:1).\n\n\"In Sennacherib's day the wall around Nineveh was 40 to 50 feet high. It extended for 4 kilometers along the Tigris River and for 13 kilometers around the inner city. The city wall had 15 main gates, 5 of which have been excavated. Each of the gates was guarded by stone bull statues. Both inside and outside the walls, Sennacherib created parks, a botanical garden, and a zoo. He built a water-system containing the oldest aqueduct in history at Jerwan, across the Gomel River.\" (Nelson's Bible Dictionary, p. 760).\n\nThe prophet Jonah had gone to Nineveh and preached, saying, \"Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!\" (Jonah 3:4). The record tells us \"the people of Nineveh believed God, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them\" (Jonah 3:5). In response to one of the greatest stories of repentance in history, \"God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God relented from the disaster that He had said He would bring upon them, and He did not do it\" (Jonah 3:10).\n\nThe Assyrian Empire began a quest for world domination under Tiglath-pileser III in 745 B.C. He invaded northern Israel and deported some of the inhabitants to the region around Nineveh. Sargon II completed the siege of Samaria that had been started by Shalmaneser V in 722 B.C. Later, Sennacherib shut up King Hezekiah in Jerusalem \"as a bird in a cage.\" Ashurbanipal led a campaign into Egypt and caused the downfall of Thebes (called No-amon in Nahum 3:8).\n\nThe Assyrian Empire was known for its cruelty. \"Judged from the vaunting inscriptions of her kings, no power more useless, more savage, more terrible, ever cast its gigantic shadow on the page of history as it passed on the way to ruin. The kings of Assyria tormented the miserable world. They exult to record how 'space failed for corpses'; how unsparing a destroyer is their goddess Ishtar; how they flung away the bodies of soldiers like so much clay; how they made pyramids of human heads; how they burned cities; how they filled populous lands with death and devastation; how they reddened broad deserts with carnage of warriors; how they scattered whole countries with the corpses of their defenders as with chaff; how they impaled 'heaps of men' on stakes, and strewed the mountains and choked rivers with dead bones; how they cut off the hands of kings and nailed them on the walls, and left their bodies to rot with bears and dogs on the entrance gates of cities; how they employed nations of captives in making brick in fetters; how they cut down warriors like weeds, or smote them like wild beasts in the forests, and covered pillars with the flayed skins of rival monarchs.\" (Farrar, The Minor Prophets, pp. 147,148).\n\nThe prophet Nahum predicted the destruction of Nineveh in the book that bears his name. The following items were to be a part of the destruction of that great city:\n\nAn \"overflowing flood\" would \"make an utter end of its place\" (Nah. 1:8)\n\nNineveh would be destroyed while her inhabitants were \"drunken like drunkards\" (Nah. 1:10)\n\nNineveh would be unprotected because \"fire shall devour the bars of your gates\" (Nah. 3:13)\n\nNineveh would never recover, for their \"injury has no healing\" (Nah. 3:19)\n\nThe downfall of Nineveh would come with remarkable ease, like figs falling when the tree is shaken (Nah. 3:12)\n\nIn 612 B.C. Nabopolassar united the Babylonian army with an army of Medes and Scythians and led a campaign which captured the Assyrian citadels in the North. The Babylonian army laid siege to Nineveh, but the walls of the city were too strong for battering rams, so they decided to try and starve the people out. A famous oracle had been given that \"Nineveh should never be taken until the river became its enemy.\" After a three month siege, \"rain fell in such abundance that the waters of the Tigris inundated part of the city and overturned one of its walls for a distance of twenty stades. Then the King, convinced that the oracle was accomplished and despairing of any means of escape, to avoid falling alive into the enemy's hands constructed in his palace an immense funeral pyre, placed on it his gold and silver and his royal robes, and then, shutting himself up with his wives and eunuchs in a chamber formed in the midst of the pile, disappeared in the flames. Nineveh opened its gates to the besiegers, but this tardy submission did not save the proud city. It was pillaged and burned, and then razed to the ground so completely as to evidence the implacable hatred enkindled in the minds of subject nations by the fierce and cruel Assyrian government.\" (Lenormant and E. Chevallier, The Rise and Fall of Assyria).\n\n\"Nineveh was laid waste as ruthlessly and completely as her kings had once ravaged Susa and Babylon; the city was put to the torch, the population was slaughtered or enslaved, and the palace so recently built by Ashurbanipal was sacked and destroyed. At one blow Assyria disappeared from history. Nothing remained of her except certain tactics and weapons of war ...The Near East remembered her for a while as a merciless unifier of a dozen lesser states; and the Jews recalled Nineveh vengefully as 'the bloody city, full of lies and robbery.' In a little while all but the mightiest of the Great Kings were forgotten, and all their royal palaces were in ruins under the drifting sands. Two hundred years after its capture, Xenophon's Ten Thousand marched over the mounds that had been Nineveh, and never suspected that these were the site of the ancient metropolis that had ruled half the world. Not a stone remained visible of all the temples with which Assyria's pious warriors had sought to beautify their greatest capital. Even Ashur, the everlasting god, was dead.\" (Will Durant, Our Oriental Heritage, pp. 283, 284)."
