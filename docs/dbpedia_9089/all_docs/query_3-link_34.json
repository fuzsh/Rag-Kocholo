It shows us that the Assyrians, like the later Babylonians, were in the habit of \"requiring\" music from their prisoners, who, when transported into a \"strange land,\" had to entertain their masters with their native melodies.\" - Henry Rawlinson\n\n\"They that carried us away captive required of us a song\" - Psalm 137:3\n\nNote from Biblical Scholar\n\n\"The kinnor was probably the Hebrew form of the Lyre, and this view is strengthened by an examination of the interesting relief showing an Assyrian warrior guarding three Semitic captives, playing on Lyres held obliquely. The dress seems to indicate that they were Israelitish prisoners...the instruments on this relief like the Lyres of the Jewish coins, seem to have four of five strings.\" - Encyclopaedia Biblica\n\nMuseum Excerpt\n\nMuseum number ME 124947\n\nStone relief from the South-West Palace of Sennacherib\n\nNineveh, northern Iraq\n\nNeo-Assyrian, about 704-681 BC\n\nPrisoners, probably from Phoenicia or Palestine, playing lyres\n\nThis is one small surviving fragment from a much larger composition. The scale effect on the background represents rough ground.\n\nThe musicians are often thought to have come from the state of Judah, though there is no evidence for this. The style of their dress is different to that worn by the people of Lachish (see for example, a panel showing the siege of Lachish). They are, however, almost certainly Western or Levantine in origin.\n\nMusic was clearly an important part of court life and Assyrian kings often refer to taking musicians into captivity as part of the deportation of defeated peoples. There is evidence of music in religious practice at an earlier period, but reliefs like this provide the first images of musical instruments in an ancient Near Eastern society that are not connected with a religious ceremony.\n\nThe musicians are playing lyres. They hold them more or less horizontally and use a plectrum. This type of lyre was possibly introduced into Assyria from the West in the first half of the second millennium BC. Only a few are known and the chronology and classification of the many forms of lyre in the Near East in the first millennium is neither complete nor certain.\n\nDimensions\n\nLength: 99.060 cm\n\nWidth: 101.600 cm\n\nThe palace was excavated by A.H. Layard (1846-51) and by many later archaeologists\n\nBritish Museum Page\n\nThe Assyrian Empire\n\nThe first great military empire in ancient history was the Assyrian Empire. By the time of Ashurnasirpal and Shalmaneser III in the 9th century BC the Assyrians organized a mighty army of nearly 200,000 soldiers. Their military strategy was unsurpassed up to that time, and with the age of iron they were an unstoppable fighting machine. They brought spearmen, archers, shieldmen, slingers, siege engines, chariots, and a huge calvary into the battlefield. The mighty Assyrians dominated the ancient world until they were crippled by the God of Israel in the reign of Sennacherib. God raised up the Assyrians to remove Israel out of his sight for their rebellion and idolatry, but the Assyrians would also be punished also for their wicked ways. They finally fell to the Medes and Babylonians in 612 BC and passed into history.\n\nAssyrian Kings Mentioned in the Bible\n\n2 Kings 15:29 - In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.\n\n2 Kings 15:19 - Pul the king of Assyria came against the land, and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.\n\n2 Kings 18:9 - And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which [was] the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, thatShalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.\n\nIsaiah 20:1 - In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, whenSargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;\n\n2 Kings 19:16 - LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words ofSennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.\n\n2 Kings 19:37 - And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. AndEsarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.\n\nEzra 4:10 - and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth, wrote.\n\nAssyrian Kings Names in Cuneiform\n\nArchaeology of Ancient Assyria\n\nTimeline of Ancient Assyrian Kings\n\n(During the Period of the Biblical Kings)\n\nAssur-nasirpal II (885-860 B.C.) A cruel warrior king, he made Assyria into the most fierce fighting machine of ancient world.\n\nShalmaneser III (860-825 B.C.) His reign was marked by almost constant war. He was the first Assyrian king to come into conflict with Israel. King Ahab fought against him, and king Jehu paid him tribute in 841 BC. His royal inscriptions were more detailed and more numerous than any other king. His building works were massive just like his father Assurnasirpal II. SeeShalmaneser and the Black Obelisk.\n\nShamsi-Adad V (825-808 B.C.) Most of his reign was focused on Babylonia and his own internal conflicts.\n\nAdad-nirari III (808-783 B.C.) The little information about his reign mentions his building projects at Calah and Nineveh, as well as a conflict at Der in Babylonia and collecting tribute in Damascus, Syria.\n\nShalmaneser IV (783-771 B.C.) The limited knowledge of his reign reveal some conflicts in Damascus and a period of decline in Assyria.\n\nAssur-dayan III(771-753 B.C.) The little information about this ruler reveals Assyria being in a period of decline.\n\nAssur-nirari V (753-747 B.C.) There is very little information about his reign. The king of Urartu boasted of a victory over this king of Assyria in an inscription.\n\nTiglath-pileser III (Pul) (747-727 B.C.) He restored Assyria to a major world power. He is the \"Pul\" mentioned in the Bible and the one who began to destroy Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. He carried many away into captivity. This captivity is mentioned in his own inscriptions, the Babylonian Chronicle, and the Bible.\n\nShalmaneser V (727-722 B.C.) He besieged Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. He died during the siege after imposing taxation on the holy city (Asshur), and his son Sargon came to power.\n\nSargon II(722-705 B.C.) He completed the destruction of Samaria and the captivity of Israel. He was also famous for his magnificent palace with his colossal winged guardians.\n\nSennacherib (705-681 B.C.) He was the most famous of the Assyrian kings. He mentions the name of Hezekiah on his prism during his war campaigns, he claimed to have \"Hezekiah captured in his own royal city (Jerusalem) like a caged bird.\" His army was defeated at the gates of Jerusalem by the Angel of the Lord. Sennacherib returned back to Nineveh and was killed violently by his own son, as mentioned in the Babylonian Chronicle, The Bible, and various other inscriptions. He also conquered Babylon.\n\nEsar-haddon (681-668 B.C.) He rebuilt Babylon, invaded and conquered Egypt by crossing over the Sinai Desert with Arab camels carrying water for his army, and was one of Assyria's greatest kings. He died fighting Egypt.\n\nAssur-banipal (668-626 B.C.) He destroyed the Thebes in Egypt and collected a great library, innumerable clay tablets were found.\n\nAssur-etil-ilani (626-607 B.C.) It was under his reign that the Assyrian Empire fell.\n\nAssyrian annals mention contacts with some ten Hebrew kings: Omri, Ahab, Jehu, Menahem, Hoshea, Pekah, Uzziah, Ahaz, Hezekiah, and Manasseh.\n\nIn the reign of Hoshea, king of Israel, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, twice invaded (2 Kings 17:3,5) the kingdom that remained, and his successor Sargon II took Samaria in 722 BC, carrying away 27,290 of the population as he tells in his Khorsabad Annals. Later Assyrian kings, particularly Esarhaddon (681 BC - 668 BC), completed the task.\n\nFor More Info See: Bible History Online\n\nMap of the Land of Assyria\n\nKids Bible Maps\n\nPrimary Sources for Assyrian History\n\nThe Assyrian Annals. The scribes of the chief cities of the Assyrians wrote the accounts of the king's military campaigns on cuneiform tablets, and clay prisms or cylinders. The accounts are very reliable, even though the accounts do not speak negatively of the Assyrians and are meant to glorify the king. The annals also give much detail to geography and Chronology. It is interesting how accurate the Assyrians were with dates, they made use of an Assyrian Kings List or the Eponym Canon.\n\nThe Assyrian Chronicles and Eponym Canon. The Assyrian scribes organized their national events whether military, political or religious every regnal year. The Babylonian Chronicles were structured the same way. Assyrian records were kept very carefully, they took their dating and their history seriously. They attached their record of events with the solar year and with the name of an official who was known as the \"limmu.\" Their was a new limmu appointed every year. They recorded military, political and religious events in every year and made references to eclipses. The Assyrian records are highly dependable and allow Biblical scholars a very accurate way of dating events and designating \"eponyms\" for 244 year in Hebrew history, from 892-648 BC.\n\nThe Assyrian King List. The Assyrian King List reveals a list of the kings of ancient Assyria in chronological order, from the 2nd millennium BC to 609 BC. It lists the name of the king, his father's name, the length of his reign, and some great achievements.\n\nAssyrian Sculptures. The limestone bas-reliefs discovered from the palace walls of major Assyrian capital cities like Nineveh (Kuyunjik), Nimrud (Calah), Khorsabad (Dur-Sharrukin), and the bronze bands on the Balawat Gates reveal a wealth of history. The illustrative events were carved be professional Assyrian artists like a modern day photographer on the scene. The carvings reveal the military might and tactics of the Assyrians, as well as the futility of those nations that defied their might. These sculptures are on display in museums around the world, for example: The British Museum in London, The Louvre in France, The Iraqi Museum, and The Oriental Institute in Chicago."
