The city (ancient Ninua) is first mentioned about 1800 BC as a center of worship of Ishtar whose cult was responsible for the city's early importance. A statue of the goddess was sent to Amenhotep III, Pharaoh of Egypt in the 14th century BC by orders of the king of Mitanni. Nineveh became one of Mitanni's vassals until the mid 14th century BC, when the Assyrian kings of Assur reclaimed it while overthrowing the Mittani Empire.\n\nNineveh's importance grew due to its central position on the main trade route between the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. Situated at the confluence of the Tigris and Khosr rivers, wealth flowed into the city from many sources, and eventually Nineveh caught the eye of neo-Assyrian monarchs. From the time of Sargon II (722-705 BC) and onward, considerable architectural expansion took place in Nineveh and it became one of the greatest of Assyria's ancient cities.\n\nAshurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king,\n\nking of hosts, king of Assyria;\n\nSon of Tukulti-Urta, the great king, the mighty king,\n\nking of hosts, king of Assyria;\n\nSon of Adad-nirari, the great king, the mighty king,\n\nking of hosts, king of Assyria;\n\nWho has conquered from beyond\n\nthe Tigris as far as Mount Lebanon\n\nand the Great Sea*, and has brought in subjection at his feet\n\nall the countries from the rising to the setting Sun\n\nAn inscription upon the breast of a limestone statue of Ashurbanipal, translated from the cuneiform carvings below.\n\n* i.e., the Mediterranean Sea\n\nClick here to view a detailed diagram of the city and its gates.\n\nCredits:\n\nAerial image by artist, Balage Balogh.
