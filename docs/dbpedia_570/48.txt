Introduction

The Microlepidoptera fauna of the Middle East is until today poorly known. Most records are from the mid-1930’s and little or nothing is known about the ecology of most species. H. G. Amsel, a German entomologist, was one of the pioneers collecting Lepidoptera in general (but with a strong emphasis on Micros) in the former British Mandate of Palestine, long before the formation of the State of Israel. In his fundamental manuscript “Die Lepidopteren Palästinas” and subsequent papers, AMSEL (1933, 1934, 1935) listed 1,335 Lepidoptera species including 58 species of the families that are discussed in this article. Seven of them were subsequently synonymized, four species were misidentified, and four species were recorded for the territory that is presently part of Jordan and Syria. Since AMSEL (1955), BACK (1973), HANNEMANN (1976), GOZMANY (1978, 2000, 2008) and HALPERIN & SAUTER (1992) and prior to the present study, 59 species of Microlepidoptera were recorded for Israel, including Oecophoridae (14), Autostichidae (14), Depressariidae (23), Cryptolechiidae (3) and Lecithoceridae (5).

Material and methods

This survey is based on literature data, analysis of material in several museums (see list of abbreviations below) and more recent material collected in CDC miniature light-traps within the frame of a mosquito project by the two last authors in May and June 2003 (MÜLLER et al., 2012). We use chorotype classification accepted for the Levant in our previous publications (KRAVCHENKO et al., 2007a, 2007b).

Material was identified in the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. Altogether 860 specimens of the families Oecophoridae, Autostichidae, Depressariidae, Cryptolechiidae and Lecithoceridae were examined and identified. The identification was carried out using the latest keys to the fauna of Europe and the Palearctic (BACK, 1973; HANNEMANN, 1995, 1997; GOZMÁNY, 1978, 2000, 2008; HUEMER, 1998; TOKAR et al., 2005). Whenever necessary additional genitalia preparations were made.

General distribution: Central and Southern Europe, Northern Africa, Turkey; introduced to the West Coast of USA (HODGES, 1974). Holarctic. In Israel: Mediterranean Zone. Coastal Plain (HALPERIN & SAUTER, 1992). Biology: Larvae feed under the bark of old deciduous trees from summer to spring of the following year, with hibernation (HALPERIN & SAUTER, 1992; FETZ, 1994; HANNEMANN, 1997; HARPER et al., 2002). Adults are day active and on wing from April until June.

Epicallima einsleri (Amsel, 1934), comb. n. Material examined: 1 1(holotype), Jerusalem, 29-V-1930, leg. H. Amsel (LSNK); 2 11 (paratypes), Jerusalem, 1-V-1930, leg. H. Amsel (ZIN); 1 1, 3 00, East Galilee, Yftach, 28-V-2003, leg. G. Müller & V. Kravchenko (TAU). General distribution: Recorded only in Israel. Probably endemic to the Levant. In Israel: Mediterranean Zone. Jerusalem, East and Lower Galilee (AMSEL, 1934, 1935; HALPERIN & SAUTER, 1992). Biology: Larvae feed on decaying material under the bark of Quercus ithaburensis (Fagaceae) and dry stems of Vitex agnus-castus (Verbenaceae). Adults are on the wing from May until June (HALPERIN & SAUTER, 1992). Remarks: The species was originally described in the genus Borkhausenia Hübner, [1825], but its large labial palpi and long aedeagus in males and its ductus bursae with sclerotization in female (Figs. 1, 2) correspond more to the characters of genus Epicallima Dyar, [1903].

Epicallima formosella ([Denis & Schiffermüller], 1775) General distribution: Central and Southern Europe, Caucasus, Egypt, Central Asia, USA. Holarctic. In Israel: Mediterranean Zone.

Remarks: The European species Oegoconia quadripuncta (Haworth, 1828) mentioned by Amsel for Israel (1933, 1935) can be distinguished from O. caradjai only by genitalia. However, these references were not checked based on the study of male genitalia (GOZMÁNY, 2008), and most probably should prove to be misidentifications, since O. quadripuncta seems to be restricted to Western Europe, from Spain to Great Britain with its eastern limits in Germany.

Discussion

The Oecophoridae are distributed worldwide, in the Levant (Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Jordan) 32 species are known altogether (AMSEL, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1955; ZERNY, 1934; OSTHELDER, 1936; HARIRI, 1971; BACK, 1973; HALPERIN, SAUTER, 1992; HANNEMANN, 1997), of which 17 species are known from Israel including three species recorded for Israel for the first time: Dasycera intermediella, Batia internella and Carcina quercana. Most species of the Oecophoridae are associated with forest habitats, but the subfamily Pleurotinae (6 species in Israel) occurs mainly in open and xerophilous habitats.

The Autostichidae are represented by 31 species in the Levant (AMSEL, 1933, 1935; HARIRI, 1971; GOZMÁNY, 2000, 2008), among which 16 are found in Israel including 2 species recorded for Israel for the first time: Oegoconia deauratella and O. caradjai. The larvae of the Autostichidae prefer xerophytic habitats.

Species of the family Depressariidae are distributed mainly in the forest zone of the northern hemisphere, penetrating far to the south in mesophilic, especially intrazonal biotopes. In Israel 25 species of this family have been recorded so far including 2 species recorded for Israel for the first time: Agonopterix ferulae and A. kaekeritziana. 10 more species are known from the other parts of Levant (CARADJA, 1920; AMSEL, 1933, 1934, 1935; OSTHELDER, 1936; ELLISON, WILTSHIRE, 1939; HARIRI, 1971; HANNEMANN, 1976, 1995; HALPERIN & SAUTER, 1992).

Only four species of the poorly known family Cryptolechiidae are know from the Levant (CARADJA, 1920; AMSEL, 1933, 1935; SATTLER, 1968). Three were found in Israel by CARADJA (1920) and AMSEL (1933, 1935).

Species of the family Lecithoceridae are common in subtropical and tropical forests of the Old World. Eight species of this family are recorded from the Levant (GOZMÁNY, 1978). In Israel the Lecithoceridae are represented by six species, including Lecithocera anatolica recorded for Israel for the first time.
