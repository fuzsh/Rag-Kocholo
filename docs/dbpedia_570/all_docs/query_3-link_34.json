        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nZiziphus is a genus of around 200 species of spiny shrubs, small trees, and vines in the buckthorn family, Rhamnaceae. Species are distributed throughout the world in warm-temperate and subtropical regions. Zizphus are grown for their jujube fruits in ∼50 countries, including in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, India, Iran, Israel and Pakistan, but more than 90 % of all production is currently concentrated in China. Although breeding for Ziziphus cultivars via selection has been practiced for more than a thousand years, the process of cross-breeding is difficult due to their tiny flowers that are hard to emasculate (Wang et al. 2014), and trees are mostly propagated by grafted cuttings (Xu et al. 2016).\n\nThe fruits of Ziziphus plants are highly nutritious (Abdoul-Azize 2016) and they are sources of carbohydrates, minerals (iron and potassium), phenolic compounds and vitamins (Rashwan et al. 2020). They also present medicinal properties and are widely used in local and traditional medicines (Ahmad et al., 2013; 2016). Pharmacological activities of different Ziziphus species have been identified, such as the anti-ulcerogenic activity of Z. lotus, anti-cancer proliferation properties of Z. jujuba and antimicrobial activity of Z. mauritiana. With these characteristics, Ziziphus fruits can be considered ‘super foods’ with potential for expanded production and consumption (Liu et al. 2020). Globally, Ziziphus are becoming increasingly popular to grow because of their ability to adapt to a broad range of climatic conditions (Jiang et al. 2020). They yield well in arid and semi-arid regions, where other fruit trees fail to grow, and are relatively tolerant of drought, salinity and high temperature stress (Liu et al. 2020).\n\nTo explore and capture the genetic diversity available for selection and breeding for improvement of quantitative traits in such species, one efficient method is genome-wide association study (GWAS) where polymorphic markers from a diverse collection, rather than an inbred population, are associated with phenotypic traits. Such studies also allow the exploration of markers-trait associations using the wild relatives of domesticated cultivars that may still harbor beneficial alleles lost during domestication and the narrowing of a gene pool (McCouch 2013), and panels of accessions from different geographic origins where plants may have adapted to different climatic conditions. In order to test the available genetic variation in a collection and perform GWAS, a high, genome-wide, marker density is required. Among different molecular makers, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are widely used and important molecular markers (Mammadov et al. 2012). In plants, genotyping by sequencing (GBS) using high-throughput sequencing has proved to be an effective method for the development and genotyping of a large number of SNP markers (Peterson et al. 2014; Torkamaneh, et al. 2016; Belzile, 2016; Pereira-Dias et al. 2019; He et al. 2014).). GBS has been successfully used in many crop species including maize, barley, wheat, rice (Poland and Rife, 2012) and, recently, in Z. jujuba Mill. for molecular markers discovery in a core collection (Chen et al. 2017) and for GWAS of domestication and fruit traits (Gou et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021; Hou et al. 2020). Molecular markers for any identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) can then be used for marker-assisted selection in plant breeding programs (He et al. 2014) to incorporate alleles from diverse, genetic resources.\n\nIn our current research, we report the successful application of genotyping by sequencing in a 141accession panel of five different Ziziphus species and origin groups, generating more than 10,000 high quality SNP markers. These were used to investigate the population structure, genetic diversity and phylogeny of the collection. We also performed GWAS to associate markers with phenotypic and agronomic traits. Our results provide a valuable foundation for the breeding and genetic improvement of Ziziphus crop species.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nFor this investigation, we successfully applied GBS technology to generate high-quality SNPs across four Ziziphus species. The number of SNPs generated in our study (10,889) is higher than in many similar studies, including the previously reported 4,680 SNPs from GBS in a 150 member Z. jujuba core collection (Chen et al. 2017) and the 4,651 SNPs found in the extended, 180-accession Z. jujuba panel (Hou et al. 2020). This suggests, not only that GBS and reference sequence-based alignment is an efficient approach for SNPs identification in related Ziziphus species, but also that the addition of accessions from different species and origins allowed us to capture previously untapped molecular diversity that could prove valuable for marker-assisted approaches to both conservation and breeding.\n\nBoth the phylogenetic and population structure analysis of our collection grouped the accessions into two major clades; one clade comprised all Z. jujuba accessions and the other included all Z. nummularia and Z. Oxyphylla. Although Z. mauritiana accessions clustered with Z. jujuba in population structure analysis, phylogenetic and PCA analysis were more sensitive, revealing that these accessions were distinct in comparison with either the Z. jujuba or the Z. oxyphylla, with some admixture with Z. nummularia. These results agree with the findings of Uddin et al. (2021) for a larger collection of 200 genotypes (including the 141 accessions studied here) characterized using three highly polymorphic SSRs. The country of origin of the Z. jujuba did not influence the population structure and, although the limited number of Chinese Z. jujuba cultivars in this collection clustered together, this clade was within the wider Z. jujuba clade, suggesting that the molecular diversity in the wild Z. jujuba from Pakistan could be a useful source of diverse alleles for the cultivated varieties. Although the clades broadly separated along species lines, this was not complete, with markers sufficiently shuffled to complete the association study using a mixed linear model, with a conservative correction, and low false discovery rates for the MTAs. Interestingly, the Z. nummularia and Z. oxyphylla clade was the most mixed between the species, but with the furthest separation from Z. jujuba, suggesting that they may have a unique ancestry.\n\nThe highest genetic diversity and polymorphic information content in our collection was measured in the wild Z. jujuba from Pakistan, whereas the lowest diversity was found in the cultivated and domesticated Z. jujuba from China. Fresh jujube (Z. jujuba var. jujuba) was domesticated from wild, dry jujube (Z. jujuba var. spinosa) in China, and the wild relative progenitor of sweet Z. jujuba is Z. acidojujuba. Huang et al. (2016) resequenced 31 accessions of Z. jujuba var. spinosa and Guo et al. (2021) resequenced 493 Z. jujuba and Z. acidojujuba accessions and 350 wild (var. spinosa), semi-wild (var. spinosa) and cultivated (var. jujuba) Z. jujuba accessions, all collected in China. Comparing whole genome assemblies (Huang et al., 2016) and using GWAS (Guo et al., 2020; 2021) the chromosomal regions of selective sweeps and important traits and genes for domestication were identified. Despite large differences in genome size between fresh and dry jujube (Huang et al., 2016), relatively little whole genome nucleotide diversity between the wild progenitor (Z. acidojujuba), wild, semi-wild (var. spinosa) and domesticated, cultivated Z. jujuba (Guo et al., 2020; 2021) was found in these studies. Our finding that relatively high genetic diversity has been retained in the Z. jujuba accessions from Pakistan in comparison with those from China is, therefore, surprising, but is consistent with previous findings for this collection (Uddin et al., 2021). This result might have reflected the smaller number of Z. jujuba from China in the panel, but polymorphic information content was also higher in the small number of Z. mauritiana than in the Chinese Z. jujuba. Alternatively, it could indicate that Z. jujuba has been under lower selection pressure (either natural or artificial) in Pakistan than in China. Most significant MTAs identified here did not coincide with previously reported regions of selective sweeps or validated candidate genes for domestication that included those for fruit shape and weight (Guo et al., 2020; 2021). The marker 8_1006069 that was significantly associated with both fruit weight and plant height in our GWAS is in the region identified by Guo et al. (2020) for bearing-shoot length and number of leaves, suggesting that selection for plant architecture during domestication may underly this QTL.\n\nAlthough the large number of high quality SNPs and population structure of this panel allowed us to confidently identify significant MTAs through GWAS, differences in genome size (Huang et al., 2016) and linkage disequilibrium decay (Guo et al. 2020; 2021) between different Ziziphus species have been reported and, using a reference-based alignment approach, we were unable to assess potential structural variations between species’ genomes. Thus, although reference-based alignment was a practical option, our study is limited by this approach in comparison with full, pan-genome approaches. Although we have listed genes annotated and positioned within the region of the QTL in the reference genome (Supplemental Table S4), we have no knowledge of whether those positions vary, or whether these genes are present at those positions in the other Ziziphus genomes included here. Although the markers identified can be used for marker-assisted selection, further work would be required to validate any candidate genes. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, the MTAs identified in this study were novel (although some similar fruit traits were studied using GWAS by Hou et al. (2020) in Z. jujuba) and they had high allelic effects. Utilizing the different species and origins resulted in a wide range of trait phenotypes for the majority of traits that allowed us to explore novel genetic associations. For most traits this range was greater in cluster 2 that included all the Z. jujuba and Z. mauritiana accessions. This, again, indicated, that genetic diversity has been retained in Z. jujuba in this collection, but also the wider range of phenotypes allowed us to uncover novel MTAs for important traits. For example, all the Z. jujuba of Chinese origin were relatively short, all the Z. mauritiana relatively tall, with the remainder of accessions from other species and origins distributed between. Likewise, the highest fruit weights were exclusively observed in the Chinese Z. jujuba, the lowest in Z. oxyphylla, with the remainder between. The evident genetic determination underlying these traits allowed us to identify MTAs that would likely have been masked in a single species or origin collection.\n\nOur results demonstrate that the genetic diversity among different Ziziphus species can be of value for ongoing crop improvement programs and suggest that the continued conservation and development of additional genetic and genomic resources for the orphan crops in this genus will be worthwhile."
