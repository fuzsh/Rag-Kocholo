        "text": "2.2Morphological analysis of jujube fruits\n\nThe following properties were measured by morphological analysis:\n\na) Fruit length in mm, n = 15 of each genotype were measured with a digital caliper (Proteco, Czech Republic).\n\nb) Fruit width in mm, n = 15 of each genotype were measured with a digital caliper (Proteco, Czech Republic).\n\nc) Fruit weight in g, n = 15 of each genotype were weighted on an analytical balance (Kern ADB-A01S05, Germany).\n\nd) Fruit jujube stone weight in g, n = 15 of each genotype were weighted on an analytical balance (Kern ADB-A01S05, Germany).\n\n3.1Morphological parameters of jujube fruits\n\nThe weight of jujube fruit (Table 1) ranged from 2.52 g (ZJ12) to 19.37 g (ZJ15) with the coefficient of variation of 55.10%, which indicated the very high jujube fruit weight variability. The weight of pulp was from 2.21 g (ZJ12) to 19.29 g (ZJ15) showing the high variability (58.6%) as well. The weight, length and width of jujube fruit stones varied from 0.18 (ZJ07) to 0.88 g (ZJ12), from 18.11 mm (ZJ12) to 40.69 mm (ZJ14) and from 16.66 mm (ZJ07) to 35.60 mm (ZJ15) with high degree of variability of weight but with medium degree of variability for length and width. Karnatovska et al. [16] found the average weight of fruits from 1.00 to 9.5 g in 23 varieties of jujube growing in extreme agroecological condition in Nova Kachovka in Ukraine. Differences in weight of jujube fruits were reported by Ecevit et al. [17], Sivakov et al. [18] and Zhang et al. [19], who found the weight from 4.52 to 12.7 in different plant genotypes. The highest degree of variability of the jujube fruit weight was observed by Jia et al. [20] in variety Shiguang, who determined the average and maximal weight of 34.3 g and 108 g, respectively. Also Brindza et al. [21] found the weight variations from 0.66 to 4.68 g evaluating the collection of jujube seedlings growing in agroecological conditions of Slovakia. Our results are in accordance with the previous studies and support the observations on the high degree of variability between the jujube genotypes.\n\nTable 1\n\nParameternminmax X¯ V%Fruit weight [g]152.5219.377.9655.10Pulp weight [g]152.2119.297.5058.6Stone weight [g]150.180.880.4655.18Fruit length [mm]1518.1140.6930.9318.05Fruit width [mm]1516.6635.6022.3821.65\n\nThe correlation coefficients of the linear relationship between the morphological characteristics of the jujube (Table 2) showed the significant linear dependence between the weight and fruit width (r = 0.97). Positive correlation was determined between the weight and length (r = 0.77) and between the length and width of jujube fruits (r = 0.65). There were no correlation between the weight of jujube fruits and jujube stones.\n\nTable 2\n\nParameterPulp weightFruit lengthFruit widthStone weightPulp weight1.0000.769***0.976***0.668**Fruit length1.0000.653**0.517*Fruit width1.0000.703**Stone weight1.000\n\nSignificant differences in weight of jujube fruit, jujube stones and in the proportion of pulp and stones between the genotypes were observed (Fig. 1). Maximum fruit weight was found in genotype ZJ15 –19.37 g but the proportion of stone to total fruit weight comprised only 4.56%. In contrast, the lowest fruit weight was detected in genotype ZJ12 –2.52 g while the proportion of stone to the total weight of fruit was 12.3%. Genotypes of jujube with big stones are attractive for the producers as those with small stones. Jujube stones contain the valuable seeds, which are rich in biologically active substances, mainly fatty acids. Oil produced from the seeds can be used in pharmaceutical and food industry and hence are intended for practical application [22, 23].\n\nFig.1\n\nThe jujube fruits start to be very attractive for food producing not only in Asia but also in other countries, including Ukraine and Slovakia. Our findings on the morphologyical characteristics of fruits are important for plant breeding and practically significant. Results of the present study indicate that jujube genotypes could be sorted according to the fruit and stones size.\n\n3.2Antioxidant activity of jujube measured with the DPPH and molybdenum reducing antioxidant power methods\n\nThe antioxidant activity of jujube genotypes evaluated by the DPPH method (Fig. 2) ranged from 11.18 (ZJ01) to 16.82 (ZJ08) mg TEAC/g. The degree of mean variability of parameters was confirmed by the variation coefficient (V = 10.68%) in all the genotypes tested.\n\nFig.2\n\nThe antioxidant activity evaluated by the molybdenum reducing antioxidant power (Fig. 3) varied from 209.64 (ZJ01) to 481.54 (ZJ11) mg TEAC/g. The degree of mean variability of parameters was confirmed by the variation coefficient (V = 16.36%) in tested genotypes.\n\nFig.3\n\nThe antioxidant activity of jujube fruits in the present study was comparable with Koley et al. [27], who reported the results from 14.18 to 39.64% obtained with DPPH method in 12 Indian jujube cultivars. Parkash et al. [24] antioxidant activity testing results were 69.7±4.3% in dry jujube fruit, but Ali-Shad et al. [26] found the antioxidant activity to be between 34.9% and 47.3% in Pakistan. In Europe, the antioxidant activity of Spanish jujube by the ABTS method was from 23.85 to 47.37 mmol TEAC/100 g [3]. Antioxidant activity of jujube fruits could be influenced by the degree of maturity [1, 25]. The best antioxidant activity was present in half-red, respectively in last (red) degree of maturity stage. Since there are differences in genotypes of jujube cultivars grown under different geographic and agroecological conditions, our results are difficult to compare with the previous reported. Our study confirms the free radical scavenging ability in jujube grown in Ukraine indicating that the antioxidant properties possess the fruits of the cultivar in the Western Europe agroecological conditions. Wang et al. [28] reported that the polysaccharides of jujube can exhibit strong antioxidant and anticancer activity and can be used as safe compounds for functional foods showing that the current knowledge of jujube antioxidant activity is underestimated.\n\n3.3Total carotenoid content in jujube fruits\n\nThe total carotenoid content (Fig. 4) was the highest in ZJ1 (14.31 μg/g) but the lowest in ZJ05 (1.52 μg/g), ZJ14 (1.52 μg/g) and ZJ08 (1.72 μg/g) with the high degree of variation (V = 88.16%) in jujube fruits confirmed. Variations in the content of the total carotenoids were reported previously. Guil-Guerrero et al. [29] found the total carotenoid content from 4.12 to 5.98 mg/100 g while San and Yildirim [30] from 7 to 35 μg/100 g in the fresh mass of jujube fruits. Pareek and Dhaka [32] showed the mean total carotenoid content of 21 μg/100 g for fresh jujube fruits. The content of total carotenoids increases during ripening and Ezhilarasi and Tamilmani [31] reported that the colour changes in jujube fruits were attributable to the loss of chlorophyll and the synthesis of carotenoids. The colour turn from green into red is a consequence of chlorophyll degradation and accumulation of a large amount of carotenoids within the plastids as the chloroplasts present in the mature green fruit are transformed to chromoplasts. Dietary carotenoids from jujube fruits can provide health benefits in decreasing the risk of disease, particularly certain cancers and eye disease [33]. β-carotene of jujube carotenoids may have the beneficiary effect due to its ability to be converted to vitamin A.\n\nFig.4\n\n3.4Total polyphenol and flavonoid content in jujube fruits\n\nThe total polyphenol content (Fig. 5) in jujube genotypes ranged from 8.76 (ZJ12) to 21.61 mg GAE/g (ZJ06). The correlation coefficient (V = 23.60%) confirms the high variability of the parameter (Table 3). The total polyphenol content varied widely from 1.09 to 106.8 mg GAE/g in studies in Africa and Asia, respectively [24, 34, 35]. Differences between the cultivars were described and the total polyphenol content was from 4.29 to 6.00 mg GAE/g in five cultivars of jujube in Gao et al. [36] study. Polyphenol content was from 7.45 to 13.21 mg GAE/g in ten genotypes of jujube from different geographical localities in Sun et al. [37] study. Ali-Shad et al. [26] compared the total polyphenol content in hexane and methanol extracts of jujube and found that the mean values were higher in methanol extracts (21.74 mg GAE/g). In our mind, the differences between the present and previously conducted studies may be attributable to the plant geographical origin as well as the different methods of extraction. There are few data on bioactive nutrients, especially on the content and composition of polyphenols of jujube from Ukraine. Gallic, protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acids were found to be the predominant compounds of polyphenols found in jujube extracts [10], while protocatechuic, gallic, chlorogenic and caffeic acids were identified in the dried peel, pulp and seed of Chinese jujubes [38]. Pawlowska et al. [39] reported that the betulinic acid was present in all parts of jujube plant and exhibited anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity [40].\n\nFig.5\n\nTable 3\n\nParameternminmax X¯ V%Carotenoids [μg/g]151.5314.313.5988.16Polyphenols [mg GAE/g]158.7621.6116.1123.60Flavonoids [μg QE/g]151.4911.575.6453.19DPPH method [mg TEAC/g]1511.1816.8215.0610.68Molybdenum reducing power method [mg TEAC/g]15209.64481.55401.1516.36\n\nThe total flavonoid content (Fig. 6) varied from 1.49 (ZJ15) to 11.58 μg QE/g (ZJ08). The variation coefficient (V = 53.19%) supported the observations on high variability (Table 3) of this parameter. Our results correspond to Ali-Shad et al. [26] study, who found the amount of flavonoid from 3.25 mg QE/g (hexane extract) to 15.66 mg QE/g (methanol extract) in jujube fruits. Novel flavonoids –swertish, spinosine and zivulgarin from jujube fruit and semen were described in study Gong et al. [41] there the swertish and spinosine were exerted the sedative effect to humans. Differences between the content of flavonoids were observed between studies and rutin, myricetin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol were identified in jujube fruit in the study of Siriamornpun et al. [10], while Gao et al. [36] found three major flavonoid compounds – epicatechin, catechin and rutin. The differences in individual flavonoids between the studies may be due to the genetic variability of the plants leading to dissimilarities in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in these varieties [10].\n\nFig.6\n\nStrong negative correlation (Table 4) was detected between the total carotenoid content and antioxidant activity identified with the DPPH method (r = –0,643) and between the total carotenoid content and antioxidant activity determined by the molybdenum reducing power method (r = –0.732). Significant correlation was not identified between the polyphenol content and antioxidant activity. These results clearly show that the antioxidant activity and the content of carotenoids, polyphenols, flavonoids are not directly proportional hence in every method applied for examination the different combination of biochemical components should beconsidered.\n\nTable 4\n\nParameterCarotenoidsPolyphenolsFlavonoidsDPPH methodMRP methodCarotenoids1.000–0.1610.239–0.643**–0.732***Polyphenols1.000–0.0600.2130.216Flavonoids1.000–0.1630.043DPPH method1.0000.667**\n\nBased on the data obtained in our study we provided the determination of phenotypic relatedness by the method of discriminant analysis (Fig. 7). A comparison clearly shows the different genotypes and grouping and the significant differences between them.\n\nFig.7"
