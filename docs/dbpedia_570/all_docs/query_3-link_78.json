        "text": "Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.), a member of the Rhamnaceae family with favorable nutritional and flavor quality, exhibited characteristic climacteric changes during its fruit growth stage. Therefore, fruit samples were harvested at four developmental stages on days 55 (young fruits), 76 (white-mature fruits), 96 (half-red fruits), and 116 (full-red fruits) after flowering (DAF). This study then investigated those four growth stage changes of the jujube proteome using label-free quantification proteomics. The results identified 4762 proteins in the samples, of which 3757 proteins were quantified. Compared with former stages, the stages examined were designated as “76 vs. 55 DAF” group, “96 vs. 76 DAF” group, and “116 vs. 96 DAF” group. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG annotation and enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) showed that 76 vs. 55 DAF group pathways represented amino sugar, nucleotide sugar, ascorbate, and aldarate metabolic pathways. These pathways were associated with cell division and resistance. In the study, the jujube fruit puffing slowed down and attained a stable growth stage in the 76 vs. 55 DAF group. However, fatty acid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism was mainly enriched in the 96 vs. 76 DAF group. Fatty acids are precursors of aromatic substances and fat-soluble pigments in fruit. The upregulation of differential proteins at this stage indicates that aromatic compounds were synthesized in large quantities at this stage and that fruit would enter the ripening stage. During the ripening stage, 55 DEPs were identified to be involved in photosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis in the 116 vs. 96 DAF group. Also, the fruit entered the mature stage, which showed that flavonoids were produced in large quantities. Furthermore, the color of jujube turned red, and photosynthesis was significantly reduced. Hence, a link was established between protein profiles and growth phenotypes, which will help improve our understanding of jujube fruit growth at the proteomic level."
