Yan\n\nAbstract\n\nInvestigation of 175 Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) cultivars showed that 87.9-99.9% flowers and 68.5% young fruits dropped off during development and finally the fruit set was only 1.1% on the basis of flower averagely. The fruit number per 100 bearing branches varied from 4.26 to 175 among cultivars. Only 8.5% of the cultivars could set more than one fruits per bearing branch. It was seemed that fruit number was negatively correlated to fruit size among cultivars. And, 87.8% of Chinese jujube cultivars can set fruits under self-pollination. However, natural pollination could increase fruiting rate by 3.5-600% or even more. Obvious difference was found among strains of cultivar Jinsixiaozao in fruit set. The seed percentages were less than 10% in 69.2% cultivars, and only 5.9% cultivars had seed percentage over 50%. Pollination was helpful to seed development. Only 1% cultivars had seed rate over 10% under self-pollination while 30.8% cultivars had seed rate more than 10% under natural pollination.\n\nCitation\n\nLiu, P., Liu, M.J., Zhao, Z.H., Liu, X.Y., Wang, J.R. and Yan, C.
