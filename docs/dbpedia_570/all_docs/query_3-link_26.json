Research to identify the causes of embryo abortion is urgently required. To determine the embryo abortion pattern and create a foundation for further research, the embryo abortion characteristics of Z. jujuba Mill. ‘Zhongqiusucui’ were observed during this study. The results indicated that Z. jujuba Mill. ‘Zhongqiusucui’ was a cultivar with a high embryo abortion rate. Furthermore, there were some differences in the embryo abortion rates of jujube fruits in different batches. There was no significant difference between the first and second batches of jujube fruits. Large jujube fruits had a relatively low embryo abortion rate. Small jujube fruits had a relatively low kernel content rate and high embryo abortion rate. Most of the jujube fruits contained a single kernel, and some contained double kernels. The third batch of jujube fruits differed greatly from the first and second batches. The third batch had the highest degree of embryo abortion and all contained kernels were single. The embryo abortion degree of jujube fruits on the lignified bearing shoot was higher than that on the nonlignified bearing shoot, and the probability of jujube fruit with double kernels on the nonlignified bearing shoot was higher than that of the fruit on the lignified bearing shoot. The embryo abortion rates of jujube fruits with a smaller fruit shape index and larger fruit shape index were lower, and that of the medium (fruit shape index range, 1.30–1.60) was higher. The embryo abortion rates of globose, oblong globose, and long cylinder jujube fruits were lower, whereas that of cylindrical fruits was higher. Cracked jujube fruits did not contain normal seed kernels and their embryo abortion rate was 100%.",

        "text": "Abortion characteristics of jujube fruit embryos in different batches.\n\nThere is a phenomenon in which fruit trees bear fruits more than once during a year; that is, the fruit trees can blossom and bear fruits many times during a year. Under the influence of natural environment or genetic characteristics, most fruit trees could only conduct flower bud differentiation and fruiting once per year, but there were still a few fruit trees flowering and fruiting two or more times (Zhou, 1999). Z. jujuba Mill. ‘Zhongqiusucui’ has the significant characteristic of three batches of fruiting every year (Hu, 2017; Hu et al., 2017). Fruits mainly grew on the bearing shoots of jujube stocks or the base of jujube heads of the first batch, those of the second batch mainly bore on the bearing shoots of the secondary branches of the middle and upper parts of the jujube heads, and jujube fruit setting of the third batch was mainly on the bearing shoots of the secondary branch or the extended branch of lignified jujube shoot (Hu et al., 2017). The jujube fruits of the first batch were dominant in cross-diameter and stalk length, whereas the jujube fruits of the second batch had the larger vertical length, fruit shape index, and ratio of edibility; the yield of the second batch was the highest (Hu, 2017). To further study the embryo abortion characteristics of Z. jujuba Mill. ‘Zhongqiusucui’, jujube fruits in different batches were collected and classified according to their vertical length, and the embryo abortion rate was statistically analyzed.\n\nThe embryo abortion rate of jujube fruits of the first batch is shown in Table 1. There were significant differences in the embryo abortion rate of jujube fruit of different sizes. The embryo abortion rate was highest (98.79%) when the fruit vertical length ranged from 0.80 to 1.00 cm and the kernels contained in the fruits were single. The embryo abortion rate of jujube fruit with vertical lengths greater than 2.5 cm was lowest (93.26%), and some fruits contained two kernels. Although the fruits with vertical lengths ranging from 1.21 to 1.40 cm had a lower kernel content rate (2.86%), some of them had two kernels. In general, the kernel content rate of jujube fruits in the first batch was low. Overall, most of the kernels contained were single; only a few were double. The kernel content rate of large jujube fruits (vertical length range of 2.01–2.50 cm and vertical length >2.50 cm) was relatively higher. The kernel content rates of small jujube fruits (vertical length range, 0.80–1.00 cm) and medium jujube fruit (vertical length range, 1.41–1.60 cm) were relatively lower.\n\nAs shown in Table 2, the embryo abortion rate of jujube fruits of different sizes in the second batch differed significantly. The kernel content rate of jujube fruits with a vertical length ranging from 0.80 to 1.00 cm was the lowest (1.12%); their embryo abortion rate was as high as 98.88% and all the kernels contained were single. The jujube fruits with a vertical length of 1.01 to 1.20 cm had the second highest kernel content rate and an embryo abortion rate of was 98.15%; the kernels contained were all single. The jujube fruits with a vertical length ranging from 2.01 to 2.50 cm had a kernel content rate of 7.35%, and some of them contained two kernels. The kernel content rate of fruits with vertical lengths greater than 2.50 cm was highest (13.46%), and their embryo abortion rate was lowest (86.54%). Although the percentage of kernels in fruits with vertical lengths of 1.21 to 1.40 cm was low, some of them contained double kernels (1.47%). The kernel content rate of jujube fruits with several other grades were similar and low; moreover, all the contained seeds were single. Overall, the kernel content rate of jujube fruit in the second batch was low. Most of the seeds contained in jujube fruits were single, and a few jujube fruits contained double kernels. The embryo abortion rate of large fruits (vertical length >2.00 cm) was low, and the embryo abortion rate of small fruits (vertical length range, 0.80–1.20 cm) was higher.\n\nAs shown in Table 3, the embryo abortion rate of jujube fruits with different fruit sizes in the third batch was significantly different. The kernel content rates of jujube fruits with vertical lengths of 1.01 to 1.20 cm and >2.50 cm were the lowest (0.00%), and the embryo abortion rate was as high as 100%. The embryo abortion rate of jujube fruits with a vertical length of 1.81 to 1.00 cm was lowest (91.89%). There were no significant differences in the kernel content rates and embryo abortion rates among fruits with other grades, and the embryo abortion rates were high. In the third batch, the kernel content rates were low, and all contained kernels were single. No jujube fruits containing double kernels were found. The kernel content rates of larger fruits (with vertical lengths >2.50 cm) and smaller fruits (vertical length range, 0.80–1.20 cm) were relatively lower. The kernel content rates of medium and large jujube fruits (vertical length, 1.81–2.00 cm) were relatively higher.\n\nThe embryo abortion situations of three batches of jujube fruits were compared (Fig. 4). There were some differences in embryo abortion among the three batches. Overall, the embryo abortion situations of fruits in the first batch and second batch were similar, whereas the embryo abortion situation of the third batch was significantly different from that of the first and second batches. In terms of the degree of abortion, the embryo abortion rate of fruits in the third batch was higher than those of the first and second batches. The fruits with higher embryo abortion rates were larger and smaller fruits, whereas the jujube fruits with higher kernel content rates were medium fruits. However, compared with the third batch, the jujube fruits of the first and second batches had relatively lower embryo abortion rates, and the small fruits had higher embryo abortion rates. Regarding the seeds contained, all the kernels contained in the jujube fruits of the third batch were single; however, double kernels were found in some fruits of the first and second batches of jujube fruits, although the double kernel rate was low.\n\nEmbryo abortion characteristics of jujube fruits on two types of bearing shoots.\n\nThere are two types of bearing shoots for fresh jujube in southern China, namely, the lignified bearing shoot and nonlignified bearing shoot (Yan et al., 2013; Wang and Yan, 2014; Wang et al., 2014, 2017). To further understand the embryo abortion situation of Z. jujuba Mill. ‘Zhongqiusucui’, the jujube fruits on two types of bearing shoots were classified according to their vertical length and their embryo abortion rates were statistically analyzed.\n\nTable 4 shows significant differences in the embryo abortion rates of jujube fruits of different sizes on lignified bearing shoots. The kernel content rate of fruits with vertical lengths of 0.80 to 1.00 cm was the lowest (0.69%), and the embryo abortion rate was as high as 99.31%. All the contained seeds were single. Jujube fruits with vertical lengths of 1.01 to 1.20 cm had the second highest kernel content rate and an abortion rate of 99.24%; all the kernels contained were single. The kernel content rate of fruits with vertical lengths greater than 2.5 cm was highest (8.82%); all contained seeds were single. Jujube fruits with vertical lengths of 2.01 to 2.50 cm had the second highest kernel content rate (4.13%), and some fruits contained double kernels. In general, the kernel content rate of the jujube fruits on the lignified bearing shoot was low. Most contained kernels were single, but a few were double. The kernel content rate of large fruits (vertical length >2.00 cm) was relatively higher. The kernel content rate of small fruits (vertical length range, 0.80–1.20 cm) was lower.\n\nAs shown in Table 5, there were significant differences in the embryo abortion rates of jujube fruits of different sizes on nonlignified bearing shoots. The kernel content rate of fruits with vertical lengths of 0.80 to 1.00 cm was the lowest (0.93%), and the embryo abortion rate was as high as 99.07%; all kernels were single. Jujube fruits with vertical lengths ranging from 1.21 cm to 1.40 cm had the second highest kernel content rate, and their embryo abortion rate was 99.05%; all seeds were double. The kernel content rate of jujube fruits with vertical lengths greater than 2.50 cm was the highest (16.67%), and their embryo abortion rate was the lowest, 83.33%; some kernels contained were double. Jujube fruits with a vertical length of 2.01 to 2.50 cm had the second highest kernel content rate (6.59%). There was no significant difference in kernel content rates among jujube fruits of other grades; the embryo abortion rates of jujube fruits of other grades were higher and the kernels contained in these fruits were all single. Overall, the kernel content rate of jujube fruits on nonlignified bearing shoots was low; the kernels of most jujube fruits containing seeds were single, and a small number of them contained double seeds. The kernel content rate of large fruits (vertical length >2.00 cm) was relatively higher. The kernel content rates of small fruits (vertical length range, 0.80–1.00 cm) and medium fruits (vertical length range, 1.21–1.40 cm) were relatively lower.\n\nThe embryo abortion situations of jujube fruits on two types of bearing shoots were compared (Fig. 5). Overall, the embryo abortion degree of fruits on lignified bearing shoots was higher than that of nonlignified bearing shoots. The probability of double kernels contained in jujube fruits on nonlignified bearing shoots was higher than that of jujube fruits on lignified bearing shoots. The higher kernel content rate of the two types of bearing shoots was found mainly for the large and medium fruits, and the lower kernel content and higher abortion rates were found mainly for small fruits."
