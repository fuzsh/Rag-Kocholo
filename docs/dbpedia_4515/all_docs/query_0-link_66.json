        "text": "Title: Flatliners (1990)\n\nTagline: Some lines shouldn’t be crossed.\n\nSummary: Third-year medical students decide to play with life and death, “flatlining” themselves into death to explore the great beyond. But Death doesn’t like being fucked with and consequences abound.\n\nNote: This film has a metric ton of medical terminology – which I do my best to unpack and explain – as well as dealing with several suicide(s) and/or attempts. It’s not exactly a happy film. It may be too heavy for some in the current 2020 year of the pandemic.\n\nInitial Thoughts:\n\nWell, here we are.\n\nLook. Flatliners is one of my holiest of holies: a movie I almost vowed never to recap, because to recap means to pick it apart and show all its faults to the world. I know this movie is flawed as fuck. It is far from perfect. Great concept, not so amazing story execution. It is a time capsule film, staring a bunch of actors that were (unfairly?) lumped in with The Brat Pack, which meant critics could (unfairly) label it a Brat Pack movie and clobber it in reviews. “St Elmo’s Funeral” and “The Breakfast Club Dies” were actually jokes made by Sutherland in a press interview with Fangoria Magazine. Kinda sums it up, really. [Wing: I want to watch The Breakfast Club Dies, honestly.]\n\nYes, it does star Kevin Bacon (Earth’s mightiest hero?), Kiefer Sutherland (post-vampire, pre-Bauer), and Julia Roberts (oh well), along side one of the lesser Baldwin brothers, William [JC: Lesser? Not . . . really? Billy was a top-tier Baldwin in the 90s. Until he wasn’t. Stephen and Daniel, the true lesser Baldwins, never reached Billy and Alec’s tier.], and (Dove and I share custody of) Oliver Platt [JC: Gee, guys, save some Platt for the rest of us, huh? I’m all good as long as I can stake claim to him in Lake Placid.] [bat: Please, go ahead, I’ve only seen parts of that and I don’t remember it at all. Placid!Platt is all yours, JC!] [Dove: I feel I’ve seen that movie, but can’t remember it. He’s all yours.] [Wing: I love Lake Placid, but could not care less about Oliver Platt, so as long as I get the movie, I’ll bow out of this fight.] Out of all of those, at the time, none were true Brat Pack(ers). Bacon, maybe? To contextualize this for people not born during this particular historical period, the biggest thing to come out of this film was the engagement of Sutherland and Roberts. Literally.\n\nRoberts broke off her engagement to Dylan McDermott – with whom she had co-starred in Steel Magnolias – to date and subsequently get engaged uber-quickly to Sutherland. This is the same woman who lived with / dated Liam freaking Neeson when she was 19 in a weird romantic / fatherly relationship. At the time she gravitated towards older men who would “take care of” her.\n\nSo she goes from 29 year old Dylan McDermott to 24 year old, once-divorced, father of one Sutherland. Dude from a very broken home and much blended family, who got a much older widowed mother of one pregnant when he was 20 years old and subsequently did marry her. But of course, because of course, it didn’t last and although they broke up the divorce wasn’t official until 1990, the year this movie dropped. (Long estrangements before divorces are a pattern he has.) I do believe that they became involved on-set, before the divorce decree, but that marriage was already done so whatever.\n\nDon’t worry, I’m getting to my point.\n\nSo 23 year old Roberts decides that 24 year old Sutherland is the one and they get engaged and, oh my god, it is the number one topic of Hollywood press rags for MONTHS. Seriously, if anything, the fact this happened in an age before social media is a blessing. Yeah, anyone and their dog would drop a dime and tip off the press / paparazzi back in the 1990s but social media would have clobbered the fuck out of both of them. Anyway, they are set to have a literal Hollywood wedding in June 1991.\n\nBy the time Flatliners is in the can, Roberts is blowing up in Hollywood. Pretty Woman, the movie she is best known for, drops and America goes insane for her. (I have never seen that movie and never care to.) Jealousy moves in. Roberts stars in Sleeping with the Enemy; Sutherland has Young Guns, Promised Land, and Flashback, under his belt. Roberts gets signed to Hook and Dying Young. They are the hottest young Hollywood power couple.\n\nFlatliners drops like a rock at the box office. Sutherland gets a shitty tattoo on his arm to profess his love for Roberts. (A Japanese kanji symbol. Ugh. I’m pretty damn sure it’s been covered up by now, but you can see it in Young Guns II, when Doc is in the tub reciting poetry at Jane Greathouse’s “respectable” bordello. When two vampires from very different vampire films collide on screen in a Western!) Wedding is now scheduled, 150 guests, four-tier wedding cake, four sea foam green bridesmaid dresses with matching hand-dyed $425 Manolo Blahnik shoes, ceremony to be paid for by and held at 20th Century Fox’s Soundstage 14.\n\nAnd it all blows up just days before the ceremony. Roberts takes off to Ireland in the arms of Jason Patric, Sutherland’s costar in The Lost Boys. Sutherland only finds out he’s been dumped second hand. Wah wah.\n\n“Kiefer,” said Flatliners director Joel Schumacher before he took his phone off the hook, “is in a situation where you either grow up very fast or you die. If there’s such a thing as an old soul, he has one.”\n\nForever and ever, Flatliners will be associated with one of the most ill-fated romances of all time. It’s ironic that Sutherland’s character lusts after Roberts’ character in the film but does not end up with her. Fiction meets reality, I guess.\n\nAnd what of Joel Schumacher, who recently passed away in June? The director who recognized Sutherland’s talents on-screen during a three-second blip in the film At Close Range and immediately wanted to cast him as David, Sutherland’s second-most iconic role. in The Lost Boys? [JC: . . . wait, what’s the first-most iconic? 24? . . . See, to me, there are two Sutherlands – 80s & early-to-mid-90s Sutherland, when I was going through my Sutherland Appreciation Phase and watched everything of his that was readily available; and post-Freeway and Dark City Sutherland, when he was super creepy/gross characters and I realized I was only into him in Stand By Me and The Lost Boys, and I stopped caring. (Sorry, bat.)] [bat: Yes. 24 / Jack Bauer is what 99% of the world knows him for. And you’re right, there’s like a giant dividing line in his career, when he was making terrible films just for money – Freeway, An Eye for an Eye, Woman Wanted, Truth or Consequences, N.M., to name a few – most of which were terrible characters. He’s done all right with TV characters but the film characters continue to be horrible. Corvus, anyone? (No apologies needed, JC. I pretty much agree. Except I love Dark City.)] [JC: Oh, yeah, Dark City is great. Sutherland is just a creepy fuck in it. And I was apologizing for snubbing your boy when he’s anything other than a teen hooligan or vampire lol] [bat: Please don’t feel bad, I snub a lot of his movies just on principle of him not playing the types of characters I love lol]\n\nFlatliners will always be one of his best films. Aesthetically, visually, artistically, it is beautifully filmed and staged for dramatic effect. The music, the locations, the closeups on the actors’ faces, the way the scenes are blocked, all Schumacher. The score written by James Newton Howard (who also scored Pretty Woman) is also so very Schumacher. It’s moody and dark, with bright flashes. Schumacher knew how to work a visual to maximum effect and Flatliners is the goddamn pinnacle of that.\n\nSeriously, if I was ever held at gun point and made to describe my aesthetic, I would say Flatliners. Shocking, I know, you all expect me to say The Lost Boys, and that would probably be second.\n\nIt’s funny. I didn’t see the movie until well into my teens. I lived though all that was outlined above but I barely remember it. I just didn’t care. I was 9 when Flatliners dropped and I remember the trailer being melodramatically freaky but that’s about it. It would be another year before I saw The Lost Boys and it wasn’t until around 1993 that I started to really understand that I could basically access a whole back catalog of Sutherland’s films on VHS. Hey, Jurassic Park dropped in 1992. I was much more interested in dinosaurs, okay!\n\nBeyond the visual elements and the cast, Flatliners hit a nerve in me that not a lot of people my age had. I grew up with older parents and with that comes older friends and relatives of said parents. I attended a lot of funerals as a child. By the time I found Flatliners, I was the decidedly “not afraid of death” child in my group of friends, at least from the viewpoint of having lost relatives and (by that point) at least one of my four grandparents. (At the time of this writing, my last surviving grandmother has passed away. [JC: Condolences. Mine passed a few years ago, and it’s such a weird feeling to have an entire generation of your family just not be here anymore.] [Wing: That’s interesting. My parents are also older when they adopted me, old enough that I spent most of my life without any grandparents, and in fact almost all of my aunts and uncles have died, too. (And their kids are significantly older than me.) I have such a skewed view of generations because of it. (My oldest sister is around 20 years older than I am.)]) The fact that medical students were playing with (limited) technology to explore the afterlife hit me in a way that made it fascinating. I share more than a little of Nelson Wright’s curiosity about death. (Also, the hit television show E.R. was just around the corner and I’ve always had a side interest in all things medical, so this movie works on multiple levels for me.)\n\nSo why subject a beloved film to a recap? Well, it turns 30 years old this year (August 10th) [Wing: Today, in fact! Happy anniversary, movie!] and the passing of Joel Schumacher (RIP) has left me saddened, and to get Dove and JC to comment on it, I have to do the heavy lifting. [Wing: And I invite myself along, as I often do. This is the joy of being the one who manages most of the schedule.] Whatever. I’ll enjoy the next 114 minutes, no problem. [JC: This is the first super-in-depth bat recap I’ve commented on, and I’m not gonna lie – it’s a little intimidating. When bat loves a thing, bat pulls out ridiculous layers of knowledge/research. I will have nothing to add to those segments other than admiration.] [Dove: I know, right? I thought Three Musketeers would be a gleeful romp through the nostalgia – and it was, but it was also reams of research. bat goes hardcore.]\n\nThank you, Schumacher, for giving me this and The Lost Boys to shape my world and become comfort watching films. Also, I loved The Client and A Time to Kill, two of his other films. And Car Wash, which was one of the first films I saw and still enjoy to this day. And he’s also responsible for introducing me to Sutherland. See, I’m totally in Schumacher’s debt. This recap is dedicated to your legacy, man. Thank you.\n\nAnd end on the trailer that gives away all yet nothing…\n\nRecap:\n\nAh, the old Columbia Pictures logo.\n\nDarkness.\n\nThe distant strains of a choir.\n\nBecause the opening of this film not only sets the tone and feel with the choir and music, and is visually stunning to boot, please view it to properly enjoy/set the mood:\n\n(EDIT: God damn it, YT pulled the video clip. FUCK. Well, go find a DVD or Laserdisc or something and watch the opening of the movie!)\n\nYesssssssssssssssssssssssss.\n\n(Now I can break this down.)\n\nWe open on dawn illuminating Lorado Taft’s Fountain Of Time, a massive (126 feet long) hollow-cast concrete statue that is reinforced with steel, cast via 4,500 molds, that took roughly two years to build. It resides on the western edge of the Midway Plaisance within Washington Park in Chicago, Illinois. It was dedicated in 1922, although planning stretches back clear to, um, 1913. I mean, really, everything began with the grant funded by Benjamin Ferguson’s 1905 gift of $1 million to the city, but you can read all that in the wiki article.\n\nNow, on to the subject matter. The sculpture depicts Father Time, complete with scythe, watching the “life cycle” of humanity, viewed through 100 figures arranged in an ellipse, with “overall pyramidal geometry”. It’s a damn allegory, okay. BUT! What a fitting statue to use in a movie about medical students trying to tease secrets from Death!\n\nWe view part of the statue, the time lapse clouds flowing steadily overhead, before the choir bursts forth as the title card appears:\n\nOn the left is the Statue of The Republic, a 24 foot gilded bronze replica of the 65 foot high statue that was originally created for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago. The original was destroyed by fire, so this recreation was made and dedicated on the 25h anniversary of the Exposition, as well as the centennial of Illinois’ statehood. It is meant to symbolize national unity in the way that all allegorical representations of philosophical concepts do, ala the Statue of Liberty. (Does that sentence make any sense?) [JC: *nods smartly* *tries to look like she knows what she’s doing*]\n\nAnyway, Chicago’s “Golden Lady” is located in Jackson Park. Her right hand holds a globe with an eagle with wings spread perches on it while her left hand grasps a staff with a plaque that reads “liberty“, partly obscured by a laurel wreath. Hello more statues that set the theme and speak to the concepts this movie is trying to depict!\n\nSutherland’s the top billing and gets his name next to the face of the Golden Lady.\n\nWe see SCIENTIA carved on the wall of a building next, we’re into Latin now. (This is also a reference to Nelson Wright being a “man of science”, but we’ll get into that a little later.)\n\nNext up is Julia Roberts, who’s name appears over what I’m guessing to be a statue of a Madonna. I’m struggling to find the statue online, but basing this on the halo around the statue’s head and how that usually figures into religious iconography. (This also plays into Rachel Manus being the only woman in the group, though I wouldn’t necessarily say she’s the character who is most religious.)\n\nWe move on to Madonna della Strada chapel, located on the campus of Loyola University Chicago. Basically, the film is set on an unnamed medical school campus but was shot almost entirely on campus at Loyola University Chicago. The camera pans back as it shows the entrance to the chapel, MADONNA engraved in the circular artwork around the door. William Baldwin’s card appears and if any of the characters are “religious”, it would be Joe Hurley. Ugh. More on that later.\n\nA little bit more on the chapel. The English version of the Italian name is “Our Lady of the Good Road“, which amuses me, because MORE SYMBOLISM. The students are “traveling” the road between life and death. The chapel is built on the lakefront with the waters of Lake Michigan directly at its front doorstep. I’ve never held any interest in getting married in a church but if I had to pick one, I’d totally put this at the top of my list. Also, I’ve just learned that an annual “Midnight Organ Blast” is held at midnight on Halloween. Damn. Chicago, stop giving me reasons to visit you!\n\nWe move to another statue but I haven’t a clue what it is, what it depicts, or where it is. We see RELIGION, carved the same as SCIENTIA, as Oliver Platt’s title comes up, followed by another statue I cannot find, and finally Kevin Bacon as MEDIC comes up.\n\nNow it’s a bronze relief carving of Hermes / Mercury fighting Death for the caduceus staff. It blips through, showing only enough for me to know what it basically is. (Edit: tie-in novel says it depicts the Grim Reaper clutching the caduceus and a scythe, while the man is Aesculapius, who hasn’t quite got his hand around the caduceus.) MOAR SYMBOLISM!!\n\nThen we get to something Schumacher loved doing: helicopter-shot pan-over of the water! This type of shot was used in the opening of The Lost Boys to great effect, although I think of this version in Flatliners as its opposite. This is sunrise over Lake Michigan, the water barely choppy as it washes the rocks onshore. Sunlight glints off the windows of a brick building, reminding us this is early morning. In the background, from left to right, sits the Mundelein College building, the Madonna della Strada chapel, a building no one seems able to identify and that no longer exists but has been replaced with the modern building housing the Loyola Information Commons (it’s literally built out over where Sutherland stands in the opening scene, boo), and finally… this one is giving me a headache. Current maps say it is Cudahy Library and for the most part, I’m agreeing, but the dome on the building doesn’t feature in the photos I can find. Here’s the thing:\n\n”For instance, to create the university’s fictional Taft Building, we constructed a large promenade set on the lake shore campus at Loyola University, and then used matte paintings to connect the set and the campus exterior with Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry,” Schumacher said.\n\nGod damn it, Joel. You did the same damn thing in The Lost Boys, why am I surprised.\n\nI am barely a minute and a half into this film and have written ALL THE ABOVE which has taken almost two hours so let’s keep moving.\n\nThe shot continues to zoom in closer and as the buildings move into better alignment, I am more convinced that’s Cudahy Library, because the map I just found says it indeed does have a green dome on it (which you can so obviously see in the shot) and that green dome used to house an Observatory but the El train fucked up the calibration so it was scrapped. This is giving me a headache and I’m getting super fucking frustrated so I WILL JUST MOVE ON TO THE MOST INFAMOUS LINE FROM THIS FILM.\n\nThe camera shot finally zooms in close enough so we see a lone figure – blond male, early 20s, green designer trench coat, black clothing, sunglasses – hop over the concrete barrier onto the boulders that ring the shoreline. He walks a few steps to stand beside a (built for the movie) light fixture as he surveys the sun rising over Lake Michigan, removing his sunglasses and pulling his coat tighter, as it’s fucking freezing.\n\nThe music crescendos as we view the sun, a tiny globe in the vast distance of the sky, illuminating everything in a golden hue as it time lapse speeds higher into the sky. The camera smash cuts back to Nelson Wright, as he smiles to himself and intones,\n\n“Today is a good day to die.”\n\n[JC: . . . am I the only Trekkie around here? Because:] [bat: I don’t know? Dove? Wing?] [Dove: I think so.] [Wing: Absolutely not. Worf was one of my first childhood crushes, and I grew up watching TNG obsessively. I still rewatch it sometimes.]\n\nNOW WE ARE TWO MINUTES IN AND I’M EXHAUSTED and this is why I didn’t want to recap this. I learned to put so much detail and symbolism into stories because of Schumacher and oh my god that was a fuckton of googling I accomplished, not to mention watching two videos, and using Google maps to sort out buildings. I swear, the movie goes pretty quick for 114 minutes but I don’t think there’s going to be a ton more I have to explain/describe like this. At least not in the next scene.\n\nWHICH WE SMASH RIGHT INTO. Nelson barely finishes speaking before we are immediately shown a man screaming. Someone in medical scrubs is trying to hold him onto the gurney, the man still shouting and causing a fuss. The guy in scrubs is David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon) and he asks the attending physician what’s wrong. “A crack head, get some help.” Labraccio runs from the room, through some sets of double doors and past some religious statuary, into the hall. A woman is on a gurney, her husband clinging to the rolling bed as a nurse calls out vital signs. The woman is dying as she is hemorrhaging out. (The tie-in novel goes into more detail. The woman had a street abortion and it was badly botched. Expect more tidbits from the tie-in novel to appear as needed. Why, yes, of course there’s a novelization.) [Wing: Where’s Jake Houseman to fix botched abortions when you need him? Brief look at how, despite it being legal, abortion was (and remains) difficult for many people to access. Thanks, Muricah.]\n\nHERE’S A BIG FAT NOTE: There is a LOT of medical terminology in this film. The actors literally had to train in the basics just to get the lingo down. I have picked up a lot of it over the years from reading Michael Crichton books and just on my own, as I like medical stuff. I am not going to sit here and recap the literal terminology. I will surmise what is going on, sure. That’s easier on both myself and you, whomever is reading this.\n\nDuring the fast-paced exchange, Labraccio makes a gut decision that the bleed is from the uterine artery. He pulls hard on the gurney, redirecting everyone into an operating room. He insists he will do the surgery, that the woman will die before a doctor arrives. One of the nurses, though convinced this action will get everyone fired, continues to prep the woman for immediate surgical intervention. The orderly removes the husband, who screams and calls his wife’s name. The other nurse, who appeared in the hallway, backs out and disappears, suspiciously.\n\nThe patient is intubated and Labraccio has the scalpel, cutting the patient open and finding the bleeding artery. He clamps it. The nurse announces, “You’ve got her!” just as an actual surgeon rushes into the OR. He demands Labraccio leave, immediately, as the nurse tries to cover her ass by saying she tried to stop Labraccio. Uh huh.\n\nIn the hallway, Labraccio stares at the OR, knowing he’s done the right thing but here come the consequences, in the form of an older woman. One of the head doctors, who immediately asks him what the hell is he doing. Uh oh. The camera zooms in close on Labraccio’s face just before we SMASH CUT again to the outside of the former Palace of Fine Arts building, now known as the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.\n\nThe same elaborate light fixtures liter the exterior, tying it into the opening sequence from the lakeside. The grounds are torn up, grass gone, (actually, there’s a lake? but they filmed from an angle to hide that) construction barriers with those slow flashing yellow lights everywhere, with yellow tape strung between them. In the tie-in novel it is named the “Taft building”, 80 years old and in need of renovation. It is also very much described as a “laboratory”, which is fitting for our movie about death experimentation. The building is closed off, accessible only to workers. Also, 1989, meaning there’s probably few to zero security cameras.\n\nTHIS IS HOW NELSON GETS AWAY WITH HIS EXPERIMENT. Which, you would think, would be something the movie would explain. But it doesn’t. It does factor in and there’s some consequences to picking a building that is being renovated but we’ll get there when we get there.\n\nNelson wanders down the path before pausing to make sure he’s alone. From there he runs in to the lower part of the building, putting his plan into action. (The tie-in novel explains how he secures entry and fixes the doors for later reentry.) But first, let’s take a detour!\n\nWe move into a dorm room (?) of sorts. Meet Randall Steckle (Oliver Platt) who is obsessed with inventing a title to his as-yet-forthcoming-autobiography. Problem? He’s not a surgeon yet. He speaks into a small handheld cassette recorder, rejecting various ideas as he pours himself a large cup of coffee. He eventually settles on “Genesis of a Young Surgeon” and I just totally typed Young Guns before having to delete it. Sigh. [JC: Diary of a Young Bowtie-Wearer?] [bat: How appropo!]\n\nBack to Nelson. The main room is a large one with a glass rotunda ceiling. The walls are decorated with elaborate paintings of the history of medicine housed in arched niches, the marble floors decorated in an elaborate art deco pattern. I swear to god, this is my aesthetic so hard. Workers gather to restore the artwork, the room draped in various plastic panels, ladders and paint cans everywhere. Nelson appears, wandering down a hallway, a red NO ADMITTANCE sign our only indication he is where he should not be.\n\nThe workers immediately notice him and Nelson does the one thing you should do in this kind of situation. Confidently pretend you are right where you’re supposed to be. He says good morning, compliments them on their work, and encourages them to “keep it up” [Dove: Urban explorers call this “the hi-viz jacket of invisibility” on some forums I frequented a few years ago. (Sometimes the jacket is real, sometimes it’s just a metaphor.)]. [Wing: This works in so many situations. So. Many.] The workers shrug and continue setting up for the day. Nelson walks off through the length of the room, in which we see the lattice metal work over the windows and a very large metal statue head on a rolling wooden platform. Although I cannot identify it – a god/goddess in a wing’d helmet – it could be the head of Hermes. It makes sense. I’ll check the tie-in novel as we go along to see if it’s identified.\n\nAnd one last deviation before we continue. The movie was produced by Michael Douglas – yes, that Michael Douglas – from a script/story written by Peter Filardi, whom based the story on the near-death experience of a friend. There, that completes my housekeeping duties. On with the recap.\n\nWe move away from Nelson retreating to what appears to be a care facility. At first we see an older man, grey beard and watery eyes, listening as a woman speaks. Another younger woman with curly blonde hair, listens intently to the woman in the hospital bed recount her experience of dying and what happened as she left her body. (I’m pointing this out because not only can I, but it’s another case of Schumacher working with the same actors again and again. The woman speaking is actress Beth Grant. She appears in Speed – the woman who tries to get off the bus and dies – and played the mother character to Sutherland’s Freddie Lee Cobb in A Time to Kill, which Oliver Platt was also in.) [Dove: She’s also the teacher that locks Andy Barclay in his classroom in Child’s Play 2. And she does not age. She has been that age forever. And still is now.]\n\nAcross from the patient telling the story sits a young auburn-haired woman, scribbling intently in a notebook, wearing thick glasses. Meet Rachel Manus, med student, who takes work in the hospital rehab / care facility. She looks over her shoulder to make sure no one’s coming, as the patient continues her “out of body” story. Rachel squeezes her hand as she finishes, being the compassionate one of the group.\n\nThe elderly gentleman announces he was “legally” dead for four and a half minutes but did not experience a tunnel or see a light. The young blonde interrupts him and counters she saw a tunnel. He goes on to explain about a garden but the young blonde talks over him, much to his and my annoyance. Teri needs to have her meds adjusted, Rachael says. [JC: Teri needs to learn some goddamn manners, I say.] [Dove: I could never work out whether that was Rachael’s medical opinion or some tone-deaf sass. Either way, not cool.] [Wing: Fuck you, Rachael.]\n\nA loud whistle breaks up the party, a signal for Rachel to quit talking to patients about near-death experiences and get back to work. An older woman joins her and warns her there was a lot of trouble in the ER today so Rachel better watch her ass. Rachel dodges the question about why she’s always asking patients about death.\n\nON TO CLASS!\n\nClass, as it were, is held in a very large round room. On the slabs are cadavers, covered in gauzy material to obscure their faces and preserve some modesty. This is pretty accurate, or at least it was. (I’d highly recommend Mary Roach’s Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, if you want to know more. Hell, any of her books, really, as they are all fantastic.) Steckle has been describing arthritis as we move around the cadaver. Nelson inserts the blade of a scalpel into the ball of the cadaver’s foot (in the tie-in novel they are carving a game of tic-tac-toe into the foot, no lie) and reminds Steckle to bring all his talent tonight. Well, Steckle is having second thoughts about that. He wants to decline on moral grounds.\n\n“Isn’t there enough atrocity in the world without your own little horror?” Steckle asks.\n\nNelson promptly argues, “When did truth and knowledge become a horror?” before flattering the fuck out of Steckle. At least Steckle chokes on a laugh, knowing Nelson is playing to his ego.\n\n[Wing: Well, truth and knowledge can be pursued in horrors. Examples: Bodies…The Exhibition is an intriguing look at human bodies broken down into pieces, but there is understandable controversy around the source of the cadavers. Science is built on racism and the use of Black bodies for research without permission. Mental health treatment included terrible experimentation.]\n\nWe see Rachel walking quickly into the room, late. She takes her place beside her designated cadaver, examining her tools. And here we meet Joey Hurley (William Baldwin) who greets her before immediately asking if she’s dating anyone. Ugh. Rachel deflects Joe by pointing at something in the exposed digestive system of the cadaver. Joe rattles off the answer, continuing to pester her.\n\nWe see Nelson, scowling, from the shadows, as he and Steckle work on their own assigned cadaver. (This is a prime example of how a simple facial expression can take on multi-level meaning when Sutherland does it. I love it!)\n\nJoe is telling Rachel it’s great to make conversation and be open. She demands he identify again, which he does in almost a backhanded dismissive way. That’s when he goes in for the kill. He’s heard all the nicknames and rumors about Rachel but he’s personally sure she’s not frigid or repressed. [JC: Joe takes his negging very seriously. Ugh, indeed.] To cap it off, he lifts the gauze and exposes the cadaver’s male genitalia. “Identify?”\n\n“YOUR BRAINS.” snaps Rachael.\n\n(Yes, we all hate Joe. It doesn’t get better, it only gets worse.)\n\nJoe, unfazed, asks if Rachel wants to come to his place, so they can “study”. Me, I would have stabbed him with a scalpel. Rachel doesn’t get a chance to do so, or even knee him in the balls, as here comes Nelson. He politely informs Joe he needs a word with Dr Manus, pulling her to the side of the room. Yay.\n\nBut it’s only because of Nelson’s self-serving interests. Rachel reminds him she already said no to his experiment. He counters he’s secured Steckle and Joe, “two of the top G.P.A.s in the school”, and all Rachel has to do is handle injections and the I.V. Sure, easy. “I have no interest in watching you kill yourself,” Rachel snaps.\n\n“I think you do,” Nelson counters in a very confident manner. Because, duh, she does. Rachel doesn’t have a chance to answer; the professor enters and announces the exam will be scaled, with only three As given though the rest of the letter grades down to four Fs. The students groan, as it’s clear who will be vying for the three As. “Piece of cake!” Steckle crows.\n\nPost-exam, in the men’s locker room, Nelson leads the way as Joey and Steckle trail behind, espousing on how there’s many students with the ability to perform an experiment such as this but not the nerve. Steckle scoffs but Joe taunts Nelson, saying it’ll be dramatic. Nelson will cry and faint, “puke at best” but Joe doesn’t believe Nelson has the balls to go through with this.\n\nNelson replies, “You just bring the equipment. I’ll bring my balls.” COMPLETE WITH TRADEMARKED SUTHERLAND SMIRK HELLO I MISSED YOU. [Dove: One of my favourite sassy lines in the movie.]\n\nThat’s when a student appears and promptly asks Nelson: “Did you, uh, hear about Labraccio?”\n\nSMASH CUT to Labraccio throwing a duffel bag out the second storey window, landing it at Nelson’s feet. Nelson chides him that he’s only been suspended for four months and it won’t affect his scholarship. Labraccio doesn’t care. He’s quitting! He proceeds to rappel down the side of his building. Kinda dramatic, eh, Dave? [JC: I love it. Labraccio rappelling down the side of a building for no goddamn reason is just *chef’s kiss*] [bat: Also symbolic of Labraccio being at the top of the pack skills-wise in the group and coming down to their level to impart his gifts.] [Wing: I’m pretty sure a 4-month suspension absolutely would affect his scholarship, Nelson.] Nelson continues to harangue Labraccio, saying he’s the best student at the school and they’re not going to let him walk away.\n\nThen he goes in for the kill. Nelson tells Labraccio he was wrong to do what he did. Labraccio flips out, reminding Nelson the woman was dying, what would he have done?\n\nNelson deflects, saying Labraccio is taking this personally and the school is only making an example of Labraccio to cover its ass insurance-wise. (Please note that Nelson does not answer Labraccio’s question. Speaks volumes.) Labraccio insists he doesn’t care, he’d make the same decision, but he’s quitting for good now.\n\nSo, Nelson being Nelson, appeals to Labraccio’s moral authority. He reminds Labraccio that this is exactly why he needs him to attend the experiment. Labraccio says although there’s people he’d like to kill, Nelson is not currently one of them.\n\n“Hey, I don’t want to die,” Nelson counters. He wants to come back with all the answers, to both life and death. Nelson explains he can get to death with the others but Labraccio is key to his return to the land of the living. “I need you to bring me back, please.” Wow, way to pressure the guy, Nelson.\n\nSeriously, I could write a paper on how manipulative Nelson is and all the methods he uses, calculating what works on each of his “friends” and how he wields his words to best effect. It’s really fascinating. [JC: I know J.K. Rowling being J.K. Rowling has pretty much ruined Harry Potter at this point, but I couldn’t help thinking that Nelson is definitely a Slytherin.] [bat: You’re right. He’s smart but not smart enough to be a Ravenclaw. Slytherin would snatch him up in half a heartbeat. And Labraccio is totally Gryffindor.] [Wing: I don’t know about not being smart enough to be in Ravenclaw. It’s more like he’s ruthless and ambitious enough to overwhelm that intelligence.]\n\nLabraccio refuses. Tactic fail.\n\nNelson immediately gets huffy, like a child who’s toy was taken away, upbraiding Labraccio to walk away and go “climb a mountain”, that he no longer understands him. How he can burn his medical career on a complete stranger but turn his back on a friend? Labraccio just gives Nelson a look, untying the straps on the canvas roof of his Army surplus truck.\n\nKnowing that was the wrong tactic, Nelson switches gears, goes into apology mode. (THIS CHARACTER IS A WORK OF ART!) He goes back to appealing to Labraccio’s need to help others, lamenting his chances of return being slim if Labraccio doesn’t help. “So don’t do it,” Labraccio growls.\n\nNelson scoffs, walking away, pausing to ask, “What if it works?” (I immediately swoon and die. Damn it, it’s the eyebrow thing. Yes, make fun of me. [JC: Nah, I get it. A good eyebrow is a powerful thing.]) As Nelson walks away, Labraccio manages a smile. Face it, he’s intrigued but is it enough to secure him participating?\n\nBack to Rachel, who is on shift in the ward, tending to patients. She pushes a cart over towards a row of beds, stopping at one with a very elderly woman in it. In the next bed is Teri, listening to a Walkman, surrounded by huge bouquets of flowers, Mylar balloons, and teddy bears. Rachel steps over and swipes a bouquet of roses, setting it on the nightstand beside the elderly woman, smiling.\n\nThe elderly woman worries the bed clothes between her fists, telling Rachel she doesn’t want to be buried on a Saturday, it costs $150 dollars extra for that. Rachel attempts to comfort her, saying she’s doing better, tucking the sheets in. The old lady isn’t buying it and Rachel knows her words are hollow.\n\nA church bell rings. We smash cut to what appears to be an off-campus flat. On the lower floor, a skeleton sits at a desk, a cigar stuck in between its teeth. The flat is messy and there are posters on the glass block wall of…. uhhhh… Nixon? I can’t identify the other two, I’m old but not that old. They read “SEX” “DRUGS” “ROCK & ROLL” under the images. We hear the sounds of sex. The shot floats to the loft level, revealing Joe plowing an unknown woman. He’s working hard or hardly working.\n\nThe phone rings. Joe’s busy. He looks up with a knowing smile, as the shot changes to reveal he has placed a handheld camcorder in the crotch of the beams that hold up the ceiling. This fucking pervert is recording this sexual encounter. Yeah. This was bad then, it’s still bad now. I would go off on a tangent about this character, whom I have always hated, because most of me thinks the character is worthless and adds nothing to this story. Now that I am older, I can see the message the writer was trying to impart but still, I hate this whole arc.\n\nThe view flips to what the camcorder is filming, the image turning a grainy black and white. Joe works himself for the camera, which basically proves he doesn’t care who he’s fucking, he just likes to watch himself fucking. Seriously, this scene has always made me want to throw up since the very first time I watched this film. [JC: I have never cared for William Baldwin. This . . . isn’t helping.] [Dove: I’ve only seen this and the firefighter movie he was in, but isn’t this his whole acting rage? Sexy dude who has sex? Might explain why his brothers are getting more work now they’re all older.]\n\nThe answering machine switches on. (Remember those?) Nelson’s voice comes on the line. He knows Joe is home. He reminds him to not be late and not forget the camera. “What camera?” the blonde below Joe asks, alarmed. [Wing: Take his balls, woman. And then the camera.]\n\nSMASH CUT TO NELSON. (Thank god.) Nelson’s apartment is immaculately empty and clean, and oh so very white. It’s literally the opposite of my own home, void of life and so minimalist, only the bare necessities of life filling the huge space. The windows are fucking killer, tho. Like, my god. But seriously, I would lose my mind in a space that has no color. I can’t stand blank white walls. [Dove: I cannot comprehend how anyone can live in a space (such a huge space) with nothing beyond a bed in it (and some books in the recessed shelves). WHERE IS EVERYTHING?] [Wing: It’s empty. Like his soul.]\n\nANYWAY. Nelson hangs up and we hear a computer printer working, as he walks into the bedroom. Everything is pristine and immaculate and I don’t know whether to enjoy it or freak out. Nelson comes to stand in front of a mirror, staring at his reflection, clearly contemplating what he’s about to attempt. At this point, he is too self-assured to back out.\n\nHere we go.\n\nSmash cut to a sweeping side pan of the Taft building, the world dark, the flickering round yellow lights of the construction barriers flashing warning away anyone who comes near. Not just for the fact that the area isn’t safe, but also because five medical students are about to play god. Weird angled shots of statues who watch in silent testament, never to reveal what they have seen. Another shot of the fight between Death and Aesculapius, which the tie-in novel says is located inside the Taft building. Who will win tonight? (I LOVE SYMBOLISM!)\n\nThe music changes from a choir to something that sounds like it belongs in a heist movie. Steckle appears from behind the giant head of the statue, pushing a bunch of respiratory equipment. The room is dark and he moves swiftly but quietly, disappearing behind the plastic sheet that hangs behind the NO ADMITTANCE sign.\n\nHe enters a smaller room, breathing hard, ever alert to any sign of another’s presence. There is a clatter, sending Steckle to hide behind the respiratory equipment. It’s just Joe, who can’t fucking handle moving the gurney into place. “Ah, the bed,” Steckle snarks, joining his classmate. “Thank God he called a specialist.”\n\nSeriously, Platt always gets such wonderful lines! [JC: His whole reason for being here is to snark. Hey, just like me!]\n\nSteckle aids Joe in rolling the gurney into yet another room – hereafter referred to as the Dog Lab because that’s what it’s called in the tie-in novel – chiding his best friend that he thought Joe would grow up after becoming engaged. (Uhhh, I should add that it is explained in the tie-in novel that Joe and Steckle have been friends from childhood, Joe being the leader and Steckle the follower. Nelson picked them for the experiment because he knew between the two of them, everything would be documented between camcorder and cassette recorder. And the fact that Joe is totally unscrupulous and Steckle is a walking medical encyclopedia.) Joe counters that he’s “working things out” (sure) and only recording a few last adventures before resigning himself to a life of monogamy.\n\n“The words ‘pussy marauder’ do pop into mind occasionally.” Steckle, always with the best witty rejoinders!\n\nBoth finally manage to get the gurney into the Dog Lab, which is lit very dimly and is full of construction equipment. Steckle immediately freaks out, wondering why he’s agreed, that this could kill his medical career. Joe is still stuck on Nelson not going through with it.\n\nWell, the balls just arrived.\n\nNelson tells Steckle to not touch the light switch, as the lights will draw attention from security. He instructs them to set the equipment up over the grate, having brought in another rolling cart of equipment himself. Joe can’t believe they’re going through with this.\n\nI have so many questions about how medical students stole ALL THAT MEDICAL EQUIPMENT and casually transported it to an empty building being renovated, without being seen and/or caught. I realize that it was a different time and not like it is, 30 years later, but c’mon. That’s a fuckton of expensive equipment, plus all the vials of injections, and I don’t know, how does a crash cart go missing without someone asking questions??\n\nYES IT’S A MOVIE, I KNOW THAT, DISBELIEF BACK TO BEING SUSPENDED.\n\nMoving on.\n\nWARNING: DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME OR USE THE “TECHNIQUES” DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS. THIS IS A FUCKING MOVIE AND SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED BY ANYONE.\n\nFrom this point on, Nelson describes how this experiment is supposed to work. It’s a bunch of medical jargon spoken in a calm but rapid manner. I will summarize. (Oh good god I’ve never researched this; now that I have, I’m going to laugh myself to death.)\n\nBasically, Nelson wants his classmates to euthanize him like a dog.\n\nNo, seriously.\n\nHe gives the instructions that they are to take him “down” using 20cc Sodium Pentothal (which is a rapid-onset short-acting barbiturate general anesthetic commonly used in veterinary euthanasia) and nitrous oxide, while using a refrigerated blanket to lower his body temperature. There is chilled 5DW in the cooler = 5% glucose in water, aka SUGAR WATER – to be given in the I.V. When body temp hits 86 degrees, they are to shock his heart with 200 joules – the lowest setting used to defibrillate someone in cardiac arrest – to make it stop beating. When “the heart is dead”, they are to remove the nitrous oxide mask. From that point, when the EEG machine FLATLINES that means Nelson will be “exploring” because he will be legally brain dead.\n\nY’know, this all sounds fucking cool and mysterious when it’s being recited in the film but actually looking it up and understanding it, I’m crying with laughter at this level of basic stupid. Yes, it would “work” but I can’t imagine being a medical professional and watching this film and taking it seriously based on this scene. [Wing: Well, if it’s anything like me watching a legal drama, it’s less taking it seriously and more just not watching it at all. (I avoid legal dramas for the most part.) Or throwing things at the screen and shouting about the inaccuracies, if my litigation friends are an example.]\n\nShorter summation: euthanasia Nelson, shock his heart til it stops, let his brain die, then bring him back. After 30 seconds, which gives him about a minute in death give or take, they’re to flip the warming blanket on and bring him up to 93 degrees – slowly! – inject 1cc of adrenaline, wait a full minute, then shock him with the defibrillator. (Funny enough, they don’t really explain the how of bringing him back. At least not in full detail. I guess they just treat it as a normal patient who’s gone into full cardiac arrest / flatline and use the standard life saving measures used in that case. What a cop out.)\n\nJoe and Steckle are gobsmacked and also demand to know where Rachel is, since they can’t handle all this between the two of them. Nelson doesn’t answer, just says he’ll ready the injections.\n\nEverything will go according to plan. Nelson smiles as he readies the injections. Rachael appears, announcing he’ll come back with brain damage. Nelson will resemble a “Cabbage Patch Doll”, she says. Nelson counters it’s not happening if his body is held at 86 degrees. He taps the air from the needle, asking Rachel pointedly if she’ll handle the injections. After a beat, Rachel nods.\n\nSTECKLE HAS QUESTIONS. He wants to know, simply, why Nelson is doing this. (Well, Steckle, the tie-in novel would tell you exactly why but I don’t want to spoil that for Dove, since she went to all the trouble of finding a copy. Really, the movie explains it as the story unfolds but not as in detail as the novelization does. At some point I will be unable to avoid pulling stuff in to give better explanation but I’m doing my best to leave out what I can.)\n\nNelson just wants to see what’s out there beyond death. He says philosophy and religion have failed to answer the question so now it’s time for the physical science to gain answers. Okay. I mean, sort of. He has reasons. A real big reason, but let’s let the movie reveal that.\n\n“I think mankind deserves to know.”\n\n“So you’re doing this for mankind?”\n\nYeah, nobody believes you, Nelson. And here’s the letter Nelson printed out in his apartment, which legally absolves the others in case, you know, Nelson doesn’t survive this experiment. Joe snatches it and starts to look it over, while Steckle hits the nail on the head: “This isn’t for mankind! This is for Nelson! Why do I suddenly see on 60 Minutes, sandwiched between Andy Rooney and a Subaru commercial?? Tonight! A brilliant young medical student who dared to experience death and come back!”\n\nDamn it, I love you so much, Oliver Platt. [Dove: Same. The dude is awesome. He brings the snark to anything he’s involved in. Except 2012. Nobody could save the human part of that movie. The disaster part was pretty epic though.]\n\nOkay, so, while Steckle is severely dressing Nelson’s plan down as the egotistical and self-serving plan that it is, Nelson is… undressing. I tend to, um, lose coherent thought at this point. Funny how that is. Oh, for a time machine.\n\nSo, uh, um… Nelson tries to counter that “Fame is inevitable.” But Rachel objects that that is the wrong reason for doing this. I think I’m drooling. To distract them back to the task at hand, and I just noticed that the ridiculously expensive watch Nelson was wearing has been removed, Nelson instructs them to help him finish applying the electrodes.\n\nI’d also like to point out that around his neck is a simple chain with a gold cross. Which, considering how much Catholic iconography is in this film, kind of fits? Honestly, and I could be wrong here, the character of Nelson is not shown to be very religious but it is part of his background. I think, though, wouldn’t it have been wise to remove it? He took off the watch. Why leave the chain on? Someone explain??\n\n[Dove: This bugged the hell out of me. When I had my hip replaced, I was told to remove all metal jewellery. I removed everything but my earrings, because they are a bastard to close. Someone saw and told me to remove them as well. Then she asked if I had any other piercings. Hidden piercings. Because they needed to come out too. (I didn’t, btw, I had a plastic stud in my tongue.) I asked why, and she gave me a vague answer along the lines of “Blanket rule. Health and safety.” And then I figured out. If they needed to use anything with an electrical current on me for any reason, I may end up with burns or the metal jewellery could cause issues with it. You’d think a medical student might consider that.]\n\n[JC: bat, I know you’re distracted by shirtless Sutherland, but can we talk about whatever the fuck this thing is? Because that’s what’s got me distracted.] [Dove: Foreshadowing of the Silent Hill: Revelations scene?]\n\n[bat: Huh? *blinks though lust-filled haze* Uh, I’ve googled that but never seem to hit upon the right combination of words to give me an answer. I’ve always assumed it is for the restoration work, just a weird wall box to make sure the gloves don’t get contaminated or cross contaminate anything else. It could also be some kind of (lead?) shield where you’re protected but can use the gloves to work on whatever. That’s the best I got.]\n\nClimbing onto the gurney, the work light that Nelson hung from the I.V. pole shines what looks like a target onto his bare back. Rachel helps him remove his shoes while Steckle reads the letter in the moonlight shining in from the window. [Wing: Best way to read a legal document, when you can barely see it.] Nelson finishing applying the the electrode to his wrist, asking for nitrous oxide, so he can go out with a laugh. No one’s laughing, Nelson. Not even you.\n\nJoe switches on the electric blanket, covering Nelson, cooling him down to 86 degrees. “We’re all professionals. I’m sure this will go very smoothly,” Nelson announces.\n\n“Nelson, if you die, can I have your apartment?” Joe asks. Nelson is totally, abruptly, taken aback. “It was a joke!” Joe chuckles. No one is laughing. “One minute! Don’t be late,” Nelson orders, as Rachel finishes applying the electrodes.\n\nJoe turns to get his camcorder and start filming. Nelson makes Rachel promise she will go through with the full experiment. Rachel only nods. She moves to place the nitrous oxide mask on him, Nelson stopping her by asking, “What, no kiss goodbye?” Oh don’t you start now, too, Nelson.\n\n“I’ll see you soon, ” Rachel tells him, placing the mask on his face. Well, shot down, Nelson. You deserved that.\n\nJoe starts filming, everything turns grainy black and white. Steckle comes over, announcing the letter Nelson gave them means shit and begging Rachel and Joe to stop. “Let him sleep it off! He’ll have a wet dream and think he went to heaven, okay!” Joe agrees and stops filming. Rachel announces now she knows why she’s here. They’re finishing the experiment.\n\nSteckle starts to leave, Joe questioning Rachel if she’s willing to risk her career and future just so Nelson gets famous. Before she can answer, Steckle hears someone coming. He panics.\n\nIt’s just Labraccio, striding in like he’s cock of the walk, nothing to lose now. “Is he dead?” he asks, first thing. Nope, sleeping. Rachel is rubbing the paddles of the defibrillator together to ready them. Steckle thinks Labraccio is here to talk sense into everyone. “I’ll do it,” Labraccio tells Rachel, whipping off his jacket.\n\nRachel asks if Labraccio is taking over. “I’ve got nothing to lose,” he replies. Which is true. Steckle points out he could lose Nelson’s life. (me: WHEN THE FUCK DID THEY GIVE NELSON THE INJECTIONS?? THAT WASN’T SHOWN!) Labraccio insists he can bring Nelson back. Hello, ego! Rachel complains that she could have totally done all this without Labraccio. Probably? Maybe? I dunno.\n\n“NO!” Steckle objects, as the cooling blanket registers 86 degrees.\n\nAnd with that, Labraccio yells, “CLEAR!” and shocks the fuck out of Nelson.\n\nSuccess. Nelson is in asystole, as evidenced by the flat line on the heart monitor. Steckle and Joe object to everything happening, Steckle adding he did not come to medical school to murder his classmates, “no matter how deranged they might be!”\n\n“Flatline!” Rachel cries, removing the nitrous oxide mask as the lines on the monitor flatten out. Slowly, the waves on the EEG grow smaller and less in frequency, until they too, stop and flatline as well. “Brain death. Now it’s real.” [Dove: This line feels so awkward. Like it was just filmed for the trailer or something.]\n\nLabraccio orders Joe to start filming. Steckle wants to defib Nelson and try and bring him back. Labraccio tells him to watch the door. Clearly, the group has divided over the experiment. “Are we in the room with a dead man?” Joe asks. (Having recently been in a room with the body of my grandmother, this one hit hard during this viewing. Ouch.)\n\nRachel starts the countdown. Which, honestly, is far fucking longer than a minute. Movie “time” is always a slippery unit of measurement. Ugh.\n\nJoe begins to film, everything turning grainy black and white, as he zooms in on Nelson’s face. The shot moves closer and closer until everything turns to black and silence.\n\nBAM! An explosion of golden sunlight illuminates a field of yellow flowers, the camera zooming forward over top as though the viewer were flying! The field seems endless as the music becomes upbeat, the viewer feels sucked into the scene, before the camera finally pulls back to reveal a large tree at the edge of a pasture before flying up into the golden sky.\n\n(The first time I watched Flatliners was at the home of my childhood best friend. Her parents were, shall we say, lax about what we were allowed to watch and I finagled my way into getting them to rent the movie. Anyway. They had a two storey living room with a vaulted ceiling and surround sound. The minute this scene kicked in, I nearly fell off the couch, it was so damn loud. I am super sensitive to sudden and/or loud noises, so to this day I will mute the fuck out of this scene until a certain point when I know I can tolerate it again.)\n\nCut back to grainy black and white camcorder footage of Nelson, dead. Rachel announces the 30 second countdown. Labraccio instructs the heating blanket be turned on. It’s go time.\n\nBack to the golden world. Another point in history, perhaps? The camera flies over the tree, revealing a group of figures running through the green field, the tops of the grass blades glowing golden yellow in the bright summer sunlight. The figures are waving silver streamers as they run, a dog bounding along with them. An idyllic childhood tableau.\n\nIn reality, the warming blanket has kicked in and Nelson’s temperature is rising, as Rachel monitors it. Labraccio readies the sodium bicarbonate. (Wait, why are they using an antacid? Huh?) Steckle has sucked it up and joined in, readying the paddles with gel, since Joe is filming the action.\n\nReturning to the three boys and the dog. What more can I say? They’re still waving the damn streamers.\n\nLabraccio pulls down the warming blanket. The defibrillator is charged. Everything is readied. Time to bring Nelson back.\n\nNow back to the dog. I know, I know, this scene is important, but the constant smash cuts back and forth are giving me whiplash. We cut back again to the students, Labraccio rubbing the paddles in preparation.\n\nOkay finally. The flashback – memory – what the fuck ever you wanna call it – focuses on a blond boy in a jeans jacket. Clearly, this is Nelson as a child. Why would he possibly go to this memory? It’s pretty boring.\n\nSteckle notes 93 degrees has been reached. Labraccio moves into position, calls ‘clear!’ and shocks Nelson. The memory changes to darkness, grey skies, the silver streamers waving ominously. The shock has affected things. Nelson is still flatlined. Labraccio orders a charge of 300 jules. Steckle and Joe panic, again. The second defibrillation is administered.\n\nThe memory sweeps up into the darkening sky over a scraggly tree. All is not well. Labraccio begins to administer CPR while Rachel pushes the sodium bicarbonate into the I.V. (You know, I’ve already noted they did not show the injections prior to the flatlining, nor did they show the I.V. being inserted. So why would I remotely believe all that was done? Hm?)\n\nOkay, I googled it. I’m nothing if not terribly curious and being that I’m actually taking the time to layout what the fuck they’re doing, why not get real answers. So, yes, sodium bicarbonate is used in emergency treatment to revive cardiac patients. I learned something.)\n\nRachel “bags” Nelson while Labraccio continues chest compressions. Steckle is having a goddamn meltdown. Joe continues filming. I yawn, bored. [JC: BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT, BAT, YOUR BOY’S LIFE HANGS IN THE BALANCE!] [bat: YEAH YEAH, SHAKE IT OFF, NELSON.]\n\nBACK TO THE IMPORTANT PART. The camera shot gives the viewer the sensation of falling, through multiple branches of the massive tree. Everything is grey and dark, heavy fog draping the branches. The dog barks. There’s this weird windmill of a man sawing logs; I don’t know why that’s in there, but it is. I guess to show it’s windy? Whatever. [Dove: Uh… isn’t there one in Lost Boys as well? Grandpa’s house, before either the big showdown or them circling the house just after Michael has turned? Maybe this is a quirk of Schumacher at the time?] [bat: There’s something similar. They were very popular pieces of yard / folk art once upon a time. It’s a very American thing.]\n\nNelson is still flatlined. Efforts to revive him are not working. And he was so counting on you, Labraccio. Another shock, this time at 350 joules. Nothing. The shock registers on the monitor before the viewer is sucked into the blue flatline.\n\nWe see a young boy, standing alone in a room of concrete pillars. Everything is cast in a blue light/tint that screams “SUPERNATURAL”. We see what appears to be Nelson, though you cannot see his face, walking down a tunnel, the blue light behind him, a staccato sound playing.\n\nSuddenly, the monitor registers. “GOT HIM!” Joe screams. Nelson gasps for air, Rachel scrambles for the oxygen mask. Labraccio pushes epinephrine as Steckle helps get the oxygen mask on Nelson. Everyone goes quiet, staring at Nelson. His eyes begin to blink under the lids. “REM! We’ve got REM!” Labraccio whispers, grinning.\n\nThey have brought Nelson back.\n\nYay.\n\nNow he’s conscious enough to stare up at Rachel, who asks if he can hear them. He just smiles weakly. Everyone is ecstatic. I mean, really, Joe and Steckle were fucking freaking but now everything’s peachy and successful and all’s forgotten. THEY KILLED A MAN AND SUCCESSFULLY BROUGHT HIM BACK FROM THE DEAD! THEY’RE GONNA BE FAMOUS!\n\nThe triumphant music kicks in, a shot of the illuminated Madonna della Strada chapel is shown. Hm, a subtle symbolism of science besting religion? Of man “beating” the Grim Reaper? Joe cheers as the four escort Nelson out of the Taft building, Steckle and Joe supporting him. Rachel and Labraccio lead, getting the back of Labraccio’s truck open. The camera pans up to show the karyatides watching in silence. (God I fucking want to see those in person. Damn it, this movie is so my aesthetic, it hurts.) (ALSO: POINTLESS FORESHADOWING FOR FUN AND PROFIT, AHOY!)\n\nNelson, for his part, just stares at everything around him like he’s seeing it all for the first time.\n\nLabraccio drives the group into the city, the truck passing under the El. Various characters share looks. Rachel reaches over and adjusts the blanket around Nelson. He smiles but she doesn’t reciprocate. They have zero in common and he’s been to death and back, while she hasn’t.\n\nNow parked outside a mini mart, Steckle peppers Nelson with questions. He can’t give specific answers. Rachel asks about the tunnel with the light at the end. Nope. But something is out there, “it’s comforting.” Labraccio starts taking Nelson’s vitals, tells everybody to back off and get him some fluids. [Wing: So before this moment you didn’t think he might need fluids? Smart, you lot. Very smart.]\n\n“Thanks for saving my life,” Nelson calls after them. Dude. “It was so much fun,” Steckle quips.\n\n(Let’s talk about this ‘life saving’, shall we? Because, apparently, I am all in and sitting here 30 years later with Google at my disposal, I looked some shit up. As I mentioned the, uh, ‘resuscitation’ portion of the experiment is pretty open-ended and not deeply discussed beyond a vague outline: bring the participant back to life. Defibrillation’s purpose to is reset the heart’s own natural electrical state created by its pacemaker cells. You’re really not supposed to use it to kill people by stopping their heart. On the flip side, defibrillation is not to be used when a patient is in asystole – the state that the initial shock sent Nelson in to kill him – so shocking him while he is flatlined makes zero fucking sense. Yes, the life saving techniques used – sodium bicarbonate, CPR, and epinephrine – that’s all legit. But the defibrillation is a goddamn lie. At least at this point in the story.\n\nAlso, I learned that, allegedly, Bacon broke one of Sutherland’s ribs during filming. Call me amused. [Wing: If it happened during CPR, it’s not uncommon. You a method actor, Bacon? Really had to put the pressure on?]\n\nStill, post-afterlife adventure, the movie at least portrays Nelson as out of sorts. Not just from what he experienced but from what was physically done to him. From the… three? four? times they defib’d him, he could possibly have skin burns and potentially suffer myocardial necrosis, which would mean he just killed his heart to go explore the afterlife. Quite seriously, the risks and complications majorly outweigh the “knowledge-gathering”. THIS IS WHY IT’S A FUCKIN’ MOVIE.)\n\n“Are you all right, wise one?” Labraccio asks, as he takes Nelson’s blood pressure. Nelson explains he feels like a highly-tuned instrument, clearly hearing the traffic on the lake shore, the hum of the electricity in the street lamps (dude, I hear that all the time and I’ve never flatlined [JC: I’m constantly surprised by people notbeing able to hear the hum of electricity in things. The lightbulb in our bathroom is noisy as fuck, and somehow Boyfriend has no idea what I’m talking about whenever I mention it.] [bat: My family constantly makes fun of my “dog hearing”. If it makes a noise, I WILL HEAR IT.]), and below that he hears a “dragging sound”. Um. Labraccio doesn’t hear that.\n\n“I not only hear it, I can feel it.” Well, that’s fucking ominous sounding.\n\nLabraccio declares his prognosis excellent and Nelson will look great on 60 Minutes. That show is still around, right? No? Yes? [JC: Yup.] Nelson says this is bigger then that and Labraccio agrees that by the time Nelson is through with shilling the fuck out of himself and his new-found knowledge, “it will be”.\n\n“You’re not buying any of this, are you.”\n\n“Hey, you forgot. I’m an atheist.”\n\nCue the skepticism. You knew at least one of the characters had to be agnostic or atheist. From all the religious statuary and the fact there’s a Catholic chapel sitting on campus grounds, to the fact that this is set in Chicago which was once very largely Catholic – irony seeping in that in 1990, 35 parishes were closed – and all the characters are native, it would be easy enough to infer that 4 of 5 are Catholic or lapsed Catholic. Trust me, I know this movie, I know what happens, I remember, and thus evidence will back me up.\n\nLeaving Nelson to chill on the tailgate, Labraccio joins the others in the Asian mini mart. For some reason they all stage whisper while discussing Nelson’s state of health. Labraccio notes he’s talking like Lazarus but otherwise fine. Joe crows that’s exactly what they did, brought Nelson back from death. Labraccio counters that they only got lucky.\n\n“I would like to go next,” Rachel announces in a weird, clinical monotone. Joe wants to go, too. He believes they should all share in the fame and infamy. “That’s not what this is about!” Rachel argues. Labraccio says oh, they’ll be famous, monuments about “this high” will be built to them: “Rest in peace!”\n\nThat’s when Joe and Rachel get into a bidding war on how long they will flatline. It’s as awkward and weird as it sounds. Rachel bids 1:20, Joe 1:30.\n\n“Or are you just so tragically competitive that you would enter into a bidding war with your lives?!” Thanks, Steckle, unlikely voice of reason! [JC: I have determined that he’s the Hufflepuff. If you’re interested, I’ve also pegged Labraccio as the Gryffindor. Joe is another Slytherin, and I have no idea about Rachel, because her characterization barely exists.] [bat: Way back up there when you Sorted Nelson into Slytherin, I Sorted Labraccio as Gryffindor, so agree. Also agree on Steckle and Joe. Rachel, well, let’s say Ravenclaw. She’s probably not smart enough but it seems her non-personality would fit right in.] [JC: At first I thought Labraccio was Ravenclaw, but things happen later on that made me realize, nope, he’s got the brave, do-the-right-thing thing going on. Also, how dare you insult Ravenclaw, home of my girl Luna Lovegood!] [bat: There are always exceptions to the rule and Luna is one of them. Wasn’t Cho Chang a Ravenclaw? Rachel is basically Cho.] [Dove: I’m just pleased that Steckle is in Hufflepuff with me. The site sorted me into Gryffindor, but I know I’m Hufflepuff.] [Wing: I’ve been sorted into both Slytherin and Gryffindor, since we’re talking Harry Potter houses. Also, fuck you, JKR. Fuck you.]\n\nJoe repeats 1:30. Rachel bows out. Joe crows about it. (Joe always crows about everything. Ugh.) Labraccio is disgusted. “Don’t die to be a celebrity.”\n\nLet’s check on Lazarus, er, Nelson! Who is staring up at the street lights like he’s never seen electric lamps before. He chuckles to himself but then we hear a dragging noise, the rattle of a license tag on a collar. Uh oh. Everything dims and the massive, amazing graffiti on the walls glows in the black light. Skulls and demonic faces surround Nelson. This… is bad.\n\nThe dragging sound gets louder. Nelson homes in on it, it’s coming from the alleyway. The camera zooms in on his anguished face. In the alley, a dog appears, crawling, whining pitifully. Its back legs are haphazardly bandaged, clearly injured, leaving the dog unable to walk as it pulls itself along by its front paws. It crawls closer and closer to Nelson, who is illuminated from behind by the same sick blue light seen in his walk through death.\n\n“…Champ?” Nelson quietly inquires, as fog envelops the mangled pup. [JC: Ugh, I hate seeing injured animals. I especially hate this, because the last night of my big dog’s life, she couldn’t move her back legs and was trying so hard to drag herself around like this by her front paws. Poor puppers.] [bat: I’m so sorry, JC. My cousin’s German Shepherd, the last time I saw him, was losing use of his back legs and it was horrible to watch him be so frightened.] [Dove: Any animal in distress is horrible to watch. I kind of look away when Champ’s on the screen.] [Wing: Oh, JC, I’m sorry. When my dad’s previous dog died, she just suddenly couldn’t stand. I had just brought her home from the groomer, and I still have a lot of guilt around it. She was so scared, this tiny little toy poodle.]\n\nThe vision fades, reality returns. The blue light disappears, leaving the alley dim and barely illuminated. Nelson looks around wildly. His classmates have returned. Labraccio wants someone to stay with Nelson. Rachel volunteers. Labraccio asks Nelson if he’s okay. He’s hunched up, sweating, looks rattled. “I’d, uh, like to go home.”\n\nSmash cut to Champ running freely through the field of golden yellow flowers, uninjured. We see the same three boys, running, the silver streamers flapping in the breeze. But now there is a fourth boy, in a red hooded sweatshirt, running at the head of the pack. We see young Nelson screaming at him from behind. Boy in red sweatshirt is fleeing the other three. They chase him towards the trees. Everything becomes muted, grey, suspicious. The boys have cornered the fourth at the base of the biggest tree. The view switches to that of someone falling through the branches. We hear Nelson screaming before we see him, looking a lot worse for wear and in different clothing, waving his arms as he falls through the air. There’s a loud snap sound…\n\n…and Rachel awakens from her slumber, having fallen asleep in a chair in Nelson’s bedroom. In bed, Nelson gasps, awakened from his nightmare. Rachel, ever clinical, informs him he was hyperventilating. She places her fingers against his throat to check his pulse. He stares at her as she rattles away about his blood pressure rising over the next 14 hours and his blood supply increasing. Like, what the fuck, woman. [JC: All I could think was, “so he’s going to have a non-stop boner?”] [bat: Imagine going to the ER over that. “Yeah, I had my friends kill and revive me for an experiment and now I can’t get it to go down.” Flatlining! The original Viagra?]\n\n“God, you’re beautiful.” Nelson whispers. (And, at this point, I would certainly say he was not acting in this scene.)\n\nRachel stares back for a second before telling him to get some rest before moving away from the bed. Nelson grabs her arm, pulling her back. “I bet twenty-four hours ago you didn’t think you’d be spending the night here, did you.”\n\nDude. Dude. Stop.\n\n“You were lucky last night, Nelson. Don’t push it.” Rachel 1, Nelson 0.\n\nMoving over to Joe – who I hate but I honesty need a break from Nelson – we see the cabinet open and stacks upon stacks of mini camcorder tapes are revealed. Each has a name written on it in bold Sharpie. I count 14, but obviously this is just a small slice in the Joe Hurley Home Library: Sex Tapes Edition™. Don’t worry, you don’t need a bucket to puke in at this point. But… keep it handy…\n\nJoe removes a single tape entitled ENGAGEMENT PARTY and inserts it into the VHS player. As obvious as it gets, it’s a recording of the party celebrating Joe’s engagement to Anne. A guy toasts them wealth and happiness, as Joe sits on his bed, grabbing the telephone. He dials and asks to speak with Anne.\n\nAnne eventually answers and is happy to hear from her fiancee. Joe mentions he’s counting down the days to Thanksgiving break (more on that in a minute) and we move to see Anne in her sorority building, talking on the communal phone. Ha ha, remember those days when only the privileged few had personal phones and long-distance calls were costly??\n\nShe complains she needs to transfer to a school closer to Joe’s or get a faster car. (Oh, honey, no.) Joe springs on her that he wonders if they shouldn’t have gotten married over summer break. Anne says her mother wasn’t ready yet. Clearly, this is going to be one of those massive family-driven weddings, ala My Big Fat Greek Wedding, only change it to My Big Fat Irish Catholic Wedding to a Sex Pest.\n\nJoe, if you’ll remember, just jumped at taking a 1:30 walk through death. He gets emotional and starts talking hypothetically. As though something could happen to him. Anne immediately picks up on this and asks what’s wrong. She tells Joe he’s scaring her but Joe is dismissive and brushes off her concern, telling her he loves her and hanging up. Asshole. [Dove: Yeah, that’s not a red flag at all. Anyone who gets that call is going to be like, “Oh, what a nice thing to say!” and just mosey on with their day.]\n\nHe watches more of the engagement party, the camera zooming in on the couple as the crowd chants for them to kiss. Obliging the group, they do, and the screen flips to black.\n\n(Okay, I wanna talk about time. We all know “movie time” is fluid and sometimes it is properly denoted but only on a vague level. Per the tie-in novel, the movie opens in mid-October. On a more minute level, it appears that ~24 hours post-Nelson’s trip, Joe is set for his. Whether or not this is the case, I’m not sure. We’ll revisit this in a little while.)\n\nA small grey dot appears in the center of the screen. It grows larger and larger, brighter as we approach it, as if we are rushing towards it. (This scene reminds me of the David Lynch-directed home pregnancy test commercial but that’s just me tangling things that are visually similar.)\n\nAs the circle gets larger, it takes on a wavy, water-y quality and looks, well, fleshy. Now we’re in water, a woman walking into it, before the camera pans up to show what is apparently a doctor. Yes, as you may have guessed it, Joe is remembering his own birth.\n\nThe image stays grey, as we’re shown an extreme close up of a breast and nipple. Yep, Joe loved breast feeding. Now a woman’s mouth is talking and cooing, making faces as the camera backs away, to show she’s waving a rattle. It’s Joe’s mom.\n\nWe’re shown two older woman in fancy dresses, leaning over and admiring baby Joe, ample cleavage on display. SENSE A THEME?\n\nAdolescent Joe is admiring young girls in summer clothing, now there’s a teen girl in a summer dress that’s straining to cover her shoulders. Female hands wave, as the images become more and more layered. Let’s just sum this up: Joe pretty much everything he finds arousing when looking at women.\n\nSuddenly we see the side of Joe’s face. A hand strokes along his jaw as the image shifts to color. It’s Rachel. Joe is flatlined. We see Joe’s bare chest, upon which are placed the paddles. He is defib’d. Nothing.\n\n“Starting CPR.” Nelson announces, commencing chest compressions as Steckle pushes epinephrine. Nothing is working. Rachel notes the time is now 1:45. Nelson is starting to panic. Labraccio demands Nelson let him try. Huh. So this is the Nelson show and it’s rapidly failing. Rachel yells they’re running out of time. Nelson won’t stand down. Steckle and Rachel vote for Labraccio to take over.\n\nNelson throws a fucking fit, literally slamming his fist repeatedly into the center of Joe’s chest while screaming at the corpse. Yeah, great bedside manner here. Labraccio physically shoves Nelson out of the way, Nelson staring daggers as Labraccio begins chest compressions.\n\nYeah, second experiment is going well.\n\nNelson stalks off as Rachel assists Labraccio. Meanwhile, Joe is moving into more explicit imagery of women he’s enjoyed in his conquest of “figuring things out”. Most of this is scantily-clad bodies and hyper-sexualized imagery/nudity. We eventually see a bunch of women’s faces as the images start speeding past as though Joe is being sucked back into reality.\n\nWith a deep cough, Joe has returned. He doesn’t crash back into the land of the living as hard as Nelson did but this is probably due to the fact that everyone learned how this is supposed to go on Nelson.\n\nNelson, for his part, looks half relieved that Joe is revived. He does not rejoin his classmates, standing off by himself. Steckle is ecstatic as he speaks into the cassette recorder. “CPR successful. Hurley lives!” [JC: . . . yay . . . ?]\n\nRachel and Labraccio share a glance, Rachel actually sort of smiling. Uh oh. Something’s brewing between them. They’ve brought back two men in two (?) nights. Insert shot of Nelson LOOKING DEJECTED. (Dude, stop.)\n\nSmash cut to a(n all night?) diner, the camera slowly snaking its way past tables with the chairs inverted and placed on top. [Dove: This place just looks like a set. It might be a British/USA thing, but I have never seen an eatery laid out like this with so much dead space (yes, I know there could be more tables during busy periods, but why put them away if it’s all-night?). This location/set is so off that it bugs me. Anyone else feel that?] [bat: It’s probably part of the “banquet”, “party” or “large gathering” room some restaurants used to have. Our favorite Chinese restaurant had a MASSIVE room in the middle of the building for this type of thing. So it’s not unusual to me.] [Wing: Dove, remember that we have lots of land here. There are restaurants with tight seating, and Chicago has a bunch, but I’ve also seen restaurants with big, almost empty rooms or lots of space between tables.] The Deathstronaughts are peppering Joe with questions, far more eagerly than the did Nelson. Everyone seems to have forgotten it was difficult to bring Nelson back, but harder to bring back Joe. Hm.\n\nJoe, for his part, is holding court, the absolute center of attention. While it may have been wondrous that Nelson went first, he’s on his slow slide out of the limelight. Let’s watch how badly he reacts to this!\n\nDescribing his trip as “great”, Labraccio is already scoffing and Nelson is already trying to figure how the trips differed. Only Steckle and Rachel are fully invested, fully interested in Joe’s description. And boy, the dude doesn’t have a way with words. “It’s difficult to explain.”\n\nYou just went through some weird long-form pseudo-wet dream, stop trying to make it something it isn’t. (Have I mentioned how much I hate Joe? Just reminding you.)\n\nFor his part, Labraccio is acting like the full armchair atheist he is. He’s literally missing the fedora and keyboard but he’s portrayed by Kevin Bacon so. Joe defends Nelson’s… theory?… well, no, that’s not right, more like religion’s belief/tenant that there is something out there beyond death. Nelson half snarls, “Absolutely.” with a self-righteous tone, while picking up his bottomless cup of coffee as the cigarette burns down between his fingers. Whatever, Sutherland makes it work.\n\nAnd that’s when Joe says his experience was strange, almost “erotic”.\n\n“He’s dead and he gets laid,” Steckle quips into his cassette recorder.\n\nNelson isn’t having this. “What do you mean, erotic?!” Joe backpedals, saying it wasn’t casually, “wantonly” sexual by any means. Uh huh. Steckle cracks jokes, we all know Joe is a goddamn pussy marauder. At this point, Rachel has about had it with the “boys club”, as it were. I don’t blame her. For once we agree on something.\n\nJoe describes that he was being guided by something friendly and feminine. Uh huh.\n\nSteckle takes it further, describing (for lack of a better term) ‘flatlining’ as the conquest of their generation. (About that: you are looking at half a cast of Boomers and the other half is Gen X. Once again, Sutherland was the youngest, while Bacon was born in 1958. The book pegs them all around age 26 – Sutherland and Roberts both turned 22 during filming, Bacon was 31, Platt was 29 (by the by, his character was noted to be 24 in the tie-in novel) and Baldwin was the only one actually 26.)\n\nListing off the sea, America, the West, the moon, the ‘inner’ journey via drugs/LSD, a real dated reference to Shirley MacLaine and her claims of past lives (aka the ‘outer’ journey), and finally, this, aka ‘flatlining’, which is theirs.\n\n“Well, we did have disco,” Labraccio quips.\n\nI would be remiss to not note that during Steckle’s summation of conquests, Labraccio and Rachel share a look that turns into a smile. They share amusement at Steckle’s rambling, though Rachel briefly flicks her gaze at Nelson, who is fuming silently. He’s also looking half incredulously at Steckle, who has co-opted Nelson’s experiment into a group project.\n\nTHIS IS WHY YOU NEVER INVOLVE OTHER PEOPLE, NELSON.\n\n“We have finally found something worthwhile to upstage those fucking Baby Boomers!” Steckle crows as the waitress wanders in, a middle-aged grey-haired woman in a uniform and apron. “Watch your mouths,” she snaps at Steckle.\n\nNelson whips off his glasses and points them at the others. “I found something. Let’s not forget that.” Oh honey, you are already on minute 14 and 58 seconds.\n\n“I came back from the dead tonight,” Joe tells the waitress in a spooky tone. “Doesn’t surprise me, we had Elvis in here last night.” She responds in a no-nonsense way. She’s probably seen it all. Only Rachel and Labraccio have noted Nelson’s jealousy and heard him claiming all the credit. Remember how he failed at bringing Joe back and had to be pushed out of the way? Yeah, we all remember that, Nelson.\n\nRachel asks if Joe had difficulty coming back to life. He says not that he remembers. This sets Labraccio off. Joe can remember everything else but not that? “I think you guys are full of shit,” Labraccio announces.\n\nIt gets a chuckle out of Nelson, who moves the next piece on his private chessboard. He agrees with Labraccio, saying he wouldn’t believe anyone who claimed to have come back from the dead. “Unless I’d been there,” he finishes, staring Labraccio down. “So what about it, Dave?”\n\n“Yeah, you’re an atheist!” Joe chimes in, showing how utterly easily it is to manipulate these people. “I’m going next!” Rachel interrupts, which kind of throws a wrench in Nelson’s manipulation but let’s watch it work out.\n\n“Wait a minute! Nobody is going next!” Labraccio declares, as Nelson takes a drag off his cigarette and just smiles, knowing the battle has begun. Labraccio lectures the others about how there is nothing out there and they only saw what they wanted to see. He tells them to give this up, it’s too dangerous.\n\nNelson starts to argue with Labraccio but Rachel interrupts, saying they can’t turn back, bidding a total time of 1:50. Labraccio calmly replies, “Two minutes.” Steckle calls him out but Labraccio has changed his mind. “Two ten,” Rachel snarks back. “Two twenty,” Labraccio outbids her. Rachel apparently wants to go but not that badly. “Looks like we found a winner,” Nelson, ever the charmer, rubs the loss in her face.\n\nRachel grabs her coat and leaves the diner. “Enjoying yourself, Nelson?” Labraccio snaps, shoving back in his chair, letting it fall over as he takes off after Rachel.\n\nCalmly stubbing his cigarette out, Nelson inquires if Joe had any negative happen during his experience. Joe says nope. Nelson feigns relief. And I do mean feigns. This means seeing his dead dog is not a good thing and Nelson is back at square one in the ‘what the hell is going on?!’ department.\n\nOutside, Labraccio has to jog to catch up to Rachel, who thinks it’s perfectly fine to wander around Chicago alone at night. Yeah, right here, you know this is fiction. (Also, I typically fast-forward or ignore this scene, because there is no eye candy for me.) Rachel is mad at Labraccio, asking if he was “white knighting” or trying to show her up.\n\n“What makes you think everything is all about you?” Labraccio asks, a chuckle in his tone. OH LET’S SEE. YOU STARE AT HER, NELSON STARES AT HER, EVERY TIME SHE POSITS GOING INTO DEATH ONE, A MAN SHUTS HER DOWN. Oh god why am I defending Rachel?! Rachel just seems to think no one wants her to participate. Labraccio counters that there’s constant speculation about her; who she is, why she’s obsessed with death, why she doesn’t date, why she wants to die.\n\n(I was waiting for a place to bring this up and now seems just as good a time as any. What appears to have been a copy of the original first version of the film, entitled “The Flatliners“, showed up on eBay recently. Between the scanned pages and some Googling, I feel confident in saying that this original version was utter bullshit. It was set in Boston – Filardi’s hometown – and the focus was more on Rachel Kinburg. Joe’s characterization was closer to what became Nelson’s, but Rachel was the one who experienced the worst of the aftermath after flatlining. Labraccio was similar to what’s in the final version, and Steckle is mentioned. There are scenes set in a psych ward where Rachel is held. [JC: Ohhh . . . I bet that was just great.] [bat: Just reading the pages very much pissed me off, so I can only imagine how CAPSLOCK RAGE I would have been if it had been filmed. It would certainly not be one of my holiest of holy movies.] Unfortunately, there’s few pages scanned and the internet is sometimes lacking when it comes to movies from 30 years ago. That said, the 2017 remake/reboot put a woman in as the main lead, so clearly someone took notes from the original script. Let me put it this way: Rachel could have been a strong and interesting character, had any other actress portrayed her. But no, we get Roberts, who has ability – see Steel Magnolias – but she comes off as weak-willed and wishy-washy and a strange composite of nothing against the stronger male characters. And this is not me being mean because I don’t like her. Most reviewers complained about it back in 1990, too. It’s hard to imagine Rachel Kinburg, who screams and swears at the nurse to bring her a phone in the psych ward, turning into Rachel Manus, fragile and tragic mother-like figure. Someone fucked up.)\n\nRachel is right to take offense to Labraccio bringing up the thorny subject of her being the center of constant speculation. This is another prime example of how Labraccio is the de facto leader of the group: we saw it when Nelson went to see him and insisted that Labraccio was the one who would bring him back. We’ve seen Labraccio in action, making life and death decisions, shoving Nelson out of the way when Joe wasn’t responding to resuscitation efforts. Whether or not this was because Bacon was 31 or the fact that it’s just how the script was written, I’m not sure. I’d lean towards it being a combo.\n\nSutherland, by proxy of Nelson, is the face and the driving force of the film. But the heart, the “wise elder” and leader of the group is Bacon/Labraccio. Thankfully, blessedly, both actors work so well together, it is enjoyable and comes off believable.\n\nI keep digressing but god this scene is so boring.\n\nLabraccio basically goes on to A) flatter Rachel, B) hit on her, and C) makes it sound like he’s the most knowledgeable and therefore trustworthy of the four males she’s locked into this experiment with. In many ways, yes. Nelson is an egotistical, narcissistic manipulator with as-yet unexplained psychological issues. Joe is a sex fiend who should probably be chemically castrated. [JC: Only chemically? You’re far more generous than I. I would happily go at his bits with a rusty hacksaw] [bat: I was being polite but I would much rather go about it your way, JC.] Steckle is a nerd driven by a desperate need to feel accomplished in life. Labraccio, at minimum, has shown he cares about people and wants to save them, even if it’s from themselves.\n\nHe also explains he views himself as the “control” subject in the experiment. If he flatlines and experiences nothing, then the experiment should end, because that means Nelson and Joe are making it all up. Um, okay, flawed hypothesis but whatever. Rachel gets real animated, yammering on about how people around the world, believers in varying religions/beliefs/philosophies, have all shared similar “near-death” experiences. [JC: Except we’ve seen so far that they haven’t? The garden, the tunnel, Nelson’s field and dogs and other kids, Mr. Joe’s Wild Masturbatory Ride . . . these are not the same things.] Labraccio shrugs it off, chalking it up to chemicals or hormones released when you die. Sure, Dave.\n\nRachel calls him out on this, says he’s reaching. She asks if he goes and finds something out there? “Then you can kill yourself for as long as you want,” Labraccio answers. (POINTLESS FORESHADOWING FOR FUN AND PROFIT, AHOY!) He hits on her by saying he would feel like he’d miss her, if she died, since he hasn’t known her very long.\n\n(Okay, about that. Nelson tells Rachel he has two of the top G.P.A.s in the school lined up for the experiment, indicating that’s Joe and Steckle. What does that say about Rachel? He only courts her because A) lust and B) everyone seems to know she’s obsessed with death but nothing else. And what does that say about Labraccio? He’s made out to be one of the golden, top tier students but that’s all out the window when he’s suspended. Was he a top student in class or just one of those students who you know is “big man on campus”? Hell, what does this say about Nelson?? Is he top tier? Or is it just the impression we’re given because he dares to “think differently”? Oh my god, stop thinking up more questions you will never have answers to! It’s like My Little Pony ‘N Friends has ruined me by never giving answers!)\n\nChanging tracks, Labraccio asks why she’s obsessed with death. Rachel defends herself by saying it’s a personal interest. And that’s that. Labraccio offers to drive her home but she tells him ‘no thanks’ and takes off around the corner of a building. Well, at least he’s been shut down like Nelson.\n\nSMASH CUT to… else where on the mean streets of Chicago at night. A police car goes speeding by, sirens and lights on, as Nelson walks home through the foggy landscape. He pauses, stopping in the middle of the street to light his cigarette, a hissing sound reminiscent of a massive snake filling the air. Looking up sharply, Nelson finds himself surrounded by cyclists out for a midnight ride. [Dove: The CGI has not aged well and HD is unforgiving, there’s an odd white light around the bike tyres.]\n\nIt’s still enough to spook the already on edge Nelson. Pulling his trench coat tighter, he makes his way alone through the rain, shoulders hunched against the wet and cold. [Wing: I don’t think any of them are dressed for Chicago nights in October, but maybe that’s just me and my inability to deal with cold.] Rounding a corner, he takes a short cut through an alley. It is filled with people, mostly homeless, prostitutes [JC: Sex workers is the preferred term, bat!] [bat: Sorry! Was keeping with 90s nomenclature.], dealers and drug addicts gathered around, oil barrel fires lit against the darkness. Some look up at Nelson as he passes by. We hear the ranting and raving of a voice farther down in the alley as Nelson continues to walk slowly, ever mindful that he’s dressed very nicely and would make an easy mark if someone took a mind.\n\nHonestly, this alley seems way too full of people to be realistic, but then again, I have zero experience with alleyways in Chicago.\n\nThe woman who is ranting and raving, saying she didn’t take the money, pauses long enough to become coherent. “Right, Nelson?” she asks, causing him to stare in disbelief. “Because in the end, we all know what we’ve done.”\n\nNelson bolts. Down into the subway.\n\nHe moves from a reddened visual to one filling with the sick blue light. Dude, hello, that’s a cue! Reaching the empty platform, the concrete columns stand as silent sentinels, illuminated in blue light. Champ begins to whine from somewhere in the darkness. Nelson pauses long enough to see a flicker of movement, Champ’s shadow looming on the wall, moving away from him.\n\n(DUDE. RUN.)\n\nStupidly, Nelson runs to where the opposite side of the platform connects, calling for the dog, who we see crawling off into a tunnel. He pauses for a second, just like Luke Skywalker, before plunging into the blue-light of the tunnel.\n\nThe narrow path is familiar but doesn’t trigger memories in Nelson, who’s too busy calling for his long-lost dog. For a second we get a deja vu scene, this time clear and obviously Nelson, watching the broken hind quarters of the dog disappear around a sharp corner at the end of the tunnel.\n\nNelson running into the blue light at the end of the tunnel is irony not lost on me.\n\nThere is movement that flickers in the corner, distracting Nelson to a full stop. He’s found a room filled with concrete pillars, blue light bulbs hanging from the ceiling the only illumination. He continues to call for the dog, winding his way through the pillars, obsessed.\n\nMoving into the next row, the camera reveals a young boy standing between the pillars, alone. Wearing a red hooded sweatshirt.\n\nNelson stares for a long moment before taking a few steps forward, asking what the kid is doing here. He continues to approach, crouching to be nearer to the boy’s height, actual concern in his tone. Nelson asks if the boy is all right, if he’s lost.\n\n(Winces in anticipation; this always hurts.) [JC: Whereas I involuntarily laughed out loud. My reactions to violence are odd sometimes.] [bat: I involuntarily laughed through 90% of 24, so.]\n\nJust when Nelson is at his closest, the boy kicks upward, his foot connecting solidly with Nelson’s crotch. From there out, the boy begins to punch Nelson with unending fury, solidly connecting as Nelson lands on the ground, completely caught off guard and somehow unable to defend himself. The boy pauses long enough for Nelson to look up at him before landing the heaviest blow. Nelson goes down and the boy runs away. A twelve year old boy just beat the living shit out of a grown man. That’s… that’s not normal. Nelson stays down, coughing. Hopefully questioning his life choices.\n\n“Halloween morning.” Steckle deadpans, speaking into his handheld cassette recorder. This is a long soliloquy, the visuals starting out with the sun setting into the haze of pollution that is the city sky, the dome of the Taft building visible. We switch to a creeping pan down a sidewalk, showing the student housing building where Steckle resides, before revealing Steckle himself, laying on the couch with his feet up.\n\nHe goes on, composing his future book, describing that the Deathstronaughts? Deathateers? [JC: My idiot brain read that as “Deatheaters” before I looked closer.] [bat: Well, Nelson and Joe are Slytherins…] One of those. Feel no fear and thus are already dead and feel nothing. Or maybe they live life so well and love life that they’re imagining themselves immortal. (Well, one of you was previously immortal, so.) Steckle says something about “passion for science” and you can tell he’s going to need a hardheaded and heavy-handed editor for this “book”.\n\nIn conclusion: “Or maybe we were just fucked in the head.” I VOTE THAT OPTION!\n\nIt’s a brisk Fall day. Joe jogs to catch up to a petite blonde woman walking down the sidewalk. He greets her and introduces himself. “You’re Teri, right?” OH LOOK, IT’S THE GIRL FROM THE WARD WHO HAD A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE! I WONDER WHAT JOE WANTS FROM HER, BESIDES THE OBVIOUS?\n\nOkay, it’s not the obvious option. He broaches the rumor she had a NDE. “I don’t want to talk about it,” she stammers, heading into a building, as Joe follows.\n\nThe lobby is decorated extensively with huge paper skeletons and plastic blow art pumpkins. OH MAN THIS IS AMAZING, I ALWAYS FORGET. Joe is making his move, telling Teri he, too, has experienced a NDE and he “needs” someone to talk to about it. They move to a seating area and take chairs.\n\nTeri whispers conspiratorially that “they” didn’t believe her. Joe dismisses “them”, as he and Teri were there and experienced it. We see two other young women turn around and stare at Joe knowingly. In the background is a television set, airing a football game.\n\nJoe suggests that if Teri has to go to class, they can meet some night during the week to “discuss” their NDEs. Uh huh. Teri is, how do I say it, oblivious to the unspoken part of Joe’s proposition. She is serious about her NDE; Joe is just trying to use his as leverage into bed.\n\nAs Teri rambles on about her NDE, Joe glances at the TV. Suddenly the football game is replaced with black and white footage from one of Joe’s secret sex tapes. His jaw drops as he stares at it. He can’t tell if he’s really seeing it, if everyone watching the football game can see it. The cheers from the football crowd morph from “Go! Go! Go!” to “Joe! Joe! Joe!” as he watches himself move back, revealing the face of an African-American woman. She looks directly at him and asks, “Why did you do this to me, Joe?”\n\nJoe stares in wide-eyed panic, mouthing ‘oh my god’ at the screen. SMASH CUT to the El roaring overhead as we arch across the space to reveal the downstairs entryway to Nelson’s apartment. (Cue me wincing in advance again. Ugh.)\n\nIn front of the bathroom mirror, a battered and bruised Nelson stands, suturing an open gash around his left eye. It’s gross and it doesn’t help (me) that his eye is red from hemorrhaging and he clearly struggles with pulling the tiny curved needle through his skin as it pulls the loose flaps tight. I mean, clearly it’s fake AF and Nelson isn’t real good at suturing stitches. Still, I would rank this on the list of body horror nightmares. Suturing your own face wounds. Ew.\n\nBecause apparently the apartment has fancy architecture but no closets [JC: There is simply no way to make closets fit in with fancy architecture, no way.], Nelson has a PVC pipe clothing rack full of the same white dress shirt, kept in dry cleaner bags, all at the ready. He removes one and puts it on. Dude looks way worse for wear here. He pauses to touch his sutured face before moving out of the bedroom. His left arm is apparently too bruised/injured to move, as he uses his right hand to pull up the shirt. DID I MENTION EVERYTHING IN THE APARTMENT IS CAST IN A BLUE HUE?\n\nAs he enters the main room, Nelson finally notices something is off. Staring at his front door, which has a piece of pressed glass in it, he hears Champ. Uh oh. Something moves towards the door, a pair of legs. Nelson stares intently. His eyes widen as he realizes it’s the boy from the tunnel. In panic, he bolts, grabbing his coat and disappearing out the backdoor (this apartment is weird) and takes the stairs, practically flying down them.\n\n[Dove: In the above gif, he looks like Stephen Dorff. Not in the actual movie, just the gif.]\n\nExiting the fire door, which immediately locks behind him and also says NO ENTRY on it, Nelson encounters a shadow moving on the wall. He doubles back, swearing, realizing he is trapped. He turns around, yelling, “NO!” but facing his fear(?) and bracing for the worst.\n\nTwo children in costume move into frame. “Trick or treat!” Nelson, sweaty and trembling, leans back hard against the fire door. False alarm. [JC: REALLY, kids? Does this motherfucker look like he has candy on him?!] [bat: *quietly mutters in the background about how he looks like eye candy to me*] [Wing: Why are the trick or treating near the fire door in the first place?]\n\nWEIRD ROCK MUSIC VIDEO MONTAGE TIME!\n\nThe song? Party Town. Performer? Dave Stewart & the Spiritual Cowboys. You would know Dave Stewart as one half of the Eurythmics, the other half being Annie Lennox. This comes from his solo album. Why this movie needed a “song” is anybodies’ guess but here we are.\n\nThe song’s lyrics are dark AF. Although you don’t really hear a lot of them in the short clip. I don’t even want to describe this montage; just watch the music video, also directed Schumacher (I think? Am I wrong?) but beware, MAJOR spoilers because this is a music video for a movie and they don’t seem to care that they’re giving away plot points.\n\nDave Stewart has all the charisma of a wet paper towel in that video. Ugh.\n\nANYWAY, I guess you can sum up the scene in the movie as a huge bonfire alight on the steps of the Taft building (um, no, no way) while college-aged and above students dance around in oversized costumes of varying levels of spooky and/or questionable taste. I remember walking into Halloween stores and seeing a lot of these masks/oversized fake body parts on display. So it’s really kind of a time capsule for me.\n\nThe wind stirs the plastic sheeting inside the Taft building, focusing in on the restoration work of the paintings in the alcoves, before we move to Steckle pulling down a window blind in one of the windows of the Dog Lab. He is uncertain tonight’s experiment is a good idea, it being Halloween and a Full moon. (Most of that is a lie. Some of this was filmed on October 28, or at least that’s what I read online. And the Full moon happened on the 14th of October 1989. Halloween was a 3% Waxing Crescent. [JC: However, in 2020 we get a Halloween blue moon, so that’s gonna be pretty cool.] [Wing: In 82 days! Not that I’m counting.]) Steckle has clearly fallen into the “all fucked in the head” summation he made earlier.\n\nI would hesitate to disagree with him, honestly.\n\nLabraccio sits on the gurney, applying the electrodes.
