        "text": "The cult classic film Cruel Intentions, which turned 25 this week, was part of an era of noir thrillers that always seemed to pair bad behavior with great interiors. In that film, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon, and company scheme from within the castle-like homes of their rich parents. Other ’90s flicks place their calculating characters inside modern homes with sleek elements, which can come off a bit cold, but exude a certain sophistication onscreen that’s enticing and sexy. Stylish subtext and pristine living quarters mirror the inner decorum of flawed characters and their worlds filled with intrigue, seduction, and suspense. Perhaps this is the positive side of their more unsavory traits: Being a highly meticulous person would likely make you a tasteful collector with sharp attention to detail; narcissism could manifest in competitive individuals showcasing their wealth through objects. Here, we dive into five films featuring some of the most toxic characters and the best design moments.\n\nSleeping with The Enemy (1991)\n\nBehind the façade of a perfect and stunningly modern beach house on Cape Cod is the shadow of an unhappy marriage in this film directed by Joseph Ruben. Patrick Bergin plays Martin, the abusive husband of Laura Burney (Julia Roberts), whose wretched obsession and jealousy grow into something darker and more unforgiving than the black lacquer floor Laura falls on after he physically strikes her. The scene where she’s scolded about the bath towels being faultily hung is enough to scream “run away,” which she does, though Martin, as slick as his silky sheets, stalks her to Iowa. Why can’t the man just stay home and enjoy what he has?\n\nDamage (1992)\n\nThis salacious story directed by Louis Malle centers around a British politician, Dr. Stephen Fleming (played by Jeremy Irons), who embarks on a dangerous affair with his son’s young French fiancée, Anna (Juliette Binoche). Anna is an art collector with a hidden past and a woman of very few words. Stephen begins to visit the mysterious and alluring Anna in her apartment, where she’s often found alone in her cryptic and moody chamber of old artifacts, impressively bound books, and dark wood surfaces that contrast the rosy, picturesque English garden of Stephen’s family life in the public eye—that is until he becomes trapped inside her walls.\n\nSliver (1993)\n\nBased on a novel by Ira Levin, this crime-thriller-slash-murder-mystery directed by Phillip Noyce follows a divorced book editor who moves into a glossy Manhattan apartment, nicknamed the Horror High Rise due to a series of random deaths. Carly (Sharon Stone) starts a dalliance with a neighbor; but, unbeknownst to her, someone in the building has been spying on tenants through every frosted glass mirror and Japanese-tiled bathtub. Meanwhile, she falls into the seductive lure of voyeurism herself and enjoys watching her neighbors through a brass-and-mahogany midcentury telescope. Voyeurs probably have the best taste because they have a good eye for everything, right?\n\nCruel Intentions (1999)\n\nSebastian (Ryan Phillippe) is as charming as his family’s stately New York mansion and as vain as the grandeur of its Italian baroque decor. The film, directed by Roger Kumble, starts in an upholstered therapist’s chair. It then moves to an antique chaise longue, where a devious wager between Sebastian and his stepsister unfolds. With the parents absent, the teens slip into roles reminiscent of playing “house,” as their ornate surroundings echo intricate power dynamics at play. They sleep in bedrooms full of heirlooms that seem much too mature for their years, and the opulence is a captivating distraction from their manipulative schemes.\n\nAmerican Psycho (2000)\n\nPatrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a Wall Street professional and certified psychopath in this film directed by Mary Harron. His minimalist apartment on 81st Street in New York City lacks adornment except for a Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Barcelona chair, a telescope, and a Harman Kardon stereo system. His living room follows a monochromatic theme, with a white couch and stark walls complemented by black accents throughout, and his kitchen is outfitted in sterile-looking stainless steel. Such an arrangement reflects the dichotomy of his extreme worldview where things and people are either flawless or utterly flawed. His desire to “fit in” with the rest of the world is as ostensive as his carefully placed furniture—or the contorted corporate figures framed on his wall. (The series of charcoal drawings titled Men in the Cities by artist Robert Longo questions themes like power, masculinity, and social unrest.) However deranged the man ends up being, you’ve got to admit his layout is pretty chic."
