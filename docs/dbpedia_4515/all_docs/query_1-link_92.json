        "text": "Crime is about as fluid a category as you can get, which means trying to make a list of the best crime movies even harder to pin to the wall. There are crime dramas, crime thrillers and crime comedies. There’s crime on film that feels so visceral that all you can do is just sit and wait for the screen to go black as you try and shake it off, and crime that’s so out of this world all you can do is support the bad guys for the sheer audacity of it all.\n\nThe first ever Hollywood film in 1910, In Old California, revolves in part around crime, and in the more than 100 years since it's a topic that’s barely shied away from our big and small screens. All this to say, it’s very hard to make a definitive list that isn’t the size of Vito Corleone’s rap sheet. Still, we have whittled down a short list that sits somewhere in the upper echelons of the genre, but if you disagree please don’t take any artistic inspiration from any of the films mentioned.\n\nHere are 12 of GQ’s best crime movies.\n\n12. Catch Me If You Can (2002)\n\nProbably one of the best examples on the screen of the old saying “f**k around and find out”. In Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can, Leonardo DiCaprio takes on somewhat the true story of Frank Abignale Jr., a forger who conned his way into being a pilot, surgeon and lawyer while on the run from the FBI. A solid argument could be made for this being the truly deserving DiCaprio Academy Award-winning role, as he meticulously balances the gall and anxiety of the barely-21-year-old lead character. Boosted by supporting roles from Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken and a very young Amy Adams, Catch Me If You Can has all of the pleasing sheen of the Spielberg oeuvre with a kind of white-collar adrenaline that makes it an ageless classic.\n\n11. In Bruges (2008)\n\nIt’s hard to picture now off the back of the career-high and Awards season wholesomeness of The Banshees of Inisherin, but there was a time in the latter half of the 00s when Colin Farrell might have just been another hunky star spat out by the Hollywood machine. At the tail-end of a downward spiral, along came Martin McDonagh and Brendan Gleeson for the first time with this tense and hilarious two-hander about hitmen dumped in Bruges with their only mission to just lay low. The mundanity of wasting the days away in the melancholy beauty of the city and the reluctant domesticity of Farrell and Gleeson somehow feels like a powder keg waiting to explode.\n\n10. Drive (2011)\n\nIn Drive, Ryan Gosling, well, drives. That’s kind of his thing. He’s a man for hire, flitting between working as a stunt driver and a getaway driver and why he does either of these things is a mystery that’s never answered. Taking inspiration from Hollywood noir films and Western archetypes where protagonists may have some interiority but its never handed on a plate, Drive could fall flat if not for Gosling’s presence as an unpredictable enigma and supporting roles from the likes of Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston and Oscar Isaac. It’s a film that’s both full and devoid of substance, as Gosling’s permanently unnamed driver is embroiled in a small, messy criminal hustle that feels like being dropped mid-way into a GTA level, which is kind of the point.\n\n9. 21 Jump Street (2012)\n\nLook, we said that crime films come in all shapes and sizes and it’s impossible to ignore the wealth of the crime comedy caper. Occupying part of that apex is 21 Jump Street, a film that has literally no business being as funny as it is considering it's based on a mid-tier sitcom from the 80s. The film stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum who take on the show’s original premise of young-looking cops tasked with going undercover at a high school to break up a drug operation. The duo are a classic oddball pairing of jock and nerd, but the plot flips it on its head. Hill is, obviously, very funny, but the star is Tatum in the loveable himbo role he was born to play. The film isn’t inventing anything new, but its knowledge of the fact it's basically treading 20-year-old ground to hit that nostalgia dopamine buzzer is what makes it great.\n\n8. Good Time (2017)\n\nYou’ll need a masseuse, acupuncturist and spiritual meditation coach on speed dial after watching Good Time just to unclench every knot of tension accumulated over its 101-minute run. Still, it’s a Safdie Brothers film, so it was always going to tread that narrow line of being unbelievably stressful while also being, pun intended, a very good time. Robert Pattinson (doing a fantastic job of being somehow genuinely unattractive) plays Connie, a bank robber attempting to free his cognitively impaired brother from the system who, through a series of scream-inducing terrible decisions, ends up landing them both on the run from the law. The film is a visceral feast of grit, grime, neon lights and the underbelly of New York. It feels like your eyes are being pried open and forced to witness the reality of city sleaze that is easy to remain consciously ignorant of.\n\n7. The Fast and the Furious (2001)\n\nThe fact that the cultural legacy of the Fast and Furious franchise is now basically just another comic book-style universe of superheroes and supervillains that exists somewhere between Transformers and the Avengers is really funny when you consider its origins way back in 2001 as a small, seemingly one-off action crime film. Set against the backdrop of inner-city drag racing, Paul Walker stars as an LAPD detective tasked with going undercover to corner the gang leader who souped up some Honda Civics for a heist, which is hilariously quaint considering the last film took cars into literal space. Walker’s Brian starts an unlikely friendship with Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto that could have (and was intended to) begin and end with this standalone caper. Of course, the rest is history.\n\n6. Ocean’s Eleven (2001)\n\nHeist movies simply don’t get better than Ocean’s Eleven. It’s a film that feels like a chemical formula where, if even one thing was different, it would end up in some kind of mushroom cloud of disaster (and yes, we are taking into account Don Cheadle’s terrible Cockney accent but somehow it still works). George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a notorious thief who brings together an all-star crew to rob Andy Garcia’s Las Vegas casino on the biggest night of the year. Its supporting cast is as A-list as it comes (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts etc), and as a remake of a 1960s classic, it takes all the glitz and glamour of that golden age of Hollywood into the 2000s. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, its central heist never stops feeling like it's just about to fall apart even if you know it triumphantly won’t.\n\n5. The Departed (2005)\n\nMartin Scorsese’s mob remake of the classic 2001 Hong Kong crime epic Infernal Affairs put him back on track and in the trenches of the crime underworld where some of his best work had been done. He ropes together an inspired cast of A-listers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg who, despite operating at the upper echelons of Hollywood, always felt like they shouldn’t be in the same circles. It’s that constant sense of underlying off-ness that makes The Departed as tense and unnerving as it is as we follow the twisted world of Boston gangsters moonlighting as cops and vice versa. The film is an opera, a story of trust and betrayal set against some ‘wicked smaht’ dialogue that gives it all the grit of the 70s movies Scorsese cut his teeth in.\n\n4. The Usual Suspects (1995)\n\nThere are a few genuine twists in films that make your brain feel like it’s imploded in your skull and leave you talking for weeks or, in the case of The Usual Suspects, decades. By now, even if you haven’t seen the film, you’ll know its twist, just like The Sixth Sense or Shutter Island. But even with that final act moment of shock dampened, it’s still a wildly enjoyable neo-noir crime film. Following the threads of a boat massacre that saw all but two low-level criminals get iced, we work backwards as part of a police interrogation on who the criminal mastermind behind the takedown was. We’ll leave it there because any more detail would really spoil the whole thing. There are few things in life as thrilling as a good old-fashioned twist, the reminder that there’s still scope to be shocked even if it feels like we’ve seen it all.\n\n3. Se7en (1995)\n\nEverything about David Fincher’s Se7en is ugly. Its unnamed city, its criminals, its crimes, its outlook on life. The weather is unrelentingly bleak in this film, and the claustrophobic atmosphere in the city is made more oppressive and suffocating by the murders at its core. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play cops on the trail of a killer making examples of the seven deadly sins, with each murder more viscerally gut-churning than the last. The 90s were filled with high-concept crime thrillers, with crimes taking inspo from old novels or serial killers operating on some kind of higher plane of genius than the rest of us mere normals. Se7en is that in essence, but it’s also mundane in its horror. Our protagonists and our killer are worn down to exasperation and any potential sheen of a ‘gotcha’ moment is tarnished on impact. Se7en is, simply put, just very grim.\n\n2. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\nPeople often talk of cultural shifts but, in reality, there have been very few of genuine merit. But Pulp Fiction is absolutely one of them. Quentin Tarantino’s Molotov cocktail of excess is a crime bacchanalia, interweaving multiple stories of criminal happenings in non-chronological order, including the likes of John Travolta (in a career reignition) and Samuel L Jackson’s (in a superstar introduction) hitmen, Uma Thurman’s iconic black-bobbed femme fatale and Bruce Willis’s doomed boxer. Only his second feature film after Reservoir Dogs, it, for better or worse, made gave Miramax its 90s boom and made Tarantino the coolest director in town and cemented a style of filmmaking that has been imitated to death but never once bested. Tarantino’s now-infamous style of scattershot ideas and visual overstimulation is never more refined and at home in Pulp Fiction. It’s the perfect example of unshackled freneticism at its finest.\n\n1. The Godfather (1972)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola’s 1972 magnum opus The Godfather gave us mobsters by way of Shakespeare. It’s an epic tale of the intricate familial webs at the heart of organised crime, making dramatic turns of betrayal and old-fashioned ideals of piety and reverence for elders. It’s that juxtaposition of traditional values intermixed with intense scenes of violence as the old guard of the mob comes to heads with a new era of the drug trade underworld that has made The Godfather not only the best crime film in history but arguably the greatest film ever made. Marlon Brando’s Vito Corleone is, of course, a career-canonising performance, but supporting roles from Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano and Diane Keaton pad out its impact more than the cottonwool sitting in Brando’s cheeks for the whole shoot. There’s a majesty to the hierarchy of the mob world created by Coppola and Mario Puzo, who wrote the original book, that gives a kind of historical opulence to its brutality."
