        "text": "Positive Messages\n\na little\n\nFew positive messages, mostly conveyed by negative example, about the dangers of temptation and making choices that appease your vanity. Possibly the only thing standing in the way of the devil is that man has free will. The devil will always be around, trying to tempt you into succumbing to him.\n\nPositive Role Models\n\na little\n\nKevin's vanity slowly allows him to give in to the temptations of wealth, to neglect his wife, and to go against his conscience by defending criminals he knows are guilty. Eventually he's able to overcome it all but at a great and violent cost. And when he's given a second chance, it's clear that temptation is waiting at every turn. Milton is evil in every way, manipulating people and events for his own ends, but he's dangerously charismatic. Wife Mary Ann is loving and supportive, but her efforts to resist temptation drive her to madness.\n\nViolence & Scariness\n\na lot\n\nLots of blood and some gore. Some of the violence, including mention of rape, is deliberately not clear as to whether it's real or imagined. Two suicides graphically depicted: One shows stabbing and slitting the throat with blood; the other shows a gunshot to the head with slow-motion falling and close-ups of blood and gore. Very bloody photographs of murder victims shown in investigation context. A toddler holds up a gory, bloody internal organ, possibly in a dream or vision. A beating with a stick is shown with the dead victim's bloody face afterward. A full- frontal nude woman's body with many bloody cuts is shown. Realistic police-operation footage shows a raid on a ritual animal slaughtering with brief, quick-cut images of throat slitting and bleeding. A cow's tongue on butcher paper is manipulated in a ritual. Faces of minor characters briefly morph into grotesque monsters. A gun is shown and used a couple of times. A court case shows a teen testifying about being molested by a teacher. A pedestrian is run over by a car, thrown violently, and the bloody face and body are shown. A scared woman brandishes a knife in the darkness.\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Violence & Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nParents need to know that The Devil's Advocate has graphic violence and sex; frequent profanity that dehumanizes, especially sexually; and themes including child molestation, murder, incest, and the depths you'll descend to when you give in to temptation. It's not for kids. The violence is graphic, gory, and bloody and tied to sex in a court case involving child molestation. There also are discussions about consenting to sex but then wanting it to stop, and a fully naked woman is shown from the front with bloody cuts all over her body. Another instance of full-frontal female nudity is sexual; several scenes of simulated sex show topless women; and nude male buttocks are shown. There is drinking, smoking, and drugs. Ultimately there's a moral in there about the evils of giving in to temptation, but a plot twist weakens the message. Viewers may be left with conflicting feelings of titillation and revulsion, so they should be old enough to handle those effectively.
