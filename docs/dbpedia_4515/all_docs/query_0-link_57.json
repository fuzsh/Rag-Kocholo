        "text": "These are thoughts on movies I’ve seen so far this year. I’ve decided to sort it by decade, to see ten films in each category by the end of the year. I’m counting pre-1929 as the silent era and 2023 and 2024 as separate from the 2020s, just because I’ll see so many movies from last year and this year, and I do want to stay on top of current cinema.\n\nMovie #61/ New Movie #43/ 2024 Film #19: The Young Woman and the Sea (Movie-Theater)\n\nMy mom was a champion swimmer in her youth, and likes historical dramas, so she was primed to like this movie. And it immediately became a favorite of hers. It’s a charming tale of a woman showing she could compete with the men, and perform a task that few had been able to accomplish, swimming across the English channel. The film gets across why it’s difficult, why she could pull it off, and the varied reactions, from the people inspired to those threatened to loved ones terrified of what can happen. It may have some traditional elements of the true-life inspirational sports movies but it’s a good example of the form.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #62/ New Movie #44/ 2024 Film #20: Inside Out 2 (Movie-Theater)\n\nOf the Pixar sequels, it’s the most derivative, with the storyline repeating a lot of beats from the original (Joy has to realize that other emotions are important for Riley, Riley goes through an emotional outburst that threatens her relationship with people she loves) but I like the details and it builds on the metaphor rather well.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #63/ New Movie #45/ 2024 Film #21: Bad Boys: Ride or Die (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt’s a fun buddy action movie elevated by the camaraderie between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as well as two other members of the family- deadpan son in law Reggie, and a deceased captain sending messages from the grave.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #64/ 1930s Film #4: Freaks (Criterion DVD)\n\nThe depiction of the freaks is marketed as a curiosity, but the film shows their humanity. The acting is wildly inconsistent, but you’ll see things in the film that you can’t see elsewhere, even if it’s the artistry of how people born a particular way make a living. There is an element of outsider cinema filtered through Pre-Code Horror.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #65/ New Movie #46/ 2024 Film #22: Kinds of Kindness (Movie-Theater)\n\nI watched this with some friends who did not know what they were getting into. It is aggressively weird and the three stories get more messed up, which is impressive because it starts with someone poisoning his wife so that she would miscarry.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #66/ New Movie #47/ Early 2020s Film #3: X (DVD)\n\nThe story about ambitious people trying to make a soft-core porn, and the internal disagreements, is more compelling than the horror elements that follow.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #67/ 1930s Film #5: The Lady Vanishes (HBO Max)\n\nThis is A-Minus Hitchcock, where it’s made by a master but it’s one of his fun minor works, something that’s rewatchable and enjoyable. There’s something to be said for directors like Hitchcock and Ford who make good A-Minus pictures.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #68/ New Movie #48/ 2024 Film #23: Horizon Chapter One (Movie-Theater)\n\nThe film is beautifully shot, and there is a strong message of how people allow hard times to harden them, but this is so unfinished I don’t get how they thought it would make money. Filmgoers are looking for some other kind of structure.\n\nIt is worth seeing on the big screen.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #69/ New Movie #49/ 1940s Film #2: The Small Back Room (Movie-Theater)\n\nThe first Powell & Presburger films I saw were Stairway to Heaven/ A Matter of Life and Death and The Life & Times of Colonel Blimp, so I thought they had a Frank Capra vibe. But that’s not quite true. This story has some Billy Wilder vibes.\n\nI can see why it flopped close to the end after the war, at a time when England was victorious but still rationing. It’s an excellent character study, focusing on a miserable military R&D guy, unhappy in his relationship (more his problems feeling inadequate) and the bureacrats in charge. The investigation into unusual explosives is on the backburner, but it leads to an intense and satisfying climax.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #70/ New Movie #50/ 1960s Film #3: Targets (Criterion DVD)\n\nI get the sense that Peter Bogdanovich was getting the kinks out of filmmaking in the story of a writer/ director’s (played by Peter) arguments a washed up actor (Boris Karloff playing Byron) intersecting with a shooting spree. His debut is unpolished, but bold, dealing with situations so new there isn’t the cinematic language for it yet.\n\n710\n\nMovie #71/ New Movie #51/ 2020s Film #4: Pearl (DVD)\n\nPearl is a messed up story of a young woman’s breakdown, inspired by the likes of Wizard of Oz and Carrie, but it goes in its own direction. It also makes “X” retroactively better because of how it fits the depiction of Mia Goth’s Pearl in that film and the realization of just how terrible life had to have been for a minor character.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #72/ New Movie #52/ 1970s Film #8: Count Yorga, Vampire (Arrow DVD)\n\nIt’s a very low budget horror movie that started as a softcore porn until a decent actor said he would play the vampire in a standard film. Robert Quarry is solid as a creepy European outsider worming his way into a family after a tragedy. The jump scares are decent. There’s a bit of a Night of the Living Dead vibe in the combination of modern setting and classic monster aesthetics.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #73/ New Movie #53/ 1970s Film #9: Lisztomania (DVD)\n\nIt’s a fun reimagination of an 1840s composer living like a rock star, a contrast from the typical biopic. Seems to be an influence on Amadeus, Hamilton and a particular sequence in The Big Lebowski.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #74/ 1930s Film #6: Swing Time (Criterion DVD)\n\nIt might just be the best dancing captured on film. The story’s lightweight with Fred Astaire accidentally seducing Ginger Rogers, but the sequences and songs are amazing.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #75/ 1930s Film #7: Bringing Up Baby (Criterion DVD)\n\nI think the movie is blamed too much for every mediocre copy. It is the definitive screwball comedy. You can’t improve on Howards Hawks, Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn or the leopard.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #76/ Silent Movie #1: Intolerance: Love’s Story Through the Ages (Blu Ray)\n\nNarratively, this is very much ahead of its time with the intersection of four narratives from different eras on a common theme. The narratives are powerful, with some of the best depictions of the Christ story on film, strong fantasy sequences with the fall of Babylon, a decent account of the murder of the Huguenots and a modern narrative of a young couple facing busybodies. I’m curious if the settings are based on Griffith’s interest or if this was just what audiences of the time would have found compelling and familiar.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #77/ New Movie #54/ 2000s Movie #3: The Fast and the Furious (Blu-Ray)\n\nThis series is one of my rare cinematic blind spots in that it’s really popular, there’s a lot of of them and I haven’t seen any. It’s an okay action film, a bit of its time (the tech got dated) but with some impressive set pieces and a solid sense of camaraderie.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #78/ 1930s Movie #8: It Happened One Night (Criterion Blu Ray)\n\nThe most iconic romantic comedy just remains so much fun. No one’s been better than Gable and Colbert at the old trope of mismatched boy and girl falling in love despite one another. And it’s got something to say about the American spirit during the Great Depression and someone’s need for independence.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #79/ 1940s Film #3: To Be or Not to Be (DVD)\n\nI just love this movie. Part of it is seeing Jack Benny in something good, and the role of a vain actor jealous of his wife and the attention she’s getting from a pilot fits his stage persona well. It’s a very funny film about standing up to fascism.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #80/ New Movie #55/ 2024 Film #24: Longlegs (Movie-Theater)\n\nPromotional campaign aside, this is a creepy film. The sense of dread is palpable. Some of the plot points are obvious and some are surprising. The internal logic seems off, as characters make decisions that don’t make sense to the extent that I was wondering if was setting up different twists. There are some mysteries about the lead that make it hard to figure out if various decisions are justified; later it turns out, they’re not. The small roles are well cast. I especially like how the relationship with the mother develops\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #81/ New Movie #56/ 2024 Film #25: A Quiet Place Day One (Movie-Theater)\n\nI’m not sure I’d recommend, but the ending and the lead’s journey getting there is compelling. And it may be worth checking out because it’s going to be a spoiler.\n\nStill, if you have a choice to see this and Late Night With the Devil, the latter is a better satanic cult movie. There’s a good sense of atmosphere, but not so much of anything close to reality.\n\n6/10\n\nMovie #82/ 1950s Movies #1: The Searchers (Movie-Theater)\n\nI watched the 70 MM restoration at the Museum of the Moving Image, and it was gorgeous. The film is stunning in how it uses the scale of the west in contrast with John Wayne and his group.\n\nIt’s very old-fashioned and feels like an episode of Star Trek (Jeffrey Hunter is the original Captain Pike) with obvious music, mannered acting, and sitcom style supporting characters but it works. Part of it may be the contrast between typical Western hokum with Wayne’s intensity, and the maturity of the mission- these are men devoting years of their lives to rescuing a girl and then there’s the conflict about whether Ethan Edwards thinks his niece has been turned by the Cherokee into one of their own. Now that I’ve kept track of when the films I watch came out, I’m surprised that this is the only one I’ve seen this year from the 50s.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #83/ New Movie #57/ 2024 Film #25: Bad Newz(Movie-Theater)\n\nMy best friend’s family came from India, and he talks about how culturally conservative it is, even in the media environment, so I was intrigued at how it would handle a story of a young woman pregnant with twins as the result of one night stands with two different men.\n\nI don’t have much familiarity with Indian films. The musical sequences work in the context of a story the female lead tells an actress, although that suggests a moment when the scandal becomes public that occurs off-camera. The following statement may apply to many Indian films, but it feels like something from the golden age of Hollywood, with slightly different cultural norms and a female lead who wants to accomplish something in her 20s that people typically get in their 40s.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #84/ New Movie #58/ 2024 Film #26: Twisters (Movie-Theater)\n\nGlen Powell definitely has star power, while Daisy Edgar-Jones is a solid lead, in a conflict that seems more based on romantic comedies than is typical of the disaster movie genre. There is a good sense of place from director Lee Issac Chung.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #85/ New Movie #59/ 2024 Film #27: Maxxxine (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt works as its own thing (a pastiche of video nasties) and as the conclusion of an interestingly structured horror trilogy about two very similar women, and their ambitions for celebrity. Maxxxine is something rare in horror, where it’s not just about the monster but whether the final girl is more dangerous.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #86/ 1940s Movie #4: Casablanca (Ultra 4K HD Blu Ray)\n\nI don’t think anyone needs me to tell them that this movie is very good. It’s an incredible love triangle that pits the audience surrogate against a world-historic hero. It has an amazing sense of place with a conflict in neutral Morocco. It is about something in addition to the love story.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #87/ New Movie #60/ 2010s Movie #8: War For the Planet of the Apes (Ultra 4K HD Blu Ray)\n\nIt’s an excellent conclusion to the Caesar saga (legitimately one of the great movie heroes of the 21st Century), with Andy Serkis potentially giving his best performance and Woody Harrelson impressive as a crazed military leader who may be right. Some of the sequences are truly impressive.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #88/ 2000s Movie #4: Team America World Police (Ultra 4K HD Blu Ray)\n\nThis kitchen sink comedy is so fun, a parody of things I get (2000s action movies, Post 9/11 politics) with some references I don’t (the whole Thunderbirds vibe.) The combo makes it fresh. Watching it again, the sets are amazing. And there are so many different types of great gags.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #89/ 1990s Movie #4: Heart of a Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Odyssey (Blu Ray)\n\nBehind the scenes at possibly the most chaotic set of a truly great movie. Surprisingly intimate given all the famous people. Worthwhile to get some insight into a classic, and the portrayal of a flawed genius.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #90/ New Movie #61/ 2024 Movie #28: Deadpool & Wolverine (Movie-Theater)\n\nThe crossover is ultimately a love letter to the Fox movie adaptations. It is very Meta in an Airplane/ Mel Brooks way, which is a bit odd since it’s part of the world it’s mocking. Wolverine’s a great straight man for Deadpool and Emma Corrin’s Cassandra Nova is decent as an apocalyptic menace. There is a sense that some of the other characters are middle-aged actors playing action figures, like Toy Story versions of who they’re supposed to be.\n\n8/10\n\nThese are thoughts on movies I’ve seen so far this year. I’ve decided to sort the films mostly by decade, to see ten films in each category by the end of the year. I’m counting pre-1929 as the silent era and 2023 and 2024 as separate from the 2020s, just because I’ll see so many movies from last year and this year, and I do want to stay on top of current cinema.\n\nMovie #31/ New Movie #21/ 2024 Film #7: Late Night With the Devil (Movie-Theater)\n\nThe gimmick mostly works, with what appears to be a Halloween themed episode of a Johnny Carson rival going a bit Ghostwatch (and then more messed up). There’s a good sense of world-building and they play around with expectations of what’s real and what’s going on in people’s head rather well, even if it can contradict the reality of the program.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #32/ New Movie #22/ 2024 Film #8: Immaculate (Movie-Theater)\n\nI’m not sure I’d recommend, but the ending and the lead’s journey getting there is compelling. And it may be worth checking out because it’s going to be a spoiler.\n\nStill, if you have a choice to see this and Late Night With the Devil, the latter is a better satanic cult movie. There’s a good sense of atmosphere, but not so much of anything close to reality.\n\n6/10\n\nMovie #33/ 1970s Films #6: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (HBO Max)\n\nIs this best movie where the lead doesn’t show up for the first 40 minutes? And it’s good until then, but Gene Wilder is magic.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #34/ New Movie #23/ 2024 Film #9: The Land of Saints and Sinners (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis story of a hitman retiring, and getting into a fight with IRA types is a bit like an Irish Unforgiven. The morals are a bit distracting, since the characters seem to suggest the worst thing about being a hitman is wasting your life rather than hurting others. But it is sensible that the characters would feel this way. The Irish atmosphere is stunning and worth seeing on the big screen. The cast is decent.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #35/ New Movie #24/ 2010s Film #5: The Intern (HBO Max)\n\nThis was a pleasant low-stakes film about reasonable people getting used to an unusual situation. De Niro is likable as a likable elderly widower getting involved as an intern. Hathaway might be flighty as a young CEO, although frankly business articles show that’s not unrealistic. Obviously every movie can’t have responsible people who have conflict reasonably, but it’s fine every now and then. The movie also has some fun on both sides with the generation gap, and some good laugh out loud scenes.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #36/ New Movie #25/ 2024 Film #10: Monkey Man (Movie-Theater)\n\nThe cinematography and India setting elevate this revenge film. Structurally there are some weird choices that make it hard to appreciate the characters or the reality of the film, like a major politician showing up in a high-end brothel on victory night (it would make sense for a generic MP, but not for a Modi stand-in) or a sequence where he prepares for Round 2 of a fight, and it’s not clear how much better he is that time around.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #37 New Movie #26/ Early 2020s Film #2: Class Action Park (HBO Max)\n\nSolid documentary with crazy stories about an infamous amusement park run by a real character whose incompetence got some people killed. I was old enough to maybe have gone here during the tail end, but I’m glad my parents never considered it.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #38/ 2010s Films #6: Fences (PBS)\n\nIt is so well-written and so well-acted, especially with Washington and Davis. Washington depicts a complex and deeply flawed blue collar man, but Davis might just give one of the all-time great performances as a housewife is so obviously the better half pushed into a new challenge,\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #39/ New Movie #27/ 1980s Film #2: Friday the 13th- The Final Chapter (HBO Max)\n\nIf I saw this at twelve, it would be one of my favorite movies. There’s boobies and a kid who wants to make movie special effects. The slasher stuff isn’t effective, but it does nail the ending.\n\nWatching it I thought it would make sense to do some kind of David Gordon Greene style Halloween sequel with the survivors, but a quick look at Wikipedia shows that they’ve made a few and it was all terrible.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #40/ 2000s Film #2: Spider-Man 2 (Movie-Theater)\n\nI caught it in theaters for the first time since 2004 as part of the Spider-Mondays program. As a big superhero fan, I don’t think there’s a film better at capturing the costs of a secret identity. Plus, I could see my apartment building in the background of one shot ten minutes in, so that’s great.\n\nI did also appreciate Raimi’s skill at establishing suspense. And that’s different from most superhero movies which are more about adventure.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #41/ New Movie #28/ 1960s Film #2: Kes (Movie-Theater)\n\nBeautiful and devastating tale of a lower class kid in Yorkshire finding meaning as a falconer. It just feels real, and demonstrates how film can be used as an empathy machine, showing us what it’s like in a different environment, although much of it remains universal.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #42/ New Movie #29/ 2024 Film #11: The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt seems pretty obvious that Guy Richie really likes Inglourious Basterds. It’s a fun enough copycat with a solid enough team, good quips, and a challenge that feels meaningful to the war.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #43/ New Movie #30/ 1980s Film #3: The Abyss (Ultra 4K HD Blu Ray)\n\nI watched the special edition on 4K and it was pretty decent. It’s more obviously Spielberg influenced than anything else I’ve seen from Cameron. It’s a good exploration of first contact with underwater civilizations, and while there are cliches, some are handled well. The solider suffering psychosis has been done before better, but the divorced couple who still loves each other probably hasn’t been done as well outside Philadelphia Story.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #44/ 1940s Film #1: Citizen Kane (Criterion Ultra 4K HD Blu Ray)\n\nI think this is one of the richest movies available, where each time you watch it there are new details. This time I noticed a minor supporting character Bernstein, but the main thing is just the effort at showing a “great man” in his entirety. Charles Foster Kane may be the most fully realized character in cinema- I was going to say mainstream cinema, but I haven’t seen arguments for better in the avant garde.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #45/ 2010s Film #7: Scott Pilgrim VS The World (Ultra 4K HD Blu Ray)\n\nMan, this holds up. Edgar Wright takes specific gags I loved in the original comic, and makes it his own. The cast and visual sensibility are great. The songs are decent. It kinda reminded me of Akira in how it compresses multiple graphic novels into one satisfying two hour movie.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #46/ 1980s Film #4: Ran (Ultra 4K HD Blu Ray)\n\nSaw it on 4K and it looks great. It’s a film that benefits from the big screen, or as close to it as possible. I appreciate it how well elements of Shakespeare are adapted to a slightly different story, saying something specific about the end of the samurai era. And it is compelling to see this Lear realize the consequences of his own actions.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #47/ New Movie #31/ 1990s Movie #2: Under Pressure- Making ‘The Abyss’ (Blu Ray)\n\nIt’s an okay “Making of” which is more honest than I’d expect on why it was such a hellish shoot, and the technical difficulties.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #48/ 1970s Films #7: The Last Waltz (Ultra 4K HD Blu Ray)\n\nThe material is exceptional with a top band performing meaningful songs with A-list guests. And the anecdotes are interesting, showing how the band remembers the early days from the part of their career when they weren’t super-stars.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #49/ New Movie #32/ 2024 Film #12: Civil War (Movie-Theater)\n\nGenerally I appreciate what the film reveals about the conflict and what it doesn’t. The viewer shouldn’t know whether they’d be on the side of soldiers shooting unarmed spokeswomen. Kirsten Dunst is exceptional as a cynical reporter, although my favorite performance is from Stephen McKinley as someone well past his prime willing to take the risks.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #50/ New Movie #33/ 1980s Film #5: Friday the 13th- A New Beginning (HBO Max)\n\nThis is one of the worst films I’ve seen in some time. Even in comparison to the earlier films in the series, it just seems amateurish. The killings are boring, and the characters don’t act like anything approximating people. The concept was flawed from the start, a sequel set ten years later filmed a year later with a much more boring killer.\n\n1/10\n\nMovie #51/ New Movie #34/ 2024 Film #13: Challengers (Movie-Theater)\n\nA Social Network style rivalry, but in tennis and with a love triangle. I’m really primed to like this kind of movie, and it delivers with interesting direction and characters who are pushed to different kinds of limits, revealing complexity in addition to the horniness.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #52/ New Movie #35/ 2024 Film #14: The Fall Guy (Movie-Theater)\n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Blunt do have good chemistry here, and there are decent set pieces/ jokes about Hollywood ridiculousness.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #53/ New Movie #36/ 2024 Film #15: I Saw the TV Glow (Movie-Theater)\n\nI was a dorky kid growing up in the 90s with an appreciation for genre TV so there are parts of this I connect to. Parts of this have a different metaphor. It’s sometimes unsettling and sometimes a bit leaden.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #54/ New Movie #37/ 2024 Film #16: Hit Man (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis is a chill movie about an undercover pretend hitman who gets involved in an actual murder. Glen Powell sells the cover and the Clark Kent underneath it.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #55/ New Movie #38/ 2024 Film #17: Ricky Stanicky (Amazon Prime)\n\nIt’s an uneven comedy based on a solid premise, but John Cena and William H Macy save it.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #56/ New Movie #39/ 1930s Movie #2: The Blue Angel (Blu Ray)\n\nIt was a bit weird to see Marlene Dietrich when she’s younger, not quite an ingenue but close. She definitely has a terrific screen presence. Emil Jannings is terrific as the doomed professor who destroys his career for a woman, and whose problems might not be limited to her.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #57/ New Movie #40/ 2024 Film #18: Furiosa- A Mad Max Saga (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis is a solid companion to the superior Fury Road, functioning as a lost first half. The action sequences are great and it says something about what happens to humanity as the world collapses.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #58/ New Movie #41/ 1930s Film #3: Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (DVD)\n\nFrank Capra is a bit weird in that there seems to be a clear consensus in the order of his best movies with It’s a Wonderful Life in first place, It Happened One Night in second, Mr Smith Goes to Washington in third and this one in fourth.\n\nI was watching this to figure out what makes him unique as a director, beyond subject matter. Part of it is just the way the characters seem to live. Gary Cooper is outstanding as a small town hick who comes into a big fortune and understands when he’s being condescended to by the big city people, while Jean Arthur is great as the initially cynical reporter who falls for him. The only time I’ve seen it better might have been Clark Gable in It Happened One Night. This is just a fun movie.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #59/ 1990s Film #3: Independence Day (DVD)\n\nHonestly this was my favorite movie when I was ten years old. Sci fi action with a star performance by Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum basically phoning in a copy of his Jurassic Park, a likable cast and some wit in the script. Some of the effects are dated and some moments are dumb, but it’s fun.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #60/ New Movie #42/ 1980s Film #6: Die Hard 2 (Blu Ray)\n\nThe sequel is quite similar to the original. The situation is rather absurd with John McClane once again fighting terrorists to save his wife. The terrorists aren’t as compelling as Alan Rickman’s Hans Gruber, although there are some decent twists, and the bureaucrats are more interesting this time around.\n\n8/10\n\nThese are thoughts on films I’ve seen so far this year. I’ve decided to sort it by decade, to see ten films in each category by the end of the year. I’m counting pre-1929 as the silent era and 2023 and 2024 as separate from the 2020s, just because I’ll see so many movies from last year and this year, and I do want to stay on top of current cinema.\n\nMovie #1/ New Movie #1/ 2023 Film #1: Ferrari (Movie-Theater)\n\nPenelope Cruz is amazing as the estranged wife/ awkward business partner. Adam Driver is solid as an autocrat trying to hold it together. Patrick Dempsey is decent in the dream role for a middle-aged racing aficionado. The racing sequences are impressive, as is the depiction of the great tragedy.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #2/ New Movie #2/ 2010s Film #1: Swiss Army Man (DVD)\n\nIt is very weird. I appreciate the opening six minutes as a measure of whether someone can be on board with the rest of it. It’s an interesting debut for the Daniels and for A24. The grossness actually fits the life-affirming message that the world is beautiful, even the gross stuff. I don’t quite buy the execution of the last act when it shifts gears from private regrets to public embarrassment.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #3/ New Movie #3/ 2010s Film #2: Middle of Nowhere (DVD)\n\nIt’s a well-told film about the wife of a prisoner and a moment of crisis. It’s generous even when dealing honestly with flawed people, and depicts a very specific experience. It makes sense as an early work by a major director.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #4/ New Movie #4/ 2023 Film #2: Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis was a mediocre sequel, mostly following characters introduced in Part 1 and adding a plot derivative of Lord of the Rings (the Black Trident is basically the ring of power.) It often just looks fake, and gets me to wonder if it’s just an example of how CGI- heavy films have been compromised with Covid protocols and the expectation that everything can be fixed in post.\n\n4/10\n\nMovie #5/ 2023 Film #3: Oppenheimer (IMAX)\n\nI watched it again in Imax and it remains astounding. Something I appreciated in the fourth watch was the arcs for some of the background characters, even those played by former Oscar winners, like the set-up to Rami Malek’s testimony or reappearances by suspicious officers.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #6/ New Movie #5/ 2024 Film #1: The Beekeeper (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt’s a decent action film that obviously sets up a new potential franchise. My 77 year old dad liked it. There’s a good sense of escalation as the film often sets up bad guys who seem like they could be the big bad of the film, but then get dispatched within five minutes so someone tougher has to take over.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #7/ New Movie #6/ 2024 Film #2: Wonka (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt is basically a Roald Dahl pastiche, but a fun one. Chalamat plays the role well of an eccentric making a name for himself with hints of the excellent film we know the character for.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #8/ New Movie #7/ 2023 Film #4: Zone of Interest (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt’s an excellent depiction of the banality of evil, focusing on the family of an Auschwitz commander where they care more about garden, getting covered in ash and unexpected transfers than the atrocities. Sandra Hüller is amazing, especially when the mask slips. What’s really effective is how they just come across like upper middle class bureaucrats, discussing the operation of death camps as if it were tunnel repairs. The direction calls attention to itself, but is interesting- with some unexpected and unusual transitions. With the discussion of whether Greta Gerwig was snubbed for Barbie, I am happier to see this nominated. The five films nominated for Best Director were my five favorite films of the last year, so kudos to the academy.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #9/ New Movie #8/ 2023 Film #5: American Fiction (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt’s an intelligent take on race, dysfunctional families with Jeffrey Wright excellent as a black writer frustrated at being pigeon-holed. Writer/ Director Cord Jefferson explores these questions in clever ways.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #10/ New Movie #9/ 2023 Film #6: Origin (Movie-Theater)\n\nA docudrama focusing on the author’s experience coming up with a tome isn’t a bad way to deal with ideas. But man this film gets pretentious and self-important, especially if you see it with the Q&A after (which suggests a dialogue that doesn’t exist.) The ideas in Caste get short-shrift here, as I’m assuming the book is better than a handful of anecdotes (even if some are compelling) and someone’s realization that different societies treat the other badly.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #11/ New Movie #10/ 1970s Film #1: The Devils (Criterion Channel)\n\nThis is up my alley since I like rural horror, and movies like the Witchfinder General. Oliver Reed is compelling as a deeply flawed priest who is self-destructive and seductive in his private life but acts with integrity on an important political question. As messed up as he is, others are worse- especially Vanessa Redgrave as a crippled obsessive, Michael Gothard as a witch-hunter and Graham Armitage as a royal who does terrible things, but exposes the rot in the faithful.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #12/ New Movie #11/ 2024 Film #3: Argylle (Movie-Theater)\n\nThe film about a novelist of spy novels who stumbled onto big mysteries could have been good, and it’s worth looking at it why it fails. It’s okay with some scenes riffing on spy dramas, but that kind of meta exploration requires the underlying story to be good, and it is not. The twists are mostly predictable and sometimes lacking in execution. There’s a CGI unreality which could work for the fantasy sequences, but then the same stuff happens in the real world scenes. This is a film that could have been decent with better practical effects and another screenwriting pass.\n\n4/10\n\nMovie #13/ 1960s Film #1: Pierrot Le Fou (Criterion Blu-Ray)\n\nThere are movies Godard made that I like better (Vivre Sa Vie, Band of Outsiders), but this seems to be the ultimate example of his Brechtian vision. It’s very rich.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #14/ 2023 Film #7: Dune Part One (IMAX Movie-Theater)\n\nIt was worth checking it out again in Imax. I did appreciate the efforts to set up the final confrontation to make this seem like more than just Part 1 of 2, even if it clearly is that. It’s also so well-produced.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #15/ New Movie #12/ 1990s Film #1: City Unplugged/ Darkness in Tallinn (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis feels a lot like a Czech New Wave film, which makes sense given the historical context as a repressed country suddenly has the freedom to tell new stories (even if much of the crew is Finnish.) It was made shortly after Estonia became independent, as criminals cause a blackout as part of an effort to steal a gold shipment. It’s imperfect, but there are some great lines and one fantastic stylistic choice in the last quarter that is one of the most impressive movie scenes I’ve seen in some time. I am a bit bothered by the body count, and how we’re supposed to like the people responsible, but it is still a crowd-pleaser.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #16/ Early 2020s Film #1: Tenet (IMAX Movie-Theater)\n\nI saw this in Imax 70 MM and it was stunningly beautiful.\n\nIt takes a while to understand the mechanics of the narrative and I think I have a good understanding of it at this point. It takes a sci-fi concept in a new direction from what we’ve seen before, and Nolan is a genius for making people moving in reverse seem consistently impressive. For all the talk of how this is Nolan’s Bond, the set pieces and action sequences are better than what I see in Bond. In that category, it’s on the level of Indiana Jones.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #17/ 1970s Film #2: Young Frankenstein (Blu-Ray)\n\nIt’s weird to consider what makes this work so well when so many parodies fail. Part of it is just how well they capture the atmosphere of the Boris Karloff originals. The cast is excellent and the gags are world-class. And there is actual heart- Frankenstein’s grandson wants to help the monster.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #18/ New Movie #13: Madame Web (Movie-Theater)\n\nThe story shoehorns various Spider-Man IP characters into a story that might’ve been able to work (You could have a decent comic book story about a woman who sees the future protecting future heroines from a villain who sees them as a threat) but the execution’s just so off and the messages are twisted.\n\n3/10\n\nMovie #19/ New Movie #14/ 2024 Film #4: Dune Part 2 (Movie-Theater)\n\nMan, this was a stunning film. It was a bit less finished than I expected, explicitly feeling like the middle of a trilogy rather than the second half of a book adaptation. Chalamat is effective at showing the transition from boy to messiah, while Zendaya, Ferguson and Bardem are standouts as the main people in his life. Austin Butler and Léa Seydoux are effective as new villains; ferocity for one, and manipulativeness for the other.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #20/ 1970s Film #3: Leptirica (Blu-Ray)\n\nOn a second watch, there is a good sense of peasants trying to figure out a solution to a werewolf murdering millers, and a young man whose girlfriend’s father hates him seeing it as an opportunity first to get money to leave, and then to wed her. The twist is predictable, but the execution is decent. I do think it plays fair.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #21/ New Movie #15/ 1970s Film #4: The Murder of Fred Hampton (DVD)\n\nThis documentary doesn’t provide much context, and I’m not sure if that’s because the material would be understood by a 1970s audience for these types of films, or if this was just a Cinéma vérité approach. The first half deals with Fred Hampton as an activist. The second half is the response to his suspicious death, contrasting spokesmen for the Black Panthers with the official police explanations. It’s provocative in the best way; even if his habit of calling authorities pigs is annoying, they did so much worse to him.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #22/ 1980s Film#1: Akira (DVD)\n\nIt starts out pretty decent, the story of two friends in a motorcycle gang in a fully realized futuristic Japan. But then the scope gets bigger, and the stakes get greater for the two former friends. Just astounding. The visuals and action sequences are stunning, but there is also substance.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #23/ New Movie #16/ 2024 film #5: Love Lies Bleeding (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis lesbian bodybuilding crime-drama has some interesting twists, but also says some things about the effort to live your best life. The highlight is Ed Harris as the flawed father figure, especially when we get into just why he’s estranged from his daughter.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #24/ 2023 Film #8: Poor Things (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt’s still a weird film. It remains an excellent showcase for Emma Stone in one of the most interesting performances of the 21st Century. I have a slightly better appreciation for Mark Ruffalo’s dandy lawyer; his Oscar nomination is no longer weird.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #25/ New Movie #17/ 2000s Film #1: Sexy Beast (Criterion Channel)\n\nIt’s a story we’ve seen before of a criminal who thinks he’s out and is dragged back in, but it just feels different. It showed a new side of Ben Kingsley the actor, but it doesn’t feel like a movie as much as a career criminal who doesn’t get why everyone else is hesitating.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #26/ New Movie #18/ 1970s Film #5: The Maiden’s Tune (Blu-Ray)\n\nThis was an extra in the All The Haunts Be Ours folk horror box set. It’s not very original, but there is a good Eastern European sense of atmosphere.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #27/ 2010s Film #3: Antman and the Wasp (DVD)\n\nI watched this again with my dad, who liked the first one and who I’ve trying to get ready for Avengers: Endgame. It’s fun and shows how wrong Marvel was to try to go in a different direction for Quantumania. One thing that works is just how insufferable Hank Pym is, but I generally enjoy the dynamic of the group and challenges that aren’t about the end of the universe, but about saving one person.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #28/ New Movie #19/ 2024 Film #6: One Life (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis was a well-made movie about a decent man who convinces other people to do something meaningful to save lives during the Holocaust. It’s not very surprising, especially if you’re familiar with the story. It is no shock that Hopkins is excellent as the understated lead. It’s a decent film to watch with other people- especially normies who don’t watch a lot of movies- as a reminder that one person can make a big difference.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #29/ New Movie #20/ 2010s Film #4: Ocean‘s 8 (HBO Max)\n\nThis works really well as a hangout movie. I just like seeing Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and company figure out how to make a jewel heist work, and all the tricks. Anne Hathaway has fun as a seemingly ditzy celebrity paying more attention than she lets on. The plot is lightweight, and there’s barely any conflict, but it’s enjoyable and I can see myself watching it again. It’s a good movie to have on in the background, which is useful at times.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #30/ 1930s Film #1: Pygmalion (HBO Max)\n\nThis may have one of the smartest scripts ever written, which isn’t a shocker if this is the film that got Shaw an Oscar (making him and Bob Dylan the two Nobel Prize winning Academy Award winners.) I like that the conflict isn’t whether Higgins will succeed, but what happens to Eliza afterwards. There’s a great use of dramatic irony as Eliza has expectations about propriety and Higgins is careless about how to treat anyone, rich or poor. I do still prefer My Fair Lady, but this version is excellent.\n\n9/10\n\nFrom my perspective AI is a tool that artists can use, rather than a replacement. The main pitfalls are if it were to use an artist’s work without compensation, although there seems to be solutions.\n\nIf a program uses the work of a copyrighted artist without compensation, that would be wrong. But there should be ways to have AI-generated art that doesn’t come with that problem. Hiring young artists to churn out examples for the model (and taking advantage of public domain material) seems to be the easiest fix to the “theft” argument.\n\nIt still comes with the problem that it’s a new form of competition for professional artists, but I don’t support the argument for stagnation.\n\nComments about how artists may suffer seem to be like the libertarian complaint that if the lightbulb were invented today, the candlemakers would call for legislation protecting them. Or it would be like painters complaining about the invention of the camera.\n\nObviously if there’s theft involved, this adds insult to injury. But if you can do it without theft, there are a lot of possibilities. Some people will lose as with any change. They have specialized skills that might not translate to an environment where new tools are available.\n\nBut talented people will be able to produce more material in less time. A comics artist may be able to draw 50 pages instead of 20. A vfx team can do more. This will allow more types of stories to be told, if special effects budgets can be cheaper. Or it could also be that we’ll have a race for spectacle, and the budgets will be the same, but the effects will be bigger.\n\nThere’s a feat that it will put a lot of people out of work, I don’t think a comic book artist drawing 60 pages a month instead of 20 would put two other artists out of work. If an artist can work faster, they can appeal to a smaller audience or tell stories differently (scenes can be allowed to breathe if the cost of additional pages is reduced.) 1-2 people making the work of hundreds are just not going to produce good enough work.\n\nI don’t think AI will get good enough that a handful of people can make a 3D animated film. You’re going to need humans to sand the rough edges especially in film and comics, where it’s not just about having one image.\n\nIf AI gets good enough that someone with a program can make a movie that would’ve normally employed a hundred people, there’s not much that can be done to stop it. Pressuring Disney won’t stop independent outfits, and changes to American laws won’t stop China (though I suppose China might be nervous about whether they can control AI.)\n\nI wonder if a subtext of this controversy is that some people like artists, and want them to be financially supported even if this results in worse and more expensive art.\n\nFor the hell of it, a few months ago, I decided to try an AI art generator. I went with Bing Creator, since it seems to be well-regarded and it’s free. The above picture is a World War 2 biplane flying over Medieval Tallinn (capital on Estonia) in a pop art style.\n\nThe image quality varies a lot. A fan of Spider-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog and New York City, I asked for pictures of Spider-Man chasing Sonic the Hedgehog at Coney Island. Bing Creator approximates Spider-Man consistently, but Sonic not so much.\n\nFor this one, it kind of made a Spider-Man with Sonic’s mouth. And Sonic is certainly not on-brand.\n\nThis was a nunnery with three people in a forest. It came out okay in one image, even if it got the number of nuns wrong.\n\nThis nunnery seems unholy.\n\nThese poor sisters appear deformed.\n\nFilm language is versatile, so it is possible that there will be work-arounds to the shortcomings.\n\nThis short is a silent film based on shapes more than a hundred years ago. People adjust to things.\n\nThis the conclusion on thoughts on films I’ve seen this year. My favorite new movies of the year are Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Anatomy of a Fall, Poor Things and Godzilla Minus One. The best older films I watched for the first time this year were Blood on Satan’s Claw, John Wick: Chapter 2, Memories of Murder, Black Girl, Trading Places, Mary and Max, and Marty.\n\nMovie #151/ New Movie #109: The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (Movie-Theater)\n\nI enjoyed the Hunger Games prequel, which works okay as a standalone or as more of what worked in the original series (teens thrust into life and death situations forced to play the media while fighting one another.) The traps and challenges are decent, as are the solutions. It’s bold to feature an empathetic take on the future dictator- the relatively unknown Tom Blyth has a decent showcase here, as does Rachel Zegler, whose role as a performer plays to the actress’s strengths. There is a very clear break where it may have been a better idea to split into two movies, because it takes a turn in structure, but I can understand the reasons not to go that way and to just go for one more bite at the apple.\n\n8/10\n\nShort Movie #25: South Park- Join the Panderverse (Paramount Plus)\n\nThis works pretty well as a standalone special which tackles multiverses, diverse reimaginings, and the larger cultural problems that tie into anxiety on all of that. For years I’ve believed that when South Park is good, there’s no better satire and this is one of many examples. It targets Woke Hollywood and the people who obsess over it with decent gags and character moments.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #152/ New Movie #110: Anatomy of a Fall (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt’s a smart courtroom drama. I can’t say how accurate it is to the French legal system, although it’s intriguing to see things I take for granted in a different lens. I keep thinking about how an American version of this movie would be different, with melodramatic twists, emotional manipulation and obvious lessons where we know who the bad guys are. This version works, looking at what happens when a marriage comes under the scrutiny of a murder trial. Sandra Hüller is exceptional as a novelist in an absurd situation.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #153/ New Movie #111: Hotel Fear (Youtube)\n\nThis is pretty much the only other film directed by Francesco Barilli after The Perfume of the Lady in Black, which was an interesting giallo (he did have some collaborations in the last decade.) In terms of genre, it’s hard to place. A young woman in World War 2-era Italy tries to run a hotel surrounded by perverts and criminals. It doesn’t become a giallo until an hour it when terrible things happen and lead to a violent reprisal. But there is a good sense of atmosphere and panic.\n\n8/10\n\nShort Movie #26: Bob & Don- A Love Story (Youtube)\n\nPoignant recollections of a friendship between two of the funniest people ever. Of course the clips are going to be amazing.\n\n9/10\n\nShort Movie #27: Danny & Annie (Movie Theater)\n\nThis was an intro to a film I saw at the IFC, and it is so lovely and tender. It’s moving enough when you’ve got animated versions of an elderly couple talking about how much they love each other, based on recordings from a public radio project. But then the last few minutes…\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #154/ New Movie #112: Smoke Sauna Sisterhood (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis was an interesting project, focusing on conversations some Estonian women have inside a sauna. It’s progressive and feminist, with discussions of abortion, rape, the awkward process of coming out and health problems. It’s well shot, and some of the conversations are powerful. It’s interesting what isn’t included. They don’t talk much about their children and spouses, or professional ambitions, or at least those conversations didn’t make the final cut.\n\n9/10\n\nShort Movie #28: Life Beyond 2: The Museum of Alien Life (Youtube)\n\nThis was a weird project, an excuse to show some CGI art and theorize about the potentially radically different life that could exist in new environments. The execution is decent.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #155/ New Movie #113: Silent Night (Movie-Theater)\n\nThe John Woo revenge drama is visually interesting. The gimmick of the silent lead works okay with his difficulty making sense of life after a tragedy. It alternates between weird revenge fantasies that make John Wick and Sisu seem realistic, and scenes where we get a sense on the toll on the guy.\n\n7/10\n\nShort Movie #29: Portrait of God (Youtube)\n\nMan, this short film is creepy. It makes better effect of dark colors being pixelated on modern screens than anything else I’ve seen, and conveys a concept effectively.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #156/ New Movie #114: Maestro (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt does work better as a showcase for the Bernsteins than as a film; I wouldn’t mind if Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan win Oscars for this. The movie seems to be a bit unsure of itself, which might make sense since the subject was never sure of himself and kept wanting to contradictory things: an introvert and an extrovert, an artist and a performer, a composer and a conductor, a devoted family man and a hedonist. And then the film has great moments like a musical sequence modeled on the films he worked on, or a performance by his children that shows love in a flawed family.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #157/ New Movie #115: Godzilla Minus One (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis is probably my favorite Godzilla movie. The lead is one of the most interesting of any monster movie: a failed kamikaze pilot who finds himself with a found family after the devastation post-World War 2. Godzilla is scarier when technology is more primitive. The supporting cast surprises in positive ways: a woman introduced as being bitter that the lead survived while her children died helps take care of a baby. There is a bit of a “Good Bye, Lenin!” vibe with Japanese veterans finding purpose and accomplishment after being on the losing side of a global conflict.\n\n9/10\n\nShort Movie #30: Doctor Who- The Star Beast (Disney+)\n\nLetterboxd thinks it’s a short film and who am I to disagree? It’s a solid Doctor Who story, where Donna Noble rejoins the fray and we get a decent A-plot in the tale of the adorable Meep hunted by the Wraiths, which has a good twist and a great trial scene. It’s a satisfying new adventure for a duo that seemed done with it.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #158: Airplane! (DVD)\n\nMan, this is excellent. It’s weird to consider why it works so well when so many other parodies fail. Maybe the gags are genius. Maybe it’s how straight everyone plays it. It’s hard to appreciate with Leslie Nielsen becoming a comedy star, but the big gimmick was getting a cast known for dramatic roles in a ridiculous riff on disaster films.\n\n10/10\n\nShort Movie #31: Doctor Who- Wild Blue Yonder (Disney+)\n\nI expect to see the three Tennant/ Tate specials pop up in best of lists. This one’s a solid example of something the series does well, an exploration of a space where one thing is creepy. And we get the beginning of the mavity running gag, and the final appearance of one of the best companions.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #159: Die Hard (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt was great to see this on the big screen. One thing I appreciate is the attention to detail, as well as how McLane and his enemies figure out one another. It’s a decent spotlight of decadent LA in the late 80s.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #160/ New Movie #116: Napoleon (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt works for excellent military set pieces, and a look at the ultimate example of a cult of personality, a great man who led his followers to success after success, and then lost his touch.\n\n8/10\n\nShort Movie #32: Doctor Who- The Giggle (Disney+)\n\nThe Toymaker, especially Neil Patrick Harris’ version is a great enemy for Doctor Who. This is a continuity heavy story that sets up more flexibility going forward. And it ends up being a hell of a debut for Ncuti Gatwa, as well as a celebration of what makes the Doctor special and what he needs.\n\n10/10\n\nShort Movie #33: Lava (Youtube)\n\nJust a lovely tribute to Israel Kamakawiwo’ole and Hawaii.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #161/ New Movie #117: Poor Things (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis is a weird riff on gothic horror exploring what it’s like if it’s really for mature audiences. Emma Stone is incredible, depicting the transformation of a child into a philosopher in the same body. The cinematography and sets are amazing. Ruffalo is absurd and different than usual, although I’m more impressed by Willem Defoe’s benevolent mad scientist.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #162/ New Movie #118: Saltburn (Movie-Theater)\n\nThis story of a scholarship kid at Oxford ingratiating himself into a rich family comes at a time of “eat the rich” films (Parasite, Triangle of Sadness, the Menu) where the main distinguishing thing is how perverted it’s all allowed to go, and the cast of grotesques. There are some developments that are presented as twists that seem very obvious, but the ending does land.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #163/ New Movie #119: Melchior the Apothecary (DVD)\n\nThis is the first in a series of medieval Estonian mysteries. An apothecary (pharmacist) makes sense as the lead of that kind of series, and I like how it depicts the chaos of the times, when powerful knights can deputize people and force them to help. It’s not the best start. The production values are excellent for Estonian film, but the story is a bit generic, the lead is bland and the case doesn’t seem to have stakes for the detective.\n\n5/10\n\nShort Movie #34: Doctor Who- The Church on Ruby Road (Disney+)\n\nThe Christmas special is pleasant, introducing a new companion and setting goblins up as a race of bad guys worthy of further exploration, though there’s plenty here with the language of ropes and emphasis on luck. I like how they show the meaning Ruby brought her family, which makes this a decent Christmas story.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #164/ New Movie #120: White Christmas (DVD)\n\nIt’s a bit weird to have Bing Crosby playing a slightly ungrateful square, but the songs are great and it is fun. Just a cozy film.\n\n9/10\n\nShort Movie #35: South Park- Not Suitable for Children(Disney+)\n\nMatt Stone and Trey Parker compromised on the quality of South Park, and likely gave up years of their creative life in the combination of their deals with HBO/ Max and Paramount+, which include these specials. I can’t blame them if nine figure sums were on the table. It’s a fun riff on influencers and the morals of selling out, which seems like the Streaming Wars specials to be an admission.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #165: Hamilton (Disney+)\n\nIt remains one of my favorite works of art of the 21st Century. The songs are incredible. The scale is both epic and personal. Renée Elise Goldsberry and Leslie Odom Jr give two of the best performances ever.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #166/ New Movie #121: The Boy and the Heron (Movie-Theater)\n\nIt’s excellent that Hayao Miyazaki had at least one more film in him, and appropriate that when he decided to join directors like Stephen Spielberg, James Grey and Alfonso Cuaron in telling a story inspired by his coming of age, it includes a doorway to a fantasy world.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #167/ New Movie #122: Crimes of the Future 1970 (DVD)\n\nIt’s mostly a low-budget sci-fi with a parody of how messed up things can get. For the most part, it seems tame compared to modern takes on these topics. But there’s something messed up in the last few minutes that just made me lose interest in finishing the film, even if I know it’s not going where it seems to be. But it’s just too gross.\n\nN/A\n\nMovie #168: Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde (Max)\n\nFrederich March is excellent as the two sides of Jekyl and Hyde. The film suffers a bit from the clumsiness of early sound, but benefits greatly from being pre-code.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #169: Unforgiven (4k Ultra HD Blu-Ray)\n\nMan, this is even better than I remembered. Gene Hackman is set up really well as the antagonist, a man who isn’t taken seriously as a carpenter, but is quite impressive against gunslingers. It’s probably the best western Eastwood ever made, and may possibly be the best ever, as the ultimate deconstruction.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #170/ New Movie #123: Promising Young Woman (Amazon Prime)\n\nThe casting is excellent here. Carey Mulligan depicts a woman defined by tragedy who doesn’t get how everyone else isn’t, and it works to have someone more girl next door than bombshell in a film abotu the willingness of men to abuse. The “nice guys” make an effective statement.\n\n9/10\n\nThis is a continuation of thoughts on films I’ve seen this year.\n\nMovie #121/ New Movie #89: Black Girl (Movie Theater)\n\nThis is a film that can be appreciated in its context as the first major Sub-Saharan project and a snapshot of a particular cultural time. But it’s also quite effective as a showcase of a woman in turmoil, going to a foreign land with high expectations and discovering that life in France is worse than what she left behind in Africa, and languishing in an inability to communicate, as well as the carelessness of her employers.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #122/ New Movie #90: Dumb Money (Movie Theater)\n\nIt really wants to be The Social Network, and not just because Aaron Sorkin was the first choice for screenwriter and its based on a book treatment by Ben Mezrich. It just seems to go for similar vibes. The results are fine, although it seems to try to hard to be pro-Reddittor propaganda.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #123: The Dark Knight (Movie Theater)\n\nSo the Writers and Actors Guild strikes are bad for the film industry and bad for creative types, but since it leads to movie theaters playing the Dark Knight trilogy again, and various other weird repertory things that wouldn’t be expected outside of arthouse cinemas, it’s working out for me.\n\nObviously, the Dark Knight is a great film. Ledger’s Joker is one of the best villains ever, and it clearly reached the public consciousness, but it seems underappreciated in serious analysis. Joker is so effective as an agent of chaos, who just pushes everyone else to their absolute limits and raises interesting questions about whether might makes right when the bad guy is just ridiculously effective.\n\nI wonder if Eric Roberts has ever alluded to the idea that he had a pretty big role in a film more significant than anything his sister ever did.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #124/ New Movie #91:Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench (DVD)\n\nIt’s amateurish and promising, a low-budget film school project made by a future Oscar winning director, a proof of concept for something like La La Land. But there are some good moments, in the depiction of everyday awkwardness and even more heightened awkwardness, like an innocent encounter between a young woman and a retired cop that they have to explain to the guy’s daughter. The music’s pretty good since this was also a calling card for Justin Hurwitz.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #125/ New Movie #92: Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife (DVD)\n\nThis kinda feels like a film Netflix would have commissioned if they existed in the 1930s. It’s an A-list director Ernst Lubitsch (with Billy Wilder on screenplay) adapting a major property (remake of a Norma Shearer silent film which was itself an adaptation of a French theatrical farce) with a major cast (Claudette Colbert, Gary Cooper and David Niven have four Oscars between them.) The first half is kind of slow, with Cooper miscast as a high-strung millionaire. The second half is an underwritten revenge scheme. There are some decent moments, although the main reason to watch this is the weirdness that it got made at all.\n\n6/10\n\nMovie #126: Stop Making Sense (Imax)\n\nMan, it was worth seeing this on Imax. I might appreciate it even more if I was a bit more into David Byrne or the Talking Heads. Some critic had an illuminating point that this functions quite well as the story of a weird guy giving in to the power of music, and making friends.\n\nI can appreciate the focus on what it’s like on stage, with a combination of catchy songs and an unconventional way of introducing everything, with one player of the band joining at a time. And then there’s the literal rock star charisma of David Byrne, in a way that’s a bit odd, but the film is evidence that he could have been a movie star as well; he gives off Jeff Goldblum and Daniel Day Lewis vibes.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #127/ New Movie #93: The Creator (Movie Theater)\n\nIt’s a new sci-fi story outside of any established universe with its own well-established backstory and sense of aesthetic. The production values are really good, and it depicts a suitably messy conflict and one guy’s realization that he was very much in the wrong. Some twists are predictable, but there is a good sense of the realism in outlandish scenarios.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #128/ New Movie #94: A Haunting in Venice (Movie Theater)\n\nIt’s an okay locked room mystery. The Venice setting is used well and there are some interesting twists.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #129/ New Movie #95: Marty (DVD)\n\nIt’s a relatively short film about a likable guy deciding to make the right decision despite pressure against him. It’s just nice to see a film about someone so salt of the earth.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #130: Avengers: Infinity War (Blu-Ray)\n\nThis is a pretty good escalation of the previous Avengers films, bringing in Dr Strange, Spider-Man, the Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther. Thanos and his death cult are sufficiently impressive villains. Recent movies have shown that this film wasn’t guaranteed to land as well as it did.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #131: The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (Blu-Ray)\n\nThe highlight is obviously the expressionistic sets, but it is worth checking out for the other reason because this was at one point the best movie ever made. The competition was the work of DW Griffith, and various serials.\n\n10/10\n\nShort Movie #20: From Caligari to Hitler (Blu-Ray)\n\nThis is a decent extra on the Kino Caligari blu-ray, a documentary that looks at the historical context of films in Weimar Germany while considering a critic’s views that this also says something about how German Society would go very wrong (even if it was not an example of that.)\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #132: Frankenstein (DVD)\n\nThe first big Universal film seems a bit unfinished at times, but comes with one of the great film monsters in Karloff’s Frankenstein.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #133: Bride of Frankenstein (DVD)\n\nI have to agree with the consensus that this sequel is better than the original, building on the story and its themes, while introducing some new concepts and sticking with excellent production designs, and benefitting from a director who has much more fluid camera motion than was the typical in the early sound era.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #134: The Invisible Man (Amazon Prime Video)\n\nAlong with the first two Frankenstein films, and The Old Dark House, this is a reminder that James Whale is one of the best horror directors ever. The story just covers what the reaction would be if a lunatic was able to turn invisible. It’s a great showcase for the mostly offscreen Claude Rains, the debut of a major film career.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #136/ New Movie #96: Kadaicha (Blu Ray- All the Haunts Be Ours collection)\n\nThis Australian teens targeted by ghosts film is generic and weirdly shot. There’s a level of amateurishness that I’m not used to. The plot and ghosts are mostly stuff we’ve seen before. The big difference is the aboriginal connection. The metaphor of kids trying to get their parents to admit mistakes and heal tormented spirits is rather on the nose, but is ahead of its time.\n\n6/10\n\nMovie #137/ New Movie #97: Killers of the Flower Moon (Movie Theater)\n\nThis is a good and rich film on multiple levels. Lily Gladstone excels in a difficult performance, depicting someone poisoned by her family unable to articulate her suspicions. DeCaprio is bold for his willingness to play someone so vile and stupid. We’ve been waiting decades for a Scorsese/ DeCaprio/ De Niro film and it is worth the time. Brendan Fraser, John Lithgow and Jesse Pleimons are great. I wouldn’t mind a surprise Oscar nomination for any of them, although it may be a good idea to push for Tantoo Cardinal or Cara Jade Myers in the now open Best Supporting Actress category, with their depiction of other victims of the plot. This is an important film that allows for a lot of nuance and discussion, without obscuring how vile the betrayal was.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #138/ New Movie #98: Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (Blu-Ray)\n\nIt really should be called Abbott and Costello meet Dracula, given Bela Lugosi’s bigger role. It’s a decent comedy vehicle as two dopes intersect with Universal horror monsters, though I may miss part of their appeal. There might be some context in which they’re funnier.\n\n8/10\n\nMovie #139: Night of the Living Dead (Criterion Blu-Ray)\n\nIt feels like it was made years into the genre, rather than something that created an entirely new type of film monster. It’s good enough that it might never be surpassed, just because there will never be a zombie film where people aren’t expected to be aware of the living dead series.\n\n10/10\n\nMovie #140/ New Movie #99: The Quatermass Xperiment (DVD)\n\nCompetent and sometimes enjoyable, but often boring.\n\n6/10\n\nShort Movie #21: The Telltale Heart (Youtube)\n\nThe 1957 short narrated by James Mason is astounding. The sense of mood is exceptional.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #141/ New Movie #100: Sleeper Must Awaken: Making Dune (Arrow Video Player)\n\nIt’s a relatively typical behind the scenes documentary, although it does show the level of care and thought that was put into an epic flop. There are plenty of decent anecdotes, like why Patrick Stewart came in at the last moment or Orson Welles’ response to a casting offer.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #142/ New Movie #101: The Great Ziegfeld (DVD)\n\nThe early Best Picture winner tells the story of a great but often broke producer in the style of his shows, where every and now everything is paused for an extravagant showpiece. There are some really impressive performances, especially the Fanny Brice cameo.\n\n7/10\n\nMovie #143/ New Movie #102: The Slumber Party Massacre (Arrow Video Player)\n\nTonally it’s a mess, a script that was a satire of horror movies produced as a generic horror movie, just more ridiculous than most. I guess there’s an excuse for the cliches.\n\n4/10\n\nMovie #144: The Nightmare Before Christmas (Movie Theater)\n\nWatching it on the big screen, the visuals are really impressive. The character designs are astounding, and they’ve got a sense of three visual schemes: Halloween, Christmas and the unholy amalgamation. The songs are excellent. The story’s a bit thin.\n\n9/10\n\nShort Movie #22: Italianamerican (Criterion Blu-Ray)\n\nMartin Scorsese makes enjoyable home movies.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #145/ New Movie #103: Penda’s Fen (Blu Ray- All the Haunts Be Ours collection)\n\nThis is just a weird and interesting example of English folk horror, as a young religiously conservative man grapples with same-sex desires and the realization he is destined for something evil and twisted. It’s a weird and new mythology that unfolds in such a matter of fact way.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #146/ New Movie #104: The Marvels (Movie Theater)\n\nThe Captain Marvel sequel is a mixed bag. I like the central dynamic between Danvers, Rambeau and fangirl Kamala Khan. Some of the sequences are impressive. I don’t quite buy the central drama of why Danvers hasn’t been back to Earth (her character seems undefined and almost detached), and the main villain is generic. The herding cats and musical planet sequences are fun, although likely could have been done better.\n\n6/10\n\nMovie #147/ New Movie #105: It’s a Wonderful Knife (Movie Theater)\n\nSeems up my alley as a fan of It’s a Wonderful Life and horror films. The angel design is decent. I didn’t care for it. I just don’t buy how bad things get, even with a potential supernatural explanation. There is also something odd about a horror movie where casualties are so inconsequential, because of the possibility the hero will fix everything.\n\n5/10\n\nMovie #148/ New Movie #106: The Holdovers (Movie Theater)\n\nIt feels like a New Hollywood film focusing on a character study (Five Easy Pieces, The Graduate), something that would get its own Criterion edition. It’s a good piece about some very different characters forced together, all much more complicated than is immediately apparent. Da’Vine Joy Randolph ends up stealing the show, given what she’s been through and how that shapes her, and I recognize that if this film were made in the early 1970s when it was set, her role would be much smaller. Giamati is fearless, and Dominic Sessa has an amazing debut as a kid who seems privileged and obnoxious, but has great complexity.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #149/ New Movie #107: The Killer (Movie Theater)\n\nIt’s a decent drama about a hitman seeking revenge that pokes fun at the stereotypical criminal philosopher showing how full of shit they really are. And because it’s David Fincher, it is beautifully shot.\n\n8/10\n\nShort Movie #23: The Pledge (Blu Ray- All the Haunts Be Ours collection)\n\nThis short about highwaymen honoring a promise to an executed comrade unfolds in a matter of fact manner, and gets to an interesting conclusion.\n\n7/10\n\nShort Movie #24: Parent Teacher(Arrow Video Player)\n\nThis is an impressive short film, taking a simple concept of a parent teacher conference where the parents are acting like high-school brats, and making it one unbroken shot. And the central performance of a new teacher breaking down just works.\n\n9/10\n\nMovie #150/ New Movie #108: The Perfume of the Lady in Black (DVD)\n\nThis is different than the usual Giallo, showcasing a young woman’s breakdown in the wake of a Rosemary’s Baby style conspiracy. The atmosphere is decent. It’s nice and creepy.\n\n8/10"
