Prior to the release of Spider-Man in 2002, superhero films were few and far between, at least compared to the half-dozen a year we're now used to. Books without pictures had long been a goldmine for the film industry, however, and the 1990s in particular produced a string of art house darlings and big hits from a variety of genres: literary fiction, historical fiction, sci-fi, horror, thriller, romance, biography.  Here are some cinematic highlights from that last gasp of the pre-spandex era, with the books that inspired them. (J.C.)",

With its multiple points of view derived from Tom Perrotta's novel, this way-smarter-than-average film adaptation skewers politics--electoral and sexual--en route to a wider commentary on human nature.

Over time, Fanny comes to demonstrate forcibly those virtues Austen most admired: modesty, firm principles, and a loving heart. As Fanny watches her cousins Maria and Julia cast aside their scruples in dangerous flirtations (and worse), and as she herself resolutely resists the advantages of marriage to the fascinating but morally unsteady Henry Crawford, her seeming austerity grows in appeal and makes clear why she was Austen's own favorite among her heroines.

Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen, Kevin Kline, Tobey Maguire, Elijah Wood, and Christina Ricci make up the top-notch cast portraying sympathetic characters confused by cultural changes and numb to real emotion until tragedy strikes.

The unnamed (and extremely unreliable) narrator, who makes his living investigating accidents for a car company in order to assess their liability, is combating insomnia and a general sense of anomie by attending a steady series of support-group meetings for the grievously ill, at one of which (testicular cancer) he meets a young woman named Marla. She and the narrator get into a love triangle of sorts with Tyler Durden, a mysterious and gleefully destructive young man with whom the narrator starts a fight club, a secret society that offers young professionals the chance to beat one another to a bloody pulp. Writing in an ironic deadpan and including something to offend everyone, Palahniuk is a risky writer who takes chances galore, especially with a particularly bizarre plot twist he throws in late in the book. Caustic, outrageous, bleakly funny, violent and always unsettling, Palahniuk's utterly original creation will make even the most jaded reader sit up and take notice.

Despite the obvious darkness of the material, it is both sad and funny, profane and poetic as well as brilliant and bracingly original. This remains immersive, exhilarating stuff, its whip-smart observations delivered with stinging humor that can make you laugh, cry, and gasp in horror.

On an arts grant, she leaves New Zealand (her home, but where she was also hospitalized) for Europe as this third volume begins: to London, then Ibiza, Andorra, and London again, literally in search of her place in the world not as a schizophrenic but as a writer, an \"envoy from mirror city\"--that place that \"lay within as the city of the imagination.\" (Kirkus) Show less\n\nNotorious poet and playwright Oscar Wilde devours all that life has to offer, but there's only so much that late Victorian England will tolerate.

Dora is a young English artist who is part of the Bloomsbury Group, an assemblage of British writers, painters, and eccentrics that includes the likes of Virginia Woolf and E.M. Forster, when she meets Strachey. A confirmed homosexual before meeting Carrington, Strachey inquires who the \"ravishing boy\" is and discovers that it's a woman. Shocked to discover this, he finds himself captivated by her, and they begin an unusual 17-year love affair/friendship.

In Eminent Victorians (1918), Strachey stripped away the pious camouflage of Victorian society, targeting hypocrisy, imperialism, militarism and religion. Drawing on thousands of letters by Strachey and his Bloomsbury coterie, Holroyd unearths details of Strachey's adolescent self-loathing and sexual guilt; his proposing marriage to Virginia Woolf in an effort to renounce his homosexuality; his pacifism during WWI; and his relationship with his adoring live-in companion, painter Dora Carrington, who tolerated his gay affairs.
