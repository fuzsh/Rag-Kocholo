        "text": "This is the third in my series about the best Australian drama films (after The Top 40 Australian Period Films – ranked and The Top 22 Australian Contemporary Drama Films of the 1970s & 1980s).\n\nAs I explained last time, “contemporary drama films” is not a commonly used genre, but I am using it to distinguish these films from ‘period dramas’. My definition is based largely on what contemporary drama films are not: they are NOT period drama films, NOR are they comedies, action films, crime-dramas or horror films. They are simply drama films set roughly in the same period that they are made.\n\nSo, this page is about Australian drama films both made in the 1990s and set in, or close to, the 1990s. This genre became much more popular in Australia in the 1990s, as the period dramas, action and horror films of the 70s and 80s took a back seat for a while. The new directors of the 1990s took a fresh look at contemporary Australian society and found new, and often quirky, stories to tell.\n\nSo let’s examine what Australian stories in the 1990s the best of our film-makers chose to tell about their own era.\n\n1. Proof (1991) (Jocelyn Moorhouse)\n\nMartin is a suspicious blind man who takes photos as proof that people aren’t lying to him. His relationship with his housekeeper, Celia, is disturbed when Martin makes a new friend Andy. This is an excellent mature interpersonal drama about issues of trust, compulsion and insecurity. Hugo Weaving is at his twitchy best, as the bitter, mistrustful Martin; Genevieve Picot equally complex as Celia and a young Russell Crowe, in one of his first film roles, is great as the charismatic young Andy. The unfolding of the story is reminiscent of Antonioni’s Blow Up or one of Hitchcock’s lighter films, as debutant director Jocelyn Moorhouse slowly reveals details to the audience, paralleling the way Martin discerns details from his photos. The film is also humorous in parts. Moorhouse was one of ‘Second Wave’ directors (Baz Luhrmann, PJ Hogan, Rolf de Heer etc) who made a series of classic films in the 1990s, after our great 1970s directors had made their way to Hollywood. The film swept the AFI awards in 1991, winning awards for best film, best director, best actor and best supporting actor. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n2. Shine (1996) (Scott Hicks)\n\nShine is based on the true story of piano prodigy, David Helfgott, the troubled Australian-Jewish musical prodigy and tells the story of his recovery from mental illness to find love, fulfilment and success. Geoffrey Rush is wonderful in his award-winning portrayal of Helfgott’s manic genius, and brought his touching and inspiring story to the world. Noah Taylor also gives an excellent performance as Helfgott in his teenage years, but it is Rush’s performance that lifts the film. The film is full of humour, sadness, disappointment, perseverance and elation, and celebrates Helfgott’s remarkable life, and those who helped him recover from the hard times. Rush’s performance introduced him to international audiences and led him to great success in many other significant films, both internationally and in Australia. The film won the 1996 AFI awards for best film and best director, and Rush won not only the AFI best actor award, but also the Academy Award, BAFTA award and Golden Globe awards for best actor. Armin Mueller-Stahl, who played the father, also won the AFI best supporting actor award. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n3. The Interview (1998) (Craig Monahan)\n\nA policeman arrests, abuses and conducts an interrogation of a loner he suspects of murder. This is a gripping psychological thriller about a battle of wits between an aggressive policeman and a seemingly ordinary man who lives alone in a humble flat. Tony Martin has his best role as the ambitious and apparently unscrupulous cop trying to pin a murder on an odd individual, whom his guts tell him did the crime, but for which can’t find hard evidence. Hugo Weaving is exceptional as the enigmatic loner. Is he a man without friends who is an easy scapegoat for the police, or is he a cunning operator with a secret to hide? In this film, your sympathies shift from one to the other, saving the answer for the end. Highly recommended, this film won the 1998 AFI award for best film and Weaving won the best actor award. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n4. The Last Days of Chez Nous (1992) (Gillian Armstrong)\n\nA younger sister, returning to Sydney after a failed affair in Europe, moves in with her married sister, bringing them both joy followed by disruption. This ‘homecoming’ film examines the relationships of two Australian sisters with each other and their men. The film bristles with life and home-truths, and is both enjoyable and thought-provoking. Novelist Helen Garner, of Monkey Grip fame, did the screenplay, and the film explores Garner’s notion of relationships as tentative, changing, clumsy and insecure, and captures Garner’s observations of inner-city life in the 70s and 80s and the chaotic hedonism of the last of the baby-boomers. Kerry Fox is excellent as the selfish, immature younger sister, and Lisa Harrow and Bruno Ganz are also good as the couple whose outer success hides deeper problems. A young Miranda Otto is also impressive as the adolescent daughter. It is better than the film of Garner’s fine novel Monkey Grip and English actress Lisa Harrow won the AFI best actress award for this film. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n5. Romper Stomper (1992) (Geoffrey Wright)\n\nHando, a racist skinhead leads his gang against the local Vietnamese community, but conflicts arise with his girlfriend and best mate. It’s a confronting examination of a racist, violent skinhead gang in Melbourne in the 1990s. It’s a good examination of the largely inarticulate rage of a group of unemployed working-class youth who adopt a skinhead culture for solidarity and community in a world whose values they reject. It’s violent and sometimes senseless, but the characters are convincing and even comprehensible. Russell Crowe is chillingly forceful the skinhead leader, Hando, and Jacqueline McKenzie and Daniel Pollack are excellent as Hando’s girlfriend, and best mate Davey. The film starts with some brutal bashings which escalates with unexpected results. At the same time, Wright examines the internal dynamics of the gang with its member’s loves, hates and rivalries on show. It’s a wild, nihilistic ride with these frustrated kids. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n6. Angel Baby (1995) (Michael Rymer)\n\nTwo schizophrenics meet and fall in love at their mental health group. Angel Baby is a moving insight into the world of schizophrenics, with all the highs and lows. It is also a wonderful portrait of first love and relationships, with all those highs and lows. Jacqueline McKenzie is great as the passionate Kate, a young woman trying to keep the voices in her head at bay. John Lynch is also very good as Harry, full of love and compassion, and usually more in control of his condition. They make some bad decisions but their love shines through in the end. Colin Friels plays Morris, Harry’s supportive brother, though he is a bit inarticulate at times; Deborah-Lee Furness is better as Morris’s wife. The film won all the major AFI awards in 1995: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Actor. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n7. Praise (1998) (John Curran)\n\nAn aimless young asthmatic who drinks and smokes too much, meets a vibrant young woman with a skin-condition and insatiable libido, who shares his interests in drinking and smoking, and they try to construct a relationship for several months. This is a challenging film with lots of explicit sex and a couple of individuals with some very unattractive characteristics and a lack of conventional ambition to better their lives of lazy poverty. But there is also a truth in the way their relate to each other, and moments of kindness in their lives of self-indulgence. Peter Fenton is more famous as a rock musician, but here he plays a lazy loser with a certain charm and charisma. Sacha Horler bravely plays a loud, abrasive and needy young woman, who falls in love with Fenton’s character’s uncritical inertia. The film is at times funny, at times repellent and at times poetic, in its unflinching portrait of a relationship between two flawed young people. Music by The Dirty Three and other musicians enhances the moody atmosphere. Not a film for everyone, but with a lot of insight into a section of Australian society. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n8. A Woman’s Tale (1991) (Paul Cox)\n\nMartha, an old, chain-smoking European migrant living alone in Melbourne, is nearing the end of her life, but approaches each day with energy, love and concern for others. Martha, played wonderfully by Sheila Florance, has a frail body, but a strong mind and a determined will, and is an inspiration to those wondering about their old age. Martha helps her neighbour with dementia, helps her visiting nurse with her love life, spends her days out walking and chatting with old friends, and resists her son’s pleas to move into a nursing home. Though sometimes haunted by sad memories of the war in Europe, she believes in love and positivity, though the frequent funerals of old friends annoys her as her circle of friends continues to shrink. It’s an inspiring and moving portrait of a woman determined to live her life to the full right to the end. Florance won the AFI Best Actress Award for this film in 1991. She is ably supported with good performances by three Paul Cox regulars, Gosia Dobrowolska as the nurse, Norman Kaye as her neighbour, and Chris Haywood as the son. Paul Cox made 20 films in his 40-year career, and this is one of his best. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n9. Idiot Box (1996) (David Caesar)\n\nMick and Kev are two average, unemployed, bored blokes who drink beer, watch TV (‘the Idiot Box’) and muck around on the street. When their money runs out, they decide to rob a bank, despite their lack of any know-how. David Caesar knows about the Australian working class and underclass, and has created a very convincing picture of life for two young larrikins, who have no skills, no money and no motivation to work. There only ambitions are to have fun and get chicks. Kev (Ben Mendelsohn) is the angrier of the two and constantly takes risks for the thrills; Mick (Jeremy Sims) sometimes goes along with Kev’s crazy ideas, but sometimes acts as a restraining influence. When Kev gets the idea that robbing a bank will solve all their money problems, their life of idiotic pranks threatens to spin out of control. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n10. Floating Life (1996) (Clara Law)\n\nA Hong Kong family decide to join their daughter in Australia, prior to the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from UK to China, but find their new life strange. This is a marvellous little film about the experience of migration, and the difficulties in adjusting to a totally different culture and language. Four members of the Chan family (the aging parents and the two youngest sons) in Hong Kong decide to follow Bing Chan, the second eldest daughter, to Australia to find security before Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. But Bing has bought a house in a sterile new housing development on the edge of the Sydney, with plenty of space but none of the social buzz that the family was used to in Hong Kong. Though they try to maintain their Chinese traditions, the new country does not feel right to the parents, and tensions rise as Bing tries to force them to adjust. Meanwhile, the eldest sister Yen is living in Germany with a German husband and a child, and the eldest son has stayed behind in Hong Kong with a busy sexual life. The film’s mood switches from comic to poignant to hopeful to resigned, as the parents try to keep the family together. It’s a revealing look at the complexity of migration and the millions of such stories being played out in Australia today that Australian-born residents have little inkling of. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n11. The Boys (1998) (Rowan Woods)\n\nPetty criminal Brett arrives home after a year in prison, and is disturbed to find that his two younger brothers and their girlfriends, plus his mother and her boyfriend, are living happily without him in the family house that he used to rule. When he starts to bully everyone again with sarcasm and threats, the tension rises and threatens to spin out of control. This is a frightening realistic study of violent criminal brothers, and of the dynamics of power relationships, both within families and within groups of men competing to establish a pecking order. David Wenham is very menacing as Brett, the former alpha-male trying to re-establish himself (a world away from Wenham’s well-known Diver Dan character). The support cast is also very strong, with John Polson and Anthony Hayes playing the other brothers, Toni Collette tough as nails as Brett’s girlfriend, Michelle, and Lynette Curran as Brett’s long-suffering mum. All the top cast were nominated for AFI acting awards, though only Collette and Polson won the best supporting categories. The film also won AFI awards for best direction and best adapted screenplay. It’s a chillingly effective experience. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n12. No Worries (1993) (David Elfick)\n\nMatilda is a happy 11-year-old girl living on her parent’s farm in western NSW. She is a happy, resourceful kid who loves her parents, her friends at the tiny bush school, and the animals on their farm, especially her dog, Dingo. She knows all the 13 other kids at the school and all of the adults in the neighbourhood. When a dust storm during a long drought proves the final straw that drives their farm to ruin, Matilda is suddenly uprooted from her rural paradise and taken to live with an uncle and aunt in Sydney, where she is thrown into a new class of mainly migrant and Asian kids and where she doesn’t know anybody. No Worries is both moving and entertaining, and the best film I know of that captures the tragedy and trauma of drought in rural communities. But the film is also about the resilience of the human spirit in the face of tragedy, and people’s ability to get back up and try something new. Geoff Morrell and Susan Lyons are wonderful as Matilda’s parents, and the supporting cast includes John Hargreaves, Steven Vidler, Ray Barrett, Harold Hopkins and many more. Despite the difficult subject, the film, like most of the characters, somehow manages to stay upbeat and hopeful. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n13. What I Have Written (1996) (John Hughes)\n\nAn Australian academic novelist-poet and his wife stay for a while in Paris, mixing with the artistic set there. The poet meets a mysterious older woman just before he returns to Melbourne, and they begin an erotic correspondence together. When the poet is hospitalised, his wife becomes aware of the correspondence through an academic friend who has his own motives. This is an inventive, intriguing piece of arthouse cinema, backed up by a strong narrative, about an unfaithful husband, a suspicious wife, an unreliable colleague and a femme fatale far away in France. The film-maker mixes black-and-white stills of the action, with normal action in colour, and overlays segments of the film with the writer’s poetry and prose, as well as showing fictional scenes alongside real scenes. The four main actors: Martin Jacobs, Angie Milliken, Gillian Jones, and Jacek Koman, sometimes play the real characters, and at other times fictional characters based loosely on themselves. In other words there is fiction inside fiction. It’s all done so well, evoking the feelings of desire and betrayal. But the twists of the story make it especially satisfying, as the writer finds his own life fictionalised by another. This is reminiscent of Paul Cox’s films, especially Man of Flowers. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n14. Dance Me to My Song (1998) (Rolf de Heer)\n\nThis is an interesting, and at times shocking, but also moving and humorous, film about the private life of a woman with cerebral palsy. Julia, played by a woman with cerebral palsy, Heather Rose (who also co-wrote the script), is a woman in her 20s or 30s who cannot speak or walk, and has only limited use of one hand and her head. She communicates using a laborious electronic voice machine, into which she must slowly type each letter with her uncoordinated hand, but also with her expressive eyes. She needs a day nurse to get her out of bed, feed her, wash her, take her to the toilet before leaving her alone for most of the day in her electric wheelchair. She shows her intelligence when she gets a chance, and, when she befriends a passing stranger called Eddie, at last she sees an opportunity for love and romance. The film has a lot of nudity and allusions to sex, but it’s a fascinating, shocking and at times very funny insight into the lives of disabled people. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n15. Head On (1998) (Ana Kokkinos)\n\nAri is a young gay Greek-Australian man, who indulges in risky sex and drugs, as he struggles to find his place in a city where his sexuality is rejected by his Greek family and friends. This is a gritty insight into Ari’s personal Bermuda triangle of gay, Greek-Australian, and drug subcultures in 90s Melbourne, with Alex Dimitriades giving an outstanding performance as Ari. It’s a powerfully confronting film about a man trying to live honestly in a society which rejects the different elements of his identity. The film is not for everyone, as it contains confronting rough sex scenes, family infighting, and casual drug-taking. It’s a well-made, bold and convincing exploration of modern society. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n16. Father (1990) (John Power)\n\nAn elderly German immigrant, living a happy life with his loving daughter and granddaughters in their Melbourne pub, is suddenly accused by an elderly Lithuanian woman of being a Nazi responsible for the massacre of civilians during World War Two. This is an intriguing and moving film about a man who thinks he has left his past crimes behind him, as he created a new life in Australia with a loving family. The film is full of great performances, notably from Max Von Sydow as the accused man, and also from Carol Drinkwater as his daughter, Julia Blake as his accuser, and Steve Jacobs as the daughter’s husband. The film shows the effect that such a revelation can have on a happy loving family, even as some justice is found for the crimes that happen during wartime. The pace of the film is lively, considering the weight of the crimes being discussed, and a lot of ground is covered by the time the climax is reached. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n17. The Quiet Room (1996) (Rolf de Heer)\n\nA seven-year-old girl refuses to speak in protest against her parents’ arguments, but carries on a lively commentary inside her head as she tries to make sense of, and influence, her family situation. Rolf de Heer’s films are unusual and challenging, but rarely dull. The young Chloe Ferguson is amazing as the unnamed Girl, whose external silence contrasts with her witty, sometimes knowing but sometimes naïve internal monologue. She observes her parents and their attempts to make her break her silence with a stubborn resistance, waiting for their outbreaks of bickering to end. Her behaviour exasperates her parents, though they appear to have largely accepted their daughter’s odd choice. The film looks at the relationship of the parents from the child’s perspective. It’s a very interesting, moving and at times amusing film about families and the difficulties of being a parent. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n18. Hotel Sorrento (1995) (Richard Franklin)\n\nThree adult sisters are reunited at their childhood home for the first time in years, but the reunion is overshadowed by a family tragedy. Richard Franklin’s adaptation of Hannie Rayson’s play is a delight. The reunion takes place with the two sisters who have been living overseas return: Meg has become a famous author in England, but Pippa has been less successful in her American advertising career. They join the third sister, Hilary, who has stayed behind living with their father in the small seaside town of Sorrento, outside Melbourne. There is tension over Meg’s book called Melancholy, which is a barely disguised look at her childhood in Australia in the 70s and 80s. The film comments on the thinness of Australian culture in those days, but also captures the loss of a more relaxed way of life which has succumbed to modernisation and globalising forces. A tragic event before the last sister arrives, underlines the change. All the actors are excellent, with a mix of British and Australian actors blending nicely. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n19. Dead Heart (1996) (Nick Parsons)\n\nWhen a young Aboriginal man dies mysteriously, the local policeman played by Bryan Brown suspects he has been killed for violating traditional laws, This is an extremely interesting and well-made film about the culture clashes in an Aboriginal desert community, between well-meaning but uncomprehending white administrators and the local Aboriginals trying obey traditional tribal values within a society dominated by white laws. A finely nuanced film which looks at the good and bad in both cultures and in all the characters, and which examines the pressures and difficulties of coexistence. Bryan Brown is excellent in this film. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n20. Vacant Possession (1995) (Margot Nash)\n\nTessa, a 40-something woman, returns from an unsatisfying life as a gambler overseas to claim her share of the modest family house after her mother’s death, but finds the memories flooding in. Pamela Rabe is convincing as Tessa, a woman forced to confront a past she ran away from as a teenager. Tessa is brittle and damaged, but capable of warmth and humour and, as she stays in her mother’s deserted house, she remembers the happy and sad moments of her youth. Filmed in a blueish palate to mirror Tessa’s mood, the film moves slowly from present to past and back again, as Tessa deals with all the hurt she ran away from. Important in the story is Tessa’s relationship with the nearby Aboriginal family, and the continued survival of Sydney Aboriginal community and their relations with the European community is also an important theme of the film. Ultimately this is an optimistic film, with Tessa and her family managing to move on with their lives. Though Margot Nash was nominated for the AFI Best Director award, this was her only feature film. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n21. Waiting (1991) (Jackie McKimmie)\n\nClare is a single woman is waiting to give birth to a surrogate baby at an isolated bush home, surrounded by a group of close friends. They are supposed to support her, but the group have other issues that come up. This is an enjoyable film about a noisy bunch of friends, sometimes supportive and sometimes at odds with each other. It is particularly about the one woman, Clare, played by Noni Hazlehurst, in their midst who is facing her own unique challenges and decisions, which the friends may or may not assist her with. This film catches the sensibilities and sexual politics of the 1980s (and early 90s) nicely. Fiona Press won the AFI Best Supporting Actress Award for this film and McKimmie was nominated for the best director award. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n22. Dead Letter Office (1998) (John Ruane)\n\nAlice is a lonely girl searching for her lost father, who gets a job in the Post Office’s Dead Letter Office where she meets another worker haunted by his refugee past. Miranda Otto provides another winning performance as a sweet introvert in this charming little Oz romance, where characters whose lives are fractured by migration or broken families search for love and stability. The pace of the movie is slow and restrained, like its characters, and may be too slow for some, but if you like Otto’s nervous charm, you’ll love this. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n23. Brilliant Lies (1996) (Richard Franklin)\n\nA young woman, Susy, accuses her supervisor of sexual harassment and wrongful dismissal, but she also has issues with her father, sister and brother to sort out. This is a fast-moving drama with great dialogue (based as it is on a David Williamson play), a smattering of humour and plenty of fireworks, with the feisty Susy (Gia Carides) trying to get $40,000 out of her boss (Anthony La Paglia) for sexual harassment. At the same time she tries to help her more restrained lesbian sister Katy and religious brother Paul, deal with the problem of their drunken father (Ray Barrett) who needs an expensive operation. It’s an interesting and entertaining look at the nuances of sexual harassment in the workplace, as well as the dynamics of dysfunctional families. All the actors are excellent, especially Gia Carides, and veteran director Richard Franklin delivers yet another of his entertaining films. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n24. Holy Smoke (1999) (Jane Campion)\n\nA young woman who joins a cult in India, is tricked into returning to Australia by her family who send her to be ‘deprogrammed’ by an American expert in the isolated Australian outback. Some might find this film too strange, but strange is normal for director Jane Campion who likes to push her characters to their limits. Not everyone liked the mood-shifts in this erotic psycho-drama about power relations in cult-deprogramming, mixed with moments which parody a variant of Ocker culture, but I did. After a strong beginning in India and hilarious attack on suburbia in Sydney’s Sans Souci, the film becomes an emotional tussle between hyper-American deprogrammer, Harvey Keitel, and initially serene Aussie backpacker, Kate Winslett, with bizarre interruptions by Winslett’s average-Aussie, know-nothing family. Kate Winslet is excellent as the headstrong Aussie girl who is more than a match for the American expert. Campion pushes the drama to resolution through total destruction (as usual).

The film tells the story of Lilian’s youth with her overbearing father, her life in the asylum where she shares her obsession with Shakespeare with the other inmates, and her life after her release when, as an old woman, she roams the Sydney streets, declaiming Shakespeare and freaking out passers-by. This film, by Polish-born director Domaradszki and adapted from Kate Grenville’s novel, was based on a real Sydney street-eccentric. It is a touching and occasionally amusing film, propelled by three great actors: Ruth Cracknell as the older Lilian, Toni Collette as the young Lilian and Barry Otto playing first her awful father and later her meek brother with whom she is reunited as an older woman. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n26. Blackrock (1997) (Steven Vidler)\n\nWhen a 15-year-old girl is raped and killed at a teenage party in a small surfer town, everyone at the party falls under suspicion, and one boy must choose between loyalty and a brutal truth. This film looks at teenage culture, particularly the machismo surrounding Australian surf culture, and how ideas of mateship and group-membership allow crimes such as rape, and even murder, to be downplayed and covered up. It’s a searing indictment of this culture by first-time director Steven Vidler and writer Nick Enright, based on an actual event on a Newcastle beach. It’s a tense, heart-wrenching experience as parents and teenagers alike speculate on the crime, and a witness finds himself torn between his mates and the truth. The film has a fine cast, not least of whom is Heath Ledger, confident in his debut film. It’s a well-made and thought-provoking film. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n27. Radiance (1998) (Rachel Perkins)\n\nThree Aboriginal half-sisters come together for their mother’s funeral, and try to deal with their past. This film adapts Louis Nowra’s play, and is a beautiful three-parter, where three long separated sisters come back together to bury their mother, to share hidden secrets, to accuse, to forgive and to celebrate together after so long. This is a warm and engaging debut feature from one of our best Aboriginal directors, Rachel Perkins, and also marked the film debut of Deborah Mailman, who has gone on to become Australia’s most successful and beloved Aboriginal actress. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n28. The Heartbreak Kid (1993) (Michael Jenkins)\n\nA young female high school teacher starts a risky affair with a student. Claudia Karvan and Alex Dimitriades are both wonderful as the young Greek-Australian teacher and student in this believable romance of forbidden love across the classroom divide. The film also looks at multiculturalism in Australia, as the students from ethnic backgrounds rebel against the traditions of the school, and the teacher feels constricted by her parents desire for her to marry a successful Greek man of their choice. There is a gritty reality at the base of this romance, and a convincing cast of students and teachers, which add to the authenticity of this film. The film also skilfully manages to avoid the descent into tragedy that accompanies many such illicit relationships. The success of this film spawned a long-running TV series called Heartbreak High, which has recently been revived. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n29. Doing Time For Patsy Cline (1997) (Chris Kennedy)\n\nRalph, a young singer, heading for Nashville, leaves his farm in outback NSW, and gets a lift with a pretty girl, Patsy, and her dubious boyfriend, Boyd. A very strong cast carries this road movie about an innocent young man, who gets involved with a drug-dealer, because he’s smitten by the drug-dealer’s alluring girl-friend, who happens to be named after one of his favourite American country music singers. Simple as that. Matt Day always seems to play the nice guy who gets into trouble of other people’s making, and so it is here. Miranda Otto is charming, as always, though less awkward than she is in many other films. Richard Roxburgh, in one of his early roles, plays a fast-talking con-man – charming but a rogue at heart. It’s quite a ride for young Ralph who is too love-struck to realise the trouble he’s in. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n30. Return Home (1990) (Ray Argall)\n\nNoel, a divorced man in his late 30s, returns from Melbourne on a visit to his hometown of Adelaide to see his brother Steve and his parents, but finds himself wishing he was returning for good. This is an interesting story about the importance of family and having a place that feels like home. The film revels in the ordinariness of Australian suburbia, with its simple pleasures and reassuringly comfortable relationships. It is this security and groundedness that sustains Steve and his wife and children, even though the family mechanic’s business is going through tough times and barely making money. It is also the security and familiarity that Noel realises that his high-pressure job in Melbourne does not provide. Noel finds himself torn between his secure Melbourne job, and the lure of his hometown where he knows every street and recognises old friends on the street. It’s a well told story with very good naturalistic performances from all the cast, which includes Ben Mendelsohn in one of his first roles, playing Steve’s apprentice mechanic. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n31. True Love and Chaos (1996) (Stavros Kazantzidis)\n\nA young woman Mimi travels from Adelaide to Perth with her boyfriend Hanif and his mate Dean, who is a part-time junkie. Mimi hopes to reconnect with her estranged mother and to find the father she never knew. The two boys are fleeing Dean’s big brother from whom they have stolen some drugs. On the way they pick up an enigmatic older musician. This is a gripping, touching and sometimes funny film with a smart script and a top cast. It’s another celebration of Australian ordinariness, a sweet, somewhat uneven, road movie, in which Mirando Otto as Mimi is at her awkward, luminous best. Like the characters, the film is somewhat directionless, but likeable despite that. Weaving puts in another good performance as the boozy musician, and Ben Mendelsohn has left his young knockabout roles behind and plays a more menacing crim here, something he has since gone on to play in countless Hollywood films. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n32. Phobia (1990) (John Dingwall)\n\nGosia Dobrowolska plays Renata, the migrant wife of the hard-drinking, urbane, chatty professional David, played by TV veteran Sean Scully. She has agoraphobia, and is confined to their suburban house in Sydney’s leafy northern suburbs. She also wants to leave her seemingly nice but controlling husband, but he is unwilling to let her go. This film captures the claustrophobia of a failed relationship, with only two characters confined to their leafy family home and garden over what could be their last 24 hours together. Both are very convincing, Dobrowolska as a sensitive woman trying to escape, but hindered by her fear of the outside world, and Scully as the seemingly understanding, but controlling, man of the house. The past is gradually revealed as both become increasingly desperate to achieve control over their lives. This is a very revealing and satisfying film about the difficult subject of relationships that turn toxic. (See here for more about the film.)\n\n***\n\nI recommend all of these films, and I encourage everyone to leave your comments below, with your thoughts on these and any other Australian films."
