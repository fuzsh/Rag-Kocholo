        "text": "More than ever, the ‘90s are coming to be recognized as one of the most significant decades in American film. It was the decade for rom-coms, action, and of course, horror. Honestly, there's no other horror decade like the '90s—it even has it's own name dubbed, \"prestige horror.\" Huge box office successes at the start of the decade—films like Cape Fear and Silence of the Lambs—legitimized the era, hereby distinguisng it from any other decade. These forces culminated in the massive success of The Sixth Sense by the decade’s end. Simultaneously, the ‘90s also brought a resurgence in Black Horror.\n\nIn her seminal text, , Dr. Robin R. Means Coleman discusses the absence of Black folks from “prestige horror” of the time. So instead of catering to non-inclusive Hollywood, they began their own movies and telling their own stories. Films like Def By Temptation, Daughters of the Dust, Demon Knight, and Tales from the Hood further established the Black Horror tradition in their reimagining of the genre.\n\nEven within what she refers to as \"Blacks in horror films,\" where Black folks are represented in otherwise white productions like Candyman, The People Under the Stairs, Blade, and Vampire in Brooklyn, the Black actors were granted significantly more substantive roles and better representations than had been offered in decades prior, hence why the '90s is known as the best horror film decade. Alexandra West also identifies this period as the decade “horror went mainstream” in her book, .\n\nWith the success of films like Scream and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the decade saw a steady stream of teen dream flicks like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, The Faculty, and Idle Hands, many of which were woman-fronted (props to Hollywood to brining in more diversity). With the genre’s higher production values and wider audiences, it became the breeding ground for the next generation of Hollywood stars.\n\nSo not only was the '90s a revolution of horror, but it's was also one of the first time we saw diverse characters and storylines, thus proving a foundation for films like Get Out or Us. Though, as we know, there's always room for improvement—we're talking about you, Conjuring.\n\nThe films on this particular list don’t necessarily reflect those which generated the most money or the most critical acclaim—as films are an artisitc and subjective perspective, but I consider these to be the films which most challenged the norms and tropes of the genre, and which lean into horror’s radical possibilities—and whose influence we’ll continue to see in the future. In chronological order, here are the 58 best horror movies of the '90s."
