        "text": "You’re looking for a list of the best crime movies of all time. Maybe you want to find action crime films, or crime thrillers, or perhaps even a crime comedy movie or a crime drama. We’ve got you covered.\n\nIn this post, we’ve compiled a list of the best crime movies of all-time, including American crime movies and the top crime films from around the world. All of these movies are worth a watch, so pop some corn, call your lawyer, pour a glass of your favorite pruno, and start the show.\n\nBest Crime Movies of All Time\n\nPreface for our best crime movie list\n\nCrime movies can mean a lot of things, so we’ve decided to leave most courtroom drama, superhero films, and criminals motivated by ideology rather than personal gain. We also rank our list based on how well the movie represents the crime genre over other genres and then take into account the actual quality of the film.\n\nFor instance, Gone Girl and Memento are great films that could fall into the crime genre, but they don’t represent the crime genre, as well as films, focused on a life a crime like films such as Goodfellas and Heat.\n\nNow… less talk. More Crime!\n\nAUSTRALIAN CRIME MOVIES\n\n73. Animal Kingdom (2012)\n\nAnimal Kingdom • Trailer\n\nThis Australian crime film is one of the top crime movies because of it's authenticity as well as the cast. It was so good they’ve since made a television series based on the film.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM\n\nThe film is loosely based on the Melbourne crime scene in the 1980s and the Pettingills crime family. Also, the random revenge murder of two patrolmen recreates the 1988 Walsh Street police shootings.\n\nINDEPENDENT CRIME MOVIES\n\n72. Good Time (2017)\n\nGood Time • Trailer\n\nBefore they put Adam Sandler through the wringer, the Safdie Brothers concocted this \"gem.\" A white-knuckle ride from start to finish and any doubts about Robert Pattinson's acting ability were decidedly vanquished. This is one of the best crime drama movies, and while it is very dramatic it also one of the best crime thrillers out there.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nGOOD TIME\n\nThe scene in the subway was shot during rush hour with real passengers on the 7 train. In order to shoot unnoticed, they directed Pattinson by text messages while the camera and crew was filming in the same wagon.\n\nBEST CRIME DRAMA MOVIES\n\n71. The Place Beyond the Pines (2012)\n\nThe Place Beyond the Pines • Trailer\n\nThis film is one of the best crime movies because it brings many new ideas to a crime genre. It works well as a crime thriller, crime drama, and crime action movie at various points.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES\n\nThe method Luke (Ryan Gosling) and Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) use to rob the banks was the actual method \"Friday Night Robber\" Carl Gugasian successfully used for over thirty years.\n\nBEST AMERICAN CRIME MOVIES\n\n70. Lawless (2012)\n\nLawless • Trailer\n\nGreat crime movies often use authentic stories that help bring you into a specific world of crime, and that’s what this film does so well.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nLAWLESS\n\nThe Russian title of this film translates as \"The Drunkest County in the World\".\n\nBEST ACTION COMEDY MOVIES\n\n69. Last Man Standing (1996)\n\nLast Man Standing • Trailer\n\nThis is one of the best crime movies that is both haunting and unique. It’s a great crime movie that combines two worlds of crime that aren’t commonly explored in a single story.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nLAST MAN STANDING\n\nWalter Hill considered this a \"free adaptation\" of Yojimbo (1961) rather than a remake, calling the idea of remaking Akira Kurosawa's film \"a foolish endeavor.\"\n\nBEST COMEDY CRIME MOVIES\n\n68. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang • Trailer\n\nThis is one of the best dark comedy movies and one of the top crime movies in general. Shane Black has gone on to make more in the future, but there was something about this film that was the best.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nKISS KISS BANG BANG\n\nShane Black had been suffering from writer's block. It ultimately took him over a year and a half to write the script for this film. He then had enormous trouble trying to sell it.\n\nBEST CRIME DRAMA MOVIES\n\n67. Drive (2011)\n\nDrive • Trailer\n\nThis is a really strong crime drama movie, and one of the only really well made crime romance films. There are some great uses of color and definitely one of the best soundtracks in crime genre, but this is a great date night crime movie as well.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nDRIVE\n\nAfter Ryan Gosling and Nicolas Winding Refn removed much of the Driver's dialogue, Bryan Cranston felt that his character, Shannon, should make up for the lack of talking in the film, and thus made Shannon a motormouth. Much of his dialogue is improvised.\n\nBEST CRIME DRAMA MOVIE\n\n66. The Town (2010)\n\nThe Town • Trailer\n\nThis crime thriller takes some great cues from the best crime movies including Heat and The Departed. Ben Affleck shows off his directorial prowess with a really good American crime movie.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nDRIVE\n\nBen Affleck cited The Departed (2006), Heat (1995), Mystic River (2003), and The Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973) as influences on this film. Of them, Affleck said \"All are R-rated movies in that same vein, and the movies I used as the gold standard of success here.\"\n\nBEST CRIME MOVIES\n\n65. The Score (2001)\n\nThe Score • Trailer\n\nThis really is a great crime film and a fun crime thriller where you don’t know who will come out on top. If you’ve never seen this crime film, you should give it a watch as soon as possible.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE SCORE\n\nThis is the only movie to star Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando, the first actors to win Academy Awards for playing the same role, that of Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974).\n\nTOP CRIME MOVIES\n\n64. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)\n\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels • Trailer\n\nThis very much is more of a great crime comedy movie as opposed to anything else, but definitely lead to many great action crime movies.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nLOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS\n\nThe film was having trouble finding an American distributor when Trudie Styler called an acquaintance of hers - Tom Cruise. He attended a screening and loved the film. Matthew Vaughn later recalled, \"It was hysterical. You had all these mid-level executives sitting there, and Cruise walked in. He saw them all sit up and pay attention, all getting on their phones, and suddenly all these senior executives joined the screening ... At the end, Tom got up in front of everyone and said 'This is the best movie I've seen in years, you guys would be fools not to buy it.'\"\n\nBRITISH CRIME MOVIES\n\n63. Layer Cake (2004)\n\nLayer Cake • Trailer\n\nThis is one of the top crime movies many crime genre fans didn’t see. It’s also the film that launched both Daniel Craig’s and Tom Hardy’s careers, as well as directing career for Matthew Vaughn.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nLAYER CAKE\n\nIt was Daniel Craig's performance in this film that caused Barbara Broccoli to take notice and think he might be a good fit for James Bond.\n\nBEST CRIME COMEDY MOVIES\n\n62. American Hustle (2013)\n\nAmerican Hustle • Trailer\n\nWhile this is one of the best crime movies out there, it is very different from many of the other crime films on this list. No big shootouts or classic organized crime, but still plenty of good crime to watch.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nAMERICAN HUSTLE\n\nAccording to Christian Bale, much of the movie was improvised. So during the shooting of the film, he noted to writer and director David O. Russell, \"You realize that this is going to change the plot greatly down track.\" To which Russell replied, \"Christian, I hate plots. I am all about characters, that's it.\"\n\nCRIME THRILLER MOVIES\n\n61. Killing them Softly (2012)\n\nKilling them Softly • Trailer\n\nThis is one of the top crime movies because, similar to many other Andrew Dominik films, is a tone poem that’s trying to talk about the themes of crime and criminals with a classic plot.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nKILLING THEM SOFTLY\n\nThe first feature film to use Kodak's 500T 5230 film stock.\n\nGOOD CRIME MOVIES\n\n60. The Fast and the Furious (2001)\n\nThe Fast and the Furious • Trailer\n\nWhile this has become one of the biggest blockbuster franchises of all time, this began with a really great action crime movie.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE FAST AND THE FURIOUS\n\nThere are over 15,000 individual sound effects in the first street race.\n\nACTION CRIME MOVIES\n\n59. Point Break (1991)\n\nPoint Break • Trailer\n\nAs you may have guessed, this crime movie inspired The Fast and the Furious, and it is one of the best action crime movies.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nPOINT BREAK\n\nThis was Kathryn Bigelow's highest grossing film until Zero Dark Thirty (2012).\n\nCLASSIC CRIME MOVIES\n\n58. Mean Streets (1973)\n\nMean Street • Trailer\n\nBefore you had every other great Scorsese crime movie, you had this film. Many modern crime movies have this film to thank.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nMEAN STREETS\n\nBrian De Palma helped Martin Scorsese edit some scenes in this movie.\n\nBEST COMEDY CRIME MOVIES\n\n57. In Bruges (2008)\n\nIn Bruges • Trailer\n\nThis really is more of a crime drama movies but it is also a really strong crime comedy movie. Definitely worth a watch.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nIN BRUGES\n\nThe painting that occasions comment even from Ray is \"The Last Judgment\" by Hieronymus Bosch. Bosch-like symbolism recurs throughout the movie (the dwarf is one example), suggesting that Ray and Ken may indeed encounter their own Last Judgment - or that the waiting period in Bruges is akin to purgatory.\n\nBEST CRIME MOVIES\n\n56. Easy Rider (1969)\n\nEasy Rider • Trailer\n\nThis film has one of the most appropriate titles ever made because this crime film doesn’t play by hard a fast filmmaking rules, and has changed the way we look at filmmaking in general.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nIN BRUGES\n\nDennis Hopper and Peter Fonda did not write a full script for the movie, and made most of it up as they went along. They didn't hire a crew, but instead picked up hippies at communes across the country, and used friends and passers-by to hold the cameras, and were drunk and stoned most of the time.\n\nBEST CRIME MOVIES\n\n55. New Jack City (1991)\n\nNew Jack City • Trailer\n\nThis is one of the best crime drama movies ever made and it’s very similar to Scarface in how it feels like a criminal telling of Icarus. It shows the rise of a man who just won’t stop rising until his wings melt.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nNEW JACK SITY\n\nThe chase between Scotty and Pookie was improvised. The original idea was for the chase to be a car chase, but the movie had gone over budget and was in danger of being shut down. Chris Rock, instead, hopped on a bicycle, and Ice-T chased him on foot.\n\nBEST DRUG CRIME MOVIES\n\n54. A Scanner Darkly (2006)\n\nA Scanner Darkly • Trailer\n\nThis is one of the best crime movies of all time because it takes a unique approach not only to the filmmaking but also the story.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nNEW JACK SITY\n\nAccording to Writer and Director Richard Linklater, filming was completed in twenty-three days.

The Thomas Crown Affair (1999)\n\nThe Thomas Crown Affair • Trailer\n\nBeyond being one of the greatest crime films of all time is how this is slick and sexy and fun. It also works as a really strong crime thriller, and the tonal shifts in the film are really natural and seamless.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR\n\nThe idea of unusual heat in the museum rendering thermal cameras useless, came from Director John McTiernan's Predator (1987). In that movie, McTiernan's thermal cameras began to fail, when the jungle temperature broke ninety degrees Fahrenheit (thirty-two degrees Celsius).\n\nBEST CRIME DRAMA MOVIES\n\n51. Traffic (2000)\n\nTraffic • Trailer\n\nTraffic is a very unique crime movie because it takes a look at crime in a three different storylines during the same time period. This is one of the best crime films ever made because it is painfully real.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTRAFFIC\n\nDirector Steven Soderbergh is known as being first camera on many of his films, as a result, he was operating the camera for most of the shooting.\n\nBEST DRAMA CRIME MOVIES\n\n50. Donnie Brasco (1997)\n\nDonnie Brasco • Trailer\n\nAs far as crime films go, this is one of the most authentic you’ll ever watch.

Matchstick Men (2003)\n\nMatchstick Men • Trailer\n\nThis is one of those crime movies that doesn’t have guns and heists, but it’s still one of the best crime movies ever made and one of the only comedy crime movies made by Ridley Scott.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nMATCHSTICK MEN\n\nThe airport scenes, set at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), were actually filmed in the main entrance of the Anaheim Convention Center, a mile south of Disneyland.\n\nBEST CRIME MOVIES\n\n48. Eastern Promises (2007)\n\nEastern Promises • Trailer\n\nThis is easily one of the best crime drama movies ever made, and it's one of the great examples on how to shoot a thrilling movie fights.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nEASTERN PROMISES\n\nFor the bathhouse fight scene, the scene was choreographed with the actors instead of stuntmen. The actors had to train in specific fighting styles chosen for their characters and it took two days to shoot on location in London.\n\nTRUE CRIME MOVIES\n\n47. Blow (2001)\n\nBlow • Trailer\n\nThis is a crime movie that really takes you inside the inner workings of drug trafficking and the life of a man who lived a life of crime.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nBLOW\n\nAccording to the director's commentary, the tape that George Jung leaves for his father near the end of the movie is a verbatim transcript of a tape that the real George Jung recorded under similar circumstances.\n\nTOP CRIME MOVIES\n\n46. Jackie Brown (1997)\n\nJackie Brown • Trailer\n\nIt’s true that Quentin Tarantino makes some of the best crime movies out there and this crime film is no exception.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nJACKIE BROWN\n\nWhen Pam Grier walked in to audition for Quentin Tarantino, \"there were all my posters from twenty years ago, when I was just a piss and vinegar kid\", she recalled. \"And I said, 'Did you put these up because I was coming over?'

Catch Me If You Can (2002)\n\nCatch Me If You Can • Trailer\n\nThis is one of those crime comedy movies that is just plain fun to watch and it's one of Spielberg's best movies and, frankly, quite underrated.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nCATCH ME IF YOU CAN\n\nThe film shows Frank Abagnale, Jr. on the FBI's Most Wanted list. In real life, however, he never made the list - it's reserved for violent criminals.\n\nBEST CRIME MOVIES\n\n44. True Romance (1993)\n\nTrue Romance • Trailer\n\nThis is one of those great crime movies that was written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by the legendary Tony Scott.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTRUE ROMANCE\n\nThe motel room fight scene between Alabama (Patricia Arquette) and Virgil (James Gandolfini) took five days to shoot.\n\nACTION CRIME MOVIES\n\n43.

Menace II Society (1993)\n\nMenace II Society • Trailer\n\nAs far as American crime movies go, this film is one of the most authentic, partly due to the lack of conventional star power.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nMENACE II SOCIETY\n\nTupac Shakur was originally cast to play Sharif, but was fired which led to a physical fight with co-Director Allen Hughes. Shakur was charged with assault and battery.\n\nOSCAR WINNING CRIME MOVIES\n\n41.

Road to Perdition (2002)\n\nRoad to Perdition • Trailer\n\nAs far as crime drama movies go, this is one of those crime films that shows the connection between family and a life of crime.

The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street • Trailer\n\nSome of the best crime movies of all time are centered around white collar crime, which is just as damaging to law abiding folk.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE WOLF OF WALL STREET\n\nMartin Scorsese has confirmed that some of the editing is odd on purpose, especially the scenes where one or more characters are high, every time Jordan is seen taking drugs the scenes that follow have continuity issues and often flow oddly.\n\nEUROPEAN CRIME MOVIES\n\n35. Ronin(1998)\n\nRonin • Trailer\n\nAction crime movies require a few things to be really great, and this film has one of the best examples on how to shoot an exciting car chase.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nRONIN\n\nSkipp Sudduth requested to do his own stunt driving during the car chases, and John Frankenheimer agreed.

Taxi Driver (1976)\n\nTaxi Driver Scene Breakdown • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nThis is easily one of the best crime drama movies ever made, and instead of focusing on crime as a plot device is is explored through a character’s relationship with crime and perceived justice.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTAXI DRIVER\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese claims that the most important shot in the movie is when Bickle is on the phone trying to get another date with Betsy. The camera moves to the side slowly and pans down the long, empty hallway next to Bickle, as if to suggest that the phone conversation is too painful and pathetic to bear.\n\nBEST CRIME FILMS\n\n29.

It’s just one of the best crime movies of all time.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nFARGO\n\nWilliam H. Macy stated in an interview that, despite evidence to the contrary, he did hardly any ad-libbing at all.

Touch of Evil (1958)\n\nTouch of Evil • Trailer\n\nThis crime film is from Orson Welles and it serves as one of the best crime thriller movies and an origin of the suspenseful long take.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTOUCH OF EVIL\n\nOrson Welles said that this was the most fun he'd ever had filming a picture, unlike most of his Hollywood films, because he wasn't troubled by studio interference (until after he completed the picture, anyway).\n\nBEST CRIME THRILLER MOVIES\n\n21. The Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nThe Maltese Falcon • Trailer\n\nIf you want to see how many of the best crime thriller movies were made you need to start at the early parts, and that means this crime film.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nMALTESE FALCONS\n\nTwo \"Maltese Falcons\" were used because Humphrey Bogart accidentally dropped the original during shooting.

Carlito’s Way (1993)\n\nCarlito's Way • Trailer\n\nThis Brain De Palma film is one of the best crime drama movies ever made and it shows a criminal who wants to redeem himself.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nCARLITO'S WAY\n\nThe exterior of the hospital where Carlito visits his bedridden attorney is the same one where Vito Corleone is taken in The Godfather (1972), also starring Al Pacino.\n\nAMERICAN CRIME THRILLER MOVIES\n\n14. Training Day (2001)\n\nTraining Day • Trailer\n\nThis is one of the best crime thriller movies ever made and it shows how the lines of crime and crime fighter are often blurred.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTRAINING DAY\n\nThe license plate on Alonzo's car is \"ORP 967\" obviously a nod to Officer Rafael Perez, the disgraced L.A.P.D. officer who was born in 1967, and on whom the character was based.\n\nFOREIGN CRIME FILMS\n\n13. City of God (2002)\n\nCity of God • Trailer\n\nIf you’ve never seen this film you should as soon as possible because it’s one of the most authentic and one of the best crime movies of all time.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nCITY OF GOD\n\nAll the amateur actors were recruited from \"favelas\" (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, and a couple of them--Buscapé/Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), for example--actually lived in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) itself.\n\nOSCAR WINNING CRIME FILMS\n\n12. The Departed (2006)\n\nThe Departed • Trailer\n\nThis is not only one of Jack Nicholson's best performances, but the only film that has resulted in Martin Scorsese winning best picture.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE DEPARTED\n\nWhen receiving the top award from the Director's Guild of America for this film, Martin Scorsese said that this \"is the first movie I have ever done with a plot.\"\n\nOSCAR WINNING CRIME THRILLER\n\n11. No Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nNo Country for Old Men • Trailer\n\nAs far as crime thriller movies go, there are few as suspenseful as this movie. Featuring one of the best antagonists of all time, the film is also one of the best Coen Brothers movies.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN\n\nThe case that held the money in this film was the same case that was also used for the same purpose in Fargo (1996).\n\nGREAT CRIME FILMS\n\n10.The Killing (1956)\n\nThe Killing • Trailer\n\nThis is one of Kubrick's best movies and definitely laid the groundwork for countless crime movies afterword. The non-linear structure is just as revolutionary as anything you've seen — and The Killing pulled it off decades ago.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE KILLING\n\nInitial test screenings were poor, citing the non-linear structure as the main problem. Stanley Kubrick was forced to go back and edit the film in a linear fashion, actually making the film even more confusing. In the end, it was released in its original form, and is often cited as being a huge influence on other non-linear films like Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994).\n\nTRUE CRIME DRAMA\n\n9. Casino(1995)\n\nCasino • Trailer\n\nThis is definitely one of the top Martin Scorsese movies of all time, and many feel this is a better crime film than Goodfellas.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nCASINO\n\nThe costume budget for the film was $1 million. Robert De Niro had seventy different costumes throughout the film, Sharon Stone had forty. Both were allowed to keep their costumes afterwards.\n\nBEST AMERICAN CRIME MOVIES\n\n8. Once Upon a Time in America (1984)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood • Trailer\n\nOf course, this is one of the best American crime movies even though the entire film was made with an Italian crew and an Italian director.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA\n\nThe street view of Manhattan Bridge (as seen in the film's poster) can be seen from Washington Street, Brooklyn, New York.\n\nOSCAR WINNING CRIME FILMS\n\n7. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\nPulp Fiction • Trailer\n\nAs Quentin Tarantino has said himself, he wanted to take all of the classic crime tropes from his favorite films and combine them together in a way that was visually and narratively interesting.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nPULP FICTION\n\nChronologically, the last scene in the movie is Butch and Fabienne riding away on a chopper. The first sound you can hear in the movie is of the same chopper's engine.\n\nBEST CRIME FILMS OF ALL TIME\n\n6. Scarface(1983)\n\nScarface • Trailer\n\nScarface is one of those crime drama movies that you can’t get out of your head once you’ve seen it. All of your criminal adjacent friends and acquaintances have Scarface posters on their wall with the best anti-hero on it — Tony Montana.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nSCARFACE\n\nTony Montana uses \"yeyo\" as slang for cocaine. Al Pacino learned the word while learning the Cuban accent, and ad-libbed it during the chainsaw scene. Brian De Palma liked it enough to keep using it throughout the film.\n\nGREAT CRIME FILMS\n\n5. L.A. Confidential (1997)\n\nL.A. Confidential • Trailer\n\nAs far as crime thriller movies go, this is the best ever made. It’s not a good crime film, it’s a perfect crime film and great crime thriller.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nL.A. CONFIDENTIAL\n\nRussell Crowe based his performance on that of Sterling Hayden in Stanley Kubrick's The Killing (1956) \"for that beefy manliness that came out of World War II\".\n\nBEST CRIME DRAMAS\n\n4. The Godfather: Part II (1974)\n\nThe Godfather: Part II • Trailer\n\nMany believe this crime film is actually better than its predecessor, but regardless of where you place this film it is undeniably one of the top crime films ever made.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE GODFATHER PART II\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola had a horrible time directing The Godfather (1972) and asked to pick a different director for the sequel, while taking the title of producer for himself. He chose Martin Scorsese, who the film executives rejected. Thus, Coppola agreed to direct the film, with a few conditions.\n\nORGANIZED CRIME DRAMAS\n\n3. Goodfellas(1990)\n\nGoodfellas • Trailer\n\nThis may be the most important crime film ever to be made, because the criminals in this film are highly unlikeable. While the movie humanizes gangsters, it also shows them for who they really are.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nGOODFELLAS\n\nAccording to Henry Hill, whose life was the basis for the book and film, Joe Pesci's portrayal of Tommy DeSimone was 90-99% accurate, with one notable exception. The real Tommy DeSimone was massively built.\n\nBEST CRIME MOVIES\n\n2. Heat(1995)\n\nHeat • Trailer\n\nWhile many great crime movies take place in America, this is the ultimate modern American crime movie. It’s one of the greatest action crime movies which includes the greatest heist scene of all time and one of Robert De Niro best performances.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nHEAT\n\nRather than dubbing in the gunshots during the bank robbery shoot-out, Michael Mann had microphones carefully placed around the set so that the audio could be captured live. This added to the impact of the scene, because it sounded like no other gunfight shown on-screen.\n\nBEST CRIME MOVIE OF ALL TIME\n\n1. The Godfather (1972)\n\nThe Godfather • Trailer\n\nThe Godfather is the best crime movie of all time as well as the front runner for the greatest overall film of all time. It’s safe to say that it’s The Godfather of American crime films and crime dramas.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTHE GODFATHER\n\nDon Vito Corleone's distinctive voice was based on real-life mobster Frank Costello. Marlon Brando had seen him on television during the Estes Kefauver hearings in 1951, and imitated his husky whisper in the film.\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Best Movie Shootouts\n\nLet us know which are the best crime movies of all time in the comments, and then check out our other posts on films and filmmaking.
