One industry that still thrived was the movie industry, and Hollywood produced some all time classic movies during this time period.

John Wayne was popular in the 1940s and was already filming a number of westerns, before reaching a staggering 83 westerns before his death!

The 1940s was also the beginning of what is known as the "Golden Age of Westerns" which was the decades of the 1940s-1960s.

Prominent directors like John Ford and actors like John Wayne created western classics that popularized and defined the genre.

Fun fact!

The popularity of westerns films in the 1930s and 1940s influenced mainstream culture to start adopting jeans.

Before the 1930s, these denim pants were limited to workers that needed the hardy pants to do their job, like ranchers and farmers.
