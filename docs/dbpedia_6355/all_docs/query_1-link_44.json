        "text": "Now let’s rewind for a second here. The 1920s had just followed the Flu Pandemic of the 1910s, so people were getting dressed in their Sunday best almost everyday to party and have a good ole time, but the decade concluded with the start of The Great Depression.\n\nBut at some point, things do begin to take a turn for the better, and that’s where we’re at right now with the 1940s, with the exception of World War II of course (when it rains it pours).\n\nSome the trends we saw where: A-line skirts, square shoulder jackets, and high waisted pants and tops that was made in acceptable for women in part by Katharine Hepburn (remember we told you to keep an eye for her at the end of the 1930s article), who refused to conform to standards of what a woman “should look and dress like”\n\nHowever, the biggest change in men’s fashion was, believe it or not, comfort. After years and years of wearing suits pretty much 24/7, the guys wanted to wear outfits that were more comfortable when the occasion called for it.\n\nSo now we’re in the 40s. The silent era is pretty much no more, and there are major technological advances being made in the film world to provide even more entertainment value to audiences. World War II meant that there were a lot of military/patriotic films being made, which was a departure from the 1930s where people wanted absolutely no reminder of The Great Depression whatsoever, but the goal was still to provide escapism.\n\nHollywood was slowly becoming even more dominant with the rise of Katharine Hepburn, Lauren Bacall, Gene Tierney, and Rita Hayworth to name a few on the women’s side, and Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, and Vincent Price on the men’s side. We would even see the introduction of a very young Elizabeth Taylor, who we would become much more familiar with in the decades to come. Many of Hollywood’s most classic films would be released during the 1940s, and like the previous two articles in this series, we have a list of seven to get you started."
