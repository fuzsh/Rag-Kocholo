        "text": "How does a society define pure evil? From religious and non-religious filmmakers alike, The Devil has been a permanent mainstay throughout cinema history. Watching these films gives you a chance to see what evils in particular the filmmakers choose to single out as particularly vile. I think you can learn a lot of history by the way directors and writers choose to portray The Devil. Let’s take a look at The Devil through the Decades.\n\nI’ll be dividing this series into multiple parts, starting with early silent films and working all the way through to the present day. Obviously, I’ll mainly be focusing on horror films, but The Devil has crossed over into some other genres as well. I’m going to mostly be skipping comedies, because I want to look at more serious and non-parodic portrayals (And also there are a lot of comedies).\n\nThe Devil has been a major player in the movies since the beginning. Director Georges Méliès played The Devil many times over in his turn-of-the-century short films, and 1911 saw the first adaptation of Dante’s Divine Comedy with the Italian film L’Inferno. However, I want to look at two prominent silent films, both of which depict The Devil, and both of which had major influence on future cinema.\n\nFirst is a peculiar 1922 (but filmed in 1920) Scandinavian film called Häxan, which translates to The Witch, but was shown in America as Witchcraft through the Ages. Part documentary, part horror film, and part social commentary, Häxan is interesting in that it has a very clear message—the assumptions about witchcraft made in books such as the Malleus Maleficarum and at the Salem Witch Trials are undeniably wrong. However, the film still gets away with showing all kinds of horrifying (and even exploitative for the time) imagery by basically saying “We’re showing you what these people believed.”\n\nLike with the films of Georges Méliès, the director himself (Benjamin Christensen) plays The Devil.\n\nWhether the directors felt they would be insulting an actor by telling them they’d make a great Satan, or they just wanted the hammiest role for themselves is up to you. As you can see, it’s a pretty literal “cloven hooves and pointed tail” Devil that would be mocked by future Devils of cinema, but again, it’s going from the perspective of what people believed, so it fits. There are some particularly intense scenes, including a Witches Sabbath which includes witches literally kissing Satan’s rear end. Yeah.\n\nHowever, other images are more iconic and less exploitative. This scene where the witches fly through the night air to their ritual would inspire a classic scene in another film that I’ll get to shortly.\n\nUltimately, the social commentary of Häxan ends up being very dated, because it basically says that what used to be called witchcraft would now be treated in a mental institution. While this is well-meaning, and in some cases accurate, it doesn’t really touch on the fact that a lot of witchcraft accusations came out of misogyny, pure spite, or even land disputes.\n\nWhile Häxan is a meaningful and intriguing piece of film history, there is another film from the end of the silent era that speaks more to how a society portrays evil incarnate. That film is F.W. Murnau’s 1926 adaptation of Faust. The Faust story is the most famous Deal-With-The-Devil story and is essentially the one that all others spring from. It dates at least as far back as the 16th century, with the first famous adaptation of the legend being Christopher Marlowe’s 1604 play The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus. Marlowe’s play is full of protestant vs. Catholic religious commentary, apt to the time, and portrays Faustus as an academic who sells his soul for selfish reasons. Marlowe’s Faustus ultimately squanders his 24 years of good fortune and is taken to Hell in the end. Instead, it was the Faust play written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that was the inspiration for Murnau’s film.\n\nGoethe’s play frames the story of Faust’s diabolical bargain as a wager in Heaven between God and Mephistopheles (Mephistophilis in one version of Marlowe’s play, Mephisto in Murnau’s film). In Goethe’s play, Mephistopheles may not technically be Satan himself, but he serves the same purpose in the story. The wager at the beginning calls back to the Book of Job, where Satan challenges God that he can corrupt a good and righteous man. It was this more sympathetic and God-favored Faust that inspired Murnau’s film. In Murnau’s film, Mephisto can easily be seen as The Devil as he is not acknowledged as being in service to anybody.\n\nMurnau’s film begins with a similar bet in Heaven where Mephisto and an archangel make a wager as to whether Faust can be corrupted, and the prize is control of the entire earth. I have joked in the past that this is a totally ridiculous wager, and it is, but I think it’s supposed to echo the sentiment of “If you can corrupt this man’s soul, nothing is holy anyway.” Determined to win control of the earth, Mephisto descends upon the town where Faust lives and curses it with a plague.\n\nUnlike other versions where Faust is merely tempted by intellectual curiosity, here Mephisto goes as far as to infect the whole town with a deadly disease just to make the caring Faust sell his soul to help them. It’s no surprise that a 1926 Devil would be a plague bearer, as the world had just gotten past the 1918 flu pandemic. This is similar to the change that Murnau made to the Dracula-equivalent Count Orlok in Nosferatu four years earlier. Would a good man sell his soul to cure a whole village? How about the whole world?\n\nThere’s a great moment when The Devil first appears to Faust, where Faust tries to banish him but looks out the window and sees the endless funeral procession.\n\nLike Ellen in Nosferatu, he believes he is the only one who can stop the plague and is willing to sacrifice himself. However, he’s smart and says he wishes he had the power for just one day, so Mephisto offers a trial run. That’s one thing I love about this version—Faust and Mephisto are basically playing chess back and forth.\n\nUnlike other stories where Satan has the upper hand the whole time, here they both know the stakes full well.\n\nHowever, Faust is almost immediately condemned as a heretic for shying away at the sight of a cross, and the townspeople try to stone him. He runs home and tries to kill himself, but Mephisto insists he has to let the 24 hours run out. Instead, he tempts Faust with youth and insists he has never really lived. It’s clear that this was his goal all along, to get a good man to his ultimate breaking point and make him indulge in some pleasures. Faust is transformed into a silent movie heartthrob, and Mephisto is transformed into a more stereotypical-looking Devil, completely with cape and widow’s peak.\n\nBetween the enormous winged angel at the beginning and the old beggar man, this is his third transformation in just 30 minutes. Geesh Satan, you’ve got more costume changes than Madonna. I know he’s more open to express how evil he is now, but I don’t know, I found the old beggar man creepier. Maybe Murnau wasn’t counting on high-definition.\n\nMephisto takes Faust to the wedding of the most beautiful woman in Italy, and makes the bride fall in love with him instead. While she and Faust run off, Mephisto kills the groom, and everyone else disperses.\n\nHowever, in another brilliant chess move, the 24-hour-trial period runs out right as Faust and his new bride are about to consummate their marriage. Mephisto inflicts Faust with a serious case of erectile damnation and says he can only continue on as a young man if he sells his soul for good. Of course he quickly agrees and runs back to the bedroom while Mephisto looks on (He’s The Devil, of course he does) before closing the curtains.\n\nHowever, by the next scene, Faust is moody and bored like he’s an Emo music video from the early 2000s.\n\nMephisto offers him a woman, a card game, or an orgy, but none pique his interest like they used to… last scene. Also, I’m not sure why he needs Satan’s help to get into a card game, but maybe it’s one of those high stakes games where it’s all about who you know. In a way, it’s quite interesting that the film just skips right over all the debauchery Faust gets up to. Perhaps it’s censorship, but considering what happened in the last scene, I don’t think that’s what Murnau is going for. The life of pleasure in this kind of story is implied, and we got what we needed to see in the wedding scene. Murnau is far more interested in what makes Faust a good person, not the evil he does when given a chance.\n\nThe rest of the film is basically just Faust trying to win the love of one woman named Gretchen (Camilla Horn), and The Devil being a trickster. Things look bad for Gretchen when she is about to be burned at the stake for having an illegitimate child, but Faust (an old man again) throws himself on the pyre out of love. She recognizes him, love wins, and their souls are saved. It’s a bit of a cliched ending, sure, but it takes us out on an emotional high, despite the downer nature of the story.\n\nWhile Universal did touch on religious themes in previous films (Bride of Frankenstein in particular), The Black Cat is the first one to feature it as a major plot point. The film was the first to put the two Universal horror stars Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff in the same film, and that was the real draw to audiences at the time.\n\nKarloff plays Hjalmar Poelzig, a Satanist priest whom Dr. Vitus Werdegast (Lugosi) has a long-standing rivalry with. In the past, Poelzig murdered Werdesgast’s wife, and to add insult to injury, is now married to his daughter. A couple of very unlucky travelers (David Manners, Julie Bishop) are stuck at Poelzig’s mansion for a while, where he intends for Julie Bishop’s character to be a human sacrifice.\n\nThe Black Cat is the first major “talkie” where Devil worship is a plot point, but unfortunately it is only a plot point. The story could play out pretty much the same if Poelzig was, say, a serial killer. He wants the woman dead, Werdegast tries to keep her alive. We see a brief scene of the “Satanic” service which is literally just some gibberish Latin.\n\nAccording to IMDB, the Latin incantations translate to phrases like “with a grain of salt” and “heavy thunder.” It’s so strange that a movie like this came out more than a decade after Häxan, which at least tried to present an intellectual perspective. The Black Cat is one of the earliest film examples of the trope that a satanic ritual is just some bastardization of the Catholic mass. Sometimes the service will be done backwards, with certain sexual acts, elements that parody the mass, and often human sacrifice. It goes without saying that there’s no real truth in this, and it feels more like fearful Christians just kind of guessing what a service would be like.\n\nPoelzig was allegedly based on Aleister Crowley, in that Poelzig is a Devil worshipper and Crowley was accused of being one… and that’s about it. Poelzig reads a book called The Rites of Lucifer, which I suppose is meant to be his Bible, but it comes across more like he’s studying for a big exam the next day something.\n\nWhat is it, his first service? This is like the instruction manual.\n\nMake sure to wear a robe.\n\nSay Latin-y things.\n\nWe worship Satan, not Santa. Don’t mix up the two.\n\nScowl.\n\nThe real horror in The Black Cat isn’t the occult ritual, but rather the extreme lengths to which these two men will go to defeat the other. This is after all the film that ends with one character skinning the other alive. I mean, sure, it’s off screen, but we hear the sounds and the screams! This was 1934! It’s an utterly ridiculous film that has nothing to do with the Poe story it’s named after, but Karloff is just such a despicably evil villain, right down to the clothes, hair, and voice, that it’s an enjoyable watch nonetheless.\n\nInterestingly enough, the next iconic portrayal of The Devil came from a somewhat unlikely source—Disney. It’s not like Disney hadn’t portrayed The Devil before, as the 1929 Silly Symphonies short “Hell’s Bells” is set in Hell, but it’s entirely comedic. In Fantasia in 1940, Disney went all out with its portrayal of a menacing, hulking Devil. He’s called Chernabog by official materials, but Deems Taylor introduces the segement by calling him Satan, and it’s the sounds of “Ave Maria” that stop him.\n\nThe Night on Bald Mountain segment of the film features shout-outs to both Faust, in the way The Devil darkens and overpowers the small village…\n\nAnd Häxan, when the spirits are traveling from their graves to Bald Mountain.\n\nIf you want to bring The Black Cat into it as well, Bela Lugosi was the original model for Chernabog, but the design was ultimately rejected. The early Disney films were very into the idea of needing the darkness to fully appreciate the light, and this is the best example, as the “Ave Maria” washes away the darkness of night and brings on the morning. It portrays evil as powerful in its own domain, but easily defeated when good teams together, a message that the world needed in 1940.\n\nAlthough Satanic horror wasn’t all that common in the ’30s and ’40s, 1941 did bring us one of the most iconic and influential portrayals of The Devil to ever hit the big screen, and one of my personal favorites—The Devil and Daniel Webster. Based on the short story by Steven Vincent Benét, the film was understandably a bit overshadowed by RKO Pictures’ other big release that year, a little film called Citizen Kane. That said, the film still managed to win Best Original Score for Bernard Hermann’s rousing Americana score, and Walter Huston got a much-deserved Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of Mr. Scratch, a common name for The Devil in New England in the early 19th century.\n\nSet in New Hampshire in the 1840s, the film tells the story of Jabez Stone (James Craig), a down-on-his-luck farmer who fills the Faust role when he sells his soul to The Devil for seven years of good luck (It was 24 in Germany. Those inflation rates will get you every time.) The old legend goes that you meet The Devil at a crossroads to sell your soul (Faust did it in Murnau’s film), but there’s a clever spin on that here in that Jabez lives in Cross Corners, New Hampshire.\n\nJabez owes his mortgage to the local loan shark Miser Stephens (John Qualen), but just as he is about to take a bag of seed and a calf down to him as alternative payment, his wife Mary (Anne Shirley) is injured, he spills the bag of seed, and his calf runs off. It’s this perfect storm of events that brings Jabez to his breaking point, and it can easily be interpreted as The Devil setting them off to bring him there. I just love Huston’s entrance in the film. Jabez screams to the wind he’d sell his soul to The Devil for “about two cents,” two gold coins appear in his hand, and in walks The Devil himself.\n\nWalter Huston’s Mr. Scratch is sly and conniving, a huckster and conman who contrasts the honest and God-fearing men of the area. He gets Jabez to sign away his soul based on the only honor the man has left—his word. He said he’d sell his soul to The Devil, and even if it was just a spur-of-the-moment expression, he’s not taking his word back.\n\nThe Devil and Daniel Webster may take place in the 1840s, but it reflects the 1941 world it was created in. A group of farmers led by Tom Sharpe (Jeff Corey) wants Jabez to join a grange, an organization made up of farmers who will work together to protect each other, a proto-union of sorts.\n\nThese men visit Jabez in one of the first scenes of the film, and they come back right as Jabez is meeting with The Devil, so of course he shoos them away. Jabez could have tried to work together with his fellow man, but he instead chooses to get rich alone and leave them out to dry. Like in the Depression era, everyone is struggling, and greedy men are only looking out for themselves. When Jabez Stone goes to pay Miser Stephens with the gold Mr. Scratch has helped him discover under his barn, Stephens discovers it’s the same gold he has, showing that he too is in The Devil’s debt.\n\nAt first, Jabez seems to be a man of the people, making a speech and earning the respect of Daniel Webster (Edward Arnold), but greed inevitably gets the better of him. When a hailstorm destroys every farmer’s crops except Jabez’s, he hires his fellow farmers as employees and treats them horribly, as he continues to get disgustingly rich.\n\nThey have to work for him because it’s the only option, but they even admit Miser Stephens was better. It’s only Tom Sharpe who refuses to work for Jabez out of principle, but we understand that the others are doing what they have to do. Like Mr. Scratch tells them, there’s nothing to really think over when their crops are completely destroyed. In 1941, plenty of lower and working-class people knew the feeling of being at the end of their rope and working for someone they knew was taking advantage of them.\n\nJabez grows more and more shameless as the years go on, living relatively openly with his demonic mistress Belle (Simone Simon) under the very-thin-guise of her being his child’s nanny. His wife and mother (Jane Darwell) continue to live in the old house out of protest, but Jabez lives in a mansion he has built with the money made from his local monopoly and exploitation of his fellow man.\n\nNote how little he thinks of them, in that the advance for every man willing to work for Jabez is a mere dollar, but he casually makes a bet with the squire (Gene Lockhart) of $5,000. None of Jabez’s “friends” want to attend a party he throws in his new mansion, but Belle covers for him and invites her friends from “over the mountain.” That’s right, this movie implies that the kind of rich people who attend rich-people parties are literal demons from Hell.\n\nRight before the final showdown where Mr. Scratch and Daniel Webster battle in a ghostly courtroom for Jabez’s soul, the former takes responsibility for all of the evils done in America since the beginning.\n\n“When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there,” he gloats, continuing “When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck.” The Devil and Daniel Webster portrays a Devil who will always exploit the weak, no matter if it’s the founding of America, the pre-Civil War era, or getting out of a Depression.\n\nVal Lewton was an innovative horror producer who was the grandfather of the less-is-more style of horror. RKO would give him an exciting title (The Body Snatcher, Cat People), a 75-minute runtime, and a tight budget, and Lewton would turn in a subtle, haunting film that would rely more on what you don’t see rather than what you do. He would also work with up-and-coming directors like Robert Wise (The Sound of Music, The Haunting, West Side Story) and Jacques Tourneur (We’ll get to him in the next part), and inspire horror films for years to come. In 1943, Lewton produced The Seventh Victim, which is about Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter in her debut role) searching for her missing sister Jacqueline (Jean Brooks), who turns out to be involved with a group of Greenwich Village Satanists.\n\nUnfortunately, The Seventh Victim is not one of Lewton’s finest offerings (It’s no Cat People), as there are a lot of characters who kind of look alike and sound alike, and they’re pretty easy to mix up. It’s only 71 minutes long, but apparently a few scenes were cut which would have helped the story a bit. As it is, the plot is a bit confusing, as it seems that the cult of Satanists wants Jacqueline dead for revealing their secrets, but they kill a private detective her sister hired and intend to frame Jacqueline for it. However, later they don’t want to kill her themselves so they ask her to drink poison.\n\nThey’re opposed to doing the killing themselves, but they’ve killed before anyway? When the poisoning doesn’t work, they send an assassin after her anyway!\n\nLike in The Black Cat, the cult is a more of a plot point than a major theme. They’re called Palladists, which were a made-up group of Devil worshipping Freemasons who were proven to be a hoax in the late 19th century. We don’t learn much of their ideology, and when pressed, the leader of the cult gives essentially a so-what argument by saying “Who knows what is wrong or right? If I prefer to believe in Satanic majesty and power, who can deny me? What proof can you bring that good is superior to evil?” It all basically comes down to the 1940s-equivalent of an internet troll saying “I’m actually right. Prove me wrong.”\n\n1946’s Angel on my Shoulder sees a dead gangster (Paul Muni) being double-crossed and ending up in a quite literal fire-and-brimstone Hell.\n\nThere he meets The Devil (Claude Rains), who goes by Nick. Rains apparently had wanted to play Scratch in The Devil and Daniel Webster which would have fit the more polished, refined gentleman in Benet’s short story, but not so much the folksy, whispery one we see in the film.\n\nAngel on my Shoulder is a perfectly fine film, but it’s not the classic The Devil and Daniel Webster is. It’s not a horror film, as it mainly concerns Paul Muni’s character trying to redeem himself, while The Devil tries to work out his own plan in him. The Devil puts him in the body of a judge he wants to harm, but of course things don’t go as planned. At points it kind of feels like a comedy with Muni poking some fun at his older gangster roles, but then the Hell scenes seem to be played perfectly straight. Rains could have been a great Devil in a better movie, but here he just kind of stands in place and encourages Muni to follow his plan.\n\nThe end of the film features Muni rejecting the Devil’s plan and… blackmailing him into making him a trustee in Hell? Yay, happy ending? What kind of changes can you make if you’re on Hell’s board of directors? Flammable Fridays?\n\nThe film is a parody… or homage… or sequel, I don’t know what you want to call it, to Here Comes Mr. Jordan, a film about a boxer who goes to Heaven before his time, meets an angel played by Claude Rains, and has to inhabit someone else’s body. Since both were written by Harry Segall, I can’t say which he’s going for here. It’s weird.\n\nThe decade wrapped up with the 1949 political drama Alias Nick Beal. The film was apparently also released as Alias Nicky Beal, Dark Circle, and Strange Temptation which somehow all sound like porn titles, so I guess the right one stuck. The film stars Thomas Mitchell as Joseph Foster, a moral and upstanding district attorney with higher political ambitions who gets some illegally-gotten information from a mysterious man called Nick Beal (Ray Milland).\n\nIt’s a slow slip into evil, as Foster doesn’t even want to use the intel, but knows he’ll be using it against a horrible crime boss. I love that Beal has to win him over slowly instead of just laying it all out on the table right away, which is an interesting change to the classic story. Of course, Foster begins to give more and more of himself, and by the time he’s elected governor, he has essentially sold his soul away. Honestly, this film was so grounded in realism and politics that I thought it might go an alternate route and not have Nick Beal be a literal flesh-and-blood Devil, but nope, he is. Honestly, the blending of this against the political backdrop is kind of awkward.\n\nThere are a lot of conversations of “Well they believed in that kind of thing then but not today,” and there’s a clause in a contract that says Foster will have to join Nick on the Isle of Almas Perdidas, which translates to “Lost Souls.” It’s a pretty wonky third act to a movie trying so hard to be realistic and believable up to that point. The Devil is simply defeated by throwing a Bible on top of the contract, which, theological accuracy aside, is an incredibly underwhelming defeat cinematically speaking. 8 years earlier, we got a jury of the damned and Daniel Webster presenting a case in supernatural court, and now we’re at “Bible on the ground.”\n\nHonestly, I think The Devil and Daniel Webster is the main reason this movie exists. Thomas Mitchell was the first actor hired to play Daniel Webster in the 1941 film, but he fractured his skull after falling from a horse and was replaced with Edward Arnold. I’m sure Mitchell would have done a fine job, but Arnold is so brilliant I can’t picture anyone else in the role. Like Daniel Webster, Alias Nick Beal has a deal with The Devil, politicians, a mistress (Audrey Totter) working for The Devil, and upright characters who help the Faust character square off against Satan in the end. Here those characters are Foster’s wife (Geraldine Wall) and a reverend (George Macready). Ray Milland makes for a charming and conniving Devil, and I really wish he had a better movie around him. He would, in a way, reprise the role in 1961’s King of Kings, where he goes uncredited as the voice of Satan tempting Jesus in the wilderness.\n\nIt feels like Alias Nick Beal is trying to follow the same beats of The Devil and Daniel Webster through the lens of a political drama like All the King’s Men (The film would come out later that year, but the book was already a bestseller.), but it never finds an original voice of its own. Had it gone for the angle of Nick Beal not actually being The Devil, or even perhaps left it ambiguous, the film might have found its own voice. It’s a fine film on its own, but compared to something as colorful and poignant as The Devil and Daniel Webster, it feels pretty flat.\n\nIn the next part, we’ll see how Devil films all but went away in the 1950s, only to come back with a vengeance in the late ’60s. The world was beginning to change, and so was its idea of pure evil."
