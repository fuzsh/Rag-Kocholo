        "text": "This post is all about the Best 1940s Film Noir Movies by Year\n\nWhat is a Film noir?\n\nFor other film noir lovers out there, you know it's hard to exactly describe or define what makes a movie a film noir.\n\nIt's more like once you've seen enough of them, you can then recognize them based off of the style and common themes that tend to run through the movies.\n\nFilm noirs peaked in popularity in the 1940s and 1950s, this is generally referred to as the \"classic period of flim noir.\"\n\nThe term film noir is a french term that means \"black film\" or \"dark film.\"\n\nThis is fitting because film noirs often center around the underworld or crime of some sort. (they are also often shot in black and white, but there are also color film noirs.)\n\nCommon storyline include hardboiled detectives unraveling a mystery, an organized crime syndicate, or a heist about to take place.\n\nThe world of film noir also often has a femme fatale and/or the 'girl next door.'\n\nOften the story can be told through flashbacks with the main character narrating the storyline.\n\nThe main character is also often flawed, again going back to the theme of the underworld, something that was rare in the 1940s.\n\nThe femme fatale was usually a woman of questionable motives or virtue, (and usually drop-dead gorgeous and stylish to boot.)\n\nFemme fatale is another french term for \"fatal woman\" as she is usually seductive and often brings down the male character in film noirs.\n\nSometimes the femme fatale isn't all that bad and there can be a happy ending, but often either she destroys the man, or he finds the 'girl next door' character.\n\nThese girls are meant to be the wholesome female characters of the film, they can sometimes come across as being a little too goody two shoes.\n\nFilm noirs and the Motion Picture Production Code\n\nOld film noir movies often have bad endings, due to the Motion Picture Production Code that was in effect from 1934-1968.\n\nAmong other things, the code specified that:\n\n“Crime and immorality could never be portrayed in a positive light.”\n\n“Criminals should not be made to be heroes.”\n\nSince film noirs often identify with an “anti-hero” or the “not so good guy,” in order to comply with the code, if the story portrayed a main character who was involved in a bank heist, for example, he wouldn’t be able to get away with it in the end because otherwise that could be portraying crime in a positive light.\n\nSo, unfortunately if you always want a happy ending in your movies, unless the main character hasn’t been directly involved in a serious crime, then it’s not likely to end well.\n\nBut, that’s all part of the appeal…It’s amazing to see how creative the film makers were when writing the plots while adhering to the code.\n\nAnd so, enough with the definitions, onto the best 1940s film noir movies!"
