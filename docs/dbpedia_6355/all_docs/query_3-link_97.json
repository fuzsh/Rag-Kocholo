        "text": "Once Mussolini's fascist regime had fallen, the Italian film industry cooperated with U.S. companies in order to secure an American dominance of the market. This caused Italian production companies to drastically scale down. Previously, throughout WWII, the likes of Guiseppe De Santis and Mario Alicata considered the possibility of a movement \"following the slow and tired step of the worker who returns home\". After the war, this sentiment aligned with the public's interests, as a coalition government was formed and the country aimed to restart with a liberal ideology.\n\nPrior to this, the Italian industry had been synonymous with elaborate studio settings, most notably thanks to Cinécitta studios, which had been left heavily damaged. With fewer resources and a liberal agenda to provide the public with films that would empathetically put contemporary issues in theaters, the nation's cinematic tendencies were also ready to be renewed. Ranging from partisan heroics to post-war suffering, neorealist filmmakers sought to tell stories of everyday people as the nation coped with the devastation of WWII. Below you'll find the films that formed the movement.\n\nOssessione (1943) by director Luchino Visconti\n\nSet in 1944, Nazi have occupied Rome. Giorgio Manfredi leads the Resistance and is currently seeking refuge as the Nazis start a manhunt.\n\nHollywood director Martin Scorsese once described the film as \"the most precious moment in film history\".\n\nOutcry (1946) Il sole sorfe ancora by director Aldo Vergano\n\nOutcry is a war-drama considered to be a cornerstone in neorealism. Director Aldo Vergano wrote many Telefoni Bianchi films throughout the thirties.\n\nIn 1946, the Italian institutional referendum was held, putting liberal parties in power of Italy. From this point on, Italy would be a republic.\n\nTo Live in Peace (1946) Vivere in pace by director Luigi Zampa\n\nSix stories during WWII show how language barriers can have tragic consequences. Paisan is the second instalment of Rossellini's War Trilogy, which also includes Rome, Open City and Germany Year Zero.\n\nThe film was given international acclaim, including an Academy Award for Best Screenplay, and a BAFTA Award for Best Film.\n\nGermany, Year Zero (1947) Germania anno zero by director Roberto Rossellini\n\nSet in post-war Berlin, Germany, Year Zero follows the turmoils of a young German boy. The film completes Rossellini's War Trilogy.\n\nTragic Hunt (1947) Caccia tragica by director Guiseppe De Santis\n\nAfter WWII, a cooperative is formed by working class Italians. When a group of thieves seize the cooperative's funds, a tragic manhunt begins.\n\nThe script was written by Michelangelo Antonioni and Carlo Lizzani, both of whom would go on to become internationally successful filmmakers in their own right.\n\nSenza pietà (1947) by director Luigi Zampa\n\nA village photographer is given a magical camera by a stranger, who claims to be Sant Andrea. When used, the camera can destroy the wicked, but can the man claiming to be Sant Andrea be trusted?\n\nIn 1949, State Undersecretary Guilio Andreotti would establish import limits and screen quotas for the Italian film industry. His new laws, which included loans to Italian production companies, intended to prevent an American dominance throughout Italy's domestic market. With this came a demand for more star power within Italian films, and screenplays would be vetted before production in order to ensure that they were likely to be successful at the box office - thereby enforcing some degree of censorship. As their was less interest in neorealist films compared to lighter (or rauchier) comedies and historical dramas from the general public, commercials films within Italy would become synonymous with voluptuous women throughout the 1950s. Or, as State Undersecretary Guilio Andreotti would put it, these films would have \"less rags, more legs\".\n\nStromboli (1950) Stromboli, terra di Dio by director Roberto Rossellini\n\nWith a half-improvised storyline, Viaggio in Italia explores the complexities of marriage, centering on a disillusioned English couple seeking a new direction or their unhappy lives.\n\nAlso known as Voyage to Italy, Rossellini's film stars his then-wife Ingrid Bergman. It has been suggested that their films together have autobiographical elements from their own relationship. The film made a considerable impact on the Cahier du cinéma writers, who would go on to form the nouvelle vague. Therefore, the film's release was considered to be a monumental moment for the French New Wave's early beginnings.\n\nLa Strada (1954) La strada by director Federico Fellini\n\nA collection of 6 stories pay tribute to the city of Naples, including a clown exploited by gangsters, a woman who loses her husbands ring, a child's funeral, the misfortune of a gambler, a prostitute's wedding and the exploits of a 'wisdom seller'.\n\nAndreotti's law and the rise of 'rosy neorealism': A dead end for the movement\n\nWhen the first neorealist film, Ossessione, was released in 1942, Vittorio Mussolini (who was the head of the film industry at the time) famously left the theater and screamed \"this is not Italy!\". While Italy had adopted a comparatively liberal political system after WWII, the government's ideologies would not become pleased with the neorealist movement's portrayals of social issues. In 1947, Andreotti's law had decidedly changed Italian cinema thanks to preproduction censorship. Films would even be denied the right to be exported internationally if they were seen as slanderous towards Italy in any way, shape or form.\n\nWhile the stories of working class struggles were being oppressed by this change, commercial filmmakers were also adopting neorealist aesthetics for generic romance flicks and run-of-the-mill melodramas. 'Rosy neorealism' used techniques from the movement to combined it with the popular comedic tone seen throughout the 1930s. In short, the techniques that had originally provided social comment and artistically valuable films were now being packaged by the industry.\n\nOne year after scenes of public protest in Umberto D. led Andreotti to publicly scathe Vittorio De Sica, filmmakers were discussing the movement at the 1953 Parma Congress on Neorealism. There could be no doubt that this important era in Italian film history had changed the way film could be used for reportage and societal change, but the overall tone of the event showed a belief that the movement had come to an end. Still, neorealism's influence on the Cahiers du cinéma writers would soon make a startling impact on the industry, and the movement had successfully provided an opportunity for dedramatized storytelling to become internationally popular throughout the 1960s.\n\nReferences:\n\nDonald Sassoon. \"Giulio Andreotti obituary\". the Guardian.\n\nBordwell, David; Thompson, Kristin. 2010.
