        "text": "A look at the films that inspired so many to make movies. I just scratch the surface with a handful of titles, that I would refer to as iconic Italian Cinema.\n\nWhen Italy entered the second world war on the side of the Nazi’s in 1940, the Cinecitta studios were commandeered by Mussolini who put his army in charge of them. This meant that filmmakers found themselves without a location to make movies, and thus it was at this time that directors decided to take to the streets of Rome and other cities to commit to celluloid their hopes, dreams, and visions.\n\nFilmmakers such as Visconti, Rossellini, and De Sica, who were to become known as the pioneers of the neorealism movement in Italy, went onto the streets and began filming in real locations, shooting their movies in natural light without the assistance of any artificial or studio lighting.\n\nThe movies that they produced were seen as true to life, the people of Italy taking them as more realistic documentations of life in the country at the time, rather than the contrived and flawless visions of utopia as conveyed by the Fascists.\n\nThese Golden age productions as they were also referred to, included seminal Italian films, such as Roma Citta Aperta, Ladri di Bicicletti, I Vitelloni, La Strada, and Viaggio in Italia.\n\nThe movies often using unknown actors or even just ordinary members of the public, setting the story in depraved areas of a city, and focusing upon the poorest people in the country. Whilst also at the same time concentrating upon the struggles of the working class. This type of film was at its most prominent from 1943 to 1952 and showed a side to life that was directly the opposite to that which was being purveyed by Hollywood filmmakers, Ironically the films now referred to as Neo Realism proved to be popular with audiences outside of Italy and being more appealing mostly to audiences more in the States and the UK. It was the realism, the grittiness and the more often than not, monochrome photography that too added an attraction to this genre. In the spring of 1945, the grip of Mussolini over the Italian people came to an end, when Il Duce was executed, and Italy was liberated from German occupation.\n\nThis period became known as the Italian Spring, which saw a break from old ways in the country and fostered a more realistic approach to making films. Italian cinema and movie producers stopped utilizing elaborate studio sets and began more frequently shooting on location in the countryside and city streets in a realist style.\n\nAlthough the birth of neorealism in Italy has been widely disputed by academics and filmmakers alike, the first neorealist film is thought to be Luchino Visconti’s Ossessione, which was released in 1943, during the German occupation of the country. The genre itself was influenced by Poetic Realism, Marxism, and Christian Humanism, and in turn it influenced, French New Wave Cinema, Cinema Novo and Iranian New Wave as well as others.\n\nThe style employed within the Italian films in the genre was influential through the decades, and a similar style of filming and using non actors in various scenes can be seen in films such as in Kubrick’ Spartacus, and Pontecorvo’s Battle of Algiers, and Quemada. Even the films of British directors Ken Loach, Ken Russel, and Mike Leigh are too a degree influenced by this style of filming, the filmmakers very often opting to go with lesser-known actors in some of the roles and camera work that resembles a documentary style at times, as in Peterloo in the case of Leigh.\n\nBoth Leigh and Loach have a lifelike social and practical style of direction, their movies often focusing on the British working class, very like Italian directors focused upon the day-to-day struggles of the working class in Italy. With actors speaking in their native language or in the case of British movies the accent/dialect of the region that they came from. Loach said that using subtitles would be preferable rather than asking actors to change the way they speak, because by asking them to do this, would make the performance false. The neorealist style in Italy was developed by a circle of film critics that contributed to the magazine Cinema, including: the already mentioned Visconti and the likes of Gianni Puccini, Cesare Zavattini, Guiseppe De Santis and Pietro Ingrao. Who at the time were restricted in what they wrote in the way of politics because Mussolini’s son was editor in chief of the publication. Several of the filmmakers involved with neorealism, learnt their craft whilst working on the Calligrafismo genre of movies which were popular during the early part of the 1940’s. This genre is a complex form of cinema, which is adept at recalling many cultural tendencies and, at the same time, of co-ordinating them in a comprehensive communicative, and dramatic form.\n\nI am going to begin my look at films in the category of Neorealism with Roma Citta Aperta, or Rome open City. I will begin with the musical score because I am not sure why but the scores for many of the neo realism movies seem to have faded into obscurity.\n\nThe music for Rome Open City was penned by Renzo Rossellini. Who was the younger brother of Roberto Rossellini who directed the movie. Renzo was born on February 2nd, 1908, in Rome, Lazio, Italy. He was a composer and actor, known for Rome, Open City (1945), I Fratelli Karamazoff (1947) and Paisan (1946). He died on May 13, 1982, in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n\nThe soundtrack from Rome Open City was never released, although there is a two-minute cue from the score on Amazon music, which has very bad sound quality. For most of the movie’s duration the music works as a good film score should, extenuating and supporting without being intrusive or overpowering, even if the music is almost continuous, which was the style at this time.\n\nSet in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Rome the eternal city, the film Rome Open City is the first in a trilogy of war movies helmed by Filmmaker Roberto Rossellini, the film shows the watching audience what life was like under the heel of a cruel and oppressive occupier in the form of Nazi Germany. It focuses upon the day-to-day existence that ordinary people are enduring under ever increasingly difficult circumstances, concentrating of a handful of figures working for the resistance who are attempting bravely to resist the occupiers. Many say that the movie is a propaganda exercise, but there is so much more to this iconic piece of cinema.\n\nThe director sees the resistance against the invaders through the eyes of not just the people, but via the actual city itself. With the familiar sights of Rome taking centre stage to the narrative, becoming more like a character within the storyline rather than just a location.\n\nIt is a powerful and compelling tale that was co-written by Federico Fellini, and the way in which Rossellini navigates the production in a very documentary like style, adds greater impact and creates higher levels of emotion to the proceedings. The images created being some of the most touching and moving in the history of cinema.\n\nThe next movie I suppose can be compared to the work of the likes of Chaplin on The Kid and maybe might have served as some of the inspiration, emotion, courage, and sentiment that we see in the Hollywood blockbuster The Champ. Ladri di Biciclette / The Bicycle Thieves from 1948 is maybe the most intense drama about a boy and his father in the history of cinema. One of the main characters Antonio, earns a living from, and feeds his family by using his bicycle. One day the bicycle is stolen, and Antonio wanders the streets of Rome trying to find it.\n\nHis son Bruno accompanies him in his search, the relationship that we see between father and son on screen is somewhat like that of the relationship we will witness in a later De Sica movie between an elderly man and his dog, in the superb Umberto D (1952). Antonio and his son lose their faith in finding the stolen bike and at the same time lose faith in humanity and life itself.\n\nThe musical score by Alesandro Cicognini, is superb, and is a wonderfully supportive and expressive soundtrack. I often think that there could be a compilation of the music from these Italian classics, in a similar way that CAM records released the scores from the films of Fellini, which were by the likes of Rota and Bacalov. But, apart from the odd track here and there on digital platforms and you tube the genre goes musically unrepresented as it were.\n\nI suppose because of the age of the films and the sound quality of some of the recordings which were made during World War two or just after, it’s hardly surprising that full scores do not exist. However, maybe a selection of suites from a handful of the movies could be reconstructed and re-recorded and given a new lease of life and thus preserving them for future generations. But I am dreaming again. Because Neo-realism had a short life only running from 1945 through to 1952, it is a genre or a collection of movies that stand out because there are relatively few of them, but they are all wonderfully expressive and made with a care and precision by the directors and the producers that were involved under extraordinary conditions. It is a genre of film that has endured and maintained a fascination for many as well as attracting new followers of all ages and continues to do so after all these years.\n\nThe next movie is from director, Luciano Visconti, La Terra Trema /The Earth Trembles which was released in the same year as The Bicycle Thieves, tells the story of poor Sicilian fishermen who are being exploited by fish wholesalers. One of the families involved is trying to escape the restrictions that the rich employers have imposed upon them and buy their own boat. But even their fellow fisherman and villagers refuse to help them in any way, because they fear the ramifications from the bosses if they do. Even the weather it seems is against them and their venture. The movie is divided into five sections, that include three main narratives, a prologue or introduction and an epilogue. The first part of the story explains who the Valasros family are, and their attempt to improve their standard of living by breaking away from greedy employers and buying their own fishing vessel.\n\nThey tell the wholesalers at the market that they deserve better prices for their catch, but this ends in chaos and one of the family the eldest son Ntoni being arrested and put into jail for throwing a set of weighing scales into the sea. But the bosses soon realise it is better to have them out of jail and working so that they can continue to profiteer from the fisherman’s hard work. The family had previously attempted to form a co-operative of all the fisherman to make sure everyone got a fair price, but this was stopped, and no one joined. So, the family then mortgage their home and buy a boat and start their own business. The second part of the story shows the watching audience how vulnerable and alone that the family are, and their realization that maybe being your own boss is not as glamorous and profitable as they first thought, not considering that being their own boss also made them responsible for the costs of maintenance etc on the boat. When they set off and a violent storm strikes it damages their craft badly. But they have no money to repair it, at this stage in the story the other fishermen encouraged by the wholesalers begin to ridicule them.\n\nThe third part of the story focuses upon how the family becomes even more vulnerable and how their lives decline, with the social aspects of the situation for the family being revealed. Basically, they have done all of this for nothing, to make no progress because even though they had their own boat the wholesalers still set a price for the fish that they caught. In the movies Epilogue, the eldest son of the family Ntoni, swallows his pride and goes back to work for the bosses again as a labourer in the wholesale market, because they have plenty of work as their profits have made it possible for them to purchase a new fleet of boats. The movie is shot in one place, and apart from the scenes that are filmed on the ocean and the scenarios of when a family member is jailed and then when the family go to the bank to sign the contract for the mortgage, we remain in the village of Aci Trezza, which at times purveys a mood that is somewhat claustrophobic. Whilst thinking of making the movie as early as 1941,\n\nDirector Visconti, was conscious that music would play an important role within the narrative, he enlisted the help of composer and conductor Willy Ferrero who had also directed the music for The Bicycle Thieves, the composer adapted Sicilian folk songs and tailored these to meet the needs of the film. But on watching the movie one does notice that the use of any kind of music is rather sparing, until that is we move towards the story’s conclusion, when we hear more underscore beginning to edge its way into the proceedings. This has a tragic style that effectively underlines and supports the family’s fate, containing shades of melancholy and purveying a mood of isolation. Other than this the director relies upon the natural sounds of the sea and the wind, shouts and sounds from the village streets, whistling from one of the characters in the movie, plus emotive and melodic pieces played by another family member on screen.\n\nThe composer Willy Ferrero was born in the United States to Italian parents, he was to become an important figure in the musical world of the neo realism movies as produced in Italy, born May 21,1906 in Portland, Oregon, he began his career surprising everyone by directing orchestral concerts at the age of six years. He was known for being a very sensitive and elegant musician and preferred rhythmical motifs. He has the great merit of having acquainted the wider public to the expressionism of Ravel. He died prematurely on March 23, 1954, in Rome, Italy, after working on a handful of Italian movies, but although his output may not have been in the same league as Nino Rota, his contributions were as expressive and effective as Rota. After the film was completed, a voice-over commentary written by Antonio Pietrangeli had to be added, since no Italian was spoken by the participants. At the beginning of the film, the narrator states that “Italian is not a language of the poor.” Another brilliant example of the neo realism genre.\n\nLuchino Visconti was a director who was to coin a phrase way ahead of his time, he like many other directors that were making movies in the 1940’s through to the 1950’s understood well the impact of cinema upon the masses, Visconti more than other filmmakers took chances with the movies he made, but these more often than not paid off with the director being one of the most successful filmmakers in Italy and now hailed as a genius around the world. He displayed his unquestionable flair for story telling early in his career with the movie Ossessione, which was a movie based upon James Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice, a story that was later committed to celluloid by American filmmakers, but the later version of the tale significantly fades in the shadow of Visconti’s version of the story.\n\nWhen watching the movie, one straight away picks up upon the intensity and passion that the director managed to extract in the performances of the key characters. Clara Calamai is in a word amazing as Giovanna, who decides that she wants to be free from the older man who has given her so many opportunities and transformed her life for the better. Within the last part of the movie, we see the actress at her best in the biting and effective twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed.\n\nEqually excellent is actor Massimo Girotti, who appears as Gino the man who awakens a passion and an obsessive side within Giovanna. Girotti makes the character come to life and makes him so believable, that one forgets that this is a movie. Juan DeLanda portrays Giuseppe, who is the older man who fell in love with Giovanna and her vivacious and lively character. DeLanda also creating a believable and at the same time sorry looking character.\n\nCinematography is the work of Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti, who’s stylish and creative camera work gave the movie a natural appearance. The score was by Giuseppe Rosati, Director Visconti also added the operatic arias of Verdi and Bizet to the soundtrack, which work in the context of the narrative. Ossessione is a film that should be treasured and is a movie that should be shown regularly so that future generations can savour and enjoy it, as this is a master filmmaker at his best.\n\nLet us now turn to Vittorio De Sica’s Umberto D from 1952, which I mentioned briefly at the beginning of this article. As I watched the movie for about the 50th time, I marvelled again at the high level of acting excellence on display by the title character actor Carlo Battisti, who portrays convincingly a retired civil servant called Umberto Domenico Ferrari. Watching the performance, one might think that he is a polished professional, but wait that is not the case, Battisti was a non-pro-actor, which means that he has to be congratulated even more for his stunning performance in the role. It is like he knows instinctively what the director wants from him, the films story is one of loss, and the central character is someone that could be either you or I, having reached the final stages of our lives and taking tentative steps in case we make yet another mistake.\n\nUmberto now retired and has had a life that is filled with work and even more work, for which his past employers are grateful. But now he resides in a damp and desolate looking room that is infested, with his outlook on life being bleak, as is in keeping with numerous neo-realistic examples from Italy. He becomes unwell and is sent to a hospital but upon his return he is told by his landlady that she wants him out, his dirty dank room being ripped apart. He is on the streets, alone and miserable, I say alone but he does have one companion, a small dog called flag, who we soon realise is Umberto’s only friend.\n\nI suppose this part of the story can be to a certain extent likened to a Chaplin film, but there are no comedic interludes, and the central character has no companions apart from the dog. The cinematography is excellent with the camera work of Aldo Graziati following the unlikely friends, with the affection and care for each other shining through all the gloom and misery. It shows us that no matter how bad things are that the strength of a real friendship between a man and his dog can be stronger in dire times than the relationship between two humans.\n\nThe score plays a vital part in creating even more emotion and underlining various scenarios, composer Alessandro Cicognini providing an effective and suitably melancholy soundtrack for the movie, which is subtle but also powerful because of the way the music is placed and orchestrated.\n\nOur next example of Neo realism is set in Northern Italy, in which we see women leave their families and jobs and move to the rice fields to work harvesting the crop. A pair of lovers Francesca (Doris Dowling) and Walter (Vittorio Gassman) are second rate criminals who stage a robbery at a hotel where they steal a valuable gem, after which Francesca joins a group of workers to try and elude capture by the police. One of her fellow workers a young and sensual woman called Silvana (Silvana Mangano), befriends Francesca, and start to become close to her. She finds a beautiful piece of jewellery hidden in in Francesca’s mattress.\n\nAfter arriving at a lodge, they encounter a recently de-mobbed army sergeant Marco portrayed by Raf Vallone, it is not long before he becomes attracted to Sivana. Which leads to a relationship that has tragic consequences. Riso Amaro or Bitter Rice (1949) is an innovative neo-realistic drama that is laced with romance, very much like it’s storyline the visual style of the movie is a combination of both Hollywood melodrama and Italian neorealism.\n\nIt was the film that introduced Silvana Mangano to cinema audiences, who portrays an extremely beautiful and sexy woman. Doris Dowling is also excellent, performing as the long-suffering Francesca, a woman who has been abused by her lover.\n\nDirected by Giuseppe de Santis, the film was scored by Goffredo Petrassi, Petrassi of course is known for his involvement with composers such as Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai who he tutored, the composer scored very few motion pictures as he was primarily known for concert hall compositions.\n\nPetrassi was born near Rome in 1904 and was considered by many to be one of the most significant and influential Italian composers of the 20th Century. At the age of fifteen the young Petrassi began to work in a music shop to support his family, and this is probably where his love and interest of music was expanded and cemented. He is however. more associated with music for the concert hall, with his output in this area being prolific. Because of the composer’s commitments to teaching and the world of classical music his forays into scoring movies were few and far between, although when the composer did work on movie score’s he always produced works that were supportive as well as being thematic. Petrassi began to write for films back in the 1940’s and in total during his career he wrote the music for ten pictures, these included six feature films and four shorts.\n\nThe composer’s credits for film include Bitter Rice, (1949), Under the Olive Tree (1950), La Pattuglia Sperduta (1954), and Cronaca Familiare, (1962).\n\nLa Strada, is the film that established Federico Fellini as a renowned filmmaker. It is the tale of a sweet and angelic girl Gelsomina (Guilietta Masina), who is sold by her mother to a travelling showman Zampano (Anthony Quinn) for 10,000 lire and a few kilos of food.\n\nZampano who exhibits feats of strength by breaking a chain wrapped around his chest, performs in village squares and then passes the hat for whatever the normally small crowd is prepared to give. He teaches Gelsomina a drum roll, as part of his introduction. But he doesn’t treat her well and when she tries to run away, he beats her.\n\nThey eventually join a small traveling circus where they meet a tight-rope walker who convinces Gelsomina to question her what choices she has. Directed by Federico Fellini in 1954, it is aa sad and affecting story, which contains some wonderful performances from Anthony Quinn, Guilietta Masina, and Richard Basehart.\n\nThe haunting an effective music is by Nino Rota, a composer who was to have a long association with Fellini, as well as collaborating with many other Italian filmmakers and then in later years working with American directors.\n\nRota also scored Rocco E I Suoi Fratelli, aka Rocco and His Brothers, which was directed by Luciano Visconti and released in 1960, this is seen as one of the last neo realism movies to come out of Italy during what is termed as the golden age and is also a movie that the director has said is his favourite out of all his films. It acted like a bridge between vintage neo realism and a more contemporary form of the genre. Like many neorealism movies it is at times complex, but then there are joyous and simplistic interludes which makes the movie a delight to sit and watch. All of the cast members are excellent in their portrayal of their characters, each performance being genuine and entertaining.\n\nA young Alain Delon is outstanding as Rocco: who is a gentle and caring individual, who at times because of these qualities is somewhat weak. His brother Simone is quite the opposite and is played by Renato Salvatori who convincingly assumes the persona of the character on screen.\n\nSimone is wild, and unstable, he is also a person who is easily led to fear, addiction, and despair. Another performance in the movie that certainly deserves a mention is that of Katina Paxinou’s in the role of the boy’s mother Rosaria: she is religious and at times a little superstitious but has a domineering control over her sons. But saying this she is mostly good hearted and kind.\n\nA mention should also be made of a minor role played by Claudia Cardinale as Ginetta. Rocco E I Suoi Fratelli, is probably Visconti’s most powerful movie, though on watching the film today it may seem a little dated, but that is to be expected as it was made over four decades ago, I think it is a window into the Italy of the 1960’s at a time when cinema in Italy was developing and becoming a medium that many other countries were taking their lead from.\n\nNino Rota’s haunting score is rich, but also subdued, the composer relying on sparse sounding motifs to accompany the storyline. As one sits and listens to the score one can pick out slitters of themes that the composer used in later movies with one reoccurring theme in particular baring a striking resemblance to his work of The Godfather some twelve years later.\n\nIn 1955 Rota also penned the score for Il Bidone, which focuses upon three men, Augusto, Carlo, and Roberto who are all con artists, but sometimes work together. Augusto is the oldest, and the most experienced in his role of a deceiver. They all seem to be immune from any feelings of guilt, and to the idea that their victims are not wealthy highflyers but are mostly uneducated peasants. Each of the trio of villain’s is at a different stage of life, Carlo and Augusto begin to examine what they’re doing more critically, their doubts about what they do to make money stemming from a certain incident. But Roberto, who is the youngest of the three is still living for the moment as it were, never thinking of the future, and always prepared to take money from anyone, without any conscious. Carlo yearns to make a legitimate living as an artist, and this is why he is nicknamed Picasso, he knows that he can do it but can he earn a living from it? Carlo’s wife Iris, and their adolescent daughter Silvania stand by him no matter what. Carlo has told Iris that his frequent absences is because of his job as a travelling salesman with Augusto, but she decides enough is enough as she can no longer bury her head in the sand about what he’s doing. Carlo meets his young daughter who he at first does not recognise, as he has not seen her for years. He must decide to either help her further her education and or change his lifestyle. The movie featured two American stars Richard Basehart as Carlo, and Broderick Crawford as Augusto, with Italian actress Giulietta Masina as Iris and Franco Fabrizi as Roberto.\n\nBorn in Milan in 1911 into a family of musicians, Nino Rota was first a student of Orefice and Pizzetti. Then, still a child, he moved to Rome where he completed his studies at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1929 with Alfredo Casella. Nino Rota began his involvement with film scoring in 1933 with his work on Treno Popolare, he was 22 years of age, since that first assignment the composer was to work on literally hundreds of film and TV projects and was responsible in my opinion for placing Italian film music on the map and paved the way for the likes of Ennio Morricone, Bruno Nicolai and their like.\n\nRota was able to create numerous themes and scores that had to them a haunting and lasting appeal, they were also appealing because of their simplicity and their ability to mesmerize and attract both in the context of the music and image working in unison and as melodic and alluring music away from those images. And although he was much in demand during the 1940’s, 1950’s and the 1960’s when he created memorable themes and scores such as Romeo and Juliet, The Leopard, The Taming of the Shrew and Juliet of the Spirits to mention but a few. He continued to fashion quirky but at the same time classically laced works for the silver screen into the 1970’s.\n\nScoring many movies for the respected and esteemed filmmaker Federico Fellini and working on blockbusters that included Waterloo, and box office draws such as Death on The Nile. Rota had a distinct style of scoring, at times his music was an integral component of the storytelling, on other occasions it was a subdued background to the action, but his style and sound lent much to every movie that he was involved with.\n\nWhat would Amacord be without its now familiar theme. The last motion picture he worked on was The Hurricane in 1979. He died relatively young at the age of 67, in Rome on April 10th, 1979.\n\nA group of women wait silently and nervously at a mine in Sicily, their menfolk are underground. The sulphur mine where they are employed is shutting down and the miners have decided to stay underground to change the minds of the owners of the mine. But they also know that if they stay underground more than three days they could die. After they return to surface somewhat despairingly, they all go to a bar where workers are being recruited to work for a French employer, the man doing the recruiting Cicco (Saro Urzi) tells the miners he can get them over the border for 20,000 lire per person. A bus load of people decides to take a chance and head for the border with their belongings, paying out the money in a last-ditch attempt to get decent jobs with fair wages. This is the story or at least the beginning of it for the movie The Path of Hope which was released in 1950.\n\nAmongst the bus passengers are Saro (Raf Vallone), and his three young children, Barbara (Elana Varzi), and her partner Vanni, (Franco Navarra) the latter pair are in trouble with the police and being hunted. They transfer from the bus to train and when it arrives in Napoli Cicco tries to run off with everyone’s money but is stopped by Vanni. Vanni makes plans with Barbara to meet at the border if anything should go wrong. When they arrive in Rome, Cicco alerts the police to Vanni, and in the ensuing gunfight both Vanni and Cicco manage to escape. All the other people on the bus are arrested and are ordered to return to Sicily, or they will be charged with illegal entry into the country and jailed. Which they agree to do, but instead Saro takes charge and the group head north to reach France.\n\nThe journey is a difficult one and the hardship that they suffer on the trek brings Saro and Barbara closer together. Director Pietro Germi’s Il Cammino Della Speranza / The Path of Hope fits perfectly into the genre of Italian neo- realism and has stood the test of time admirably, despite negative critical reviews.\n\nMany see Saro as the hero of this tale, but it is the group of ordinary people who are trying to better themselves that are heroic. Leaving their homes and place of birth to go out into the unknown and risk everything for the chance of employment in another country and a chance to better themselves and their families.\n\nMusic for the movie was the work of revered Italian Maestro Carlo Rustichelli, who wrote a symphonic classically slanted score for the movie, utilising strings and brass to create romantic and dramatic interludes.\n\nBecause of the year in which it was released a soundtrack was never issued, and now I do not think it will ever be. There are so many scores from Italian Neo-realism movies that are not available or at least not available in their complete form. Yes, there are snippets on the likes of you tube, and even a handful of tracks are now available on digital platforms, but the sound quality is distorted and scratchy. At least we have the movies which are a delight to watch and also listen to. This has been a look at the Italian neo-realism genre, there are many other movies within this genre and also movies that came later that were inspired by these black and white classics. If you have not seen these films now is the time to seek them out and I promise that you will not be sorry, they are superb pieces of cinema."
