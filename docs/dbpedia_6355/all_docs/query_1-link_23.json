        "text": "At A Glance\n\nHistory of Film Noir\n\nFilm noir translates to “dark film” and it was influenced by both the French New Wave and German Expressionist movements. The Great Depression made times for working Americans very difficult. The noir story arch and underlying themes aligned with the burden most Americans were feeling.\n\nThere is no official accord on how to carry out film noir depictions. It derives from many themes and personal context. Most critiques and scholars are still fighting the philosophy behind calling film noir a genre. Hollywood’s film noir is mostly about a crime and drama story arc, a detective/private eye and a femme fatale character. However, the definition of film noir isn’t based on their context. Other studios use noir techniques in more established genres such as parodies, comedies, and horrors. Yet, the underlying similarities between these genres using noir techniques are their themes and directors’ approach in cinematography.\n\nThemes\n\nA large amount of the screenplays were portrayals of fictional crime novels – The Big Sleep, The Asphalt Jungle, Gun Crazy, The Big Heat. The films were usually led by anti-heroes, including gangsters, private eyes, government agents, war veterans, cops, politicians, killers and many other societal or sinister roles. Seeing most of the appearances are twisting and menacing characters, film noir gravitates to exposing the evil of the world and showcasing the barbaric side of human nature.\n\nMore from Film Genres"
