        "text": "Screenings\n\nScreenings are a compulsory and essential part of our teaching. You won't just sit back and enjoy a film in a screening: you will watch critically and analytically, and take notes (even in the dark!). As you progress through the degree, you’ll become highly attuned to appreciating the ways in which style, mise-en-scène, sound and editing convey meaning. We’ll always show films in their entirety where a complete version exists - find out more about how we show films in our facilities.\n\nLectures\n\nA lecture is usually one person talking to a large group of students for about 50 minutes. Since the Department of Film and Television Studies is a small department there will be a maximum of 60 students in a lecture and usually far fewer (though lectures for modules taken in other departments can be larger). Lecturers are usually research specialists in the topic they're talking about. They will inspire you with new ideas and insights on your topic. They might use slides, images, sound and video clips, and give you a handout to help you take efficient notes.\n\nSeminars / Workshops\n\nA seminar is a group discussion between 8 to 11 people, where you'll take part and share your views. Your seminar leader will help you to explore and understand the material together. You will examine key terms and topics from the lecture in detail, discuss your analysis and interpretation of the films and television programmes, unpick key passages and questions from that week’s reading, and work together to analyse a clip from the film and apply this week’s learning to it. You need to come prepared and get involved. Together you will strengthen your skills in constructing arguments, providing evidence and thinking critically.\n\nIndependent study\n\nUniversity teaching is very different from learning at school or college. Generally speaking, for each module you take you can expect to have 1-2 screenings per week, a lecture per week and a seminar per week, but these are just the ‘contact hours’. Getting the most out of the university experience requires you to undertake your own independent study outside of class time. For each module, you can expect to have at least one piece of reading (typically a chapter from a book or an article from an academic journal) each week, which you are expected to read, synthesise and think about how it applies to the film of programme you have watched.\n\nAssessment\n\nThere are varied assessment practices in the department including blogs, audiovisual essays, short films and portfolio project work. However, the two primary methods of assessment that you will encounter are exams and essays.\n\nEssays are your chance to engage deeply with an aspect of the module that has really intrigued or interested you. They are your chance to develop sophisticated independent research skills and to improve the fluency of your written communication. Further reading, independent viewing and your own original close analysis are essential to gaining good marks.\n\nExams are not designed to test how well you remember every single fact you were ever taught, but your ability to link together material that has been taught on the module and marshal evidence in order to create your own original argument in response to a stimulus question. Staff will run revision sessions in the summer term to help with this.\n\nLook closely. No, closer still. Let’s watch that again.\n\nIn this module, the text is king. We want to give you intensive practice in looking at and listening closely to films and television programmes.. Lectures will equip you with the technical and analytical vocabulary of textual analysis. In the discussion-based seminars that follow, you’ll get to practice using and applying these terms yourself in a supportive environment, building up your confidence and command of the terminology that will be your academic language for the next three years. Written work is designed to build you up to a point where you can create your own reasoned and carefully argued interpretations of film texts. We’ll set readings each week that introduce you to the best of critical scholarship, and get you to begin to evaluate and reflect upon other accounts and interpretations of film.\n\nWe think it’s really important that you are exposed to a variety of films from different times, in different styles and from different nations. Each year, we carefully choose our film screenings to offer you the chance to experience and compare different approaches to the expressive use of film form and mise-en-scène. We want you to be able to examine, in detail, the ways in which stylistic choices create meaning and affect interpretation.\n\nWhat might you watch? Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, US, 1950), Elephant (Gus Van Sant, US, 2002), La Règle du jeu (Jean Renoir, France, 1939), Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand, 2010), Edge of Heaven (Germany/Turkey, Fatih Akin, 2007), M (Fritz Lang, Germany, 1931), The West Wing (NBC, 1999-2006), Miranda (2009-2015), This Morning (ITV, 1988- present), The Wire (HBO, 2002-2008)\n\nSpanning both its ‘classical’ and ‘post-classical’ periods (roughly the 1930s-1990s), the module does not aim to provide students with an exhaustive overview of every genre, director, star or film studio of these periods. Instead, and taking a broadly chronological approach, each week will focus on key historical developments and industrial changes that impacted the aesthetic output and political function of mainstream Hollywood products and their more marginal counterparts, through a focus on key textual and contextual key concepts and relevant case studies.\n\nThe module is split into two halves. Part I, Classical Hollywood: Style, Representation, and The Hollywood Studio System, focuses on the practices of film production that defined the Hollywood industrial model in its ‘classical’ era. Covering important historical, technological and industrial transformations, including McCarthyism and the advent of colour technology, the mainstream case studies focused on in this half of the module will support consideration of Hollywood’s ideological influence and the ways Hollywood cinema has promoted American values and traditions through specific ideologies, such as class, gender race and ethnicity. A simultaneous emphasis on filmmaking at the ‘margins’ of classical Hollywood will facilitate engagement with the ways these ideologies and representational strategies have been reframed and resisted in the work of marginal filmmakers working within and adjacent to the ‘Big 5’ film studios.\n\nThe module’s second half, Post-Classical Hollywood: from the Mainstream to the Margins will continue to emphasise issues of politics and representation in Hollywood’s ‘post-classical’ era, taking a broad view of ‘Hollywood’ that places even greater emphasis on independent, marginal producers working in the shadow of the major studios during this period. First examining the various shifts that led to the ‘post-classical’ era in Hollywood, this part of the module will trace key moments of industrial and aesthetic change that facilitated the emergence of predominantly white, masculine cinemas of ‘New Hollywood’ and their overlooked Black and female counterparts. Continuing the emphasis on textual and contextual key concepts from the first half of the module, the selected case-studies will also enable students to appreciate the political and aesthetic contributions of the African American and Women filmmakers excluded from the legacies of ‘New Hollywood’ and consider the legacies of their aesthetic and political contributions to US cinematic histories\n\nWhat might you watch? TBC\n\nThis module explores the silent period in Europe and America – a period in which some of the most important films, filmmakers and filmmaking trends emerged. In this module, we treat films of early cinema as complex, rather than ‘primitive’ texts.\n\nYou’ll get hands-on with trade periodicals and fan magazines from this period to bring these films to life and develop your skills in historical research.\n\nYou’ll investigate the social and cultural context into which cinema emerges and evolves, and become familiar with the international film industry of the 1920s, covering topics like its commercial structure, major directors, stars, landmark films and aesthetic developments. This will give you context for understanding the complexities of Hollywood’s journey to dominance and the rise of cinematic nationalism after the end of World War I. We’ll also explore how issues of class and gender come to the fore at particular moments of social upheaval and cultural crisis in this era.\n\nTopics might include: The magical attractions of early cinema; D.W. Griffith and the emergence of a narrative grammar; the evolution of slapstick; serial pleasures; the emergence of feature films; classical Hollywood cinema in the 1920s; cinema and modernity; the mobilisation of ‘Film Europe’; silents in the age of sound; the aesthetics of silent cinema\n\nWhat you might watch? The Impossible Voyage (Méliès, 1904); A Drunkard’s Reformation (Biograph, 1909); Last of the Line (Domino, 1914); Mr. Flip (Essanay, 1909); The Tramp (Essanay, 1915); The Perils of Pauline (Pathé, 1914); Traffic in Souls (Universal, 1913); The Cheat (Lasky, 1915); Intolerance (Fine Arts, 1916); Steamboat Bill, Jr. (Charles F. Reisner, 1928); It (Clarence Badger, 1927); Man With a Movie Camera (Dziga Vertov, 1929); The Last Laugh (F.W. Murnau, 1924); La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc (Carl T. Dreyer, 1928); Sunrise (F.W. Murnau, 1927); Piccadilly (E.A. Dupont, 1929)\n\nTelevision is dead. Television is everyday. Television is everywhere. Television is online. Television is domestic. Television is spectacular. Television is public. Television is all this and more.\n\nIn this module, you’ll unpick and complicate some of the accepted cultural positions about what television is and what it does. Building upon your introduction to television studies in the Visual Cultures module in Year One, this module will deepen your understanding of television as a historical, critical and theoretical object of study. It comes at a particularly key moment in the discipline’s history, as new technologies once again threaten our understanding of this complex, yet everyday, object.\n\nThe focus will be on exploring a wide range of examples from television’s early years to the present day, and on giving opportunities for you to engage critically with some of the most interesting work in television studies, including both foundational work of the discipline and cutting-edge research into this ever-changing medium.\n\nTopics and texts change each year in line with staff research interests and expertise, and you’ll be encouraged to become a co-creator in new work. Recent topics have included regionalism, children’s television and music television.\n\nYou’ll develop key skills in the close analysis of television and its texts, and be introduced to a range of theoretical concepts and methodologies of television studies. You’ll emerge with a complex understanding of television as a textual, institutional, historical and cultural object.\n\nWhat might you watch? Doctor Who, Brideshead Revisited, Happy Valley, Sherlock, Poldark, The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Band of Brothers, Game of Thrones, The West Wing, Lost, Breaking Bad, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Stranger Things, Arena, Panorama, Driving School, Made in Chelsea, Wife Swap, Geordie Shore, Ghostwatch, The Day Britain Stopped, Modern Family, The Office, A History of Britain, Who Do You Think You Are, Downton Abbey, The Great British Bake-Off, Planet Earth, Cunk on Britain.\n\nSee sample reading lists: Term 1 and Term 2\n\nThis intensive third-year module will help you to develop your understanding of the practice of short film production through the opportunity to work on the development of a self-devised short fiction film. It will provide you with intensive coaching in the preparation and development of a viable film treatment or script, and offer intensive workshop practice in the various essential skills related to the practice of filmmaking: cinematography, sound and editing. It will give you a solid and meaningful working experience of the collaborative nature of the practice of film production. You will work in groups of 3-4 with all being given the chance to direct as well as practice other skills. It will also provide you with an understanding of the administrative and legalistic aspects of film production.\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have gained training and experience in the various elements of short film production via a demonstrable portfolio of practical skills related to direction, cinematography, sound, lighting, editing and production management. You will have produced a viable film treatment or script that will have informed the production of a 6-8 minute fiction film. You will have developed practical skills in creative thinking and planning on both an individual and group basis, and developed skills in collaborative teamwork. You will have gained practical experience in planning and managing the relevant legalistic and health and safety elements of short film production. You will have developed skills in constructing a reflective piece of critical writing that will relate to both the critical intentions of an individual film project and the nature of the learning experience that has generated the project.\n\nThis module is in collaboration with London Film School: find out more\n\nVisit us on Vimeo\n\nThe interconnected genres of horror and the Gothic have a long and fascinating history in film and television. The study of these genres has also produced some of the most ground-breaking work in the academic disciplines of film and television studies.\n\nTogether, we’ll consider questions of genre, address and medium specificity. What is the history of Gothic and horror programming on television, and how might we understand the recent upsurge in the production and broadcast of this genre? How have Gothic and horror films – both contemporary and classic –been understood in critical literature? And how have recent changes in production, distribution and exhibition of horror cinema impacted upon the genre and its aesthetics?\n\nYou’ll be devising your own research project around these topics. Students relish the opportunity to get stuck into research (and make their tutor watch some really gruesome films and programmes!)\n\nAlternatively, this innovative module is designed to get you thinking about the place of film and television in the wider community, and you may be assessed by designing a film season which is accompanied by critical commentary on the horror film festival.\n\nWhat might you watch? Frankenstein, America Horrory Story, Taste the Blood of Dracula, Eden Lake, Rebecca, Dark Water, Remember Me, Babadook, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, The Thing, Anatomy for Beginners, Hannibal, The Swan, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, In the Flesh\n\nFind out more with our indicative reading lists: Term 1\n\nFilm can make us laugh. It can make us cry. It can make us care. Film can move us, but can it affect or even effect change? This module explores the potential of film to impact upon personal, social and political experiences and events. John Grierson called the filmmaker a ‘propagandist’; Third Cinema hailed him or her a ‘revolutionary’. More recently, Linda Williams, in re-defining all ‘film’ as melodrama, distinguished it as the medium of emotion. We will be concerned with the convergence of these three, of ideology, resistance and feeling, within our developing understanding of how film might alter the attitudes or actions of its audience.\n\nFilm and Social Change will look at how various film theories – such as spectatorship, post-colonial and ethical theory - refigure the agency of those watching, and how various film movements, filmmakers and film practices reanimate this agency for socio-political goals. Moving from mainstream paradigms to much lauded counter-narratives to more marginal propositions, new technologies and platforms will become increasingly significant as we track an alternative history of the power of film into the Digital Age.\n\nWhat might you watch? King Kong, Bhaji on the Beach, The Color Purple, Hooligan Sparrow, The Battle of Algiers, Paris is Burning, Boys Don't Cry, The Five Obstructions, I Daniel Blake, City of Ghosts, The Act of Killing,\n\nFind out more with our indicative reading lists: Term 1\n\nThis module explores the silent period in Europe and America – a period in which some of the most important films, filmmakers and filmmaking trends emerged.
