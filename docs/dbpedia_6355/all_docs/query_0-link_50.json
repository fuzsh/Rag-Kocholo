We discuss the city’s museum exhibits and public murals, parks and cemeteries, memorial monuments and statues, photographs and speeches, drama and prose fiction, and protests and social movements from the 19th through the 21st centuries as depicted film and print. The protest and social movement unit of the course considers, in addition to contemporary protests and social movements, anti-slavery and women's rights movements in the 19th century, and protests for racial justice and the organization of FIGHT in the 1960s. We become familiar with models in the humanities for reading, viewing, and analyzing these objects, spaces, and events, and we practice our interpretative skills in class discussion and in journals. Students also learn about digital resources for presenting their work (Omeka, StoryMaps) and, if they find these resources useful, have the option of incorporating them into their writing assignments.\n\nSatisfies the “additional survey or approach course” in the British and American Literature track of the English major. Satisfies a requirement in the following Humanities/English cluster: Media, Culture, and Communication. This course is appropriate for all students.

Greek tragedy and comedy: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes. The Hebrew Bible -- Abraham and Isaac, Moses and Pharaoh, Esther and Judith -- and Christianity's New Testament. The two great traditions studied in this introductory course -- classical and Biblical -- have been pondered by generations of writers and artists for thousands of years. A great deal of literary history is the story of intricately rewriting and adapting the core texts of these traditions; it has been said that the European philosophical tradition is a series of footnotes to Plato. While doing justice to any one of these authors or traditions in a single semester would be a challenge, the goal of this class is to read as much as possible of the classical and scriptural tradition in the short time we have, giving you a solid introduction to some of the key stories and ideas that have generated so much thought, conflict, and human creativity over the past two dozen centuries.

Through a close textual analysis of 'Inferno,' and the first half of 'Purgatorio,' students learn how to approach Dantes poetry as a vehicle for thought, an instrument of self-discovery, and a way to understand and affect the historical reality. They also gain a perspective on the Biblical, Christian, and Classical traditions as they intersect with the multiple levels of Dantes concern, ranging from literature to history, from politics to government, from philosophy to theology. A visual component, including illustrations of the 'Comedy' and multiple artworks pertinent to the narrative, complements the course.

An ever-changing entity that emerges from various oral and literary sources. Demons? Fallen angels?, Elementals? This course examines the figure of the Fairy in antiquity, medieval, renaissance, and twentieth-century texts for the liminality, category crisis, gender, poetic inspiration and allegory this figure inspires, as well as its social, political, and religious controversies in early English and Celtic ballads and romances. The Fairy signals both instability and literary self-fashioning in the grafting of histories and genealogies upon fairy ancestors (Melusine, The Fairie Queene) care-takers of “nature” (Midsummer Night's Dream); and both childhood and loss in later poetry (Keats, Yeats, Conan Doyle) Throughout time, readers have been fascinated by a “hidden people” not entirely foreign, evil, or human who abduct them, deceive them, seduce them, and make them poets.

We learn about the literary and theatrical conventions that would have been second nature to Shakespeare and his audience over 400 years ago and consider how Renaissance stage practices might help us to better understand his plays and better appreciate why Renaissance audiences found them so compelling. When possible, we consult video of recent staged productions. This course is appropriate for all students, from those in their first semester at the university to senior English majors.

Virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technologies, collectively known as extended reality (XR), build on existing digital networking models and are also immersive. Research is ongoing about how networked digital spaces, such as social media, foster or destroy community, create or alleviate loneliness, and contribute to new knowledge or greater confusion. Understanding the impact of these technologies on our communications grows even more important as the possibility of the metaverse, a space where we would lead digital-first lives in XR, advances. We will read research from across disciplines, including philosophy, legal studies, data science, and engineering. Our investigation won't be limited to scholarship - venture capitalists have written some of the most recent and influential books about the metaverse, the term was coined in Stephenson's 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, and no metaverse course would be complete without a viewing of The Matrix. As we explore the impact of XR, we will also investigate how the proliferation of digital spaces increases our reliance on digital communications tools and engagement with artificial intelligence (Al). Students will create short written projects throughout the semester that experiment with writing in extended reality and with Al tools. The semester will culminate in a final project centered around student interests in XR and communication.\n\nLocation\n\nLechase Room 122 (TR 11:05AM - 12:20PM)\n\nENGL 223-1\n\nBette London\n\nMW 11:50AM - 1:05PM\n\nThe nineteenth-century novel is usually associated with Victorian values: happy marriage; wholesome homes; moral propriety; properly channeled emotions and ambitions. Many of the most popular novels, however, paint a very different picture: with madwomen locked in attics and asylums; monsters, real and imagined, lurking behind the façade of propriety; genteel homes harboring opium addicts; fallen women walking the streets; and sexual transgression and degeneracy popping up everywhere. Indeed, for novels centrally structured around marriage and society, madness and monstrosity appear with alarming regularity. The intertwining of these tropes suggests some of the cultural anxieties unleashed by the new body of women writers and women readers. We will begin with Frankenstein and end with Dracula, two novels from opposite ends of the century. We will also consider such classic marriage plot novels as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre and some popular sensation fiction of the 1860s.\n\nLocation\n\nBausch & Lomb Room 270 (MW 11:50AM - 1:05PM)\n\nENGL 225-1\n\nJohn Michael\n\nMW 12:30PM - 1:45PM\n\nIn this class we will ask what U. S. literature and art of the first half of the nineteenth century has to say to readers today. This period has often been described as the first moment of greatness in American culture. Like today, it was a period of great political strife. In the nineteenth century that strife culminated in a catastrophic Civil War. Like today, the nation was riven by deep regional and ideological divisions and struggling to reconcile its many contradictions. Dedicated to principles of liberty but dependent on enslaved labor, celebrating equality but denying women’s rights and holding black Americans in bondage, championing justice for all but expropriating Native lands, promising a more perfect union but increasingly pulling apart along sectional and class lines, pursuing happiness but increasingly in doubt about how one should live. In the midst of these controversies and tensions, writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry David Thoreau, Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, Harriet Jacobs, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, Edgar Allan Poe and Lydia Maria Child and Abraham Lincoln as well as a generation of American painters created fiction and poetry, essays and speeches and paintings of great power and inventiveness that also wrestled with the political and ethical crises of its day. The hopes that these artists invested in art’s power to inspire and guide national and reform personal redemption is one way they remain relevant today.\n\nLocation\n\nHylan Building Room 305 (MW 12:30PM - 1:45PM)\n\nENGL 227-01\n\nJohn Michael\n\nMW 2:00PM - 3:15PM\n\nIn this course we will consider the special contributions of black intellectuals to the culture and controversies of America and the Atlantic world focusing on the twentieth century and the contemporary moment. Analyses and criticisms of racial identity, national belonging, political theory, artistic expression, and gender politics will focus our discussions. Works by W. E. B. DuBois, Booker T.

This course will provide a survey of the literature and culture that reflect the spirit of that era. In addition, the course will consider recent African-American fiction in order to ascertain what the Harlem Renaissance has meant for subsequent writers and artists. Special attention will be paid to the following topics: migration, jazz, the Blues, literary modernism, theories of black identity, and difference within black America. Readings include works by Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Jean Toomer, George Schuyler, Toni Morrison, Samuel R. Delany, and more.

Studying science fiction, fantasy, and horror from across Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America, this course will focus on how 20th and 21st century artists have reimagined black life after slavery and empire. We’ll study a range of artistic forms, including fiction, film, visual art, and music, by artists like Octavia Butler, Wanuri Kahiu, Nalo Hopkinson, Jordan Peele, and Wangechi Mutu. We’ll look at how artists of color contort the world we know, and how they use the speculative mode to pose deeply philosophical and historical questions.\n\nLocation\n\nGoergen Hall Room 110 (TR 11:05AM - 12:20PM)\n\nENGL 232A-1\n\nDmitrii Bykov\n\nTR 2:00PM - 3:15PM\n\nThe popularity of thrillers have always hinged upon the subconscious readers’ and viewers’ choice of most talented authors. Talent is not essential for one’s making a reader laugh or cry, but in order to scare the audience, authors need to understand the foundations of psyche and literature, and of life in general. What does the notion of the Gothic entail? What are the main thriller devices? Why does the violation of logical connections and psychological laws frighten the reader? Where do the roots of our interest to pathology lie? What role does rhythm play in inciting horror? And how do the concepts of thriller, horror, and suspense relate to one another? How does the composition of thrillers draw the actual horror into the writer’s own life and how does it protect you from the uncanny? What role does the poetic and the mysterious play in the Gothic art, and why does Romantic art in particular poeticizes fear most often? What plots and schemes are most usable in modern suspense? What is the general difference between thriller, horror and suspense? Can panic become a kind of sinful pleasure? There are no definitive answers to all these questions, and yet, the theme of thriller aesthetics remains one of the most appealing in literary studies and creative writing. This course will help you overcome your personal fears by transforming them into literary texts. It will also help you foresee those cinematic moments when the entire audience shakes with fear and begins to scream.

A central focus of the course will be the literature itself, but we will also look at some of the controversies the prize has generated – including the recent sex scandal that led to the prize’s temporary suspension. We will consider how receipt of the prize changed writers' lives and literary reputations, and we will track the announcement of a new prize-winner in October 2024. In the U.S., where less than 5% of the literature published each year is literature in translation, Nobel prize-winning literature is often the only modern literature Americans read in translation. This raises the question of translation and the role of the Nobel Prize in creating and promoting an international literature. We will also consider the special challenges this literature poses for its readers in speaking to both local and global audiences. Some of the readings for the class will be chosen by the students.\n\nLocation\n\nGoergen Hall Room 110 (MW 3:25PM - 4:40PM)\n\nENGL 240-2\n\nDavid Bleich\n\nTR 9:40AM - 10:55AM\n\nThis course addresses questions such as these: Do species have “origins”? Does the universe have a beginning? What is meant by “creation”? Are “fundamental” particles related to religious fundamentalism? Is cognitive science connected to the “tree of knowledge”? Are “knowledge” and “truth” key terms in both science and religion? Are there “higher” and “lower” organisms? Do mothers have “instincts”? Are people smarter than other animals? Have “instincts” and “intelligence” been identified by science? Does a sperm “penetrate” or “fertilize” an egg? Do either God or Nature have “laws”? Is “the invisible hand” a religious idea? Is “the great chain of being” a religious idea, and did Darwin overtake it? Do people need to be “saved”? Is “evil” a “problem”? How do people describe the practices of circumcision and communion?

Though published during the nineteenth century, his novels continue to be the subject of countless film, television, and stage adaptations to the present day. Dickens’s novels are so much a part of the popular imagination that even those who have not read his novels are often familiar with their characters and scenes—from poor orphaned Oliver Twist asking for more porridge to miserly Ebenezer Scrooge saying “Bah! Humbug!” during Christmas. Central to Dickens’s appeal among audiences past and present is his distinctive “Dickensian” style. When we describe a novel as Dickensian, it elicits numerous associations—complex and mysterious plots, a cast of characters who are all somehow connected, vibrant depictions of cityscape and social life, comedic characterizations, social satire, and sentimentalism, to name a few. In this course we will read a variety of Dickens’s major novels in order to appreciate his vision and style as a writer and thus learn, first hand, why his novels continue to attract audiences and what it means to describe a novel as Dickensian. While the focus will be primarily on Dickens’s novels, the course will also examine a twentieth-century novel that critics have labeled Dickensian and address Dickens's influence on long-form serial television (e.g. The Wire).

We will examine the cinema as a set of aesthetic, social, technological, national, cultural and industrial practices as they were exercised and developed during this 30-year span. We will explore the diverse forms cinema took and functions it performed during this period by looking closely at a range of films and writings about films and film culture. We will also examine contexts within which these films were produced and experienced as well as theorizations of cinema that emerged concurrently with them. The course thus introduces students to the study of film history as well as a key national and international trends in making and thinking about cinema as it rose to prominence as a vital component of the art and culture of the twentieth century.

Using the lens of the Plantation, we will connect contemporary social and environmental problems like climate change, racial injustice, Big Ag, and global inequality to the colonization of people, animals, plants, and the planet, to the turning of biodiverse cultures and ecosystems into cash-crop factories, animals into raw materials, and people into displaced workers. In the process, we will cover many well-known but little-understood topics, including biotech, chemical inputs, fast/processed food, and GMOs, as well as critical theories that illuminate the cultural frameworks that shape perceptions of food, including modernization, decolonization, animal rights, and neoliberalism.\n\nINSTRUCTOR PERMISSION REQUIRED.\n\nLocation\n\nLechase Room 160 (MW 3:25PM - 4:40PM)\n\nENGL 311-01\n\nLin Meng Walsh\n\nTR 6:15PM - 7:30PM\n\nThis course introduces students to the rich body of disaster literature and cinema in Japan. We will explore how Japanese artists creatively reflected on themes of loss, grief, trauma, survival, and healing; we will critically analyze how disaster writings and films probe the issues of socio-political infrastructure as well as human pain and strength. Described as events that cause “the breach of collective expectations in institutions and practices that make everyday life work” (Curato and Corpus Ong 2015), the “disasters” we encounter in this class include both natural and human-generated calamities such as fire, earthquake, war, atomic bombing, and epidemic. Also covered in this class are writings on “imagined disasters” as found in science fiction and dystopian fantasy (for example, the 1973 novel Japan Sinks by Komatsu Sakyō and its parody “The World Sinks Except Japan” by Tsutsui Yasutaka).\n\nLocation\n\nFrederick Douglass Room 420 (TR 6:15PM - 7:30PM)\n\nENGL 312-1\n\nLin Meng Walsh\n\nMW 7:40PM - 8:55PM\n\nThis course surveys women’s literature in East Asia from the classical to the contemporary period. Through a diverse selection of women’s writings that encompass classical poetry, proletariat literature, war novels, and science fiction, students explore how women writers actively engaged with their respective societies during various points in history. Students will also gain critical insights into the issue of how “women’s literature” can be constructed within different frameworks such as history, social-political freedom, gender identity, commercial publishing, and artistic expression. While studying their writings and diverse voices, we meditate on these underlying questions: what is “women’s literature”? When and how can it be a productive category, and when is it not?\n\nAll readings will be in English; knowledge of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean is welcome but not required.\n\nLocation\n\nMeliora Room 206 (MW 7:40PM - 8:55PM)\n\nENGL 337-01\n\nErik Larsen\n\nW 2:00PM - 4:30PM\n\nThroughout much of modern medical and cultural history, bodily difference has been categorized as disability—as a problematic deviation from standards of normalcy and health. This legacy has been fiercely debated and contested in recent years, with much disagreement about the category’s usefulness in medical contexts and beyond. This course will explore different perspectives on disability through works of modern culture, and primarily through literature, television, and film. We will investigate the traditional medical model of disability, and explore what changing understandings of disability mean for the future of healthcare and the relationship between healthcare providers and patients. The course is writing-intensive, and requires students to share and workshop their papers with peers.\n\nLocation\n\n(W 2:00PM - 4:30PM)\n\nENGL 360-1\n\nNigel Maister; Katherine Hamilton (Terminated)\n\n7:00PM - 7:00PM\n\nIn Special Projects: Theatre students work in a particular area or on a particular project of their choosing or devising.

While this history will have a place in our course, we will primarily investigate comedy in film and television of the 20th and 21st centuries. We will explore critical issues related to comedy, including the function and meaning of laughter and jokes; moments of comic relief; the relationship of comedy to community and crisis; love, sexuality, and romance; the role of the body and whether comedy is a \"body genre\"; how race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class get messily mediated by comedy; the difference of comedy from other modes such as tragedy, horror, and realism; and the varying tones comedy can have from dark to light, serious to fun, and comforting to disturbing.

It would seem easy to understand how a visual medium like film imitates aspects of our everyday life, but how do novels using nothing but words conjure an entire world in a reader’s mind that feel so real? This course explores these questions and others as it takes up the genre of the realist novel as it developed over the course of the nineteenth century. We will closely read and discuss some of the most exemplary practitioners of the realist novel within the British and Continental tradition, from Jane Austen and Honoré de Balzac to George Eliot. The course will examine the aesthetics of realism and how realist fiction’s promise to show the reader what the world is like assumed a different form among varied novelists. Students will be exposed to theories of realism, past and present, and will also deepen their understanding of varied canonical novelists.

Starting with lessons in philandering and sex from the Roman love poet Ovid, and the adulterous rules of love of the medieval priest and courtier Andreas Capellanus, we will turn to stories of hot pants in high places in medieval Latin comedy, troubadour poetry and the romance narratives of Chrétien de Troyes, Marie de France, Walter Map, and the Gawain Poet. Finally, we will end with the medieval revival of the 18th century and the neo-medieval courtly rules of La Curne de St. Palaye upon which the standards of modern polite behavior and ideals of masculinity are based.\n\nLocation\n\nLechase Room 184 (MW 2:00PM - 3:15PM)\n\nENGL 390-1\n\nFrederick Fletcher\n\n7:00PM - 7:00PM\n\nBlank Description\n\nLocation\n\n( 7:00PM - 7:00PM)\n\nENGL 391-02\n\nKatherine Hamilton\n\n7:00PM - 7:00PM\n\nA course of reading, research, and writing on topics not covered by the existing curriculum, developed between the student and a faculty advisor.\n\nLocation\n\n( 7:00PM - 7:00PM)\n\nENGL 391-1\n\n\n\n7:00PM - 7:00PM\n\nA course of reading, research, and writing on topics not covered by the existing curriculum, developed between the student and a faculty advisor.\n\nRegistration for Independent Study courses needs to be completed thru the instructions for online independent study registration.\n\nLocation\n\n( 7:00PM - 7:00PM)\n\nENGL 392-1\n\nNigel Maister\n\n7:00PM - 7:00PM\n\nAdvanced Stage Management Practicum is designed for, and available only to students fulfilling the roll of a Production Stage Manager on a mainstage Theatre Program production.\n\nRegistration for Independent Study courses needs to be completed thru the instructions for online independent study registration.\n\nLocation\n\n( 7:00PM - 7:00PM)\n\nENGL 394-1\n\nAlbert Memmott\n\n7:00PM - 7:00PM\n\nRegistration for Independent Study courses needs to be completed thru the instructions for online independent study registration.\n\nLocation\n\n( 7:00PM - 7:00PM)\n\nENGL 394C-01\n\nCurtis Smith\n\n7:00PM - 7:00PM\n\nNo description\n\nLocation\n\n( 7:00PM - 7:00PM)\n\nENGL 396-1\n\nMatthew Omelsky\n\nTR 2:00PM - 3:15PM\n\nThe Fall 2024 English honors seminar will concentrate on a wide range of readings in fiction, theory, and criticism, as well the process and practice of writing itself.

Eric Hayot’s Elements of Academic Style will give us tools for our critical writing practice, and ways of seeing how criticism is constructed. Finally, alongside a selection of poetry and prose by writers like Toni Morrison and Audre Lorde, we’ll read Claudia Tate’s immensely influential edited volume of interviews, Black Women Writers at Work, to gain a sense of how some of the most celebrated American poets and fiction writers of the last half century have gone about their craft.\n\nLocation\n\nHylan Building Room 305 (TR 2:00PM - 3:15PM)\n\nENGL 399-1\n\n\n\n7:00PM - 7:00PM\n\nBlank Description\n\nLocation\n\n( 7:00PM - 7:00PM)\n\nMonday\n\nENGL 145-1\n\nEsther Winter\n\nDo you want to be on stage and screen, but wonder if you have the skills to land a gig?

This introductory course will explore the theories, methods, and safe practice of set construction (including using power tools), rigging, stage lighting, drafting, sound, and scene painting. Students will work on actual productions staged by the Theatre Program during required labs that will be scheduled with the instructor.\n\nENGL 103-1\n\nRosemary Kegl\n\nThis course introduces students to Rochester, NY, through the eyes of the humanities. We discuss the city’s museum exhibits and public murals, parks and cemeteries, memorial monuments and statues, photographs and speeches, drama and prose fiction, and protests and social movements from the 19th through the 21st centuries as depicted film and print. The protest and social movement unit of the course considers, in addition to contemporary protests and social movements, anti-slavery and women's rights movements in the 19th century, and protests for racial justice and the organization of FIGHT in the 1960s. We become familiar with models in the humanities for reading, viewing, and analyzing these objects, spaces, and events, and we practice our interpretative skills in class discussion and in journals. Students also learn about digital resources for presenting their work (Omeka, StoryMaps) and, if they find these resources useful, have the option of incorporating them into their writing assignments.\n\nSatisfies the “additional survey or approach course” in the British and American Literature track of the English major.

This course will provide a survey of the literature and culture that reflect the spirit of that era. In addition, the course will consider recent African-American fiction in order to ascertain what the Harlem Renaissance has meant for subsequent writers and artists. Special attention will be paid to the following topics: migration, jazz, the Blues, literary modernism, theories of black identity, and difference within black America. Readings include works by Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Jean Toomer, George Schuyler, Toni Morrison, Samuel R. Delany, and more. Requirements include class participation, six 1-page reading responses, and two 6-8-page formal writing assignments.\n\nENGL 223-1\n\nBette London\n\nThe nineteenth-century novel is usually associated with Victorian values: happy marriage; wholesome homes; moral propriety; properly channeled emotions and ambitions. Many of the most popular novels, however, paint a very different picture: with madwomen locked in attics and asylums; monsters, real and imagined, lurking behind the façade of propriety; genteel homes harboring opium addicts; fallen women walking the streets; and sexual transgression and degeneracy popping up everywhere. Indeed, for novels centrally structured around marriage and society, madness and monstrosity appear with alarming regularity. The intertwining of these tropes suggests some of the cultural anxieties unleashed by the new body of women writers and women readers. We will begin with Frankenstein and end with Dracula, two novels from opposite ends of the century. We will also consider such classic marriage plot novels as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre and some popular sensation fiction of the 1860s.\n\nENGL 212-01\n\nLeila Nadir\n\nIn this course we will read famous novels by American Black and indigenous writers Toni Morrison, Jamaica Kincaid, Linda Hogan, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Jesmyn Ward, studying the role of story and literature in understanding the psychic, soul, and spiritual impacts of colonialism. Interconnected topics we will likely cover include memory, trauma, family, folklore, ancestors, justice, wilderness, slavery, occupation, addiction, eco-tourism, flying, civil rights, reproductive rights, health care, magical realism, climate change, hurricanes, mining, the Great Migration, the body, sustainability, animals, capitalism, extraction, war, violence, survival, and healing.\n\nINSTRUCTOR PERMISSION REQUIRED.\n\nENGL 225-1\n\nJohn Michael\n\nIn this class we will ask what U. S. literature and art of the first half of the nineteenth century has to say to readers today. This period has often been described as the first moment of greatness in American culture. Like today, it was a period of great political strife. In the nineteenth century that strife culminated in a catastrophic Civil War. Like today, the nation was riven by deep regional and ideological divisions and struggling to reconcile its many contradictions. Dedicated to principles of liberty but dependent on enslaved labor, celebrating equality but denying women’s rights and holding black Americans in bondage, championing justice for all but expropriating Native lands, promising a more perfect union but increasingly pulling apart along sectional and class lines, pursuing happiness but increasingly in doubt about how one should live. In the midst of these controversies and tensions, writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry David Thoreau, Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, Harriet Jacobs, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, Edgar Allan Poe and Lydia Maria Child and Abraham Lincoln as well as a generation of American painters created fiction and poetry, essays and speeches and paintings of great power and inventiveness that also wrestled with the political and ethical crises of its day. The hopes that these artists invested in art’s power to inspire and guide national and reform personal redemption is one way they remain relevant today.\n\nENGL 245-01\n\nStephen Schottenfeld\n\nMore broadly, a study of the gray zone between short story and novel, containing many ambiguous labels (long short story, novella, short novel). The course will interrogate various boundaries – When does a short story become a novella? When does a novella become a novel? –\n\nand locate answers not merely in word count, but in reader experience and expectation. Because of the (relative) brevity of these in-between texts, the course will cover much stylistic and geographic ground. Author list may include: Franz Kafka, Victor LaValle, Don DeLillo, Carson McCullers, Nathanael West, Gabriel García Márquez, Henry James, Danielle Evans, George Saunders, Garth Greenwell, Mieko Kawakami, Aleksandar Hemon, William Gass, and Cynthia Ozick.\n\nENGL 267-4\n\nChad Post\n\nThis course runs in combination with an internship at Open Letter Books and focuses on explaining the basics of the business of literary publishing: editing, marketing, promoting, fundraising, ebooks, the future of bookselling, etc. Literature in translation is emphasized in this class, and all the topics covered tie in with the various projects interns work on for Open Letter Books.\n\nENGL 285-01\n\nStefanie Sydelnik\n\nPrerequisites: Interested students must apply. Minimum GPA of 3.0.\n\nPrepares sophomores, juniors, and seniors enrolled in five-year programs, from the humanities, sciences, and the social sciences for work as writing fellows. Course design facilitates the development of a strong, intuitive writer and speaker in order to become a successful reader, listener and responder in peer-tutoring situations. Ample writing and rewriting experiences, practice in informal and formal speaking, and the critical reading of published essays and student work enhance students' ability to become conscious, flexible communicators. Before tutoring on their own, students observe writing fellows and writing center consultants conduct tutoring sessions. On completion of the course with a B or better, fellows should be prepared to accept their own hours as peer tutors.\n\nYOU MUST REGISTER FOR A RECITATION WHEN REGISTERING FOR THE MAIN SECTION\n\nENGL 112-2\n\nSteven Rozenski\n\nHomer, Virgil, and Ovid. Greek tragedy and comedy: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes. The Hebrew Bible -- Abraham and Isaac, Moses and Pharaoh, Esther and Judith -- and Christianity's New Testament. The two great traditions studied in this introductory course -- classical and Biblical -- have been pondered by generations of writers and artists for thousands of years. A great deal of literary history is the story of intricately rewriting and adapting the core texts of these traditions; it has been said that the European philosophical tradition is a series of footnotes to Plato. While doing justice to any one of these authors or traditions in a single semester would be a challenge, the goal of this class is to read as much as possible of the classical and scriptural tradition in the short time we have, giving you a solid introduction to some of the key stories and ideas that have generated so much thought, conflict, and human creativity over the past two dozen centuries. First-years welcome! .\n\nENGL 135-1\n\nFrederick Fletcher\n\nThe purpose of this course is to give students an appreciation for and knowledge of critical thinking and reasoned decision-making through argumentation. Students will research both sides of a topic, write argument briefs, and participate in formal and informal debates. Students will also be exposed to the major paradigms used in judging debates. Applicable English Cluster: Media, Culture, and Communication [H1ENG016]\n\nENGL 210-1\n\nRosemary Kegl\n\nThis class explores the full range of Shakespeare's theater, including examples of comedies, history plays, tragedies, and “romances.” We approach the plays from many angles, looking at their stark and extravagant language; their invention of complex conflicted human characters; their self-conscious references to contemporary stage practices; and their meditations on death, love, politics, power, and revenge. We learn about the literary and theatrical conventions that would have been second nature to Shakespeare and his audience over 400 years ago and consider how Renaissance stage practices might help us to better understand his plays and better appreciate why Renaissance audiences found them so compelling. When possible, we consult video of recent staged productions. This course is appropriate for all students, from those in their first semester at the university to senior English majors. No restrictions or prerequisites; all are welcome. It fulfills the pre-1800 requirement for the English major and satisfies a requirement in two English Clusters (Great Books, Great Authors; Plays, Playwrights, and Theater).\n\nENGL 227-01\n\nJohn Michael\n\nIn this course we will consider the special contributions of black intellectuals to the culture and controversies of America and the Atlantic world focusing on the twentieth century and the contemporary moment. Analyses and criticisms of racial identity, national belonging, political theory, artistic expression, and gender politics will focus our discussions. Works by W. E. B. DuBois, Booker T. Washington, Francis Harper, Nella Larson, George Schuyler, Frantz Fanon, C. L. R. James, Paul Gilroy, Aimé César, Eduard Glissant, Stuart Hall, Toni Morrison, Spike Lee, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Léopold Senghor, Hortense Spillers, Cedric Robinson, and Claudia Rankine will figure prominently in our discussions, as will the more general question of the political and social role of intellectuals in the modern world, the problem of elitism in democratic societies, and the crucial, leading role black writers and artists have played in defining and shaping our modern era.\n\nENGL 265-1\n\nSharon Willis\n\nThis course explores Hollywood's fascination with race and gender as social issues and as spectacles. In particular, we will focus on the ways that social difference have become the sites of conflicted narrative and visual interactions in our films. To examine competing representations of racial difference and sexual difference in US culture, we analyze popular films from the 1950s to the present.\n\nENGL 277-1\n\nPirooz Kalayeh\n\nAn introduction and practice to writing professionally formatted scripts used in short films and webisodes. Emphasis will be placed on writing short-form scripts and how to discuss and analyze key elements of scriptwriting and visual storytelling.\n\nENGL 380-3\n\nGregory Heyworth\n\nHow did advice for chatting up girls (and guys) in ancient Rome morph into a knightly code of conduct in love and war in the Middle Ages, and from there into ideas of masculinity, femininity, and politeness in modern society? Starting with lessons in philandering and sex from the Roman love poet Ovid, and the adulterous rules of love of the medieval priest and courtier Andreas Capellanus, we will turn to stories of hot pants in high places in medieval Latin comedy, troubadour poetry and the romance narratives of Chrétien de Troyes, Marie de France, Walter Map, and the Gawain Poet. Finally, we will end with the medieval revival of the 18th century and the neo-medieval courtly rules of La Curne de St. Palaye upon which the standards of modern polite behavior and ideals of masculinity are based.\n\nENGL 113-01\n\nRosemary Kegl\n\nThis course immerses students in the most influential and engaging writings from the earlier periods of English literature. Our aim will be to enjoy and understand these writings in themselves, and then to see their relation to each other and to their larger literary and historical contexts. Students should leave the course with some real affection for particular writings, and some assured sense of the contours and highlights of literary and cultural history. Our emphasis will be on careful analysis of the language and texture of the works we study. Authors include Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, Jonson, Milton, Dryden, Swift, Pope. This course is appropriate for all students. No requirements or prerequisites.\n\nENGL 205-1\n\nDonatella Stocchi-Perucchio\n\nThe first of a sequence of two, the course approaches 'The Divine Comedy' both as a poetic masterpiece and as an encyclopedia of medieval culture. Through a close textual analysis of 'Inferno,' and the first half of 'Purgatorio,' students learn how to approach Dantes poetry as a vehicle for thought, an instrument of self-discovery, and a way to understand and affect the historical reality. They also gain a perspective on the Biblical, Christian, and Classical traditions as they intersect with the multiple levels of Dantes concern, ranging from literature to history, from politics to government, from philosophy to theology. A visual component, including illustrations of the 'Comedy' and multiple artworks pertinent to the narrative, complements the course. Class format includes lectures, discussion, and a weekly recitation session. Intensive class participation is encouraged. Dante I can be taken independently from Dante II. No prerequisites. Freshmen are welcome. Part of the Dante Humanities Cluster.\n\nENGL 236-1\n\nBette London\n\nThis course will provide an opportunity to sample an exciting body of contemporary literature, some written by authors already widely acclaimed when they received the Nobel Prize and some by writers suddenly catapulted into fame and international recognition. A central focus of the course will be the literature itself, but we will also look at some of the controversies the prize has generated – including the recent sex scandal that led to the prize’s temporary suspension. We will consider how receipt of the prize changed writers' lives and literary reputations, and we will track the announcement of a new prize-winner in October 2024. In the U.S., where less than 5% of the literature published each year is literature in translation, Nobel prize-winning literature is often the only modern literature Americans read in translation. This raises the question of translation and the role of the Nobel Prize in creating and promoting an international literature. We will also consider the special challenges this literature poses for its readers in speaking to both local and global audiences. Some of the readings for the class will be chosen by the students.\n\nENGL 256-1\n\nSharon Willis\n\nA transnational survey of film history, examining the technical and formal aspects of the medium in its production and exhibition. Same as FMS 248\n\nENGL 310-1\n\nLeila Nadir\n\nThis course studies the cultural, economic, and ecological structures of the industrial food system–from its origins in the slave economies of sugar plantations in the colonial era to current-day monocultures of corn, soy, and palm oil spanning the globe. Using the lens of the Plantation, we will connect contemporary social and environmental problems like climate change, racial injustice, Big Ag, and global inequality to the colonization of people, animals, plants, and the planet, to the turning of biodiverse cultures and ecosystems into cash-crop factories, animals into raw materials, and people into displaced workers. In the process, we will cover many well-known but little-understood topics, including biotech, chemical inputs, fast/processed food, and GMOs, as well as critical theories that illuminate the cultural frameworks that shape perceptions of food, including modernization, decolonization, animal rights, and neoliberalism.\n\nINSTRUCTOR PERMISSION REQUIRED.\n\nENGL 161-1\n\nPirooz Kalayeh\n\nThis course introduces the basic aesthetic and technical elements of video production. Emphasis is on the creative use and understanding of the video medium while learning to use the video camera, video editing processes and the fundamental procedures of planning video projects. Strategies for the use of video as an art-making tool will be explored. Works by artists and directors critically exploring media of film and video will be viewed and discussed. Video techniques will be studied through screenings, group discussions, readings, practice sessions and presentations of original video projects made during the course. Sophomores and Juniors with officially declared FMS and SA majors are given priority registration; followed by sophomores and juniors with officially declared FMS and SA minors. Studio arts supplies fee: $75.

Through a diverse selection of women’s writings that encompass classical poetry, proletariat literature, war novels, and science fiction, students explore how women writers actively engaged with their respective societies during various points in history. Students will also gain critical insights into the issue of how “women’s literature” can be constructed within different frameworks such as history, social-political freedom, gender identity, commercial publishing, and artistic expression. While studying their writings and diverse voices, we meditate on these underlying questions: what is “women’s literature”? When and how can it be a productive category, and when is it not?\n\nAll readings will be in English; knowledge of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean is welcome but not required.\n\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Tuesday\n\nENGL 279-1\n\nSara Penner\n\nUnited States law says “Consent and agency over one’s body is a given in the work space.” How, then, can the performance workspace acknowledge and honor our boundaries, while nurturing us to risk, grow, and create our truest, bravest work? How can we as artists learn strategies to poetize the uncomfortable while honoring our boundaries? In this course, we study the history and evolution of consent in performance, allowing students to learn about personal agency, self-advocacy, and how to foster and navigate healthy collaboration across disciplines. The class will give young artists the space to discover and articulate their boundaries through a variety of group exercises and opportunities for self-reflection. Lectures will cover intimacy direction and rehearsal tools, discussions and guest lecturers on gender and feminist theory in relation to performance art, theatre, film and dance. This course is a must for artistic collaborators from directors & choreographers, to actors, musicians, technicians, and performance artists! United States law says “Consent and agency over one’s body is a given in the work space.” How, then, can the performance works"
