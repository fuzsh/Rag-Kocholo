        "text": "There is perhaps no human desolation more bitter or tragically ironic than that of a father when he knows that the son on whom he has pinned his heart and hopes has turned out a good-for-nothing rotter. This must be the ultimate anguish, the shattering end of a man's fondest dream. And this is the painful topic which is treated upon with deepest compassion and cumulative distress in Edward Small's devoted screen translation of the Howard Spring novel, \"My Son, My Son!\" which arrived yesterday at the Music Hall.The passage of a novel to the screen—especially a novel which is as extensive and dramatically diffuse as Mr. Spring's first personal account of a grief-tormented English father's life—is usually perilous. The necessity of being selective while maintaining the essential idea constitutes a considerable strain, and it is notable that Lenore Coffee has cut straight to the principal theme of this story and brought forth a screen play which, in every respect, preserves the emotional content of the original.But perhaps had Mr. Small, Miss Coffee and Director Charles Vidor been preparing an original treatment on essentially the same father-son theme they would have been somewhat more economical in their use of corollary incident. They might have given the story more compactness and consequent dramatic strength.As it is, they have traced in a protracted narrative style the pattern of the life of William Essex, a young man of the Manchester slums, who intends that his son shall have the comforts and advantages which he himself missed. But the boy, as his father becomes successful as a writer of stories and plays, grows into a liar and cheat. He deliberately attempts to steal the woman with whom his widowed parent falls in love, he compromises the daughter of his father's oldest and best friend and ultimately breaks the heart of the man who has passionately cherished him. In the end the screen version makes a digression for the sake of retributive effect. It permits the son to die bravely on a World War battlefield after a reconciliation with his father—not to reach a humiliating end on the gallows, as it was in the novel.The virtue of an extensive telling of such a story—the picture runs almost two hours—is that it acquaints the audience thoroughily with the emotional lives and experiences of its people. But the disadvantage generally is that it makes for dull and obvious passages. Essential action, which you anticipate, comes too slowly. And one expects in a picture of this length something more than a purely personal story—some reflection of the surrounding world by which the characters are also affected.As the father, Brian Aherne develops a stolid, bewildered and almost pathetically naive Victorian idealist—a man who seems to see the world in story-book terms. It is a character with whom you can deeply sympathize, but with whom you occasionally become impatient. Louis Hayward as the son is a slickly deceitful wretch whose bland smiles and treacherous devices reveal a thoroughly hateful cheat. Madeleine Carroll, as the young artist with whom William Essex falls in love, plays the part with warmth and grace and dignity. And other superior performances are turned in by Henry Hull, Laraine Day and Josephine Hutchinson.Much emotional torment has been poured into \"My Son, My Son!\" but there is also a lot of film over which it must spread out.\n\nMY SON, MY SON!; screen play by Lenore Coffee; based on the novel of the same name by Howard Spring; directed by Charles Vidor; an Edward Small production released through United Artists.

Lionel BelmoreDown in Furnace Flat, where the teams bring their cargo of borax out of Death Valley, the buzzards are watchful, the heat is terrific and the men talk plenty tough. But when words speak louder than actions the result is desultory drama. Aside from a horse-opera finale in which Wallace Beery and Leo Carrillo go walloping across the rutted desert and another villain bites the dust, \"Twenty-Mule Team,\" at the Capitol, moves little faster than its plodding mules.It takes a while to get things started at Furnace Flat. Maybe it's the heat, or the fact that Mr. Beery needs footage to cuss his ornery critters, or simply that the script writers stood first on one foot, then the other before combining a situation that partakes both of domestic drama and pulp-magazine heroics.There's the tavern mistress's daughter with a hankering for a \"sweet-mannered feller,\" who shortly arrives in the smooth person of Stag Roper. Alternating nocturnal exploits with daytime villainies, Mr. Roper blackmails Skinner Bill Bragg, of a past not impeccable, into revealing the location of a mountain of pure borax and is prevented from a double-cross only by Mr. Bragg's six-shooter.Having thus neatly disposed of his own problem and the tavern mistress's as well, the mule skinner with only an empty canteen, squats on a desert dune to soliloquize on life and death. But those rescue posses do get around. Mr. Beery is last seen quaffing ale with a printed pardon in hand for previous malefactions.As the whip-slinging skinner Mr. Beery is as hard-headed, muddled and garrulous as of yore; Marjorie Rambeau, as the mother, is obviously full of woe, and Anne Baxter is an attractive little desert flower. Leo Carrillo, that perennial Indian, is practically left to shift for himself so far as the script is concerned. The remaining cast is adequate, including the mules, who are very docile, But they're awfully slow.\n\nAt the CapitolTWENTY-MULE TEAM; screen play by Cyril Hume, E. E.

Lloyd Ingraham\"An Angel from Texas,\" now sharing the Palace's screen with \"Johnny Apollo,\" is a bright little farce about a couple of yokels from Texas who outwit a pair of Broadway theatrical sharps. The story is neither new nor exciting and, except for the addition of some modern slang, is pretty much the same as when George S. Kaufman told it in 1925 via \"The Butter and Egg Man.\" It has been smartly acted by a pleasant company, especially by Eddie Albert, Wayne Morris, Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman. Ray Enright has directed in a breezy, farcical manner.At the CinecittaIn what may be labeled a sort of Italian \"Cavalcade\" in a humorous vein, Vittorio de Sica carries the burden of a double role with his usual facility, and makes the passage of years from 1898 to 1938 pleasant diversion for the spectators at the Cinecitta.\"La Mazurka di Papa,\" a Fono Roma film directed by Oreste Biancoli, shows technological and social changes from the days of the mazurka, with all their formality, to the current radio music, airplane flirtations, etc., as affecting the life of a gallant young lieutenant who becomes a general, with a very \"modern,\" but fine son. There is a thread of honest sentiment running through the simple story, but not too much.At the Cina RomaThe De Filippo family of Italian actors is well represented in \"Sono Stato Io!\" (\"It Was I!\"), the sparkling comedy at the Cino Roma. Eduardo is a harmless retired middle-aged office worker, held responsible for everything that goes wrong in the family, where he is merely tolerated by his tyrannical sister-in-law (Titina), and Peppino is his scapegrace nephew. All of them are first rate, but Eduardo, in a rather Chaplinesque way, is the mainstay of the slender tale.Isa Pola wins the sympathy of the audience as an orphan brought up by the hard-boiled, petty, middle-class family and treated as a servant until the happy ending. Alida Valli is credible as the thoughtless daughter, and Frederico Collino does well in the role of the henpecked husband. Raffaello Matarazzo directed the film for the Consorzio E. I. A. at a swift pace."
