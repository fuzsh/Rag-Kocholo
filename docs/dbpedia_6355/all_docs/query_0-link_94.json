Film\n\nComposer of the Decade:\n\nMax Steiner\n\nSteiner continued to score Oscar nomination after Oscar nomination throughout the 40’s, earning at least one nomination every year and winning in 1944 for Since You Went Away. As the in-house composer for Warner Bros. during this era he also composed to timeless scores for both Casablanca and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\n\nWriter of the Decade:\n\nPreston Sturges\n\nSturges, in the first half of the decade, wrote more brilliant scripts than many writers are able to put out in an entire career. The top 5 Original Screenplay (Comedy) includes 4 of his finest and that doesn’t even include The Palm Beach Story or his Oscar win for The Great McGinty.\n\nSupporting Actress of the Decade:\n\nTeresa Wright\n\nWright won an Oscar for her great performance as the daughter-in-law in Mrs. Miniver, but her best work of the decade was her brow-beaten daughter in The Little Foxes and her devoted daughter in The Best Years of Our Lives. That doesn’t include her Oscar-nominated leading work in The Pride of the Yankees of her Oscar deserving leading work in Shadow of a Doubt.\n\nSupporting Actor of the Decade:\n\nClaude Rains\n\nWithout a doubt, the greatest character actor of all-time. This decade of work brought him three more Oscar nominations, though, stunningly, no Oscars. He should have won for his amazing work in Casablanca and for Notorious, was nominated for Mr. Skeffington and was worthy of a nomination in Kings Row, Here Comes Mr. Jordan and The Passionate Friends.\n\nActress of the Decade:\n\nIngrid Bergman\n\nShe won one Oscar (for Gaslight), was nominated three other times (For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Bells of St. Mary’s, Joan of Arc), should have been nominated another time (Notorious) and missed out for Casablanca only because there are rules against being double nominated in the same category. Please she was good in Spellbound. And she was the most beautiful actress of the decade.\n\nActor of the Decade:\n\nHumphrey Bogart\n\nIn a decade that included The Maltese Falcon, High Sierra, Casablanca, To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, somehow, not only did Humphrey Bogart fail to win the Oscar, but only managed to get nominated once (for Casablanca). Clearly the Academy was asleep at the wheel.\n\nDirector of the Decade:\n\nDavid Lean\n\nOf his 7 films, 5 of them make the top 100 for the decade. Two of them (Great Expectations and Brief Encounter) even make the top 20. And unlike Preston Sturges or Alfred Hitchcock, he has no duds in the decade.\n\nThe Top 100 Films of the Decade:\n\nChildren of Paradise (1945, dir. Marcel Carne)\n\nCitizen Kane (1941, dir.

Vittorio de Sica)\n\nOrpheus (1949, dir. Jean Cocteau)\n\nIn theory, each year should have ten films and two from the top 20, but here’s how they actually work out (top 20 in parenthesis):\n\n1940 – 11 (5)\n\n1941 – 13 (3)\n\n1942 – 8 (2)\n\n1943 – 7 (0)\n\n1944 – 11 (1)\n\n1945 – 11 (2)\n\n1946 – 10 (4)\n\n1947 – 8 (0)\n\n1948 – 11 (1)\n\n1949 – 10 (2)\n\nThanks to Foreign films and British films arriving late, the actual Oscar eligibility (and thus Nighthawk Award eligibility) breaks down like this:\n\n1940 – 10 (4)\n\n1941 – 13 (2)\n\n1942 – 7 (2)\n\n1943 – 7 (1)\n\n1944 – 6 (1)\n\n1945 – 6 (0)\n\n1946 – 10 (4)\n\n1947 – 16 (2)\n\n1948 – 7 (1)\n\n1949 – 9 (1)\n\npost-1949 – 9 (1)\n\n1946 lost two top 20 films (La belle and Great Expectations), but gained both of the ones from 1945. It is really the best year of the decade. In 1947, once the war was over, a lot of very good films started arriving, and thus the big jump. During the war, the quality of films suffered and many good ones didn’t show up until after the war. 1940, like 1946, is one of the best years in film history. The eligible films for 1946 include 7 from the top 30 and three from the top 10 (Children of Paradise, Best Years, Wonderful Life).\n\nWhile 8 Horror films made the list in the 1930’s, the best Horror film of the 1940’s is The Body Snatcher, which fell just short of the top 100. We do have 7 more Screwball Comedies, the latest of which was from 1943. We also have 3 Shakespeare adaptations and 4 Disney Animated films. The war fell heavily on other countries and only 16 Foreign Language films make the list, down from 29 in the decade before.\n\nOverall, the best year for Best Picture Nominees is 1947, which ranks 34th overall and the worst year is 1942 which ranks 71st overall. Here’s how many actual Oscar nominees for Best Picture from each Academy year made my top 100 for the decade (bearing in mind that from 1940-1943 there were 10 nominees each year):\n\n1940 – 5\n\n1941 – 6\n\n1942 – 3\n\n1943 – 6\n\n1944 – 2\n\n1945 – 2\n\n1946 – 3\n\n1947 – 4\n\n1948 – 3\n\n1949 – 3\n\nDirectors with 3 or more in the Top 100:"
