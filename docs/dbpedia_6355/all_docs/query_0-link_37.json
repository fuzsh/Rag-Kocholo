        "text": "There are always so many strands taking place at Il Cinema Ritrovato that I often don’t see more than one or two of any of the others. The main one with the largest most diverse collection of films, united only by the fact that they have been recently restored, is ‘Recovered and Restored’ (which is where The Annihilation of Fish and I’m an Elephant, Madame both sit). There was a strand on actor Marlene Dietrich, director Sergei Parajanov, directors Gustaf Molander and Pietro Germi (I didn’t see anything of these), documentaries, films of 1904 and of 1924, something called ‘Dark Heimat’ (which I also managed to miss entirely due to clashes), and a few other smaller ones, dedicated to small gauge celluloid and children’s films.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising film I saw, mainly because it was a film that came out while I’ve been going to movies by a director I really admire that I had no idea about, was The Annihilation of Fish (1999). I’ve been a fan of Charles Burnett ever since seeing the restored rerelease of Killer of Sheep back when I first visited New York in 2003. What I didn’t know was that even then discussions were in progress between Burnett and Milestone to get his then-latest film out and that’s it’s taken until now for that to be realised. Indeed I’d never even heard of this film but it turns out to be rather a sweet delight. It’s a film with a lot of broken people struggling through life but there’s no sense of malice about them or the film, which treats each of them—mad as they are—as people just living their lives and trying to get through and somehow meeting one another on the same level. James Earl Jones plays a man who literally wrestles with a demon and when he throws it off the filmmakers construe to have the tree beneath his window shake each time as if the demon is real, because I suppose it is. Less certain is Jones’s Jamaican accent but his presence is warm and grounding and the film is a great rediscovery.\n\nAnother restored rediscovery was the West German film I’m an Elephant Madame (1969). There was quite a rich seam of experimental filmmakers in West Germany in the 60s it seems. Some of them went on to fame as part of the New German Cinema and some of them made films that sort of disappeared from view (well, at least, my view). I think of narratives like The Cat Has Nine Lives (from a feminist perspective) or this one, which has a somewhat more contested relationship to its culture I feel, in the sense that I’m not quite clear whose side it’s on (possibly just its own). There are teachers at a school and there are the students and all seem equally ridiculous in their ideological positions (perhaps if…. is another point of comparison, made the previous year). Personally I love the style, which involves a lot of well-lit frontal compositions, edited with Vertov-like verve and set to a largely Velvet Underground soundtrack. After a while it feels a little wearing (at which point it switches to documentary reactions from people in the street to a swastika-based provocation) but I think it adds up to some kind of statement about contemporary Germany.\n\nMoving to the Marlene Dietrich strand is the silent-era movie The Woman Men Yearn For (1929), and as you might expect it’s Dietrich who plays the title (if not central) role. What a glorious, richly textured and vibrant world we lost (for a few years at least) when sound cinema took over. This film has all the hallmarks of bold Soviet montage with its presentation of the factory setting, the beautiful train images when Dietrich is introduced, and the climactic New Year’s ball with its long elegant tracking shots through dancing crowds. The story itself is about an adulterous man who falls for Dietrich’s character, only to discover she has been claimed by another murderous suitor, but it has all the requisite melodrama and the performances are pitched exactly right for the silent screen. Our accompaniment was solo piano from Donald Sosin, which kept things moving along nicely.\n\nFrom the documentary strand (not restored, but shown on 35mm) is the civil rights piece The Bus (1965). Director and cinematographer Haskell Wexler documented a bus journey from San Francisco to Washington for the march in 1963, capturing some of the organisation involved in bringing it together at a small local level and a lot of the discussion amongst the people on the bus as they cross America. We hear from the well meaning white people, including the bus driver and some of the young people, who play folk tunes to pass the time, but there’s also a contingent of Black travellers of all ages, including a veteran of both world wars, another who recounts being chased from Washington due to race riots in 1919, and a guy arguing that if the purpose of the people on the bus is to uphold the struggle for civil rights they should be supporting him to hop off the bus to get some cigarettes in Maryland without being harassed. Anyway, the film sticks purposefully to just the ordinary participants as they arrive in Washington (there’s no footage of the speeches or MLK), and ends with a resounding chorus of “this may be the last time” (I’d say spoilers but we all know that this doesn’t end).\n\nFinally, taking a different turn, the Sergei Parajanov strand featured a lot of his works, including some of his earliest, less well-known, films like The First Lad (1959). If you’ve watched his mature works you’ll have an idea of the Parajanov’s filmmaking style and this socialist realist musical romcom set on a Ukrainian collectivised farm is probably not it. There is some question, apparently, as to whether this is a satire but it seems so ridiculously overblown and camp that I can’t quite imagine how it isn’t (reminding me a little of the jokey tone of Cherry Town from a few years later). In any case it follows the familiar sort of format of the happy (and extremely clean, given the amount of farming dirt) peasants falling in love and getting into capers, for some reason involving a football-based kolkhoz rivalry. Anyway, it’s all very bright and jolly and silly and it amused me."
