        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nFilm History\n\n1940-1949\n\nFilmmaking had supposedly peaked in 1939 just as the war arrived to greatly limit (outside of America, film production was massively down) and influence it (in America, War films took the forefront). After the war concluded, came the two lawsuits that changed the way of films in America. First came de Havilland vs. Warner Bros. Pictures which altered the notion of what a studio could put in a contract. Second came United States vs. Paramount Pictures which meant that production studios would have to sell off their theater chains. The first hastened the end of the way films were made in the Studio Era while the second altered how they were distributed and brought an to the end to the concept of the “majors” as they had been known.\n\nThe end of the war meant the arrival of massive amounts of foreign films. In the Nighthawk Awards, which run on when films played in L.A. rather than when they were initially released, Foreign films reach a nadir of 1.86% of the films I’ve seen in 1944 and rise to 19.28% by 1949 (and that doesn’t even account for the rise of British films). Likewise, the lawsuits meant that majors were making fewer films and things started to open up for independent distributors.\n\nAwards started to bloom, beginning during the war with the arrival of the Golden Globes and after the war when the BAFTA Awards began followed soon after by the first two (and still the two biggest) guild awards, the DGA and the WGA.\n\nGenres\n\nThough the statistics are down below in that section, there are some things to be said here about various genres in the 1940s. I discuss the genres in ascending order of quantity.\n\nDrama: 720\n\nComedy: 560\n\nWestern: 367\n\nMusical: 348\n\nMystery: 246\n\nCrime: 217\n\nSuspense: 155\n\nWar: 137\n\nAdventure: 117\n\nHorror: 63\n\nKids: 48\n\nFantasy: 29\n\nAction: 26\n\nSci-Fi: 6\n\nAction / Sci-Fi / Fantasy\n\nAlmost non-existent, combining for just over 2% of the films in the decade. Sci-Fi doesn’t have a film above *** and the only Action film above *** is Sanshiro Sugata which isn’t awards eligible until 1974. Fantasy does have two great films and three very good ones but it’s telling that three of those five are French and one is British (Stairway to Heaven) leaving just The Devil and Daniel Webster from Hollywood. No major made more than four and several have just one each.\n\nKids\n\nIt’s not all Disney (just 12 of 51 films) but those are by far the best, averaging almost an 81 while the other Kids films average a 57. Miracle on 34th Street is the only Kids film in the Top 10 not made by Disney. Almost half of the non-Disney films are Animal films including three different dog series (Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Rusty) and a horse series (Flicka).\n\nHorror\n\nThis is often thought of as a lost decade for Horror, but it’s actually got more films and a higher percentage of total films than in the 30s. The films are, however, terrible, with a 10 point drop-off from the 30s (after a 13 point drop-off from the 20s). The Body Snatcher is the only film above ***. Universal dominates (no surprise), accounting for 41% of the films while several studios have no more than two and UA has none. Half the films are either Mad Scientist or some form of Monster.\n\nAdventure\n\nThey are slightly more plentiful than in the 30s but significantly worse (six points lower on average). There are Swashbuckler films galore and Tarzan is still going while Bomba and Jungle Jim start at the end of the decade (using former Tarzan stars). But a small Animated film that barely got released at all (Crab with the Golden Claws) is the only film above ***. Every studio has at least six.\n\nWar\n\nOver three times as many War films as in the 30s. Though every major has at least five, it’s actually Artkino, releasing the slew of Soviet films about WWII that has the most (20). Dominated by World War II films (all but 10 in the decade), though ironically two of the three **** films aren’t World War II films (Ivan the Terrible Part I, For Whom the Bell Tolls) making In Which We Serve the clear winner of World War II films made during the war. They drop four points from the decade before but are again the best genre by average rating (63.20). They dominate during the war (99 of 137 films land in the US from 1942 to 1946) but then quickly drop off with many of the films in the last three years being foreign imports.\n\nSuspense\n\nWe get more Spy films, some World War II Suspense films and the start of Graham Green adaptations. Hitchcock continues to dominate, directing 6 of the 17 films above ***. All the majors get into it, with every one having at least nine films in the decade and RKO making a whopping 27. Suspense goes from the 10th most films in the 40s to the 7th most in the 30s.\n\nCrime\n\nThough still in 6th place, up significantly in total films. Down three points in quality. Dipped significantly during the war and then ramped things up at the end with more films in each year from 47-49 than in 43-45 combined. Only two great films (It Always Rains on Sunday, Force of Evil) with a handful of very good ones. Gangster films are way down but several series are running (Lone Wolf, Crime Doctor, Boston Blackie), all of which are Columbia, giving the studio a massive 45 films. Universal and Warners are both also over 20 while UA barely has any.\n\nMystery\n\nParamount, UA and Warners had fewer because they didn’t have series but most of the majors, as well as Monogram, actually had multiple detectives going in the decade. Fox, Universal, Columbia, Monogram and RKO all had at least 28 films with all but Fox with at least 33. Of course, most of those were mediocre which is why the total genre clocks in at 55 for an average. But there were lots of them with at least 20 in every year except 1943 (which still had 15). Only four films reach **** but all four are among the Top 20 for the decade.\n\nMusicals\n\nUp slightly in quantity but down in percentage and drops a spot in ranking. There’s never a year with fewer than 29 films. Unfortunately, quality doesn’t follow on with that, with only one great film (Yankee Doodle Dandy) and one very good one (Anchors Aweigh). All the majors have at least 15 but Fox (46), Universal (58) and MGM (60) are the really big ones.\n\nWesterns\n\nActually slightly worse than in the 30s but not the worst genre thanks to Action, even if it’s barely getting above ** on average (50.74). Another genre that dips during the war (51 from 42-44) and booms afterwards (from 45 on the numbers are 42, 36, 52, 49). Accounts for 12% of the films, a massive number for non-Drama / Comedy / Musical. Columbia has a massive amount thanks to the Durango Kid with 66 films (and I haven’t even been able to see them all). All the majors make at least a dozen but the numbers are so high because of the Poverty Row studios, including Monogram 16), PRC (26), and of course, Republic (67), most of which are either Musicals with Roy Rogers or Gene Autry and they are terrible. There are just three great films (Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Ox-Bow Incident, Red River) and two very good ones (My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache). John Ford makes 5 Westerns and they average 76.2. He makes less than 1/70th of the Westerns in the decade but without his films, the average drops a whole half-point.\n\nComedies\n\nThey drop almost a full-point down to 58.32. It peaks early; there are 13 **** films but only one (Kind Hearts and Coronets) is after 1944. The Comedy awards sink because from 1945 to 1949 there are only four eligible films that even reach ***.5. Preston Sturges dominates with 5 of the top 8 films in the decade. The best Comedies are either Screwball or Satire but the decade is filled to the brim with relentlessly mediocre series films (Blondie, Bowery Boys, Spitfire, Maisie) or Abbott & Costello films (24 as opposed to the 15 of four other comedy teams combined). All of the majors have at least 39 films and several of them have 60 or more. The total number is actually significantly down from the 30s (93 fewer films) but Comedy has the most films in 1941 (by a lot), 1942 and 1943.\n\nDramas\n\nEven though the films for the decade as a whole go down by only 3/4 of a point, Drama is the only genre to go up, going up by almost three points to 62.61. The total number of films is way down (by over 350) and the percentage of total films drops by a full 1/3 with several years failing to even reach 20% and for three years in the middle of the war (41-43) not even being the most plentiful genre. That’s because of Poverty Row; the three primary PR studios (Republic, Monogram, PRC) account for 13% of all films but just 4% of the Dramas.\n\nThe Best Films by Genre, 1940-1949\n\nAction: Sanshiro Sugata\n\nAdventure: Crab with the Golden Claws\n\nComedy: Sullivan’s Travels\n\nCrime: It Always Rains on Sunday\n\nDrama: Children of Paradise\n\nFantasy: La belle et la bete\n\nHorror: The Body Snatcher\n\nKids: Fantasia\n\nMusical: Yankee Doodle Dandy\n\nMystery: The Maltese Falcon\n\nSci-Fi: n/a\n\nSuspense: Stray Dog\n\nWar: In Which We Serve\n\nWestern: Treasure of the Sierra Madre\n\nSub-Genres\n\nWe add some sub-genres that hadn’t come up before (Animal, Animated, Broadway Adaptation) but we also see some drop off that just don’t have very many in the 40s (Courtroom, Prison, Vampire). Swashbuckler also returns which is interesting since I think a lot of people identify that with Errol Flynn in the 30s but there were a lot fewer in the 30s than in the 20s or 40s. Of course, WWI drops off (just four films) while WWII films become very big (over 90% of all the War films I’ve seen in the decade).\n\nAnimal\n\nBest Film: National Velvet\n\n18 films with some getting their own sub-sub-genres (Flicka, Lassie, Rusty). They are decidedly not good with an average of 53.1 with the Lassie films being significantly better than most of the others (5 films, 63.4).\n\nAnimated\n\nBest Film: Fantasia\n\nMostly (11 films, 80.2) Disney but not all with a total of 18 films with a 72.2 average including the first Anime film on the list (Momotaro, Sacred Sailors) and the first Tintin film (the stop-motion Crab with the Golden Claws).\n\nAnthology\n\nBest Film: The First Front\n\nThis sub-genre sprung up with films that tell multiple short stories in the course of a film. They cross genres with Drama, Horror, Fantasy and Musical all appearing for a total of 6 films with an average of 67.3.\n\nBiopic\n\nBest Film: Yankee Doodle Dandy\n\nThe only other film aside from Yankee that is even very good is Monsieur Vincent. No other film ranks above a 68. There are several sub-sub-genres with Musician (19, 62.2), Politician (3, 55.3), Religious (8, 58.0), Scientist (5, 64.0) and Writer (5, 59.4) with a lot of uncategorized ones for a total of 51 films with an average of 61.3. I guess the Artist Biopics really don’t pick up until the 50s.\n\nBroadway Adaptation\n\nBest Film: Higher and Higher\n\nNot a great era for Broadway Adaptations but I’m not a big fan of Rodgers and Hammerstein (one film) or Rodgers and Hart (three films) or the other four I list. Total of 8 Musicals with an average of 62.1.\n\nChristmas\n\nBest Film: Miracle on 34th Street\n\nI don’t actually classify It’s a Wonderful Life this way so we have six films with an average of 64.8 and one song that’s been played about 64.8 billion times.\n\nComedy\n\nBest Film: 3 Godfathers\n\nThese are films that are Comedies but aren’t primarily Comedies, so Westerns, Horror, Crime, Mystery, but mostly Westerns and Mystery. A total of 43 films with an average of 52.9.\n\nComedy Team\n\nBest Film: Road to Morocco\n\nThere are three primary Comedy Teams functioning in this decade with three final Marx Brothers films (55.3) and the first Martin & Lewis film (54). Aside from that we have the solid Hope & Crosby Road films (5, 71.6), decent but fading Laurel & Hardy films (6, 63.2) and the team that starts solid but descends into crap by decade’s end with a whopping 24 Abbott & Costello films (59.2). All told, that’s 39 films, 61.0 average.\n\nComic Strip\n\nBest Film: Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome\n\nThere are four Dick Tracy films and a L’il Abner film. They’re pretty bad.\n\nCop\n\nBest Film: Stray Dog\n\nThese are mostly Mystery or Suspense when in later decades they will be much more Action films. Stray Dog is the best by 21 points (over Green for Danger). 20 films, 57.4.\n\nCostume\n\nBest Film: Letter from an Unknown Woman\n\nThese are basically period pieces that aren’t already classified (usually as Lit Adaptations or Romance) that I remember to designate as Costume Dramas. 9 films, 70.3.\n\nCourtroom\n\nBest Film: Take My Life\n\n9 films, 58.2. For the most part, weak Dramas in this decade.\n\nCowboy/Indian\n\nBest Film: Fort Apache\n\nI don’t like the term “Indian” but that’s what these films are generally referred to as. The 9 films with an average of 57.4 would be a lot worse if not for Ford’s Cavalry Trilogy.\n\nDetective\n\nBest Film: The Maltese Falcon\n\nA lot of films (98) and they’re not good (55.6) with Bogart’s two turns in Hammett adaptations not only the only **** films but also the only ones above a 70. There are numerous sub-sub-genres from small (five or fewer for Bulldog Drummond, Ellery Queen, Hammett, Marlowe, Nick Carter, the Saint, the Shadow, Mike Shayne, Philo Vance, Mr. Wong) to large with the Falcon (16, 52.0), Sherlock Holmes (12, 65.3) and Charlie Chan (22, 51.0).\n\nFranchise (Tarzan)\n\nBest Film: Tarzan’s New York Adventure\n\nI’ve started the Franchise tag to sweep up large franchises that work differently than old series used to, to cover things that move between studios a lot and to get rid of smaller sub-genres and group them together (Star Wars, Star Trek, James Bond, etc). While there are lots of series films below, this is the only franchise in the decade with 9 films, 58.6 average.\n\nGangster\n\nBest Film: High Sierra\n\nThe sub-genre drops off significantly with only 12 films, 58.6 average. That gives an idea how bad most of them are when the average is the same as the Tarzan films even though High Sierra and White Heat are much better than any of the Tarzan films.\n\nHistorical\n\nBest Film: Ivan the Terrible Part I\n\nI have started four sub-sub-genres in this sub-genre though three of them only have one film each in this decade (British Crown, French Crown, Russia) while the US Presidency has two (including The Magnificent Doll, the worst Historical film of the decade). In total, 24 films, 62.0 average.\n\nLit Adaptation\n\nBest Film: The Third Man\n\nA lot of writers are specifically identified in this decade (28) but lots of them only have one and only three writers have more than three films (Graham Greene with 6 (80.7) and Maugham (58.0) and Steinbeck (73.5) with four each). Three of the Top 10 films in the decade can be found in this sub-genre. The overall total is 67 films for a 68.6 average.\n\nMad Scientist\n\nBest Film: The Devil Bat\n\n13 films, 50.7 average. Getting less frequent but a common (but bad) Horror sub-genre.\n\nMonster\n\nBest Film: The Wolf Man\n\nThe Abbott & Costello meet films are in Comedy Team but we still have four Mummy films, four Werewolf films, three Frankenstein films, a Jekyll film and five others for a total of 17 films, 58.4 average.\n\nMusical\n\nBest Film: Blue Bird\n\nAppropriately, almost all of the films are Westerns but not the best because they’re mostly awful Roy Rogers and Gene Autry films. The vast majority of the 68 films are from Republic Pictures and overall they have an awful average (47.7).\n\nOpera\n\nBest Film: The Barber of Seville\n\nAll seven films are foreign, mostly Italian and I generally glaze over and give it a 63 (lowest ***).\n\nPlay Adaptation\n\nBest Film: Brief Encounter\n\nWriters identified are lead by Noel Coward (five films, 74.4) but also Kaufman, Miller (the first film adaptation of a Miller play), O’Neill, Shaw and Wilde. 21 films, 70.0.\n\nReligious\n\nBest Film: Day of Wrath\n\nThe range is wide for what I consider. 8 films, 68.4.\n\nRomance\n\nBest Film: L’Atalante\n\n76 films, 62.4. After the three truly great films (Casablanca, La belle et la bête, Stairway to Heaven) there’s a big drop-off.\n\nRomantic\n\nBest Film: The Shop Around the Corner\n\n142 films, 60.2. Most are mediocre with only one great film.\n\nSatire\n\nBest Film: The Great Dictator\n\nChaplin might have the best film but thanks to Preston Sturges the 8 films with an average of 82.8 is very very good.\n\nScrewball\n\nBest Film: The Philadelphia Story\n\nMostly disappears after 1941 but there are still 18 total films with a 75.6 average thanks also to His Girl Friday and The Lady Eve.\n\nSeries\n\nBest Film: Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever\n\nI list 23 different series here. Some are small because they’re hard to find (Henry Aldrich) or just starting at the end of the decade (Bomba, Jungle Jim, Kettle) but several are very prolific with 23 Blondie films, 15 Bowery Boys films (after 5 as the Dead End Kids and 4 as the East Side Kids), 36 Durango Kid films and 24 Hopalong Cassidy films. In total, I’ve now suffered through 223 of these films which have a 48.9 average. The only films that even reach *** are the Andy Hardy films and a few Dr. Kildare films because they’re both MGM series and MGM put more money and talent into them.\n\nSocial\n\nBest Film: The Lost Weekend\n\nBy the end of the decade, we would start to get the really bad Social Dramas meant to teach kids, films like Bad Boy, Delinquent Daughters and She Shoulda Said No which is why a sub-genre with Lost Weekend, Germany Year Zero, Gentleman’s Agreement and Drunken Angel and several very good films has an average of only 65.0 among 25 films.\n\nSports\n\nBest Film: Champion\n\nThis includes several Sports Biopics (which I make a sub-sub-genre of Sports rather than Biopic) and one Sports True Story. After Champion, Pride of the Yankees, The Set-Up and Body and Soul things drop off very quickly so 25 films have a pretty weak 53.7 average.\n\nSpy\n\nBest Film: Foreign Correspondent\n\n21 films, 58.4 average and most of them are forgettable.\n\nSwashbuckler\n\nBest Film: The Thief of Baghdad\n\nThis includes four Dumas films, two Robin Hood films and two Zorro films. 21 films, 56.5.\n\nWorld War II\n\nBest Film: The Best Years of Our Lives\n\nAs you can see from the top film, this includes both War films and Dramas in which the war makes a major impact. There were a lot of films made during the war. I have 24 films from 1942, 43 from 1943, 33 from 1944 and 23 from 1945. They drop off significantly after that but don’t go away. 178 films, 62.6.\n\nThe Directors\n\nOnce again, this is not a list of the most prolific directors of the decade, it’s a list of the most important. I’ve seen 22 films directed in the decade by Lloyd Bacon, only two of which rise above mid ***. He did a lot of work, but in the scope of film history, not much important work. And this is based off their work and my estimation of it. For what, say, the Oscars thought of a director, go down to the Oscars section.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\n\nFilms: 12\n\nAverage Film: 78.2\n\nBest Film: Rebecca\n\nWorst Film: Under Capricorn\n\nHitchcock’s average is hurt by one bad and one mediocre film (The Paradine Case) but he won Best Picture (though not Director) and earned two other nominations (including his first of three noms without a Picture nom). And that’s with two of his best films (Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt) being mostly overlooked by the Academy.\n\nDavid Lean\n\nFilms: 7\n\nAverage Film: 87.0\n\nBest Film: Great Expectations\n\nWorst Film: The Passionate Friends\n\nOnly seven films but all are at least high *** or better and he earns his first Oscar nomination (and multiple Nighthawk noms).\n\nHoward Hawks\n\nFilms: 9\n\nAverage Film: 81.2\n\nBest Film: The Big Sleep\n\nWorst Film: A Song is Born\n\nHawks earned an Oscar nomination for one of his weakest films in the decade (Sergeant York) but three of his best films earned a total of zero nominations (The Big Sleep, His Girl Friday, To Have and Have Not).\n\nPreston Sturges\n\nFilms: 11\n\nAverage Film: 81.0\n\nBest Film: Sullivan’s Travels\n\nWorst Film: The Great Moment\n\nIf not for his weak Drama, this average would be a magnificent 83.9. Sturges had the best scripts, which he wrote himself and the comedy was delightful. Very few directors have a peak like Sturges did from 1940-1944.\n\nOrson Welles\n\nFilms: 5\n\nAverage Film: 85.8\n\nBest Film: Citizen Kane\n\nWorst Film: The Lady from Shanghai\n\nOnly five films but two are great two are very good and the final one is a 75.\n\nWilliam Wyler\n\nFilms: 6\n\nAverage Film: 85.3\n\nBest Film: The Best Years of Our Lives\n\nWorst Film: The Westerner\n\nJust six films but four of them are great, he won two Oscars and his six films earned a massive 18 Oscars and a staggering 47 nominations with every one of them earning at least three noms. While Ford (see below) won back-to-back Oscars he made multiple films in between while Wyler, thanks to the war, went four years between films but won Oscars for consecutive films, something that wouldn’t be repeated for 70 years.\n\nJohn Ford\n\nFilms: 10\n\nAverage Film: 77.3\n\nBest Film: The Grapes of Wrath\n\nWorst Film: Tobacco Road\n\nFord won back-to-back Oscars in 1940 and 1941 and then ended the decade with his Cavalry Trilogy. Tobacco Road is the only film he made that’s not at least high ***.\n\nBest Director (weighted points system)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock (436)\n\nDavid Lean (358)\n\nHoward Hawks (335)\n\nPreston Sturges (324)\n\nOrson Welles (313)\n\nWilliam Wyler (301)\n\nJohn Ford (277)\n\nMichael Powell (267)\n\nJohn Huston (233)\n\nAkira Kurosawa (224)\n\nAnalysis: This adds up points on a weighted scale (100-1) based on a weighted version of my 9 point director scale. This is different than the usual list here for the genres or studios because it’s based on the pure directing points rather than the scaled list for how they finish at the Nighthawk Awards. It is cumulative for all films made by that director in the decade, no matter when they got OE releases.\n\nTop 10 Most Prolific Directors\n\nSam Newfield (36, 44.9)\n\nLesley Selander (30, 46.2)\n\nLew Landers (28, 50.4)\n\nWilliam Berke (28, 47.7)\n\nFrank McDonald (28, 45.6)\n\nRichard Thorpe (25, 59.0)\n\nWilliam Beaudine (24, 46.8)\n\nEdward Dmytryk (23, 58.5)\n\nS. Sylvan Simon (23, 54.0)\n\nLeslie Goodwins (23, 49.9)\n\nnote: I should note Raoul Walsh who only directed 22 films that I’ve seen but they average a much better 66.0 and Michael Curtiz averaged a 69.6 with 21 films.\n\nThe Stars\n\nIngrid Bergman\n\nReally good at the Oscars (4 noms, 1 win) and even better at the Nighthawks (6 noms, 2 wins), she was also the most beautiful actress of the decade. The most acting points in the decade, male or female.\n\nEssential Viewing: Gaslight, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Casablanca, Notorious\n\nHumphrey Bogart\n\nYes, he was short and yes, he wasn’t particularly handsome. But no one exuded cool the way that Bogie did in this decade, playing two of the greatest detectives, the perfect cynic who’s a failed romantic and the most obsessed that no one will put something over on him. He, appallingly, only earned one Oscar nom in the decade. However, he wins two Nighthawk awards and earns four other nominations.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep\n\nCary Grant\n\nOnly two Oscar noms in the decade and both for weaker performances. He wins a Nighthawk in Supporting Actor and then two other Nighthawk noms aside from a myriad of good but lesser performances that earn him points.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Petrified Forest, Pygmalion, Berkeley Square, A Free Soul\n\nBette Davis\n\nOnly four Oscar nominations and she didn’t win one. She managed six Nighthawk nominations although she still didn’t win one of those either. But her three brilliant performances at the beginning of the decade are close to iconic (beyond close when the cigarette is lit for her).\n\nEssential Viewing: The Letter, The Little Foxes, Now Voyager, Mr. Skeffington\n\nClaude Rains\n\nThe consummate supporting player, suave and untrustworthy all at the same time. He played suicidal men, Nazis, Nazi collaborators and even an angel. He somehow didn’t win an Oscar (in spite of three nominations) but he wins two Nighthawks and earns four other nominations and even wins the Comedy / Musical Globe in 1943 for his performance as the Phantom.\n\nEssential Viewing: Casablanca, Notorious, Kings Row, Here Comes Mr. Jordan\n\nBest Actress (weighted points system)\n\nIngrid Bergman (399)\n\nBette Davis (297)\n\nOlivia de Havilland (245)\n\nTeresa Wright (242)\n\nBarbara Stanwyck (236)\n\nDeborah Kerr (200)\n\nGreer Garson (173)\n\nJoan Fontaine (157)\n\nKatharine Hepburn (149)\n\nRosalind Russell (148)\n\nAnalysis: This adds up points on a weighted scale (78-1) based on a weighted version of my 9 point acting scale. It is cumulative for all films made by that actress through 1929.\n\nBest Actor (weighted points system)\n\nHumphrey Bogart (383)\n\nCary Grant (356)\n\nClaude Rains (311)\n\nLaurence Olivier (284)\n\nJames Stewart (278)\n\nHenry Fonda (235)\n\nGregory Peck (201)\n\nWalter Huston (193)\n\nOrson Welles (183)\n\nKirk Douglas (158)\n\nAnalysis: This adds up points on a weighted scale (78-1) based on a weighted version of my 9 point acting scale. It is cumulative for all films made by that actor through 1929.\n\nThe Worst Actor of the 1940s\n\nRobert Taylor\n\nHow did he ever become a star? He wasn’t all that good looking and he was an absolutely dreadful actor. He was married to one of the best actresses of the decade (Barbara Stanwyck). He was even a rabid anti-Communist. In Conspirator, released in 1949, in his late 30s and looking much older, he creepily was paired with 16 year old Elizabeth Taylor (no relation).\n\nThe Studios\n\nSee below for specific statistics about the studios. There are a lots in the Statistics section but there is also some significant information in the Academy Awards section.\n\nI will make much of “Oscar submitted films” in this section. Because of disagreement among records, it’s hard to really know how many films were released by various studios (and to be fair, distributors is a more accurate word, but studios is the word that people know). The easiest way for me to track things (and calculate numbers) is based off how many films were submitted for Oscar consideration.\n\nBut in the 40s, things got weird with that in the first half of the decade. From 1941 to 1944, the Oscars list no more than 200 submitted films in each year. What’s more, it’s massively dominated by the majors, never accounting for less than 78% of the films and getting as high as over 90% in 1941. What’s more, Oscar records don’t even list some of the Oscar nominated films as being submitted. Sometimes even majors don’t appear. In 1944, with only 137 films listed as submitted (the fewest ever), those come from only 10 studios, with every film coming from a major or one of the three main Poverty Row studios. Even Columbia doesn’t have a single submitted film listed in spite of the four Columbia films that earned a combined 9 Oscar nominations. The records are very strange, but I’m going with the submissions list.\n\nBut, just a year later, things had changed. In 1945, there were 385 submitted films, only 61% of which were from the majors and by 1949 it was up to 481 and the majors percentage was down to 54%.\n\nI won’t mention every studio but I will discuss each of the 14 that submitted more than 25 films to the Oscars as well as Disney (who only submitted 13).\n\nMajors\n\nBy this, I mean the five majors that both had production studios and theater chains (MGM, Paramount, Warners, Fox, RKO, Columbia), the two major-minors that didn’t have chains (Universal, Columbia), the one wild card (United Artists) and Disney. I’m in quite good shape with the majors, having seen 86.84% of the 2090 films (which account for 67.03% of all submitted films, down considerably from the 30s) and only one studio is below 81%.\n\nMGM\n\nThe big daddy. They submitted fewer films (300) than Universal or Columbia but I’ve seen the highest percentage (97%). They also had more nominated films than either of those two. They continued to be big at the box office and had the second most Oscars. They average 61.14, a slight increase from the decade before and better than the other majors except Disney and UA. Though not as successful at the Oscars as in the 30s, they did have the biggest Oscar film of the decade (Mrs. Miniver).\n\nParamount\n\nDown almost two points from the decade before (58.19) making them one of the weaker majors. They are also low among the majors for submitted films (219) and the percentage that I’ve seen (85.39%). After submitting 47 films in 1940, they have never again surpassed 29 films and in 1949 didn’t even rank among the Top 10 studios for submissions. Their best films are dominated by Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder but the 14 Hopalong Cassidy films I’ve seen drag down the overall average. But it was just one of two studios to win multiple Best Pictures in the decade, in fact winning back to back in 1944 and 1945.\n\nWarner Brothers\n\nThe only studio with two of the Top 5 films for the decade and has 3 of the Top 10 (Casablanca, Maltese Falcon, Treasure of the Sierra Madre). Bogie’s the biggest star of course, adding a fourth Top 20 film (The Big Sleep). They were not plentiful, only surpassing 22 Oscars submissions twice and twice not even making the Top 10 for most submitted films. But I’ve seen 196 of the 205 submissions (95.61%). But they were only sixth in nominations and fifth in wins. The average goes up two and a half points to 60.56 but is still just in the middle of the majors.\n\n20th-Century Fox\n\nAs detailed in this post, Fox was improving. The films are a point better (60.76) and I’ve managed to see far more (86.76%) because they’re not lost like the 30s films were. What’s more, they had the most nominations, Oscars and Best Picture nominations of any studio in the decade and were one of only two studios to win two Best Picture awards.\n\nRKO Radio\n\nNo longer weakest of the majors, having gone up over two points to 57.73. As discussed, it just didn’t have the talent at its hands that the other majors did, but it did add Orson Welles which made a big impact. Its submitted films were in the middle (256) and I’ve seen most of them (92.97%). It had the second most Oscar nominations in the decade though just the fourth most wins, almost a third of which came from one film (The Best Years of Our Lives).\n\nUniversal\n\nA deceptive studio in that it had five great films in the decade but four of them were British imports (Great Expectations, Brief Encounter, Stairway to Heaven, Hamlet) including both of its Best Picture nominees and its only win between 1930 and 1973. It had the most submitted films in the decade (322) although not the easiest to find (at 81.68% the second lowest of the majors). And what I could see wasn’t that good, with an average dipping down over three points to 57.91, the third lowest of the majors. In spite of all those submissions, it’s 7th in nominated films and total nominations and 6th in wins.\n\nColumbia\n\nCapra went off to war and the studio began to suck. Only two great films emerged from Columbia in the decade (His Girl Friday, The More the Merrier). The studio became dominated by series films, of which I’ve seen 101 in seven different series that average 48.2. They help contribute to Columbia’s terrible 54.23 average, easily the worst of the majors. They submitted a lot (311, the second most of the decade) and the 60 films in 1947 and 1949 are the most by any studio after 1937 and the 177 in a three year span from 1947-49 are astounding (and counteract the two combined listed submitted films in 1943-44 in spite of having 8 nominated films in those two years). But they are also, by far, the hardest to find. I’ve seen just 68.81% of the submitted films, the only time any major will drop below 80% after 1939.\n\nUnited Artists\n\nOnce again, the smallest of the majors with just 192 submitted films (I’ve seen 92.19%). It doesn’t even make the Top 10 studios of the decade, surpassed by three Poverty Row studios. Also, even though it drops two points, at 61.54 it’s the best of the majors (aside from the minimal amount from Disney). What’s more, it manages to have the most nominated films and fourth most nominations, with over 1/3 of its films earning a nomination. It doesn’t have a lot of great films (just five) but not much crap either (just 10 films below **.5). Included among the 15 films I haven’t seen are two Oscar nominees.\n\nDisney\n\nNot really a studio and not even a distributor with their feature films still being released by RKO through the decade. Disney submitted 13 films (of which I only count 12, not including The Reluctant Dragon). They average a very good 78.3 (80.8 if not including So Dear to My Heart). What’s more, 8 of those films earn a combined 16 nominations and 4 Oscars and thanks to multiple re-releases, account for the top 4 grossing films of the decade as of the present.\n\nIndependents\n\nThis will mean different things in different decades but basically it’s studios that weren’t majors but released a significant number of films (at least 150 total Oscar submitted films is the cut-off). For the purposes of the 1940s, as it was in the 30s, these are Poverty Row studios. While all of these studios were still going strong in 1949, only Monogram would survive the 50s. The Indies are harder to find in this decade and I’m only at 58.68% of 743 total films; in spite of accounting for just 23.83% of the total films, they account for 46.94% of the films I haven’t seen.\n\nMonogram Pictures / Allied Artists\n\nMonogram was one of the two major Poverty Row studios to emerge from the 30s. It continued strong in the 40s with the 8th most submitted films in the decade (233) although I’ve seen only just under half of them. Seven of their films did manage to combine for 8 Oscar nominations. But the films, lead by a lot of series (Bowery Boys and Charlie Chan the most prominent) are terrible (48.32). Late in the decade, Monogram formed Allied Artists which began as a higher budget subsidiary and would, eventually in the 50s, supplant Monogram entirely. I keep the two studios listed together.\n\nRepublic Pictures\n\nRepublic is slighter bigger than Monogram with slighter more submissions (245), slightly better films (50.16) and I’ve seen slightly more (just over half). The big difference is in Oscar success where Republic managed 32 nominations for 20 films though it didn’t win any and it accounts for 2/3 of the nominees I haven’t seen. Republic’s average would be much better if not for the Roy Rogers and Red Ryder films and unlike Monogram has one very good film (Macbeth).\n\nPRC / Eagle-Lion\n\nThe Producers Releasing Corporation began in 1939, submitted their first films to the Oscars in 1940 and submitted small amounts through 1944 (30 total) and then ramped up production starting in 1945 with at least 33 Oscar submissions each year for the rest of the decade and ended up with more submitted films in the decade (214) than Warners or UA. They even earned 5 combined nominations for three films. In 1947, it was bought out by J. Arthur Rank’s Eagle-Lion (which had been formed to distribute British films in the U.S.), so I count the studios together for tracking purposes. As Eagle-Lion, it managed a Best Picture nomination in 1948 for The Red Shoes, the first Poverty Row studio to do so (although, since it was a British import, it’s not really a Poverty Row production). I’ve seen 165 of the combined films for 77.10%. As PRC, no film earned above a 67, but Eagle-Lion’s imports include Michael Powell’s A Canterbury Tale and several Ealing films including Kind Hearts and Coronets and It Always Rains on Sunday. They average 51.27 for the decade but it’s worth noting that breaks down as 47.5 for PRC and 58.4 for Eagle-Lion.\n\nSGP / Lippert Films\n\nRobert L. Lippert began Screen Guild Productions in 1945 but changed the name to his own in 1948. It didn’t matter. The films were awful (41.26), they aren’t as easy to find (58.82% of 51) and they didn’t earn any Oscar nominations.\n\nForeign Distributors\n\nThis refers to American based distributors that released films made in a different country. My cut-off here is at least 30 submitted films and that bulk of the films they release not be American products. Of the 6 studios that I track like this on my spreadsheet, only one had more than 13 Oscar submissions in the 40s. Overall, I’ve seen over 90% of the 73 submitted films I list in this category.\n\nArtkino\n\nArtkino specialized in Soviet films. The Soviets specialized in World War II films (18) and color Musicals (14). The distributor submitted 52 films in the 40s and I’ve seen all but two of them. They average a very solid 65.45 because while there are only two films above *** (Ivan the Terrible Part I, Distant Journey, the latter one of the very few non-Soviet films distributed by Artkino), no film is below **.5 and only six are below ***.\n\nThe Rest\n\nThere’s nothing to discuss here for the 40s. No distributor submitted more than 25 films to the Oscars that isn’t already listed above. The films not covered by majors, indies and foreign account for just 212 films, less than 1/3 of the indies and barely more than 1/10 of the majors. I’ve seen 68.87% of them.\n\nThe Brits\n\nI am forced to treat Ealing and Hammer in a different way. Neither of them actually acted as distributors in the U.S. but I track their films nonetheless for the same reasons that I wrote those two posts. Hammer hadn’t yet found its way. Most of their films in the 40s never even got U.S. releases and they’re terrible (46.5) and there are only 8 of them. Ealing is very different. First of all, there are 24 films in the decade and almost all of them earned U.S. distribution through a variety of studios (12 of them), the most through Universal (six) then Eagle-Lion (six). What became known as the Ealing Comedies were in full stride by the end of the decade which amounts to an average of 70.3 with 15 Comedy noms and 6 wins in 1949 alone with a lot more coming in the 50s.\n\nThe Best Films by Studio, 1940-1949\n\nnote: Must have a minimum of 50 films and must have a film that is ***.5 or higher.\n\nColumbia: His Girl Friday\n\nEagle-Lion: A Canterbury Tale\n\nFox: The Grapes of Wrath\n\nMGM: The Philadelphia Story\n\nParamount: Sullivan’s Travels / Double Indemnity\n\nRepublic: Macbeth\n\nRKO Radio: Citizen Kane\n\nUnited Artists: Rebecca / The Great Dictator\n\nUniversal: Great Expectations / Brief Encounter\n\nWarner Bros: Casablanca\n\nThe Worst Films by Studio, 1940-1949\n\nnote: Must have a minimum of 50 films and must have a film that is ** or lower.\n\nColumbia: The Fuller Brush Man\n\nEagle-Lion: Blonde Savage\n\nFox: Whirlpool\n\nMGM: Wyoming\n\nMonogram: Bad Boy\n\nParamount: The Hitler Gang\n\nPRC: I Accuse My Parents\n\nRepublic: The Vampire’s Ghost\n\nRKO Radio: Riverboat Rhythm\n\nUnited Artists: The Outlaw\n\nUniversal: Salome Where She Danced\n\nWarner Bros: The Fountainhead (double-check)\n\nForeign Films\n\nIn the 1940s, I have seen 316 films primarily not in English. However, only 249 of those count towards my Nighthawk Awards and are part of the statistics (8.19% of the films for the decade). Understandably, the numbers really go down during the war when most of the world was too busy dying to make films. Then at the end of the decade, films really started arriving. Though the average dips just slightly from the 30s (again), it’s still, at 68.08, better than any genre by far.\n\nForeign Films by Year\n\nThis list has two numbers and a percentage. The first number is how many films from that year I have seen, no matter what year they were eligible. The second number are the films that count towards my Nighthawk Awards in those years with the percentage of total films from that year following after.\n\nI should note two things. First, my Foreign Film award is based off the film’s original release (or when it would have been eligible for Foreign Film at the Oscars, even though that award didn’t begin until 1948) although for all other awards, the film goes in the year where it first played L.A.. Second, if the film never played in the States, I put it in the original film year.\n\n1940 – 9 / 14 (4.13%)\n\n1941 – 18 / 12 (4.12%)\n\n1942 – 22 / 17 (6.01%)\n\n1943 – 23 / 10 (3.98%)\n\n1944 – 22 / 4 (1.86%)\n\n1945 – 24 / 19 (6.64%)\n\n1946 – 40 / 22 (7.07%)\n\n1947 – 47 / 42 (11.97%)\n\n1948 – 48 / 34 (10.53%)\n\n1949 – 63 / 75 (19.28%)\n\nThe Ten Countries I’ve Seen The Most Films, 1940-1949\n\nFrance – 88\n\nUSSR – 58\n\nItaly – 55\n\nMexico – 35\n\nJapan – 20\n\nGermany – 10\n\nSweden – 9\n\nChina – 8\n\nWest Germany – 5\n\nIndia / Argentina – 3\n\nThese numbers (and the next few lists) are for the actual films, not the Nighthawk eligible numbers. In the 1930s, almost 72% of the foreign films I’ve seen in the decade came from France, Germany or the USSR. This time, with Germany devastated by war and then split in two, almost 2/3 of the films come France, Italy or the USSR.\n\nNighthawk Points, 1940-1949\n\nFrance – 200\n\nJapan – 160\n\nItaly – 160\n\nHungary – 60\n\nSweden – 40\n\nDenmark – 40\n\nUSSR – 20\n\nBelgium – 20\n\nCzechoslovakia – 20\n\nThat’s the whole list.\n\nWeighted Nighthawk Points for Foreign Film by Director, 1940-1949\n\nAkira Kurosawa – 176\n\nRoberto Rossellini – 124\n\nJean Cocteau – 94\n\nMarcel Carne – 80\n\nVittorio de Sica – 71\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Pabst – 40\n\nYasujiro Ozu – 40\n\nAlf Sjoberg – 40\n\nGeza von Radvanyi – 30\n\nSergei Eisenstein / Istvan Szots – 31\n\nnote: Unlike the Director, Actor and Actress lists above, this is actually based on the weighted version of the Nighthawk Award (40-1) depending on place.\n\nThe Best Film I’ve Seen By Country, 1940-1949\n\nBelgium – The Crab with the Golden Claws\n\nCzechoslovakia – Distant Journey\n\nDenmark – Day of Wrath\n\nFrance – Children of Paradise\n\nHungary – It Happened in Europe\n\nItaly – The Bicycle Thieves\n\nJapan – Stray Dog\n\nSweden – Torment\n\nUSSR – Ivan the Terrible Part I\n\nlists explanation\n\nThe lists down below were created from my Top 1000 list leading up to the full revelation of the list. There is also a bottom 10 list. But I am not doing a list of in-between films like I did for the Genre and Studio posts. I am also not doing links because it takes a really long time. Most of the reviews of these films can be found by searching on the site for any of the years involved and then clicking on either Adapted Screenplay, Best Picture, Nighthawk Awards or Year in Film.\n\nSince there aren’t any links to confuse things, I did decide to color-code them (red won the Oscar for Best Picture, blue was nominated).

Most films of the 40s deserve their acclaim. There are a few that are a bit over-rated but even some of those have gone up in my estimation over the years (The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus) and none are badly over-rated with most of them still being solid *** films. But Detour gets great acclaim (Top 600 at TSPDT, Ebert Great Film, National Film Registry as early as 1992) and I just don’t understand it. It’s very badly acted and badly written and even the direction isn’t all that good.\n\nThe Statistics – 1940s\n\nTotal Films I Have Seen, 1940-1949: 3161\n\nTotal Films Used For Statistics Below: 3039\n\nnote: Because I track statistics by “Oscar Year”, the following statistics only use the 3039 films, some of which come from the 1930s or even 1920s.\n\nBy Genre:\n\nDrama: 720\n\nComedy: 560\n\nWestern: 367\n\nMusical: 348\n\nMystery: 246\n\nCrime: 217\n\nSuspense: 155\n\nWar: 137\n\nAdventure: 117\n\nHorror: 63\n\nKids: 48\n\nFantasy: 29\n\nAction: 26\n\nSci-Fi: 6\n\n% of All Films That are Drama:\n\n1940: 26.84%\n\n1941: 21.31%\n\n1942: 21.55%\n\n1943: 17.13%\n\n1944: 27.44%\n\n1945: 19.23%\n\n1946: 21.86%\n\n1947: 24.50%\n\n1948: 24.77%\n\n1949: 29.56%\n\nTOTAL: 23.69%\n\n% of All Films That are Genre (non-Drama / Comedy / Musical):\n\n1940: 41.89%\n\n1941: 41.24%\n\n1942: 43.46%\n\n1943: 48.21%\n\n1944: 38.60%\n\n1945: 50.00%\n\n1946: 50.16%\n\n1947: 50.43%\n\n1948: 49.23%\n\n1949: 48.07%\n\nTOTAL: 46.43%\n\n% of All Films That Are Foreign Language:\n\n1940: 4.13%\n\n1941: 4.12%\n\n1942: 6.01%\n\n1943: 3.98%\n\n1944: 1.86%\n\n1945: 6.64%\n\n1946: 7.07%\n\n1947: 11.97%\n\n1948: 10.53%\n\n1949: 19.28%\n\nTOTAL: 8.19%\n\nAverage Film by Year:\n\n1940: 57.97\n\n1941: 59.19\n\n1942: 59.26\n\n1943: 58.82\n\n1944: 58.26\n\n1945: 57.20\n\n1946: 57.42\n\n1947: 57.74\n\n1948: 57.33\n\n1949: 58.61\n\nTOTAL: 58.16\n\nAverage Film by Genre:\n\nWar: 63.20\n\nFantasy: 62.62\n\nDrama: 62.61\n\nKids: 61.83\n\nSuspense: 61.18\n\nMusical: 59.24\n\nComedy: 58.32\n\nMystery: 55.28\n\nCrime: 55.11\n\nHorror: 54.52\n\nSci-Fi: 54.00\n\nAdventure: 53.01\n\nWestern: 50.74\n\nAction: 50.62\n\nTop 10 Finishes by Genre:\n\nDrama: 41\n\nComedy: 19\n\nSuspense: 11\n\nCrime: 6\n\nMystery: 6\n\nWar: 5\n\nKids: 4\n\nWestern: 4\n\nMusical: 2\n\nFantasy: 1\n\nHorror: 1\n\nTop 20 Finishes by Genre:\n\nDrama: 75\n\nComedy: 37\n\nSuspense: 23\n\nWar: 15\n\nCrime: 14\n\nMystery: 9\n\nKids: 8\n\nWestern: 7\n\nMusical: 6\n\nFantasy: 3\n\nHorror: 2\n\nAdventure: 1\n\nTotal Films By Studio (Top 10):\n\nUniversal: 346\n\nMGM: 336\n\nRKO Radio: 326\n\nColumbia: 315\n\n20th Century-Fox: 281\n\nWarner Brothers: 251\n\nParamount: 250\n\nUnited Artists: 174\n\nPRC / Eagle-Lion Films: 164\n\nRepublic: 135\n\nThe “Major” Studios by Average:\n\nnote: “Major” is in quotes because according to the standard definition of “The Majors”, Columbia, Disney, Universal, United Artists didn’t count.\n\nnote: Disney only has 13 films.\n\nDisney: 78.83\n\nUnited Artists: 61.54\n\nMGM: 61.14\n\n20th Century-Fox: 60.75\n\nWarner Brothers: 60.56\n\nParamount: 58.19\n\nUniversal: 57.91\n\nRKO Radio: 57.73\n\nColumbia: 54.23\n\nTop 10 Finishes by “Major” Studio:\n\nRKO Radio: 15\n\nParamount: 14\n\nWarner Brothers: 11\n\n20th Century-Fox: 9\n\nMGM: 9\n\nUnited Artists: 9\n\nUniversal: 8\n\nColumbia: 4\n\nDisney: 3\n\nNotes on Top 10 Finishes\n\nTotal Percentage of Top 20 Films Distributed by “Majors”: 82%\n\n4 Top 10 Films\n\nRKO: 1941, 1946\n\nParamount: 1944\n\nUA: 1945\n\nTop 20 Finishes by “Major” Studio:\n\nRKO Radio: 25\n\nWarner Brothers: 23\n\nMGM: 22\n\nParamount: 22\n\n20th Century-Fox: 21\n\nUnited Artists: 21\n\nUniversal: 18\n\nDisney: 6\n\nColumbia: 4\n\nNotes on Top 20 Finishes\n\nTotal Percentage of Top 20 Films Distributed by “Majors”: 58.33%\n\nRKO has 7 Top 20 films in 1941\n\nNo other studio has more than 5 in any year\n\nColumbia never has more than 1 in any year\n\nNo studio has a Top 20 film in every year\n\nFox, RKO and WB have 9 of the 10 years\n\nBreakdown by Star Rating:\n\n****: 2.01%\n\n***.5: 2.76%\n\n***: 36.72%\n\n**.5: 31.42%\n\n**: 26.42%\n\n*.5: 0.39%\n\n*: 0.23%\n\n.5: 0.00%\n\n0: 0.03%\n\nNighthawk Awards\n\nThis area will have a lot more than I usually do in this section. This is an in-depth look at all the films and I what I think of them when it comes to awards. Please note that it does run off my “Film Years” which means that there are films from the 40s which won’t appear because they wouldn’t have an L.A. release until after 1949. The most notable of those, of course, is The Third Man but also Kind Hearts and Coronets and every Kurosawa film from this decade, some of which get pushed as far as 1980. These awards have also been heavily affected by revelations about which year certain films belong in (most notably moving La belle et la bête from 1947 to 1948).\n\nBecause of the way I keep track of my lists, there are no “ties” for the 10th spot. The first film to reach that amount gets to keep that spot.\n\nNumber of Films That Earn Nominations: 245\n\nNumber of Films That Win Nighthawks: 80\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 163\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 40\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 888\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 203\n\nDirector with Most Nighthawk Nominated Films: Alfred Hitchcock (11)\n\nBest Film with No Nighthawks: The Big Sleep\n\nBest Film with No Nighthawk Nominations: My Darling Clementine\n\nWeakest Best Picture Nominee: Fanny\n\nBest Film Not Nominated for Picture: Henry V\n\nNumber of Films That Earn Comedy Nominations: 53\n\nNumber of Films That Win Comedy Awards: 30\n\nTotal Number of Comedy Nominations: 187\n\nTotal Number of Comedy Wins: 71\n\nBest Comedy Film With No Nominations: Road to Morocco\n\nWeakest Comedy Picture Nominee: Saludos Amigos\n\nBest Comedy Not Nominated For Picture: The Shop Around the Corner\n\nNumber of Films That Earn Drama Nominations: 137\n\nNumber of Films That Win Drama Awards: 46\n\nTotal Number of Drama Nominations: 418\n\nTotal Number of Drama Wins: 89\n\nBest Drama Film With No Nominations: Brute Force\n\nWeakest Drama Picture Nominee: Now Voyager\n\nBest Drama Not Nominated For Picture: Henry V\n\nBest Film Without a Top 10 Finish: They Live By Night\n\nBest Film Without a Top 20 Finish: n/a\n\nTrivia:\n\nOnly three Comedy films that meet my Best Picture threshold (***.5 or ****) fail to earn a Best Picture – Comedy nomination and all three are in the same year, (1940): The Baker’s Wife, Pride and Prejudice (both squeaking into low ***.5) and The Shop Around the Corner (low ****). Shop is the 13th best Comedy in the decade and better than four different films that win Picture – Comedy but is just stuck in what is by far the best year. In fact, after 1942, no year even has a full Best Picture slate.\n\nThey Live By Night, the only film over *** to fail to earn a Top 10 finish earns 10 Top 20 finishes, including 4 11th place finishes.\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations:\n\nChildren of Paradise – 15\n\nCitizen Kane – 14\n\nThe Maltese Falcon – 13\n\nGaslight – 13\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 13\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 12\n\nRebecca – 12\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy – 12\n\nCasablanca – 12\n\nDouble Indemnity – 12\n\nMost Nighthawks:\n\nCitizen Kane – 12\n\nChildren of Paradise – 12\n\nCasablanca – 9\n\nGreat Expectations – 8\n\nLa belle et la bête – 8\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 6\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons – 6\n\nGaslight – 6\n\nThe Life and Death of Colonel Blimp – 6\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 6\n\nMost Nighthawk Points:\n\nChildren of Paradise – 755\n\nCitizen Kane – 705\n\nCasablanca – 685\n\nGreat Expectations – 610\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 595\n\nGaslight – 580\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 580\n\nDouble Indemnity – 575\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls – 560\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 555\n\nMost Drama Nominations:\n\nThe Little Foxes – 9\n\nThe Maltese Falcon – 9\n\nThe Best Years of our Lives – 9\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls – 8\n\nRebecca – 7\n\nMrs. Miniver – 7\n\nCasablanca – 7\n\nGaslight – 7\n\nDouble Indemnity – 7\n\nChildren of Paradise – 7\n\nMost Drama Wins:\n\nCasablanca – 5\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 4\n\nCitizen Kane – 4\n\nGaslight – 4\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 4\n\nMost Drama Points:\n\nCasablanca – 505\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 440\n\nThe Little Foxes – 435\n\nChildren of Paradise – 435\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 420\n\nGaslight – 415\n\nThe Best Years of our Lives – 415\n\nRebecca – 410\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls – 410\n\nDouble Indemnity – 410\n\nMost Comedy Nominations:\n\nArsenic and Old Lace – 9\n\nThe Miracle of Morgan’s Creek – 8\n\nHail the Conquering Hero – 8\n\nThe Philadelphia Story – 7\n\nHere Comes Mr. Jordan – 7\n\nThe Lady Eve – 7\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy – 7\n\nThe Palm Beach Story – 7\n\nThe Great Dictator – 6\n\nHis Girl Friday – 6\n\nMost Comedy Wins:\n\nThe Philadelphia Story – 6\n\nThe More the Merrier – 5\n\nThe Miracle of Morgan’s Creek – 5\n\nState of the Union – 5\n\nHere Comes Mr. Jordan – 4\n\nMost Comedy Points:\n\nThe Philadelphia Story – 530\n\nThe More the Merrier – 515\n\nThe Miracle of Morgan’s Creek – 495\n\nHere Comes Mr. Jordan – 415\n\nState of the Union – 410\n\nArsenic and Old Lace – 405\n\nThe Great Dictator – 395\n\nThe Lady Eve – 395\n\nPassport to Pimlico – 385\n\nSullivan’s Travels – 380\n\nMost Film Points:\n\nnote: This is the point value I assign in all the various categories added up on a scale of 0-9.\n\nChildren of Paradise – 115\n\nCitizen Kane – 102\n\nThe Maltese Falcon – 96\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 91\n\nCasablanca – 89\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 88\n\nLa belle et la bête – 86\n\nGaslight – 86\n\nRebecca – 85\n\nThe Third Man – 84\n\nnote: All 10 of these films would have come in 2nd place in the 30s.\n\nMost Weighted Film Points:\n\nnote: This is the point value I assign in all the various categories added up on a scale of 0-9, but then weighted to account for their Oscar points, with 8 being the equivalent of an Oscar win. So, for Picture, the point scale is 1=12, 2=25, 3=37, 4=50, 5=62, 6=75, 7=87, 8=100, 9=115.\n\nChildren of Paradise – 831\n\nThe Maltese Falcon – 775\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 753\n\nCitizen Kane – 731\n\nCasablanca – 727\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 704\n\nRebecca – 682\n\nGaslight – 669\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life – 667\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 642\n\nMost Weighted Acting Points:\n\nnote: The same as the above category, but only using the acting points. Because this is weighted (which gives more to lead than supporting), this is not quite the same list I use for doing my Best Ensemble award but it’s close.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 271\n\nThe Maltese Falcon – 255\n\nThe Little Foxes – 248\n\nRebecca – 244\n\nThe Philadelphia Story – 243\n\nCasablanca – 228\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life – 226\n\nChildren of Paradise – 225\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls – 225\n\nNotorious – 219\n\nMost Weighted Tech Points:\n\nnote: The same as the above category, but only using the Tech categories. Because this is weighted (which gives more to the major categories), this is not quite the same list I use for doing my Best Tech award but it’s close. While there is no maximum possible for the acting category, the maximum here is 386.\n\nCitizen Kane – 311\n\nChildren of Paradise – 301\n\nLa belle et la bête – 262\n\nGreat Expectations – 233\n\nHenry V – 232\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 217\n\nThe Maltese Falcon – 215\n\nGaslight – 214\n\nCasablanca – 204\n\nDouble Indemnity – 189\n\nMost Top 20 Points:\n\nnote: This takes a film’s finish in any Nighthawk category and gives it points based on a finish in the Top 20. A win is 20 points, a 2nd place is 19, down to 20th place which is 1 point. All categories are equal.\n\nChildren of Paradise – 306\n\nCitizen Kane – 301\n\nRebecca – 282\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls – 280\n\nThe Maltese Falcon – 273\n\nThe Great Dictator – 263\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 252\n\nCasablanca – 251\n\nGaslight – 250\n\nLa belle et la bête – 242\n\nMost Top 20 Weighted Points:\n\nnote: This takes a film’s finish in any Nighthawk category and gives it points based on a finish in the Top 20. However, this weights the categories on a scale based on the award points, both for the win and the nominations. So, the scale for Picture, in descending order is 100, 77, 70, 67, 63 (it then drops because you can’t have more than 50 points, which is what you get for a nomination), 43, 40, 38, 36, 33, 18, 17, 15, 13, 12, 8, 7, 4, 3, 2. It’s designed to give more weight to Top 5 and Top 10 finishes. The scale is roughly the same for all of the categories, beginning with its point total for the award.\n\nChildren of Paradise – 825\n\nCitizen Kane – 769\n\nCasablanca – 760\n\nThe Maltese Falcon – 696\n\nGaslight – 695\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls – 687\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 687\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 680\n\nDouble Indemnity – 671\n\nGreat Expectations – 670\n\nNighthawk Awards, 1940-1949\n\nnote: These are my all-time Top 5 in each category in the decade. Films in red won the Oscar. Films in blue were Oscar nominated. There are a few lists here that aren’t in my usual Nighthawk Awards. I also don’t discuss as much since there are fewer awards groups and I have discussed the quality of these so many other places.\n\nBest Picture\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nCasablanca\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nThe Third Man\n\nAnalysis: The Consensus winner for the decade is Best Years of Our Lives, the first film to win four Best Picture awards (Oscar, NYFC, BAFTC, Globe). After that, five films tie with four winning the Oscar, NYFC and GG (Going My Way, Lost Weekend, Gentleman’s Agreement, All the King’s Men) while Treasure of the Sierra Madre lost the Oscar and BAFTA and won the NYFC and Globe.\n\nThe Academy did well with winners in this decade with 8 of the 10 making my Top 100 and five in the Top 40. The winners average an 88.4 which is ****. Even adding in all the nominees gives an average of 81.0 which is mid ***.5 and almost as good as the winners alone in the 30s. Only five films below *** earn nominations and only one bad film (All This and Heaven Too). Only two years make the Top 40 for Best Picture years but only one year (1942) is low enough to rank among any of the years in the 30s, so it’s a big improvement.\n\nThe oddest nominee is probably One Foot in Heaven, with just a single nomination in a stacked year. Probably the oddest omission is Brief Encounter, nominated for Director, Screenplay and Actress but pushed out in favor of Razor’s Edge. Historically, of course, the oddest win is How Green Was My Valley but Hollywood politics played into Citizen Kane not winning. On the other hand, Hamlet overcame Hollywood politics to become the first British film to win and it did it with far fewer nominations than Johnny Belinda and failing to win Director. Actually, Hamlet and All the King’s Men are both odd winners in that they are great and very good but lost Director better films and they would be the last two films to win Picture without winning Director or Screenplay until 2000. All the mediocre titles to win in the years between (Greatest Show on Earth, Around the World in 80 Days, Gigi, Out of Africa, Braveheart) all won Director or Screenplay.\n\nThe NYFC winners were very strong (91.2) with only Going My Way being below high ***.5. The NBR was less but still solid (88.7) with None but the Lonely Heart a poor choice and True Glory, a documentary, an odd winner in 1945. The two agreed from 1940-42 and the NBR made better choices in 1943 (Ox-Bow Incident over Watch on the Rhine) and 49 (Bicycle Thieves over All the King’s Men). From 1940-43 no NYFC won the Oscar but after that five of the last six did. No NBR winner won the Oscar.\n\nThe Globe winners are good (84.0) but not great. Five of the eight win the Oscar which is odd because two films tie in 1948 and neither wins the Oscar, though Hamlet won Foreign Film at the Globes and won the Oscar.\n\nBest Director\n\nOrson Welles (Citizen Kane)\n\nMarcel Carne (Children of Paradise)\n\nJohn Huston (The Maltese Falcon)\n\nCarol Reed (The Third Man)\n\nJohn Huston (Treasure of the Sierra Madre)\n\nAnalysis: There are actually nine directors that earn a perfect 9 so it’s a tough category to decide upon.\n\nThe top five directors in terms of Consensus points (and bear in mind that Director is the one category where the Consensus makes use of not only the Nighthawk but also various festivals because the whole category is one of the categories in my Top 100 rankings) are Elia Kazan (Gentleman’s Agreement / Boomerang), Huston, Billy Wilder (Lost Weekend), William Wyler (Best Years of Our Lives) and John Ford (Grapes of Wrath / Long Voyage Home). The extra films listed for Kazan and Ford are especially relevant; they earned the NYFC for both films in both cases and they both earned extra Nighthawk points. Kazan was the only director to sweep the Oscar, Globe, NYFC and NBR, although it’s worth mentioning that the last one didn’t even exist until 1946. Which is also why it’s worth mentioning the top finishers in percentage as well which are Wilder, Kazan, Ford, Huston and Leo McCarey (Going My Way), the last of which is impressive since he earns no Nighthawk points. Kazan’s record number of Consensus points would only last until 1950 while Wilder’s total isn’t even a record (John Ford had a higher percentage in 1935) but would be the highest total between 1935 and 2000. Because of the lack of other awards, all of the Top 5 in percentage are still in the Top 15 all-time.\n\nAs is often the case, the Oscar winners average slightly higher than in Picture (89.4 to 88.4). Ford and Wyler would each win two Oscars while Wilder, Kazan and Mankiewicz would each win their first. Wyler would earn a massive 315 points in the decade (good enough for the Top 10 all-time). After being nominated in 1939 he would earn noms in 1940 and 1941 and a win in 1942 making him the only director to ever earn four straight noms (then he went to war and then won the Oscar with his first film back).\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nCasablanca\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nAnalysis: Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Brief Encounter are the perfect 9’s that don’t make the Top 5.\n\nTreasure is the top film once the Consensus Awards begin in 1948 with the arrival of the WGA (and the very short-lived NBR award). By winning 3 awards among 4 noms (thanks to WGA categories which will disappear and an NBR award which will go away for decades after 1949), Treasure has 3 wins, 4 noms and 264 points, all records which will be tied in 1950 but not exceeded until 1966 after the BAFTA and NYFC awards have begun.\n\nIn this confusing Oscar era, three films win Screenplay as well as Story even though one of those, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, was adapted and shouldn’t have been eligible for Story. All the 1942-46 Picture winners win Screenplay with four others earning noms (Hamlet is the outlier) which means all the Picture winners in the 40s are adapted. It also makes the Oscar Scores hard to do (67.0) though the winners are generally good (3.3).\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nSullivan’s Travels\n\nThe Third Man\n\nStairway to Heaven\n\nAnalysis: As opposed to Adapted, Stairway makes it in as an 8.\n\nThe Search and Battleground will top the initial Consensus Awards in different ways. Both win the Oscar for Story and the Globe while The Search earns a “Screenplay” nom at the Oscars and Battleground earns a WGA nom. Both will be beaten in 1950 anyway.\n\nOriginal is much weaker than Adapted with a 53.7 Oscar Score and a 5.3 average winner rank and only Citizen Kane is the best choice of its year while four of the winners were the worst of the nominees, the worst Oscar category at all. Including the Story winners, the 19 films (no Story category in 1945) average a 73.9 and only three great films win the Oscar (Great McGinty, Citizen Kane, Miracle on 34th Street).\n\nBest Actor:\n\nHumphrey Bogart (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre)\n\nOrson Welles (Citizen Kane)\n\nHenry Fonda (The Grapes of Wrath)\n\nJames Stewart (It’s a Wonderful Life)\n\nRay Milland (The Lost Weekend)\n\nAnalysis: The perfect 9’s that don’t make it are Cagney (Yankee Doodle Dandy, which kills me to cut) and Bogie twice (Maltese, Casablanca).\n\nRay Milland is still the all-time Consensus percentage winner, followed by Paul Lukas. The top 5 in points are Milland, Lukas (Watch on the Rhine) tied with Olivier (Hamlet) and Broderick Crawford (All the King’s Men) followed by Olivier again (Henry V). Lukas is the first with three wins and Milland the first to sweep all four wins (the only to sweep all the awards while there are just four – the next sweep comes in 1955 when there are five).\n\nThe Oscar Score is mostly solid with a total of 75.0 and no year above 87.5 (1940) and no year below 55.9 (1948). The winners average a 3.1 but take out Gary Cooper’s 1941 win and the average is 2.3 with the Oscar going to my 2nd place finisher in 1944 and 46-49 but only my winner in 42 and 45.\n\nThe Oscars are topped by a three-way tie between Gregory Peck (4 noms), Laurence Olivier (3 noms but 1 win) and Gary Cooper (3 consecutive noms, winning the first one). But Bogie doubles anybody’s else points at the Nighthawks, winning twice and earning four other noms including two in 1941.\n\nBest Actress\n\nIngrid Bergman (Gaslight)\n\nOlivia de Havilland (The Heiress)\n\nKatharine Hepburn (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nOlivia de Havilland (The Snake Pit)\n\nRosalind Russell (His Girl Friday)\n\nAnalysis: Bergman’s performance is actually the only perfect 9 in the decade.\n\nJoan Crawford (Mildred Pierce) is the first to win three awards but Olivia de Havilland (The Heiress) has the highest Consensus point total in the decade, followed by Crawford, de Havilland again (The Snake Pit) and Joan Fontaine (Suspicion) before we get several actresses in a tie. Points are low for historical purposes but de Havilland’s 1949 percentage is the highest post-1928. Her 1948 percentage is still the highest all-time for someone who didn’t win the Oscar. On the other hand, de Havilland’s Oscar win in 1946 (To Each Her Own) and Loretta Young’s in 1947 (Farmer’s Daughter) are the only post-1942 Oscar winners to receive no other points and are joined only by Elizabeth Taylor in 1960 for Oscar winners with no other wins.\n\nThe Oscar nominees aren’t bad (74.2 Oscar Score) but the winners include two of the worst picks ever (Rogers in 1940, Young). The overall 4.4 rank of Oscar winners is the worst until the 80s. 1947 has the worst Score in the category’s history (44.0) but it’s followed in 1948 with new peak of 93.3.\n\nBergman (280; 2 wins, 6 total noms) and Davis (210; 6 noms) are the tops at the Nighthawk Awards. Greer Garson (1 win among 5 straight noms) and de Havilland (2 wins, 2 more noms) top the Oscars with 210 points each.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nClaude Rains (Casablanca)\n\nWalter Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre)\n\nOrson Welles (The Third Man)\n\nSidney Greenstreet (The Maltese Falcon)\n\nClaude Rains (Notorious)\n\nAnalysis: Rains sneaks in without a perfect 9 for his second performance.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald complicates the Consensus by winning both the Oscar and Globe but also earning an Oscar nom in Actor (before the rules changed). Edmund Gwenn (1947) and Walter Huston (1948) also win the Oscar and Globe.\n\nCharles Coburn is the tops at the Oscars with 120 points (one win, two other noms). The Oscar Score is a solid 78.7 with no year below 69 and a perfect 100 in 1945. The winners average a 3.7 finish but that’s because Walter Brennan in 1940 finishes in 12th; after him every winner at least makes my Top 5 though Walter Huston is the only winner I agree with.\n\nRains dominates the Nighthawks, of course. He earns more points in the decade (240) than any other actor has earned Nighthawk points ever in this category. He wins 43 and 46, with his 43 win coming in the middle of four straight noms (and he adds another in 1949).\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nJudith Anderson (Rebecca)\n\nMaria Casares (Children of Paradise)\n\nGloria Grahame (Crossfire)\n\nTeresa Wright (The Little Foxes)\n\nKatina Paxinou (For Whom the Bell Tolls)\n\nAnalysis: Anderson and Casares are the only 9 scores in the decade.\n\nThe Consensus Awards don’t really matter at this point with the Globes making a second award in 1943 and a third not being added until the 50s. Four actresses do win both the Oscar and Globe (Paxinou, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, Mercedes McCambridge).\n\nOnly twice in the decade did the Academy make the right choice (Paxinou and Mercedes McCambridge in 1949) but the overall win rank of 2.7 isn’t too bad and no winner ranks below 6th. The Oscar Score is 79.4, actually the best of the acting categories in the decade with 1942 and 1948 earning perfect 100 scores and only 1946 (a dismal 38.2, the worst score in any acting category after 1938 and second worst after 1930) falling below 70.\n\nEthel Barrymore is tops at the Oscars with 150 points (win, three other noms) followed by Anne Revere with 120 points (win, two other noms). The Nighthawks are topped by Agnes Moorhead (two wins, one nom), Teresa Wright and Angela Lansbury (a win and two other noms each).\n\nBest Supporting Actor (total)\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (15)\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre (14)\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives (13)\n\nCasablanca (12)\n\nOliver Twist (12)\n\nAnalysis: This adds up all the points for Supporting Actor. I won’t include films with less than 10 points since 9 points is what you can get for a single performance. It’s worth pointing out that I consider Dana Andrews supporting in Best Years and not a lead.\n\nBest Supporting Actress (total)\n\nThe Little Foxes (14)\n\nGentleman’s Agreement (14)\n\nMrs. Miniver (12)\n\nAnalysis: This adds up all the points for Supporting Actress. I won’t include films with less than 10 points since 9 points is what you can get for a single performance. Two of the three films have Teresa Wright in them. Unlike the above list, which earned four noms (and two wins) for five films, these three films won two Oscars as well as earned six combined noms (all six of the performances I list).\n\nBest Ensemble\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives (34)\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (32)\n\nThe Little Foxes (32)\n\nThe Philadelphia Story (30)\n\nRebecca (30)\n\nAnalysis: This adds up all the acting points across the categories. None are as strong as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was but the rest are better than the other four nominees from the 30s.\n\nFor the second straight decade, no film wins both the Ensemble Award and Picture at the Nighthawks and two of the Ensemble winners don’t even earn ***.5 (Mrs. Miniver, Johnny Belinda).\n\nBest Editing:\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nThe Third Man\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nCasablanca\n\nAnalysis: Just remember that Citizen Kane lost to Sergeant York, The Third Man to King Solomon’s Mines and Casablanca to Air Force. The average Oscar winner is a 72.2 and only Best Years of Our Lives is better than a 79. Ironically, the average Oscar nominee (not winner) is 76.8 with 12 great films among them. The average Oscar winner ranks at 11.6, the only category to average in double digits. The Oscar Score is an abysmal 36.7 which is actually an improvement over the 30s. 1944 earns a complete zero.\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nThe Third Man\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nAnalysis: A category with too many 9 scores as La belle et la bête and Grapes of Wrath couldn’t make the Top 5. And of them even won Oscars although one wasn’t until 1950.\n\nThe Oscar Scores are pretty dismal, 49.3 for Color and 41.3 for Black and White, although both are improvements upon the 30s. Through the war the Color category actually nominates every worthy film but then plummets after the war. The winners are generally much better for Color (2.4 to 8.8). The Oscars are topped by Leon Shamroy and Arthur Miller with 225 points each which is still a record for any decade helped by the seemingly limitless nominations. The absolute points list for the Nighthawks is topped by Gregg Toland of course by a considerable margin.\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nMaurice Thiriet (Children of Paradise)\n\nDavid Raksin (Laura)\n\nBernard Herrmann (Citizen Kane)\n\nAnton Karas (The Third Man)\n\nMax Steiner (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre)\n\nAnalysis: A lot of great scores but nothing that quite reaches the immortal level with a lot of 8’s and no 9’s. Max Steiner lands in 5th just as he did in the 30s.\n\nThe Top 5 in absolute points at the Nighthawks are Max Steiner (way ahead of anyone else), Miklos Rosza, Franz Waxman, Bernard Herrmann and Alfred Newman. Thiriet and Raksin compose the two best scores of the decade but neither earns any other points.\n\nMax Steiner amazes with a nomination every single year but Alfred Newman (who only misses a nomination in 1949), with 3 Oscars and 7 other nominations earns a massive 500 points which is good enough for 5th all-time by itself. Morris Stoloff, Rosza and Ray Heindorf all also earn at least 300 points. Between multiple categories and seemingly unlimited nominations, the total points for all composers this decade is 6975, compared to 1525 in the 00’s.\n\nBest Sound:\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nThe Third Man\n\nFantasia\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nAnalysis: The lowest Oscar Score once again with a 32.1 which is eight points above the 30s. In 1946 and 1949 it finally breaks 50 for the first time (though it won’t break 60 until 1970). At 9.5, the winners are the second worst among all Oscar categories. In three years they pick the best (1942, 1946, 1947) but in all other years they pick the worst or second worst.\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nLa belle et la bête\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nGreat Expecations\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons\n\nAnalysis: There are five perfect 9’s and they are all iconic in their looks.\n\nColor Art Direction is the second best Tech award (and the best with more than two years). It bottoms out with a zero in 1941 but has a perfect 100 in 1948 and two other scores above 80 and a total score of 63.2. Black and White is much worse with a total of 38.8 and only two years above 50. The color winner (2.9) are also much better than B&W (6.4).\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nLa belle et la bête\n\nThe Heiress\n\nHenry V\n\nIvan the Terrible Part I\n\nAnalysis: The top two earn a perfect 9. The category would finally start at the Oscars in 1948, long overdue. The first year both categories were okay (60.0) while in 1949 the color was terrible (37.5) and the black and white was fantastic (90.0). None of the winners were bad choices.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nThe Thief of Baghdad\n\nLa belle et la bête\n\nSpellbound\n\nMighty Joe Young\n\nAnalysis: A terrible decade for the category and the Oscars made it worse for the most part with what they nominated and awarded. The overall Oscar Score is 48.0 but that’s because is usually earned a zero (if they didn’t nominate the few films worth nominating) or 100 (if they did). Four times the Oscars awarded the best film which is better than most categories.\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nFantasia\n\nIn Which We Serve\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls\n\nSaboteur\n\nBrute Force\n\nAnalysis: Still not a lot of Sound Editing going on which is why it still wasn’t an Oscar category.\n\nBest Makeup\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nLa belle et la bête\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nOliver Twist\n\nThe Wolf Man\n\nAnalysis: We’re still several decades away from this as an Oscar category but there were definitely still some films worth noticing.\n\nBest Technical Aspects\n\nCitizen Kane (61)\n\nChildren of Paradise (60)\n\nLa belle et la bête (53)\n\nHenry V (45)\n\nOliver Twist (45)\n\nAnalysis: Simply a tallying of all the points I award in the Tech categories with a maximum of 81. Nothing is close to Wizard of Oz but all are above the #5 from the 30s.\n\nBest Original Song:\n\n“When You Wish Upon a Star” (Pinocchio)\n\n“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” (Meet Me in St. Louis)\n\n“Zip a Dee Doo Dah” (Song of the South)\n\n“How About You” (Babes on Broadway)\n\n“April Shower” (Bambi)\n\nAnalysis: Only three times did the Oscars get it right but they rarely botched the winner (all make the Top 5 at the Nighthawk Awards) and they average 2.4. The overall Oscar Score is 80.2, the best for any category in the decade but that’s because the Song rules allowed for a lot of nominees and meant that nearly all the worthwhile eligible films ended up being nominated.\n\nBest Original Song Total:\n\nPinocchio (15)\n\nSaludos Amigos (13)\n\nBambi (11)\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis (11)\n\nRoad to Morocco (10)\n\nAnalysis: This adds up the points of all the original songs for the film. The maximum possible is 45. Nothing big in this decade unlike Wizard in the 30s.\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nFantasia\n\nBambi\n\nPinocchio\n\nDumbo\n\nSong of the South\n\nAnalysis: There weren’t very many feature-length animated films in the decade and only three of them were great but they are three of the very best of all-time so that helps make up for it. Yes, I’ve seen Song of the South (it wasn’t always unavailable) and yes, in spite of the racial issues, it’s quite good.\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nLa belle et la bête\n\nThe Bicycle Thieves\n\nStray Dog\n\nIvan the Terrible Part I\n\nAnalysis: The rare categories in which the critics had the award before the Oscars. The critics aligned in 1940 (Baker’s Wife) and 1946 (Open City). They did again in 1948 (Paisan) but the Oscars gave their initial award to Monsieur Vincent. In 1949 all three groups as well as the Globes would go for Bicycle Thieves (actually the NBR would give it Best Picture). The 4 wins for Bicycle Thieves would stay the record until tied in 1968 and its 152 points would last until 1969. The almost 90% for the Consensus (the only other points were the Globe nomination for Fallen Idol) are a record that can’t even be approached.\n\nBest Films With No Top 5 Finishes:\n\nDouble Indemnity\n\nnote: For a film to rate at a 97 (and be just outside the Top 10 for the decade) to not earn a single nomination is pretty amazing. There were multiple films to earn a 96 but this was the only 97.\n\nWorst Film with a Top 5 Finish:\n\nBabes on Broadway\n\nnote: Only six films below ***.5 ended up with Top 5 finishes for the decade and this was the only low *** among them.\n\nNighthawk Awards, 1940-1949 – By Genre\n\nDrama\n\nBest Picture\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nCasablanca\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nThe Third Man\n\nBest Director\n\nOrson Welles (Citizen Kane)\n\nMarcel Carne (Children of Paradise)\n\nJohn Huston (The Maltese Falcon)\n\nCarol Reed (The Third Man)\n\nJohn Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre)\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nCasablanca\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nThe Third Man\n\nStairway to Heaven\n\nStray Dog\n\nBest Actor:\n\nHumphrey Bogart (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre)\n\nOrson Welles (Citizen Kane)\n\nHenry Fonda (The Grapes of Wrath)\n\nJames Stewart (It’s a Wonderful Life)\n\nRay Milland (The Lost Weekend)\n\nAnalysis: It’s not by design that all five performances are different actors. It leaves out two 9 star performances, both by Bogart (Maltese Falcon, Casablanca). Bogie dominates the Nighthawks with two wins and six total nominations.\n\nBest Actress\n\nIngrid Bergman (Gaslight)\n\nOlivia de Havilland (The Heiress)\n\nOlivia de Havilland (The Snake Pit)\n\nJoan Fontaine (Rebecca)\n\nCelia Johnson (Brief Encounter)\n\nAnalysis: Bergman has the most Drama points in the decade with 285, winning in 1943 and 1944, earning an additional nom in 1943 and earning noms in 1945, 1946 and 1948. In spite of not landing in the Top 5, Bette Davis is next with a win in 1941 and a nom for the first six years of the decade (continuing a streak back to 1938).\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nClaude Rains (Casablanca)\n\nWalter Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre)\n\nOrson Welles (The Third Man)\n\nSidney Greenstreet (The Maltese Falcon)\n\nClaude Rains (Notorious)\n\nAnalysis: Robert Ryan (Crossfire) is a close 6th place finisher here. Rains crushes all here with two wins and three other noms for a whopping 210 points.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nJudith Anderson (Rebecca)\n\nMaria Casares (Children of Paradise)\n\nGloria Grahame (Crossfire)\n\nTeresa Wright (The Little Foxes)\n\nKatina Paxinou (For Whom the Bell Tolls)\n\nBest Ensemble\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives (34)\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (32)\n\nThe Little Foxes (32)\n\nRebecca (30)\n\nChildren of Paradise / Casablanca / For Whom the Bell Tolls / It’s a Wonderful Life (28)\n\nComedy / Musical\n\nBest Picture\n\nSullivan’s Travels\n\nFantasia\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nThe Great Dictator\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy\n\nAnalysis: As with the rest of these awards, dominated by the early years of the decade.\n\nBest Director\n\nPreston Sturges (Sullivan’s Travels)\n\nGeorge Cukor (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nCharlie Chaplin (The Great Dictator)\n\nMichael Curtiz (Yankee Doodle Dandy)\n\nHoward Hawks (His Girl Friday)\n\nAnalysis: In a fascinating coincidence, the #3-5 directors were also the #3-5 directors in this category in the 1930s.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nHis Girl Friday\n\nArsenic and Old Lace\n\nPinocchio\n\nKind Hearts and Coronets\n\nAnalysis: Three plays and two novels.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nSullivan’s Travels\n\nThe Great Dictator\n\nThe Lady Eve\n\nThe Miracle of Morgan’s Creek\n\nHail the Conquering Hero\n\nAnalysis: Not a coincidence that four of the five are Preston Sturges (and so is #6 – The Great McGinty).\n\nBest Actor:\n\nJames Cagney (Yankee Doodle Dandy)\n\nCharlie Chaplin (The Great Dictator)\n\nCary Grant (His Girl Friday)\n\nJames Stewart (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nJoel McCrea (Sullivan’s Travels)\n\nAnalysis: Chaplin and Grant lead in the decade with 120 points each with Chaplin winning twice and Grant winning once but earning two other noms.\n\nBest Actress\n\nKatharine Hepburn (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nRosalind Russell (His Girl Friday)\n\nBarbara Stanwyck (The Lady Eve)\n\nCarol Lombard (To Be or Not to Be)\n\nJean Arthur (The More the Merrier)\n\nAnalysis: Hepburn is appropriately on top since she has the most Comedy points in the decade with 210, winning the Comedy Award in 1940, 1942 and 1948.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nCary Grant (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nCharles Coburn (The More the Merrier)\n\nAlec Guinness (Kind Hearts and Coronets)\n\nWalter Huston (Yankee Doodle Dandy)\n\nJack Oakie (The Great Dictator)\n\nAnalysis: Though none of his performances make the Top 5, William Demarest, with a win and three other noms is the Top Comedy Supporting Actor by far at the Nighthawks.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nRuth Hussey (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nDiana Lynn (The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek)\n\nMary Astor (The Palm Beach Story)\n\nMarjorie Main (The Affairs of Martha)\n\nMary Boland (Pride and Prejudice)\n\nBest Ensemble:\n\nThe Philadelphia Story (30)\n\nHis Girl Friday (19)\n\nThe Great Dictator (18)\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy (17)\n\nThe More the Merrier (16)\n\nAnalysis: As can be seen, Philadelphia Story wins by a mile. It belongs here – it’s the only film in either Comedy or Drama to earn nominations in every category.\n\nNighthawk Notables\n\nBest Film to Watch Over and Over: The Maltese Falcon\n\nFunniest Film: His Girl Friday\n\nBest Line (dramatic): “You know how to whistle, don’t you, Steve?

In fact, it’s a given from this point through at least the 70s that I have most original songs from any Disney film.\n\nAt the Theater\n\nBy the end of 2011, I had probably seen over 1000 films in the theater at some point or another. I had certainly been to the movies well over 1000 times. The films in this decade, of course, were released decades before I was born. But some of them have been released again over the years. For this decade, going chronologically, I have seen Pinocchio, Fantasia, Bambi and Stairway to Heaven.\n\nAwards\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nnote: This includes the 13th through 22nd Oscar ceremonies. There are notes about this decade in this post. It does include links in those posts to my various posts covering these years. Many notes on this period will be included in the upcoming Film History Through 1949 post.\n\nNumber of Films That Earned Nominations: 514\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Oscars: 123\n\nNumber of

is that the National Board of Review, after only awarding Picture and Foreign Film until 1944, added Director, Actor and Actress in 1945. The NBR also added a short-lived Screenplay category in 1948.\n\nI award the NBR at 80% of the point totals while I award the NYFC at 100% to gain my weighted total for Awards Points.\n\nNumber of Films That Won Awards (NBR): 25\n\nNumber of Films That Won Awards (NYFC): 40\n\nNumber of Films That Won Awards (both): 16\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 19\n\nTotal Number of Films: 49\n\nTotal Number of Awards: 81\n\nDirector with Most Awarded Films: William Wyler (2 films, 5 awards)\n\nStudio with Most Awarded Films: 20th Century-Fox (7 films, 13 awards)\n\nBest Film with No Awards: Children of Paradise\n\nBest English Language Film with No Awards: Casablanca\n\nTrivia:\n\nGoing My Way (3 NYFC awards), Watch on the Rhine and All the King’s Men (2 NYFC awards each) are the only films to win multiple awards without winning at least one award from each group.\n\nIn the first three years of the decade, one film would win both Best Picture awards each year, none of which won the Oscar (Grapes of Wrath, Citizen Kane, In Which We Serve).\n\nFirst films to win multiple awards once the NBR added their other awards: Director: The Best Years of Our Lives; Actor: Ray Milland (The Lost Weekend); Actress: Olivia de Havilland (The Snake Pit).\n\nTop 5 Points (Total – Weighted):\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 316\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 310\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 270\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 262\n\nGentleman’s Agreement – 262\n\nTop 5 Points (Total – NYFC only):\n\nGoing My Way – 260\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 260\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 190\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 190\n\nGentleman’s Agreement / The Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 190\n\nTop 5 Points (Total – NBR only):\n\nPaisan – 190\n\nThe Bicycle Thieves – 190\n\nHenry V – 170\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 150\n\nThe Fallen Idol – 150\n\nnote: It’s rather notable that the NBR, the least respected of the critics groups, gave the most points to two Foreign films, two British film and just one Hollywood film.\n\nGolden Globes\n\nThe Golden Globes began in 1943. I cover much of the history of the organization and the categories here but I will note that for most of the decade there were just winners (no nominees) and the split between Comedy and Drama didn’t exist yet.\n\nNumber of Films That Earned Nominations: 38\n\nNumber of Films That Won Globes: 32\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 13\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 12\n\nBest Film with No Globe Nominations: Children of Paradise\n\nBest English Language Film with No Oscar Nominations: Casablanca\n\nTop 5 Points:\n\nAll the King’s Men – 345\n\nThe Song of Bernadette – 260\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 260\n\nGoing My Way – 250\n\nGentleman’s Agreement / The Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 250\n\nBAFTAs\n\nThe BAFTAs began in 1947. However, they began with only two awards (Best Film, Best British Film). In 1948, they expanded to having nominees. But by 1949 there were still just the two categories. What’s more, matching the BAFTA year to the Oscar eligible year is not easy, especially for the first few decades.\n\nNumber of Films That Earned Nominations: 27\n\nNumber of Films That Won BAFTAs: 6\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 3\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 0\n\nTop 5 Points:\n\nHamlet – 120\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 100\n\nBicycle Thieves – 100\n\nThe Fallen Idol – 90\n\nThe Third Man – 90\n\nGuilds\n\nThe first two guilds to give out awards aren’t too surprising as the Directors Guild (DGA) and the Writer’s Guild (WGA) were the two most powerful guilds in the industry and by far the most active. They both began their awards in 1948, though both were very different than today. The DGA had quarterly awards (which I count as nominees) and a full winner. The WGA had categories broken down by genre with some extra categories as well, meaning films could be nominated in multiple categories. The WGA also didn’t seem to have a limit as to how many nominees there could be.\n\nNumber of Films That Earned Nominations: 66\n\nNumber of Films That Won Awards: 8\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 16\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 3\n\nTrivia:\n\nAll the King’s Men and The Snake Pit both won two WGA awards.\n\nThe Search was the only one of the DGA nominees in the first two years not to earn a WGA nom, which is massively ironic since it would win both an Oscar and Globe for the writing.\n\nEliminating The Search that means, yes, that 65 different films earned WGA nominations in these first two years.\n\nTop 5 Points:\n\nAll the King’s Men – 260\n\nThe Snake Pit – 205\n\nA Letter to Three Wives – 170\n\nI Remember Mama – 120\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 120\n\nAwards\n\nTop 10 Awards Nominations\n\nAll the King’s Men – 17\n\nGoing My Way – 16\n\nThe Song of Bernadette – 15\n\nJohnny Belinda – 15\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 14\n\nGentleman’s Agreement – 14\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 14\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 13\n\nThe Heiress – 13\n\nSergeant York / Mrs. Miniver / Hamlet – 12\n\nTop 5 Awards Nominations (no wins)\n\nThe Little Foxes – 9\n\nCome to the Stable – 9\n\nThe Letter – 7\n\nRandom Harvest / The Talk of the Town – 7\n\nMadame Curie / Double Indemnity – 7\n\nTop 10 Awards Wins\n\nGoing My Way – 13\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 12\n\nAll the King’s Men – 12\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 11\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 11\n\nGentleman’s Agreement – 9\n\nHamlet – 8\n\nThe Song of Bernadette – 7\n\nThe Heiress – 7\n\nfour films – 6\n\nTop 10 Awards Points\n\nGoing My Way – 1020\n\nAll the King’s Men – 1007\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 952\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 923\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 913\n\nGentleman’s Agreement – 852\n\nThe Song of Bernadette – 662\n\nHamlet – 635\n\nMrs. Miniver – 605\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 590\n\nnote: Mrs. Miniver, which the most Oscar points in the decade, comes in 9th because it’s the only film in the Top 18 for the decade without any other points other than Oscar points.\n\nTop 10 Awards Points (no Nighthawk nominations)\n\nWilson – 479\n\nBattleground – 414\n\nThe Yearling – 329\n\nThe Long Voyage Home – 270\n\nCome to the Stable – 261\n\nWake Island – 255\n\nThe Human Comedy – 235\n\nKitty Foyle: The Natural History of a Woman – 225\n\nThe Talk of the Town – 225\n\nMadame Curie – 210\n\nTop 10 Awards Points Percentage\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 22.96%\n\nGoing My Way – 19.90%\n\nGentleman’s Agreement – 19.29%\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 17.85%\n\nAll the King’s Men – 14.51%\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 14.49%\n\nMrs. Miniver – 12.80%\n\nThe Song of Bernadette – 12.59%\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 11.76%\n\nHow Green Was My Valley – 11.50%\n\nTop 10 Awards Points Percentage (Nighthawk Awards included)\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives – 20.17%\n\nThe Lost Weekend – 18.04%\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre – 16.11%\n\nCitizen Kane – 15.10%\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – 14.60%\n\nGentleman’s Agreement – 14.02%\n\nGoing My Way – 13.59%\n\nCasablanca – 13.35%\n\nChildren of Paradise – 11.61%\n\nGaslight – 11.58%\n\nLists\n\nI won’t do a lot of lists because that’s the whole point of TSPDT – they put a ridiculous amount of lists in the blender and come out with the “definitive” one.
