Family

Marie Luise was a daughter of Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Prime minister of Prussia and Princess Josephine of Baden, and as such a sister of Carol I of Romania and aunt of his successor, Ferdinand of Romania.

Marriage

Marie was considered as a potential wife to the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom.[2] Though she was considered "quite lovely" by his family, her Roman Catholic religion barred her from being a suitable consort.[2]

She married on 25 April 1867 in Berlin with Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders, second son of King Leopold I of Belgium and Louise-Marie of Orléans.[1]

They had 5 children:
