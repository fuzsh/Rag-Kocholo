        "text": "There have been more than a dozen books written about Josephine Baker. She herself wrote five autobiographies, a novel and a collection of fairy tales that expressed her vision of universal brotherhood. Since she died in 1975 at the age of 69, at least seven books by other people have been published.\n\nThe interest is not surprising. It's quite a story, the tale of the washerwoman's daughter who sings and dances her way onto the New York stage and achieves legendary stardom in the music halls of Paris and then the world over. It's also the story of a heroic woman who was decorated by the French Government for her service during World War II and whose combined humanitarianism and loneliness in the postwar years led her to adopt a dozen orphaned or abandoned children from all over the world, children who came to be known as the Rainbow Tribe.\n\nThe books all tried to get at the reality behind the legends, and because I loved her, hated her and wanted desperately to understand her, I read them all. And they made me crazy. It was like that song, ''I Remember It Well.'' A biographer would write that something happened on a Monday, and I would think, I know it was on a Wednesday, why would Josephine have told him it was on Monday? And then I would realize it was just that she didn't want anybody to know what she had been doing on Tuesday.\n\nIt is hard to read a life of anyone you have known and be entirely satisfied with the account; you recognize too many half-truths, you find too little illumination. Gradually it became clear to me that if I wanted to come to terms with my memories of Josephine, I was going to have to become a biographer myself. I set out to collect everything I could about her, to track down stories, fill in the gaps in what had already been reported.\n\nWhen I began collecting material for a book about her, right after her death, I was ridiculed by my friends (''He wasn't really her son''), soon exhausted my bank account and went broke, had to sell everything I owned. But when a woman with a contract to write a Baker biography offered me $50,000 to share what I had found, I refused. I was jealous of my material, hoarding it; I was a chevalier of the Middle Ages, riding through fire to keep faith with the monstre sacre who had been my second mother. To write about Josephine I knew you had to get beyond the parody, the costumes made of bananas or feathers, to the soul.\n\nI once said on a television documentary that Josephine Baker was like the sun. We need the sun for the flowers to grow, for the birds to sing, but if you come too close, you can get burned, you can die. Everyone who ever came too close to Josephine got burned. That is why she was so fabulous on the stage: the public was protected by the orchestra pit and she would reach the people with just the right warmth - not too hot, just beautiful. I was one of those who came too close and was hurt, rejected by her, and after Josephine died I tried to fathom why.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
