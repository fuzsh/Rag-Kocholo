He was doubly related to the Royal Family of Brunant.\n\nLife[]\n\nJoseph was born in Brussel to Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders, and Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. He was the nephew of Caroline of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the consort of Brunanter King Ambroos I. In 1904, he was engaged to King Pieter's eldest daughter, Princess Caroline. As she became pregnant, they were quickly married on June 22, 1905. Their son, Pieter Joseph, was born on August 17, 1905, but sadly Caroline died while giving childbirth. Joseph gave his son the Van Draak surname, and not Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, in memory of his late wife. He suffered periods of depression, and felt unable to look at his son. He met Princess Lucy of Lovia in Belgium, who helped him overcome his troubles, and allowed him to become close with his son. After a prolonged courtship, they were married in Koningstad in a religious ceremony, and in Lovia in a civil one. Pieter Joseph came to Lovia with the couple, and was adopted by Princess Lucy. In 1917, they had a son, the future King Lucas I. Their second son was King Arthur III, born in 1919, and Prince Thomas, their third, was born in 1938. He is the paternal grandfather of former Monarch Prince Dimitri, as well asPhilip and George Bradly-Lashawn. Joseph is also the great-grandfather of Princess Amalia, who is fifth in line to the throne of Brunant.\n\nChildren[]\n\n1905 - Pieter Joseph Van Draak Noble, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Brunant and honorary Prince of Lovia\n\n1917 - Lucas Noble, Prince Lucas of Lovia, King Lucas I of Lovia (1953-1956)\n\n1919 - Arthur Noble III, Prince Arthur III of Lovia, King Arthur III of Lovia (1957)\n\n1938 - Thomas Noble, Prince Thomas of Lovia\n\nAncestry[]\n\nKing Joseph's ancestors in three generations' King Joseph,\n\nHRH King of Lovia Father:\n\nPrince Philippe\n\nCount of Flanders Paternal Grandfather:\n\nKing Leopold I\n\nKing of the Belgians Paternal Great-grandfather:\n\nDuke Francis\n\nDuke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld Paternal Great-grandmother:\n\nPrincess Augusta\n\nCountess of Reuss-Ebersdorf Paternal Grandmother:\n\nQueen Louise-Marie\n\nPrincess of France, Queen of the Belgians Paternal Great-grandfather:\n\nKing Louis-Philippe I\n\nKing of France Paternal Great-grandmother:\n\nQueen Maria Amalia\n\nQueen of France, Princess of the Two Sicilies Mother:\n\nPrincess Marie\n\nPrincess of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Maternal Grandfather:\n\nPrince Karl III Anton\n\nPrince of Hohenzollern Maternal Great-grandfather:\n\nPrince Charles Louis\n\nPrince of Baden Maternal Great-grandmother:\n\nLandgravine Amalie\n\nLandgravine of Hesse-Darmstadt Maternal Grandmother:\n\nPrincess Josephine\n\nPrincess of Baden Maternal Great-grandfather:\n\nGrand Duke Karl\n\nGrand Duke of Baden Maternal Great-grandmother:\n\nSt√©phanie de Beauharnais\n\nPrincess de Beauharnais\n\nSee also[]\n\nQueen Lucy I"
