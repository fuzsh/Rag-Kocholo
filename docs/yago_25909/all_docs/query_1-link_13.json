It was from the start.\n\nMany arranged royal marriages became happy marriage after time, children, etc and became at least fond and respectful of each other and their duties. But there are marriages that ended horribly (e.g. Marie Jose of Belgium and Umberto II of Italy). Others started began as love matches and turned sour (Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg and Alfonso XIII of Spain). Love matches that end \"happily ever after\" exist but are rare.\n\nuriel\n\nCommoner\n\nJoined\n\nNov 6, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n38\n\nCity\n\nSydney\n\nCountry\n\nAustralia\n\nDoes anyone have photoes of JC's wedding gown on display?
