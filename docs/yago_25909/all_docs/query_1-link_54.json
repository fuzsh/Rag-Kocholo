        "text": "Koninkrijk België - Royaume de Belgique\n\nBelgium (i/ˈbɛldʒəm/ bel-jəm), officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a federal state in Western Europe. It is a founding member of the European Union and hosts the EU's headquarters, and those of several other major international organisations such as NATO. Belgium covers an area of 30,528 square kilometres (11,787 sq mi), and it has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups, the Dutch-speakers, mostly Flemish (about 60%), and the French-speakers, mostly Walloons (about 40%), plus a small group of German-speakers. Belgium's two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking enclave within the Flemish Region. A German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia. Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in the political history and a complex system of government.\n\nHistorically, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries, which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states. The region was called Belgica in Latin because of the Roman province Gallia Belgica which covered more or less the same area. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the Belgian Revolution in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands, many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium, causing it to be dubbed the battleground of Europe, a reputation strengthened by both World Wars.\n\nUpon its independence, Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution and, during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in Africa. The second half of the 20th century was marked by the rise of contrasts between the Flemish and the Francophones fuelled by language differences on the one hand and an asymmetrical economic evolution of Flanders and Wallonia on the other hand. These ongoing conflicts have caused far-reaching reforms of the formerly unitary Belgian state into a federal state and a very long political instability\n\nBelgium was recognised as an independent country in 1830, but the monarchy was not formally established until 1831. King Leopold I, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, took the constitutional oath on 21 July 1831 to become the first King of the Belgians. Under the hereditary constitutional monarchy system, the role and operation of Belgium's institutions, including the monarchy, are governed by the Constitution. \"Hereditary\" means the royal office, as described in the Constitution, is earmarked solely for a descendent of the first King of the Belgians, Leopold I. Bound by the Constitution above all other ideological and religious considerations, political opinions and debates and economic interests, the King acts as an arbiter and guardian of the country's unity and independence.\n\nResidences of the Royal House\n\nKing Albert II and Queen Paola live at Belvédère Castle, Laeken. It is situated very near Laeken Castle, which is the castle where Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde live with their children. Since 1998 Queen Fabiola lives at Stuyvenberg Castle, Laeken. Also Princess Astrid and her family live there. Prince Laurent and Princess Claire live at the Villa Clementine at Tervuren. The Royal Palace at Brussels, as well as sometimes Laken Castle, is used for official events. Both the Royal Palace at Brussels and Laeken Castle belong to the state, and are made available to the King. At present als Belvédère Castle, Stuyvenberg Castle, Villa Clémentine, Ciergnon Castle and Fenffe Castle are made available to the king. These residences belong to the Royal Trust, and via the Trust, to the state. King Albert II himself owns the residence \"Le Romarin\" at Châteauneuf de Grasse. Queen Fabiola owns the Villa Astrida at Motril. Postal address: Royal Palace, Brederodestraat 16, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.\n\nThe History of the House of Wettin\n\nThe House of Wettin is a dynasty of German counts, dukes, prince-electors (Kurfürsten) and kings that once ruled the area of today's German states of Saxony, the Saxon part of Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia for more than 800 years as well as holding at times the kingship of Poland. Agnates of the House of Wettin have, at various times, ascended the thrones of Great Britain, Portugal, Bulgaria, Poland, Saxony, and Belgium; of these, only the British and Belgian lines retain their thrones today. The oldest member of the House of Wettin who is known for certain was Thiedericus (died 982), who was probably based in the Liesgau (located at the western edge of the Harz). Around 1000, as part of the German conquest of Slavic territory, the family acquired Wettin Castle, after which they named themselves. Wettin Castle is located in Wettin in the Hosgau on the Saale River. Around 1030, the Wettin family received the Eastern March as a fief. The prominence of the Wettin family in the Slavic marches caused Emperor Henry IV to invest them with the March of Meissen as a fief in 1089. The family advanced over the course of the Middle Ages: in 1263 they inherited the landgraviate of Thuringia (though without Hesse), and in 1423 they were invested with the Duchy of Saxony, centred at Wittenberg,thus becoming one of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe family divided into two ruling branches in 1485 when the sons of Frederick II, Elector of Saxony divided the territories hitherto ruled jointly. The elder son Ernest, who had succeeded his father as Prince-elector, received the territories assigned to the Elector (Electoral Saxony) and Thuringia, while his younger brother Albert obtained the March of Meissen, which he ruled from Dresden. As Albert ruled under the title of \"Duke of Saxony\", his possessions were also known as Ducal Saxony. The older, Ernestine branch remained predominant until 1547 and played an important role in the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. Their predominance ended in the Schmalkaldic War, which pitted the Protestant Schmalkaldic League against Emperor Charles V. Although itself Protestant, the Albertine branch rallied to the Empire's cause; Charles V rewarded them by forcing the Ernestines to sign away their rights to the Electoral title and lands to the Albertines.\n\nThe Ernestine line was thereafter restricted to Thuringia, and its dynastic unity swiftly crumbled. The Albertine Wettin maintained most of the territorial integrity of Saxony, preserving it as a significant power in the region, and using small appanage fiefs for their cadet branches, few of which survived for significant lengths of time. The Ernestine Wettin, on the other hand, repeatedly subdivided their territory, creating an intricate patchwork of small duchies and counties in Thuringia. The junior Albertine branch ruled as Electors (1547-1806) and Kings of Saxony (1806-1918) and also played a role in Polish history: two Wettin were Kings of Poland (between 1697-1763) and a third ruled the Duchy of Warsaw (1807-1814) as a satellite of Napoleon. After the Napoleonic Wars, the Albertine branch lost about 40% of its lands, including the old Electoral Saxony, to Prussia, restricting it to a territory coextensive with the modern Saxony.\n\nSuccession to the Throne of Belgium\n\nUntil 1991 the Constitution said: the constitutional power of the King is hereditary in direct, natural and legal line from HRH Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, from male to male descendant, in order of birth, and with the eternal exclusion of women and their descendance. However on March 8th, 1992, the Salian Law was replaced by the absolute rule about the right of the first born, with the result that now the princesses have the same rights of succession as their brothers. The King can't be head of state of another country at the same time, unless a 2/3 majority of both parliaments agree with it. When there is no descendance anymore the King has the right to appoint his successor. The Chambers have to agree with that choice with 2/3 majority. A Prince looses his right of succession when he marries without asking permission. The King is able to give this Prince his rights back.\n\nThe Family Titles and Styles\n\nThe Sovereign is His Majesty, King of the Belgians, the other members of the royal family are styled His or Her Royal Highness and Prince or Princess of Belgium, the children of Princess Astrid are styled His or Her Imperial and Royal Highness and are Archdukes or Archduchesses of Austria-Este, Prince or Princess of Belgium. Until World War I the family members also bore the German titles Prince or Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke or Duchess of Saxony.\n\nThe Genealogy of the Royal House\n\nLeopold Georg Christian Friedrich Pr of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Duke of Saxony, was b.Coburg 16 Dec 1790. On 2 May 1816 he married Pss Charlotte Of Great Britain, Ireland and Hannover (Carlton House 7 Jan 1796-Claremont House 6 Nov 1817), the only child of the then Prince of Wales [later, King George IV]. Had she lived, Leopold would have assumed the role later taken by his nephew, Prince Albert, as Prince Consort of Great Britain. It was not to be.
