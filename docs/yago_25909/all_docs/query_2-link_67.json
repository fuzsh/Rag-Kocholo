        "text": "Josephine Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Josephine is a girl's name of French origin meaning \"Jehovah increases\".\n\nJosephine, with its large measure of class and character and a gently offbeat quality, has been on a gentle uphill climb in the US for over 30 years, now ranking in the Top 100. With an intriguing number of vivacious nicknames, from Jo to Josie to Fifi to Posy, Josephine is a Nameberry favorite.\n\nJosephine is the feminine form of Joseph, a name ultimately derived from the Hebrew Yosef, meaning \"Jehovah increases.\" In French it has an accent over the first E, which was omitted in the English, German, and Dutch translations of the name. Empress Joséphine du Beauharnais was born Marie-Josephe-Rose, but called Josephine by her husband, Napolean Bonaparte.\n\nJosephine Baker (born Freda), the American-French singer, dancer, and civil rights activist, is a potential namesake.\n\nSome of the Josephines in literature and recent pop culture are known by their nicknames—the admirably headstrong Jo in Little Women, Joey Potter (played by Katie Holmes) in Dawson's Creek, and Josie of Josie and the Pussycats. In Some Like it Hot, Josephine was the nom de femme of Tony Curtis."
