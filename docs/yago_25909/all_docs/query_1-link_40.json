        "text": "50. Princess Eugenie - $4.8 Million\n\nUnlike many of the royals on this list, Princess Eugenie isn’t a “working royal.” This means that she isn’t supported by the Sovereign Grant – a tax-payer-funded pool of money that covers the royals’ salaries. Instead, she’s using the money that was put aside for her by Queen Elizabeth II’s mother, aka the Queen Mother.\n\nAccording to Town & Country, Princess Eugenie is worth an estimated $4 million. Part of that is due to her job as a full-time associate director at the London art Gallery, Hauser & Wirth. There, she earns a yearly salary of $145,000. Who knows how this will change in the future, being the daughter of Prince Andrew.\n\nCarfax2, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n49. Princess Beatrice - $5 Million\n\nPrincess Beatrice is Prince Andrew’s oldest daughter, and she’s taken the spotlight lately. After Queen Elizabeth II passed, she’s taken a more senior role as the Counsellor of the State. That likely comes with a large pay raise, but where it stands, she’s still worth $5 million. Don’t get us wrong, that’s nothing to sneeze at.\n\nPrior to this role, she worked in finance and consulting. The spent her days working as vice president of a software company called Afiniti. Will she remain in this role? Unlikely. She’ll join other members of her family in this role, one being Camilla and another possibly being her father Prince Andrew.\n\nWeb Summit, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n48. Prince Andrew of England - $5 million\n\nWhen it comes to the royal succession, Prince Andrew is pretty far down the list. Barring some catastrophic event that wipes out most of Britain’s royal family, he’ll never make it to the throne. However, his days as a royal have granted him a seat at the millionaire’s table.\n\nWhile a $5 million net worth is on the lower end of this list, most people would be over the moon to have that kind of money. However, Andrew and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, have had some financial troubles recently—including a lawsuit after failing to make payments on a Swiss lodge they purchased.\n\nTitanic Belfast, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n47. Kate Middleton - $7 Million\n\nAccording to Money, Kate Middleton sits on a fortune of her own. The Duchess of Cambridge has an estimated wealth of $7 million to $10 million! All that was pretty much earned before she married into the royal family in 2011, although she’s likely quickly increasing her net worth daily.\n\nThe Duchess and Princess’s wealth comes from her parents’ company, Party Pieces. The company alone is worth $50 million. The good part about her being a royal is that the royal family pays for all their living expenses. Who knows how much money she’ll be worth a decade from now!\n\nThe Big Lunch, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n46. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - $10 Million\n\nObviously, Prince Harry carries much of the net worth in their relationship, but Meghan Markle has some money on her own! According to Forbes, Prince Harry and Meghan together are worth $10 million, but it could be more. Harry alone has earned podcasting deals that could be worth between $15 and $18 million.\n\nThen there’s Meghan Markle. She had to step away from television after marrying the prince, but she still gets royalties from it. On her own, she’s worth $2.2 million, based on the salary she earned while starring as Rachel Zane in the TV show Suits. Before the split from the royal family, the pair were actually worth much more.\n\nMark Jones, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n45. Prince Edward of England - $10 million\n\nLike most of Britain’s royal family, Prince Edward has done handsomely for himself in the money department. While not as high earning as some of his relatives, his $10 million net worth still managed to get him onto this list. However, unlike a few of his family members, he actually worked for some of his money.\n\nBefore he took on full-time duties as a member of the royal family, Edward worked in both theater and television, even managing to open his own production company that produced several TV shows and documentaries. Since then, he has started spending more time in the world of charity work.\n\nFrankie Fouganthin, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n44. King Felipe VI of Spain - $10 million\n\nKing Felipe IV of Spain actually cut his own salary several years back, but that hasn’t stopped him from becoming one of the wealthiest royals in the world. A twenty percent cut in pay might seem like a lot, but it’s not really when you’re already lavishly rich.\n\nCurrently, it’s estimated that Felipe has a net worth of at least $10 million. Much of this probably comes from the multiple palaces and homes that the royal family of Spain owns. And, despite the fact that he took a pay cut, it still takes almost $10 million a year for the country to support the king.\n\nOlaf Kosinsky, CC BY-SA 3.0 DE, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n43. Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco - $30 million\n\nTechnically, Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco is no royal at all. Her mother, Princess Caroline, decided not to give her children royal titles when they were born. However, while she might not have the official distinction when your grandparents are the late Prince Ranier III and Grace Kelly, you’re still a royal.\n\nEven without an official title, Casiraghi has still managed to accumulate millions for herself, with her current net worth estimated to be at $30 million. During her long and varied career, she’s done everything from modeling for Gucci to founding a philosophical think tank. She’s definitely led a more interesting life than most royals!\n\nJuan Jose Alvarez Gomez, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n42. Prince William of England - $30 Million\n\nHis days as the King of England are still a bit in the future, but even if he doesn’t yet have the crown for himself, Prince William has done just fine in the finance department. It’s estimated that his net worth is somewhere in the range of $30 million.\n\nA good portion of William’s wealth came from the estate of his late mother, Princess Diana. It was reported that he inherited more than $15 million from her when he turned 30. However, he did make some of his millions on his own…albeit not much. When he was in the military, his salary was $62,000.\n\nRoyal Navy, OGL 3, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n41. King Harald V - $30 Million\n\nKing Harald V of Norway is said to have a net worth of $30 million. Born in 1937, King Harald is a member of House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg. His wife is Sonja Haraldsen and he follows the Church of Norway, an evangelical Lutheran church. He has been king since 1991.\n\nAs King of Norway, he is the head of the Norwegian Armed Forces, and has two heirs: Crown Prince Haakon and Princess Martha Louise. Harald V is also educated, having studied at the University of Oslo and Balliol College in Oxford. Well-versed in history, economics and politics, he’s proven himself well-suited for his position. And on top of all that, he’s an athlete who competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n40. Queen Rania of Jordan - $35 Million\n\nRania Al-Abdullah began dating the then-prince Abdullah II of Jordan in 1993. He became king of Jordan in February of 1999, and, a month later, he declared Rania the queen of the country. It’s estimated that she has a net worth of at least $35 million.\n\nBefore she began her whirlwind life as a royal, Rania briefly had a career where she worked for both Citibank and Apple. As queen of Jordan, she has moved into a more humanitarian role where she works with charitable organizations dedicated to youth education and health both home and abroad.\n\nFrédéric de Villamil from Paris, France, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n39. Queen Margrethe II - $40 Million\n\nQueen Margrethe II of Denmark has a net worth of $40 million. She is the daughter of King Frederik IX and Ingrid of Sweden. Born in 1940, she took up the throne in 1972 and has remained in the position ever since. Having started her political career at an early age, she was just eighteen years old when she was put on the Council of State.\n\nCurrently, she is married to Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark. Her two heirs are Crown Prince Frederik Andre Henrik and Prince Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian of Denmark. And on top of that, she has a total of eight grandchildren split between the two of them.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n38. Akihito - $40 Million\n\nAkihito is the ruling Emperor of Japan with a net worth of $40 million. Born in the Tokyo Imperial Palace in 1933, he was literally born for this and has known no other life. He served as Emperor from 1989 until 2019. He was the eldest son of Emperor Showa and Empress Kojun. His brothers had been evacuated from the firebombing raids of 1945.\n\nAfter stepping down in 2019, he was succeeded by Emperor Naruhito, the eldest son of three children. It’s also worth noting that Akihito is an ichthyological researcher and has written papers for several scholarly journals. The man still lives today, having survived prostate cancer, pneumonia and heart bypass surgery.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n37. Count Alexandre de Lesseps of France - $50 Million\n\nAlexandre de Lesseps may be a count in France, but he’s probably much more well-known as a businessman and the former husband of one of the most obnoxious Real Housewives in the franchise, “Countess” LuAnn. Unlike some royals, de Lesseps earned most of his money, with an estimated net worth of $50 million.\n\nDe Lesseps descends from Ferdinand de Lesseps, who was a 19th-century French diplomat and one of the developers of the Suez Canal. The current de Lesseps focused his time on finance and is one of the earliest promoters of using microfinancing to fund small businesses worldwide.\n\nNdelesseps, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n36. Yasmin Aga Khan - $50 Million\n\nPrincess Yasmin Aga Khan of Switzerland is worth $50 million. The Swiss-born royal has made a career as an American philanthropist, having raised awareness for Alzheimer's disease, which her mother had suffered from. She is the second child of actress Rita Hayworth and the third child of Prince Aly Khan.\n\nThe Princess has married twice, first to Basil Embiricos, and later to Christopher Michael Jeffries. She currently serves on the Board of Directors as Vice Chairman of the Alzheimer's and Related Disorders Association. Additionally, she is the president of the Alzheimer's Disease International. She graduated from Bennington College and has an interest in Opera singing.\n\nJared Siskin/Patrick McMullan/Getty Images\n\n35. Pierre Casiraghi - $50 Million\n\nPierre Casiraghi is the son of Princess Caroline of Hanover and has a net worth of $50 million. His father is Stefano Casiraghi and he has become quite a successful businessman himself. Much of his net worth, however, comes from holdings in his father’s construction company based in Milan and through his royal position.\n\nCasiraghi has an older sister, Charlotte Marie Pomeline Casiraghi, and an older brother, Andrea Albert Pierre Casiraghi. While he attended University for the sake of his education, much of the reputation he gained from college came from the women he was dating. Pierre is the maternal grandson of actress Grace Kelly.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n34. Lorenzo Borghese - $50 Million\n\nLorenzo Borghese, born in Milan Italy has a net worth of $50 million. He grew up in Rome, Paris and Connecticut. As the son of an Italian Prince and an American woman, he is a member of the House of Borghese and is known as Prince Lorenzo Borghese. An expert in business, he earned his MBA from Fordham University.\n\nOne of his business ventures was the Royal Treatment Italian Pet Spa, which was a line of pet care products made with ingredients from Italy, available through the Home Shopping Network. But what this Prince is perhaps best known for is his appearance on “The Bachelor” in 2006. Additionally, as of 2010, he’s a published romance author based on his relative, Princess Pauline Bonaparte Borghese.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n33. Asma al-Assad - $50 Million\n\nAsma al-Assad is the First Lady of Syria with a net worth of $50. Born in London in 1975, she would earn her degree at King’s College and work as an investment banker. She is married to the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad. At the time of their marriage, she was just about to study at Harvard.\n\nInstead, she moved to Syria and had three children. Having assumed office in 2000, she’s been working hard for over 20 years, staying active in social and economic development programs. However, she has not been seen publicly since 2012 when the Syrian Military Intelligence Directorate was bombed.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n32. Prince Frederic von Anhalt - $70 Million\n\nPrince Frederic von Anhalt of Germany has a net worth of $70 million. Born in Bad Kreuznach, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany in 1943, he became famous for marrying Zsa Zsa Gabor, to whom he has been married since 1986. Interestingly, he wasn’t always a prince, which you may not be aware of.\n\nPrince Frederic von Anhalt started out a normal life in a regular family of five. However, he ended up getting adopted as an adult by Princess Marie-Auguste of Anhalt for the sake of giving him a title: Duke of Saxony. And apparently carrying on the tradition of adopting adults, the Prince and Zsa Zsa Gabor have adopted several grown men.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n31. King Carl XVI Gustaf - $70 Million\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden has a net worth of $70 million. Born in Haga Palace in 1946, he is a member of House of Bernadette.

He’s also educated, having attended Uppsala University and Stockholm University. He can be regularly seen presenting the Nobel Prizes each year.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n30. Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont of England - $72 million\n\nWe’re not sure about all the intricacies of British royalty, but if long and confusing titles are any indicator, Max Wyndham is kind of a big deal. He is a direct descendant of Sir John Wyndham, a 17th century English nobleman who helped stave off a Spanish invasion of the country.\n\nHe may have a fancy title, but Max Wyndham has managed to make an impressive name all for himself as an award-winning author of multiple fiction and nonfiction books, including one about an ancestor of his. Currently, his net worth is estimated to be in the area of $72 million.\n\nColin McPherson/Corbis Entertainment/Getty Images\n\n29. Princess Caroline - $100 Million\n\nPrincess Caroline of Monaco is worth $100 million. She is the daughter of the Prince of Monaco, Rainier III and the famous actress Grace Kelly.

Earl of Sandwich John Montagu - $100 Million\n\nBeing the Earl of such a delicious place can’t be easy, but John Montagu makes it look easy. Montagu is worth a modest $100 million (according to Celebrity Net Worth), but his family is worth a lot more. Hilariously enough, Montagu actually made some of his fortune licensing his name for use in the chain shop Earl of Sandwich.\n\nMontagu is best known for his initiatives related to international development and asylum. His kids are sure to fall right in line for the fortune as they are already appearing on Bravo reality TV shows like Ladies of London, which follows successful women and their families.\n\nRoger Harris, CC BY 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n27.

Former Queen Farah Pahlavi of Iran - $100 million\n\nFarah Pahlavi is no longer the queen of Iran, thanks to a little thing called the Iranian Revolution, but that doesn’t seem to have hurt her wealth or international popularity one bit.

She reigned as the Queen of the country from 1980 until 2013 when she abdicated the throne. In turn, her son took up her place, but he isn’t worth nearly as much as his mother.\n\nBeatrix has a net worth of $300 million, according to Forbes. Her reign was anything but eventless. The talk began when she married a member of the H. Youth, and it became a huge controversy across the nation and abroad.

Caroline Luel-Brockdorff - $400 Million\n\nCaroline ‘Fleming’ Luel-Brockdorff is pretty young to have such a massive net worth of $400 million, according to Insider.

Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is the King of Saudi Arabia and is worth a jaw-dropping $17 billion, according to CNBC. That being said, much of his duties have been passed to his son and heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. That doesn’t mean he isn’t raking in the money.\n\nThe King made most of his money from the vast oil reserves that were founded more than 75 years ago. In fact, that’s what made the whole family so filthy rich. One of King Salman’s duties includes settling royal conflicts among the extended Al Saud family, which has an estimated 4,000 princes.\n\nU.S. Department of State from United States, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n7. House of Maktoum - $18 Billion\n\nHouse of Maktoum of Dubai is a royal family worth $18 billion. The House of Maktoum dates all the way back to 1833. The royal dynasty is composed of 12 primary members along with hundreds of extended family members. This all amounts to the $18 billion figure but the richest family member by far would have to be Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is the sheikh of Dubai who has ruled since 2006. He is the UAE's vice president and prime minister and he also controls investment vehicle Dubai Holdings. He is said to have six wives and was rumored to have spent an estimated $100 million on one of the weddings.\n\n6. Sultan of Brunei - $30 Billion\n\nHouse of Bolkiah of Brunei is worth $28 billion. Formed back in 1363, it has ruled Brunei on and off since that time. The family is currently headed by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah who has been ruling for 54 years. Much of their wealth has come from their country’s vast oil reserves.\n\nThe Sultan lives in the Istana Nurul Iman palace. This building holds the Guinness World Record as the largest residential palace in existence, with an area totaling 2.2 million square feet. The family is also said to own several thousand supercars and several private jets. But these are just some of the ways this family flaunts their wealth.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n5. Chakri dynasty - $60 Billion\n\n4. Queen Elizabeth II - $88 Billion\n\nThe British royal family is probably the one you know the most about but just how much money do they have? The British royal family’s net worth is said to be around $88 billion. So yeah, they can definitely afford to pay for all those royal weddings. This figure was taken in 2017 by Forbes, so it could be even higher now.\n\nHowever, because the royal family is composed of many members, that wealth is split quite a bit among them all. It should come as no surprise that Queen Elizabeth II has the most at around $600 million, according to Sunday Times Rich List 2020. Those profits come from real estate as well as the Crown Estate.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n3. Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan - $18 Billion\n\nAbu Dhabi’s royal Family, House of Nahyan is estimated to be worth $150 billion.

House of Thani - $335 Billion\n\nHouse of Thani in Qatar is worth $335 billion. They have been in power since the mid-19th century. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani is the youngest ruler in the world at the age of just 40 years old. This family’s wealth comes from several thousand members, however, so he’s not necessarily one of the richest men in the world.\n\nOne controversy surrounding the family claimed that they paid $1 billion in ransom money to al-Qaeda for the release of 28 family members. They denied this, however, and said that the money was paid to the Iraqi state. Either way, it proved just a small dent in the family’s amassed wealth.\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)\n\n1. Al Sabah - $360 Billion\n\nAl Sabah is the head of Kuwait’s royal family, worth an estimated $360 billion. This dynasty has ruled since 1752 and Sheikh Sabah IV Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah is the current emir. The family is said to be made up of 1,000 members. Much of their wealth is said to be tied up in stocks and shares.\n\nIn 1991 a Time article put the family’s wealth at around $90 billion and with it now as $360 billion that means the family’s wealth has quadrupled in just 30 years. A lot of that wealth is said to have come from US stocks, and in particular, major blue-chip companies (e.g. IBM, JP Morgan Chase, Walmart).\n\n(Image via Wikipedia)"
