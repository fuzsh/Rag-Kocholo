        "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has long been a huge fan of dogs. When she relocated to the UK in 2017 after her engagement to Prince Harry , she took her beagle named Guy with her. Sadly, her other rescue dog Bogart was considered too old to make the transatlantic journey.\n\nThe Duchess has since adopted another dog with Harry, a black Labrador who has been seen running around their back yard in Los Angeles.\n\nLupo the spaniel became part of Prince William and Kate’s family back in 2012, when William was posted to the Falkland Islands for six weeks and they decided that Kate would appreciate the company of a four-legged friend. He has become an integral part of the family, appearing with the family on many occasion and in Prince George’s first official portrait.\n\nThe Royal House of Sweden annouced in May 2020 that Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel had brought an adorable dog called Rio into their family. He is a cavoodle which is a crossbreed bred from a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and a Poodle. An ideal playmate for Princess Estelle and Prince Oscar !\n\nRELATED: Swedish royals welcome new adorable member to family\n\nSophie and her husband Prince Edward have two dogs (a black Labrador and a cocker spaniel) and a tortoise to keep their kids Louise and James entertained!\n\nIn June 2020 Edward opened up about the family’s pets while on a video call with his patronage The Orpheus Centre: “We have two dogs and we’ve also got a tortoise, who basically rules the house!”\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s close friend, Margrethe of Denmark is a huge fan of Dachshunds and has had several throughout her life. She marked her 80th birthday this year by posing with one of them in the grounds of Fredensborg Castle.\n\nSeen here with her daughter Charlotte Casiraghi , Princess Caroline grew up surrounded by dogs. Her mom, Princess Grace, was a huge animal lover too and the family home usually had at least one pooch in residence. Here she is pictured with her bulldog Romeo.\n\nZara Tindall, as well as owning dogs, is also an avid horse-lover, like her grandmother Queen Elizabeth. She road her precious horse Toytown in the 2012 London Olympics and when he passed away in 2017, she issued a public statement, saying: “I’m heartbroken to say that yesterday morning I had to say goodbye to my greatest friend and horse of a lifetime, Toytown...he was a huge part of my family, an amazing animal and a true champion. I will miss you for ever.”"
