After Napoleon's defeat, Leopold moved to the United Kingdom where he married Princess Charlotte of Wales, who was second in line to the British throne and the only legitimate child of the Prince Regent (the future King George IV). Charlotte died after only a year of marriage, but Leopold continued to enjoy considerable status in Britain.\n\nAfter the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830), Leopold was offered the throne of Greece under the 1830 London Protocol that created an independent Greek state, but turned it down, believing it to be too precarious. Instead, he accepted the throne of Belgium in 1831 following the country's independence in 1830. The Belgian government offered the position to Leopold because of his diplomatic connections with royal houses across Europe, and because as the British-backed candidate, he was not affiliated with other powers, such as France, which were believed to have territorial ambitions in Belgium which might threaten the European balance of power created by the 1815 Congress of Vienna.\n\nLeopold took his oath as King of the Belgians on 21 July 1831, an event commemorated annually as Belgian National Day. His reign was marked by attempts by the Dutch to recapture Belgium and, later, by internal political division between liberals and Catholics. As a Protestant, Leopold was considered liberal and encouraged economic modernisation, playing an important role in encouraging the creation of Belgium's first railway in 1835 and subsequent industrialisation. As a result of the ambiguities in the Belgian Constitution, Leopold was able to slightly expand the monarch's powers during his reign. He also played an important role in stopping the spread of the Revolutions of 1848 into Belgium. He died in 1865 and was succeeded by his son, Leopold II.\n\nMarriage to Charlotte[]\n\nLeopold received British citizenship in March 1816.\n\nOn 2 May 1816, Leopold married Princess Charlotte of Wales at Carlton House in London. Charlotte was the only legitimate child of the Regent George (later George IV) and therefore second in line to the British throne. The Prince Regent had hoped Charlotte would marry William, Prince of Orange, but she favoured Leopold. Although the Regent was displeased, he found Leopold to be charming and possessing every quality to make his daughter happy, and so approved their marriage. The same year Leopold received an honorary commission to the rank of Field Marshal and Knight of the Order of the Garter. The Regent also considered making Leopold a royal duke, the Duke of Kendal, though the plan was abandoned due to government fears that it would draw Leopold into party politics and would be viewed as a demotion for Charlotte.The couple lived initially at Camelford House on Park Lane, and then at Marlborough House on Pall Mall.\n\nOn 5 November 1817, after having suffered a miscarriage, Princess Charlotte gave birth to a stillborn son. She herself died the next day following complications. Leopold was said to have been heartbroken by her death.\n\nHad Charlotte survived, she would have become queen of the United Kingdom on the death of her father and Leopold presumably would have assumed the role of prince consort, later taken by his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Despite Charlotte's death, the Prince Regent granted Prince Leopold the British style of Royal Highness by Order in Council on 6 April 1818.\n\nAffairs with sister-in-law Louise[]\n\nWhen Leopold visited Coburg in 1818, while his brother Ernest was away, he comforted his sister-in-law, Louise, who has been neglected by his brother since marriage. Louise fell in love with Leopold, while Leopold seen Louise as Charlotte’s substitute.\n\nThey soon developed an ambiguous relationship and after both of them accidentally drank Ernest’s wine containing aphrodisiac for his mistress, Leopold, who has been abstinence since Charlottes death, eventually kissed Louise who had dressed as Charlotte and had a passionate sex with her. Louise became Leopold’s woman.\n\nLouise was conceived after that night. On August 1819, she gave birth to a son name Albert, the future Prince Consort. Leopold felt regretful as he betrayed Charlotte mentally and physically, he left Coburg and returned to UK.\n\nWhen Leopold is back to Coburg a year later, on a rainy night, we went shelter with Louise on Ernest’s mansion and they were all soaked. Leopold cannot suppress his feeling for Louise anymore when helping her close the window, they kissed passionately and had sex that night again, they continued to have sex in the coming months, Louise was conceived that night and gave birth to another boy nine months later, she named her second son as Carl, who would married Queen Victoria’s sister, Princess Caroline and eventually developed sexual affairs with Queen Victoria."
