A detailed report on the death of Princess Charlotte.\n\nA further tragedy was to occur about four months after the death of Princess Charlotte. Sir Richard Croft an accoucheur (male midwife and obstetrician) who had attended Princess Charlotte during the birth of her stillborn son committed suicide by gun shot to his head. He carried out this sad occurrence whilst attending to another patient who was in the final stage of giving birth. The death of Princess Charlotte had played heavily on his mind.\n\nThe Belgian crown was originally offered to Prince Louise of Orleans (Duke of Nemours) but this was rejected by his father King Louis-Philippe I of France. Belgium, with Holland formed the Kingdom of the Netherlands as confirmed by the Congress of Vienna on 9 June 1815. A Belgian uprising in 1830 resulted in an enforced separation of the two countries but it wasn't until 19 April 1839 that King Willem I of the Netherlands accepted a settlement and the independent and neutral state of Belgium came into being.\n\n14 King Leopold I of the Belgians 1790 1865 Caroline Bauer 1807 1877 Although not mentioned in some Royal Genealogy sources Leopold married secondly and morganatically Caroline Bauer (1807-1877) in 1829 apparently by signing a contract rather than in a religious wedding, in the contract she was created Countess of Montgomery. They were divorced not long after with Caroline returning to her acting career. Caroline died in 1877 from an overdose of sleeping-pills and in 1885 a posthumous book \"Posthumous Memoirs of Caroline Bauer\" was published giving details of her life with Leopold. Caroline Bauer was a cousin to Baron Stockmar advisor to Leopold and his niece Queen Victoria of Great Britain An interesting article from the \"The New York Times\" of November 2, 1884 can be found here.\n\nGoogle have scanned the book and made it available here.\n\nA report on the death of Caroline Bauer. 14 King Leopold I of the Belgians 1790 1865 Princess Louise Marie of Orleans 1812 1850 See 13.2 & 28.8 - Leopold was previously Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and became King of the Belgians on 21 July 1831. The Belgian crown was originally offered to Prince Louis of Orleans (Duke of Nemours) but this was rejected by his father King Louis-Philippe I of France. Belgium, with Holland formed the Kingdom of the Netherlands as confirmed by the Congress of Vienna on 9 June 1815. A Belgian uprising in 1830 resulted in an enforced separation of the two countries but it wasn't until 19 April 1839 that King Willem I of the Netherlands accepted a settlement and the independent and neutral state of Belgium came into being.\n\nA somewhat unusual report of the wedding of Leopold and Louise Marie.\n\nThe New York Times announcement of the death of King Leopold. 14.1 Prince Louis-Philippe of Belgium 1833 1834 14.2 King Leopold II of the Belgians (1 st Duke of Brabant 1840-1865) 1835 1909 Archduchess Marie Henriette of Austria (Hungarian Line) 1836 1902 See 21.8 - A Royal Decree of 16 December 1840 assigned the heir apparent to the crown (i.e. Leopold) the title of Duke of Brabant.\n\nThe New York Times report of the death of King Leopold and his infidelities.\n\nThe New York Times notice of the death of Archduchess (Queen) Marie Henriette.\n\n14.2 King Leopold II of the Belgians (1 st Duke of Brabant 1840-1865) 1835 1909 Caroline Lacroix 1883 1948 See 21.8 - Leopold was gravely ill in early December 1909 and on 14 December 1909 was allegedly married to his lover Blanche Delacroix (1883-1948) (sometimes referred to as Caroline Lacroix) by a royal chaplain, Leopold died a few days later on 17 December 1909. Leopold had two sons out of wedlock with Blanche, Lucien (1906-1984) and Philippe (1907-1914), Philippe is reported to have been born handicapped resulting in his early death. Caroline is said to have been created Baroness de Vaughan in Belgium (a courtesy title) with Lucien becoming the Count of Tervuren, and Philippe the Count of Ravenstein.\n\nA report on the birth registration of Philippe where the father apparently was shown as \"father not declared\".\n\nThe New York Times report of the death of King Leopold and his infidelities.\n\nAn article from \"The Week\" relating to the marriage of Leopold and Blanche and how he tried to cut his daughters from his money.\n\nBlanche later married Antoine Durrieux and The New York Times reported in August 1910 the possibility Blanche and Antoine were already married at the time of the alleged marriage of Leopold and Blanche.\n\nThe marriage of Blanche and Antoine Durrieux was thought to be a record for a quick wedding 14.21 Princess Louise of Belgium 1858 1924 Prince Philip of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha 1844 1921 See 28.521 - Louise eloped to Nice 1898 with her husband's chamberlain Géza Mattachich (1868-1923). She was eventually captured and returned to Vienna and placed in a lunatic asylum at the instigation of her husband. Prince Philip was considered one of the most dissolute princes and his drunken and violent behaviour towards his wife led to her attachment to Géza Mattachich. Louise managed to escape in 1904 and fled to France with her lover Géza Mattachich, she obtained her divorce from her husband Philip in 1906 (one source mentions 1907) and lived the rest of life with Géza Mattachich although they never married. Géza Mattachich was the stepson of Count Oskar Keglewitch (or Keglevich) and unofficially assumed the countly title of his stepfather (i.e. assumed title Count Keglewitch).\n\nAn interesting article from The New York Times which includes the introduction to a book by Géza Mattachich.\n\nAccording to the The New York Times 31 December 1905 Prince Philip was to pay Princess Louise $211,000 a year as alimony plus $1,000,000 by instalments as part of the settlement for their divorce.\n\nA report on the civil marriage of Louise and Philip.\n\nA report following the death of Princess Louise 14.22 Prince Leopold of Belgium (2 nd Duke of Brabant 1865-1869) 1859 1869 Leopold died from pneumonia, after falling into a pond.\n\nObituary of Prince Leopold.\n\nThere is an error in the obituary in that it mentions \"The first Duke of Brabant , heir presumptive to the throne of Belgium, of the present dynasty, died at the Chateau of Laeken in May, 1834, at the age of ten months. He was the first child of the marriage of Leopold I with Queen Louise Marie, Princess of Orleans, daughter of King Louis Philippe, and was born in July, 1833.\" The prince who died in 1834 was Prince Louis-Philippe of Belgium (1833-1834)\n\nThe first Duke of Brabant was in fact Louis-Philippe's younger brother Leopold (future King Leopold II) who was Duke of Brabant 1840 (by Royal Decree dated 16 December 1840) until 1865 when he succeeded his father as King of the Belgians 14.23 Princess Stephanie of Belgium 1864 1945 Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria 1858 1889 See 19.J13 - Rudolph committed suicide after killing his eighteen year old mistress Baroness Maria Vetsera in in Mayerling.\n\nA report on the marriage of Rudolph and Stephanie. 14.23 Princess Stephanie of Belgium 1864 1945 Count Elemer Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény 1863 1946 Elemer was created Prince Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény by Emperor Karl of Austria on 9 February 1917.

This was compounded by his second marriage to a commoner Mary Liliane \"Liliane\" Baels in 1941 and the fact he decided to stay in Belgium during its occupation by German forces until he was deported to Germany in 1944. A plebiscite in 1950 invited Leopold to return but after consideration he abdicated on 16 July 1951 in favour of his son Baudouin.\n\nMary Liliane \"Liliane\" Baels initially received the title Princess de Réthy and later Princess of Belgium following her civil wedding.

The effect of which was to replace the automatic right of the eldest son of the King to the title the Duke of Brabant by the title of Duke of Brabant or Duchess of Brabant being granted to the eldest son or daughter of the King. This means that when her father Philippe became King, Elisabeth was granted the title of Duchess of Brabant in her right rather than as the spouse of a Duke of Brabant, the birth of her younger brothers would not usurp her rights as Duchess of Brabant and as future Queen of the Belgians. 14.351312 Prince Gabriel Baudouin of Belgium 2003 14.351313 Prince Emmanuel Leopold of Belgium 2005 14.351314 Princess Eléonore of Belgium 2008 14.35132 Princess Astrid of Belgium 1962 Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este 1955 See 19.J32132 - Lorenz was created Prince of Belgium by Royal Decree (number 1995021415) published on 14 November 1995 but with effect from 10 November 1995.

Following the DNA confirmation The Brussels Court of Appeal ruled that Delphine Boël, had the right to her Royal fathers surname and also a princess of Belgium. She will be called Delphine of Saxen-Coburg-Gotha, princess of Belgium.\n\nDelphine is a talented artist.\n\n14.3515 Princess Marie Christina of Belgium 1951 Paul Druker 1937 2008 Marie Christina's marriage to Paul Druker lasted 40 days.\n\nObituary on Paul Druker 14.3515 Princess Marie Christina of Belgium 1951 Jean-Paul Gourgues 1949 14.3516 Princess Marie-Esmeralda of Belgium 1956 Sir Salvador Moncada 1944 Princess Marie-Esmeralda is a journalist working under the name of Esmeralda de Rethy.\n\nSalvador Moncada is a highly respected pharmacologist and is currently Director of the Cancer Domain at The University of Manchester.\n\nIt was announced on 31 December 2009 that the Queen signified her intention of conferring the Honour of Knighthood on Salvador Moncada for services to Science.\n\nThe Queen actually conferred the Honour on 12 February 2010.\n\nMarriage Registration of Princess Marie-Esmeralda and Salvador Moncada 14.35161 Alexandra Leopoldine Moncada 1998 14.35162 Leopoldo Daniel Moncada 2001 14.352 Prince Charles of Belgium (Count of Flanders) 1903 1983 Jacqueline Peyrebrune 1921 On the liberation of Belgium, King Leopold III was not in the country, having been deported to Germany by the occupiers. As the Constitution provides for the possibility of a Regency, Prince Charles was made Regent of the Kingdom by the Combined Chambers of Parliament. On 20 September 1944, Prince Charles took the constitutional oath. He exercised the royal prerogatives until 20 July 1950.\n\nIt would appear the marriage of Charles to Jacqueline was not legal. Their union was blessed in a private religious ceremony on 14 September 1977, but under French law a religious marriage must be preceded by a civil one. 14.3521 Isabelle Wybo 1938 Isabelle Wybo is the daughter of Charles of Belgium (Count of Flanders) and Jacqueline Wehrli (who married Arthur Wybo around about 1942).
