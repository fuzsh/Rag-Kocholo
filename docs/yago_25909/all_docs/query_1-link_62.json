        "text": "People that have marred in to Royal Families since 1800\n\nLuxembourg\n\nPrincess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium 11 October 1927 – 10 January 2005 later Grand Duchess Joséphine Charlotte of Luxembourg\n\nShe was a first cousin of Harald V of Norway. She was the first child of King Leopold III of Belgium, and sister of the late King Baudouin and retired King Albert II, and aunt of King Philippe.\n\nJoséphine-Charlotte was born in 1927 at the Royal Palace of Brussels. She was the oldest child and only daughter of the King Leopold III of the Belgians and his first wife, Astrid of Sweden.\n\nWhile expecting her daughter, Astrid had read a biography of her ancestress, the French empress Joséphine de Beauharnais. Josephine was also the name of one of the child’s great-aunts, Princess Joséphine-Caroline of Belgium, the dearest sister of King Albert I. Astrid was a devoted mother to her “little Jo”. The young Princess spent her childhood at the Stuyvenberg Palace just outside Brussels with her parents.\n\nShe was the sister of Belgian monarchs Baudouin and Albert II. Joséphine-Charlotte’s popular mother was killed in an automobile accident in 1935 at age 29. Joséphine-Charlotte responded courageously to the situation, trying to take care of her younger brothers, Baudouin and Albert.\n\nLater, in 1941, her father remarried to Mary Lilian Baels (later Princess of Réthy), a union that produced three more children: Prince Alexandre, Princess Marie-Christine and Princess Marie-Esméralda. Joséphine-Charlotte became the godmother to her younger half-brother, Alexandre.\n\nPrincess Joséphine-Charlotte first attended school at the Royal Palace, where a small class had been organized for her. At the end of 1940, she entered a boarding school and then continued her education with her own private teachers.\n\nOn 7 June 1944, the day after the Allied Forces landed in Normandy, France, she and her father were sent to Germany and kept there under house-arrest. The Royal Family, which included her brothers Baudouin and Albert and their stepmother, Mary Lilian Baels, Princess of Réthy, was freed on 7 May 1945 and settled in Prégny, Switzerland.\n\nPrincess Joséphine-Charlotte continued her studies at the “Ecole Supérieure de Jeunes Filles” in Geneva, Switzerland. Afterwards, she took Jean Piaget’s lectures on child psychology at the University of Geneva. When she returned to Belgium the princess took up her official duties. At the same time, she also devoted herself to social problems and developed her interest in the arts\n\nJoséphine Charlotte was joined in marriage on 9 April 1953 in Luxembourg to Prince Jean, who at the time was The Hereditary Grand Duke and heir-apparent to the throne of Luxembourg. Although politically motivated, it was a happy match. During their 52-year marriage, the royal couple had five children\n\nAs a princess in the royal house of Belgium, Joséphine Charlotte brought a wealth of elegance, taste and refinement to her new homeland. She carried out many social, cultural and humanitarian duties. She focused on several initiatives that she would ardently support, particularly matters pertaining to children and families. She was also president of the Luxembourg Youth Section of the Red Cross.\n\nHer favorite hobbies included gardening and horticulture. She also enjoyed hunting, fishing, skiing and other watersports."
