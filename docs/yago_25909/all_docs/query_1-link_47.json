        "text": "Royal fans adore the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's family-of-five, which includes children Prince George, Prince Charlotte and Prince Louis. Indeed, many wonder if the couple will go on to have a fourth child in the near future just like the Queen did.\n\nFor now, it seems that Kate is content with her happy trio, but should the Duchess go on to have another baby, she would be in good royal company! From our monarch to Crown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Queen Rania of Jordan, several royal ladies are mums to big broods.\n\nTake a look at the regal families with four or more children…\n\nMORE: Royal children's most cherished cuddly toys: Princess Charlotte, Archie Harrison and more\n\nWATCH: Before they were royal\n\nThe Queen\n\nHer Majesty the Queen married her husband, Prince Phillip, back in 1947 at Westminster Abbey and wasted no time in starting a family, welcoming baby Prince Charles a year later in 1948. Baby number two, Princess Anne arrived in 1950.\n\nThe monarch then had a ten-year gap before giving birth to her third child Prince Andrew, and a further four years before child number four, Prince Edward, arrived.\n\nMORE: The 10 most endangered baby names for boys and girls – and one is royal!\n\nCrown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece\n\nGlamorous Greek royal Marie-Chantal and her husband Crown Prince Pavlos have five children together!\n\nTheir firstborn was Princess Maria-Olympia, who they welcomed in 1996. Prince Constantine-Alexios followed next, with Prince Achileas-Andreas baby number three and Prince Odysseus-Kimon number four. The baby of the family is Prince Aristidis-Stavro who was born in 2008.\n\nCrown Princess Mary of Denmark\n\nDanish royal Princess Mary also has a large family with her husband Crown Prince Frederik, whom she married in May 2004.\n\nA year and a half later in October 2005, the couple welcomed their first child Prince Christian and two years later baby number two, Princess Isabella, came along. The royals subsequently had a four-year gap before their twins, son Prince Vincent and daughter Princess Josephine arrived.\n\nPrincess Caroline of Monaco\n\nThe Monaco royal is another regal lady with a large brood. Princess Caroline married her second husband Stefano Casiraghi in 1983 and had three children with him: Andrea, Charlotte and Pierre, all within four years of each other between 1984 and 1987.\n\nFollowing Stefano's tragic death in a boating accident in 1990, the Princess married Prince Ernst August of Hanover in 1999. The couple has one daughter together, Princess Alexandra.\n\nMORE: Royal mums before and after birth: from blooming bumps to bouncing babies\n\nQueen Rania of Jordan\n\nThe Jordanian royal married her husband King Abdullah bin Al-Hussein in June 1993 and a year later they welcomed their first child, Crown Prince Hussein. Fast forward two years and Rania's first daughter Princess Iman was born.\n\nThe couple then had a four-year gap before welcoming Princess Salma in 2000. Their second son Prince Hashem was then born five years later in 2005.\n\nQueen Mathilde of Belgium\n\nJust like the Queen, Mathilde also has four children with her own Prince Philippe. The couple married in 1999, having their first child, Princess Elisabeth, in 2001. Prince Gabriel arrived in 2003, followed by Prince Emmanuel in 2005 and his sister, Princess Eleonore, in 2008.\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg\n\nOur hats go off to Luxembourg's Maria Teresa who has five children! The Grand Duchess married Prince Henri in 1981, welcoming their first child, Guillaume, the same year. Prince Felix arrived in 1984 and Prince Louis in 1986. The couple then had a five-year break before welcoming Princess Alexandra in 1991 and her brother, Prince Sebastien, in 1992."
