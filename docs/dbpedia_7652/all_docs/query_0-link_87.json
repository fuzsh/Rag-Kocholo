        "text": "Although the Spanish and American occupations quashed the country’s shamanistic traditions, drag burlesque performances also emerged during that time, according to Scout magazine. Fast forward to the 1960s, and drag began to enter the Philippine mainstream: think films and beauty pageants.\n\nDrag might have been pigeonholed as nothing but a comedy act in the 2000s, but the Filipino drag queens of today have gone above and beyond to show that drag is not just about fancy clothes and make-up, lip-synch performances and funny antics. In the process, they’ve transformed from gay bar performers to outspoken influencers with an ever-expanding audience.\n\nEva Le Queen\n\nEva Le Queen is a former corporate project manager and HR consultant who founded Drag Playhouse PH, a local drag entertainment company that aims to provide a platform for drag artists as well as more authentic drag-related content for Filipinos.\n\nIn an interview with Lifestyle Inquirer, Le Queen said: “In the past, local drag queens and performers could only be seen inside nightclubs and LGBTQ+ establishments, and a lot of enthusiasts and artists don’t have access to such places, especially minors and those living in the provinces.” That’s why her focus has shifted to “hosting and co-producing online shows and parties. In doing so, I’m able to gather people and provide platforms for other drag artists to be seen and perform.”\n\nDee Dee Marie Holliday\n\nWorking in a financial firm by day, Dee Dee Marie Holliday undergoes a fabulous transformation by night. Her interest in drag started after seeing the American comedy film To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, according to Lifestyle Inquirer. She considers drag an effective means to confront masculinity and misogyny.\n\n“It takes a lot of courage to come out dressed to the nines in broad daylight, to face the harsh world of discrimination, just to express our artistry and who we are,” she told Manila Bulletin. “Drag queens are at the forefront of the fight for equality.”\n\nBrigiding “Gigi” Aricheta\n\nThe “drag daughter” of Holliday, Aricheta might be new to the drag circuit, but she is currently one of its most talked-about names. Not only does she have over 15,000 Instagram followers, she is also signed to one of the Philippines’ biggest creative agencies, Cornerstone Entertainment. She views drag as a form of political expression as well as a creative art, she once explained in an interview with Metro Style.\n\nAricheta, who uses both he and she pronouns, is known for her bold and extravagant looks onstage, hoping to encourage viewers to “express the many layers of life” with their fashion choices too.\n\nPrince Marell\n\nMarell is one of the co-founders of Drag Playhouse PH. Her TikTok make-up transformation video set to Lil Nas X’s Montero (Call Me By Your Name) went viral back in April for serving up the ultimate dark queen look with heavy jewellery, a big red wig and stunning make-up. Aside from doing drag, she manages her own make-up and merch line.\n\nMarina Summers\n\nAnother co-founder of Drag Playhouse PH, Marina Summers’ drag persona is an extension of her love for the beach, which she finds soothing, she told Village Pipol.\n\nBefore she stepped into the spotlight, Summers created content about the LGBTQ+ community while working as a TV producer for ABS-CBN, where she was able to feature Filipino drag queens. She began performing in 2019 and recently released her debut single I Have Arrived on Spotify and iTunes.\n\nVinas Deluxe\n\nVinas Deluxe wears many hats as drag artist, events host, vlogger, comedian and CEO of Deluxe Wigs. She recently performed alongside Filipino singer-actress Nadine Lustre in a virtual concert that honoured drag queens and aimed to raise funds to help displaced elderly gay communities.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning. Other Filipino drag queens you might want to follow on Instagram, stat, include:\n\nPura Luka Vega\n\nAndy Crocker\n\nLady Gagita\n\nMC Black\n\nO-A\n\nPrecious Paula Nicole\n\nMorbucks"
