        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Netflix has found its AJ. Izzy G (aka Izzy Gaspersz) is set to star opposite RuPaul Charles in comedy series AJ and the Queen, from Charles and 2 Broke Girls co-creator and former Sex and the City showrunner Michael Patrick King.\n\nWritten by King and Charles, the series stars RuPaul as Ruby Red, a bigger-than-life but down-on-her-luck drag queen who travels across America from club to club in a rundown 1990s RV with her unlikely sidekick AJ (Izzy G), a recently orphaned, tough-talking, scrappy 9-year-old stowaway. As these two misfits — one tall, one small — travel from city to city, Ruby’s message of love and acceptance winds up touching people and changing their lives for the better. Oh, and RuPaul performs a killer musical number in every drag club.\n\nIzzy G’s AJ is cocky and confident on the outside, while hiding all the vibrant emotions and feelings of a confused, angry and sometimes very scared 9-year-old.\n\nIn addition to Charles, she joins previously announced cast members Josh Segarra, Michael-Leon Wooley, Katerina Tannenbaum and Tia Carrere.\n\nRuPaul and King executive produce. King’s MPK Productions produces in association with Warner Bros. TV.\n\nLos Angeles-born Izzy G is in post-production on her first feature film, Netflix’s Highwaymen, opposite Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner and directed by John Lee Hancock. She’ll also be seen in crime thriller A Violent Separation, directed by Kevin and Michael Goetz. Izzy G is repped by Jessie Greene at Monster Talent Management and Skrzyniarz and Mallean."
