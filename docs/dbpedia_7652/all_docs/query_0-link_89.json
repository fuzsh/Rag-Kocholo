It was an emotional journey, and I've been sitting on my reflections, to myself, for a while now. Maybe because of the model minority myth to just shut up, as I have been of my own experiences and feelings over the past decades. Instead I've decided to abandon the stereotype of being quiet that's ascribed to Asians - and to publish this piece. There's so much more work to be done to push for inclusion of AAPIs in America, and in the LGBTQ+ community, and I hope you can be a part of it. Thank you to Jordyn Taylor & Frances Lee at Hearst for convincing me my story was worth being shared. #aapiheritagemonth #pridemonth #diversity #inclusion #stopasianhate #culture #conversationsforchange #outonlinkedin"
