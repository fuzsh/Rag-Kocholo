Born in Guatemala and now living in Auckland, Flor is a sultry Latin queen, who has been doing drag for six years.\n\nRepresenting the Latin communities of Aotearoa and Auckland, Florâs drag name was inspired by her mother.\n\nIndeed, Florâs main inspiration is strong Latin women who are aware of their voices and stay true to who they are.\n\nGabriella Labucci\n\n31, Victoria Australia\n\nPronouns in drag: She/Her\n\nPronouns out of drag: He/Him\n\nGabriella Labucci is a force to be reckoned with in the world of cabaret and drag performance.

They most recently were seen performing as a Destiny Child Member with the Grammy Award-winning Kelly ROWLAND at the 2023 Domain Dance Party for Sydney World Pride and also appearing as a headliner at the 2022 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade.\n\nSpeaking on representation and why that matters, Hollywould says, âAs a queer person and a person of colour, I feel like itâs ten times harder for us, especially, not having that representation. So, Iâm just Iâm so grateful to have this opportunity and for people to see that on the screen and know that itâs okayâ¦ and you know, they can do it tooâ, adding, âThere arenât many of us here in Australia who get this opportunity. I do not take it lightly.â\n\nIsis Avis Loren\n\n33, Melbourne Australia\n\nPronouns in drag: She/They\n\nPronouns out of drag: They/him/she\n\nIsis Avis Loren encapsulates her audience with a mix of old-fashioned glamour & fierce, edgy entertainment.\n\nIsis is a prominent queen of the Naarm, Melbourne, drag scene. Isis has graced many stages in Australia and overseas and with her high fashion couture creations made by her own hand, she is well known for her design and seamstress skills. A formidable competitor, this sweetheart certainly knows her way around a sewing machine, having dressed much of the elite Melbourne drag scene.\n\nIvanna Drink\n\n26, Auckland New Zealand\n\nPronouns in drag: She/Her\n\nPronouns out of drag: He/Him\n\nIvanna Drink is a recognisable face on Aucklandâs Cabaret scene as resident Emcee and Showgirl.

With a love for fashion, her looks are always polished from head to toe, while pushing boundaries. Ivory is fairly new to the drag scene, and unlike some of her fellow competitors drag is not Ivoryâs fulltime occupation, but Ivoryâs bank job doesnât hold her back from exploring all things drag or prevent her from bringing her exuberance to the drag scene, as well as her sweet and wholesome personality.\n\nRita Menu\n\n24, Hamilton New Zealand\n\nPronouns in drag: She/Her\n\nPronouns out of drag: He/Him\n\nOur baby queen, Rita, has only been doing drag for a year. She considers herself super competitive and bills herself as a singer, dancer, and seamstress. Despite her lack of experience, Rita has already wowed audiences in the New Zealand drag scene with performances at local nightclubs as well as winning Kita and Anitaâs Drag Wars competition in Auckland."
