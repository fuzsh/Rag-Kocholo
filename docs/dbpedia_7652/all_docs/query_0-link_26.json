        "text": "American drag queen (born 1987)\n\nHera Hoffer (born September 18, 1987), best known under the stage name Jinkx Monsoon, is an American drag queen, actress, singer and comedian. She has been noted for her celebrity impersonations, quick wit, and musical theatre-inspired performance style.[1]\n\nIn 2013, she won the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race. In 2022, with an all-winners cast, she won the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, becoming the first two-time winner of the show across its iterations. She made her Broadway debut in 2023.[2]\n\nShe has also pursued a career in music, releasing two studio albums titled The Inevitable Album (2014) and The Ginger Snapped (2018). In film, Monsoon appeared with her collaborative partner BenDeLaCreme in the holiday film The Jinkx and DeLa Holiday Special (2021) which was later released on Hulu. In television, Monsoon appears in the WOW Presents Plus original Sketchy Queens, a series she created alongside Liam Krug.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHoffer was born in Portland, Oregon, and first performed in drag at age 15 at the all-ages Escape Nightclub.[3][4] Her original drag name was going to be \"Heidi Destruction\" before settling on Jinkx Monsoon.[5] She attended da Vinci Arts Middle School and Grant High School.[6][7] Hoffer was raised Catholic, and discovered Russian-Jewish ancestry on her mother's side at the age of 18.[8] Her drag character, Jinkx, is characterized as Jewish as a way of reconnecting with this part of her heritage.[9]\n\nHoffer worked as a janitor through college and graduated with a BFA in theater from Cornish College of the Arts in 2010.[10][11][12] She had lived in Seattle, Washington up until 2018.[13] In October 2018, she moved back to Portland and currently lives in a house named Monsoon Manor.[14]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2011-2012: Career beginnings and Drag Becomes Him\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter moving to Seattle from Portland, Hoffer and creative partner Nick Sahoyah wrote and starred in multiple Funny or Die webisodes titled Monsoon Season in which she played Jinkx Monsoon as an overbearing, substance addled, near-psychotic mother to Sahoyah's character, Kamikaze Monsoon.[15] In 2011, Hoffer appeared in the Wes Hurley film Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel.[16]\n\nIn June 2011, Hoffer became the subject of a YouTube docu-series by Alex Berry, a Seattle videographer. Named after Death Becomes Her, one of Jinkx's favorite movies, Drag Becomes Him explores Hoffer's life in and out of drag.[17] The series has continued with a full length documentary film also called \"Drag Becomes Him'. In October 2013 it was turned into a feature-length film with Seattle-based producer Basil Shadid on board. A Kickstarter campaign in March 2014 successfully raised funds to complete the project, and it premiered at April 29, 2015 at Seattle's Cinerama.\n\nIn January 2012, Hoffer appeared as Moritz in the rock musical Spring Awakening at the Balagan Theater in Seattle. Controversy arose from The Seattle Times review by Misha Berson, who said that she was \"overly flamboyant\" for the role.[18][19] Dan Savage defended Hoffer's portrayal of Moritz.[20] From July 21 to August 19, she starred as Angel in the 5th Avenue Theatre's production of the musical RENT.[12][21]\n\n2012–2017: RuPaul's Drag Race and The Inevitable Album\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 2012, Logo announced that Jinkx Monsoon was among fourteen drag queens who would be competing on the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[22] Monsoon was inspired to audition after seeing Sharon Needles on the fourth season of the show.[4] Monsoon won the main-challenges for the episodes \"Snatch Game\" and \"Drama Queens\".[23][24] For the \"Snatch Game\", Monsoon impersonated Edith Bouvier Beale, nicknamed as \"Little Edie.\"[3][25] Monsoon also impersonated third-season contestant Mimi Imfurst in the episode \"Lip Synch Extravaganza Eleganza\".[26] Monsoon later won the season, with two maxi-challenge wins.\n\nIn January 2013, Hoffer played Hedwig in the Moore Theatre's production of the rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch.[27] Balagan reprised the production in December 2013 for a week long run with Hoffer and the original cast/production team. In June 2013, she played Velma Von Tussle in the Seattle Men's Chorus/5th Avenue Theatre's production of the musical Hairspray.[28]\n\nHoffer also performed as Jinkx Monsoon in the original one act cabaret musical The Vaudevillians under the name \"Kitty Witless.\" She was accompanied by musical partner and co-creator Richard Andriessen who performs under the name \"Dr. Dan Von Dandy.\" The Vaudevillians performed at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York City from July to November 2013.[3][29][30] After touring Australia with The Vaudevillians, she received a nomination for the Helpmann Award for Best Cabaret Performer.[31] In 2013, Hoffer was chosen as one of the Artists of the Year by City Arts magazine along with Megan Griffiths, Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, and Wes Hurley.[32] She played Tallulah/Dennis, the owner of Lipstick Lounge in an episode of Blue Bloods entitled \"Manhattan Queens\", which aired on January 31, 2014. In 2015, Hoffer joined the cast of Wes Hurley's comedy series Capitol Hill.[33]\n\nOn May 6, 2014, Monsoon released her debut studio album The Inevitable Album through Sidecar Records. The album is a blend of blues, jazz, traditional pop, and cabaret, and was inspired by artists like Bette Midler, Marlene Dietrich, Peggy Lee, Amanda Palmer, and Regina Spektor.[34] The song \"The Bacon Shake\" features Fred Schneider of The B-52s, and tells of \"a bawdy, after-hours gentleman's club and this woman is 'getting the boys thirsty,' and it turns into a big dance that everyone joins.\"[35]\n\nIn May 2017, Monsoon appeared in the celebrity roast of Michael Musto alongside Bianca Del Rio, Orfeh, Michael Riedel, Randy Rainbow, Crystal Demure, Countess Luann de Lesseps, Judy Gold, and Randy Jones. The roast which was produced by Daniel DeMello and directed by Rachel Klein, was hosted by Bruce Vilanch and introduced by Rosie O'Donnell. [36] [37] [38]\n\n2018–2021: The Ginger Snapped and The Jinkx & DeLa Holiday Special\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 12, 2018, Monsoon released her second studio album The Ginger Snapped through Producer Entertainment Group. The album is inspired by 90s grunge, garage rock, and ska, and features appearances from Amanda Palmer, Fred Schneider, and Lady Rizo.[39] She released an animated music video for the song \"Cartoons and Vodka\", which sees Monsoon transform into various cartoon styles, including Betty Boop, The Jetsons, Sailor Moon, Doug, Dragon Ball Z, Steven Universe, Beavis and Butt-Head, Adventure Time, Rick and Morty, Peanuts, Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, and The Fairly OddParents.[40] The same month, Hoffer voiced the character Emerald on Steven Universe in the episode \"Lars of the Stars\".[41]\n\nIn 2019, Hoffer was cast as Calliope in a North American tour of the musical Xanadu, though the tour was later cancelled.[42] In June 2019, a panel of judges from New York magazine placed Monsoon 18th on their list of \"the most powerful drag queens in America\", a ranking of 100 former Drag Race contestants.[43] In 2020, Hoffer appeared in the Hulu original Christmas film Happiest Season.[44] The same year she starred in and co-wrote The Jinkx and DeLa Holiday Special, a feature-length holiday film with fellow Seattle drag queen BenDeLaCreme based on their various Christmas shows over the years. The duo toured the show around the world in 2021.[45] The tour was renewed in 2022 and 2023.[46]\n\n2022–present: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, Broadway debut, and Doctor Who\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2022, it was announced that Monsoon would be competing on the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, the first all-winners edition of the franchise. She won the Snatch Game in the second episode with her impressions of Natasha Lyonne and Judy Garland.[47] She also won the fourth, fifth, ninth, and tenth episodes. On July 29, 2022, she was crowned the winner and anointed with the title \"Queen of All Queens\" with a cash prize of $200,000.\n\nIn November 2022, it was announced that Hoffer would join the Broadway company of the musical Chicago, playing the role of Mama Morton for eight weeks, becoming the first drag queen to perform in a major Broadway musical.[48]\n\nIn April 2023, it was announced that Monsoon would be joining the cast of the fourteenth series of Doctor Who (Season 1) which was to be screened jointly between BBC and Disney+ playing a \"major role\".[49] It was later revealed that Monsoon would be playing the villain \"Maestro\" in the episode \"The Devil's Chord\", which aired in May 2024.[50]\n\nFrom April 2, 2024 to May 26, 2024, Monsoon portrayed Audrey in the Off-Broadway production of Little Shop of Horrors.[51]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2017 Hoffer stated she identified as \"non-gendered\" or non-binary,[52][53] and went by singular they pronouns when not in drag. In an April 2017 interview, Monsoon stated, \"I've never identified as fully male. I've always identified as more gender fluid or gender ambiguous, but I never knew the vocabulary to explain it for myself.\"[54] In a 2024 interview, Monsoon stated that she identifies as trans-femme and uses she/her pronouns.[55]\n\nHoffer has narcolepsy, a fact that she revealed in the season five premiere of RuPaul's Drag Race.[56]\n\nIn January 2021, Hoffer married her partner Michael Abbott in a small ceremony at home with their friends and family witnessing through video call. The marriage was officiated by comedian Deven Green.[57] In February 2024, Abbott announced his separation from Hoffer.[58]\n\nIn April 2024, Hoffer legally changed her name to Hera Hoffer, but still kept her stage name of Jinkx Monsoon.[59]\n\nPolitical views\n\n[edit]\n\nHoffer is very outspoken on her Instagram and Twitter about former US President Donald Trump and LGBT equality. She is a Democratic Party supporter and donated to both Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's campaigns to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2020.[60] She is a public supporter of trans rights and frequently makes posts on social media advocating for trans people.\n\nArtistry\n\n[edit]\n\nHoffer's drag persona is inspired by her mother and the comedians Lucille Ball, Maria Bamford, Deven Green, and Sarah Silverman. Her drag persona's last name, Monsoon, is derived from the character Edina Monsoon from the British sitcom Absolutely Fabulous.[4] Hoffer also performs as the drag character Deirdre A. Irwin, who is a Southern medium.[13]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details The Inevitable Album[61]\n\nReleased: May 6, 2014\n\nLabel: Sidecar Records\n\nFormats: CD, digital download, streaming\n\nThe Ginger Snapped[62]\n\nReleased: January 12, 2018\n\nLabel: Producer Entertainment Group\n\nFormats: CD, digital download, streaming\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details Red Head Redemption[63]\n\nReleased: May 23, 2023\n\nLabel: Comedy Dynamics\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nSoundtrack albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details The Jinkx & Dela Holiday Special (with BenDeLaCreme)[63]\n\nReleased: December 11, 2020\n\nLabel: Self-released\n\nFormats: LP, digital download, streaming\n\nRemix albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details ReAnimated[64]\n\nReleased: October 13, 2015\n\nLabel: Sidecar Records, Producer Entertainment Group, Streaming\n\nFormat: CD, Digital download\n\nTitle Details The Inevitable Commentary Album[65]\n\nReleased: July 2, 2014\n\nLabel: Sidecar Records, Producer Entertainment Group\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details The Virgo Odyssey: Prologue\n\nReleased: August 12, 2022\n\nLabel: self-released\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nSong Year Album \"Coffee & Wine\"[66] 2014 The Inevitable Album \"The Bacon Shake\"[67]\n\n(featuring Fred Schneider) \"Creep\"[68] \"Hold On JMX (GlitterMix)\"\n\n(featuring Jean Morisoon) 2015 ReAnimated \"Cartoons and Vodka\" 2018 The Ginger Snapped \"Know-It-All\" 2022 The Virgo Odyssey: Prologue \"Internationolidays\"\n\n(with BenDeLaCreme) Non-album single \"Strange Magic\" The Virgo Odyssey: Prologue \"Space & Time\" \"Looking at the Lights\"\n\n(with BenDeLaCreme) 2022 Non-album singles \"The Lavender Song\"[69] 2023\n\nFeatured singles\n\n[edit]\n\nSong Year Album \"Can I Get an Amen?\"\n\n(RuPaul featuring the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race, season 5) 2013 Non-album singles \"Schizophrenic\"[70]\n\n(Two Dudes in Love featuring Jinkx Monsoon) \"Bring It\"[71]\n\n(Manila Luzon featuring Jinkx Monsoon) \"Legends\" (Cast Version)\n\n(RuPaul featuring the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 7) 2022 \"2gether 4eva\" (The Other Girls)\n\n(with the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 7)\n\nOther appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nSong Year Other Artist(s) Album \"Red & Green\" 2015 N/A Christmas Queens \"Passive Aggressive Christmas\" 2016 Major Scales Christmas Queens 2 \"Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah\" 2017 N/A Christmas Queens 3 \"The Auld Lang Syne Song\" \"Jingle Bell Rock\" 2018 N/A Christmas Queens 4\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nSong Year Director \"Jinkxalicious\"[72] 2011 Alex Berry \"Coffee & Wine\"[73] 2014 \"The Bacon Shake\"[74] Steve Willis \"Creep\"[75] \"Hold On JMX (GlitterMix)\"[76] 2015 \"Red & Green\"[77] Santiago Felipé \"Cartoons & Vodka\"[78] 2018 Mac Kerman \"Just Me (The Gender Binary Blues)\"[79] Santiago Felipé \"She Evil\"[80] Brad Hammer, Shawn Adeli \"Strange Magic\"[81] 2022 Frank Correa \"Know-It-All\"[82] Assaad Yacoub\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role 2011 Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel Herself/Davey 2013 East of Adin Anthony Johnson 2014 Drag Becomes Him Herself 2019 Trixie Mattel: Moving Parts Herself 2019 The Queens[83] Herself 2020 Happiest Season[84] Em K.
