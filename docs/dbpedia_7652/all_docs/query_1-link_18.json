Usually billed as RuPaul Charles, he has played men in a number of roles, and makes public appearances both in and out of drag.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nWith hair, heels, and attitude, honey, I am through the roof.\n\nQuoted by David Alderson, Linda R. Anderson in: Territories of Desire in Queer Culture: Refiguring Contemporary Boundaries, Manchester University Press, 2000, p. 172\n\nPeople ask, \"Why do you dress like a woman?\" I don't dress like a woman. I dress like a drag queen.\n\nQuoted in Let's Talk about Sex: More Than 600 Quotes on the World's Oldest Obsession, Felicia Zopol, ed. (2002)\n\nI will not be ignored. I am here to stay.\n\nQuoted in Queer Quotes: On Coming Out and Culture, Love and Lust, Politics and Pride, and Much More, Teresa Theophano, ed. (2004)\n\nWhat other people think of me is not my business. What I do is what I do. How people see me doesn’t change what I decide to do. I don’t choose projects so people don’t see me as one thing or another. I choose projects that excite me.\n\nInterview with David Shankbone (2007)\n\nIf you have goals and the stick-with-it-ness to make things happen, people will feel threatened by you, especially if your goals don’t include them. They believe that if you take a piece of pie, then that leaves less pie for them. Seeing you follow your dreams leaves them realizing that they’re not following theirs. In truth, there is unlimited pie for everyone!\n\nIn: Workin' It!: RuPaul's Guide to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Style, HarperCollins, 2 February 2010, p. 6\n\nThe point about pop culture is that so much of it is borrowed. There's very little that's brand new. Instead, creativity today is a kind of shopping process—picking up on and sampling things form the world around you, things you grew up with\n\nQuoted by Ryan Castillo in: Syllabus: Communication & Popular Culture, University of Denver\n\nLook at me--a big old black man under all of this makeup, and if I can look beautiful, so can you.\n\nQuoted by Joslyn Pine in: Book of African-American Quotations, Courier Dover Publications, 2 March 2012, p. 160\n\nAll sins are forgiven once you start making a lot of money.\n\nQuoted by Joslyn Pine in: Money and Wealth: A Book of Quotations, Courier Dover Publications, 2 September 2013, p. 209\n\nI don’t have to explain myself. My frequency is very common and is open to anybody to tune in\n\nQuoted by Joslyn Pine in: \"Book of African-American Quotations\"\n\nBe very careful of what you allow to infiltrate your consciousness and subconsciousness. When you watch too much television, you'll start to feel inferior from all the commercials hard selling the idea that you're not complete unless you buy their product [...] The ad agencies appeal to your fear of not being wanted or loved. It's the same with the local news. They get you to stay tuned with a constant stream of fear tactics [...] It's as if our culture is addicted to fear and the flat screen is our drug dealer. Don't allow that crap into your head!\n\nIn: Veronica Well You Better Werk! 10 Life Lessons From RuPaul In (Mostly) Gif Form, MadameNoire, 30 July 2013\n\nIf you don't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?\n\nIn: Abiola Abrams The Sacred Bombshell Handbook of Self-Love: The 11 Secrets of Feminine Power, El Dorado Publishing, 25 June 2014, p. 30\n\nDrag is really about mocking identity. Drag is really about reminding people that you are more than you think you are – you are more than what it says on your passport.\n\nQuoted by Owen Myers in The subversive genius of RuPaul (2015)\n\nWe had a very hostile period [towards drag] after 9/11, especially in America, that was very fear based. And right now, we are enjoying an open window, politically and culturally. But don’t be fooled – all of this is cyclical. I’ve seen the window open in my lifetime and I’ve seen it close.\n\nQuoted by Owen Myers in The subversive genius of RuPaul (2015)\n\nI’ve seen trends ebb and flow. I’ve seen progress and I’ve seen regression, not just in gay movements, but in all types of movements — whether it’s gender or sexuality or race. All kinds of different movements. And humans are fickle. Humans are very trendy. And they’re posers. If some economic change happens, it can all go to shit, honestly. And I’ve seen it happen in my lifetime. So do I trust that this is what it is and it’ll stick forever? I’m skeptical and I’m cautious.\n\nQuoted by Doug Rule in RuPaul: Ultimate Queen (2016)\n\nLike I said before, there are windows of openness in our culture. And then our culture closes those windows down just as fast. And I’ve seen it in my lifetime, time and time again. Right now I’m enjoying the freedom that we all have. But it could really all end. What happened in Germany in the early ’30s, no one could have imagined that — except for the people who had lived through that kind of thing before. And it’s all cyclical. So we have a certain freedom now. And I’m not just talking about gay people. I’m talking about everyone. We have a certain freedom now. But that could all change in a heartbeat.\n\nQuoted by Doug Rule in RuPaul: Ultimate Queen (2016)\n\nIn a culture, you can choose fear or love. It’s been my experience and my observation that humans on this planet feel more comfortable with fear rather than love and openness... I do know what history tells us about humans. And humans, they actually don’t feel very comfortable with openness and freedom.\n\nQuoted by Doug Rule in RuPaul: Ultimate Queen (2016)\n\nI have been discriminated against by white people for being black, by black people for being gay, by gay people for being too fem. Did I let them stop me from getting to this chair?\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race - S10E13 (2018)\n\nMisattributed\n\n[edit]\n\nYou're born naked. The rest is drag.\n\nQuoted in Queer Quotes: On Coming Out and Culture, Love and Lust, Politics and Pride, and Much More, Teresa Theophano, ed. (2004)\n\nThis quote is a paraphrase of a line by Tede Matthews in the 1977 documentary Word is Out. Matthews said \"We're all born naked, and anything anybody wears at any time is drag.\"[1]\n\nAbout RuPaul\n\n[edit]\n\nHe/she is the host, mentor and inspiration of RuPaul's Drag Race, the ultimate drag queen competition.
