        "text": "Grab your wig glue and tighten those tucks because Drag: The Musical is officially coming to NYC! With a cast full of RuPaul's Drag Race stars, the musical will begin performances September 30 Off-Broadway at New World Stages, with opening night set for October 21.\n\nDrag Race star Alaska Thunderfuck, known mononymously as Alaska, wrote the musical alongside collaborators Tomas Costanza and Ashley Gordon. The show follows two rival drag bars, each fighting for survival while dealing with financial troubles.\n\nAlaska will be part of the opening night cast, too, performing with the show through January 11, 2025. She'll be joined by fellow Drag Race alums Jujubee and Jan Sport, along with Lagoona Bloo, J. Elaine Marcos, and Joey McIntyre (through November 24). More casting will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nThe show made its world premiere at the Bourbon Room in 2022, and played an encore run there earlier this year. Check out highlights from the 2022 premiere here, and listen to the cast recording here.\n\nSays Alaska in a statement: \"When I first moved to Los Angeles, I dreamt of being an actor. Then I realized being an actor is hard, so I became a Drag Queen. Now, after almost 20 years of drag, I've written myself into a musical. I think New York audiences are going to love this sweet and simple tale of Drag Queens being cunty to one another. What Iâ€™m trying to say is: Dreams really do come true.\"\n\nThe production features scenic design by Jason Sherwood, costume design by Marco Marco, lighting design by Adam Honore, sound design by Drew Levy, and projection design by Aaron Rhyne. KGM Theatrical is general manager, and casting is by RBT Casting's Ryan Bernard Tymensky.\n\nThe producing team for the Off-Broadway bow includes Costanza, Scott Prisand, Matthew Weaver, Hillary Weaver, Janet Billig Rich, Concord Theatricals, Paolo & Jodie Coppola, Aron & Gabe Alves-Tomko, David Charpentier, Jacob Slane, Producer Entertainment Group, MJ Humenuik, and Sarina Neer."
