        "meta_description": "For over fifteen years the reality television series RuPaul’s Drag Race has undeniably globally impacted the way drag is perceived and consumed. This seminar + course, structured like Drag Race with mini challenges, maxi challenges and a runway final project, explores the Emmy Award winning show and the international empire it has generated. The class interrogates the show’s representations of gender, race, ethnicity, body image, community and style as it places the show into larger contextual histories of reality television and drag performance from vaudeville and the 1980s East Village to House balls, Wigstock and Bushwig. Today’s drag culture wars are probed along with queries including: What is the public’s ongoing fascination with drag and how does RPDR foster and reshape it and the profession? How do RuPaul’s Drag Con, drag kids and drag brunches fit into the phenomenon? How does the show impact local drag communities and politics as it expands into an international media franchise? Readings from academic essay anthologies, popular media, fan sites as well video viewings and the possibility of guest speakers are featured throughout the course. This course fulfills an elective requirement for Theater majors and minors.",
