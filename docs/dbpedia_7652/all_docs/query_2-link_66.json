        "text": "To call American drag performer, TV host, actor, and recording artist, RuPaul Andre Charles inspiring would be an understatement. As the most commercially successful drag queen in the world, with global fame from hosting his own reality drag competition series RuPaul’s Drag Race, RuPaul is known for his witty truths.\n\nGet motivated with these RuPaul quotes that will challenge the way you think!\n\nTop 10 Most Epic RuPaul Quotes\n\nBefore we get into these quotes, let’s explore a bit more about who RuPaul is. In the 1980s, RuPaul was a struggling filmmaker and musician, who always found a way to stand out. He hustled in underground cinema, worked as a club dancer, and performed in drag, among other creative and entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nOvertime, Rupaul became known not only for his outrageous outfits, but also for his can-do attitude towards life.\n\nBy 1996, The RuPaul Show premiered on VH1. It was an American talk show that was hosted by RuPaul, who hosted it in full drag. It was one of the first national TV shows in the U.S. to have an openly gay host.\n\nBy 2009, Rupaul premiered the first season of RuPaul’s Drag Race, a reality TV series that depicts him as he hosts a competition to identify “America’s next drag superstar.” The show has now aired for 12 consecutive seasons. It has also given birth to spin-off shows, such as RuPaul’s Drag U, RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars and RuPaul’s Secret Celebrity Drag Race.\n\nRuPaul’s ability to embrace himself has inspired millions to do the same, so it’s no surprise that in 2017, Rupaul was part of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people. That same year he made history as the first drag queen with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nTo capture Rupaul’s wit and widsom, below are ten of Rupaul’s most inspiring quotes of all-time.\n\n1. “If you can’t love yourself how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?”\n\nThis quote RuPaul reminds us of the importance of self-love, which should never be overlooked.\n\nRelationships don’t work unless you love yourself too, otherwise, you’re measuring your worth by someone else. This is the core of Ru’s philosophy. Love yourself first.\n\n2. “We’re all born naked and the rest is drag.”\n\nAccording to Ru, drag has very little to do with someone assigned male at birth putting on a wig, padding, and makeup, or in the reverse, someone assigned female at birth embodying traditionally male characteristics. Rather, drag is whatever we adapt to in life, be it to fit in or stand out.\n\nTo Rupaul, drag is everything. Drag is life. Drag is anytime we put on an outfit and choose how to present ourselves to the world.\n\n3. “When you become the image of your own imagination, it’s the most powerful thing you could ever do.”\n\nSo much of RuPaul’s career was bringing the image of imagination, or his vision to life. Ru is right, that is the most powerful thing anyone can do.\n\nDrag can be anything. Whatever you’ve always dreamed for yourself, when you make it a reality, that is a personal victory.\n\n4. “I feel like you’re being sabotaged by your inner saboteur.”\n\nSometimes we’re our own worst enemy. That little voice inside your head that tells you your vision or dreams are stupid or unattainable. Sometimes that voice wins and we give up, but deep down we always wonder “what if.”\n\nIn RuPaul’s world, our biggest villain lives within us all. This is our “inner saboteur” which pumps up your fears and tells you to give up. While the outside world might fuel your inner saboteur, the real force that holds you back from achieving your goals and dreams is your inner dialogue.\n\nThis short conversation between Rupaul and the drag queen Katya will both give you a laugh and drive home this key point.\n\nSo tell that voice to take a seat and shut up!\n\n5. “What it says on your driver’s license isn’t really who you are—you are something much greater than that.”\n\nThis goes back to the quote that we’re all born naked and the rest is drag. You can’t define yourself by your age, height, sex, name or what you look like when you’re snapped by a DMV camera.\n\nYou can be whoever and whatever you want to be. Don’t let labels define you or hold you back from achieving your dreams and living as your truest, most authentic self.\n\n6. “The overall commentary on what I’m doing is saying, ‘Hey look! I get to create whatever persona I want to, and it’s all up to me. And the truth is, we are all basically the universe—pretending to be humans for a brief moment of time.’”\n\nLife is too short to be caught up or live as someone you don’t want to be. Not one of us knows what we’re doing. We’re all exploring as we go, just as everyone before us has done.\n\nWe are all living here for just a moment of expression in the universe. So we might as well make the most of that moment and shine.\n\n7. “Fulfillment isn’t found over the rainbow—it’s found in the here and now. Today I define success by the fluidity with which I transcend emotional land mines and choose joy and gratitude instead.”\n\nWhile Dorothy was singing about somewhere over the rainbow, really she should’ve focused on the here and now. This goes in line with spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle, who teaches about embracing the power of now. Make the most of every moment and live life fully.\n\nAlso, gratitude is scientifically proven to increase happiness.\n\nPersonally, I do daily gratitude in the morning, evening, and every time I need a boost during the day.\n\nIt has a massive impact on my mental state and I’m grateful for the practice of gratitude. (*See what I just did? That’s how easy it is to practice gratitude!)\n\n8. “That is the key to navigating this life—don’t take it too seriously. That’s when the party begins.”\n\nWhen you take life too seriously it’s hard to have fun. You will be able to get through this life with so much more ease if you laugh at your doubts, fears, and failures.\n\nLife is meant to be celebrated, so commit to enjoying it.\n\n9. “It’s very easy to look at the world and think, this is all so cruel and so mean. It’s important to not become bitter from it.”\n\nThe world can be harsh and we’re living in a time where there is so much hate in the world. But we can’t let that get us down.\n\nWhile the haters are going to hate, you have to keep doing you. Or as Ru puts it, “If they ain’t paying your bills, pay them bitches no mind.” Right?\n\nDon’t give the haters your time, keep focusing on yourself.\n\n10. “You know, the matrix says, ‘Pick an identity and stick with it. Because I want to sell you some beer and shampoo and I need you to stick with what you are so I’ll know how to market it to you.’ Drag is the opposite. Drag says, ‘Identity is a joke.'”\n\nWe’re born naked, the rest is drag. Instead of picking just one identity and having that define you, drag tells you identity is flexible, fun, and you can be whoever you want to be.\n\nRupaul Quotes for Every Occasion\n\nAfter reading these inspiring RuPaul quotes, try applying Ru’s mindsets to your own life.
