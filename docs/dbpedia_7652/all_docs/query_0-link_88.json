        "text": "Steps to Take to Become an Actor/Actress\n\nThe steps toward becoming an actor or actress aren’t quite so clearly defined as becoming a nurse or a dentist. There’s no minimum education requirement. However, those who pursue formal training may have more options available after completing their education. In some cases, aspiring actors might take classes at a theater company's acting conservatory or take acting lessons.\n\nOthers pursue acting as a college major or study filmmaking or theater. In any case, here is an example of how you might systematically approach gaining the skills needed to become a working actor.\n\nWhat Does an Actor/Actress Do?\n\nActors and actresses are people who portray characters in theater, plays, television shows, or movies. Many actors often read at auditions to find work, competing with hundreds or thousands of people for any given role. Some actors primarily work as extras, in the background of movies, TV shows, or commercials, while more successful actors land roles with lines. Many actors find themselves working in other performing arts media While some actors never become stars, they can earn a good living as “character actors”, becoming well-known without ever being the star of a piece.\n\nActing is a challenging skill set to master, as is breaking into the industry. Actors must memorize lines, practice frequently, and be able to work with all kinds of people. In the beginning, much of an actor’s job is auditioning and, as such, they’ll need to develop a thick skin and a lot of patience.\n\nSkills to Acquire\n\nActors don’t typically become a success overnight, and rarely does someone ever become a star after being discovered in one smaller production. As such, you’ll want to make sure that you develop a wide range of skills. Your acting range is essential, but so is understanding how the business works. It might also be smart to pursue behind the scenes work, too.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of the skills you’ll need to be successful as an actor or actress:\n\nAbility to memorize lines\n\nCreativity—actors need to portray characters motivations and feelings in an authentic and interesting manner\n\nAn understanding of a range of acting techniques\n\nAbility to follow directions and work with others\n\nResearch character’s personality traits and situation to bring the role to life\n\nIn some cases, actors must learn how to play an instrument (or seem like they are) or perform stage fighting sequences for a part\n\nActors need to be able to put together a scene for auditions quickly\n\nThey’ll need a thick skin and the resilience to keep auditioning despite frequent rejections\n\nPhysical stamina—actors must speak clearly and portray characters for hours on end. Particularly stage actors need to be in good shape so that they can maintain their energy for the duration of a production. TV and film actors often work long hours beginning early in the morning and going well into the late-night hours.\n\nAlternative Paths\n\nBecoming an actor or actress does not mean that you have to follow a specific path. There’s no formula for success, which makes this a challenging career to break into. There are no minimum educational requirements to consider, so one could seek out auditions and potentially book gigs. However, to be successful, you will need to have some basic acting skills like the ability to memorize lines, follow blocking instructions, and understand how to behave on camera.\n\nIf you don’t go to school to become an actor, you can sign up for classes at a college or university, or an independent acting school.\n\nActor and Actress Careers & Salary\n\nFind Online Colleges Offering Actor/Actress Programs\n\nWhere Might You Work?\n\nAccording to the BLS, 26% of actors are self-employed and 13% work for a theater company. In most cases, you’ll work on projects of varying lengths in a range of environments. Work assignments are typically pretty short, and actors must continuously be looking for their next job. One assignment could last for a day, while the next might last a few months. Consistent gigs might take the form of a long-term contract with a touring company or a starring role in a television series.\n\nAs you might imagine, work hours are irregular. Few actors work full-time, year-round, but when they do book work, they often work 12 or more hours at a time, on weekends, holidays, early mornings, or late at night. Film and television actors may be required to travel to work on location and often travel with a tour.\n\nIn addition to time spent on paid work, actors must consider the time investment of auditioning, networking, and developing their skills. As they get started in this industry, actors often have a day job that pays the bills, on top of learning lines, taking classes, and trying to land their next role. Some actors teach acting classes as a part time job. Those considering this career path must weigh all of the hidden work that happens before making it big.\n\nCareer Outlook\n\nAgain, there’s no educational requirement for becoming an actor, but pay and opportunities are often dependent on skill and connections. According to BLS statistics, those who earn their living as actors have received some level of formal training. It’s not so clear cut, though. That training doesn’t necessarily correspond with pay — for example, earning a master’s degree in performing arts doesn’t ensure a higher pay grade.\n\nThe BLS also reports that actors earn a median hourly wage of $18.80 and wages range from under $10 an hour to $48. So, it’s possible to make a healthy living, but that means continually putting in the legwork to secure gigs. The agency also found that actors who joined unions received more prominent roles and paychecks compared to those who did not. It’s worth pointing out that many casting directors will only work with actors from SAG/AFTRA. However, members are required to pay annual dues, which could be a significant burden for newer actors who might not get paid much.\n\nAdvancing From Here\n\nAdvancing as an actor or actress is more about landing leading roles and earning more money for their craft. It’s not like starting an entry-level job and working your way up to manager. To start landing gigs, you’ll need to know how to audition, which is one area where your education can serve you well. It might be worth it to invest in workshops that teach this skill or further develop the skills you learned in school.\n\nSure, you might start at the bottom, working as an extra, then maybe you’ll book commercials. From there, you might land a small recurring role on a television show, eventually landing more significant roles. Often that big paycheck comes after years of taking work with a wide range of pay rates. Success, from a realistic standpoint, means finding steady work and continuing to hone your craft.\n\nActors often “advance” by improving their reputation by completing roles successfully. As they gain experience, they’ll move on to more challenging parts and better-paying jobs. You can boost your profile by performing well and by demonstrating that you are professional, easy to work with, and reliable.\n\nIn other cases, actors might work in the industry for a time before deciding they’d like to become a producer, a writer, or a director. While moving from in front of the camera to behind the scenes is a shift, many actors end up moving into these roles and finding success.\n\nAs with any field, networking is essential, too. Join casting agencies and make sure you speak with other people in your industry. While there’s no one way to break into the acting game, or advance your career, making connections is one of the best things you can do for your job."
