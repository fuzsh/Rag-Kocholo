        "text": "RuPaul is best known for his empire of Emmy-winning shows, including \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and \"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars,\" but the famed drag queen is also a married man. Since 1994, RuPaul has been in a relationship with his now-husband Georges LeBar. The longtime couple officially tied the knot in 2017, but the television host rarely talks about his marriage. That's because RuPaul's husband is much more low-key than his spouse.\n\nWhile many celeb couples consist of two megastars, this marriage is a little different: one partner is a drag star and reality TV host, and the other is a rancher. Yep, you read that right. LeBar is the manager of a 60,000-acre ranch on land in Wyoming and South Dakota.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Entertainment Tonight, RuPaul revealed that he and the Australia-born rancher met on the dance floor of the Limelight club in 1994 and shared why they decided to get married after being together for more than two decades. \"He was dancing like a crazed person,\" RuPaul said. \"I went over and said, 'What are you doing?' You know, and that was that.\"\n\nThe reality show host went on to explain that the 2016 presidential election spurred him and LeBar to marry. \"We are devoted to each other,\" he added. \"We don't stand on ceremony. We thought, we don't have to get married. But then, in light of what's happening currently in the world today, what's happening in Washington, we thought, you know what? Let's do it. Let's just do it, because there's too much at stake with our businesses . . . so, that's why we did it.\"\n\nThe pair ultimately exchanged their \"I dos\" in a small Los Angeles ceremony, but RuPaul insisted having a piece of paper declaring them legally married hasn't changed their relationship one bit. \"That paper don't mean nothin'!\" he continued. \"If you're devoted to a person, nothing's gonna change that. And after 23 years, you know, hey, I know him. He knows me. I love him. He's my favorite person on the planet I've met.\"\n\nLeBar and RuPaul's marriage is all about trust. They often spend time apart due to LeBar preferring ranch life and RuPaul loving his Hollywood career, but they always make time for each other and their relationship. They also have a shared home base: a glamorous home in Beverly Hills, which was featured in an Architectural Digest spread in May.\n\nThe reality TV star has also opened up about having an open marriage and why it works for him and his husband, speaking on the subject in a 2019 video interview with Vanity Fair.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to put restraints on the person I love the most on this planet,\" he explained. \"Listen, if you get something that you cannot resist and that is gonna make you happy, go for it. Because the truth is, I know in my heart of hearts like I've ever known anything before, that man loves me more than anything else in this world.\"\n\nSince LeBar is usually away from Hollywood and working on his ranch, he doesn't often appear on red carpets with his celeb husband. \"He doesn't care about show business at all. He could care less,\" RuPaul said on Hollywood Today Live (per Marie Claire). \"Most of the time, he's on the ranch in Wyoming. He has a 60,000-acre ranch — it's in two states, it's in South Dakota, too. When I go there, I dress up in Western wear and nobody cares.\"\n\nStill, LeBar has accompanied his husband to some events over the years, so we've rounded up a few of the rare photos of the pair together. Take a look at some of their sweet pics in the gallery ahead."
