That year, he received his own talk show on VH1, \"The RuPaul Show,\" while co-hosting the morning radio show on WKTU with Michelle Visage. He has had continued success as a recording artist, releasing 15 studio albums, including \"Foxy Lady,\" \"Champion,\" \"Glamazon,\" \"Born Naked,\" and \"American.\"\n\nAs an actor, RuPaul has made appearances in films and TV shows, including \"Crooklyn,\" \"The Brady Bunch Movie,\" \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!
