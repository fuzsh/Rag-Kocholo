        "text": "Michelle Visage stormed back onto our screens in January 2023 to judge yet another season of the hugely popular RuPaul's Drag Race.\n\nThe mother-of-two is best known for her time on the MTV show in the US as well as for her work in the UK, such as when she wowed audiences back in 2019 when she took part in Strictly Come Dancing alongside Giovanni Pernice.\n\nDuring her time in the ballroom competition, Michelle's husband of 24 years, David Case, was one of her biggest cheerleaders, and regularly tweeted his support for Michelle and Giovanni from home in the US.\n\nHis dedication to the TV star is evident, but what else is there to know about Michelle's husband? HELLO! has got the lowdown…\n\nWho is Michelle Visage's husband David Case?\n\nDavid Case is an author and screenwriter from Los Angeles. David and Michelle met at an industry party and were introduced by a mutual friend. The pair eventually tied the knot at a private ceremony in 1997 and share two daughters, Lillie, 23, and Lola, 21.\n\nWhen his wife joined Strictly, David threw his weight behind her many times, taking to Twitter to cheer her on. From cheeky tweets like: \"Congrats! I know she's a handful but she's such a dynamo! You're a fabulous partner!\" and \"Way to go, Honey!\" to retweeting Michelle's dance partner Giovanni – it seems David was the RuPaul star's biggest supporter.\n\nHow long has Michelle Visage been married?\n\nMichelle and David married in 1997, and have now been together for 24 years. The pair celebrated their 22nd wedding anniversary in June, and Michelle marked the occasion with a sweet throwback picture of her and her husband, captioning the post: \"This was a date night. I was at a club gig for my job on @1035ktu and he wanted to come along to see what I did at night.\n\nMORE: Michelle Visage looks UNRECOGNISABLE in throwback photo\n\n\"A week later we were engaged. Today is our 22nd anniversary and I have no idea where the time went, however, I know where my boobs went! To my love @jaxspenser thanks for the years and the hard yards you’ve put in (figuratively AND literally) I wouldn’t want to do this thing called love with anyone else. HAPPY 22ND!\"\n\nWhat have Michelle Visage and David Case said about their relationship?\n\nAccording to Michelle, the pair didn't have any worries about the infamous Strictly curse when she competed back in 2019. Speaking to The Sun at the time, the presenter and TV judge did admit that she can see how people fall victim to the curse, explaining: \"I can see how it does happen. If you are missing that physicality and contact and touch in your life, then maybe.\"\n\nDISCOVER: Who are Strictly star Michelle Visage's children Lillie and Lola? Find out everything you need to know\n\nThe star added, however, that it certainly won’t be affecting her marriage, and that husband David isn't worried at all. The 51-year-old explained: \"My husband knows me and loves me. We have been married for 22 years. When I told him I was with Gio, I said to him: 'Look how hot he is! And he was like, 'He is hot, go Giovanni!'\" Michelle added: \"So yeah, Giovanni is hot, but nothing is going to happen.\""
