        "text": "The Clown in a Gown\n\nBianca Del Rio, dubbed “The Joan Rivers of the Drag World” by the New York Times, is a dimple-cheeked, larger-than-life drag queen and outrageous comic who isn’t afraid to shock and offend. Fierce, funny, and fabulous, she has cemented her place in the pop culture Hall of Fame since appearing on the Emmy-Award-winning RuPaul’s Drag Race. Thanks to her snarky frankness, impeccable timing, and politically incorrect humor Bianca won the show’s sixth season as a fan favorite. She has since been named one of New York Magazine’s “Most Powerful Drag Queens,” where they described her as “the queen of all Drag Race queens” due to her dynamic career of comedy, hosting, and successful global tours.\n\nAmong Bianca’s most notable film accomplishments are her starring roles in the feature films Hurricane Bianca (2016), Hurricane Bianca 2: From Russia with Hate (2018), the Vimeo original comedy special Rolodex of Hate, and the Logo original television specials Not Today Bianca. Bianca also had a recurring role as a judge on Hulu’s Drag Me to Dinner, where teams of celebrity drag queens competed to see who could throw the most fabulous dinner party. Bianca also served as host of The Pit Stop, the online recap show for RuPaul's Drag Race, where she and a guest discussed the show’s latest episodes after each aired.\n\nDel Rio recently completed her fifth worldwide comedy tour, Unsanitized, playing to sold out audiences in 27 countries. This was coming off making history in 2019 on her It’s Jester Joke tour by being the first drag queen to headline Carnegie Hall and Wembley Arena, selling out both venues. She has also taken her trademark wit and sharp commentary to the page in her book Blame It On Bianca Del Rio: The Expert on Nothing with an Opinion on Everything (Harper Collins 2018). Del Rio also made her West End debut in the hit musical Everybody’s Talking About Jamie where she played the role of Hugo/Loco Chanelle."
