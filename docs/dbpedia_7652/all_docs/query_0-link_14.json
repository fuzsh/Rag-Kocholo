        "text": "(born 1960). American entertainer RuPaul was perhaps the most famous drag queen in the United States in the 1990s and early 21st century. A drag queen is a man who dresses up as a woman to entertain people. RuPaul’s career skyrocketed after he became popular with mainstream audiences.\n\nRuPaul Andre Charles was born on November 17, 1960, in San Diego, California. His parents divorced by the time he was seven. At age 15 he moved in with one of his older sisters in Atlanta, Georgia. While there he attended a performing arts high school. RuPaul always had a flair for dress-up. He began performing in drag in the underground movie and nightclub circuit in Atlanta. In 1987 he moved to New York, New York, and began his career in go-go bars. His first television appearances were on The Gong Show and MTV.\n\nRuPaul gained much recognition on the New York club scene for both his tall stature and his elaborate makeup and gowns. In 1993 he released the dance-pop album Supermodel of the World. It featured the upbeat single “Supermodel (You Better Work),” which became a mainstream hit. In the music video he strutted in a blonde wig and assorted glamorous outfits. Its success led to parts for RuPaul in several films, including Crooklyn (1994), Blue in the Face (1995), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), and To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar (1995). In addition, in 1995 he appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie. It detailed New York City’s annual drag music festival. That same year he signed a contract with M.A.C. Cosmetics, making him the first drag queen to become a spokesmodel for a major cosmetics company.\n\nRuPaul returned to the recording studio for the album Foxy Lady (1996). In 1997 he released a holiday album titled Ho Ho Ho. Although he would not release another album until Red Hot (2004), RuPaul continued to appear in film and on television. He hosted a variety television program, The RuPaul Show (1997–98). He was also a frequent guest on talk shows and took on minor acting roles, which he would continue to do throughout his career.\n\nBeginning in 2009, RuPaul hosted and coproduced RuPaul’s Drag Race. It was a reality television show that named “America’s next drag superstar.” The popular program was credited with reviving RuPaul’s flagging career. He won five consecutive Emmy Awards as the show’s host, from 2016 to 2020. RuPaul’s Drag Race also received the Emmy for best reality competition program in 2018 and for best competition program in 2019 and 2020. RuPaul’s recordings from the early 21st century were often featured on the show. They included Glamazon (2011), Born Naked (2014), Realness (2015), Butch Queen (2016), American (2017), and You’re a Winner, Baby (2020). His short-lived talk show and a U.K. version of Drag Race both debuted in 2019. In 2020 RuPaul cocreated the Netflix comedy TV series AJ and the Queen. He played a drag queen traveling across the United States with a 10-year-old girl. However, the network canceled the show after the first season.\n\nRuPaul also kept busy with other interests. He published his autobiography, Lettin It All Hang Out, in 1994. His other books included Workin’ It!: RuPaul’s Guide to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Style (2010) and Guru (2018). In addition, in the early 21st century, he launched a cosmetics and perfume line."
