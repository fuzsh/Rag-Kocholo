        "text": "On a soundstage deep in the hills of Los Angeles one morning last August, RuPaul Charles and several drag queens made their way to a set that had been transformed into a simulacrum of the reality-TV show “The Bachelor.” Lacy strands of lights dripped down plastic boxwood hedges, and a row of white fluted columns framed a velvety red strip of carpet. A hot tub bubbled quietly in a corner. The contestants arranged themselves onto a set of bleachers to be appraised by the dashing bachelor, who in this scene was played by the actor Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, best known for his role on the Lifetime television drama “UnREAL.” They were filming the latest season of the reality competition show “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” and the day’s challenge was meant to showcase the competitors’ acting abilities. The challenge, called “The Bitchelorette,” was a parody of the farcical dynamics that play out on “The Bachelor” each season. The goal was not to win Bowyer-Chapman’s heart but rather to see who could perform — satirize, really — stereotypes of femininity with enough humor to impress the judges.\n\nThis was an “all star” season, meaning the eight contestants had all appeared in previous seasons. One queen was dressed like a Barbie doll, her makeup exaggerating her features so that her eyes, lips and rosy cheeks resembled an anime character. Another, dressed in an ice-blue peignoir, petted a stuffed lap dog with one hand and preened with the other. A queen wearing a purple halter dress and a fringe wig clutched a martini glass and wobbled dramatically in her hot pink heels.\n\nThe camera crews started filming. Charles, dressed in an expertly tailored light pink suit, stepped onto the set as the fun-house version of Chris Harrison, host of the “The Bachelor.” Bowyer-Chapman beamed, gamely playing the part of an anxious suitor. Instead of long-stemmed red roses, he would hand out bulging purple eggplants, a nod to their popular use as suggestive emoji. Charles asked Bowyer-Chapman if he was ready to begin the ceremony. Suddenly, the two froze, and their eyes locked. Charles whispered into Bowyer-Chapman’s ear, and in one smooth sweep, Bowyer-Chapman scooped up all 6 feet 4 inches of Charles and strolled away. The departure sent the queens into a choreographed frenzy. The martini drinker pretended to faint. Another queen whipped out an oversize flip phone and screamed at her agent. One pulled out a paper bag and breathed heavily into it.\n\nThe director called cut, and everyone broke into boisterous laughter, including me. The footage would be assembled into a short film and played for the judges, who would grant the queen whose performance they deemed the best with an automatic slot in the competition’s next round. Part of me wanted to be offended at the over-the-top interpretations of “female” behavior, but I was defenseless against the sheer silliness of it all, and the way that it slyly highlighted how our culture coaxes us to treat finding love as a competition.\n\nBowyer-Chapman, a die-hard fan of the show who is a frequent guest judge, later told me that he felt the scene was cutting commentary on both the racial discrimination of “The Bachelor,” which has never had an African-American star, and the way television warps people. The contestants “became caricatures of themselves in ways that were the polar opposite of what usually happens on ‘Drag Race,’ which is about finding the authenticity of yourself and showcasing it,” he said. The show reveals, Bowyer-Chapman argued, that regardless of gender and orientation, “we all have more in common than not.”\n\nDrag has been featured in popular culture for decades. Movies like “Kinky Boots,” “Tootsie,” “The Birdcage” — even “Mrs. Doubtfire” — have showcased men, some gay, some not, who dress and perform as women. But most tended to treat drag as high jinks. Nothing about the inner lives of queens has hit critical mass quite like “Drag Race,” not even the 1991 documentary “Paris Is Burning,” which followed the black and Latino drag ball circuit in New York during the 1980s. “It is a popular movie, but it didn’t reach everyone the way a weekly television show does,” said Lady Bunny, a drag queen in her 50s who is often regarded as one of the legendary figures of American drag culture. “Many people have never had any interaction with a drag queen, and barely know what it is,” Bunny continued. “Anytime Middle America gets a taste of a community that they’re not familiar with, it does normalize the L.G.B.T. experience.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
