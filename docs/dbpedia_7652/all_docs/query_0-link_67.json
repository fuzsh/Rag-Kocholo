        "text": "Goodbye Yellow Brick RoadElton John\n\n\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" is one of the few Bernie Taupin lyrics that is more about him than Elton John. The song is about giving up glitz for the simple life - not exactly Elton's M.O.\n\nWhat A Fool BelievesThe Doobie Brothers\n\nKenny Loggins co-wrote the Doobie Brothers hit \"What a Fool Believes,\" which is about a guy who just can't accept that an affair from long ago was meaningless to her.\n\nI Kissed a GirlKaty Perry\n\nKaty Perry's breakout hit \"I Kissed A Girl\" was surprising to those familiar with her past: her parents were pastors and she started off singing Christian music.\n\nElectric AvenueEddy Grant\n\nThe \"Electric Avenue\" in the Eddy Grant song is a real street. It got its name because it was the first street in London with electric lights.\n\nCarsGary Numan\n\nIn Gary Numan's \"Cars,\" the message is that cars lead to a mechanical society devoid of personal interaction. This didn't stop automakers from using it in commercials. Both Nissan and Oldsmobile have used it in ads.\n\nUncle John's BandGrateful Dead\n\n\"Uncle John's Band\" by the Grateful Dead was the first time the phrase \"God Damn\" appeared in a commercially-released song.\n\nFacebook, Bromance and Email - The First Songs To Use New WordsSong Writing\n\nWhere words like \"email,\" \"thirsty,\" \"Twitter\" and \"gangsta\" first showed up in songs, and which songs popularized them.\n\n\"Private Eyes\" - The Story Behind the SongSong Writing\n\nHow a goofy detective movie, a disenchanted director and an unlikely songwriter led to one of the biggest hits in pop history.\n\nCountry Song TitlesFact or Fiction\n\nCountry songs with titles so bizarre they can't possibly be real... or can they?\n\nSupertramp founder Roger HodgsonSongwriter Interviews\n\nRoger tells the stories behind some of his biggest hits, including \"Give a Little Bit,\" \"Take the Long Way Home\" and \"The Logical Song.\""
