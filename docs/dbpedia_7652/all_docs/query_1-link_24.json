As Dave (Zachery Knighton) looks for a new recipe to jumpstart his flagging sandwich business, his food truck is stolen.\n\nValerie Makes a Pilot\n\nWhile shooting footage for a reality TV pilot she hopes will get picked up by Bravo, Valerie Cherish learns that her nemesis Paulie G. is creating a series for HBO about a sitcom writer and his relationship with a neurotic older actress--a redhead named 'Mallory Church.' After dropping in on Andy Cohen's lunch at the Chateau Marmont, an incensed Valerie crashes the HBO offices to get them to cease and desist."
